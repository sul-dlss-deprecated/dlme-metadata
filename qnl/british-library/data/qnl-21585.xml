C 237GSP -5O -28 II.16 -GCBP SimlaNo. 28- i 6- G. 3rd INDIAN ARMY CORPS, 28th May igi6. To GENERAL HEADQUARTERS. Memorandum. In accordance with your No. i68-28-Oi of 24th May 1916, 1 have the honour to forward herewith th©-first instalment of despatch on the operations from 2,3rd January to the end of April 1916. (Sd.) G. F. GORRINGE, Lieut-General, Commanding 3rd Indian Army Corfu C237GSB—50-»28- ii . i 6»GCBP Simlaijrd to jisi January iqi 6. —On 26th January, General Townshend report ed a hostile division moving from Shumran towards the Hai. The General Officer Commanding, 3rd Division, was ordered across to the right bank on the 27ih to take command of all troops on that bank and the following troops were ferried across between 26th January and the end of the month to that side of the river:— 21st Infantry Brigade. 35th Infantry Brigade. 28th Battery, R. F. A. 1 troop, 16th Cavalry. 1 squadron, yih Lancers. 1 squadron, 33rd Cavalry. Reconnaissances were made of the country to the north and to the south and south-west. It was intended to move forward artillery on right bank to harass the enemy in the Hannah position, but the heavy state of the ground made this impossible. I personally arrived on the 28th and was appointed Chief of the Staff in charge of both General Staff and Administrative in addition to the command ol the much scattered 12th Indian Division. The operations up to the 29th of January had entailed considerable dis organisation of the force, which has been referred to and the circumstances explained in General Aylmer's despatch. The morale of the troops had suffered considerably through losses and weather and other conditions, and the fo ce was thoroughly disorganised, greatly demoralised and in no condition to resume hostilities. Steps were at once taken to reform the divisions and brigades, units of which had been mixed up and detailed (as they arrived) to formations other than those to which they belonged, to meet the circumstances of the moment. Arrangements were made to get the units into their proper brigades, to organise the drafts belonging to units in Kut, which had been sent forward with the force, and to distribute them among other units, as far as possible according to link and class, and so to build up and equalize units, who were gradually brought back into their proper formations. This was done as quickly as ferrying across the river and the muddy state of the ground would permit. The areas occupied by troops were organised and put in a state of de f eace. The site for a bridge and defensive bridgeheads was selected. Some diffi culty was experienced in finding a suitable site which met tactical requirements, and eventually a bridge 440 yards in length was constructed and opened for traffic on the nth of February. The land transport of the force was inadequate, being barely more than 1st line requirements ; this was supplemented by water transport in the form of mahelas, which were allotted to take the place of second line transport and supply column and thus impart some mobility to the force, although it limited its range of operations to close vicinity of the river.

Two cavalry reconnaissances were carried out— (1) of the eastern edge of the Suwaikieh Marsh to ascertain whether any movement of any body of troops through it from west to east was practicable. Ihis reconnaissance reported that movement by any large body of troops across the marsh was impracticable, although individuals or small parties could get through. (2) of the ground to the south of the Umm-el-Brahm round its eastern edge. '1 his was supported by one brigade of infantry and a field battery. An entrenched position was selected for and occupied by one brigade on the Senna Ggtfal, vide Map 1 near 16 Central. TV • # • Dunng this period the machine gun training of additional officers and men was put in hand and instruction was given in bomb throwing. The position occupied by the 7th Division was consolidated, the right flank strongly entrenched and approaches towards the enemy's position at Hannah were then pushed forward—our advanced trenches were on the 1st Februar&gt; within 1,0So yards of enemy's position, and by the 15th February an advance to within 720 yards had been made. By 15th February troops had been redistributed as follows The 7th Division on the left bank in Area A. The 3rd Division on the right bank in Area C with a detachment holding a defensive position at Senna (16 Central). Corps troops in Area B. One section howitzers, one mountain battery, less one section, one battery, R. F. A., were placed in position on the right bank upstream of Area C to enfilade the enemy's Hannah position. j6ih to 2gth February iqi 6. —On 16th February a detachment from the 3rd Division surprised and rounded up the village of Minthar Said Hashim at daylight, as it was suspected that enemy's spies were harbouring there. No suspicious characters were however found. On 18th February 300 Arabs backed by Turks worked up to within cne mile of the Senna position, but were driven off without difficulty. By 19th February the 4th Brigade Artillery had completed Us move from left to right bank and orders ( f. C. O. I9)*were issued for a forward move on the right bank, to commence on the 21st. During the night i9th -2oth the 51st Sikhs (28th Brigade) succeeded in capturing a Turkish piquet in front of tneir line. 1 hey were unable to hold on however, chiefly owing to the reinforcements, who had only some 3C0 yards to go, missing their way in the dark. The British officer detailed to command the reinforcement was an I. A. R. officer and was shot early in the advance. He had apparently not given any instructions to the other oilicers who accompanied him as to their objective ; they inclined to their right, went gallantly forward and reached the enemy's wire entanglements where the majority became casualties. In order to rlemonstrate against the rear of the enemy's position at Hannah and, if possible, to cause him some tangible loss, while at the same time to in duce him to disclose his dispositions, an operation vide T. C. O. 19'}' was planned for night of 2cth-2ist February ; but owing to rain making the ground impas sable it was postponed for 24 hours. Orders, at the same time/were issued to the 7th Division on the left bank to push on their trenches towards those of the enemy with the greatest vigour. During the night 2ist -22nd the 7th Division successfully drew the Turks In the Hannah position by sending up a rocket. The Turks opened a heavy fire and confirmed our information that the Hannah position was held in strength Sub sequent aeroplane reconnaissance showed that the enemy had-also^ perfected arrangements for reinforcing Hannah if necessary.4 •Appendix b. Under cover of darkness on the night of the 21st the advance on the right bank ordered in T. C. O. 19* began. I accompanied the column commanded by Major General Keary who had orders to inflict the maximum amount of damage, from the right bank, on the Turks in the rear of the Hannah position. Major-General Sir G. Younghusband held the Hannah position on the left bank. Brigadier-General Norie operated towards the north while Brigadier-General Rice held the bridgeheads on both banks at Wadi. Major-General Keary's column, reached its position an 6-25 a.m. on 22nd and by 7-10 a.m . had bombarded the enemy's camps in the vicinity of 6 D. 5. 1 with the result that cmsiderable confusion was caused and their horses and mounted troops stampeded. Meanwhile Brigadier-General Norie's column at south-east end of Suwalkieh Marsh had reached its position at daylight and commenced advancing towards the enemy's left flank at 7-15 a.m. This drew the enemy's fire and at i,5 OC) yards from the enemy's trenches the troops halted and built up a firing line. The position of Major-General Keary's force at 9*55 i s shown in red on the attached map. (Map No. 2). The left bank was effectively commanded from our position on the right bank and, had nee been m possession of a pontoon train, it would have been practicable to have crossed the Tigris, thrown a bridge across it, and to have shut in the Turkish garrison in their Hannah position ; the river was then low and current slack. During the day fire was directed on all parties of the enemy who attempted to return to their camp area or to reinforce their Hannah position. The position at nightfall is shown in attached map in blue. The artillery on the right and left banks bombarded the enemy s position from 5-45 p.m. to 6-30 p.m. The day's operations so alarmed the Turks on both banks as far back as Shumran, as to make them show their dispositions to meet attack. Aeroplane reconnaissance in the morning showed that the Hannah and Sinn positions were strongly held and that reserves were being harried from Shumran to vicinity of Madug and Megasis which were connected by ferry. On the 23rd February the situation on the right bank remained much the same. I was wounded, after carrying out a personal reconnaissance from our forward position, and Major-General Keary was directed by Corps Commander to take over command of all troops on the right bank. The enemy largely strengthened their defences at Sannaivat and their communications between o J Sannaivat and Hannah. They also dug trenches along the left bank of the Falahiyah bend to oppose our crossing of the river. Brigadier-General Norie sent reconnaissances west across the Suwaikieh Marsh and was ordered to push forward as far as possible. On 24th February in accordance with orders the 3rd Division pushed for ward a brigade of infantry and a battery to enfilade the rear of the Sannaiyat position 400 ; cavalry were driven out of Beit Aiessa, and the artillery fire on Sannaiyat was most effective. During the day, and also by intermittent fire during the night, everything possible was done by the 3rd Division to prevent the enemy strengthening his works and communication trenches on the left bank, and also, with some success, to hamper his supply airangements ; he however had meanwhile so firmly entrenched his snipers and troops along the left bank from Sannaiyat to Hannah that our watering arrangements from the Tigris were seriously interfered with. On 25th February the Cavalry Brigade reconnoitred round the Umm el- Brahm. In the evening water difficulties necessitated all but tivo squadrons being withdrawn to the rear of the Senna position. Meantime the Turks had t No. 1 entrenched a position near Beit Aiessa and from it toward Sinn Aftar redoubt, evidently to prevent our making any further move forward along the right bank. On the 26th General Norie demonstrated against the enemy's left flank. The enemy occupied their trenches at once and our artillery opened on them.5 During the night 26th-2 7th General Norie's force returned to camp and rejoined 7th Division. On the 27th the 36th Brigade at Senna pushed out one battalion, two squad rons cavalry and one section mountain battery to watch the Sheikh Saad road. On the 28th T. C. O. 21* was issued for the readjustment of the artillery •Appendix B. with a view to a forward movement on the right bank. This to be completed by 1 st March. On 29th it rained from 10 A.M. to dusk, which again delayed operations by rendering movement impossible. The cavalry brigade reconnoitred round the east end of the Umm-el-Brahm looking for water and to ascertain whether it would be possible for troops to obtain their water supply from it. The 36th Brigade supported them. It was then ascertained that the Umm-el-Brahm was bordered by a wide belt of deep mud, over a mile wide, which rendered it very difficult for men to water and impossible for animals without very considerable improvement as they became bogged; moreover the water could not be relied on, as a change of wind would blow it about the marsh area to such an extent as to make a difference of some miles in the length of any aqueduct or water channel which might be made. Similar reconnaissances along the western edge of the Umm-el-Brahm were made with like results. Aeroplane reconnaissance had ascertained that the enemy had no entrench ments between the Dujailah redoubt and the Hai and that there was apparently a large supply of water near the Dujailah redoubt. Lieutenant-General Aylmer decided therefore to make the attempt to relieve Kut by turning the enemy's right, and to surprise and assault the Dujailah redoubt as his first objective ; he feared that as soon as the Tigris came down in flood, the Turks would cut the bunds and so flood the country as to render all further operations to relieve Kut impracticable. He decided to make this attempt at the earliest possible date by which he could take into the field seven brigades with some 44 guns and 12 howitzers, this being the maximum force for which land transport was available, and he also decided not to await the arrival of any further reinforcements. March 1st to March 6th. — On March 1st the following troops were placed directly under the Corps by T. C. O. No. 23! as Corps Troops :— fAppendi* b. 35th Brigade. 3fcth Brigade. 37th Brigade (on arrival). 23rd Mountain Battery. 12th Company, S. and M. (less 1 section). Double company 12th Pioneers. With a view to the forthcoming operations on the right bank the 28th Brigade was transferred by night to the right bank, and the 92nd Punjabis were temporarily attached to the 37th Brigade, who had only then commenced to arrive. The administrative charge of Corps Troops Area left bank and of Bridgehead Area right bank were taken over by G. O. C., 7th Division (T. C. O. No. 23) and Lieutenant-Colonel Rattray was appointed Administrative Com mandant with a special staff detailed to assist him. Owing to gales and rising floods, however, the bridge, from time to time, became unsafe for traffic, which delayed operations, and the 28th Brigade did not cross the river till the evening of the 6th. The artillery on both banks were ordered to show increased activity during the next few days whilst the approaches by the 7th Division against the Hannah position were actively pushed forward. (T. C. O. 24 )4 &amp; j Appendix B. • u 3 r ^ March T. C. O. No. 25^ was issued for operations to take place on k Appendix B. ^'faht 5th and 6th, Ihe operation order stated that the Corps Commander's C237GSB6 Vap No I. * Appendix B. t Appendix B. Map No I. JAppendix B, Map No- I. Map No. 3. Map No# 4, Appendix D. intention was to cross the river in rear of the Hannah position. To give colour to this, bridge approaches to the river near Mason Mounds were pushed forward. T. C. O. No. 26* which superseded T. C. O. No. 25! was issued on the 6th instanty in which the real intention of the Corps Commander, namely, to turn the right of the enemy's Sinn position, was made known, though the formation of the columns was adhered to. On the 4th instant the 3rd Division were ordered to prepare a post near Ruined Hut (Square 16) to hold one battalion and one sec tion artillery and to cover the water there. On this day one of our aeroplanes was shot down near the Sinn position by the 1 urks, both the observer and pilot being killed. Bombardments of the Hannah position were arranged to take place between evening of 4th, morning and evening of 5th and morning of 6th. All operations had to be postponed for 24 hours on the 4th and again on the 5^ on account of rain which rendered the ground quite impassable. Meanwhile aeroplane reports showed that the enemy were actively entrenching a series of small entrenchments each some 200 yards in length and about 5 00 yards apart between Dujailah redoubt and the river Hai. On the 6th T. C. O, No. 26^ was issued and divisional generals, brigadiers and brigade commanders, each with a staff officer, were ordered to meet the Corps Commander at Senna at 2 P.M. the following day. In the early morning all Arabs were cleared out of Said Hashim by the cavalry brigade. During the day the 3rd Division prepared a position on the line 15 A 7/8—24 A 9/4 for occupation by General Rice's force. During the night 5th-6th the extemporized light pontoons and bridging equipment for crossing the Hai were taken to the post at Ruined Hut where they could be easily sent back for and quickly brought forward should the preliminary opera tions and capture of the Sinn right bank position be successful. The 92nd Punjabis formed the escort. yth March to gth March.—{All references to Map 1 except where ex- f res sly stated.) At 2 P.M. on the 7th the Corps Commander assembled all general officers Commanding divisions, brigadiers and brigade commanders, except those of 7th Division at Senna. I went carefully through the operation orders and explained Corps Commander's wishes to them, laying particular stress on the fact that the operation was designed to effect a surprise, and that to obtain success and to prevent the enemy's bringing up his reinforcements to forestall us, it was essential that the first phase of the operations', the capture of the Dujailah Redoubt, should be pushed through with the utmost vigour and that the success of the operation depended on this being done. Map T. C. 8 (Map 3) was shown to all present. A few minor points were raised by general officers commanding which were settled during the conference, after which all joined their commands. At 4-30 P.M. the 7th Division sent make a demonstration in that direction. Divisional Area. The attached map (Map 4) gives the position of the troops at nightfall, whilst Appendix D gives the order of battle. To carry out the plan of turning the right flank of the enemy's position at Sinn the following disposition of troops was made:— Major-General Sir G. Younghusband, with one squadron cavalry, nine batta lions, three field batteries, two howitzer batteries and two 4'' guns (24 guns), two companies Sappers and Miners, details and gunboats, was to contain the enemy in the Hannah position, protect the Wadi camps and the Tigris bridge. They were denuded of all but their barest necessities of first line transport in order to free the same for the remainder of the force. Brigadier-General Rice with one squadron cavalry, one section R. F. A. and one brigade was to cover the rendezvous of the troops operating on the right bank by occupying a line 15 a 7/8—24 a 9/4. At dawn on the 8th instant this detachment was to close to the south and escort the second line transport and ammunition column of the force. a small column towards the north to After dark this column returned to 7th7 The remainder of the troops were to assemble near the junction of squares 16 c and 24 b by 8-30 p.m. as follows Under Brigadier-General Christian—Column ' /J.' 1 brigade infantry. 1 battery, R. F. A. 1 section, S. and M. J Pioneer battalion. Under Major-General Kemball—Column 0 B. ' 2 brigades infantry. 1 brigade, R. F. A. 1 section, Howitzers. ■| company, S. and M. It was originally intended that Column ' A' and the cavalry brigade should push forward towards Imam-el-Mansur and prevent reinforcements cross ing the Hai—the aeroplane reports of the 5th and 6th instants however disclosed the facts that the enemy were rapidly extending their entrenchments between the Dujailah and the Hai and the plan of operations had to be amended accordingly and Column ' A ' was placed under Major-General Kemball's orders for the first phase of the operations. The whole operation was so largely dependent on the energy and dash of the commander and of the troops detailed to assault the Dujailah Redoubt, that the selection of the brigades for and commanders of Columns 'A' and B' received the Corps Commander's most careful con sideration. Under General Stephen. Cavalry brigade. Under General Keary—Column ' C. ,: 3 brigades infantry (less ij battalions). 2 brigades, R. F. A. (less 2 batteries and 1 section). 2 howitzer batteries (less 1 section). Mountain battery (less 1 section). To these troops was allotted the task of turning the right flank of the •appendix b. Es Sinn position. See T. C. O. No. 26* attached. Columns 'A,' 'B,' ' C ' and cavalry brigade were to be assembled at the position of assembly at 8-30 p.m. and to move off at 9 p.m. The formation to be adopted is given in Appendix C. The assembly was successfully carried out; the most careful preparations had been made by the staff of both the Corps and the 3rd Division to assist the movement of the troops in the dark by screened lights, etc. A certain amount of delay occurred, however, chiefly on account of the artillery having to come over bad ground in the dark. As soon as they arrived in position the column closed to its front and at 10-22 p.m. the head of the column moved off. During the march to the position of deployment at 33. a. 5 /5 the head of the 3rd Division lost touch with the cavalry brigade and about one hour's delay resulted. 4t 2-4$ a.m. the head of Column rC A ' reached 33 a 5/5, having been well led by Captain Mason, R.E. There being no landmarks of any kind the march was entirely directed by compass and dead reckoning. 1 he difficulty ''of there being no landmarks is added to by the fact that the maps in our posses sion, being based on aeroplane and Arab reports only, are not accurate enough to depend on. The 3rd Division did not reach 33. a. 5*5^ 4-40 a.m. From this point Columns ' A' and ' B ' and cavalry brigade moved on at 4 a.m. but instead s8 of reaching the southern bend of the Dujailah depression (41 b 1-2) before dawn (5-30 a.m.) as was intended, it was still 1,500 yards short of that point at 6-3oa.m., owing to Major-General Kemball having halted his column to deploy the leading battalions of the two leading brigades, and also to bring up his field ambulances; this delay was fatal to the success of the operation. By 6-50 a.m. the whole of ' A ' and ' B ' Columns were in the depression and hidden from view of the enemy. Further delay still took place to allow the artillery to register and for re connaissance by brigade commanders. Although it is probable that some move ment had been observed, as flares were seen to be lit in the direction of the Dujailah at about 3-30 a .m. the movement of so large a force does not seem to have been suspected, as the Dujailah does not appear to have been strongly held when Major-General Kemball's column reached its allotted position. This is corroborated by later information. In this, flat country it is practically impossi ble to conceal movement from hostile Arabs, but the movement of so large a body of troops seems to have come on this occasion as a surprise, and energetic and bold action on the part of Major-General Kemball would still have fore stalled the enemy in his attempts to reinforce the Dujailah Redoubt. On 'A ' and ' B ' Columns reaching the depression the cavalry brigade pushed on to 32 d. 7-8. Meanwhile Column C ' had moved from the position of deployment at 4-40 a.m. and got into position covering the guns which opened fire to register at 6-55 a.m. Up till 8 a.m. the inaction of the enemy opposite Column 'C ' was most marked, only a few rifle shots being fired. Repeated messages were sent to Major-General Kemball directing him to push forward and at 8-30 and again at 11-30 messages were sent to say Column ' C ' was in position and that he was to ' push on. ' The guns of Major-General Kemball's Column began to register at about 7 a.m. Owing to the congestion in the depression the leading brigade (35th) was not ready to move till 8 40 a.m. Column ' A ' was directed against Turk trenches south of the depression in 31 d and 40 b so as to cover the left flank of troops attacking the Dujailah Redoubt, the shrine Imam-el-Mansur (31 c 2-4) being given as a land-mark towards which to move. The plan of attack was for the 9th Brigade to advance on a front of 600 yards on the Dujailah Redoubt with its right on the west bank of the depression, while the 28th Brigade moved forward in support on a front of 400 yards in echelon on the left flank of the 9th Brigade. The Corps artillery and 3rd Division were ordered to support the advance of the 9th Brigade, firing on targets laid down by the Brigadier General Royal Artillery. Great delay occurred in the issue of these three brigades from the depression. It was not till 9-45 a.m. that the 9th Brigade was fully deployed and ad vanced to the attack followed by the 28th Brigade. The 36th Brigade was not deployed till 9-35 a.m. when it pushed forward and by 11 -30 a.m. had driven the enemy from some trenches about 31 d 10-6 and 31 d 5-10. Up to this time the enemy had not shown themselves in any large num bers. At 10-30 a .m. the firing line of the 9th Brigade was hotly engaged with the enemy in their advanced trenches, which owing to their being concealed in brushwood were almost impossible to locate. By means of reinforcements the 9th Brigade manage to advance within 1,500 yards of the enemy's trenches but contrary to orders, part of the 9th Brigade crossed the Dujailah depression.' Here it came under a very heavy cross fire from trenches running south-west and south-east from the Dujaileh Redoubt and the attack remained stationary for some time, although supported by all the artillery and musketry fire which could bebrought to bear by Corps artillery and Column ' C,' which had pushed forward to within 1,400 yards of the enemy's line between Dujailah and Sinn Aftar. At 1 P.M. 36th Brigade was ordered by Major-General Kemball to move in support of the left flank of the 28th Brigade. The 37th Brigade had also gradually pushed forward to support the attack of Column ' B,' and between noon and 1 P.M. one battalion had got within 500 yards of the Dujailah Redoubt. At 2-10 P.M. the 28th and 36th Brigades pushed forward in line with the advance of the 9th Brigade. The enemy counter attacked freely and their trenches were difficult to locate in the scrub. Major-General Kemball reported that he was unable to make any further progress. Since the first attack of the 9th Brigade, enemy reinforcements had been seen moving in large numbers from Magasis and Sinn Aftar towards the Dujailah. Ihese reinforcements came under heavy fire from the artillery of Column ' C ' and Corps artillery and suffered, heavily. The 8th Brigade who were on the right rear of the 7th Brigade were ordered to cross behind the artillery and take up a position in reserve behind the 37th Brigade and opposite the Dujailah Redoubt. The Engineers reported that the water supply could not be effectively improved by digging and the provision of water for the whole force became a matter of urgency ; in view of this, arrangements were made for an attack on the Dujailah to be made by the 8th Brigade supported by the 9th, 28th and 37th Brigades at 4-30 P.M., the 35th Brigade only being kept in Corps reserve to watch the Sinn Aftar and to guard against counter-attack on our right flank. It was however not found practicable to make the necessary dispositions over so wide an area by 4-30 P .M. aud the attack was delayed until 5- 15, when a heavy bombardment of the Redoubt was opened by all guns except those detailed to counter hostile artillery, especially that in the vicinity of the Sinn Aftar. Under cover of this bombardment the 9th and 28th Brigades again pushed focward and succeeded in advancing another 300 yards where they were stopped by heavy fire and the 36th Brigade, in spite of the explicit orders that this brigade was not to be used in the assault, was directed by Major-General Kemball to assault the Dujailah Redoubt, which it did with great gallantry. Simultaneously the 8th Brigade, passing through the 37th Brigade, steadily pushed forward. By 5-20 P.M. the leading two battalions of the 8th Brigade, Manchesters and 59th Rifles, and some of the 37th Brigade had succeeded in gaining a footing in the Redoubt. They were however very heavily counter-attacked by large enemy reinforcements and being subjected to an extremely rapid and accurate shrapnel fire from enemy's guns in the vicinity of Sinn Aftar which had hitherto remained inactive, they were, in spite of the greatest gallantry, forced to fall back to the position from which they started. Up to this time the enemy's artillery had fired but little and, owing to this and to mirage, the hostile guns, which appear to have been concealed behind the Sinn Aftar, could not be located accurately by the guns detailed to reply to them or by aeroplanes, with the result that they were able to enfilade the ri^ht of our assault and thus to break it up before the mass of our troops could actually reach the Redoubt. On seeing that the (second assault on the Dujailah Redoubt had failed the Corps Commander at once issued the following orders 1. 35th Brigade to cover the right of the artillery on the line 32 b 0 /4 to 23 d 4/8. 2. 37th Brigade to fall back to junction of squares 32 d and 33 a. 3. Major-General Kemball's Column and Column ' A ' to hold line 32 b 4/10 to 32 d 10/5 with a brigade in reserve about 32 d 10/0, and to put piquets out on the line 32 d 10/4 to 32 b 10-4 covering C237GSBio the rear of the second line transport and ammunition column. His artillery was to withdraw to 32 b 6-5. 4. Cavalry brigade to withdraw to 32 b 8-0 whilst second line transport and the ammunition column were ordered to park at 32 b 8-8. 5. General Keary with his brigades to join up the left of the 35th Bri gade with the right of Major-General Kemball's column on the line 32 a 10-4 through 32 Central to 32 b 4-10. Owing to the difficulty of getting away his wounded, however, Major-General Kemball was unable to move to the position ordered till early the following morn ing. He remained the night therefore near 41 b 4-0. During the night carts were sent out to him, and all his wounded as well as those of other columns were evacuated to second line transport camp by 8-30 a.m. on the 9th. At 1 a.m. the enemy opened a heavy fire from the Dujailah Redoubt, but made no attempt to advance from their trenches. The troops, who had been under arms since 2 p.m. on the 7th, and some of them for a considerably longer period, were now much exhausted. They had carried out a long night march and had been engaged in continuous operations under heavy fire the whole of the 8th, which operations included two unsuccess ful assaults on a strongly held position. The only water available was that from two rain water pools in the Dujailah depression ; the water in these was limited and barely sufficient at the most for the whole force for one day. The casualties, especislly those among officers, were severe. Any further assault therefore on the night Sth-Qth gave no hope of success ful results. Owing to lack of water or transport for the same, prolonged operations by a large force could not be undertaken from the country to the east and south east of the Sinn Aftar and Dujailah. As previously pointed out, the Umm-el- Brahm does not afford a water supply as it is bordered by a wide belt of mud.,* It was possible however that the enemy, who had evidently suffered heavily might withdraw during the night. It was therefore decided to await the result of reconnaissances in the morning to see whether any such withdrawal by the enemy took place during the night and, should such occur, to be ready to take advantage of the same. At 9 p.m. orders were issued for the force to stand to arms with transport ready to move at 5 a.m. on the 9th, and column and brigade commanders were ordered to send a staff officer to Headquarters for orders at that hour. Orders for the withdrawal to Camp Wadi were prepared in event of circumstances necessitating the same being ordered. Dispositions were as follows :— General Keary with cavalry brigade (less two squadrons), four batteries K.r .A. and three infantry brigades was to demonstrate against Sinn Aftar and then to act as right flank guard to the force retiring. The 8th Brioade with 23rd Mountain Battery and one troop of cavalry were detailed to furnish the advanced guard. Major-General Kemball with two infantry brigades, one Pioneer battalion and one brigade K.I 4 .A. was to take up a rearguard position to cover the retirement. General Christian with one infantry brigade, one battery and two squadrons of cavalry was to watch the left flank of the main body and, when it had ^ot clear, to join it. ^ Second line transport, field ambulances, remainder of artillery and all avail- able empty carts with wounded, etc. At daylight on the 9th the enemy appeared to be still in position. All were warned at 6-30 a.m . that there would probably be no move till o watered meantlme ammunltio n should be replenished and men and animalsII The aeroplane reconnaissance showed no signs of withdrawal on the part of the enemy and orders were issued for the retirement to commence at 10-15 A - M - The 3rd Division and Corps artillery opened fire on Sinn Aftar Redoubt and, masked by the same, the retirement commenced. Major-General Kemuall commenced his withdrawal at 11-45 and was unmolested until after 1 p.m. when an enemy column of 1 ,500 cavalry with guns and machine guns opened on him from about 2,000 yards. Our artillery soon checked their further advance. _ General Christian on the eft flank was unmolested and fell back at 1 p.m. joining the main body and taking command of it. The withdrawal of General Keary's Column was delayed owing to difficulty in getting in the wounded of the 7th Brigade, but by 3 p.m. his force was moving steadily north-east. The mirage at this time was very bad and an enemy force which was then following up our retirement was mistaken for Major- General Kemball's Column at 4-15 P. m . until shelling from the rear began and dispelled this illusion ; the enemy meantime had reached to within 1,800 yards. On our artillery openkig, enemy's fire decreased. At 3-20 p.m. orders were issued for all troops to return to VVadi camp, one brigade of 3rd Division being left in occupation of the line Arab village to ^enna, and two battalions and two guns at Twin Canals. Troops reached Wadi camp without further incident after dark. The wounded began to arrive at Wadi at 4 p.m. and the last wounded man was attended to in hospital at Wadi at 2 a.m. 1 would here draw attention to the great gallantry and high devotion to duty displayed by the officers and subordinates of the Medical Corps and by the Army Bearer Corps throughout the operation. In the attack and subsequent withdrawal at the Oujailah they collected and attended to the wounded under heavy fire, even as far as the enemy's trenches, in a manner which attracted the admiration of the whole force. All possible measures were taken in withdrawing the wounded to Wadi and attending to their requirements there. ^ After this attack on the Dujailah, aeroplane reconnaissance showed that the enemy at once begarl to establish a strong chain of redoubts connected by tren- ches in continuation of the trenches which were found to exist south-west of the JJujailan to the Hai. They also established works on the Jumailiat ridee and piquet posts east of the Dujailah and Sinn Aftar. 10th Match to 21st March. 10th March.—On the morning of the 10th March a hostile column of infan- M ap No, try and cavalry was reported by the detachment at Twin Canals to be approach- R g H r0 A the ( 5 outh - The G - a C -. 3rd Division, sent two squadrons and section K H. A to Senna to report to tbe brigadier there, and held one infantry bri- gade and one battery ready to move if necessary. The G. O. C., 3rd Division was instructed to move forward and re-occupy the line of the Thorny Nullah in cluding Masons Mounds. The re-occupation of Abu Roman was intended for a subsequent operation. At 6 P .m. General Egerton moved out from Senna. At 6-4^ p.m. hostile cavalry who had worked round south of the Umm-el-Brahm fired a few shells at the 3rd Division Camp at Wadi. The cavalry brigade were ordered out at Shl^SaLH^M^ vi T ^ hostll f cava lry and to reconnoitre towards necessity tcf be ddayet 0f ^ W0Unded (,0Wnstream had . .During the day orders were issued for the artillery to rejoin their own divisions, the Corps artillery remaining under Corps control. These movements to be completed by 13th March. movements All troops on the right bank were placed under General Kearv's orders for a mmistrative purposes, but the command of the cavalrv brifade anH r artillery was retained in the hands of the Corps Commander. P12 The 7th Division detachment on the right bank enfilading the Hannah position was relieved by the 3rd Division after dark. March nth. —General Egerton's plan of operations was to attack Masons Mounds at dawn, but during his approach to the enemy's position his troops missed their direction, overran Thornv Nullah in the dark, attacked and took the trenches leading to Abu RoiV&gt;an, capturing two officers and 50 men. He then withdrew to Thorny Nullah. Without waiting to report this to Divisional Headquarters or to ascertain whether under these circumstances the capture of Abu Roman should not be proceeded with, he withdrew to the line which he had been instructed to occupy in view of his instructions not to go as far forward as Abu Roman. This was un fortunate ; his troops were heavily shelled during his retirement, losing over 300 officers and men; they could easily have remained where they were during the day and have withdrawn under cover of darkness if his occupation of Abu Roman position was not sanctioned. Meantime G. O. C., 3rd Division, sent forward re inforcements with instructions to re-occupy Abu Roman. As the attack was developing however it commenced to rain heavily and the attack was stopped. The 7th Brigade therefore consolidated itself in Thorny Nullah with piquets in advance. At 11 a .M. the cavalry brigade reported no enemy towards Shaikh Saad and only a troop of hostile cavalry visible retiring south-west. The wounded were at once sent down escorted by a gunboat as far as Sheikh Saad. The G. O. C., 3rd Division, was directed to arrange for the occupation of the line Abu Roman to Twin Canals with one infantry brigade and a battery. An other infantry brigade and a battery were to be in close support at Senna with a detached post at Said Hashim. Detachments were to be furnished at Arab village and the sandhills down stream of it. The remainder of the division was to be io camp VVadi right bank. Orders were this day issued for the 34th Pioneers, who had been attached to the 37th Brigade, to rejoin the 3rd Division, and the 92nd Punjabis the 7th Division. 1 he 35th Brigade was attached to the 7th Division so as to allow of proper reliefs being effected. The 37th Brigade was similarly attached to 3rd Division. A company of Sappers and Miners (20th) was attached temporarily to 7th Division from 3rd Division to assist them in pushing forward their approa ches and protecting the trenches, etc., against flooding. The advanced detach ments of the 13th Division had commenced to arrive on 8th instant ; these were now sent down to Sheikh Saad where it was decided that the 13th Division should concentrate. March /^/^.-—Ihe 3rd Division made the necessary arrangements for the occupation of the line Twin Canals—Thorny Nullah as a preliminary to working along trenches towards Abu Roman and Masons Mounds and at 5 p.m., were in position. All moves over the river had to be postponed on account of the rain. The outpost line on the left bank was readjusted and re-allotted between 7th Division and Corps Troops. In accordance with telegram No. 42928 I took over command of the Tigris Corps and attached troops on forenoon of nth and General Aylmer left at 12 noon the day following. March 13th. —Nil. March 14th.--The G. O. C., 3rd Division, reported that the enemy had been strongly reinforced at Abu Roman and that at least a brigade would now be necessary to capture the position there. He proposed to capture this position before dawn on the 15th and sanction was given to this operation The 92nd Punjabis, who had not yet rejoined the 7th Division owing to bad weather were left at the disposal of the G.O.C., 3rd Division, until this operation had been carried out. Further reconnaissances during the day however showed that certain enemy guns had been brought forward on the left bank and so com manded the Abu Roman position, that ihey would have to be dealt with before Abu Roman position could be re-occupied.*3 The operation therefore was postponed pending the aitlllery dealing with these guns, which they subsequently engaged with success causing their with drawal. J$th March. —The river came down in heavy flood during the night 14th' 15th and the bridge was thrown out of order and had to be closed to all traffic. Bunds on both banks began to give way, necessitating large parties being kept at work on them both by day and night. During the afternoon the bund across the mouth of the Orah nullah burst, thus closing the road between Wadi Camp and Sheikh Saad on the right bank. During the morning the cavalry carried out a reconnaissance to find a site in the upper half of square 43 b suitable for a post and a supply depot. While the country between Abu Roman and Masons Mounds became rapidly flooded, a strenuous fight with the floods now commenced to prevent the whole country being inundated; the miles and miles of embankments required constant attention and offensive operations against the Turks had to be temporarily suspended ; all hands worked their hardest and splendid work was done, especially by the Sappers and Miners and Pioneers. r lhe 7th Division were compelled to abandon all attempts at sapping unti^ the floods subsided. During the day however the artillery on right bank tried to deal with the guns that had been troubling the 3rd Division from the left bank. Aeroplane observation was only partially successful. The floods bad meanwhile isolated Masons Mounds. The G. O. C., 3rd Division, accordingly arranged to rush Masons Mounds at dawn on the 16th. This operation was successfully carried out with slight loss in the early morning. No. 28-20-G. Headquarters, 3rd (I ndian) Army Corps. To 16th June igi6. GENERAL HEADQUARTERS. In continuation of my No. 28-16-G., dated 28th May 1916, I have the honour to forward herewith the second instalment of despatch on operations Irom 23rd January 1916 to 30th April 1916. Lists, etc., referred to on page 33 will follow. (Signed) G. F. GORRINGE, Lieutenant-General^ Commanding, 3rd Indian Army Corps, C237GSB Map No. 6. See Map No. 12 showing coflntry liable to fl jod.14 16th During the night 15th-16th the Infantry and section of guns, at Sodom were compelled to move to the east bank of the Orah on account oE the floods, which had poured through the break in the Orah Canal embankment. This detachment at Sodom was accordingly ordered to withdraw with its guns to Sheikh Saad. Major G. H. Stack, R.E., undertook the difficult task of repairing the break at Orah and, under his energetic and capable direction, work continued through out the day and night. 1 his difficult task was successfully carried out by the Sappers and Miners and 34th Pioneers. Arrangements were perfected for patrolling the bunds by day and night, to ensure any breaks being rapidly mended. The flooded river washed away the protective netting in front of the bridge ; in order, therefore, to protect the bridge from mines, drifting wood, etc., a searchlight was placed on the left bank to throw a beam aslant across the river, a gunboat was ordered to be ready above the bridge, and a launch was ordered to be ready, at all times, just downstream from the searchlight, to pick up anything threatening the bridge. 17th March. —The 13th Division at Sheikh Saad were ordered to recon noitre the Sheikh Saad-Kut road towards 34 ^ ^ (Map 1) with the following objects :— (1) To ascertain what bunds would be necessary to secure against over flow from the Umm-el-Brahm. (2) To find a site which would be suitable in 34 B (Map 1) or south-east of 25 D (Map 1) tor an advanced supply depot. (3) To report whether it would be possible to water 10,000 mules and 4,000 horses at the site selected. (4) To examine the Sweet Water Canal, and report on its crossing. This reconnaissance was carried out, one brigade I3^h Division marching 0^ the same night. The suitable site was selected and the necessary watering arrangements were reported on. 18th March. —Launch No. 5 fouled an anchor cable, drifted broadside on to the bridge, and, despite all efforts to save her, sank. The bridge was consider ably distorted and reconstruction delayed 12 hours. igth March.—^he G. O. C., 3rd Division, reported that, owing to the flooded state of the ground, an attack on Abu Roman position could not be carried out without heavy loss—as an alternative he put forward proposals for holding the present line with two brigades, and this proposal I approved. 20th March. One brigade of the 13th Division was ordered to move on the 21st, to Wadi camp right bank to relieve a brigade of the 3rd Division. Map No. 6. The 3rd Division was then concentrated in the area, Senna. Thornv Nullah Mason's Mounds, Twin Canals. ^ ' The double company 12th Pioneers on the left bank were pushed up to join the 7th Division, and assist in the sapping operations. 22nd March.—So as to protect and maintain the telegraph line road and bunds between Wadi and Sheikh Saad a post of a double company, from Wadi camp right bank, was placed at the mouth of the Orah Canal; a similar post was placed at Gomorrah, found by 13th Division from Sheikh Saad and the limits of responsibility of each were laid down. „ , A ^ et ^ ch ™ e ' t of 0 , n ® i 1 ® 11 , 1516 company and a machine gun was sent to Sodom by U. U. L., 3rd Division, the ground having now dried up In spite of adverse conditions as to weather and floods and constant opnosi- tion by the enemy, good progress had been made in sapping by the ith Division towards the enemy's Hannah position, which still appeared to be strongly held and which was constantly being strenghtened by the enemy who were however much harrassed by our artillery and machine gun fire It had now been made very forcibly evident that any operation on the right bank towards Sinn must entail the control of the river bSnds as far as Abu Roman. From local intelligence and other reliable sources, a map of the m. p No. „. areas which were liable to flood had been prepared, and this showed that when the I igns flood level was above 11. feet, it would be possible to flood ^ whole area between the Senna position and Sinn Aftar, and that, once such a flo J Map No. is. started, it would force its way over the Sheikh Saad-Kut Road, which couM only be maintained^dry by securing the bunds along the Tigris between Abu Roman and Orah canal mclus've. _ To give some idea of the work which this entailed it may be noted that the river had risen to 113 feet 3 inches and liter on actually reached 113 feet xo inches. To secure our'hold over and controt of1 5 these bunds it therefore became essential to maintain our hold over the n or hf bank of Tigris and to hold the same in force. 19 4 In my appreciation, forwarded to General Headquarters on 15th instant under my 11-429-0. of 15th, I had proposed to demonstrate only against the Hannah position and to make a wide turning movement, crossing the Hai, to turn the enemy's right flank—this was based on previous information that the Shaikh Saad and Kut road could not be flooded, and the estimate that our steamers and road would admit of the transport of the 13th Division reaching me in time to utilise them, and thus enable me to reach the Hai with ten dnys' supplies. It was now clear however that this estimate was incorrect and in fact the second line transport for this division never reached the force until after all operations were over. In view of the above, and the near arrival of more heavy artillery and aeroplanes I decided as sapping had progressed so favourably, 6n a second attempt ^ on the Hannah position, I decided to entrust the task of assaulting the position to the fresh British troops of the 13th Division, and to train them specially for this task. With a view to forthcoming operations, arrangements were made for the G. O. C., 13th Division, and his staff to come up from Sheikh Saad to go thoroughly over the 7th Division trenches ; most careful and detailed arrange ments were made to facilitate the concentration of the 13th Division in the trenches and for their assault of the enemy's Hannah position from there. The task of enfilading the Hannah position, by machine gun fire from the right bank, was entrusted to Brigadier-General Christian, to whom was allotted besides the machine gun battery of the 36th Brigade those of the 35th and 28th Brigades. , ^ would draw attention to the fine work carried out by the 7th Division during the sapping operations, under the able and resourceful direction of Lieu* tenant-Colonel G. A. J. Leslie, R.E., during this period Nos. 3 and 20 Com panies Sappers and Miners achieved an average of four feet per hour forward and six feet sideways, while the 12th and 107th Pioneers progressed three feet per hour forwards and four feet sideways. This rate of progress, considering that the work was continued for a pro longed period by day and night constantly under heavy fire and frequently hampered by having to deal with flooding, is in my opinion very creditable. . ^ e P artur e from Basrah of the R.E. Companies of the 13th Division and t eir Pioneers had been delayed so as to employ them on line of communication work, road making, etc., in connection with the despatch of reinforcements by and route—'the want of this extra skilled R, E. and Pioneer labour with mv troops, however, greatly handicapped our preparations for the assualt.- In addition to this a very large amount of labour was expended in: improving communication and other trenches and securing them against flood and in the preparation and equipment of parallels and depots. The 7th Division, I consi der, have every reason to be proud of the trenches which they handed over to the 13th Division and are entitled to a very considerable share of the credit of capturing the Hannah position. 23rd March, During the following week preparations were pushed forward for the assault on the Hannah position. Wirecutters, wire breakers, sandbags, artillery screens to mark the flanks of the advance, red flags to signal to our artillery to lift their fire, etc., were issued and a good supply of Mill's bombs was now received, and were distributed as they arrived. The 7th Division were '• t0 ^ two more communication trenches. Representatives of the 66th Brigade, R. F. A., 13th Division, now concentrated at Sheikh Saad, were ordered up to receive their instructions from the Brigadier-General Royal Artillery and to see the ground. The 3rd Division were ordered to open out the line of trenches on the right bank between Arab village and the Sandhills, so as to MapNo enable Brigadier General Christian's machine gun batteries to enfilade, from successive positions, the enemy's Hannah trenches as far west as Sannaiyat. r } 1 ^ e ^ n ^ e by now been remade under the direction of Lieutenant- colonel h. C. Ogilvie, R.E, and was thrown open to wheeled traffic again at 11 T' n ] *A ^ L ,ei i tenan t-Colonel E. C. Ogilvie, R.E., was placed in charge ot the Bridging Tram and the 12th and 13th Companies Sappers and Miners detailed for ondgmg operations from 20th instant onwards and during the advance. I he 92nd Punjabis rejoined the 7th Division, whilst the 23rd Mountain attery crossed from right bank into Corps Troops Area on left bank.j6 24th March.—Dwnng the day, the 3rd Divisional artillery on the right bank and the Corps artillery on the left succeeded in partially destroying the bunds which the Turks had built in rear of the Hannah position to keep out the water. Orders were issued for fire to be kept up at night on spots where the enemy might try to repair the gaps and everything possible was done to cause the enemy as much annoyance as possible. Owing to the rise in the river the right flank of the 3rd Division was flooded out and, in spite of considerable labour in endeavouring to keep water out with bunds, had to be withdrawn to the line of the Thorny Nullah. Mason's Mounds however was retained. The 66th Brigade, R. F. A. (less two sections) was ordered to move from Sheikh Saad to Wadi, and the 61st Howitzer Battery was ordered from the left bank to go into action on the right bank. While this work was in progress, careful attention was paid to improving the efficiency of our transport ; the land transport had been augmented by recent arrivals ; the 3rd and 7th Divisions and the Corps Troops were completed with their first line pack mules, and second line obligatory^ while the supply column and remainder of second line requirements, including tentage, were carried in ■make las. These mahelns were all organised under their own headmen and the crews, etc., placed directly under the orders of the Brigade Supply Officers, who were made responsible for their pay and rations, and who, moreover, had them at their disposal for loading and unloading of supplies, thus saving the troops what would otherwise have been very heavy fatigue work. 25th March. —The bund between Orah and Sheikh Saad broke during the day, flooding the country on the right bank and making it impassable for artillery. In consequence the move of 66th Brigade, R. F. A., from Sheikh Saad had to be postponed. On the right bank a one-pr. Vickers Q. F. gun was pushed up into the trenches to open on the enemy's machine guns, with good results. As the right of the 3rd Division was now flooded and could make no further progress, the left of the division was ordered to push forward ; work with this object in view was commenced after dark. On the following day efforts were made to drain the water in front of Thorny Nullah into the Umm-el-Brahm so as to gain some control over the floods which threatened to check any further advance on the right bank. These efforts were only partially successful. On the same day a double company of the 64th Pioneers was sent to Sheikh Saad to commence work for a light railway at that place, and to super vise the work on and the maintenance of the river bunds. 28th March. —During the day the 3rd Division sent a section of field artil lery to Sodom on the left bank ; as our sapheads were now within 150 yards of the enemy's trenches at Hannah, the 28th and 35th Brigade machine guns were ordered to move, under cover of darkness, into position on the right bank at the sandhills so as to deal with any attempt of the enemy to attack the 7th Division sap heads, and also preparatory to co-operating in the forthcoming attack on the Hannah position. Preliminary instructions as to the move of the 13th Division from Sheikh Saad to Wadi Camp right bank and thence into trenches on left bank in relief of the 7th Division were issued. The first 6o-pounder battery arrived at Wadi during the day and was got into position and registered as soon as possible. Excellent work was at this time being done by our aeroplanes ; we were able to definitely allot certain'machines and observers for artillery observation in addir tion to those employed in reconnaissance. The work done by both was of the highest order, enemy guns were accurately located and silenced, while excellent photos of the enemy positions were obtained. ' 2gtk March.—Ihz remainder of the 64th Pioneers (less one double com pany at Filaifillah) were ordered to proceed to Sheikh Saad and to take over the post at Gomorrah en route. Instructions were given to the Officer Commanding .to make a landing place at Sheikh Saad for light railway material, to ascertain the'3 * *7 best alignment for a light railway from Sheikh Saad along the Kut road, and to arrange for its construction. Blockhouses were ordered be built 500 to 800 yards a part. Also a report was to be made on the best way of controlling the water supply in the Sweet Water Canal. Meantime owing to the various delays en route the transport train of the 13th Division had not arrived ; the lack of this transport as well as ambulances, water carts, etc., and ammunition columns marching with it was badly felt. The 13th Division had only first line pack mules ; no mahelas were available to sup plement this, but some barges were allotted to carry their supplies, etc. Orders were issued for the following moves :— (a) 35th Brigade to take over Wadi Camp left bank from 36th Brigade on the 30th. (d) 36th Brigade then to take over Wadi Camp right bank. (c) Cavalry brigade to Sheikh Saad on the 30th. On arrival there the G. O. C. was to push out a protective screen from the Umm«el- Brahm to the south of Sheikh Saad, and to take all possible pre cautions to prevent leakage of information from Sheikh Saad. This duty was carried out by Brigadier-General R. C. Stephen and all under his command with marked thoroughness; and throughout the operations the cavalry brigade, to whom I entrusted the protection of my left flank and rear, carried out these duties in a most praise worthy manner. (^) 40th Brigade to move from Sheikh Saad to Wadi on night 31st March- 1st April. {e) 38th and 40th Brigades to take over the Hannah trenches from .7th Division on night of ist-2nd April and 39th Brigade to move from Sheikh Saad to Wadi the same night. (f) 39th Brigade to move up into position in the trenches on the night Qnd-3rd April. Preparations were made to store 30,000 grenades in the trenches on the left bank for the use of the T3th Division ; the artillery were ordered to commence cutting the wire in front of the Hannah position on the 30th. March jotk. —During the day and during the night 30^-31 st March the artillery continued getting into position for the forthcoming operations, and moves ordered on the 29th were carried out. The wire cutting by the artillery was fairly successful, but another two hours' firing was found to be necessary on the 31st. The 72nd Field Company arrived and joined the 13th Division. March 31st. —Artillery continued getting into position on the 31st. 1st April igi6. —During the night 31st March—1st April it rained heavily ; the 40th Brigade moved up from Sheikh Saad to Wadi right bank and experienced much difficulty owing to the mud ; one section of 66th Brigade, R. F. A., was left at Sheikh Saad for defensive purposes. The bridge was partially dismantled during night on account of storm and was not open to traffic till 3 P.M. Headquarters 13th Division arrived from Sheikh Saad and moved up into Meerut trench getting there about 3 P.M. Heavy rain fell throughout the - vf . . N .. day, wireless communication was uncertain, and the land line interrupted between Amarah and Basrah. In consequence of rain the following moves had to be postponed 24 hours r— (1) 38th and 40th Brigades from Wadi right bank into trenches left bank. (2) 39th Brigade from Sheikh Saad to Wadi Camp right bank. C237GSB18 2nd April The rain and floods necessitated the withdrawal of part of the 3rd Division from their advanced position back to Thorny Nullah. The 13th Division moved up the 38th and 40th Brigades after dark to the trenches on the left bank, and took over the firing line by 8-30 P.M. During night ist*2nd April the 39^ Brigade and one section of 66th Brigade R. F. A. moved up from Sheikh Saad to Wadi Camp right bank, all brigades of the 13th Division having experienced considerable difficulty on the march owing to mud. The relief of the 7th Division (19th and 21st Brigades) by the 13th Division (38th and 40th Brigades) in the advanced trenches was completed by 2 -15 A.M. on the 3rd. During the night 2nd-3rd April 39th Brigade moved up from right bank camp into trenches on the left bank. During the night 3rd-4th the 13th Division completed the relief of the 7th Division in the front line of trenches, the 7th Division being withdrawn and taking up its position in rear of the 13^ Division so as to support its advance if necessary. Throughout the 4th precautions were taken to prevent the enemy discovering that a British division was in the trenches opposite them, Indian ranks being retained in the advanced trenches, while the tents of the 13th Division were kept pitched at Sheikh Saad. April ^/t.—The Corps artillery was all in position by 12 noon. All artillery were warned to carry their percentage of rifles and S. A. A. and to be prepared to protect themselves against predatory Arabs who might pass round our flanks by night. Registration continued throughout the day. At 6 P.M. Corps Headquarters moved up to Divisional Creek on the left bank. The attached map (Map No. 7) gives the positions occupied by all parts o^ the force at 10 P.M. on the 4th. AD endix H 0n this (iate we hacl with US leSS than five cia ^ S ' su PP lies ' the onward d . es ' n ,r * patch of reinforcements and ammunition had to be given precedence over supplies, and it was hoped that, once these reinforcements had reached Corps Head quarters, the steamers would be able easily to maintain our supplies and in addition accumulate a reserve; as a matter of fact the contrary was the result. Map No. 8. April $th. —Operations commenced at 4-55 A.M. when the 13th Division, who had the leading battalions of all three brigades in the front line with remain ing battalions in close support, noiselessly jumped out of the front trenches and rushed the enemy's first and second lines in quick succession, in spite of stout opposition. At 4-58 A.M. the supporting artillery and machine guns opened on enemy's third line and other prearranged targets behind it. The enemy's third line was captured by 6 A.M. and consolidated. The 13th Division continued to press forward, and by 7 A.M. the enemy's fourth and fifth lines had been cleared. Meanwhile aeroplane reconnaissance reported that the enemy were reinforcing Saunaiyat and Falahiyah positions. The greatest credit is due to Major-General Maude and all under his command for the brilliant success of this assault. Every detail had been most thoroughly gone into by him and his brigade commanders—the assault was accurately timed, and organised with great thoroughness. The close and effective support by the artillery on both banks and by the machine gun batteries on the right bank also greatly contributed to the success being gained with such relatively small loss. At 11 A.M. I went forward to ascertain personally the state of affairs with the advanced troops of the 13th Division,—who were preparing to assault the enemy's trenches at Falahiyah. These could only be approached over very open ground devoid of any cover, while the marsh and river prevented any attempts at turning them, and at 12-15 P.M., I directed the attack to be postponed until evening in order to rest and reorganise the brigades after their successful and gallant assault of a network of trenches, extending over 16,000 yards in depth,*9 and for further reconnaissance of the trenches still in front of them. Their casualties during this operation had only been about 500 up to 11-0 a.m. Meanwhile on the right bank the advanced troops of the 8th Brigadei watching their opportunity, and led by the Manchesters, captured the enemy's position at and to the south of Abu Roman Mounds at about 11-30 a.m. At 3-45 p.m. the enemy on the right bank developed a strong counter-attack with about 3,500 infantry, two batteries and their cavalry brigade. This counter attack was skilfully repulsed and General Keary consolidated the position cap tured from Abu Roman southwards. On the left bank the wounded were collected and sent back to Wadi and all steps were taken to clear the captured trenches of a large quantity of arms and ammunition left by the enemy, to prevent it falling into Arab hands. Colonel Tate, R.A.M.C., was placed in charge of the collecting station and evacuation from the same to Wadi Camp, where Lieutenant-Colonel Irvine supervised the arrangements for the reception and evacuation of the wounded down stream. Both these officers deserve great credit for the excellent results achieved. During the day the river rose rapidly, and another considerable flood was evidently coming down. I determined to make every effort to capture the Falahiyah and the Sannaiyat positions before the rising river enabled the Turks to open the bunds between us, and so make any further progress on the left bank by us impossible. At P ; M * a heavy bombardment was directed on enemy's trenches MapNo^S. north of Falahiyah bend. At 7-30 p.m. 13th Division advanced to the attack and assaulted and captured a series of deep trenches in several lines. The posi tion was stubbornly held by about three battalions many of whom fled, throwing away their arms, and escaped under cover of darkness along the communication trenches. In these operations the 38th Brigade, and the Warwicks and Worcesters of the 3gth Brigade, were particularly noticeable. The position captured was consolidated and taken over at 9-30 p.m. by 7th Division which had been brought up during the afternoon and warned to be in readiness to follow up a successful attack on the Falahiyah position with an assault on the Sannaiyat position at dawn. The 13th Division were withdrawn to bivouac during the night. The highest praise is due to Major-General Maude and his brigade com manders and all under their command for this successful night attack, a difficult operation, at all times requiring great dash and good leadership, as well as personal bravery among the junior commissioned and the non-commissioned ranks. Casualties this day were 1,868 killed, wounded and missing. April 6th. —At 1 a.m. on April 6th the 7th Division commenced to advance against the left of the enemy's Sannaiyat position with their left on the enemy's . communication trench. They had in all some two miles to cover before reaching the enemy's trenches. I directed Major-General Sir G. Younghusband to attack the enemy's left at dawn keeping his left on their communication trench which led from Falahiyah to Sannaiyat. At 4-10 a.m. the 7th Division deployed for attack with 21st Brigade in reserve. Meanwhile the scouts had pushed right forward up to the enemy's trenches. Previous reconnaissance by daylight was not possible as the ground was still held by the enemy. The advance was much hampered in crossing the deep enemy's trenches, which branched out from the communicating trench. The time taken to cover the intervening ground proved, owing to difficulties which could not be foreseen, to have been under-estimated and the assault thouga ordered to take place at dawn was not actually delivered until somewhat later. This delay was fatal to our chances of success as the ground was very open and quite devoid of cover. At 5 a.m. the two leading brigades deployed into attack formation some 5 ,300 yards from the enemy's Sannaiyat position.20 At 5-35 A.M. the advance was checked by heavy artillery and machine gun fire some 700 yards from the enemy's position. The leading brigades advanced with the greatest gallantry and dash unti^ checked, when the leading lines fell back to the 3rd line about 1,000 yards from the position, with one brigade in reserve 2,500 yards from the same. Here they dug themselves in. At 5-50 A.M. when the light permitted of observation, our right bank artil lery and at 5-55 A.M. our left bank artillery opened a heavy fire on the enemy's position thus enabling the 7th Division to consolidate their position, and by 7-30 A.M. the enemy's fire slackened appreciably, as our troops gained cover and replied. Afp«n()is K. Throughout the night and during the morning the river had been rising steadily, until at midday it passed the highest flood level of this year. Casualties this day were 1,168. The wind changed to north-west and blew the water of the Suwaikieh Marsh rapidly towards the position occupied by the right of the 7th Division. Orders were accordingly issued to erect protective bunds both along the Tigris and Suwaikieh Marsh. This work had to be carried out under fire, and indeed for a long time our position was critical—guns were surrounded by floods and isolated in small islands of dry ground secured by banks of earth, hastily made round them by their gunners. At 1 P.M. the advanced troops of the 7th Division on the right were forced to withdraw by the water, which also appeared to give the enemy considerable trouble on the left of their position. The marsh continued to encroach and at 2-40 P.M. it was found necessary to cancel the order for the attack to be renewed that night : all efforts were devoted to keeping free from water the positions already gained. Our artillery registered on the enemy's positions during the day with a view to further operations, and to prevent the enemy from keeping his trenches clear of water. Arrangements were made for the 3rd Division to push forward one brigade along the right bank to seize and entrench a position from which our artillery and machine guns could enfilade the enemy's position on the left bank the next day. The 7th Division established as forward a line as possible from the Suwaikieh Marsh to the river, while a detachment of 13th Division was pushed forward along the left bank to opposite Abu Roman Mounds. During the night approaches to the Enemy's position were reconnoitred. m*p 6, '^ e 3 r&lt; ^ Division on the right bank pushed forward the right of their line and established the same on the Tigris so as to include 18. a. 6/8 from which machine gun enfilade fire could be brought to bear on Sannaiyat. W ind and flood made it impossible to throw a bridge across the river, but all transport mahelas were brought as far upstream as possible without coming within range of the enemy's guns. April 'jfh. At A . m . the 7th Division under cover of artillery fire from both banks pushed forward and established an entrenched line southwards from the Suwaikieh Marsh to the river varying from 1,000 to boo yards from the Sannaiyat position. During this movement the enemy's machine guns were very active the 7th Division suffered numerous casualties but good work was done. It was evident that another attack over so broad and open an expanse pro' mised little chance of success, even at night, unless the assaulting force could be assembled under cover within assaulting distance ; arrangements were made to push forward the line the following night. The enerrn moreover having beaten off our attack on the morning of the 6th instant had naturally recovered their morale, which our successful assaults at Hannah and Falahiyah had, it was hoped, considerably affected.rr 21 Artillery registered on the enemy's position, bombarding and cutting wire, especially in the vicinity of a redoubt at T. C. 21. 18 a 69/60 (Map No. 10). All day the advanced troops of 3rd Division in the forward position on the right bank kept up an intermittent machine gun fire across the Tigris on the enemy's front line in Sannaiyat position left bank. Aeroplanes reported that the enemy were holding Sannaiyat strongly—this tvas confirmed by observation and fire from enemy's trenches. At 9 p.m. the enemy was alarmed by our sending up a rocket and by a short bombardment. They at once opened heavy fire with artillery, musketry and machine guns and fired several Very lights, with which they appeared to be well provided along their trenches, disclosing the fact that the bulk of their machine guns were on their left, which appeared to be very strongly held. All night intermittent machine gun fire was kept on enemy's trenches from right bank. During the night of the yth-Sth the 7th Division advanced under cover of darkness and dug in 200 yards nearer the enemy. The construction of the bridge at 8 c 3/7 progressed satisfactorily. Map No. 6. April 8th. —The bridge over the Tigris was finished and ready for wheeled traffic at \ 1 a.m. Excellent work had been done by Lieutenant-Colonel E. C. Ogllvie, R.E., and the 12th and 13th Companies, Sappers and Miners under Captain S. Pemberton, R.E., and Captain E. Bradney, R.E., respectively. In spite of strong winds and surging current the bridge had been successfully towed into position and completed without the loss of a single man or pontoon in 25 hours. The day passed in registration, wire cutting, and other preparations for an assault of the Sannaiyat position at dawn next day. These were completed by evening. I selected the 13th Division for this assault. No considerable movement of the enemy was seen by aeroplane. The floods east of Abu Roman Mounds now caused me considerable anxiety. They had reached to the south-east corner of 18 D and joining up with the Umm -el«Brahm seriously threatened the communications of the 3rd Division on right bank. No land transport was able to reach the troops up stream of Mason's Mounds so arrangements were made for a steamer and barge to take up supplies after dark, and, although the landing place was within easy range of the enemy's guns, this was apparently not detected by them. After dark the 13th Division replaced the 7th Division in front of the section of enemy's trenches selected for their assault, while the 7th Division were withdrawn to the right flank of 13th Division in readiness to support the 13th Division with their artillery and machine guns in action. The Corps artillery and the machine guns of the 8th Brigade on the right bank were detailed to support the attack by fire on all other portions of the enemy's trenches and communication trenches. April gth. —On the 9th April the 13th Division advanced to the assault at 4-20 a.m. Some nine minutes after they had moved forward, and when they were within some 300 yards of the enemy's front line the enemy discovered the move ment ; Very's lights were sent up, flares were lighted and a heavy musketry and shrapnel fire was opened. The first lines of the division, moving with great dash, penetrated into the centre of the enemy's front line trench, notably detach ments of 6th King's Own Royal Lanes., 8th Welsh Fusiliers, 6th North Lanes, and 5th Wilts. They did not lose heavily In doing so. In the glare of the Very lights the second line lost direction, wavered and fell back on the third and fourth lines ; thus proper support to the first line failed to reach it at the critical moment, in spite of most gallant and energetic attempts of the officers concerned to remedy matters. 1 he troops who had got into the enemy's trenches were then very heavily counter-attacked by superior numbers of the enemy, and in spite of most gallant efforts had to withdraw. The ground, gained before our advance was discovered, was secured, and the brigades dug themselves in on the left within 300 yards of the enemy's line and on the right about 500 yards. C237GSB22 These positions were, as far as possible, consolidated though under heavy fire. Some small detachments held shallow depressions and trenches from which they could neither advance nor retire; these could not be withdrawn till dark. The enemy frequently attempted to shell us out of the positions occupied but were successfully countered by our supporting guns and machine guns. Our aeroplanes reported little movement of enemy after the action. The evacuation of the wounded proceeded as far as possible during the day, such asjwere lying between our lines and the enemy's were collected during the night. Floods on right bank again broke the bunds near Abu Roman and the innundation extended up to the Umm-el-Brahm. Our position in front of the enemy was then organised as follows. On the left bank the 40th Brigade was allotted from the ligris to point 600 yards north of it, thence the line was allotted to two brigades of the 7th Division. The remain ing troops except artillery, which remained in position, were withdrawn to camps. At night, work was again commenced in advancing our trenches 150 yards agafrist Sannaiyat and progressed favourably until water from the Suwaikieh and from the ligris encroached, and work had to be temporarily suspended while the encroachment was stopped. The Sannaiyat position was, in my opinion, the key to our further operations —the capture of it would have given us freedom of manoeuvre on the left bank, and thus have caused the enemy to divide and separate his forces widely on both banks with their bridge 20 miles distant at Shumran, whilst we, with our bridge much more conveniently situated, could have concentrated for cur final blow at the point selected for our final assault and attempt to break through the enemy 's last line of entrenchments between us and Kut. % The Army Commander and staff arrived from Wadi in the afternoon of 9th April. He was anxious that an attempt should be made against the Sinn Aftar Redoubt, and that delay, which further preparations for another attack on the Sannaiyat position by pushing forward approaches to a closer distance would necessitate, should be avoided. I therefore made preparations for an advance in accordance with his instructions. Such an advance however, as previously Appendix H. described, necessitated the control of river bunds which would, if broken, let in the flood over our line of communication. Any collection of supplies in advance was out of the question ; we had barely three days' with us at this date. April 10th. —On 10th April, on the right bank, 3rd Division was employed in repairing the bund between Abu Roman and Mason's Mounds, and in establishing communication across the inundation from the break between those places which now stretched almost to the Umm-el-Brahm. Artillery registered and reconnoitred and were busy with counter battery work. Enemy were very quiet. The state of our supplies at this time was causing great anxiety; we had with us, on that date, less than two days' supplies, so that any formation of a depot from which our advanced troops could draw was out of the question. April 1 ith. —On nth April 35th Brigade crossed the river and moved to Twin Canals to cover the left flank and rear of the 3rd Division, who were Map No. 10. directed to attack the enemy's position in front of Beit Aieesa on the 12th. The 7th Division took over our whole line in front of Sannaiyat which had advanced 150 yards. Work on this was continued during night I ith-i2th and communication trenches added to. The 13th Division concentrated back to Falahiyah camp with one brigade in readiness to cross over early on the 12th in support of 3rd Division. As the 13th Division had only first line transport, the 7th Division were directed to hand over the second line land transport and some mahelas to the 3th Division ; this however made the 7th Division immobile.2 3 The enemy was quiet throughout the day, but fired some shells at monitors and bridge, which fell short. They also fired three shells from a suspected 4' howitzer from T. C. 18-7 C 6/6 (Map No. 6). The enemy ; s snipers on the right of their position at Sannaiyat were silenced by our machine gun fire. Aeroplanes reported from 1 ,500 to 2,000 men immediately east of Shumran, no signs of increase at Shumran, otherwise no considerable movement. The enem)' are in the habit of remaining still when our aeroplanes are heard. In consequence observers from aeroplanes are usually unable to report whether the enemy's trenches, which are very deep and well traversed and full of shadow, are held or not. The inundation immediately east of Abu Roman dried a good deal, but the G. O. C., 3rd Division, reported that water between Beit Aieesa and Abu Roman had increased rather than otherwise, and that the enemy were evidently widening the bund to increase the flow of water. I decided to endeavour to obtain com mand of these bunds. April 12th. — Throughout the 12th April the ground continued to dry satis factorily though the weather was threatening. At 4-30 p.m. the 59th Rifles occupied the enemy's piquet line T. C. 21, 18 C 4/0 to 18 C 5/;. Operations MapNo - by 3rd Division proceeded against the enemy trenches in front of Beit Aieesa T. Map No C. 18, 18 C. In the afternoon the 3rd Division advanced against enemy's forward line, which was located from 18 C 3/0 to 18 C 4/6 with an occupied trench in vicinity of 18 C 2/0 through 29 A 2/0, 29 A 0/2. The advance was much hampered by having to cross belts of inundation traversed by deep cuts which cover the area enclosed by points 18 C 3/0, 18 C 3/6, 18 C 6 /8, 29 Central to the Umm-el-Brahm varying from 500 to 1 ,600 yards wide. The advance was stoutly resisted, but the 8th, 37th and 7th Brigades, in order from right, with 9th Brigade in reserve occupied the line 18 C 2/1, 18 C 5/8, 29 A 3 /5, 29 A 5/7 with advance piquets in close proximity to enemy's line. Our communications on the right bank between our advanced troops and Falahiyah wefe seriously hampered by floods, and to prevent them being entirely cut off, road making on a large scale and at high pressure had to be'resorted to—the Pioneers and Field Companies of the 13th Division and the 36th Brigade being continuously employed for some days under the direction of Lieutenant- Colonel C. Coffin, R.E., who now officiated as my Chief Engineer, and who rendered*me very valuable service. During the night I2th-i3th, this line was consolidated and reconnaissances were conducted to discover feasible routes for guns leading into square 20 without however finding any road practicable for wheels, owing to the Turks at Beit Aieesa having opened bunds which flooded that vicinity, and which resulted in floods from Beit Aieesa again joining the Abu Roman inundation. It therefore became necessary to capture the enemy's position at Beit Aieesa in order to control the bunds as far as Chahela. The road at (T. C. 18) 18 B 8/7 alono- Map No. which all transport had to move had been so cut up by guns and transport tha^ heavy repairs to maintain the road kept all technical troops of 3rd and 17th Map No * Divisions fully employed during the 13th. Our situation on the right bank this night was most critical, the strong wind acting on the flooded state of the river caused considerable damage to the bunds and we were unable to control the floods which had by now assumed lar^e dimensions. 5 • * On the left bank a sudden gale from north-west during night 13th-14th caused t e uwaikieh Marsh to flood the northern end of the enemy's trenches and our own. i he enemy suffered considerable loss when taking up positions on their parados to which they had to retire from their trenches. Work on pumping out and securing our Sannaiyat trenches was put in hand ; but progress in pushin* forward our approaches was again hampered by water. ^24 The 38th Brigade, 13th Division, moved by night to Abu Roman in support of 3rd Division and the 36th Brigade moved from Wadi to Headquarters Camp near 19 A 3-1. The G. O. C., 3rd Division, reconnoitred with a view to operating against trench 18 C. 2/0. to 29 A 2/0. 7th Division arranged at 9 a.m. to endeavour to draw the enemy's fire from his position on the left bank by artillery bombardment and feint. Little hostile rifle fire resulted, and the impression gained was that enemy's front line, at any rate, was lightly held. This corroborated aeroplane reports. They had ap parently thrown forward an advanced line and depended on this and flares to give them early warning of attack. Sapping by the technical troops of the 7th Division began on the night of the 13th-14th. The 3rd Division reconnaissances of enemy's forward line in vicinity of 18 C 0/8 during night 13th-14th April indicated that it was strongly held. Owing to floods, and the vigilance of the enemy, the reconnoitring parties gained little information in this area, but the 7^ Brigade ascertained that the enemy's trenches at 29 A 4/4, and running thence in a southerly direction, were unoccupied. April 14th. —On 14th April the 128th Pioneers were pushed forward, and occupied the northern portion of these latter trenches. The day was spent in registering guns on various targets, as far as possible, but as aeroplanes, owing to heavy gale, were unable to fly all day, registration could not be completed. Arrangement^ were made to assault the portion of the enemy's trenches in vicinity of 18 C 0/8, T. C. 21, on-the 15th with two brigades. The remaining two brigades of 3rd Division were to remain in their positions between 18 C. 4/6 and the Tigris. The 36th Brigade and 13th Division were placed in reserve, one brigade of latter about 18 C 5/9. Work on our trenches progressed throughout the day. Reconnaissance of the flooded area to south-east of square 18 D., T.C. 21, showed that with little work a passage through it in this vicinity could be made practicable for all arms. Work on the improvement of the road at 18 B. 8/7, T. C. 21, was carried on with a view to completing two causeways at this point. On the left bank sapping continued, and, owing to a south ^wind, the marsh water receded about 1,200 yards. April 15th. —On 15th April the 3rd Division captured the enemy's trenches at 18 C. 0/6 to 18 C. 0/9 at dawn, taking thirty prisoners and suffering slight loss. The Turks appear to have suffered considerably. During the morning they attempted a small counter-attack against the right of the trench we had cap tured, which was easily repulsed. In the afternoon the 8th Brigade on 3rd Division's right, rushed the enemy's piquet line about 800 yards in front of our then main line, taking several more prisoners. The trench running north-west from the rear of the Sannaiyat position left bank was reported during the afternoon to be full of me^n. The artillery on both banks immediately opened on them with good effect, this was answered by Turkish guns on the left bank. Large working parties were employed all day working on the road between Abu Roman and Mason's Mounds. Steps were taken to ferry guns at night by river between these two places, and to send all supplies and ammunition to Abu Roman by water. At 8-30 p.m. the enemy attacked the right of the 3rd Division piquet line, but the attack did not materialise. The line 18 C 1/1, 18 C 1/4, 18 C 0/55 thenre south and south-east was successfully consolidated by the 3rd Division during the night and guns were moved forward.2 5 April 16th. —'On the morning of the i6 l h the 47tli Sikhs on the extreme right of our line took a small enemy's post 250 yards in front of them thus giving us control of river bunds as far as this point ; between this point and the left of the enemy's line a deep morass was discovered. Preparations were made to attack the Beit Aieesa position next day, after an intense artillery bombardment, which was to start as soon as it was light enough to observe. The 39th Brigade was ordered to relieve the 8th Brigade on 3rd Division right flank during night 16th-17th ; the 38th Brigade to remain on 3rd Division's left rear in reserve to protect that flank ; the 40th Brigade to move to Abu Roman Mounds on morning of 17th. On the left bank, the 7th Division established several short lengths of trench 50 yards in front of their front line. The river had again started to rise rapidly. The causeway between Masons' and Abu Roman Mounds was not yet fit for wheeled traffic. The 7th Division made some progress in their trenches during night i6ih 17th. April Artillery bombardment started at 6-45 a.m. and lasted twenty- five minutes; under cover of this, the 7th and 9th Brigades advanced with grea- dash at 6-45 a .m. and actually reached the enemy's trenches before artillery fire lifted. Thus did the 3rd Division gain the advanced Beit Aieesa trenches with comparatively little loss under cover of artillery bombardment ; they bayonetted considerable numbers of the enemy in their trenches, who were waiting for the bombardment to cease. They then established themselves approximately on the line T.C. 32, 17 D 3/1, to 17 D, 9/9, which they were ordered to con- ^ ^ ^ solidate. All these operations by the 3rd Division reflect the greatest credit onMajor- Generel H. D'U. Keary and all under his command ; steady and consistent pro gress was day after day made, in spite of most difficult conditions, and often too a shortage of rations, which their transport was heavily strained to bring forward. The co-operation by the artillery throughout has been close and effective and was especially good on this occasion. Between 8 and 10 a .m. various movements of enemy's troops from south and south-west were reported which indicated that a counter-attack from those directions was contemplated, but nothing materialized during the afternoon. In. this smartly carried out action the enemy left 200 to 300 dead in their trenches and the 3rd Division captured some 180 prisoners including 8 officers. At 1 2-0 noon orders were issued for the 13th Division to take over the line occupied by the 7th, 8th and 9th Brigades, as already described, after dusk. The 3rd Division were then to concentrate behind and to the left rear of the 13th Division, with a brigade and a battery of artillery in vicinity of T. C. 18, 29 C 4/0. My intention was to continue the attack on the enemy's Chahela trenches Map No ^ in square 17 D, T. C. 32, from C. 1 to C. 15 on the following day. The 13th Division supported by all artillery on right bank, less 3rd Divisional Artillery were to undertake this. After noon mutual arrangements were made by the 3rd and 13th Divisions for the carrying out of the reliefs and this is stated to have to some extent delayed the consolidation of the position which had been ordered. At 3-0 p .m. Lieutenant Kemp with a party of the i -9th Gurkha Rifles dis* covered and captured twenty prisoners and two guns which the enemy, in his retreat, had left behind about 300 yards in front of our advanced line. As the guns could not be removed by day a double company was entrenched to protect them. At 5 o p.m. the Turks commenced to bombard the 7th, 8th and 9th Brigades and also to establish a barrage at the Narrows 18 C 3/5. They also shelled Rhodes piquet where 38th Brigade was bivouacked. C237GSB26 Map No. il. Map Ko. %U Map No. if. Soon afier 6 P.M. before the relief of the 3rd Division by the 13th h^d begun, the enemy launched a very strong counter-attack against the 3rd Division forward line from the south-west, directed in the first instance along the general line of the trench running from C. 13 to A. 4 (T.C. 32). The supporting artillery opened rapid fire and did good execution, but in spite of the same the attack was pressed home. The 9th Brigade was in the first instance rushed and gave ground. This was due to their having, in pushing forward to seize the guns, thrown their left dan gerously toward. Gallant as it was, it should have been controlled by the brigade commander. By the time the report of the same reached Divisional Headquarters it was too late in the day for the general direction of the line to be straightened out under divisional arrangements ; the omission to do this was fatal. When the 9th Brigade gave way the left of the 7th Brigade became exposed and was similarly forced back. The men however rallied on the 8th Brigade and that portion of the 7th Brigade which under its brigade commander, Major-General Egerton, held its ground in the face of heavy odds, the brigade commander and his staff more than holding their own with bombs. Reinforcements of the 38th, 39^ an ^ 4°^ Brigades of the 13^ Division, which were ordered forward at 8-30 P.M. in support, were much delayed in making their way at night over ground, which was boggy in places, and did not arrive till 10 -30 P.M. in the case of the 3^^ Brigade and 2-3 0 A.M. in cases of the other brigades. At 11 -45 P.M. I ordered up the 3^^ Brigade from Corps Reserve to Mason's Mounds. The attack which commenced at 6-0 P.M. was followed by a series of heavy attacks throughout the night, each of which was directed more from the south as time went on and against our left flank. The 8ih Brigade on the left had as many as six violent attacks made against them during the night, some of which came within twenty yards of their position. Units and brigades became much mixed up ; but the line held firm, and the enemy retreated at dawn having suffered losses estimated at 4,000 to 5 000 men. In this engagement the following regi ments particularly distinguished themselves by their steadiness and gallantry : Connaughts, 27th Punjabis, 89th Punjabis of the 7th Brigade, 47th Sikhs, 59th Rifles of the Mh Brigade. The South Lanes, and East Lanes, were particularly conspicuous, and the Worcesters, South Wales Borderers and Wilts also did well. The 66th and 14th Batteries rendered good service, and the 23rd Mountain Battery expended all its rounds and is reported to have done great damage to the enemy by enfilade fire at close range. During the night of the I7th-i8th on the left bank, the three southerly saps of the 7th Division ran into water and work had to be discontinued. Progress was however made on five other saps. dpril 78th~On the right bank, the line occupied by us at dawn on 18th April, when fighting had practically ceased, was approximately as follows :—Right section (T. C. 32) A 1 to A 3 thence to point 1 50 yards short of A 4. Lefc section from Twin Pimples in a south-east direction to f8 C 2-10 from where a line of piquets extended further south-east to vicinity of 29 Central. Turks were then still in occupation of the western end of trench running from Twin Pimples to A 4 and also from A 4 in a north east direction for 150 yards. These were however bombed out and our line from Twin Pimples through A 4 to A 1 was made continuous. The 13th Division took over the area running from the Tigris to T. C. 32, 17 d 92-8 from the 3rd Division on morning of 18th, with orders to relieve 3rd Division, and to consolidate as far forward as possible preparatory to attack ng the Chahela trenches as a subsequent operation. The &lt;ird Division on relief were to concentrate so as to protect the Mt and left rear of the 13th Division ; the 36th Brigade were temporarily placed at the disposal of the G. O. C M 3rd Division, until this concentration should be com pleted. During the night i8th-i9lh the enemy brought up some form of trench mortar, and the toopsof the 13*^ Division fell back from A 4, and the enemy■iMMlMMHMi 27 / occupied 150 yards of trench north -east towards A 3i ar 'd south east towards Twi* Pimples. On the left bank, aeroplanes had for some time past failed to observe any movement, and although Sannaiyat still appeared to be held, indications of with drawal, though not well confirmed, had been observed, also of carrying from the left to the right bank. 1 now decided that the opportunity was favourable to make on e more attempt to capture the Sannaiyat position, and the 7th Division were directed to prepare for an assault on the 20th, in which assault they would be supported by the 35th and 36th Brigades, which could be moved over to the left bank after dark. Atril 19th. —At 7-10 A.M. on 19th, on the right bank after twenty-five minutes Map No „ bombardment of line A 16 to A 1 2, the 39th Brigade on the left of the 13th Division pressed forward to take this line. The boggy nature of the ground pre vented their getting through and they eventually fell back to line A 1 to A 3 again. The 13th Division managed however to push forward its left during the day. It was intended to recapture the point A 4 at 3-30 p.m. It was found that the trench there was shallow and full of water ; the dust storm that had blown throughout the day made the observation of howitzer fire difficult ; the approaches to this trench were flanked by severe hostile machine gun fire from line A 5 to A 6. It was therefore decided to postpone this operation; the line then held was MapNo lI consolidated from A 1—A 3 to point 150 yards short of A 4, thence to 150 yards south-east cf A 4 and onto ^ d 95/ 8 - The 1 ^th Division were directed to enfilade line A 16 to A 12 with machine mm fire and when the machine guns were in position, to bombard the area with howitzers and shoot down the enemy with shrapnel if they bolted. Further attempts to progress on the right bank had to be suspended; the ^rd Division were much shaken by their experiences on the night 17th- 18th instant and had to be placed in reserve. On the left bank a reconnaissance sent out during the night of the i8ih- iqth discovered that the ground for 300 yards on each side of No. 2 sap had dried • ' t n P M however the wind veered round to the north aim the mai^h again flooded' the trenches. The assault intended for the 20th had therefore to be postponed. April20th.—On the morning o{ the 20th the 13th Division were still endea- M , ip lt vouring to get possession of A 4 [T. C. 32) and to gain ground. The Sannaiyat position was bombarded at the time intended for a future assault, and during the night of zoth-aist April the position was again recon noitred The reconnaissance reached within 100 yards o! the posuion and ascer tained that the front line was held, the flanks being in strength with machine guns. The t7th Brigade moved to Twin Canals and it was hoped that the road from this place to the south-west would be open by the night of tne 21st if weather continued favourable. The 35th Brigade were ordered to move to Corps Headquarters after dark. Durino the night 20th-2ist the North Staffords on the left centre of the 39lh Brigade captured A 4 and wiped out, with their machine guns, a strong m -p ^ counter-attack which the enemy subsequently launched rom the direction 0 A 1 V The Gloucesters on the left of the 39th Brigade also advanced and got as far as A 5 but had to fall back to a line running south from A 4, with some losses. April2!st.—On the aist the line occupied by the 13th Division ran as fol lows from A 1 through A 3 and A 4 to a point some 600 yards south of A 4— thence the line was bent back past the Boil to vicinity of ^92-8— t.ie 3rd Division earned the line on thence in a south-east direction. The 13th and 3rd Divisions were ordered to push forward during the night and consolk ate on the line A, 1 to A 4, thence to B point about i.coo yards m a28 south-south-easterly direction at 17 d 8/6. From this point the 3rd Division were to continue the line south-south-eastward to 29 a 2/3 and thence eastwards towards the marsh. F rom 7 to 8 A.M. the following areas on right bank were bombarded with P '' artillery and machine guns (.) A 6, A 9, C 13 and a trench running south-west from A 6—(2) 17 d 59/12, 17 d 65 /11, 17 d 60/36 and 17 d 70 /35. In add.tion systematic bombardment of enemy's position on left bank was carried out throughout the day. During night 21 st -22nd the 1 .^th Division pushed half way down between A 4 and A 5 and consolidated their position. On the left bank after a conference with the divisional and brigade com manders of the 7th Division I decided that the 7th Division supported by the Wh and Q6th Brigades should assault the Sannaiyat position on the morning of the 22nd, on a two-brigade front, which was all that the flooded state of the intervening ground would admit of, and the G. O. C. was directed to make arrangements accordingly. Alternative arrangements were made for an attack on a one-brigade front, in event of the marsh rising and restricting the ground, as it did durin' the afternoon of the 21st. A patrol during the night of the 21st found that the water had receded which would permit of a two-brigade attack but at 6 A.M. on the 22nd the G. O. C. 21st Brigade reported the ground in front ot that brigade as too boggy for attack, and the one-brigade front was adhered to. Map No. 1,1, A p rt i 22nd —As on the preceding day, slow bombardment of the enemy's position at Sannaiyat commenced at 6-20 A.M. on the 22nd and continued till 7-9 A.M. the last nine minutes being intense. Fire was then htted to form a bar rage to assist the advance of the 7th Division which was to assauit the Sannai)at position. At 7 AM, the 7th Division advanced from their trenches, 19th Brigade leading with the Norfolks and Dorsets from the 2ist Brigade on their right, 28th Brigade in support behind, the 19th Brigade and remainder of 21st Brigade in support on the right of our front line of trenches, while the 35'&gt; and 36th Brigades were in immediate reserve. c&gt; The advance was not only covered by all the Corps artillery on right bank and the 7th Division artillery on the left bank but by the machine gun batteries of the 35th, 36th. 38th Brigades and Welsh Pioneers which had been placed in position near Crofton's O. P. during the night for this purpose under the orders of Lieutenant-Colonel Dunsford, 2nd Rajputs. The 2nd Battery, R. F. A., was also pushed up near this point during the night to support the attack with direct fire. The leading columns of the 19th Brigade carried the enemy s first and second lines in their immediate front, but, with the exception of a few men, were unable to reach the enemy's third line, in attacking which they came under a heavy cross machine gun fire : they were well and closely supported by the supporting troops. While crossing the enemy's trenches, communication trenches and dug outs, which were full of mud and water, and the intervening ground between the trenches, which was very boggy, the men's rifles became choked with mud and they could only move slowly and laboriously. Large reinforcements from the enemy's rear were by this time coming up. The enemy launched a strong counter-attack from about the position Z 9—Z 10. This came under very heavy artillery and machine gun fire from right bank and was wiped out. A second counter -attack by the enemy, however, succeeded in forcing our men back, owing to their being unable to use their rifles, and our assaulting troops had to fall back before it. Our men were unable to obtain cover, in the flooded trenches to reply to the enemy's machine gun fire and were unable to consolidate29 their position. By 8 40 a.m. the 7th Division were back in their front line trenches, 21st Brigade on right, 19th Brigade in centra, 28th Brigade on left with 36th Brigade in support behind the left and 35th Brigade behind the right. At 11 -40 A .m. the Turks sent out three men with red crescent flags ; by mutual agreement fire ceased, and both sides collected their wounded who were lying in the water, etc. At 2-30 p.m. hostilities recommenced. I urkish casualties appear to have been heavy, as they were evacuating wounded till nightfall. From observation it appears that the Turks brought up in all some 5,000 men to oppose the yth Division. Our casualties were approximately 300 killed and 1,000 wounded. The troops had now been continuously fighting without respite for sixteen days, not only the Turks but also the floods, which on many occasions threatened to overwhelm them. They had responded cheerfully to every call I had made on them, and, in spite of the hardships which such prolonged operations were bound to entail'on them, they had again and again renewed the attack with the greatest determina tion. These sixteen days ficrhting had however severely effected their fighting effici ency. Our losses had exceeded 33 per cent of our strength, and this was consider ably exceeded in the case of British officers and especially was this the case in the 13th Division, on whom the effect of the recent operations was most marked. The time had come when the limit of endurance had been reached, and I asked reluctantly for an interview with the Army Commander and informed him that to call on the men for further efforts, within the time limit imposed by the food supply of Kut, could no longer give any prospect of success, and that it was necessary to face the situation and give up any further attempts to relieve Kut. The Army Commander decided however that further efforts must be made ; and directed me to arrange to continue operations in the direction of Sinn Aftar with a view to assaulting the same. During the above operations the steamer 'Julnar' had been prepared by the Royal Navy to run the blockade into Kut, in the hope that, by putting supplies into the town, General Townshend's resistance might be sufficiently 'prolonged to enable me to break through the enemy's lines. The line occupied this day by 13th and 3rd Divisions on the right bank was as follows 13th Division A 1, A 2, A 3, A 4, 1 7 d 79-50, 17 d 80-59, *7 d 74-6^, 17 d 79-80, whence the line continued in a south-easterly direction to 29 a 15-35 thence a piquet line east to the marsh. From 8 to 9 p.m. the Corps artillery, 13th and 7th Divisional artillery- carried out a short bombardment against certain areas on both banks. During the night 22nd-23rd the North Staffords bombing towards A 5 cleared about 120 yards of trench, i.e., up to about 100 yards of A 5. They were unable to make further progress owing to Turks having made trenches parallel to the main trench, both to the north and south of it. 7 he 35^ an d S^th Brigades crossed during the night from the left to the right bank and encamped near Abu Roman. ^ On left bank the 19th Brigade was withdrawn from the front line, the line being occupied on the 2^rd by the 21st Brigade on the right and 28th Brigade o.i the leit. 1 he situation on the right bank remained unchanged. Apnl 23rd. Short artillery bombardments throughout the day were earned out—chiefly directed against the enemy's third line trench C. T. S. M „ m . oannaiyat position on the left bank. ^ C237GSB3° Orders were issued for the 35th Brigade to relieve the right of 3rd Divi sion at dawn on the 24th on the line between the 13th Division left and 29 a '5/35. Ma p No 6 The 3rd Division were ordered to push forward and occupy at dawn on the 34th the south-east corner of 28 b with one brigade, while remainder of the divi- Map No. 6. s i on was in reserve in 29 a. The 36th Brigade was placed temporarily under orders of 3rd Division until relief by 35th Brigade could be carried out. April 24th. —The relief of the 8th Brigade on the left of the 13th Division by the 35th Brigade was effected by 6-10 A M. Meanwhile the 9th Brigade which had been moved to a position of as sembly about 29 a 7 /5 by 3 A.M. began to move in the direction of the junction of 28 b and 29 c at 4/30 A.M. and approached the line running approximately north-west and south-east through this point at 5-40 A.M. Here they were opposed by a good deal of fire, chiefly shrapnel. The enemy were then some 600 to 800 yards to their front, but, owing to the dust caused by the enemy's artillery, it was difficult to locate the, enemy, or rightly to make out from what direction our troops were being shelled. The G. O. C., 3rd Division, from a report received, considered that our move to the south-west was a surprise to the enemy ; apparently all guns available were turned against it by the enemy principally from the direction of Sinn Aftar redoubt. Hostile guns were also firing from the south-east corner of 28 a and also from 40 a. Map. No. 6. The enemy's Infantry which immediately opposed the 9th Brigade fell back from their forward line at about 7-30 a m. in a westerly direction, whereupon the 9th Brigade advanced to a water cut which runs approximately from 28 b 80/85 t0 2 9 c 0 Sl 00 ' enemy then occupied in strength a line running roughly north-west and south-east and parallel to the 9th Brigade front and some 1,000 yards from it. Orders were Issued for the 9th Brigade line to be consolidated and wired and redoubts to be constructed on each flank of the front line. Flanks, especi ally the left, to be refused and a series of strong posts constructed along them, The whole with the idea of enabling us to meet a possible counter-attack to the best effect. Map No. 6. The 7th Brigade was ordered to move to 29 a 15/50 and connect up with the right of the 9th Brigade and left of 35th Brigade. The 8th Brigade moved to 29 a 30/90 and prolonged the left of the 9th Brigade with a line of piquets in an easterly direction. The 36th Brigade was ordered to move to vicinity of 29 a a/3. The 21st Brigade to move to Abu Roman after dark. The cavalry brigade to move to Twin Canals with orders to remain there for the present together with the 37th Brigade. The 3rd Divisional artillery was moved further south to support their division. 1 he 8th Battery, K. F. A., and mountain battery were placed at the disposal of the 35th Brigade. The situation in front of the 13th Division was unchanged, except that the 3Sth Brigade relieved the 39th Brigade on the right of the line. On the left bank the situation was quiet—the 28th Brigade held the whole of our front line with the 19th Brigade in support. The ' Julnar,' with a crew from the Royal Navy, started at 8 p.m. with 270 tons of supplies from Abu Roman for Kut. Artillery and machine gun fire was utilized to the fullest possible extent to cover the starting of the ship. She was however discovered by the enemy, who subjected her to heavy artillery fire during her passage up the river. At 1 a.m . the 6th Division reported she had not arrived and that heavy firing had been heard at Magasis. April ^5///.—Aeroplane reconnaissance confirmed the fact that she had been captured by the enemy and was at Magasis apparently uninjured. Later inform ation is to the effect that the ' Julnar ' was stopped by a cable, which was stretched across the river ajid which fouled her screw. This of course could notWMMKM 3 1 be d iscovred by the aeroplane reconnaissance, which was carried cut previous to the attempt. The leaders of this forlorn Hope, Lieutenant H. O. B. Firman, R.N., and Commander W. C. Cowley, R.N.R., the latter of whom lias throughout operations in Mesopotamia performed magnificent service in command of the 'Mejidieh', are reported by the iurks to have been killed—the remainder of the gallant crew, including five wounded, are prisoners of war. Captain Cowley, although at first acting in a civilian capacity, has never hesitated to take his ship into dangerous situations, and his local knowledge of the Tigris and Euphrates has been of great value. This attempt to succour Kut, although unfortunately unsuccessful, is universally considered in the ligris Corps to be worthy of the finest traditions of His Majesty's Royal Navy. Situation during the night 24^25th and during 25th remained quiet and unchanged. The consolidation of our line on right bank continued throughout the 25th, and a chain of strong points was gradually established along it on the following principle:— 1st Line—a chain of strong points about 150 to 200 yards apart, each to hold 40 to 50 men. 2nd Line—100 to 150 yards in rear of 1st Line and some 600 yards apart, each to hold 60 to 80 men. 3rd Line—100 to 150 yards in rear of 2nd Line and some 750 yards apart, each to hold 60 to 80 men. 2nd and 3rd Lines to be wired, and where practicable trip wires to be erected in front of 1st Line. Machine gun emplacements to be made in all three lines. The above approximately allowed of 3,000 yards being effectively held by some 1,500 men. April 26ih —With the exception of some sniping and bombing in the M No ^ vicinity of A 4, the night 25th-26th was quiet. Enemy shelled right of 3rd ap ' Division at 7 A.M. from direction of Sinn Aftar—otherwise all was quiet on the 26th. The 13th Division reported that they had completed their part of the chain of strong points described above, but subsequent inspection disclosed that they had been badly sited and much alteration to the divisional arrangement was found necessary. The lack of training of this division when compared to the 3rd and 7th Divisions was most marked in their trench work. The 35th Brigade and 3rd Division had similar work well in hand. For the purposes of command, administration and sanitation the area occupied by the Corps was sub-divided into the following subsidiary areas :— Left Bank Area. —Under G. O. C., 7th Division. Corps Area —Under Corps Headquarters. North of line running due east Ma? No ^ from Mason's Mounds. /j/A Division Area, —Under G. O. C., 13th Division, all ground inside our front line from Tigris to the Triangle 29 a. 1/3 thence to Observation Tower 18 c 8/3. From Tower due east to Thorny Nullah and thence north to Corps Area. Twin Canals Area. —Under G. O. C. Twin Canals. Ground south of Corps Area to the east of and including Thorny Nullah thence vid the western end of causeway to the Umm-el-Brahm at junction of squares 29 b and 30 c. 3rd Division Area. —Under G. O. C., 3rd Division. All ground south of 13th Division Area and west of Twin Canals Area. Enemy's monoplane brought down one of our seaplanes, which could be seen by another plane lying upside down at the north end of Nakhailat. April27th. —Throughout the 27th the situation remained quiet and un changed. General Townshend commenced to negotiate with the Turkish Commander.&lt; 32 Consolidation of our line on right bank progressed, and during the day our artillery engaged Sannaiyat on left bank and Sinn Aftar and Chahela on right bank. The 21st Brigade was ordered to move at dawn on 28th to a position on the Thorny Nullah about (T. C. 18) 19 c 3/1 from where they could be more conveniently used to reinforce in any required direction. At 6-45 p.m. 3rd Division reported having observed at that hour a move ment of troops from north-west to south-east between the Sinn Aftar and Dujailah Redoubt. Nothing however materialised out of this reported movement, Turks opened a sudden burst of fire and used flares at 9-15 p.m. on night 27th- 28th in front of the right of 13th Division—this soon died away. April 28th. —The artillery on right bank was engaged during the day in visual registration, the 7th Divisional artillery carried out short bombardments, and kept up intermittent artillery fire against the right of the Sannaiyat position where Turks have lately been carrying out some works. April 2gth. —General Townshend surrendered to the Turkish commanders. Steady progress in consolidating our forward line on the right bank continu ed to be made. April $oth. —Situation quiet and unchanged. 2 During these operations both Air Service and Signal Service have done excellent work. The Air Services, officers and men, have throughout these operations been of the greatest assistance to me in spite of the fact that it has been impossible to keep them supplied with all conveniences and appliances as would have been the case in a civilised country. Not only have they successfully carried out the heavy duties of reconnaissance and gun fire observation, under the new and difficult conditions prevalent in Mesopotamia; but, in addition, from the 16th to the 29th April they performed the feat of supplying the beleagured garrison of Kut with supplies weighing approximately eight tons, medicines, two mill stones, fishing nets, 5,000 liras and 80,500 rupees, entailing 85 flights by the R. F. C. and 47 by the R. N. A. S. This has involved a great strain on men and machines and is deserving of the highest praise; latterly, moreover, it has been carried out in face of enemy aircraft superior to any of our machines in speed and fighting capacity. One machine was brought down by the enemy's Fokker machine, one officer killed and and one wounded, in addition to another shot down and two officers killed. Two machines have been damaged and brought home with great, skill (in one case the pilot being severely wounded) and it is not now safe to send our machines on flights except in pairs. The Signal Service has carried out its duties to my satisfaction. Although the Corps Signal Company was only organised and equipped to provide for a Corps of two divisions, it has successfully maintained communica tion with formations amounting to the equivalent of four divisions and a cavalry brigade and in addition has linked up Corps artillery for which no provision was made. In these operations, when exact co ordination of artillery bombardments and infantry assaults were frequent, good communication was of special impor tance and it rarely if ever failed. The personnel of the Signal Services had to maintain communications over a flooded river which frequently swept the cables away—or over long distances as between Falahiyah and Shaikh Saad or between widely scattered bodies of foops as during the attack on the Dujailah. An immense amount of work, much of it under fire, was entailed in main taining these communications. All ranks were shorthanded and the results achieved were I consider very satisfactory.33 (3) The strain on the supply services has been at times extremely heavy especially during the last three weeks in April, As mentioned in the body of the report, as the operations proceeded the stocks of supplies decreased instead of increasing as was anticipated, and, in consequence, living as we were from hand to mouth, dependent on the arrival to-day of the supplies which tvould be required to be sent out to the troops the next day for the following day's con sumption, any delay caused considerable anxiety to all concerned. In order to avoid the chances of shortage of certain articles I asked for arrangements to be made for complete rations for men and animals to be loaded ; by this means the best results can always be obtained from the minimum of transport. This system which, in previous campaigns, I have found to produce excellent results, was much opposed by the Senior Supply Officer at Army Headquarters, wedded as they are to other systems which are not so economical of transport. This system was sanctioned at Army Headquarters and at the outset worked well, but during the latter stages of the operations when supplies were at their lowest was rendered abortive by my D. D. S. and T., Colonel Dallas, who ordered deficiencies at intermediate stations of Shaikh Saad and Wadi to be taken out of the complete ration required for the troops at the front, the latter consequently ran short and the cause was only ascertained by me when I found that the men were not getting what they ought to have been. (4) In conclusion I desire to place on record the loyal support and co-opera tion which I have at all times had from my divisional commanders :— Major-General Sir G. J. Younghusband, K.C.M.G., K.C.I.E., C.B. Major-General H. D'U. Keary, C.B., D.S.O. Major-General F, S. Maude, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O., brigade commanders of Corps units— Brigadier-General R. C. Stephen, 6th Cavalry Brigade, Brigadier-General G. Christian, 36th Infantry Brigade, Brigadier-General G. B. H. Rice, 5th Infantry Brigade Brigadier-General G. F. White, R.A., Corps Artillery. and from my staff. The strain on the latter has at times been excessive, the con tinued operations afforded no respite and no words of mine can* adequately describe the good services they have rendered. One and all have done their utmost to give me all possible assistance within their power and to carry out mv instructions with unfailing zeal and devotion to duty and I especially desire to record the good work done by the senior members of my staff:— Brigadier-General L. A. C. Gordon, R.A., B. G. R. A. Bt. Lieutenant-Colonel and Temporary Brigadier-General H. J. P. Browne, Br.-General Gen. Staff, Temporary Brigadier-General C. Rattray, D. A. and Q. M. G. Lieutenant-Colonel G. B. Irvine, I.M.S , D. D. M. S. Their services and those of the officers referred to in the body of this report are specially deserving of recognition; the difficulties which had to be overcome dur ing the operations required determination, efficiency and energy of the highest order. The names of the following officers, warrant officers and soldiers have already been submitted for and have received immediate reward for their gallantry •Included in Sir P. Lake's despatch on operations, in action j in addition tO the latter I nOW 19th januaryto 30th Apni 1916. submit a list* of officers whose services I desire to specially bring to notice for gallantry and good service during the recent operations.

Instructions for the Corps Artillery, ist Phase.— ft. (0 Register on to the Dujailah and Sinn Aftar Redoubts, the hostile artillery and entrenchments between the above redoubts. (2) Shell Dujailah Redoubt including trenches near it, gradually increasing rate of fire as General Kemball's attack develops. Keep up a rapid rate of fire during the assault until the redoubt is reached when the artillery should search the trenches north of the Dujailah Redoubt as far as the Dujailah depression and neutralize the hostile artillery. 2nd Phase. (1) Shell the Sinn Aftar Redoubt including the trenches near it, quickening up rate of fire as the assaulting brigade of ' C ' Column commences the attack to assault the redoubt. (2) Search fire trenches leading in a northerly and north-westerly direction from the Sinn Aftar Redoubt and along the position itself in front of the ad vancing infantry. The Es Sinn Banks ' are only passable for the artillery at a certain point. Some of the artillery must therefore keep to the east in the final stage so as to search the hostile trenches on the east of the Sinn Redoubt and west face of the ' Es Sinn Banks ' where at present no entrenchments have apparently been prepared. Note.— (a) General Kemball's artillery will co-operate in the second phase especially in searching the hostile trenches especially on the east and south of the Sinn Aftar Redoubt. \b) The artillery with Column ' A ' {i.e., 36th Brigade) will co-operate in both phases unless required to deal with any hostile attack or movement which offers a good target. When this column reaches its forward position at vicinity of 31 b 4-8 its artillery will shell the Magasis Fort.APPENDIX ' B ' (m). Tigris Corps Order No. 27. gth March ig/6.
