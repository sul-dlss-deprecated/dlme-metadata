It must not be forgotten that we have already given Persian Government what amounts to virtual assurance that Persian section will be transferred as part of a wider settlement and that terms of transfer to which we have agreed amount to an obligation to re-open the British section as an essential corollary. It is true that we have not committed ourselves as to the details of the wider settlement, but at this stage it might be difficult though of course quite possible to say that the general treaty in the form in which we were prepared to sign it at the time of the suepeneion of negotiations in the autumn of 1932 is not after all a sufficiently satisfactory ,, settlement”. In any case if we do take railway out of the treaty it leaves us with so much the less bargaining material with which to obtain Bahrain and Hen^am. Best solution might he to give Persian Government choice of acquiring railway now on commercial basis or of acquiring it free as the result of conclusion of treaty. Assuming, however, that financial difficulties are such that question must in any case be treated separately I should be glad to know:1. Lowest price which Government of India will accept for Persian section. 2. whether in event of Persians being unwilling to ^ pay this price or anything higher than three and a half lakhs His Majesty^ Government and Government of India would be prepared to insist on removal of rails, etc., which might involve first-class dispute. 3. Precisely what commercial advantages Government of India desire for operation of British section. Tariff is fixed, at least -until 1936. Something might be done on lines of special quotas under Trade Monopoly Law for import vifi Zahedan of goods, whether of Indian origin or not, carriage of which would benefit railway. It would be no good securing quotas unless they were certain to be filled. 4* Whether as an alternative to sale the Government of India would be willing to transfer the Persian section and to keep the British section open for say ten years on condition that the Persian Government made good the annual deficit to the extent of one lakh. 5. Whether the Persian Government should be encouraged or otherwise to prolong the railway to Sistan (hut no further). This might greatly increase the freight earnings of the whole line. 6. Whether the Government of India would in any circumstances agree to having the two exchange stations which I suppose will he side hy side, on Indian soil. If water could he made available at some spot sufficiently near the frontier (wherever that may he in future) this arrangement seems to me to have every advantage. Operation of an exchange station on Persian soil would he constant cause of difficulty and I do not see why the Persians should not for once face the admittedly much smaller disadvantages of operating on Indian soil. PersianPersian Government are already for all practical purposes trying to buy railway (see my despatch No. 529 of 1932 enclosing copy of my despatch No. 255 of December 13th 1932 to Government of India), but reply I have suggested therein should bring them to sense of realities.

Te have now examined matter in all its aspects and following are facts which appear to us relevant and answers to Finister r s guest ion: (a) Reopening and working of portion 'between Nok-Kundi ( and rirjawa will apart from initial expenses involve r an annual loss of about one lakh,* (b) Records of export trade from India to Persia show following figures; December 19 29 - June 1930 Rs.. £4, 75 , 731 December 1931 - June 1932 Rs. 33,14,719 It will be seen that lowest figure recorded was just prior to closing of railway and that some slight revival has occurred recently. These figures suggest to closing of Railway* (c) Reopening of railway might facilitate working of A/N d customs line, if it is'eventually decided to impose i i&lt;vv December 1929 1931 Rs * 20,36,453 that ft V in g off in exports is due rather to operation of Persian Trade Monopoly Law, fiscal policy of Persian Government and general trade depression than But as you are aware that guestion is still open- anc 5ar)&amp; at present principal danger to Indian revenues arises from re-importation of transit goods which have 'been exported on drawback,and this is 'believed to take place mainly through parcel post which is independent of railway* (d) Present day value of line from Mirjawa to Dusdap calculated hy depreciation rules is estimated at 36 lakhs of rupees and its •♦break up 1 * value at 22i lakhs* If as Minister opines we could not remove it in face of Persian opposition it is for practical purposes valueless to us and we should he prepared to consider lower offer from Persian Government* (e) We should not he prepared to consider offer hy Persian Government to operate any section of Railway in British India. 3* Our conclusion is that no commercial advantage is to he expected from re-opening of line to Mirjawa in present circumstances and that only valid inducements to do so would he (l) to get hack some of money spent on constructing the railway heyond Mirjawa and (£) to secure concessions for Indian Trade with Persia possibly on lines suggested in paragraph 5 of Consul Sistan f s Despatch -^79 oi 22nd Hove mbs r 1932* as regards former we observe from Ministers Despatch 442 paragraph 4 that Persian Government would probably not be prepared to pay more than about 3-§- lakhs. Political advantages to he derived from conclusion of Gfeneral Treaty are of more importance to His Majesty's Government than to India and we can think ox no other political 'guid pro &amp;uo* which would make it worth our while to undertake the loss involved by re-opening 4. W therefore recommend that we should await proposals from the Persian Government for purchase of the lime from Mirjawa to Duzdap and should consider them on their merits* With re gard to the re-opening of our own portion, which we recognize would be a necessary corollary*» s to such purchase, we would recommend the line suggested a t conclusion, of Consul Sistan’s Despatch 479 and that we should make it clear to the Persian Government that we anticipate no advantage to ourselves Irom doing so and can only consider it on following conditions (a) thay pay us a reasonable price for our line in Persian territory (h) they give us some commercial concession to stimulate Indian Trade (c) they agree to concede points mentioned in paragraph 3 of Consul Sistan's Despatch 479. ye attach great importance to these and are not prepared to agree to any through running of rolling stock or joint use of a station of exchange, or, to 'begin with, any through hooking of passengers and goods* 5. The one element of urgency from our point of view is that present railhead at Fok Kundi is inconvenient and expensive and local administration are anxious to withdraw to Dalhandin if there is no early prospect of ^ advancing to Mirjawa. The issue of the above has been authorised. ^ Foreign Secretary to the Government of India( 4 )/ The future of the Duzoap xiallway had been the subject of lengthy correspondence between the Interested DepurUuentij of the Home Government, the Government of Inula, ana successive ministers at Tehran in the period 1922-1927. On the opening of negotiations for a general treaty with Persia at the beginning of 1928 Sir R. Clive, whose action was approved by the Interested Departments, Included the question of tne Duzdap Railway under the heads of discussion, ana presented on the 18th January 1928, inter .liu , the following proposal in regard to it: (A) obligations of the Go Vvii n-ont Inula*. (1) Government of India will cede to Persia ttiat part of tne Railway wiiicti lies within Persian territory; (2) Government of India will guarantee for a stated number of years not to abandon or remove that part of the line which is in Indian territory t but reserve liberty of action in the event of the Persian Government constructing or allowing to be constructed within Persian territory any railway of which the relation to the Nushfci- Dus dap Railway would, in the opinion of the Government of Inaia, affect the defence of India*s land frontier. (3) The Government of India will continue operate the section as far as the Persian / frontier;(4) The Government of India will arrange to operate the section from Mrjawa to Duzdap for a stated period under the present management and with Indian rolling stock ana personnel. (5) An arrangement to be made between the two parties for adjustment of accounts, etc.j ana the actual questions of road tax on ballast and the import of rations to be settled in the interests of both parties. (B) obligations of the Persian Govemmsillu (1) Persian Government will cede to the Government of India the necessary land for an e xchange station at &amp;;irjawa, with adequate water rightsi (2) Persian Government will guarantee (3) Persian Government will compensate Government of Ihdm for running losses on the desert section Mirjawa-Nushki up to a maximum sum per annum to he determinedj loan of rolling stock and personnel ana at the end of the stated period will have the option of replacing the personnel by trained Persians and will also have the right to purchase the necessary rolling stock from the Government of India. security of the line against tribal aggression; (4) Persian Government will pay for the (c)/(O Obligations .carom.J&amp;JjQ to An arrangemant to be naae between the two parties for adjustment of accounts, etc.; and. toe actual questions of road tax on ballast and toe import of rations to be settled in toe interests of both parties. 2, On 17to January 1929 toe Linister of Court, after a detailed consideration with Sir K. Clive of toe preceding proposals, enquired: (a) whether toe Government of India would guarantee for 12 years not to abandon the Hailway if Persia guaranteed for toe same period not to build/connecting line. (b) what exactly was meant by 'exchange station' and what would this involve lor Persia. (c) what had been the annual loss incurred by the Government of India in recent years over running the hallway? 3 # on 14th March 1939 the Government of India informed the Minister at Tehran that the answer to Teytourmache* s first question was in the affirmative* subject to a guarantee by the Persian Government that they would not 'construct or allow to be constructed within her territory any railway which in relation to the Nushkl-Duzdap hallway would, In the opinion of the Government of India* adversely affect India’s strategic interests* The Government of India would* for example* consider any railway construction southward of Meshed and eastward of/«• ** of Kerman disadvantageouB to the defence of India and in such case would have seriously to consider the position.’ (2) 'Exchange station' means a station for exchange of rolling stock between Persian and British sections of the iiailway and Involves for Persia the handing over of a plot of land about 3,000 feet long and 350 feet wide at a site at Mlrjawa to be fixed in consultation with the local railway authorities. Ihis will not be required for use so long as the Government of India continues to operate section from Mlrjawa to Ouzdap. (3) cm the 27th April 1929 they reported that working losses in the period 1925-28 were as follows: (») Nushki-aabandln secltofl: 1925/26 . 1926/27 . 1927/28 - ....2.60 lakhs 2.75 lakhs ,2.68 lakhs • • * (to) ;e XsiCil s 19 26/27 * • ♦ ♦ * 4* 33 lukxx id le 27/28 # * # *•4* 31 lutes (c) i^rlawa-puteap i3Q£.Um» 1925/26 H®. 30 1 352 1926/27 • * * • *Hs*2l| &gt; ^6w.. 1927/28 proxit of Hs.11*000. They subsequantly explained that Uieee losses aid not take into account interest on capital expenditure. They intimated on 1st toy 1929 that t&amp;ey were prepared to confine tdeir claim for a reimbursement of working losses to the Section Efe.lbandin-i2Lrjawa, ' l which is assert section proper*••• 'as Nushki-DtfIdandin section would be maintained in any event.' The/*&gt; 4. The replies given by the Government o£ Inait- were couniunlcated to the Persian Government by Sir Clive on 4th toy 1929 and a reference to the fact that-tee-propositions for a settlement of the question had been put forward by the togatlon on 17th January 1929 and the 4th toy 1929 was Biaae In the draft treaty (article 11 Duzdap Railway) submitted to leymourtache by H.K. Minister in August 1929. Teyoourtache in reply indicated that he had not yet made up his mind about the iiiilway, which he thought Insufficiently ( important for regulation in a treaty settlement, particularly in view of his doubts as to the utility of the Railway in Its present condition and on its present scale. Consequent on a reminder in January 1930 the Minister of Foreign Affairs submitted a counter draft about the Railway in July 1930 and added that he thought it would be best to settle this question outside of the Treaty. 5. The Persian counter draft represented an acceptance of the Government of India’s proposal, subject to the modifications;' (a) that they were not prepared to bear any portion of the financial loss on the running of the Railway; (b) that they desired to make themselves responsible for the running of the section of the Railway actually within Persian territory, and to receive from the Government of India sufficient rolling stock, etc. to make this possible/ \ 1KL mpossible 9 such rolling st»ock to ho coueu o.s part of the cession of the Persian section of the Hallway itself* 6 . The Goverment of India on the 20th September 1950 telegraphed tuat they were prepared to consider the Persian counter proposal as a basis of settlen^nt, subject to the following modifications: (a) Period of guarantee* Government of India were prepared to give a 12 years* guarantee, but would ’'prefer shorter period, say b years, in view of fact that they have refused sixare of our losses* “ (b) They were prepared to sake over the Mirjawa-Du^dap section at once to the Persian Government free of charge, to be worked oy them and were ready also to araw up m agreement for interchange traffic* They were also prepared to supply such rolling stock as might be necessary for working the section, but only on repayment. (c) In the event of any railway construction by Persia which, in the opinion of the Government of Inula, would fall within the terms of paragraph 2 of the Persian draft they wished to retain complete liberty of action not only to cease operating, but also to remove, the Indian section of the line* (d) They were prepared to waive their claim for a share by Persia of running losses on the kirjawa-Dalbandln section. (•)/(e) In the event of Persia discontinuing or intimating a desire to discontinue operation of her portion of the line 'we shall consider ourselves at liberty to do the same on our portion'. (f) They intimated that they would prefer the article regarding the irailway to he included in the Treaty, if H.M.G. saw no objection to the appearance in published documents of a clause in the terois of (c) above. (g) at the end of 12 years or such less perioa as might be agreed on, the whole question to be open to reconsideration. communicated the acceptance of the Persian counter-draft, subject to the modifications set out in the preceding paragraph. reported that the suggestion had been made that the Persian Government, in the event of an agreement being reached under which they would take over the Mirjawa-Duzdap section of the Railway, might, in view of th-e fact that the Government of India had worked the section at a loss, decide to increase the rates of freight and passenger fares over it, a measure which might seriously damage the volume of traue over the Duzdap route. v*4ille the Government of Inula were not inclined to take the risk very seriously, they suggested that when negotiations on the question were resumed endeavours should be made to secure the inclusion of a further clause 7 On the 1st October 1930 dir R. olive S In torch 1931 the Government of IndiaIn the proposed agreement to the effect that neither party shoula make any alteration in their rates and fares without giving three months* notice, or such shorter period of notice as may he mutually agreed upon, and His tojesty 1 s Minister at Tehran was instructed to take action accordingly. 9 # in and June 1931 considerable uiffieulty took place over the admission duty free of rations for trie Indian Government staffs employed on the Persian section of the Railway, the Persian Government endeavouring to insist on payment of duty or a special import licence under the Trade Monopoly Law,which would have involved an undertaking to export an equivalent quantity of material from Persia. The Persian Government were warned that failure on their part to adopt a more accommodating attitude might lead to the closing down of the Persian section of the Railway* Despite these warnings the Persian Government continued to insist on the export of goods of equivalent value and in consequence the Government of India, with the approval of H.M.G.&gt; decided to suspend the service beyond D^lbandln with effect from the ration train of 22nd June 1931 and to close down the Railway. ID* xhe immediate result was an enquiry on the 12th July from the Persian Ministry of Foreign gffairs as to the terms on Milch the Railway could be reopened. A copy of Sir R. Clive’s letter of 1st October, stating the terms/terns on which a final settlement of the Hailway question could be made, was communicated on the following day to the Minister of foreign affairs. •He enquired if its terms were still available. I reminded him that they were offered as an Integral part of a general treaty settlement and enquired if he coula state any reason why toe Hailway question should be selected for separate treatment...! said that on my view of the situation 1 coula not recoctacena to you a separate settlement...His Highness observed that ny attitude was not kina ana if I refused to entertain the question of reopening he would make his own dispositions. I replied that I would forward his enquiry to you but could not recommend it.’ 11. The Government of India suggested, in the light of toe Charg^ d'Affalres* account of his interview, that the best tactics at toe present stage would be to display no unnecessary eagerness, but await a further nave by Persia. •If further enquiries are made we think that His Majesty's Charge'd*Affaires snouia be instructed to say that we are ready to resume running trains on Persian section provided Persian Government are willing on their part to afford satisfactory guarantee of 'easonable treatment. We suggest that opportunity be taken by him simultaneously to Intimate that we are still prepared to hand over toe Hallway on terms intimated in our telegram of 20th September leoO Ho. 3198-8 (paragraph 6 above) subject to one additional clause in return for their protocol. The/f;F / — 10 * The additional clause which we desire to add runs as follows: Begins . During continuance of this agreement neither party ahull make any alteration in their rates ana fares over section of railway line between Nushkl and Duzdap without giving to other tnree months' notice or such shorter period as may be mutually agreed upon.* 12. H.M.G., after consideration of the Government of India's views and of the alternative courses open, reached the conclusion that in all the circumstances it would be best to concentrate on endeavouring to obtain an extension of permission for Imperial Airways to use the south Persian route rather than on the obtaining of u lease of Henjam in return for the reopening of the Duzdap Auilway. The jecretary of state for India, in informing the Government of India of this decision, reaurked: 'Had time permitted I should have preferred to consult you before issue of tnese instructions, but great urgency made this impossible and apart from better chances of obtaining desired result I have assumed, in view of terms of your telegram of 25th July 1851 -3 ) that you would agree as to greater relative importance of Gulf air route extension from point of view of Indian interests ascompared to Henjam.' 13, The Charge d'Affair as at Tehron was simultaneously instructed to infora the Persian Government that if the latter were ready to grant an extension of permission for Imperial Airways to/to use the South Persian route alter 31st &amp;arch 1932, H.M.G. and the Giovern^ont o£ India woula he prepared, in view of their representations, to consider reopening of the ifeilway. “In that event H.ii.G. ana the Government of India will agree, provided necessary guarantees are given regarding supplies, etc. for personnel, to reopening of Duzdap .tillway for period corresponaing to that for wnich Persian Government will extend Imperial Airways' term over 3outh ersian route. Ihey suggest that this period might be five years. This arrangement woula not necess rily exclude as part of an eventual general settlement and on the lines suggested, transfer to Persia of Persian section of the line.” made by the Charge d*Affaires to the minister of Foreign Affairs on 2nd August. Foreign affairs wrote to the Charge d*Affaires stating that the Persian Government accepted the tenor of Sir S. Clive’s memorandum of October 1st, 1930, (paragraph 7 above). 'Letter contains text of five arait articles reproducing in all essential points conditions enumerated in sections 1 to 6 of kemorandum. It suggests that these articles should constitute agreement to come into force on October 1st next and to be appenued it! due course as Protocol to general Treaty.' had been prepared to go no farther than considering/ A coarnunication in this sense was 15. On 21st September the minister of As H.M.G. and the Government of Indiaconsidering tiie reopening of the aallway In return for a corresponding concession In regard to flights In South Persia by Imperial Airways, the proposal that the agreement drafted In 1930 for the transfer of the Hallway should be accepted ana apparently put into operation at once was clearly open to objection, and the Charge' d*Affairea suggested that he should be Instructed to reply that H.M.G. and the Government of India 'regret that the closure of the liailway, for which they must disclaim all responsibility, has completely altered the circumstances In which Sir Robert Clive's memorandum was put forward, but nevertheless they -would be prepared to ^ regard the terms of that memorandum, upon which they note with satisfaction tnat both parties are agreed, as constituting an agreement to come into force as part of a i wider settlement** The Government of India, on being consulted on this proposal by the are now 0 ested in Secretary oi state, replied * prepared to agree to tactics paragraph 6 of despatch*. A ccommunication In the terms in question was made to the minister of Foreign affairs by the Charge d'Affaires at Tehran on 1st November 1931, 17, In the meantime, steps h^d been taken to obtain from the Government of India a statement of earnings and lossas in respect of the three sections of the Du^dap Railway from 1323 to 1931, This is • tW&amp;mstteae fto -Appendix— . ’’’ 18 /- 13 - c® 18. In February 1932 Mr. Hoare reported that 'Minister of Court has requested what is virtually implementation of this agreement' (paragraph |l ) 'in anticipation oi rapid conclusion of Treaty.' Mr. Hoare enquired whether in the case of favourable a&lt; velopment the lines could be put into immediate operation. 19. The Government of India, to enable them to reply to this last enquiry, asked for information on the following points: (1) Do Persians contemplate working Railway between Mirjawa and Zahidan or will they allow Government of India to work It? (2) If they Intend to work it themselves, what are the number and description of rolling stock, other than locomotives, that they will require? (3) Do they Intend to provide equipment necessary for carrying out of repairs, heavy or otherwise, to rolling stock on their line? (4) Is it intended that traffic should be through booked from India to Zahldan and vice - versa . or will traffic be bookea from either airection to Mirjawa only and rebooked thence? (5) Do Persians contemplate providing their own railway personnel? (6) mu coal, oil, and other consumable stores for operating Railway be obtained direct from buyers in India or through the Government of India? The Government of India added that they presumed that a working agreement for interchange of traffic/14 • traffic at Mlrjawa wouia be conclubeQ before the ifellway was reopened if the Persians intended working the Persian section themselves. Certain interim information as to the movable property required to work the Z&amp;hldan-MirJawa section was eocmunicated by the Government of Inaia to Tehran on s2nd February. The cost amounted to slightly under rts.2 lakhs. Coal, lubricating oil and waste, assuffiing a train mileage of 1,200 miles a month, plus allowance for shunting and pumping, were estimated at Tis. 2,000 per mensem in addition 20. On the 18th April, the Persian Government replied to the Goveramont of India’s questions In paragraph 19 above as follows:- (1) Yes. The Persian Government ^re concerned with the Railway only up to the frontier. (1) The number of rolling ctock will depend upon the contract 'which will be concluded between the two Governments for establishment of the line.' (5) Yes. (4) This will aepena on tue agreement between the two Governments. Ghould en agreement be drawn up with regard to through journeys 'naturally we will operate up to the frontier and the operation from there will be up to the Indian Government.' (£“ Yes. (£) purchase will be in the cheapest ikarket Sagjj it- 15 - 21. In August 1932 a Bill to provide funds for the opening of the Persian section of the iiailway was submitted to the tajilss. The Bill was passed In October 1932. The kin 1star at Tehran entered a caveat on behalf of H.k.G. in regard to the suggestion made in connection with this legislation that the ifellway had been handed over to the Persian Government. 22. Mr. Hbare simultaneously inalcated that so far as the Persian Government were concerned there was no need for us to hurry. So far as our own Interests were concerned, i however, it probably might be more urgent if the prolonged closure of the Hallway were having a prejudicial effect on the Indian trade with hast Persia. He recommenuea examination forthwith of the following questions:- (a) present aay value of the Hallway and such railway property as has been left in Persia. (b) Can the sale of the Hallway in any circumstances be considered? If the Persian section is not disposed of in a general settlement it will be desirable to dispose of it in some other way. (c) If the answer to (b) is in the afflimtive, what is the lowest price that mi^it be accepted for the Hailway and the railway property? There is no prapect of the Persians paying the real value, even if this proves to be much lower than the original capital/capital outlay, unci little prospect of their paying more than the sum for which they seem to have made provision in the present Bill. (d) Once the sale of the version section has been arranged, on what terms would the Indian section he reopened? *If no general settlement takes place it should not be reopened except for political price, however small.' (e) Sven if the political problem were solved, would the Government of India be able to afford the probable loss on working the Indian section? 'This again is a question of balancing the loss to Indian trade against the loss to Indian revenues. In the unlikely event of the political price being really ^ appreciable, it might become worth while to face the deficit.' (f) If the Persian Government offered to operate or finance the unprofitable section from Mlrjawa to Nok Kundl or Dalbandln, could this in any circumstances be considered? 23. The Persian Unister for Foreign Affairs, in reply to the caveat referred to above (paragraph 21), explained that the general Treaty negotiations “had not precluded the Persian Government from making use of the ig-ilway in its own territory and utilising it as a means of transport in anticipation of the coming into force of the provisions already agreed upon, nor is there anything to prevent the/- 17 - the said provisions i'rom heini; put into force separately ana before the coming into force of the whole Treaty.* 24. In November 1932 Major Daly, Consul- General Meshed, urged consideration, in connection with any agreement to reopen the Bailwsy, of a number of points ana suggested that the loss on reopening 'must be considerably greater than when the iiailway was previously in operation. In the present state of trade I cannot think that the loss would be justified.' On the assumption that the Persians had missed their opportunity of securing reopening in return for the extension of the Imperial Airways concession ana that the Treaty negotiations are of no further iamediate importance, Major Daly suggested 'that we should decline to reopen our operation of toe Hallway except in return for some substantial advantage ana then only on satisfactory agreement in connection with the points referred to in paragraph 2 above, what quid pro quo we might require is not a mutter on which I can express any opinion but...it might take toe form of some concessions which would benefit our trade in gast Persia, on which the receipts of our section of the Hailway would depend, particularly some agreement which would make It possible for our traders to once more compete with Russia in the sugar and piece goods trade.'tes. ;inute Paper.

A' Sir, I have the ho no or to refer to your telegram Mo. 2599 in which 1 was ins truc ted to express my views on the above QL'uoted matter. 1. The situation as regards this railway has recently undergone a considerable change. ■ Before the line to Bahidan was closed I expressed the opinion that closure would result in very great financial loss to the Persians, because they would be unable to control smuggling on the long frontier. This surmise has proved correct, and the loss to the Persian Customs at Zahidan has proved to be very serious while on the other hand their Customs Preventive Service has been greatly increased. In spite of all measures to co un terac t it, sm ug_, ling is still rife . I am convinced that it is this loss uO uhe Customs which is regarded by the Persians as of great importance and not any desire on their part to reduce the difficulties of traders, with whom they have never evinced the slightest sympathy.A • 7725 oy Indian traders a :or-( .rivers with joy— douhtlesso)^®cause they foresaw the opportunities for srnugvling. Latterly however, the Persians have he an very active at Zahidan, and a number so that there has been some reaction, and the re-opening or the railway for legitiiuate trade would oe welcomed. On the other hand, since the closure, the full force of the Persian fonopoly Law has became evident. Sugar, the hula 01 the Sast Persian Trade formerly in the hands of Indian traders is now 7 a -Russian monopoly, and piece- goods can scarcely ccmpe te with 11 ussian goods north of hirjand. The railway was pricipally useful for the sugar trade and since this is, at any rat Q for the time being, lost to the k Indians, it is difficult to see how the railway 1 could be operated without considerably greater ^ loss than previously, 2. There can be no doubt but that the Persians 0 3 j. ie ve cl that we w ere o ur s e x ve s des ir A a us o f re-opening the railway, and that the Closure was merely a political move on our id art to strengthen! our hands in regard to the Treaty negotiation^ and the matter of the concession for-Imperial Airways. Since both these matters have been since disposed 01 - the Treaty negotiations dropped, and the Imperial Airways route abandoned, they imagine that we would now be prepared to re-open the railway without requiring any quid pro quo . &lt;5, Should some agreement be arrived at there are points which I venture to submit require the most careful consideration of Indians have been prosecuted for smuggling,The Persians will oertainly not run the 1irjawa- hah-idan Section at any very great loss and will unless restrained hy sodjo agreerent, raise freight rates to an extent that will discourage traffic, and cause still further loss to the unre m unerative section in British territory. I aii convinced from several yeaxs practical experience or the dilficulties created hy petty local officials that no system of through-waggons or through hooking could he worked without infinite bother and friction. This entails expenses at I'irjawa for moving goods in the Exchange Station - expense which will tend to decrease the advantage to our traders. Fo permanent or satisfactory arrangements could he made at lirjawa unless an area, together with its water supply from the main supply, he definitely allotted for the use of our officials, offices, et yhe wersian section of tne station heing seperate. In other words if we ar^ to res-uria the use of the railway property there for an exchange station the enclosure should he definitely assigned to us and within it Persian Officials should not he allowed to interfere, the Persian platforms etc being outside our enclosure. The guest ion as to the amount ox the loss which may he anticipated is one on which can express no view other than it must he considerably greater than when the railway was previously in operation. In the present state of trade I cannot think that the loss would he Justified. To sum up, 1 am 01 the opinion that the re -opening 01 the Pailway would he of great advantage to the Persians, hut oi little advantage oo us, and thatwe are in a position in which w? can al'iord to wait, and in view of the fact that the Persians missed their opportunity of securing agreement i return for the continuation c f the Imperial firways concession, and the Treaty negotiations ar p of no further immediate importance, that we &gt;should decline to re-open our portion of the railway excepu in rt ourn a or some substantial advantage, and then unly on satisfactory agree ment in connection with the points referred to 'in para 3 above. That quid pr o quo we might require is not a matter on which 1 can express any opinion, but I would suggest for consideration that it might tame the form of some concessions which would oc^elit our trade in j ast Persia, on which the receipts oi our section of the railway would ^^ptmd pd-L. ticularj.y some agreement which would mans it possible for our traders to once more compete with Prussia in the sugar and piece-goods trade. it dues not seem to me to be unreasonable if W e lay stress on the fact that the Persian Monopoly Laws plus exclusive agreements with Russia, have so crippled our trade in 3 a st Persia, that, tb* utility of the railway to us is diminished to an extent that does not warrant our incurrin loss on re-opening unless there be prospect oi trade reviving or freight forthcoming.

A further despatch has ! since been received from Mr. Hoare (No.442 of 22nd October on P.Z.6932) giving an : account of the discussion in the Majliss, and discussing at some length the question of tactics. This question is one the answer to which must to a large extend depend on the answer, first, to the Minister’s suggestions as to the possible trade value from the Indian point of view of the hailway; secondly, of the points raised in paragraph 6 of his despatch of 22nd October. The Government of India have been asked for their comments on both despatches, and 4475b 1000 5.30 detailed/I3eE_. -. detailed examination may await the receipt of their views. 2. In the meantime the correspondence forwarded under Tehran despatch of ord November, (No. 455 on jr.Z./5d7/32) is satisfactory in that the Minister nas entered a definite caveat making rt all necessary reservations in respect of the attitude of H.M.G. In the U.K. and the Government of India” consequent on the Bill recently passed by the Majliss for the operation of the Persian section of the iteilway.

Although my assertion that the true political position of the railway was understood at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs may appear to have been somewhat optimistic, and although I have thought it well to make a formal reservation in respect of the recent bill, I still conceive that the position may be regarded with oomplaCQncy. If the Persian government can find any way of opening and operating the Persian section without bringing the necessary rolling-stock along the line from India they will earn the respect of even the most accomplished of engineers and it is also Just possible that if they commit themselves sufficiently definitely to the re-opening of this section, they will find themselves obliged to offer some inducement for the provision of the necessary material from India and the re-opening of the Indiansection.

These negotiations, however, do not preclude the Persian Government from making use of the railway in its own territory, and utilising it as a means of transport in anticipation of the coming into force of the provisions already agreed upon; nor is there anything to prevent the said provisions from being put into force separately and before the coming into force of the whole treaty.

The bill had previously been returned by the Budget commission with a favouraole report* la the course of a brief discussion that preceded the voting, one of the deputies, Moayyed Ahsaadi, asked for an explanation and added: *1 imagine that a railway was cona true ted during the W war in that region and was abandoned after a time when it 'was of no further use to them {meaning the British 'authorities - translator)* According to the information *1 have gathered, they intended to collect the railway (i*e 'remove the rails, etc.,). When Dr* Millspaugh was here a 'bill was to be submitted to the Mejliss for the purchase 'of this railway, whloh is useful for the transport of 'oereals and grain which are always abundant in Heistan. 'I do not know yet whether the railway has been given or 'sold to the Government* An explanation would at any rate 'seem necessary in order that we may know what the Eight Honourable Sir John Simon, G*C.S.I*, oto*, etc*, etc., fhe Foreign Office. /position iAaglo-persi&amp;n isau® oan do no harm and can safely he left to itself* 4* Of more practical interest is the statement that the sum of four million Kials (say forty thousand pounds) will pay not only for the material necessary to operate the railway, hut also for the railway itself. $he Government of India’s estimate of the cost of providing the material is about two lakhs of rupees (say fourteen thousand pounds)* This does not mean that the Persian government have valued the railway itself {that is f the permanent way and the buildings) at twenty six thousand pounds, because the credit now voted is apparently intended to cover working expenses for the current year as well as the cost of new material* It does, however, give some indication of the price that the Persian government would be prepared to pay* This price obviously falls far short of the estimated capital outlay on the Jlir^awa-Zahedan section, which is, I believe, placed at about eighty lakhs of rupees (say four hundred and fifty thousand pounds). There could never be any possibility of the Persian Government paying such a sum as this| nor do I suppose that an independent valuation of the railway and railway property now in Persia would come to nearly such a high figure* But when every allowance has been made it seems clear that the Persian offer will have to be greatly increased if the problem is to be solved on a strictly commercial, as opposed to a political f basi8*So far as the Persian Government are concerned, we can afford to wait calmly for the® to make tiie first move and in the event of an offer to purchase the railway really being made, to examine this offer at our leisure, &amp;• So far as our own interests axe concerned, the problem is perhaps rather more urgent if Indian trade with East Persia is indeed suffering from the prolonged closure of the railway. I therefore suggest that the following questions should be examined forthwith;- (a) Phat is the present day value of the railway and such railway property a® ha® been left in Persia? I am aware that such a valuation is bound to be difficult, but I suggest it be assumed for the purpose of this question that there are no political or other obstacles to the normal exploitation of the railway and that the Persian Government have no means of acquiring the railway except by purchase. (b) Can the sal© of the railway in any circumstances be considered? If the Persian section of the railway is not disposed of in a general settlement, it will in my opinion be desirable to dispose of it in some other way. fhough we call it our property it is, in fact, of no use to us and it is infinitely preferable to make a little money out of its surrender than to let it moulder into decay or pass into Persian possession through the lapse of time. (e) If the answer to (b) is in the affirmative, what is the lowest price that can be accepted for the railway and the railway property? It must be taken for granted that there ie no prospect of the Persian /GovernmentGovernment pacing the real value of the railway even if this proves to he a much lower figure than the original eapital outlay and little prospect of their paying more than the sum for which they seem to have made provision in the present bill* (d) Cnee the sale of the Persian section has been arranged, on what terms would the Indian section be re-opened? fhls question, which is a repetition of that which I had the honour to submit in say previous despatch, is the real problem* On the one hand, no Persian government would obviously buy the railway I unless they could use it* (in the ether, the re-opening of the Indian section has been made a political question, and if no general settlement takes place, it should not be re-opened except for a political price, however small* {#) Even if the political problem were solved, would the Government of India be able to afford the probable lose on working the India Section? fhls 9 again, is a question of balancing the loss to Indian trade against the loss to Indian revenues* In the unlikely event of the political price being really appreciable, it might become worth while to face the deficit. (f) If the Persian Government offered to operate or finance the unprofitable section from r.) aw a. to lok Ktodi or Balbandin, could this in any circumstances be considered? 7 . xn the course of the interview mentioned above, the Acting Director-General stated that there was /talktalk of extending the z&amp;hedan railway to Kerman. This extension should, he tbought, he of great benefit to British trade, and he himself regarded it as a much more practicable proposition than the northern-Southern railway, of the completion of which he was sceptical. 8 * I am sending copies of tills despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, ho. £17, and to His Majesty’s Consul at Sistan, Mo. 78.

Prom Mr. Hoare's despatch of 25th September it will he seen that the Persians have introduced into the Majlis a Bill which specifically states that the Persian section of the Duzdap Hallway has been '*transferred to the Imperial Government in its present state' and which provides for the working of that section (which is of course at present closed down) and indeed refers to the operation of the whole section from Duzuap through Mirjawa to Taftan, which is well inside British territory. 2. Mr. Hoare ±o drawing the attention of the Persians to the inaccuracy of the Preamble to the Bill, but is disposed to think that matters might be left at that, as he says, if real difficulty arose it would probably be difficult for us to remove the permanent way in the face of Persian opposition. On the general Question ol the future of the railway and particularly the course of action to be pursued if the treaty negotiations are broken off or suspended indefinitely, he is inclined, subject to the Government of India’s view, to think that from our point of view there is something to be said for re-opening, though in the absence of a general treaty such re-opening should be | in return only for a quid pro quo of some kind (para. 5), the value of which must depend on the Government of India's estimate of the value of the railway to Indian trade. 3. There is no doubt some force in Mr. Hoare's arguments. But as a matter of tactics one would have thought it very undesirable to let this Persian suggestion that the railway has been transferred to them/ 1 212 5C.C0 9.32them pass without comment, or to acquiesce in their starting to operate it. We are admittedly in a weak position, firstly because the railway was built withou Persian consent in Persian territory; secondly because our means of retaliation are few ana we shoulc. no doubt have considerable difficulty in impeding operation if the Persians were to press for this. On the other hand, as the Minister remarks, the Persian section of the railway is of little use by itself and that affords us a lever. But on general grounds it seems undesirable, particularly at this moment, to relax our hola on any of the rather unsubstantial items still left on our credit side in the negotiations. If we 1/tM, the Persians peacefully/Tust us from control of the Persian section of the Duzctup Hallway and if (as seems possible) we are facea with a demand for the handing-over of the wireless stations in trie Persian Gulf in advance of the conclusion of a general treaty, we shall be two points to the bad, the first of JSoh is one in the In^ia oflice view of some importance. i -- Lxd ^ tuing is to ask for the comments of the Government of India, both on the general question of tactics and.on the question of the economic importance to them of the railway.

Dear Sir, In reply to your enquiries nede from the Railway Administration with regard to the transport means and other materials necessary for Zahedan Railway* following are the replies to your question*- (1) The Persian Government contemplate working the railway [/ between Mirjaveh and Zahedan themselves. (2) The establishment of railway line between Zahedan and India does not depend upon the will of the Persian Government; only up to the frontier will concern the Persian Government and the activities therefrom will depend upon the views of the Indian Government. (3) The number of rolling stock will depend upon the contract #iich will be concluded between the two Governments for establishment of the line. (4) It is quite evident that the Persian Government will provide the repair means for the rolling stocks within the limit of the railway requirements. (5) This will depend on the agreement between the two Governments. Should an agreement be drawn up with regard to thro ugh-journeys, naturally we will operate / up to the frontier, and the operation therefrom will be up to the Indian Government. (6) The Persian Government will elect and provide the Railway personnel themselves. (7) Purchase of coal, oil and other consumable articles from the Indian Government or from other sources will depend upon the offers given, and will be brought obviously from where they are found to be more advantageous.

WITH reference to Mr. Hoare’s despatch No. 92 of the 17th February (a copy of which was sent to you on the 4th March), regarding the general treaty negotiations with Persia, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to state that in his opinion it is now necessary to consider the position of these negotiations as a whole in view of the Persian Government’s latest suggestion that His Majesty’s Government should agree to withdraw the British naval depot from Hen jam, and to obtain instead a prolongation of Imperial iUrways’ permit to operate the South Persian air route. 2. Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare will remember that in September 1930 a comprehensive memorandum, showing the views of His Majesty’s Government regarding the general treaty negotiations, was communicated to the Persian Government. This document, a copy of which was enclosed in Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 467 of the 23rd September, 1930, explained that there was only one tangible advantage which His Majesty’s Government would themselves derive from the proposed treaty, and that this advantage was the continuance by agree ment with the Persian Government, for a further period, of the refuelling and recreational facilities enjoyed by British warships at Henjam. The fact, there fore, that the Persian Government are no longer willing to grant a lease of the naval depot at Henjam has changed profoundly the whole aspect of the general treatv negotiations. . 3. The main advantages, tangible or otherwise, to be gained by His Majesty’s Government under the proposed treaty, as hitherto contemplated, may be summarised as follows :— (a) Henjam. Continuance for at least twenty, and possibly fifty, years of the recreational and refuelling facilities now enjoyed by His Majesty’s ships. (h) Bahrein. Abandonment of Persian claim. (c) Tamb and Abu Musa. Abandonment of Persian claims. . {d) A non-aggression article to include the Arab sheikhdoms under British protection on the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf. (e) A claims article. • i r aaev (/) Possiblv also the repayment by Persia of the capital of the £490,(HH pre-war debt. Persia is, however, at present paying interest on this sum, and is understood to be likely to repay the capital shoitly, apart from the general treaty. 4. On the other hand, the main advantages to be gained by the Persian Government are the following :— (1) The remission of all the war and post-war debt, i.e,, £1 510,000 of the “ agreed debt” Hitherto the Persian Government have only been informed of the readiness of His Majesty’s Government to waive £1 million of this sum in return for a satisfactory settlement. (3) British recognition of Persian sovereignty over Sirn, unjustifiably seized by Persia in 1887. „ ^ . ,. i ^ (4) Duzdab Railway. Transfer to Persia of Persian section, and under taking by the Government of India to operate the Indian section for five years (at an estimated cost to the Government of India of (5) Abrogation”of^Slavwy'Convention of 1882 which gives to British warships the right to search Persian vessels for slaves. [416 q—1]2 (6) Cession to Persia of wireless station at Hen jam and wireless apparatus at Bushire and Lingah. (7) Removal of British Residency from Bushire. 5. The concessions offered to the Persian Government, as enumerated in the preceding paragraph, are in point of fact of less importance than at first idoht appears. The Persian Government, for example, have no intention oi repaying the war and post-war debt, which they consider was spent in British rather than Persian interests at a time when British troops were in occupation of the country, and which ought, so the Persian Minister of Court maintains, to be regarded as British war expenditure. The British claim to Basidn is legally so weak that it could not be maintained if seriously challenged by Persia. Again, it is not possible for His Majesty’s Government and the Government of Iiidia to do other than hand over to Persia the Persian section of the Duzdab Railway, built during the war on Persian territory without Persia’s consent. It is clear that the Persian Minister of Court would prefer a more spectacular success than that which he would obtain through a settlement by which Persia obtained merely the concessions set forth above. It is for this reason that he has raised the question of the withdrawal of the British naval depot from Henjam. 6. Henjam, however, is not the only point on which Teymourtache is raising difficulties. He refuses to abandon the Persian claim to Bahrein. There is no indication that he is prepared to abandon the similar claims to Tamb and Abu Musa, or that he will be prepared to agree to a satisfactory claims article. The one and only advantage which he now holds out as an inducement to His Majesty’s Government to conclude a treaty is the possibility of an extension of the permission for Imperial Airways to operate the South Persian air route. 7. As regards the air route, His Majesty’s Government have carefully endeavoured hitherto to avoid giving Teymourtache the impression that they are entirely dependent upon Persia for the continuance of the British civil air route to India. In Sir John Simon’s opinion it is important to continue to take this line. If Teymourtache is given reason to believe that the Persian air route is a question of vital importance to His Majesty’s Government, there can be no doubt that he will refuse to give them satisfaction as regards Bahrein, Tamb, or Abu Musa, or, indeed, as regards any of the other points in the general treaty. Moreover, even if His Majesty’s Government were to agree to accept the air route as the only tangible advantage to be derived by them from the treaty, they can have no guarantee that the Persian Government would thereafter carry out the spirit, as well as the letter, of their obligation; there can be no effective guarantee to prevent them from cancelling Imperial Airways’ concession at any time on the pretext that the company have failed to abide by the conditions of their contract, finally, the Secretary of State feels strongly that the acceptance of the Persian proposal would form an undesirable precedent; that it would become known, not only in Persia, but also in other countries, that political concessions could be extracted from His Majesty’s Government as the price of a permit to operate air services over foreign territory; and that exactly similar difficulties would arise with the Persian Government when Imperial Airways’ new contract eventually expired. 8. Sir John Simon therefore feels that, as regards the air route, Mr. Hoare Miould receive instructions to take the line that this question is not one of those which was to have been dealt with in the general treaty; that if the Persian jovernment are finally determined to close to international traffic the only practicable route across Persia, Plis Majesty’s Government have no intention of ottering them any political concessions to induce them to change their decision, but will, if necessary, make alternative arrangements for avoiding Persian teiritoiy altogether until the Persian Government are willing to adopt a less umeasonable and obstructive attitude towards this question. Mr. Hoare would, lowever, make it clear that, so long as any international aviation is allowed to operate this, or any other, route across' Persia, His Majesty’s Government na ura y expect that Imperial Airways will be allowed to do so on the same terms. + Vu -p&gt; S le .£ ar( J s Henjam, the Secretary of State has long been of the opinion lat the Persian (government would shortly seek to bring about the withdrawal °n fl e . He same time, the sudden change of front on the pai of the Minister of Court, after negotiations for a lease have been in progress with him tor some years, is most unsatisfactory, and it might at first sight appear Tie i feint lilew' erim an( iMtionalpu mtlirawal I Hoare, i ■I Teyic tsatisfactor igfory b of Hei ^warsl Me nor 'it]1 ^iitPetsii's! efer ®eiitki| this reason! &gt;ry claims 2 ®. pent toll ; an exteiif ' t of the Britiii ajittodtii t the Perm ament, im ids Bahreiil in the 5 w: mthetrtl lereaftercffl tionsofW )ptanceofW : would il confess® 1 ,f a peraii 11 ' 1 : irways »' jairroutf'P on isMtfl ; have 10 1 flafl for ar«; Min? to $ )liM ibou' ave tat^- justifiable for His Majesty’s Government to take the line that this development proves that Teymourtache is not genuinely anxious to reach an acceptable settle ment, and that, in these circumstances, unless he is willing to waive his suggestion regarding Henjam, it appears useless to continue negotiations for the proposed Treaty of friendship. There are, however, strong objections to the adoption of this course. The absence of adequate legal justification for the presence of the British naval depot in Henjam renders it impossible to continue to use the depot against the wishes of the Persian Government. If, then, the Persian Govern ment press for withdrawal, there is no possible ground for a refusal to comply with theii wishes, and all that can be done is to endeavour to obtain sufficient notice to make alteinative arrangements elsewhere. To break off treaty negotia tions owing to the Persian attitude regarding Henjam would not improve the position, for, in the event of a rupture of negotiations, it would still be necessary for His Majesty s Government to comply with the Persian Government’s desire that the depot should be removed elsewhere. 10 It will be seen that Mr. Hoare suggests that the question of Henjam should be dealt with by notes, to be exchanged simultaneously with the signature of the treaty, under which His Majesty’s Government would agree to withdraw from Henjam, and the Persian Government, on their side, would grant sufficient time for alternative arrangements to be made elsewhere. Mr. Hoare has explained semi-officially that he might try to arrange for this final note from the Pei sian Government to contain an assurance that the units of the Gulf Squadron would still be welcomed at Henjam for recreational purposes in the course of their cruises, and he would also endeavour to secure an interpretation of the term recreational purposes, in a semi-official letter from Teymourtache, as meaning that the canteen, club and football ground could be retained. IP While there can be little doubt that, if the Persian Government insist on a withdrawal, it will be necessary to accept a settlement on the lines proposed by Mr. Hoare, if this can be arranged, it might be possible at the outset to approach Teymourtache on somewhat different lines in the hope of reaching a more satisfactory solution. Mr. Hoare might say that negotiations have been proceeding for years on the assumption that Teymourtache was prepared to agree to a lease of Henjam; His Majesty’s Government now wish to hold his Highness o his previous agreement to come to a mutually satisfactory arrangement on this question. If, however, his Highness does not wish to enter into a formal lease, such as that hitherto under discussion, His Majesty’s Government will be satisfied if he will agree that His Majesty’s ships shall for a certain period of years enjoy the facilities for recreation and refuelling at Henjam which they have enjoyed in the past; and it would be well if Mr. Hoare were in a position to add that the forthcoming arrival of the new Persian navy seemed to render it possible for His Majesty’s Government to repay the Persian Government for racihties granted to His Majesty’s ships at Henjam by providing facilities, though of a somewhat different kind, for the new Persian navy. For example, Mr. Hoare might point out that the Persian Government will inevitably find that hen* new warships, if they are to be maintained in a seaworthy condition, will require the normal docking facilities at certain stated periods, and that, until . Persian Government have provided such docking facilities for themselves, it might be convenient for them to be allowed to use such facilities as are available j n P 1( Pan dockyards. Although the Secretary of State is not confident that this jme of approach would offer a satisfactory solution, he considers it desirable at least to explore the possibility of offering the Persian Government advantages rvi 1 * navy ’ suc ^ as locking facilities, and I am to enclose a copy of a letter which has been addressed to the Admiralty on this point. 12. Finally, as regards the General Treaty negotiations as a whole, it seems necessary to decide which are the essential points upon which Mr. Hoare should stand firm. If, as explained above, it is not proposed to accept as a basis of negotiation the offer of the South Persian air route as the sole advantage to be gained by His Majesty’s Government from the treaty, and if it is impossible to obtain as a result of the treaty the facilities required at Henjam, it seems necessary to concentrate on the other British desiderata enumerated in t ^ above. More especially, it seems desirable that the Persian claims o ° Pnbi’ein, Tamb and Abu Musa should be finally disposed of as a result of the general settlement. The Persian claim to Bahrein, in particular, however -rounded it may be, is inconvenient on account of the considerable expenditurefix I* r ,ofthere of a new naval depot as an alternative to involved m the con, R idency as an alternative to Bushire. It is highly Hen] am, and of « f “® W iu ^ring such expenditure, His Majesty's Governmest desirable that, bet ) security of tenure, such as can be achieved only bv should be assured of absolute securuy therefore to be hoped that the final abandonment of ^ejersian^ Goyei . nffient to agree &gt; ^Sr S Samuel Hoare ^ generally ^ bdng sent to the Admiralty, Air Ministry, CoJial Office Dominions Office, Treasury and War Office, and copies of lette which are bring addressed to the Admiralty regarding Hen yam and to the Air Ministry regarding the air route are enclosed herein for the information of Sir Samuel Hoare. j am &amp; e .

W. 1. P. Z.1723/32. !fc -'S WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.Wa 1. 29tH March, 1952. it Clll Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 16th March, E. 1111/208/54, on the subject of the Persian treaty negotiations. A copy of this letter has been sent to the Oovemment of India, who should receive it before the end of the month, and Sir Samuel Hoare, before comitting himself to a final expression of opinion on the comprehensive issues now raised, would wish to ascertain their general views. But he desires in the meantime to offer to Sir John Simon the following provisional observations on the various points mentioned in your letter which he has examined seriatim . 2. He concurs in the view expressed in para. 2 and has no consent to njake on the lucid and convenient summary of desiderata detailed in paras. 5 and 4, except that it seems right to add the general advantages to be gained by Persia by consolidating her friendship with this country, and the enhancement of her international prestige from the conclusion of a comprehensive treaty with His Majesty* s Government on a, basis of reciprocity and equality. It may perhaps be legitimately assumed that the Persian Government (whatever their ostensible attitude) are not blind to these potential advantages and, if so, this iact, iar more than any individual concession, should provide them with an inducement to meet the very moderate requirements of His Majesty*! Government. 3. As regards para. 5 of your letter, Sir Sarmiel Hoare, while agreeing that sgpi© of the particular concessions ofiereo ta Persia are of more importance than others, considers that taken together they cannot be regarded as without substantial value. The War and post-War debt is admittedly unlikely to be paid oy Persia, but it is in the eyes of His Majesty's Government a legitimate claim, baaed on the agreement of 1926, and it theMinister of Court maintains that the value of a claim depends chiefly on the value attached to it by the claimant, it is no less open to His Majesty’a Government to adopt tm same attitude in regard to some of their am proposed concession*. The British claim to Basidu is juridically weak, but its weakness can hardly be conroarod with that of the Persian claims to Tsmb, Abu Muea md Bahrein, in view especially of the facts that Basidu has been occupied for over a century by the British and that the Persian claims are to Islands never, at least since a remote o c ri o&lt;^, in the i r &amp; f f ecti ve o ecu oa t i on. 4. The Duzdap railway still appears to Sir Samuel Hoare to be one of tiie most important bargaining assets in His Majesty’ Government’s posseasicn. it has always been clear that it is in my ease impossible for HP;. Government and the Government of India without Persia’s consent to possession, cut Persia would gain little frim c.er acquisition of thst section unless it was counlfK'- with an agreement by the Poverriment of India to provide rolling stock, etc., md (most important) to operate the Indian section of the line. ' ''hi s the Gov err 1 men t of India can or.lv do at groat financial lon^ to th- mselves, acc it is the leverage in tbs negotiations. 6. As regards the future oi the air route, air Samuel Hoare is impressed by the view® conveyed in p rro. r and 8 oi youryour letter, and subject to the observations of the Air Miniatrj would be disposed to agree with air Jom Simon that the attitude suggested in para. 8 of your letter should be adopted on this point. 7. As regards Henjsm, the Secretary of State would wish t await the views of the Lords Connie si oners of the Admiralty, who are primarily concerned. But as at present advised, while he would be disposed to concur in the adoption of the proposal that instead of a lease a definite undertaking should be given by the Persian Government that the present facilities at Henjan should b ; con tinned for a term of years, of which the number should be specified, he fears that it might be of little use to obtain an agreement with the Minister of Court, unless in a definite fora which would be incorporated in the treaty. 8. In regard to the conclusion reached in para. 12 of your letter, nsrnely that if (the air route concession being separated from the general negotiations) it is not possible to secure satisfaction from Taimourtache on the subject of Um jam, all the offers which have previously bean made contingently to Persia, with the addition presumably of the remaining ,J5lQ,000 of war debt and possibly other concessions, should be made good in return merely for the withdrawal of the unsubstantial Persian c la ins to Bahrein, Tsnb, *nd Abu !lusa, it may he doubted whether in such circumstances it is worth while to conclude a treaty at ail. In tills connection I am desired to refer to Sir R. Clive’s desnatch bo. M3 of June 26th, 1931, in which the conclusion was reached that His Majesty’s Government are unlikely to be seriously inconvenienced if no general treaty is concluded for the present. If therefore Taimourtache does not recede irora nis present position regarding Hen jam and if he is not prepared to conclude a treaty on the general basis already put forward by His Majesty* s Gov eminent, Sir Samuel hoard (though ue recognises the desirability of improving our relations with Persia if possible) would suggest (subject to the views of the Government4. Government of India and the other Imperial Departments concern©ci) that it is a matter for consideration whether it would not be preferable that the negotiations should be suspended by mutual agreement. 9. 3ir Sasuel Hoare, however, is not without hope that clear if it is mad.e^dsfin It aly and courteously to the rarsian Govern «ent that the limit of concession has beoii reached by His khjegty’ a (lovortuaerit ma ii a, firm policy ic sdopted in the matter of her, jam and the air route, this policy is as likely as stay otner to mature in a satisfactory conciuaion the ii ^ oti o ci otj a • 1.;.

Persian Baluchistan ani Sarhad .—- Sardar Abdul Hussain of Remishk con tinues to raid caravans. The General Officer Commanding who was proceeding to Tehran on leave wes ordered to return from Kerman and prepare for operations against the Sardar, which are expected to begin about November 12th. Stores for the advance from Kwash are now being collected. 50 men under a Sultan have been posted at Rodbar to intercept any Baluchis who might proceed from British territory to the assistance of Abdul Hussain. Barkat Khan of Bint has declared his intention to join forces with the Remishk Sardar. The latter is reported to have construct ed trenches along the boundary of his territory. Sardar Jahind Khan has returned to his home in Persian territory. The G. 0. C. has gone to Bam to meet the G. 0. C. Kerman Brigade in connec tion with the operations to be under taken, Relatives of Lashkar Khan Gumshadzai recently raided into British territory and carried off 20 camels. Some of these have been recovered and the Persians are pursuing the matter. Mirza Khan Afghan, a notorious gun runner has recently been in the Sarhad. It is believed that he is purchasing some rifles from Idu Khan and Juma Khan Ismailzai. 94. Sistan and Kainat .—At Zabul camels have been commandeered to convey grain to Kwash for the Army. Samsan Ud Dauleh, the heriditary Governor of Sistan was suddenly relieved of the Governorship which has been taken over by Yawar Shuja-Ud-Dauleh of the Amnieh. Shaukat U1 Mulk has been unable to discover the reason for jjhis, beyond private information from Tehran that H. M. The Shah consider ed he had been insufficiently energetic. There were however indications that this is the beginning of a policy long contem plated in Tehran, and that the Sardars of Sistan will probably be deprived of their tenure of crown lands, which will be distributed among their followers, from whom Revenue will be collected direct. The Police at Zabul have been very active in compelling the Baluchis to adopt the Kullah Pehla ve and are now forbidding them to wear the usual buggytrousers and are insisting on rrousers of European style. As a result the villagers have ceased bringing supplies to the town and there is a great shortage of wood for fuel. 95. Persian Military Affairs. —Cons cription committees have been busy at both Birjand and Zabul. With the exception that the cost of securing exemption appears to have increased, their operations seem to be conducted in much the same manner as last year, which results in only the poorest persons being conscripted. 95. Persian Officials .—Shah Reza Khan from Zahidan Customs has been appointed Head of Customs at Zabul. 97. Communications .—The road from Railhead at Nok Kundi to Mirjawa is row so bad that it will shortly become impassable for lorries. The Zahidan Zabul road has not been repaired since the Shah’s visit last year and is in a deplorable condition. It is reported that the Persians intend to seriously push on the Construction of the Chahbar-Kwash road. 98 Movements of British subjects .— Mr. W. M. H.

A few years ago vehicles could he registered and licenses obtained at Zahidan. It would appear however that son* perquisites are to he derived in the matter and the authorities in Meshed decided to keep control entirely in their own hands. The position now is, that a British driver, who may have no occasi n to visit Meshed is compelled to travel a distance of 1200 miles to obtain a driving license. Ho charge is made for the license, but 1 understand that a fee is levied for ’Medical examination 1 &lt;fc the driver has to pass some elementary test. The loss of time and cost of a journey to Meshed Jtf and back is of course a considerable hardship. 5. in actual practice it seems that the regulations are only strictly applied in the case of Foreigners, for I know that the Persian notables of Sis tan &amp; Birjand &amp; 1 believe the same applies to Zahidan, have not taken the trouble to obtain license from Meshed &amp; are not molested, 6. Recently while the Headquarters of this Consulate were being moved from Birjand to Sis tan the Police refused to allow the driver of the Consulate lorry &amp; njyself driving my own car, to proceed* After some difficulty, and telegraphic references to the Covoroorate-CJeneral at Meshed a temporary arrangement was made for us to drive for a month *0n the tosanefca Consul’s responsibility. The Governor-General made a slight concession in my case to the extent that a personal visit to Meshed would be excused, if 1 forwarded particulars &amp; my English driving license. This I am unable to do, since after a lapse of several years my expired English license has naturally not been retained. It was still, however insisted that the Lorrydriver must proceed to Meshed, which would entail absence from duty for a fortnight or more &amp; considerable expense to Govern- 4»# This in s^ile ox the fact that the man holds an Indian license u is an ex-H*CUQ* of a Military transport unit &amp; manifestly an efficient driver* 7* I have discussed the matter since arrival here with the local Police Officer Sc enquired what was meant by 1 The Consults responsibility* referred to in para.6 above* He informed me that the issue of a license was solely to ensure that there should be no dangerous drivers on the road* If an accident took place Sc a pedestrian were killed the Court would auto matically exhone rata a driver who held a license, for he must surely be a good driver &amp; the fault could not be hisi 8# The farciaal nature of the regulations is apparent from a recent occurrence near Mirjawa, where an Indian, who had no license, upset his lorry through sheer carelessness &amp; injured a number of passengers including an English nurse* Probably because the injured persons were all Foreigners, the man has not received any punishment* 9* I would therefore suggest that, the date from which we should grant to Persians the facility of obtaining driving licenses &amp; of registering their vehicles at Nok-Kundi,should co-incide with the date from whick the Persians are prepared to allow British drivers, resident far south of Meshed, to enjoy similar facilities at Zahidan A that until such time &amp; Persian driver who travels to Knndi should not be permitted to return through British territory until he proceed to Quetta to register his vehicles &lt;&amp; obtain a driving license.

From Mk Kundi to Juszak, a distance of about seventy miles, it is either a sandy or a stony plain without water or vegetation and not a living creature can be seen* The road alternates between stretches n hard stony surface and soft sand* Over the latter the surface has now become appalling; in mai? places there are ruts a foot deep and the general state of the road may bo deduced iron the fact that oar averse speed in a light motor car was between tea and twelve miles an hour* It can only be © question of a few weeks before the road becomes impassable even in dry weather and it can be oralicted with certainty that this will happen at latest on the occurrence of the first winter rains, probe ly this month or next* 2* At the present time, there is quite a considerable trade between India and last Persia ©von with a lead to railhead of about one hundred aid forty miles by rod between liok Xundi and Zahidan* Ua the way back from Mirjawa we uet hare passed at least twelve heavily laden lorries and I m told there is an average of from six to ten proceeding both ways every day* When the road gives out, as it must shortly do, it is inevitable that this trade will come to an end and a further result will be that the Seistan Consulate will be entirely cut off frora India by this route* It must also put an end to the trading operat ns uf the Angle Persian Oil Company infcst /ersia with the result that the Husaians will ©ntirelj capture this market. It in net known whan attitude fie §eT©nifii©nt of xndia would adopt towards these possibilities hut ao rt from the inconvenience of the severance of the Consulsta f ntn India, it would seem a great pity that the valuable Indian trade and the sale of Anglo^ietaian Oil Company products in 8 ast Persia should come to an abrupt end. Assuming that these factors do weigh with the Government of the solution seems to be to carry on the railway service at le&amp;at as far as Koh-i-Taftan statica whieh is only about twelve miles from Mirjawa, md between the two nieces there is hard surface on wbidk the road couia be maintained without difficulty. It is believed that the Ra Iway authorities are opposed to making Koh-i- Taftan the termiaos, chiefly on account of the water difficulty. Exactly the same difficulty is felt at Kok Kundi but of coarse to a leas degree. The alternative would be to construct a good metalled road from Kok Kundi to Mirjawa but the expense of this wuli probably be prohibitive, as it may be roughly estimated at not less than ten to fifteen lakhs of rupees. To this must be added interest charges and cost of maintenance. On the score of expense it is a. question of balancing the cost of maintaining mid operating over the Nek Kundi lirjawe section of the Railway against the cost of constructing and maintaining a Metalled road. There is also for consideration the effect on the volume of trad© of the cost of the two different methods of transport. A further point for consideration is whether the continuance of the railway sendee to Koh-d-Taftnn would affect the negotiations which, according to &gt; rcss reports* are proceeding between the British &amp; Persian Governments regarding the reopeningof th. Bailway as far as Zahidan as a quid /;ro ailQ for pemissioa for our Imperial Air Wail 30 nrioe to use il, e Persian coast aloa* the Qulf. if the Tarminu. * 9re f ixed at Koh-i-fnftan or Kirjaw. this would probably suit the * Persians almost as sell as if traffic were carried on to gahidan as it is baliewed that the stretch of road between Kirjawa «.nd Zahidan is in stood order end can easily be maintained* 3# I have s own this section of my report to or Carson, JiTisimnl Superintendent, N.^B» .uetta and he agrees generally with the view expressed. 1 understand t at he is, and has be'n, In corre; oondeneo independently vdth the Agent, North ‘astern Bailway on the whole question He suggest* that the whole difficulty ra ght be solved by obtaining territorial -nd property rights at Eirjava and Baking this the terminus* ''ith this 1 entirely agree fris the local point of riaw.

Aitei an examination of tha route on the spot I have c me to tha conclusion that this is not necessary and that the expense of setting up this control station need not be incurred. Just across our border, a Bile or two fr a Mirjawa, there is an old fort known ns Kills Sufaid. This iort was always oscupiad by our levies up to the time that tfco Baileny was opened and it oen be reoooupied sathout objection from the Persians at nay time.

At present we are not quite clear as to the foreign Office attitude.

We regard the latter as a desideratum of first class importanil. If Dodd succeeds in getting it by merely offering to start running the trains again, so much the better; but we would like him to be instructed that in order to obtain the air route he may, if necessary , use the transfer as well.

Our views as to the manner in which the situation should be explored are stated in our telegram of Kith July, 1769-S, but the situation has changed with the lapse of time and we are now prepared to agree to tactics suggested in paragraph 6 of Despatch. 3. Above was drafted before the receipt of your telegram No. 2999, 13th October, of which it disposes.35a 3000 5 31 inute Paper, Department. Please see P.Z, 6352 (Mr, Dodd’s despatch No, 522 of J1 September and a preliminary departmental note on it) and Mr, Baxter’s letter of 9 October, enclosing a draft telegram in reply to the despatch. It seems to me that the F.O. proposal hardly squares with the attitude which they adopted at the meeting on 7 October. The position is briefly as follows:- On 21 June the G. of I. decided to stop the running of trains from Dalbandixto Duzdap. By 13 July the Persian Govt, were making representations against this closing down of the railway. In their telegram of 16 July - P.Z. 4550 - the G. of I. suggested that we should not be in a hurry to reply to these representations, but that if further representations were received, we should be prepared (presumably in return for a quid pro quo , though the G. of I. did not enter into this point) to start the trains running again, and that we should simultaneouslj intimate that we were still ready, moreover, to transfer the Persian section of the railway to Persia on the terms of transfer which were provisionally settled in 1930. The decision arrived at by H.M.G. was to offer to recommence the running of trains (nothing being said about transfer of the line) in return for an extension of the permit to fly the south Persian route. This offer was made by the British Charge d’Affaires on 2 August; the Persian M.F.A, deprecated the coupling of the two questions of the/res the railway and the air route; the British Charge d'Affai replied that they were inevitably coupled in the view of that 'if for the purposes of public opinion the Persian Govt, preferred that there should be no evidence of a connection between the two issues, it night be possible to arrange the raatter M , but that he could ’’predict that in practice it would be found that the Duzdap problem could not be satisfactorily settled before the Imperial Airways problem”; the Persian M.F. A. promised to bring the question of the air route up with the Council of Ministers, to urge the case for an extension, and to inform the British Charge d f Affaires of the result as soon as possible* No reply on the air route question has since - been received from the Persian Govt., but in a letter of 17 September they propose the transfer of the railway on the terms provisionally agreed upon in 1930. There are now two questions to be decided:- (1) whether we should be prepared to offer^in return for an extension of the flying permit^ not only to start the trains running again on the Duzdap Railway but also to transfer the Persian section of the line; (2) the question of the best tactics to be employed Sr working up to a bargain on these lines. As regards (1), we know that the G. of I.oXxs la,r/Uy prepared to transfer the line, and Mr. Dodd, in para. 6 /C of his despatch, presumed that this, as well as the running of the trains, can be conceded in return for a quid * pro quo. At the meeting on 7 October Sir L. Oliphant indiea,ted that the ^.0. would make every endeavour to secure the extension of the air permit, and we understood them to agree that the transfer of the railway as well asv I Minute Paper.

The d.o. letter from the F.O. now received takes a different view, end also seems to me to contain some inconsequential reasoning; the F.O. wish to keep in hand the card of the transfer of the railway for use not in connection with the air permit but for subsequent and contingent use if and when the negotiations for a general treaty are ever resumed; they speak of the transfer as a trumpcard which is to be used in the general negotiations, and they evidently attach importance to it for their own purposes, but at the same time they say that it would be useless for our purposes - viz., the extension of the air pemit - since M to propose to the Persians such a further concession would be foredoomed to failure”. It is submitted that we cannot accept this attitude. The continuance of the south Persian route in plane of the greatly inferior Arab route ought to be regarded as being in the first rank of the desiderat a which we wish to obtain from the Persian Govt.; the other desiderata which may be regarded as of firstrate importance are presumably the safeguarding of the position of the A.P.O.C., the renunciation of the Persian claim to Bahrein, -n- possibly the securing of our naval station ao Henjam, the position of the Imperial Bank o~ Per.-a, etc.; the question of the air route does not seem to yield in importance to any of these; against these other desiderata we have certain things to offer, such as a cancellation of the Persian debt, which has/has hitherto been regarded as our final card. It nay he remarked that hitherto the F.O. have consistently taken the view that the Duzdap Railway is negligible as a bargaining asset; it is strange, therefore, that,they should now wish to reserve it for the general negotiauior.s. The F.O. proposal seems, untenable from another noint of view also* In so fax as we may distinguish special Indian assets and interests fran Imperial assets and interests generally, the Duzdap Railway is an Indian assei^, and if the S. of S* and tne 0. of - • are C^, aj 4 .^ wLu willing to give it up for a particular quid ^ ^ it is; f difficult for the F.O. to stand in their way. t U 1 It is not, of course, suggested that the U b*-\ A ^ f transfer of the railway will necessarily turn the scale in /vj the air negotiations; but whatever weight it has, it seeijis ^ desirable to put it in the scale, in order that we may leave nothing undone which may help to secure the south Persian route. &amp; Cm** /•-. II sf)/ .j ■ Apart from the question whether the transfer of the railway should be used for this purpose, there is also the question of tactics. This is more difficult. Mr. Dodd suggests that he should not in writing couple the railway and the air route, but that if a really suitable opportunity occurs, this might be done orally; he says 'It is just possible that if I show sufficient indifference regarding the railway and am not too pressing ^ regarding the air route, the Persian Govt, will themselves connect the two questions'. In the departmental note of 7 October some doubt was expressed as to these waiting tactics, but in such a matter perhaps we had better be guided by the view of the man on the spot, and there may be a favourable opportunity of bringing matters to a head after/ /fM *r k ^Paper. Department. c 5 31 after a short delay, when active progress has been commenced with our preparations for the Arab route; &lt;z meanwhile, Mr. Dodd would present Ih . Truvorr^-e memorandum on' the Central Persia route and introduce the topic of the South Persia route by enquiring what alternative the Persians can now offer to the route surveyed by Mr. Travers. As regards the Persian proposal for transfer of the railway, Mr. Dodd proposes to reply that the closing of the train service has altered the circumstances in which the transfer of the railway was proposed last year, but that nevertheless H.M.G-. would be prepared to conclude uhe transfer agreement H as part of a wider settlement” (the intention of these words being to leave it open whether the quid ~orq quo should be the air route or some other desideratum ). Perhaps we might concur in this part also of Mr. Dodd's proposed tactics. The F.O. draft telegram proposes to approve, and we might concur in the draft, subject to the omission of the whole of the long second para., explaining that we isagree with it for the reasons suggested earlier m his note.

As Oliphant explained to you orally after the meeting on 7th October, we feel grave doubt regarding Dodd's assumption, in paragraph 6 of his despatch, that His Majesty's Government should be prepared to agree, if the Southern air route could be secured, not only to the provisional re-opening of the Duzdab Railway, but also to the further concession represented by the trans fer of the Persian section. We feel that this final concession to the Persian Government, which it was proposed to make only as part of the general treaty settlement, would simply be wasted if made at the present Walton, Esq.., C.B., M.C.present stage* if and when the treaty negotiations are resumed, our Minister will be much handicapped by the fact that he has practically nothing to offer to the Persians in return for our desiderata . I would have the utmost difficulty in inducing the authorities here to do anything which would deprive him of a trump card, however small in the general negotiations; and we must remember that we have no reason to suppose that, if the Persian Government are not willing to give us the south Persian air route in return for the provisional re-opening of the In any case, to propose to the Persians such a further concession would be foredoomed to failure and would, in our opinion, be thoroughly unsound. We agree with Dodd that, at the present stase, it will not be desirable for him to approach the Persian Government again with an offer to link up the Duzdab Hailway question with the air routequestion, unless a suitalDle oppor'tuni'ty arises for doing so orally.

The Duzdap Railway and the extension of the Imperial Airways permit. to devious Papers:-- 4475b 1000 5.30 FOR INFORMATION. After lengthy negotiations regarding the Duzdap railway the Persian Government were informed on 1st October, 1930, that we were prepared to accept an agreement on the following lines. (1) The Government of India to transfer 5 . J ■ - ■' O - 'll : : • „ to the Persian Government the Persian section of the Railway between Duzdap and Mirjawa and to sell the rolling stock necessary to work it. (2) The Government of India to operate for at least five years the Indian section of the railway(and to waive their previous claim that Persia should share the running losses) bo long as Persia operates her section/ / ■ rWA section and on condition that the Persian Government does not allow the construction of a Sailway southward from Meshed or eastward from Kerman, which might, in the opinion of the Government of India prejudice the strategic interests of India. (3) The Persian Government to cede to the Government of India a piece of land for the construction of an exchange station at Mirjawa. (4) Each of the parties to take the necessary measures for co-operation in re gard to traffic etc. It waa contemplated that this agreement should fouro part of the general treaty with Persia (negotiation of which is now suspended). On 16th July the Government of India v telegraphed that they were prepared to hand over the railway on the terns proposed in 1930 subject to the addition of a clause that during the con tinuance of the agreement neither party would alter the rates and fares over the sections of the railway between Nuskk and Duzdap without giving notice to the other. By this timethe . i T running of the trains between Dalfiaddiri had bean stopped by the Government of India owing to the difficulties made by the Persian authorities in regard to the sending of supplies to the staff at Duzda p, ^ On the 14th July the Persian Government approached the British Charge'' d* Affaires with a view to the railway being re-opened. At the beginning of August the British Charge'/ * Pi ^ 3/^ 818 a 5000 S.29 inute Paper. Department. Charge i Affaires a± Teheran,under instructions, informed, the Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs that His Majesty's Goverameht and the Government of India were prepared to consider the re-opening of the railway for five years if the Persian Government were prepared to meet them in a similar manner by extending Imperial Airways permit for the same period. The Persian Minister of Foreign Affairs deprecated the coupling of the two questions. It will be seal from Teheran despatch of 21st September below that the Persian Government now calmly propose that the agreement drafted in 1930 for transfer of the railway should be accepted and apparently’ that it should be put in operation at once. The British Charge d f Affaires proposal/in ^ dealing with this demarche are explained in paragraphs 6 and 7 of his despatch. It will be seen that he considers that we might not only sfatz running the trains again but also transfer the railway^if we can get an extension of Imperial Airways permit. It would probably be well worth aiming at* on^these lines. But the British Charge d* affaire's views as to the tactics to be pursued are perhaps &lt;open to doubt. He suggests that he should not regard^ the air route and that he should not couple the two questions except indirectly and by implication. It is not clear why there should be any need for so much delicacy, though on the question of tactics much weight must of course be attached to the views of the man on the spot. It is clear however that these tactics, if employed, will mean further delay before we know definitely/definitely whether or no the Persians will clench the ^ L - t ri jj bargain. It may be desirable to consult Mr. Dodd as to bringing the matter to a head more speedily than he contemplates.s* 5/18/M) ^r’ ; /''• \ ;‘“v. W v-/ , J ^ f ft*, ,, ^ v. ' O .; British Legation, 5j 5 Gulhek, 21st ‘September, 1931 My Lord Marquess, ith reference to my telegrams Nos* 209 and 210 of today’s date, I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship, herewith, a cony of the letter which I have received from Feroughi stating that tne Persian Government are Prepared to aceeot the tenour of .,ir Robert Clive’s memorandum of October 1st x93G* Xhis memo ran du®, of which a copy was sent to Your Lordship’s predecessor in , ir bbert Clive’s despatch No. 488 of October 6th, 1930, enumerated the conditions tinon which the Government of India would, as a part of the general treaty settlement which wee then contemolated, be prepared to transfer to the ersian Government the section of the netta - Duasdab railway situated on ersian ter itory. 2. Perough!’s letter contains what are in effect five draft articles and Your Lordshio will observe that they reproduce in all material ooints the conditions enumerated in the memorandum. Vhere is no article corresponding to section 4, which dwelt on the fact that the Government of India would make a considerable sacrifice by continuing to bear the 1 ss incurred on the operation of the railway between Mirjawu and Dalbandin, but this was hardly to be expected* ^ small ooint which may be noted 1b that in Article 2 f, la armti&amp;re’ Is substituted for 'fcirjawa* as the ooint from which the line will be transferred to the Persian Covernment. Article 2 also contemnla tes i Honourable M sj*que88 of Reading, O.C.B. , e ' ,c *» etc. , etc. , Ihe Foreign Office. mcontemttl&amp;teB the relegation to « ^ luture agreements of two questions (the connexion between the Indian and r.relan sections and the ^ nrice to be paid by the Persian Government for Indian roiling- stocit) both of which might in practice prove difficult to negotiate* 2. I shall be glad to learn whether, anart from the considerations which I discuss in the following paragraphs, these articles are in general still acceotable to His Majesty’s Government in the Inited Kingdom and the Government of India and whether they see any objection to the articles forming a protocol to be attached to the treaty and covered by a single article in the treaty. ihe articles obviously need some re-arr ngement and the language needs some reivision as regards etyle and accuracy, but these points need not be considered at this juncture. They will also need to be supplemented by the articli relative to the fixing of rates snd fares which the Government of India desire to add to their earlier conditions fsee Government of India telegram So. 1769. : of July 16th to the Indie Office), 4. However gratifying it may be that the Persian Govern- mtnt should h,. ve accepted, somewhat tardily it is true, but nevertheless without argument or substantial alteration, the conditions whicn His Majesty’s Government and the Government of indla themselves formulated as a fin; 1 concession, it is necessary to examine closely the circumstances in which this notification has been made. It is characteristic that ^eroughi’s letter melees no mention whatever of the closure of tae Persian section of the railway and the terms (the Prolongation of imperial Airways’ oermis, Ion to use the southern route) n on which His Majesty’s Government and the GovernmentGovernment of India are preoared to reooen iti in fact of anything that has hanoened since 1*. r.-.a „ , toiace .Jir Robert Clive delivered the *aiefnor&amp;ndnTn twelve months apo* &gt; 1 + vi n instead it blandly assumes that the Government of India win forthwith, i. e. , from October let next, accept, without further inducement, the heavy financial sacrifices which the settlement involves. It equally blandly Ignores the fact that the Railway settlement was only offered as part of a general treaty settlement and suggests that the treaty should merely have appended to it as a protocol an agreement which is already in force. It is true that it expresses a hone that the treaty itself will be concluded without delay, but such pious hopes are of no value in this connexion. As for the date mentioned, October 1st, I do not V suppose that the Persian Government imagine that a provisional railway agreement could really be concluded by then, but r think that they are clearly anxious to see the railway reooened at a very early date. Row large a price they are prepared to nay for reopening I cannot at present estimate. G* I am However satisfied that His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India should not in any circumstances accent this offer unless the erslan Government are prepared to prolong the use of the southern air route by Imperial -irways. ihey have be n told that these are the terms uoon ^ which the railway will be reopened and these terms, or some concession of equivalent value, should be insisted upon. It is true that the inconvenience which they suffer from the cl sure of the railway may not be great enough to make them accent these terme, but the inconvenience on this side is even less, for to Judge from reports from His Majesty’s Consular officers in Iv.etern.eastern Persia tae Indian trading community regard the closure vlth complete equanimity, while to the Government of India it must he a definite financial advantage. His Majesty f s Government and the Government of India have therefore something to gain, &amp;nc&gt; nothing to lose, hy waiting to see what the ersian Covernment will offer. 6. It Is true that strictly speaking the continued use of the southern air route was the oriee asked for the reooening of the railway, and that the transfer of the ersian section is really a separate concession. But I nresume that, if the southern air route could be secured. His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India would be prenarad to regard the two fciepe as a single operation. I therefore suggest, for Your Lordship’s consideration, that I should be instructed to reoly to Feroughi that His Majesty’s Government In the United Kingdom and the Government of India regret that the closure of the railway, for which they must disclaim all responsibility, has completely altered the circumstances in which ir Robert Clive’s memorandum was put forward: but that nevertheless they will be prepared to regard the terms of that memorandum, upon which they note with satisfaction that both parties ere agreed, as constituting an agreement to come into force as oart of a wider settlement. It would probably not be necessary to be &amp;ore explicit; the 1 ereian Government would understand that a ^ro quo was still required, while His Majesty’s Gove n- ®ent and the Government of India would be free either to concede the point In return for the southern air route, which is not a 'treaty' question, or a® part of a treaty settlement, in return for any of their other desiderata which they might find it convenient to substitute therefor. 7.7. r should b, grateful If l might rc o, ire your linstructlono on this desoatch by telegram, not because of the yusdab railway In Itself, but because the reply I hav, suggested might possibly, if It were made at shout the same time as the / enquiry which I am proposing to make re garding the southern air | route (see my telegram No. 308 of 21st September), be of some assistance (I cannot put It more strongly than that) In evoking a favourable reply to that enquiry. It will probably not be desirable to snake any further reference in writing to the ! DuZ(iab railway in connexion with the air route, or vice versa, but if a really vsuitable opportunity occurred this might be done orally* It irs .just possible that if I show sufficient indifference regarding the railway and am not too pressing regarding the air-route, the Persian Government will themselves connect the two questions. It is also possible that if October 1st come© and goes and no reply has/been sent from this Legation to Krough! f s letter, he will himself begin to make unofficial enquiries ©s to the steps which I have taken. Co such enquiries I should reply (oy word of mouth) that I had referred the question to Your Lordship, but that I could hold out little of a favourable reply unless our conditions, which were well known, could be met. This might lead, if not to m offer, at any rate to a more reasonable frame of mind. o • It will of course always be possible for the Persian Government, in the absence of a settlement, to operate the line themselves, (in which case the Government of India would have a somewhat doubtful claim for the value of the rails) by acquiring from other sources the necessary rolling-stock. Tut though Persian amour-propre will attempt many things, I doubt whether it would attempt anything bo costly and futile as this, more especiallymmmm especially when it is considered that Kirjawa has no importance other than that which the railway confers, and that the only ^existing road does not connect Mirjawa with the present rail head, but passes some way to the north of it, only rejoining the railway at Duzdab itself. 9 ‘ 1 am 8endin 8 a copy of this despatch to the Government of India and to the Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I have, etc., (For H.M.

Gulhek, October 6 1930 WITH reference to my telegram No. 238 of the 29th September I have the “ur to enclose herewith copy of a letter which I addressed to the Minister for 'oreign Affairs on the 1st October enclosing a memorandum on the subject of the luzdap Railway, a long letter in regard to the question of telegraphs and a draft xchange of notes respecting the removal of the Residency at Bushire I also enclose opyoi a letter of acknowledgment from his Highness, dated the 4th October warmly taakmg me for this communication and saying that, in view of the goodwill shown ,y His Majesty s Government, he hopes it will not be difficult to come to terms on the ew points that remain to be settled. 2. I gather from your telegram No. 202 of the 1st October that you consider . 1 h-advised on my part to have volunteered these further concessions as emg llkel y t0 leave Persians under the impression that His Maiesty’s Govern- lent were so. anxious to make a treaty that they could ask almost any terms they led. 1 regret that my action did not meet with your approval, but I venture none Qe less . mos t respectfully to suggest that our position has not been, in fact, impromised by my action. I have the genuine impression that the present Minister )r Foreign Affairs is anxious to come to terms with His Majesty’s Government, ^4 if it were not for the Minister of Court I believe that we should succeed in including a treaty. It was after a long and general discussion of the whole position lat I came to offer these additional concessions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, 3t as an additional proof of our desire to make a treaty at any price with the ersian Government, but as an earnest of the goodwill of His Majesty’s Government ad of her desire to remove all remaining points of potential friction between the vo countries in the interests of mutual friendship. I had made it perfectly clear to is Highness in the early part of this conversation that a sine qua non of any treaty as the abandonment by the Persian Government of her claim to Bahrein and the *vo small islands of Tamb and Bumusa. 3. Now if we look more closely into the actual concessions which were offered to Highness, what, in fact, do they amount to ? («) Our decision to remove the Residency from Bushire. It is true that I was ot then aware of the indiscretion of a Basra newspaper which announced this fact J the world on the 12th September, giving as a reason, not the desire of His lajesty’s Government to meet the wishes of the Persian Government, but the desire. J our own interest, to be rid of Persian pin-pricks and to facilitate the air route J°ng the Arab coast. I submit, however, quite apart from this newspaper disclosure, ^t His Majesty’s Government having definitely decided to remove the Residency, ^was daily becoming more apparent that the sooner we did so the better. (h) Telegraphs. —It is admitted that we are on somewhat delicate and difficult round in the matter of the Indo-European Telegraph Department; on the one hand, had to try to make the Persians believe that we were making a large and generous oacession to them; on the other, it had been decided, in any case, to close the depart- 3ei it, as far as Persia was concerned, from the 1st March next at the latest, in view the arrangements come to by the India Office with the Communications Company. t seemed imperative, therefore, to lose no time in addressing the Persian Govern- flent and at the same time to endeavour to obtain such cover as I could for what ev entually prove to be a somewhat dubious concession. . . ( c ) Finally, as regards the Duzdap Railway, all that has been said is that His Hjesty’s Government are prepared to accept the Persian counter-proposals as the asis &gt; under certain reservations, for subsequent negotiations. A I cannot help feeling that if it becomes necessary eventually to make any statement about the breakdown in the present negotiations, either in Parliament or ^ the press, we are in a very strong position. The odium for the breakdown lies [255 11 ' b u-1] u itohto-dav unquestionably with the Persian Government. Personally, I place the failure to make a treaty this autumn—unless, of course, the Persian Government, as is always possible, make a last-minute volte face entirely at the door of the Minister of Court I reported last May that his Highness had had a breakdown m health; since that time, it is true, he has led a more regular and reasonable life, but he has continued to control, in spite of the state of his health, the direction of every department of the Government; he has had neither rest nor holiday and is nervous and over-wrought; like most Orientals, he carries the game of bargaining and bluff beyond its proper limits; he may have had the impression that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to go to any lengths to make a treaty—if so, perhaps I am to blame, albeit unwittingly; he has deliberately tried to blackmail us over Bahrein by inciting the press on two occasions, since the negotiations began, to conduct a campaign of calumny against His Majesty s Government on the question r '[injctre of the Persian claim to possession of this island. I realised when I had my two hours’ conversation with him on the 4th October (see my telegram No. 246) that lie h ' I :ing for excuses rT was m a nervous and excitable state, and that he was really only looking tomake the conclusion of a treatv this autumn impossible. I need only mention his almost insulting attitude on the question of double income tax when he insisted, as a d condition of the conclusion of a treaty, upon a simultaneous exchange of notes in ' , H which His Majesty’s Government would admit in principle the justification of the ® eD(10lll€ Persian claim to a share of any income tax levied on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. jF lJ ® ^ I was aware, from what Mr. Jacks had told me, that he had for some time past been negotiating with his Highness on this question. The oil company admitted liability on the basis of the present Persian tax of 4 per cent, of some £91,000, and Sir John Cadman had instructed Mr. Jacks to offer to commute the tax for the remainder of the concession at the round figure of £100,000 per annum. After pretending to accept this figure and obtaining details as to how it was arrived at, Teymourtache had then demanded that the company should agree to a sliding-scale increase in case the Persians raised their rate of tax and had then suddenly broken off direct negotiations altogether with the company. I should have liked to have replied to r, re his Highness that, in case His Majesty’s Government admitted liability on the part ; meD1 P r ^ of the Treasury to refund to Persia a certain proportion of the income tax levied in Great Britain, no direct payment would be called for for a number of years, as it L could be deducted from the £1,510,000 of war debt which had been agreed to over the 'Meni signature of the Persian Prime Minister in 1926. I decided, however, that it was -A,'0 preferable not to say this—at least, on this occasion. 5. I trust that you will not misunderstand my action in raising the question ^quiei of what would be the attitude of the Persian Government after my departure on PMtemen leave. I did not for a moment leave his Highness under the impression that we were ^ prece afraid of their pin-pricks. I told him that such a policy would, in my opinion, be P^etjei so unutterably foolish and merely act as an irritant to good relations. I hilly intended, if I did not receive a satisfactory reply, to ask His Majesty the same question when I was received in audience. ' J 6. The most vulnerable spots for Persian pin-pricks are, of course, the Residency at Bushire, and Henjam. It would be reassuring to get a statement in writing out of the Persian-Government, if that were possible, that, as regards the Resident, he would continue to receive the same facilities as in the past. I shall certainly endeavour to obtain this. As regards Henjam, I very much doubt the Persian Government taking any extreme measures or of attempting to refuse the benefit of this anchorage to His Majesty’s ships and the recreational and other facilities on shore to the officers and men. I can hardly believe that even the Persian Government will be so foolish as deliberately to provoke unfriendly relations. jc leymqurtache said that His Majesty would undoubtedly assure me of his desire ana ^ intention to maintain relations with His Majesty’s Government on the most friendly , e $co] footing I may mention that in two instances since my interview on the 4th October ; - is Highness has been as good as his word. The Persian Government have now Jlpc promised to maintain what is practically the status quo in regard to consular bags until the 1st January, while to-day, in reply to an urgent request I made him on the telephone he consented to the Air Force in Iraq sending if thev desired to do so, a Royal Air Force machine to search for Mrs. Victor Bruce who'had last been seen over Hen] am at 1 P-M on the 5th October and had not since been heard of. _ . l • , / :te ®7 j ere fore, that, much as the suspension of the recent negotiations : : l 18 °. • ,. re f e ec ^ there is no reason why they should not be resumed and brought o a satisfactory conclusion at some later date and that meanwhile there is no reason saletti ^mei r Mantes peric le 'sanp6 i o afQtirmQ nni controlent Toperation du cable restent aux mains des seals sp&amp;iaTistes qui s’y connaissent.

An Indian trader went so far as to tell His Britannic Majesty^ Consul-General that he had made much better profits before there was a railway tc Fuzdap. The fact of the matter is that in spite or because of the trade restrictions certain firms dealing in wines and stores are making huge profits# The chief difficulty is to get profits out of the country# A Sikh firm however reports that laok of business has reached such a pitch that they have already closed their Birjand branch and will close their Meshed business as soon as they have collected outstandings# They will keep open their ruzdap branch, transferring it if necessary into British territory# Laok of business is caused by Trade Restrictions and has no connection with the Luzdap railway.

His Jlajesty's Consul 31 stan &amp; Kain Tlie Foreign Secretary to the Government of India Foreign and Political Department Simla# I have the honour to refer to my telegram No 325 regarding the water supply at Mir Jana# The statement made in the abovementioned telegram, that the source of the pipe line supply was in British territory, was, I regret, inaccurate, &amp; was based on information supplied me by the Railway authorities. Having since seen the pipe line I am convinced that the whole supply lies in Persian territory. This important modification made it impossible for me to dictate terms as to the continuation of the supply, I learnt, however, that the G#0,C, was most anxious to maintain the pipe-line, but at a loss as to how to repair it. Having ascertained from the Railway authorities that the earthenware pipes intended for its repair are now lying at Baibandin &amp; are of no great value, I told the G#0,C# that I would suggest for the consideration of the Government of India that these pipes he presented to the Persian Grovernment on the conditions that - 1, The water required for our buildings at id r jaws should be guaranteed, free of all payment, 2. That water for our levies at %ileh Safid, just over the frontier should be given at Mirjawa, if required, either by delivery by camels or by means of a small pipe to the fort, should we desire to put one in.The G*Q # C* immediately replied that he could of his own initiative guarantee the continued supply of water to our buildings &amp; persuasion to draw water for CUleh Safid by camel, but that toe question of putting small pipe would require the sanction of bis Government, but that if the matter be referred to him he would support all the proposed arrangements* How that traffic on the road between Mirjawa &amp; Kundi is likely to increase greatly &amp; will include the regular carriage of mails etc 1 would suggest that the former Levy post of Q,ileh Safid should be reocoupied, as the road is at present very poorly guarded &amp; for a considerable distance is within easy reach of raiding parties from Afghanistan* It was because of the possibility of our reoccupying &lt;41 leh Safid, that I thought it prudent to include its water supply in the conditions of our possible gift of the water pipes to the Persians* In the agreement regarding the boundary at Mirjawa made in 1905 one of the clauses had been that the post at Pad aha (which is presumably another name for leh Safid) should be permitted to draw water at Mirjawa* If ray proposals meet with the approval of the Government of India, I would suggest tiut ;lis Majesty's Charge d’ Affaires at Tehran, might be asked to obtain the ooncurrenoe of the Persian iniolrv uf Foreign Affaire to the proposed arrangements at Mirjawa since a purely local arrangement might be disputed at some future date. Doubtless the 0.0.C. will have reported our conversation &amp; supported the proposals. On receipt of the Persian Ooveminents oonsentconsent to the arrangement, &amp; with the approval of the Government of India hy whom authority might kindly he given to the Railway Dept, to hand over the pipes lying at Dalbandin to my representative, I would arrange for the G.G.C. to collect the pipes, at their expense, from Daiahandin. He has already signified his consent to transport the pipes, if presented. A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to His Majesty’s Charge d*Affaires at Tehran, and to the Hon ♦hie the Agent to the Government of India in Baluchistan, with special reference to the proposed re-occupation of the Port at Qileh Safid for the protection of the road.

The Persian Government had ashed us to re-open i.iis railway s and .Jiis had given us an unexpected opportunity for asking the Persians to give us something in. return. Mr. Dodd s telegram Ho. 150 s copies of which had been circulated officially, had suggested that we should ask for the lease of Henjam. The Foreign Office were not altogether satisfied with regard to this suggestion, and had decided, before consulting the other departments concerned, to obtain the further view* of our Charge d»Affaires at Tehran privately. The difficulties about asking the could uerhaps be summarised as follows. Firstly, the Hen 3 am lease was one of the most important advantages which ills Majesty's « result of the general treaty Government stood to secure as a - ^ negotiation. ««. P«.l« »» » “ d “ *° r ' ! loan.,.! whetner th. Pen.l»» »«»“ “ “ Sl ' “ “ ” merely In return for tw re-opeeims t»e vhe Jr ‘~ ri '° y ' ^ 5i A ' 1931 ' Secondly, even if the PersiWn agreed'in principle to eet off the re-opening of the railway against the Henjam lease, it was hy no means certain that we could obtain a satisfactory lease* oh the contrary, there were important difficulties still outstanding in connexion with the Hen jam Protocol (e 0 g 9 Article 6 of that Protocol regarding jurisdiction), which would have to he the subject of complicated negotiations. Thirdly, if we asked for the Hen jam lease, and we failed to come to an agreement with tho Persians, this would Infinitely increase the dangers of our position at Hen jam, which was already sufficiently precarious. In these circumstances, it had occurred to the Foreign Office that ii was just worth considering whether it might not he better to ask for the extension of the south Persian air route. A similar suggestion had occurred to the India Office, and he had just seen a letter from Lord Amulree to Mr. 'fedgwood Benn containing an Air Ministry suggestion to the same effect. The air route certainly seemed to have advantages over Henjam. For one thing, the negotiation of an agreement with the Persians would he a much more straightforward issue, involving nothing so complicated as the Hen jam Protocolo ' 7 e could simply suggest that the railway and the air route should he operated for a corres ponding period. Again, failure to reach an agreement ~ a possibility which must be frankly faced ^ would leave us no worse off than at present; in fact, failure to come to terms with the Persians regarding the southern air route, though regrettable, would indubitably clarify the position, and strengthen the case for pushing on with the Arabian route. 2, Mr, Rendel here read the private telegrams which had been exchanged between the foreign Office and the Change d'affaires at Tehran. 3. Mr. Rendel proceeded to emphasize tne necessity for /absoluteV t 5023 i (25&gt; i 1931 J absolute secrecy in connexion with this question* He added that the correspondence with Tehran showed that the Charge d* 1 Affaires was of opinion that ? if it was decided not to await the Admiralty Os decision on the practicability of removing their coaling depot from Henjr.m to Behrein^ it would be best to attempt to secure from the Persian Government an extension of the permission given to Imperial Airways to operate the souths:^, air route, UTo Hendel •onderstood that th© Admiralty were not at present prepared to state whether Bahrein was a possible alternative for Hen jam* It would be undesirable to postpone approaching the Persians regarding their request for the re-opening of the Buz dap Railway, as any delay on our part would probably lead to Persian retaliation in the immediate future, possibly at Hen jam 0 He suggested, therefore, that the Charge d-Affaires at Tehran should be instructed as soon as possible to approach the Persians on the lines that it. ma3.ce s little difference to us if the railway is to be re-opened or not, that it could only be re-opened at a substantial loss to us, but that if the Persians were willing to give us something as a Eli! HIS, we Should be ready to re-open the railway at once. In. %m Foreign Office view, it would be better, for the reasons ©plained above, to ash for the air route as a ouid mo. father than for Hen jam, 4o Caotain CIMKINGHAM , said that it must net be suppose^ tn&amp;i. the Admiralty had decided in favour of moving the Henjam depot to Bahrein, The Admiralty attached great importance to Hen jam.

Copy of to FOR USE BY DEPARTMENTS ONLY. &lt;tc —~*A. 'CV' t /Ifl ll (reDepartment. Please see the instructions (on P.Z. 4965/31) sent to Tehran in the light o f the Cabinet decision that we should endeavour to secure an extension of the permission for Imperial Airways to use the South Persian route in return for the reopening of the Duzdap Railway. The telegram from the Charge d’Affaires at Tehran now submitted records a general discussion with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in which this question was covered. It will be seen that in addition to the Duzdap Railway and the extension of Imperial Airways’ concession, discussions took place on the draft agreement to regulate the withdrawal of the Indo-European Telegraph Department from Persia, and on the Persian failure to implement their formal promises to place the Imperial Bank of Persia in a position to deal in exporters' exchange on the same terms as the National Bank. The present submission does not comment in detail on these questions. Suffice it to say that Mr. Lascelles appears to have dealt with both entirely satisfactorily. The important section of the telegram is Pt. II, which deals with the Duzdap Railway. Mr. Lascelles might perhaps have been wiser not to emphasise the decrease of trade consequent on the monopoly law. But in general he seems to have handled the question exceedingly well, and Sir Denys Bray, who has seen the papers, agrees as to this. The Foreign Office telephone that they propose, subject to our concurrence,to telegraph formally approving Mr. Lascelles's language, and „ _ II submit that we may concur in this. His handling of the situation is the more creditable as he is an officer of very short service, whose first appointment dates from October 1926. fe cannot yet feel optimistic as to the prospect of securing an extension of the Airways concession in return for the Duzdap Railway. But at any rate we have made it clear to the Persians that we are prepared to consider reopening only on a business basis and in return for some quid pro qup . Mr. Lascelles’s representations will in any case go a long way towards clearing the air. As he remarks, the result of our demarche M depends on real importance of Duzdap to the Persian Government •f Thls Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Goiemment. and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.' id) I).

I then spoke very strongly on the subject of your telegram No. 124. 1 remined him of his own assurances (see enclosure in my despatch No.224) and of Taqizadeh’s promise (see my telegram No,108) x . He protested that these promises had been merely to the effect that a solution would be found if possible: it had certainly never been the real intention of the Persian Government to put the Imperial Bank of Persia on exactly a similar footing to the National Bank. I expressed astonishment and quoted the Prime Minister’s letter of May 13th, 1930. He argued with obvious embarrassment that monopoly law had created a new situation. I retorted that the whole point of this as of other international agreements was to provide security against an otherwise uncertain future. As long as the Imperial Bank of Persia continued to be handicapped His Majesty’s Government could hardly avoid conclusion that no agreement with Persia would provide adequate security.

Bent to India, ( , v I then broached subject of and spoke in c the sense of your telegram 127. Minister for Foreign Affairs' tried as before to make grievance out of our evacuation on the ground that it constituted detri mental and unprovoked departure from existing position. 1 thereupon produced detailed chronological table of whole correspondence showing that railway employes had hung on for eleven days without provisions and that Minister for Foreign Affairs’ note regarding exemption from monopoly law restrictions had arrived eight days after evacuation had taken place. In the face of this he was obliged to admit 'Blame did not wholly (sic) rest with His Majesty’s Government'. I then gave him latest figures regarding loss on Dal Bandin Mir j aw a section and decrease of trade as tue result of monopoly law and after brief discussion broached Question of imperial Airways extension. Minister immediately began to belittle importance to Persia of re-opening the railway, I reminded hirn of dhau he bed told Mr. Dodd: he professed that his previous demand had been prompted solely by general economic consider ations and if trade via Busdap was really so hard hit5018 • j perhaps ai Per ail ip would not he^p^ jjauch ! to l raoT J railway, I dwelt on acknowledged utility of railway in pacification of Baluchistan and Sarhad and said that speaking personally I imagined Persian Government must have other than commercial uses for the railway: Government requirements were anyhow imported free of monopoly law restrictions. However it was of course for Persian Government to decide how much they wonted railway hack before general treaty settlement. His Majesty’s Government were merely replying to reque Persian Government had already made. Minister for Foreign Affairs then reverted to Imperial Airways question and said that his personal advice was 'do not couple the two questions: to do so suggests that His Majesty’s Government are bringing undue pressure to bear on Persia for their own ends”, I replied that questions were inevitably coupled in the view of His Majesty’s Government and there could be no question of unfair pressure. We had been re quested by Persian Government to shoulder for their convenience heavy economic burden of railway ana we were merely stating terms on which we were prepared to make a business transaction. If ior tne p-mpc^es of public opinion Persian Government preferred that there should he no evidence of connexion between the two issues it might he possible to arrange matter but I could predict that in practice it would oe found that Duzdap problem would not be satisxactorily settled before Imperial Airways problem. I would however act on his suggestion uO extent of enquiring without further reference to Duzdap what Persian Government’ s attitude really was towards Imperial Airways extension.J_i.b had irGviiie.ii'tly hsard opposit/ion coins fro'n ■the Army and that Imperial Airways route was supposed to increase unduly British influence in the Gulf, das net tnis can empty theory? An ordinary commercial aeroplane lander once a week for half an hour at Bushire vision and a night at Jask and was subject to super- and numerous restrictions. What possible effect could this have on political situation? Minister for Foreign Affairs as usual took refuge in complete ignorance professing to have no idea why his Government were opposed to extension. He also pretended to think Central Persian route was still a possibility. I asked him to take note forthwith that this was not so. If in spite of unavoidable adverse reaction on public opinion abroad Persian Government were determined to close the Gulf route to foreign enterprise then it was only fair to warn companies concerned in good time as there was naturally much to arrange. Would he therefore bring Question up with Council of Ministers and urge the case for an extension informing me of the result as soon as pos sible? He promised to do so.

You should therefore approach Persian Government in following sense. 'Tv” begins. Closure of Duzdap Railway was due to action of Persian Government in rendering position of personnel intoleratele by refusing to Issue the necessary licences etc. in time. Railway having been closed, His Majesty's Government and Government of India have little induce ment to reopen it, especially as it has long been run at a loss, and restrictions imposed by Persian Govern ment on foreign trade have much diminished its utility. His Majesty's Government and Government of xndia are prepared however in view of Persian representations to consider re-openinv of railv.’ay if Persian Government ■f'hpm in similar mannor, by grunt’ — are prepared to meet them in ^ -nonnnqqion for Imperial Airways to use ing extension of permission • -y^-n+p ''fter March 31st next. (Recent South Persian air route -iter surveysurvey has shown central Persianroute to he Impractic able for a commercial service and other routes will take time to explore.) In that event His Majesty’s Government and Govern ment of India will agree, provided necessary guarantees are given regarding supplies etc. for personnel, to re opening of Duzdap Railway for period corresponding to that for which Persian Government will extend Imperial Airways permit for South Persian route. They suggest that this period might be five years c This arrangement would not necessarily exclude, as part of an eventual general settlement and on the lines suggested, transfer to Persia of Persian section of line.

Tills important modification made it impossible for me to dictate terms as to the continuation of the supply. I learnt,However, that the G.O.C. was most anxious to maintain the pipe-line,but at a loss as lo how to repair it. Having ascertained from the Hallway authorities that the earthenware pipes intended for its repair are now lying at Dalbandin &amp; are of no great value, I tola the u-.O.G. that I would suggest for the consideration of the Government of India that these pipes be presented to the Persian Government on the conditions that - 1. The water required for our buildings at Ilrjawa should be guaranteed, free of all payment. 2. That water for our levies at ileh Safid, just over the frontier should be given at Hirjawa,if required, either by delivery by camels or by means of a small pipe to the fort, should we desire to put one in. The G.O.G. immediately replied that he could of his own initiative gusirantee the continued supply of water &gt; our buildings &amp; permission to draw water for ileh if id by camel, but that the (question of putting in a lall pipe would require the sanction of his Government, it that if the matter be referred to him he would support .1 the proposed arrangements. Now that traffic on the road Between Mirjawa &amp; hundi i likely to increase greatly &amp; will include the regular carriage££6 01 mails ate X would Levy post of fileh Safid shoula suggest that the former f/ 06 re °ocupiea, as the road is at present very poorly auarriort « ST v y tjUaraea &amp; for a considerable distance is within easy „-p „ ... ay reach of raiding parties from Afghanistan. It was because of the possibility of our re- ® Soupy mg .H oh Safid, that I thought it prudent to include its water supply in the conditions of our possible gift of the water pipes to the Persians. In the agreement regarding the boundary at Mirjawa made in 1905 one the clauses had been that the post at Padaha (which is presumably another name for ;ileh Safid) shoula he permitted to draw water at Mirjawa. Xf my proposals meet with the approval of the Government of India,I would suggest that his Majesty’s Charge d* Affaires at lehran, might be asked to obtain the concurrence &lt; of the Persian ministry of foreign Affairs to bhe proposed arrangements at Mirjawa, since a purely local arrangement might be aisputed at some future date. .Doubtless the G.O.C. will have reported, our conversation &amp; supported the propo sals. On receipt of the Persian Governments consent to the arrangement ,&amp; with the approval of the Government of India by whom authority might kindly be given to the Bailway Dept, to hand over the pipes lying at Jalbandin to my representative, I would arrange for the G.O.C. to collect the pipes,at their expense, from Dalabandin. he has already signalled his consent to transport the pipes, it presented.

The Admiralty, who were present at the meeting, were reluctant to agree, attaching greater importance (from their point of view) to securing a lease for 25 years of the Naval station at Henjam in return for reopening the railway. They have since, however, withdrawn their objection. c Mr. Benn yesterday indicated his strong preference for the use of the Duzdap Railway to secure our air desiderata . Lord Amulree is of the same opinion and the First Sea Lord, I understand, has now also concurred. The draft telegram of instructions to Tehran which has been prepared by the Foreign Of.fice and a copy of which is now attached is with Mr. Henderson, and may be brought up by him in the Cabinet to-day if this question comes up for discussion (or to-morrow morning if its discussion is adjourned until then). I submit that it is satisfactory from our point of view, and cnao I migi.it be authorised to inform the Foreign Office that we concur in it, as amended in pencil. From their telegram of 16th July on P.Z. 4550/31, it will be seen that the Government of India were prepared to resume the running of trains on/ ■■■on the Persian section in return merely for a 'sat is fact guarantee of reasonable treatment' for the railway staff ?hey were inclined to favour usingthe reopening of the railway to secure an extension o^ - our concession at Hen jam. The idea of using it instead to secure an extension of our air concession does not seem to have occurred to them. There can he no question which is the more important of the two from the Indian point of view and it is, I think, unnecessary formally to consult them before get tin this telegram on.. The Foreign Office attach the greatest importance to despatching it if poss to-morrow at latest, in view of the danger that delay on our part ray result in a loss of the diplomatic initiati had, however, better send a simultaneous telegram to the Government of India, and I attach a draft. ].ble ve f &lt;TV^ Z£k. 1/%/A. fC—' ^vv^r ua S IkL'T ^ (Q, ^ C^JLU [rt 0-J. 4j-Jl .

This lg in tana*! to show that all tha armrmnta breoftht forward in tha prlrato talopraphic oorraapondanoa with lehran hava been fully oonaidarad. 2. It soaraa Important to make it olaar that tha actual closure of tha railway was duo to Persian action, an 1 that it was not merely a trick on tha part of K.U.C. with the objaot of securing the concession we are now asKlng for, ieSa the South Persian route* 3* The Persians will no doubt argue that the railway could be re-opened without any quid-pro quo as soon as the difficulties which necessitated its closure have boon disposed of* it seams important to make it clear that, the Persiana having forced us to cloae the railway, a new situation has arisen justifying a new demand on our part. 4. This is intended to make it clear that we are proposing a straighV-forward business deal, and that there is no question of 'generous gestures' on either side. 5. This is intended to show that the situation has been recently modified by the fact that the Central route, which the Persians proposed, has just been proved im practicable* This makes it the more natural that ./e should choose this moment to revive the question of extended permission for the South Persian route. 6. The reference to an alternative is intended to show the Persians that our object in pressing for an ax tension Is not merely to use the South Persian route as a means of permanently strengthening our political position in the Sulf. It la also Intended to suggest that the possibility of our finding an altcrnatiTe Is not excluded, since If the Persians feel that we are really entirely dependent on the South Persian route for through communication to India they will naturally raise • # #ra ia9 their terma. W 9 have already made public allu alon to the posaibiiity of developing the Arabian route. If the Feraiana think we ^ould a till be pre -a red to fall back on the Arabian route they may be more .ining to do a deal between th, South Persian route and the Duzdap Kailway. 7. This is stated oatagodaally because it is obvious that we do desire suoh an extension, and if we ware to use a milder phrase it would probably ohly maice the Persians think that we were even keener on getting the concession than we are* 8« It wa,’, agreed at the interdepartmental meeting on July 29 that it was of the utmost importance that the two periods should correspond exactly and be absolutely interdependent so that if at any time the Persians should try to close the South Persian air route we could retaliate immediately by re-closing the Dusdap Hallway. 9. I much doubt whether the Persians will agree to so long a period. But it seems better to ask for five years, and possibly eventually agree to two, than to ask for two or three and have nothing on which to yield. 10. The Persians will want to know how the present suggestion affects our proposals for handing over to them the Persian section of the railway as part of the proposed general settlement. It therefore seems necessary to make it clear that the present provisional arrangement is without prejudice to the main question.jTM. Document i, tt, P WH , „ B „ JECRET. C.P. (31)196. Copy Ho..

My ironed!ately preceding telegram summarises telegram repeated hy Bushire to Government of India. In urgent letter of protest which I have today addressed to Minister for Foreign Affairs I lay stress on importance of station to international shipping and undesirahility of having to announce to maritime interests concerned closure of station with out any warning hy Persian Government. I assume action is work of some local authority ignorant of point reached in general treaty negotiations regarding Henjam wireless station and of arrangement for main tenance of status quo in the Gulf and I ask that immediate instructions he issued for unsealing of station. System of wireless licences has heen in operation for over a yearn and in practice Government has monopoly of transmitting apparatus. (End of 'R\) I suspect that this is first move in retaliation for Duzdap withdrawal and may he intended to accelerate acquiescence in demand reported in my telegram of 13th instant No. 149. Minister for Foreign Affairs will prohahly pretend as before that withdrawal of railway was • • •was firso breach 01 status quo in which case I shall emphasize involuntary and reluctant character of our action and. voluntary and aggressive character of theirs. But this incident adds weight to conclusions arrived at in my telegram of the 21st instant No. 156 regarding the importance of bartering Duzdap settle ment for Kenjam lease. Hen jam station is essential for Bahrein wireless and presumably it is only a matter of time before police officer realizes inadequacy of action he has so far taken. It is difficult at this stage to determine whether this is an attempt by the Persian Government actually to close down the wireless station or is merely by way of a further reminder as to how precarious our position at Henjam is. If Persian Government should intimate their willingness to 're-open” the station subject to licence being obtained should Resident in the Persian Gulf advise the Company to apply (a) if licence is gratuitous (b) if it is to be paid for?

Mr - Rerdel telephones that Sir L.

He is sending a private telegram to-day, the gist of which is that the Foreign Office agree that the Persian attitude affords an opportunity of pressing for one of our desiderata in return for the Duzdap Railway; that the Foreign Office are not, however, satisfied that Henjam is the best; and that they would be glad to know Mr. Podd's opinion of the probability of our securing an extension of Imperial Airways' concession were we to decide to press for this. Mr. Dodd is to make no approach even of the most tentative character to the Persians and no statement on the question of the air route until he gets further instruct ions.

Please see previous submission 0Y1 i~\ Lolcr-. ^e have not had a detailed timetable from the Government of India, but from the papers available it would appear that the Duzdap Railway was closed down and its personnel withdrawn in the early part of this month. The next train due to proceed along it from India was on 22nd July, and the Government of India had intended that this should stop at Nok Kundi . Please see now Mr. Dodd's telegrams 149 and 150 on P.Z. 4500/31, which speak for themselves. The Government of India’s comments will be found on * P.Z. 4550/31. On the whole, the Department was inclined to think that the tactics recommended by Mr. Dodd in his cypher telegram 150 of 13th July preferable to those suggested by the Government of India. But the Government of India's telegram is of value as indicating that they are prepared to consider maintenance of the railway despite the substantial loss involved, subject to acceptance by Persia of the •b _ terms already offered to her and to the additional provisions for reasonable treatment for the staff employed in Persia (in the natter of imports of food, etc.) and the proviso contained in paragraph 5 of their telegram.* Sir F. Stewart suggested on Mr. Dodd's telegram that we should seize this opportunity to consider getting an extension of the air route concession in return for reopening the railway. This was communicated demi-officially to the Foreign Office. The Head of the Eastern Department is strongly/ (1strongly in favour of this suggestion and has urged it on his higher authorities. They are rather unconvinced and inclined to think that we should, as before, avoia ■ ''•-u, : any favours from the Persians. But in the light^of^their views the draft telegram attached has been prepared^, in • consultation with this Department. The draft is less direct than we could have wished, but the domestic differences in the Foreign Office are to a large extent the explanation of this. I submit that, subject to certain verbal alterations, we may concur in it. It will have the effect of drawing Mr. Dodd about the air route (and while he is new to the post, he has the ? • * • ^vantage in the Oriental Secretary, Mr. Havard, of a very experienced observer with intimate knowledge of Persia). As regards Henjam, there is, I think, force in the Foreign Office objections to raising it. But if it is decided that there is no hope of progress on the basis of a bargain in respect of the air route, then we might again consider the possibility of using Henjam. The verbal alterations suggested are shown on page 2 of the telegram. That at A is a correction on a point of fact. It seems desirable to insert the suggestion at B by way of making it clear that we support the various supplementary requests which the Government of India put forward. As Mr. Baxter points out, Sir L. Oliphant may substantially modify the telegram; but the Department might perhaps be authorised to concur in it in itn mudifi ef* without further submission, unless the alterations are of real importance. •» IFstrongly in f his higher au 1 inclined to tl r any favours f views the dra consultation ' The wished, but t, are to a larg that, subject in it.

July 14th 1931. ihe head of the English section of Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked to see me yesterday. As 1 suspected he enquired on what terms Duzdap railway could he re-opened. He asked me for a copy of Sir R. Clive's letter dated October 1st stating terms of a final settlement of railway question as it could not he traced in the archives - see my despatch No.488 of 1930. After some conversation about the railway he remarked that general treaty could he' concluded and signed if only lease of Iamb could be arranged. He spoke as if by direction of Minister for Foreign Affairs. As this statement was of such importance verification from Minister for Foreign Affairs himself seemed essential. I saw the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning. His Highness stated that closure of,the railway was causing inconvenience and enquired why it had been closed and on what terms it could be re-opened. I replied that Persian government themselves rather than Government of India had closed it. The personnel were without food owing to Persian government’s restriction of imports and had to be evacuated as permission to import hadcome tioo latjp ' v * , , ‘ ■'' Lu h -S im 3es denied this but I Pleaded that relevant Vailu aa ' 8&lt;3 Proved it. i gave v, irTS copy of the ln^ i b 6 nim e ' Juer 8X1(1 he enquired if its uerms were still ava^i^hin T ava.iaDre.

He replied that we had created a new situation there to which I retorted that the situation of the Bahreinis had also changed for the worse. He demurred to thn.s on uhe usual lines. He argued also that telegraphs were being settled separately. I said that on my view of the situation I could not recommend to you a separate settlement. Why should Goveinnieni/ of India lose £60,000 a year on a line of secondary importance and receive no concession in return? His Highness observed that my attitude, was not kind and if I refused to entertain question o.l re-opening he would make his own dispositions. I replied that 1 would forward his enquiry to you Puu could not recommend it. He insisted that at least a provisional arrangement for working of line as before could be reached. I promised to telegraph and meanwhile he will study the above- mentioned letter. He informed me on my enquiry that he had given no authority for broaching Tamb question. Hereminded me that suggestion of lease had been made by Minister of Court and disclaimed responsibility xcr it ana for failure to pursue it.

I could detect no disposition at all to resume negotiations for a general treaty and I cannot assure you that a refusal to reopen railway except by an arrangement forming an integral part of a general treaty would create such disposition. Inconvenience of closure to Persian authorities is confirmed by His majesty's Consul at Eirjand but I cannot gauge its precise value as a lever in negotiation. 2. We might select one of our desiderata e.g., Henjam and make satisfaction in respect of it a prior condition to reopening of railway. 3. Danger, as I see it, of refusal to reopen, even provisionally, is possibility that Persian Government might conceivably retaliate for creation of a 'new situation' by creating a new situation for us e.g., at Hen jam or in respect of Residency at Bushire - Minister for Foreign Affairs appeared, rather angry. 4. Best course, which I recommend with all diffidence, is to recognise that general t-reaty is in abeyance and, in return for a definite arrangement for railway on some such lines as letter above referred to, bargain for a satisfactory definite settlement of e.g., Henjam protocol. Per Siam Government seem eager to securesecure early reopening and would prefer provisional arrangement on old conditions. If we refuse this hut show willingness go res-ch definite settlement without delay they might concede a quid pro quo immediately.

Owing to the recent law creating a mono- poly in foreign trade there have been no clearances from the Duzdap (Zahidan) Customs and all trade is at a standstill. The Persian Government having refused to reconsider the question of enhanced cus toms on goods already lying in the Customs, the Government of India sanctioned, as a special case, the re-export to India of a quan tity of sugar. 6,731 bags were so re-export ed on March 19th to various destinations in the north of India. The heavy surplus thus disposed of the price of sugar at Zahidan has risen from Krs. 120 to Krs. 140 per Indian maund (80 lbs.). Details of the new law are not yet known locally, but traders are everywhere appre hensive of their future. Most British Indians are in a bad way, as they cannot even close down their businesses, the majo rity having outstanding debts to collect which will take a considerable time. 348 i 9 3 &lt;&amp;nd HLain, for It is rumoured that the Zahidan Customs Have received instructions that the import hibited^ 0Wlng articleS wil1 be totall y P r °- Liquors, woollen and cotton piece-goods and silk goods, haberdashery, leather goods, oilman s Stores and lorries and trucks. It is said that only cars the value of which does not exceed Ts. 3,000 will be imported and then only with the sanction of the Control Commission. Two cars only (both Fords) have arrived at Zahidan during the month* but delivery from the Customs has not been sanctioned. With the permission of the Control Com mission Krans to the value of Krs. 7,50,000 were exported from Duzdap by Sindhi traders. 4,586 maunds of petrol valued at Rs. 40,770 were brought in via India by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. \\ 1 1!

In any case I imagined that annual value would not exceed 2 or 3 thousand rupees.

It may be explained that they originally arose from the suspicions of the Persian Customs Department that the railway ration contractor was importing more than was actually necessary for the consumption of the staff of the railway. The matter was the subject of considerable discussion in 1928, consequent on a threat that failing payment of customs duties (and arrears) the ration train would not be allowed to proceed. The Persians were finally persuaded to allow the train to pass, although they did not in any way abandon their claim to the duty. ^ In May of this year the Consul at Birjand reported that instructions had been received from Tehran that the issue of rations was not to be permitted. Strong representations at Tehran succeeded in securing from the Minister of Foreign Affairs an exceptional permission for the ration train of 8 th May. The next train is due about 8 th June. 3. Sir Robert Clive on 1st May that, failing a satisfactory understanding in respect of the ration train then due, he had no objection to the closing down of the Persian section of the railway. He added that the new Trade Monopoly Law 'must already have reduced British export trade via Duzdap to negligible proportions'. A. *J On 18th May he that fs- il:Ln S initiation by the Persian Government of discussion about the Duzdap Railway before the next ration train was due, and in the eventOf their then declining to admit it under the old arrangements, his considered view was that the railway should he Closed, 'nothing less would bring the Persian Government to reason'. The Government of India's views are se t out in their telegram of 23rd May on P.Z.3318. It seems clear that they are quite prepared to close the railway in the event of the Persians adopting a difficult attitude and that they anticipate that it would be possible to remove all stores, stock, etc., from the Persian section within ten days. 4 , The Government of India’s telegram, has been discussed informally with the Foreign Office. The Eastern Department are strongly in favour of closing the railway down altogether, irrespective of the arrangements about the ration train, since its economic value is now apparently greatly reduced, its bargaining ' value in negotiations with Persia has long been accepted as small, and it represents a commitment v/hich, although i of little if any positive advantage to us,affords the Persians a means of pinpricking and is not unlikely to give rise to further difficulties in the future. They recognise, however, that Sir Robert Clive has probably already taken action on the Government of India’s telegram and that, in view of the necessity for consultation with India, it would probably be impossibly to decide on a policy of this nature before the next ration train is due. They are in dined, to think, in view of the^ probability that even if the Persians are amenable about the June ration train similar difficulties are likely to arise before very long, it would be desirable to ascertain the Government of India’s views on the question of closing down altogether, f - * Having regard to the present state of our relations with Persia and the turn negotiant ions have taken/I Minute Paper.

Withdrawal might be advantageous not merely as reducing an outlying commitment in Persia which was no longer of any special value to us, but as indicating to the Persians (whose local administration will certainly be hampered by the withdrawal of the railway) that if they chose to adopt an obstructive attitude there wea&amp;e limits to our patience. I do not think that a withdrawal need necessarily have any adverse effect on the general negotiations. In the first place these are for practical purposes suspended, while apart from this it is open to us to take the line that the long delay which has taken place in considering the propositions made by us about this railway, the Persian section of which is run definitely at a loss to us, Oias made it impossible to postpone a decision longer and that we have therefore been obliged to dismantle^ that portion of it which lies within Persian territory. t I suggest for consideration draft telegrams to Tehran and to the Government of India to be sent, if approved, with Foreign Office concurrence (Incidentally, quite apart from the question of future policy.it seems desirable that an important decision such as the present should be taken only with the explicit approval of the Secretary of State and not by the Government of India in consultation with the Minister at Tehran,without reference on the part of either to the Home Government). 27. v-^ \1 I ■ ijm 5155 5000 2/31 I • W ' ■ ■ ' —^ • IIUUHWI 1 U WM - 0-1 V / 3% Draft Paper.

It has been suggested that if an agreement is reached with the Persian Government and they take over the section of the Railway between Mirjawa and Duzdap, they may, in view of the fact that the Government of India has worked the section at a loss, decide to increase the rates of freight and passenger fares over it, a measure which might seriously diminish the volume oi trade over the Duzdap route. 3. The Government of India are not inclined to attach too much weight to this apprehension, since it is obvious that a diminution of trade would affect Persian as well as fndian interests. it would in any case appear impossible to ask the Persian Government to bind themselves charge^ 0 . Offg. foreign Secretary to the Government of India. charge the same rates as obtain on the British section. They consider nevertheless that it is on the whole desirable that if His Majesty's Government see no objection, His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, may be instructed, when negotiations on this question axe resumed, to seek to secure the inclusion of a further clause in the proposed agreement to the effect that neither party should make any alteration in their rates and fares without giving three months' notice or such '— - shorter period as may be mutually agreed upon. 4.

General Observations .—As foretold in the Diary for September 1930 the Bazaar rate for rupees at Duzdap increased to from 8—10 Krans per rupee in Novem ber. The National Bank appears to have lost control of the situation. Although no transactions took place openly it is known that many thousands of rupees changed hands in the Bazaar at S 10 Krans. It may be said that a new form of income has arisen for the not inconsider able class of persons who “ live by their wits” as a result of the exchange restrictions. A case came to the notice of His Majesty’s Consul in which a traveller imported rupees. He was not well conversant with the regulations in this connection. He was approached by an individual who offered to buy the rupees at about 7 Krans, but having learnt that the bazaar rate was in the neighbourhood of 9 Krans he decided to sell elsewhere, whereupon the disappointed would-be purchaser turned informer, with the result that the rupees were confiscated, the owner being guilty of transgressing the law re-sale of foreign exchange and the informer duly received a considerable proportion of the confiscated money as reward. He thus safely played the game of “ Heads 1 win, Tails You lose ”. There can be no doubt that a good deal is made in “ Blackmail ” by unscrupulous persons who come to know of private transactions in the bazaars. Optimism prevailed at Duzdap among the Indian importers of tea and sugar during October, owing to the shortages of stocks which had previously existed up-country. Past experience of the futility of flooding the market did not discourage the scramble for easy profits and the inevitable disillusionment took place in November, when it was found that Persian traders who had purchased heavily in September were not only fail ing to repeat orders but in many cases failed also to meet their obligations for September purchases. This is not surprising inasmuch as the sugar imported in October was sold to Persians for the interior at a profit of Rs. 10 per maund, while they experienc ed a loss on resale of Ts. 2 per maund. Tea suffered the same fate as sugar. At the end of November it is estimat ed that there were in Duzdap about 3,000 bags (Md. 2 seers 28 each) of sugar still unsold. Traders appear likely to lose on the swings of November what they gained on the round abouts of September and October. In fact trade during the past three months has been a complete gam ble, in which the only gainers appear to have been the Persian Government in the matter of Customs receipts. Persians purchased sugar and tea at high rates and sold at a loss while they sold Persian produce for export at equally high rates to Indians, who similarly in curred loss on disposal in India. On the whole the Indian traders are likely to get the worst of the deal, for many of them invested capital in India igr^951(C) F&amp;PD in the purchase of tea and sugar which they either cannot sell, or in the cases where sale took place find their capital automatically converted into Krans for which they have no use. Such products as are available for export, such as carpets, silk lungis, etc., have so greatly fallen in price in India owing to the re cent excess export in the scramble to obtain Indian currency by sales in India, that sales cannot now be effected at all, or at such a great loss as to more than swallow up any prospects of profits on fresh imports—sugar and tea being for the time being no longer profitable. As a result of these transactions (over trading in sugar and tea) it is often noticed that Indians who have large Kran capital in Persia, cannot raise enough Rupee cash to pay for a railway ticket to India, except by illegal bazaar transactions at exorbitant rates. In Sistan importers of tea and sugar direct from India reaped a good harvest for a short time. They also now find themselves with their capital in Krans and unable to do any further business. Several have closed their businesses, but the majority are unable to do so as they have considerable sums due from Persians. The collection of outstanding debts is rendered more difficult than it might be, owing to the absence of any court of Law at Sistan. Sugar .—See remarks under preceding paragraph. The Customs dues collected at Duzdap on this commodity amounted to Krs. 650,483 in October and Krans 10,07,348 in November, while the Monopoly Tax revenue was Krans 8,21,662/80 in October and Krans 12,72,439/20 in November.

I enclose a copy of a letter sent from the Commercial Secretary to Messrs Andrew Weir and Company of Baghdad about an enquiry by the Persian Railways Department regarding certain material required for the Zahedan Railway. Our policy here is to give the Railways Department all possible assistance in regard to enquiries of this sort, while making it as plain as possible that the fulfilling of any orders depends on political factors regarding which they must approach us through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The material covered by the present enquiry is for the most part (i.e. the three trolleys) evidently required for keeping the section of the railway lying in Persian territory in order; the remainder (i.e. the pipes) may conceivably have something to do with the water supply at Zahedan or more probably at Mirjawa. I presume that the Government of India would, if approached by Messrs Andrew Weir and Company, refuse to allow the trolleys to be run along the line between Nok Kundi and Mirjawa, even if the line is in suitable condition./ H.A.F.

I am certainly in favour of a refusal myself (c.f. my telegram Saving No. 5 of March 12th ) and until the Persian section has been formally transferred I think we have every right to behave (in appearance) as dogs in the manger. My only doubt is as to the pipes. We do not want the water supply of the Vice-Consulate or the Indian Exchange Post Office to be affected: Hivett-Carnac may possible be able to say whether there is any danger of this and until we hear further it might be as well to preserve an open mind.

It will be noticed that delivery is requested at Mirjawa. As the Indian Railways do not run beyond Nok Kundi now, and the line has not been in operation for about two years the Railway Department suggested verbally that you might endeavour to obtain permission from the competent department of the Government of India to use the line, if it is in suitable condition, to run the trolleys up to Mirjawa, the motor trolley towing the other two. You would be well advised to make full enquiries on this point from the Indian authorities before finally accpeting any orders.

XXX SECRET. 917. Your telegram dated 11th April 852. Matter has 'been further considered with Foreign Office and Board of Trade. With every anxiety on our part to help you and full appreciation of your difficulties we feel extremely doubtful as to possibility of any advance on lines you suggest. 2 . I will not stand in the way of action suggested in paragraph 2 (a) so long as it is clearly understood that in no circumstances will the act become operative unless and until agreement had been reached with Persians and other foreign countries affected, if after consideration of point taken in next paragraph you think it worth while to pass such legislation. 3. Foreign Office advise that despite apparently relatively small amounts involved prospect of securing Persian^ concurrence in action you propose save on terms which will be quite disproportionately severe is for practical purposes very slight. You eppreciate that if the import duty is replaced by a consumption tax Persian cotton imported by land which now enters duty free would become subject to the new tax. In these circumstances there is the serious risk that legislation if passed could never in fact be implemented with the result that Government would be in a worse position vis-a-vis Bhavanagar and vis-a-vis■2. Indian opinion. Having regard to the slender chance of obtaining the concurrence of the Persian Government. I do not think that it would be wise to run this risk and would advise that before legislating the Persian Government should first be approached as suggested below. 4 . I should explain, with reference to paragraph 2(b) of your telegram, that in view of Foreign Office, with which I agree, offer to meet Persian wishes over Duzdap Railway would be quite ineffective, i/e are already committed to meeting their wishes as part of satisfactory treaty settlement. Only line on which matter could be taken up with Persia in event of your taking action on lines suggested in 2 above would be that Minister should in the first instance approach Persians treating matte, as one of no importance and endeavour to secure their written consent (oral assurances would not suffice) without any specific q uid p ro quo ; secondly, that if, as Foreign Office imagine no advance was possible on these lines, he should offer them some s^all concession which could be divorced from treaty negotiations. Only concession that occurs to us is undertking that railway material/rollTing stock to be handed over in connection with reopening of Duzdap Railway should be handed over free of charge. As you will appreciate prospects of advance on these lines are not very great, and in any case there would be considerable delay. 5. One other suggestion has been put forward here which you may think worth considering and which would seem to offer some prospect of securing Persian consent, viz. that the consumption duty if imposed should be at a3 . rate which would reduce the total amount payable in respect of Persian imports of raw cotton. 6 . Paragraph 4 of your telegram. Board of Trade and Foreign Office consider that substitution of licence for duty would not enable you to get over difficulty vis-a-vis Persians. I agree.X 17 4 . It should be noted that the words/. . . . de Tescla/age et . . . . which appeared in the fourth line of Article 4 in the version already authorised, have now been deleted. The word “ esclavage does not appear in the treaty article or in the preamble to the proto/, and as the agreement refers only to maritime control, “ la traite ” is sufMent. There is, too, a danger that the Persians might otherwise claim an ipferest in the interim! affairs of the Arab Sheikhdo^^ article ^ et ” been replaced by “ ou dans.’' Article XI.—Zahedan (Duzday) Railway. 1 . A final decision regarding the wording of the treaty article and protocol was not reached till mid-January 1934; the text then adopted will be found in Annex D below. -r T - ™ • . &gt; -d 2. The attached copies of correspondence between His Majesty s .Repre sentatives at Tehran and the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs show the previous history of the question in sufficient detail. Briefly, in October 1930, when the negotiations were on the point of breaking down, Sir R. Clive submitted to Feroughi a memorandum outlining the British terms (the actual wording of this memorandum, it may be noted, had not been approved by His Majesty’s Government). No notice was taken of the memorandum until September 1931, when the Persians, inconvenienced by the closure of the railway in June of that year, intimated their acceptance of the British proposals, in the hope of securing the immediate reopening of the railway in advance of a treaty settlement. In announcing this acceptance of “ the tenor of the British memorandum,” Feroughi put forward a French draft of his own which, though corresponding in essentials to Sir R. Clive’s terms, contained certain omissions and alterations of secondary importance. On the 1 st November, 1931, Sir R. Hoare sent Feroughi a reply, in which he took note of the Persian acceptance of the British proposals, and stated that, notwithstanding the altered conditions then obtaining, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to regard the proposals “ as constituting an agreement to come into force as part of a wider settlement,” subject to one minor addition, viz., a paragraph providing for reasonable notice to be given in the event of either party wishing to increase the freight rates and fares on their section of the stretch between Zahedan and Nushki. No mention was made of Feroughi’s draft in this reply. 3. The Persian Government have made repeated efforts to secure the reopening of the railway in advance of the treaty settlement. The only occasion on which His Majesty’s Government responded to these advances was in August 1931, when an offer was made to reopen the railway in exchange for a prolongation of the permission accorded to Imperial Airways, Limited, to use the South Persian route. This offer was not accepted by the Persians. 4. Meanwhile, at Sir R. Hoare’s suggestion, the Government of India recently furnished His Majesty’s Legation with a draft contract for the purchase 3 y the 'Persian Government of the necessary railway material, and this contract was in due course communicated to the Railway Department at Tehran (who had rsked for it in December 1932) with a covering intimation that delivery could be iffected within a stated period from the conclusion of an agreement for the transfer of the Persian section of the line.

It has, however, long been realised by His Majesty Government that before a satisfactory treaty settlement can be obtained t is remaining £510,000 will almost certainly have to be remitted, and it has now been decided to give His Majesty’s Minister full discretion to make the oiler of its remission at the moment which he considers most suitable and without prior reference to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom or tte Government of India. Article XIII. — Claims, 1 . No British draft has yet been submitted to the Persians. 2 . In February 1932 Teymourtache proposed the following :— Les Hautes Parties Contractantes sont convenues de regler les reclama- | tions existantes des sujets de 1’une des parties a 1’egard du Gouvernement &lt;h 1 ’autre par un protocole qui sera signe entre leurs representants respeetns ou la modalite de 1 ’examen, la resolution du differend concernant ladite reclamation et sa liquidation seront indiquees. 3. In putting forward this draft, Teymourtache said that what he had in mind was the establishment of a claims commission and the definition of the commission’s functions. 4. The obvious objection to the draft from the point of view of Majesty s Government is that it relegates the whole process to the indefinite future. The protocol (if a protocol rather than an annex is finally decided on) will have to be agreed on before the conclusion of the treaty, and will presumabi)frb/btp/ljc/em DECYPHER OF TELEGRAM From Government of India, Finance Department, (COPIES to Secretary of State for India, CIBCtfLATED) Dated Mew Delhi, 11th April, X934 0 Received 11th April, 1934, 1*15 p„mo IMMEDIATE S5B .

FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 20th Decemher, 1933 (E 7257/38/34). With reference to your official letter No. P.Z. 7667/33 of the 27th November on the subject of the drafting of the treaty article and protocol concerning the Zahedan railway, I send you herewith a revised draft in which we hope that you and the Government of India will be able to concur. 2. You will see that we have incorporated in this revised draft both the points dealt with in the Government of India’s telegram No. 2784 which was enclosed in your letter. As regards the first of these fi&amp;e. the insertion of the sentence 'Cette partie de la 'ligne sera operee par le gouvernement de Sa Majeste 'Imperiale le Schah' in Article 2) there is of course no difficulty: as I explained in my letter of the 16th October to Walton, we doubt whether this insertion was really/ . Laithwaite, Esq.*really essential tut we are quite prepared to accept it. regards ttis second of tlie Government of India’s two stipulations, wnile we agree that this is perfectly reasonable, we fear that it is likely to prove unpalatable to the Persians, who, as you may remember, took the initiative in suggesting the relegation of the point in question to a subsidiary agreement to be negotiated separately after the main agreement had come into force. However, if the Persians raise difficulties on this head, it will always be open to us to say that we for our part are quite willing to proceed at once to the discussion of the subsidiary agreements, and if possible to get them settled in advance of the entry into force of the general treaty. 4. You will see that in the new draft we have in one respect gone rather further than the Government of India, and have provided that not only the subsidiary traffic agreement, but also the agreement which will have to be reached regarding the sale of the rolling- stock and other material, should precede the entry into/into force of the agreement as a whole. This appears to us to he a necessary precaution if (as you and the Government of India hold) the new insertion in Article 2 is really required. 5. Apart from this you will see that we have now removed Article 5 of the earlier draft ('Draft A'), inserting the gist of it in wnat is now Article 6, which in other respects has been considerably expanded. The reason for this is that our Legal Advisers, whom it was unfortunately impossible to consult before we sent you our previous draft, have pointed out that it is desirable on formal and general grounds to insert a clause stating positively wnen and in what circumstances the protocol will expire. In practice it is probable that we should be sufficiently covered by Article 1 (which limits the period of operation of the Indian section to five years), Article 4 (which permits us to cease operation still earlier if the Persians do so too) and the 'old' Article 5 (which contains the vague provision about re-examining the situation after fiveyears have elapsed). And in the last resort - if, that is, the Persians strongly object to the revised wording - our Legal Advisers consider that there would he no great harm in going hack to the earlier version, unless of course the Persian objections to the change show that there is real reason to suppose that the previous text was open to misinterpretation. Nevertheless the amended version, as I have said, seems to them preferable on grounds of form, and should, we think, at least be put to the Persians with a suitable explanation to this effect. I feel that the Government of India are not likely to have any objection to this amendment, the effect of which is to safeguard their position still further. 6. The insertion of the word ’‘comprise’' in the first sentence of Article 2 is of course merely for the sake of neatness, and has no special significance. 7. You will probably be sending a copy of this letter and of the new draft to the Government of India, and as treaty negotiations may perhaps be starting again at any moment now it would, I suggest, be as well if the Government/Government of India might he asked to telegraph their concurrence or comments, to you only if the negotiations have not started, and to Hoare also (to whom I am sending a copy of this letter) if they have.8 ^ HOKFIDEirciAL. Copy of letter Ho. 423-15/5, dated Camp.Meshad the 2nd October, 1933 from Hie Majesty’s Consul-General Sistan and Kain, and Agent to the Government of India in Khorassan, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department •wow Delhi I have the honour to refer to my Telegram Ho,411 (Ko.10 to Tehran) of the 27th September, 1933. When the Railway was withdrawn the Persians occupied a number of buildings both at Zahidan and Mirjawa. When the last tram was withdrawing, I preceded it by car to Mirjawa in order secure such buildings as were required by us. One was reserved for the Exchange Post Office, and as the Persian G.O.C. had immediate designs on the Rest House, which is a valuable building, the only well built house at Mirjawa with a good garden, I installed myself therein ana requested the G.O.C’s servants to remove his effects which had been placed in the house pending his arrival by the train. When he x* in due course arrived I explained that the Rest House was in my charge and used by me and sub ordinate Officers when on tour. He raised no objection and withdrew to another building, since which it has been regarded as a building belonging to the Consulate. 2. I have in previous corresponsence suggested the advisability, if rail communication is to be restored, of securing agreement to the Railway Station at Mirjawa which will be worked by us, being handed over to Railway jurisdiction, for such time as the railway will operate. If there be a joint station, under g Persian control, the constant fFi5|^ s whlcTT iro'curred at Zahidan is inevitable, &lt; WDIA FOREIGN SFf~'- | Our j Letter V arc j Date, 9 IV''I V. 1933 i Beoel- /NOV. 1333Our Railway staff have no authority, the Persian police and petty Officials constantly interfere and we have no real redress. My proposal therefore amounts to the - recognition of full controlj(which would ejrable our Railway Police to he present and Indian Railway Regulations to he applied ) within our station, while the Persian section could he adjacent, but separated hy suitable railings, or situated a short distance away. An alternative would he for our frontier station not to he on Persian soil at all, but a few hundred yards away from the present station (which the Persians could then take over) just within our territory. Arrangements would then he necessary with the Persians for the extension of the piped water supply to our station, S. The re-opening of the Railway will inevitably result in the transfer of the Persian Customs to the frontier and this is likely to he followed by the removal of traders also. Moreover, as soon as the new roaa programme in Sistan is completed and all traffic for fiast Persia will pass through ^ahul, nearly all the traders will move their Headquarters to 'abul, maintaining sut- offices where-ever the Customs House is situated.prohaoly at Kirjawa. 4, If these changes take place it will be necessary to have our Vice-Consul at the frontier at Mirjawa where all important work will take place* and travellers will require his assistance. Sven therefore, if the Rest House he not required hy our Railway, it would he a most suitable building for the Vice-Consulate and its sale to the Persians at a very low figure, should, I recommend he avoided. In any case its value will greatly appreciate whenwhen the railway is working, as it could he used suitably as a hotel or business house. The Bank would in all probability move to Kirjawa later and most likely be glad to acquire such a building at a figure much above that quoted to the Persians by the Railway Department.

As regards your proposal to re-insert at the end of the first sentence of Article 2 (of version A) the words 'which will be operated by the latter,' I write to say that we have no objection to this, although in consequence of the opening words of Article 4 ('Pour 'le cas ou la Perse cesserait 1 ’exploitation de 'la par-tie de la ligne qui se trouve en territoire 'persan') our view is that the position would have been sufficiently clear without.

Should the general treaty negotiations break down and settlement of railway question he taken up separately, following are our provisional replies to questions in Hoare’s telegram No. 7 Saving of the 6th May 1933. Replies are subject to revision according to circumstances which may prevail if and when separate settlement is undertaken. (1) What is the lowest urice which Government of India 4 '' ■ will accent for Persian section of Railway? As stated in paragraph 2(d) of our Express Letter (air mail) of the 15th April 1933 break up value is 22*? lakhs. From commercial point of view this is minimum price acceptable but actual price which we would be prepared to take cannot be {Signature) fixed {Designation} i y S. 44. DCF P —beOS&amp;P— (&gt;3 *859) -9*12.29—2 0,000.- 2 - fixed until whatever offer Persian Government roa^/ make for Railway has keen received and considered here. Price would naturally depend upon nature of commercial and other concessions which the Persian Government might he willing to give. ( 2 ) Should there he failure t o agree upon price^ would Piis Majesty*s Governmen t and Government of India^oe preoared to insist on rem oval of rails, etc! We are at present of opinion that removal of the permanent way, buildings, etc. should not he insisted on since any attempt to do so would probably oe forcibly resisted by Persia. (3) What commercial advantages would the Government of India desire for operating the Indi an sectionj. Concession which we desire is entire exemption ox j all goods of Indian origin from provisions of Trade Monopoly Lav/ which has been a real hinderance to Indian trade. (4) as alternative to sale would Government —of—India be willing to transfer Persian section an d keep .Indian.. section open for sav IQ yea rs on condition bhat -ii .Persi^£i Government made good annual deficit , to extent of, .,Qno.._ ll 1^3fl32. We are not prepared to accept this alternative. As now advised we would not, in any circurnstance^, glvQ an assurance to the Persian Government that the Indian section would be kept open for any specified period. There would be no means of enforcing any undertalcing which the Persian Government might agree to give regarding the making good of the annual deficit on the Indian portion; nor is it certain that one lakh represents the real measur e of the loss involved. (5) Should the Persian Government be encourage d^ to prolong; the railway to Sistan? Sistan is the potential grain producing area of South-Eastern- 3 - South-Eastern Persia and an extension of the railway might assist in its development. A line from Duzdap to Sistan would, however, he extremely expensive to work because of the scarcity of water and the gradients. At the same time, with the conmercial development of Sind as a cotton and grain producing area it is unlikely that Sistan grain and cotton, which at any rate at present are of an inferior quality, would he in a position to compete. As regards imports, even if goods of Indian origin were exempted from the provisions of the Trade Monopoly Law we consider it unlikely that an extension of the railway to Sistan would give any material stimulus to Indian trade. We are, therefore, of opinion that the Persian Government should not he given any encouragement to prolong the line to Sistan and consider that any such encouragement might prejudice our position should we ever desire to abandon the Indian section of the Hushki extension on the ground of unremunenative working. (g) yjoiild the Government of India in anv circqifc. stances a^rp.R to having the two exchange stations on_ Indian soil? We would naturally prefer a site on the frontier itself or on the Indian side of it, hut practical difficulties make this impossible. Mirjawa is the only place near the border which has a suitable water supply, the nearest station on the Indian side which would answer the purpose being Dalbandin, some 200 miles distant. The exchange stations must, therefore, be at Mirjawa, dux we regard it as absolutely essential for the satisfactory working of the two portions of the railway that the North Western Railway should have its own terminus set apart for its exclusive use and with its own water rights, one Persian- 4 ~ Persian Railway Administration toving an adjacent station under its own control. It will also de necessary for the Persian Government to give to the North-Western Railway absolute control over the portion of the line from the frontier to the exchange station at Mirjawa&lt;&gt; 4.

Z. 1 ) ^1933 J My dear Walton, Many thanks for your letter No.p.Z.6379/33 of the 6th Octoher regarding the drafting of the proposed treaty article and protocol relative to the Zahedan Railway. 2. We agree to all your emendations save two, about which we are doubtful. You suggest that a clause should be inserted in Article E of the Protocol to the effect that the Persian Government will operate their section of the line so long as the Government of India operate theirs. This suggestion seems to us to raise certain difficulties. 3. In the first place it appears to stultify Article 4 of the Protocol, which clearly implies the freedom of the Persians to cease exploiting their section at any time. If the Persians are to en^loy no / such ' 'alton, 3sq., C.3.,M.C.such freedom (and your suggestion would deprive them of it) then Article 4 will become meaningless, in that it will provide only for a case which could not arise so long as the agreement is observed. 4. For this reason we should much prefer to leave the text as it is in this respect; as you knew, the Persians are so suspicious of our motives that any extensive alteration of wording is liable to cause trouble. We do not see any real need for a clause exactly balancing the Government of India’s undertaking- in Article 1, since in point of fact the two parties to the agreement are in very different positions: if the Persians close down we are merely inconvenienced, whereas if we close down, the Persian section becomes valueless. Therefore it is surely logical that the Government of India should be the one to guarantee to continue exploiting their section for a given period, merely safeguarding; themselves from inconvenience by means of the provisions in Article 4. 5. But let us suppose for the moment that your suggestion were adopted. Ivan then there is no clausewhich really balances the Grovernment of India’s undertaking in Article 1. They only promise to continue operating for five years, (and then only subject to the proviso in Article 3), whereas according to your version the Persians would be obliged to continue operating their section willy-nilly as long as the Government of India chose to operate the Indian section, their only refuge from this conceivably very irksome obligation being the vague provisions in Article 5 for reconsideration of the situation after the five years were up. Your version would therefore, we think, have to be modified in the sense that the Persian Government would undertake to operate their section of the line for five years from the date of the entry into force of the protocol, or for such lesser period as the section controlled by the Government of India might remain in operation. 6. I enclose two drafts: ’A' contains all the alterations already suggested by us in the annex to Hoare’s draft instructions, plus all those suggested by you in your letter of the 6th October except fa) the one dealt with above, fb) the Suggestion (whichseems to us open to similar objections) that Article 4 of Feroughi’s draft should be re-worded so as to apply equally to both parties. *B 1 is the same as 'A* except for the addition of your suggestion dealt with above, as modified in the manner which seems to us essential. Regarding ’A’ there is little to be said: we agree that ’’sera tenu d’operer” is perhaps a trifle emphatic; ”se chargera de 1’exploitation” is less so, and avoids the rather clumsy word ’’operera', which, however, we will adopt if you wish. In the last line out one of Article 4, ’’aurait” should of course be ”aura'. You will see that we have done into French Hoare’s additional article about changes of tariff, and that we have slightly expanded it in order to bring out the point that this is a question for the local authorities to settle direct between themselves; we hope you will agree. 7. As regards 'B', you will see that in addition to the omission of Article 4 and the modification of your clause in the way suggested in paragraph 5 above, we have introduced certain rearrangements which seem tous desirable, if not absolutely necessary, on grounds of form fthough they would not be necessary if ’A’ were adopted). *3' seems in fact to necessitate recasting a good deal of the protocol, and for the reasons which I have already given I hope that you will not insist on it. 8. In either event, however, I fear that a further telegram to India seems required, and we should therefore be very grateful if you could let us nnow your views as soon as possible.^ 9 j raft Paper. yi Wf, d \ j.W.

It seems important that the protocol should include a definite obligation that the Persian Govt, will operate their section, in order to balance the G. of I.’s obligation to operate theirs.

Please see Foreign Office letter of 20th f\ July on P.2.4314/33 and the earlier correspondence | between the Minister at Tehran and the Government of India on P.2.4180/33, about the reopening of the Duzdap Railway. Action was postponed until the Secretary of State had approved the proposal that we should agree to the resumption of negotiations on Sir R. Hoare's return, since, had he favoured the opposite course, the case for independent handling of the question of the Duzdap Railway would have been much stronger. I 2. The Railway can be dealt with either In isolation or as part of a general treaty settlement. Hitherto it has been inextricably involved with the general treaty settlement .and proposals for reopening and transfer of the Persian section as part of such a settlement have been formally put to ana accepted by the Persian Government. On the other hand, the latest Persian move, as reported in Tehran telegram of 14th July, on P.Z.4180/33, would make it possible for us, if we so wished, to settle the question of the Railway independently and in advance of any treaty settlement. The Government of India may possibly feel disposed to ! favour this course, since, as will be seen from their air mail letter of 15th April, on P.Z.2388/33, the reopening of the line is likely to involve them in rather greater expense than they had originally anticipated, and in the spring of this year, when ! there was, of course, no definite indication of when, of I if &amp;U 3 ?, the general negotiations would be resumed, ! they were of opinion that further concessions additional/I *1 ! I - a - additional to those to which the Persians have already agreed must he obtained from Persia if the Railway was to he reopened. 3 # The Foreign Office, as will he seen from their letter of 20th July, on P.Z.4314, are strongly in favour of dealing with the Railway question as part of the general treaty settlement and the Department agrees that now that it has been generally agreed that negotiations shall he resumed there are strong arguments in favour of retaining the Duzdap Railway as a principal item on our side of the balance sheet until we see what course the negotiations take. If, as is not impossible, they come to nothing, the Railway can then he dealt with in isolation, and the Government of India can, if they think fit, press for some additional concessions of the nature referred to in paragraph 4 of their air mail letter of 15th Aprill But removal at this stage of the Duzdap Railway from our list of possible concessions would still further reduce the chances of any general settlement with Persia, and while it is impossible not to sympathise with the Government of India’s view that since the cost will fall upon them they ought to receive some concession of more specifically Indian interest in return for reopening, we should, I think, be justified in pressing them to leave matters as they are. It is to he hoped that when they appreciate that the negotiations are to be resumed and that the position is therefore not quite on all fours with that when their letter of l$th April was written, they will he ready to agree to this course.

E. In the Secretary of State’s opinion the reopening of the railway, and the transfer to the Persian Government of that part of it which lies on the Persian side of Mirjawa, constitute an important item in the general treaty balance. He welcomes the present evidence that the Persian Government now attach real importance to the question, as indicating that this -bargaining asset in the negotiations has acquired an enhanced value. He would therefore strongly deprecate its being dealt with outside the orbit of the proposed treaty negotiations. 4 - + p trusts that Sir Samuel Hoare 3.
