Political Agency, Bahrain,the 4th June 1932. i think I told you after my first visit to Doha that Husain Yateem,an employee of Major Holmes,had just arrived there and that his visit had excited great interest. it now appears that he had been sent to sound the Shaikh regarding an oil concession. He informed the Shaikh that it was known that the source of the oil now being found in Bahrain arose somewhere in Doha and he asked Jhaikh Abdulla if he would be prepared to grant a concession. The Shaikh told me that he had said that the A.P.O.G had examined his territory sometime back and had left saying they would let him know what was decided,but that he had heard nothing further from them, e told me that he had replied to Husain Yateem that he would not consider any application which we did not support, and that if they wished to apply for a concession they should do so through us. I confirmed this information from private enquiries. Husain Yateem is a young fellow who was educated under Major Holmes' auspices in Brighton,and is a youn.qer Wothor of Muhammad Yateem,who has been shadowing the A.P.O.G activities in Kuwait on behalf of the Eastern and leneral Syndicate. Both are,ofcourse,employees of Major Holmes.' ^on T ble Lt Col Sir H.V.Biscoe,KBJE,I.A. Political Resident in the Persian G-uli, Bu shire.Confidential .

He informed the Shaikh that it was known that the source of the oil now being found in Bahrain arose somewhere in Doha and asked the Shaikh if he would be prepared to grant a concession# The Shaikh replied that he would not consider any application which the British GoTernment did not support, and that if they wished to apply for a concession they should do so through the British authorities. Captain Prior informs me that Husain Yateem is a young man who was educated under Major Holmes* auspices in Brighton, and is a nephew of Muhammad Yateem, who is employed by Major Holmes as a go-between in Kuwait. 2. This is not the first occasion on which the Baster n and General Syndicate have attempted to obtain a concession in qatar.. In 1923 they sought the Resident's permission to approach the Shaikh for a concession and the request was referred to His Majesty^ Government, who considered that the iinglo-Persian Oil Company then had prior claim, and on the 4th April informed them to that effect, ..... » Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, London.

The fact that the Bahrein Betroleun Oorapany has recently struck oil in some quantity would seem to confirm the opiniongof the American geologists, while the recent renewal of interest in the Koweit concession on the part of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company points to that Company's desire to secure a share in the exploitation of the North- iVestern area of the Gulf# 4* It will be recalled that, although the Bahrein concession granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate several years ago and transferred to American control did not include adequate safeguards for British interests, it has been decided that the Koweit concession at present being negotiated with the Eastern and General Syndicate is to contain certain minimum safeguards if it is eventually awarded to that indicate. It now seems likely that the Eastern and Gen oral Syndicate may apply for a concession at v^atar, and that, unless the Anglo- Persian Oil Company also apply for concessions in Koweit and/or Qatar, the Bahrein concession may gradually oe merged into a much larger undertaking, the whole ot which will be under the control of American interests, for the exploitation/ a ItxpIoltutioA of tbo whole of the Korth-, estern area of tho Juif. 5* Uy Lords oonsad«r it to bo of the greatest iaportano© that the safo/^uards u rottd upon for kowoit should oo the ainiaum for ouch an uodartaking* ihoy oonsidor that ao opporUmity of applying tba Koweit eaie^uarde to the Bahrain coooeesion should be aissad aad 8U&amp;?tst that a tavourabla opportunity will aria# if the itastam and 'jaoaral Jyndicate apply for a oooosssioa in v ^atar.

The activities of Major Holraei* agent may be reported briefly to ttje Coionial Office. For facility of reference later,I give below a summary of previous correspondence regarding oil con- -cessions in Qatar. September In 1923 the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate asked the Resident's permission to approach the Shaikh for an oil concession. The request was referred to the Colonial Office, who considered that the A.P.O.C. then had a prior claim. The Colonial Oil ice informed in February 1924 the Syndicate accordingly and informed both them and the A.P.O.C. at the same time that they regarded the time afe unsuitable on general political grounds for such negotlat ions. In October 1925 the A.P.O.C, applied for permiss4 -ion to make a reconnaissance, amonpt other places, across Qatar,and the Colonial Office decided that ther was no longer any prima facle reason for discouraging oil development in Qatar. In -March 1926 Messrs. Lees and Haji Abdullah Williamson visited the Shaikh and obtained from him an undertaking tnat he would not grant a concession to any other party for the next 18 months. They did not follow this up and the Shaikh is now free in this respect, so far as the A.P.O.C. are concerned. I have not been able to trace any papers giving the Eastern &amp; General Syndicate specific permission to negotiate in Qatar but since the prior claim of the A.P.O.C. has expired and H.H.G. allowed the APOC to negotiate in 1926, the Syndicate are presumably free to negotiate. The Shaikh hiimself is bound by Art. V of the Treaty of 1916 not to grant any concession without the consent of the British Government.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000280_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/666</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000280</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/666</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'C.74 CONFIDENTIAL 86/4 EASTERN AND GENERAL SYNDICATE.
