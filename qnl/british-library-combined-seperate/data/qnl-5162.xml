The Land Settlement Department would issue the notices before registering the property in the name of the purchaser. The notices were intended to establish whether there was any objection by any person with rights to the property, and to allow such person(s) to state their objection before the period given in the notice expired. Copies of the notices would be sent to the Political Agency in Bahrain for recordkeeping. The correspondence is mainly in Arabic. Most of the notices are issued by Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, on behalf of the Government of Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Proclamations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000282#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000282#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000282#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
