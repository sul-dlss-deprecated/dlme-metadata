The letter goes on to inform the recipient that the sudden departure from Herat was due to H M's Government having decided to give over the city to Russo-Persian influence and waive the terms of their treaty, including the clause to release all prisoners taken during the last war with Persia. Also discussed are Persia's response to this decision; Hardy's fears that a revolution may occur once the British Mission departs as the people are not happy with the recent actions of their ruler; their departure from Herat via Bushire; and their intention to take any troops stationed at Karrack [Bandar-e-Charak] with them. The letter concludes by enquiring after Colonel John Jacob and whether he has returned to Jacobabad; and promoting the need for a strong British force above Bolan (Afghanistan).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024079755.0x000009#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
