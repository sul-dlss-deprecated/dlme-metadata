The only exception which they were prepared to make was in favour ~ c of the U.S.A, because, first, it would please the Afghan public, .and, secondly, it could be represented as a natural development of the situation whereby the U*S. Minister at Tehran was also accredited to Kabul., In fact. Sir F. Wylie was told by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the same month of the agreement between the U.S.A. and Afghanistan to provide for the exchange of Ministers (Ext. 1967/42), but approaches made by H.M. Minister on behalf of Poland and China were still unfavourably received (Ext.2531/42). /14 f/c^ Ic. % Sd'' ^v* “-f? Ar. More recently there have been further deviations from the policy described above. The occasion for the Foreign Minister’s declaration had been his Government’s refusal to enter into diplomatic relations with China. The first steps to revoke this decision were apparently taken during 1943 (Ext. 5997/43) and a treaty of friendship signed on March 2nd, 1944, was ratified on September 30th (Ext.5079/Vf)« It provides for the exchange of diplomatic representatives, and we are informed that the Chinese Minister at Angora has been nominated for the new post. * c- - —-J • * .-Jj. CT. . „ Furthermore, the Afghan Government are now said to be anxious to enter into relations with the French Provisional Government (EXT. 5054/44)» Thby ceased to recognise Vichy in September (Ext.,4019/44) and early in November they telegraphed Paris asking for a resumption of diplomatic relations, although Mr. Squire had been led to understand through the Turkish Ambassador that the .Afghans wished the French to make the first move. (Ext.4848/44;. A point of some difficulty which arises is that, according to the Foreign Office, the French will refuse to accejjt diplomats who were accredited to- Vichy. This will circumscribe still further the already limited ghan choice, and the ex’-Ambassador to Vichy, who is an uncle of the .^ing, will pxobably resent losing the post which he has occuoied in one form or another since 1931. The Afghan Government has also recently announced its recognition of Syrian and Lebanese independence (Ext.5008/44) only six weeks after the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed(If in any cane the ccimunication. jo f 'contents of this document to any person outside British or U.S. Cf '^rnnient Service is authorised^ it must he pL. .phrased) Allotted to .External Dep ar tment Corj.ies Circulat ed » Copi es to Foreign Office Repeated to Government of India,* Department of h Addressed to secretary of Gtate for Foreign Affaird repeated to Cover nr,lent of India*, Department of KxVernal Affairs p Delhi and Beirut- Kabul press of November 1st (t announces) recognition by ^fgh«^ ^ &lt; •— ■* —* &gt; - independence^ From Hia Majesty's Minister, Kabuli To Secretary of States for Foreign Affairs, India Kxternal jiff airs and Beirut Dated Kabul P ll o 00 hours p 5th November, 1944 Keoeived 07,50 hours, 5th November, 1944. 153', 4/11 eFROM BiiGDi^D TO FOREIGN OFFICE Sir K.

This is in reply to an angry letter from Ibn Saud. Nuri Pasha added that Shukri Quawtle had strongly approved of a declaration of war by Ibn Saud and Iraq and had said that on his return to Syria he intended to persuade national bloc to work to the same end. He is, according to Nuri Pasha, convinced that any association with the Axis would be disastrous for Syria [grp. undec. ? full stop] .

Shukri Kulv/ali called on me after nerforming pilgrimage and for the greater part of his visit spoke of ibn Saud for whom he clearly has the greatest admiration and whose advice he is prepared to take. 3. He assured me that no Arab of reliability can possibly wish for German victory. Germans by their treatment of Europeans had taught the Arabs what they might expect if they came under the influence of these people, who had*none of the characteristics necessary for the guidance of others. He said the only hope of the Arabs lay in Britain, and one has only to compare Iraq and Syria to see what he meant. He was not happy_ about the conditions in Syria, but understood that Britain could not stop the war merely in order to put things straight and was prepared to await the end of the war when His Majesty s Government, he was confident, would see that the assurances given were fully implemented. ( 7 4. He thought that a German defeat would solve the only problem standing in the way of complete agreement between .British and the Arabs, for the Jews from Germany and Central Europe would flock back when their countries were freed from /Nazi tyranny. 5. It is of course impossible to form useful judgement after half hours conversation, but I am inclined to agree with Ibn Saud that whatever he may have felt or done in the past Shukri Kulwali now realises, firstly, that the Germans are not going to win this war, and secondly, that it would be entirely against Arab interests that they should van.

French text has been telegraphed to General de Gaulle by General Catroux. 2. I told General Catroux that I greatly preferred my own draft^ and that I certainly could not accept text unless it contained a reference to the possibility of closer political relations between Arab countries. Without this, statement would derogate from assurances given by you in your speech of May 29th which had been warmly received in Arab world. I would, however, be prepared to accept his draft as a basis for discussion between yourself and General de Gaulle if he would add the words h et politioues' at the end of 3 rd paragraph. This he agreed to do, 3. Although draft does not go as far as I could have - wished, it would have the merit in Arab eyes of binding free major ity to policy of closer cultural, economic and politicaT^relations between Arab countries v/hich you enunciated in your Mansion House speech. 4.

The policy of His Majesty's Government is, as Colonel Furlonge rightly said, to buttress the authority of the Lebanese and. Syrian states and to ensure so far as military considerations permit that administration is transferred to Lebanese and Syrian authorities. Present arrangements are of necessity provisional and we should confine ourselves to doing what we can to persuade all sections to make success of measure of independance immediately open to them. 2. In these circumstances, I concur that it would be preferable to send no further reply to approach of Maronite Patriarch, and that joint declaration on basis of my speech of 29th May last might be helpful. Would you concert wording of an agreed draft with General Catroux and telegraph it here for consideration before it is made? You will no doubt be careful to refrain from any specific reference to possibility of political federations for as you know this question is at present under review here, 5.

IMPORTANT Following from Minister of State, . . . . * ^ A ? - bio.15 UK (oufit' WvtA&gt; ftefn Reference to telegram No,4091 Spears* General Spears reports that considerable political excitement continues 'throughout the Lebanon, both as regards form of declaration of independence and composition of new ministry to be announced shortly. Opposition both to French and to Naccache is tending to centre around Maronite Patriarch who is annoyed that General Catroux, after having promised to consult_him regarding choice of President, did not inform him. it is reported that at a meeting held on November 25th, the Patriarch took a solemn .oath before assembly of Maronite prelates to sever all relations with the French in future* On November 28th he sent a prominent Maronite politician to Colonel Furlonge with a message to the effect that having renounced the traditional connexion of the Maronites with France he wished to place the Maronite community tinder the protection of Great Britain* Colonel Furlonge said he must refer to higher authority, but that his personal view was that the policy of His Majesty's Government was to buttress the authority of the Lebanese State which had now received independence and should itself assume the responsibility for the protection of its own citizens. If the state proved unable to do so, and asked for outside help, the situation would have to be re examined, but unless and until this occurred His Majesty s Government could not undertake the protection of one community in the Lebanon* I think this reply was generally on the right lines although in my opinion Colonel Furlonge went somewhat too far in hinting that circumstances might arise in which His Majesty's Government could undertake the protection of the Maronite commu nity,, I think it preferable to send no further reply to this approach. The effervescence will probably subside in* a few days and if joint Anglo-French declaration, as suggested in_jiY telegram No.3808 is issued, and if the French take further steps to emiHia^fe^~the changes in regime, the position will settle down again. As regards c^ujjosition of the Government, a rather sjjoisifPr note was sim^ v in a letter from General Catroux RECd.POL.DEPt. ~50tci941 INDIA OFFICE offering/ —*ol' oJJi FolSu*!'

Repeated Saving to Jerusalem and Beirut. SECRET IMPORTANT . sssss Following for Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from Minister of State: Catroux, at my invitation, came here on Friday evening. &lt; I said that I wished to raise one or two matters of broad policy. I had been concerned, and I knew that you shared my concern, about phrases in the letter which he had now withdrawn describing Levant as H un contre poids aux etats Arabes' and later 'la tete du pont qui donne acces a 1 mterieur Mussulman'. Now this could not accord with thu British policy which looked to a friendly Mohammedan world and must always do so if for no other reasons than that we were the largest Mohammedan power. ^ General Catroux must admit, a fact that French and British policy in the Near East had been, in the period between the two wars,fundamentally different. Me regarded the independence of Syria and Lebanon, whi-ch had been agreed to by 1 ree french,as marking the end of phase when policies oi two countries diverged and the beginning of anew one when they were reconciled and marched in step. ,, had recognised the pre-eminence of France over any Levant, but the counterpart was the real and live independence of the two republics. Accusations were being made, as General Catroux was aware, that independence was an insubstantial pageant, and that under cover of declarations and carefully•selected and creature governments, the French domination was being rebuilt into structure of Levant. I must ask him to state categori- cally whether French policy was in line with British policy. I thought ours was dictated by our liberal sentiments but at the worst by necessity, and I did not see how in to-day's circumstances Free French could expect to return to policy of the Third Republic. ^ J 2. General'Catroux dismissed his phrase 'tete du nont' as a military one intended to mean that if military ooerations bridge-held? 1 ? Q L ° b ^ 0n WaS in faCt a ^tural ° n w + assured me that he was in agreement with the substance of what I had said. He ponfessed that there were still some traces of mediaevalism in General de Gaulle’s mind but he said definitely that independence was intended to be 9 Britain^ that FrCe i ' rance would march in step with Great ° fttfCo. POk* dept f In/f .No' 2r 4 . 4 . , 1930, for example, the French representatives attached to Syrian Government had no longer power to veto but only to advise. It would be the same in Lebanpn. He gave as an instance that in the past the Maronites had always controlled the Government and its appointments. One of the reasons that he had chosen Naccache as President was to mark the end of the old order,, In spite of this rather disingenuous statement concerning Naccache, I feel sure that.Catroux is sincere about making independence a reality. 3c We next touched upon the question of Arab J | Federation and General Catroux observed that in any wide lorm it was not immediately practicable. In the immediate future we must look for closer economic ties as a first step. With this I agreed. _4 0 General Catroux then suggested that a joint j declaration by Free French and ourselves about future policy m the Levant would have- a great effect. I agreed readily to examine this, and I think if it contained a statement that Free French were now to act in harmony with British policy in the Middle East,and , 1 . n otu?? aspects followed suostance of your speech of nay P9th last, that it would do much to calm Moslem \ opinion which continues to think that behind screen of Sip troops, French are being allowed to regain their old domination. The reference to 1936 Treaty has thus made a most painful impression on Lebanese. . 1 would be very glad if you would let me have your views on this point. 5. Lastly we discussed Treaty negotiations with the two republics. I pointed out that if treaty negotiations were now instituted, great fears v/ould be aroused in the minds of the population, whether Christians in Lebanon or Arabs m Syria. It would be said-that advantage was being taken to negotiate treaties with puppet governments which did not represent the will of the people and ata time when it was undesirable to hold elections. Did General Catroux think this danger * 1 5 ? sa f? that he entirely shared this view and that he thought that the conclusion of definitive treaties should wait until after the War. He had no instructions on this matter from General de Gaulle, although second paragraph of your telegram No. 4142 seems to show that he also is '^thlsmind: : ' 6 . I will not weary you with other matters upon which I pressed him. I urged the necessity of a purge ot ex-Vichy officials and mentioned certain of them by name. He was sympathetic, but I think he will do little except under continuous pressure. 7./4 3 7. Catroux makes a very good impression, but he is almost too smooth. I believe he has set a course which follows ours, and was certainly sailing in my light zephyrs on Friday. He will take in sail and tack whenever sirocco from do Gaulle begins to blow, but I believe if we are firm with de Gaulle, we can bring Catroux back to the right bearings.

When General Catroux made the declaration of the 8 th June, it was believed that treaties would be negotiated at an early date with both Syria and the Lebanon. It now appears hov/ever that neither country is anxious for the conclusion of a treaty, since they do not wish to bind themselves to the Free French for the future (your telegram No. 3588), 2. Position therefore is that.Mandate, though modified, has not been terminated and cannot be terminated at any rate until treaties have been concluded with the two independent States. It would however be most unwise, as well as incorrect, for the Free French to state publicly that nothing has been changed. If it is necessary Xo say anything in public about the Mandate, Free French should stress that they have taken the first step towards the fulfilment of the promise made by General Catroux in his proclamation of June 8 th to put an end to the Mandate.

The Government, therefore, welcomed any steps towards the realisation of'these aspirations, chief among which was of course, the full enjoyment of sovereign independence. 2, The Convention between the United States and France signed at Paris on 4th April, 1924 and the provisions of the mandate for Syria and the Lebanon included therein clearly embodied the idea of Syrian and Lebanese independence The United States Government continued to support these provisions which it endorsed in 1924 and which were a corner-stone of the mandate principle. The 1924 Convention which also set forth the rights of the United States and its nationals in the areas concerned was fprmally ratified by the American Government in accordance with the required constitutional procedure and must be regarded as continuing in effect until new instruments^of a mutually satisfactory nature could be similarly negotiated and ratified.

First impressions are that public opinion has received declaration at best with cynical'apathy and at the worst with active disapproval., 2. Complete lack of enthusiasm was shown during and after the proclamation. Majority of notables and Christian religious leaders absented themselves from the ceremony; in particular no Maronites and few Moslems assisted. Town was not (repeat not) beflagged and there were no demonstrations. Contrast with usual local custom was marked. 3 0 I understand that strong protest against the terms of declaration is being prepared by influential body of notables for presentation to the British and Free French [? grp. omtdcj. 4, Causes of dissatisfaction seem to be as follows: (a) Population had been led by Prime Minister’s speech of September'9th to hope that f? if they] were not to have British administration' they desired, they v/ould at least receive real independence. This hope was strengthened by the form of Syrian declaration and by statement made by Catroux when consultedo References in Lebanese declaration to 1936 treaty, to France's 'Mission Seculaire', etc., are however taken to imply indefinite continuance or French hegemony. (As we know this is not far from what the French inrend). Population therefore feel they have been double crossed. Disparity in treatment accorded to Syria and Liban is also resented. (b) Reference in Catrou^’s letter to Naccache to needlessness of independent regime has annoyed politician Mass. RECo. POL. DEPt. - IDHC 941 INDIA OFFICE (c), &lt;*o ‘(c) Average Lebanese unconnected with politics sees in the declaration only perpetuity of inefficient and corrupt French controlled regime and still considers substitution 01 British control is the only hope for the country. 5. Potential danger to our military security of^above feeling amongst population must not be under-estimated. As has been freauenlly pointed out, majority of population who are pro-Axis are so, only because they wish uo be rid of the French and have been restrained from turning against us because they hope for continuance of our incursion. Declarations tending to annihilate this hope ana consequent resentment will be intensified if as is probable drench show no signs of loosening their hold on the aoministraoion. 6 . I am convinced that (a) French should be told plainly t-hat we expect thorn to implement the declaration of independence by overt signs of handing over control to Lebanese; (b) Communication from His Majesty's Government recognizing the independence should be couched in such terms as to stress our intention that it shall be real, (c) Treaty negotiations which would be liable to arouse even greater feeling than the declaration has done should avoided during the war. 7. If some action on the above lines can be taken I do not anticipate any serious trouble.

General de Gaulle’s viev/s regarding the termination of the Mandate were given in an official communication from the Free French headquarters of November 5th in v/hich it was stated that: n La proclamation de 1’independance Syrienne par le Delegue general et plenipotentiaire laisse subsister le Mandat, le General Catroux exerpant, compte tenu de la nouvelle situation de fait, les pouvoirs du Haut-Commissaire de France en Syrie'. The statement went on to say that the changes introduced in Syria did not affect the juridical position, which could only be modified with the consent of the League of Nations and of the Government of the United States. Furthermore, the Comite National Franpais only envisaged the termination of the Mandate after the conclusion with the Syrian and Lebanese Governments of treaties duly ratified according to the law of the French Republic. 2. It is not possible to give a categorical answer to the question whether after the Mandate is terminated the treaties based thereon remain valid, since this depends inter alia on the nature of the treaties. This question is however irreve1ant if the United States Government will remember that the case of Syria and the Lebanon is analogous to that of Iraq before the termination of the Mandate. In the case of Iraq, His Majesty's Government made it their business to see that the position of treaties relating to Iraq with the United States and third powers was satisfac torily clarified before their mandatory responsibilities terminated, and in particular that the Iraqi Government accepted responsibility for all treaties with third powers which His Majesty's Government had made in their name. quoted in paragraph 2 of my telegram No f 6150 [ of November 11th] that the Free French are adopting the same course as regards Syria and the Lebanon.

Member of my staff discussed situation again vtith officials of Near 2astern Division of the State Department on November 14th in the lijht of information contained in your telegram. Latter said that they had been informed by United States Consul General at Beirut of proposed declaration concern ing the Lebanon. Statement that mandate was modified but not terminated? however? came as a complete surprise to them. They said that all their previous renorts had led them to suppose that the mandate was'to be ended and they quoted from a letter addressed to General Catroux by General de Gaulle (which former had shown to Mr. Engert) in which General de Gaulle had definitely stated this. They added? however? that the fact that the mandate was to continue did not necessarily affect their attitude one way or the other. 2. As regards United States rights in Syria? they expressed some doubt whether a Free French Syrian declaration gave them the necessary guarantees? particularly as United States Government did not in any way recognise the Free French. They would however consider this further. 3. Member of my staff took opportunity to quote some of the favourable comments which had appeared in the [?local] press in this country, and pointed out that if was always assumed in these comments that United States Government would shortly follow our example. 4. Mr. Murray did not hold out much hope of early recognition by United States Government. He said however that State Department had been considering possibility of issuing some statement on the lines that United Stales Government viewed with favour attainment of independence by Syria and the Lebanon. He promised to let us know when a decision had been reached. 5. 'I took this matter up with Welles on November 18th and told him of the hope of His Majesty's Government for early recognition by United States eminent. He received representation sympathetically and took note but sand the question regarding position of mandate was fundamental. It was necessary for United - States Government to establish the legal point whether if the mandate was terminated, treaties based thereon remained 6 .

Moreover it has always been contemplated that 1956 draft would inevitably he point of departure for such negotiations, * Je cannot suggest therefore that Free French are acting irregularly in pursuing course they propose. Our ground lor objection to explicit reference to 1936 Treaty in Lebanese Declaration was therefore purely one of expediency based on your advice of effect it was likely to have locally^ After personal diocussion with General de Gaulle ? Ifalt that, in view of his apparent strong conviction on the pointy matter must be left to his responsibility On the other hand it is not necessary that treaty^ negotiations should commence the moment after Declaration of Independence. Indeed on grounds of expediency we agree that some delay is advantageous. In the first place it is desirable to see how things develop after Declaration, secondly it'- is important that the treaty negotit at ions should be conducted with local Governments, which can reasonably be regarded as representative of local public opinion, and only some delay can show to what extent b-overnnents now constituted satisfy this condition. We agree that in any case treaties negotiated during the war by Free French must be avowedly provisional, but if this is stated it should remove some of objections to treaty negotiations. -ft (p(b) I am advised that General Catroux‘s ■^note preclude political fusion between Syria ; and the-L^bfeon, nor does it contradict Catroiuc's declaration of 3th June. Under that declaration Syria and the Lebanon were to decide freely whether they would fuse or remain separate states. Until they have first been constituted as independent states they cannot ercise any choice one way or the other. As regards geographical adjustment, we have safeguarded in our letter to- Free French headquarters ^ s£.e my telegram No.. IW-l 3951 ) our view that frontier readjustment must be left open. Any such readjustment however must be by mutual agreement between two states and guarantee in Lebanese Declaration must be taken to mean that readjustment will not be imposed upon Lebanon before independent Lebanese state was in position to agree to anything. (c) Having in Lyttelton-de Gaulle Agreement recognised pre-eminent position of Free French in this area we cannot claim to intervene between Syria and the Lebanon over head of Free French. //hat we do and shall claim is that Free French, should consult us before they decide on action in these matters.

[Begins] In continuation of my telegram Spears No. 428 November 15th. -— — In the course of my meeting of yesterday with Catroux's Chef de Cabinet 'Politique” to inform him of the amendments advised Jui-JlQre 4 ^MD£flne ^telegrams _J:o-- 4 rQujQs. 5952 and 5955 y -I gained very clear impression that the French fully expected us to take a firm stand on paragraph 16 of the declaration and on the reference to 1936 treaty in paragraph 7, hence Catroux’s note to you of November 11th. As soon as they realized, which was only after the note to you had been despatched, that de Gaulle had had his way on these paragraphs, they were extremely annoyed with themselves for having played king to catch the already discarded trumps. They would have given a great deal to withdraw the note. The Chef de Cabinet Politique tried airily to dismiss the note as now redundant and even suggested that Catroux might write a short letter to that effect. However, the gravity of his note was brought home to Catroux by your telegram. Feeling that he could not withdraw at this stage he took the line that he had only been honest in informing you of the real Free French point of view. It is dawning on him that de Gaulle has adopted a new technique namely ordering him to put forward ideas so as to test our reactions. If unsatisfactory, de Gaulle can go back on them in London leaving Catroux to hold the baby. Catroux is developing a dislike of babies and it must be confessed that as a wet nurse he is a failure.

Repeated to Beirut No. 106, ddddddd MOST BOv'ZSDIATE You will have seen that I have reserved our position in regard to General Catroux' note. Hy reasons for doing this were that if we accepted it without protest we should be committed to 3 things: (a) to recognising that 1936 Treaty must form the foundation of any future treaty between France and Lebanon, French phrase U qui conserve la favour du liban 1 ’ is far from true. (b) It precludes any political or geographical adjustment or fusion between the two States. I might add that by itself, this contradicts Catroux 1 original declaration before the Allies entered Syria. (c) Our rights to intervene in [grp. undec.] difficulties arising between Syria and Lebanon either now or at the end of the war are expressly excluded. In the light of these fundamental objections I need not emphasise the unfortunate tone of the documents nor the [grp, undec. ? attendant] detailed interpretation which we could not accept. I cannot however refrain from asking where the Free French would be in Syria and Lebanon without British money supplies and troops. It is most unfortu late that the Free French should have thought fit’ to raise these controversial issues so prematurely, and it seems to me that we are left with the alternatives of either insisting that Catroux should withdraw the documents or of formulating our objections on the above three points, If you threaten to withhold our recognition of Lebanese independence it will probably force Catroux to withdraw the note because any public repudiation by us would completely undermine the Free French both in Syria and Lebanon.

Following is translation of General Gatroux's note., 6, It is quite clear that France could not give up the advantages/ [Begins]. Object of this note is to examine two principal oojeecions raisedby the Foreign Office and Captain Lyttelton concerning the spirit of draft declaration which I orocose to malce to proclaim indejpaadence of Lebanon. 2c. The first of these objections arises from the intention shown^by^Free France to make its relations with Lebanon conforn to principles set out in the treaty of 1956. • S0 ' - 1 - obliged to confess that I have difficulty in seeing the reasons which oblige the Foreign Office to adopt this attitude. ior us it is a question of following the spirit of an instrument of the agreement which was accepted at the time by two parties which still finds favour in the Lebanon which satisfies Free France, and which cannot hurt the interests of Great Britain. instrument_ enshrines the particular and privileged nature of the irench position in the Levant; a nosition which no country has contested and which the British Government have recognisea as exis ting and as being destined to continue to exist at uhe risk of grant of independence. 5. This instrument insofar as it gives France the right to maintain forces in the i.ebanon enables her to ensure protection not only of Christians of Lebanon but also of Christian or non-christian minorities of Syria. This orivilege urovides a means of meeting the traditional obligations'of trance and preoccupation so often shown by America and Great hricain xo ootain guarantees to guard Christian minorities, even after the end of the mandate from any untoward event. RECb. POL. DEPt. 18NQVi941 1 INDIA OFFICE2, &lt; 15 ,/ advantages indicated above 5 and that they must necessarily be reserved to her in any treaty which she makes with the Lebanono 7e Granted that it is inconceivable that Great Britain should think of disputing with France either her privileged position in the Lebanon or her role of protector of Christians, it seems that no argument can arise from the declaration that France intends to use as basis of her relation with Lebanon principles contained in Treaty of 1956 and its annexes, 8 0 Second objection of Foreign Office is directed against statement made in my declaration that Lebanese -state constitutes a unity which is nolitically and territorially indivisible,, 9, So far as I can judge British anxiety must be lest a declaration in this sense should arouse most violent protests from Syria and lest there should result therefrom a state of discontent which would be prejudicial in the present circumstances to the peace of the orient and in the future to the success of British policy in Arab countries, 10 . Apprehension concerning possible unfavourable Syrian reactions is not in my opinion justified. Syrians were warned by my declaration made at Damascus on September 27th of the position adopted by Free France with regard to Syria - Lebanese quarrels, I kept these quarrels within narrow limits by confining them to the sphere of economic relations. Syria clearly understood that~there was not, and would not be, any question of political claims. They understood and accepted this, for I have never received from them either directly or indirectly a single protest on the subject. Press office has never had to censor a single article raising the question of return to Syria of any Lebanese territory. 11. At the same time it is of note that for their part neither the Foreign Office nor Captain Lyttelton have made any reservation in opposition to the conception expressed on this point in my declaration. 12, France has made Lebanon basis of her Levant policy and in building up Lebanon she has taken into account both the needs of that country and the essentials of France’s own policy, A compact Lebanon is necessary to her interests. It is also useful in the interest of Great Britain since it is indispensable for Western powers, who whether they like it or not will always find themselves side by side against Moslems, to find in a loyal state of mixed composition a counterorder to the independent Moslem and Arab states. Counterorder is necessary on the question of war because of the maritime and geographical position of Lebanon. It is-necessary in time of peace because Lebanon with its Mediterranean seaboard facing Europe is bridge-head which gives access to Moslem hinterland.13. Principle of Lebanon unity can also *be justified from the legal 'point of view. It need only he recalled that the Mandate granted to France in July 1922 hy the League of Nations covers the state of Lebanon contained in territorial limits fixed on September 1st 1920 by General Gouraud. Secondly when the United States guaranteed Lebanon in Franco American Agreement on April 4th 1924 it was this definition of Lebanon which was used. Finally it may be recalled that Syria formally recognised the present slate of things in 1936 and that in accordance with condition imposed on Syria^ by France, prior to the opening of treaty negotiations, Syria renounced all claims concerning the Lebanese frontier. 14. At the same time it follows from the text of the Mandate, from Treaties of 1936 and from my declaration of Seotember 27th 1941 that any difficulties which may arise between Syria and Lebanon must be settled through the mediation of France and no other power whatsoever. 15. To conclude, whatever point of view may be adopted with regard to question of unity and territorial integrity of Lebaion it is clear that the discussion is over and that it would be inopportune to reopen. Free France considering this possibility from the point of view of common interests of the Allies and of the interests of France, could not agree to reopen it.

There is some reason to believe that General Catroux is contemplating opening negotiations with Lebanese Government, ana possioly also Sjrrian Government, for conclusion of reaties once proclamation of Lebanese independence is out oi the way. There is certainly no desire for a treaty at tne present time either in Lebanon or in Syria. Apart from doubts as to validity of any formal treaty concluded with iree French, neither country is anxious to bind themselves to French for the future. It is unlikely whether even Tai ±jd Dm Government in Syria would be prepared to enter into such negotiations but^it is possible that in Lebanon the renc oy skimul choice of personalities might arrange a Ministry vaich would be subservient to their wishes in the matter 01 treaty negotiations but would nevertheless be quite un-representative of public opinion.

From Minister of State. 13th November, 1941, 13th November, 1941, Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem has raised with Spears question of safeguards for members of Christian communities m proclamation of Lebanese independence. He represents that this should include (a) guarantee of full personal liberty of conscience and (b) safeguards for establishment and maintenance of schools, hospitals and philanthropic undertakings. Bishop is particular ly concerned with position of Moslem converts to Christianity. 2. Point could be met to some extent by inserting in paragraph 17 of draft proclamation word 'religious” between words 'civil' and 'political'. This might also have advantage of facilitating United States recognition of Lebanese independence. As you know in discussing proposed United States recognition of Syria ? State Department have already expressed anxiety about position of United States Missions in Syria and their religious and missionary interests in the Lebanese are of course far greater. 3.

It seems to me inevitable that if paragraph 16 of the Draft Declaratipn is allowed to stand, the Syrians will jump to the conclusion that the French are determined to block frontier revision at all costs. This may lead to deterioration in [group omitted] situation in Syria which is already none too happy and make difficulties for the Taj Ed Din dovemmento I should prefer the omission of the whole_ of the paragraph, which can, if necessary, be explained away for the reasons given in paragraph 2 above.

If^ anything, I think the former represents an improvement irom L&gt;€^tf/Mj 644 L* poin c oi view. , Paragraph 16, Substitution of word ''atteinte' . y- seems to me to represent a slight * improvement out I still feel strongly that either the whole paragraph should be omitted or it should be modified in accordance with the proposal in your telegram No. 5860. Paragraph 18. Although the word i ‘libre M would be better retained I do not think there is any serious danger in .its ofiiission here. ,s : • ‘ . Paragraph 20. Military authorities prefer the f original wording of the paragraph and,are against de Gaulle s amendments. Retention of word '’Allies’' emphasises joint military control and co-operation and is bound to have salutary effect bn Arab opinion. ' Paragraph 25. Word 'Libre” must clearly be re-inserted but I do not consider it necessary tq insist on.a definite reference to Allied guarantees in this instance. As regards procedure we have now reached a situation in which as I feared, we are engaged in trying to deal with amendments from four quarters. The only way of preventing confusion and possible mistakes seems to me to be to allow final details to be negotiated in Beirut or for you to settle these points v/ith de Gaulle direct in London. As he apparently insists on having the last word I prefer the latter alternative, but it has the disadvantage that you do not know exactly what representations Spears has made to Catroux or with what success.

This obvious limitation 01 sovreignty would be deeply resented: therexore to 'be deprecated since this will reinforce prevailing idea^ that we are handing them over irrevocably to ireeireach in violation of our guarantee of complete 1 independence.

This is in effect a challenge to opinion at its most sensitive point, in second sentence oMssion in phrase' la pens^e unique de gagner ia guerre' of word 'unique' is refreshing admission of real thought underlying all amendments. In third sentence 'libre' after France should be maintained. At.the end of this sentence substitution of words “de ses propres engagements 'for 'des engagements des alliees' deliberately ignores British guarantee.

I agree with your comments. Paragraph 16 is most contentious point and one to which I attach particular importance (see my telegram No. 103 Prior). V/e have been most careful where possible to abstain from committing our selves on boundary questions during course of this war and in view of Atlantic charter it is now all the more desirable to refrain from binding ourselves until eventual peace settle ment. Please explain urgently to Catroux reasons which make it impossible for us to accept clause implying that present boundary between Syria and Greater Lebanon must be preserved for all time. You should add that much as we would depjore public difference over this issue we should have to consider including in our recognition of Lebanese independence some reservation about Syrian-Lebanese boundary if clause is not omitted or so modified as not to preclude adjustment of this boundary at some future date. Omission is clearly the simplest solution but if there are insuperable objections on grounds that there is a similar clause in Syrian declaration we would have no objection to clause so drafted as to make it clear that its object was solely to preclude forcible splitting up of Lebanese State into smaller units, 2.

Following are my comments on your proposed amendments. * Paragraph 1. Legal adviser' to Embassy sees no objection to reference to the Treaty in paragraph 1 of General Catroux's draft. This paragraph refers back to the proclamation of June 8 th which declares Syria and Lebanon to be independent unconditionally. Treatyto be concluded with France is intended to guarantee their independence and its non-conclusion would nof detract from independence. I agree that the words * f et simultanee k? which occurred in the Syrian declaration should be addecU* (2) Paragraph 2. Word ^libres 1 ’ would be rendered innocuous if followed by words ‘ f et independant s'* which occurred in paragraph 2 in the declaration. (5) Paragraph 7. I agree that word 'tutelaire 1 * is objection able and should be omitted; if desired it could be replaced by '’seculaire 1 * or ‘’traditionelle 1 ’. I agree that reference to the 1936 Treaty should be withheld. Inclusion of these words can only lead to dispute and gives us the worst of both worlds. On the one hand it will inevitably arouse the suspicions of the Lebanese and on the other hand it does not bind them to accept a permanent military occupation which is what Gatroux presumably has~in mind. Moreover it is in direct contradiction to paragraph 10. (4) Paragraphs 8 and 9, I agree that these paragraphs should be run together. As regards suggested specific acceptance of this clause I consider it more important that Naccache should be induced to issue a statement formally subscribing to the declaration as a whole. If however Naccache will not do this, I agree he should be asked specifically to accept this clause. (5) Paragraph 13. I do not feel that we should ask Catroux to include reference to protection of Lebanese interests by British representatives wherever the Free French are not represented. This is getting down to an administrative detail and gives a rather unnecessary blow to Free French prestige. Furthermore Vichy propaganda will [?grp. omit. ?be] given the chance of describing Catroux as a creature of the British. (6)....( 6 ) Paragraph 16, on which you do not comment appears to me to raise the greatest difficulty in this document. As' it stands^* :he first sentence enshrines the principle of ‘‘the ^grp. undec. ?nationalised] Lebanese” and renders impossible any future negotiations for adjustment of Lebanese frontier desired by the Syrians. The. latter as of course you know are seeking for return of certain territories containing main Moslem populations and in particular port of Tripoli. Whatever French policy may be in regard to territorial adjustments is it necessary to raise this bone of contention in the declaration which inevitably at once destroys all its value in the .eyes of the Syrians and indeed many Lebanese? - • (7) Paragraph 17. Here again I would prefer to rely on a formal acceptance by Naccache of the terms of the declaration. A private letter would not commit any successor to him in office. If however a general acceptance is not forthcoming I agree that a letter confirming this guarantee would be better than nothing. &gt; ( 8 ) I agree that Catroux should be asked to write me a letter on economic safeguards on lines suggested in paragraph 9 of your telegram under reference. (9) Please take up these points with Catroux on above lines forthwith.

Following are General Spear's comments on General Gaeroux's proposed declaration of Lebanon independence. [Begins].. Can s in the opinion of your legal adviser, the sentence starting ,f Sous la garantie' and endino- ’’Franco- Libanais' in first paragraph be construed to mean that independence is conditional on the .Treaty being concluded? in that event the Lebanese Government lays itself open to blackmailing.by the French through the threat of the repudiation of declaration if treaty not concluded. Furthermore, I fear that if independence conditional on conclusion of the treaty the French might, whenever it suited them, use this as loophole for assuming control . pver &gt; certain matters over the heads of Lebanese and .&amp;^a/pgnsuing7Governments. Similar expression occurred in 'Syrian declaration, . This, danger more real in the light of Catroux s rec’ent remark to me that naturally in all matters affecting both States the French would continue exercising controlover both. 'Suggest addition after the wore ’’particuliere' in this paragraph the words ^et simultannee' to avoid implication that Britain simply followed France. 2, In paragraph 2 suggest the deletion of last sentence as offensive to Lebanon, Sentence suggests the Lebanese were formerly in servitude. 5. m paragraph 7 suggest the deletion of word tutelaire”. Suggest, furthermore, deletion of last sentence^ which commences 'Dans I'esprit', The 1936 treaty limited the Free Lebanese State in many ways which would to-day be strongly [? grp. omitted: ? resented] oy uhe Lebanese, Besides mere mention of this treaty is anathema L ? grp, omitted: ?to] many Lebanese hence its invocation most unwise. Consider the whole of paragraph 7 exudes sentiments contrary to Allied policy of complete^ independence for the Levant States and even to the alleged object of the declaration itself. o , Suggest making one paragraph of paragraphs 8 and 9 so chat words 'ces considerations' will clearly 1 refer to paragraph 8 and not to all that goes before P 1 [Grp.2 . [Grp* omitted: ?5J. Paragraph 12 is improvement on the corresponding paragraph 9 [grp. undec: ?of 7 memorandum- -of] declaration as being more explicit. Suggest Gatroux he asked to get Naccache when replying to declaration specifically to accept this clause. Such acceptance would dixnilish the risk of future repudiation of past international engagements involving the Lebanese. I cannot exp-lain Catroux’s reason for tightening up this clause but conceive due to(prolific) text having already been found in practice too loose. 6 , Paragraph 13 s which is identical with paragraph 10 or the Syrian declaration, should in my opinion and in the light of recent experience contain addition to the effect that where the Free French are unrepresented British representatives would, as provisional measure and at the request of the French, assume charge of Lebanese interests. ' Paragraph as it stands is undecided and cold comfort for numerous important Lebanese communities abroad. 7o Paragraph 17 which corresponds with paragraph 14 of the Syrian declaration is better than'the latter since in this case the Lebanese Government not delegate-General are made responsible. Would suggest substituting word 'garantir a M by_”s* engage a garanxir n and asking Catroux uo obtain from Naccacne a letter confirming this guarantee. In that connexion Catroux would not need to exchange letters with you on this point but would simply furnish us with copy of Naccache letter for record. 8 « Have no further comments on text of declaration. 9, Assume that you required Catroux should write to you a letter regarding economic safeguard as in the Syrian case. Would suggest on this occasion sufficient for letter to contain simply 4th paragraph of draft letter contained in your 189 of September 18th as revised by your 216 of September 26th. Bo you agree ?

[Begins] / 'Lebanese, a proclamation, v/hich I addressed to you on June 9th last in the name of General de Gaulle, Head of Free France, and which Great Britain, our ally, has supported by a special declaration - has granted to the Lebanese under guarantee of a treaty to be^ concluded with a view to to defining reciprocal Franco-Lebanese relations^ the status of a sovereign and independent state. i Guardianfof the generous sentiments and)of the liberal — ^ .tradition of France, and careful to honour the engagements which France has\contracted towards you, Free France(desires 'that her first act) on entering the Levant should be ? . m spite of the war, in spite of exceptional difficulties which it imposes, an act of sufferance: she has made you free. 3 Your aspirations are fulfilled: it now remains for you to organize your independence. As for me, two last tasks Of guardianship still remain. ^ The first is to entrust the task of the inauguration and direction of the new rdgime to a personality highly qualified at the present juncture, to accomplish this delicate national task. After very extensive consultations with distinguished men, and taking into consideration public opinion throughout the whole of the territory, I have established that the choice of M. Alfred Naccache meets the wish of the Lebanese nation. I have asked him to retain these powers with the title and prerogatives of President of the Republic, and to govern by means of a Ministry which is responsible to him and yathin v/hich will be ensured just representation of all regions and oi all religions which constitute the Lebanese nation. President/£ President Naccache has ^accepted, and I assure both him and the Lebanese community of my solicitude and whole hearted support. (5 % second duty is to define in spirit and letter the form of collaboration to be established between the Lebanon and Free France, pending conclusion of a Treaty of Alliance and -Friendship. 7 In recognising your independence, France renounces neither her guiding friendship (amitid'tutelaire) in the Lebanon nor her privileged position which, in the course of centuries, she has acquired here. The Lebanese can continue to be assured or her help and assistance in all things in the spirit of the Franco-Lebanese Treaty of Alliance and Friendship of 1956, which has received the unanimous approval of Lebanese opinion. 9 She takes notice, on the other hand that the situation created by the war and the occupation by Allied forces of Lebanese territory temporarily places the Lebanese in a special position. 1 Various rights and obligations follow on these consider ations, in particular those set out below:- ioThe Lebanese State will enioy, from now on, the rights and prerogatives pertaining to zhc status of an independent state. These rights and prerogatives will be limited only by those restrictions which the present state of war and safety of the country and of the Allied armies demand. jiln addition, 'her position as a de fact o ally of Free France and Great Britain necessitates strict conformity with the policy of the Allies. aln acquiring an international independent status, the Lebanon naturally inherits the rights and obligations arising from all treaties, conventions, and international agreements concluded by France affecting her or in her name. iVIhe Lebanon has the right of nominating diplomatic - representatives to those countries where she judges that her interests call for such representation. Elsewhere the Free French authorities will lend their good offices ’to safeguard the rights and interests of the Lebanon as well as the protection of Lebanese subjects. The Lebanese State has the right to create her own military forces. With this object in view, Free France will render her all assistance. Great/5. if Great Britain having already undertaken on numerous occasions to recognise the independence of the Lecanon,^ Free France will, without delay, approach the^ other Allied or friendly powers with a view to octaining their recognition also of the independence of the Lebanese otate. lb Free France considers that the Lebanese State is politically and territorially an indivisible unit, the integrity of which is to be preserved from all dismemberment. She will consequently favour the' strengthening of the - political, cultural and economic, ties which unite [gp. omitteaj different parts in the Lebanon. n On their side, and with the same object in view, the Lebanese Government will guarantee equality of civil and political rights to'all her subjects without any ^distinction. They will ensure a fair distribution among the- different elements in the country of the high offices of state, and in the general service of the Government, They vdllalso ensure that the burden of the expenses^of public utility services be equitably shared by the different regions. &gt; They will take steps without delay to bring about unification of fiscal system and to carry out such administrative reforms as may be necessary. Ig’Free France undertakes to use her good offices for the examination and setting up of a basis of economic colla- boration between Syria and the Lebanon, and for the removal of the difficulties with which this collaboration is at present faced. This understanding, necessary between two neighbouring and sister states, muse guarantee the legitimate and . respective rights of the two parties and muso establish their relationship on a basis of reciprocal confidence. In order to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Lebanon and to carry on successfully the common struggle, the Allies will assume, for the duration of^the war, rhe defence of the country. With this end in view, the Lebanese Government will place the national Lebanese forces at the disposal of the Allied Command, to co-operate in the defence of the country. At the same time, and in so far as military necessity dictates, the Axj-ied Command will have at their disposal, from now on,,the equipment (bquipement) and public services of the Lebanon, in joarcicuiar, means of c ommunication, ae rodromes and ports (ame nageme nt s c otie rs). The defence of the territory also demands that a close collaboration exist at all firnes between General Commander-m- Chief and Delegate General and service of gendarmerie, the police and suretd of the Lebanese State, The Lebanon must, in fact, be defended in time of war, not only against^her enemies from without but also against those iron within. X\ By reason of the inclusion of the Lebanon in the war zone and in the economic and financial system of the Allies, the strictest collaboration between the Lebanese Government and the Allies is equally necessary to ensure for the duration/duration of hostilities and in the common interest, the ' acceptance and carrying out of all measures taken with a view to carrying economic warfare to a successful end. this object in view, for the duration of hostilities, all steps will be taken to ensure that the greatest possible measure of freedom of trade exists between the Lebanon and countries of^the sterling area. The Lebanon, now a member of the sterling area, will adopt in financial and economic fields and in particular in that of foreign exchange, the necessary measures to conform with the general policy of the sterling area. The foregoing stipulations reconcile the principle of independence and sovereignty of the Lebanon with the necessities of a state of war. They are inspired by one thought alone, namely, to win the war and to ensure for the Lebanon by these means the future of a free people. They bring to the Franco-Lebanese problem a solution, born of the will of Free France, not to delay, in spite of the war, the^fulfilment of national Lebanese aspirations and implemen tation of undertakings of the Allies accordingly, but it is necessary that the final settlement should take its place at the earliest possible [?gp. omitted: ?momentj in the form of a Franco-Lebanese treaty which will consecrate in a definite form the independence or the country.

X I have now received a report from General Officer Commander- in-Chief,' Palestine, to the effect that Commission has completed a report in which it recommends the removal of twenty individuals and a^fine of 300 field rifles. Commission considers fine will be paid without opposition, if the senior Syrian official making demand is supported by troops in [grp, undec. ?strength] and they recommend that a joint British and French force should be held in readiness to help in collecting. General Officer Commander- in-Chief considers it essential that conduct of actual operation should be left in British hands and that it should be carried out as soon as possible. After discussion with Commander-in-Chief I ’ have agreed to the above and General Wilson is asking General Spears to inform General Catroux accordingly. . 2. Since my previous telegram I‘have received a message from General Wilson which reverses his previous demand for an immediate declaration and delegation of Etat de Siege. He now recommends Etat de Siege should not now be proclaimed 0 He considers that there is.every indication that a thoroughly workable arrangement can be arrived at and feels strongly that a sudden declaration of Etat de Siege now would^prejudice the excellent relations which have been built up by the Commission especially 'with General Collet and Syrian ministers. 3. I do not think we should give way on matter of principle, but should insist with General de Gaulle that whenever asked for by % us the French should agree, to declare and delegate Etat de Siege. To sweeten this pill I,think we can very well say, so excellent are the results achieved in collaboration over Deir Ez Sor incident, that we are not asking for Etat de Siege to be applied now. % RECd.

President told me that, during yesterday evening and night, he received over one thousand personal telegrams either congratulating him or enquiring whether King’s message meant recognition. 3. I think you will find President’s acknowledgment of telegram, in answer to the King's, satisfactory. 4-. President, in a short speech which I am sending by bag, said he was very happy to have received, and greatly flattered by, the telegram that His Britannic Majesty was good enough to address to him. He ended by requesting me to inform His Majesty’s Government of his personal thanks, and gratitude of Government and Syrian people.

In any case, it is presumed that General de Gaulle will take an early opportunity to notify the United States Government and the Acting Secretary-General of the League of Nations of the recent events v/hich have taken place in Syria. It is suggested that the notifications should state (l) that General de Gaulle, as Chief of the Free French, assumed the pov/ers and responsibilities of France in the French mandated territories of the Levant, and that 'by a Decree ol che 24th June General de C-aulle appointed General Catroux as French Del£gue in the Levant, with all the pov/ers previously exercised, there 'by the French High Commissioner for the Levant* \2) that in fulfilment of the Policy set out in a proclamation made on the 8th June 'by him in the name of General de Gaulle, General Catroux nas now 'by a furtner proclamation of the 27th September announced the assumption 'by Sheikh Taj ed Din el Hassani of the Presidency of the independent Syrian Republic, it is further suggested that the texts of the two proclamations of theJune and of the 27th Septemoer should be annexed to the notification in order to make clear the respective positions of the Free French authorities and of the Syrian Government.

As regards last sentence of first paragraph of your telegram No. 5687, General Spears_reports United States Consul-General at Beirut has enquired v/hether it would be helpful to His Majesty’s Government if United States recognised Syrian independence.

Legal adviser to the ^ibassy, however, has suggested that some arrangement might be made, under which decrees are to be regarded as temporary v/artime measures only, taken owing to paucity of Free French judges mentioned in paragraph 9 of General Spears’ telegram. Decrees containing modifications do, in fact, refer to them as tumporary derogation from existing procedure. Legal adviser points out that we established military courts in Egypt during the last war, which temporarily over-rode the capitulations, and tried foreigners, and_ sug 0 ~.j ,, that this might offer some sort of a trecedent. If this solution were adopted, it might be made clear that we do not condone any infringement of our rights v/hich must be fully safeguarded in treaties ultimately negotiated by Free French, Government of Syria and Lebanon Government. ‘The United States Consul General at Beirut, on the instructions of the State Department, presented a note to General Catroux on October 8th, calling attention to the treaty rights of the United States in the Levant States and referring to the privileges and immunities of foreigners, including Consular jurisdiction, and the capitulations, which according to Article 5 of the Mandate, would immediately be re-established at the first modification of the Mandate.

General Spears has forwarded to me an interesting report by # Colonel^Gardener, Political Officer at Damascus, dealing with the formation of the new Syrian Government. I am sending copies by bag. 2. Colonel Gardener considers that leaders of national bloc are so imbued with nro-Axis sentiments that their inclusion in the i Ministry, ever^if they had wished to co-operate, would have been undesirable ( and-that the present Government is probably the best in the circumstances. He feels that if the Ministry tackles the immediate problems of supplies and of measures [? for] general overhaul of the Administration, it may attain a certain measure of stability. He attaches special importance to (a) formal British recognition of Syrian independence at an early date; (b) a solution of the problem of supplies especially wheat. He believes that it is^on the latter that the future of the present regime turns. This tallies with all reports reaching me. I am taking all .steps I can regarding the second.

In discussions at that meeting and on previous day De Gaulle and Catrqux objected to proclamation of British martial law in Syria or Lebanon, uatroux took the line that if a conflict arose proper course was for him to proclaim French etat de siege; he would then [group undec. ? issue] necessary powers to military commander of areas in which etat de siege was proclaimed.

He makes the following^points: (1) he contests General .ilson’s right to take a decision in matter of demobilisation [? in the] question of French personnel; (2) that to replace them he has had to draw on his cadres which are already poor and this will mean further disorganisation; (3) he wished to point out to General Yilson the bad consequences to our common interest of action taken by General Y/ilson in opposition to the text of [? reports] he had himself signed and without taking intp consideration Catroux’s point of view as the CommanGer-in-Chief responsible for the military under his orders and for the security of territory; General Catroux conpludes by saying that the result of General hi Ison's action is a diminution in military value without any counterpart.

Please approach Catroux and request hhn to nominate Noenig to act with Aston as an alternative to undertake negotiations. We think Koenig should proceed to Deir Es Zor at once for the purpose.

Since the problem [grp.undec] involved in the settlement depends on making French administration acceptable to the Arabs,^it^is essential that French officer sent should be not only of high rank but have full power to make any cnanges in tne administration found to be necessary* tell Catroux that we are endeavouring to arrange through the Emir Abdulla for Thorpeache to be recalled or persuaded to leave the area as soon as possible. 6.

According to the decision of the Control Commission, ceremony is to he held on September 24th to give the gendarmes the opportunity of opting for the Free French. They, however, apparently hesitate to do this, because their wives and families are in France, though the majority, it is stated, will willingly obey the order to continue their functions in Syria. 3. According to correspondence between General Chrysall [sic] and General Catroux communicated to the Minister of State, the Control Commission have taken the^view r that these ‘ ' ‘ ' n ’' * ^ within the meaning of Article 9 or the Armistice Convention, and that they should be retained in the country/’so Ipng as is necessary to ensure the continuance of administration”. He states that although the gendarmes have military status they fulfil numerous administrative functions, such as judicial enquiries, maintenance of public order and general security.

Desire of Lebanese for autonomy combined with close economic relations with Syria, seems to bo crystal lising, though Christian and Moslem elements hold widely divergent views as to what form the relations should take.

While we welcome this initiative by Free French to fulfil their undertakings, weare surely entitled to have proper notice not only as joint guarantors of Syrian independence, but also in view of our military interests in Syria. 2, If there is still time, there are several points which I should like you to take up at once with General Catroux: (1) Paragraph 14 does not apuear to be a sufficient guarantee of the rights of minorities'and it is highly desirable that provisions adequately safeguarding the position of the minorities should be laid down in an exchange of letters with the Syrian Government (see my telegram No. 2683 [of 1st August]); (2) Unless the Commanders-in~Chief are satisfied that paragraph 16 gives them all they require. General Catroux should be asked to amplify this paragraph so as to show that all ports, aerodromes, communications etc. will be at the disposal of the military authorities for the duration of the present emergency; (3) I agree that paragraph 18 on economic and financial measures is too vague. I shall telegraph separately about this tomorrow after necessary consideration has been given to this important question. 4 (4) Value of the declaration would have been greatly enhanced if it had been bilateral in character. This now appears to be impossible, but I hope that General Catroux can induce the Syrian Government formally and publicly to accept the delcaration. Such action would to some extent serve this purpose. [Copies sent to Mr. Coulson], RECd. POL.

The Archbishop Anthony Bashir who has jurisdiction over the two Americas and Australia declared 'Syrian and Lebanese of the orthodox faith all over America are 100$ with G-eneral de Gaulle', The Archbishop declared in a private conversation that he was asked by the Archbishop of Canterbury what was the opinion, as to the political position, of his followers and that he answered that they were all on the side of Free France. The Archbishop also informed us that Henry Haye had offered him an important decoration on behalf of Vichy and that he had declined to accept it. Later another meeting was held in Brooklyn by seventy five of the Sectarian group of Lebanese and Palestinians including Mohammedans and Christians who consider their duty to continue the tradition of co-operation with Free France.

Following is texf of declaration announcing the formation of independent Syrian Government which General Catroux proposed to issue on September 16th. He has been asked to suspend publication for a week and in any case to amend paragraph 12. .[ Begins : ] On June 8th last, when the Allied armies entered -the Levant, I recognised in a general manifesto which I addressed to you in the name of Free France and her Chief, General de Gaulle the status of Syria as a sovereign and independent state. 2, The British Government, the ally of Free France, acting in agreement with her, associated itself in a simultaneous declaration with this [grp. undec. ?important] political act. 3. To-day I come to give effect to my declaration of June 8th, and to translate it from the realm of a [grp. undec.] assurance to that of institutions and laws. L* Hejiceftfr.ward Syria, sovereign and independent, will make her own destinies. 5* His Excellency Sheikh Taj Ed Din el Hassani has agreed to organise the new regime of independence^ His experience of affairs and his deep feeling of public duty designate him for this mission. I assurred him and the Syrian State of my support and collaboration. 6 ¥6c I will exercntee this collaboration in accordance with the following principles, 7® The Syrian state will enjoy the rights and prerogatives attachihg-'to the status of an independent state. These rights and prerogatives will undergo no restrictions other than those which' the present state of war and'the security of territory and of the occupying armies impose® 8® The Syrian sta'^e, v/hich naturally succeeds to the rights and obligations undertaken hitherto in its name is entitled to appoint immediately, diplomatic representatives in ^countries where it considers that its interests require such representation. 9. Everywhere else the authorities of Free F r ance will lend it their good offices to encourage the defence of the general rights and interests of Syria as well as of the protection of Syrian nationals. 10® The Syrian state is henceforward entitled to constitute its own national armed forces. ll d Free France will lend assistance. 12 0 Free France undertakes to ask her [grp. undue.] to recognise the independence of the Syrian state or to confirm their declarations already made on this point as the case may be. : : - 13* Free France considers that Syria constitutes politically and territorially an indivisable united [grp. undec.] which must be preserved from any dismemberment. She will therefore assist in the tightening of political, cultural and economic bonds which unite the different [grp. undec. Vfractionjs of Syria® To this end delegate general and plenipotentiary of Free France will revive according to the policy laid down by the decrees of 1936 the autonomies and any special status previously granted to certain regions so that while preserving the financial and administrative autonomy to v/hich they show themselves firmly attached, they may be politically subordinate to the central authority of Syria. LU I am confident that the rulers of independent Syria will maintain existing legal guarantees in favour pf various communities' and individuals, and will give these guarantees, to which Free France remains firmly attached, their full effect. 15® Free France undertakes to act as: intermediary between Syria and Lebanon in order that the principles of economic collaboration between the two countries may* be discovered and established and the present obstacles to such collaboration overcome. This understanding, which is indispensable between the two neighbouring and kindred countries, must guarantee the legitimate✓ legitimate rights of the respective parties and re-^ establish their relations on a basis of mutual confidence. I 60 In order to safeguard the sovereign independence of Syria, Free France, in co-operation with her ally Great Britain, will for the duration of the war, take charge of the country*s defence. She must be able to prepare this defence in order to make it effective^immediately the^ frontiers are threatened. This entails that the military command should have at its disposal the equipment [grp. undec.] public services of Syria, likewise such national troops as the country may be able to form. 17. It entails, equally, that there should be at all times the closest collaboration between commandant-en-cnef and Delegue - general on the one hand and the police gendarmerie and Sdrete services of the Syrian state on the other hand.^ Syria in effect must be defended in time of war, not only from enemies outside her frontiers, but also from those within, and from dangerous fifth column activities. 18. The inclusion of Syria in the war zone and within economic and financial system of the Allies necessitates the closest collaboration between the Syrian Goverumen j and the Allies for [2 grps. undec.] purpose named in common interest and as long as hostilities continue to ensure the validity and respect of the measures taken to bring victory in e co no mic war. 19. The above stipulations reconcile respect for the independence and sovereignty of Syria with [grp 0 undec 0 ]s of the state of the war. They consecrate and guarantee the accession of Syria to the rank of independent stages, and^they establish rules and obligations which are to govern relations between Free France and Syria during the present period of transition. They are inspired by a single thought, namely to win the war and by this means to ensure for the Syrian people a free and independent future 0 20. The proclamation of June 8 th declared that a treaty of friendship and alliance v/ould be concluded between Syria ana Free France to define their relations in the light 01 tneir obligations to one another and to establish and guarantee independence of Syria. Meanwhile it added, ^ Syria would enjoy the position, prerogatives and obligations of an alii nation. 21. The solution which the present delcaration brings to [grp. undec.] Franco-Syrian question proceeds from the desire of France in spite of the war, not to postpone the fulfilment 01 'another 1 s*.f national destinies or carrying out of lie engagement of the Allieso It is important nevertheless thao a aeiimte settlement..•.•.i,. settlement should take its place at the earliest opportunity settlement which will take the form of the F*anco-Syrian treaty outlined above and which will consecrate once and for all the country 1 s independence 0 Long live independent Syria.’ Long live France.’ [ Ends ], [Copies sent to Mr. Coulson]*FROM CAIRO TO FO RE IGN OFFICE .

No signs are apparent of any unity of views amongst political leaders and press beyond a demand for a change in the present government, for implementation of promises of independence and improvement in commercial and financial situation. Damascus is reported to be in a very discontented state, and those who welcomed us feel strongly that we have handed them over to the French for the second time. General Catroux has been in touch with Hashem El Atassi with a view, it is reported, to the latter's nomination as President of Syrian Government. Hashem »E1 Atassi would probably accept, with the approval of Shukri Kuwatli who remains the real [grp. undec. ? power 1. Shukri Kuwatli apparently still expects a return of the Germans and would be glad for Hashem El Atassi to take temporary office under the real' control of himself. 2. LEBANON . No further political movements have taken place, but realisation seems to be growing of necessity of coming to terms v/ith Free French. Important sections envisage some form of federation of Lebanon with Syria, leaving a wide measure of internal autonomy with common economic policy. 3. Economic situation. The question of supplies of essential foodstuffs has continued to over-shadow political questions,and French and local authorities have so far failed to arrange for distribution of supplies of wheat which exist actually in Syria.

Politics are much to the fore in Damascus and numerous meetings have taken place amongst professional politicians but no concrete result has emerged. Syrians in general whilst desirous of achieving someform of independence, remain opposed to any sort of treaty with the •Free French. Some official Syrians now favour a declaration of Syrian independence on the lines of British declaration to Egypt of 1922. The Syrian Government is inefficient and distrusted and is not co-operating as a whole well with the French. 3. Aleppo. Since the departure of the last Vichy troops public morale has been much improved and new French security chief in conjunction with the British military authorities brought about some improvement in the security position. Turkish frontier is now effectively controlled. 4. Jebel Druse. Friendly attitude to ourselves of Druse has shown a tendency to cool and local attitude is one of disappointment. The French policy proposes to grant some constitutional concessions and a closer liaison with independent Syria. 5. The economic situation. The economic situation remains difficult throughout Syria. Shortage of supplies and rising prices are causing nervousness with regard to the future and a falling in popularity of the British. 6. Relations with Free French. There has been some improvement during last week in this respect which has been due to the establishment of satisfactory relations at Deir-El-Zor/ r♦ • « Deir-El-Zor, the lessening of tension (in the Jebel-Druse) and a more confident feeling amongst Free French themselves as a result of Lyttleton-de Gaulle exchange of letters, French administration is functioning badly due to the shortage of able personnel and little effective government is being carried on outside the main towns. Public security is far from satisfactory and the presence of considerable quantities of arms amongst the civilian population continues to constitute a serious danger.

State Department have received a telegram from United States Embassy at Vichy, stating that they have been informed by the French Foreign Office that British authorities in Beirut have arrested six officials of the'French Foreign Office and one official of Ministry of Colonies to serve as hostages pending the return to Syria of six French officers now in France. According to the French Foreign Office, these six officers had with one exception all been in Syria at the outbreak of hostilities but had left for France well before the armistice had been signed. French Foreign Office maintain that there was nothing in the Armistice*conditions which could justify such a procedure on N the part of the British authorities, but that they do^not wish to raise that particular point. But they want the United States Embassy to interview the six officers, preferably in the presence of a French official, and ask each only to declare whether he wishes to return to Syria to join Free French. United States Embassy have asked to be instructed whether to agree to this request. State Department seemed to be reluctant to authorize their Embassy to conduct such an examination. I should be grateful to learn whether you would like me to press State Department to authorize it. If so, it would be useful to be supplied with further information about the background of this' situation and with arguments to advance to the State Department. RECd. POL.

Weekly political report. Situation remains unsatisfactory in both Syria and the Lebanon. Rise in cost of living and general shortage of supplies is the main concern of the public and has largely overshadowed political affairs. Continued straightened circumstances are reacting unfavourably on the British popularity as great hopes of a return to normality had been raised with the arrival of allied forces. 2. On neither side is there any channel upon which to ' start treaty negotiations. Publication of de Gaulle- Lyttelton letters of August 7th has made it clear that the British are not prepared to play politics in Syria and that the Syrians must try and work out their own salvation with the French. This has been a disappointment to many. It is being said in some quarters that the French and British declarations of June 8th regarding independence etc. do not bind Syrians and Lebanese as they were never consulted beforehand and declarations were based on assumptions not necessarily true. Considerable sections of political opinion do not consider the present time propitious for negotiations and there is reluctance to be tied to a ,, movement“ which has no status as a government and whose leader is under sentence of death, 3. General deGaulle's tour throughout Syria passed off without incident and aroused no particular enthusiasm. 4. In Syria Shuri Quwatli is reported as having gained complete ascendancy in nationalist bloc, Jamil Mardan has lost his influence through his relations with Sheik Taj El Din El Hasan. Nationalists are said to be exerting pressure on Khalid El Azm Government to appoint candidates to various offices and are also sending emissaries to the nationalist groups in the Lebanon with a view to resurrecting old disputes over the frontier between Syria and the Lebanon.5* Government’s intentions as regards Syrian Government are uncertain, one school of thought favouring a * ■ Government under Sheik Taj El Din El Hasan, Ind others the Nationalists &amp; ^ Government com POsed of a number of moderate 6,^ ^There is reported to he increasing unrest in Hauran and an intensifying of a separatist tendency due to French mis-government, economic distress and relative prosperity of neighbouring Transjordan. ^ .

The Free French are pleased at the clear redefinition of their nosition in Syria. (For Minister of State ulease cony to General Spears from Spears Mission Syria number*Soears 83 August 21st reference Embassy telegram No.2515 of August 19th). It has increased their confidence and-ilio~TKeir firm attitude as regards ourselves on questions of principle touching their prerogatives. 2. To Lebanese and Syrians it has been a cold douche but taking the short view a necessary one. The Lebanese, mostly Christians, do not want independence at the moment and many were hoping to make some form of political connexion with the British in the distant future. _io these the oublication has been a disappointment. In Syria uhe reaction has been to clarify the situation and to show the masses where they stand. It has made it clear that_they must treat with the French, if anybody, and opportunist elements may now do so. But it has not increased their real desire for a treaty with the Free French. Many are convinced that the Germans will return at no distant date and [? leaders] like Shukri Kuwatli Pasha, it is reported, decided to play for time and to upset any negotiations which may be undertaken by other leaders. 3. Generally speaking in sp far as our immediate nolicy is concerned the publication has been beneficial as it has dashed false hones and made clear the realities of the British position vis-a-vis the French. In so far as that nolicy was already unpopular with the mass of the people its re-affirmation has tended to lower British popularity. [jiinds].

Spears considers that Catroux is entitled by 3rd Sf a gt h °K i esolu h2 ns of ™ ee .U*g a t Ain Sofar on ugust 8th between Cauroux and '.Jilson to issue order taking over command of Vichy troops.

He added rather naively that he was more ready to do so because he hoped that v/e should not be in active contact ourselves with Syrian and Lebanese leaders or rely on them for our information. But he hoped that we should not press a repuest for the presence of a British representative which he could not admit 0 2. On further reflection I am inclined to feel that the presence even of a British observer at the negotiations would have more disadvantages than advantages for us. Syrians and Lebanese would [grp c undec.] him and his mere presence even as an observer would inevitably lead to some responsibility being attached to us for the negotiations which may fail or take an undesirable turn. 5. I propose to inform de Gaulle when he passes throug' Cairo on August 20th that I note his undertaking to keep us fully informed and that on this understanding I do not for the moment wish to press for the presence of a British observer.

(a) British subjects who have recently left Syria left for neighbouring countries and can scarcely be regarded as parallel case_to French subjects who are being repatriated to France. British subjects leaving Syria were divided into two classes viz (1) travellers leaving on business for indefinite periods who were allowed to take up to £25 or larger sums for long journeys on special demand and (2) persons who declared that they were leaving permanently. Such persons were allowed to take up to any amount. In actual practice nearly all who left were regarded as belonging to the first category. (b) Committee referred to in (c) below decided to consider as ’’holdings” all funds in local currency, stocks and shares, life^insurance policies, land and house property, and gold either in coin or in ingots. (c) A committee was appointed by the President of the Control Commission to report on the measures to be adopted with regard to repatriates. This committee consisted of Brigadier Walsh, Lieutenant-Colonel Wiles, Lieutenant-Colonel Furlonge, a member of the Free French and a member of the Vichy Frency who opted for repatriation. Recommendations approved by the Commission of Control are as follows: (i) All bank balances or other funds in local currency to be released to persons to be repatriated, Banque Syrie being authorised for the purpose to issue cheques in French francs drawn on^their branches in France in order to avoid-all exportations of local currency.

Follov/ing from Minister of State 0 I have received a telegram from General Spears to-day asking whether declared attitude of Vichy Government does not alter the position regarding the repatriation of Vichy troops in Syria and questioning whether it is wise to return troops who may immediately join in some campaign against us. He also asks whether those Vichy troops who do not rally are to be considered prisoners of war. Unless you disagree I propose to reply that Vichy troops are of small military value, that to consider those who do not rally as prisoners of war may easily bring many recruits to Free French, and that in short repatriation should continue in accordance with armistice term;% 2 0 Reuter’s report to-day quotes independent French agency despatch to the effect that General Catroux has placed Vichy troops awaiting repatriation under his command. This decision was announced in an order of the day to troops in the Levant saying that it leaves unchanged liberty of action according to armistice. Prima facie order appears to violate terms of main armistice convention but General Wilson attaches no importance to declaration which he ascribes to reasons of prestige. 3.

We fully realise that our responsibility in this matter is heavily engaged and that a breach of faith would have serious repercussions in the Middle East as well as in India. But while it is true that the Free French are as suspicion of our designs on Syria as the Vichy French and therefore appear inc ‘ to thrust R.T.

[Begins: ] Addressed to Foreign Office repeated to Cairo, Jerusalem, Angpra, Bagdad, Tehran, Jedda (Cairo please repeat to Foreign Office, Jerusalem, Angora, Bagdad, Tehran and Jedda). Following from Minister of State. Wright had-a talk with de Gaulle last night. 2. As regards independence for Syria and Lebanon, de Gaulle said that it was undesirable to hold election in war time. The Syrians and the Lebanese did not want this them selves. He therefore intended to try and get at once a more representative Chamber, and to set up a Senate or consultative body composed of important and representative political personalities. He intended to get negotiations started at once with representatives chosen by these bodies for a treaty or treaties. There were many points which could not be permanently settled in time of war. The important thing was to get negotiations going and if possible to get an agreement of some kind now. 3. - De Gaulle went on to say that meanwhile he would give a certain amount of authority at once to local authorities. He had already handed over to them the running of police services in Damascus, with French advisers attached. This was working^well and gave them a sense of immediate power and responsibility. He would extend the process. 4. De Gaulle then said that one of the most important questions from local point of view was that of French officials. There had been too many French officials in the country in the past. He had already dismissed 55. He would extend the process as fast as possible and enable Syrians and Lebanese to take over themselves as many posts as possible.5* On economic side de Gaulle expressed anxiety that supplies be made available as soon as possible from outside* The country was short in many respects. He hoped that Spears Mission would be able &lt; to take steps withput delay to improve supply situation. This was an important factor m tranquillising local opinion. 6. De Gaulle concluded by referring to activitie-s of certain British representatives among the Arabs m Jebel Druse and desert area, who he was convinced were working against Free French. He wished to make an appeal that tiere should be no rivalry of thi 3 kind, a^d that all our energies should be concentrated on the one thing that mattered, namely to beat the Germans.

Ibn Saud has sent a message through his Consul at Damascus to the Syrian leaders urging them to have full confidence in the assurances given by His Majesty's Government. He assures them that His Majesty's Government keeps him fully informed and that he has heard nothing which could possibly give the impression that His Majesty’s Government do not intend to see that the assurances are . fulfilled. His Majesty's Government have indeed recently i la** * confirmed their good intentions ( vour tel egram N o. 168\ . He urges on the Syrian leaders the need for unity of viev/s and purpose, advises them to be patient with the French and maintain the same attitude towards them in their weakness as when they were strong, and to realise that it is the voice of England which now alone counts and that they should do nothing to make England's task more difficult. He warns them on no account to think that an adventure such as Rashid Ali's which might have cost Iraq its independence could have any success in Syria which is militarily even weaker than Iraq. 2.

Hu- flu Copy to FOR USE BY DEPARTMENTS ONLY Draft letser to the Foreign Office supporting the Government of Indian views and asking for a suggested reply. Previous Papers :—mOJTE. Please see the Government of India’s'telegram No.3960 below the draft. Prom enquiries at the Cabinet Offices it appears that the Ivl.E.I.C. summaries which have so disturbed the Government of India have not yet reached this country. They can&gt; of course be sent J from Cairo to India more quickly than to England. Possibly they are the same as the 'disquieting reports' which have prompted Sir k. Cornwallis* telegram No.832 of July 28Ji. JUy taoe Kouy AlctuKi/ &lt;x r&lt;i c On the other hand, though the information in triese papers is doubtless very incomplete, they contain a number of indications of Moslem anxiety that the promise of independence given to Syria at the beginning of the campaign will be implemented only after considerable delay, or not at all; and of suspicions in various^ quarters as to Free French intentions regarding - this promise. ^The declaration made by General Catroux on benalf of General de Gaulle when the British and Free French Forces marched into byria is flagged. Paragraph 4, which is, of course^ the crux of the matter contains^ an important ambiguity, ^fter declaring that the people of Syria would be 'from henceforward sovereign and independent', it goes on to define their relations with tne Free French as one of 'close unity in pursuit of a common ideal and aims' pending negotiation of a treaty 'as soon as possible'. General de Gaulle refused to allow this declaration to include a statement that H.H.G. supported and associated themselves with this promise of independence, since he felt that this would imply that the declaration could not stand without British support and that the word of Free France could not be trusted. In the end a separate declaration (flagged) containing a statement in the above sense was made on behalf of H.M.G. by h.m.. Ambassador at Cairo, and copies of the two declarations, pinned togetner, were distributed by aircraft. General de Gaulle made it clear that he did not think that a British declaration was necessary, or that it implied that H.M.G. would have any responsibility solving difficulties whicn might arise between Free France and the people of Syria. He added that, 'It is our understanding that any political settlement in Syria and Lebanon is the concern of the representatives of France jointly with representatives of inhabitants of Syria and Lebanon', (Cairo telegram No.1684 of June 4th). Mr. Eden’s telegram of July 3rd to Mr. Lyttelton is the fullest and most reliable evidence among these papers that General de Gaulle considers that the powers of the Free French in relation to Syria are the same as those previously held by the Vichy administration; that he is bent upon excluding the British as far as possible from all say in the administration of the country or the determiniuC&amp;\of its future; and that in his view the fulfilment of the pledge of independence can wait until the end of the war. More recent and even more disturbing, though perhaps less reliable, indications of the French attitude towards the British are given in Jedda telegram No.252 of August 1st; wnile Cairo telegram No.2126 of July 5th and paragraph 7 of part 3 of Genera.1 Spears * telegram of July 8th report the existence in the minds of Genera.1 de Gaulle and his entourage of jealousy of the British and suspicions of their intentions towards Syria. Meanwhile both Ling I bn Saud and the Iraqi Government are givin 0 abundant proof of their anxiety to see the promise of independence fulfilled; and in doing - so they have made it clear that in their view the responsibility rests with H.M.G. (This is no doubt partly due to the fact that Hr Eden's declaration in his Mansion House speech of H.M.GJs sympathy with ^drab ideals of federation and independence came shortly before the beginning of the Syrian campaign). Early in June I bn 3aud enquired 'what statement H.M.G. considered ne night make to the people of Syria and what H.M.G. intended to grant the people of Syria when they complete the occupation of the country, and what pledge they intended to give the Syrians/Syrians for the future' (Jedda telegram No.200 of June 12th). The reply (loreign Office telegram No.141 of June 21st) was to the effect ^ ■ sthat the Free French cind British declarations contained all that Ibn Saud would need to persuade the Syrians of our good intentions towards them. Since receiving this message the King has used his influence to urge upon Syrian political leaders the necessity of co-operation with the British (Jedda telegram No.227 of July 5th). He at once rejected tao,suggestion from the Iraqi Government in June that raq and Saudi Arabia should make a joint approach to H.M.G. on the subject of Syrian independence; but when the Iraqis repeated the suggestion at the end of July, expressing their concern at the^increasing numbed of French officials in Syria,he asked for the advice of H.M.G. aS to the reply he should give them (Jedda No.248 of July 27th). As a result H.M. IvbLnister at Jedda was instructed to give the King a message on the lines of paragraph 1 of Foreign Office telegram No. 168 of' July 30th the last two sentences of which give grounds for hope that thetfrench authorities are on the point of taking definite steps to implement their assurances. Meanwhile the Iraqi Government, having failed to secure tne co-operation of Ibn Saud, have approached H.M.G. on their own oUggesting that it is lor the British to supervise the realisation of Syrian ideaLs (Bagdad telegram No.856 of July 31st and Jedda tele ram No.253 of August 2nd). The Foreign Office have suggested that Sir K. Cornwallis should make no written reply but might speak to the Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs on the lines of Foreign Office telegram to Jedda No.168 (Foreign Office telegram to Bagdad No.734 of August 6th).It will be seen that are in a very delicate position. If they do not show sufficient vigour in supporting and emphasising the d ledge of independence, they risk losing the confidence of the Arab world and being accused of breach of faith. If on the other hand they over emphasise their role in determining the future of Syria, they are certain to have trouble with the F r ee French, besides giving an opportunity for enemy propaganda aimed at dividing the Allies and representing that our ^ concern in Syria is due to our ambitions there. It is proposed to write demi-officially (but formally) to the Foreign Office, strongly supporting the Government of India’s views and suggesting that in reply they should be given ( a ) a confidential appreciation of the situation as it appears to H.M.G., and (b) a statement which could be issued in India, officially or otherwise, with a view to reassuring public opinion. A draft for this purpose is submitted.Draft Paper. EXTERNAL Department. DRAFT LETTER £» V. Baxter Es q., C .la. G., L Foreign Office, S.W.l. SECRET. l^dol\ fa.

One of the principal problems is, with whom he is to negotiate. I have sent you, by bag, a copy of Cairo telegram No. 27 Limit recording the latest views expressed by de Gaulle. 2. Relations of Free French in Syria with ourselves and with the Syrians present a number of difficult problems. ^ ^ have sent you, by bag^ the text of the agreements reached witn de Gaulle covering the former. As regards the latter, count./ is, at present, adopting an attitude of wait and see.

I am advised that it is incorrect to speak of denouncing either Article 8 or Secret Protocol. Correct statement would appear to he that Mis Majesty's Government intend to exercise the^legal right of abrogating arising out of the prior violation by Vichy of tlieir obligations. 2. As regards the Secret Protocol, I appreciate that it is necessary to abrogate it and that we have right to do so assuming you obtain evidence that Vichy have exercised flagrant pressure. Further this course avoids the necessity of faking the line required by paragraph 2 of Article 2 of Interpretation Agreement in your telegram No. 11 Limit that Secret Protocol was void because inconsistent with Article 3. This would have been a line which it would have been legally and morally difficult to justify vis-a-vis Vichy. 5. I am not clear hov/ever as regards the abrogation of Article 8. Do we want to do so because de Gaulle now intends not to leave it to the free choice of the Vichy troops whether to rally to Allied cause or not (vide paragraph 2 of your letter to de Gaulle in your telegram No. 12 Limit), and if so are we going to contend that this is justified because General Dentz has not done this?

The King on the receipt of the draft note had drafted a note in the following sense: He thanks Iraqi Government for consulting him but for following reasons 'does not propose to take joint action e He had feared that as a result of Rashid Ali’s coup His Majesty’s Government might have taken stern repressive action in Iraq, for Iraq had certainly deserved it but the Arabs had vatnessed with admiration the mag nanimous behaviour of the British and the least they and especially Iraq could do was to avoid causing His Majesty’s Government embarrassment 0 He could see no advantage in the joint demarche:it was open to Iraqi statesmen as it was open to him to express their views on Syria separately and informally. As he had already stated His Majesty's Government had guaranteed independence of Syria and Iraq should, as he did, have full confidence that the British would implement their pro mise. It was not for Iraq or Saudi Arabia, however close their interests might be, but for the Syrians themselves to approach His Majesty’s Government should it become necessary. In the meantime the Syrians should seek to achieve unity amongst themselves. 2. Abdullah Suleiman said Ibn Saud wished for His Majesty's Government's approval before sending his reply. I said I thought His Majesty's draft could not be improved upon and in view of your telegram under reference which I had just received I felt I could assrjre him without further reference that it would meet with your approval. I then read him your message and he said he would suggest to Ibn Saud the inclusion of additional argument that a joint demarche would give the Syrians and Free French the impression that he and the Iraqi Government harboured doubts about fulfilment of assurances given.

It is yet much too soon to give definite indication of the Syrian Lebanese attitude to treaty negotiations.

There is considerable political activity amongst Lebanese Syrian noliticians but no definite reports have yet reached us of serious reluctance to negotiate Y/ith Free French. Their attitude will be influenced by the impression which General de Gaulle makes in his contacts not only with Lebanese persons in the two capitals but in other parts of the country also. 5. One thing is quite certain: any difference between ourselves and the Free French vail be exploited to the full by politicians of all parties against both ourselves and Free French. 6. My impression is that the willingness to negotiate will undoubtedly depend upon whether the Syrians believe the Free French are supported by us and upon whether they hold and exercise effective power.

Free French, he said, were just a slice of the same old loaf. He had two objects in wishing me to bring the above information to your notice. Firstly, it was his duty as a friend to warn His Majesty's Government of the attitude of the French towards the British and secondly, he hoped that the British authorities would find it possible to let Syrians know that the French would not be allowed to bully them for holding and expressing pro-British sentiments.

But such action might be thought necessary if he indulged in intrigues or if Germans threatened Syria, and Ibn Saud’s reactions might be less unfavourable if he had been warned in advance about Shukri Quwatli’s oro-German bias, in the same way as we were compelled to open his eyes regarding Rashid Ali. ffauBufi Vith ^Compliments Under Secretary of State for Foreigs Affairs AJjSL // l RECd.

Under agreements reached (see my telegrams Nos. IL and 15 Limit) we admit, pending conclusion of treaties for independence of Syria and Lebanon, civil authority is in the hands of Free French, while British Commander-in-Chief has the right to take any measures of defence necessary for security against the enemy. In these circumstances; issue of visas is clearly a matter for Free French authorities at present. 3. Proposal is being considered by General Ca^roux that visas for Syria and Lebanon should be issued by Free French authorities in Cairo, and by Free French representative in Palestine, (M, Zimmerman), due regard being had to any request made by British military authorities on security grounds.• In Cairo Free French representative is in touch with General Headquarters, Middle East, in matter. M. Zimmerman might make similar arrangements with the British military authorities in Palestine. At the other posts visas might be granted by Free French representatives where these exist.

Following immediate points raised,, ,, !• Under article 1 of supplementary agreement the Royal Air Force, as part of Syrian defence policy will require about 15 aerodromes, 2 or 3 of which are in existence and others will have to be constructed near the railways c The Free French will probably lay claims to Rayaic and Aleppo. These must I submit be resisted. There will be no difficulty in giving them aerodromes at Damascus. . 2* I think^ the^position regarding handing over of aircraft material is clear but a good deal of wireless ancillary equipment is of great immediate use to us, and I hope it will be possible in the agreement to limit the amount handed over to the minimum. The operational aircraft [can] and will be handed over immediately if you ask for it. 3. The Royal Air Force have received a letter saying that by agreement with me the Free French flight at present in the Sudan is to be transferred to the Syrian theatre. I have no recollection of any such agreement, and the arrangement would not be a good one. Some aircraft are needed in Chad, and if the French flight transferred to Syria,, v/e should be obliged either to despatch actual aircraft to Chad &gt; or earmark it for use there,. For your ? rivate information, at one time Headquarters suggested hat the flight should be rested at Asmara and I suspect that as this has been abandoned, do Gaulle is claying for the maximum Free French air attachment in Syria.° This would be inconvenient, as it leads to pressure for aircraft, at present needed for practice squadrons. 4.

(4) Murder of a person in village of Suveyne (province of Urea) on July 20th and theft of his 400 sheep. 2. Turkish authorities state that these crimes were all committed by individuals coming from and returningto Syria. As pursuit stops at the frontier and security services on Syrian side are not yet fully organized, Turkish authorities are unable to prevent these acts of violence. 3. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs requests that enquiries be made into these cases with a view to awarding compensation for damage, and suggests that pending establishment of definite security arrangements in Northern Syria (which I think will be expedited) zwo British liaison officers be urgently appointed to Ras el Suz and Kamichlie, to establish contact with Turkish authorities with a view to preventing occurence of similar incidents. 4.

JJJJJ MOST IMMEDIATE MOST SECRET . Following for Mr. Lyttelton from Foreign Secretary. Prime Minister and I have been considering our relations with Free French in Syria. Please ask Commander-in-Chief to show you his telegram 1/78351 of July End to C.I.G.S. and connected correspondence from which you will see that in a letter, intended for publication, to General Catroux regarding his functions in Syria, which v/as not repeat not shown to Commander-in-Chief beforehand, General de Gaulle has omitted any reference to authority of Commander-in-Chief or General Officer Commanding Palestine. Reference is made in the letter to negotiation of treaties of alliance with Levant States, but I Commander-in-Chief reports that there are many indications that in General de Gaulle's view fulfilment of Free French promise of independence can wait till end of war. Moreover in a note to General Wilson from General de Gaulle it is stated that France retains sovereign power in the Levant and her pov/ers are exercised by Free French who delegate for this purpose General Catroux; Allied armies do not occupy enemy territory, they occupy territoiy of one of the Allies, in this case Free France. Commander-in-Chief states that although existence of martial lav/ (v/hich both General de Gaulle and General Catroux recognise) is a steadying factor clear statement of policy of His Majesty's I Government as regards Free French participation in conduct of I affairs in Syria is most necessary. General de Gaulle's attitude is wholly incompatible with arrangements made with him before action in Syria began. These were that General Catroux was to accompany Allied forces, that he would be responsible for all negotiations to give effect to Free French proclamation except economic clauses and that his advice would be sought in all dealings with the administration and Governments of Syria and the Lebanon; but that until treaty or treaties referred to in the proclamation were concluded and so long as British forces were in occupation of the country final decision would rest with Commander-in-Chief. It was never our intention that Free French should ^virtually stop into the places of the Dentz xidmini strati on or ! that they should govern Syria in the name of France. They should2 . bo given prominent role in our action in order to show trni* French^inmerests in the Levant are safeguarded against a/' other European Power , and that wo have no desire to supplant franco m her privileged and favoured position there. This is, however, one clement only in our Syrian policy, which remains the independence of Syria and all its peoples. No French policy v/hich conflicts with this major decision can be accepted, and as we have shouldered and must continue to shoulder main portion of burden we must see that our policy is followed. It is therefore for Free French to make some kind of arrangements with Syria as we made in the case of jlraq, due allowance beihg made for the fact that in the ultimate issue responsibility for the defence of Syria must for the present rest with us.-1- PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT). / i&amp;c ^ - &lt;j - IS' Ijda*, ^ Co/rK tb+A a* fX^ &lt;ua SECRET.

GERMANY ATP SPAIN . German Air Force officers have recently carried out a very thorough reconnaissance of aerodromes in Spain and in Spanish West African possessions. Note . Spanish Guinea might be of importance in connection with a Vichy-Ajcis attack against the Free French colonies in Equatorial Africa. It would also provide bases for shore-based aircraft operating against convoys. PALESTINE » (b) AR AB AFFAIRS AMD IHTEEMAL SECURITY. The Arabs are on the whole pleased that we have gone into Syria* but, with their appreciation of quick success, the slowness of operations has once more led to unfavourable comparisons between the Germans and ourselves* Neverthe less the Arab merchants are looking forward to better trade as a result of the opening of the Syrian frontier. From the political point of view, although, a large number of Arabs in Palestine are prepared to take any opportunity to further pan-Arab ideals, it is unlikely at present that any rising will originate within Palestine itself* There has been a slight increase in the number of' -2 robamie-s of^.a *mnor anti*-^on-political nature and it would not be sur-orising if there was a further rise in the number of-thebe' p’etEy'aots ofvvivoleric'e* The harvest is nearly over and shortly there will be a consequent increase of idle Arab handso Moreover a number of Arabs of the town class have evacuated Haifa- bn account of air raids, and are scattered parasitically 4 among outlying villages,- (See (e) below) o * ,!f «• Tn connection with the increase in ille^ad.yarms traffic iff the form of •'loot” from Syria (vide* paragraph 9 of Summary 540)^ an unconfirmed report suggests that one Jewish organisation bought £P o 300 worth and another and richer organisation spent several thousand pounds on such arms© (Comment© Although this is probably an exaggeration, it is 'more than likely that there is an element of truth in the report) * The arms are said t® ■ have been purchased from Arabs, and to include modern machine guns© (c} Jewish Affairs, Efforts to reach an approchement betv/een the Revisionists and the 'Left* 1 -have continued without success ? and the former have now raised the old cry of discrimination by the Agency against the Revisionists,• • A member of the Revisionist Youth Movement in a recent private conversation supccrted this point by stating that no Revisionist had^ yet managed to obtain a commission in the Army, whilst in the labour field the Histadruth intrigues continued to bring 'bout a stream of dismissals from employment on The Communists, who have been very active lately in scattering pamphlets, have been placed in rather an embarrassing position oy the Russo—German hostilities, and toe propaganda organisers appear uncertain whao line to tain,o It is understood, however, that meetings are being held to define a policy.

Iraqi Air Force, requested permission to return to Iraq: two letters of his seen in censorship suggest that financial reasons rather than patriotic, prompted the move. ' 1 (iii) Tribal and Prov i nci al» (a) Basra . • x may be stated with some degree of certainty that uhe fact that we avoided anything like a military occupation of the port and shov/ed clearly that vie intended to abide by the letter and spirit of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty, was received in Basra with extremely mixed^ feelings. From those who had been anti-British, we ouite naturally had no thanks at all, v/hile those who had been consistently pro-British considered that we had betrayed them by^ abandoning_ them once more to the doubts and uncertainties entailed in Government from Bagdad. As a whole Basra betrays little interest in our troops. * The first nev/s of the entry of Russia into the war some satisfaction. Nevertheless Russia’s c oility fcp withstand the might of the German war machine was doubted, since the legend of German invincibility is strong m Basra. While some maintain that Germany will have an easy victory, others consider that it v/ill not be so easily gained and further that Russia’s entry into the war tend to make the Iranian Government more friendly towards Great Britain. (b) Amara . Apart from the marked improvement reported in the . pf, ? Lie troops in the district '(see paragraph 14 (b) (hi) (b) of Summary 543), the situation in Amara is improving. The Commandant of Police has been energetic in suppressing Axis broadcasts and certain student agitators have been arrested. ^ (c) Mosul . Since the entry of Russia into the war, the situation in Mosul has improved considerably desuite the prophecy of the pro-Nazis that Russia would, within the fortnight, be suing for peace. The capture of Damascus by the Allied Forces caused the more or less abandonment of the idea that German aid might reach Syria. The situation became so favourable that the loyalist elements urged a demonstration of British troops through the town; this they maintained would have the effect of completely crushing Nazi propaganda#-5 NeTertheless in spite of this improvement, the situation is not altogether stable, as indicated hy the fact that robberies, murders, and other incidents continue to be reported from outlying districts. In Mosul itself, however, various arrests were carried out, which indicated that the Government were waking up sufficiently to take repressive action against hostile elements. Despite this the loyalists were still not satisfied, and threatened to petition the British to effect.a military occupation of Iraq. In support of this rather embarrassing scheme, they said they could produce signatures from all the leading citizens and tribal chiefs. Should this proposal go forward, we are likely to be placed in an extremely awkward position.. If we agree, we would place in Axis hands a valuable piece of propaganda; if we refuse, we will almost certainly lose the support of many who are now our friends. (d) Sulaimaniya and the Kurdish Situation . In view of the disquieting situation in Sulaimaniya, His Majesty's Government considered that the Iraqi Government would be v/ell advised to make reasonable concessions to Kurdish sentiments and to do every tiling possible to convince the Kurds that there was more to be gained by co-operation with the new regime than by resistance* This advice is now being considered and it is hoped that practical proposals will result, which will give a measure of satisfaction to educated Kurds and thereby deter them from supporting Sheikh Mahmoud. In the meantime a new Kurdish Mutessarif, Mustapha Qaradaghi, has been appointed to Sulaimaniya, to replace the Arab appointed by Rashid Ali, and the situation is for the moment quiet. In a recent report received by the Iraqi Government from the Commander of the 2 Division (H.Q. at Kirkuk), who had been sent to discuss the estrangement between the Government and the Sulaimaniya Kurds with notables and tribal chiefs, it was emphasised that Sheikh Mahmoud, so long as he was unmolested and not forced to return to Bagdad, would not take action likely to embarrass Great Britain. The Kurds, whilst disapproving of acts of violence by Sheikh Mahmoud, considered the time was already overdue for remedying their administrative grievances. Certain recommendations' were made in this report, namely (i) Health and education services should be improved. (ii) Experienced administrative officials should be allowed to remain, and not be removed after a short term of office as hitherto. (iii) Subsidy to Sheikh Mahmoud and an offer of a seat in the Senate, and one in the Chamber of Deputies to his son.( c ) P ^ess , PPQ oaA'anda and Radio . The Press, which at first showed considerable caution after resuming publication, has since made more vigorous attacks on Rashid Ali and his Nazis, and at the same time has supported the Government and the British. The opinion is expressed that by the Turco- German Pact, Iraq, has become further removed from the danger of war and that she will become still more secure if Great Britain and her Allies occupy Syria and the Lebanon, Radio news summaries have been thoroughly pro-democratic and those referring to the Russo-German war and the Syrian hostilities have been presented in a reasonably pro-British tone. In the Middle Euphrates area pro-German propaganda is said to have greatly increased Broadcasts from Yunis Bahri continue to have a certain effect among the tribes and his prophecies of the return of Rashid Ali with a strong German force, are creating a certain amount of alarm in tribal circles. Nevertheless a start has been made in combatting this enemy propaganda poison by jamming. 6~’'*7- ' ^ Summary No» 549 - 8th July* 1941 &gt; s 3€ M I D D L E EAST. 12. IRAN . (a) The Army . According to a reliahle, but as yet unconfirmed report five divisions are being brought up to strength. Two are destined for Abadan, ''one for P.oyunduz, one for Kermanshah and one for Julfa. Military stores and munitions are being moved to the Azerbaijan frontier. (b) German Activities . (i) Reference was made in paragraph 12(b) of Summary 547 to German fears of possible British and Soviet pressure on Iranian Government to intern all Germans. This apprehension, it is reported, has been to a certain extent allayed by the German Minister and only a few families have so far left for Turkey. Some have moved to Tabriz. (ii) The Tabriz-Trebizond route is being organised^for the transport of German goods. Quantities of goods destined for Germany are now being collected at Bazergan on the Turkish frontier. • ( Note . In normal times these goods would probably have been transported by Julfa and via Russia.) The leader of the German fifth column organisation is reported to have said that he will now be able to obtain his requirements, of arms and ammunition through Turkey, presumably by the above route. (iii) ( Not to be quoted . ) There has been increasing evidence recently•that the Iranian authorities are showing concern at the misuse by Germany of diplomatic privileges to gain admittance of key men’into the country. The Iranian Minister in Berlin reports being asked frequently to provide the necessary visas for such men to enter Iran and when he demurs, on the-plea that he must refer to his Government, the same names are re-submitted as Couriers and he has no alternative but to supply the visas. (c) Attitude to War . The following are the views expressed recently by Mr. A.C. Embrechts. (Note. Mr. Embrechts is a Belgian and has spent six years in Tehran in the International Standard Electrical Corporation. Since June 1940 he has been employed in the Belgian Legation, and he is considered to be of considerable ability, Reliable and loyal to the Allies)? ■8 (i) German activities . German hold over the communication system in Iran is complete and if and when there is trouble there we shall be unable to obtain any information. There are about^ 2000 Germans of military age in the country who are highly organised for fifth column activities and sabotage. German propaganda reigns supreme. (ii) Pood Shortage . The food shortage in the country is acute and in the Villages starvation is widespread. Serious disorders are shortly inevitable. Should it ever be decided to take over an area, such as the. oil fields where there are no ^ reserve stocks and distribution is difficult, uhe position might be serious unless reserves were built up beforehand. He stressed that in his opinion there was a lack of co-ordination amongst the various British authorities in this area generally and that there was failure to realise the‘seriousness of the danger confronting them. He also said that most of the foreigners from German occupied territories were sitting on the fence waiting for a lead. APPENDIX t A t . THE FREE FRENCH AND THE MIDDLE EAST . (Not to be quoted) JIBUTI SITUATION . .. m. ^ • i » ■' ■■■■■■ 1. The position here is that by recent rapid reversals of oolicy, we are now committed to starving the Colony into declaring its adherence to the Free French. The local Vichy administration had made clear their wish to negotiate direct with the representatives of His Majesty T s Government, but not of the Free French, for a settlement which, pji—the face of it, would have secured British requirements with a minimum of political ill-will and, given tirfre, might perhaps have led to the Colony seceding from Vichy and even eventually joining the Free French fold. 2. In spite of the undoubted hardships and^privations resulting from the blockade, the Jibuti authorities still declare their readiness to negotiate with His Majesty s Government, but their determination not to rally to the Free French movement has increased and, according o .• recent reports, is extending from the officials o e public as a v/hole. Free French propaganda and the J infiltration of agents have been given full I'eign for the past month or more without apparent result except the intensification of the dislike for General de Gaulle and • his movement, now described as general among the population.X 3. The Governor has made it clear that any attempt to seize the Colony will result in the destruction ox all communications and other facilities,. Competent ohoeryers aie convinced that this is no idle threat and that there is every chance that, if forced into surrender hy blockade, the demolition scheme will first he put into el feet» 4 3 The Jibuti spokesman’s latest intimation includes a suggestion that an cmicable agreement is still possible and that it might have a favourable effect on Anglo-French relations in general, provided General de Gaulle ceases to be a political figure and assumes the purely military status °i ^ general fighting for Britain. Free French policy, on the otner hand, inclines .to the use of force to exploit any dissidence that‘may result from the blockade or the propaganda directed at the Colony, There is a grave risk that any at J em P r, 5 t 4 .£ 0r Si^ e intervention may result in hostilities, not only wit e French, but with ourselves as their sponsors, and lead to a military commitment for which we and not the Free French will forced to find the resources. In present circumstances, from the local aspect, the results would not seem to justify the nsxs, not the least of which is a large additionto the useless mouths we already are responsible for in bast Africa® 5 o The- Free French authorities appear to be either wilfully blind to.* or incapable Of realising, the dislike v/ithwhic General de Gaulle and his movement are regarded m Jibuti and, by the process known as ,? wishful thinking , seem still to imagine that the bulk of the French subjects there are waiting to welcome them, once the Vichy administration is disposed of. SITUATION- 6 A study over a period of months of General de Gaulle s attitude: to the Syrian' question, and to Anglo-Free French relations in connection therewith, shows a steady hardening of his determination to step completely into the shoes of the Dentz administration and to deny His Majesty s Government s representatives.any economic or political influence in Syrian affairs It is becoming increasingly clear that, on the question of independence for Syria, which His Majesty’s Government are sledged to support, he is ready to seek excuses for evasion, and that there is likely to be an increasing gulf Ketveen his idea of the implications of this pledge and that of either His Majesty’s Government or the Arab world. 7 Already unilateral proclamations or statements have^been issued bv General de Gaulle and General Catroux without prior consultation with the British authorities. These are ob D ect^nabfc, not so much from their contents, as from the complete absence of any recognition of the British position or of the overriding authority, as long as military occupation or martial lav; is in force in Syria, of the British General Off icer_Commanding-in-Chief. There is a grave danger, if some check is no i, _ imposed, that all the benef^t which has been done to our cause m the Arab world generally’by the declaration regarding the independence of Ivria and His Majesty’s Government’s support of it, will not l orf ybe wasted but that our position will actually be worsened.-10- r &lt;i [ Arab extremists and Axis agents and propaganda are already ( busy stressing that the Anglo-Free French promise v/as ^ merely a further instance of a promise made to gain time r and that once control of Syria is secured it will go the alleged way of other pledges made to the Arabs. The existing uncertain situation in Iraq, the chances of Axis intervention via the Caucasus or Turkey the relative weakness generally of our military position in the Arab fcountries, and the length and vulnerability of our communications through all offer compelling reasons for avoiding.any further setback to Anglo-Arab relations. 8. : General de Gaulle and most of his entourage seem to be incapable of realising three things Firstly , the intense unpopularity of the French (Vichy or Free) in Syria* Secondly, that without continued British military and financial support, their position in Syria would be untenable, and Thirdly, that politically, Syria is part of a wider Arab world on which internal policy in Syria must have repercussions. He deplines to recognise that there is any Arab question at all or that the French are unpopular. Some observers consider that he is verging on megalomania and that he tends to be unbalanced. He has certainly been most unguarded and indeed offensive in private conversations not only with his own compatriots but even in the presence of British officers. It is clear that there is a fundamental incompatibility of outlook which should be taken into account and squarely faced if we are to gain and not to lose from our ^ association with the Free French as far as the Middle East is concerned. y o p ro m documents drafted by .General de Gaulle it is ^ evident that,in his opinion, Free France steps straight into Vichy France’s shoes in Syria granting to^His Majesty s Government only the right to participate in the military task of ejecting Vichy France from power and of providing the funds needed for the establishment of Free French authority in the country. It is not too much to say, iudgine: from oresent indications, and if some check is not imposed, that; once in the saddle in Beirut, Free French intransigeance may grow to the point where we shall eventually find ourselves dealing a ^ ec ^ d e ^ lt io n of Dentz’s High Commission. The only check to this is the existence of martial lav/ v/hich both General de Gaulle and General Catroux have so far accepted and welcomed. Whether in practice, when a test case arises, General de Gaulle will admit that this gives the British General Officer Commanding- in-Chief an overriding measure of control in Syria in _ matters likely to affect military interests, or tnat he will-11- admit that the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief is the judge of what constitutes the latter, remains to he seen. General de Gaulle ? s inability to recognise an Arab problem outside the confines of Syria suggests that he may not regard possible external adverse repercussions from administrative acts inside Syria as falling within this definition of military interests. 10. As shown above, this is a most important point from the aspect of the Allied strategical situation in the Middle East generally. Prom the aspect of relations with Western Powers, the Arab world can no longer be dealt with piecemeal without incurring grave risks in peace let alone in a war in which we are fighting for our existence. In the Annexure to this note are extracts from recent reports by qualified observers of developments in Syria and of the Arab reactions thereto. The tendencies these disclose are sufficient indications of the dangers ahead. lie . In writing the above it is fully realised that, for wider reasons connected with the future of our relations with Prance, it is desirable to maintain and increase the standing and prestige of the Free French movement and that, in any case, we must avoid any opening to Vichy or the Axis to suggest chat we have sacrificed the permanent interests of Fiance in furtherance of our own alleged ambitions in the Middle East, But there are two pertinent questions that may be asked (a) Is the Free French movement likely to gain impetus :.r. France from fighting Frenchmen abroad? Would it not be better served, by killing Germans and Italians and by acting as a military rather than a political organisation, as suggested by the ; Jibuti authorities? (There seems to be little doubt that the movement has been set back in France by the employment of Free French forces in Syria in . direct opposition to promises made that Free French would never be called upon to fight Frenchmen.) (b) Are the risks to the security of our strategical position in the Middle East involved in satisfying Free French ambitions in Syria and Jibuti really worth while, even from the wider aspect of Anglo- French relations after the war, if, as seems not unlikely at present, they act as a hindrance to our winning the war? There is little doubt that, so far, the Free French in the Middle East have been a liability rather than an asset both politically and militarily. s We seem to be fast approaching the stage where we shall have to balance the advantages of a friendly and well-disposed.Syria against those of a satisfied Free French party, since it seems most unlikely that the ambitions of the two can be reconciled, when it comes to the point. It has been estimated that the presence of a Free French garrison in Syria will not enable any reduction to be made in the British forces occupying the country from the internal security aspect, 0 og. if two British divisions alone would suffice, they would still be necessary if a Free French division were added.ANNEXURE TO /iPPEKDIX T A f . THE FREE FRENCH IN SYRIA . EXTRACTS FROM .OBSERVER^ REPORTS. 1. I have spent four days in Damascus. The attitude of the Free French is that they are now of right reinstalled in Syria, and they are in process of re-establishing a form of semi-military rule such as existed before. The people are surprised and disappointed; they realise that it was we who made possible the entry of the Free French into Damascus, and cannot understand why, under these circumstances, we stay in the backgroundo They are disappointed at seeing no sign of a change in the regime. The guarantee which we have given of support for General Catroux’s promise of independence has had little effect. They believe what they see and that, as General Catroux himself told some Druze leaders in my presence, is that the French Flag will fly as it did before, over the whole of Syria. Local impressions may tend to obscure the larger view. It is recognised however that the de Gaullist hope that the salvation of the French Empire and mandated territories from Germany and Italy will influence world and French opinion in favour of their movement may be well founded. But if the method of creating this favourable opinion is such as to add to the difficulties of winning the war, it can only be described as deplorably short-sighted. That it does tend to add to these difficulties I have no doubt whatever. Since returning I have had a message from a well-known Arab Christian saying^that 'the Syrians prefer Germans to any French'. This is undoubtedly an exaggeration as applied to the mass of the people at the present time. They have not yet lost hope that we shall somehow show that their protestations of friendship for us are recognised, and that v/e shall save them from a continuance of French rule and hasten their promised independence. If it was certain that protestations of friendship were designed to create a difficult situation between us and the Free French, the issue would be clear. It is certain that it is not wholly so, and even doubtful whether it is at all. To reuel advances made to us is in no way beneficial to the French. Our potential friend becomes our certain enemy, If v/e give encouragement the French are certain to suspect that we are intriguing to reduce their influence. French jealousy and suspicion of our influence recall exactly the jealousy and suspicion of King Faisal’s entourage in 1922 and onwards. Leaders friendly to us in theinsurrection of 1S20 hoped for some recognition from us. Instead of helping them to favour with the Iraq Government we allowed them to he shown that friendship with us was tantamount to disloyalty to their country. We have recently had evidence of the result of that policy there. The capture of Beyrouth will not, in my opinion, ease the situation hut put the seal, on it. Collet will remain 'Delegue 1 * in .Damascus, and we shall merely have a larger and more vailed population to deal with. Improved economic conditions will have only a temporary effect. It is impossjtiLe, hy trying to give the Free French the credit for better times, to obliterate the memories of twenty years. Why, it is being asked, if we are really strong enough to impose our will, do v/e allow ourselve^ to he pushed into the background? If we cannot control a handful of Frenchmen, how can we heat the Germans? Nothing that v/e do will make the Free French popular in’Syriau v/e are doing many things to make ourselves unpopular,, 2- Apart from those tv/o stories, there is another one circulating in Free French Circles against us, namely that we are going to make the French abandon Syria which we will occupy militarily and politically confirming the French Zone and the Lebanon* This story illustrates the intense suspicious the lower class of officer has of us and the degree of Anti- British feeling existing in the ranks of the Free French Forces, I desire to emphasise that the majority of the Free French are anti-British and that the terms 'Free French” and !, Fro--British'' are in the main contradictory terms. I think it is important to recognise this facto Speaking for / myself, I feel no difference in the French atmosphere now, from that obtaining when I was here under Vichy French just over a month ago c The only ,bouquet I ha'.'e .collected oh this trip was given me yesterday and it was faded. It was to the effect that I had done well in net permitting a Union Jack to be hoisted. .. ■ 3, The French do not.appear to realize, or are perhaps unwilling to admit, the extent to which dislike and distrust of everything French has permeated all communities in Syria, f this factor robs the replacement of one purely French administrate on by another of any appeal to Syrians. (a) The decline of French prestige among Arabs is attributed to British intrigue and all the old suspicions are now awake again. The reactions of the Syrians to the appointment of Free French officers as Governors were hardly favourable, but both General de.Gaulle and General Catroux are too complacent and close their eyes to Syrian hostility. De •i95o Parliament under Gaulle T s plan Jamil Mardam, is to summon the who, however, may 13- 14 - prove obdurate on the matter of concluding a Treaty with the French. The Druze are still more opposed to the French connection. 7hile this spirit exists, it will be very difficult for the French to reach a , though according to a recent report, Shukri Kuwatli promised Jamil Mardam that he would not oppose any Syrian Government working with the French. Shukri however did not join any delegation paying respects to General Catroux, It has been noted that no British officer or official has been invited to Free French functions in Damascus or elsewhere, during the campaign. They seem to be excluding us of set purpose, not only from any participation in Syrian affairs but are even debarring us from their conversations and from their sources of Arab intelligence,, to which we had at least some access in the days of the Deuxieme Bureau. (c) On /?5th June, Jamil, Lutfi Haffar, and Faris Khouri were received by de Gaulle, but we have no knowledge of what transpired at the meeting as no British official is invited to any Free French function nor are we kept informed of political conversations between French and Syrians. (d) The Free French complain of propaganda, inspired by Amir Abdullah, to the effect that Hauran is part of Trans-jordan and attribute this again to our encouragement. In fact all unfavourable Arab reactions are traced to us. In his unguarded moments, General de Gaulle expressed himself strongly on this subject, attributing French difficulties with the Arabs to British intrigue; he appears to consider the British guarantee of his pledges to the Arabs uncalled for and superfluous.^ He says he intends to make a Treaty on his own lines which will not allow 'Rashid Alis' to arise; in this he appears to have overlooked the fact that the Franco- Syrian Treaty of 9th September, 1936, and the- Franco-Lebanese Treaty of 13th November, of the same year, were both modelled on the Anglo-Iraqi precedent and practically identical with it and with each other. There are already signs the old abuses, corruption ahd ineptitude will undoubtedly appear again under Free France, just as under Vichy; this will drive hoarded stocks of Syrian produce, which are now timidly responding to the lure of sterling, underground once more, thus again indisposing Syrians and depriving us of a valuable source of supply.&gt; - 15 - Nothing will persuade the French that we do not harbour and encourage anti-French elements on our side of the border, and under this delusion their retaliation in kind appears normal to them. ( 0 ) Fears have been expressed for the safety of any Free French officer in the Jebel Druze, hut similar apprehension might he felt for French officers anywhere in Syria except perhaps in the Grovernment of Latakia, which owing to the personality of Col. Jordan, and to the tendency of the Alawiyin to regard the French as a rampart against the effendis 01 Damascus, has long had a pro—French outlook. The events of the last ten days in Syria and Lebanon ea/e demonstrated one thing very clearly. That is that •^ r&gt; ® nc “ propaganda has not produced the results hoped x°r hy general de Gaulle in either country. This statement o.oes not claim to announce anything unexpected; hut the fact is that General de Gaulle’s name has not had the appeal to the Stench in Syria and the Lebanon which he and o e supporters of the Free French movement had hoped. hP.’te.* Each 01 the above numbered paragraphs is from a different source.Summary No 3 550 ~ 9th July, 1941 ♦ m * * 9c ITALY,, Internal Conditions . The following information was obtained from letters to Italian prisoners of v/ar dated between 18th April and 16th May: Although crop reports continue to be optimistic, there have been several indications that prospects are not as good as they are made out to be. Rain in the north delayed the sowing of maize, and the beetroot crop is bad. A storm near Bologna destroyed the flax, and in Padua ther~ is an unhappy feeling about the harvest. There is a shortage of milk because cows have been requisitioned, and horses and mules have also been taken. The promised bonuses- for oil have not yet been paid. Vineyards are short of vitriol for bordeaux mixtures, and trade is bad at country fairs because there is no -one to attend them. Letters from country folk tell of increased prices for cattle and vegetables. Town dwellers state that tyres are requisitioned from private cars,, shoes are of a few standard designs and contain no leather, cork and rubber being used instead. Paper and envelopes are extremely scarce.Summary No* 552 ~ 11th July, 1941» •r 11. IRAN . A't'ti'butlQ ~to ~bNG War (not to 1&gt;6 Quo'bolj..

POLICY» A note on Brj.tish Propaganda and the Arab world was recently published. In this the theme was developed that, as far as the Arab world is concerned, our propaganda should aim at inculcating the belief that Hitler and his New Order is the principal menace to the Arab world. It was stated that this would be difficult to accomplish unless and until we first had something to build on in the form of a British policy for the future of the Arab world. This however is only part of a wider issue in combatting German propaganda as a whole. Sometime ago in Appendix 'A' to Summary 362 and in Appendix 'A’ 1 to Summary 429, the need of propaganda to convince the occupied countries, and indeed Allied and some of our own people, that there was a better 'order’' than. Hitler's if they would only strive fur it, was suggested. At Appemdix 'A' is a note on this subject received from an independent observer making concrete suggestions in this direction. The outbreak of the German“Russian war, which occurred after this note was written, will give Hitler the opportunity to link the Democracies with the Bolshevists and to assert that something combining the worst aspects of Communism and Capitalism is the only alternative to his own 'New Ordero' This makes it all the more necessary that we should make it clear now to enemy, conquered and neutral peoples that we have 'a firm hope for the future state of the world' to offer after we have won the war.-&gt; We should do everything possible now to exploit the difficulty facing Hitler in having to reconcile two opposing themes in his propaganda, i*e-o one against Bolshevism and the other against 'Pluto-democracy' 0 We must expect Hitler sooner or later to -ISevolve a propaganda formula to exploit our own difficulties in this respect, and the solution outlined in the attached note seems the hest formula so far put forward to anticipate this from our point of viewe In brief the formula or slogan is ' a peoples’ world” as opposed to a world exploited by dictators &amp; This implies more toleration in Russia, of which there are already signs, such as freedom to hold and attend religious services, and just as we ourselves propose to improve our social conditions after the war, so it may be expected that Russia will emerge purified, or at any rate modified, from the struggle also Enemy propaganda will endeavour to show that we shall become contaminated with bolshevism, whereas ours should demonstrate that our influence will help Russia to modify her dictatorship system m favour of one that-is more democrat!.*o ♦ We now seem to have an opportunity to exploit a raa!or.propaganda theme as opposed to our hitherto piecemeal eirorts an^ to turn the tables on Hitler by using propaganda as a major war weapon* This opportunity is however likely to be a fleeting one unless grasped at once 0APPENDIX 'A”. REFLECTIONS ON COUNTERING HITLER* S ' ’ NEW ORDER u PRO PAGODA . 1 # What seems to he missing from our propaganda at present, both for the Arabs and other peoples, is a firm hope for the future state of the world when we have won. 1^ appreciate that for the British people the principal thing is ’’let’s win the war first and not waste time discussing what we are going to do afterwards.” For us as cogs in the Imperial war machine that is so, but not as propagandists to the rest of the v/orld. Such a severely negative appeal is, I am sure, not enough for neutrals or even the slaves of the ’’new order.” Hope for the future, a non-Nazi future, is in my opinion the basic thing we have to propagate, and I believe it would prove a more fruitful line with Germans too, than any that has yet been adopted. 2. • - There is no need for us to commit ourselves by a precise statement - of v/ar aims. What is wanted is general discussion, by non-official but well-known people, as to what the world after the war is going to look like. The fact might even be stressed that these discussions are reaching forward to something which the participants themselves have not yet been able to formulate in their own minds. I cannot help feeling that such discussions would constitute a more insidious and effective attack on German morale, for instance, than boasting about British achievements, such as I have sometimes heard in German from the B.B.C* What is wanted is not a precise plan of post-war Europe, but a loose and visionary ferment which will cause others to build up utopias and world states in their own minds, and talk about' them with their friends. 3* Such a campaign, launched from the side, as it were, by non-official people, and subsequently taken up, as a popular creation already in existence, by British ministers, would be more convincing than one started with a bang from the top. The method also has the obvious' advantage that it does not commit the British Government to anything specific. In fact, there should be only one thing in common to these visions - this is where the propaganda guidance comes in - they should be relentlessly anti-Hitler and anti-Nazi and always take for granted a British victoryo But they should not be continually emphasising the superiority of British ways - the world is fed up with British superiority, and the more real that superiority is, the more they resent it. referred above to the problem of propaganda among enemy nationals. This has been done in the belief that it is a key question which must provide a clue to the needs of propaganda among all non-British peoples including British or Dominion subjects of non-British race. That is why I think juSt i f i? ation for expressing personal views on a matter which is not directly our business out here, because in 5 i a S ge £ se 5 se ° ur ‘business. When I listen to the B.B.C. broadcasts m German, I find much of them extremely crpod «nH t +^ eS fr?? tla J S u &lt; ??n St ^ eSsing the certainty of a German defeat, en&lt;I evils of Hitlerism - but they lack nope. (t daresav something of a differ tot kind is going over t£§ station y Europaeischer Revolution” which I have occasionally heard, but that would lack the authority of the B.B.C.) And hope, I think, would be the most demoralising thing from the point of view of the Nazi war effort, which we could implant in a German'22- Il mind* Hope unmixed v/ith Nazi cynicism-, I am not suggesting of course that it is not a good thing to depress the G-erman as to the outcome of the war, “out in striving so to depress him we should not chal len ge his powers of resistance and we should dangle before his eyes the vision nf a possible future in which he would have a parto do The German is admittedly the toughest case with which we have to deal, and that is why I am sure we should have still better chances with the Italian, with all neutrals, and with the no ^'German subjects of the 'New Order”. 6. Though we may. and in fact, must remain vague, we shall have to coin an appropriate slogan to set over the ”New Order”. This may be our most difficult problem, since slogans are apt to suggest particular, rather narrow ideologies. Our slogan must partake of all the tendencies which are essentially modern, progressive and ”future-minded” in the world to-day* It must be strong enough to stand up against the appeal of mayxisi, class-war ideology to the European masses. It must _pven:'make Marxism seem old-fashioned - as indeed, it is. Negatively, it must hot suggest a British or British-American world, it must not even admit the existence in future of colonies, it should not seem to.,be; offering the. world a greatly expanded British Empire as an.alternative to the present cfiaos, it should imply the opposite.of hll Atavistic tendencies grouped under the terms totalitarian •and' poli'^e-state* ' 7 0 ; It is with some diffidence, and with the idea of provoking other suggestions, that I put forward as a possible slogan ”A People ! s World”o• -If we announce that what we and the Americans are striving to establish is a ”people^ world”, we could then expand and give meaning to this phrase in all the required ways* Let us say that we envisage a world in which the rights of individuals are everywhere respected, where racial and religious communities are allowed free use of their language and culture, where regxmi and local autonomy and national independence are everywhere combinOC with as much curtailment of a^-uceignty as is necessary to secure, v/orld peace and world economic order, where the soil belongs,j individually or collectively, to those who work it, where economic and industrial planning on .a .national as well as on a world scale.are not allowed to lead to regimentation of workers, where there are jobs for guaranteed wages under guaranteed conditions for everyone, where social services for all are in a state of continuous development, where the specific local resources of each country are .exploited in the interests of,its inhabitants and of the world at -large„ 8* Parallel with this social utopia, it might be found useful to offer some sort of spiritual regeneration as a rallying cry; perhaps that we regard this war against Hitler as' a moral purge from v/hich every individual little man has to emerge with a better-personal discipline and more common feeling with his fellows and a determination to. work as unselfishly in the peace as he has done during the war for the good of civilisation. 91 It is not difficult to see how readily the propaganda lines for each separate region may he worked in.to the above. These will be dictated to a large extent by our war policy for that region but it is obvious that the ideology of irredentism and self-determination will be of use everywhere. Even British- controlled territories with strong nationalist movements, the promise of a ’’people's world” is not in effect more than we have already cbmmitted ourselves to in ordinary pronouncements of policy, and it is certainly the least we can reasonably offer anardent nationalist with any hope of winning and retaining his support# • Needless to say, the more we can associate American leaders with such a propaganda campaign, the better it will be 0 10° As for Britain itself, it seems the people have already made up their own minds as to the sort of changes they are going to make there as a consequence of the war, so that propaganda may find itself following rather than leading, and this fact too can be exploited in presenting ourselves to the world as^bearers of a possible world civilisation* In this connection it may be found useful to coin some such phrases as 'Britain's economic revolution' or the 'Second .Dritish revolution' as an attraction for the working classes compare them with nheir own inferior conditions, to our disadvantageo Our propaganda mus': offer the rest of the a Progressive Britain, but progress and a better life for the rest of the worXcTr' ~23Daily Summary No 554 14t h July, 1941 . Ji -A &amp; W O IL MISSION TO IRAQ . The following account of the activities of the German petroleum experts who accompanied Dr. Grobba on his return to Bagdad during the recent rebellion has been submitted, by the Director-of the Government Chemical Laboratory, Bagdad© He points out that owing to the hostile attitude adopted by some of the staff of the oil^ companies in Bagdad follO'fr&amp;ng the Anglo-Iraqi Armistice it has only been possible oo- obtain rather, meagre information from the Iraqi chemists of the Germans, mission’s activities. To the best ©f Director of the Laboratory’s belief the mission consisted of-fbur scieft tists headed by a very able petroloum t* : ‘-€ol6nol ( &lt; ?) Geissmnn. This officer had^»:.d't ; appears ^ been in .'©Marge of the immediate 1 , utilisation of-seized petrol supplies in most t:'v^of ;H the German manor campaigns ? The mission had as its * immediate object the production ..of the maximum quantity ., ; q'of aviation spirit -of 87 octane rating. It is under- :: ^ dittoed .that they succeeded in blending all spirits in * ,vr .Bagdad derived from Abadan up to 92 octane rating, _ .ihough they appear to'' have given the impression that ■ ?.(' they were unaware of the nature and quality of the oil obtained from Khanaqin* being very disappointed when they found it unsuitable for..the production of an • _ adequate aviation spirit. .... J^hThedaissiai arrived fully aware of the presence in ■••..Li-'-' tbe laboratory of a standard C .F,R&lt;&gt;-.engine for the determination of the anti-knock rating of petrol. The apparatus had never been in work but the Germans set it up and hud it working accurately in-a matter of days only. r&lt; Anyohe with a knowledge of these machines pwill realise ' thatthis was a very fine performance-, thoitgh it appears that ‘••the German expert in charge'did. not even need to consult the manufacturer’s manual. Supplies of very pure iso~oetane and n-heptane, and much larg^» quantities of these fuels of commercial q'uality were brought by the Germans,g,apd' ( '-they are stated to have determined very rapidly thejnetane rating of;.-all petrol supplies in Bagdad© They also determined with equal rapidity the content of tetra~ethyi~*lead in the doped petrols. The mission'-Was equipped to determine the tetra-ethyl-lead • in petrol by a very rapid rough method and also by a slower, but mu^h more accurate, ; assay. •- •All determinations were volunietric., thus avoiding the necessity .of the transport of delicate chemical balances and of a* drying oven. Their standard &lt;:■ r reagents ,were put up in ampoule form and they possessed- some very heat special pipettes, flasks, beakers, etc© It is said that the Germans brought with them an ingenious.•'portable circulating and dosing pump' for-the blending and doping of spirit. This appears- to have been last heard of in Kirkuk.r The Germans showed great judgement in picking the A best Iraqi chemists to assist them and they found that Director T s staff were capable of giving very accurate distillation curves on oil products, and accurate results in lubricating oil tests* Nothing appears to have been taken for granted by the Germans in the way of scientific data. The German attitude to well-trained and qualified Iraqi chemists was neither condescending nor familiar; they behaved, in fact, as one would expect reputable scientists to behave, and the Iraqis were impressed by their fine technical skill and fair and accurate assessment of the ability of Iraqi analysts. The Germans appear to have been fully aware that the training and qualification of certain Irhqis educated in Germany had been exaggerated for propaganda purposes and the mission firmly declined to use them in a technical capacity, but only as contact men. M*ost of the Iraqi chemists adopted a passive attitude and volunteered no information to the Germans, who were thus left unaware of certain comprehensive reports based on work done in America and England. The Germans were left to embark on the extremely slow re-determination of these results. Note. A report has been received from Iraq that the German mission revealed their secret process for converting low grade petrol into high grade aviation spirit to Nadim Pachachi, a late member of the Iraq Government and oil expert. This man!is now in Bagdad, but efforts to persuade him to divulge the secret have not so far been successful. x (o) BARI BROADCASTS IN RELATION TO GERMAN INTENTIONS Irt IRAN .~ ( Not to be quoted ). According to reliable information, Bari Radio has been broadcasting comments on the Russo-German war under M information received from Tehran'. These broadcasts have further suggested that Germany T s real objective is Iran. Comment . In connection with efforts to persuade the Iranian Government of the necessity to intern or deport from Iran all Germans, other than the legitimate members of the Legation and consular staffs, this information might be used to emphasise the danger of maintaining their present 'laisser faire' attitude. It might be stressed that Germany*s own ally is proclaiming the &lt; latter*s intention to invade Iran. (See paragraph 12(b) of Sunmary 547) (d) THE ARMS SHIPMENT AT ASSAB . Immediately after our capture of Assab on 11th June, the Shah'made inquiries about the military stores for Iran from the Italian motor vessel 'Arabia' which took shelter at Assab about the time war with Italy commenced. It was found that the bulk of the stores were intact although a few cases had been broken open and the contonta looted. The cargo had been landed and removed to three dumps in different parts of the town. It consisted of machinery and military equipment including anti-tank guns, machine guns, etc. It is now suggested that the provision on our part of shipping to convey 'Arabia*s' cargo to Iran might be used for bargaining apropos of our request that the Axis merchant shipping -25--26- lying at Bandar Shapur should he immobilised by removing either their enemy crews or essential machinery parts - a request to which up to date the Iranian Prime Minister has refused to accede 0 Alternatively it might be used in connection with pressure to secure the expulsion of the Germans. n x s 20. AFGHANISTAN . AFGHAN SENTIMENTS . An Englishman who has recently been in Afghanistan in connection with work on a dam, states that the majority of the Afghans with whom he came in contact were pro-German. This he attributes to (i) education in the German school in Kabul, (ii) association with German en^neers, (iii) education in Germany of certain Afghans who are used for propaganda. This view is upheld by a Polish engineer who recently returned from Herat and reports that popular feeling is entirely pro-German and anti-British. Note.Both these observers would chiefly come into contact with Afghans under German influence, as German engineers are employed on, most of the Afghan developments. 35 X Great George Street, S 9 ¥.1. 7TH AUGUST, 1941.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002c3_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2168</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002c3</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2168</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 6/93(2) 'SYRIA: Situation in – after capitulation of France, 1940.
