PRIME Minister has for long been pressing Ain-ed-Dowleh to enter Cabinet as Minister of Interior. Prince has accepted conditionally upon an assurance that his appointment has the approval of two legations. My Russian colleague and I are agreed that, in the circumstanc esexisting to-day, it would be a mistake to oppose Prince’s nomination. He is strongly Supported by an influential section of Medjliss, and if he and his friends are disappointed they may all join Turcophils. Moreover, it is not impossible that Prime Minister would declare task of forming a Cabinet beyond him. and would insist on Shah’s acceptance of his resignation. It would be hard to replace him to advantage. I am confident that Ain-ed-Dowleh has no sympathy for Turkey, though his enemies have sedulously put it about that he has. [244—992]X.

Section 2. » , — ! » ‘ / [502] No. 1. Memorandum communicated by Persian Minister, January 2, 1915. THE Peivsian Minister presents his compliments to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He has already fully explained to his Excellency the state of things in Azerbaijan, which is causing the Persian Government the keenest anxiety. On the one hand, Russia is carrying on military operations through Persian territory, which violates the neutrality of Persia ; on the other hand, Russia employs Shuja-ed-Dowleh for operations against the Turks. This has gone so far that (as Sir Edward Grey has seen from the translation of a telegram which the Persian Minister sent to his Excellency on the 26th instant), contrary to the wishes of the Persian Government, Persian Cossacks (which are part of the regular forces of Persia) were sent by the Russian authorities with Shuja-ed-Dowleh to operate against the Turks. The Persian Minister, in all his communications to His Britannic Majesty’s Foreign Office, has laid particular stress on the state of public and tribal feeling in Persia which such actions are bound to excite. The Persian Government extremely regret that their appeals and protests have so far borne no fruit, and the situation is becoming graver day by day. The Persian Minister received yesterday a further telegram on this subject, of which he encloses a translation, and he is instructed to appeal most earnestly for the cessation of all acts contrary to the neutrality of Persia, the violation of which is rendering the position of the Persian Government most difficidt. The Minister is further instructed to repeat that the Persian Government look to Russia for compensation for all loss and damage which is caused in Azerbaijan. The Persian Minister begs Sir Edward Grey to grant him an interview at an early date, when he will go into the details of the points to which he has referred in this memorandum. The Minister has just received another telegram from his Government informing him that the forces which fought against Shuja-ed-Dowleh, and caused the latter’s flight to Maraghe, consisted mainly of Persian tribesmen. This confirms the apprehensions expressed by the Persian Minister to Sir Edward Grey that Shuja-ed-Dowleh’s employment by Russia would only aggravate the situation by causing tribal war in Persia. Persian Legation, London, December 31, 1914. Enclosure in No. 1. Translation of Telegram received by the Persian Minister on December 30, 1914, from his Government. YOU are aware of our conversations with the British and Russian Ministers regarding the evil effects of what Shuja-ed-Dowleh is doing by the order of the Russian Government, and of the repeated protests we have made and which have had no result. According to information just received, Shuja-ed-Dowleh, with the forces which he had collected, accompanied the Russian troops to Sujbulak and fought with the Turks. After two engagements Shuja-ed-Dowleh, with a few' horsemen, fled to Maraghe. There is no news yet about Shuja-ed-Dowleh, nor about the Russian forces. Miandoab is now in the hands of the tribes. Consider what commotion all this is likely to cause and how difficult it will render the position of the Government. Seek an interview with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and explain to his Excellency the disastrous effect of not taking into consideration our views.Sir W. T (No. 51.

His Highness showed an inclination to dilate on Persian grievances, and argued that Russia did nothing for Persia, and that task of Government had been made still more difficult by sudden revival of reactionary party under Shua-es-Sultaneh, who claimed to have a Russian mandate.

I could get no definite announcement from Minister for Foreign Affairs as to how the Persian Government would view a British expedition up the Karun, but he allowed that it was only natural, if it was seen that Persia could not protect interests that Great Britain is obliged to safeguard. Instructions have been sent to withstand Turks, but I gathered that Prime Minister and some other members of the Cabinet are afraid lest Persia may consequently find herself at war with Turkey. Foreign Minister himself is much more bellicose, and gave it as his opinion that Turkish advance must be resisted at all cost. He was personally responsible for warning in last clause of telegraphic instructions to Persian Ambassador at Constantinople. Your telegram No. 30 of 3rd February, since received. I have already informed both Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs that the “ Comet ” and “ Shaitan,” with guns and troops on board, have proceeded to Ahwaz. No protest was made. If I send in an official note on the subject it is sure to call forth some foolishly worded, querulous reply that will be annoying, without, of course, causing us to change our attitude. I will now make a similar verbal communi cation stating that the 7th Rajputs are proceeding up the river, and would propose not to send in an official note [? unless it] would appear from Persian answer that situation demands such a communication.

Sir:- I have the honour to transmit to you herewith trans- latlons of a correspondence exchanged between the Russian Legation and the Persian Government, the copies of which have been communicated to me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon the subject of the looting of the property and effects of the Russian Consul at Soujboulalc by the Turkish troops. It will be seen tha.t the Russian Minister has threatened that the Russian Consuls in Azerbaijan will be instructed to seize all the property and effects of the Turkish consuls unless immediate orders are issued for the restitution of the stolen property. In their reply the Persian Government recapitulate incidents which occurred in connexion with the arrest and expulsion by the Russians of the Turkish Consul General at Tabriz, and state that representations have been duly made to the Turkish authorities here end at Constantinople. Occasion is taken to call the attention of the Russian Minister to the fact that the Government cannot communicate freely with their own officials on the spot, either by post or telegraph, because both services are in the hands of the Russian Military Authorities. A request is also preferred that Shuja-ed-Dowleh may leave Azerbaijan. (Signed) I have, 3tc., Walter Townley &gt;ir E.

According to information which has reached me by telegraph, the Turks a.t Soujboulak have seized the property and effects of Colonel Ayas the Consul there.

(Signed) Korostovetz.Note from the Persian Government to Russian Legation. 2nd of Safar 1333. No.39/4529. Translation. In answer to Your Excellency's note of the 23rd Moharrem, No.205, I have the honour to state that at the same time as I received your note information reached me telegraphically from Tabriz that the Russian Consul General at Tabriz had made representations to the Vice Governor of Azerbaijan on this subject and I had intended to draw Your Excellency's attention to the matter and at the same time to remind Your Excellency of the substance of my note of the 13th Zilhejjeh 1332, No.2755. In this note, I drew Your Excellency's attention to the evil con sequences which it was possible might follow the action of the Russian Ivdlitary Authorities with regard to the Turkish Consul at Tabriz and I requested that the necessary orders should be issued immediately for the release of the Turkish consul's archives and the Consular Staff. You will certainly agree that if on that occasion 'the Persian Government's request, accepted verbally and in writing by the Russian Government, that the Russian Military Authorities and Consuls in Azerbaijan should respect Persia's neutrality, had been carried out, and if steps had been taken to prevent the Incidents caused by the interference of the Russian Military Authorities, such unfortunate incidents which are quite contrary to the wishes of my Government, would not now occur. Just as the measures taken on that occasion by the Russian authorities in regard to the Turkish officials werewere contrary to Persia’s neutrality and I drew Your Excellency’s attention to the fact, most certainly the present steps taken hy the Turkish officials at Soujhoulak in regard to the Russian Consular officer are similarly transgressions of Persia’s neutrality and measures will he taken to draw the attention of the Turk ish authorities at Constantinople and Tehran to the circumstances and they will he asked to take steps to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. For the present the result of the representations made to the Turkish Embassy on the subject is that enquiries will he made on the subject hy telegraph and such action taken as is necessary. I, however, think it desirable to invite Your Excellency’s attention to the fact that telegraphic com munication with those parts having been interrupted for some time past, owing to the action of the Russian Military authorities, and more lately by the arrival of Shuja-ed-Dowleh at Maragha without permission from the Government and under Russian military protection, which adds to the difficulties, as well as the cessation of postal communication, the Persian Government will find it difficult to carry out Your Excellency’s request either by telegraphic or written instructions to their officials. In this connexion I beg to draw Your Excellency's attention to my note of the 23rd Moharrem 1333 in the hope and expectation that Your Excellency will give immediate and definite instructions that the control of the telegraph lines in those districts will be entrusted to the Persian officials and that interference with the Postal Service will cease, and further that Shuja-ed- Dowleh’s presence may be removed from Azerbaijan, to which i— which I have so often referred Your Excellency doth verbally and in writing, in order that, as repeatedly requested incidents may be avoided which are contrary to Persia’s neutrality.

YOUR telegram No. 21 of 26tli January. 1 entirely agree with view of Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs that no advance should be made until we are more sure of our ground. I am most unwilling to believe that present Cabinet is playing us false without conclusive proof of their treachery being produced. Their tenure of office is, however, most uncertain, and money given to friends to-day might well be used by enemies to-morrow. Prime Minister has practically resigned. It has quite passed out of the power of my Russian colleague and myself to procure nomination of Ministers. The sooner Russian troops drive Turks out of Azerbaijan the better. A signal defeat of Turks can alone re-establish situation in our favour. Reports of Turkish successes and German victories have so encouraged hostile elements that there is hardly a man left on our side to-day in Tehra n. Papers that have published our telegrams are practically boycotted. Much the same situation is reported from Ispahan, Yezd, Kasha, and Hamadan. Meshed and Shiraz appear to be calm at present, and Kermanshah still favourable to us. Chef de cabinet told me yesterday that Persian Government had been officially assured by Turkish Grand Vizier that Turkey would entirely evacuate Persia if Russia did the same. I referred him to Turkey’s attitude on the frontier of Arabistan, and said that I had more faith in a crushing Russian victory to restore Persians to their senses than in assurances of a Turkish Grand Vizier, of which His Majesty’s Government had had experience. If there [is] not an overwhelming Russian advance within a short time, situation here will become most serious. Present Cabinet talk about war with Turkey, but I much doubt if the people would acquiesce in its declaration. I have Bakhtiari [? assurances] that they will resist Turkish advance in Arabistan, whether Persia is at war with Turkey or not. Tehran, January 28, 1915.

If the Turks refuse to do so Persian people v/ill be enlightened as to true intentions of Turks.

He trusted that when the war was over we should be able to revise 1907 agreement in a manner satisfactory to both, but he could assure me that, though Russia was willing to allow His Majesty’s Government to extend their sphere' she only wished to retain what she had already got. Referring to question of proposed advance, his Excellency said that he had 100,000?. at his disposal, but that he could not consent to make any advance until changes which he desired in Persian Govern ment had been carried out. He had ample proof from telegrams, of which he had acquired possession, of intrigues which present Persian Government were carrying on with Turks against Russia, and he could not therefore be expected to furnish them with funds. His Excellency then informed me that, in view of murder of Russian consul at Soujboulak, military authorities had decided to send back Russian troops to Tabriz. On my expressing hope that they would return in sufficient strength to render reverse impossible, his Excellency said that there were only some 6,000 Turks and Kurds at Tabriz, but that he did not himself know exact strength of Russian forces.

They have, at the same time, asked that Tabriz manager should not return to his post pending an arrangement which is being negotiated with Turkish Ambassador here. Preparations are being made to send Vali Ahd off as soon as possible. He will be accompanied by Nizam-ul-Mulk, a somewhat aged man, of doubtful value, but the 1 rime Minister says that he is best man available, seeing that Russians object to appointment of Ain-ed-l)owleh. Determined efforts are being made to get the Turks to piove sinceritj^ of their vaunted friendship by withdrawing now that Russian troops have left Azerbaijan. It is confidently anticipated that all will be well if this is done, but of course there would be grave danger for life and property were the Turks to be defeated on Russian frontier if they really proceed thither and were driven back through Tabriz as fugitives. All is reported quiet and order at present at Tabriz, where a present and former member of lurkish Embassy here are with troops, which are now said not to number more than 1,200, including tribal levies. Persian Cossacks who accompanied Russian troops on departure are being sent back. lurkish Ambassador claims that Turkish commander was justified in executing Persian Governor of Soujboulak and his son, because they were discovered to be in secret correspondence with Shuja, whose presence at the head of hostile force has been made the most of by Turks.

Russian troops would he concentrated at Julfa till further reinforcements had been received. His Excellency said that he personally regretted this deci sion as he believed that Russian force, small as it was, would have held its own. what I said that/I regretted was the mistake committed by Russian Government in not following our advice to withdraw their troops when Turks had offered to withdraw theirs simultaneously. Turks would then have been de prived of their only pretext for invading Russia and even if they had broken their promise and advanced on Tabriz Russia would have been in a far better position than she was at present and would not have been held responsible.

His Excellency said that question of withdrawal of Russian troops had never been seriously considered except in contingency of their having to retire before over whelming numbers. Anything that Russian Minister had said on the subject had only referred to latter eventu ality. It was useless to ask Russian Government to with draw them, as they could not'do so without a serious loss of prestige, which Russian public opinion would never tolerate* No confidence could be placed in Turkish promises, nor in ability of Persia to resist Turkish advance. It was ridiculous to pretend that Turkish incursion was due to presence of Russian .trpops and Persia should remember that it was owing to Russia that Turkey had not incorporated Persian frontier dis tricts. Attitude of Persian Government and pf those who inspired it was open to (? omitted: suspicion of) hostility to Russia and proposal to send Ain-Ed-Dowleh, who was well known for his anti-Russian sentiments, to Tabriz was but a fresh provocation* If Russian troops were to be recalled, a situation would be created that would in the end force Russia to annex Azerbaijan,which was [? the) one thing he wished to avoid. Since he saw me yesterday, it had been decided to reinforce Russian troops by a' division. Russia was determined to repel Turkish advance and when once Persian Government realised that she was strong enough to do so, they would very quickly change their attitude. They had up to the present imagined tliat they could presume on Russia’s difuculties and supposed v/eakness. ^ n i ^ Although I said all I could to impress your views on Minister for Foreign Affairs I am personally of opinion that in view of military situation we cannot reasonably expect Russia to recall her troops and .a very oad impres sion will be made here if it becomes^'knov/h^tliat we are urging her to do so. / ' \ / AN1915 Repeated to Teheran.-1 -II Sir G.

L li (j (Similar letter sent toComrnuniquS from the Turkish Embassy to the Persian Press# In reply to the Communique published in the Official Gazette in India on November 2nd, and published in the Ha'd on the 4th of the same month, we make the following asser tions, so that everybody may know that it has been 'Sn^and who has taken measures against Turkey, and that the above communique is an unscrupulous attempt to misrepresent the - real facts of the case. To thwart this plan to mislead Luhaninadan opinion, we intend to explain the facts and to prove that the British Government has always been an enemy of the Khilafat of Islam. The British Government blame the Turks for having purchased two German ironclads, but they do not say why Turkey was compelled to do so. The truth is that some time before the declaration of war Great Britain misappropriated two warships built for us in England without refunding the price which was paid in advance. These ironclads were most essential to Turkish policy. One of the two, which wascalled the 'Sultan Othman' waa confiseated half an hour before the time arranged for the hoisting of the Turkish flag# To replace these confiscated warships the Turkish Crovernment accepted the two German cruisers offered to it by Germany. The british Government complains of the closing of the Dardanelles. The explanation is as follows Under the pretext that some German officers were in the employ of the Ottoman Government, Great Britain had given orders to their ships of war at the entrance of the Dardanelles to treat the Turkish ships as those of enemies and to attack them. Consequently the Ottoman Government was obliged to protect its capital by closing the Dardanelles It is evident that the engaging of the German officers could have no other object than that of Turkish internal affairs and ought to have been accepted as such by a foreign Government. With regard to the assurances said to have been given us by the English as to our integrity, we know full well the value of such assurances# &lt;7as it not Cngland who did all she could to ruin Turkey, when Turkey had appealed to herno her for help in maintaining her integrity during the Balkan War? As a matter of fact it waa England who really fostered, with the help of and other enemies of Islam the Balkan League. At the conclusion of the war Great Britain used her influence to secure for the Balkan States the Turkish territory in Europe. Before the declaration of the Balkan War England issued a proclama tion to the effect that whatever might be the result of the war the status quo in Europe would Be observed. The object of this achiavellian declaration was to deprive Turkey of her rights of conquest in the event of her being victorious. When Adrianople was reoccupied by the Turks, Ur. Asquith threatened that if they did not evacuate the city, Turkey was doomed. The British threat was not confined to Turkey in Europe but she tried to violate the integrity of Turkey in the Persian Gulf by carrying out the plans of her statesmen who advocated penetrating into Arabia. Her efforts in that country to seduce the tribal chiefs had, hov/ever, bailed and by the help of Almighty God, all tribal chiefs are to-day united and are gathered under the flag of their Khalif and Bultan to defend the cause of Islam. The British Government had al way s11 / always shown her hostility in her policy of preventing furkey from carrying out internal improvements. ohe gained the support of Russia and used her influence in European countries to prevent experts from entering Turkish service and eifecting reforms. The German Emperor alone had com- pienended the true significance of these hostile and de ceitful acts, and his Majesty was gracious enough to nominate Sanders Pasha to reform the Turkish Army, which by the grace of God is now fighting the armies of the Allies. To illustrate the anti-islarnic character of British polic/ we need not confine ourselves to her attitude to Turkey. AH Euhanrnadan countries have felt the results of her enmity. In &gt; orocco for instance, after supporting the Sultan and giving him assurances as to the integrity of his State, England threw him into the greedy maw of France*. For by the Convention of 1904 she hoped to obtain the neutrality of France in Egypt, and the signing of this convention was the death knell of two Muharrmadan countries. After a few years a similar Convention was made with Russia respecting the sacred country of Persia and under the term sphere of influence' the two parties pushed their policy of penetration in Persia. Since that time the real object of thatthat Convention, which is a flagrant violation of the rights of nations, has become clear, and the contracting parties have proved themselves usurpers of the sovereign rights of His Imperial Majesty the Shah* The speech made by Gladstone in Parliament in 1894 will always be remembered by the Muhammadan world. He held the Koran in his hand and said:- *'As long as this cursed book” - may God pardon me for even repeating his words - ' exists on the earth there will be no peace' 1 . The British Government whose sentiments these words reflect has unceasingly striven to wipe off the Islamic nations from the list of the free nations of the world. This she does to find profitable markets for her avaricious traders, carrying out her policy under religious pretexts so as to secure for herself the support of her fanatical subjects.

Sir: - I have the honour to transmit, herewith, copy of a despatch from the Acting Consul-General at Isfahan, as marked in the margin, enclosing translation of a proclama tion issued at Isfahan in answer to the British statement published on the outbreak of hostilities between Great Britain and Turkey. The tenour of the document is very hostile, but 1 do not gather that it has made much imores- sion at Isfahan, where we can count on the good will of the local authorities to check any undue expression of popular ill-feeling. Mr. Bristow reports that upon the appearance of the proclamation the Acting Russian Consul-General wrote to the Acting Governor-General in somewhat stiff language and held him responsible for the appearance of the paper. Konsieur Hildebrand telegraphed in the same sense both here and to Petrograd, -he Right Honourabl e Sir E. Grey, Bart., K.G., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. tPetrograd, thereby causing a belief that Morteza Kuli Khan was walking in the footsteps of his father, Samsam-us- Sultaneh. Mr. Bristow's report makes it clear that ■ orteza Kuli Khan took action to suppress the publication as soon as he was advised of its appearance, and that he cannot be held in any way responsible for what occurred. I have so a.dvised my Russian Colleague. • % Mr. Bristow would appear somewhat disposed to find excuses for I&amp;ihassib-ud-Dauleh, Chief LIunshi of the Imperial Bank of Persia there, who as censor permitted the publication of the proclamation, on the ground that he relied upon the assurance of the Chief of Police that it would not appear without the Acting Governor’s sanction. I cannot agree that the excuse is sufficient to exonerate Muhassib-ud-Baul eh for his part in the publication of a violent Anti-British paper. I have spoken to the Manager of the Imperial Bank here, who has promised me that the / munshi will be severely reprimanded, and will be called upon to give us his post as Censor, which he accepted without the permission of the L'anager. It appears that he is an old servant who has rendered valuable services toto the Bank, but is now somewhat past his work.

On the 11th instant a paper, copy of which with a tra.nsla.tion thereof I beg leave to enclose herewith, was published in the town containing a reply to this proclama tion. Shortly after the publication of this document I saw iry Russian colleague who was very excited about it, he attributed the whole responsibility to the Acting Grovernor- General His Excellency Sir Walter Townley, K.C.V.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp; c ., Tehran.© II? u-enera] and said it was but another example of the opposi- oioa of the Bakhtiaris. 1 told Monsieur Hildebrandt that i did nob take so serious view of the matter as he did but x promisea to see the Acting Governor-General ‘on the subject. Morteza Guli Khan, whom I saw on the 14th instant, explained oo me that he had absolutely no knowledge of the document before he saw it in print and that he had then immediately ordered the Chief of Police to collect all the copies and destroy them and to take all possible steps to avoid the recurrence of such incidents^ An unfortunate feature of the affair is that this paper was passed for publication by one Muhassib ed Dowleh Chief Munshi of the Imperial Bank of Persia here. Muhassib ed Bowl eh is charged by the Minister of Education to examine all documents before they can be printed and to decide whether they contain anything against the Mohammedan religion. Muha.ssib ed Dowleh has been to see me and expressed his great regret that he should in any way be considered responsible for the printing of this document, he tells me that the printer undertook, before publishing itm it, to show it to the Chief of Police in order that the governor s sanction might be obtained but this he failed to do, Muhassib ed Dowleh has promised me that in future that if any docraent of this sort is brought to mm for sanction, he will himself show it first to the Grovemor. 1 have, &amp;c., (oi^Tiea) Hmest Bristow^1 X 0 I To remove misunderetandiags or to defend s. ^reau Islamic Empire* (Here follows a verse from the Koran). When the present European War between the following belligerent Powers - Austria, Servia, Russia, France, Germany, Belgium and England - had successively broken out and the fire of war in those countries had flamed forth, it was evident that this burning fire (which ^rom the point of view of those who see the truth is a flame of the wrath of Grod) would speedily spread in other directions; and from another point of view owing to the bonds of friendship existing uetween different powers and the Treaties between them or else on account of opportunities arising whilst their enemies were in difficulties or owing to their expecting a. share of the booty from weaker states and so forth other states would sooner or later enter the arena of combat, For example Japan in spite of the distance remem bered her friendship with her Western friend England, took the place of this friend from west to east and spread the conflagra/tion. Also from the point of view of anticipation and precaution other nations set themselves to complete their military preparations so that they might be ready and that others might not interfere with them. One of these nations was Turkey who from the very beginning of the war mobilised her forces. Other nations, according as it was in their own interests declared their neutrality until such time as they wished to maintain or break it. Since Inter national Law, as the makers of it admit, has no power of itselfitsel f eitner of enforcing the lay/s or nunishing trans- -lessors of the sa/ne and it is only ls.v/ so long as its legality is accepted and the other side does not oocose it with the sword. And this must be obvious, that inter- netional rights which have been drawn up by experts and oooks written on the subject say that Right has a funda mental existence but with all manner of contradiction they sometimes admit and sometimes deny its existence. Some times oney so extend tne skirts of rights that the rights of a thousand years of the other party are annulled, at other times they so restrict the area or rights of weak kingdoms that they cannot even exist or have room to breathe and finally Might is Right: the eye-of politics is blind and the ear of politicians is deaf. The word ”moral' in their religion is blasphemy and to consider truth is unlawful.They will seize other peoples property by any means in their power: this is legal^and to shed blood this is lawful. •/ With this preface we ask what is the meaning of the telegram published by the British Consul and what do they want of us? A telegram has lately been sent by His Britannic Majesty’s Minister to the Consul at Isfahan and the latter had it printed and sent it to va.rious people and distributed it and it has been seen and will be seen • by the bulk of the people. When a Mussulman, and especially a Persian, who for many years ha,s heard and seet^ the friendship, worship of truth, faithfulness, justice, kindness, etc., etc., of England and Russia, towards the countries which have been under their influence operations and communications especially his home Persia particularly in these last yeans owing to our unlimited helplessness they have inter feredITZ, interfered openly in our affairs. They did whatever they likea. One day without our knowledge they divided our country into spheres of influence, another day they sent troops into our country etc., etc. What Persian is there wno is not heartoroken by the heartrending events in Azerbaijan, Kasvin, Resht, Holy Meshed and the overbearing acts of the Russians towards the honoured sacred enclosure of 8tn Iman? Is the unjust and unnecessary interference of the representatives of the two nations and the subject making games of the Consuls and Agents (to which the Blue Looks testify) forgotten? This is why the Persian who remembers these above mentioned sad events and also ponders this telegram is compelled to say that he is seeing a cream as I too thinking I am dreaming wish to see what is meant by this telegram and what is wanted of us. Once again 1 will examine some of the sentences and try to dis- cover their meaning. According to news from British Consul Odessa ships have bombarded that town and burnt a sugar factory and has done so and so to the French and Russian ships, which has aroused the wrath of the British Empire. According to the Governor of Odessa, these ships belonged to Turkey and it is probable that these acts will have a bad effect in respect of Anglo-Turkish friendship. In this connexion tne /iceroy of India has thought it proper to inform the Princes and people of India of British integrity and Turkish breach of good faith and in this case that with which he accuses the ottoman Government is as if he went alone to the judge and made his complaint in the absence of the cefenoant and what is more amusing still he leaves the decision of this case to the peoples of India who are enslaved171 enslaved under his own far reaching hand and whom he has deprived of every kind of spiritual and temporal power such as money, arms, freedom and progress and it is quite evident that if this people of India had any power to speak the truth in the first place they would exclaim against England and would say what is the East India Company and what is the Empire of India? and the reason why this telegram has been sent to us also is tha.t as many of the Persians as have been interviewed by the Ministers and other agents of the two Powers have been persons whose relations with them have been quite correct and whose interviews have been in accordance with an accepted programme and afterwards they have had the honour of an interview with Minister, Consuls and Agents and have put their finger in the country and have taken its measure and think that all Persians are the same as themselves, flatterers, timeservers, worldly- minded persons etc., etc., they expect that we should believe the claims put forward in this telegram and put ourselves outside the circle of Islam and have no connexion with the Turkish nation, forgetting that Persians are also Mussulmans and love their greatness and independence more than life itself and that they know you (sc. the British) thoroughly. Pay great attention to and think over what is said in this telegram. For instance if a courageous and zealous person in Egypt were to say where is Egypt and where the English? what is their country? when did they come and when will they go? what are they doing and what do they want of us? you would know him to be an intriguer. If a Muslin Shaikh who ha,d not yet strayed from the path of the true believers were to say ’’Oh Muslins' Islam does not accept the weakness of irreligion ( ?)' and were to read to andI ^4- ano. remind them of some verses of the Koran and warn them of the past and of what may happen in the future^according to British ideas he is fomenting disturbances and they mahe out that he is inciting Muslims against Christians while for many years ^ast Muslims and Christians have been living in the same city village quarter and street without quarrelling. Perhaps Shaikh Shawish would say 'fear not to be slain for ye will not die and you will take your treasures with your God and if ye fear death do not fear it for sooner or later it must come; do not make friends with the enemies of your religion or your existence for it will cause your undoing: look to your bretheren and fear for yourselves: seize your opportunities and give no occa sion to the enemy, rely upon G-od and make yourselves free so tha.t Islam shall have no connexion with slavery or bonds'’ to say such an one is disturber of the peace is wholly un j ust • It is most displeasing to England that Turkey is con sidering the occupation of Egypt and has taken steps in this direction and made preparations and wishes to save Egypt from being under British influence. Certainly if Turkey can accomplish this it is not contrary to Islam, rather it is the desire of every Mussulman and if she did so public opinion would be in her favour, and it would be well that England should deal justly, if she realises her actions to have been wrong to be content with what is hers by right and restore to others what is rightly theirs. And what angered England more than anything is that Turkey should have bought the two ships that the French failed to seize and employed their sailors as she thought fit, also she is displeased at the closing of the Dardanelles butbut she does not consider by what right England prevents Turkey carrying out her own wishes and intervenes in her affairs and how long, pray, will she continue to interfere in the actions of others? Ana should xurkey accept the British demands and honourably observe her neutrality the British Empire would /e a sincere written promise that when peace is arranged the interests of Turkey will be considered and the inde pendence and integrity of Turkey will be sincerely res pected. For all this Turkey is not satisfied with these magnificent promises and has not considered any of them and has again been the cause of anger towards Great Britain from the above much may be inferred. For example the phrase 'written assurance' and from the phrase 'sincerely' the indeoendence and integrity of Turkey will be respected' other meanings will suggest themselves; that is to say insincere assurances and empty promises also can be found among the Powers. Possibly one of those promises was the one regarding the independence of Persia which England and Russia made together and as far as possible they have destroyed our independence and still they do not keep their hands off, and from this viz. that Turkey should honourably preserve her neutrality it would apoear that a lack of honour also exists among the Powers, e.g. when the Russians found us in the extremity of weakness she proceeded in an entirely honourable manner to seize and remove the murderer of the late Sani ud Dowleh and also in an honourable way she allowed Legations, Consulates, Agencies and Telegraph Offices to be used for purposes of sanctuary: and it is also honourable that she has recommended a number of the more honourable subjects of Persia or those who have attached themselves to their cord the honourable injustice that they should not pay taxes to the Government. And® ni And the most amazing thing in the whole telegram is this, that G^reat Britain is the greatest Mohammedan Power ^ ! on earth and the sincere and firm friend of Turkey and has maintained the latter’s position in Europe and has preserved jier from the earthquake of the Balkan war. This should be j answered by the Turkish critics on the lines of history: I 1 who were the instigators of the Balkan states and the h cause of difficulties for Turkey in Europe and in Asia? r&lt;ut tho/t phra.se the greatest Mohanmedan Power in the world” which attribute Great Britain has assumed, this is a (I title recently assumed by Great Britain and the expression 'wounds and pierces the heart of every Mussulman more than a thousand lancets and knives', If in tins recent time of tumult and war the British umpire lixes a price ^or herself it would be for her to v»o.iu a little ano see what will be the end of the matter and for the present to restnoontent with the Empire of ^reat Britain anc India and if she wishes to be considered s.s one of the Powers of Islam the Muslims of the whole world will laugh at her intelligence and politics, for this attribute requires a connexion with Islam and if she has taken this title on account of governing a number of Mohammedans whom she has conquered on account of their own n egligence this is not a sufficient cause for such a title and she had better wait a little and if, notwithsrandi ng she wishes to deceive the Mohammedans of the whole world and to represent herself as the friend of Islam this also is a cause for much surprise and amusement, for there is hardly a Muslin who had not heard the famous words of Mr .Gladstone who taking the Holy Koran in his hand said 'So long as this oook is with the Mohammedans we cannot prevail over them', or in other words this book is the hindrance of civilization. And H ^ k127 And what has been said and distributed in Islamic countries by the tongues and pens of British writers, missionaries, priests and doctors is quite sufficient. What Muslim is tjiere who has not seen the good appearance of the British who has not at the same time tasted their poison? And chief of all the contents of this telegram is that she (Grreat Britain) represents herself as inseparable from Russia and at the same time claims fr^indship with Turkey and Mohammedans. Now a friend is the enemy of one’s enemy. Do the Turks and Persians and especially the Shiahs of the 8th Imam forget the unjust acts of Russia? .dll it cease to remember what they did on the day of Ashoura in Tabriz? Will anybody be still deceived by meaningless words and British perfidy? Are we and the Turks and the rest of the Mohammedans in this world not the people of one religion and one book? But if we are wnau is the object of this telegram and what do they want of us? ano again I repeat this holy verse to my bretheren and so bring the article to a close.

(No. 5.) {January 3, 4*30 p.m.) MY telegram No. 1 of 1st January. Turkish Ambassador replied to representations of Prime Minister that he could only submit request of Persian Government for withdrawal of Turkish troops to the Porte when Russian Minister had officially announced that Russian troops would be withdrawn from all Persia. He of course argued that Turks had only come to Persia in order to nd the country of hated Russians. Prime Minister would like to send Valiahd, accompanied by Ain-ed-Dowleh, to Tabriz, as he considers latter statesman as the only man capable of coping with difficulties of situation. He would also like to send a force of gendarmes [? as well], but he is, I think genuinely, most anxious to not to do anything calculated to wound Russian susceptibilities or to make it appear as if Government were taking advantage of situation. I discussed these points with my Russian colleague this morning. Russian Minister stated that he saw no reason why Prime Minister should not take such steps as appeared to him best when once Russian troops had evacuated Azerbaijan, and added that he was sure that departure of latter would be signal for a general spoliation of all Russian property as well as that of all friends of Russia or protected persons. I am convinced that such is by no means intention of the present Government, and that it is for express purpose of preventing this that it is desired to send most capable politician in Persia to Tabriz. The more I see of the Prime Minister, the more convinced I am of genuineness of his assurances and of his honest desire to carry out an impartial policy. Friendship for Russia is not a crime in his eyes. If situation in Azerbaijan develops in such a way as to make it possible for Persian Government to resume its administration, it will be impossible for them to do much without money. I most respectfully venture to submit that it would be politic to help them in this direction. My Russian colleague has promised to urge this at Petrograd. German Legation is lavish with offers of money, military instructors, rifles, and ammunition. Impossibility of fulfilling such promises is overlooked by i those who think that they see in these offers a chance to get free of Anglo-Russian yoke. We are rapidly coming to be considered as false friend, who is no more than an accomplice of Russian spoliator in disguise. I read Petrograd telegram No. 4 of 2nd January to Russian Minister this morning. He at once said that withdrawal of Russian troops from Kazvin would be followed by departure of Russian colony from Tehran, adding that he would have to send ladies of his family away and advise his colony to leave if they sought his advice. I said that I entirely differed from him on this point. I could see no reason why Russian colony should leave, as I was sure situation here would be greatly improved by withdrawal. I added that things would be infinitely worse if Russian Government had to withdraw troops under Turkish pressure as at Tabriz, and that all chance of propitiating public opinion would be lost unless Russian troops are at once withdrawn from Persia, where they now only serve to irritate and alienate oui filends and to provide our enemies with eloquent arguments against us. I would venture to put on record my firm conviction that withdrawal of Russian I troops is only measure that can now save situation, and that if they are not withdrawn we may find ourselves forced to leave Tehran at an early date. Case would be different if Russia could hold North Persia in such force that Turkey could not hope |t to dislodge her. . . After my conversation with Russian Minister I saw Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs. Nothing transpired worthy of record beyond a solemn repetition of assurances already telegraphed.

You can remind him that I am prepared after the war to dis cuss a revision of the i\nglo-Russian agreement about Persia and that nothing which happens in Persia during the war will be regarded by me as prejudicing this discussion. The paramount object during the war is that there should not be a breach between Russia and Persian Government leading to an &gt; uprising in Persia against Russia and to Persia making common caust with Turkey and Germany. The course that seems to me most hopeful would be withdrawal of Russian troops from Persia and a small subsidy from Russian and British Governments to enable Persian Government to raise a force to repel Turks. If Persian Government then resisted Turks the moral effect in I.Phammedan world would be most valuable. If Turks withdrew the strategic position of Russia on that side would be secured. If Turks overpowered Persian resistance or if Persia played false and made common cause with Turkey the hands o_ Russia would be perfectly free now and in the future to assert her right to protect her interests in Persia whenever it edited her. Whatt Af\, VJhat seems fatal Is that Ilussia should alienate Persia at a moment when Russian available troops are occupied else- where. This course would have the double disadvantage of endanger ing temporarily Russia’s material interests in Persia and at the same time producing worst possible moral effect m r.iohammedan world, which would be most embarrassing uo us. It would indeed be most serious if we were associated with a policy hostile to Persia at this moment. (Repeated to Teheran.) 6mhm ■ Minute Pape Under Secretary..

(December 28, S'SO a.m.) RUSSIAN Minister has informed Persian Government in an official note dated 24th December that it has been found necessary to provide sum of 4,298 r. 50 c. to enable two detachments of Persian Cossacks with artillery to proceed to the assistance of Shuja, and that further monthly allowance of 4,850 roubles, commencing from 21st November, will be provided by Imperial Government, since Persian Cossacks are no longer paid, such moneys to be eventually refunded by Persian Government. Minister for Foreign Affairs requested me to inform you by telegraph of this new Russian departure. His Highness protests vigorously against the use of force hitherto officially considered as Persian against Turks, without even any previous consultation with Persian Government. It is also urged that this action conclusively proves falseness of Russian assurances that Shuja had no official capacity, but was merely defending with his own peasants his property at Maraga against a possible Turkish or Kurd raid. I have strongly advised Minister for Foreign Affairs to exercise moderation in his reply to Russian note, although he maintains that it brands so-called Persian Cossack brigade with its true character. There is no chance of restraining popular feeling if it is policy of Russia to goad Persia by such imprudencies. Russian Minister never alluded to step about to be taken during conversation which took place on 22nd December, nor did he prepare the Government in any way for fact that it was coming.

(December 28, 1014, IT p.m.) IF it is considered desirable, I have reason to believe that I could perhaps induce Persian Government to declare themselves on our side, but negotiations would have to be conducted by me alone or through Persian Minister in London. If Russian Minister took any share in the proceedings, the Persian Government would draw back at once. He is distrusted and disliked to such an extent that no Persian will negotiate with him. Such strong partisans of Russia as Farman Farma and Mirza Yanz, the political leader of Armenians, have strongly impressed on me of late that my Russian colleague must not appear in any pourparlers for a change of Ministry or other matters. The Cabinet realise that Russian Government intends to persist in its present hostile attitude. They feel that if they do not now join us they will be forced before long to declare against us, which would entail Persia’s final destruction. Public opinion will only consent to Persia’s siding with Russia if Cabinet could show that they bad been promised such a return for this action as would secure Persia’s future independence and integrity as well as provide her with necessary funds for re establishing her position. M. Sazonof’s argument used when this question w r as raised some time ago, that Persia might be exposed to a Turkish attack in centre of her frontier if she sided with us where we could neither of us protect her, was not, I think, well founded. Persia could probably put in the field tribal levies composed of Sinjabis, Lurs, and Bakhtiari quite as formidable as any force Turkey could spare to send against her. This force could be stiffened by a body of, say, 4,000 gendarmes under British officers with machine guns. The Sinjabis and Bakhtiari are keen to fight on our side. Every day makes it more clear that Persia cannot maintain her neutrality so long as Russian policy in Azerbaijan continues to be of a nature to inflame popular opinion. Threatening letters are making their appearance. Russian Minister received one some days ago warning him that he would be blown up by a bomb and that the British Minister would suffer a like fate. Christmas Day was fixed for the outrage. By a curious coincidence, on Christmas Eve a youth carrying a bomb was blown to'pieces by its accidental explosion about 50 yards from the entrance gate to His Majesty’s Legation. 2 ?&lt;’ 0 X 1 IDENTlAi Sir W.

Minister for Foreign Affairs has communicated to me, in strictest confidence, copes of series of notes which have been addressed to Turkish Ambassador between 7th October and 27th December protesting in most formal and energetic manner against lurkish incursions upon Persian territory, holding Turkey responsible for original occupation of Azerbaijan by Russian troops, and for their continued presence there, demanding immediate recall of Turkish troops in Soujboulak district, and appealing to lurkish Government on grounds of two countries holding same religious belief to assist Persia to secure evacuation of her territory by other foreign troops by at once recalling Turkish troops, who are violating Persia’s neutrality. One note, obviously m answer to Turkish protests, holds Turkey alone responsible for return of fehuja, since had Turkish troops not invaded Persia he would not have returned. I do not think that a Government which is powerless to do more than protest could have used moie energetic language than that employed in notes, from which it is clear that Turks violated Persian territory before war broke out with Russia. I have been requested not to communicate these notes to my Russian colleague. (Repeated to Petrograd.) II \ 4 [1X78—1079]CONFIDENTIAL. O' Sir W. Tou (No. 388.)

(December 30, 11*20 a.m.) IN accordance with instructions contained in your telegram No. 322 of 25th December, I asked Prime Minister yesterday afternoon how he proposed to guarantee order and protection of life and property of Christians in Azerbaijan if Russian troops were withdrawn, and how possibility of Turkish incursions would be met. He replied that he proposed to employ Cossacks at Tabriz, who should number 1,200 men, and to summon about 3,000 men of the old regiments, which contain good fighting material, making a force of about 5,000 men. He expressed his firm conviction that there would be no disorders, and that this small force would prove amply sufficient to cope with situation. Azerbaijan, he added, could furnish 25,000 men, but the resources of the country could not support more than the number named. Competent commander, even Shuja if necessary, would be found to command force with capable European-trained officers under him. Cossacks would keep their own officers. Situation would also be much improved by presence of Valiahd, who would be sent to Tabriz. His Highness stated emphatically and officially that if Turks did not evacuate )| Persian territory after the withdrawal of Russian troops Persia would fight, and he |i expressed his conviction that with the forces already mentioned, Cossack brigade, gendarmerie, and tribal levies she could command, she would prove more than master of any forces Turkey could spare to send against her. But, he added, Turkey would evacuate Persian territory, he was convinced, though he could not positively say so until he had seen the Ambassador after favourable answer had been received from Petrograd. It would be suicide of Turkey, whose position in the Mussulman world is so distinctly shaken, to risk seeing a Moslem State arrayed against her. By withdrawing her troops Russia would, he said sarcastically in conclusion, achieve the end she had in view. Either Turkish pressure on her flank would be removed or she would have Persia fighting on her side, and her troops could return as friends.

I suggested that Farman Farma might enter into the Cabinet as Minister of the Interior, and Vossuk-ed- Dowleh replace Ala-es-Sultaneh, whose great age made it hard for him to fulfil his duties to the satisfaction of all. Moreover his son, Muin-ul-Vezareh, has [? group omitted: ? made] himself unpopular as his prompter. I suggested that he might go abroad, perhaps as Charge d’Affaires at London, whilst his brother came here, where he could be made useful in some capacity. Pume Minister replied that he could take neither Farman Farma nor Vossuk-ed- Dowleh into his Cabinet, then policy not being the same as his own. He expressed his great esteem for Ala-es-Sultaneh, and thought it would be difficult to replace him. Persian Minister in London might possibly make a good substitute. He added that his own health made it imperative that he should find a Minister of the Interior, but he had made no decision yet. He said that danger of a popular [? group omitted : ? movement] has been much exaggerated, and that he was absolutely certain that nothing of the sort would occur here, though he regietted to have to say that he felt pretty sure that western provinces would declare for Turkey unless Russia changed her policy of creating fresh difficulties for Persia almost daily. In any case he could assure me formally and officially that so long as he remained in office no movement would drive present Cabinet into siding with Turks. * His Highness then said that he had twice tendered his resignation, and that he now intended to insist on its acceptance. He first put forward the plea of ill-health, but then avowed that [? group omitted : ? he] refuses to continue in office if Russia did not alter her policy in Persia, since he felt convinced that it must lead to a rising by the provinces against her and us as her ally, and he did not wish to suffer the disgrace of being President of Cabinet at a moment when sympathy of Persia might be alienated from a friendly Power that had done so much for Persia!

I endeavoured to see Prime Minister this morning, but he was occupied, and, instead, called on me this afternoon. I told him what I had learnt from my Russian colleague , and urged him, in view of the situation at Tabriz, to sound Turkish Ambassador at once respecting withdrawal of Turkish troops. His Highness promised to do so this afternoon, although he said that his hand would have been much strengthened had he been able to tell Ambassador that he had been officially informed by Russian Minister of decision taken. He repeated that if Russian evacuation was genuine one, and if Turks refused to withdraw their troops, Persia would declare war on Turkey. ^ Minister for Foreign Affairs, who called on me shortly after Prime Minister’s departure, confirmed this. Under conditions prevailing, it W'Ould appear to me most desirable that all Russian troops in Persia should be withdrawn. If any remain, Russia’s prestige will suffer serious blow, because it will be said that Turks forced her to evacuate Azerbaijan. As Russia’s ally, we suffer proportionately. There is absolutely no necessity for Russian troops at Kazvin or Meshed or in Mazanderan, and no disorders of any kind need be anticipated. Since we withdrew our troops from Central Persia situation has gradually improved. Effect in north would be much more apparent if Russian troops were withdrawn. Pro- [group undecypherable] German party would no longer have any weapon to use against us, and Turkey would find a united Persia arrayed against her if she did not with draw her troops as requested. nI CD fT: &lt; 6 ^ fl21-47]mm wummmm 1^1 h CONFIDENTIAL.

On my enquiring of Minister for Foreign Affairs whether Russia was recalling her troops from Persia for strategic reasons, his Excellency said that 600 from Kazvin and Urmia districts would probably be withdrawn, but that there was no question at present of recalling those at Tabriz. It might, he added, be necessary to do so if Turks advanced in overwhelming numbers. (Sent to Tehran.)

I have the honour to inform you that the Persian Government has recently stated on several occasions that the Turks will strictly observe Persia’s neutrality. The vice-consul of the Imperial Russian Government at Urumiyyeh now reports that Javid Bey, at the head of some Hurks, with one gun attacked the Russian troops the 12th (25th) October, that is, thirteen days ago. In the fighting which ensued Javid Bey was defeated, losing 100 Kurds. His gun was disabled, the Kurds fled, and Javid Bey himself was compelled to make good his escape. Seventeen capes belonging to the Turks killed together, with some surgical instruments, have been sent to Urumiyyeh. Javid Bey has now asked for reinforcements. 7th instant, and in reply I beg to state that, although protests have been made here and at Constantinople against all actions of the Ottoman Government which might constitute a violation of my Government’s neutrality in the present war, I must draw your Excellency’s attention to the following fact :— Before the declaration of war with Russia and Turkey, when, foreseeing the unfortunate events in Azerbaijan, I discussed with your Excellency the question of the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Azerbaijan, it was pointed out that the Ottoman Government promised that no encroachment would be made on Persian territory, provided that the Russian Government accepted the proposal of the Persian Govern ment, which was equally in the interests of Russia and of Persia. Unfortunately the Russian Government, attributing the proposal of the Persian Government to an intention to take advantage of the war, refused to order the withdrawal of the Russian troops on the ground that their presence was necessary for the maintenance of order on the border of the Caucasus. However, reports now received show that the Russian Government have gone beyond their expressed intention of keeping order on the PERSIA AND CENTRAL ASIA. [December 28.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1.

(December 29, 3‘40 p.m.) RUSSIAN Government inform me that Russian vice-consul at Urmia has informed them of the contents of a letter addressed to Moustafa Lutfi, a Turk's'i officer at Souldouz, to Kurdish tribe of Zergas at Ouchnoue. Author of this letter maintains :— 1 . That there is a treaty of alliance between Turkey and Persia by which Persian Kurds are to organise general rising to expel Russians 'from Azerbaijan. 2 . That any refusal to obey Turks constitutes an act of insubordination against Government of Shah, who is supposed to have given orders to Karapapakhs and A!aches to advance on Urmia with Turks. 3. That present moment is most auspicious for triumph of Islam, to attain wdiich all Alussulmans must rise against infidels. Similar letters have been addressed to all tribes of Persian Kurdistan, which have hitherto not taken part in movement. In the opinion of Russian vice-consul these letters are of great importance. Russian Government state that Kurds are convinced of solidarity of Persian Government with Turkey, an impression which appears to Russian Government to be all the more justifiable in view of the fact that there are no signs of Persian Government taking necessary steps to frustrate Turkish intrigues.
