He expresses his displeasure at Sooltan bin Suggur [Sulṭān bin Ṣaqr Āl Qāsimī] acting at variance to his injunctions and encloses the substance of a letter addressed to him (referring to folios 10v-11). MacLeod states that he does not think it necessary to require him to destroy the fort. He also writes concerning disturbances at Umul Guwyn [Umm al-Qaywayn] and refers to Captain Janner's report which he found valuable, and gives details of the procedures to be carried out for ship registers. In addition, he mentions a request that has come to him from the residents of Rassel Khyma [Ra’s al-Khaymah], via Captain Mailland, to be allowed to build a wall across the isthmus with the view of occupying the old town. He writes that he will seek instruction on the matter from the Honourable Government in Council to whom he has referred the matter.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673714.0x000011#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
