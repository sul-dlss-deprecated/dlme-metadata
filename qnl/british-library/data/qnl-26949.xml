Possibly we might s uggest the substitution of the following as Proviso (i). 'No Branch Bank shall be established by the Company in India or Pakistan without the previous assent of the Government of India or Pakistan as the case may be'. The present Proviso (i) would then need to be re-worded to cover territories under the jurisdiction of the Colonial Office and territories in the Persian Gulf which are the special concern of the Foreign Secretary. The tern 'Dominions' would perhaps be better avoided in the last paragraph on page 2 of the Supplemental Charter. Is there any legal objection to the substitution of 'countriesT? Mr. Fowler . As a recital has to follow more or less precisely the document recited the word 'Dominions' in the penultimate recital has to remain, but the wording could be altered by suostituting for 'establishment. •• .Pfi-kistan' the words fpo^tsA 'Indian Independence Act, 1947* (10 &amp; H Geo. 6 Ch.30).' CMr- I think the result of that reference to Dominions or to the Act is that the words 'India and Paicistan' in paragraph (b) (i) of clause 3 need clarification. If the Dominions referred to in the recital are intended it would be better so to describe them notwithstanding that the Indian Inde pendence Act says the Dominions shall be known as India and Pakistan'. But a phrase such as 'territories for the time being of' inserted before 'India and Pakistan' would tend to remove confusion which might arise from the integration of the States with India or from India ceasing to be a Dominion. Paragraph (b) (i) of clause 3 would, therefore,read (i) territories for the time being of India and Pakistan'. Your suggested new paragraph (c) (i) or proviso (i; might be amended to read :- 'No Branch Bank shall be established by the Company in territories for t^e time being of India or Pakistan without the previous assent of the Govern ment of such territories respectively'. The present proviso (i), renumbered (ii) / should then be prefixed by 'iubject to proviso (i)',as both India and Pakistan are Dominions and Pakistan is not presently ceasing to be a Dominion. I think the proviso renumbered ^covers, by the reference to Dominions, to Suzerainty and to Mandate, all territory the concern of the Colonial Office and the Persian Gulf territories of which the United Kingdom is the Suzerain^. It is, of course, usual nowadays to use a small 'd' for domini ns r where the referenc is not to t.h« self eoverning ones alone and this might be done in&lt;D f-o. ^ &lt;£&amp;Zc J’o 4 ^ 4^9. Miss Emery Paper 1 contains a request from the Treasury for our comments on a Supplementary Charter for the ole Imperial Bank of Iran and on the documents connected with the Bank's application for the Supplementary Charter. I have consulted P &amp; E Department and the Legal Adviser and the draft below represents our .joint views. The constitutional position of India and Pakistan is to some extent concerned, and you may like to see the amendments we are suggesting in the draft.

In the aboTe connection it will be recalled that by a Supplemental Charter granted in 19£2 the Bank was giren power to establish branch banks in the Indian Empire and Iraq. Subsequently by the Supplemental Charter granted in 1945, whereby the term of the Original Charter was extended fcr 50 years from 50th January 1949 irrespeotire of whether or not any renewal of the Bank Concession from the aorernmsnt might be obtained, the Bank was granted inter alia power to establish branches in the Middle^ East countries other than Turkey, and in the Arabian Peninsula, Abyssinia and the coastal territories of East Africa from the borders of the Sudan down to the northern boundary of Portuguese East Africa In pursuance of the powers referred to abore the Bank has established branches in Baghdad, Basra, Bahrain, Dubai, Kuwait, Muscat, Damascus, Baint and Tripoli in the Lebanon and in the near future it is proposed to open a branch at Amman. As indicated abowe the Bank desires that the territories within which it may establish branch banks should be defined afresh. No change of substance, however, is proposed and all that the Directors have in mind is that it is desirable that the relevant provisions of the Charter and Supplemental Charters should be revised in the light of the recent constitutional changes in India. A copy of the lest Directors Report and Accounts and a copy of the Chairman's Statement in connection there with are enclosed for their Lordships information. 2In the above o ircumetanoee * we shall be obliged If you will kindly let us know on behalf of our silent* whether their Lordships are prepared to reoonmend that a Supplemental Charter in the form of the enclosed draft be granted to the Bank subject to such Supplemental Charter being approved by a Special Resolution of the Members at the Bank* The Directors would greatly appreciate their Lordships giving the matter urgent consideration as it is particularly desirable in the interests of the maintenance of the present good relation* between the lank athe Government of Iran that the proposed alteration in the title of the BanK should bo effeeted with all possible expedition.
