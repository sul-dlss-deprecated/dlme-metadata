PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, 22nd November, 1948, / Ca~&gt; I am desired to inform you for such action as you may consider necessary that it has been reported to the Political Resident/Q* a paper called ' a I Arab' which is published by- Yonis Bahri in Paris and is very anti-British is being received and distributed by a local book-seller called Ibrahim bin Mohammed. C.J. Pelly, Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain. I n. -'aTT'T. IPOLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 30th November, 1948. CONFIDENTIAL . S.0.No.C/L-203• Dear Belgrave, Salman Kamal, previous caretaker of the P.R.O. Reading Room,is selling 'Al-Arab' a weekly paper published in Paris and edited by Yunis Bahri, whose anti-British broadcast you must remember during the war. I enclose a copy of the paper and should be glad to have your opinion whether any action against the sellers is ne cessary. From what I know of it, I am not disposed to ask for any. Yours sincerely, 4 Ajf? C.D. Belgrave, Esquire, CBE, Adviser to the Bahrain Government, BAHRAIN.D.O. Ad vis erate, December 2, 1948. V Reference your S.O.No.C/L-203 dated 30th November 1948, 'A1 Arab' has been in circulation in Bahrain for some months, I think I mentioned it to you. Yunis Bahri is well known here - he once described me as 'the infamous dictator of Bahrain', however his present production seems quite harmless and I see no reason to take any action in the matter, at present.

The book-seller is Salman Kamal, previously the caretaker of the 'Reading Room* of the Public Relations Office in Bahrain, and not by Ibrahim Muhammad, He has been in receipt of these Dapers for the last six months or more. Yunis Bahri was an announcer of the Arabic Programme in the German Broadcasting Station during the early years of the last war; he took refuge in France after Germany^ collapse and since then he has been adopting the career of a journalist. He now publishes two papers bearing the i same name - one in French and the other in Arabic, a copy j of the latest issue of which I enclose herewith for perusal. Yunis Bahri^ tendency as.it appears from his ' writing and for which he is remited, is an anti-British no C—SI—2.Tj(SvV P) MTP-(JS18)—22-1 -2ft— 10,00,000 P.T.0.J lt|l&gt; doubt, but not so much as it anti-Bolshevist; and the public interest in his Daper is not so much due to his anti-British •PCL- writings as to the humorous way of his writing and a cynical criticizm chatacteristic of him. He mostly cracks jokes on the King of TransJordan, General Nuri Basha, ex-Premier of Iraq and other Arab personalities who,in his opinion and as he describes them, are Britain's hirlings. So far as I know he has never written or published anything about Bahrain in particular or about the ^ulf in general. ^ 7- &gt; y 7 0 ^ s ,t&gt; , rs* c/*- - c2 ' ^, ^ 30. /V.
