No information regarding date of last registeration.• Secretary asked me whether I thought this query and that of the coming visit of the French Admiral in the Sloop D’Iberville had any special signiiication. I said I did not think so. A visit by a French sloop was made annually or biannually to the Gulf, I informed him and the present visit I thought merely one of them. As regards the inquiry regarding registered French dhows before the War according to our records certain Arab French subjects for political purposes used to register their vessels under the French Flag and the French Consul no doubt wanted to clear up the point as to whether there existed at the present any such boats plying from Muscat ports.B O MBAV r* -s ii,Cuffe Parade, Bombay, 8th February 1939.

If there is any, I shall be thankful to you to kindly give me the names and addresses of their owners and their ports of registry. In the negative, I would like to know, if possible, the date when the last dhow under French flag has disappeared.

This decision sur prises me. On the other hand it was quite normal that the visit of the French Consul at Bushire in 1935 had but an informal character as he was not then in charge of the French interests in Mascat.
