A study of the Order-in-Counoil will make it clear that it will be necessary for you to ieeue new Hules of Court and to consolidate and bring up to date the existing Ethiopia Kales of Court. It may be of general assistance to you in this task to have before you the Egypt Rules of Court, 1930, and a copy of these Rules ie accordingly enclosed. It will not, however, be necessary for the Ethiopia Rules to be se elaborate and detailed as those prepared for Egypt since the Court in Ethiopia applies the Indian Code of Procedure and it will therefore only be necessary for such Rules to bo raado as are required to supplement the Indian Code for use in Ethiopia and to cover other points where the/ Sir Sidney Barton, K.C.V.o. , K.B.E., etc., etc., etc., Addis Ababa0 ?•': l :f :t\o*\e*a T,) - r the Ox*der*ln-Oouncil requires dpeelfle imles# 3* 1 em a*are # horever f thatp both on technical grounds and in view of the considerable time which the preparation of the Kules will entail f you may find it advisable to employ the services of a lawyer to assist you in this task* You are authorised, if you deem it necessary, to utilise the services of Mr. Gardiner and to pay him a reasonable foe, not exceeding £20, which should be charged in the Kxtroordinax’y Accounts of Kis Majesty’s Legation.

Ethiopia Order in Council# 1953. | (Thi# memorandum ia supplementary to the previous memorandum# Mo* J 9132/801/1 of 1931* The references to the numbers of Artlelaa are# unless the contrary la stated# refarencae to the Articles so numbered In the draft Ethiopia Order in Council produced in 1931 and sent to the Legation at Addis Ababa and to the other Departments*) i* As the result of further discussions with H*M« Minister at Addle Ababa, I think that the following amenamenta should be made to the draft of the Order in Council prepared in 1931* After the incorporation of these amendments# and aa aoon as the question of the retention of the death penalty baa been sledded and any consequential additions made as a result of this decision# the new Drier in council can be regarded aa in fin&gt;il fem and ba printed for submission to the rivy Council. when the new order la so printed# it will be neoeesaiy to re-number the Artldlea# as additions and subtractions have been made* 2* Sir 3* Barton wishes an Article on the lines of Article 36 of the Abraaini. Ortiar In Council, i»13, to tm inaartad In th. new draft Crdar, and I agrae with din that thia should b. done. I therefore propose to insert in the new Order imsaediately after the present Article 86 and before the present Article 89 the following Article* 'Article • *(i) where by agreement among the diplomatic or consular M representatives in Ethiopia of foreign states# or some of 'them# in conjunction with the Ethiopian authorities# sanitary or/'or polio® or ottoar regulations aro drown up and wlioro the 'sold regulations* so far os thsjr of feet persons subject to 'this Order* are approved by the secretary of 3tote* the Court M aoy* subject and according to the previsions in this Order, 'entertain any cooplalnt oode against a peraon subject to this 'Order for a breach of these regulations* *(ii) ny person coonlttlng a breech oi such -egulatlona 'shall, on ccnvlctlon, be liable to the punishment* forfeiture 'or fine therein prescribed or* if no such punishment or fins 'is prescribed* ha shall be deeded to have coomitted an offence 'against this Order and be punishable accordingly* '(ill) In any cose where s fine is recovered on s convic tion under this Article* the fine recovered shall, notwith- ' standing any other provision of this Order, be disposed of 'and applied in such runner as may bs provided in the regulations* 'or* if no such provision is made thereon, the fine recovered 'shall be dispose.* of and applied in such wanner se the Consul 'General ahall direct* '(iv) In any cass of urgency* certified by the Consul 'General, regulations of the kind referred to in this Artiels 'shall becowe enforcibls against parsons subject to this Order* 'although they have not been approved by the secretary of ' •tote »n t jfhall continue to be so enforcible unless and until 'they are disapproved by the isoretar of Stats and notifica tion of such disapproval has bean received and published by 'the Consul General. '(v) The consul General shall cause copies of all regula tions referred to in this Article, which have been approved by 'the secretary of state or which have been certified by aim as 'urgent under the preceding paragraph* to be coeiauntested to 'all Consular Courts*' The above draft Article follows Artiols 66 of the existing Ordsr/Ordei* do»«ly # but subject to tl» following auiondaeatst (a) 7b* i«n*lUJ9r tfao w ,g^U^yi± Instwad of pi-wawrlblng a apaolal panalty for a breach of the .^egulatlone In the abeence of euoh a provide® In the egulatlona th«aaelYea&gt; this Article raakse a breach of the Eegulatlona tiunlehable aa an offence against the Order and therefore subject to the penalties provided for In Art id# 46. (b) The Article le made applicable to all persona subject to the Order and not aereljr to British subjects. (These two amendments bring the Article in conformity with the manner in which the new Order is drafted generally.) (o) Provision la made for recking the regulations applicable in case of emergency without the approval of the Secretary ©f •itate in the saise manner as King's Regulations can be *ade enfordble in cases of emergency, (d) revision ia made for the communication of Regulations which have become enforoible by the Consul General to the Consular Courts. This Article deals with a special type of Regulations to be distinguished from ordinary Ethiopian legislation, because these Regulations are drawn up by agreement between the Diplomatic Corps and the Ethiopian authorities. In these oases, though apart from cases of urgency the approve! of the secretary of state moat be obtdned. it ia not necessary that this approval should take the form of hie eeeent to a King's Regulation. It is sufficient that his aaaant should be obtained by forwarding to the foreign Office e copy of the Regulations and that the secretary of state's assent should be signified by telegram or despatch. Sir S. Barton tells a# that in the last year or two the Diplomatic corps and the Ethiopian authorities have et last begun to work together to prepare Regulations of this kind, and therefore this Article, though it has been in effect a dead/dead let tar In the paat, may In the future he of some utility. Where it la desired to make applicable to British subjects ordinary Ethiopian legislation, as Indeed in many cases it may be so desirable, it is necessary that a King* a Regulation should be mads under Article 126 (see pars, (i) (b)) sad it is essential that the principle should be maintained that such legislation la not applicable in principle to parsons subject to this Order in the absence of e King* e regulation. B. Article 00 (1) of the draft Grdsr in Council deals with appeals in criminal matters from Consular Courts to the court of the Consul General. In tha 1931 draft, it was provided that an appeal should lie sa of right in any esse where the offence in respect of which the accused was triad was one in respect of which e punishment exceeding one month*e Imprison ment or e fine of £10 could hare been swarded. But it was stated la my previous memorandum that, if His Majesty’s Minister thought that these limits should be raised, further consideration would ba given to thle matter. sir 3. Barton wishes the limits^ raised to three months’ imprisonment or e fine of £90, and I propose to amend the draft Order accordingly. 4, With reference to Article 34 of the draft Order, which deals with deportation, it is desirable to state, in order to avoid misunderstanding, that my previous memoran dum, in pointing out that. If a deportee was sent through French aomeliland, it depended upon the local French law whether custody would con tinue to be lewful while the prisoner was passing through French territory, and that the warrant of deportation would not necessarily confer any authority affectiva la French territory, only intended to call attention to the legal position and it was not intended to convey the meaning that the route through French ^oaslllana should not be uecd, as long as tbs french authorities took no objection.6* X i ropes# to inMrt in tb« n#w Ori#r • n«v Articl# to com imawdiet#!/ nft«r Artlol# 66 In th« following t#rmos ••Artlol# —♦ M Th# provisions of the Indian Limitation Aot f 1906, *(Act XX of 1906) in their application to Ethiopia shall w apply subject to the following anandnent} in relation to 'auita the parteda of limitation in reapact of natters specified 'in the firet schedule of the Aet shall ha double the periods 'therein laid town.' this text has been prepared with the aaaietenoe of the Legal Adviser of the India Office, and the reason for it is shortly as follows. Article 67 of the Order, in ashing Indian Law generally applicable, maxes applicable the Indian Limita tion Act and the effect is to nafce the periods of limitation there provided apply, not only in eases between British subjeets tried in the consular Court, but also in eaaaa between Abyeaiane and British subjects tried in the Mixed Tribunal, because the Xattar Court baa to apply th* law of the dafandaut. Ttoa Abyaalnlan Law contains no Limitation Aot or anything pro-riding for periods of limitation in the bringing of motions and the result is that, where an Abyssinian is defendant, a clai* can never be dismissed on the grounds of lapse of time, whereas in the oonveraa ease where Abyss in Ians are plaintiffs oases are frequently (or rather should be frequently, if the lawwsre properly applied) dismissed on that ground. The Swiss Legal Adviser to the Abyssinian Oovemment has represented that this position la unfair and that the Indian periods of limitation are too short for use in Abyssinia, sir s. Barton has urged and will continue to urge that the Abyesinlans should produce their own law for the limitation of actions, but he does tain*, and I agree with him that there la a good ground for the lengthening of the Indian periods' of limitation In their application to Abyssinia, because, owing to the conditions under which husineas/buslnoa* !• carried on in that country# and the ganaral nantality odT the inhabitants# tha periods ars too short* d. X also propose to insert a new Article in the draft Order to cobs immediately after the new Article above des cribed and to be drafted In the following termsi *In all matters which# by the Law of Brltlah India# fall ^within the competence of the Presidency Small Cause Courts 'under the ! i^sidency Smell Cause Courts Act 1888 (Act XT. of ”1888)# the court may# subject to the provlsione of this Order# 'and so far as circumstances admit# adopt the procedure and 'practie* laid down for those Courts. For tha purposes of 'this paragraph# the Court of the Consul General shall possess 'the funotions of a High Court of Judicature# and the Consul 'those of the local Government•* Sir S* Barton desired the insertion of an Article along these lines on the ground that it would haws tha great adwantags of doing away *ith the obligation which was thought to axlat at present of writing out in every civil case, however inslgnlfl- cant , on elaborate Judgment containing, a* laid down In Order 80, ml. 4 (8), of tne code of Cirll irooedure, a eonclee statement of the case, points for teteralnatlon, the dseislons thereon, end the reason* for the decisions, end that this provision would leave the court with the obligation only, as laid down In Order 80, Rule 4 (l), of recording in the judgment elRpl.v the points for determination and the jeolslone thereon in the ossa a where the amount or value of the subject natter does not exceed 8,000 rupees, l.e. In practice In nine cases out of ten. This would. In hie view, result in e considerable saving of time an i labour, end would further make It possible under lection 14 of the Presidency umall Cause Courts tot for the Registrar of the court, acting as Judge, to beer cesee under 80 rupees In value, although under the proviso In section34 of this Aot the Consul would b« slvuys free to hssr any such csss hlssolf* In propsring the text of the Article now proposed* I again haws the air an tags of the assistance of the Legal Adviser of the India Office, and I taint it is desirable here to put on record certain observations that Sir Herbert Pearson has nada with regard to the matter* He says, in reference to the sore summary character of the recording of a Judgment, under Order 90, Rule 4 (1), of the Civil rocedure Code, that as a matter of fact aven this is not necessary in the yresidency smell Cauae Courts* A ref arenas to the Civil Procedure Code, dee t ion S, shows the limited application of its sections to 3 resldenoy daall Cause Courts and Order 61 similarly limits the application of the other Rules and Orders and does not aafce applioable Order 80, Rule 4 (1)* In hie sxperlenoe the Judge le not bound to do more than say 'dismiss with costs' or 'decree for so much with costa' though aa a matter of praetice, in anything but the petty suite, he does write a short judgment embodying him reasons* Under Section 9 of the &gt; residency smell Csuee courts Ast, the High Court is given power to make rules (1) prescribing the procedure to be followed and the practice to be observed by the Presldeney small Cause Courts, and (li) empowering the i egis~ trar to hear and dispose of undefended suits and interlocutory applications or matters* It is under this rul*~maklag power that the High Courts have acted and have extended to the gmall Cause Court, as rules under section 9, most of the other provisions of the civil procedure Code* including those relating to the execution of decrees (Order 31)* but generally In an abbrevihted form more consonant with the summary character of the procedure* Though he has no copy available of these High Court Rules, he does not think that Order 30, Mule 4(1), is one of them* There is also under section 14 of the Presldeney amall Cauae courts Act the provision to which air $. •art on/Barton rafarrad that tha local Oorarnaant nay inraat the Ragiatrar with tha Foaara of tha Judga undar tha Act for tha trial of aulta In which tha amount or ralua of tha auhjaot mattar do#a not axoaad 80 rupaaa* Sa aada that tha Juria- diation of tha High Court and tha f raai lancy anall Cauaa Court la concurrent for suits batwaan 1»000 rupaaa and 8 f JOO rupaaa in waltta f that ia to aay» that tha pXalntlff ^ ; c' hi a forum and if ha aalacta tha dnall Causa Court tha dafan- dant haa certain rights of tranafar of tha suit to tha digh Court» autolact to certain raatrictiona as to furnishing security for coats* 7. I also propose v as tha result of ay diacuaaiona with air $* Barton, to insert a third new Article immediately following the Article dealt with above, in the following toms* 'Article —• 'notwithstanding tha prowlaions of the precoding Article, M ln any suit, where the amount or value of tha subject matter 'in dispute doaa not exceed in value £10, tha consul may, 'subject to any direction of tha Consul oeneral, invest with 'powers for tha trial of any specific case or of all such aulta 'or any class of such suits, arising betwean partiaa realdsnt 'within an area to be dsfiaed by tha consul, and for such period 'aa ha thinks fit, any other parson, or body of persona, of good 'standing in the local British community, and any aeclalon or 'Judgment given by such parson or body of persona shall be 'deemed to be a decision or Judgment of tho court and, subject 'to the following provisions of this Article, bo capablo of 'execution aa such* '8. Any appeal fra# a decision given by a parson or body 'invested with powers under tha preceding paragraph, shall be by 'application to tha consular court for a re-hearing before 'tha consular Court* A deelaion of the consular court upon 'sues/*«ucn •pplloatlon and upon tha i*a*hoarlng f if any, shall ha * final and not subject to any further appeal. ”3. An application for a ra-hearlng shall ha delivered, 'within seven days of the date of the judgment or decision, in 'writing to the person or body of persons toy whos) the decision 'wse given, and tranealtted toy hlK (or the®) to the Consul, 'then any such application has been delivered, the decision 'or judgment f which is the subject of the application, shall toe 'suspended until the application has to sen determined toy the 'Consul*' The grounds for this proposal are vary shortly that Abyssinia is a large country with difficult communications sad the number of British Consular Officers holding Courts is small. To meet this situation it has been the practice in the pest, though there has in fact been no authority for it, to set up little local courts of two or three persons to decide very email civil causes* The British communities In thess places are generally Indians and small local Tribunals have been thought to toe suitable. These email Tritounals have recently been re-organised toy ^lr a. Barton and ha considers that in their new fcxm they will toe satisfactory. He now thinfcs It Is right, and I agree with him, that this prsetlcs should now toe legalised, and the text of the Article proposed above is to give effect to this suggestion. (3lgMd) «.t.

Part VI.— Native and foreign Subjects and Tribunals. —( 1 ) Where a native or foreigner desires to institute in the Court an action against a person subject to this Order, or a person subject to this Order desires to institute in the Court an action against a native or foreigner, the Court shall, subject to the provisos hereinafter contained, entertain the same, and shall hear and determine it:— Provided that— ( 1 ) the native or foreigner, if defendant, submits to the jurisdiction, and (2) the Court may require the native or foreigner, whether plaintiff or defendant, (a) to obtain and file in Court the consent in writing of his consular officer or other competent authority to his submission to the juris diction, or (b) to give security to the satisfaction of the Court, and to such reasonable amount as the Court thinks fit, by deposit or otherwise, to pay fees, damages, costs, and expenses, and to abide by and perform such judgment as shall be given by the Court or on appeal. ( 2 ) The Court may hear and determine any case under this ' e ln a other respects according to the ordinary procedure of the Court. (3) No cross action or a plaintiff who is a native vided in paragraph ( 1 ) of or unless, in the opinion o claim relates so closely t&lt; the submission by such p the claim must be held tc action or counter claim.

(4) Where a native or foreigner obtains in the Court an order against a defendant, being a person subject to this Order, and in anothei suit before the Court or another tribunal in Ethiopia that defendant is plaint ill and such native or foreigner is defendant the Court may, if it thinks fit, on the application of the person subject to this Order, stay the enforcement of the order pending that other suit, and may set off any amount ordered to be paid by one party in one suit against any amount ordered to be paid by the other party in the other suit. 118. No action shall be entertained by the Court for the pro tection of any copyright, trade-mark, patent or design by any person not subject to this Order unless either (a) in pursuance of a treaty ; or (b) the Court is satisfied that effectual provision exists for the protection in Ethiopian or foreign tribunals in Ethiopia of the rights and interests of persons subject to this Order in copyrights, trade-marks, patents and designs, infringed by the nationals of the State of which the plaintiff is a national. Where such a treaty is in force the Consul-General may issue a notification to this effect and the Court shall take judicial notice thereof. 119. —(1) Where it is shown to the Court that the attendance of a person subject to this Order to give evidence, or for any other purpose connected with the administration of justice, is required in an Ethiopian or foreign tribunal in Ethiopia, or before an Ethiopian or foreign judicial officer in Ethiopia, the Court may, if it thinks fit, in any case and in circumstances in which it would require his attendance before itself, order that he do attend and give evidence or produce documents as so required. The order may be made subject to conditions as to payment or tender of expenses or otherwise. (2) A Consular Court, however, cannot so order attendance at any place beyond its district. (3) If the person ordered to attend, having reasonable notice ot the time and place at which he is required to attend, fails to attend accordingly, and does not excuse his failure to the satis- laction of the Court, or if he refuses to give evidence, or wilfullygives false evidence, or fails to produce documents, he is, inde pendently of any other liability, guilty of a grave offence under Article 32 of this Order. 120. In the application by the Court under Article 24 of the law of British India relating to false evidence given in a judicial proceeding, proceedings before any Ethiopian tribunal or any foreign tribunal in Ethiopia shall be deemed to be included as judicial proceedings to which such law applies. 121. If any person subject to this Order does any act in relation to any Ethiopian tribunal or judicial officer or in relation to any foreign tribunal or judicial officer in Ethiopia which, if done in relation to the Court or any officer of the Court, would be deemed an offence under Article 32 of this Order, such act shall be deemed to be an offence under Article 32. 122. — (1) Where a judgment is given or order made by any Ethiopian tribunal or any foreign tribunal in Ethiopia against a person subject to this Order in any case in which such tribunal had jurisdiction in respect of such person either by treaty or by reason of the submission by such person to the jurisdiction or other wise, the Court may enforce the judgment of such tribunal in the same manner as a judgment or order of the Court, upon the appli cation of the person in whose favour such judgment or order was made, provided that the Consul-General may at any time direct that the judgments or orders of any such tribunal shall not be en forced if in like circumstances such tribunal fails to enforce against persons not subject to this Order, but subject to its jurisdiction, the judgments or orders of the Court. ( 2 ) Provisions shall be made by Rules of Court for the manner in which an application is to be made to the Court for the enforce ment ot any judgment or order of an Ethiopian or foreign tribunal under the preceding paragraph of this Article, and for the giving ot due notice of such application to the person against whom such enforcement is sought. 123. Where any person subject to this Order is to be tried for any criminal offence in respect of which an Ethiopian tribunal has jurisdiction, and the trial therefore will take place before such tribunal, the Court may, either by separate warrant or by en dorsement on the warrant of the Ethiopian tribunal, cause such person to be detained in custody pending such trial in such place and in such manner as the Court shall direct, or may take security as the Court shall think fit for the appearance of such person at his trial; provided always that no person shall be detained in custody pending trial under this Article for a longer period than three weeks upon such warrant or endorsement, except upon a further order of the Court extending the time, which order the Court may, in the exercise of its discretion, make or refuse to make. The Court shall not, however, extend the time during which such a personmay be detained in custody pending trial for a period longer than a further three weeks. If the person so detained is not brought un for trial within the period of three weeks (or of six weeks as the case may be) aforesaid, he shall be released from custody but the Court may take security for his appearance at his trial.' 124.— (1) Where any person subject to this Order has been con victed of any criminal offence by any Ethiopian tribunal having jurisdiction over the matter, and has been sentenced to pay a fine or to imprisonment, the Court may, as the case may be, enforce the payment of the fine in the same manner as payment of a fine inflicted by the Court can be enforced, or cause such person to serve the sentence of imprisonment in any place which may be appointed as a prison under Article 56 of this Order. (2) The provisions of Article 59 of this Order extend to any person serving a sentence of imprisonment as aforesaid. (3) Where any person subject to this Order has been sentenced to death by any Ethiopian tribunal having jurisdiction over the matter, the Consul-General shall forthwith send a report of the sentence, with a copy of the minutes of the proceedings, and a note of the evidence in the case, together with any observations he thinks fit, to the Secretary of State. The provisions of Article 47 , paragraphs 2 and 3, of this Order apply in the case of a sentence of death imposed on a person subject to this Order by such Ethiopian tribunal.

( 6 ) Every person shall, on every registration of himself, and on every renewal of the registration, pay a fee of two shillings and sixpence, or such other fee as the Secretary of State from time to time appoints.

IAi . 1. November 29, 19^3. Dear irearaon, I’roublea never come singly r and I am afraid there is now another question upon which X am obliged to ask for your assistance; this time it is on the new draft Kthiopia Order in Council, the text of which has already been sent to the India Office, and in which they have concurred. The Legation at Addis Ababa want to introduce certain anendments into the text, and there are three points upon which I need the assistance of somebody acquainted with Indian law. in ^byssinia, too, the Order in Council proceeds on the basis of applying Indian law. The points are the following. They arise on Article u7 of the new draft Order, a general provision making Indian law and procedure applicable in the Consular Courts in Abyssinia. The points are as follows: (i) Under this ^article the Indian Limitation ^ct (inter alia) applies, and it applies not only in the Consular Courts, but also in the tiixed Court (a Consul and/ Sir Herbert iearson.- 2 - and an Abyssinian JudgeJ which decides mixed cases between British subjects and Abyssinians. It becomes applicable in the latter Court because the latter Court has to ap±,ly the law of the defendant. rut aiortly, the point is that where the Abyssinian is defendant the claim cannot be aismissed on the ground of lapse of time because Abyssinian law has no Limitation Act, whereas in the converse cases, where ^byssinians are plaintiffs, cases are frequently or should be frequently if the law were properly applied dismissed on this ground. foreign Legal adviser to the ^byssinian Grovernment has represented that the position is unfair and that the Indian periods of limitation are too short for use in Abyssinia. I attach a co&gt;y of a note of this Legal Adviser and you 'will see what he said. The Legation, and I too, thinks that that he does make a case for some amendment of the present position and that we think that a provision should be inserted in the Order in Council lengthening the Indian periods of limitation for use in Abyssinia. i 1 he question therefore arises of drafting a suitable text. I think that the provision could suitably be inserted as a secondy(g&gt; -3- second proviso to Article 68, and the sort of thing which 1 have in mind is something on the following lines: M fhe provisions of the Indian Limitation xict (here we mast insert the reference to the number and date of the .act) in their application to Ethiopia shall apply, subject to the following amendments: ^(i) In Sections 57, 59 and 60, the periods of three years shall be deemed to be ten years; (ii J In Section 63 the period of three years shall be deemad to be six years.' But 1 cannot really draft the text, as I am not familiar with the Indian Limitation ^ct, and indeed without a reference to it-f' I cannot even easily find the text of it in my books. Gould you or one of your colleagues help me in suggesting a text? (ii) i’he second point is as follows. The Legation propose the insertion of a provision (the suitable place for which would, I think, be a second paragraph of article 67) on the following lines: 'In all matters which by the law of British India fall within the competence of the iresidency Small G ausCause Courts, the Court may, subject to the provisions of this Order, and so far as circumstances admit, adopt the procedure laid down for tcose Courts. i ,1 or the purposes of this paragraph the Court of the Consul General shall possess the functions of a high Court of Justice and the Consul those of the local Government.^ The Legation suggest that the insertion of such a paragraph would have the great advantage of doing away with the obligation which at present exists in every civil case, however insignificant, of writing out an elaborate judgment containing, as laid down in Order 20, Lule 4 (2), of the Coae of Civil Procedure, a concise statement of the case, the points for deter mination, the decisions thereon and the reasons for the decisions, and it would leave the Court with the obligation only as laid down in Order 20, jdule 4 (1), of recording in the judgment simply the points for determination and the decision thereon in cases where the amount or value of the subject matter does net exceed 2,000 rupees, i.e. in nine cases out of ten; this would be a considerable saving of time and labour. Such a paragraph would also in virtue of Section 14 of the/the Presidency Small Cause Courts xict of 1882 provide for the hearing by the registrar of the C ourt, acting as Judge, of cases under 2o rupees in value, although by the proviso in Section 34 of this ^ct the C onsul would always be free to hear any such case himself. Here again the principle involved in this proposal seems to me to be a sound one, but I do not feel com petent to draft an appropriate text. Would you be so good as to assist me in suggesting a text? Incidentally the text of the article of the provision in the Order should refer to the Presidency Small Cause Courts ^ct, giving its date and number. (iii) The third point is the following. This, however, is not so much a point of Indian law, but nevertheless I should be grateful for any observations you have to make upon it. The proposal is to add a third new paragraph to article 6V and on the following lines: 'In any suit where the amount or value of the subject matter in dispute does not exceed in value £10, the Sonsul may, subject to any directions of the Consul General, invest with powers for the trial of any specific/specific case, or of all such cases or any class of such cases^ arising between parties resident within an area to be defined by the G onsul^and for such period as he thinks fit^ Ckny person or body of persons of good standing in the local British conimanity and any decision or judgment given by such persons or body of persons accordingly shall be deemed to be a decision or judgment of the Court. H (iv) any appeal from a judgment or a aecision given by a person or body of persons invested with powers under be the preceding paragraph shall/_fej application to the Consular Court for a re-hearing before the C onsular Court; the decision of the Court on such application and upon the re-hearing, if any, shall be final and not subject to any further appeal.' The explanations of this proposal is that Abyssinia is a big country with -difficult communications and the number of British C onsular Officers holding Courts is very few. To meet this situation it has been the practice in the past, though there has been no authority for it, to set up little local courts of two or three supposedly respectable persons, generally Indians, to decide/. 1 -7- deoide these very small causes, and the practice is thought by the Legation to be a good one, and it is now desired to put in upon a regular footing. Yours sincerely,r / ^/ 2 r ^ U) X^PIAI^ LlHI^A-gXQN ACT , (a) The correct short title ia the Indiaa Limitation Act. 1908.

(ii) In Article 63 the period of limitation provided in the second column shall be six years instead of three years.2 Ui) SMiMi CAUSS CQUHTS PRBSIDBIiCY SM/'tLL CAUSE OjURTS ACT iMa .Uc^Jcy.oi!. 1882 ). I oan well understand that the more □umory prooedure under the Presidenoy Small Cause Courts Act is desirable and appropriate in the class of case indicated. You refer in particular to the more summary character of the recording of judgment in such caseo under Order 20 r 4 (1) of the Civ’ll Prooedure Code, But as a matter of fact oven that is not necessary in the Presidency Small Cause Courts, If you look at the Civil Prooedure Code, Section 8, you will see the limited application of its sections to Presidency Sraall Cause Courts, and Order 51 similarly limits the application of the other Rules and Orders and does not make applicable the Order 20 rule 4 (1) to which you refer. In my own experience the judge is not bound to do more than say 'dismissed with costs” or 'decreed for so much with costs”, though as a matter of practice in anything but the petty suits he does write a short judgment embodying his reasons. Under Section 9 of the Presidency Small Cause Courts Act the High Court is given power to make rules (1) prescribing the procedure to be followed and the practice to be observed by the Small Cause Court and (2) empowering the RegistrarRegistrar to hear and dispose of undefended suite and interlocutory applications or matters• It ie under this rule making power that the High Courts have acted and have extended to the Small Cause Court, as rules under Section 9, most of the other provisions of the Civil Procedure Code, including those relating to execution of decrees (Order XXX), but generally in an abbreviated form more consonant with the summary character of the procedure, I have no copy here of any of such High Court rules, but I do not think that Order 20 rule 4 (1) is one of them, Phere is, of course, under Section 14 of the Presidency Small Cause Courts Act the provision to which you refer, that the Local Government may invest the Registrar with the powers of a judge under the act for the trial of suits in which the amount or value of the subject matter does not exceed Rs.20/. I may add that the jurisdiction of the High Court and the Presidency Small Cause Court is concurrent for suits between Rs.1000/ and Rs,2000/ in value. That is, the plaintiff may select his forum and if he selects the Small Cause Court the defendant has certain rights of transfer of the suit to the High Court, subject to certain restrictions as to furnishing security for costs. Upon the whole I think your suggested draft meets the case, which leaves it to the Consul4 (iii) Consul General to exereise the High Court's rule making powers, and to the Consul those of the Local Government* Perhaps you might insert 'and practice 1 after 'adopt the procedure. (1) A provision of this nature would be in addition to the adoption of the Small Cause Court procedure. Perhaps it should be prefaced by 'notwithstanding the provisions of Art.67{2) r '. (2) Should you say £10 or keep it in rupee currency? (3) 'Shall be deemed to be a decision or judgment of the Court.' Is it naoeaaiiry to say what Court? Should it be said expressly 'and shall be capable of execution as such'.In any further communication on this subject, please quote *No. J 914/600/1 and address— not to any person by name, but to— “ The Under-Secretary of State.” Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. /-V Sir, 2294 I r(\ i* 1 (L Foreign Office.

Article 20(l) . The typing error, to which attention is called, has been corrected. Article 26 . The proposal to omit this Article was based on the argument that it would be much simpler for His Majesty’s Consular Courts in Abyssinia to apply one systeja of law rather than two, and it was held that this consideration outweighed all considerations as to the comparative merits of the provisions of English and Indian law on the protection of copyright, patents and Trade Marks. Article 26 will, therefore, be omitted, but it is proposed on grounds of practical expediency to defer the re-numbering of the Articles rendered necessary by this omission until the final agreed draft is prepared. Article 31 (2) . It is proposed to omit the words: ’’and any Consular Court shall have power to impose the 'punishments aforesaid”, the insertion of which was due to an oversight.

Sir, ^ With reference to your letters Jtfos* P.Z•4372/31 and P.Z*7106/31, dated the 30th July and 19th liovember 19 31, respectively, on the subject of the draft Ethiopian Order in Council, I am directed to state tnat the Government of India are in general agreement with the draft and have no comments to make as regards the articles mentioned in para graph 2 of the Foreign Office letter ho. J.2132/810/1, dated the 8th July 1931, except those indicated below:- Article 26. Tne decision on the suggestion made in the Memorandum to omit this article would appear to depend upon xx //nether the authorities administering the Order in Council will, in practice, find it less irksome to familiarise themselves witn the relevant penal provisions of the Indian law, than with the penal provisions of the English Statutes specifically imported by Article 26. If the relevant penal provisions are considered to be more easily accessible in the Indian Law-( sections 478-489, Indian Penal Code, sections 7-9 of enciosuae in A EOfiEIGN SECRFTAHrs No M rated 4; FEB. 1952 Received 2? FFD ^@3 of the Irxiian Copyngnt Act ,1914, and section 78 of the Indian Patents and Designs Act, 1911, would appear to cover the whole ground)- the suggestion is one which in the opinion of the Croverniuent of India might well be adopted, arti cle 39 . The Government of India suggest that a possible source of ambiguity would be removed if, instead of describing the offences in view under their brief Indian title* the clause were expressed in terms of offences punishable under named sections of the Indian Penal Code. In this connection it will be observed that the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code provide one and tne same penalty for lurking house trespass and house breaking. The draft clause which specifies house breaking but not lurking house trespass cannot presumably nave oeen intended to exclude the case in which an offence punishable under the applicable section of the Indian Penal Code, answers to the description of lurking house trespass and not of house breaking. It seems probable also that in specifying ’‘forgery 11 it was intended to include most, if not all, of the offences punishable under sections 465-477A, Indian Penal Code, several of which offences could not properly be held to be included in the title of 'forgery' 1 . 2. In Article 2Q( i) the phrase 'jury and assessors' should apparently read 'jury or assessors', v ide article 39. 3. With reference to paragraph 4 of Foreign Office letter jBb. J.3192/810/1, dateu tne 13th November i93i, I am to state that none of the Indian Statutes referred to in the draft Order in Council has been repealed.

With reference to India Office letter No.p.2. 6671/31 of November 5th, regarding the proposed draft of the Ethiopian Order in Council, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to convey his thanks to the Secretary of State for India for his assistance and to state that the addition to the draft suggested in paragraph 3 of that letter has been made• 2. With regard to paragraph 4, I am to explain that the words used in Article 72 are ’’persons subject to this Order”, fhe meaning of this expression is to be found in Article 5. It includes, firstly, British subjects, an expression which, as the India Office observe, includes any corporation incorporated under the law of any part of His Llajesty’s Dominions, protectorates or mandated territories, and, secondly, ’’foreigners with respect to whom when within the ’limits of this Order any State whose subjects or ’’under whose protection they are, has by treaty or otherwise ’’agreed with His Majesty for, or consents to, the exercise ”of power or authority by His Majesty to the extent of such ’’agreement or consent”. There are included, under this second class in Article 5, persons, such as Swedish and Danish subjects over whom, at the request of their respective Governments, His Majesty’s Government exercise territorial jurisdiction in Abyssinia, and therefore The Under Secretary of State, India Office. a±&gt;iym 'n presumably the expression 'persons subject to this 'Order' in Article 72 might include Swedish or Danish companies carrying on business in Abyssinia, The inclusion in this class of Sv/edish or Danish companies is, however, likely to be more a theoretical than a practical matter. It is not desired to extend the jurisdiction to wind up insolvent companies, so as to include companies other than those which come under the heading of 'persons subject to 'this Order'. ' 5 * In accordance with the suggestion in paragraph 5 of the leuL/er under reference an addition has been made to Article 4 of the draft Order in Council, which now reads as follows 'Where this Order refers to any specified Act or Acts of 'Parliament or any Actfr or Statute in force in British India , 'nch reference shall, unless a contrary intention appears, 'be deemed to include any Act or Acts amending or 'substituted for the same'. 4 # ,,7ith re S arc i to the penultimate paragraph of the India Office letter, I am to state that Sir John Simon would: be grateful if, as and when the Order in Council is being further examined by your Department, any references to Indian statutes which have since been repealed and replaced might be corrected and the more recent statutes inserted.

If we are concerned only with such Companies it would seem to be sufficient to add to Art 72 the following words 'and all such jurisdiction in the matter of winding up insolvent Companies as for the time being belongs to a Court exercising jurisdiction under the Indian Companies Act (Act VII of 1910) If we have to provide also for foreign Companies it will be necessary to amend the definition of 'foreigner' or make some further alteration in Art 72 I may mention that under the Indian Companies Act 1913 there is jurisdiction to wind up foreign Companies as Unregistered Companies^as under Part X of the Companies Act 1928 (19 &amp; 20 Geo V c.23) Kith reference to the citation of Indian Acts in Art 72 and other articles I may point out that Art 4 does not apply to Indian Acts. 1 suggest that this Article should be amended as most of the Indian Acts mentioned in the draft Order have beea an ended from time to time.Draft^ In any fuftner communication ou this subject, please quote iNDsJCEP ftner communication No. J 2598/810/1. and address— not to any person by name, but to— Foreign Office. “ The Under-Secretary of State,” S.W.l Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. 16th October, 1931 Sir With reference to Foreign Office letter No.J 2132/810/1 of July 8th last, I am directed by the Marquess of Read hag to transmit to you herewith, to be laid before the Secretary of State for India an extract from a letter from the Board of Trade regarding the proposed draft of the revised Ethiopia Order in Council. 2. Lord Reading is advised that the Consular Courts in Abyssinia should be given express jurisdiction with regard to insolvent companies. This would seem to entail the amendment of, or the addition of some further provision to. Article 72 of the draft enclosed in the letter under reference. But in view of the fact that any such emendation must involve a reference to the legislation of British India, the drafting presents some difficulties to the Legal Advisers of this department and I am therefore to suggest that the Legal Advisers to the India Office might be so good as to suggest a draft of the necessary additional provision for the Order in Council.

This Article is doubtless intended to a PPly only to individuals and possibly the Indian Act referred to in paragraph (1) of the Article cannot apply to companies. But at the same time, as the second Legal Adviser to your Department explains, the word 'person' includes a company, and Article 72 (2) by itself seems applicable to companies.

Art icle 2. I think it is better on this point to follow the original draft. Article 5 . I have adopted the scheme followed in the Egypt Order in Council of providing that the Interpretation Act 1389 applies to the interpretation of the present Order, a course which renders it possible to omit a good many of the definitions of the old Article 3. Copies of the Interpretation Act, of course, must be made available in the Courts in Ethiopia. There are a number of purely drafting amendments in the definitions in Article 3, but I think that they are self-explanatory. I wish however to call ^articular attention to the definitions of British protected persons (paragraph (c) (ii)) and British suDjects (paragraph (c) (iii)) and i?oreigaers (paragraph (c) (x))* The Interpretation Act makes the word u person include corporation unless there is anything in the content repugnant thereto. It is clear, however, that the majority of places where, in the Order, the words 'British subject” are used or the words 'persons subject to this Order' (see Article 5 (i)) corporations are intended to be included: hence the addition in the definition of British subject. Where a company is not• included under these expressions it will be because the subject matter shows this is not so, see the heading of Article 3. (I have omitted from Article 3 Mr. Mackareth s definitionsdefinitions of Consular districts, as it does not seem to 'be required in the Orders i-is definition of the Consular Court and the Court of the Consul-General, because I have dealt with them in my new Article 8 , see below; and his definition of Ethiopia, as I have kept the old Article 2)• Paragraphs (l)-( 6 ) of Article 4 disappear as a result of the application of the pfscrpretation /ct* My Article 4 corresponds to paragraph ( 6 ) of the old Article 4« Article 5 (l) &gt; The arrangement of the sub paragraphs follows the scheme of tl.e Egypt Order in Council* It will oe seen that under the draft two classes of person have to bo considered (a) British subjects, an expression which includes protected persons, and (b) foreigners, who, under arrangements are made subject to British exterritorial jurisdiction in Ethiopia* These two classes are grouped under the expression 'persons subject to this Order'* Attention must be paid in each case as to whether it is appropriate in the particular case to confine the Article to British subjects or to make it apply to all persons subject to the Order* As regards (iv) please see my observations on Article 113* I have here introduced two new sub paragraphs under the numbers (v) and (vi)* The object of (v) is to provide for the possibility of service out of the jurisdiction* I shall refer to this again hereafter, see Article 102 (l) (i)* The text is taken from the Egypt Order* (vi) is also taken from the Egypt Order* It seems necessary to provide for the jurisdiction of the court in respect of British aircraft* A copy of the Air Navigation Act 1920 must be supplied to all the courts in Ethiopia* (Old Article 7 I have omitted on the grounds (a) that paragraph (iv) coupled with Part VI says all that is necessary and (b) I am not suro if it is accurate*) Article 6Article 6 (2), (3)j.. and (4), is based opon Article 13 of the Morocco Order and Article 29 of the Egypt Order* Article 7* An addition is made which is self explanatory and is f X think, useful* (Article 6 of Mr* Mackareth*s draft is out of place* It will he found later in Part 111 of the Order, see Article 25)* Part II* I have adopted Mr* Machareth*s schene of referring to the Court of the Consul-General and to Consular Courts instead of 'provincial courts'* I have inserted a new Article 8 which formally establishes His Britannic Majesty’s Court in Ethiopia, and then defines that this Court is constituted of the Court of the Consul-General and Consular courts* Article 9 * My new proviso to Article 9 takes the place of old Article 15* There is no change of substance but only one of drafting and arrangement * Old Article 15 was^ to my mind, defective in not making it clear whether the jurisdiction exercised under it was the jurisdiction of the Court of the Consul-General or of the Consular Courts* Arti cle 10* I have cut out as unnecessary the provision for the sale of orinted copies of orders of the Consul-General as to the places where consular Courts are to be held* Article 11 (2&gt;« I have adopted Mr* Mackareth’e suggestion that the Consular Courts should also have seals* I imagine the expense of preparing these seals will be negligible* Arti cle 12 is new but its meaning and object need no comment* Ar ticle .15 * Some amendments are made but I think they are only natters of drafting* (Article 15(Article 16 of the existing Orderi see Article 9 gdo\o).

Besides some drafting amendments, power is given in my draft to tne of the Consul-General to order a case to he sent up to that Court on its own motion as well as on the application party. _ _ Article 18 (2) of my draft tahes the place of Article of the existing Order.

I have made a new Article 19 which is taken in substance from the Morocco Order giving a facultative power to appoint registrars, marshals and bailiffs, etc, of the Court.

Sir So Barton articlee ,'T»th .»i m SO to 28 correspond with Articles 2o-2b o. +ne „ , j.„ ve eiichtly recast the form and order of existing Order. I nave siiE-iw these articles.

Article 2 6 (corresponding with Article 60 of the original Order) makes applicable In Ethiopia certain United Kingdom statutessecetc v etatutes relating to copyright 9 patents. Merchandise marks, Mr* Gardiner has suggested that this article should he omitted on the ground that it is preferable that as Indian lav applies generally under this Order (see Articles 23 and 24) this matter should he left to he governed hy Indian law* I am disposed to agree* The assistance of the India Office on this point is particularly desired© The substance of the second proviso of Article 60 of the existing Order is in Article 114 of this draft* Article 27 (l) corresponds to old Article 61© The second paragraph is new hut appears to he required* Article 28 corresponds to Article 62 of the old Order, Mr© Maclean suggests the omission of this article on the ground that these offences would he dealt with hy the Mixed Court* Sven if this is so, the Mixed Court must apply the lav; of the defendant and this article is, in the case of British subjects, the law of the defendant which the Mixed Court must apply* Old Article 63 in the existing Order in Council deals with dangerous drugs© It is, I think, inadequate for the present day and I do not think that the Legation's draft, which extends the whole article, is quite sufficient© I think that it would he best if all the dangerous drug provisions were dealt with hy King* a Regulations under the Article which corresponds to Article 125, and therefore have simply ~mitted Article 63* Sir Mu Delevingne of the Home Office and Sir S* Barton concur in this course © I also omitted Article 65 of the old Order, although provisions along these lines are found also in the Egypt Order- It seems to me, however, that this also is a matter which should he dealt with hy King s RegulationsRegulations under Article 126. In other words, if and when there are any treaties, the provisions of which must he made 'binding subject to penalty upon British subjects, etc*, the proper thing is to maKo a special King’s Regulation under Article 126* The same observations apply to Article 66 of the existing Order which I have omitted for the same reason* These matters could be dealt with by King’s Regulations under Article 126c Article 29 corresponds to Article 64 of the old Order* Article 50 corresponds to Article 67 of the existing Order* 1 have made some drafting amendments based on the corresponding provisions in the Egypt Order- (with regard to paragraph 2 of this article, I think that it is unnecessary that copies of the minutes should be sent to the Secretary cf State, but it seems desirable that copies of the minutes in Consular Courts should be sent to the Consul-General *) Article 31 corresponds to Article 68 of the existing Order* I have omitted the special penalty* Article 52 corresponds to Article 69 of the existing Order* (Article 70 of the existing Order in Council is covered by Article 62 of my draft which corresponds to Article 75 of the old Order in Council* It is only a duplication to repeat it here)« Articles 71 and 72 of the old Order in Council* These should be considered in connexion with Part VI, (see Articles 116 and 117)* I have inserted here an Article 31, based on Article 116 of the existing Order* This is a criminal matter and should be dealt with here, not in Part V* The fifth paragraph is nob new but it seems desirable that every case where an officer of the Court is involved should be referred$to the Court of tho Consul-General for directionsc Article 54 of my draft corresponds with Article 3o of the existing Order® I have introduced a new sub-heading® Article 35 corresponds with Article 33 of the existing Order. (Article 35 of the old Order* This article seems to be out of place and 1 think it should come in Part VI^ (see % Articles 110 and 121))® Article 55 corresponds vith Article 34 of the existing Order* Articles 57 and 58 of my draft correspond with Articles 36 of the existing Order and 36 of Mr® Mackareth’s draft. 1 have thought it best first of all to distinguish between two classes of offences against the order, ic-e®, grave offences and ordinary offences .(The same distinction is made inter alia in the Egypt Order). Then, to provide that so far as the operation of other articles are concerned, a grave offence against the Order shall be treated in the same manner as a cognisable offence, to be made one of the cases where the granting of bail by the Court is made entirely a matter of discretion)» Subject to these points I thinii my draft follows Hr. MackGreth*s draft. I have introduced a new sub-heading, Criminal ^xXeijcc ^i Mode of Trial , and reversed the order of the articles. Article 39 (l) (my draft) introduces a jury for capital offences® It corresponds to Articles 38 and 39 and 41 of the old Order, and to Articles 38 and 39 of Mr. Mackaretn s draft Article 39 ( 2 ) requires a good deal of consideration. The first point to decide was whether generally speaking to followfollow the lines of Hr* Hac3sa.r8th* s draft or those of t xo draft submitted by Mr. Gardiner, to which Mr. Mackareth refers in paragraph 21 of his memorandum. On this point I came to the conclusion that it was better to follow the general lines of Mr. Mackareth’s draft, largely for the reasons which he gives. I have added to the list of offences mentioned in Mr. Maokareth’s draft, the trial of which should be on a charge (i.e e , other than summary) and with assessors unless the accused consents to trial without assessors*' X hope and think that I have used terms to describe these offences which are recognised under the Indian Criminal Code. Mr. 11 ac roth 1 g draft in substance practically provided that a trial should be either summary or if not summary should always be with assessors, but I think one wants to provide more clearly for trial on a charge, (i*e«, not summarywith asse * (b) on a charge without assessors} (c) summarily without assessors; (d) in special cases, summarily with assessorsc. Subject to these points I do not think there are ma?iy differences in substance, though there are certain differences in drafting between my draft and Mr. Mackareth's draft* It must be remembered that all the provisions of the Order requiring assessors are subject to the provisions ... Article 20, paragraph 2, rendering it possible for 'die coar to sit without assessors if it is physically or virtually impossible to obtain them. Paragraph 2 of Article 40 of the old Order (Article 08 (2) of Mr. Mackareth* s draft) I have simply omitted, because the original jurisdiction of the Consul-General in all cases is already provided for in Article 14, and there doer, noo appear to me to be any reason why there should be any difference inin principle “between the cases where the Court of the Consul- General should sit with assessors and the principles which should apply when a Consular Court is trying a similar offence® Naturally, however, in the case of a Consular Court, in practice the article allowing assessors to he dispensed with in cases where it is virtually or physically imoossihle to obtain them would he more likely to operate® I have reserved in my draft all statements as to the powers of the Court tc inflict punishment when trying a case summarily (in Article 41 of the existing Order) tc the part of the Order which deals with punishment® It seems to me tc he clearer and more logical to place them there, (see Article 44 (4))® Article 40 of my draft corresponds to Article 40 of the existing Order, with an amendment changing the words 'and the accused is not to he sent for trial' etc®, to 'or that the accused should he sent for trial' etc® The Consul-General’s decision to send a man for trial outside the limits of the Order can only he given after the preliminary examination in the Consular Court (see Mr® Maclean’s observations, page 4 of his memorandum)® Article 41 (my draft) corresponds to Article 37 of the old Order® Mr® Mackareth’s draft proposes to add Berhera as one of the places to which persons committing crimes in Ethiopia may he sent for trial® This is a new proposal and requires some consideration® It had been already decided to amend Article 52 of the old Order so as to include Berhera as one of the places to which persons might he sent from Ethiopia to serve their sentences® No suggestion, however, had hitherto been made that Berhera should he included amongst the places to which persons might he sentfor trial* Go far as statutory power is concerned, I thini: that this can be done under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act* Although it may be that Berbera is not a British possession within the meaning of Section 6 of that Act, the Coiirts at Berbera are, I think, certainly courts held under the authority of His Majesty within the meaning of Section 9 of that Acto ~h»lm a facie it seems to me to be reasonable that Berbera should be included in this Article, but it cannot be done Y/ithout the consent of the Colonial Office who will probably only give their consent on some understanding as to the classes of cases which are likely to be sent to Berbera for trial* We must be particularly careful, when sending the Order to the Colonial Office for concurrence, to call their attention to this point. My other amendments to old Article 37 are drafting amendments only* But it is made clear that the preliminary examination should be completed before an order is made under this article, as Mr. Maclean suggested. It appears that in 1920 a murder case, in which the accused and victim were Somalis, was sent for trial at Berbera, though there was no authority to do this under the Order in Council, (see LalOSG of 192o) My Article 42 (42 of the old Order). Mr. Mackareth had omitted from his draft paragraph (b) on the ground that it was unnatural and inconsistent for a Court to hold preliminary examination in a case which it itself was going to try* 1 find that this paragraph is retained in the corresponding articles of the recent Orders in Council, such as the Egypt Order, and I have thought it better to retain it* While where circumstances permit it is no doubt desirable tnat cue preliminary examination should be conducted by a different judge to the judge who conducts the trial, the practical exigenciesexigencies of tlie situation may not permit this to he done* and there is not, I think, anything fundamentally wrong in the same judge conducting hoth stages of procedure® I have added some words to paragraph 2 of Article 42 which are found In, the corresponding provision of the Egypt order, and I think are self explanatory. Articles45 to 49 of the old Order in Council® I noticed, in studying Hr. ^iaeka^eth , s draft, that he had omitted about half of these articles. On looking at the Indian Code of Procedure I found that all these matters were dealt with there in a similar manner and I think, therefore, that the omission was intentionalc Further researches re v 3 aled that the whole of these articles also covered matters which were dealt with quite clearly in the Indian Code, and in consequence I have omitted them all from the Order in Council on the ground that it is confusing to have two relevant instruments defining the same matter. I assume that all Consular Courts will nave in their nossession copies of the Indian Code. Mr. Lardnxe was also of the opinion that these articles shoald be omitted. Articles 44 to 46 of my draft correspond with Articles 50 to 64 of the Old Order, and Articles 45 to 49 of Mr. Mackareth’s draft. Articles44 t.nd 45 of my draft differ in form considerably from Article 50 of the original Order which they replace, but I do not think that any cnanges ol substance are made, except as regards the death sentence, where my draft follows the amending Order previously dram up at the Foreign Office, (Article 52 of the old Order disappears) and I have added a paragraph dealing with the powers of punishment in respect of offences tried sumia^i , whi chwhich taiies the place of* /rticle 41 of* the old Order, aiid increased the period of* imprisonment, which may he inflicted after a summary trial in view of the lightness with which this form of punishment is regarded by Somalis* The question of the continuance of the death sentences in the Court of the Consul-General was submitted to the Secretary of State in view of Sir S. Barton 1 s representations that the previous decision should be reversed* Sir S« Barton desired that the death penalty should be retained for murder in the Court in Ethiopia, although it had been taken away from the Court in Egypt which has a professional judge and a professional bar to assist it* He also desired that the Court in Ethiopia should be empowered to execute death sentences passed by the Mixed Court on British subjects* Indeed tne two are bound together, because the Hixed Court applies t^e law of the defendant, and if the Order in Council sanctions a death penalty, the Mixed Court is justified in passing one in like circumstances and its execution may in principle be difficult to refuse* The Secretary of State felt unable to contemplate the execution of death se -itenets passed by the ilixed Court, and considered that it should be removed from the jurisdiction of the Court of the Consul- eneral* Sir S# Barton chiefly desired to retain the enalty for the Mixed Court cases, and assuming that it as decided that death sentences passed by the mixed ourt could not be executed, I do not gather tnat he v/ouid :ave desired to retain it in his own Court, in view of the •act that it would leave him without a valid legal ground for •efusing (as he would have to refuse) to execute death sentencessentences of the i/iixed Court* Article 46 « Article 51 of the existing Order* The substantial change here is the introduction of different punishments for the two classes of offences against the Order, ioe* 5 grave offerees and ordinary offences, and the increase of penalties for grave offences* Article 47 (53 old Order), paragraph 2, contains a provision borrowed from the Egypt Order empowering the Court to demand security if it coiisiders that the complaint may be malicious, frivolous or vexatious, and also to order the payment of damages as well as expenses in respect of criminal proceedings brought frivolously or vexatiously* Article 48 (54) is borrowed from the Egypt Order, and is a more comprehensive provision than the existing article&lt;■ Arti cles 49 to 51 in my draft deal with appeals from a Consular Court to the Court of the Consul-Ceneral, and Article 52 with appeals from the court of the Consul-General to the Court of Appeal for Eastern ; frica* I think that logically the provisions with regard to appeals ought to come before those relating to the suspension and remission of punishments and those with regard to the service cf sentences and the removal of prisoners and fugitive offenders* Articles 49 to 51 in my draft correspond with Article G9 of Mr* Mackareth’s draft, and Articles 74 and 75 of the existing Order in Council* Mr* Mackareth’s draft also contains, in his Articles 104 and 105, provisions relating to the reserving of cases on points of law for the decision of the Court of the Consul-General or of the Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa as the case may be to take the place of some of the provisions in Articl® 74 and 75 of the old Order* Mr* Mackarett^s draft differs from the existing Order in (1) separatingseparating the provisions relating to the reservation for the decision of a higher court of a point of law from the provisions relating to appeals; (8) introducing this procedure for civil matters also, whereas under the existing Order this is confined to criminal matters; and (3) introducing the procedure also as 'between the Court of the Consul-General and the Court of ..ppeal for Eastern ..frica# While I think that Hr# Mackareth’s draft was an improvement, on the existing Order, after a good deal of thou£$it I have come to the conclusion that it is 'better to eliminate altogethex- from the Order in Council the procedure for reserving cases from the decision of a higher court on a point oi lav/o My reasons for coming to this conclusion are tne following: the procedure of reserving a case for the decision of a higher court on a point of law which involves the stating of a case upon which the higher court has to give its decision is an extremely complicated one, and in my opinion, Qui^e unsuited to the conditions in Ethiopia so far as the Consular Courts are concerned# Further, it must he remembered that under the Order in Council there is the greatest elasticity as regards the Question whether a case should ho tried by a Consular Court or by the Court of the Consul- General# I would refer in this connexion to the provisions which are found in Articles 13, 14, 15 and 16 of my draft, which make it possible, where cases arise which involve a difficult Question of law which is better decided in the Court of the Consul-General, the trial of the whole case to be reserved to the Court of the Consul-General# Further, in Article 50 of my draft, dealing with appeals, 1 have made it possible for a complainant to appeal in a criminal matter if the Court of the Consul-General gives leave. Consequently, if inin a criminal caso a difficult point of law is involved, and the Conaular Court, though doubtful as to the legal position, has come to the conclusion that the better view is that the accused should he acquitted, the Consular Court will he able, hy giving leave to the complainant to appeal, to provide an opportunity for the Court of the Cons\il-General to decide the matter* It seems to me that all these provisions sufficiently provide for all the cases which are lihely to arise in Sthiopia, and in a manner which is better suited to the conditions than the complicated procedure of cases stated. I do not thinli, moreover, that the procedure of stating a case is suitable as between the Court of the Consul- General and the Court of Appeal for iSastern Africa. Owing to the essential complexity of the procedure, which is very likely to result in very great delays owing to the great difficulty which often arises in stating a caso properly for the decision of a Court of Appeal, it very often happens that if the case has not been accurately stated the decision of the Court of Appeal upon the case stated does not produce the results which were desired, and I think it is better to confine recourse to the Court of Appeal to appeals only. In Articles 49 to 51 in my draft I have made certain changes of substance from Mr. Mackareth*s draft and the existing Order. An appeal against an order of Deportation is allowed. This is additional to the existing provisions which render all orders of deportation made by a Consular Court subject to the confirmation of the Consul-General. Under the existing procedure, however, the confirmation of the or^ar by the Consul-General seems to a reference to him in his administrative rather than in his judicial capacity. It doesdoes not provide any moans t&gt;y v/hich the person ordered to he ^ deported may present his case against the order of deportation* As an order of deportation in some cases will he a somewhat heavy punishment, I have thought it better to allow the possibility of the person to he deported being able to appeal against the order, so that the matter should, if he deal res to appeal, be adjudicated upon by the Court of the Consul- General judicially&lt;* Of course, if no appeal against an order of deportation is entered, the order of deportation is still subject to the confirmation of the Consul-General under Article 65 (4) of my drafto Mr* Mackareth 1 q draft excludes all appeals from a Consular Court trying a case summarily* I am inclined to think, however, that this goes too far, and my draft allows appeals in all cases where the offence of which the accused was tried was one in respect of which a punishment exceeding one month’s imrpisonment could have been awarded* I think that this is the way which the limit should be drawn, but if it is thought that it has been put too low,, the limit could be raised* Another innovation in my draft is to provide that no appeal shall lie against a decision on a question of fact in a case tried by Assessors, unless the Assessors have dissented from this decision on the question of fact* In my draft, I have given the court of the Consul-General discretionary power to sit with Assessors when hearing appeals if the Court thinks it desirable* This is facultative only* Article 52 of my draft deals with appeals to the Court of Appeal in criminal matters* I have introduced an amendment into paragraph 8 of this article in the light of the observationsobservations made by the judges of the Court of Appeal which are to be found in a letter from Chief Justice Sir ?&lt;&gt;W»Ba.rth 9 of the 1st March, 1930, to the Colonial Secretary, Nairobi, of which a copy is to be found in J*S072* I will begin, however, by quoting the substance of this letter, which is as follows 2 - 'I have now consulted the judges of the Court of 'Appeal with tho exception of the Judge of the High Court 'of Nyasaland, and their unanimous opinion with which I 'concur is:~ '(l) That there is no objection to receiving and * hearing appeals from the Consular Courts of Abyssinia* , t '(2) That the procedure in connection with the ^admission and disposal of such appeals should be laid down by the Court of Appeal Rules. '(3) That the Abyssinian Order in Council should not contain any provision relating to the procedure of the 'Court of Appeal in connection with'the admission, hearing |t or disposal of such appealso As I said in my letter to f| Mr ^ Bcttomley of 5th July last the method ultimately f adopted is one for decision by the authorities at home, u but undoubtedly confusion is apt to arise from having different procedure rules applying to different terri- toriee from which appeals to the Court of Appeal lie, ( |The question at once presents itself whether matters on tj which the draft Order in Council is silent are to be ^regulated by the Court of Appeal .Rules. One of the most 'important of such matters is that of fees. Is the scale 'laid down by the Court of Appeal Rules to prevail or are tj no fees to be charged? This example could be multiplied. ^Another disadvantage of including rules of procedure in ^en Order 5.n Council is the difficulty which arises when Jit is desired to amenithem. If Rules are left to the 'Court, amendments can be easily made 7/hen required* 'In my view all steps to be taken after final leave to appeal has been given should be regulated by the 'Rules of the Court of Appeal'. The substance of these comments is, I think, summed up in the last paragraph of the extract of the letter which is set out above, and I will now consider the provisions of Article 52 of my draft in conjunction with these observations* I think it is clear that there is nothing in paragraphs 1, 2 9 3, or 4 of Article 52 which is in any way inconsistent with the views of the judges, since all these paragraphs deal with matters prior to the moment when final leave to appeal has been given* With regard, however, to the provision in paragraph 4, that a petitionpetition for leave to appeal to the Court of Apx^eal shall he presented within such time and in such form as is prescribed hy the Rules of Court made under the Sthiopia Order, I should call attention to two points: (a) that all Rules of Court made under the Ethiopia Order which have any relation to appeals to the Court of Appeal are to he submitted for approval, before they are made, to the Court of Appeal itself« See Article 102 (3) Proviso. Consequently, the Court of Appeal will have every opportunity of ensuring that all rules dealing with these matters are such as the Court of Appeal itself approves of; and (b) to the situation in Ethiopia itself* The judges of the Court of Appeal will, I think, readily recognise the conditions under which judicial work has to be done in Ethiopia and in the Court of the Consul-General* Our Court there is a non-profesoional court, containing no lawyers as judges, and has available only a very limited number of lawyers, including only one English lawyer, to assist it as Counsel® In the circumstances it is most desirable that everything which has to be done in Ethiopia either by the parties or by the Court of the Consul-General should, as far as possible, be either in the Ethiopia Order in Council or in the Rules of Court for Ethiopia* The difficulty in Ethiopia of a multiplicity of orders or rules is a far greater one for a non-professional court, acting practically without legal assistance, than it is for the highly trained judges of the Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa with the legal assistance at their command* Paragraph 5 deals with the preparation of the record in the case of an appeal by the Court of the Consul-General and its transmission to the Court of Appeal* This is a part of the procedure which takes place subsequent to the granting o. final leave to appeal, and it would appear from the letter whichwhich I have quoted above that the judges of the Court of Appeal contemplated that this should he regulated by the Rules of Court of the Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa® I have looked at these Rules 5 and the relevant rule appears to be Rule 15, which makes the Deputy Registrar of the Court of Appeal responsible for the preparation of the record* I think, however, that upon reflection it will be clear that this arrangement, however, suitable in the case of appeals from the three contiguous territories which come within the ordinary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, is hardly possible in the case of appeals coming from Ethiopia, and that the procedvire laid down in paragraph 5 of this draft is more suited to the circumstances of these appeals* The provisions of this paragraph are based upon the provisions of the existing Abyssinian Order and of other Orders in Council in relation to appeals to the Privy Council, which has never objected to matters of this kind being regulated by the Order in Council for the exterritorial courts from which the appeals were brought* Paragraph 6 is, I think, not touched by any of the judges's observations* Paragraph 7 provides that the Consul-Q-eneral shall make arrangements for the prosecution to be represented before the Court of Appeal® In this connexion I would like to refer to paragraph 5 of the despatch to the Colonial office of the Governor of Kenya of the 2oth March, in which he refers to the working arrangement at present in operation in the case of appeals to the Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa under which the Crown is represented in all criminal appeals by the Law Officers of the territory in which the Court of Appeal is sitting, and suggests that this arrangement should be adopted in the case of appeals from Ethiopia* This paragraph of the articlearticle in the Order in Council would permit of* such an arrangement being made and would also allow the question of fees to the Law Officer conducting the case to be settled each time that a case arises by the Consul-General and the Law Officer concerned^ It is no doubt reasonable that the Law Officers should receive some fees for conducting the case for the prosecution of appeals from Ethiopia and I imagisie that the cost of such fees would be paid by the Consul-General* and he would take credit for such fees in his accounts with the Foreign Office,* Paragraph 8 specifically provides that in the case of appeals from Ethiopia, the Court of Appeal shall hare the same powers, and the procedure shall be governed by the same rules and the same fees shall be payable, as upon an appeal from a territory to which the East African Court of Appeal Order in Council, 1921, extends, thus giving effect to v/hat I under stand to be the wishes of the fudges of the Court of Appeal, and meeting the two specific points mentioned in Sir JoWo Barth’s letter® There are, however, the five provisos, a, b, c, d, and e y to this article which lay down five specific exceptions to the general provision which has been mentioned above* These are particular provisions which are instituted by reason of special circumstances attending the question of appeals from the Court of the Consul-General in Ethiopia, and which may net apply in the case of appeals within the ordinary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal t? I do not gather that the judges see anything unreasonable in these provisions in themselves, and if it is admitted that these provisions are reasonable and desirable in themselves and have to be applied to the particular cases of appeals from Ethiopia,Ethiopia 5 they constitute matters where the appeals from Ethiopia cannot he left simply to he governed 'by the ordinary Rules of the Court of Appeal* This being so, they will have to he laid down somewhere in some special instrument, and it seems that the Ethiopia Order in Council is the niece which would he at least as convenient as any other to the Court of Appeal itself, since the Ethiopia Order in Council will he the document which the Court will obviously have before it for the purpose of hearing the appeal since the appeal must he that some judgment or sentence in Ethiopia is not that which ought to have been given in the Ethiopia Order in Council* Prom the point of view of Ethiopia it is much more convenient that these provisions should he found in the Ethiopia Order in Council® T sincerely hope, therefore, that the amended draft of this article,*in the light of the observations which I have me.de above, will commend itself to the Colonial Office, end to the judges of the Court of Appeal* I should, perhaps, say, in conclusion, that though the Ethiopia Order in Council is a Foreign Office Order, it would he contrary to all official practice for the Foreign Office to introduce amendments into it in any matter which affected the Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa without consultation with the Colonial Office, and I have no doubt that in sucn a case the Colonial Office* would see that the judges of the Court of Appeal were given an opportunity of expressing their opinion on any proposed amendments of this hind® Consequently, the mere fact that some provisions which affect the Court of Appeal in its Ethiopian jurisdiction arelat the court of Appeal would he deprived of every proper opportunity of expressing observations V7ith regard to these Provisions« would also again call a reference to Article ISO (s) tae Order in Council, which provides that all Rules ®ade by the Consul-General m any matter which affects appeals to the Court of Appeal shall be first submitted for approval to the Court of Appeal. introduced a heading, Suspension, and Remission aumaaant.. amo!.. sm* « e of 0l , Of Articles 67 and 68 of the existing Order, and also of certain other provisions which are largely based upon Articles 34 to 3G of the Morocco Order. 1 think that these provisions require no further explanation. I have then introduced another heading, entitled Execution of Sentences: Removal of Prisoners and Fugitive Offenders. Articles 65 and 66 of my draft deal with the execution of sentences, and in particular, with sentences of imprisonment in Ethiopia. These articles correspond generally to Articles 77 and 55 of the existing Order in Council, ana Articles 50 and 66 of Mr. Mackareth’s draft. The existing provisions of the order in Council are somewhat confusing. I have attempted in my draft to set out the position more clearly and yet to retain all the elasticity which is necessary for the primitive conditions of Ethiopia. I think that the meaning and intention of my diaf-D is sufficiently clear to require no further explnna- tion &lt; Article 57 of my draft corresponds to Article 56 of the existing order, and to Article 51 of Mr. Mackareth’s draftdrafta The substance of paragraphs 4 and E of Mr* Macksreth J s draft will be found contained in the section whic deals with deportation. (See Article C3 (5) of my draft) w Berbera is included as one of the places to which prisoners may be sent to serve their sentences of imprisonment« This was already proposed in the previous draft amending Order and I think that the Colonial Office have agreedo Article 58 of my draft corresponds to Article 79 of the existing Order and Article 59 of my draft to Article 78 of the existing Order* Article GO of my draft corresponds to Article 119 of the existing Order end to Article 14S of Mr* Mackareth 1 s drafto Article 61 of my draft corresponds to Article 120 of the existing Order and to Article 145 of Hr, Mackareth* s draft* I think that these Articles were out of place in the existing Order* I have then introduced another heading called Security for G-cod Behaviour, Article 62 of my draft corresponds with Article 75, paragraphs 1 and 2, of the existing Order and Article 65, paragraphs 1 and 2, of Mr* Mackareths draft* The old heading Deportation is inserted here* Article 65 of my draft corresponds to Article 75, paragraph % 4 and 5, of the existing Order, and to Article 65, paragraphs a 9 ^(3. 5, of Mr* Mackareth’s draft* I iiave also introduced in this place Mr* Mackareth’s suggestion that deportation may be o&amp;rt of the sentence of any Britism subject who is sentenced to imprisonment* I should also call attention to the fact that some slight amendments have been necessitated in paragraph 4 of my article. owing to the fact that an order for deportation has been made one in respect of which an appeal to the Court of the Consul-G-eneral may be made, and my paragraph 5 is due to the same reason* ArticleArticle G4 of my draft corresponds with paragraphs 6 P 7, 3* 9,10, and 11 of Article 7S of the existing Order, and paragraphs 6 to 11 of Mr* Mackareth’s Article 66* With reference to Article C4 (2) of my draft, I think that the existing Order and Mr* Maclcareth's draft are both wrong in pioviding for the deportation of n prisoner sentenced to a term of inrprIsonment, taking place while the sentence of imprisonment is in course of execution* If it is desired to remove a prisoner from Ethiopia while he is actually under going his sentence of imprisonment, this must he done either hy an order under Article 5? or under Article 53* These articles provide tne procedure under which a sentence of i xoi isoument passed in Ethiopia shall he carried out elsewhere or hy which a prisoner who has already begun to serve a pant Ox his sentence in Ethiopia may he removed to serve the xomainder elsewhere* He cannot he deported under an order of deportation while he is actually undergoing his sentence* There are thus three possibilities in connexion with a prisoner who is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment and co deportation at the same time 9 i*e*, an order may be made for the execution of the sentence outside the limits of tnis Order under Article 57, in which case he is sent outside Ethiopia as a prisoner to serve all his sentence there, and there is no scope for actually executing the order of deportation, though the order will have the effect of subjecting him to penalties if he returns to Ethiopia when he is released* The second alternative is that an order is made during the course of his sentence under the Oolcnial Prisoners Removal Act, Article 58* and the third alternative is that he serves the whole of his sentence of imprisonment inin Ethiopia and is thon deported as a deportee under this Article, since his sentence has 'been served* I have also introduced a certain number of amendments of a drafting character, chiefly because the existing Order hardly seems to have taken account of the fact that Ethiopia is not upon the sea coast* 'Ahere a deportee is sent through British Somali land, it would seem to be most correct that the warrant for deportation should order his deportation first of all to the appropriate place in British Somaliland, and provide for his further deportation from that place to the country to which he is ultimately to be deports&amp;c In other words, paragraph 6 of my draft seems to be the one to be applied where the dexjortee is sent through British Somali land© If a deportee is sent through French Somaliland, then it depends upon the local French law in that French territory wheh’ , li the custody will continue to be lawful while the prisoner is passing through French territory© The warrant of deportation, will be sufficient authority so far as English law can cover the case © It seems at first sight odd that an Ethiopian Order in Council can legalise anything which takes place outside the limits of the Order* But so far as English law is concerned, this is made possible by Section 3 of the Foreign Jurisdiction Act* Unless, however, the pos.Lwion ac# regards the French law in French Somaliland as regards the lawfulness of the custody is ascertained, it would seem that all deportees and also j^ersons sent to serve their sentences abroad or removals under the Colonial Prisoners Removal Act or the Fugitive Offenders Act should, as far as possible, be sent throu^i British Somali land© My paragraph 5 is new, but the substance of it may have been omitted from the existing*existing Order 'because it was not seen that the words of Article 119 of the original Order did not cover deporteesc Article 66 of my draft corresponds to paragraph 10 of Article 75 of the existing Order, and the corresponding paragraph in Mr* Mackareth’s draft* I have simply made it a grave offence against the Order for a deportee to return without permission, thereby bringing into play Article 4G of my draft, which specifies the penalties for grave offences against the Order* Inquestsg My Article 66 corresponds with Article 59 of the existing Order* Part IV Civil Matters (a) General * Articles 67 and 69 of my draft correspond with Articles 80 and 81 of the existing Order, and Articles 71 and 72 of Mr* Mackareth*s draft* I have amended the provisions of the existing Order along the lines of Articles 90 and 91 of the Egypt Order* (b) Special Provisions* Article 69 of my draft corresponds with Article 115 of the existing Order* As it deals with an essentially civil liability, I think it is better placed here* Article 70 of my draft corresponds to Article 157 of the existing order^ Reference is made to the Act of 19.8o which nas replaced the Act of 1881* ( c) Mode of Trial Article 71 of my draft corresponds with Article 82 of the ' existing Order, and 73 of Mr* Maokaretirs draft* Mr*Mackareih has inserted in his draft a large number of articles, namely Articles 74 to 103, dealing with procedure in civil matters* With one or two exceptions, the substance of which I have retainedrstained with minor amendments In my Article 71, T think that all the material in these articles of Mr, Mackareth’s draft are matters of procedure which should he dealt with hy Rules of Court and not in the Order in Councilo Article 102 gives the widest power to regulate all manners of procedure hy Rules of Court, and this is, in my opinion, the -proper place for rules of this kindo As soon as the order is settled, the work of preparing the Rules of Court will have to he commenced© In preparing these Rules, it should he home in mind that they have to he fitted in to the Indian Code on Civil Procedure which applies except in so far as express provision is made to the contrary© It may he useful to the Legation at Addis Ahaha, in preparing the Rules of Court to have copies of the Rules of Court under the China Order, under the Morocco Order, and under the Egyptian Order© (For reasons already given above, I have not adopted Articles 104 and 105 of Mr© Mackareth*a draft, because I do not txiihk that the procedure hy way of stating a case for the decision of a higher court on a point of law is well suited to the conditions in Ethiopia)o After considering the matter at some length and carefully reading the observations in Mr# Mackareth*s memorandum, I have eliminated from my draft Articles 83 to 86 of the existing Order and Articles 106 and 107 of Mr© Mackareth f s draftc As the matter stands in my draft, the law and procedure with regard to arbitrations will he that which exists in British India ..The re are provisions with regard to arbitration both in the Indian Code or Civil Procedure and, I think, in a special Indian Arbitration Act. In so far as on matters of procedure special Rules have to be introduced, the Rules of Court would be the right place for them©I very nrucii doubt whether arbitration in civil matters v/ould be of gi*ea‘G importance in Ethiopiaj and in any case I do not think it wise to attempt to legislate specially and along special lines for Ethiopia* It seems to me to be better to base oneself on the Indian law on procedure and only to make by Rules of Court such provisions with regard to procedure as the conditions in Ethiopia actually require* ( d) Bankruptcy Article VE of my draft corresponds to 36 of the existing Order and Article 109 of Mr* Me^areth’s draft* I have adopted Mr* Mackareth*a addition and also extended the bankruptcy jurisdiction to all persons subject to the Order* (e) Lunacy Artiel *6 73 and 74 of my draft correspond to Articles 87 and 88 of the existing Order and 110 and 111 of Mr* Mackaretli* s draft. In my Article 74 I have replaced the reference to the Act of 1851 by the Act of 1913* This is in fact no change of substance because there is a provision in the existing Order that references to Acts which have been repealed or amended are to be deemed to be references to the later Acts. The reference to the Act of 1851 was clearly a slip in the drafting of the existing Order* The Lunacy (District Courts) Act 1858 was also repealed by the Indian Lunacy Act 1912* (Note* I have cut out in various places in my draft tne words following a reference to a specific Act “or any other Act ”of Parliament substituted for or amending the said Act', since this point is covered in a general way by the provisions of Article 4)o ( f) Matrimonial Causes.etc « Article 74 of ray draft corresponds to Article 89 of the existingexisting Order and Article 112 of lyH 1 * Macliaretii 3 d.rai*v« 1 have maintained the existing exclusion from tne juris diction of the Court of the Consul-General of the power to ma&gt;e decrees of divorce s on the groimd that tUs jurisdiction is one herdly suitable for &amp; non-professional courtc The effect? however, cf this (as Mr« Gardiner las x-’^t^ted out/ is to le?. o the mono famous British community in Ethiopia, i«e w , persons domiciled there, without any tribunal in which they • .'ir. have recourse to get divorce at all-seeing tiiaTi under tne r.neo ^f law in force in all parts of the British Empire it is the court of the matrimonial domicile which alone has jurisdiction in divorce*. It should he explained in this connexion that at the time when the existing Order was drafted it was thought that a British subject could not acquire a legal domicile xn an exterritorial country* The Privy Council, however, over- ruled this vieur in the case of Casdagli v« Casdagli in 1S19. and after that decision power was conferred on our courts in China and Egypt to malte decrees of divorce, and in Morocco tne Supreme Court of Gibraltar possesses that jurisdiction, I have thought it better, however, not to amend the Order .so as to confer this jurisdiction on the Court in Ethiopia. Tne monogamous community of British subjects domiciled there is very small and it is probably unlikely that any cases will arise in practice. If the community grows in size and if cased do arise where the absence of any jurisdiction having competence to grant divorces to those people appears lilcely to cause injustice, the position will have to be reconsidered. As an alternative to conferring jurisdiction on the Court of tne Consul-General, it might be possible to confer jurisdiction either on His Majesty’s Supreme Court for Egypt, if that if still in existence, or on some court in Eastern Africa.The jurisdiction, even if possessed, would not, of course, apply to Somalis and British Indians other than Christians o Article 75 of my draft corresponds to Article 156 of the existing Order, hut I thiidc its proper place is here, I have not adopted in my draft new provisions on the lines of Articles 101, 102 and 103 of the Egypt Order, which articles make applicable in Egypt the Legitimacy Act of 1926 and the Adoption of Children Act, 1926, for the reason that in Ethiopia the general system of law made applicable is not English but Indian law, and if and in so far as statutes have been passed in India on the lines of the Legitimacy Act or the Adoption of Children Act, such statutes will be ipso facto applicable in Ethiopia under Article GV&lt;, If special provision is required for matters of procedure in applying these Acts in Ethiopia this can be done by Rules of Court* (g) Probate and Administration My Article 76 corresponds with Article 90 of the existing Order and Article 113 of Mr * MacRnreth s cLraxt* iiie Indian Succession Act, 1865, has been repealed and tne Indian Succession Act, 1925, has taken its place® borne cnanges introduced in my draft are due to this fact® Xn my Articles 71 and 84 I have made a small change by maiding the Articles depend not upon a person dying in Ethiopia but dying there and leaving property there 6 Article 80 (l) » I have made all the estate of a deceased person vest in the Consul-General until administration granted if there is no will® In my Article Sl o corresponding to Article 96, and in my Article 82, corresponding to Article 96 of the existing Order, I have eliminated the specified penalty, and simjj^ made the action a grave offence against the order® remark applies to my Article 84o The same Ar ticle 86Article 86 corresponds to Article 100 of the existing Order* Article 97 corresponds to Article 101 of the existing Order* Article 88 corresponds to Article 98 ( 4 ) of Mr 0 Mackareth’s draft* I have extended his draft also, however, to cover the Danes and Swedes and other persona who are subject to the Order although not British subjects* (h) Appeals* (i) Appeals from a Consular Court to the Court of the Consul-Oeneral* ^ Articles 8? to 92 correspond with Articles 102 and 105 of the existing Order in Council and Article 125 of Mr&lt;. Maclcareth*8 draft- X think that Mr* Mackareth T s criticisms about the existing Order on this point are to some extent justified* I think the intention of my nev/ drafts which introduces some new features, is cloar, and therefore I submit it for consideration* Mr, Gardiner has suggested that the provisions of this Order relating to appeals from a Consular Court to the Court of the Consul-General should be by way of adaptations of the Indian Codes, making a Consular Court correspond to lower Indian Courts and the Court of the Consul-General to higher Indian Courts* I have investigated this hut have come to the conclusion that it is not desirable or practicable The necessary adaptations would, I think, be complicated and it is simpler and more suited to local conditions to provide specially for the Courts in Ethiopia simpler and more flexible rules for appeals« Article 95 takes the place of 104 of the existing Order and corresponds to Article 125 in Mru Mackareth’s draft*I refer to my observations on Article 52* most of irtiich apply also to tills Article® In particular I call attention to the amendments introduced in paragraph 7 of this Article to meet the views eagressed by the Judges of the Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa® Part V« Procedure, Civil and Criminal* The arrangement of the Articles in my draft in Part V differs considerably from that in the existing Order® A number of Articles which in the existing Order are found in Part V have already been placed elsey/here* and there are a number of Articles brought into Part V in my draft from other parts of the Order® Article 94 of my draft corresponds with Article 1GC of the original Order, and Article 167 of Mr« Mackareth* s draft It is slightly amended* Article 95 of my draft corresponds with Article 22 of the existing Order and 23 of Mr* Mack&amp;reth^s draft® It has, however, been amended on the lines of the corresponding Article in the Egypt Order in Council* Article 96 in my draft corresponds to Article 121 in the existing Order® Article 97 in ray draft corresponds to Article 20 of the existing Order# The first paragraph, however, of Article 20 of the existing Order is omitted for the following reasonsc Section 11 of the Evidence Act, 1851, has been repealed sc far as British India is concerned, and the reference to Section 7 of this Act in the existing Order in Council appears to be based on a misconception, seeing that Section 7 of tiiat Act deals with the manner in which, in the English Courts, judicial documents emanating from courts in other parts of H®M 0 dominions are to be proved. To apply that section to the ConsularArticle 104 Consular Courts in Ethiopia as if they 77ere colonial courts* in the Ethiopia Order in Council, will not in any way affect the position of the proof before t3ie English courts of docmrento emanating from the Consular courts* The correspon ding provision was omitted from the new Egypt Order in Council on the same ground* Mr« Maclean also suggested this omission in his memorandumo My Article 98 corresponds to Article 122 of the existing Order and Article 145 of Mr* Mackareth’e draft* I have introduced his suggestion with regard to Letters of Request * A similar amendment was made in the nexz Egypt Order in Council * Article 99 in my draft corresponds to Article 21 of the existing Order* Article 100 corresponds with Article 169 of the existing Order* Article 101 of my draft corresponds to Article 105 of the existing Order* (Article 107 of the existing Order disappears from this part* as the substance of it has been included in Article 18 (2) of my draft)« Article 102 of my draft corresponds to Article 108 of the existing Order and 151 of Mr* Machareth’s draft* My paragraphs (O* (i)&gt; and (2) are new, hut follow corresponding provisions in the Egypt Order in Councilo Attention is called to the proviso to paragraph (3) of this Article in ray draft** This incorporates a provision which was found in the proposed amending Order in Council* Article 103 of my draft corresponds to Article 110 of the existing Order* The only change of substance is the addition of the words H and approved by the Court’ 1 in paragraph (l) (c) * The amendment follows the corresponding provision in the Egypt Order*Article 111 Article 104 of my draft corresponds to Articles 111 and 112 of the existing Order# Although a much shorter text, I think it covers everything which these two articles in the existing text cover* Article 105 of my draft is a new provision borrowed from the Egypt Order.

Native and Foreign Subjects and Tribunals# Mr# Maclean suggested that we should eliminate from the Order all powers of the Court to entertain mixed cases on the ground that these come within the jurisdiction of the Mixed Court in Ethiopia, and that, although foreign plaintiffs sometimes resorted to our Court under these articles in order to get speedy judgment against a British subject, there was no reciprocity# On the whole, however, I have come to the con clusion that it is better not to omit them# Mixed cases go before the Mixed Courts in Egypt also, but nevertheless in the Egypt Order in Council similar provisions have been retainedc I am a little influenced by the legal maxim boni judicis est amp11are jurlsdlctlonem o I have, however, substituted for Articles 124 to 127 of the original Order a single article 113# which is shorter and simpler and based in substance upon the corresponding article of the new Egypt Order# Article 114 of my draft takes the place of the second proviso to Article 60 of the existing Order# appears to be here# Article 115 of my draft takes the place the original Order# Its proper place of Article 129 ofArticle 116 of my draft corresponds to Article 123 of the existinc Order* In the third paragraph I have eliminated the special penalty, of which there are far too many in the existing Order, and simply made failure to attend or give evidence, etc*, a grave offence under Article 32* Article 117 of my draft corresponds to Article 71 of the existing Order* As Mr* Maclean has already observed, its proper place is in this section*) Article 118 of my draft corresponds to Article 72 of the existing Order, but I thinh its proper place is here* Beth Mro Maclean and Mr* Mackareth have suggested the omission of this article* I understand their reason to be that this being an offence against an Ethiopian tribunal it would be dealt with and punished by the Ethiopian tribunal itself* This may be the case, but the Ethiopian tribunal has to appljr the law of the defendant* The law of tho defendant is this Order, and this article will in fact provide the penalty which the Mixed Court is in a position to impose* Article 119 of my draft takes the placo of Article 130 of the existing Order* It has been completely redrafted and, I hope, simplified* Articles 120 and 121 take the place of Article 35 of the existing Order, but I have separated in two articles the provision providing for the custody pending trial of a person to be tried in the Mixed Court and the execution of the sentence of the Mixed Court* This jurisdiction is, of course, based upon the last paragraph of Article 7 of the Klobukowski Treaty* It follows from this provision of the treaty, as interpreted by the exterritorial powers in Ethiopia and as applied in practice, that, when a British subject is to be tried for an offence before the Mixed Court, though the EthiopianEthiopian authorities may arrest him, it is for his Consular authorities to he responsible for his custody and appearance at the trial, and similarly, though the Mixed Court may convict and sentence him, applying the law of the defendant, in this respect, it is for the Consular authorities to see that the sentence is executed* I have, however, introduced two amendments into my Article 119, (a) a email one providing iox the taking of security as an alternative for custody as a means of securing the accused^ attendance at his trial, ano. (b. .. proviso limiting the time under which an accused may he he la in custody pending his trial 'before tho Mixed Court* l*.. latte? 1 amendment was introduced in response to Mr» Maclean s comments, who said he thought something of this kind was desira.o3.e in view of the Ethiopian practice of arresting a British subject for trial before the Mixed Courts and then leaving him to se detained there indefinitely during the delays of Ethiopian judicial orocedure before he was ever brought to trial* I uave not gone nearly so far as Mr* Maclean in limiting the time in which a prisoner should be detained in custody pending trial, because I feared that it would be impossible to expect the Mixed Courts to work as quickly. My draft provides an extreme limit of six weeks during which a person may be detained in custody pending trial before the Ethiopian Mixed Court* Article 121* The existing Order only provides for the execution by the Consular Court of sentences of imprisonment passed by the Mixed Court. It does not provide eitner for wie execution of sentences of dearth passed by the Mixed ccin-c or for the execution of fines* If our owit Court had been left -it i the power to pass sentences of death £&gt;T murder, it would have been necessary to take power to carry out sentences of deo/ui.. Passed by the Mixed Court, and this is, I understand, what Sir Sydney Barton considered should be done. The Secretary ox ^ •''» however,havzeverj felt quite unable to sanction such a course (see niy conunento on Ai*ticle 46 above) » The position under my draft Order is that our own Court in Ethiopia has no oower to pass sentences of death# Consequently, the Ethiopian Court, applying the law of the defendant, will also have no such power, and the absence of any such power in the Order in Council will be a valid legal answer to any demand by the Ethiopian judge that a sentence of death should be passed# There is no reason, however, why lower should not be taken to execute a sentence of the Mixed Court imposing a fine, and in my draft I have added this# I have also provided that in cases of sentences of imprisonment, the imprisonment shall be carried out in the same prisons in Ethiopia as those in which sentences of our own Court would be carried oatt. This is done by a reference to Article 65. The last sentence of my draft is merely a reminder that when a person is serving in Ethiopia in one of our Consular prisons a sentence of imprisonment imposed by the Mixed Court, and it is desirable that the service of his sentence should be completed elsewhere, ho may be removed to serve his sentence elsewhere under the Colonial Prisoners Removal Aot* The Law Officers of the Crown have advised that this can be done # Part VII.

Business names # My Article 185 adopts the substance of Mr# Machareth*&amp; suggestion with regard to the registration of business names where a x^erson or a firm trading in Ethiopia trades in a name other than his ordinary name 0 Part VIII# King’s Regulations# My Articles 126* 137, 128 and 129 correspond to Artielee 161 to 153 of the existing Order with certain amendments * Vllth regard to the provision which is found in paragraph (b) of my Article 125* Mr# Mackareth has observed that it is unnecessary to make King’s Regulations on these points* seeing that an offence by a British subject against any local la?; or custom or treaty applicable to Ethiopia would be triable in the Mixed Courts# I am not sure in fact that all such offences would be so tried* but insofar ae they are* the observation which I have already made above applies, namely that the Regulations would not be without any purpose since (a) without such Regulations the law and custom or treaty would not be applicable to British subjects at all* and consequently the Ethiopian Mixed Court could not convict a British subject for failing to comply with them* and (b) the penalties which the Mixed tribunals applyingapplying the law of the defendant, Ghoi ld inpose would he the law laid down in the Regulations« I have omitted paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 161 of the existing Order on two grounds (l) that they would he covered hy the general words in paragraph (a), and (2) that the insertion of these particular provisions rather tends to give an unnecessary limiting sense to the provisions of paragraph (a) • I am unaware whether any Regulations have ever heen made under paragraph 3 of Article 151 of the existing Order, and I am somewhat doubtful as to the purpose of this provision* In my Article 127 I have emitted paragraph 2 of Article 168 of the existing Order* The corresponding provision was omitted when the new Egypt Order in Council was drafted* As the judge of the Court in Egypt pointed out, paragraph 1 of Article 127 and paragraph 3 of Article 128 contain all that can properly he provided for the validity and force of King’s Regulations, and paragraph 2 of Article 158 of the existing Order could have no real effect and seems to he an attempt to invest King’s Regulations with a sacrosanct character, which they can hardly properly claim* Part IX• Misee1lane ous * The number of articles in this part of my draft is enormously reduced in view of the fact that the majority of the provisions which are found in that part of the existing Order have already heeii placed elsewhere in my draft* My Article 130 is borrowed from the Egypt Order, Article 184# It takes the place of Article 151 of the existing Order, but is more general and wide in its scope* Article 132 of my draft is based almost entirely upon the corresponding provision in the Egypt Order * Paragraph 4 is intended to provide for the continuation of the existing statestate of affairs as regards arrangements for holding courts 9 etc., until any new appointments that are required under the new Order can he definitely made.
