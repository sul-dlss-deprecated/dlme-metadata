Writing to a friend of his in Bahrein he made the following remark 'Every thing that I asked from Sheikh Mubarrak and the Wali was granted'. Another letter from ^asar-as-Sabaih states that the Turkish Government has granted a subsidy to Abdullah bin Ali. 2. Making allowances for exaggeration it will appear that Sheikh Mubarrak considers Qasar-as-Sabaih as no use to him and has made it over to the Turks. Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, I.

Mackenzie, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrein, to Lieutenant- Colonel P.Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. -^7 /r^ With reference to your letter No. 1355 dated the 27th May 1910, I have the honsur to inform you that the A1 bu Ainain have built a fort at Qasar-as-Sabaih, within which they have erected huts and houses. They are said to fly the Turkish Flag on Fridays. Since the visit of the Turkish Officers previously mentioned it is reported that one or two Turkish soldiers go to Qasar-as- Sabaih occasionally to deliver messages. It is believed that the Turks intend to station a Military post there, and that further developments of Turkish interests are expected there and elsewhere in this vicinity after the Mutassariff of Hasa returns from Busreh in about a fortnight. I am afraid 'elsewhere' is rather vague, but it is meant to show that the general impression is that a renewal of Turkish activity is to be expected although nothing definite is known., I should think however their first endeavours will be to estab lish better control over the Bedouin. Soldiers coming from Hasa state that all Hasa garrisons are shortly to be strengthened. The Kaimmakam of Katif is said to have prohibited the entry of armed people into Katif. Ostensibly his reason is on account of the late raid in which 5 natifis were killed by the Beni Hajir on the village of Awamiah ( ) quite close to natif. It may be one of these apasmodic orders to which nobody pays any attention after three days, or the kaimmakam may possibly be acting on instruct ions from Busreh, but I will endeavour to give further informa tion on this point later. Five Turkish soldiers are said to be on the Jazirat al Arnair. ( &lt; XJL No. 1360, dated Bushire, the 27th May (received 6th June) 1910. From— Libutenant-Colonel P. Z.

Shakbspbar, I.A., Political Agent, To— Lieutenant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to previous correspondence regarding the move of the A 1 bu Ainain tribe from Wakra to Kasr-as Sabaih, I would invite a reference to my diary for the week ending 16th March 1910 relating to the arrival in Koweit of the heads of this tribe. 2. Some time subsequently I referred to their presence in a conversation with Sheikh Mubarak, who gave me the following accouut of their interview with him, which I have the honour to submit for the information of Government. 3. Sheikh Mubarak said that the men had come to seek his protection and he had discussed their affairs with them, pointing out to them that he considered them foolish for having canvassed so many different authorities for assistance. They were originally subjects of Sheikh Jasim bin Thani, and after a quarrel with him had fled from Katar; they had then interviewed the Political Agent at. Bahrein and Sheikh Isa bin Khalifa for their protection ; then they had settled at Kasr-as-Sabaih, a foreign land so far as they were concerned ; after that they had approached the Turkish authorities in A 1 Hasa as well as the Ajman Bedouin Sheikhs for protection. They had besides sent a deputation to inter view the Wali at Basra with the same objects and lastly had come to Mubarak himself, to beg his favour. The Sheikh said he had told them that if they were so foolish as to entangle themselves with so many different interests, and inter ests which were almost certain to conflict, he saw no reason to compromise himself with them. Beyond this he had no particular objection to their settling in Kasr-as-Sabaih so long as their presence there led to no trouble. 4. The Sheikh’s action, if what he recounted to me truly describes it,—and l have no particular reason to doubt the story—,seems to have been dictated by his usual cautious diplomacy, and as the men probably considered they had obtained all they required in his sanction to their settlement, they w r ent away satisfied. 5. The Sheikh treated them with his customary generous hospitality whilst in Koweit, and I do not think any particular inference can be drawn ftom it, though doubtless the A 1 bu Ainain considered it a good augury of the future. 6. Whether the Sheikh really exercises much authority so far south of Koweit is doubtful, though he certainly claims jurisdiction over Kasr-as-Sabaih, as explained in my letter No. 558 of the nth October 1909. 7. I heard from Bahrein thak the tribe had received or were promised a sub sidy from the Turkish Government, but have been unable to obtain any confirm ation of this in Koweit.

I replied that in my opinion that territory belonged to Sheikh Mubarak and no unfriendly act could be done by us to Sheikh Mubarak, to whom I referred the depute. 2. It appeared in conversation that the object was to get back ten divers from Doha, and that they had already approached the Turks with this object and had been refused assistance. The absolute untrustworthiness of this tribe is therefore once more established. 3. Ahmed bin Muhammad Khatar also stated, but not to me personally^ that two Turkish officials had been to Abdullah bin Ali, headman of the A 1 bu Ainain in Kasr as-Sabaih, requesting him.to make a treaty with the Turks, but they were put off with evasive replies. The probable object of delay was to await the answer I would give their emissary. 4. It is also reported that there are one or two Turkish soldiers in each of the islands, Mussalamiyah and Abu Ali, known more generally as the Jezirat a! Amair.

This information may be considered reliable as coming from Id bin Rashid, one of the headmen of the Bu Ainain, and also from Sheikh Jasim bin Abdul Wahhab Pasha of Darin (near Katlf). * The latter had visited Qasar-as-Sabaih about 5 weeks ago and personally seen the Turkish Flag. I did not consider it advisable to make a personal trip of inspection in my Steam Launch. I am however confident that this information is correct. ^ * 2. Later actions of the Turks do not appear to corroborate the report made in my letter No. 420, dated the 12th June regarding, expected developments of Turkish activity in these parts. In fact on the contrary reduction^ are apparently to be made in Hasa and Doha garrisons, as the expenditure hitherto incurred , is not deemed Justified by the work done by these tropps. The S.S.

In reply to your letter No. 459, dated the 25th February 1911, I have the honour to state that reports of the A 1 Bu Ainain tribe are very meagre, even from Arabs frequenting the desert close to their settlement. I took the oppor tunity of making frequent enquiries during the first part of my recent tour which brought me to within two days’ march of Qasr-as*Sabaih and with the following results. Kh 1 ' n 2. It appears that the A 1 Bu Ainain live peaceably enough and are on good terms with the surrounding Bedouin of the Ajman, Bam Khalid, Bani Hajir and AI Morrah tribes, “ rafiqs ” from each of which are maintained in the town. 3. I was informed that there is at present no Turkish garrison in the place but that visits are not infrequently paid to it from the Katif and Hasa garrisons by parties of two or three Turkish soldiers. The Shaikh of the Al Bu Ainain draws a small subsidy from the Turks, named by various informants as from $20 to $40 per mensem. 4. Abdul Aziz bin Saud told me that the Shaikh had sent him a present and begged to be taken under his protection, and that he had replied with the phrases suitable to the occasion; he added that the Al Bu Ainain had no more love for the Turks than any other Arabs, but had to keep on good terms with them. In Kuwait nothing definite beyond rumours to the above effect is ascertain able.X V V No of 1911. V s British Residency and Consulate-General. Bushire, &amp; August 1911.

It is stated that,,he adman of the tribe, Sheikh A&gt; tail ah bin j^li,visited him on board his launch,when Bheikh fubarak took him to -ask for the treatment ac corded to Kuwai - subjects by the A1 bu Ainain. Sheikh Abdallah and his supporters replied that they were not Sheikh Ifubar.nk's subjects, 'hey were not illtroating foreigners; hut that in their own interests they would not allow i oraigners to settle in Qasr us Subaih. 'ihey were themselves 'Turkish subjects. Sheikh Mubarak replied tnat tne place belon red to him and that they there - ore could not be regarded as Turkish subjects. To this the rejoinder was made that the tribe had been assured by by the 'Turkish Authorities that Qasr us Subaih was Turkish Territory, and had been advised that any one laying claim to it should be referred to them. 3. Sheikh Mubarak did not press the matter further and, refusing an invitation to land, took his leave. He invited the chiefs of the A1 bu Ainain to visit him in Kuwait to which they replied • , Inshallah ,, in a tone. From To Sir,/N ho T ravep,which was intorprotRd a refusal. 4. I have to edd that it is said that the Al bu Ainain settlement at Qasr us Rubalh has thriven exceed- i tly during the ;ast year. They have created a large mart which, besides supplying their own wants,is resort ed to by large numbers oi the Bedouin of the interior, for whom it is more conveniently situated than Bahrain or Kuwait. he Al bu Ainain ob ain large consignments oi goods from Bahrain and Basra and,having resolutely excluded all foreigners,have kept the trade and its pro: its entirely in their own hands. It is assented that if Oasr us Bubaih continues to i lourish as during the past year it will soon be a trade centre and pojst of great importance. ^ further stated that 'heikh Mubarak has taken alarm at the very large number of Bedouin who now report to Opsv us Bubaih which he fears may lead to the . creation oi political alliances which will secure to ue Al bu Ainain strong Bedouin support against himself. He has therefore announced that no Bedouin who visits Oasr us fiubaih will be allowed to enter Kuwait. 'his report is of course based entirely on native ini: ormation.

It is said that the Mutesarrif of Hasa intends to proceed on a tour to Oqair, Qasr-as-Subaih and Qatar very soon. He could not set out earlier on account of the presence of the cholera in Qatif and Darin during the lasL two months. The object of his tour, it is al- -leged, is to investigate and consider ppolitical ques- -tions affecting the administration of the localities mentioned. With reference to paragraph 192, it is further sta- -ted that the Mutesarrif of Hasa told the headman of Al- bu Ainain of Qasr-as-Subaih that he will presently cre- -ate a military post in their settlement. He also pro- -mised to send a Turkish flagstaff to be erected there. Finally he hoped to visit the place shortly.When I asked Government in my telegram of 8th August, No. 739, if there was any objection to my arranging for “ a visit by Lawrence ”, it was only my intention to send the chip and not to go myself. After receipt of Government^ permission to go there no opportunity occurred, and mean while the Political Agent, Kuwait, learnt from Shaikh Mubarak of his own interview with the inhabitants of Kasr-as-Subaih, and the former (Shaikh Mubarak) stated that a mast had been sent there by the Turks but that they had not hoisted it (I speak from memory) and were anxious to have relations with Kuwait. In view of the Kuwait report the urgency for sending the M Lawrence ” there to spy out the land seemed less pressing, and, as she was fully employed up to the time I left, I thought the visit might await my return. We now have the news from Bahrain. The question is whether we can do anything to discourage Turkish activity there. ^ It would be obviously inconvenient to have the Turkish flag there and the A1 bu’Ainain possibly starting a small pearl mart there under its segis. If we come to asserting ourselves on the linesl) proposed by the recent Committee, we might deal with Kasr-as-Subaih, remove any Turkish flagstaff should we find one and inf or m the tribe that the installation of the Turkish flag there is an innovation and will not be allowed. Short of a settlement of issues with the Turks, I think, we might connive at Shaikh Mubarak coercing them should they introduce any real signs of Turkish control. We must bear the subject in njy mind, but I do not think anything can be done until the place has been visited and the value of the Bahrain reports ascertained for certain. 19-1-12. P. Z.

The Mutasarrif of Hasa arrived in Qatif about a fortnight ago and is still thdre. He is engaged in i* •-endeavouring to remove discord subsisting between the Bedouin and the people of Qatif and Awamiya. No exact account of his doings has as yet been received in Bahrein. It is stated that the headman of the A1 bu 'Ainain in Qasr-as-Subaih visited the Mutasarrif in Qatif and assured him of their allegiance to the Porte. The Muta- -sarrif thanked them for their friendly reception, and informed them that the Turkish Government was pleased to appoint Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali, their Chie£, to the Mudirship of Qasr-as-Subaih :with an annual allowance of £T.50/~. He also informed them that their request for a military garrison had been granted, and that a detach- -ment of 10 soldiers would shortly be provided. He in- -tended to visit Qasr-as-Subaih himself, when he would determine the position of the flagstaff and the site of the barracks. r r i\ With reference to paragraph 10, the following further information^ has been received t-~ The Man's name was Ahmad Bey. He came from Constan- -tinople via Busreh and called in at Qatif. There he met the Qaim Muqam of the place and also the Mutasarrif of Hasa. He is said to have had important confabulations those officials, but on what subjects is not known. He left Bahrain for Busreh again on the S.S. 'Pandua' on 8th January. While in Bahrein he busied himself with obtaining information as to the number of resident Turkish subjects the relations between the Political Agent and the Ruler.He also enquired into state of looal feeling towards the British Government, and sought for information regarding Qasr-as-Gubaih, its prospects of development, and its probable revenue-paying capacities. As he was unacquaimt- -ed with Arabic, he pursued his investigations through the medium of an interpreter whom he brought with him. He appears to belong to the 'Moderate' party in mo- -dern Turkish politics, and is said to have inveighed bitterly against the proceedings of the 'Committee of Union and Progress'.

According to confiden- -tial information, the subjects of discussion between the Mutasarrif of Hasa and the Qaim Muqam of Qatif, were 1. Recent orders issued by the supreme Government regarding the census of date-trees in Qatif, to which the local public is much opposed. Final executive orders have not yet been received; 2. The establishment of a 'Maktab Rushdiyah'( ) at Qatif, to which the public is also averse. a 3. The creation of/Mudirship and Customs House at Darin, and the maintenance of a Military garrison. In regard to this, the people have stated that they will not be responsible if the proposed institutions are raided by the Bedouins - presumably a threat. The settlement of the question is deferred until the return from Bombay of the Headman of Darin, Sheikh Qasim bin Muhammad Pasha. 4. The establishment of a Military post at Qasr-as- -Subaih. This is said to be in process of accomplish- -ment. A serious breach between the local Turkish Civil and Military authorities is reported from Qatif. A certain Yuzbashi (Captain) and Chaush (Naib), are said to have been in the habit of seizing lucerne from some lucerne-sellers of Tarut, without payment or at half price. The latter complained to their headman, Sheikh Mansur - a local Mulla. He instructed them to resist such demands. This they did xxt with success. The disappointed Yuzbashi then proceeded with some soldiers to Sheikh Man- -sur's house and arrested him. He then succeeded also in arresting the lucerne-sellers, and he marched all off to prison in the Fort! An r. fl i. / ■ ' &gt;r „ p K*&gt;-£ ' V; '-' ‘ An influential Arab, Bin Ikhwan, hearing of Sheikh Mansur's fate who was a friend of his, mustered his fol- -lowersfSLrsEdx, forced the fort and released the prisoners, He then required the Yuzbashi to accompany him to Haji Mansur Pasha at Qatifi to explain his conduct. In the course of discussion before the Pasha , the Yuzbashi drew his dagger threateningly and was promptly rellegated to prison. It is now said thaL a mem^orial has been drawn up by Haji Mansur Pasha and the people, complaining of the conduct of the Yuzbashi, and is being despatched to Constantinople with the approval of the Mutasarrif. And a notice has been issued by Haji Mansur Pasha that no one is to have recourse to the Turkish Courts in Qatif till an answer is received to the memorial.DRAFT—(For Approval).

With reference to para 48, further reports from Qasr- as-Subaih stated that the flagstaff has been erected, and that the Turkish flag is flown on Fridays and special occasions. The Turkish Government has recognised Sheikh 'Abdullah bin 'Ali as headman of the A1 Bu ’Ainain and has appointed Muhamm bin ’Ali A1 Bu 'Ainain as Mudir of ^asr-as-Subaih with an allowance of T£ 5 per mensem. He is also to be given a clerk. For the present the Mudir's office is ac commodated in a house hired for the purpose, but special quarters are shortly to be built. The customs dues at present are collected and re tained for himself by the Headman. 59. It is stated that after the Mutasarrif's return to Hofuf, some of the A1 Bu 'Ainain went to Koweit and had an interview with Sheikh Mubarak. The latter questioned them about the affairs of Qasr-as-Subaih and enquired as to what had induced them to ask for the creation of a Military post at Qasr-as-Subaih. They alleged that they feared Bedouin raids and had asked for protection. Sheikh Mubarak said that they would do better to pay him the taxes usually paid by his subjects when they would be se cured against Bedouin raids and all other forms of Moles tation. They replied that their ancestors had owned Qasr- as-Subaih and that they were Turkish Subjects and could not pay taxes to him. Sheikh Mubarak then said that they need not look to him in the future for help in time of trouble, and they should make their own arrangements to meet the raids of Bedouin from the interior. If however theythey molested any of his subjects he would employ every means to exact reparation. The Al Bu 'Ainain returned to their home much dejected and are said to have reported to the Mutasarrif that Sheikh Mubarak has threatened them with Bedouin raids, and that the Turkish Government must be ready to despatch aid to them at a moment's notice. In the meantime they are devoting their attention to preventing Koweities and other foreigners from settling aniong them.

The development is inconvenient, however, and it gives the Turks a footing at a point on the coast between Bahrain and Kuwait conveniently situated for ultimate adoption by pearlers as a port of call for water and provisions. It also affords fresh evidence of the intention of the Porte to assert them selves wherever possible in the Persian Gulf, during the negotiations at present in progress with Great Britain. Should these negotiations prove abortive, some prompt and effective action on our part for the protection of our interests will be urgently necessary.

I took an opportunity of speaking to Shaikh Mubarak of the Bahrain report and he tells me that when the headmen came to him, he informed them that he would not assist them unless they agreed to come into line with the other tribes who acknowledged his authority either by paying him “ zikat ” as the Bedouin do or by paying him the usual “gowasa ” (Shaikh’s share in a pearling- boat) which he receives from the diving community. According to ShailTh Mubarak the headmen at the time said they were agreeable, but he himself is sceptical that they will keep their word w T hen the diving season closes. He offered to guarantee the settlement from molestation by Bedouin and others if they conformed to the above signs of his authority over them. He added that he was aware of the extent to which the A 1 Bu ’Ainain had introduced Tmkish interference into their community and he was not prepared to embroil himself with the Turks in the matter for so insignificant a community without some I have the honour to refer to the correspondence (1) a flagstaff has been erected from which the Turkish flag is flown on Sundays and special occasions ; \ 4 - It will be seen frc 4.

If they refused to sell these to Kuwait boats they would only hurt themselves by losing a rather lucrative trade, whilst the boats would provision, as they used to do before, either from Kuwait trading boats or from Darin and other places.

The correspondence contains the discussion between British officials as to whether Qasr as-Sabaih lay in territory of the Ruler of Kuwait or was under Turkish jurisdiction. It also discusses how the 'headman of the Al Bu Ainain', Abdullah bin Ali, approached a number of authorities to seek their assistance, including the Ruler of Bahrain, the Wali of Basrah, and the Turkish authorities in Al Hasa.Further discussion in the volume concerns the flying of the Turkish flag over the fort at Qasr as-Sabaih and the relationship of the Al Bu Ainain with the Turkish authorities. The file finishes with a note (folio 90) that the Al Bu Ainain had come to a private arrangement with the Ruler of Kuwait whereby in return for the payment of a yearly allowance, the Ruler would not encourage Bedouin raiding against the tribe.Included in the volume is a statement (folio 36) of 'Distribution of Garrisons in Hasa, Qatif and Qatar' giving numbers of Turkish troops and supplies at each location.
