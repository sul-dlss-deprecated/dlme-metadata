The correspondence discusses details of advance payments, refunds, and receipts. Also discussed are details relating to a War Subsidy, to be paid from 1 May 1940 onwards for the duration of the Second World War.Most of the correspondence is between the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat and representatives of the Government of Muscat and Oman (namely the Sultan of Muscat and Oman and, later in the file, the Government of Muscat and Oman's Finance Officer). In addition, there is a small amount of correspondence between the Political Agent, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and officials of the British Government of India.The date range of the volume is 1939-1948; however, most of the material dates from 1939 to 1942, and there is no material from the years 1943, 1944 and 1946. The correspondence concludes in 1948 with arrangements for the handing over of responsibility for the Zanzibar subsidy to His Majesty's Government.The Arabic language material consists of letters to the Political Agent from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd], most of which include English translations.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Muscat and Oman, Finance Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Finance</topic></subject><subject><topic>Subsidies</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000384#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000384#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
