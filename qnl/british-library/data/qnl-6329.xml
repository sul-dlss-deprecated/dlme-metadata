No. 63« Dated 13th February 1929 . Your telegram No. 133. I have discussed the question with the Shaikh of Kuwait and he thinks that the information contain ed in my No.62 is almost certainly true and that consequent ly no independent raid by Ibn Hithlain is to be feared in the immediate future. He thinks there will be a raid in a few days time, but that this will be far away from the road to the west where the tribes and their animals are, which is what raiders want. He has withdrawn his own tribes as you .ay,and there is nothing to attract raider, near the road. Moreover there will almost certainly he sufficient time to close the road to cars when it is known that raiders ara actually coming. Under the circumstances he is again allow ing cars to leave for Zubair, which he stopped on receipt of your telegram No. 128. He hopes moreover that they may be allowed to leave Zubair for Kuwait - at any rate mail oars and if possible Kuwait subjects as well. He does not mind about others, and, although he personally considers no such restriction necessary, he is quite ready t. prevent 'Iraq , , m here by car for as long as you liite. subjects froatie ^ nl ^ h the shaikh.

Notwithstanding the raid on 21st January many ‘Iraq tribes are still grazing in Kuwait territory where there is excellent grazing. It would mean s great loss to them to bring them back as the grazing is bad in 'Iraq. Occasional reconnaissanc- .es are being sent by the Air Officer Commanding into Kuwait territory but it is impossible to protect the tribes properly without organizing them. With so many mixed tribes it is im possible to organize them unless Glubb himself visits them, and up to now I have forbidden him to do this, as I do not think the Shaikh^ permission for reconnaissances by aeroplan and armoured cars entitles officials of the ’Iraq Government visiting Kuwait territory. Nor do the A.0#C. or I think that this permission entitles armoured cars to stay with the tribes in Kuwait territory for several days at a time, as Glubb thinks they ought to do. I suggest that that we at once ask the Shaikh of Kuwait for permission for Giubb with his desert police to visit the $Ir*q tribes in Kuwait from tiiae to tiae, and for armoured car reconnaissances to cover a stay of several days at a time with the 'Iraq tribes.

A man in the employ of the Shaikh of Kuwait, believed to be reliable, ebtained information from the Mutair in the Dibdibah that, after U.1 preparations for a bi&amp; combined raid had been made, envoys from Xbn Sa’ud came to Jarab and succeeded in persuading Dawfsh to delay opera tions until the end of Ramadhan. Ibn Sa'ud apparently ure©d that he was at the present moment negotiating with His Majesty’s Government and that any raiding now would greatly damage his chances of bringing the negotiations to a satis factory conclusion. If he failed to do so,it would be a different matter and he would then be with them, and he hoped to know one way or the other by the end of Ramadhan. Whatever Ibn Sa’ud’s actual arguments were, they were successful, as Dawfsh has cancelled all arrangements and returned to irtawiyah with his standard. Ibn Hithlain, Ibn Shuqair and Fuqm, who are now at Umm as-Sudairah, have received an urgent message from Dawfsh not to raid until after the fast, and they too have disbanded their men.

On 12th February P^A,,, Kuwait, reported that Dawish hav ing composed the quarrel in the ’Utaibah tribe had unfurled his standard at Jarao, 55 miles H„E. of Buraidah and had summoned all Ikhwan for a big raid* 2. On 14-th February G-Xubb received a similar report which added that Ibn KumaM was concentrating the ’Utaibah at Ja’lah, 30 miles from Buraidag, for a Jihad. 3. On 15th February PoA., Kuwait, reported that two large raiding parties had started out, one under Ion Hithlain (’AJiaan) which intended to attack the 'Xraq trihee in north Kuwait on 16th, and the second under Dawish which was advan cine, towards the Heutrai hone. N.B. It has since been reported that Ibn Hithlain's party reached the southern Kuwait border but learnt that aero plane patrols were out and postponed the raid and are near Lisafah awaiting, a more favourable opportunity. 4 . In the meanwhile the Mutair, Shamaar &amp; Dhafir sections *M grazing within and to the south of the Neutral Zone, moved rapidly away to the S.E. and 3.W, 3 . On 1?th February Glubb learnt that the Eiutair shepherd! hid received warnings that Dawish and Ion Humaid were in tne Baahuk area and were moving to attack the ’Iraq tribes at Abtiyab about 20th February. Reports from different sources as to Ibn Sa'ud's atti tude to the proposed raid are conflicting, but indicate he has temporarily lost control of the situation.There seems no doubt that the 'AJman, Mutair and 'Utaibah contingents are concentrated within strAking distance of the 'Iraq Kuwait border and are awaiting an opportunity to attack. 1 l 4 ■'Kuwait now reports that Ion S&amp;’ud has persuaded these con tingents to disperse until the end of Raaiadhan, but I con sider it would be advisable to inform Ibn Sa'ud at once of our information and say that HoMo Government are confident he will issue instructions for concentrations to disperse and for the threat of a raid on 1 Iraq to cease* If he has actual ly taken such steps already no harm will be done, and if raids eventuate we shall be in the strong position of having, warned him of the situation and asked him to fulfil his treaty obligations*Telegram (C)* Prom Political, Kuwait, To Admintor, Basrah; repeated to Highcoma, Ho e 64.

After compliments* .vith reference to our several conversations on the sub ject of the closing of the road between Kuwait and Zubalr by the Mutasarrif of Basrah on the grounds that if he declared it open he would be responsible for the security of that part of it which lies within the frontiers of 'Iraq* As Y*E 0 is aware, I telegraphed to the Administrative Inspector, Basrah, to the effect that Y*E* is ready to ^ive an undertaking in writing that you will not hold the Mutas&amp;r- rif of Basrah in any way responsible for the lives and pro perty of Kuwait subjects even in 'Iraq territory if he will allow them to use the road - provided that he close it again if and when Y 0 E„ convey the request through me that this may be done* I told him that Your Excellency's suggestion is that the road be re-opened for Kuwait subjects only, and that, for as long as the Mutasarrif considers it desirable, no one else be allowed to travel on it in either direction without the permission of the permission of the representative of the ceived a reply from the Administrative Inspector, Basrah, in which he says that the 'Iraq. Governmeat accepts Y.E.'s offer as far as It concerns the re-opening of the road for Kuwait subjects. He asks however whether Y.E. will accept respons ibility of other nationalities using the wwi Kuwait portion of the road, and says that he assumes Y.S. will accept the responsibility for the safety of the mall in Kuwait territory whenever it is allowed to leave, and I shall be grateful If Y.E, will kindly let me know what reply you wish me to give country *f which he is a subject* I now* have the honour to inform you/ that I have re to these two points* I venture to give Y.E. my own opinion of the question below, which may be of some assistance to Y.E. in coming to a decision* As regards his first accept responsibility for tards his first question, namely whether Y.E. will ponslblllty for the safety of other nationalities* \ using the Kuwait portion of the road, I presume that Y.E. can make only one answer : namely that as the ’Iraq Government are not prepared to accept the responsibility of the safety of Kuwait subjects in ’Iraq territory, Y»E, will naturally not accept responsibility for the safety of -Iraq subjects in your territory. If on the other hand the 'Iraq Government agree not to hold Y„2. responsible for the safety of 'Iraqis on Kuwait territory, in the same way that Y.E. agrees in respect of Kuwaitis in 'Iraq, I see no reason why they should not be allowed to use the road, but I would suggest that everyone doing so at present should be made to clearly understand that he is doing so at his own risk. In any case I would further suggest that for so long as the present Abnormal condition of unrest lasts, no one esoept Kuwait subjects and 'Iraq subjects - and the latter only if the 'Iraq Government agree on the 'responsibility*' clause - be allowed to s use the road without very special permission. (This would of course nojs apply to R.A.F. officers and men or other British officials, who might be required to travel on the ro^d in the execution of their duty* When the present Abnormal condition of unrest is over, and conditions again become Normal, I of course see no reason why the road should not again be thrown open to all again as in the past, as I presume that then neither nor the Iraq Government will any longer mind accepting tk* responsibility for the safety of travellers in your respective territories. As I understand it this f, responslbility ,, merely means the ordinary responsibility which every ruler or government must inevitably have for the safety of the life and property of all persons living or travelling within his territories. For example Y.E, now doubt feels yourself responsible that no person is murdered in Kuwait or that no house is broken into and roobed if you can reasonably prevent It, ax* but this does not mean that It is your duty to provide every house with a epeoial guard to itself as that would obviously be impossible.Similarly when Y«&gt;.S 0 sent out a party in oars on the 6th Rauindhan recover to txxxnjbcxx&amp;&amp;xgu£ the animals which had been stolen from some Dhaflr near Jahrah, the latter were doubtless very grateful when you were able to restore them, Sven if you had failed to do so, however, neither the owners nor anyone else could have blamed Y*E e , as you had obviously done everything in your power to recover them* Let us therefore consider what the dangers are to which cars using the road in question are liable to be exposed, and how they can reasonably be protected against those dangers 0 There appear to me to be two possible causes of danger, namely (l) robbers, and (2) raiders* (1) Robbers, such as I believe not unfrequently fire on cars on the road from Tanumah to Muhammarah, are certainly a possiol&lt; though not very probable cause of danger on this road.The best protection against this the rifle. The very fact that it be fcnawn that all cars are armed will probably be sufficient to deter such people from trying to hold up carso I think there fore that the original aa custom of all cars of the Kuwait - 'Iraq Motor Transport Company carrying rifles for the use of passengers should certainly be restored* (2) Against a raiding party on the other hand three or four rifles are of little or no use, except for such satisfaction as it would give one to be able to defend oneself in case of extremity, and it is obviously impossible for Y.E. or anyone else to to provide cars with sufficiently strong escorts to be of any real protection to them at all. Cars, however, have the very great advantage of pace, and can easily get away from raiders if they see them in time and realize what they are. Raiders want to plunder sheep and camels, but are not interest- in cars, and there is no fear of them lying in ambush to catch them or interfering with them in any way unless the cars run t tvinlr there is little doubt that when the right into them.

I suggest therefore that a sej. of rules be arawn up and agreed to by both parties for the guidance of the Police at both ends. These might comprise the following:- (,) No car which has not at least one rifle (or such number as may be considered necessary) shall be allowed to leave, unless accompanied by another car which has arms. ( 2 ) No car shall leave unless it have one person in it who holds a valid Kuwait Driving Licence, with a special en- aorsement to the effect that he is 'Qualified to drive in the Desert', or unless it be owned by a Kuwait subject who is himself present; or unless unless it accompany a car -p -fcwM above two qualifications» which fulfils one of tne t** above , i ■% _ a ix 0 wed to leave after 9 o'clock \or (3) No car shall be aiJ-oweu 8 o'clock). , , be fiiowed to leave if it be in an ( 4 ) No car shall be aiio obviously-unserviceable condition.(ac t (5) All passensers who do not know to be warned U } 1 vby s. notice at the control post or such other meads as may be considered necessary) that &amp; certain amount of danger is inevitable on a desert road of this nature, and that they accept this risk when they travel on it* (6) All persons in charge of cars to be similarly warned against approaching suspicious parties, and given to KR&amp;axsixi understand that in the event of the 'Danger' signal being exposed at Jahrah, they are not to proceed further without permission* I think that Y«Ep will agree that if some such rules as these be brought into force, Y*E* need not hesitate to accept the responsibility of again opening the road to all travellers who wish to use it when once the conditions become Normal again* As regards the Mails: personally I consider human lives of more value than mail bags, and I have no doubt that Y 0 E, does too, and that when once conditions become Normal again Y*So will have no hesitation in agreeing to the Mail being despatched whenever the Post Office and the Kuwait - ’Iraq Motor Transport Company wish to do so 8 During the present Abnormal condition however, I am not sure whether Y»IC* will agree to this, without some restrict ion* I would accordingly suggest for YsEo's consideration the desirability of detailing a responsible man to accompany the Mall Car to and from Zubair until Normal conditions are restored* Y„E„, to say nothing of the Company and the Postal Department, would then feel assured that there was a good man in charge of the mail sxx arrangements, who knows the desert thoroughly and could order the driver to return if he saw anything suspicious* Inquiries could be made through the Postmaster at Zubair to the Postmaster here who in turn could inquire from me as to whether any disquieting news had been received, and if it had, he would not start* With an arrangement like this I think that Y*E* need have no hesita tion in agreeing* Y*E* will probable like to consider the whole questionin detull. As this may taKe tims.however, I surest that as soon as you thinK Kuwait subjects might safely be ailowed to travel you will let me know, together with your decision about the subjects of other nationalities, and any special arrangement for the safety of the mail during the present abnormal conditions, and I will telegraph to Basrah. ■U the same time if Y.K. will give the written under taking which you have promised exonerating the Mutasarrif of Basrah from responsibility for the safety of the life and property of Kuwait subjects in the 'Iraq part of the road if ne allow cars to leave, I shall inform the Administrative Inspector that you have done bo 0 YoKo can then consider at leisure what conditions are are necessary for the opening of traffic to all on the restoration of Normal conditions^ Usual ending*Tele&amp;ram From 5fo. i^O e Dated (P).

The Ikhsan are known to have had some wounded. Car patrol saw the bomoing by the aeroplanes and speak most enthusiastically of their work.

One or two rifles are obviously a very 6 ood protection a&amp;alnsi robbers, &amp;nd the very fact of its beln$ known that all oars usinfi the road are armed mifcht in itself deter many such people from at temp tine, to waylay oars. Gars should moreover only use the road during the hours of daylight. c D) * party of r.lOr* on the other hand three or four rifle, are, la the 5h.i*h’a opinion, of no uee whatsoever, and It le oovlouely l.poeelble for him. or anyone elee. to furnish oar. with escort, stronfc enough to(2) • | v brush ratdla* ^ida if they ^re net with.

Hal dare are interested In camels and sheep and notluofc eiee, te.nd there is no Tear of tneir interfering with a car unless it run ri 4 ,ht into Uiea. The Shaikh think* there fore that the best &amp;e&amp;ns of protecting car* against raider* are (1} to have the most efficient machinery possible for aloaln$ the road rapidly on receipt of information that raider* are in the vicinity* and (li) to ensure that no oar travels alone which has not some person In It with a suf ficient knowledge of the Desert to recognise a raiding party if he see* one, and to appreciate at their true value such warnings or Information as he may receive from shepherds or other travellers on the road. As regards ii), the 5h*i£h Is issuing orders to his *-u*ir in Jahrah to stop cars there in the event of hi# receiving information there of an impending raid which bas not yet reached Kuwait, and Is arranging for a special warning signal to be displayed on the fort at J&amp;hr&amp;h in such oases. Had this arrangement been in force on the 21st January the car la which Colonel Watson was travel ling would have been stopped at Jahrah. 6 . The Shaikh accordingly thinks it desirable that a set of rules should be drawn up for the regulation of traffic on his portion of the road,«and wishes me to ask to what extent you would be prepared to co-operate in cringing in a standard set of rules for both. The rules which suggest themselves to hla are $ - H 0 unarmed car shall be allowed to leave, unless it do aosoapartlod by mother our uhlan 1 . waed. jjo oar to be alloeed to leave later than four hours before sunset. ^ 2 ) Ko car to be allowed to leave unless the .river or so.e other pereon la It hold a licence ahowlnft that h. has the requlelte Knowledge of the Deaert, or unless It be accompanied by a oar 'hloh complies '1th this rule. / ^ All persons In charge of cars to understand thatif ths b« flown on Jahrah BV rt« they are to regain rt tho fort, Fnd not proceed further without per mission, i^) passenger to travel by one of the Kuwait - 'Iraq Kotor Transport Joapany's oars without a tiofceiT, ^nd no private oar to travel without a toll receipt froa that ^owpany In respect of the Kuwait portion of the road, on both of which it shall be printed in Arabic and Siicjliah that the holder realises ^nd accepts the rlsKs which he is running.

I h ,ve not had a chance of a peaking to 3aiyid Hamid yet, out of course the whole question of desert transport is rather out of joint at the moment owing to the disturbed state of the country. I hope this will improve however before long, and in any case the 'raiding season” should be over in another month or so. A new difficulty has now arisen, in which I think you c$n help me: a short tine ago, before things were as bad as they are now, the Shaikh of Kuwait wanted his subjects to be allowed to leave Zubair by car before Iraq would declare the road regularly open,on the understanding that he -*ould not nold the Mutasarrif of Basrah responsible in the event of anything happening to them on the ’ Iraq portion of the ro^d. The Administrative Inspector wired to ae and asked if he was right in thinking that if this was agreed to, the Shaikh would accept responsibility for the safety of the mail in Kuwait territory whenever they liked to send It. The word 'responsibility” frightened the Shaikh, and he replied to me that he would never, even when the country wa» normal,accept any responsibility for the mail. Just then the country got more disturbed, and. any question of re-opening th© road had to be postponed, and with It this difficulty, but it wixl orop up again. I have tried to explain to him that as Ruler of Kuwait It is his oovious duty to take such steps as are possible and reasonable to prevent the nudls from being exposed tc any avoidable risk, and in thf* event of mall bags oeing stolen to do hie utmost to recover them and to punish the offender (with which, of course, he agrees), and that this is what I understand by his 'responsibility” for the • • safety of the mail - and not that there could be any question Political Agency, Kuwait. 3th March 1929 .Of his bsias, asked or expected to *ake fe ood the value of Bliil l08t in th * ev ' nt of * robbery taking P i ac , 3a toe road 1 q Ms territory, -Moh is what he 8#9B8 to fsar&gt; If I aa right, will you kindly drop ae a line and say * 0 , that ' iU 1 *“ aUi ' e his aind at rest, as at pre sent he Is only half satisfied.

Office of the Administrative Inspector, In-charge Southern Desert. Adhai^a, dated the 12th March, 1929. Dear ^ Your No. D.O.144/5 of 9th March. I sent for &gt; y &gt; Nasir ibn Kubaih on receipt of your letter. He admits having j\, t* t- ‘ ^' 'V taken a rifle, a hafeh and a flint lock from two men, whose . r names he did not know, but denies the taking of a Lee .unfield / /IX -j ■ - . : •» \ from Dhahir ash Shammari. His excuse in the first case is that the men, whom he did not know, raised their rifles on his approach, abused him as a kafir and said that they were allies of the Muslimin, and would shoot him if he approached. An exchange of abuse ensued, and finally both lost their tempers. I have told him to bring in the articles which he took immediately, and I will send them in to Kuwait. I have received several messages from Bani Malik raided the other day at^ Kuwait, to the effect that a considerable part of their property is with Araibdar. They even say that a number of men of Araibdar were with Ibn Shqair in his attack, and that three mares belonging to Araibdar were killed in the action and their bodies are now lying outside the walls of Kuwait. However that may be, they are positive in their assertions that a considerable part of their property is with Araibdaf. They say that some of them went to see Araibdar to claim their property, but that the latter drove them off and threatened to shoot them. If Bani Malik are right in saying that their property is with Araibdar, it does not of course follow that they were in the raid. On such occasions, a lot of sheep and donkeys always scatter and get lost, and they may merely have rounded these up. In any case, I should be very grateful if you could see the Shaikh about it, and arrange for one of his men, and for the bearer, Muhd al Ataibi, of ours to go with Bani Malik representatives to see Araibdar and to recover anyi ft]) ) 8 In i Political A,fcenaj, Kuwait.

He does not believe Naeir i&gt;ln Kubaih’s version cf ^nat started the quarrel, as hie iaea of course say test Nasir «%as to blame - and proof is not easy either way* he is sending for i Dhatiir ash-Shamaari, to question hia a^ain* The Shaikh says he is quite sure that the ’Uraib&amp;ar have not 6&lt;&gt;t any of the Ban! Malik sheep, as he has already had all all the scattered and lost animals which have been rounded up since the rf»-id handed back to their owners. He simply Jumped at your su^estion of sending one of his men with Muhammad al-Ataibi and representatives of the Ban! Malik to see for themselves whether or not the Hraibdar have &amp;ot any of their things, and said there w^s no thine he would like better than to have this point cleared up.He told off a man and h^d him round here ready to &amp;o almost immedi ately; he has oraered him to help the Bani Malik representa tives xn every way, and to see that they see everything. X do not of course pretend to iooK on the Kuwait *Uraibdar as paragons of virtue, and in /lew of their origin I certainly would not trust them too far, but I would nave been more ready to believe stories of their hrviii£ /^.rticl— pated in the raid if it had not been quite so close to Kuwait. As it is, I think it improbable to say the least of it. But, as you say, they rai&amp;ht have sheep without that, and that pointjtMje* certainly wants clearing up. I I am giving Howes a copy of this.

Please see Glubb's telegram of 10th March to S.B.O,,Kuifait &gt; regarding the 'Uraibdar’s complicity with the Mutair in the raid on the Bani Malik. One can understand the Shaikh’s desire to preserve his own'interests by maintaining a certair degree of neutrality, but in view of his relations with His Majesty’s Government and the fact that he is exempt from paying revenue on his properties in ’Iraq we cannot tolerate his tribes actually conniving at and benefiting from raids on tribes of ’Iraq. I should be grateful if you would dis cuss the situation with him and invite him to take steps to secure the immediate recovery of the plunder still in his territory and to warn his tribes that if they associate themselves with raiders they run the risk of suffering the same udnishment that may be meted out to them. It mi, ,ht help to mention to him that I have not yet mentioned this unsatis factory state of.affairs to His Majesty’s Government, but that unless he can take effective steps to remidy it I shall be forced to do so.Telegram (P), From Political, Kuwait. • To Hi^hcoma, Bagdad; repeated to Bushire. t 60 o Dated Hth March 19d9«, Your tele^am 1*0.29-5» I think the Shaikh of Kuwait certainlj iti trying to prevent his people from ueoomin^ involved in a quarrel with the Mutair by allowing the latter to p : urchase supplies here, etc*, This desire of his may even have influ enced him in deciding* that the raiders were too strong to i take action against when I suggested to him on 3rd March that he might send out a force after them In cars like he did last winter. To allow the 1 Uraibdar to Join in with the Mutalr in raiding an 'Iraq tribe, or to retain plunder taken in such a raid, would of course be a very different matter, and could not be tolerated if true,, Personally, however, I do not believe the accusation. I have a very high opinion of Glubb’s ability, but he is not infallible, and it -would really be strange if there were not rumours of this sort about at tne present ti.i€ when 1 Iraq shepherd tribes are naturally most suspicious of anvone of the Majd type, to which tne Uraibdar Delong. More over there are of course people in Iraq who wou3.d like to see Kuwait made a part of ’Iraq, and it is not inconceivable such persons would fan any such anti-Kuwait rumours for use as propaganda, I do not in any way look on the 'Uraibdar as paragons and I realize that the idea of a raid might well appeal to some of them, as to any other Bedouins, but the Shaikh would never have approved, and they ooula hardly have hoped to take part in the raid without his knowing - par ticularly in oxie so close to the town. I have already* discussed the question with the Shaikh, he ridicules the idea of any of the 'Uraibdar having taken pnrt in the raid, and says that had they done so he would certain lr fcave learnt the fact, and *oulci have ounished .them most drastically. He denies that his tribes have any Oi the plunderplunder now, and says that a certain number of scattered animals ftere collected after the 3rd March, hut that all of these have been handed back to their owners* He absolutely jumped at the surest Ion that he should send a representative with representatives of the Ban! Malik and a man of Glubb’s to see for themselves whether any unsurrendered plunder is with the. 1 Uraibdar or not* He detailed a representative at ax once, and £,ave orders that the deputation was to be &amp;iven facilities for seeing everything* The result of this investi gation should do much to settle the question one or the other.
