I confirm that Jackson should receive the extra salary (£420 per annum (taxable) and allowance(£ 1 25 per annum) from the date he assumed charge as Political Agent, Bahrain, to the date of his relief by Pelly. This is of course on the understanding that the salary of the Bahrain post is available during the whole period. If for instance, Pelly is in receipt of the salary of the post from a date earlier than that on which he takes over at Bahrain, Jackson ceases to be entitled to acting allowance for such period, and may receive the increased foreign allowance only.

INDEXED Please ref -r to Galloway^ Express Lerter No, 16SS-S dated the 15th September 1947 to which no reply has 'yet be*h received, regarding the grant of some extra emol uments to Jackson for the period during which he has been holding charge as Political Agent, Bahrain. 2. Since Galloway represented the matter copies of the Foreign Service Regulations have reached us and I now forward a copy of a representation I have received from Jackson on the subject. 2. Jackson is wrong when he refers to a foreign allowance of £. 1,750 per annum being attached to the post of political Agsnt, Bahrain. This sum was fixed as a personal allowance for Pellj/onlyvregard being had to his seniority etc. It does however contain an element for the Balir: in sumptuary allowance which was fixed at As. 200 a'month under the Government of India, and ^ackson is I think entitled to consideration on this account especially as he has been forced to pay for both the Agency servants and his own Trucial Coast staff. 4 , r would suggest therefore that Jackson should be allowed to draw the difference between his Grade 7 pay (\ SOO oer annum) and the minimum Grade 5 pay (A* 1 : 200 ner annum'.), plus £. 200 per annum for the sumptuary element ii the foreign allowance originally fixed for Pelly, for the period during which he has been holding charge as political As e nt. Bahrain. 5 . i would note that under the Government of India he would have been entitled to further allowances amounting. in all to Rs. 200/- p.m. for holding triple charge as Political Agent, Bahrain, assistant political Agent, Bahrain and Political Officer, Trucial Coast.

Reference correspondence resting rith my memorandum No. 2764, dated the 21st ^ugust, 1947. ince my memorandum ras written I have received a copy of the Foreign Service Regulations and have studied them. 3. According to the second half of paragraph 2 of Regulation No. 1 of Chapter II of the Regulations 'When a Grade 6 post of head of a post abroad or of a department in the Foreign Office becomes vacant, and the salary attaching to that post is available,, an officer of Grade 7 who assumes the full duties of the post may be granted an Acting Allowance to bring his salary up to the minimum of the salary scale of Grade 6 M . I understand that Bahrain has be~n graded as a Gradf 6 post, and the salary attaching to the post would appear to be available because Mr. Pelly is at present on leave preparatory to retirement from the Government of India and has not, during his leave, been drawing a salary from His majesty * s Government'. I am an officer of Grade 7, and have assumed the full duties of the post. I should be grateful if I could be granted an acting allowance to bring my salary up to £ 1200 /- - the minimum of the salary scale of Grade 6 (which has been revised since the current Foreign Service Regulations were published). 4. Your attention is also invited to paragraph 2 read^ with sub-paragraph 1 (b) of paragraph 6 of. Regulation Nc. 3 of Chapter II of* the Foreign Service Regulations. You will observe that in telegram No. 91«_3 dated the 17th July from the Commonwealth -Relations 0 fice, the Foreign Allowance - - ■ - ’ -* • fi attached to the post of Political Agent, Bahrain, was fixed at £1750 per annum, ky permanent post is that of political Officer, Trucial Coast, with a foreign allowance of £ 1075 per annum.

We have looked at this case from the point of view of the Foreign Service regulations, under which our treatment would be somewhat on the following lines. We could regard Jackson as an A.7« officer filling an A.6 post (Head of post) and give him on this account an acting allowance to bring his salary to the minimum of the A.6 scale viz:- £1 ,320 per annum. This would give him an addition £420 per annum (taxable) which works out at Hs. 290 per mensem net. In addition Jackson could have the foreign allowance of the post, but for the purpose of this particular calculation we would be inclined to use the A.6 (single) allowance authorised for Persia rather than the ad hoc figure agreed for Pelly. This would mean an additional £125 per annum for Jackson or an extra Rs. 138 per mensem. You will note that the total thus arrived at approximates to the total of Rs.400 recommended by the Political Resident (Sumptuary expenses were not taken into account in fixing Jackson’s foreign allowance). I would draw attention, however, to the fact that under Foreign Service regulations the acting allowance is payable only while the salary of the post is available that is to say if Pelly is appointed to this post Jackson’s acting allowance will cease as soon as Pelly commences to draw the salary therefore.

J.Gardener, Esq., Foreign Office, 8, Carlton House Terrace, S.W.1. 2 0 OCT 1947 Dear Gardener, enclose a copy of an Express Letter No.1639-3 dated the 15th September, from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf about the Foreign Service and Sumptuary Allowance^of Jackson, Acting Political Agent, V \. I cn-C^ Bahrain. You will see from this that jackson has represented that, from 1£th August, when he came under the Foreign Office, he has held the aual charge of the posts of Political Officer^Trucial Coast ; and Assistant Political Agent t Bahrain ; and that subsequently, from 28th August he also held charge of the post of political Agent Bahrain. Jackson has therefore requested sanction for an increase in his Foreign Service allowance and the payment to him of the sumptuary allowance of Rs.20C/-/- per mensem from the date he took over charge as Political Agent. The Political Resident considers, and we agree, that as Jackson has not been to the. Trucial Coast but has been merely acting in the usual supervisory capacity of the Political Agent, Bahrain, he is not entitled to an allowance for holding charge of the Trucial Coast. For the period that Jackson acts as Political Agent, Bahrain, the Political Resident recommends an increase in his Foreign Service allowance of Rs.20C)/-/- per mensem. This recommendation is based on the analogy of I.P.S. rules whereby an officer of less than nine years service when posted to an appointment classed as superior was entitled to 'a special pay at the rate of Rs.200 per mensem subject to the condition that his basic pay (excluding overseas pay) plus special /jpay shall not exceed Rs.1150 per mensem'. As Jackson's basic pay at I.P.S. rates would have been Rs.950 andhis M Special pay' Rs.2(X)/-/- he would have been entitled to this allowance. Foreign Service allowances to officers in the Gulf were, I think, fixed on the general basis of maintaining nett emoluments at the same levels as existed prior to August 15th and prima facie the Political Resident's recommendation seems reasonable. /\ In addition the Political Resident has recommended an entertainment allowance of Rs.100 per mensem 'if sumptuary expenses at that rate were taken into consider ation in fixing Jackson's Foreign Allowance as Political Officer Trucial Coast; Rs.200 per mensem if they ^vere not'. We are not sure whether the Foreign Service Allowance was calculated so as to include sumptuary expenses and should be grateful if you would enlighten us on this. In the light of the circumstances explained we should be glad to know how far you support the Political Resident's recommendations with a view to Treasury approval being sought. Yours sincerely.

Jackson has represented that from August 15th when he came under the Foreign Office he held charge of the post of Political Oificer, crucial Coast, and of Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, as well, ana that from Ranee’s departure on August.28th he filled the post of Political Agent, Bahrain, he in addition to the two posts previously mentioned and he requests a supplement to his Foreign Allowance. He also asks for the Sumptuary Allowance hitherto attached to the post of Political Agent, Bahrain, viz. Rs.200/- per mensem. 2. My own view is that as Jackson has not been to the Trucial Coast his charge there is only nominal, and that until he goes there he is merely acting in the _ supervisory capacity of Political Agent, Bahrain. He ±0 therefore not entitled to any increase in his Foreign . Allowance on that account. 4. For the period that Jackson acts as Political Agent, Bahrain, I recommend the following increases in his Foreign Allowance: (a) For the additional responsibility Rs.200/- /*er mensem. This is on the analogy of an I.P.S. officer in an inferior post acting in a superior post. (b) For the heavier entertainment expenses at Bahrain than at Sharjah Rs.100/- per mensem if sumptuary expenses at that rate were taken into consideration in fixing Jackson's Foreign Allowance as Political Officer Trucial Coast; Rs.200/- per mensem if they were not. 5 . The fact that the post of assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, is not filled by a separate ofiicer naturally throws a heavier burden on the Political Agent. In view, however, of the increases recommended in paragraph 4 above'I do not recommend any further increase on this account. Sd/- A.C.

The Persian Gulf* will become more - not less - important after the war, when the great oil reserves on the Arab littordl are developed, and the world's air traffic crowds along it. So I would ask Sir Geoffrey Prior to consider this point again, after hearing what the G. of I. have to say. This is long-term, there may even be much to be said for more kilowatts at Bahrein. Qtherrhi n, I agree that no short-term purpose wr’ll be served at this phase of the war, by ad hoc publicity from Bahrein by an inadequate successor to Bertram Thomas* 0. Caroe. 17*11.43Mr, C&amp;roe Ox- y, woJ (£; ; cv^&lt; 2 iU mO ''t &gt; O- Have you any comiients? I alv;ays have felt a little doubt whether we were getting full value for our money, but Bertram Thomas had such special qualifications that he was obviously in a position to exercise a considerable influence by his own personal contacts, and he was probably worth it. Now that he is no longer available and the war situation has changed so much in our favour, I think that Prior’s proposals are soun and will provide all that is necessary. 16/11^ INDIA OFFICE, Sxt,616^/43 CcSVV ^ o WHITEHALL, LCM)(.N, S.W.1 22nd November, 1943• Dear iiiss Monroe, I enclose for ease of reference, a copy of telegram No.T/1077 from the Political Resident in the Per si an Gulf, of which a copy has already been sent to the Ministry of Information officially, on the subject of a successor to Jstr.Bertran Thoses as Pub] ic Relations Officer in the Persian Gulf. We have not of course seen a copy of the Ministry’s letter of the 22nd October to Mr- Bertram Thomas, and should be glad to have the Ministry's oenments on this telegram. The only observation which we have to make ourselves at this stage is that we are inclined to doubt the desirability of closing down the Bahrein radio* Bahrein is I think about the only place in the Arab world from which we can directly put out propaganda in Arabic, a consideration which would seem to give Bahrein a clear advantage over such outside centres as London or Delhi. Tours sincerely, (3gd.) R. FSSL Miss E. Monroe, Middle East Division, Ministxy of Information. Copy to:- Foreign Office.Mr.Peel (Intld.) R.T.P.

The functions of the Public Relations Officer in the Persian G-ulf are described in the note flagged X. Sanction to the appointment of the first incumbent of the post together with the financial term# involved are given in the telegram flagged at PZ.31&amp;L/40. X The post seems to depend for its effect very much on the personality of the holder and if no one suitable is available, there seems a lot to be said for the Political Resident’s proposal now to abolish it and to transfer the residue of its functions to the charge of the Political Agent, Bahrein. The post is of course at present paid for by the Ministiy of Information and the holder's activities are subject to their general control, though of course so far as local issues are involved, he is, I imagine, in practice guided by the advice of the Political Resident. If under the revised arrangements suggested by the Political Resident the Ministry of Information are to continue to bear the cost of £ 2,000 a year still involved, they would naturally require some corresponding control. I should not however think that it would be impossible to devise a method of securing this. We might, as a first step, ask the Ministry of Information for their observations on the Resident's telegram.

Dated Bahrain, 8 th November, 1943. Received 01.00 hours, 9th November, 1943. T/1077 . Addressed to London, repeated to Minister of State Cairo for Ministry of Information Government of India New Delhi 'Saving'. ! I see frorrf Ministry of Information letter REFB3/2 dated 22nd October to Bertram Thomas that they have no one in mind to succeed him. We can find no one and I therefore make the following proposals- &amp;. Present (*? budget) of Public Relations Officer amounts to about £S ,000 per annum, (exclusive of heavy telegram charges in Cairo and London) which is considerably greater than the total pre war cost of Bahrain Agency. Though with German bombers in Baghdad and then later the threat to Cairo and Caucasus we could obviously hegloci no weapon to maintain morale I doubt very much if such expenditure can now be ^u'stifiod. 3. Bortram Thomas had particular qualifications for this post which his successor, however gifted; cannot inhex'it. He had great name in the Gul;f and was persona gratissiraa with all Rulers and merchants and key note of his.policy was frequent occasion to contact with them. His successor however must mainly rely on artificial means such as Bahrain newspaper, Bahrain radio and cinema instead of personal approach. 4. Shipping restrictions have made it increasingly difficult to visit Kowoit which can bo better supplied from Basra and recent sinking of bahpu in Muscat harbour has reduced sailings to minimum so that Muscat is almost cut off. I do not foe! that in present state of war when Arabs have made up their* minds about the winner expenditure of £8,000 per annum by newcomer on Bahrain and Trucial Coast can be justified. 5. We are now well served by Arab broadcasts and I do not consider Bahrain Radio (though useful) is essential and (?attach) still less affect to newspaper Al Bahrain which could be partially replacedffl •* 2 ^ roplaeod by suitable articles in subsidised Basra paper. Papers and pamphlets which are found useful could be sent from Cairo or Baghdad. Cinema has however definite value . and should be retained as adjunct to Agency which would maintain nucleus of publicity organisation which could be stepped up again if situation deteriorates. 6 . x therefore recommend that present Public Relations Office should be wound up except for cinema which should be, attached to agency. Most of staff could be released sufiici' nb being retained to enable Political Agent to carry extra charge. I estimate this could be done for maximum of £ 2,000 per annum thereby saving £16,000. If suggestion is accepted in principle I will make concrete proposals. I would be glad early orders as present publicity programme is heavy burden on Agency. 7*n I 5515 ! S43 ' 0 .

Alban was appointed last October after full consideration. He has done very well and is much liked by Arabs and jOersians and gets on well with Oil Company and Navy. Though he did not seem very robust on arrival he appears to thrive on heat and is fitter now than when he came. The bad feeling which existed last year vide my letter No. 556-S of 30th July 1^40 has almost entirely disappeared and though war has come very close to Bahrain situation is greatly improved and Alban must receive full credit tor this. 3. I have no doubt Wakefield is an able officer in India buo unfortunately he knows nothing whatever aoout Gulf and still less about Arabs and Persians. Weightman failed to qualify in Arabic and there is nothing to show Wakefiela will be more successful. You will see from life of Cox now under publication euat action of Government in postirg unqualified officers to these waters ms been subject ad verse criticism for many years. Without a 14-uent knowledge of the language and a genuine affection xox* Arabs it is impossible to make those personal contacts which are the sole basis of successful political w©rk» and on which our position here entirely depends. When Weightman was appointed in 1^37 Fowle raised strongest possible objections^ I consider they were fully justified and with object lesson ofHsraq before our eyes I feel it would be impossible to justify another such appointment especially in war time.2 X 4. I think Wakefield will corne to the Gulf too late in his career to make a success of it hut if he is willing to begin Arabic at once and to spend the cold weather in Kuwait on language study I would be prepared to take a chance with hiin in the spring provided he at least passes the Preliminary iirabic* You are probably aware that the Arabian Mission consider two years the minimum training ior their probationers (who only learn Arabic). I should be most reluctant to place an officer in charge of an Agency with less and would only agree to it under pressure from you and against my better j udgement• 5 . as regards the suggestion that ^xlban after oeing demoted might fill some unspecified post in Bahrain I nedd only say that Hickinbotham who was badly treated in 1937 felt his position very keenly and immediately applied for a transfer. Alban on being replaced by an unqualified junior would I feel sure do likewise. In fact if such an appointment were made no officer in the Gulf would feel secure and I doubt if anyone would be willing to come forward and spend months of study and hazard his health if he was liable to such humiliation through no fault oi his own. - resident -Telegram % rt From Government of Indiam, Simla. To lolitical He sident, Bushire* No. 3667 Bated 19th received 21st July 1941. 5004 19 41 j W Your telegram T/252 of 7th July. Wakefield. 2. After full consideration of all factors and of your arguments Viceroy is satisfied that Wakefield should be posted to Bahrain vice Alban. Wakefield himself is anxious to go first to Kuwait on special duty to learn some ^rabic and this goes some way towards disposing of your main argument. Exigencies of war may make it impossible for him to spend more t an two of three months in Kuwait but even this will be of appreciable value. 3. Government of India do not accept your statement of cases of weightman and Kickinbotham or the deduction you seek to draw from them and Viceroy expects you to show a wider a preciation of problems on personnel dide. Owing to limited number of posts they cannot build up from the bottom an entirely self contained Gulf cadre and it is from time to time both necessary and politic to enliven it by introducing fresh b&amp;ood in middle stages. This policy moreover meets your own repeated demands for relief of Gulf officers either by leave or transfer for sake of their health, and* strong oppoistion to its implementation in the matter of individual postings leads only to avoidable fx’iction and detriment to public- business. 4 . if Wakefield can be made available within month Government of India would normally post him to Bahrain■VS r - 2 - any time after October^ITovemberbut date dependent on development 3 . As regards consequential changes your views are requested as to filling up Kuwait and Muscat with Alban Hickinbotham and Howes available e Political A&amp;encies being superior and very important posts. Viceroy has no doubt you will extend your full confidence to wa£eiie xa. - FOREIGN -3665* In anticipation of demands for supply of qualified officers for special employment we have decided to strengthen Persian Gulf cadre introducing now fresh blood, in middle stages* Bahrain offers best opening for Political Agent with strong administrative background and it is accordingly proposed to send there B.B.Wakefield?
