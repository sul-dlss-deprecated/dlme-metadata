Its chief office vas tliat it was pro* Russian, but its corruption caused universal discontent. But the combined efforts of the British and Russian Uinistars kept it in being until it had (by exchange of Notes) accepted an agreecannt providing for the formation of a British and Russian force in the south and north respectively, for Rusao-Britiah control of the finances, and for a subsicfy of tomans 400,(100 a csonth during Uie ear. Sarly in Au^st the Shah dismissed the Sipah Salar, and declined to leave the capital vith the British and Russians if the Turkish advance from Kerman shah should make it necessary for them to leave. The military crisis, however, subsided, and at the end of the month the Vossufch~ed*Dowleh succeeded in forming a Government, with himself as Foreign Minister. Th^T Government is still in eiistenoe, and on the whole has proved fairly amenable. It is true that it denied all knowledge of the agreement concluded with its predecessor, and declared that the Notes had been lost. Negotiations were, however, opened as to the mt*ans for giving effect to it and are •till in process * the stumbling block being the question of financial control. But in spite of obstructions and evasions the leraian Government tav* acquiesced in the formation of a foroe (to be incorpore a ted in the Persian anny and to number 11,000 men) by Sir 1 ercy Sykes, and it has supported the provincial Govemors-General in their pro*British attitude. If it has not moved more rapidly, and if it has asked for impossible 'assurances* in order to make the agreement more palatable to the public, it is because its own position is very precarious; and Sir C. Marling constantly warns as that any day may see its collapse.In Southern Paroift the aitu’ition at the b*f#nninr of August *'18 briefly aa follows:- I spahan was occupied by about QOC Russian troops; H.M.Consul-fianaral and th*&gt; British Community had returned in May from th»ir axils at Alivas; Yamin-sa-Bultansh was OoTamor Oanaral, pandiiur the arrival of tho Zil; and a number of prominsnt Gannan agitators wars bsin^ harboursd by some of the Bakhtiari Khans, notably the Zarpham-es-Sultaneh. The Turkish advance from Kermanshah and ill*- attitude of theieKhans, were causing anxiety, and early in September it was considered necessary to divert to Ispahan Sir F. Sykei* with his escort of Indian troops, who was on his way to Shiras. He arrived on 11th September and left fwnkin on 2tth October the military situation having eleared in the meantime. The political situation was complicated by the defection of some of the Ilb»fd (Aminri-Hujahid) and some of , the younger Bakhtiari Khans, and by the ill-will that existed between the Bakhtiaris as a whole and the Zil , who took up the Governor Generalship on October 18th, and by the fact that the latter is entirely under Hussian influence - so that a tendency to hostility between the Russians and the Bakhtiaris was thus induced. The Russian military authorities more than one® threatened to send an expedition apninst the Bakhtiaris, for which the disturbed state of the country on their eastern border afforded some excuse. In order to remove this excuse, to streivrthen the hands of the loyal khans, and to keep the road open, it has been decided to form a small force of Bakhtiari gendarmerie under British officers, which will eventually be incorporated in the South Persian Rifles. The disloyal Ilbegi has been got rid of and replaced by Sirdar-i-Jang, who has served us sufficiently well in the pest. The uncertain attitude of the Bakhtiari has naturally caused some anxiety as to the security of the oil-fields, and the power of the Khans to carry out the agreement which they signedAt the bepinnin^ of Au^ruat Shiraz was atill without a British representative, H.M.Consul and the male members of the British Community beinp still in prison at Ahram and the road from Bushire to Shiraa blocked by the rebel Khans. The Acting Governor General had arrested the German party and the Indian seditionists, but the whole political situation depended on the precarious friendship of the notoriously shifty Soulet-ed-Douleh, Ilkhani of the Kaahgai, with the young Qawara, who had not his father* s strength of character. The Governor General, Farman Farraa and Lieut. Col. Gough, H.k.Consul, were on their wa y via Ispahan, and on arrival at Abadeh at the end of September were met by a message from the Soulet that they would not be received at Shiras. This difficulty was got over, and the party arrived on October 13th, were followed by Sir P. Sykes on November 12th. The Soulet did not wait to welcome them, and hi* hostility to the present rigime is ill-disguised. Eighteen notorious European agitators, mostly Germans, 30 Austrian rank and file, and Turks and about a doien Indians were taken over by the Governor General but 3 Germans have since escaped. The arrival of Sir P. Sykes unfortunately coincided with a shortage of supplies owing to general crop failure, and the discontent due to the latter cause is being exploited by the democrats against the British and the pro-British Governor General and ia the principal factor in the situation in Shiraz itself. ? T .tt.G. tiave taken steps to reduce prices and to import wheat. Sir P.Sykes has taken over the remainder of the former Swedish gendarmerie, numbering about 2300 men, and, with hi* own escort, commands (in the name of the Persian Government) a force of some 3000 men: reinforcements ar* under despatch from Bunder Abbas. Outside Shiraz the main seats of trouble are on the Bushire road, and in eastern Fare, where the Qawam is engaged in operations againste) against the Baharlus. On the Bushire road there is little doubt that the Soulet is at the back of tbe rebellious Khans; but until Sir P. Sykes is sufficiently strong to move out in force, clear out the rebels, and put in nominees of the Farman Farma, there is little hope of restoring order; and meantime it is feared that the migration of the tribes in the spring may cause serious disturbances. Bushire . Here the political interest in August centred in the question of securing the release of the British colony at Ahram. This was effected in the course of the month without making undue concessions to the rebel Khans, who, isider the influence partly of the democrats and partly of the German Wassmuss (who is still at large), maintain their contumacious attitude. The hiph military authorities are grilling to allow the British force at Bushire to occupy th^ hinterlmd • a measure which, from the political point of view, is most desirable. Until this is done, the Shiras road remains at the mercy of the Khan of Borasjan; but of itself it will not suffice for the re-opening of regular trade with Shiras, which can only be effected by operations from Shiras itself* K^naafl . The German caaipaigjn collapsed in April, when the Acting Governor arrested tne whole of the party • 11 officers qqd 30 Austrian soldiers. Sir P. Sykes had arrived in June, but left again in July for Shiraz. The situation x* seemed secure, but was almost immediately upset by the rescue, on the Kerman - BunderAbbas road, of 3 of the prisoners who were being sent to India. Suoultaneousxy II.H. Consul, Isajor Lorimer, was attacked on his way up from the coast, but reached Kerman safely on July 23rd. Since that tuition -k.n n^rman itself has remained fairly quiet, but the prisoners are still at largo, and their activity among the tribes makes it necessary to keep a force at Saidabad. A telegraph line is under construction from Bunder Abbas to Kerman, and surveys tor a toad are in progress.S wiatmi.

From this very brief outline it will be seen that the situation is everywhere in the hiidiest degree anjfcible. The governing fact is that the Turks are occupying 3t.,( ( ( &lt; sq. miles of Persian territory forming a wedge b-tween Uie Hus inn and British theatres. That they have no intention of withdrawing until the pressure elsewhere becomes overwhelming may be regarded as certain for two reasons Fir 2 t becaiise the occupation gives hem a pawn for negotiation. Ur^nd. becfiuse the history of the war has shown them how weak our position is and 1»w greatly it is possible to embarrass us. At the beginning of August last year the aliiod l“&lt;-&gt;g-ions were within an ace of leaving Tehran.

The decocratic party, w ich the Oeraamhave used as their tool (while it has been believing that it was using the Germans) is still active beneath the surface, emissaries from Constantinopis are at work, and lioslem hatred of Russia extends to her ally.

The report is divided into sections using headings, which cover the following locations: Tehran, Ispahan, Fars, Bushire, Kerman, Seistan and Khorassan.The report discusses the threat posed to Britain's position in Persia, mainly by Turkish troops, but also by tribal groups which are reportedly under the influence of German agitators.The report states that the Persian Government has acquiesced in the formation of a force [South Persia Rifles] commanded by Sir Percy Sykes, which will be incorporated into the Persian army and will amount to 11,000 men.The report concludes that the situation across Persia is 'in the highest degree unstable', with Turkish forces occupying 30,000 square miles of Persian territory.The report is followed by a cutting from the
