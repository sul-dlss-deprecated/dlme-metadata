Hickinbotham, Political Agent, Bahrain. a . r • n ix • s 0 Your kind letter No.42 of 1944, dated 3rd April 1944 (10th Rabi al Thani 1363) has been received in which you say that you received a letter from Shaikh of Qatar regarding his son Shaikh Ali who is seriously ill and requires operation in the Mission hospital. You said naturally in the cause of hum a nit yQ_a greed. I inform that I do not like his coming to my State Bahrain and his meeting me. This is a cfuious matter. I consider his entry into my State is a-kind of compulsion against-me in my State and I do not approve of his entry nor his interview by me. As he is the son of Shaikh of Qatar and he does not address us with information about the urgency of the required case, we therefore find that his entry is not to our interestt TJ.E. BWBConfidential. D.O. C/690-9A. Bahrain, April 4, 1944 . His Highness received your letter about Shaikh Ali of Qattar when he came to my office with Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa. He had already been told by the Qattar emissary that Shaikh Ali wished to come here, because he was suffering from chest trouble, there was no mention of an operation. He does not believe that Shaikh Ali is really seriously ill and he thinks it is another 'try on' as was the case with Hamad bin Abdullah, he knows that Hamad bin Abdullah, when it came to the point, did not need medical attention. He cannot understand why you did no.t consult him in the matter yesterday afternoon, knowing that you would be leaving here today. He said that if Shaikh Abdullah had written directly/ to him saying that his son was really ill he would not have refused to admit him here. He thinks the whole affair is an attempt on the part of the Al-Thani to show' the world that they can go in and out of Bahrain as much as they like and that he, His Highness, has no authority in his own country. He feels that the matter will be regarded in this way by all Arabs. He said that neither he nor his father or grandfather had ever been forced to admit to their country a person with whom they were on such terms as now exist between him and the Qattar Shaikhs. He then discussed what action should, be taken. Ac cording to Arab custom if Shaikh Ali goes to his house he cannot refuse to see him and this he determined notnot to do 2 He believes that Shaikh Ali, in spite of everything, will try and gain entry to his mailis. It is for this reason that he has written to you say ing that he does not wish to meet him. Shaikh Abdullah and I both assured him that we did not think Shaikh Ali would ^orce himself on His Highness if he was told that His Highness does not want to receive him. His High ness wishes you to inform Shaikh Ali that he does not wish to be visited by him. He also proposes leaving Rafaa and going on a hunting trip, possibly to his island v/here he could not easily be pursued. He does not think that Shaikh Ali will stay in the hospital but expects that he will try and borrow a house in the town from the Kanoo or Pakhroo family so that he can adver tise his presence here. His Highness stayed, discussing the matter, for over three hours. Shaikh Abdullah was in full agree ment with His Highness r sentiments except that he be lieved that if Shaikh Ali was told that His Highness did not wish a meeting then he would not force one. The occasion was inopportune for any talk about the letter to you on the subject of Zubara, in fact *if I had suggested it today I think any progress that we have ma.x'de in the matter would have been retarded. I have never before seen His Highness so strongly moved. 2 ^ Major T. Hickinbotham, C.I.'S. , O.B.E. , H.B.M T s Political Agent,D # G. No•C/593. 7th April 1944. My dear Belgrave, Please refer to your D.O, letter No.C/690~9A dated April 4th, 2. I am enclosing for your information a copy of the letter which I received from the Shaikh of Qatar. I was Informed by Abdui* Rahman al Darwish that Shaikh Ali was suffering from stomach trouble and that it was thought that an operation would be necessaiy I am unaware of what statement was made by the same emissary to His Highness. 3. As far as I know Shaikh Hamad did not ask to come to Bahrain for treatment. He asked for a dentist to be sent to doha or for arrangements to be made for him to visit Dhahran. Perhaps you will make this clear to His Highness. Shaikh Hamad was suffering from an abscess in a tooth which had apparently burst v/ith the resultant relief from pain by the time the dentist was able to reach him. You may have possibly had a similar experience yoursel 4. I did not inform His Highness before granting permission for Shaikh Ali to come here for urgent medical treatment because it has been the practice since May 6th 1942 for the Political Agent to exercise his own discretion. Please see paragraph 2 of your memorandum NO.80E/15 dated May 6th 1942 in this connection. The Shaikh of Qatar was of course informed of this arrangement and owing to His Highness* attitude during the last few years would naturally have not written personally to him. In view of the rani: of the individual concerned I took the first opportunity of inform- \ ing His Highness of the position. | 5. I do not presume for one moment that Shaikh Ali will adempt to call on His Highness and I will arrange that he is acquainted with His Highness* desire that he should not do so. £&amp;lrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., /uith Adviser to the Goveniment of Bahrain.With regard to Shaikh All living out of the hospital, I an given to understand that the hospital is full at present and that if an urgent operation is necessary it may be desirable for him to be moved to a house in the town as soon as the operation is over to make room for other sic?c persons. If Shaikh Ali is not in urgent need of attention he will be advised to return to Doha. 6. I confess I read your letter under reference with con siderable astonishment. In view of His Highness* repeated, and I had presumed genuine, expression of his desire for the t reestablishment of friendly and neighbourly relations with Qatar and the humane custom of all the Arab peoples whereby succour to the sick and wounded is never refused even in time of war I find His Highness* present attitude inexplicable. Yours sincerely,Translation of letter dated 16th Rabi al Than! 1363 (9-4-44) from the Shaikh of Qatar to Political Agent, Bahrain I have received your kind letter No.41 of 1944, dated 3rd April 1944 (ICth Rabi al Than! 1363) in which you have said there is no objection to Shaikh Ali coming for treatment, but I have been astonished to receive latter your letter No.C/291 of 7th April 1944 (146h Rabi al Than! 1363) revoking what you had said and saying 'the son Ali should not visit Bahrain for treatment and so on”. It does not matter. Ali can go to \ some other place for treatment, but this disturbs the friendly relations between Bahrain and Qatar, which are on the verge of being cleared up. I shall be grateful if you will kindly make it clear to me the reasons which have prompted you to rescind your statement and change your word. As regards your kind enquiry about the illness of the son Ali and that you will send a doctor if necessary, please accept my thanks for your kind attention and good cooperation. All’s condition has not reached that stage. I thank you and appreciate your good attention.I ii0®I On the afternoon of the 3rd of April a letter arrived from the Shaikh of Qatar asking permission for his son Shaikh Ali to come to Bahrain for medical treatment. The bearer of the message Abdur Rahman bin Darwish informed me that Shaikh Ali was Suffering from internal trouble and wished to be operated upon. He stated that Shaikh Ali was seriously ill. 1 I spoke to the Adviser on the telephone who said that he was not at all sure what views His Highness would take of the matter and I informed him that I considered that in humanity His Highness could not refuse to permit a seriously ill man coming to Bahrain for medical treatment. That being so I thought that the best line to take to prevent delay and unpleasantness would be to exercise the right which the Shaikh had given to the Political Agent of permit ting sick persons to land provided they were ps the bearers of a letter from the Shaikh of Qatar. The Adviser did not disagree but he signified that he would prefer not to express an opinion and if questioned by the Shaikh proposed to know nothing of Shaikh Al^s visit. I informed the messenger that I would give him a letter the next morning and on his calling at 8 a.m. on the 4th of April he duly received a letter to the Shaikh of Qatar stat ing that there will be no objection to his son coming for treatment. Within half an hour of handing over the letter I ^ left for Sharjah by air and was surprised to receive a telegram from the Assistant Political Agent indicating that His Highness* reaction had been extremely violent. On my return I found waiting for me q letter from the Adviser and from the Shaikh himself and learnt from the Adviser that the Shaikh was extremely upset. On the afternoon of my return (6th April) I met His highness at the School sports but was unable to have any private conversation with him but I arranged to call on him on the morning of the 7th. On the 7th I explained the position to His Highness anav said that I was surprised that he should object to a sick man whatever his standing coming to Bahrain for medical treatment and that I had granted the permission thinking no doubt that His Highness would have been in agreement had I mentioned the matter to him previously and as the individual concerned was a member of the Shaikh of Qatar's family I have been at pains to inform him immediately of his possible arrival. I drew his attention to the custom which had his full sanction by which the Politbal Agent . . authorised persons to land for medical treatment and I explained that I was not at the time I granted this parti cular permission aware that it was customary to consult His Highness when the sick person was not in fact present and the letter was merely a request for permission to come and not an announcement that the individual had in fact arrived. I drew his attention to the fact that even though a state of war existed between two Arab countries it was the invariable custom for requests for medical as sistance for sick persons from one side t6 the other to be granted. His Highness who was obviously very much upset stated that he did not consider that he could remain at Haffa if Shaikh Ali came to Bahrain but that he would have to go to his shooting camp. He held forth for some time i muck on the line of the letter he had written and nothing I could say would persuade him to alter his view but he did say that should iatar come to an agreement with Bahrain he would then open his doors wide and then he would have no objection to any of the family coming whenever they liked. He discoursed for some time on the Bahrain Qatar question and eventually I suggested that I would endeavour to sent a message to the Shaikh of Qatar advising that his son do not come until such time as the relations between the two countries were more amicably and if the Shaikh of Qatar considered it necessary ta I would endeavour to send a doctor to examine Shaikh All. It was further decided that should Shaikh Ali arrive he would be kept in the launch until the doctor had examined him and that our future ■■ct-'onwould depend upon the doctor's decision. If he was * in fact in need of urgent medical attention I would communicate with His Highness but if he was not then he should return to Qatar. His Highness was considerably « relieved at this decision.© @ Translation of letter dated 3rd Jamad auv/al 1363 (26th April 1944) from Shaikh of Qatar to the Political Agent, Bahrain. 0 ) I have received your letter Ho.49 of 1944, dated 13th April 1944 (20th Rabi al Than! 1363) and been surprised of khat you have said therein. I do not submit'.that what you said is a natural thing and beyond my thought although there were other reasons which changed your mind. Hadtthe reason been as what you said, it was not a cause to change the (your) word, other?/ise it would have been explained r in your previous letter but in this mariner you realize it. I informed you that the son Ali was able to have himself treated in any other place and there was no cause or thing requiring you to ask for favour as stated by you, and also I do not find any reason which requires asking for a. favour As regards wjiat you say that I use the key which is in my hand and open the door. This is a stranger thing. You are ■ i well aware that I am not the one who closed the door and carry its key, If you think,you will find that the key is in the hand of the one who closed the door, and he has to open it if he wants.

Shaikh is extremely worried about the Zubara position owing to his desire to send his followers and flocks to graze in Qatar. It is very probable that a considerable portion of the area for the new landing ground will be found to be His Highness*s personal property as opposed to Bahrain Government property. Therefore I think it desirable to bring about the withdrawal of the guards from Zubara as soon as possible. 3. I suggest you instruct me to visit Doha to inspect personally rationing arrangements which the Shaikh states he has introduced and report whether the organisation is satisfactory and our and his peoples* interests can be safeguarded without insisting on blockading or rationing. Provided I was satisfied with food position the immediate withdrawal of the guards from Zubara could be an unofficial condition of my reporting favourably. - POLITICAL - \ R.M.Telegram S(Pad).
