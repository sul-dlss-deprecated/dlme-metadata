Memorandum: - The reckless driving of many of the service vehicles in Bahrain is causing concern to the police and the Municipal authorities. In spite of numerous traffic notices indicating dangerous corners and speed limits within municipal areas service cars drive through the streets and across the causeway and Shaikh Hamad bridge at excessive speed. It has been reported to me by the Police on point duty that service vehicles disregard their signals. It is difficult for the police to in dent if y the vehicles as many of them have a quantity of different numbers on them on various parts of the body. I am asking the Municipality to repaint road signs and am giving orders to the police to endeavour to indentify cars which are travelling at too great a speed and I should be ..rateful if you could request the service authorities to warn their drivers that speed regulations must be observed.

DANGEROUS DRIVING File: 220. PA-112 H. B. M*s. Political Agent, The Agency, Manama, Bahrein. t r We thank you for your letter of August 19th — your No. 2357-16/11 — calling to our attention the increased number of fatal accidents and collisions on the Island due to the increase in traffic. We have warned all drivers that Govern ment driving regulations must be adhered to at all times. We wish to point out that no personnel in our employ are permitted to drive any type of vehicle without first pro curing a driver's license with the exception of learners who have been granted the privilege of driving under the supervision of experienced men for the period of breaking in only. Learners are not permitted to drive in heavily congested areas. We agree that you should institute prosecution in all cases of dangerous driving or driving in excess of the posted speed limit. It is our recommendation that the Government post more speed limit warnings in spots where they may be easily seen by all. For your information we are attaching a copy of a letter we are sending to the State Engineer, Mr. G. E. Hutchings. This letter is in answer to his of the 16th of August in which it was suggested that the Company delegate one of its personnel to be used as a Government Traffic Authority Officer in conducting tests and issuing licenses to Company drivers. We believe our answer is self-explanatory in that we are anxious to cooperate in all ways with the Government to insure safe driving on the Island; however, we do not, in any way, wish to interfere with or interpret practices that should and must be established by the Government as the basis for the issuance of driving licenses to applicants. The large increase in automobile and truck traffic on the Island has undoubtedly contributed to the increase in the accident rate. We are cognizant of this fact and are doing everything in our power to employ properly trained personnel who will adhere to local Government regulations. Chief Local Representative, THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITEDAugust 26, 1944* Mr. G.S. Hutohings, State Engineer, Heavy Vehicle Driving Teats. Bahrein Island. Dear Sir: Reference your letter of 16th August, 1944, No. BPC/57/63, concerning the increase in the number of road accidents, and the exercise of more thoroughness jin con ducting tests of applicants for driving licenses. We agree that the tests should be thorough and should test the applicants' ability to correctly drive under all circumstances. We do not favor the appointment of one of our staff personnel as a temporary Government Officer with authority delegated by you for issuing driving licenses, since we are very short of manpower, and find it extremely difficult to •pare an employee for this work, and the Company is reluctant to take on the responsibility of interpreting Government standards regarding driving tests. The Company is desirous of assisting all possible toward the promotion of good standards of driving on the Island. In many oases we do not employ holders of driving licenses seeking work, because they do not meet the standards established by the Company, which we consider essential for the protection of our personnel and equipment. It is be lieved that our greatest assistance in this problem can be exercised by continual rigid training of applio nts for licenses before inaking application to you for oertifioataa. It is anticipated that the number of applicants sent to you for driving tests should diminish in the future since the Company has largely filled its need for drivers.

Bahrain Receipt #*~lU.Z.D ata The Bahrain Senior Court on Monday last heard ' two cases concerning collisions between lorries carrying workmen employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and by a contractor employed by the Bahrain Petroleum Company in which altogether four men lost their lives and a number of men were injured, some seriously. 2. Certain points were revealed from the evidence of the witnesses and the drivers which in the opinion of the Court should be brought to the notice of the Company: (a) In one case the driver of a lorry who was proved responsible for an accident stated that he had been on duty, driving, for 15 hours. The Court arrived at the conclusion that he wad'asleep on his seat. He informed the Court that although overtime driving was optional yet in fact no driver could refuse to work overtime when required to do so by the Company. I should like to know whether the Company has' any regulations on this subject. (b) One of the accidents took place on the Awali-Sitra road. Though the Police were informed at once and proceeded to the scene of the accident as quickly as possible when they reached the place they found that both^ the lorries had been removed by orders of Company officials and it was therefore impos sible for the police to provide a satisfactory report to the Court showing the position of the vehicles and the wheel trdcks etc. Owing to the lack of this essential information and the fact that there were no witnesses in one of the lorries, apart from the driver, the Court is faced with great difficulty in deter mining the responsibility for this accident.(c) Three out of the four vehicles involved in these two accidents carried only one light. 3. I am fully aware of the present day difficulties over transport and of the need to utilise all trans port for works of wartime importance and it is realised that the Company is* not niggardly in paying full compensation for the injuries and deaths of persons in the Bahrain petroleum Company employmoat but at the same time I feel it is incumbent upon His Highness f s Government to insist that the Bahriin Petroleum Company takes all reasonable means to prevent Bahrain subjects, and others as well, from losing their lives in driving adcidents. 4. No man should be employed for 15 hours continu ously driving a heavy vehicle. Lorries should be provided with two lights and to enable the Police to make proper investigations of cases it is absolutely essential that vehicles should be left in the position in which the 5 ^- were after the accident until the Police have visited the scene. 5. In one of these accidents, though the lorry belonged to the Bahrain Petroleum Company yet the workmen in it were not the Bahrain petroleum Company employees. They were employed by Mr. M.D. Minasian on a Bahrain Petroleum Company contract. The case has not yet been concluded but should it be proved that the three men lost their lives owing to the negligence of Mr. Hinasian’s driver their families will not be able to obtain compensation without a civil suit.

I shall be glad if you will inform me whether the Company have promulgated any rules to ensure that their employees do not work excessively long hours to the detriment « of their health or possibly to the danger of the public. In this connection I shall be interested to know whether the statement of the driver in the case cited in paragraph 2 (a) of the Adviser’s letter under reference can be checked to discover whether he had in fact been employed for fifteen consecutive hours. 3. With regard to paragraph 2 (b) of the Adviser’s letter I shall be grateful if you will issue instructions that only Jthx in the most exceptional circumstances should vehicles which have been involved in a serious accident be interfered with before the police arrive. The actual position of the vehicles immediately after the accident being a most important factor in many cases in determining the responsibility for the accident. 4. Although much is now being done to ensure that lorries are not driven at an excessive speed or overloaded byram &amp; their drivers I feel that much more could and should be done. Since the accidents referred to in the Adviser^ letter under i A reference I have particularly noticed how grossly overloaded are lorries running to and from Awali and Sitrah. I suggest that it should be possible to exercise more control (a) on the Company premises when the men are entering the lorries and (b) on the road by the Bahrain police doing more to check dangerous driving and overload^ •! am asking the Adviser to the Bahrain Government whether it would be possible to introduce a mobile police traffic patrol for this latter purpose. 5. The Bahrain Motor Vehicles Rules clearly lay down that two front lights must be carried by all motor vehicles and I have recently drawn the attention of the principal users of motor vehicles to these rules and stated that it was proposed rigorously to enforce the law. I am asking the Adviser to the Bahrain Government to take police action against every lorry or motor car contravening the rules.

Hickinbotham, His Britannic Majesty's Political BAHREIN. Dear Major Hickinbotham, Agent, Please refer to your letter No.3727-16/11 dated 10th December, 194-4 regarding the recent motor vehicle accidents. We are attempting to work none of our employees more than ten hours per day. However, in the case of drivers we have been forced, due to the scarcity of this type of employee, to work some of them split-shifts. By 'split-shift' is meant working them for a few hours followed by a rest period followed by a further period of work in the same day. The facts with regard to the driver in the case cited in paragraph 2(a) of the Adviser's letter to you are as follows :- On the day before the accident he was shown on the payroll for 13 hours time. However, the actual hours worked was 8 hours standing by and driving as follows Left Awali at Returned to Awali Time Off Returned to Work Off work 3-30 a.m. 7- 00 a.m. 8- 00 a.m. to 2 p.m. (man went to his quarters in Awali 2-00 p.m. 6-30 p.m. The man was paid for 13 hours time since drivers dislike working a split shift and are being compensated by being paid for a large portion of the time they are off during the middle of the day. The accident happened one hour and fortyfive minutes after he went to work following an off period of nine hours. We have no way of checking but we believe that if his excuse that the accident happened due to loss of sleep is true, then he did not take advantage of the time off in which to rest. Instructions have been issued that motor vehicles involved in motor accidents are not to be moved until the police have made an investigation. It must be realised, however, that this is difficult to adhere to in some cases, especially where the cars block the road. Also, the transportation depart ment is anxious in most cases to get the vehicles back to the garage for repairs, due to the shortage of motor vehicles.&gt; No. C/PA-192. 2 16th December, 1944• With regard to the overloading of lorries, we are doing what we can to overcome this. The condition is aggravated by the fact that upon commencement of the hauling of natives employees by the Company, large numbers of them formerly housed in the Company quarters moved to Manama and elsewhere and are demanding to be transported. The position will be difficult : until April, after which time the number of Bahreinis employed should decrease. Confirming my telephone conversation with you, the Company is installing front lights where missing on all of its motor vehicles. We do not have proper front lights for all of our motor vehicles and will be forced to use smaller lights on the left hand side on a number of them. With regard to rear lights, the lorries obtained from the Army did not come equipped with rear lights. There are, however, red reflectors on these trucks. The Company has adequate orders placed for lights and is doing all possible to expedite delivery in Bahrein, after which time our motor equipment will be properly fitted out. W. P.

Sir, I have the honour to inform you that His Highness Shaikh Sulman has instructed me to address you on the subject of the Bahrain Petroleum Company traffic. 2. His Highness is much concerned at the increase in the number of accidents in which many of his subjects have lost their lives. The whole matter came before his notice particularly when in a recent collision between two Bahrain Petroleum Company lorries five persons were killed and eighteen people were injured. The drivers of the two lorries were tried in the Bahrain Court which found both of them responsible, though not to the same extent, for the accident. Other factors which in the opinion of the Court contributed to the accident were the overcrowding of one of the lorries and the size of the vehicles which were too wide for safe travelling on narrow roads. His Highness now decided to widen the whole road from Manama to Radm al Eawari so that it will be at no place less than 40 feet in width. 3. Regarding overloading, the lorry carried 82 passengers. On the drivers seat, in addition to the driver, there were three persons so tightly packed that it was impossible for the driver to see out of one of the side windows and1 r - 2 - extremely difficult for him to work the giasi? and brake. The Magistrates had the lorry brought to the Court and experiments were made in order to see how many people could safely be carried in the lorry. Though the Magist rates have no mechanical knowledge of these matters it appeared that 50 persons was the maximum number which could safely be carried in this type of truck. His Highness considers that in the interest of the public the Bahrain Petroleum Company should conform to the regulations which are applied to public vehicles and that every vehicle carry ing labourers should be permitted to carry not more than a certain number of persons. It appeared from the evidence tnat no control of any kind is exercised by the Company f s officials in restricting overcrowding. The man responsible for loading the lorry in question stated that he had orders to get as many people as possible into the trucks. In the case in question the two drivers were sentenced to 12 and 8 months hard labour, respectively and their licenses were cancelled permanently. 5. His Highness wishes the Company to take immediate steps to restrict the number of passengers in trucks and to supply the Bahrain Government with a list of all trucks showing the number of passengers which in the Company's opinion can safely be carried. The number should be determined according to the known formula which is used in the case of ordinary passenger vehicles and each vehicle should be clearly marked, o,i the outside, with the number of passengers which it is allowed to carry so that the State Police can check the number of passengers whenever necessary. ii i3- LAr&lt;Ar^ No# 6/87 Political Agency, Bahrain, The 11th March, 1945.

The court which tried the drivers of the vehicles involved in this particular case were of the opinion that contributary factors to the accident were the narrow roads and the over-crowding of one of the lorries. Evidence recorded shows that 82 passengers were being carried in one of the lorries and that there were three persons in addition to the driver on the driver's seat* It is also stated in the evidence that the amount of control which is exercised by officials of your Company over the actual loading of vehicles was negligible and the man res ponsible for loading the lorry in question stated that he had received orders to put as many people as possible into the trucks. 3. His Highness is most anxious that the Company should take steps at once to restrict the number of passengers carried by these vehicles and to this end I suggest that you should instruct your transport people to communicate direct with the Adviser with a view to the number of persons that each vehicle can carry with safety being determined and re corded in large figures on the side of the aforesaid vehicled I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, /#. /l/'b Political Agent, Bahrain.

ADBiJA Yesterday evening, In compliance with Major Hickinbotham's letter of 11th March, 19*5, we carefully loaded out of Awali the three types of trucks we use for transporting men to and from the Refinery and Awali to their homes. After Investigating the capacities of the trucks and their available space, we have concluded that a safe loading would be as follows i- Studebaker 40 men in rear, with 1 man and driver Army Type: in the front seat. General Motor Ten Ton: 60 men in rear with 1 man and driver in the front seat. Ford Trucks 35 m«n in rear with 1 man and driver rented from in the front seat. Bahrein Govt: We would be pleased to demonstrate the above loading to you, or whoever you may delegate to investigate, at any time you may set. However, we believe the best time to observe the loading under normal conditions would be at 3-30 p.m. at Awali on any day except Friday. In the meantime as a safety measure and awaiting your investigation, we have tentatively instructed our men responsible for the above native haul to limit the loading to the above figures. As quickly as we obtain formal approval from you as to the allowable passenger capacities of these trucks, we will carry out Major Hickinbotham's wishes and paint in large figures on the sides of each vehicle, the number of men each will be permitted to transport.

Subject:- Disregard of traffic siPT-als - Shaikh Hamad Bridge . The following incidents are brought to your notice Kith a request that the Political Agent may be notified and a compi&amp;int lodged with the R.V.F. autho rities. The disregard of traffic signals by the dtivers of se rvice vehicles is most noticeable and the efforts of the Police to regulate the traffic with safety meet w r ith little little or no co-operation thorn the average service driver. Gross disregard of traffic signs by R.A.F. drivers has been witnessed on at least two occasions during the past two weeks by myself. In both cases the drivers' attention w f as called to the breach of the rule governing the traffic control and they were requested to reverse their vehicles off the bridge. It is doubtful whether they would have obeyed such a request from the control policeman. At approximately 5.30 p.m. on 18th March 1945, a military truck No. 1882 believed to be working for the A.M.W.D., P-.A.F. and driven by a Sikh entered the bridge from the Muharraq side. The traffic sign which is a new one was showing STOP to traffic from Muharraq and traffic was actually moving in the reverse direction from Manamnh. The Sikh driver had to reverse his vehicle and back off the bridge and in so doing he knocked down and damaged the traffic movement sign. This had been newly erected the previous day. At approximately 11.40 a.m. on 20th March 1945, R.A.F. ambulance No. 86815 driven by a B.O.R. entered the Shaikh Hamad Bridge from the Muharraq approach at a high speed. The traffic control sign v/as showing STOP but this was ignored and the ambulance proceeded across the bridge. A taxi which had been given the right of way on the Manama side of the bridge was compelled to back off in order to let the ambulance pass. The incident was witnessed by at least three separate wit nesses including the chief clerk of the State Engineer's Department. At approximately 1.45 p.m. on 20th March 1945, A.M.W.D. truck No. 4800914 driven by an Indian was app roaching the causeway to Muharraq. The toll keeper lifted the shadoof arm but before it was fully raised the Indian drove through and the roof of his truck fouled and completely broke the arm. The driver stopped his vehicle and the number of it was taken by the toll keener before it proceed to Muharraq. The shadoof arm in question has had to be renewed nr three separate occasions during the past three months. In this case will you please put in a claim for the cost of the damage which amounts to Rs.30/-. S.Z. P^Ji. Re: para 3 ; cost of damage has been notified to the Superintendent of Police.No.1372-6/87.

Another vehicle had been given the sign to'(XT at the Muharraq. side of the bridge and consequently the Military Truck was told by the Police to reverse his car off the bridge to enable this vehicle to pass over it. In the process of driving the Military truck in the reverse direction, the driver caused it to leave the road, mount the foot walk and finally collided* with the safety rail. This rail undoubtedly sa-vad the vehicle from the possibility of being precipitated into the sea. The width of the traffic part of the road on the bridge is 10 ft. with a 4 n rise either side to the foot walk which is 5 ft.wine. The distance the truck was required to reverse was between 40-50 feet. It is abundantly clear that the driver v;us guilty og gross carelessness or alternatively is not fully competent to drive. The railing of the bridge referred to has been slightly bent out of the vertical and ultimately will require to be straightened, as however the damage is in the vicinity of previous damage by an unknown vehicle, I think it would be equitable if the *Uhny is asked to pay only a proportionate part of the repairs which will be carried out when circumstances permit.

At approximately J.25 p.m. on 18th June, 1945 I.was proceeding^tp Muharraq in :iy car accompanied by Ujagar Singh. ( At a position about half way along the causeway I was overtaken by a lorry which gave no ..aruing of its approach. Tuis lorry was tr:;veling at an excessive and dangerous speed which^I estimated to be between jU. j 5 mph. In order to catch up with it I had to drive my car (pudson ho.516&gt; at its maximum possible speed and even then was not able to overtake the trucx □e^ore it crossed the bridge. I eventually uss able to as so abut 250 yds.past the bridge on the guharraq causewty ana, by pulling over in front ana giving the stop sign I stoppea it. I took particulars of the vehicle and driver ana informed hi^ through Ujags.r Singh that he would be reported for dangerous driving. He was auguaentative and truculent and was told by an Indian soldier who was sitting beside him on the front sent' to take no notice on my remarks and also that nothing coula be done to him or words to that effect. This was overheard by Ujagar Singh whom I instructed to explain to the driver the nature of his offence, particulars of the driver and vehicle are as follows Driver - Indian soldier named Ducoo. Vehicle- Dodge Truck belonging to D.I.D.manamah No. 4805167. Additional markings -No. 7 on front Night Wing No. 1858 front Left ,&lt;ing. The Indian soldier passenger’s name was not taken. I recommend that this offence be treated with severity as these cases of dangerous driving by^Service personnel are noticeably on the increase ana the safety of other road users is made insecure.IX 0, 30/108, /-N C icor Coi rmi^.inj Troon:; , B A II R 1, I IT . j j June 19- , ;-5» Oca* Roforenco your letter date traffic accifent in which Sapper Aesar A- 23 rd June 1945&gt; Chand was involv referring Qt'.m to I rejret you do not consHer the result of the investijation as very satisfactor - .

Naturally we should prefer to have it located as close as possible to the present loa ing position, which is close by the taxi rank at the .Viuharraq end of the l.anama/ .uharraq Causeway. However we ealias that the question of ownership of the property concerned is involved and feel that the granting of permission to install the ramp as well as your suggestions for the exact location will be made with this point in mind. * * ^ lours very truly, Original signed by £.

Dear Sir: File #221.05 At approximately 10*0 AJ&amp;* yesterday, 7th May 1946, the Agency truck No.4795748 was driven at excessive speed past the Company guards, on to the new 'wharf at Sitra. His speed was estimated at about 40 m.p.h. whereas the clearly indicated speed limit is 15 m.p.h. The truck was followed by our Safety Engineer who saw the incident and who discovered that the driver had no pass or other authority to be on the Wharf. The driver stated that he was there to meet a launch from a warship. He was informed that all launches dock at the launch basin at the causeviay, shown where it was and instructed to leave the wharf. He refused to leave thewharf, although ordered off by two Staff Foremen and the Company Guard, and it was only when one of the Staff Foremen prepared to drive the truck off himself that the driver finally got in and drove away to the launch basin. His manner was extremely insolent throughout• Only authorized persons, in possession of special wharf passes, are allowed on to the new wharf and we suggest that, in order to avoid any further misunderstanding or embarrassment, you contact the undersigned or our Labour Supervisor to arrange for your representative to pass on to the wharf when necessary. Yours very truly, R. M. BROWN CHIEF LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE 1 * THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LTD. 0 ^3 S? Due (Hi-&gt;- V _ ^l o. 2-^4 3 Translation of letter dated 11 th Jaraad Than! 1365/from Ahmei bin Naseef resident of Manama Aboo Sorrah District, to the Political Agen£, Bahrain. I was on duty at the causeway, as a watchman at ^ ^ ^ • on Wednesday of Jamad Than! 1365. At that time a truck which had a Driver and Farash who wore the Agency uniform approached me and therefore I could not object the entrance of the truck in the causeway. At once Mr* Brown (*) called me and put in a complaint against me to the In-Charge who discharged me, and gave me a certificate which is good for nothing. Therefore, I respectfully request you to look into my case justfully, as I was punished as a result of letting in the Political Agency truck. I have never done any offence in all the Government Depts. U.E.r ^ No.1504-6/87. To Political Agency, Bahrain, The 14th May, 1946.
