September 4th, 1914. □ear Mr. Parker:- Mr. hllley and Mesopotamia oil Fields. I was sorry not to be in and have the chance of speaking to you on the telephone this afternoon, and therefore write a line instead. It has occurred to me that the fact that we are now fighting Germany and that our relations with the Turkish Government are such that war is within the bounds of possibility might cause the Foreign Office to reconsider their attitude with regard to the Anglo Persian Oil company and the question of the mining right in Mesopotamia claimed by Mr. d'Arcy's group. It is possible that negotiations with Turkey with regard to this concession have been, at any rate for the moment, stopped, and it occurred to me that the Foreign Office might be willing at a later stage,when things have settled down, to reconsider the whole questior possibly in Mr. Bliley’s favour. A. Parker, 3sq., Forelgh Office.The question I really want to ask you is this - will Mr. Silley he prejudiced in any way vis-4-vis the Foreign Office and the Turkish Government if for the present he abstains from making any further appeals to you or from answering the points raised in the last letter from the Secretary of State. If not, knowing that you are all excessively busy at the present time, he would wish to refrain from troubling you with letters &amp;c. 1 cannot believe that having regard to the consider able German interests in connexion with the concession, ♦ that the Foreign Office will, after all that has happened, continue to give them their support. Yours sincerely, (olgned) Henry K. Verey.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] TURKEY. r p i i 'p r\, —.—, rr ' f [July 16.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1 . [32183] No. i. Sir L. Mallet to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 16.) (No. 495.) J ^ r ’ Constantinople, July 11 , 1914. IN obedience to the instructions contained in your telegram No. 297 of the 7 th July, I transmit herewith a memorandum drawn up by Mr. Ryan on the legal effect of a decision of the Council of State. I have, &amp;c. LOUIS MALLET. Enclosure in No. 1 . Memorandum respecting Legal Effect of Decision of Council of State relied on by Mr. Silley. TURKISH constitutional practice has always attached the greatest sanctity to the will ot the Sovereign as intimated by irade and embodied for all important purposes in Imperial firmans. The study ol article 7 of the Constitution will show how extensive are tne Imperial prerogatives, even under the Constitution. To say that a pronounce ment of the Council of State or any other authority can of itself invalidate a firman would be repugnant to all ordinary 'iurkish ideas on the subject. The most that could be maintained, in my opinion, is that a decision of the Council of State on a matter which had already been the subject of an irade might conceivablv be so authoritative as to impose upon the executive a constitutional obligation to obtain a fresh expression of the sovereign will based upon it. Ibis would result in the promulgation of a fresh iradd, and, if the earlier irad^ had been embodied in a firman, the natural course would be to enshrine the new one in a new firman which would supersede the old. Subordinate departments would find their guidance not in the pronouncement of the Council of State as such, but in the new expression of the Sultan’s will. We thus come to the question whether a pronouncement of the Council of State in a matter like the present is so authoritative as to bind absolutely the responsible advisers of the Sultan. Before examining this question I would call attention to two points :— L There has been for many years, if not always, too much levity shown in manipulating Turkish institutions for the purposes of the moment, too little intelligent esprit de suite in the minds of the persons composing these institutions, and too defective a system of record to make it possible to say confidently on a given occasion that the precise legal effect of such and such a decision (except, perhaps, in the case of purely judicial tribunals) is so and so. i his applies with special force to the Council of State. 2 . It must never be forgotten that, under the Hamidian regime, the Sultan was the only ultimate fount of authority, and that Imperial irades were the only sanction of new legislative enactments no less than of the most ordinary matters of administration. So fully was this recognised that, after the restoration of the Constitution in 1908, it was found absolutely necessary to disregard constitutional doubts as to the validity of the late Sultan’s acts and to recognise that his irades continued to have force of law until formally superseded. I have been unable to trace any official statement of this principle, but there is no doubt as to the fact of its having been adopted with regard both to legislative and administrative irades of the old regime. The bearing of this is important, because if it be said that the firmans granting the concession of the Mosul and Bagdad oilfields to the civil list were issued regardless of the mining laws of the Empire, and were consequently “ illegal,” it can be retorted that, proceeding from the same authority as the mining laws themselves, they had in themselves as much force as those mining laws, and had, as being particular and subsequent enactments, more force for their own special purpose. This view might be contested, but could not be ignored. To return to the main question concerning the Council of State, article 2 of the I Co-py to ♦ ^ .V1L10U [2193 q—l] ( o' 31JUU914.k'organic Statute of the Council of Srate (dated the 2 nd April, 1868. and printed i Young’s “Corps de Droit ottoman,' vol. i, p. 3) defines the functions of the Council 1 This Statute, though modified by subsequent legislation, is still the main enactment ! embodying fundamental principles governing the Council. The Constitution of the Empire, both as originally drawn up in 1876 and as modified since 1908, contains no definition of the Council’s position in the State except article 117, which in both text° declares that the interpretation of the laws belongs to the Council of State in matters of civil administration. A very wide construction might be put upon this brief expression, but it must be read in the light of the organic Statute which has never as a whole, been repealed or revised and of long practice. Of the seven headings under article 2 of the organic Statutes, Nos. 3 and 4 were, as I gather, from Hakki Bey’s (now Hakki Pasha's) work on the administrative system published in 1906, modified many years ago. The remaining five are, so far as I am aware, still in force. Of them the only one which clearly confers on the Council the power to give judicial decisions is paragraph 6 , which has no bearing on the special question now under consideration Paragraph 1 has also no direct bearing, and though paragraph 2 implies a right of giving formal decisions, its scope is limited by the qualification “ dans les limites de ses attribmions, or, to translate from ITakki Pasha s work, “ m the measure confided to it by law or regulation.’ There remain paragraphs 5 and 7 , which cover what is in practice the bulk of toe Council’s work, and these paragraphs clearlv limit its role to “expressing opinions.” When, in conjunction with this expression, it is remembered that the Council ©in only consider matters referred to it by the Grand Vizier, and can report only to the Grand Vizier, though while examining cases it mav correspond with other departments, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that for all purposes, excepting that of judging functionaries, the Council is merely an advisory bodv. That ^reat weight attaches to its pronouncements, and that, in the majority of cases; they are acted op, cannot be doubted ; but it is to my mind, almost equally certain that the pronounce ments are not in themselves binding on the executive, and that the Council of Ministers can, on their responsibility, override them. ^ t° pronounc 6 w ith absolute confidence on this question, it would be and rvmnblln '“CC 1 ? h / urkls i legal authorities, such as the Law Officers of the Porte Tw“d t Spte tnemselves.

Lowther, who spoke about the case to Hakki Pasha, then Grand Vizier, left a note to the effect that his Highness disputed the contention. The matter was one in which we were not disposed to go very far, as certain British parties were also interested on the other side, and in any case it lapsed as far as the embassy was concerned. I do not know what eventually happened, but the material point is that in 1911, in a case | which was distinctly one of interpreting a law for a purpose of civil administration, the Grand Vizier repudiated the view that a decision of the Council of State bound the Government, and that the British Embassy did not feel any confidence that that contention could be maintained, though we were disposed to think that Messrs. WhittalTs case was in itself a good one. In the present instance the arguments against regarding the Council of State’s decision as a judicial and binding one are certainly not less strong than in the case just related. From one point of view it may be said that they are a good deal stronger, as the question before the Council of State was not one of interpreting “ a ” law, but rather of determining whether a particular sovereign act of the late Sultan’s, done at a time when he was the sole source of law in the Empire, was invalidated by other enactments, which, as I pointed out above, can be said to have had themselves no higher sanction. ANDBEW RYAN. i i |[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] TURKEY. CONFIDENTIAL. % [29859] No. 1. [July 18.] Section 1. Foreign Office to Messrs. Treheme, Higgins, and Co. (Confidential.) Gentlemen, Foreign Office, July 18, 1914. SECRETARY SIR E. GREY has, in view of the circumstances explained in your letters of the 23rd ultimo and the 1st instant, fully reconsidered the claims of your client, Mr. Silley, in respect of oilfields in Mesopotamia, with every desire to support them so far as possible, but the result has been to convince him that Mr. Silley has no rights to oil claims in the vilayets of Mosul and Bagdad which it would be possible for him to make the subject of diplomatic representations to the Sublime Porte. Five of Mr. Silley’s claims in those vilayets are based on applications to the Ministry of Mines made by Ottoman subjects for prospecting licences; Mr. Silley’s contention is that under the Turkish law such an applicant is entitled as of right to the issue of a licence. If Air. Silley’s option over the interests of these Ottoman subjects was acquired after the date on which the Ministry of Mines refused to issue the licences, he obviously acquired nothing more than an interest in certain claims of Ottoman subjects against their own Government; such a possession gives Sir E. Grey no locus standi to make diplomatic representations. When such representations are made it must always be borne in mind that the subject about which they are made may require to be referred to arbitration, and if the claims of a British subject acquired in the above way were referred to arbitration between Great Britain and the Ottoman Government, the arbitration could only end in the dismissal of the claim. It is a well settled rule of international law that, in order to justify the submission to arbitration of a claim by one Power against another, it must be the claim of a national of the former Power from the time at which the claim arose, and the mere transfer of an interest in a claim from the national of one Power to the national of another gives the Government of the latter Power no right to take up the claim diplomatically and to bring it before an arbitration tribunal. The precedents bearing on this point will be found enumerated and discussed at length in the award of the umpire in the Stevenson case, which was referred to arbitration before the Anglo-Venezuelan Alixed Commission at Caracas in 1903. If, therefore, Air. Silley obtained his option over the interests of these Ottoman subjects after the refusal of the prospecting licences in the five cases under discussion. Sir E. Grey is not in a position to make diplomatic representations on his behalf. A reference is made in your letter of the 1 st instant to the foreign interests in the Turkish Petroleum Company, and it is sought to treat Sir E. Grey’s support of the interests of that company, in which no doubt there are foreign shareholders, as parallel with the support which it is desired to obtain for the interests which Air. Silley has acquired from his Ottoman associates. In reality the cases are not at all analogous. The Turkish Petroleum Company is a company incorporated in this country, and its nationality is therefore British. The presence of foreign shareholders does not deprive the company of its British nationality, nor does it affect the power of the Secretary of State to make representations on its behalf. If, on the other hand, Air. Silley acquired his option in the interests of the Ottoman subjects in these five claims before the refusal of the prospecting licences, there was at the time when it came into existence a British element in the claim; but there are other obstacles to the support of the claim at Constantinople. Your client maintains that when the Alinistry of Alines refused to issue licences to the applicants, that Department acted contrary to the Turkish Mining Law, and that it did so without any justification. The enquiries made by the Secretary of State, through His Alajesty s Embassy at Constantinople, show that the Ottoman Government maintain that the Turkish Mining Law did not apply in these cases, and that the refusal of the licences was proper. This refusal is based on the view' that the concession of the oil deposits in Alosul and Bagdad to the Civil List, from which it has since been transferred to the Ministry of Finance, v r as, and remains, valid and in force, and thereby prevents the Copv to Sndsa; JUL1914! ^ operation of the relevant provisions of the Mining Law in those vilayets. All the information in the possession of this Department supports that view, and in these circumstances Sir E. Grey desires you to understand that it is impossible for him to make representations to the Sublime Porte on the grounds that some particular action^ by the Ottoman Government is unjust and contrary to law, when, so far as the | materials in his possession enable him to form an opinion, that action v as just and in accordance with law. . , . . „ . , If Mr. Silley considers that the Turkish law was infringed by the refusal of the licences, his proper remedy is to take proceedings in the Turkish couits and raise the whole question of the validity of the concession to the Civil List, and also the question of the effect which the concession has upon the operation of the Mining Law in the vilayets of Mosul and Bagdad. One of the applications for prospecting licences in those two vilayets was made in the joint names of Mr. Silley and some lurkish associates. It stands, therefore, upon a slightly different footing from the other five, but the refusal of the licence, so far as can be made out, was based on the same grounds by the Ministry of Mines. Here, again, Mr. Silley’s remedy must be to take action in the Turkish courts and demonstrate that the Ministry of Mines were not justified in refusing the licence upon the grounds upon which it was refused. Stress is laid in your letter of the 1st July upon the decision, or the opinion, of the Council of State, of which a copy is enclosed. Enquiries have been instituted by Sir E. Grey as to the effect of the opinion rendered by this body, and he has a detailed memorandum by the legal dragoman of His Majesty’s Embassy on the subject. The functions of this body are purely advisory, and impose no obligation upon the Ottoman Government. It appears, moreover, that these questions came before the Council of State in the following way. The authorities at Bagdad applied to the Ministry of Mines for instructions as to what procedure was to be followed when the applications for these prospecting licences 'were received, and as the matter was not free from doubt the Ministry of Mines were bound to refer the matter to the Sublime Porte for instructions. The decision of the Sublime Porte does not become operative until it has received the Imperial sanction. The Council of State were consulted in the course, and as part, of the reference to the Sublime Porte, and though their opinion w r as to the effect that the Mining Law applied to these tw r o vilayets, and therefore certain of the prospecting licences might issue, it has never received the Imperial sanction. The opinion given by this body does not therefore appear to he final or conclusive, nor does it appear to exclude the necessity of an appeal by Mr. Silley to the Turkish courts if he considers that the refusal of the licences was contrary to Turkish law. It is certainly impossible for Sir E. Grey to pronounce a final opinion on the effect of the statement of views made by the Council of State, as it is a matter of the constitutional law in Turkey, and therefore a matter as to which he can only accept the statements made by the Ottoman Government, until Mr. Silley is in a position to demonstrate that the Turkish view is erroneous. The result is, therefore, that Sir E. Grey can only accept the assurances of the Ottoman Government that the concession for the Civil List, since transferred to the Ministry of Finance, is in force, that it prevents the issue of prospecting licences, and that the contrary opinion expressed by the Council of State has not received the Imperial sanction, and imposes no obligation on the Ottoman Government. It is impossible for Sir E. Grey to adopt any other attitude, because there are other claimants to rights in the oilfields in Mosul and Bagdad whose claims depend upon the validity of the concession of the Civil List, and these parties are equally entitled to the support of the Secretary of State. If it could be shown by appropriate proceedings that the concession was invalid, and that the parties claiming thereunder had no rights, and that the Ottoman Government were wrong in maintaining the opposite, the obstacle to the issue of certain licences under the Mining Law would disappear. Apart from other difficulties (which might prove legally insuperable, but do not now call for special mention) in regard to certain of Mr. Silley’s claims, he would, if he could show that his claims were British at the time of the refusal of Renees, possibly be entitled, in respect of some of them, to the support of His Majesty s Government in endeavours to obtain their issue. But the decision of the Council of State is not sufficient to show that the concession held by the Civil List or t e ' mis try of Finance was invalid, or that it is no longer in operation, and until the a jove particulars can be satisfactorily settled, Sir E. Grey has no adequate ground for contesting the view of the Ottoman Government.V 3 All ese to ion-v th&lt;r 1 in tlie the ion the i in pon can ain, ihat pon , of ited is a the tion ime lied hen was the ime i^ere ugh and the i he by was ;e a is it lich lley the the and the are »end ally date ider the onld but , he 1 of His the it or i the for As regards Mr. Silley’s claims in Basra or Nejd, I am to repeat that, subject to further enquiry as to the validity of those claims, His Majesty’s Government might be prepared to support him if he gave an undertaking in writing that he would not, without the written assent of His Majesty’s Government, transfer to other parties any rights he might eventually acquire.

The subject to which you allude was Sir E. Grey understands, mentioned at a personal interview for which Mr. Verey of your firm, pressed. All that it was intended to convey to Mr. Verey on that occasion was that, from the records and dates of Mr. Silley’s conversations with a representative of His Majesty s Embassy at Constantinople, it was hard to believe that he was not aware of serious impediments to the grant of licences when he first acquired an interest m certain Turkish claims. The impediments in question are the firmans of 1889,1898, and 1902 , and, even if they had been non-existent, Mr. Silley must have been aware that he would have been debarred, in respect of the majority, at any rate, of his claims, by article 4o of the mining regulations, with which you and your client are presumably fully conversant.

We regret that we have had to proceedings were pending with reference to the claims of the D’Arcy group. In addition to the decision of the Council of State of the 4th June, a copy of which we sent you, you are perhaps unaware that there have been earlier decisions dealing with the same subject. We have received particulars of one dated 26 Mouharrem 331 ( 6 th January, 1913), being a decision of the Council of State which received the sanction of the Sublime Porte and was transmitted to the Ministry of Mines, and had in consequence the force of a final judgment. This decision was given in favour of Mr. Silley and his associates, and declares among other things that the firmans on which you rely were ultra vires. We have also before us particulars of another decision of the Council of State, given apparently in November 1912, in which the firmans were repeatedly alluded to as being ult 7 'a vires, on the ground, among other things, that La formahte accomplie pour accorder a la Liste Civile la concession relative au vilayet de Bagdad est nulle et non avenue, vu qu’ii est aussi contraire au Keglement des Mines qu’aux principes generaux du droit.” We must therefore again repeat that the concessions of the oil deposits in Mosoul and Bao-dad to the Civil List, subsequently transferred to the Ministry of Finance, were not and are not valid and in force, the firmans on which you rely for their validity having been declared ultra vires. _ ^ .

OIL concessions in Mesopotamia : Mr. R. H. Silley. We beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, written in reply to our letters to you of the 23rd June and 1 st July. We regret that, we have had to wait a month for a reply to our letter of the 23rd June, as the delay may seriously prejudice our client's position, especially in view of the negotiations which are proceeding between the Foreign Office and the Turkish authorities with reference to the concessions in dispute. As you are silent as to the last paragraph in our letter of the 1 st July, dealing with certain unworthy aspersions which have been made against Mr. Silley and those associated with him, we presume that you have no definite evidence in support of them to bring forward. We must point out that Mr. Silleys claim to the support of his Government does not depend on the date when he acquired an interest in the concessions in question or whether this interest was acquired after the date on which the Ministry of Mines refused to issue licences or before, seeing that the refusal of the Ministry of Mines to issue the licences was in consequence of the fact that the British Government was putting pressure on them to refuse, and because various somewhat complicated legalammmmm L k 2 We understand that the decisions of the Council of State are final in reference to mining matters, and do not need the confirmation of the Cabinet, and that under specific articles of the Mining Code it is the competent authority to decide all mining differences. Further, that its decisions in reference to such matters have practically always been accepted and executed during the last ten years; in fact, it has been the usual practice for its decisions to be sent direct from the Council of State to the ^ Ministry of Mines without being submitted to the Cabinet. It is common knowledge that negotiations have been proceeding for some time between the Foreign Office and Hakki Pasha, representing the Porte, with a view to these particular concessions being given to the Turkish Petroleum Company, and strong diplomatic pressure has been put upon Turkey to achieve this end. Anyone reading your letter would imagine that it had been the function of the Foreign Office to stand by and see fair play while the various claimants to the concessions in question fought it out with the Turkish Government; whereas, in fact the Foreign Office has been for months putting pressure on the Turks to give these concessions to the D’Arcy group. In this respect you must permit us to remark that your letter scarcely conveys a correct impression of the attitude of the Secretary of State, or of the activity or otherwise of the Foreign Office. The position of the Foreign Office is admitted by the paragraph of your letter, in which you say that it is impossible for the Secretary of State to adopt any other attitude, because there are other claimants to rights in the oil fields of Mosou] and Bagdad whose claims depend upon the validity of the concession of the Civil List, and you add that “ these parties are equally entitled to the support of the Secretary of State.” The truth is that the Foreign Office has committed itself to support the Turkish Petroleum Company, and this company is receiving the support of the Foreign Office to the exclusion of all other claimants, and now that the Council of State has given a decision adverse to their legal pretensions, pressure is being put upon the Porte by the Foreign Office to prevent that decision being rendered efiective. If these are not the facts, no doubt you will contradict them. If they are the facts, we can only say that Mr. Silley is being very badly treated. The matter appears to us to be of such importance that we must reserve the right to make the whole correspondence public. We are, &amp;c. TBEHERNE, HIGGINS, and Co.

We had fully considered question of introducing Turkish Petroleum Company into Nejd and Basra ; as 50 per cent, of capital and chairman will he British, its constitution is less open to objection than any other oil company apart from Anglo-Persian, which, for political reasons, it is inexpedient to introduce into Turkey. Pearsons are not acting for themselves alone, but for an international syndicate. Moreover, settlement reached with Germany lessens danger of German consular intrigues in Nejd or El Hasa, wdiile I can think of no arrangement that would eliminate it altogether. Company have, I understand, already addressed certain applications to Tali of Basra in respect of areas both in Basra and Nejd, but most satisfactory course in regard to those provinces would still be for company’s agents in Constantinople to make direct agreement with Silley at early date. As to Bin Saud, I am consulting India Office ; but I should be glad to know when his appointment as Vali is likely to be publicly announced, and, I think, in view of agreement reached with him by Ottoman Government, that there is no longer any adequate reason for deferring settlement as to our own interests in Nejd and El Hasa, to which India Office attach much importance. Hakki Pasha has asked for authority to discuss question, and he is fully cognisant of our wishes. It would be satisfactory to all concerned if this question, which should not entail lengthy negotiation, could be frankly discussed at once. 4[ 705—1311 CONFIDENTIAL. t' e t * &gt;* s* T : 14 Sir Edward Grey to Sir L.

It may be necessary for Turkish Petroleum Company to constitute a subsidiary Ottoman company to work Mesopotamian concession, but, as you say in your telegram No. 393 of 30th June, these matters should be conducted by Company’s representatives. Question of presence of Turkish director, though there may be means of providing for this, is not a minor point, in view of protracted negotiations between the several parties respecting distribution of shares and representation on the board, which preceded the agreement reached in London on 19th March last. It might have the effect of depriving the British element of control, and, though question must be settled by the Company with the Ottoman Government, I hesitate to abandon lever of monopolies agreement until it has been settled. At the same time I have no wish or intention to convey any threat to the Grand Vizier. As to payment of indemnity to third parties, the Company have always appreciated that they would have to compensate in some form or other (probably in the same way as the Anglo-Persian Company did in Persia) the local inhabitants who have derived profit from the wells in the past. As to other claimants, such as those indicated in the second paragraph of your Excellency’s telegram No. 405, if the Ministry of Finance would furnish a list oft hem, and the Ottoman Government would give an assurance that the list was complete and that they considered other claimants, who plead under the Mining Law, were without any valid title, it might be possible to induce Turkish Petroleum Company to indemnify the Ottoman Government. But what Company particularly object to is an unlimited liability, which has been rendered still more formidable by the decision of the Council of State on 4 th June (a decision which, according to Silley, merely confirmed one given two years before), and by the unfortunate indiscretion by which it has become generally known. . . As to Silley, whilst I am mindful of the arguments contained m foreign Office letter of 20 th May to his solicitors, an answer must now be sent to the reply which that letter evoked, and I should therefore be glad to receive a detailed iepl\ to the last paragraph of my telegram No. 292 of 2 nd July, and to learn what is the exact position of the Council of State. Silley maintains that the decision corresponds to a judgment of the House of Lords. A copy of latest correspondence with his solicitors will reach you by post. ~ £jU 1 . 1 SU£ ; r.v?

It seems probable that Silley is getting into touch with him, and it would therefore be advisable for Bin Saud to be in possession of His Majesty’s Government’s view, with regard to mining in his province, without delay. The moment he is appointed Turkish Vali, it will presumably be correct to address applications to him, but it would perhaps be advisable, in view of Turkish susceptibilities, to do so with caution and, if possible, through natives. The wisdom of introducing Turkish Petroleum Company, in which Germans have a large direct and indirect participation, into Arab provinces, has no doubt been fully considered by His Majesty’s Government in the light of policy hitherto followed of excluding introduction of foreign interests on Gulf coast and in Arabia, where Bin Saud is at present dominant. Appearance of Turkish Petroleum Company in these regions would afford German Government as good grounds as His Majesty’s Government for desiring to appoint consular agents in Nejd, which would enable them to intrigue with Arabs. 705 112jCONFIDENTIAL.

In vour letter of the 20 th May you informed us that we were under a grave misapprehension in assuming that the legality of Mr. Silley’s claims were admitted by vour Department. This referred, we think, to a clause in our letter to you of the lot i L a v in which we stated that we understood at one or two interviews which we had L„,j’ t rh,.

Mr. oILLLi : Mesopotamia oil rights. „ , a , re ,? ow instructed to write to you further with reference to your letter to us of tliG 20th May. You take exception to our saying in our letter on the 13th May that the Secretary of State is supporting not only British pretensions which are not in accordance with the mining laws of Turkey, but German and Dutch interests as well. This statement we made for the following reasons :— 1 . The Turkish Petroleum Company is a company whose shares are chiefly held by the iNational Bank of Turkey, the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, and the Deutsche Bank. The Deutsche Bank is a German institution ^controlled by Germans, and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company, we understand, is controlled by Dutch. ‘ ^ 2. The claims of the Turkish Petroleum Company to the concessions in the provinces of Mosul and Bagdad are not in accordance with the mining laws of Turkey. The position as stated in paragraphs 1 and 2 is unaltered, and we must adhere to the statement contained in our letter of the 13th May on this point. We must also take exception to your statement that tbe clauses in the mining law as regards licences are inoperative so far as oil is concerned in the provinces of Mosul and Bagdad. The fact remains that the Mining Department has granted rights to Mr. Silley and those associated with him in the areas in question. Mr. Silley’s appeal to the Turkish authorities to complete the granting of the licences, &amp;c., in connection with these claims has been delayed, according to the information which the Turkish authorities themselves have given Mr. Silley, not because they are invalid, but because the British Embassy and the Foreign Office are trying to prevent their carrying out their own mining law. We gather from your letter that the Foreign Office relies on the Imperial firmans issued in 1889, 1898, and 1902, whereby the Civil List was granted the concession of all the known oil wells in the provinces in question. These concessions were transferred from the Civil List to the Ministry of Finance, and have now been handed over to the Turkish Petroleum Company. We gather that it is because you are of opinion that these concessions are legally valid that the Foreign Office has given its support to the lurkish Petroleum Company and is putting pressure on the Turkish Government to grant them the concessions. Are we to infer that the Foreign Office, if satisfied that these pretensions were not legal, would cease to support the Turkish Petroleum Company and support those whose claims were valid claims ? Mr. Silley is not asking preferential treatment from the British Government, but only wants the Turkish Government to carry out and execute their own mining laws, and that these shall be complied with. It appears to us that all British subjects have an equal right to the assistance of His Majesty’s Government in supporting their legal claims vis-d-vis foreign Governments, and that such support should be granted without favour and without selecting particular persons or bodies for political or other reasons. . . f If Mr. Silley’s claims are legal, and we assert that they are, then the claims ot the Turkish Petroleum Company cannot be valid, and enforcement of the mining laws of Turkey will place this question beyond dispute. It is obvious that if Mr. Silley as an Englishman cannot count on the assistance of his own Government, he will be forced into the hmnls of American, Erencji, and [2165 aa —1], , i.„ vp nlreadv approached him, and will he compelled German interests, some of whom y no t wish to do this, hut he will to make the best terms he can with tliem. have no alternative. offi m w see their way to call upon the Turkish &gt;,w,a»d justice will he don. „ forties legally entitled, »h«..er H.J may ho ^ TREHERNE, HIGGINS and Co. £ -T[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] TURKEY.

It is at present so uncertain that European expert sent by Turkish Petroleum Company to survey for oil at Hofuf might arouse great suspicion and encounter practical difficulty unless previous arrangements were made with Ibn Sand, and this would be contrary to the pblicy which I have recommended. Stock is writing to Nicolls to-day, and recommends that a native, preferably an Arab in employ of Anglo-Persian Company at Abadan, should be sent to hejd in order to ascertain the areas and names of localities where oil may be reported to exist, bu outside Silley’s claim.

T &lt;» n Any deal which may be concluded with Silley over Hofuf claim will, I lear, only encourage him and others to apply for “ permis ” for other areas in Nejd, with a view to ultimately disposing of them to the company. W e have no means to prevent issue of “ permis,” and I therefore think, on political grounds as well as in the interests or the company, that Greenway should be advised to send an expert at once to inspect Hofuf area, as well as the surrounding country. If indications of oil are ±ound m those regions the company should immediately apply for “ permis through t leir Basra agents, and thus, by establishing prior rights, exclude al other applicants. Silley should be then bought out.

No licences were granted, nor is the Ministry in a position or free legally to authorise the issue of any prospecting licences for oil in the two provinces mentioned, whilst the firmans of 1889, 1898, and 1902, which granted the concession of all the oilfields in the provinces of Bagdad and Mosul to the Civil List, continue to remain in existence and have all the force of law. It is certainly hard to believe that Mr. Silley has been unaware of this serious impediment, as the reasons for the refusal to grant prospecting licences for Hamam Ali and Kifri were given in 1911, and for Tekrit and Dilim also in 1911, and it is, besides, quite inconceivable that Mr. Silley should have interested himself financially in rejected applications for permits without first investigating the grounds lor their rejection. It is also strange that after the reasons for withholding the issue of permits in the two vilayets had been given Mr. Silley should have associated himself in an application made in 19 J 3 for permit for Baba Gurgur. This is all the more inexplicable, as Mr. Silley, in an interview which he had with the commercial attache of this embassy, led Mr. Weakley to understand that his agreement or partnership with his Turkish associates was only concluded last August. The question of the date on which he entered into an agreement with his friends could, however, be easily made clear by Mr. Silley being requested to produce documentary evidence proving his interest in these rejected applications. His interest in the Basra applications stands on a different and more solid footing, and His Majesty’s Government can afford him all proper support. In accordance with your instructions, Mr. Silley was duly informed that he would have the assistance of this embassy in his endeavour to obtain the concessions of the three oilfields in the Basra province and in the Nejd sanjak. He was also given to understand that an undertaking would be required from him to the effect that the capital to be engaged in the development and working of these oilfields would be largely British, and that he would not part with his rights in the oilfields without the consent of His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Weakley had informed Mr. Silley that a communication in the above sense would be made to him, and it was recommended that Mr. Silley should, in his own interests, acquire all the rights of his Turkish associates in these applications in order to place himself in a position to give the undertaking required. Mr. Silley has not, as far as I am aware, carried out this recommendation, and consequently no written communication has been made to him relative to the undertaking. [2136 56 — 1 ]I have not failed to cause Mr. Silley to be placed in contact with the representatives of the Turkish Petroleum Company, with the view of his discussing with them the bases on which he would be willing to transfer his rights in the Basra applications to the company. I am given to understand that, at the meeting which took place between Mr. Silley and the company’s representatives, the former was most reluctant to part with any information respecting the properties he hopes to acquire, nor did he give any indication of the conditions on which he might be willing to part with his rights.’ TKp nipftt.inor was stfirilft in results. The meeting was sterile in results. It occurs to me that, in these circumstances, it might possibly be advisable that the Petroleum Company should approach the Turkish associate (Mehmet Eakhri) whose name appears in the application.

THE examination of the various documents having reference to the applications for “ permis de recherches ” mentioned by Mr. R. H. Silley has shown that these applications were made by Ottoman subjects for the following:— In the Vilayet of Bagdad: Oilfields at Tekrit, Dilim, and Mendeli: Applicants, Mehmed Fakhri and Mehmed Reshad. In the Vilayet of Mosul: Oilfields at Hamam Ali and Kifri : Applicants, Mehmed Fakhri and Mehmed Shewket. An application, dated July 1913, for “permis de recherches” for the oilfields at Baba Gurgur, in the Kerkuk district of the Mosul vilayet, was made in the joint names of Mehmed I akhri and R. H. Silley, and this is the only application amongst the six mentioned by Mr. Silley in which his name appears. Separate statements annexed to this memorandum have been drawn up for the purpose of showing, as far as is possible, the action which was taken by the Government Departments in the case of each application and the reasons which were put forward by the Departments for withholding the issue of “ permis de recherches ” for oil in the two provinces. It will be noted that in the case of Hamam Ali and Kifri “ permis” were not granted— &lt;&lt; vi ® eca . use th ese t wo well-known oilfields come within the class of mines described as Maden-i-Mekshoufeh, viz., discovered mines, and for which no “ permis ” are ever issued; . r • ^ ecause ’ quit 0 apart from the fact that under ordinary circumstances these mines belong to the “ Mekshoufeh” class, the concession of all oilfields situated in the provinces of Mosul had been granted to the Civil List ; and 3. ecause of ceitain pending negotiations which had reference to the Chester railway scheme. As regMds the application for the Baba Gurgur oilfields—the only one of the series in \\ nc i - r * 1 s name appears the instructions given to the Mosul authorities T f to the ettect that they were to issue no permits and to await further instructions, inatriwt^o S t 0n ^ l . 1C | ^ 10 cen tral authorities based their reasons for giving these nfnartment h a 3r + u 0t heen a ? certained . but it is permissible to believe that the Mining Department had the concession granted to the Civil List in view.

The local authorities were also forbidden account of the OhL^T 61106 ° f mstruction s from the Porte which were issued on trsubiect in const T 7 n T tiati0nS - The Cou ™ d of State was consulted on t su iject in consequence of complaints made by the applicants, and decided that thereM seemed no legal objection to the issue of permits, and recommended that the licences applied for by Mehmed Fakhri and Mehmed Reshad should be granted. It was evident, when giving this decision, that the Council of State had overlooked the special rights ^Kvhich the Civil List or the Ministry of Finance possessed under three firmans in the Bagdad province, nor had the orders issued to the provincial authorities by the Porte relative to the non-issue of permits been taken into consideration. The Mining Department consequently had to bring these facts to the notice of the Porte, with the recommendation that they should be taken into consideration when the decision given by the Council of State was discussed by the Council of Ministers. # . • It has not been possible to trace the action taken with regard to the application for Mendeli, but the information obtained seems to point to the fact that this demand was set aside, like the others, principally on account of the rights of the Civil The attitude of the Ministry of Mines with regard to all applications for prospecting licences for oil in the Mosul and Bagdad vilayets since the transfer in 1908-9 of the concession of the Mesopotamian oilfields from the Civil List to the Ministry of Finance has been guided by the fact that the firmans dated the 5th Shaban,. 1306 (5th April, 1889), the 5th Djemazi-el-ewel, 1316 (22nd September, 1898), both confirmed in their tenour by a firman of later date, i.e., the 18th Ramazan,^ 13-d (17th December, 1902), granted to the Civil List in a definitive form the concession oi “ all known oil wells, as also those which may be discovered,’’ and situated m the vilayets of Mosul and Bagdad. This concession has passed into the hands ol the Ministry of Finance and is now the property of that Department. Its validity and real existence are incontestable, as the three firmans by which the concession was granted have not been annulled by any law or subsequent firman. Under these circumstances, the clauses of the Mining Law, in so far as they have special reference to the conditions of issue of “permis de recherches,” have become inoperative, as far as oil is concerned, in the districts which are covered by the concession, and therefore no “permis de recherches ” can possibly be granted. , . ^ t Instances in which this view has been maintained are afforded in the case of IN e Zadeh Tahsin Pasha, who held a prospecting licence for oil m the Bagdad ? r ^ lllce - This licence was cancelled by a decision of the Council of State, owing pm p y because of the existence of the Civil List concession. a* nnr i In 1912 the Bagdad Railway Company applied to the authorities p Bagdad for eight prospecting licences for oil (one of them was lor the Baba G g t' 1 ® company statlfg the ^ - ^profit*, du Actions given toTf iocallthorities in two despatches dated tl&gt;e 23rd and 29th January, 1913, were to the effect that permits 1’vious to concession of all oilfields in both provinces had been given to the Civil List pievio the date of the signature of the Bagdad Railway Convention. • • t en cv in the The Mining Department have in one case been guilty of great inconsistency generil application of their view, for three permits were and Nazim Beys by the Mosul authorities m June 1326 (1910) lor prospecting lor hi the KerkuCdistrict of that province.

The 12th Haziran, 1329 (25th June, 1913), ordering the non-issue of permits. It is abundantly evident that the numerous oilfields situated in the Mosul and Bagdad provinces have long been rendered inaccessible to the mining public, owing to the proprietary rights which the Civil List exercised over them in virtue of the firmans of 1889, 1898, and 1902, and which have been exercised by the Ministry of Finance since the transfer of the concession to that Department in 1909. Doubtless both the Germans and D’Arcy, in pursuing the object of obtaining oil concessions in the two vilayets, would have followed the usual procedure, and applied in the first instance for “ permis de recherches,” if that course had been open to them. The Germans, however, found it necessary in 1904 to negotiate with the Civil List and conclude an arrangement for working the oilfields in the two provinces, whilst the negotiations entered into by D’Arcy in 1906-7 wdth the Civil List, after the German contract had been cancelled, as well as his later negotiations in 1908-9 with the Ministry of Mines and the Porte, had in view the acquisition, if possible, of the entire conoession as the only means for obtaining an active interest in the development of the Mesopotamian oilfields. It is therefore clearly manifest that Mr. Silley’s friends have vainly been endeavouring to obtain from the Ministry of Mines that which it is not in the power of the Department to grant, as no permits can legally be issued for districts already covered by firmans of concession. Mr. Silley contends that the applications presented for obtaining permits were drawn up in accordance with the Mining Regulations. On the assumption that the oilfields in the Bagdad and Mosul provinces had not been conceded to the Civil List, but were under the direct and unfettered control of the Ministry of Mines, it is even then doubtful whether the Ministry would have acceded to the demands of Mr. Silley’s friends in the manner in which those demands were made. The oil wells found at Hamam Ali, Kifri, Baba Gurgur in the Mosul vilayet and those at Tekrit, Dilim, and Mendeli in the Bagdad province are all well known. The State or the local municipalities, as the case may be, have for many years past derived certain regular revenues from most if not all of them. They belong to the class of mines known as “ Maden-i-Mekshoufeh,” viz., known or prospected mines, and as such would not come under the permit clauses of the Mining Law, but their working would be subject to the conditions defined in articles 44 and 45 of the Mining Regulations. These are:— Article^ 44. L exploitation des mines appartenant it 1’fitat sera dgalement soumise aux prescriptions des articles de ce reglement concernant les limites, les indemnites, les conditions de 1 exploitation et les autres rnatieres de meme genre. Article^ 45. L Administration des Mines public officiellement la nomenclature des mines deja decouyertes ou abandonnees qui sont connues du Gouvernement Imperial et enregistrees, amsi que celles des mines dont la concession est annulee. File met, s’il y a eu on adjudication 1 exploitation de ces mines au besoin pendant une annde et la concet e au demandeur qui offre annuellement la redevance proportionnelle la plus e\ ee. ^ n procedera, quant aux autres redevances et charges, conformement aux prescriptions du present rbglement it Tinstar des autres mines.” um ers o ^ ells in the districts named are annually put up to adjudication and armu ou &lt;&gt; t le highest bidders. It is therefore more than probable that, even under e mos avouia e and free conditions, Mr. Silley’s friends would have very little prospec o o aining permits for those particular wells, and that their only way of acquiring an interest in them would be that indicated in article 45. M v. ? app ications piesented to the Basra authorities in the joint names of Silley and Mehmed Fakhn for hcences to prospect for oil at Zobeir, El Makayesb, and El Hofuff, in the INejd sanjak, ought to encounter no difficulty whatever, as the Mining Department has full control, and the mining laws in their entirety have full sway in the Basra May 8, 1914.5 Enclosure 2 in No. 1.

[May 4.] [19856J 1 - Central Mining and Investment Corporation to Sir E. Crowe.—(Received May 4.) Sir, 1, London Wall Buildings, London, May 4, 1914. REFERRING to the conversation which Lord Murray of Elibank had the honour of having with yourself and Sir William Tyrrell on Friday afternoon, the 1st May, we beg to be allowed to submit for your consideration the following facts regarding the concession for oil rights in the vilayets of Mosul, Bagdad, and Basra, which for some time past we have been endeavouring to secure from the Imperial Ottoman Government. The possibilities of the useful employment of capital for the development of an oil industry in the territories named have been under our consideration for a considerable time past. During the latter half of 1913 a group representing London capital, and comprising ourselves, S. Pearson and Son (Limited), and Messrs. L. Hirsch and Co. (acting in part for third parties, all domiciled in Great Britain), entered into an agreement with Baron de Ward, under which the concession was to be obtained by that gentleman on behalf of a Company to be formed under Turkish law, the whole of the share capital of such Turkish company in turn to be held by a British company to be formed under the English Companies Act. Apart from the exploitation of the oil, it is the intention, in the event of the concession being secured for the group mentioned, to secure rights for the transporta tion of oil both to the Mediterranean Ocean and Persian Gulf, and provision is made in the draft “ cahier des charges ” (copy of which is annexed hereto*) for the refining of the product, &amp;c. . . . At the time of the formation of the group above detailed it was felt that, in view of the negotiations which were known to be pending between llis Majesty s Govein- ment and the Imperial German Government, and dealing with die settlement of a number of questions, it would probably be necessary eventually to include othei paities, and the arrangements made, therefore, were to the effect that, of the capital to )e provided, each party should subscribe 25 per cent., the remaining 25 per cent, being reserved for emergencies, as will more fully appear from the enclosed mcmoian um, submitted to our solicitors at the time for the purpose of drawing up the necessary agreement. At a later date it was brought to our notice that it would be necessary to allocate a portion of the rights under the concession we are endeavouring to secure to German capital. We thereupon approached firms in Germany, and have arrived at an agreement with houses of undoubted standing, the arrangements between t ic 11 is i and German parties being set out in a letter, copy of which is enclosed,' and Iroin which only the date and the names have been eliminated in accordance with tne provisions of the letter itself.

WE have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, and, in reply, beg to be allowed to state that from the information supplied to us it would appear that the interpretation placed on article 22 of the Bagdad Railway Convention, dated the 5th March, 1903, by the Ottoman Government is not identical with the interpretation underlying your letter under reply, but that, on the contrary, the Ottoman Government claim that, inasmuch as the oil rights within the vilayets of Mosul, Bagdad, and Basra were reserved by Imperial firman, dated 1890, to the Imperial Civil List, they were expressly excluded from the operations of the Bagdad Railway Convention. We realise that His Majesty’s Government have for some time past been giving their support to Mr. D’Arcy. We understand, however, that the “ cahier des charges” submitted to the Ottoman Government ou behalf of Mr. D’Arcy and his group is less favourable to the Ottoman Government than that prepared by ourselves, and that in consequence of their being able to obtain terms more acceptable to them the Ottoman Government favours our group. We beg respectfully to point out that the terms offered by us to the Ottoman Government, whilst fully safeguarding the interests of the Government itself, are considerably more favourable to the lessee or concessionnaire than the terms embodied in the agreements existing between the Government of Trinidad and either the United British West Indies Petroleum Syndicate or the Trinidad Leaseholds (Limited), and are thus capable of being carried out. We also realise that His Majesty’s Government have made the grant of the concession to a British-German group the condition of the assent to the desired increase of the Turkish customs duties from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem and to the institution of certain monopolies in Turkey, but would respectfully point out that, in so far as the interests of His Majesty’s Government are concerned, it should be immaterial who the concessionnaires themselves are, provided the Turkish Government adhere to the condition that the grant is to be made to a British-German group in accordance with the arrangements come to between His Majesty s and the Imperial German Governments.

Information respecting Mr. Silley’s claims has involved examination of papers at Ministry, and has much delayed report, which, however, goes by bag. Of the six applications mentioned by Mr. Silley five have been made by Ottoman subjects, and in only one, that of Baba and Gurgur, does his name appear as a co-applicant with that of an Ottoman subject. Attitude of Mining Department with regard to all applications for oil permits in Mosul and Bagdad vilayets has been guided by the fact that firmans of 1889 and 1898 and 1902 granted to Civil List in a definitive form concession of all known oil-wells, as well as those likely to be discovered and situated in provinces of Mosul and Bagdad. Concession is now property of Ministry of Finance, is valid, and has real existence, as the firmans have not been annulled by any law or subsequent firman. In view of existence of these firmans, clauses of mining law regarding “ permis ” are inoperative as far as oil is concerned, and Department cannot legally issue licences for prospecting for oil in areas in which concessionnaire—that is, Finance Ministry—has real proprietory rights. Investigations have shown that applications of Mr. Silley’s associates have been set aside because of the rights of Finance Ministry under concession to districts applied for. German arrangement in 1904 with Civil List was an arrangement between financier and concessionnaire to work the concession, and negotiations with Civil List, and afterwards with Mining Department and the Porte, were conducted with a view to working a concession already granted by Imperial firmans. Attitude of His Majesty’s Government ever since [group undecypherable] claimed their support has been to assist him in his negotiations with the concessionnaire. This attitude has been entirely consistent with the situation created by firmans in respect of Mesopotamian oilfields. Ottoman Government have accepted and recognised this situation, which has not changed. Mr. Silley’s statement that Ottoman Government cannot satisfy his claims because of support given by His Majesty’s Government and German Government to Turkish Petroleum Company, and that 'this action has forced them to violate [? their own] mining laws, reposes on no foundation of fact. &lt; • i i i -u Mr. Silley’s claims are not based on “ permis,” which are negotiable documents, but on applications for “ permis,” and in view of reasons for which “permis” were not granted, there are no apparent grounds for claiming compensation unless we wish to question validity of a concession on which all our negotiations have been based. ^ ^ There is no legal authority for contention of Mr. Silley’s solicitor; new regime of 1906 has not affected any rights which may have been conferred on Bagdad Railway Companv by article 22 of their convention. . . . , In view of the above, it is important that we should maintain view that concession exists which Porte have been trying to dispute in connection with our recent application on behalf of Turkish Petroleum Company.

[May 20 .] Section 2. [22466] No. 1 . jcLjaM ^ f Foreign Office to Messrs. Treherne, Higgins and Co. (Confidential.) Gentlemen, Foreign Office, May 20, 1914. ^ I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant regarding the claims of your client, Mr. Silley, in respect of certain oilfields in Turkey. In this letter you set forth the nature of Mr. Silley’s claims; you represent that the legality of those claims has, you understand, been recognised by this Department and His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople ; and you contend that the Secretary of State “ is supporting not only British pretensions which are not in accordance with the mining laws of Turkey, but German and Dutch interests as well.” Mr. Silley’s letter of the 17th January last to this Department is the document to which you refer for a statement of his claims. It indicates that he is interested in six petroleum claims in the provinces of Mosul and Bagdad, and in two in the province of Basra, and one in Nejd. As regards the first named, His Majesty’s Ambassador reports that five of the claims rest merely on petitions presented by (not licences granted to) Ottoman subjects; as regards the remaining claims, they are based upon simila^ documents in which the name of Mr. Silley appears as one of the applicants. In respect of the five claims in which Mr. Silley has only an indirect interest, Sir E. Grey does not consider he possesses any valid claim as against the Ottoman Government nor would he be prepared to support a claim of this nature by an Ottoman subject against his own Government merely because a British subject had purported to acquire an interest in that claim ; as regards both categories of claims no licences have been granted, but petitions have only been presented. Mr. Silley’s claims are thus not based on licences, which are negotiable documents, but on petitions for licences, and, certainly in regard to those claims which relate to areas in Mosul and Bagdad, there appear to be no grounds for demanding compensation from the Ottoman Government owing to their failure to issue licences. The attitude of the Ottoman Mining Department with regard to all applications for licences in the provinces of Bagdad and Mosul has been governed by the fact that Imperial firmans issued in 1889,1898, and 1902 granted to the Civil List in a definitive form the concession of all known oil wells, as well as those which might subsequently be discovered, in the provinces in question. This conceasion has not, as your client erroneously assumes, been cancelled; it was transferred from the Civil List to the Ministry of Finance ; it is still valid and existent; and the firmans by which it was granted have not been annulled by any law or subsequent firman. In these circum stances the clauses of the mining law as regards licences are inoperative as far as oil is concerned in regard to these two provinces, and the Mining Department cannot lawfully issue licences for prospecting for oil in areas where the Ministry of Finance has real proprietary rights. The investigations made by His Majesty s Ambassador show that the applications of Mr. Silley’s associates have been set aside for this reason, which alone, in the opinion of Sir E. Grey, would suffice to rule out any claim for compensation. . . . , , I am to state that you are under a grave misapprehension in assuming that the legality of Mr. Silley’s claims was admitted by this Department On the contrary, I am to draw your special attention to the words “in the opinion of his London solicitors, which were inserted by Mr. Parker in the statement you submitted to hirn for revision, and which forms the enclosure in your letter of the 14th April; and I ani further to draw your attention to the last sentence of that statement: But His Majesty s Government can express no opinion as to the value of Mr. Silley s claims, wine i vv as ’‘also inserted by Mr. Parker. . , ,, , In view of the above considerations, Sir E. Grey is compelled o o serve a the assertion that he is supporting pretensions which are not legal is devoid ot foundation. [2136 u—2]2 Tr, conclusion, I am to state that you appear to be under some misapprehension with regard to the conditions of diplomatic support being accorded to Mr. SiUey in regard to his claims in Basra and Nejd. Subject to further enquiry as to the validity of those claims His Majesty’s Government might be prepared to support him if he gave an undertaking that he would not, without the written assent of His Majesty’s Government, transfer to other parties any rights he might eventually acquire. -L clDl, &lt;xC.

Nassif to Foreign Office.—(Received April 28.) c/o Mr. Boxall, 64, Comhill, London, Sir, April 27, 1914. ^ I HAVE the honour to submit herewith a statement giving a short history of the petroleum prospecting licences taken in Syria by two native groups with whom I am largely interested and have their authority to deal for them. In the enclosed it is shown how, in compliance with His Majesty’s Government’s wish, I have brought back from New York the Dead Sea areas to be taken by the Turkish Petroleum Company in London, on the conditions discussed with them in 1912. The Standard Oil Company were only given the seven areas chosen by them to the south-west of the Dead Sea. Their intention is to extend their work in the country to a great extent, and have entered into a contract with me by which I am to give them my assistance in future in taking up new areas and settling their dealings with the Ottoman Government and the natives of the country, against a_ yearly remuneration and a certain percentage in the oil production. This agreement is at present optional on my side. A few days ago in the course of my interviews in London with the manager for Syria of the Standard Oil Company I mentioned to him that, if they could find their way to be on good relations with the British Government, their work in Syria will have the best support, and advised him, as a purely personal suggestion, to make his company approach the British Government with a view of giving hei the first refusal on their fuel oil in Syria when it is produced. To this he lequested me to write to their president in New York, but before taking such a step in the matter I submit the case for your information. I have, &amp;c. S. NASSIF. Enclosure in No. 1. Note on Petroleum Prospecting Licences in Syria. THE areas for which licences were taken for prospecting for petroleum m Syria are the following (each area or licence is about 7,000 acies) . (A.)— Six Licences for Areas lying to the South-east and South of Lake Tiberias. These were taken in 1911 by a group of natives, mostly notables of Haifa and Damascus, as we u as the following licences (B), were offered to, examined, and favourably reported upon by, the Oil Trust Company of London but they neier started drilling, for financial reasons. Subsequently, they were offered to a group consisting o Mr. Deterding, the Deutsche Bank, and the National Bank of l urke y. af ^ er studying the whole documents and position for almost three months, formed the Tu Petroleum Company for the purpose of taking them up They Boddenly ceased negotiating for no reason known to ns. In November . ^d nil fo about Mr. BoxalPs group of London, and they started drilling which has advanced to about 700 ft. in one well. They are now again the subject of negotiation with the Turkish Petroleum Company. (B.) —Seven Licences for Areas lying on the Western Coast of the Dead Sea. These were taken in 1911 by a group mostly cons^ting of notables of Jer^lem These were handled in the same way as licences .k t ushton Mr. Deterding’s group ceased to negotiate.^ They were then offered to Mr. Lusht [2098 ee—3] - , r ., ! j Copy *.c ‘1 {. 2IMA1 i “S MAY 1914 j i ao of London, and reported upon favourably for him by Dr. Wade, but did not start drilling for financial difficulties, and on the advice of Dr. Wade the following licences were also taken :— (C .)—Nine Licences for Areas lying on the Eastern Coast of the Lead Sea. ^ These were taken by Jerusalem group in 1913. The above two English groups having failed to start work, an option on the Dead Sea areas (B) and (C) was subsequently given to the Standard Oil Company of New York for six months from October 1913. This company sent out their geologists and examined the district, and have chosen the following areas to start work upon at once, and requested the Jerusalem group to take up the licences for them. These areas are:— (D.) — Seven Licences for Areas lying on the South-west of the Dead Sea. Taken up by the Jerusalem group in 1914 for the Standard Oil Company of New York. The Standard Oil Company being unable to start work on all the twenty-three areas, and drilling one well in each area each year for the first three years, as provided in their first option, they asked to conclude an agreement for the areas (D) on which they can start work at once, and desired the holders of licences (Bj and (C) to retain them against a monetary remuneration; this necessitated my departure with Ismail Bey El Husseiny, one of Jerusalem group, to New York. Being informed by Mr. Weakley of the British Embassy in Constantinople that his desire is to find us an English group to take these areas, and while in New York I was cabled to that Mr. Deterding’s group were prepared to take over these areas on the terms formerly discussed, I therefore poncluded with the Standard Oil Company a contract for the seven areas they had picked up only, and refused to meet their request with regard to licences (B) and (C), and came over to London to conclude a contract for them. As Mr. Boxalls group are desirous of joining a stronger group to complete the work, and as I am a trustee with Mr. Boxall for these licences, I approached the Turkish Petroleum Company to take these areas as well, and are now negotiating with them for all areas included in (A), (B), and (C), as well as for the three following areas:— (E-)— Three Licences for Areas in the Village of Damascus. Taken by some members of the Haifa-Damascus group. These licences are now offered to the Turkish Petroleum Company as above mentioned. Resume. The disposition of the above thirty-two licences is at present :— Seven in the hands of the Standard Oil Company. Twenty-five the subject of a contract to be entered into with the Turkish Petroleum Company. The attached map* shows approximately the position of these areas. * Not reproduced.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] TURKEY. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 5.

After prolonged negotiations, the interests of the Bagdad Railway Company, acquired under a formal international convention, and those of Mr. D’Arcy, which were also definitely assured, were merged, on terms which, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, sufficiently protect all British interests, in the Turkish Petroleum Company, a company which both His Majesty’s Government and the German Government have undertaken to support. The final grant of the concession to this company has been made an essential condition of the assent of His Majesty’s Govern ment to the desired increase of the Turkish customs duties from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem, and to the institution of certain monopolies in Turkey. With regard to the first enclosure in your letter, I am to inform you that His Majesty’s Government have fully satisfied themselves as to the arrangements to which reference is made, and the point has not, as seems to be supposed, been overlooked.

Treherne, Higgins and Co. to Foreign Office.—(Received May 15.) 7, Bloomsbury Square, London, May 13, 1914. R. H. S1LLEY : Mesopotamian oilfields. We sent Mr. Silley a copy of the statement prepared at the suggestion of the Foreign Office setting out certain facts with regard to their attitude vis-a-vis the Turkish Petroleum Company and others interested in concessions in Asia Minor. Mr. Silley desires us to recapitulate the position at the present time with regard to Turkish mining laws, which have existed for forty years or more and have been modified at various dates, the last law being dated the 2Gth March, 1906, a position with which you are doubtless familiar. About twelve years ago the deposed Sultan Abdul Hamid granted the Civil List what may be termed a prospecting concession over Mosul and Bagdad, giving it the right to take up petroleum concessions in accordance with the then existing mining law, which was then substantially the same as now. A German group was given an option to prospect in accordance with the mining law by the Civil List, which they did not exercise, and which lapsed in consequence. The D’Arcy group then began negotiations with the Civil List in respect of this option without any definite agreement resulting, and the option is held to have been cancelled at the time of the forming of the Constitution for various reasons, among others because a mining concession lapses ipso facto if it is not worked for two consecutive years. The right to prospect given to the Civil List was never exercised or worked, and it has already been declared void. Even if it did still exist, it only confers the right to work two or three petroleum mines which are really Government property and to take out claims, and eventually to obtain concessions each over some 5,000 acres, which has never been done, and always subject to the mining law in force ; indeed, in some quarters it is thought that this concession only gave the right to work two or three Government mines. Hence it is the fact that the rights claimed in respect of the agreement between the Anatolian Railway and the Civil List of 1904, known as the Convention of 1904, have lapsed. We desire to point out to you that the D’Arcy group do not rely on their negotiations with the Civil List, but on verbal statements of two Grand \ iziers, both of whom we understand are dead, made in reply to a proposal from the D Arcy group, to the effect that if it pleased God they would give the D’Arcy group business if they were helped in return, and apparently some vague statement to this effect was made to His Majesty’s Ambassador. It is on a vague statement of this kind, without formal engagement and in the hope of obtaining some assistance in exchange in some unspecified direction, that the D’Arcy group’s alleged rights are based. Article 22 of the Bagdad Railway concession, although it meant a great deal before the Constitution, is meaningless to-day, except so far as it gives the Bagdad Railway power to object to the granting of the entire provinces of Mosul and Bagdad, as the railway company, or those interested through it, maintains that, although they have not yet taken out any claims so far, they have the right to take out such claims as are not already covered by other rights. _ If the D’Arcy group thought that their engagement with the Civil List \vas binding and valid there was no reason for them to buy out the German opposition. The fact that they were forced to purchase the German opposition oi so-called rights clearly, shows that the rights of the D’Arcy group could not stand by themselves and were not indefeasible. Further, the Anglo-Saxon (Shell) Company, which is a Dutch controlled company, has been given an interest. We suggest that this would not have been done if the position of the D’Arcy group had been legally unassailable. The fact is that the alleged rights of the D’Arcy group was of no value in themselves, and derive their ouly value from the support of the British Government. The Turks are prepared to grant the D’Arcy group these petroleum mines, not because they are legally bound to do so, but in exchange for certain advantages conced e y the British Government in return. u 1The fact that the British Government have to obtain these rights against a quid pro quo given to the Turkish Government shows that, up to the present at any rate, these rights have not been legally vested in the D’Arcy group, and it would seem that the support of the British Government has been given to the D Arcy group on t} le ground of expediency and not on the ground of the validity of the rights possessed by the group and those associated with it. Mr. Silley desires us to reiterate that the exact position of the mining rights held by him in Mosul and Bagdad is clearly set out in his letter of the 17th January last to the Forign Office, which gives all the dates and particulars, and that all the require ments of the Turkish mining law have been complied with by him. Mr. Silley only asks the British Government to call upon the Turkish Government to carry out and execute their own mining laws without undue delay. He asks for no preferential or special terms, but merely that the mining laws, good or bad, shall be complied with, and we should mention again that these mining laws were in existence long before the D’Arcy group began their negotiations. Further, as Mr. Silley is only asking for the laws to be complied with, if the claims of the D’Arcy group are legal ones they will not be injured. If, on the other hand, they should prove to be illegal they are not worth the support of His Majesty’s Government. It is not, we believe, the policy of the Foreign Office to refuse to call for compliance with the law of the country in a case of this kind, and least of all to refuse on the ground that such compliance will damage pretensions which are not founded on legal rights. Mr. Silley courts the fullest examination of his legal position in order that the Foreign Office may ascertain whether his position justifies them in calling upon the Turkish Government to have their mining laws carried out wdthout delay. Naturally, if it was found that Mr. Silley’s rights were not legal rights the Foreign Office would refuse its support, but we understood at one or two interviews which we had with you that there was no question of the rights not being legal, and that the Foreign Office and His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople had satisfied themselves that Mr. Silley’s claims, so far as legality went, were perfectly in order. You will permit us to point out that in other cases the Foreign Office have refused to support British pretensions in other parts of the world, and those who have applied to them for assistance have been told that reliance must be placed on the laws of the country in which the business happens to be, and that no support can be expected for anything not strictly in accordance with the law and customs of such countries. In the present case the Foreign Office is supporting not only British pretensions which are not in accordance with the mining laws of Turkey, but German and Dutch interests as well. Mr. Silley informs us that the Turkish authorities say to him, “ Let the British Ambassador ask us to finish this business in accordance with the law and we will immediately give orders for the actual permits to be granted. It is the British Government 'who are preventing our carrying out the law by its demands.” If this is the attitude of the Turkish authorities we would urge that the proper course is for the I oreign Office to satisfy themselves, if they are not already satisfied, whether Mr. Silley s prospecting licences and other rights, or the rights claimed by the Turkish Petroleum Company, are legal or not, and to support whichever party is found to have the legal claim. If the Foreign Office is prepared to support Mr. Silley with the l urkish Government with regard to the provinces of Mosul and Bagdad, he would be lulling to give them tne undertaking they require, to the effect that any company he forms shall be controlled by British capital, and he would be prepared to come to a reasonable agreement with the present British group, although he would not include the Dutch or German interests. ]- n support of His Majesty’s Government would be given to a company whony British and not an international company half foreign-controlled, as is the case with the lurkish Petroleum Company. M hen we discussed this matter with you stress was laid upon The fact that the iplomatic support of His Majesty’s Government had been given to the D’Arcy group since UOo, when the alleged promises were made by the two Grand Viziers, and that m n( ? t the legal formalities which were required to complete r. i ey s rights were carried out. It can hardly be suggested that British merchants e ore carrying out any business in Turkey must first go to His Majesty Ambassador or e oreign Office and enquire whether they are supporting anv other pretensions m respect o the concessions which such merchants propose to acquire. i er r. oiiley s rights or those of the D’Arcy group are in accordance with law and equity. Both cannot be, as they clash. If Mr. Silley’s rights are legal, we haveS&amp;St&amp;tS t‘ SSS* «T J «»— &gt;» - *'»• *.

Petitions referred to under (a) and (b) were addressed to Ministry of Mines, whereas the provinces of Mosul and Bagdad were moved out of sphere of Mining Law by firmans issued to Civil List in 1888, 1898, 1902, granting exclusive rights to latter Department of exploitation of all petroleum deposits. If this is so, Ministry of Mines had no power to grant any rights in those provinces, and claims derived from that Ministry cannot be valid if concession granted to Civil List was not cancelled in 1909, but merely transferred to Ministry of Finance. Do you consider this argument sound ? 3. Further, as regards (a), Silley’s remedy would be against his Turkish associate, who sold him worthless option. 4. As to (c), Silley seems to hold some prior rights, and to that extent appears entitled to our support in due course. I should be glad to learn their precise nature and the area they extend to. XX/V.-, [517-232]confidential. Sir Edward Grey to Sir L. Mallet {Constantinople), (No. 227.) R. */ Foreign Office, May 16, 1914, 1'45 p.m. MY telegram No. 225 of 15th May. Have any of Silley’s licences lapsed owing to his failure to carry out prospecting licences ? Is there any legal authority for contention advanced by his solicitors that rights conferred under article 22 of Bagdad Railway Convention of 1903 became meaningless on establishment of new regime in 1908 ? COPY TO INDIA 1CONFIDENTIAL. # Sir Edward Grey to Sir L. Mallet (Constantinople). (No. 225.) R. Foreign Office, May 15, 1914, 10*30 p.m. YOUR telegram No. 230 Mr. Silley’s solicitors represent :— 1 . That he has a valid claim according to Turkish Mining Law to petroleum licences in Mosul and Bagdad. 2. That Ottoman Government reply to him that this claim cannot be satisfied owing to diplomatic support given by British and German Governments to Turkish Petroleum Company. 3. That Ottoman Government are therefore being compelled by force majeure to violate their own laws. 4. That our action is legally indefensible even if it may be politically expedient. 5. That His Majesty’s Government should discontinue action under 2. 6 That failing 5, His Majesty’s Government should at least support Mr. Silley in claiming compensatson from Ottoman Government for his violated rights. This is difficult to do, as it involves payment of compensation by Ottoman Government as a result of their compliance with our demands, though the claim would never have arisen if they had not granted licences in conflict with their prior obligations. 1 cannot reply to these representations without your Excellency’s views (a) as to legal position, and ( 6 ) as to best practical solution of the difficulty. Please telegraph an early reply. COPY TO \UD\k % ~z- 1 4 1 l [517-194]V [This Document is the Property of His Britannic ^r&gt;vpjamient.] P 1942 9i4 TURKEY. CONFIDENTIAL.

Deutsche Bank group believe that the quickest way of obtaining the concession for Mosul and Bagdad would be to base the application solely upon the Convention of 1904. Greenway holds that it would be best to base it upon the Conventions of 1903, 1904, and the promises given to D’Arcy. You know the formal objections felt here to basing application upon the 1004 Convention, which we have maintained had lapsed ; but if there are great practical advantages in doing so your Excellency has full freedom of action in the matter. Please dmcuss position fully with your German colleague. One objection to licences is expense involved.

Mallet to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 22.) Constantinople, April 22, 1914. YOUR telegram No. 202 of 20th April: Mesopotamian oil. My German colleague and 1 are awaiting a promised list of the mines in the possession of the Government before taking further steps. I quite agree that there* is much to he said for the Turkish contention, and if we can protect ourselves by some confidential assurance against the possibility of other companies, such as Standard Oil, or a Turkish combination, acquiring permits, it may be the best way out of the difficulty. There will remain, however, other difficulties to be got over. Once the mining law is applied to those provinces, four or five serious claimants at once arise to oil concessions, who have put in application in a legal manner for some time past. The Grand Vizier does not, however, attach any importance to this, and it will be the business of the Turkish Government to deal with them. Silley is to meet the agents of the Petroleum Company, but makes a great deal of his Mosul and Bagdad claims.
