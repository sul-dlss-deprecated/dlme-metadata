Dated, 5th Dil Qaadah 48 To The President, Manamah Municipality, After Compliments. I have the honour to inform you that after the end of this year, the monthly payment made to the Manamah Municipality by the Govern ment will be Rs 1000/-, Rupees One Thousand Only per month, instead of Ets 2000/-. The subsidy from the Government, as you know, used to be Rs 2000/- per month only, which was paid to the Manamah Municipality. Some two years ago a Baladya was started in Muharraq to which the Government also paid Ks 2000/- per month. For the last two years and more the Government has paid Rs 48,000/- per annum to the two Municipalities and inGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN, in addition to this, it has paid numerous sums, in some cases very large, as assistance in special works, such as Rs 20,000/- for the Muharraq sea-road and Rs l 'i 0 OOl^ for filling in spaces on the Manamah searoad, which itself was built by the Government* It is now the intention of the Government to reduce the total grant to the Municipalities to the previous amount of Rs 2000/- per month, but as Muharrak Baladya is a new insti tution its grant will not be reduced until the pear after next, that is 1350. Taxation in Bahrain is probably less ihan almost any other place in the world. There is inly the Customs import tax, which is lower than any other port in the Gulf, and the Baladya tax which is only paid on buildings which are occupied. It will now be necessary for you to decide by what means you will recover the Rs 12,000/- which will no longer be paid to you by the Govern ment. There are various ways in which this can be done and I would suggest oneGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. -3- one of the following. 1. That the reduction in Baladya tax which was made, against my advice, about a year ago, should be cancelled and the Baladya tax should be the amount v/hich was for merly collected. 2. That a tax should be paid on all buildings whether they are occupied or not, for instance it could be half the amount of tax on occupied buildings. 3. A tax might be imposed on all open property within the muni cipal area which belongs to private individuals* I also suggest that the owner of the house, shop, or amarah should be responsible for paying Baladya tax, not the tenant as it is well- known to you that the tenant cons tantly move and much of the revenue of the Baladya is lost owing to this. This plan would be no hard ship as landlords could add the amount of the tax to their rent from the tenants. The Baladya should be as much as possible self supporting and it should not have to depend on the Government for half its revenue as-4- it hes done formerly, I feel sure that the people of Manamah, especially the merchants and shopkeepers appreciate the work done by the Baladya and will be glad at such very slight cost to assist it to carry on improvements as it has done in the past. We hear with pleasure the opinion of all strangers who visit Man amah and Muharrak that these towns are are the cleanest, the best managed and the most sanitary of any ports in the Gulf and we hope that they will continue to be the best and that they will improve every year.

Unless you can make this arrange ment for collection of house tax etc. it will be better if you decide only to carry out the work of cleaning the town during the coming year because if the state of business continues as it is no^, and at present I see no rrosreet of improvement, your income will become very much less next year than it was in 1350. I suggested this system before and I think now it is even more neces sary that you should make the charge. Usual ending. Adviser to the Government.2-W No. itff’ Political Agency f Kuv/ait.
