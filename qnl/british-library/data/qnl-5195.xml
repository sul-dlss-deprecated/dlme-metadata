' iCONFIDENTIAL D.Q.No 172»S &gt; Persian Gulf Residency, Bushire. Dated 1st February 1946. My dear Harrison, I am desired by Sir Geoffrey Prior to address you on the subject of the actions - or rather the inactions - of the British Council in the Persian Gulf area. Sir Geoffrey has seen their re port for the year 1944-45 and has been struck by the negligible extent of their activities in this area as compared with these in other parts of the world. He observes that the sum total of their contribution to an area where we have vital interests and long standing attachments amounts to about £ 800/- per year, -£ 225/- of this being for books and the rest the Council*s contribution to the salary of the Director of Education at Bahrain, whose post the Council have failed to fill since Wakelin left last summer. Furthermore, I am to point out that the Bahrain Government pay £ 500/- towards the pay etc. of the Director of Education and instead of being stirred on by this tribute the Council prefer to do far less than in areas which contribute nothing; while in Kuwait the political authorities have been at great pains to see that the Council representative was well received and given a useful field for work but no attempt has been made to take a ivantage of the opportunity thus presented. 2. It is clear that the British Council could scarcely have a wider field of influence in the Gulf than the control of education in Bahrain combined with a very wide say in Kuwait, and Sir Geoffrey’s conclusion is that their work has been disappointing despite the warm support which has been given them. He trusts that an effort will be matte to bring home to them the importance of the Gulf area and the necessity of giving it the same careful attention that is being paid to other parts of the globe. Yours sincerely, Sd/- C.J.Pelly. F.A.K. Harrison, Esquire, India Office, London.INDIA OFFICE. EXTERNAL DEPARTMENT EXPRESS LETTciti (AIR MAIL) From: Secretary of State for India.

Copy is enclosed of letter from British Council dated 22nd Hanuary, on which I should be glad to have your comments by telegram. Belgrave, while on leave here, was informed that appointment of Squadron-Leader MacDonald had fallen through, but made no mention of suggestion to appoint Downes. The issue of the above has been duly authorised. Sd./- E.P.Donaldson Ext. 615/46 THE BRITISH COUNCIL, 3, Hanover Street, London, W.l. 1 22nd January, 1946. Dear Harrison, This is to confirm our telephone conversation of the 17th January. As you know, we had hoped to post S/Ldr.Grant MacDonald temporarily to Bahrain as Educational Adviser^ but this arrangement has fallen through. Since last summer we have interviewed several possible candidates, it being pur intention, if a suitable person should be found who had no experience of Arab countries, to post him to our Institute in Cairo for some months in order for him to get some suitable Middle Eastern experience. However, we were not satisfied by any candidate in this country. In view of this we cabled through you suggesting that the local arrangements made by Highwood should contin ue for the time being. Highwood, who is the Director of the British Institute in Cairo, had visited Bahrain in order to report on the situation in October. We have, however, been taking steps to appoint someone in a permanent capacity. We propose to transfer an experienced member of our Iraq staff whom the Iraq Representative, at /presentpresent in London, considers well fitted for the post. On 15th January Belgrave called at our office and saw Hussey, who is Head of the Middle East Depart ment of the British Council. He said that he wished to introduce a young man called Downes, who he thought would be suitable for the Bahrain post. Downes called on us on 17th January and gave us to understand that Belgrave was intending to sound the Shaikh as to the possibility of his paying the whole cost of the appointment, in which case Belgrave would offer hiihc the post. This took us somewhat by surprise as Belgrave had said nothing to indicate that the recog nised procedure of the nomination to the post being made by the British Council was being dropped. We were favourably impreseed by Downes but consider him rather young and inexperienced for the post. If we had considered such a condidate we should have wished to post him for some months to one of our Middle East Institutes before sending him to Bahrain. In these circumstances, we should be very grate ful if you could discover for us whether we are to proceed by the existing machinery for making this Bahrain appointment or whether the Bahrain Government wishes to take the appointment entirely into its own hands. The estimates for British Council expenditure in Bahrain have in previous years been drawn up in Cairo and sent to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, for perusal and comment before their despatch to London. This was not done this year because our Middle East Office has been wound-up. The estimates were prepared hastily by Highwood on his return from Bahrain and despatched in letter form to London. As far as we know he did not send a copy of his letter to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf. The actual estimates had to be prepared by me in London on the basis of Highwood!s letter. They are still in Estimate form, and I am shortly sending a copy to you for favour of your forwarding to the Political Resident. v Yours sincerely, Sd./- James Livingstone.No. 247 -43/9 The Political A^ent, Kuwait presents hie complimenta to:- The Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRS . atnd has the honour to return to him the undermentioned documents for favour of disposal.

The laat three, among whom were Sheikh Khalid Mohammed and F&amp;h&amp;d Dhain, were boarders at the aohool. ¥he other six were accommodated at Africa House a pension not far from the Institute* although the British Council could not accept responsibility for these boya it wae agreed that Kr Highwood, as far as his duties would permit, should keep in touch with them* ^his he and his ataff did throughout the year. It waa while he was on leave that Khalid became difficult. It was unfortunate that Baffar Boy Nafrawi, the HoadfnfUilet of the saidieh uchool who did so much for the welfare of the Gulf students, wat replaced during the school year and was succeeded by two others in turn. It was with the second of these tnat Khalid Mohammed quarrelled. He then determined to return to Banraln. His influence over Fahad iihain - the only other pure Arab of ine .arty - waa considerable. Fahad insisted on re turning with Khalid. Sheikh Mohammed bin &lt;*ea el Khalifeh, Khalid*8 uncle, was in Cairo at the time. He made every effort to make Khalid see reason but failed to persuade him to stay. Both Mr Hi#wood and Mr wakelin were fully aware of the undesirability of bringing boya from the Gulf to Cairo as long as they were not strictly supervised and were insistent on the establishment of Hostels here. In September 1943, by the help of the British Council, two houses were found, furniture was bought and staff engaged. There are now 55 atudenta in the Kuwait Hostel and 20 in that of Bahrain. Abdel Aziz Hussain of Kuwait la Warden of the firat and Mohammed Habbashi, an Igyptlan, warded of the second.

Mr.Highwood is writing to you about the change of Director and teaching staff for the Kuwait Education Department. The Ministry appointed Taha Sueifi to succeed Hamdi and he then selected twelve men and five women. Their appointment was approved by the Minister last week and w e were approached by Ezsat Jaffar to arrange their passages. This we are doing and shall endeavour to get them away by the end of the month. Taha Sueifi, the new Director, is a man of about fifty. He is married and has a large family but he will go to Kuwait alone. He is a graduate of the Higher Training College, Cairo, (1915) where all instruction was given in English, his subjects being Science and Mathematics. In 1922 he was sent by King Fuad to Gilwell Park to represent Egypt, where he obtained the Wood Badge. In 1923 he was awarded the Order of the Nile. In 1939 he received the Medal of Merit from King Farouk. Since 1915 he has held posts as Teacher, Inspector and Chief Inspector. His most recent post was that of Head Master of Kena Secondary School in Upper Egypt, before which he was Chief Inspector of schools in the Kharga Oasis. His salary wi 11 be £E. 4 l| p.m. The following teachers have had their contracts renewed : nas 1 c balary IBRAHIM ABDEL COWAD English, History, Geography £E.15 ABDEL HAMID EL HABASHI ' ' ' 15 AHMAD QAID Science 8c Mathematics 13 -J MOHAMED SABR EL SAADI P.T. 12^ MOHAMED SABIR EL GAMAL Arabic 15 ALI 3ULMAN Art 12 FATHIYA MAHMOUD Domestic Science 7 ^- Those newly engaged are : ABDEL MAGID MUSTAFA Graduate of the Higher Training College, English Section, Cairo (1932).

The Kuwait Government also pays the basic salary plus a cost of living allowance. This allowance is tapered, but as far as I understand, from the wrong end. I cannot quote exact figures, but I do know that at one time the Director was receiving a 50^ allowance, the Egyptian teachers about 30^ and Kuwaitis far less.

PJW/GrPH conpidbtttial . Dear Tandy, Kuwait Hostel . As 30th September 1946 is the end of the Hostel’s financial year, this is a suitable occasion to review its progress. 3, SIKKET EL MAGHRABY, CAIRO. 26th September, 1946. When Adviser to the Education Department, I urged strongly that a hostel be established in Cairo to accommodate the many students studying there^ I also urged that as many of these students as possible should be given a year at a secondary school and then a year at a Teachers Training College to enable them to teach in the Kuwait Primary schools. This is a most important point as the need for trained local staff is very great. In June of last year Sadik Hamdi, who was then Director of Education, came to Cairo and with the help of the British Council secured a suitable house* He was aitirely responsible for the furnishing and was supplied with funds direct by the Kuwait Education Department for this. Abdel Aziz Hussein, a young Kuwaiti, who was studying here, was appointed as harden. There were in all 55 boys in the Hostel* The British Institute was requested to administer the funds for the running of the Hostel* Prom time to time drafts are sent to us which we pay into a special Kuwait Students' Account with Barclay's Bank. Prom these funds we pay the bills for food, light, water, staff, pay, pocket money and various other items included in the running of the Hostel* Each month our accountant submits a detailed statement of account to the Director of Education, Kuwait, and in addition a quarterly summary. Prom time to time we have made suggestions to Hamdi which would lead to considerable economy but they have mostly been ignored. In many ways, in our opinion, money is being spent unwisely. Major F.Tandy, Political Agent, KUWAIT.We are authorised to pay for normal expenditure and in addition are expected to pav out large sums at the verbal request of Abdel Aziz Hussein who always claims to have had written instructions from Hamdi. When this occurs we withhold payment until we ascertain that authorisation has in fact been given. On investi gation we have always found that permission has been granted. Meanwhile Abdel Aziz runs up bills - sometimes of £E 200 -£E .300 - which we settle when we have definite instructions. Our efforts to straighten this out led to unpleasantness in that Hamdi looked upon them as an uncalled for lack of confidence in Abdel Aziz and himself. At one time we were asked to pay out £E.2500 for clothing for the students whereas £E.750 would have sufficed. We did eventually succeed in curtailing this expenditure but not before more had been spent than was necessary. On several occasions we were asked to make payments from the apount which was to be refunded by Hamdi. Under this heading were the holiday in Ras-el- Bar and several air-passages. We have, however, included them in the monthly statements. Hamdi was himself responsible for the buying of the equipment and received the money direct from Kuwait. As you saw for yourself when in Cairo there is a considerable amount of material here. We have made repeated efforts to obtain an inventory and price list but in vain. Our requests have always been ignored. When Hamdi left Cairo for Kuwait in October 1945&gt; instead of asking us to pay the rent of the Hostel which is £E.80 p.m., he gave us a number of cheques for this amount to be drawn on his private account in Cairo. Certain repairs and alterations to the Hostel building and a Gestetner Duplicating machine costing about £E.90 purchased through the British Council, London, were also paid for in this way. Hamdi never gave a satisfactory explanation for this. The British Institute is merely the channel through which money flows from Kuwait to the Hostel. We have no control over expenditure. If this is all that is required it would relieve us of much labour if the money were paid direct to the Warden of the Hostel./ 3 .- Apart from financial matters there are several other criticisms I should like to make of the Hostel administration*. The present housekeeper, an Egyptian woman, is incapable of doing anything but sort washing. What is needed is a European woman of experience* There is a Mrs.Melldr, who is well known to Sheikh Abdullah &lt; Lflr, who would, be most suitable. She is at present working with the Y.W.C.A. but will soon be released. Her salary would be £E.20 p.m. compared with £E .6 p.m. paid to the present woman but the benefits would be enormous* It is doubtful whether Abdel Aziz would relish working with her having had full control for a year, but this difficulty could be overcome. s/ J Many of the atudents are so backward in their work, especially in English, that large sums have to be spent on private tuition in the Hostel. During the summer holiday, we made special arrangements in the Institute for English lessons under an expert Englishman. The Bahrain boys attended regularly three times a week. After a few lessons the Kuwait boys began to thin out. Within a week or so only a handful attended. Eventually we were forced to slose the classes. We appealed to both Abdel Aziz and Hcjmdi but were told that the boys did not wish to attend. In our opinion, and also in that of the Ministry, most of these boys should be attending training schools so that they may return to Kuwait after a year as elementary teachers* We question the policy of running a secondary school hostel here and a secondary school in Kuwait. It would be far better to develop the school in Kuwait and use the hostel here for technical students and teachers in t raining. is a Abdel Aziz has studied for some years in Egypt and took a training course at the Institute of Education* He keen educationist and a student* He has carried out his duties &lt;as harden to the best of his ability, conscientiously! and honestly. It has not been an easy job: but the type of man required should be of a tougher mould - less academic and more practical. I expressed this opinion in 1945 when last in Kuwait out the Committee were most anxious to have a Kuwaiti in charge. I suggest that a young Egyptian and Mrs.Mellor could do the job well.As things are at the moment we do not feel that any advantage to either party is accruing by our transmitting funds. If we are to be associated with the Hostel we should have definite instructions on expenditure direct from Kuwait and control over the staff and boys in Cairo. We ran the Bahrain Hostel satisfactorily under these conditions. We are ready to do the same for Kuwait should we be asked. At present we do all the routine work, are ignored in matters of administration, but asked for assistance whenever difficulties arise through the neglect of our advice. Typical of the situations which arise is that of the imminent arrival of five new students from Kuwait this week. Last night Abdel Aziz asked me what I was going to do about them. This was the first intimation that I had of their coming. We shall now have to set about making hasty arrangements for them. We here in Cairo are in close touch with the Egyptian Ministry; we have had considerable experience in the running of hostels and are aware of the educational needs of Kuwait. We are now in a position to give an estimate of the annual expenditure provided no surprises are sprung upon us. We feel that either we should be asked to be in truth respon sible for the administration here or that we be relieved of it entirely. We shall be grateful for your opinion on the matter.BY BAG THE BRITISH COUNCIL Incorporated by Royal Charter l telephone : 6874 TELEGRAMS : BRITCOUN BAGHDAD. •VAVi jyhN fij Ref.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your printed letter No. 960-S, dated the 8th November, 1946 and to report that I have approached the Shaikh as directed and that he has forwardec in replying the enclosed resolution of tho Kuwait Education Committee with which he agrees. 2. It will be seen that the Committee have not taken in with the British Council’s suggestions in toto and wish to limit the financial superintendance of the latter to the prepa ration of a budget and to seeing that expenditure is kept within the limits laid down. They are unwilling to agree to the British Council’s proposals to change the matron and the warden. 3 . I do not think it would be advisable to attempt to bring pressure to bear on the Committee and if the British Council consider that the proposed arrangements limit their control too drastically, I can only recommend that they should signify their intention to withdraw from participating in the running of the hostel. 4. The Committee’s resolution shows little sign that they appreciate the trouble taken and the services performed by the British Council on their behalf, but I can assure the Council that they are not, in fact,unappreciative.

The Education Board were opposed from the very beginning to tne employment of a mabron by the Kuwait Hostel for bne reasons concerned with Kuwait customs and traditions. The Egyptian lady has nothin to do bub to sort the washing and deliver them to their owners; the Education Board think that this work can just as easily be done by a male servant of experience. This will not therefore necessitate the employ ment of women by the Hostel. e will also be respecting our national oust orris and traditions and training our youth likewise. The Education Board have every dasire that the warden of the Hostel should continue^to be a Kuwaiti. It was decided by the Boara bhat Abdulaziz Hussain should fill this post. Abdulaziz as it is stated in the letter M has studied for a few years in Egypt and took a training course at tne Institute of Education and is a ‘teen educationist and student. He has carried out his duties to the best of his ability conscientiously and honestly.' The Board maintain that tne warden should be Abdulaziz Hussain because he is a Kuwaiti and because he lias the qualifications uorthy of the post. EObCAriUdiiLi MIooluN: The purpose of sending students of the mission bo Egypt was nob bhat they should return as elementary teachers but that the capable students should complete their University course and return to Kuwait as technical students in various branches of teaching and baits their place in the Primary and Secondary schools in Kuwait. The Beard has decided that all the students who fail two years successively in their group will return and join the Secondary School. It has also been decided that no more Educational Missions will be sent to Cairo in future bo ^oin Secondary Scnools there and that the only mission to be sent dll be limited to students joining the Universities for technical causes. The Board agree in this respect with Mr. ''akelin. Private missions are to be exempted from this decision as the members of these missionsmissions study aqcordine; the wishes of their uarents but under the supervision and approval of the iluucatlon Department and they join the hostel following the rules of that institute Their expenditure is met by their parents. The Mission’s results in last year’s excinina- tions has revived the haucation Departmeiit’s hope of reaching the ^oal that was behind the establishment of a hostel in Cairo. Tnen a sufficient number of technical students of the mission who have passed their examinations is available it will be possible to dispense with the services o: foreign technicians whether they be teachers, doctors or engineers and then.ve shall not in future be a burden to the Eastern nations. e will also save the heavy expenditure paid in salaries to foreign technicians.ABDULLA MULLA SALEH KUWAIT £*[ ^ 8tli« December, 1946, lU* ^ Dear Mr* Bird, With reference to the telegram from Information, Basrah dated 4th• December, 1946, I shall be grateful if you please ascertain whether it is complete Electric Plant with projector or just a Projector.

I understood that he quarrelled with other Egyptian teachers in Kuwait and that they demanded- his removal. There is also some question of his having made a lot of money while holding the appointment.Hi 0 5 •30; i’VDT? 1 I.’-D From Political i^ent, Kuwait. To Political Resident, Bahrain. No.2133-43/9. Dated the 29th December, 1946. Reference your Express Letter ho. 1061-3, dated the 20til November, 1946. Recall of oadiq ilamdi. 2. I believe that the events which culminated in Sadiq Hamdi’a recall started from the fact that the Kuwait Education Depairtrnent increased his pay very considerably as a mant of appreciation of his work. No similar increase was made in tiie pay of his subordinates wno resented this and combined to demand his removal when they reached E^ypt for their holidays, 3. .as is usual in the Orient the complaint probably encompassed every conceivable and inconceivable offence. T know i it stated (incorrectly in ny opinion) that Hamdi hud failed to stage fitting celebrations on the birthday of King Farouq, and 1 % 1 should be very surprised if it did not contain allegations of embezzelment. Although trie Kuwait Education Department certainly made very large payments in Cairo in connection with the hostel through Hamdi there is no proof that any of the money 'stuck to his fingers’. It is certain that lie displayed great energy and capacity in renting and furnisiiirg the hostel in the face of war-time difficulties and, so far as I have been able to judge, his work in Kuwait was excellent. It is a pity tnat he should have aroused the resentment of his assistants and that lie should have put himself in a position in which it was possible for charges of corruption to be levelled against him. 4. I think in. future that our Education Department will make all payments through the British Council so tnat there should be no possibility of a similar situation arising. vl&lt; rolitical AgenE, Kuwait. =VCS=■n.

On October 1st 1945 Hamdi Bey handed us cheques on his own bank to a total value of £E.800 for ten months’ rent at £E.80 per month. Before leaving for Kuwait he paid to us £E.1104*000 for expenses. All other monies from then on were paid through the Bank of Iran, Kuwait. Items 1-5 were not originally included in the budget and are there fore listed separately. You will see that apart from equipment purchased by Hamdi Bey before the accounts were handed over to us, the total expenditure during the year has been £E.9639.229. I should like to draw your attention to the three items under the headings of Medical Expenses, Private Lessons and Clothing. (a) Medical Expenses : The figure of £E.334*686 includes £E.120 per year paid to the Doctor whom you met when in Cairo. The balance of £E.214.686 was spent on medicines and other doctors’ fees. This sum is excessive. It is useless to employ a man at £E.10 per month if his sole duty is to refer sick boys to other doctors. The appointment oi a Matron ^ would lead to a considerable saving on this item. (b) Private Lessons : I am aware that many of the students were very much below the standard required by the Egyptian schools and that if these boys were to succeed in their examination extra lessons were necessary but £E.541.270 is out of all proportion to their needs. Now that 75$ of the boys have passed their examination this expenditure must be drastically reduced. (c) Clothing : £E.1675.539 was spent in providing 55 boys with clothing at roughly £E.30 per boy per year. For those arriving newly in the country this is reasonable but for the others who require only replace ments this is a very high figure. A saving of £E.400 could be effected without seriously affecting the sartorial elegance of the students. Major F.Tandy, H.B.M.f olitical Agent, The Agency ^.^t. r rTravelling Expenses : The above estimates do not include travelling expenses to and from Kuwait should any students return as we do not yet know what arrangements will be made for the summer holidays. . We shall be grateful for a draft of £E.1,000 as we now have very little in hand. The opening cf the Secondary Schools and Universities has again been postponed to 16th November.

I haV'O discussed the matter at length with Shaikh Abdulla.h Jabir (who, as usual with Kuwaitis, has somewhat large ideas) on the assumption that you were not contemplating an annual prize involving current expenditure M in perpetuity*'. 3. Abdulla Jabir was emphatic that there was nothing so appreciated as a silver cup and that books - even presentation volumes (which in any case are probably unobtainable) - would not be appreciated. The Imperial Bank already gives an Annual prize of Hs.225/- to be divided among the best 3 boys at English in the Secondary school but there is no prize for English in the Primary schools, and I suggested that it would be suitable if you were to give one. He su^ested that it would liave an excellent effect if you were to couple it with a prize for Arabic and pointed out that the Education Committee had immediately matched the Imperial Bank's prize for English with a similar j^rize for Arabic, We came to the conclusion that a silver cup for English and a similar one for Arabic for the best boys at these subjects in any of the primary classes- would be most appreciated. He, however did not like the idea of the cups being competed for annually and suggested that they should go to the winners in perpetuity. 'dragraph 4/--- iW Hon. Lt.

O'C Tandy,On the 10th Inarch ecccxapanioa by the Political Agent and Shaikh Abdullah Jablr f who la In cluirge of Vw Education Departnent, I visited the five Boys' schools In Kimait f beginning wiUi the nost important one f the hubarlklyah where I was net by the Egyptian director of Education Ur, ?aha As Euefl. Ky visits to the various schools were necessarily brief and 1 can only record Inprcujlon*. In the Eubarlklyah Eohool there are boUi secondary and primary clashes f In the iiow&amp;a School tijere are only elementary classes and in the other three schools there are both primary and elementary clashes. There are three elementary classes, four primary, and five secondary. As at Bahrain the numbers dwindle very rapidly above the prlxaary classes. The first and second Secondary classes have from 20 to ad boys In them but In the third there are only two, in the fourth none and In the fifth two. There are however 5G Kuwait boys studying In Egypt mostly In secondary classes. It Is the Shaikh's desire when these boys' education is completed to make them teachers In the Elate schools and after that to dispense with the services of the Egyptian teachers and to send no nore boys to Egypt for education until they have reached the university standard. It remains to be seen whether any of the boys now being educated In Egypt will be willing to adopt a schoolmaster's career. I was told that nearly all the boys in tlw secondary school at Kuwait want to be doctors. There are thirteen Egyptian teachers now employed In Kuwait.

While I was in the United Kingdom I discussed with the British Council the question of the appointment of an Educational Adviser to this Residency. As the Bahrain Government have refused to assist financially and the British Council have only a very limited sum available for the h Persian Gulf in their budget it was decided in principle that such money as is available should be devoted to the cost of a short visit by a senior member of the British Council’s staff with the idea that if the Governments concerned agree he should discuss existing educational services with the local authorities concerned, have a look at their schools and make suggestions for their improvement and for the future development of education generally. 3. In pursuance of the above it is probable that Highwood, who for several years has dealt with educational matters at Cairo on behalf of the British Council, will visit Bahrain and if possible Kuwait in November. I should be grateful if you would kindly confirm that the Bahrain Govern ment will welcome such a visit and will co-operate with Highwood so far as is possible. They will not be called upon to bear any expense in connexion with the visit. 4. I had a talk with Highwood before I left London and he considers that one of the first essentials is to set up a teachers' training school in the Gulf so as to eliminate radually the present Egyptian influence in educational matters, think this is a project in which the Bahrain Government might well sympathise and I should be Interested to learn whether they have already any kind of establishment for the training of local teachers.

The figures for the Financial Year ended on 30th Septenfoer, 1947 show (i) an excess of £E 1247 odd over the corresponding period for last year, and (ii) an excess of £E 951 odd over our suggested estimates for the year under review* The explanation for the latter is made out as follows: Total of Estimated budget for 1946/47 £E 10,000 I&gt;educt : allocation for Furniture &amp; Equipment which it is advisable to keep separate - this being an asset and therefore realisable ••• ... 150 Add: Amount spent for Summer Vacation to Ras-el-Bar last summer, not allocated for, but which will, in future, require a special grant as it is expected to occur regularly 9,850 as part of the hostel’s life 416 10,266 Total Expenses for 1946/47 Actual amount overspent ••• £E 951 1) EXPENSES OF MEALS: Compared with the previous year’s this item shows an increased expenditure of over £E 400, but the hostel was authorised by you to increase the rations of meals. Economy mpy however be made - £E 2500 should be ample. 2) TELEPHONE TELEGRAMS &amp; POSTAGE: The cost of cables and postage amounted to approx. £E 22 during the year; the balance is the cost of Telephone subscription which, on the previous year was paid by Hamdi bey (probably out of General Expenses). This explains the consider able difference if compared with last year’s. Although much higher than our estimates, the sum of £44 spent does not appear to be excessive. 3) WASHING IRONING &amp; HOUSEKEEPING: An economy may be made. 4) MEDICAL EXPENSES: It is difficult to set a definite limit to this item, which is out of anyone’s control. 5) MAINTENANCE &amp; REPAIRS: The amount spent i.e. £E 144 instead of £E 100 estimated by us may not be extrava gant - but a f ixed allocation for this item should not be exceeded. 6) CLOTHING: In our opinion £E 1200 should be sufficient, prices are now lower, and students need not renew their wardrobe every year. 7) HOSTEL’S MAGAZINE: An entirely new item.Kuwait Jiq atel^ Budget - Estimates for the year 1947/48 Salaries &amp; Wages «£E 1250 Pocket money 1940 Students Living outside hostel 190 Expenses of Meals 2500 Telephone Telegram &amp; Postage 40 Washing Ironing &amp; Housekeeping 150 Transport 35 Medical Expenses 500 General Expenses 30 Entertainment 40 Excursions &amp; Sports 50 Library 25 Light &amp; Water 130 Maintenance &amp; Repairs 100 Stationery &amp; Printing 25 Schoolfees 265 Private lessons 450 School books 120 Clothing 1200 Rent 960 Hostel's Magazine 150 Summer Vacation 400 Purniture &amp; Equipment 150 ■71 10700 HE.

I feel n«w more strongly than ever that this is necessary, having regard t# the present movements in Arab countries and the uncertainty mf the future. | In the September number mf 'The Oil and Petrml' there was an article dealing with the cmmperatimn mf the Anglm-Iranian Oil Comp any with the Persian Education authorities, and a short account, with a picture, of their Technical School. From Arab merchants, who had travelled in Persia^ I heard praise of the Anglo-Iranian Company, in that it lifted many of the Persian employees out of the rank of coolie, gave them education, trained them' as technicians, and sent some on missions to England for engineering, and these returned to take part in the more specialised work on equality with the British engineers. There was, in contrast to this, criticism of the American Companies in Saudi Arabia, and of the Bahrain Petroleum Company which, it was stated, had done nothing to raise the standard educationally of the people of Bahrain, and seem* ed to pursue a policy of keeping them in the status of cfolies or junior clerks. ^ In Kuwait a senior member of the Company informed me that in his opinion the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had gone too far in train ing Persians to take part in the industry. “J There was a time when the majority of the peoples of these countries were illiterate and the western world, its ideas, its ^ industry remote, and the concessions for oil were as they still are only the concern of the ruling families. A sufficient sum in royalties to please and obligations to the people were outside their immediate interest. A little superficial knowledge would seem at first to support the idea that the state of civilisation is still very low, as indeed in most places it is, but literacy has increas ed, and above all the radiom has given knowledge of world problems, particularly of the rights of small nations and the independence of the Arab nations. During the war the right to self expression was popularised as a counter to Nazism by the Ministry of Informat ion as a weapon of war. The clock cannot be put back and, whereas once the exploitation of the natural resources of a country by a bi^ nation would have meant nothing to the vast majority of a back ward people, a great change has taken place. The whole of the :n Middle East is alive with the sense of its own rights and the dig nity of Islam as compared with what is said to be the materialism of the west, and they are conscious that oil is an important factor in European diplomacy. It is difficult to see how this can be counteracted as the power of the radio and the press is very great. But the Oil Companies should be alive to the dangers which surround them of a partially ignorant and often bigoted populace influenced by propaganda, and should try to harness the energy and feelings of the poeple by educational means, and so foster the goodwill which i; is essential for their own financial and p|rysical well-being. It must surely be a question of anxiety to those who have in prospect ^ the building of pipelines across the deserts of countries which are alive with political agitation, and they must realise how necessary it will be for them to gain the goodwill of these pooples. It may sound shocking to some to visualise the time when the Arabs them selves will be petroleum engineers, partners and perhaps eventually I owners, but this cannot be prevented once education has begun, and surely cooperation is a more civilised process that suppression. The development of the oil industry creates a change in the life of the people through the increase of wealth and the contact of the * contract of the employees with the manners and customs of the west. The descendants of Sindbad have nothing much t© be taught by the West about Commerce, but of technical skill, certain moral values, scientific thought, they have little knowledge. However desirable it may be that the Arabs should retain their primitive modes oflife, and hewever streng may be the efforts to retain them, it is certain that the West is stronger and the contrast, if wide, betweei the two is dangerous. The Companies, particularly the non-British must be aware that their only, protection against these dangers is tl snail uAits of the British Navy in the waters of the Persian Gulf. M It has been stated that the benevolent attitude of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company is one of the factors which contributed to Persian preference 'hen facing Russian demands. I am not able to Judge behing the fact of this. A bessori may be learned from Egypti The Anglo-Egyptian Oil Fields in the desert bordering the Red Sea have enjoyed a prosperous career., but with the opening of the new ^ Well in the Sinai Peninsula, thA Opposition in Parliament and in th« Press have since asked ^wrhy this Ancession should be given to forejp ers, and why should .Egyptians not exploit their jtmmxtx own oil. Arabic newspapers spread widely from Egypt and so knowledge of this new attitude will spread. If it is Great Britain’s duty to protect the Oil Companies *lon^ the Persian Gulf, then surely these large commercial concerns should,- in return for such help, contribute to the conditions of gSodwdll. • As a practical step towards this goodwill, a closer watch shou] be kept by the Companies on the progress of general and technical &gt; education, so that employment by the Companies does not conflict with the aims of the educational authorities. My attempts to arouss interest on the spot were on a small scale as I was of opinion that the matter is of greater importance than lies in my power, and is I believe the prime concern of H.M. Government and the directorates of the Oil Companies. I In Bahrain, where there have been threats to the Oil Company, a representative of the Company should be in touch with the Advisor, the Director of Education, and the Head of the Technical School. ^ He would be aware of the problems of employment as they effect (a) the general education and (b) the Technical School. Particulai ^ ly should he in (b) note the assessment of wages in relation to qualifications. The Company has hitherto given scholarships, and promises of technical demonstration. This last should be put into effect and amplified. The Technical School is not flourishing but reference is made to it in the Report on the Schools of Bahrain. Some small effort has been made and I believe there exists among the British staff a desire to do more. In Kuwait there is clearly a definite effort being made, but attention ts drawn to the points on the proposed Technical School outlined in the Report. In other parts of the coast where oil may be found the states are not so populous or so advanced in education, and there is therefore a clear field for a beginning on the right lines to be made. A heavy moral responsibility lies on the shoulders of the Companies for the moral welfare of boys and adults whom they emply. Welfare officers should be employed to keep the younjjer members from the worst elements of Western civilisation and guard them from a desire to break down the existing laws regarding drink etc. of the State. This wolld be a most important contribution to the morals of the State and its neglect a source of powerful evil. In Making these notes I have included hearsay criticisms as I have thought it my duty to record them. For any discourtesy or injustice to the Oil Companies, I record may my apologies, but the intention throughout is to make others aware of the changes and trend of events in the Middle East, which I pereeive from my own knowledge.

Subject: My Dear Sir Rupert, No # S44*S dated the local Education and the Kuwait Oil CoTruary » Please refer to your deirl-official letter P7th January, 1^48• 2 # I flrd It impossible to disagree with Hlghwood^ rraln contention - that the oil com'antes must encourage and assist the Kuwaltles to raise their general trend of education, and am fairly certain that the opinion expressed by a 'Senior member of the Company' Is not that of the Kuwait Oil Company Itself. This being so It does not s^em that any further comment on Hlmhwood’s first four paragraphs is n^c^asary 3. Again I agree generally with 'iiphwood*s fifth paragraph. The only way in which the emplovment policy of the Compary may hav® conflicted with the alms of the Fducational authorities is that boys have tended to leave school to take up employment with the Company before they have finished their secondary school course. The schoolmasters dislike this as it leads to excessive depletion of the higher classes of the Secondary schoolj but the Shaikh, on the 'other hand is highly in favour of it. He considers that education need proceed oo further than is required to fit a hoy to earn a living and be of some use to the company or to the merchant community. This point of view coincides so closely with that held by the boys, their parents, the merchant community , and (at any rate during their present expansion) the company, that I thinV it would be pointless at present for His Majesty*s Government to enter the arena on the side of the schoolmasters. Should the number of boys leaving school become larre enough the company might be asked to consider ma! ing arrangements for their part-time Fducatlon % up to school-leaving age while they are working for the company. 4. I have not discussed Highwood*s recommendations with the local representatives of the Company but I believe that they do emrioy welfare officers who attend to the needs in this direction of all 'Junior Staff' both Kuwaiti and Indian. I doubt if this is being done for the labourers• 5 5.

The second, ry section of this school is' well attended, the top classes are small but this is due to the fact that a number of boys who would normally be in the top clai~s are now in secondary schools in Cairo. I visited this school t ice. On ray second tour ot the school I was accompanied by the Political Agent. It is not easy tc five a complete picture of the standard of work, but I wa* satisfied that the boys were keen and their progress good. Their Arabic writing &lt;.nu composition revealed high stan ard and the English was good. There was j-reat enthus iasm for Mathematics - an. interest in this subject is common throughout Kuwait - na th*re w; s a beginning in Science. The History ••nd Geogr phy rightly centred aroua. the Persian Gulf and included the history of the neighbouring countries. The discipline of the boys was excellent. A small section, consisting of 8 boys oi the Secondary School, is tr ining teachers for elementary work; it is a i&amp;ost v luable departure from the ordinary school curriculum, and *111 provide the much needed ioc.l teachers.

The intake from the Primary school will create a larger school next year and the prestige o- ^ 1S school will be increased if the standards are maintained •nd there is no counter idea of sending boys abroad.

HIGH WOOD. lEth J«&gt;nu ry, 1The following are suggestions aacie to Sheikh -Abdullah Ben Jfcbir, Minister of Education* Taha el fcuefi, the Egyptian Director of Education, »as present at the inter view. 1. The Secondary School * (•) The nora&amp;l Secondary course should be continued to the end of the fifth yer.r clthough the cost would be high. The staff was probably auequate but some additions might have to be made. The boys could then complete their secondary education in their own country and there would be no need for them to be sent to Egypt to complete the fifth year, as was at one time the plan. The needs of Kuwait, however, for competent of ficials, and for clerical at*:ff with a good know ledge of English and Arabic, were very pressing and required a modification of the usual second ary course to suit this need. Alter the second secondary year there Should be a section devoted to modern studies, Dy which is meant extra English lessons. Arithmetic and Arabic, with some other general subjects n6 Feligion adcedi the destiny of these boys would be (i) to take part in Government administration and (ii) to cuaixfy for competent clerks for positions in the Oil Company. Another channel leaving the main stream of second ary education after the second year, would be the training of teachers for the elementary and primary schools (this has already been started). (c) The mein strelm of secondary students should continue to the fifth year. It ill be sa 11 In number but from this tould be recruited candidates fcr Indicia*, ssccnd&amp;ry school tochers, engineers etc. for the time-being, before a Training Col lege is set up, these candidates should be trained abroad, the most promising ones in England. 2. The standard of English was good but the potential abilities of the boys could best be exploited by the instruction given by a m u whose native language was English* sn Englishman should therefore attend once or t*ice a week to hold lessons in oral English at the Secondary School. 3, The Boda Schools are too crowded end are impeded and impede their own development. Ther« should be hh attempt to house each Roda in its own building.The Tecimicol ichooi, for which the Director of fcducHtion h« already put for ara pl&amp;jag acceptable to the Minister and to the Ruler 9 would require ee- aist-nce froa the Oil CcmpHny in the obtrining of Material?, and in supervising the technical studies.

The hduc-tion Committee^agree with -r. Highwood’s suggestion regarding the econdary School and the formation of a Commercial Class where the students will be able to obtain a better knowledge of Arabic, English, .rithmetio, Religion and other general subjects. In addition, they may learn typing, both English and Arabic. The period of study for this course would be three years after the primary school. Thus the eptt. will be able to prepare suitable for employment in different departments of the muwait Govt., and capable clerks for the company, as to the training of teachers, this has already been started, but the students to be admitted are to be students who have received their riraary School Certificates. 2. The Egyptians who teach English are considered by the Education department as quite capable to instruct in English and have been praised by r. 'Highwood in his report. 3. The Education Committee have already started to construct new school buildings. This will reduce the number of students in the now crowded classes and it will then be possible to separate the Soda classes from the primary ones. 4.

The Oil Company propose to set up some kind of a technical school on their own and apart from this are too busy with their own rapid expansion to be asked to take a close interest in local social and cultural developments for the present. With regard to the suggestion that an Englishman should give local lessons eeft once or twice a^ week in English at the Secondary School an offer to do this bf a British Council officer on leave from the Middle East Centre of Arab Studies has recently been refused. It is possible, however, that if the ground is carefully prepared a similar offer by someone with v/hom the local educational authorities are personally acquainted might be accepted. oOo CONFIDENTIAL NO.K/27 (93/2 &amp; 93/3) P ERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY BAHRAIN Dated the 5th May, 1948 Copy forwarded with compliments to:- The Political Agent, KUWAIT ^ gyv* rtumr •/' &lt; U‘: X&lt;D V \i \\ \ v * // ’LB’No.K/26(19/248) CONFIDENTIAL PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY BAHRAIN, dated the 6th Kay 1948 The British Council have made an allocation of £50 “for subventions for local educational organisations”.

Andrew, Esquire, Political Agent, Kuwait.THE BRITISH COUNCIL Immeuble Khalil Alamuddin, Rue Omar ben Abd el Aziz, BEIRUT. 22nd April 1948. Dear Sir Rupert, I refer to your letter of 27th March reference D.0.No.667-S with enclosure. 2. I do not find it easy to make suggestions regarding the £50 allocation without consulting the Directors of Education in Bahrain and Kuwait. However I put forward the proposal that as the science classes in the secondary schools are very badly equipped, wall charts dealing v.ith physics, chemistry and perhaps biology would be a very useful aid to the students in their studies. The proposal would include £20 each for Bahrain and Kuwait. I recommend that this suggestion should be forwarded to the Directors for their consideration. I have written to London asking if such charts exist for the purpose we have in mind. 3. In the schools I observed that there was a number of pictures of India and Egypt but comparatively little of the United Kingdom. In view of the main interest of the U.K. being trade, perhaps pictures showing the Port of London, Shipping etc. might be useful as a reminder to them of their relations with Great Britain. This might be an alternative or included in the first suggestion. i 4. With the remaining £10 I would propose: a. The .chool in the care of Father Anselm should receive a number of elementary English reading books. This school deals with a large number of the foreign community and Father Anselm has great difficulty in dealing with the different standards of knowledge. One or two pictures might be useful, i.e. pictures of educational interest. b. The other £5 might be devoted to purchasing the same sort of books for the school in Muscat if they are proposing to expand their English teaching. If not, perhaps the Persian schools in Bahrain and Kuwait might benefit from a purchase of small quantities of elementary reading books. 5. The sum allocated is small and it is not easy to put it to purposeful use, but I believe the suggestions do fill in gaps which I observed. 6. I am pleased to see that the suggested educational books are being sent for the use of teachers in Bahrain and Kuwait. Yours sincerely, (SGD.) R.W.HIGHW00D. Representative, Lebanon.

The technical school project was I know agreed, but I was hoping that the Oil Con^any would help and co operate, otherwise I foresee the difficulties I mentioned in ny report.

During the summer I have been in correspondence with Belgrave about the appointment of women teachers and I think all has gone fairly smoothly, and I hope the results of our efforts will be satisfactory. Ahmed el Omran has been here discussing his difficulties with the Egyptian ilovernment over teachers, and I think he has solved his problems happily. With Kuwait it is not so easy ax to keep in touch but I have learnt something of what is taking place and I think the information is reliable though I cannot give exact data; I have learnt it from more than one source. I have there fore enclosed a few short notes for your information in case these facts have not already been recorded. The very competent Director of Bducatien seems to be less securely seated and if he has trouble as he did at the end of last year it may be a nuisance. I do not feel very confident ©f the sagacity of the Education Council on holiday in Lebanon without the strong hand of Shaikh (laber, and I should not like to say what sort of women teachers they are collecting as the number of qualified people is very limited here as we have found at any rate among those who want t© go to the Persian G-ulf. as regards the Palestine refugees, I have always been of the opinion that the teachers from Palestine properly trained have been the best in the Middle East but here again I have no knowledge of the sort that have been selected and they with their wives and families ? some of whom may be employable, have the elements of an interesting problem within the State. I think I ought to draw your attention te these things, particularly this last. n Yours sincerely, Sd. R.W. Highwood. Representative, Lebanon.THE BRITISH COUNCIL, Beit Kurani, Sh.

To this end an Arab town has been planed for Ahmedi. I have not sounded the Shaixch on the subject, and there seems little I can do until the difference in policy has been reconciled. 2.

They might also perhaps say whether they agree with the remarks made on the accounts. If you see no objection, would you kindly suggest something on these lines . Col. A,C. Galloway, CIE., QBE., Political Agent, Kuwait.jr'FHtt IAN GULF RESIDENCY 9 BAHRAIN, 17th November, 1948. No. 161 (18/1V48) I have the honour to report that during ray visit to Cairo at the beginning or November, 1 paid a visit to the Kuwait hostel. This Is a building hired by the Kuwait Luucatlon department to provide accommodation for Kuwaiti students studying In Cairo. There are forty nine boys now housed there and they are In the charge of a Kuwaiti lanager. The British Council representatives at Cairo exercise a report to the Kuwait Education department containing an account of the expenditure Incurred and suggestions for future improvements. The Kuwait Education Department regularly make available the funds asked for, but never comment on the suggestions made, nor do thay thank the British Council for the Interest they take In the hostel and the assistance they *** afford It. The expenditure per student works out at present at about £ 260 a year. 2. Mr. bakelln of the British Council at Cairo informed me that a very good spirit prevails amongst the students living in the hostel and that so far as Is posslbla they keep themselves alaAf from the Egyptians and take no Interest In the political movements that cause so much ferment In the Egyptian universities and schools. When I visited the hostel, 1 was very much impressed by the general appearance of the boys and their good manners, and I certainly detected no trace of antl*Brltlsh feeling. I did not go Into details of diet and the like out the boys looked very happy and X understand that they are well fed and looked ^ after, The building Is an ordinary house not designed for a hostel, but seems to serve Its purpose well enough. Some money ought to be spent on Interior white-washing and painting. 3. Of the students, eight are attending universities and the others secondary and primary schools. Of the students at the universities, three are studying medicine and tha remainder commercial subjects. The Kuwait Government sent these boys to Egypt In the hope tnat some of them would adopt the teaching profession and replace the foreign school masters on which its Education agreement has to rely so largely at present, but It seems unlikely that this hone will ha fulfilled. 4. I am sending a c British Middle East Of fairly close supervision over the hostel and send an annual Bt. Hon. H.

There were three or four boys who had to be treated in hospitals and several others went to specialists. These expenses are made uo as follows: S* DoctorAs fees £.E. 728.205 Medicines 333.540' £.E. 1061.745 Medical expenses are certainly difficult to limit, but they often include supply glasses and dental and other treatment by expensive specialists. An account'for each student will therefore be kept in future so that a detailed list may be drawn up to the end of the year. Private lessons . Although these have cost more thap provided for they seem to have given in most cases excellent results. Since preparing these accounts we are informed by Abdel Aziz Effendi that you have authorised the following: 1) The allowance for the hostess magazine to be raised from £10 to £15 per month. 2) Ihe student's pocket money to be increased by £50 - bringing to £4 per month per student. This will increase the total yearly expenses of about £350. * We understand that you have also authorised the purchase of a considerable quantity of furniture.

BY BAG KU/7C0/2 30th May, 1S49 Dear Sir Rupert Hay, Kuv/ait Students Hostel Cairp^ 1 We have recently had under reviev/ the question of the Council's responsibility in connection v/ith the above. Cur association with the Hostel, which goes back to its foundation in 1945, is a legacy from the days when we had in Cairo a separate Middle East Office - as apart from the present Egypt Office which is concerned solely with Egyptian affairs - and our responsiblity in connect ion with it currently comprises the acceptance of funds from the Kuwait Government for subsequent payment to the Hostel Supervisor; making recommendations on financial control; checking expenditure and submitting accounts to the Kuwait Government; and generally advising on the running of the Hostel and reporting to the Kuwait Government. period of its establishment, now feel that the time has come when it should properly be relieved of the functions of banker and financial adviser and that the Kuwait Govern ment should consider the early employment of a qualified Accountant, or a firm of Chartered Accountants, in Cairo Ij to undertake the work that we have been doing in the last ! four years. 3. You are, I believe, aware of much of the history of this Hostel, and I am writing, therefore, to ask if you could consider an approach to the Kuwait Government on the Council's behalf supporting this recommendation? In the opinion of our Representative in Egypt, the administra tion of the Hostel is now Sufficiently well established to enable us to hand over the financial arrangements to a firm of Chartered Accountants, and we very much hope the Kuwait Government will agree to this course. In this endeavour, we should be very grateful for your guidance and assistance. 2 The Council, having seen the Hostel through the Yours ever W.H* COVINGTON Middle East Department Assistant Director, Lt.-Col.

British Residency, Bahrain, Persian Gulf. 21st June 1949.EPOCATION IN THE PERSIAN GULF. \ Following on the talk with Mr, Hussey of the British Council which we had before I left for the Persian Gulf /) &amp; I discussed education questions in the Gulf with all the British officials whom I met, Mr. Keight of the British Council at Basra who came down to see me at Kuwait, and with the local managers of the Kuwait dl Company and the Bahrain Petroleum Company, also with Mr. Woods Ballard, Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Sultan of Muscat. I give below my general impressions of the present situation and of some possible steps which might be taken to Improve it. These should be ready, with the reservation that my visit was a very short one and that I am in any case not an educational expert. Kuwait. There has been a rppld growth of primary education in the last year or two. This now covers some 2G0G boys and 10 0 girls. The teachers are largely Egyptian and Palestine . Arab. There are also some local teachers. There are only &gt; 60 children receiving secondary education. Great difficulty is found in obtaining candidates for secondary education ^ because comparatively lucrative Jobs in the Oil Company and in business are available to those with even the rudiments of education which they can obtain at the primary schools. Moreover, girls seldom continue their education beyond the age of about 12 because they normally get engaged or married at that age. There are some 90 students from Kuwait at Cairo University. They live in a hostel. The arrangement was I think originally made by Mr. Hlghwood of the British Council. The Kuwait authorities are satisfied with this arrangement and the Political Resident was favourably Impressed with the hostel when he recently visited Cairo. The Egyptian Director of Education told Mr. Keight while I was in Kuwait that it was his ambition to make Kuwait a centre of religious education in the Middle East. I mentioned to the Minister of Education, who is a member of the Shaikh's family, the possibility of appointing an English teacher to teach in the Secondary School. He first replied that the Egyptians and Palestinian Arabs who taught there spoke English so perfectly that this was unnecessary, but he later said he would consider the possibility particularly with a view to preparing Kuwait students for higher education in England or America. The Kuwait Oil Company have started to give extremely elementary teaching to a few of their local workers. I do not think there is any prospect of g ettlng a British expert employed by the Kuwait Government at any high level in their educational organisation, but if the British Council agree that it is desirable I think it might be worth while to press for the appointment of a British teacher. I suggest that it would in any case be most desirable for the greatest possible measure of contact to be maintained between the British Council representative at Basra and the Director of Education in Kuwait in the hope of our being able to guide the latter towards relatively efficient /educationaleducational methods and away from his Idea of concentrating on religious education. . In view of the political dangers to which students in Cairo are exposed It Is for consideration whether we should attempt to persuade the Kuwait Authorities to send their advanced students to the American University at Beirut rather than to Cairo. I think we should find it extremely difficult to do this and I am not at all sure that the attempt would be worthwhile. The main requirements at Kuwait seems to be that t ie Kuwait Oil Company should rapidly increase its interest in local education. The best method seems to be that the Company should concentrate on technical training and specialised education. They should begin v.ith aw apprentice scheme by which they would engage boys as young as possible and pay them as ordinary employees b^t in fact arrange for them to spend half their time receiving intensive training in work which they could subsequently do for the Company, thus replacing Indians and eventually Europeans. The most promising apprentices could be sent to engineering and other establishments in the 4 u *** . America to complete their training. Others might to the American University at Beirut if there were suitable courses there for them. I spoke on these lines to the local manager of the K.O.C. who recognised that something on these lines should be done as soon as possible said that the Company had only been prevented from d oing so already by their rapid construction programme which had taken up all their energies. I think we should press th London management of the Company to go ahead with plans on the above lines as quickly as possible. It is for consideration whether the K.O.C. should contribute to general education In Kuwait. would be advantage from the point of view of theirereral relations with Kuwait if they offered a few scholarships fit the American University at Beirut or in the U.K* and America for general purposes not connected with the Company s work, but on the whole general education should be the function of the state which is or will be receiving ample revenue from oil for the purpose. Bahrain. Educational facilities have been progressively increased and the programme for future envelopments seems •relatively satisfactory in relation to the size and needs of the population. Thre are about the same number of children in Primary Schools as at Kuwait. The Secondary School has about a ICO students, some of whom are receiving e teacher's training. The Director of Education i.* Rahr&amp;ini with some Egyptian and acme Palestinian ,rab fibers under him. Mr. Belgrave, the Brlti.h Adviser to the Shaikh of Bahrain, takes a very keen personal interest in all educational matters. The Seccndar; ^chocl . combined with a hostel at which boys from flying vill g and in some cases from other parts of the Persian J .‘l » it semevhat the same conditions aa in a boarding school in thlscountry. There used to be a British Director of Education but when the post last became vacant we •hsble to supply a new candidate and after some delay the present^Director was appointed. There seems no chance of changing this* arrangement. There f possibility of the appointment of a British teacher of English for the Secondary School and Mr. Belgrave is in /touchtouch with an English tsacher in Egypt. An attempt £■ was made to send students for education to Cairo in the same way a« is done froTa Kuwait but after a very short experience of this arrangement it was found that the Bahraini students were imbibing undesirable political ideas and they were recalled. A number of Bahrainis are now at the American TTniversity at Beirut where some of them receive teachers training. The Bahrain Petroleum Company has just obtained approval from 3 * s Head tffice to offer a number of scholarships to the American University at Beirut. It is also interred to senu 4^ Bahraini students to Nottingham University this year .or a teachers trainiri t courtu. IX' tnis experiment -s ^iccessful further students vijJ. be sent in future. In Bahrain til in LuY;elt one of the £r*at*rt difficulties is tc persuade bvth beys ?ue girls to continue their education long enough. Moreover, the teaching profession is not popular as compared with work in the Oil Company and other kinds of business. The Bahrain Petroleum Company appear to have shown rather little Interest in the education of local employees until quite recently. rJow f however, the local manager gives the impression of being miy convinced of the great importance cf training Bahrainis to fit thorn for higher grades of work in the Company. The Comoary heve organised general classes for some of their employees and have some rather haphazard arrangements for training apprentices. My Impression is that they could well intensify this ?,crk and start at aa earlier Lge. The grunt of scnolarships for the is satisfactory. More could be done in the direction of advanced apprentice or training courses in the B.K. and U.S.A. gator and the Trucial Cos^t. Owing to the complete absence of education in Qatar and on the Trucial Coast serious consideration should be given to the possiblity of progressively using Bahrain as the educational centre for these areas until they are able to set up educational facilities of their own. There would be some political difficulty in the case of Qatar wwing to the feud between the two Bulers. If this difficulty makes it impossible for Qatar education to be fccussed on Bahrain urgent consideration will have bo be given to the needs of Qatar for education since there is already a large influx of workers there and this will rapidly increase ever the next few years. The same will take place at 6 somewhat later stage in some parts of the Trucial Ccsst, notably Abu Dhabi, and Dubai, where oil is almost certain to be worked fairly soon. We must try to moke sure that these places go the way of Bahrain rather than the way of Kuwait. There is cne Arab Primary School, the teachers including a Palestinian Arab. There, are other schools for some of the Indian and Persian inhabitants who iorm the great ’majority of the population of the town of Muscat. Higher education is only obtainable in individual cases. The Sultan has asked for the services of some more Palestinian Arab teachers, particularly for Dhofar. Th-re seems to be practically no provision for the education cf the very numferous inhabitants of the Batinah Coast (sa.id on some estimates to amount to a quarter of a million) or for the large Bedouin population of the interior. The State has no money with which to provide /anyany large extension oT education* It is open to question whether Muscat should look for its higher education In the direction of Karachi, Bahrain or Aden (or possibly even Khartoum)* Karachi should probably be avoided* The Ruling Family of Muscat are already far too much out of touch with the Arab Inhabitants and this Is largely attributed to their Indian education* A similar Indian flavour In the education of a future M Intellectual 11 class would add to the danger of splitting the country in two. On the whole the most useful channel would seem to be towards Bahrain and the American University at Beirut* General* one of the most urgent requirements seems to be that the younger members of ruling families throughout the Gulf should obtain satisfactory education* At present one member of the Bahrain ruling family is at o university in America f having failed t&gt; obtain admittance to universities in the U.K* The sen of the Sultan of Muscat will probably go shortly to the American College at Damascus. Otherwise nothing in this direction is being done. It is suggested that a serious effort should be made to have one or mere members of each Ruling Family, inducing as many as possible of the Trucial Coast Sheikhs, sent tc receive a good Arabic and, if possible, later English education outside the Perrian Gulf* If the American College at Pamscus is a really satisfactory Institution for the purpose this might be best as a first stage until any of them are proficient enough at English to go to Victoria College at Alexandria or Cairo. While the present demand for ell kinds of labour by the Cil Companies continues there is unlikely to be much danger of the creation by unsuitable methods of education cf a class of unemployed effendia such as has poisoned the political and educational atmosphere in Egypt and Iraq. But this is a danger which must always be borne very clearly in mind. It is most likely to arise in Kuwait. A progressive Increase in opportunities for technical education^ in the Cll Companies will do something to minimise the danger* Sgd. B.A.B.

Meyer, that there are two guardians, Mr. Tilton for the first four and Captain Kendall for the last three. It seems that there are a whole host of boys trying to get into Millfield from Bahrein, but Meyer naturally does not wish it to become too Bahreini as an iiiiglish school can only absorb a small percentage of foreigners. In view of what Meyer has said I think one would be rather usurping the place of their guardians if one went to see the school for the specific purpose of reporting on the boys. I thought, however, I might go in a couple of weeks* time to see the school from the point of view of its suitability for Arabs in general and take the opportunity of seeing the boys from Bahrein.

During a recent visit to this country Hr. Audsley, Labour Adviser to British Middle East Office discussed the question raised in this Savingram regarding a contribu tion from the Kuwait Oil Company with Mr. Southwell, Managing Director of the company. As a result of this discussion Mr. Audsley minuted as follows: M The information given to me today by Mr. Southwell, Managing Direcotr of the Kuwait Gil Company, does not agree with Mr. Hoskin*s statement that the company has refused to make a contribution. They are sympathetic to the University and are in fAct considering a generous grant, possibly this year. One of their difficulties is that the Shaikh has stipulated tiiat he must be informed of dona tions of this nature and hat asked that grants for educa tional purposes should go vo^wards the maift^atne maintenance of the Kuwait Educational Centre for Boys in Cairo.* The Company do not welcome this course, although they recognise that the Centre may eventually provide a supply of teachers for the primary schools in Kuwait (the present teachers - about 100 - are nearly all Egyptians). The Company*s own needs will be met by training Kuwaitis for skilled and semi skilled occupations - courses are now in operation for M.T. drivers and hospital orderlies and others are being planned - and they contend that it may be quite 3 years before local conditions are sufficiently developed to contemplate any Kuwaitis reaching the necessary standard of education for admission to the University as under-graduates. It was added however that if the University started courses of technical training below academic level e.g. engineering occupations, foremanship (Mr. Hoskins hinted that this might happen) the company’s attitude might change but the Shaikh displays much sensitiveness in these matters and he would have to be consulted. In my opinion, the matter should be put into cold storage for a few months.” We are sending copies of this letter to the Chanceries at Beirut, British Middle East Office, Washington and Tehran.

But Abdulla Jabir agrees unofficially that this should properly be a charge on the Kuwait Government. 3. I agree with you that it is a pity to miss any opportunity of helping the Kuwait Government with our advice; but I am not sure that, now the hostel is estab lished, we are likely to get cuch value for time and money spent in doing their routine work for them. However, in view cf your remarks, I did not take the matter further. 4. If you decide to proceed with Covington’s suggestions we will have to refer the question to the Ruler officially, and it will help considerably at the time if we can suggest to him the names of suitable firms of accountants in Cairo with an estimate of their charges. He can then decide whether to entrust the work to them or to appoint an accountant from here solely to look after the hostel accounts. 6.

As you will see from it, we prcposeu to allocate the suk of £.20/- to Kuwait for the purpose of providing the schools there with maps etc. The Agency, however, now report that the Kuwaiti educa tional authorities have been unable to suggest any method of how this £#20/- can be utilised except by spending it on prizes. In these days of stringency we do not consider that expenditure of such a large sum for this purpose would be justified, and we pro pose to retain the bulk of the money in hand in case we can use it to better purpose elsewhere in the Gulf. At the sane tine, since we have raised the hopes of the Kuwaiti educational authorities, we would prefer to give them something and wonoer if you could allocate half a dozen books, suitable for school prizes, to Kuwait. If so, perhaps you would send them direct to the Poll tied Agent to whom we are senuing a copy of this letter, and inform us of the c&lt; st so that we can know how much we have in hand for expenditure else where.

CONPIDKNTIAL Dear Agency, u Kturuii kcc . ; The British Council have allocated two scholarships to the Persian Gulf for the academic year 1950/51$ this allocation is in fact susceptible of change and no exact figure should fee however be quoted. The award will be made for one academic year or for two, according to time required for the programme of work arranged for the scholar. The scholarsuips are primarily intended for men preferably between the a^es of 25 and 35 of graduate status or having equivalent professional qualifications, a candidate must have a sufficient knowledge of written and spoken English to benefit from the course of studies proposed. We enclose a co^y of the regulations in case you have a possible candidate. This frankly appears to us to be unlikely. At the same time the British Council^ instructions mentioned that these scholarsiiips may be converted into bursaries (by which we believe is meant at short cou.se of intensive study of some professional subject) ana we suspect that these would be more applicable to the Gulf. V.e have therefore requested details of the requirements demanded from bursary candi date, and 7t ; e will wi*ite to you aauin when v;e have got these.

Unfortunately we have none of the previous instructions on the subject of bursaries; and although we secured from Miss Caffrey the circular letter tfo.93 referred to in paragraph 6 of Circular 109* this does not give adequate details of the basis on which candidates for bursaries are selected, age limits (if any) amount of money granted, period for which they are granted etc. Coula you please send us copies of all the instructions which have been issued regarding bursaries?

It had been uecided to send no more boys from the secondary classes to Cairo but younger boys were being sent to tne Victoria College Alexandria. in this way the number of Kuwait students in Cairo would gradually decrease and in due course the hostel there would be closed.

GEN/164/2 Dear Representative, Short-term Bursary Scheme 1949/50 Please refer to circular GEN/1 64/2 of 22nd May, 1947 , and Circular Letter No. 67 (GEN/ 163 /l) of 31st August, 1948, S^k^ission of Applications , In the administration of the Bursary Allocation and of the funds accruing from the conversion of Scholarships to Bursaries, we are endeavouring to ensure an even flow of arrivals in the United Kingdom throughout the twelve months commencing 1st April, 1949, and, in view of the substantial and inevitable time-lag between the date of reception of application forms and the date of. the announcement of placings to Representatives overseas, it 'ill be of the greatest assistance if applications can be submitted ao least three or four months before the date on which candidates would be able to arrive in the United Kingdom, Accordingly, we shall not normally be able to consider for the award of Bursaries in the financial year 1949/50 applications submitted after October, 1949* This is particularly important in the case of distant areas 1 ram which travel to the United Kingdom is difficult to arrange. In certain cases we have already received applications from Representatives and these are being considered. This request does not affect in any way the provision mentioned in paragraph 6 of Circular Letter No. 67 in which it is mentioned that all proposals for conversion of scholarships to bursaries should be made when short lists of scholarship candidates are submitted to Students Department in January, , Persons covered by the Scheme . Whilst the Council desires the Scheme to be elastic, the Technical and Industrial Sub-Committee of the Universities Advisory Committee, on which employers and trade unions are both represented, have recently recommended a rather greater proportion of candidates from industry, particularly at the foreman level or below. It is realised that social or economic conditions in certain areas prevent the selection of artisan bursars and in those cases it may be expedient that the selection be made • from professional workers at a level rather higher than is possible in other areas. Usually, preference will be given to Bursars who will be able to perform their normal duties in British firms or institutions. P. T. 0. 9,324xji owl edge v.'f* English , it has been found from our experience in the past twelve months that a rather higher standard of English is required than was suggested in our circular of 22nd May, 1947. There are few sections of British industry in which a Bursar without a good command of the English language will be able to settle down happily for three or iour months. Accordingly it is requested that each candidate be tested for his knowledge of spoken English and preference be given to those candidates who may be expected to adjust themselves in a veiy short space of time to the conditions in Britain, Qualif ications and experience . The administration of the Scheme in the past twelve months has been considerably hindered by the lack of detailed information on candidates’ qualifications and experience. In order to facilitate placing, it is essential that the application form should contain the fullest possible details of the candidate’s day-to-day employment throughout several years before the date of the application, A note on the candidate’s educational background should also be included. otors » Though in general the type of Bursar we hav^ been receiving in the last twelve months has been very satisfactory there have been several oases of Bursars who, for personal reasons have been unable to obtain the fullest benefit from their stay in the United Kingdom, at as ol the utmost importance to ensure that each candidate is interviewed, if possible by the Representative himself, oi by a senior olficial of the Council, before application forms are submitted to Students Department. We suggest that at the interviews candidates should be acquainted with living conditions in the United Kingdom which, though accepted sympathetically by the majority of our Bursars in the last twelve months, have prevented one or two from appreciating fully what is of value in this country. Whilst we take the greatest care in acclimatising Bursars to life in the United Kingdom during their first^week here, there is always the danger that owing to the brevity of their visit, they may be unable to obtain any real appreciation of the finer points of our British way of life and may leave with an exaggerated sense of its minor inconveniences. Committees. In order that we may be in possession o relevant and^detailed information regarding candidates' qualifications and experience in their trade or profession and also to ensure that industrial candidates selected overseas will stand the best chance of acceptance by British industry, it is strongly advised that' candidates bo interviewed by a committee which includes the British Labour Attache and the Commercial Counsellor or Attache where possible The Ministry of Labour and the Board of Trade have already circulated ’ particulars of the Uhort Term Bursary Scheme to appropriate British officials overseas. It may be found that these officials if asked be able to suggest ways of finding good candidates. Hacj ng Conditions in the United Kingdom. The Technical and Industrial Sub-Committee have recommended th~t we should,where possible, provide overseas Representatives of the Council with information regarding placing possibilities in the United Kingdom Owing to the rapidly changing situation, however, we have up to the i- 3 - present confined this service to the provision of general confidential information to those Representatives who have made special application for guidance* The Bursary Section of Students Department is gradually accumulating information on placing and will be glad to provide general placing notes for those Representatives who request them# When rather more experience has been gained it is hoped to issue to Representatives a more general memoraiidum on the facilities which have been offered.

Dear Representative, 9th November, 1949. Further to Circular Letter No, 93 dated 18th March 1949 concerning the operation of the Bursaries Scheme, I should like to bring to your notice a number of minor changes and suggestions v/hich will affect the operation of the Scheme next year. These concern points of administration rather than of policy. With the expansion of the Scheme it becomes essential that the work shall now be directed along rather more f orroal lines and these points are intended to make for the smooth working of the Scheme both at home and abroad. for Bursaries in accordance with the Council's Financial Year (April 1st to March 31st), whether the Bursaries be secured through direct allocation or by conversion ol Scholarship money. To assist in budgeting for Bursaries it is very desirable that where practicable Bursaries should fall wholly v/ithin one financial year, though preparation for Bursars will often be made in the preceding year, 3» liming ci ...pplications . Unlike Scholars, Bursars arrive at any t; during the year buu it is naturally desirable that those from hot countries take up thoir Bursaries in such a way as to ensure that they are in the United Kingdom during the summer months. submit full applications from prospective Bursars a considerable time in advance of the actual Bursary period. Ideally, applications should be sent fairly regularly in order that there may always be, from any country, a short waiting list v/hich can be given preliminary attention from the point of view of placing and programme arrangement. 5. To retain the good will of the firms, public authorities and other institutions concerned in the reception of Bursars it is essential that they be approached in good time and the placing of a candidate should generally be effected at least three months before he arrives. Representatives are urged, therefor^, in uheir lirst approach to candidates, to make it clear that no promise can be given to them that a Bursary mil be available uny particular date but that they should hold themselves in readiness as far as possible to come to the United Kingdom when funds are available and places can be secured. number of applications in December or January on which preliminary action can be taken to ensure that the Bursars will arrive soon after the Financial Year commences in April. 2 , Financial Prevision .

Submission of Applications . Experience has shown that the more information obtainable about a prospective Bursar, the greater are the chances of good placing* Paragraphs 10 to 14 on the Bursary application form should be completed as fully as possible. It is of the utmost importance to secure from the candidate an exact idea of what he wishes to do in this country. 8 . The number of application forms previously used has been found insufficient and with reluctance it is necessary to ask that in ruture five copies of the application form shall be sent. Only one copy each of Appendix ’B* (Confidential Report) and of the medical certificate is needed but if there is long delay between the first application of the candidate and his despatch to this country, every effort should be made to secure a further medical certificate before the Bursar actually sets It should be noted that considerable difficulty is still being found in obtaining places for Bursars in the Textile, Eyeing, Motor and Aircraft Industries and also at Dockyards. 10 , Conversion of Scholarship Funds . Representatives are reminded that although the opportunity for conversion of Scholarships to Bursaries has been extended, proposals for such conversion must be submitted with the Scholarship applications in January. 11.
