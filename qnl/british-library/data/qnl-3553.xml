(6) Flying no flag, and the Commanding Officer of the warship has good reason to believe that the said vessel is flying the flag of any High Contracting Party without being entitled to do so, or is illicitly conveying articles covered by Categories I, II, IV and V, he may proceed to stop the vessel in order to verify the nationality of the vessel by examining the document authorising the flying of the flag, but no other docu ment. 2. Any vessel which presents the appearance of native build and rig may be presumed to be a native vessel. MC337FD255 3. For the purpose of verifying the nationality of the suspected vessel, a boat commanded by a commissioned officer in uniform may be sent to visit the vessel after she has been hailed so as to give notice of such intention. The officer sent on board the vessel shall act with all possible consideration and moderation. Before leaving the vessel, the officer shall draw up a proces-verbal in the form and language in use in his own country. This proces-verbal shall state the facts of the case and shall be dated and signed by the officer. Should there be on board the warship no commissioned officer other than the ^Commanding Officer, the above prescribed operations may be carried out by a warrant, petty or non-commissioned officer at the discretion of the Command ing Officer. The captain or master of the vessel visited, as well as the witnesses, shall be invited to sign the proces-verbal and shall have the right to add to it any explana tions which they may consider expedient. 4. In the cases referred to in paragraph 1 [a) hereof, unless the right to fly the flag can be established, the vessel may be conducted to the nearest port in the maritime zone where there is a competent authority of the Power whose flag has been flown and shall be handed over to such authority, but if such a port should be at such a distance from the point of detention that the warship would have to leave her station or patrol to escort the detained vessel thereto, the vessel may be taken to the nearest port where there is a competent authority of one of the High Contracting Parties of nationality other than that of the warship and handed over to such authority, and steps shall at once be taken to notify this fact to the competent authority representing the power concerned. No proceedings shall be taken against the vessel or her crew until the arrival of the representative of the Power whose flag the vessel was flying or without authority from such representative. • Instead of conducting the suspected vessel to a port as laid down above, the Commanding Officer of the detaining warship may hand her over to a warship of the nation, whose flag she has flown if the latter consents to take charge of her. 5. The procedure laid down in paragraph 4 may also be followed if, after the verification of the flag and m spite of the voluntary production of the manifest the Commanding Officer of the warship continues to suspect the vessel of engaging in the illicit conveyance of articles covered by Categories I, II, IV and V. 6. In the cases referred to in paragraph 1 (h) hereof, if it is ascertained, as a result of the visit made on board the vessel that, whereas it flew no flag, it was also not entitled to fly the flag of a recognised State, the vessel may, unless the innocent nature of her cargo can be duly established to the satisfaction of the Commanding Omcer of the warship, be conducted to the nearest point in the maritime zone where there is a competent authority of the Power to which the detaining warship belongs and shall be handed over to such authority. 0 '' 7. The authority before whom the suspected vessel has been brought shall institute a full enquiry in accordance with the laws and regulations of his countrv and m conformity with the procedure laid down in paragraph 8 below. warship' 8 enqUiry slia11 be carrieii out in tlie presence of an officer of the detaining If, however, the presence of such officer is impracticable owina to the duties upon which the warship is engaged, an affidavit sworn by the Commandino- Officer may m special cases be accepted by the authority holding the enquiry in place of th e oral evidence of an officer of the warship. 4 ^ PS. (a) In tlie case of vessels referred to in paragraph I (a) aLove, if it is proved at this enquiry that the flag has been illegally flown, but that the vessel is entitled to fly the flag of a recognised State, she shall, if that State is one of the High Contracting Parties, be handed over to the nearest authority of that State. If such State is not a High Contracting Party, the vessel shall be disposed of by agreement between the State responsible for her detention and the State whose flag she is entitled to fly, and, pending such agreement, shall remain in the custody of the authorities of the nationality of the detaining warship. (6) If it should be established that the use of the flag by the detained vessel was correct, but that the vessel was engaged in the illicit conveyance of articles covered by Categories I, II, IV and V, those responsible shall be brought before the courts of the State under whose flag the vessel sailed. The vessel herself and her cargo shall remain in charge of the authority conducting the enquiry. The illicit cargo may be destroyed in accordance with laws and regulations drawn up for the purpose. (c) In the case of vessels referred to in paragraph 1 (b) above, if it be established that the vessel had the right to fly the flag of one of the High Contracting Parties but was engaged in the illicit conveyance of any of the articles covered by Categories I, II, IV and V, the procedure laid down in the preceding paragraph should be followed. {d) In the case of vessels referred to in paragraph 1 (6) above, if it be established that the vessel was not entitled to fly the flag of any of the High Contracting Parties- and was engaged in the illicit conveyance of any of the articles covered by Categories I, II, IV and V, the vessel and all cargo carried in addition to these articles shall be seized by such authorities and disposed of according to the national laws and regulations of the authorities before whom the vessel has been brought. The destruction of this cargo may be ordered according to the same laws and regulations. (e) If the authority entrusted with the enquiry decides that the detention and diversion of the vessel or other measures imposed upon her were irregular, he shall assess the amount of the compensation which he considers to be due. 9. If the decision and assessment of the said authority are accepted by the detaining officer and the authorities to whom he is subject, the amount awarded shall be paid within six months from the date of the said assessment. 10. If the detaining officer, or the authorities to whom he is subject, contest the decision or the amount of the compensation assessed, the dispute shall be submitted to a Court of Arbitration consisting of one arbitrator appointed by the Government whose flag the vessel was flying, one appointed by the Glovernment of the detaining officer, and an umpire chosen by the two arbitrators thus appointed. The two arbitrators shall be chosen, as far as possible, from among the Diplomatic, Consular or Judicial officers of the High Contracting Parties. These appointments must be made with the least possible delay. Any compensation awarded shall be paid to the persons concerned within six months at most from the date of the award of the; court. 11. The Commanding Officer of a warship who may have stopped a vessel' flying a foreign flag shall in all cases make a report thfereon to his Government, stating the grounds on which he actec 1 . An extract from this report, together with a copy of the proces-verbal, drawn up by the officer, warrant officer, petty or non commissioned officer sert on board the vessel detained, shall be sent as soon 8$ possible to the Government whose flag the detained vessel was flying and to such of the High Contracting Parties as may have expressed the desire to receive sucb documents.

International Arms Traffic ConforGnce, GenGva» May—June 1925. Report by the Delegates for India— Major-General Sir P. Z. Cox, G.C.M.G., G.C.I.E., K.C.S.L, and Colonel W. E. Wilson-Johnston, C.I.E., C.B.E., D.S.O., I.A. TO THE RIGHT HON. THE EARL OF BIRKENHEAD, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA. My Lord, We have the honour to submit a report of the proceedings of the International Conference which met at Geneva in May and June of this year, at the invitation of the League of Nations, to consider the question of the international traffic in arms and to frame a Convention for its regulation. The Conference, in which representatives of forty-four States took part, and at which representatives of the Argentine Republic were present as u observers,' held its first meeting on Monday, 4th May; and the Convention was signed on 17th June. 2. We do not propose to record in detail the long-drawn-out discussions out of which, after six and a half weeks, the new Convention emerged; the reports which we furnished daily and the proves verhaux and other documents rendered by the Secretariat of the League of Nations' :i: * will no doubt supply such detailed information as may be desired in regard to any particular phase of the many questions discussed or to the views expressed by any particular delegate. We will endeavour to confine ourselves to a review of the course of the Conference's labours, and to some observations on, and a resume of the discussion of such of the issues raised as more closely affect India's interests in particular. I.—Preliminary. 3. The task set before the Conference was the framing of a Convention which should be acceptable to those nations which had either not signed or had signed but not ratified the Convention of St. Germain-en-Laye of I9th September 1919. That instrument, which depended for its efficiency on the general thesis that the export of arms and other munitions should be universally forbidden except in stated conditions, failed to be operative chiefly because of the refusal of the United States of America, one of the greatest, if not the greatest, of the armament producing countries, to ratify it. The lead given in this respect by America was followed by the other producing countries, and it soon became evident that the St. Germain Convention was * for all practical purposes dead. But the idea of a general regulation of the traffic in arms and munitions of war was too valuable to the cause of universal peace to be abandoned without a struggle ; and the League of Nations set itself the task of finding out whether the objections of the United States of America could not be surmounted. The story of what followed is recorded in the 'Brown Book,' C. 758, M. 258, 1024, published by the League of Nations. After lengthy deliberations, at which an American representative attended, not as active participant but as an observer, the Temporary Mixed Commission appointed by the League of Nations evolved, with the assistance, in regard to its more technical features, of the Permanent Advisory Committee of the League, a new draft Convention. This draftf formed the material upon which the recent Conference worked, in the main ; but as a result of the critical examination of it by the Departments of His Majesty's Government concerned, before the Conference * It is uridersfcood that the League of Nations will print and circulate extracts of the minutes of the meetings, in a form similar to that of the 'Brown Book ' dealing with the events leading up to the recent Conference. f See 'Brown Book,' pp. 17-25. 609 60 11.25Co-operation with the British delegation. India's particular desiderata. assembled at Geneva, the British delegation was able to present its views to the Conference, at the outset, in the shape of an alternative draft Convention containing the various amendments which, in the British view, were desirable in the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft. This document was treated, for convenience, as part of the material on which the Conference worked. (Whether this policy of laying the British cards on the table at th^ start was sound as a matter of tactics is perhaps open to question ; but on the whole, the disadvantage that each of the British amendments as it came to be discussed in turn, lacked the force of novelty, was more than balanced by the weight attached to the British delegation's obvious sincerity, as evinced by the frankness of the procedure that it had adopted.) 4. The India Office had taken part in the discussions leading up to the British draft,' as it came to be called, and was associated with the other Departments of His Majesty's Government in subscribing to its tentative provisions ; similarly, at Geneva, the Indian delegation was careful to work in the closest touch with the British Empire delegation, and to follow its lead closely in all questions which affected India only in her general position as a member of the Empire. On the other hand, in matters in which India has more direct interest than other parts of the Empire, the British delegates sought and availed themselves of the advice of the Indian delegation. The two delegations met practically daily in an informal conference, at which progress was reported and the means of dealing with the problems of the moment were discussed. As a result the two delegations worked throughout in a harmony which, except for two occasions on which slight passing misunderstandings arose, was cordially maintained throughout. 5. The telegraphic correspondence between the India Office and the Government of India, with a copy of which we were supplied, indicated that, while the Government of India would welcome and readily subscribe to the conclusion of a Convention on the general lines of the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft, there were certain points in regard to which they desired to secure specific provisions. These desiderata, as indicated in this correspondence, are :— (1) The reservation of the right to supply munitions to the Governments of countries, notably Afghanistan, Nepal, and Tibet, which border on India and whose readiest, if not only source of supply is India, even though these countries should be included in the 'prohibited zone' (to use the formula employed in the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft) or ' special zone ' (the more correct formula adopted for use in the Convention recently signed). (2) That, if Russia were to adhere to the Convention, but only in that event, the prohibited or special zone should include all the countries bordering on India, with the exception of Siam. It was recognised that if Russia refrained from adhering, the restrictive effect of the regulations contemplated by the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft for countries in the prohibited zone would be negligible, in so far as concerns at any rate countries bordering on the West and North-West of India, since these are coterminous with Russia also. This desideratum, resting as it does on a hypothesis which has not been, and is not likely to be fulfilled, has, of course, not been attained. (3) That, in the event of the prohibited or special zone not including such countries as Afghanistan, the export to such countries of the semi- military weapons included in category II of Article I of the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft should be forbidden, except under the same conditions as would have applied, under that draft Convention, to arms of category I; i.e. that these arms should be permitted to be exported only when ordered by and consigned to the Governments of such countries. (4) That Article 25 of the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft should be so modified as not to leave to exporting countries the right (granted by implication by the Article) to decide whether one or other party in a state of conflict in any part of the world must or need not. be regarded as a belligerent for the purposes of the rules of neutrality; and that the Article, even after such modification, should be made inapplicable to the case of war in the lk prohibited ' or special ' zones. fisciitj(i) The temper in which it was P 011 ''' t0 wticli the India Office attached, we understood, •considerable importance, though it was not specifically mentioned in the correspondence with the Government of India, was the assertion in the •Convention of the right of High Contracting Parties to search for and detain consignments of fire-arms or munitions in transit through their territories, when believed to be m course of illicit conveyance to a destination in another part or their tenitones, or m the prohibited or special zones. .? n ^ 0: ^ these desiderata has been secured in full by the new (Jonvention/** 11.—The Conference. I. From time to time during the period of the Conference divergences of view revealed themselves between various delegations, or, more often, groups of delegations, wide enough to justify the alarmist rumours that conducted, grew up, that a split was inevitable and that the Conference would break down. In every case, however—with the exception of the Persian ^delegation s stand on what was, in reality, a fictitious issue—the apparent impasse was resolved. That this was so may be regarded as evidence of the earnest desire that animated those participating in the Conference to show that it did not pass the wit of man to achieve a measure of agreement on so disputable a matter as the international traffic in arms, and of the real existence of that spirit of conciliation ' which was invoked so freely, indeed ad nauseam, in committee, sub-committee or plenary session. On the other hand, the Convention was signed on the spot only by eighteen delegations out of the forty-four present, and, though this number of signatures will probably be increased by the date—30th September 1926—to which the Convention remains open for signature,! it would be exaggeration to suggest that anything like unanimity was achieved or eyen indicated. The optimist, however, will note that the list of States whose representatives signed the convention includes five of the Great Powers, and, with the exception of 'Czecho-Slovakia and Belgium, the principal arms-producing countries. 8. That the Conference was conducted in so harmonious a manner was due, we think, in considerable measure, to the fact that to many of the delegates or their technical assistants the matters under discussion were ■ oft-trodden^ ground ; many had taken part in the lengthy discussions of the Arms Traffic problem in the Temporary Mixed Commission and Permanent Advisory Committee of the League; many were well known to each other personally, and their points of view on many aspects of the problem were no less well known. This familiarity with the subject under consideration and with others' standpoints created a friendly atmosphere, in which debate was carried on rarely with heat and never with any display of fanaticism, notwithstanding the fact that appeal was made from time to time to those humane motives that fanatics are apt to claim as their own. It may be suggested (and the suggestion is somewhat borne out by the number of delegations that abstained from recording a vote, even when decisions of the greatest importance were being taken) that the remembrance of the failure to bring the St. Germain Convention into force, and the experience gained in the proceedings of the Temporary Mixed Commission promoted a feeling that it was not worth while to press any point to extremity; and certainly a cynical view of the prospects of any real fruits from their labours was not difficult to find among certain of the delegates. Whatever the causes, the Conference was singularly devoid of any ' incident 't; and for this fact much credit is due to the President, Count Carton de Wiart, who handled the large international assembly in his charge with extreme patience and great tact. It is true that one heard the criticism that he allowed the General Committee to remit various questions to the minor •committees without sufficient direction as to the principles which were to be observed as guide by these committees; but we venture to think that he was wise to deal with the mass of often conflicting proposals, amendments, and counter-amendments that were put before the General Committee, by * For the attainment of tlie first and the failure to attain the third, fourth and fifth please see, respectively, paras. 84 (6), 47, 103-5 and 65. t See Protocol of Signature. + If the withdrawal of the Persian Delegation be excepted; but even this occurrence •caused no sensation.(ii) The foreign delegations, (a) The Ameri can delegation.

Count Carton de Wiart would, we think, be the first to acknowledge, and indeed in his concluding speech did handsomely acknowledge, the debt that the Conference owed to the tact and accessibility of its Secretarv- General, Sencr de Madariaga, without whose driving energy in the latest stages the Conference would have been even more protracted than it was. 10. Of the foreign delegations pride of place must undoubtedly be given to the American. The delegation was strong in numbers and no less in the- quality of its personnel. It was, moreover, in a peculiarly conspicuous position for two reasons: firstly, 'because the Government which it represented had been principally responsible for the failure of the St. Germain Convention of 1919 to come into force ; and secondly, it represented,, in a conference summoned by the League of Nations, the only State which has deliberately refrained, up to the present, from entry into the League. The former circumstance gave the American delegates a certain tactical advantage, of which they were fully aware; they knew that in order to win the signature of the American delegation to the Convention, or, at any rate, prevent it from being torpedoed prematurely, other delegations would be ready to concede a great deal on any point on which the former took a firm stand. The second circumstance may have caused them some moments of slight embarrassment, but, if so, they bore it with dignity and humour. Possibly with a recollection of the unfavourable impression created by American delegations at other international meetings at Geneva, the United: States delegates generally showed themselves anxious to understand, and ready to appreciate the point of view of other nations' representatives at the Arms (Conference in regard to phases of the matter under discussion which were not familiar to themselves. But all the time they were mindful of the difficulties which are likely to have to be surmounted before the American Legislature's approval and ratification of the Convention is obtained; and they were most cautious to concede no point which is likely to be regarded as important by American commercial interests, and to undertake no commitments in respect of any aspect of arms traffic which is not of : immediate interest to Americans. They were particularly careful to avoid any implication or responsibility in matters affecting the special zones ;; indeed, Mr. Burton stated that he had been much inclined to propose a division of the Convention into two self-contained instruments, one relating to the arms trade in general and the other relating to traffic in the special zones ; of the latter, he said, the American delegation would have been„ careful to keep entirely clear. Mr. Burton was perhaps the dominating figure in the Confereuce. A big man physically, with an appearance of age and ill-health that concealed' a quick intelligence and a vast amount of energy, he made his points with lucidity and emphasis. A deliberate, almost pondereus delivery lent weight to a style of oratory that was usually curt, and sometimes almost offensively so, but on occasion rose to a level of rough pulpit eloquence. Mr. Gibson, the second delegate, the United States Minister at Berne, filled admirably the role of foil to, or complement of Mr. Burton. The latter usually was spokesman when it was desired to beat down opposition ; Mr. Gibson when it was a question of graceful concession or of winning opinion to the American point of view—a task for which his urbane manner particularly qualified him. 11. The French delegation also was strong in numbers, and all its members possessed in a marked degree the qualities of skilled, if perhaps superficial debaters. What the French delegation's guiding policy really was, was hard to fathom. M. Paul Boncour, the chief delegate, a prominent politician of the Socialist Party in France, no doubt had a watchful eye on the political effect in France of his actions in Geneva ; he generally spoke vehemently, and on occasion with real eloquence, when supporting any measure that would appeal to Labour and Labour's intolerance of war. Nor did he—or the French delegation—confine their efforts to 'play to the gallery ' to speeches in the Conference ; directly or indirectly full use was- W ti7 made of the Press to advertise the French efforts in the cause of Disarmament and Peace-so far as these might be promoted by an Arms Traffic Convention --and whether under tne guidance of the French delegation or not, the French Fress did not refrain from misrepresenting the attitude of others for the purpose o showing the French position, by contrast, in a more favourable light, indeed, the British delegation found it necessary to reinforce itself with the services of a publicity officer, in order to combat these activities on on the part of the French Press. This desire of the French delegation to impress public opinion brought about a curious situation ; for under its influence the delegates were urging With all their power that the Convention must take cognisance of and deal with that most formidable engine of modern warfare, the aeroplane, at the very time that the French Government were expounding to the British -•Government, in connection with the China Arms Embargo, the theory (which the British delegation was energetically propounding at Geneva) that, since aircraft designed for purel}^ peaceful service are indistinguishable in their essential qualities from aircraft useful for war, it is impracticable to legislate for aircraft as engines of war. In regard to aspects of Arms Traffic Control which are a matter of less general public interest and offer less scope for advertisement, the French delegation showed less overt devotion to the general cause. 12. M. Dupriez, the chief Belgian delegate, had been one of the (c) The Belgian Tapporteuvs of the Temporary Mixed Commission, and was inconsequence delegation, much to the fore in the recent Conference. Having shown to his satisfaction that Belgium, though admittedly an arms-producing country, manufactures only weapons designed for personal defence or sport, he devoted most of his energies, as did his colleague, to obstructing any proposal that tended in any degree to limit complete freedom of trade in weapons of this description. The Belgian delegates did not sign the Convention; their reason being that, as the Belgian Government had just fallen, they did not feel at liberty in any way to commit its successor. 13. The Japanese delegation, of which M. Matsuda was the leader—a (d) Others: the lawyer who brought to the discussions in which he took part a notable Japanese, degree of precision of thought and diction—maintained a somewhat impassive kalian, and attitude, though in general they tended to support the British point of view s Panish dele- in questions of major importance. So did the Italian delegates, especially gatl0ns - in regard to the inclusion in the scope of the Convention of warships and aircraft, and on questions relating to the special zones; in this last connection the British and Indian delegations could always rely confidently ■ on the vote of M. Chimienti. Senor de Palacios, the chief delegate for Spain, proved himself an r admirable Chairman of the Geographical Committee, combining courtesy and patience with skill in fixing upon the essential point under debate, and preventing discussion from wandering too far from it. In the General Committee and in the plenary sessions of the Conference he displayed no less skill in indicating means for reconciling conflicting points of view ; and as Spain apparently had no particular axe to grind in the Conference, he was the more able to devote himself on all ocasions to the task of mediation. Of the other delegates and their general attitude there is no need to make particular mention, save, perhaps, of Tewfik Bey, the Turkish delegate, who in the closing stages of the Conference made no secret of his intention not to sign the Convention, which in his view went much too far in the direction of limiting the power of Governments of non-producing countries 4o acquire such armament as they feel desirable. 14. The Conference opened with a series of four plenary sessions on (iii) The course 4th, 5th, and 6th May; the Conference then resolved itself into a General of the Con- Committee (comprised of a single delegate—or substitute- from each of the fei:,e nce. participant delegations), by which the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft was discussed article by article, and amendments put forward by the various delegations, including those comprised in the ' British draft,' were debated on broad lines and referred for more detailed consideration to one or more of the technical committees set up by the Bureau of the Conference, namely,8 the Technical Military, Naval, and Air Committee, the Legal Committee, the Commercial and Customs Committee, the Special Zones or Geographical Committee, and the Drafting Committee, These Committees themselves appointed, on occasion, sub-committees of their own members, to consider special aspects of the questions remitted to them. A Co-ordination Committee was also appointed for the purpose of reconciling possibly divergent opinions that might be recorded by two or more Technical Committees to which the same question might be referred for consideration from different technical points of view. Unfortunately, less use was made of this Committee than might profitably have been. Special Committees were also, from time to time, appointed ad hoc, for the consideration of particular questions, such as that of the special treatment to be accorded to States bordering on Russia. The Indian delegation had representatives only on, the Military and Geographical Committees, on the former Colonel Wilson- Johnston and on the latter Sir P. Cox^ but it was possible to obtaim information as to the progress of discussion in the other Technical Committees from the members of the British delegation, which was represented on all. 15. The General Committee concluded its first reading of the draft Convention, after 13 sessions, on 23rd May, and then suspended its sessions pending the formulation by the various Technical Committees of their recommendations on the questions referred to them. In order to save time, these recommendations and the revised draft Articles embodying them were considered by the General Committee, which resumed its sessions for the purpose on 2nd June, in the order in which they were received from the Technical Committees, and without regard to the logical order and. sequence in which they were likely to be arranged in the finally revised Convention. For example. Article I, containing different categories of arms and implements of war, for which different methods of control are laid down in the subsequent Articles of the Convention, was one of the last to be received by the General Committee for ' second reading.' One result of this procedure was that the recommendations of the General Committee in regard to many Articles could, at this stage, be no more than provisional; the recommendations of the Technical Committees were therefore accepted or rejected, or still further amended 'in principle' only, and not, except in a very feAv cases, finally ; the decisions of the General Committee m the second reading were re-remitted to the Drafting Committee. It was generally expected, therefore, that a third reading of the whole completed Convention by the General Committee would take place ; but the Conference had by then, 15th June, been so unexpectedly protracted, that the decision of the Bureau of the Conference to merge the third reading by the General Committee into a final reading by the Plenary Conference was imposed upon the Jaded delegations without opposition, though not without some risk of complication at tlTe last moment in consequence.''' A complete draft Convention, together with some of the connected documents, was discussed by the Conference m plenary session on the evening of 15th June and during 16th June, and was adopted subject to various minor amendments; the incorporation ot these in the final text being entrusted to the Drafting Committee (with which the Legal Committee had by this time become practically nierged owing to the close similaritv of the functions exercised by the two). Ihe final texts, produced by the Drafting Committee during the night ot 16th/17th June, were taken as read by the Conference m its plenary session on 17th June, and were signed to the accompaniment of a series of final speeches in which the various delegates expressed their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the work of the Conference, and explained why they signed or refrained from signing any or all of the documents now put beiore- them for signature. * For example, the final text produced on 17th June for signature was found to ■ contain a different arrangement of the States in the list at the head of the PreamWe fro that which had appeared in the text adopted the previous eyemng. T ^. diminished the clearness of the relationship of Canada, India, and the Irish Fiee fe British. Empire, and also placed India last in the list of States members ^ Empire, had no real authority ; and the delegate for India had no t0 e beeil attention in a plenary meeting to a matter which would more conveniently ^ , •discussed in private. The incident was separately reported in the delegations telegra the India Office dated 17th June.16. It will be seen, from this brief resume of the proceedings of the Conference, that its task was carried through the concluding and prima facie more important and critical stages with expedition amounting almost to precipitancy ; this, however, mattered less than might be anticipated, since the principles on which the Convention is based were, in the main, thrashed out and agreed in the course of the first series of plenary sessions and in the first reading by the General Committee ; while the application of these principles in detail had been worked out in the Technical Committees, and approved in substance by the General Committee in the second reading. III.—General Principles for the Regulation of the Traffic in Arms. 17. The speeches delivered in the first series of plenary sessions made it clear that there was general agreement as to certain governing considerations which must guide the Conference in the task of establishing a control or regulation of the trade in arms. Of these, the most important were— (1) That the Conference must and could enact nothing tending to infringe the sovereign rights of any High Contracting Party. (2j That as it is one of the first duties of a sovereign State to take measures for its defence, care must be exercised not to impede the exercise of sovereignty in this respect by non-producing States, nor, by making the non-producing States dependent on the producing, to exaggerate the inequality of security that must always exist between these two classes. (3) That, so far as concerns the trade in arms between civilised States, the only practicable means of regulating it is full and prompt publicity of export and import. (4) That, subject to adequate arrangements to secure publicity for the trade in arms, there should be no undue interference with freedom of traffic and communication. 18. -It was tacitly understood that there are certain backward parts of the world in which control by means of publicity alone is inadequate, and that in these parts of the world a more stringent regime is required, even though certain of the above considerations may be somewhat departed from in the process of devising it. But the States that have a direct interest in the administration of these parts of the world are comparatively few. and it was natural and inevitable that the attention of the majority should be focussed on the more general question of the supervision of the trade in arms between civilised countries. 19. We shall endeavour to show how the general principles mentioned above were applied by the Conference ; and as the first step in establishing a control is to decide precisely what it is that is to be controlled, we comment first on the Conference's categorisation of arms, ammunition, and implements of war. IV. -The Categorisation of Arms, Ammunition, and Implements of War. 20. The Military Committee was the first of the Technical Committees to get to work ; it commenced its sittings on 8th May, under the chairmanship of General Sosnkowski (Poland). To it were referred, in the first place, Chapter 1 of the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft with the task of examining and, if necessary, revising the categorisation of weapons and implements of war which is adopted in that draft; and, in the second place, of making recommendations on the American proposal to control traffic in material for gas warfare, and on the connected Polish recommendation that with the question of gas warfare should be examined the cognate question of bacteriological warfare. 21. Issue was joined at an early stage on the question whether warships. The question of aircraft, tanks and armoured cars included in category I (2) of the the inclusion or Temporary Mixed Commission's draft should be omitted altogether from the exclusion from scope of the Convention. The French representative strongly opposed the convention of 6 suggestion on the ground that public opinion would be profoundly stirred warships, and of if it found that a Conference convened for the purpose of regulating the aeroplanes, trade in arms and believed to be making a long step in the direction of tanks, and disarmament, refused to take cognisance of such formidable engines of war ' 609 B armoured cars.10 Transference of all large bore pistols to cate gory II. The question of warships. The question of aircraft. as warships, aircraft, and tanks ; moreover, he pointed out. whether warships and aeroplanes were or were not themselves brought within the scope of the Convention, their armament must be. At the second meeting, however on 11th May, the Committee decided by 12 votes to 8 (with 20 abstentions) to- recommend the exclusion of warships, by 15 votes to 9 the exclusion of aircraft, by 12 votes to 9 the retention of tanks, and by 13 votes to 11 the exclusion of armoured cars. (The decision to exclude 'armoured cars was subsequently reversed in the General Committee.) 22. On 11th May also the Committee unanimously adopted an American proposal to transfer to category II (Arms capable of being used for military and other purposes) pistols and revolvers of a greater calibre than 6-5 mm. and greater length of barrel than 10 cm. (Later, on 14th May, the French delegate urged that quick-firing pistols should be retained in category 1; and this proposal was eventually adopted.) This decision is, no doubt' correct from the technical point of view ; but it strengthened the opposition which delegates from certain of the Balkan and South American States, as well as China and other countries which have had recent vivid experience of the almost military use of revolvers, &amp;c., maintained against the recommendation, at first strongly urged by the Belgian and American delegates, that export of these weapons should be unrestricted. The Belgian attitude was easily intelligible, the American less so ; but no doubt the private possession and use of revolvers in America is so common that they do not appear to Americans to be weapons trade in which it is worth while to attempt to restrict. 23. The French delegate w T as not content to rest under the decision adopted on 11th May, that warships should be excluded from the scope of the Convention, and developed the argument that at any rate the guns, torpedo tubes, ammunition, &amp;c., forming the normal equipment of warships would be subjected to supervision ; the implied consequence would be that warships would in fact be subjected to customs examination—a contingency strongly objected to by the British Admiralty and by the non-producing States that obtain naval material from abroad. To meet this difficulty the British delegate proposed that a note should be added at the end of category I that ' the foregoing enumeration does not apply to arms, ammunition, and appliances on board a warship and forming part of her normal equipment.' The British proposal was adopted on 19th May by It) votes to 8. 24. Still the French refused to rest content, urging that the decision would make not only possible but lawful a clandestine traffic in munitions (which might be conveyed b}^ warships in excess of normal equipment), and in component parts of warships -especially of submersibles. The British delegate offered to submit the draft of a special chapter dealing with warships. This suggestion was followed up with avidity, and the matter was pursued through private negotiation and by means of discussion in a special mixed committee composed of certain members of the Technical Military, Naval, and Air Committee, combined with others from the Drafting Committee. After protracted discussion, official and unofficial, in committee meetings and in chance encounters, of the highly technical questions governing the problem of subjecting warships to customs examination for the purpose of applying the requirements of an export licence system, an elaborate scheme was devised of publicity, but not, except in the rare case of the export of a warship in parts, of licence for the transfer of warships. The provisions of this scheme are shown in Articles 7 and 8. 25. A somewhat similar course was adopted in regard to aircraft. In regard to these the British delegates had from the outset urged total exclusion, on the ground that military aircraft are not in essentials different from non-military, and that the armament and equipment which, when in position, distinguishes the military from the peaceful air machine, was already dealt with. This view was supported throughout by the Italian delegation. The French, however, pressed consistently, on similar grounds to those which animated them in regard to warships, that it would not do for11 Conference purporting to regulate the traffic in implements of war to dismiss from consideration machines potentially constituting formidable engines of war. There is undoubted force in this contention, and in the further argument^ which was advanced that, in the backward parts of the world and in China in its present state, aeroplanes, for whatever purpose exported, tend to be employed, on receipt, for military purposes. Eventually, after the American delegation had suggested, hardly seriously, it must be supposed, that aircraft should be treated in a minor category entitled ' Aircraft and explosives; material of no military value,' a compromise was arrived at that the export of aircraft should not be subjected, like military and potentially military weapons, to a licence system, but should be subjected to publicity (Article 9). 26. As a result o£ these final decisions, two new categories, comprising respectively warships and aircraft, appear in the new Convention; while what was, in essence, category III of the Temporary Mixed Commission •draft becomes category V. V.—Chemical and Bacteriological Warfare. 27. The Legal and Military Committees were entrusted also with the task of examining and reducing to the best practicable formula the American proposal that ' the High Contracting Parties agree to prohibit the export from their territory of all asphyxiating toxic or deleterious gases, and all analogous liquids, exclusively designed or intended for use in connection with operations of war.' It will be seen that, unlike the Protocol finally adopted, this original proposal, confined, as it is, to an agreement for the prohibition of export, can without difficulty be accepted as falling within the scope of a Conference dealing with traffic in implements of war, Closely connected with this proposal were (a) the Polish amendment that the suggested prohibition should apply also to material for bacteriological warfare; and (h) a Hungarian amendment that such prohibition should not :apply to materials and implements for defence against such forms of warfare. The Polish amendment was accepted without difficulty but without formality ; the ensuing discussions came gradually to be taken to 'be in regard to chemical and bacteriological warfare ' : the Hungarian .amendment was, at a later stage, dropped. 28. The Legal Committee was concerned only with the question by what method to give expression to the American draft resolution; the •Committee could not agree upon this question, and submitted a choice of three methods : (a) an Article in the Convention prohibiting the export of the materials for these forms of warfare ; (Z)) a statement in the Final Act or similar document that the use of these forms of warfare is prohibited ; or (c) a similar statement in some suitable Article of the text of the Convention. With such meagre guidance the question arrived in the Military Committee for consideration from the practical rather than the formal point of view. 'The Italian delegation at once pointed out the practical difficulty, if not impossibility, of differentiating between the components of gases used in warfare from chemicals required for legitimate industrial purposes, and -consequently of giving effect' to the American proposal (with the general intention of which all were in complete accord) without seriously interfering with legitimate commerce. The Italian point of view was strongly held .also by the British Government, whose instructions on the point were given expression by the British delegation. At the same time all delegations were anxious, not only to avoid giving a rebuff to the American delegation in regard to a matter on which it obviously felt strongly, but also to take a definite step towards the prohibition of a form of warfare which all (the German delegate included'- 1 ) openly condemned. The Committee therefore adopted on 27th May the resolution given below, which emerged from a proposal originally put forward by the Polish delegation, as follows :—' The Military, Naval, Recommenda and Air Technical Committee, unanimously recognising that chemical and tion of the * The German delegate took an early opportunity in the Military Committee to renounce, in the name of his Government, the use of all forms of asphyxiating gas in war.

The French dele gate's support of the American proposal. bBctenologicaV warfare has been justly condemned by the opinion of the- civilised world, and to the end that this prohibition shall be nniversallv accepted as a part of the International Law binding the conscience and practice of all nations, considers that every possible effort should be made to- secure as soon as possible a universal Convention forbidding this warfare • considering that the prohibition of the export of chemical and bacteriologicai arms is, m most cases, practically impossible, and would moreover be of no- effect until all nations undertook to abstain from chemical and bacteriological warfare of all kinds, proposes that this larger political issue, namely, the prohibition of chemical and bacteriological warfare, should be considered by a special Conference which should be convoked at an early date and at which all States might be represented.' 29. This recommendation to the General Committee was not, perhaps, heroic; but in substance it appears to be correct, plainly indicating as it does that the control of the traffic in materials for gas and bacteriological warfare being impracticable, the question of the prohibition of such warfare should be tackled by a Conference with wider terms of reference than those of the Arms Traffic Conference. Its substance was , adopted by the rapporteurs of the General Committee, who submitted to that Committee a draft Resolution for adoption by the Couference, recommending that ' every effort should be made to conclude as soon as possible a universal Convention prescribing this export prohibition and dealing with the problem of the prohibition of chemical and bacteriological warfare.' 30. Discussion of the question was resumed in the General Committee on 5th June. M. Lohner (Switzerland) reminded the Committee that it was not the first time that an attempt was being made to prohibit certain barbarous aspects of warfare; he cited the Hague Conventions and the Washington Resolutions of 1922. Other speakers followed, some dilating upon the difficulty of effectually preventing the preparation of methods of chemical warfare, and the danger that a prohibition of export would merely enhance the existing inequality between the rich manufacturing States and others less advanced in industrial acquirements ; but all, with the exception of Dr. Lange (Norway), declaring their readiness to subscribe to anything tending towards the abolition of such methods. M. Urrutia (Colombia) did venture to deprecate the adoption of any pious but empty resolution to which the Conference had no means of giving effect. Dr. Lange, whose contributions to debate were usually marked by precision of thought and incisiveness of language, was of similar opinion to M. Urrutia, but went further and plainly expressed the fear that in time of war these pious resolutions would be swept aside and share the role of the proverbial paving stones; in his view they were useless unless and until war itself could be prohibited. 31. Mr. Burton (United States of America) would have none of this pessimism, nor of the procrastinatory tendency of the resolution before the Committee. His belief was that progress towards universal peace could be attained only by the will to peace, and would be hastened by reiterated expression of that will. He declared that it was not enough to prohibit export of material for chemical warfare, and urged that this Conference of forty-four nations should not lose the opportunity before them, of re-affirming previous resolutions, such as Article 5 ot the Washington Treaty, 1922. declaring the use of chemical and bacteriological warfare to he prohibited. He therefore proposed the opening for signature of a Protocol in this sense. If, however, this course did not commend itself to the Conference, he announced that the President of the United States of America would be eager to summon a special conference in Washington at an early date to consider the problem of ' outlawing chemical warfare,' to use the phrase of General de Marinis (Italy). 32. Many delegates responded to Mr. Burton's challenge, notably M. Paul Boncour (France), w r ho took occasion to point out that any resolution in regard to the use of particular instruments of war was really outside the Conference's proper scope, but, nevertheless, in a speech of genuine eloquence, declared his readiness to subscribe, in the name of his13 country, to a. Protocol such, as was suggested 5 lie took ])r. Lauge's point that to be effective such a Protocol siiould be reinforced by sanctions, arid declared that any State that in future employed chemical warfare should clearly understand that in doing so it incurred the hostility of the whole civilised w©rld. Other delegates hinted plainly enough (and no doubt the hints were not lost on the American delegation) that, whatever resolution might be adopted in general terms by the present Conference, Mr. Coolidge's offer to convene a special conference to settle the matter of chemical warfare should be accepted. The Committee unanimously (but with some abstentions, including Great Britain, Norway, and India) adopted Mr. Burton's proposal, and also a proposal by Dr. Tcheou-Wei (China) that the President of the Conference should ask the Secretary-General of the League of Nations to draw the attention of the League Committee for the Codification of International Law to the question of the rules of war and in particular to Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. 33. The task of translating the American proposal into concrete form was entrusted to the Drafting Coramittee, which finally evolved the text of the Protocol attached to the Convention. It was, we think, generally recognised that, judged by the strict letter of the terms of reference to the Conference, the formulation of such a protocol was ultra vires ; and for this reason the President was careful to explain that signature of the Convention involved no obligation to sign the Protocol, and vice versa. It was nevertheless signed by 27 delegates, including the British and the Indian delegates, after reference had been made to His Majesty's Government for permission to do so. VI.—The Export Licence System. 34. Articles 2 and 3 of the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft evoked (i) GoYerning considerable discussion of the questions of principle involved : — principles. (a) Whether the basis should he liberty of export subject to certain conditions or prohibition of export subject to conditions. M. Paul Boncour (France) and later his colleague, M. Clauzel, expressed the view that the question was one of form, and that the results, when the Convention was complete, would be much the same whichever basis were adopted. Lord Onslow concurred in this view ; but the French delegation urged that, nevertheless, it would cause an undesirable shock to public opinion if it were learned that a Conference sitting to consider the regulation of the trade in arms were to take as the basis of its work the principle that the trade should be free. M. Guerrero (Salvador) and Admiral de Souza e Silva (Brazil), who were supported by the delegates of many non-producing States, urged strongly that it would constitute an infringement of the sovereign rights of such States if they were, even in theory, prohibited from acquiring the material for self defence. The Turkish delegate, Tewfik Bey, indeed went much further, and urged that it should be obligatory for a producing country to comply with the requirements of a non-producing Government when the latter wished to purchase war material; but his view, which was held to imply an infringement of the sovereign right of producing countries to forbid export when it might seem proper to do so, received little support. Eventually the General Committee decided to recommend, as a direction to the Legal Committee, to which the question was remitted for further detailed consideration, that the basis should be freedom of export to Governments and prohibition of export to individuals. The Legal Committee adopted the guidance so given to the extent that prohibition eo nomine has disappeared from the provisions of Chapter II of the Convention. '(b) What should be understood for the puyyoses of the Convention by the term, a 11 recognised Government,'' to ivhich alone implements of war may be exported ? This question evoked a very considerable volume of argument, the non-producmg States contending that the phrasing in Article 3^ para. I,' ::: ' of * That licences are not to be granted except for a direct supply to a Government recognised as such by the Qovernvierit of the exporting country.iV' (ii) Application of the export licence system. (A) In respect of category I weapons. 14 the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft gave to producing countries unfairly wide ground for refusing export. Other delegates pointed out that conditions might arise in which, under the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft, it would be possible for two or more producing countries to recognise two or more Governments in the same country and supply them all with material for waging war on one another. Various suggestions for the definition of the term ' Government' were put forward; but the sense of the General Committee was that this was a matter to be left to the legal experts. The Legal Committee eventually came to the conclusion that it would be rash to endeavour to insert in an incidental way—which would be the only way open to them in connection with an Arms Traffic Convention— a definition of the term or enter into any detail; and it decided to evade the question. The result (Article 2) is not unsatisfactory from the Indian point of view; at any rate, since there can be no question that when arms are imported by Tibet or Nepal, the Tibetan or Nepalese Governments are the ' Government of the importing country,' it legalises the supply of arms to the Tibetan and Nepalese Governments. The first of the Government of India's desiderata has thus been secured. (c) What was the intention of the limitation in Article 3, para. 3, of the Temporary Mixed Commission s draft that a Government might only he permitted to import for its own use ? General Enckell (Finland) put forward an amendment designed to prevent a Government from acting as intermediary for the supply of munitions to recipients not contemplated by the Convention. Consideration of his amendment led the Legal Committee to recommend, on the suggestion of the American representative, that authorised importers of military weapons should include, not only Governments, but municipal or other local authorities (who may maintain armed gendarmerie), or rifle clubs, provided that acquisition by these is effected with the clear consent of the Central Government of the country and, in the case of rifle clubs, through its agency ; and to record the opinion (which does not, however, appear in the text 'of the Convention) that it would be an infringement of the sovereignty of the importing country to attempt to lay down what it may or may not do with weapons imported into its territory. It is therefore permissible for an importing country to re-export weapons that it has acquired, provided that the re-export is effected in accordance^ with the provisions of the Convention in respect of export. This opinion is perhaps of some value to India, which might otherwise feel some difficulty in selling or giving to Afghanistan, &amp;c., weapons other than those of Indian manufacture. 35. The necessity of some form of control-by-licence of export of arms exclusively designed for military use, which is assumed in the Temporary Mixed Commission draft, was not disputed. The questions raised, were of a subsidiary nature. The non-producing States expressed objection to any suggestion that they must be required so far to humble themselves as to apply direct to the Government of a producing country for permission to purchase. This difficulty was met by laying on the actual producer, the armament firm, or its agent, the onus of obtaining the necessary licence to export; but the obvious loopholes for clandestine trade afforded by this arrangement are closed by the provision that an order in writing ovei the signature of a duly authorised representative of the importing Government or Government of the importer's country must be presented when application is made for an export licence. licence' caused some difficulty, the meaning of the term 36. The word (B) In respect of arms of cata- gory II. for the purpose of the Convention not being in conformity with that legally attaching to it in certain countries. The use of ' export declarations has therefore been provided as an alternative means of control, subject to- necessary safeguards giving it the same value as an &lt;4 export licence.' 37. Article 6 of the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft leaves Articles of the second category free for export without licence, but imposes on the exporting country a somewhat vague responsibility of judging from the size V:,and destination of consignments whether tliey are not being exported for -military purposes, and, if so, of controlling them. The British delegation proposed an amendment making it permissible to export such weapons to .any destination or consignee, subject to licence. 38. In the General Committee the Venezuelan delegate, M. Parra-Perez, strongly recommended the adoption of the principle that the traffic in these weapons, which, though not primarily or solely designed for military purposes, were capable of military use, should be subjected to licence universally and not conditionally only. He argued that not merely was it the aim of the Conference to take a step in the direction of disarmament, but also it was its duty to let slip no opportunity for promoting the maintenance of peace and order ; he pointed out that it was precisely this type of weapon that revolutionaries and agitators, debarred from obtaining ■essentially military weapons, sought to acquire. M. Dupriez (Belgium) argued Belgian objection for the maintenance of the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft; he was, as to control of always, anxious that no impediment should be placed in the way of the ' s P ortin | f prosperous manufacture of sporting rifles and revolvers in Belgium, and wea P ons -' advanced the rather thin argument that the customs authorities of exporting countries would be burdened with the impossible task of discriminating between essentially and potentially military weapons if a licence system were imposed on category II. 39. • Lord Onslow rebutted M. Dupriez's arguments by pointing out that Great Britain did impose already an export licence system on these and all types of arms and found no difficulty in doing so; he reinforced M. Parra-Perez's contentions by indicating that in the Soudan and on the North-West Frontier of India it was the unrestricted export of these weapons that caused the perpetual disorder culminating from time to time in regular wars. Dr. Tcheou-Wei supported the Venezuelan proposal, which was adopted, by a majoritv-, as a guidance to the Customs Committee. 40. The American delegation had expressed no opinion at this stage; American but in the Customs Committee they took their stand with the Belgian su PPp rt of the representative on the platform that the trade in sporting rifles and revolvers el &amp; ian vi ew. is legitimate, and that a legitimate trade should not be interfered with; that it would always be within the power of a conutry that anticipated danger from their import to prevent or restrict their importation, and that, coupled with this indefeasible right of the importing State, adequate control would be established by publicity alone in regard to export of this category of weapon, and by the obligation on the exporting country to apply the control applicable to military weapons, when large consignments were found to be being exported. 41. But the representatives of countries, including the Latin-American Opposition to -countries, that had actual experience of the dangers resulting from the American unrestricted traffic in semi-military weapons, pressed their point that it w T as a ! ld Be ^ {an -essential that permission to export these weapons should be correlated to YieYil ' permission to import, though not necessarily in so stringent a manner as that adopted in the case of essentially military weapons. The American Correlation of delegation and the Belgian were to some extent convinced by the British export licence argument that some degree of export control was essential since, without it, permission it would be impossible for the authorities of an exporting country to ascertain, to im P ort * before it was too Jaie, whether export was taking place to such an extent as to warrant the application of the regime proper to military weapons. But on the question of the correlation of permission to export with permission to import they were not convinced by the representations of the delegates whose Governments either had had—like China—recent and bitter experience of the military use to which second category weapons can be put, or—like Great Britain and India—have constantly before them the menace which these weapons constitute to peace and order. It was only by a majority vote, therefore, that the Customs Committee recommended the adoption of a draft Article providing in its second sentence that '... arms and munitions in category II shall be exported under licence, or, at the option of the exporting country, under export declaration issued or endorsed by or filed with the competent authorities of the exporting country. In either •case, the visa of a duly authorised representative of the importing country16 Discussion in the General Com mittee. Decision against the correlation of export and import licences for category II. A compromise. must I dg obtained before permission is given to export these arms or munitions. And it was in deference to the feelings expressed by the American and Belgian representatives that the draft Article contained as its. third sentence the declaration that ' it is understood that either procedure (i.e. by export licence or export declaration) does not necessarily place any responsibility on the Government of the exporting country with regard to. the destination or ultimate use of the consignments made.' 42. The recommendation of the Customs Committee was in due course- considered by the General Committee, on 3rd June. In the General Committee M. Dupriez, the Rapporteur of the Customs Committee, took the unusual course of himself recommending the deletion of the second sentence of an Article recommended by the Committee of which he was the rapporteur and of whose report he was the author. He was strongly supported by the American delegation, who contended that the requirement, in this sentence,, of a visa hy an authorised representative of the importing country on every consignment of category II articles exported, was not only an irksome restraint on a legitimate trade, but might also be very properly regarded as an infringement of its sovereignty by a Government which placed no restraint on the importation of sporting rifles and revolvers into its territory. The American view was strongly contested by the British and French delegates, and also by the Chinese, who pointed out in an ironical speech that the commercial interests which the Belgian and American proposal sought to safeguard were apt to be the cause of the wars which it was the aim of the Conference to endeavour to prevent. The question of the deletion of this sentence was put to a vote, and on a show of hands the proposal to delete was negatived by 16 votes to 12, 16 States abstaining. M. Urrutia ^Colombia) asked for a recount; but the American delegate, improperly, as several maintained, demanded a vote by roll. Before his demand could be dealt with, one or two delegates, notably M. de Palacios (Spain), invited the President's attention to amendments which they had intended to move as soon as they learned the decision on M. Dupriez's amendment. A somewhat desultory debate ensued, during which several delegates left the room, as it was now late ; and after an interval the President directed (with questionable correctness) that a vote be taken by roll call, in accordance with the Americanv request, on the deletion or retention of the second sentence of the draft Article. This vote resulted in a reversal of the vote by show of hands and in a decision by 12* votes to lit (with 21 abstentions) to delete the sentence. 43. M, Dendramis (Greece) then formally moved an amendment to the effect that if the Government of the importing country so requests, the exporting Government shall authorise despatch to that country of articles included in category 11 only if the endorsement of the duly authorised representative of the Government of the importing country has been submitted to the competent authorities of the exporting country. This amendment Mr. Burton (United States of America) with unnecessary curtness at once condemned as totally unnecessary, and he expressed the hope, with rather undue emphasis, that the Committee would reject it out of himd as clearly reopening a matter which had just been decided. The President, however, ruled that as the amendment had been moved in due form he could not but accept it for discussion, and then adjourned the debate. 44. On the next day Mr. Gibson (United States of America) stated that the American delegation had no desire to cling to the victory of a decision reached by a narrow majority vote ; that they had, during the interval,, considered M. Dendramis' amendment and come to the conclusion that having in the previous session established their position in regard to the danger of enacting any encroachment on any High Contracting Party s sovereign discretion, they were ready and willing to include in place of the * Germany, U.S.A.., Austria, JBelgiuin, Brazil, Colombia, Denmark, Abyssinia, Italy, Panama, Salvador, Switzerland. f Great Britain, China, Egypt, France, Greece, India, Ireland, Poland, Roumania, Serbia,, Turkey.17 rejected sentence a provision to meet the appreheosions expressed by States which particularly desired close control of trade in second category weapons ; and he moved an amendment in this sense. Three amendments, Greek, Spanish, and Ainerican, were now tabled, all with the same object in view ; after some criticism of each in respect of form rather than intention, the Drafting Committee was entrusted with the task of resolving their common points into a form satisfactory to all. The performance of this task is seen in the second sentence of Article 5 of the new Convention. 45. We have recorded this discussion in somewhat full detail as the incident demonstrates— (a) the reluctance of the Belgian delegate to acquiesce in anything tending to restrict Belgium's prosperous manufacture of lethal weapons; (h) a similar anxiety on the part of the American delegation not to fall foul of trade interests in America, and a certain adroitness in concealing this motive under a, cloak of anxiety for the preservation of the sovereign rights of High Contracting Parties ; and at the same time (c) a real desire on the part of the American delegation to meet an unfamiliar point of view urged with sincerity and obvious justification by other States. 46. The final result is, we venture to think, not unsatisfactory from the point of view of India, which is enabled to reinforce the safeguards afforded by the Indian Arms Act by a check on the export of arms which are not allowed to be imported into India. 47. This sentence in Article 5 contains the nearest approximation afforded by the Convention to the realisation of India's third desideratum. That its realisation, in the form in which it was stated by the Government of India, was impossible can be seen from the second paragraph of Article 5, which deliberately absolves the Government of an exporting country from the responsibility of deciding, as the Government of India's proposal would have had them do, that this or that country, not included in the special zone, is an undesirable destination for second category weapons. Afghanistan is, we* understand, pledged by the existing Anglo-Afghan Treaty to observe the Arms Traffic Convention when it is ratified. If it should prove possible to induce her to observe this pledge, it might be no less possible to induce the Afghan Government to notify producing countries that second category weapons may not be exported to an Afghan destination except under an official Afghan endorsement. Similar action is no doubt equally or even more feasible in the case of Persia. If this should prove to be the case, the first and third paragraphs of Article 5 would, together, produce substantially the same result as that aimed at by the Government of India's third desideratum. VII.—Publicity o£ Arms Trade. 48. As we have said,' :i: ' the Conference accepted the principle underlying its imuor- the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft that any international agreement tance as the for the regulation of the traffic in arms must depend for its efficiency not on only 44 sanction.' 'sanctions,' since none could be devised, but on public opinion, which is *p av . l 17 assumed to be set firmly in the direction of disarmament and against anything endangering the maintenance of world-peace. The trade in implements of war must therefore be exposed to a full degree of publicity. So far so good. But several minor points of difficulty presented themselves. 49. In the first place, the non-producing States argued that the inferiority b .—Its effect on from which they inevitably suffer in respect of security would be immeasurably security, enhanced if their importations of weapons for defence were exposed to the full light of day, while producers enjoyed the shelter of a screen of non- publicity. (The representatives of the non-producing States spoke very earnestly; so much so, indeed, that certain of the producing States seemed to feel that their remarks, though couched in general terms, had a particular target; at any rate, the Czecho-Slovakian delegate felt it necessaiy to disclaim any bellicose intentions on the part of his Government, which alone 609 018 C.—Inevitable connection with publicity of manufacture. among eastern European States is a producer of munitions on a large scale &gt; Taking their stand by the text to which M. Dendramis (Greece) had spoken in the second plenary session, that the Conference must establish the equal treatment of all States, the representatives of the non-producing States urged that publicity in respect of export and import must necessarily drive them in self-defence to become producers themselves (a development repugnant to the general desire for peace in our time), or must be accompanied by an equal degree of publicity in regard to manufacture. So warmly did the delegates of importing States press this point tKat at one time there seemed to be a real danger of the Conference breaking down at an early stage. But reassurance was afforded to the non-producing States, and their fears were soothed by, particularly, Mr. Burton and M. Paul Boncour. 50. The former pointed out that at the present time every nation can and does, by spies and military attaches, make itself acquainted with the military equipment of its neighbours; publicity in respect of traffic in war equipment would therefore not really put non-producing countries in any worse position than now—indeed, inasmuch as information surreptitiously obtained tends to be inaccurate and alarmist, it might be argued that these countries would be safer if their neighbours were able to rely on really genuine statistics voluntarily and officially supplied. Nevertheless, Mr. Burton agreed that the equal security demanded by the non-producing States would not be attained by them until the producing States were pledged to complv with equal requirements of publicity in regard to manufacture. He created something of a sensation and a considerable impression of the humanity of the United States Government by asserting that publicity in regard to private manufacture of arms was already an established practice in the United States of America ; Government manufacture, of which he obviously could not make the same assertion, he stated to be negligible in quantity or importance in the United States of America. It is understood that subsequent enquiries elicited the fact that this American ' publicity of private manufacture ' is no more informative, though possibly more frequently compiled, than that derivable from the British septennial return of manufactures, or than the Belgian statistics from the Proof Establishment of Liege ; and reference by the British and Belgian delegates respectively to these two instances of publicity in respect of manufacture somewhat discounted the effect of Mr. Burton's statement. 51. M. Paul Boncour also adopted, to the satisfaction of the non-producing States, the poini of view that their just claim to equal security necessitated publicity in regard to manufacture of, no less than to trade in munitions ; indeed, he maintained, as his personal opinion, what had already been tentatively suggested by Mr. Matsuda (Japan), that it was a reversal of the logical order of treatment to endeavour to regulate traffic till manufacture was dealt with. It was noticeable, however, that M. Paul Boncour emphasised the importance of publicity especially in regard to the private manufacture of arms ; whether publicity in respect of nationalised or Government manufacture appears to one of his political tendencies equally desirable, or w T holly compatible with France's requirements for safety from her neighbours, was not evident. 52. The inclination which the Committee showed to arrogate to itself the right to discuss publicity of manufacture was cut short by the President, who reminded the delegates that, on the advice of the Co-ordination- Committee, the Fifth Assembly of the League bad decided that the problem of arms traffic must be tackled before the problem of arms manufacture, and that it was for the former purpose only that they were now assembled. But the conviction that the two are really inseparable was too firmly established in the minds of the delegates, especially those of the non- producing States, to be lightly set aside ; and as a result, after the discussion in the General and Technical Committees of various other modes of expression—^some emphasising the importance of publicity of manufacture to a degree that surprisingly cheapened the value of the work of an Arms Traffic Conference—the Conference adopted, as a solution, the Hi. y^ ent id f19 insertion of the prefatory words that appear in the first line of Article 6 of the new Convention, and the second declaration in the Final Act. 53. Publicity of export and import having been established as a fundamental principle of the Convention-to-be, and the connection between it and publicity of manufacture having been relegated for discussion as a side-issue not properly germane to the Conference's task, the more thorny questions remained of the application of the principle, of exemptions from its application, of the limits within which it should be applied, and of the organisation by which it should be applied. 54. The admission that producing States are less disadvantageonsly d . Exemptions affected by publicity in regard to traffic than non-producing countries from publicity.* encouraged the European States that border Russia and were formerly part # See also para, of the Russian Empire and which are a]l, as it happens, non-producing 103 (i). States, to claim that they have a right to special treatment. The delegates p, . „ for Roumania {M. Comnene) and Poland (General Sosnkowski) were neighbour to prominent in voicing their claim, which they supported by appeal to para. 2 Russia. of Article 8 of the Covenant; Russia, they argued, is or is feared to be a great armament manufacturing Power; Russia is not and is not likely to be bound by any of the principles underlying the Arms Traffic Convention, least of all the principle of publicity; Russia openly advocates the use of gas warfare ; Russia constantly adopts a minator}?- attitude to her neighbours, and her neighbours would be even more at her mercy than they already fear themselves to be, if they were compelled to publish their imports of arms and their suppliers to publish their exports. The General Committee recognised the force of this claim so far as to appoint a special Sub-Committee to consider it more fully and to examine the means for meeting it and the similar claims which were thereupon made by the delegates for Persia and China, two of Russia's Asiatic neighbours ; the Turkish delegate made no similar demand on behalf of his Government. This Sub-Committee heard the representations of the various delegations affected and recommended that the circumstances of the five European States immediately bordering upon Russia were such as to justify special treatment, so long at least as Russia remains outside the pale. Their The Special recommendations emerged from the Drafting Committee in the form of an Committee's re- Article which, while in no way infringing the sovereign right of any High commen a 10ns ' Contracting Party to publish whatever statistics of trade in arms might be required by its internal laws to be published, offered these five States an opportunity to make reservations, and a promise to respect their reservations in regard to their amenability to the publicity enactments of the Convention. The appearance of this draft Article in the General Committee at the second reading was the signal for the renewal by States bordering on the five States accorded special treatment, of demands J or similar treatment. The Lithuanian delegate was especially energetic in pressing this demand, urging that his country also was formerly within the Russian Empire and is even now only excluded, by the interposition of a very narrow strip of country, from the category of actual neighbours of Soviet Russia ; but Bulgaria and Serbia, and, after Serbia, Greece, were almost as emphatic in claiming equal treatment, though their claim has evidently less justification. Mr. Burton silenced their clamour in his most pontifical manner, pointing out that any extension to any other country of the limited exemption recommended, with great hesitation, for the five immediate neighbours of Russia, would lead by an obvious progression, of which sufficiently clear indication had been given, to universal exemption. The Article which now Reservatioiis appears as No. 29 was eventually adopted, the Persian delegate indicating permitted by that his Government might reserve the right to claim similar treatment. ■ Rr ^ cle 29 ■ The representatives of the five States named in Article 29 took, without exception, the opportunity afforded to make a reservation against the publicity rules, as they affixed their signatures to the Convention. 55. The risk that States granted this exemption might abuse it bv accumulating in the secrecy thus afforded stocks of munitions not only from High Contracting Parties that are producing States but also from Russia— a risk whose reality was perhaps suggested by the nonchalant attitude of20 the Turkish delegate towards the ' Russian menace'—is to some extent met by the provisions of Article 11, by which High Contracting Parties are bonud to publish their imports from non-contracting no less than from contracting countries. E.—Extent and # ^6. Discussion of the limitations within which publicity is essential if it nature of is to serve its purpose, revealed a considerable divergence' of view between publicity. the various delegations, and on the part of some, not least the Italian, of reluctance to undertake greater obligations than their existing internal legislation requires. 57. The Temporary Mixed Commission's draft (Article 7, para.'2) provides that export licences shall be subjected to publicity. To this provision objection was raised by many delegates, the Belgian in particular advancing the opinion, which was shared by the British delegation, that it involved an unnecessary and undesirable revelation of information of value to trade rivals and a violation of trade secrecy to which it would be difficult to get munitions firms to subscribe. A less criticisable and equally valid ground of objection was discovered in the Commercial Committee; it was argued that an export licence is merely the grant of a permission which may not be exercised for a considerable period after the date of grant, or even not at all; the publicity sought by the Conference must aim at a fairly accurate correlation of export with import statistics; and the inherent difficulty of this task would be much increased if the comparison were between licences on the one hand and actual importations on the other; in short, publicity must deal with actualities rather than potentialities. It was decided, therefore, that what was required was publication of statistics of exports and imports, drawn up in a common form and under a common nomenclature of items (Article 6, para. 1). Agreement on the requisite forms and nomenclature (Annex 1) was reached only after long and close discussion of a technical nature in the Customs Committee. 58. The periodicity of such returns was the subject of further discussion; the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft requires only an annual return, but it was generally felt that this would be too infrequent to be of much value. The Italian delegation recommended six-monthly returns, corresponding, it is understood, with_ the existing Italian practice in regard to trade statistics generally; the British delegation, on the other hand, had proposed monthly- returns ; but, the preventive purpose held in view in recommending such frequent publicity having disappeared when the Conference decided against t See para. 05. control of transit,t had little difficulty in falling in with the proposal for quarterly returns, which was eventually adopted. F.—Organisa- 59. One of the objections which the American Government had found to tion for ensuring the Convention of St. Germain was that Article 5 of that Convention, publicity. providing for a Central International Office (for the collation of information) placed imcter the control of the League of .Nations, involved the implicit recognition by the United States Government of the League and, to a limited degree, subservience to it. The Temporary Mixed Commission's draft endeavoured to meet this objection by limiting the intervention of the League to the establishment of the Central International Office, which, it was intended by the authors, should thereafter function independently. This concession, however, was not found by the American delegation to he sufficient to disarm the hostility which, they feared, would be shown by American opinion to a Convention containing even so tenuous a suggestion of League control ; they therefore suggested that the work of centralising and collating statistical and other information about the traffic in arms should be entrusted to an International Office to be established, preferably at Brussels, under the authority of the Council of Ambassadors. This suggestion, though the American delegation's motive in making it was fully understood and appreciated, did not much commend itself to the- representatives of States members of the League, and least of all to the * The British proposal was that ' a return of the licences granted in any one month shall be sent within 14 days of the termination of that month to the Central International Office.' Returns of less frequency would be useless as information regarding consignments which ii&gt; might be desired to detain in transit.21 representatives of the smaller States, who deprecated the incurment of ■expenditure on a new International Office performing work which could be undertaken for a cithe of the cost by the existing organisation of the League. 60. In the course of discussion in the Customs Committee it was observed that the statistical information desired in regard to the traffic in arms would lose much of its value if its publication were delayed, and that much valuable time would be lost in the process of its supply to and collation by a Central Office, wherever and however established. An opening was afforded by this consideration for a reconciliation of the American standpoint with that of other nations by the adoption of the expedient of dispensing with a Central Office and relying on each nation to prepare and publish (and by private arrangement, if necessary, exchange) the requisite statistics drawn up in the prescubed form. It is understood, however, and was made plain in the course of the last plenary session, that the Secretariat of the League will undertake, unasked and unofficially (as it already has done in legard to othei matters of international interest), the task of co-ordinating and re-publishing in collated form the information published independently by each High Contracting Party in respect of its trade (export or import, or both) in arms, ammunition, and implements of war. Thus, by the goodwill of the League, the Convention has been saved from any taint, offensive to American susceptibilities, of League administration; and yet the important duty of centralising information will not be neglected. VIII.—Control of the Traffic in Transit. 61. The Temporary Mixed Commission inserted in their draft an Article- no parallel to which appears in the St. Germain Convention—providing for the prohibition by High Contracting Parties of the transit through their territories of consignments of arms, &amp;c., suspected of being conveyed not in •accordance with the rules laid down. The Article (No. 5) went rather further than was desired by the British representatives on that Commission, who wished merely to assert in the Convention the right of a High Contracting Party to prohibit the transit of a suspect consignment. The question was very fully considered in the interdepartmental discussion preparatory for the recent Conference, and, as a result, a new Article 0 was evolved representing a compromise between the two main points of view, viz., that expressed by the India Office and Colonial Office in particular, that it was highly desirable that all nations should pledge themselves by means of an international Convention to turn to practical use information (of which there is an ample amount) of cargoes exported in an illicit fashion to objectionable destinations, and, on the other hand, that held by the Board of Trade and Customs, that, firstly, the assertion and exercise of this right would give other nations an opportunity for vexatious retaliation on the British carrying trade by sea (which is still the largest and an' object of jealousy), and secondly that where, as in the United Kingdom, there is a vast transit traffic, an undertaking to prohibit the transit of illicit cargoes was impracticable, and that to undertake what one cannot carry out is to ask for trouble. 62. In the General Committee the various criticisms that had been made in the Temporary Mixed Commission and in Whitehall of Article 5 of the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft were repeated by one or more delegates. The Swiss delegate drew attention to the extent of the obligations that * viz.; 'Notwithstanding the provisions of any international conventions dealing with transit, the High Contracting Parties, when they have good reason to believe that any consignment of arms, ammunition or implements of war in trat sit through their territory is destined for some other territory under their sovereignty, jurisdiction or tutelage or for any of the maritime or territorial zones specified in Article 9 and does not conform to the provisions of the present Oonvention, reserve the right to investigate the circumstances and if necessary to take the following steps :— ' Any vessel, vehicle, or other means of transport in which the consignment is suspected to he may be detained for examination. If any consignment is discovered which does not conform to the provisions of the present Convention, it will be treated as prohibited goods and dealt with in accordance with the laws of the territory in which the vessel, vehicle, or other means of transport was detained. If it should be found that there was no breach of the present Convention the consignment shall be released forthwith and handed over to its owner or his sigent. ' Any steps taken under this Article shall be car.-ied out with all reasonable speed.'' Objections.22 Importance to India of control of transit stated by Sir P. Cox. Statement by the President or the question for decision. _ would be imposed by the Article on certain countries, notably his own,, which form sectors on one or more great international routes, and urged the Conference not to impose on High Contracting Parties duties which they could not well perform. Mr. Burton (United States of America) strongly deprecated in the name of his Government any infringement of the principle of freedom of communication by sea—though he disarmed the obvious- criticism by admitting that the United States Government made an exception, and were firmly determined to maintain the exception in respect of liquor traffic ; and he frankly declared that the United States Government would refuse to undertake the immense task of holding up the volume of traffic through the Panama Canal for the purpose of searching for suspect cargoes of arms. Preference was expressed generally for the British amended Article over the original Article 5 ; but it also was subjected to severe criticism, by Mr. Matsuda, who dilated on the difficulties involved in legislating for search in transit and deprecated making any special provision in regard to it; by M. de Palacios, on the ground that though in a Convention purporting to regulate traffic it was difficult to omit all lefeience to transit, the object served by the British amendment was so restricted as to be al most a matter of internal legislation in the British Empire, not suitable for treatment in an international instrument; by M. Dupriez, on the ground that it seemed either to reassert unnecessarily existing sovereign rights which the Conference had no competence to touch, or by implication annulled the power of a High Contracting Party to detain a cargo in tiansio to a destination under a sovereignty other than its own ; and by other delegates on other grounds. The Italian delegate objected to the Temporaiy Mixed Commission's Article, and in a less degree to the British, on the ground that to go out of the way to justify the detention of vessels was tantamount to encouraging a form of action which, taken as it usually is only when a state of tension exists between Governments, tends to exacerbate an already acute situation, and on the ground, moreover, that the manufacturing firms ot tne detaining States would be afforded an opening for engineering unfan competition with foreign rivals whose goods they might contrive to get detained. Tewfik Bey (Turkey) went so far in his opposition to the Temporary Mixed Commission's Article as to move an amendment securing importing btates from any interference en route with consignments of arms which had duly complied with the prescribed conditions for export; and similar though less extreme views were urged by the Persian and Chinese delegates. 63. Sir P. Cox intervened with a speech in which he described the difficulties with which the Government of India and His Majesty s Navy had had to cone, in attempting to put down the illicit traffic in arms by native vessels carrying each a small cargo, difficulties which would almost entire y have disappeared had the right been clearly established ot searching m transit larger vessels suspected of conveying large consignments, at a point before their cargoes were dispersed among the smaller distributing agents. Some delegates seemed to show a certain reaction to this attempt to bimg the discussion back from a diffuse discussion of vague generalities to a consideration of realities ; but so many of the delegates who had addre=se themselves to the many different facets of the problem had tabled iormai amendments that the President suggested that the discussion, and the eventual decision of the Committee, should be limited to tnree questions principle :— (iV Was the Conference in favour of instituting control over consignments in transit or not ? (2) If so, should this control be obligatory on High Contracting Parties or exercisable at their discretion, ana (3) Should it apply to consignments in transit to any and every designation, or only to the limited category of destinations envisaged by the British amendment ? 64. This suggestion was adopted ; but when the discussion was resumed it again tended to become discursive, though the American delegate ma it clear that he would answer the lirst question in the negative, and the re delegate declared plainly that his Government would object to an Aitici establishing control of transit on three grounds are of a somewhat petty nature) : firstly, the probability of delay to g23 bat suspected consignments, leading to cancellation of contracts and interference with legitimate commerce; secondly, the probability of the ^exposure of trade secrets in the process of search ; and thirdly, the technical difficulty, froin the customs point of view, of broaching cargoes despatched under seal. The President then said he would allow the members of the ■Committee the interval afforded by the week-end to consider the question at leisure and would take a final vote on the three points of principle that he had stated. 6&lt; j . On Tuesday, 19th May, the vote was taken, the first question being Decision against putin a slightly amended form, viz.: — ^ control of transit. Should the Convention include proposals for the control of the transit of arms, ammunition, and implements of war ? The question was answered in the affirmative by 8 and in the negative by 20 votes—16 delegates abstaining. The new Convention therefore ■contains no provisions in respect of control of transit. 66. But as a concession to the doubts very clearly felt by many delegates as to the wisdom of this decision, a proposal made by the Czecho-Slovakian delegate was tentatively, and after consideration by the Legal and Drafting •Committees, finally approved, that a resolution should be adopted pledging the High Contracting Parties to apply their internal laws for the faithful execution of the intentions of the Convention. This resolution is to be found, in the form in which it was finally accepted, in the first Declaration in the Final Act. 67. The fifth of India's desiderata thus early failed to be attained ; but it may be observed that, leaving out of consideration the somewhat vague declaration in the Final Act, the discussion of the question did reveal a certain consensus of opinion that, dangerous weapon though it may be and difficult to legislate for, it is the inalienable right of a sovereign State to •detain consignments of arms in transit if in its opinion the public interest requires. 68. Further, neither the Geographical Committee nor the General Control of transit Committee nor the Conference in plenary session felt themselves to be adopted in the ►estopped by the vote on 19th May from prescribing an obligation to prevent special land zone, transit through territories in the special zone to destinations in those zones, except in guaranteed circumstances, and a discretionary power to prohibit such transit even to destinations excluded from the special zones (Article 18). IX.—The Special Zones. 69. The question of the special zones—a phrase adopted on the initiative •of the British delegation in substitution for the misleading term ' prohibited zones' used in the St. Germain Convention and the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft—received scant attention from the Conference in the early stages. The question, which is of little or no interest to many of the nations represented in the Conference, was remitted practically without discussion to the Geographical Committee^ with instructions to make recommendations as to the composition of the zones, (the definition of which the Temporary Mixed Commission had refrained from suggesting in view of political changes that had occurred in the regions concerned since the date of the St. Germain Convention), and as to the regime to be applied in respect of them. 70. But before even the preliminary stage of reference to a Technical Preliminary 'Committee was reached, there were signs that the Persian delegation reservations by intended to be much in evidence in regard to the question. Persian Thus at the very first meeting of the General Committee on 7th May, 6 e ^ a ^ Prince Arfa-ed-dowleh reiterated d propos de hottes the demand which he had made in season and out of season (as the ' Brown Book ' shows) during # Vice-Admiral A.

Cox (India), Prince Arfa-ed-dowleh (Persia), Tewfik Bey (Turkey), Dedjasmatch Guetatchou (Abyssinia), Dr. Tcheou-Wei (China).

Abyssinia's demand for exclusion. the sessions of the Temporary Mixed Commission, that Persia should not be- included against her will in the u prohibited zones.' His demand, based though it is on a wholly erroneous appreciation of the purpose of the- 'prohibited zones' and of the effect of the regime therefor, was warmly supported by the Turkish and Chinese delegates, who spoke as champions of the cause of full recognition of the sovereignty of Asiatic States. 71. Again, on 12th May, the Evince took the opportunity afforded by the President's announcement of the task entrusted to the Geographical Committee to move formally that the General Committee should at once decide the question of principle, whether a sovereign and independent State, Member of the League, can be placed in the special zone created by and for the Arms Traffic Convention without its prior consent. For this motion he had sought and obtained the support of the Greek delegate (M. Dendramis), who had hardly appreciated its portent. A discussion of it at this stage in the General Committee would have raised inconvenient, issues; and Sir P. Cox, after consultation with Lord Onslow, urged privately upon the Persian delegate that he would do well to postpone his motion until at any rate the Geographical Committee had presented its report, which might be of a nature to render his motion unnecessary. Prince Arfa-ed-dowleh readily fell in with this suggestion when it was explained to him that the British Government was prepared to support Persia's demand for exclusion from the special zone in return for an undertaking by her Government to co-operate in the suppression of illicit arms traffic, and that discussion of an arrangement of this nature was already proceeding in Tehran. 72. That the apprehensions of difficulties likely to arise if Prince Arfa-ed-.Dowleh had pressed his motion in the General Committee were justified, was seen when, in the first meeting of the Geographical Committee, the Abyssinian delegate opened the proceedings with a statement in regard to the sovereignty and equal rights of his country, obviously paving the way for a demand, when the time came, for exclusion from the special zones should they include Abyssinia. 73. The Geographical Committee, as a first step, ^ appointed a Sub- Committee to frame a definition of the special zone. This Sub-Committee,''* appointed on 13th May, did not complete its difficult and invidious task till 26th May, when it presented, as a basis merely for discussion, a recommendation that the zones should comprise :— (1) The whole of the Continent of Africa with the exception of Egypt,. Lybia, Tunisia, Algeria, Spanish territory in North Africa, the Union of South Africa,J and Southern Rhodesia ; islands neighbour to Africa within nautical miles of the coast, and also the islands of Principe, St. Thomas, Annobon, and Socotra. (2) The Arabian peninsula, Gwadur, Syria, and Lebanon, Palestine,, Transjordan and Iraq. (3) A maritime zone consisting of The blank spaces in paras. (1) and (3) were left in order that the Military,. Naval, and Air Committee might make proposals in the first instance, from the technical point of view. M. Clauzel stated at the outset that the French delegation had considerable- doubts as to the necessity of any special zones, especially of a maritime zone, but had, against their better judgment, suppressed these doubts in deference to the view of the majority. This first difficulty that had faced the bub- Committee had thus been evaded for the moment; but it was soon evident that the Geographical Committee had other serious fences to negotiate. 74. The question of Abyssinia's inclusion in' the land zone first engaged attention. Though this is a matter not of direct concern to India, its * Representatives of the British Empire (Lord Onslow), France, Italy, Turkey, and China, with M. de Palacios (Spain) as President. „ , _ . , t Including Sonth-West Africa, mandated territory. The claim of the Lmon Government that this territory, being under a (J mandate, should be treated as part of the Union and excluded from the special zone, caused a long and close argument between the British ana Portuguese delegates, the latter fearing lest illicit traffic with Angola should be tacilitatea. Eventually Lord Onslow won his point, M. Ferreira professing to be satisfied by the Union Government's assurances as to its internal arrangements for the control of arms traflic m Union territory.oousideration involved so much discussion, and its final solution involved the establishment of a principle so potentially important to the rest of the special zone, that it seems desirable to report on it at some length. Daring the sessions of the Sub-Committee the question had become a matter of four-sided negotiation, the British and Italian delegatious maintaining that to exclude Abyssinia would, in view of her peculiar geographical position, create a fatal breach in the special zone in Africa ; Abyssina, supported up to a point by France, maintaining, as Persia had before, that inclusion would deliver an unthinkable blow to the prestige of a State Member of the League of Nations. (The concession made to Persia naturally made the British insistence on the inclusion of Abyssinia appear more invidious.) The French delegation suggested a compromise—Abyssinia not to be included in the special zone, but to sign a Protocol binding her not to import or export arms without the joint consent of the three neighbouring Powers, Great Britain, France, and Italy. This arrangement, which would merely perpetuate the existing situation with its continual and often abortive correspondence on a three-cornered basis, was wholly unacceptable by His Majesty's Government and by the Italian Government. There the matter rested when the meetings of the full Geographical Committee were resumed. On 26th May Lord Onslow made a further effort to convince the Abyssinian delegate and the other members of the Committee that no diminution of the sovereignty of a State was involved by its inclusion in the special zone; that, if there were, the British Empire, which possessed more territory in the African zone at least than any other State, was voluntarily subjecting itself, in the common cause, to the disability; that the purpose of the special zone and the special zone regime was not prohibition of arms trade but additional control intended to assist Governments who had backward and unruly peoples under their jurisdiction, and that it was^ to- emphasise this point that the British delegation had suggested the substitution of the term u special zone' for ' prohibited zone,' in all seriousness and not (as a French representative had maliciously suggested) in an attempt to- sweeten the administration of an unpalatable pill. Sir P. Cox supported Lord Onslow in a speech in which he pointed out to M. Clauzel that the Government of India's efforts over the last century to cope with arms trade and piracy in and around the Indian Ocean had demonstrated clearly the necessity of a special zone, particularly on the sea; and reminded the members of the Committee that the special zone regime involved obligations not in a one-sided fashion on the States only that happened to lie within the geographical limits proposed, but also on all High Contracting Parties. The intention was to render aid to Governments whose authority was particularlv liable to be affected by illicit arms traffic. Members of tne League of Nations were not necessarily independent of such aid, and it was surely becoming that a Member of the League of Nations should accept, as it was incumbent on other members to render it. M. Matsuda (Japan) endorsed Lord Onslow's and Sir P. Cox's observations, but all in vain ; the Abyssinian delegation remained obdurate and the other delegates, it was clear, were reluctant to apply the coercion of a majority vote. American delegation, whose weight might have turned the scale, held steadfastly aloof, having indicated that they were deliberating whether or not to demand exclusion for Liberia, which for historical and sentimental reasons the United States Government had adopted as its protege. 75. At this point M. Chimienti (Italy) introduced a diversion. Abyssinia, he pointed out, had undertaken, at the time of her admission to the League of Nations, to be bound by the provisions of the bt. Germain : Convention; that Convention placed her in the prohibited zone ; was she not therefore, contractually bound to accept inclusion therein under the new Convention unless and until the League released her from the obligation ? The legal point was seized upon with avidity by M. Matsuda and other lawyers present, and a reference was made to the Legal Section of the League Secretariat; but that body returned an answer so cautious as to be of little immediate help. A road towards a solution had, however, been espied and it was followed with diligence. After protracted private negotiations, in which the Abyssinian delegation was brought to see that 609 D mmmamm26 The Abyssinian it was in a cleft stick, it agreed, witli some dignity, to make a deciaration Declaration,' binding the Abyssinian Government to undertake to apply internally all the Article 28. regulations laid down in the special zone regime, and requesting all other High Contracting Parties to take complementary external action, in return for exemption from inclusion by name in the special zone. 76. This declaration is embodied in the Convention, in the first two paragraphs of Article 28. When the Article was laid in draft form before the General Committee, Mr. Burton (United States of America) waived the reservation hitherto maintained by the United States delegation on behalf of Liberia, and proposed an additional paragraph, the substance of which was finally adopted for inclusion in the same Article 2S, enabling States included in the special zone to contract out of it on the same terms as Abyssinia. Mr. Burton did not, he admitted, consider Liberia to be as yet qualified to Application to take advantage of this provision ; but advantage was taken by the British the case of Iraq, delegation of the new contractual loophole to dispose of an inconvenient demand presented by the Government of Iraq, at an inconveniently lato stage, for exclusion from the special zone. Accordingly, at the moment of signing the Convention, Lord Onslow made a reservation to the effect that, in due course, when Iraq accedes to the Convention she will make the required undertaking and claim exclusion. 77. It seems not unlikely therefore that within a reasonable space the | special land zone w^ill comprise only a few small Sheikhdoms in Arabia, to ' which the International Arms Traffic Convention remains a sealed book. 78. It is, perhaps, permissible to speculate whether, if it could have been foreseen how the Abyssinian question would develop, and in what manner it w T ould be solved, it would not have been preferable to have turned a deaf ear to Persia's reiterated demands for exclusion from the special zone, and to have treated her claims precisely as Abyssinia's have been. 2 Difficulties ^9. It had been hoped that as a result of His Majesty's Government's with the Persian intimation to the Persian Government of their decision to support conditionally, delegation. or at any rate not oppose Persia's claim not to be included in the special zone on land, the Persian delegation would in other respects support or at any rate not oppose British proposals in regard to the special zones and the regime applicable thereto. The hope had been strengthened by the report from His Majesty r s Minister in Tehran that tbe Persian Government had accepted the British decision with gratitude, and had instructed the Persian representatives at the Conference to co-operate with the British delegation. But the hope was far from being realised ; the Persian delegates, encouraged by the success which had attended their importunity in regard to the land zone, gave a most liberal interpretation to the qualifying sentence in their instructions to co-operate ' with due respect to Persian integrity,' and proceeded, apparently under direct instructions from the Prime Minister then absent from the capital, to advance a series of preposterous contentions in regard to the maritime zone as they conceived it to affect Persia. Prince Arfa even enunciated in all sincerity the doctrine that the non-inclusion of Persia in the special land zone logically exempted Persia, the Persian Gulf, Persian subjects and Persian ships from all the other provisions of the chapters of the Convention dealing with special zones.* Recommanda- 80. The impending trouble first showed itself in a Naval Sub-Committee tion of the Mili- appointed to devise, on purely technical grounds, a definition of the maritime tary, Naval, and zone f or submission to the main Military, Naval, and Air Committee, to Air Technical wfrich the question had been referred by the Geographical Committee May 'to Sab- for technical advice (vide para. 73).

ClauzeTs remarks in para. 73 above.applicable in the maritime zone, put to the main Technical Committee the three following questions (Ij Whether the High Contracting Parties should have the right to visit, search, and arrest native vessels in the special maritime zone ; (2) whether this right, if conceded, should apply to the case of a native vessel flying the flag of a non-contracting party; and (3) whether Persian vessels come within the category of &lt;£ native vessels ' for the purpose of the Convention. To all three questions the Military, Naval, and Air Committee returned an answer in the negative/* 81. This decision was taken after a most unsatisfactory debate, in which the Committee, under pressure by the French delegates, decided only by a majority of 7 votes to 6 in an attendance of 23 that it was within its competence to reply to the three questions at all. Those who, including the British representatives, were in a minority on this point, and those who recorded no vote on the ground that they had no instructions on a problem sprung on them without warning, abstained from voting on the three specific questions, to which negative answers were therefore returned by 7, 8 and 11 votest to none, respectively. 82. In the Geographical Committee, therefore, the British and Indian delegations had to set themselves to recover the ground lost by what amounted to a ' snap vote ' in the Military Committee. 83. The first task was to obtain a reversal of the Naval Sub-Committee's Discussion in the recommendation that there should bo no maritime zone. Lord Onslow and Geographical Sir P. Cox intimated plainly enough that abandonment of the maritime zone Comm ittee. would be regarded by the British and Indian Governments as a matter of the utmost gravity. M. Clauzel, while declining to admit that he had agreed to the establishment of such a zone, thought that his Government would not object to it provided that the regime applied went no further than visit for verification of the flag, and that the secrecy of the manifest was respected. A Sub-CommitteeJ was appointed to consider the question, but at its first meeting§ made ilo progress owing to the successful obstruction of § 2llcl Juiie - the Persian delegate. 84. The main Geographical Committee then took a hand once morej| and Decision of the decided unanimously (the Persian delegate voting against himself by committeeIto inadvertence, or in the sanguine belief that Persia herself would achieve establish a exclusion) on the establishment, in principle, of the maritime zone. The maritime zone, questions of the limits of this zone, and the methods of surveillance to || 3rd June. be adopted within it were remitted to the same Sub-Committee as before, to which, however, a representative of India was now added. 85. In this Sub-Committee^[ the Persian delegate (General Habibullah ^^dusion^ Khan) at once objected to the inclusion in the maritime zone of the Persian the p ers i an Gulf and Gulf of Oman. A process of cross-examination elicited the facts and Gulf of that he did not know the meaning of the term ' territorial waters,' could Oman from the not distinguish between ' Persian waters' and the Persian Gulf, ' about zon e; half' of which he believed to be Persian territorial waters, could not 113rd June, p .m. understand what was meant by ' a maritime zone,' and could not see what its purpose was or that this purpose would be affected by the exclusion from it of the Persian Gulf. On the second question—that of the regime and of Persian —he maintained that Persian vessels in the Persian Gulf should be subjected vessels from the to no more restrictions than are English vessels in the English Channel; zone he could not be persuaded that to subject Persian vessels, or vessels flying the Persian flag, to visit for the purpose of verifying the flag involved no * Vide the Indian delegations' telegram to the India Office, 29th May. t These included, in each case, the delegates for the United States of America (though he had previously voted against taking any- decision), Spain, France, Persia, Poland and Rouniania (both of whom regularly voted as the French did) and the Serbian. The last voted in the interests of the small sailing vessels from the Dalmatian coast which trade into the Red Sea; these, not being ' native vessels ' in the meaning of the Convention, would not be amenable to the maritime zone regime, but, for that reason particularly perhaps, may constitute a possible channel for clandestine traffic. On the third question the Turkish delegate rallied to the support of a Persian claim, and the Brazilian and Chilian delegates roused themselves to follow the American lead.

Cox. derogation of Persian sovereignty ; nor could he be brought to recognise the implication of the fact that it was a measure to which other High Contracting Parties—France, Italy, Great Britain, and India—were prepared to submit their own vessels ; he could not see that if the Persian flag were- exempted from verification every would-be illicit trader would fly the Persian flag and the regime would be rendered useless. The Sub-Committee therefore accepted a general reservation on the part of the Persian delegate to whatever the Sub-Committee might recommend and proceeded with its task. It recommended the adoption of the definition of the maritime zone which is now embodied in Article 12(2). Turning to a consideration of the chapter (No. V) of the Temporary Mixed Commission's dratt laying down the methods of surveillance in the zone, the Sub-Committee recommended their adoption practically unchanged except for such verbal alterations in regard to the publication of documents as might be required to bring the regulations on this point into accord with the system adopted generally for publicity under the Convention. 86. A small point of difficulty arose, however, in regard to Article 15 (para. 2) of the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft. The British amendment suggesting that the eastern limit of the Indian Ocean be laid down as 95 0 E.' ::: ' aroused the French delegates to an appreciation of the fact that vessels belonging to the inhabitants of certain French territories bordering on the Indian Ocean Avould become subject to the maritime zone regime ; they therefore registered a formal reservation in regard to the applicability of this Article to ' ressortissants ' of French territory in India. 87. At the next day's meeting! of the main Geographical Committee Prince Arfa-ed-dowleh and General Habibullah Khan protested against the procedure adopted by the Sub-Committee, threatened to leave the Committee if the Naval Sub-Committee's recommendation against any maritime zone were not adopted as final, and put in a formal demand for the exclusion of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman from the definition of the zone, on the ground that unless this demand were conceded legitimate trade in Persian sailing craft would be exterminated by the harassing attention of British men-of-war, and Persia herself would be cut off from communication by sea with the rest of the world, so far as transport of arms is concerned ! The Committee took note of the Persian delegate's expressed intention to raise the question again in the General Committee, and, for itself, adopted the Sub- Committee's recommendation as to the composition of the maritime zone.t 88. The Committee then turned to the consideration of Chapter V (Temporary Mixed Commission's draft), and, during the discussion of Article 15 in that chapter, in regard to which Commander Deleuze had made a reservation as to the eastward extension of the ' Indian Ocean,' M. Clauzel enquired what, if any, was the ' southern limit of the Indian Ocean.' The members of the Committee got up from their seats and strolled about the room studying the various maps hung on the walls ; general conversation ensued, and Lord Onslow, it appears, after ascertaining from a British naval officer present that the parallel 10° 30' S., or even 11° S., would exclude Madagascar and the Comoro Islands—which was apparently the object of M. Clauzel's question—informed the latter that the British delegation would not oppose the adoption of this parallel as the ' southern limit ' of the Indian Ocean. M. Clauzel's enquiry was not answered except in this conversational way, and it was not indeed till after the meeting that the Indian delegation learned what had passed between him and Lord Onslow. 89. At a subsequent meeting J of the Geographical Committee M. Clauzel took occasion to state formally his reservations, pending instructions, in regard to the eastern and southern limits of the Indian Ocean for the purpose of defining the crew or owners of a ' native vessel ' ; Sir P. Cox formally opposed these reservations, having a lively recollection of the trouble caused twenty or more years ago in the Persian Gulf by Arab dhows of Madagascan and Comoro registration, which eventually resulted in the Hague Arbitration Case. * The object of this amendment was to avoid the unnecessary inclusion of Siam and the Dutch East Indies, native vessels from which do not penetrate tbe proposed maritime zone; t But before doing so it so far deferred to the Persian contentions as to seek and obtain a decision from the Legal Section of the League of Nations Secretariat that the waters of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman are, generally speaking, ' high seas.'29 90. At a later stage* the French delegation withdrew their reservation in * Sub-Committee, regard to the native vessels from French possessions in India. As it had at llth J f ne - that date become important not to forfeit the rather uncertain support of the French delegate in attempting to breakdown the Persian delegate's obduracy, Sir P. Oox, deprived as the Indian delegation was of any support by the British delegate in this matter, decided to withdraw his opposition to the French reservation in regard to Madagascar and the Comoro Islands. For the purpose of defining native vessels, therefore, the Indian Ocean, it is decided (Article 20 of the Convention), ceases to exist at 11° South.j' 91. It would be tedious to relate in detail the further contentions of the Persian delegation; indeed, we fear that we have gone to undue length already in attempting to indicate the extent and depth of the ignorance, unintelligence, and obstinacy which characterised the Persian delegates, and which was the ultimate cause of the regrettable denouement. Suffice it to say that on 8th June (morning session) Prince Arfa proposed an amendment specifically excluding Persian vessels from the category of ' native vessels ' ; Persian amend- after a discussion on the usual lines the amendment was carried by five votes ment to exclude to three, the Persian vote being supplemented as usual by the Turkish and Persian vessels Chinese, and on this occasion, for some inexplicable reason, by the Portuguese 5^ of ® native and Belgian^ delegates ; Italy alone voted, with Great Britain and India, vessels' carried, against the amendment. No one else took the trouble to record a vote either way on a matter of which they were now heartily tired, and which they had come to regard in the light of a duel between the Indian and Persian delegations, with the British occasionally intervening. Sir P. Cox Protest by the stated at once that if the result of this vote were maintained, India could Indian and not be expected to adhere to a Convention so much less effective than British dele- existing agreements ; Lord Onslow made a similar statement; and the effect ga es ' was to galvanise M. Clauzel into suggesting that the Committee need not consider the decision a final one if a better solution could be found. 92. During the interval before the afternoon session, various delegations A suggested were sounded privately, and it was found that little or no opposition compromise, would be made to a proposal which had been mooted between the British and Indian delegations as possibly indicating a means of meeting the Persians without irreparably damaging the Convention, namely, to delete the term 'native vessel,' and also the definition of the term, and make the maritime zone regime applicable to all vessels of under 500 tons, whatever their nationality or origin. Lord Onslow, therefore, formally moved this amendment. Sir P. Cox seconded the proposal, and urged the delegates to try for a moment to get away from the peaceful atmosphere of Geneva in which they were considering the question, and endeavour to realise the conditions of perpetual turbulence and disorder which prevailed in the area for which they were legislating. He drew attention to the report in the Press a couple of days before of a serious rising in Persian Baluchistan by tribesmen who, armed with rifles illicitly obtained, were besieging a Persian force, and had already annihilated a column of regular Persian troops. He reminded the Committee that one of tne purposes of the Conference, and from tbe point of view of the Government of India the main purpose, was to bring up to date and tighten the control over illicit arms traffic which was afforded by existing instruments, such as the Brussels Act. The vote taken at the morning's meeting marked so distinctly retrograde a step towards relaxation of control that he felt sure that unless it were moditied by some means such as Lord Onslow had suggested, India could not adhere to a Convention so damaging to her particular interests. 93. The Persian delegate, who had not hitherto been present, now arrived, Persian objec- .and the proposal was explained to him. He raised several objections ; not tions to the compromise. f After the signature of the Convention Sir P. Cox inquired of M. Clauzel whether he was at liberty to explain the French point of view in regard to the southern limit of the Indian Ocean. M. Clauzel said that he had acted on definite instructions from the French Government, which had referred the question to the Governor of Madagascar. M. Clauzel opined that the Governor had been actuated simply by a somewhat narrow desire to oppose anything derogatory to the prestige of his charge. + it is possible that M. Dupriez's vote was inspired by pique at some strictures earlier in the same meeting on his opposition to other provisions in the special zone regime.30 Practical diffi culties foreseen by the Drafting Committee.

Discussion in the General Com mittee. the least of his difficulties was that he had just sent off a five-page telegram ^ 0 i ^ an re P or tiE8' his success at the morning's meeting, and now was asked to abandon his victory, and inform his Government that the whole question was reopened. Mr. Gibson, speaking as the representative of a Government not directly concerned in the immediate issue, solemnly urged him ^ not to reject the solution now offered without the most serious consideration. The French delegate spoke in a similar sense, but Tewfik Bey (Turkey) and Dr. Tcheou-Wei (China) supported .Prince Arfa-ed-dowlel/s argument that the present proposal, being, in effect, a reopening of a question decided by a formal vote, was out of order. Eventually, the Prince, seeing that he would be outvoted at the moment, made a formal reservation of his right to demand further consideration in the General Committee, and withdrew. M. Dendramis urged the Committee to record its unanimous approval of the British suggestion, and this was done. 94. The consequential re-drafting of the chapter on the maritime zone regime was left to the Drafting Committee. Fortunately or unfortunately this Committee, in the course of executing this task, found or envisaged such possibilities of friction in the application of the regime to all vessels of under 500 tons that it asked that the Geographical Committee, whicji had, it had believed, completed its work at the afternoon session on »th June, should be re-convened to reconsider the matter yet again. ' The Geographical Committee met therefore once more on the morning of 11th June, but finding it impossible to devise on the spur of the moment any means of suitably disposing of the Drafting Committee's difficulties, appointed a Sub-Committee (Turkey, Great Britain, India, Italy, Portugal, and France). This Sub-Committee, which met the same afternoon, also found it impossible to get round the Drafting Committee's criticisms and recommended as the only way out of the impasse a frank reversal of the two last decisions, and reversion to the original wording of Article 15 of the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft, including the term ' native vessel ' and the original definition of that term. 95. The next morning, 12th June, the Geographical Committee met to consider the Sub-Committee's report. The Persian delegate (General Habibullah Khan) protested—this time, it must be admitted, with some justification—against the procedure adopted, and complained that all his efforts, made in accordance with specific instructions from Tehran to seek an accommodation with the Powers interested in the maritime zone compatible with respect for Persia's sovereign rights, had been rebuffed by the Indian delegation. The Greek delegate then suggested that the Committee should now make its decision on the Sub-Committee's report, and that the Persian delegate should make whatever reserve he thought proper, and take an opportunity at leisure to make a separate agreement with other Powers directly concerned. The French and Chinese delegates having offered their services as intermediaries to this end—an offer which Sir P. Cox gratefully acknowledged'^—M. Dendramis' suggestion was adopted and a decision taken—under a final protest by General Habibullah Khan—by seven votes to none, to revert to the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft of Article 15 (with the modifications previously mentioned of the definition of the Indian Ocean). 96. The General Committee stage had still to be faced. On 11th June (twenty-third session of the General Committee) M. Matsuda's report of the work of the Geographical Committee and the draft Articles recommended by that Committee came up for discussion. General Habibullah Khan rose, and combining with arguments that he had previously used a bitter complaint of the procedure adopted by the Geographical Committee, proposed that ' the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman ' be deleted from the definition of the maritime zone. M. dePalacios replied to the Persian complaint as to procedure and Lord Onslow and Sir P. Cox followed, * The Persian delegate had plainly hinted more than once before that his Government- wonld be ready to conclnde a private arrangement with Great Britain (and India). These offers had always been evaded as (1) it seemed improper to effect by private arrangement measures which should be provided for in the Convention; (2) His Majesty's Government (and India) has in the Hardinge Agreement of 1897 all the special agreement that it requires.31 replying to the I ersian contentions with arguments that were now familiar to all. ihe discussion was resumed in the afternoon session, Sir P. Cox intimating that to accept the Persian proposal would be tantamount to relaxing instead of tightening the control already established over illicit traffic in the waters in question. The Persian delegate then essayed a new venture, propounding to the Committee the question 44 Has this Conference the right, by a vote oi this Conference, to take steps which interfere with the rights of a country which is a sovereign State and a Member of the League of Nations, in spite of the protests of that country ? ' Sir P. Cox pointed out that the question involved a petitio pvinQipn. Other delegates disputed the competence of the Conference to deal with the question, and eventually the previous question was put. I? 7 * ^ ypt 0 ky roll was tlien taken on the proposal to exclude the Persian Decision that the (jruli and ( jtu I i of Oman from the maritime zone; the proposal was lost by Persian Gulf and .9 votes to 3, China and Turkey alone supporting Persia; Egypt, France, Oman Italy, Portugal, and Greece voting with Great Britain, India, Canada, and ? ha ' be inc }^ d the Irish Free State. Twenty-one delegates abstained from voting, the zone 6 maritime American on principle, the Spanish and Japanese because they had been chairman and rapporteur respectively of the Geographical Committee. 98. The question still remained for discussion in the General Committee Question of the -whether Persian vessels should be exempted from subjection to the maritime application of zone regime. In the previous discussions the initiative had always rested the maritime with the Persian delegate, the task of the Indian delegate being to zone regime to endeavour to interpret and dispose of each absurd argument as it was Persian vessels, •advanced. When consideration of the report of the Geographical Sir P. Cox's Committee was resumed on 15th J une for adoption by the General statement of the Committee, Sir P. Cox, by arrangement with the Secretary-General of the I ^ dian P oint of 'Conference, got his word in first. He recited the various claims put forward by the Persian delegates in regard to the maritime zone -first, the exclusion of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, and secondly, exemption of vessels flying the Persian flag from visit for verification—and' exposed the fatal effect that the admission of these claims would have upon the efficacy of the maritime zone regime. He explained the reasons for which the Government of India attached importance to close control of the operations of illicit traders in the area in question, adducing figures to show the .alarming volume to which the illicit trade attained when not closely and effectively controlled, and tracing the intimate connection between the illicit trade in arms and piracy on the pearl banks and slave traffic from Persian Mekran to the Oman coast. Finally, he declared that India could not be expected to adhere to a Convention that established a less effective control in this danger area than agreements already existing. Lord Onslow followed with a speech in which he gave effective support to the Indian delegate. General Habibullah Khan then rose, but was tactless enough to launch an attack on the Geographical Committee and its conduct of the task assigned to it, alleging that decisions had been taken, not on the merits, but out of regard to political considerations. (By adopting this Jine he succeeded in estranging the Chinese delegate, one of his two most constant supporters.) He expressed regret that his earnest endeavours to reach a Withdrawal of compromise with other Powers interested in the maritime zone had been the Persian dele- met w T it,h an adamantine refusal, and announced the withdrawal of the f, ates from the Persian delegation from the Conference. Conference. 99. Attempts were, of course, made to induce the Persian delegate to A suggestion by reconsider this decision; and the British delegation, in an endeavour to British dele- comply with the President's anxious endeavour to obliterate the breach in for ineet- the solidarity of the Conference, did produce a device—we can give it no I !. er ^ a,n ,, e more distinguished description—for soothing the amour propre of the 0 View * Persian delegate. The Indian delegation has been represented by some as having ' driven the Persian delegate from the Conference ' ; and we think it right, therefore, to state the nature of this device and the reasons why the Indian delegation refused to adopt it. The device was to exclude ' Persian vessels J ' specifically from the category of 'native vessel,' and to establish a new category of ' local vessels,' to which the regime applicable to ' native3. Other points in regard to the special zone. The American delegation's refusal of respon sibility in regard to the special vessels ' would equally apply ; the category would comprise all vessels of less than 500tons hailing from countries having a coastline between longitude 60° E. and 95° E. Persia has a strip of some 90 miles of coast to the east of 60° E. and Persian vessels would therefore fall within the category of ' local vessels.' It is extremely doubtful whether the proposal would have been in the least degree acceptable to the Persian delegate,but in any case the subterfuge was so transparent that if it had been adopted it would have introduced an element of farce into the Convention, placing, as it did. Great Britain, through Basidu, and Oman, through Gwadur, in both categories ; and the Indian delegation declined to be a party to it. 100. The Persian's withdrawal therefore stood. It was a regrettable occurrence ; but in the circumstances we consider that it was perhaps the best solution of what was fast becoming an impossible situation. We find it hard to believe that the Persian Government will endorse the extraordinary demands formulated by its delegates, or will find any difficulty either in signing the Convention before 30th September 192G or adhering to it at a later date, if it is ratified by the requisite number of States. 101. While this protracted struggle with the Persian delegation was in progress the Geographical Committee had in the intervals carried on its task of examining the Articles laying down the regime for the special zones by land and by sea As a rule the ' British draft,' the work of a delegation acknowledged to have special interests in, and special experience of the areas in question, was taken as the basis of discussion ; and, generally speaking, though constant attempts were made by M. Dupriez, in the interests of Belgian manufacturers and in the sacred name of Free Trade, to water down the somewhat stringent rules proposed, the British proposals were adopted without any important alteration of their substance. A considerable alteration of form will, however, be noticed; this is the result of representations by the American delegates, who urged that the Convention avou M have a better prospect of being accepted by the American Legislature if its text were not overloaded with minute detail as to the regulations to be imposed in a part of the world which is of little concern and less interest to the average American. Chapter III of the new Convention, therefore, embodies in the text little more than provisions which are important by reason of a point of principle contained in them: Articles of pure detail have been relegated so far as possible to annexes, which, however, are no less binding on High Contracting Parties than the main text—vide Article 31. 102. The American attitude of aloofness towards questions affecting the special zones was once more in evidence when the report of the Geographical Committee and the draft of Chapter III came before the General Committee on 12th June. Mr. Burton, without previous discussion or notice of his intention, proposed the addition of an Article laying down that ''High Contracting Parties which have no territories under their sovereignty, jurisdiction, protection or tutelage within or adjacent to the special zones accept no obligation or responsibility' in regard to the administration of the special zones regime. Sir P. Cox, fearing that the adoption of such a statement of disassociation might well encourage delegates to abstain from recording any vot^ on Persia's preposterous claims, which were still to be considered, and would certainly be misinterpreted in the special zones themselves as evidence of a lack of solidarity among the authors of the Convention, suggested that Mr. Burton's object might be better achieved by a reservation at the time of signature than by an Article in the body of the Convention. Mr. Burton pressed his point, obtaining support from repre sentatives of the South American States and also that of the British delegate, who unfortunately did not appreciate the reasons for the Indian delegate's intervention. M. de Palacios (Spain) attempted to reconcile the two points of view; and as a result of his efforts, though the American amendment w T as adopted in principle, it emerged from the Drafting Committee in the less objectionable form in which it appears in Article 27. * He had explained that he did not object to the term 'native vessel' as conveying derogatory meaning.X.—The General Provisions in Chapter V. 103. A few remarks may be made about certain of the Articles in •Chapter V of the new Convention (i) Article 32, para, (a) may be regarded as satisfactorily safeguarding the supply of arms, &amp;c., by His Majesty's Government to the Indian Army-— by sale and other wise—without restriction and without publicity. (ii) Article 3b represents in a somewhat mutilated form the stock Article, which is usually inserted in modern treaties to which His Majesty's Government is a party, to the effect that the signature of the British representatives does not bind the self-governing Dominions or Colonies having an autonomous Legislature except with their expressed consent. The unusual form is due to the anxiety displayed by many delegations lest the Article in its more usual form should conceal a loophole for clandestine trade. This anxiety had its origin in a proposal made in all good faith by the Dutch delegate to extend the exemption now afforded by Article 32 (a) to the export of arms from a ' mother country ' to any consignee in a dependency. This proposal, which the British delegation found most embarrassing, tending as it did to make suspect its own claim for the exemption secured by Article 32 (a), would clearly have afforded wide facilities for undesirable traffic between, say, Holland and the Dutch East Indies, for illicit re-export thence. Article 36 guards against this sort of contingency, unnecessarily perhaps, as the Dutch delegate eventually withdrew his proposal. (iii) Article 41.—The corresponding Article (No. 32) in the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft made the validity of the Convention depend on ratification by twelve States, in which seven named States (the principal producing countries) must be included. One of these seven was Russia. The recent Conference decided con amore to adopt the British proposal to delete Russia's name, it being evident that its retention gave her the power to prevent the Convention from coming into force, an obviously absurd result, and the opposite of the Temporary Mixed Commission's intention. The General Committee then requested the Military Technical Committee to devise a list of suitable States—including the principal arms-producing States—whose ratification should be essential to the validity of the Convention. The Military Committee complied with the request, though without any great degree of unanimity. It was not till the Military Committee's suggestions came to be scrutinised that the General Committee awoke to the fact that to name any State in this connection gives that State the power to prevent the Convention coming into force. It was decided, therefore, to adopt as the condition of validity ratification by fourteen States—roughly one-third of the number taking part in the Conference—no names being mentioned. (iv) Article 33.—We mention this Article last, as it is connected with a point on which the Government of India laid stress. It corresponds to Article 25 of the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft to which the Government oi: India had expressed objection as 'running counter to the w T hole object of the draft Convention.' After an exchange of -correspondence—with copies of which we were supplied—between the India Office and Foreign Office, the Government of India concurred in a proposal to re-model Article 25 into much the same form as that now presented by Article 33 of the new Convention, but subject to the proviso that the Article should not apply to the special zones. This proviso was discussed between the British and Indian delegations at the outset of the Conference. The former held that the Government of India's stipulation would involve the formulation of a special set of rules of neutrality applicable only in the special zone—a task impossible to achieve and probably undesirable to attempt in a Conference such as that then assembled. Moreover, the Government of India's stipulation might be embarrassing to themselves in the event of a war waged, like the recent great war, partly within and partly outside the special zone, while in the case of a war confined within those limits it would probably be possible to attain the object in view by means of an arrangement ad hoc between the Powers interested. The Indian delegation acknowledged the force of these arguments, and the -subject of the applicability of Article 33 to the special zones was not broached in the Conference, till, late in the last plenary session on 16th June,u M. de Palacios, Chairman of the Geographical Committee, spontaneously raised the question, which, he said, had been exercisiog his thoughts for some time. In deference, however, to the general wish of the Conference, which at that late stage was unmistakably averse from initiating a discussion of a highly contentious subject, M. de Palacios did not proceed lurther with the question, which was left undiscussed. 104. We venture to think that, on the whole, this was just as well; a discussion of the question could hardly have been carried through without an inconvenient and probably embarrassing incursion into highly delicate political questions. 105. Thus the fourth also of the five objectives which the Indian delegation was more or less instructed to keep in view failed to be attained though, since Article 25 of the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft was amended in a sense generally in accord with the Government of India's- desire, the failure was not complete. Conclusion. 106. The Indian delegation's signature was appended to the Convention and the four accompanjang documents : the Protocol of Signature, which leaves the Convention open to signature till 30th September 1926, the Declaration respecting the Spanish territory of Ifni, the Protocol regarding- Chemical and Bacteriological Warfare, and the Final Act, which comprises one excellent resolution and one pious aspiration. 107. Of the Convention itself we think that it may be asserted with confidence that, in respect of form and arrangement of contents, it shows a marked improvement on the St. Germain Convention and the Temporary Mixed Commission's draft. Of the prospect of its substance so much commending itself to the various legislatures of the world as to earn their ratification of it, we venture no opinion. We consider, and know that several other delegations consider, that there is much force in Mr. Burton's observation (which it would be well to bear in mind in the event of this Convention failing to be brought into effect) that it is possible to deal in too wide a manner with so wide a question as that of the regulation of the traffic in arms, which presents different appearances in relation to the different parts of the world and the different degrees of civilisation that exist in them. 108. In concluding this Report the members of the Indian delegation desire to express to Your Lordship their cordial appreciation of the efficient and helpful services rendered to them by the Technical Advisers and Secretary deputed to accompany them to Geneva. At the commencement of the Conference Mr. D. T. Monteath, O.B.E., of the Political Department, was unable, owing to illness, to accompany us, and his place was taken for the first fortnight by Mr. P. J. Patrick, Economic and Overseas Department. His previous experience of working arrangements at Geneva, and his wide acquaintance with officials of the League Secretariat and with permanent foreign delegations, were always at our disposal and were of the greatest assistance to us. On Mr. Monteath's arrival at Geneva on 20th May Mr. Patrick returned home. From that date Mr. Monteath supplied the corporate memory and up-to-date knowledge in connection with the subject of the Conference and the political aspect of various issues which arose in the course of the proceedings. Both in respect of his judicious and zealous co-operation at Geneva and in the difficult task of unravelling the tangled material of which, in the foregoing pages, we have endeavoured to present a connected narrative, his able services have been greatly appreciated. In Miss Larkin we found a most assiduous and willing secretary, ready to respond to any call made upon her at any time. AVe beg here to record our cordial acknowledgment of her services. We have the honour to be, My Lord, Your obedient Servants, P Z COX W. E.
