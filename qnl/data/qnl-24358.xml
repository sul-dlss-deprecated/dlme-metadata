He writes that the Governor in Council approves of Bruce having visited his Royal Highness the Prince of Sheeraz [Shiraz] when he was in the Bushire district. Warden also states that the Governor in Council authorises a gift to the value of 4,000 rupees for the Prince. Warden further writes that the assistance His Royal Highness has requested from the Resident in conveying his troops to Bahrain cannot be given, being inconsistent with Britain's policy of the suppression of piracy in the region.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024100364.0x00002b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
