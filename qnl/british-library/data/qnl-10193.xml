The draft version of these sections can be found at folios 10v-16.These sections include questions on the nature of the charges that should be brought against individuals and who those persons that had an 'apparent or presumptive right or claim to suspicion' might be; the legitimate descendents of Khindi Rao (Sir Khanderao II Gaekwad) and the immediate family of Malhar Rao (Malharrao) the current Gaekwar of Baroda; an enclosed map of the Baroda provinces (not with this copy of the report), and Pelly's difficulties in obtaining an accurate map of the extent of the Baroda state and its possessions; and the need for the Government to take direct control of the management of the state, at least for a limited period in order that its administration may be analysed and reconstructed, and its finances placed on a sound and economical basis.The letter concludes with Pelly's account of the reception he had received from the Gaekwar and his ministers and their sincerity in desiring to obtain and act on Pelly's advice; his opinions on the length of time required to organise the administration; and the possible future prosperity of the state particularly given its rich soil and the possibilities for increasing land revenue.A postscript to the letter informs thr Government of Pelly's reasoning for having Frank Henry Souter deliver his letter and report and his hopes that they will find it helpful to have Mr Souter available to answer any questions they may have. The postscript also suggests that in the event of the Gaekwar being deposed that the forces in Baroda be strengthened in order to maintain the peace, and prevent damage to or the theft of state property.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023419770.0x000003#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
