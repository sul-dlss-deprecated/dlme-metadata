T he present Narrative was undertaken for the satisfaction of my family and friends whom I left in India, and was written in the short intervals between quick travelling and rest; at which period also the sketches accompanying it, and many others, were made. As I advanced, I found , that the facilities of a journey over-land far exceeded my anticipation, and might perhaps deserve to be generally made known. The many polite attentions also which my fellow-tra veller, Captain Salter, and myself received, merely as British officers, from different gentlemen residing at the principal towns on the line of route, excited a feeling of grateful respect that demanded something more than a private and personal acknowledgement. With these inducements to publication was combined an expectation of my own, that a plain record of facts, and of the sentiments and opinions to which they directly gave rise, might in some degree be useful to others, although perhaps not deeply interesting. In submitting this Journal in its original form to the Public, I must claim their indulgence in regard to any want of refine ment or elegance of language, which may have been occasioned by inexperience in composition. I beg leave to observe that a 2iv PREFACE. thirty-five years (nearly the whole) of my life have been passed in India; and as most of that time was devoted to the acquisition of local and professional knowledge, very little leisure was left for literary studies, even if opportunities for them had been more frequent : these seldom present themselves to military men in India, whose duties detain them, often for months and sometimes for years, among the natives, without the society of any European, For the information of future travellers, I have given, in an Appen dix, an Itinerary of the route which we pursued, and an account of all expenses incurred between Bombay and London.CONTENTS.

At the time when Captain Salter and I determined to revisit Eng land, many favourable circumstances seemed to combine to render travelling by land not only safe, but peculiarly gratifying to us as British officers. A general peace prevailed throughout Persia and on the continent of Europe, in establishing which the liberal and dignified policy of Great Britain, seconded by the magnanimous efforts of her fleets and armies, had been mainly instrumental. Our national cha racter had become known and respected by foreigners of all countries during those protracted struggles which we were so directly called upon to make, against the projects of aggrandizement pursued by the French, under their brave and skilful commander, Bonaparte. The fame of these successful struggles might be expected to render the appellation of Englishman a sufficient passport through every terri tory from India to the shores of the Baltic, and an adequate guarantee2 DEPARTURE FROM BOMBAY. for personal security and consideration : such were the anticipations which encouraged us in the outset, and it is gratifying to reflect that they have been amply realised. As the route which we had chosen led through an inhabited and generally cultivated country, we had few difficulties of magnitude to apprehend; and in travelling through Persia at a season which was still comparatively cold, we hoped that our constitutions would be strengthened and improved. We were also aware that we should have it in our power to make long or short journeys each day, as might suit our convenience or inclination. From all the information which we were able to collect, we were led to believe that the passage over-land would be neither expensive nor tedious, and that we might perform it at less cost, and in very little more time, than would be required for proceeding home by sea round the Cape. Another considerable advantage incident to the journey, in my estimation, was, that in departing in the middle of February, we should avoid the hot season, which was about to com mence in India, as also the winter of the southern hemisphere, which would overtake us at the Cape if we went that way ; while, on the other hand, we should find at our arrival in Persia, upon which we might calculate in three weeks, that the most delightful season of the year would commence with our travels. The novelty and variety of interesting objects that might offer themselves to our notice as we advanced, were additional incentives to the choice of this route. Having determined therefore to proceed over-land from Bushire, and our leave of absence being obtained, we took our passage on board the Kusroovie, a merchant vessel of about 360 tons, commanded by Captain Waddington, a mariner well acquainted with the navigation of the Per sian Gulf. Our agreement with this gentleman was to pay him' 300 rupees each for our accommodation in the round-house ; exclusive of which, we engaged to furnish ourselves with wine and liquors, and we had our own servants to attend us. Together with a small stock of linen, we each took an English saddle with holsters, pistols and ammunition.PASSENGERS, ARABS AND INDIANS. S Besides the numerous merchant vessels navigating between Bombay and the Persian Gulf, there is generally either a frigate or a sloop of war on the latter station ; and the Bombay government send packets regularly every month to Bussora and Bushire, with the over-land despatches. Had we waited about a fortnight longer, we might have taken our passage in the Company’s cruiser which was expected to sail in the beginning of March; but as our minds were now intent on the journey, we, like many travellers, were prone to over-rate every apparent advantage, and make light of all obstacles that affected our design. We concluded that the Kusroovie, from its superior size, would afford us better accommodation than the Company’s cruiser, which was about 150 tons; and we did not duly appreciate the dan ger to which we should be exposed from the Joasmy pirates, who were said to be at this time in great force at the entrance of the Gulf. There were other inconveniences which we ought to have taken into serious consideration, and which experience taught us to bear in lasting remembrance. On the 15th of February we embarked. The crew of the vessel were soon collected round the capstan to heave up the anchor, and were quickly joined by a great proportion of Arabs,.deck passengers, who formed, together with them, a groupe of as motley, filthy, bristly, beggarly, and raggedly clothed men as ever were seen. I was forcibly struck with the difference of character that existed between the Arab and the native of India. The former, endowed with bodily strength, restrained with few prejudices, active, hardy and intrepid, sought every opportunity of assisting the crew, while the timid Indian, kept aloof by his habitual apathy and timidity in some retired spot, was not easily distinguishable from a heap of foul clothes. In the cabin with Capt. Salter and myself was a youthful traveller in pursuit of health, Lieut. Deletany of H. M. 17th Dragoons : his motive for the voyage was to prolong his existence at the least possible expense by migrating from India before the approach of the hot seasons, which might have brought on a relapse of the ague and fever still hanging about him, and would have rendered his recovery doubt- b 24 A YOUNG OFFICER IN ILL HEALTH. ful or at best very tedious. The painful recollection of my own suf ferings for years after my first arrival in India, from alternate fever, ague, and bowel complaint, caused me to sympathize deeply with the condition of this young gentleman, who perhaps but a few months before, in the full vigour of health, had quitted his paternal roof, where no want or wish was ungratified, and where the tender care of a mother and the soothing affection of a sister would have ministered relief to his slightest ailments. To what a sad and appalling change was he now subjected! Instead of these kind comforters, he is an noyed rather than attended by a careless, stupid, drowsy boy of India, unused to the sea, and not possessing sufficient energy of mind to rouse himself to action, much less to wait on his fretful master, who at times consoles himself in this state of desertion, by reflecting that his lot is still preferable to that of the companions and fellow-sufferers whom he has left behind, stationed probably at a distance from the sea coast. He had a prospect of returning health which they could not command; for his friends had supplied him with a small but competent fund of money for the voyage, and for a few weeks resi dence in Persia, where it was on the cold of the climate alone, that he depended for his recovery. This unhappy case applies but too generally to the young cadets in India, who suffer from frequent relapses of the maladies here men tioned, terminating sooner or later in death. If bills of mortality re lative to this class of young men were to be published, the conclusion to be drawn from a scrutiny of them would be, that the embarkation of a cadet to India is like a new birth to him : his life becomes as precarious as that of an infant; it is to be reckoned among a number of which only one half extend to twelve years, and perhaps not above one in ten enable their possessors to reach the land of promise (or the enjoyment of full pay) after twenty-five years of service. Even when that desired consummation is attained, its blessings in most cases can be calculated upon for but a few years, when the hand of death peremptorily closes the account. Having digressed so far concerning one passenger, I shall say littleDISCOMFORTS OF THE PASSAGE. 5 more respecting the others, than what may serve to describe their motley appearance. They were in number 136, about thirty of whom, men and women, were huddled together, with their pro visions, merchandize, and part of the ship’s cargo, in the great cabin. These were Mahomedans from the Carnatic, travelling on a pil grimage to the holy tombs at Kurballa and Mecca. The bustle and confusion of this crowded scene were augmented by a multitude of monkeys, parroquets, cats, and other domestic animals. At length the sails were filled by a fine breeze, when unfortunately we observed that the vessel lay over extremely, and this could be easily accounted for, when we were told that the cargo, which filled her to the upper deck, had been all taken on board within the last day or two, and there had been no possibility of placing the heaviest ar ticles the lowest. There were casks filled with water, lashed between the carronades and on the quarter-deck, with booms, spars, boats and cables between the masts. For want of room below, about 120 of the passengers slept on deck. The cabin below us was full of women: it was shut up by dead lights whenever we had a breeze; and the smell which exhaled from thence greatly annoyed us, on re tiring to our own cabin. Here we had leisure to reflect on our want of foresight in preferring this vessel to a Company’s cruiser, which had no native passengers and was kept as clean as possible. We had greater occasion for regret, on recollecting that we had but few of those advantages of defence with which the cruisers are amply pro vided ; and that if attacked by the barbarous pirates we were likely to be taken and put to death. It is known that those wretches give no quarter; and that on overpowering a vessel, they have deliberately taken the crews and beheaded them at the gangway, previously to throwing them overboard. We dismissed those fears, however, and cheered ourselves with the anticipated delight of viewing the shores of Arabia. After quitting the Indian coast we experienced baffling winds and calms, the tediousness of which was but poorly relieved by the sight of porpoises, and now and then a grampus; or the funeral prepa-6 WATER-SPOUTS. rations for committing to the deep the body of a deceased Arab of note; or at times the flight of the beautiful tropic bird appearing in some positions like a white cross on a dark cloud. On the 26th February, in lat. 22° 26', long. 66° 19', we were called on deck to observe the rather uncommon phenomenon of several water spouts, that were slowly moving before us. The following were the remarks which occurred to me at the moment, on making a pencil sketch of their appearances. Previous to the time when they pre sented themselves the weather had been calm and cloudy, with fre quent squalls, from different, and even opposite quarters. From the circumstances attending their origin, continuance and termination, I am inclined to consider them as derivable from electric causes, similar to those of the whirlwinds on shore, so commonly observed during the periods of lull or calm, which intervene between the land and sea breezes in India, and perhaps not stronger in effect. The columnar or ribbon-like appearance, I suppose to be produced by thick mist or aqueous vapour, which could not by its fall occasion any damage to a vessel, save that which such a body itself might occasion by deranging the current of the electric fluid. The formation of the spout ap pears to commence thus: A convexity, or small spot of projection downwards, is observed in the cloud, of the same apparent density with its thickest part; and on a spot in the sea, nearly under it, a bubbling motion is seen accompanied with mist. The projection from the cloud increases rapidly in length, until it comes nearly in contact with the correspondent spot in the water, but their union is not ascertainable by reason of the attendant mist. The spot below is darkest in the centre and at the water’s edge, and does not appear in any case to rise more than ten or twelve feet above the level of the sea, where it diminishes in density and appears as mist. If the horizon beyond the cloud be clear and in light, the spout itself appears dark, but not more so than the impending squall cloud; but should the horizon beyond it be dark, the column assumes the colour of smoke, and shows itself comparatively lighter than the distance.THE SEA RED WITH FISH-SPAWN. ^ At the moment of its approximation to the agitated water below, the spout is nearly straight, but it soon becomes bent like a bow, in the direction of the wind, yielding to its action; yet its general co lour or density does not appear deeper or greater than that of the thickest part of the cloud to which it adheres. This phenomenon terminates by the separation of the pillar, which divides as if broken off, the upper part re-ascending into the cloud, and the lower part diffusing itself wider and wider, and gradually subsiding. It is also observable, that the spout does not remain stationary, but proceeds as if uniting the extent of the cloud to which it is attached, with the surface of the sea, sometimes to a considerable distance. After the disappearance of the spout there is very frequently a fall of rain from the cloud. The next circumstance that attracted our notice was that of long tracts of fish-spawn on the surface of the water, which, when the sun shone out, appeared of a most brilliant scarlet colour. This pecu liarity is observable on approaching the shore of Arabia, at any point from Cape Russelgat to the Red Sea, which is often much covered by it. As the voyage from Bombay to Bushire has often been described, I shall not detail it, but shall merely notice such particulars as appear to have been overlooked by other writers. On approaching the northern shore, that of Baloochistaun, we saw several boats, which occasionally alarmed us, but none of them proved to be hostile. One indeed approached us, and on coming so near as to be within hail, declared that her intention in so doing was to proceed under our pro tection to Muscat, the port to which she belonged, and whither she was returning from the Gulf of Cutch. She continued with us until our arrival at her destination. We made the high land of Arabia on the 12th March, but it was not until the 15th that we entered the Cove of Muscat, on account of the blowing weather which we experienced from the south-west ward. The Cove from its entrance presents a very fine view, whicharrival at muscat. 8 during our stay I attempted to delineate in detail. We found liere ? riding at anchor, the ship Sophia from Bombay, and the Honourable Company’s cruiser Vestal, sent from the Persian Gulf to take all merchant vessels under her convoy that arrived at Muscat, and con duct them thence to Bushire or Bussora. This precaution, not al ways necessary, was now adopted, because the Joasmy pnates weie on the look-out, and had very recently captured several boats. On the 16th, all our passengers went on shore, and certainly much to the relief of the women from the cabin below us, who had not partaken the benefit of fresh air since leaving Bombay. Although the exhalation from that confined spot was disgusting and abo minable, they were kept there closely secluded, according to Maho- medan usage: some of them were aged, and many were faint and enfeebled for want of air; but they were not permitted, even at night-fall, to come out and sit on deck, to revive themselves by change of atmosphere, and freshen their clothes, which had not been changed during the past month. As soon as the passengers were on shore, as much of the cargo as could conveniently be got at was brought on deck, to be stowed away again more judiciously; the heaviest articles, such as iron, tin, sugar- candy, &amp;c. being placed lowest. Preparations were made for taking on board provisions, wood, and water; and some bags of rice were landed, and sold very advantageously at Muscat. As the Imaum of Muscat and Governor of the district of Oman is a staunch ally to the English, and particularly well-disposed toward them, there is no immediate necessity for an Englishman to be established here as a British resident, and accordingly none is ap pointed ; but a Hindoo merchant, a native of Katiawar, who is settled here, officiates as Agent for his Majesty and the Honourable East India Company. He appears to be a very respectable and obliging man, ready to assist all persons connected with the English, and acting as money-broker or banker, and general agent. He has a large house in the middle of the town, and seems to possess con-UNHEALTHINESS OF THE PLACE. 9 siderable influence on all the other merchants of the place. He sup plies the ships touching at this port with such articles as they may require. To a stranger coming to reside at Muscat, there is said to be great danger from attacks of fever, which have frequently proved fatal to Europeans ; nor is it at all surprising to find that endemic diseases are .reputed to be prevalent here, for the site of the town is very low, and nearly encompassed by high and rocky mountains, open only in one direction, from which winds seldom blow. The heat is gene rally so oppressive during summer, and the streets are left in so filthy a state, that most of the inhabitants who can afford it migrate from the town to the high grounds and date plantations inland, occu pying their town residence during the cold season only. The Ima- um himself generally resides at Boreka, about thirty miles in the country in a north-westerly direction, doubtless to avoid the un healthiness of the town, where he has a fine mansion which is sel dom occupied. In fact, the only race of people who seem to bear living on this unwholesome spot, are the blacks of the Abyssinian coast, to the southward of the Red Sea, with curled or woolly hair. Most of the persons, particularly of the females, who are seen in the streets here either belong to this race, or may be traced as descendants from them, by their complexion and features: they are probably the off- N spring of Arab fathers, and of Abyssinian (slave-women) mothers. Every female, when in the streets, covers her face, by wearing a slip of silk four inches broad over it, having two holes for the eyes. This slip of silk is fastened to the head by two metal hooks, and hangs down to the middle, where it is held, to prevent its being blown about by the wind; it is therefore easily removed when oc casion requires, by throwing it back over the head, or aside over one shoulder. The habits of the people of the interior, the Buddoos, or as we call them, the Bedouins, are completely pastoral: they tend their cattle among the mountains and vales as loqg as the weather will permit, and retire during the severity of winter to the sea-coast, when practicable, where they subsist principally on fish. Some of10 DATE TREES. them take up their winter-residence in huts or caves in the most sheltered spots, and live on the milk and other produce of their flocks, and on dates and other dried fruits which they have collected during the summer. The date-tree in Arabia, supplies the place of the cocoa-tree of India; and like it, seems to furnish the natives with most of the necessaries of life. The fruit is food for men and cattle: the leaves and fibres of the tree are wrought up into mats and ropes, with which the huts are covered; while the stem and the branches (if they may be so called) answer all the purposes of wood. Here the dates grow to great perfection, and contain a very great proportion of nutritious saccharine matter. But the fruit produced by date-trees, so situated as not to be within reach of the farina of the flower of the male date- tree, remain smaller, and never become saccharine, although they attain a red and ripe appearance. While we were here, it was the season for performing the process of impregnating the female date-trees; and this was done by tying within each of the bunches of the female flowers one or more of the fibres of the male flower, which grows in large bunches on the male tree, and from which falls a great quantity of farina, as fine as hair- powder, of fragrant scent, or rather highly odoriferous. As date-trees producing the smaller fruit of astringent flavour, are abundant, and grow luxuriantly at Bombay, I sent thither, by a re turn boat, a ripe male flower weighing at least two pounds, full of farina, and used every precaution to ensure its arrival in as dry and perfect a state as possible. It is to be apprehended however, from its having to be on board the boat sixteen or twenty days, that it would lose its power of vegetation ere it could be applied. From Muscat I made an excursion by land to Muttra, a distance of about five miles, in which I had to cross two ranges of mountains. That nearest to Muttra is very high; the other, which is the lower range, has towers on its summits, and there is a gateway flanked by towers on the road. These fortifications are placed in both the di rections from which alone an enemy could advance : these are to theMUTTRA. 11 N. W. from Muttra, and to the southward from Saadutabad, a small fishing village about two miles distant, in a beautiful bay of the sea. All the houses here are flat-roofed, and their walls are of a glaring yellow colour, which must tend, together with the dust and filth, to injure the sight; for sore eyes are extremely prevalent among the people. This disease may have given rise to the general custom of applying pulverised antimony to the edges of the eye-lids, which is now become an essential part of the operation of dressing for com pany, and through the fascinating influence of female eyes is esteemed attractive. A few yards from the road, I observed several mat-huts of beggars, some of whom were standing near them, having placed baskets by the way-side to receive the alms of travellers, for which they called aloud. These people, it seems, had been by a good precaution for bidden to enter the villages, because they were afflicted with leprosy, a disease which is thus shown to be considered infectious, and not i uncommon in Arabia. The inhabitants of Muttra seemed to be altogether cleaner and fairer than those of Muscat, and to have less affinity with the Abys sinian race. We extended our journey farther into the interior of the country, with the intention of visiting some hot mineral springs, issuing from the foot of a mountain about fifteen miles from Muttra; but finding it rather inconvenient to ride on asses, although their pace was the amble, on wooden saddles covered with sheep-skins, and being deterred also by the great heat of the sun, we returned, after proceeding about five miles, to the village of Rawee. We saw no cultivation in any part of the country, beyond the im mediate vicinity of the huts in the villages, some of which were surrounded by walls and towers for defence. In the enclosed grounds, the principal objects of culture were date-trees, lucerne, wheat, and esculent vegetables. Near the road-side were exposed for sale baskets of fried fish, and boiled sweet potatoes: in the towns we observed, among other articles of food on sale, locusts fried, boiled, and dried. c 212 SLAVES SOLD IN THE BAZAR. On our journey we met several men mounted on asses and camels, and followed by other cattle of the same kind, laden with vegetables, mats, sheep-skins, sour milk, and other commodities, which they were carrying to Muttra. Each of the men had in his hand a stick, or staff, crooked at one end. The returns which they bring from market, I find, consist of salt fish, and such articles of commerce as are brought to this country by ships. The Buddoos of the interior whom we met, appeared a more cleanly race of men than the inhabitants of the towns ; they had fine open countenances, and a manly, free, and bold address. It was stated to us that the Imaum has about five hundred of these Buddoos in his pay, and that on them he principally depends for his defence. At stated periods they are exchanged, or relieved in their duty, by others from the neighbouring villages, when they obtain leave to visit their families for a short time, after which they in turn resume their attendance on the Imaum. In passing through the Bazar at Muscat, we saw an Arab with a stick in his hand, walking to and fro between two lots of boys and girls whom he was offering for sale, proclaiming aloud successively the price fixed on each. They were ill clothed, and looked as if not at all concerned as to the event, having perhaps but few human com forts the loss of which to regret, and their young minds being more susceptible of hope than of fear. Indeed the state of a slave in the family of a Mahomedan very commonly resembles that of an adopted child, entitling the individual to some share in the property of his master at his decease, and frequently even before that event. A slave, if of competent ability, is early employed as an assistant and agent in traffic, and entrusted with his owner’s property to a consi derable amount, part of which is not unusually given him as a settle ment, when he is allowed to marry a free-born woman. Through this kind of adoption, the feelings of masters, and of course their conduct, in regard to their slaves, are quite different from those that prevail in the families of the Portuguese and Dutch, who very often treat these hapless dependants harshly, beating them, and degradingCONDITION OF MAHOMEDAN SLAVES. 13 them with marked contempt and unrelenting oppression. They seem even to regard them as deserving less care and attention than brute animals. The more humane treatment exercised by the Maho- medans may partly arise from the custom which they have, of pur chasing for themselves young female companions, who generally by their attachment and fidelity, desire and obtain their utmost esteem and affection. This apparent moral degradation of the female is not without a compensation of good ; for, while it reduces her to the state of slavery, it raises the slave some degrees higher in the social scale. Thus, while by one system of treatment, the service of the slave becomes reluctant and profitless through cruelty, it is rendered, by a contrary course, almost an affair of gratitude and affection. The adopted slaves of the Mahomedans are found to interest themselves strongly in the welfare of their masters, and ready even to lay down their lives in their defence: they are perfectly trust-worthy, and instances are not wanting in which they have been left sole heirs of the property which their care has helped to accumulate. The con trast of these opposite results has long impressed me with the con viction, that although equal exertions may be called forth from youth by coercion, and by the excitement of emulation, yet the former pro cess produces certain lasting effects on the mind which uniformly tend to degrade it. It is a general remark in India, that slaves of the Abyssinian race, called by the Christians Caffres, (a term borrowed from the Mahome dans, who apply it to unbelievers,) are, in point of moral character, either very good or very bad: either of these opposite qualities pro bably depends less on their natural dispositions than on the treat ment or instruction which they receive, during youth, from their owners. Curiosity and implicit trust in their elders are propensities incident to young persons; and therefore every thing they see pro duces an impression seldom to be effaced, but by the tardy progress of conviction. Where no opportunities are afforded of obtaining in formation from books, as is the case with slaves in India, their sole stock of learning consists in a recollection of facts. It is to be feared14 COMMODITIES SOLD. and lamented, that among enlightened nations tuition is conducted with too great a reliance on the efficacy of written precepts, and that its tendency is to exercise the memory rather than the judgment; since in all that concerns the business and conduct of life, each rising generation has the same noviciate to perform with that which pre ceded it, and can learn wisdom in no school but that of dear-bought experience. At Muscat there is no coin of the country : the gold and silver coin of Persia and India pass current; and also silver dollars, with the Venetian ducat, which, as its intrinsic worth has been long known, is by far the best coin to travel with. The bazars here are confined and dirty : they afford nothing worth notice, peculiar to this part of Arabia: the principal commodities sold in them are cloths, drugs, dried fruits, coffee, grain in small quantities, and sweet-meats, for one of which, called Hulwa, Muscat is famed. It is apparently a compound of the gluten of wheat, sugar, and butter ^ and is reputed to be nutritive and strengthening. It is carried for sale, in small earthen-ware pans, to Persia and India. Another export from Muscat is salted fish and shark-fins. The shores of Arabia abound in fish; and the rude and primitive process of catching them is worthy of notice, as an indication of the un changing habits of the people. Indeed, a stranger entering Arabia, however little conversant with sacred history, cannot but be struck with the patriarchal character of the inhabitants, observable in the simplicity of their dress and their modes of life, which do not seem to have undergone much variation since the time of our Saviour. It is evident, that the dress or tunic of the monks in Roman Catholic countries is a copy of that which is still commonly worn in Arabia, in shape, texture, and even colour. Boats going out to fish, first supply themselves with very large quantities of small fish, like sardinas, for baits ; these they catch with casting nets, within the Cove of Muscat, and generally close to the ves sels at anchor in four or five fathom water. Shoals of these small fish are seen by the boatmen, swimming not far from the surface; on observ-MODE OF FISHING. 15 mg a shoal, one of the fishers, standing up, throws the net over the spot, and as soon as sufficient time has elapsed for the net to descend below the shoal of fish, another man, nearly naked, dives to the bot tom of the net, which he collects together in his arms. He then pulls a string connected with the net, which is gently drawn up, the diver ascending with it. This precaution is necessary on account of the vast quantities of fish usually taken at one cast, which, unless the net were drawn together, would by their Own weight and obstruction keep it open, and force a passage out. By these means the net is repeatedly filled, and then it is lifted into the opening of a boat shaped basket of wicker work, which is fastened amidship to the side of the fishing-boat, and the fish are thus retained alive, to be used afterwards as bait. In general the fishers are very successful, and return in the evening with fine large fish, which are partly used for food, and the rest salted for exportation. The divers remain from seventy to one hundred seconds under water, a period which appears to a by-stander extraordinarily long. Had we not carefully and repeatedly noted it by a watch with se conds, our apprehension of their sufferings, during so long a continu ance under water, would have led us to imagine that the time was nearly double that above-stated.16 CHAPTER II.

On the 20th of February, having taken in our supply of water, fire-wood, flour, butter, fruit and vegetables, the vessel was warped out of the Cove, and our passengers returned on board. The batch of Mahomedan women and men again descended into their dungeon, the great cabin. At six in the morning of the 21st our little man-of- war fired a gun, and stood out to sea, followed by our vessel the Kusrovie, and by the Sophia and the Duncan. We soon left behind us the town and the fortifications on the rugged eminences com manding the Cove, and subsequently the rocky mountains, all of which are precipitous, and completely barren. Their strata are posited at an inclination of several degrees to the horizon, and appear as if heaved up from their original state by some convulsion beneath them. In advancing towards the Persian Gulf, we now and then saw a boat or two, which we took to be those of the pirates, and our little Com modore neared to reconnoitre them, but no exchange of shot took pj cLC0* The piratical dows of the Joasmys are fast sailers, being very laree and light; they carry only two or three guns, and are manned by 10 m three hundred to five hundred men, all well armed.

No doubt our government will be obliged, with the assistance of the men and vessels of the Imaum of Muscat, to keep possession of some of the isles and spots near the Quoins, commencing at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, which will effectually prevent any piratical excursions from its shores, and ensure them the command of the Gulf. In 1809 an expedition sailed from Bombay, under the command of Colonel Lionel Smith and Commodore Rowley, against these pirates, on which occasion their strong-holds at Ras-ul-Khima, and other places on the Arabian coast, were partially destroyed. On the 28th March we passed the Quoins, situated at the entrance of the Gulf, and the crew of the Duncan performed the ceremony of pro pitiating the deity, or genius loci. This consists in setting afloat, near the Quoins, a little ship rigged and in sailing order, bearing a sample of all the merchandise carried for sale in the vessel which sends her forth. Prayers for her safety are uttered on launching her, and if she makes for shore the crew consider them as granted. I remarked that after we had passed the Quoins, the weather be came very sultry, and in consequence many of our passengers were attacked with low bilious fevers, accompanied by foul tongues, head ache, stupor, and great loss of strength. We had no surgeon on board, and I administered tartar emetic to all those who applied for it, as soon as I ascertained their indisposition. This medicine, to gether with calomel, was repeated until I became apprehensive of mischief; but the effects were obviously good. It is worthy of notice that none of the ship’s crew, or of the common sailors, took the fever; it attacked only those who had lived on shore at Muscat. This peculiarity has been frequently observed on board other vessels. Now, as the effects of heat and cold were alike both on the crew and18 SICKNESS OF PASSENGERS. on the passengers, the fever can be attributable to two causes only; infection on shore, or a change of diet on leaving Muscat. The atmosphere became cloudy, with strong winds from the west ward. On the 4th April, at one in the morning, it blew extremely hard ; and at four o’clock there was a perfect gale of wind. Our sails suffered a little before they were secured: the Duncan carried away her fore and main topsails. The wind was from N. N. W. to N. W. It is to be observed that this tempestuous weather is called the breaking up of the rainy season in Persia, which usually sets in and leaves off with a flourish of this kind. During the gale we had a great deal of lightning and thunder. The Mahomedans in the great cabin, who had all of them the fever, were crying and praying all the time, under an apprehension that fate would not allow them the advantage of a visit to the sacred tombs, on the expiatory effects of which they greatly depended for their admission to their enviable state of future happiness. These details may serve to show the disadvantages to which we exposed ourselves in proceeding by a country merchant vessel instead of a Company’s cruiser. The latter should have been preferred, particularly for the navigation up the Persian Gulf, in which direction adverse winds from the N. W. are prevalent, and blow violently, ren dering the passage difficult for such merchant vessels as I have described. In returning to India from Bussora, or Bushire, the wind is generally fair and the passage shorter, so that an indifferent vessel may fully answer the purpose. On the 6th of April the sickness on board increased rapidly to such a degree that we made signal for medical aid, which the Com modore afforded us by sending his surgeon. The Carnatic Maho medans in the great cabin suffered more than all the other passengers, being dangerously ill: some of them actually died ere we reached the shore of Bushire on the 7th. On entering the outer roads we made signal for a pilot, and with his assistance stood over the bar, and anchored in the inner roads,ARRIVAL AT BCJSHIRE. 19 where the sea is not so much affected by the winds, being nearly sur rounded by sand banks. It was fortunate that we arrived at this period, for a N. W. wind set in with considerable violence, which, if we had been at sea, would have driven us back. This wind con tinued many days. On the morning of the 8th, Mr. Bruce, the British resident at Bushire, sent off a boat to bring us on shore, at the same time very kindly inviting us to be his guests. Besides this gentleman, we found that Mr. Sharpe, the surgeon, and Captain Taylor, an officer of our establishment, were residing here. The latter was completing his studies in the Arabic language. Of the town I have to observe, that it is kept in a most filthy state, and defended on the land-side by a few towers connected by a wall of mud. There are a few old guns on them half mounted, which, if fired, might be as likely to destroy the defenders as the assailants. The precaution, however, of fortifying this town is necessary, as all the Dashtistan, or low country near the Persian Gulf, is inhabited principally by tribes of Arabs, who have formed themselves into petty states. They are often at war with each other ; and the inha bitants of each settlement not only enclose their towns, but in their ournies from one place to another go armed. A short time ago some workmen employed in removing materials from the ruins of the ancient town of Beshire, about three miles south of this place, discovered some curious remains of antiquity. Immured in the thick foundation walls of some of the principal buildings, they found several urns of eighteen inches each, arranged in rows running east and west, each containing the reliques of human beings. One of these sepulchral urns was sent by Captain Taylor to the Bengal Literary Society : the following is the description of it: — A stone hollowed out and cut to the shape of ajar, three feet long, and twelve inches wide, with a front or lid formed of a diaphanous substance, supposed to be talc, within which were the bones of a human being, packed in dry sand. Other jars or urns were found, formed of earthen ware, and lined with a coat of black naphtha ; these also con- d 220 ARABS OF THE COUNTRY. tained bones, and were filled up with dry sand. It seems probable that these remains are of great antiquity; perhaps coeval with the Guebres, or fire-worshippers, who after exposing the bodies of their dead until the flesh had been devoured by the fowls of the air, as is still practised by them, collected the bones in a dry state, and thus deposited them in or near some temple, to repose under its sacred protection. This mode of sepulture seems strongly to resemble that which was formerly practised in Egypt with the Ibis : and it exemplifies the use of the black naphtha, or bitumen; first, as securing the remains from wet, and consequent decomposition, and afterwards as serving perhaps to bitumenize, that is, to saturate the wrappers as well as the body itself. * The substance, while fresh, contains a great proportion of volatile spirit, or oil. This is observable in its nascent state from the pits or springs, and in the portions of it on the surface of the streams which flow from them, wherever the current does not prevent them from aggregating. The Arab men and women are of very strong make, broad shoul dered, muscular, and short. One man, noted for his strength, has been known to carry on his back a full pipe of Madeira. The same man carried 700 lb. weight of rice in bags for two miles; and after going rather more than half the distance, he took up a little child and placed it on one side of his load to adjust the equilibrium. This feat was, I understood, performed for a sum of money offered by General Sir John Malcolm. The Arab women go in small parties, a distance of two or three miles from the town, to draw water from wells; that near the town being brackish, and productive of a medicinal effect on those who drink it. The mode practised by them of securing their burden on their back, and bearing it home, appears very primitive ; and being * On communicating these ideas to Dr. Reece, with the specimens of naphtha which I ^ave im, le investigated the subject, and the results of his analysis have corroborated the statement. — See Gazette of Health, No. xxviii. p. 866 .FEMALE WATER-CARRIERS. 21 peculiarly Arabic, (according to what I observed at Muscat,) may de serve to be detailed. Some of the party proceeding to the wells, carry ropes of hair fastened to small leather buckets, with which the water is filled into vehicles called mushuks. These are made of the skins of goats, kids, or sheep, tanned whole, after cutting off the head and feet. The skin of the neck is left open as a funnel for the water, and the holes remaining, on detaching the feet, are tied up and turned inwards. The whole skin, thus prepared, forms a bag for water, which is denominated a mushuk. This vessel, when filled with water, being of considerable weight, is raised and fastened to the back, a little above the loins, by means of a flexible rope, or flat band of hair, about six feet long, carried for the purpose along with the empty mushuk. In preparing for the burden, the rope is doubled and laid on the ground, with the ends twelve inches asunder. The mushuk is laid across, midway between the noose end of this bended rope and its extremities, and it is then filled with water, which is secured by doubling back the skin of the neck, and then tying it with a nar row thong of leather. The woman to whom it belongs seats herself before it on the ground, between the ends of the rope ; she then passes the band or noose over her head, so as when tightened, to reach to the pit of her stomach. Then drawing the two ends of the rope under her arms, she passes them through the loop and pulls them down wards as tight as she can. In this recumbent posture, attaching to herself the mushuk, she draws up her legs so as to obtain a footing on the ground ; then, holding the ropes with one hand, she gives the other to one of her companions, who standing with her feet asunder draws her up; and in this manner they mutually raise each other, and afterwards return together to the town. &gt; When men go to draw water, they drive before them a number of asses, each loaded with a pair of mushuks, and they scrupulously avoid going to the same well to which the women resort. Asses, being cheaper than any other beast of burden, and requiring less attention, are generally employed for domestic carriage by the lower classes of Arabs and Persians. From Bahrem, an island near the22 ARABIAN BAG-PIPERS. opposite or Arabian shore of the Gulf, an ass is imported into Persia of a peculiar breed, generally of a white colour, much valued by opulent persons for riding, its pace being a most pleasant amble, ft is so ex traordinarily strong and active that it frequently sells for thirty pounds sterling, while the common ass of Persia seldom fetches more than so many shillings. Hearing that there were itinerant musicians who played on the original Arabian bag-pipe, I sent for one of them, and while he was per forming on the instrument, I made the accompanying drawing of him along with which is given a representation of a native Arab of * The following remarks on the subject were communicated to me by Dr. Samuel Meyrick, to whom I had shown the drawing. “ We have been long in the habit of re garding the bag-pipes as a Scotch national instrument j but on an attentive investigation^ we shall find that the Arabs are more entitled to the honour of its invention, it being undoubtedly an Asiatic instrument. Many illuminations and rude sculptures still existing, show that it was known to the Saxons; and the ancient documents of the Irish, prove that it was in use among that people. Walker, however, in his memoir of the Irish bards, p. 77 ., after canvassing the point, acknowledges that this instrument was borrowed from the Scotch, and there is every reason to conclude that the Saxons had it from the same source. Whence then did our Highlanders procure it ? In digging up the foundations of the Praetorian Camp at Richborourgh in Kent, there was found a small bronze figure of a Roman soldier playing on the bag-pipes, of which Mr. King in his Munimenta Antique, vol. ii. p. 22 . pi. xx., has given three views. The Romans therefore first introduced this instrument into Britain; and from an inscription found on the Danube, we learn that a College of Utricularii, or bag-pipers, had been instituted to supply performers for the bands of the legions, as in those of our modern Highland Regiments. We farther learn that the temple for their use was dedicated to the goddess Nemesis, an Asiatic military divinity, the avenger of injuries. But we trace the Roman origin of the Scotch bag-pipes in another circumstance; viz. that anciently the piper received his education in a college of pipers in the Isle of Skye. Still, however, the Romans regarded this as the instrument of peasants, and therefore of Etruscan origin; for Nero, when sick, vowed he would play upon it in public, as soon as he was well enough, and could act Turnus upon the stage. Now, the Etruscans were originally from Greece; and we learn from Aulus Gellius, that the bag-pipes were used by the Lacedaemonians, and from other authors, that it was called by the Greeks ’Ao-xauA^c, i. e. bag-pipes. There is, moreover, in the Albani Museum at Rome, a Grecian sculpture of a shepherd playing on this instrument. Propertius, alluding to the Asiatic victory of Augustus, says his triumph will be celebrated with the bag-pipes, which makes one look to that quarter of the globe for its origin.

In the back ground are represented Arabian women drawing water in the manner described. In Bushire there are some Armenian families of great respectability. The religious ceremonies and general manners of these Christians are but little known, and for this reason, Captain Salter and I availed ourselves of an invitation to attend at a baptism, at the house of Koja Arretoon, the principal Armenian merchant of the place, and a gentle man who is strongly attached to the English interest. I had brought letters of credit to him from Bombay, on the supposition that the British resident, Mr. Bruce, might be at a distance at the time of our arrival; but of course they were not resorted to, as Mr. Bruce himself supplied us with cash and all else that was required. The ceremony of Armenian baptism, as we observed it, is as follows. Near the door of the women’s apartment stands the priest in his robes. He reads prayers for fifteen minutes over the child, which, laid on bedding, is held by the god-father. (There is no god-motherj even at the christening of a girl, the wife of the god-father being con sidered as holding that function.) The god-father repeats many short sentences, dictated by the priest, as to the name of the child, his promises, as sponsor, See. 2dly, The child is removed into the women’s apartment, the door is shut, and a prayer is read by the priest outside, holding the handle of the lock: the door is then opened, and the priest, his assistants, a clerk, and the god-father enter; a large basin is placed at the table, with four candles round it; in a niche above this instrument, exhibited to the Etruscan Academy at Cortona by Signor Can. Maccari, who published a dissertation on it in the Vllth volume of their Literary Transactions, brings us at once to Asiatic Turkey. This Phrygian is clothed in two tunics, one rather longer than the other; a large mantle, close trowsers, and on his head a Phrygian hood. The similarity of the instrument, and the mode of playing on it, to that of the Arab is singularly striking. The bag is angular and pressed against the wrists and fore-arms; one of the pipes, however, has been broken off; the remaining one has three apertures for as many different notes. Upon the whole, therefore, Arabia seems to have the best claim to the origin of the bag-pipes. I should not, however, omit to mention that M. Sonnerat con siders the Tourti of the East Indians as a species of bag-pipes.” N24 ARMENIAN CEREMONY OF BAPTISM. the table is a golden crucifix studded with seven large precious stones, and there is a long glass vessel with sanctified oil. The priest prays over the basin ; then the assistant puts water into it, first hot, then cold, as required ; he next immerses the crucifix in the basin of water, praying all the while, and his assistant responding. The god-father during this time holds the child flat on the bedding below him: a little of the sanctified oil is then added drop by drop to the water, during which process, the priest and his assistant chaunt, the crucifix being previously removed from the water. 3dly, The child, entirely naked, is taken up and put into the basin by the priest, who with his hands laves every part of the infant’s body; it is then taken out and wrapped up. The priest pronounces the baptismal name and some prayers, which the god-father repeats after him, and takes up the glass of oil, praying all the while ; then bringing it near the child, he dips his thumb in the vessel, and rubs oil first on the child’s fore head, then behind each ear, subsequently on the chin, the eyes, mouth, and nose ; then the breasts, the hands, the back, the abdo men, and the top of each foot, praying the whole time, and the clerk responding. 4thly, The child being dressed by the nurse in rich clothes, is given to the god-father, when the bishop comes in, invested in embroidered robes and a black silk hood over his head, and attend ed by two or three priests. The bishop places himself at the head of a procession formed of priests two by two, followed by the officiat ing priest, next to whom is the god-father bearing the child: they pass in this order to the public apartment, where the females in their best dresses are assembled, sitting along three sides of the room on cushions placed near the walls. The mother, who is veiled, sits apart on cushions, as in state, on the other side. When the bishop enters the room, the ladies all rise and remain standing. The god father places the child in the lap of the mother, who remains veiled as before. The bishop takes the book and reads a short prayer, to which responses are given by the other priest. During this concluding part of the ceremony, the officiating priest holds a prayer-book in contact with the mother’s head; when it is finished, the god-father bows toARMENIAN LADIES. 25 the company and retires with the bishop and priests to another suite of apartments on the side of the house appropriated to the males, ♦ where a breakfast-table is laid out for a numerous assembly. This repast commences by cups full of a beverage resembling tea, but com posed of a decoction of cinnamon, cloves, rose-water, sugar, and water: a cup of this is handed to each guest, shortly after which they sit down to a table covered with curries, fish, omelettes, and conserves of different sorts, with boiled rice and bread, and tea for the European gentlemen. On this occasion, I had an opportunity of seeing most of the Ar menian ladies of distinction in Bushire, and I am sorry that they can not be commended generally for superior beauty, either of counte nance or form: their persons were mostly broad and short, particularly those who were past the age of twenty; nor was the lower part of their dress at all graceful, though resembling some of our old fashions. The Armenian head-dress which they still retain, is altogether very handsome: it consists of a low-crowned stiff cap of silk or satin, on which is tied a frontlet of precious stones or embroidery; over the back part of this cap is thrown a three-cornered handkerchief of any colour, according to the wearer’s fancy,—that worn by elderly persons is generally white. It is brought under the chin, and then returned and tied on the top of the head. Under the handkerchief there is an oblong coloured net, drawn in a similar way over the back of the head, and hanging down so low as to cover the neck and chest. In company, young ladies alone have their mouths uncovered; those in their teens have a cloth over their chins: the married females wear this cloth over their mouths, and sometimes even on the point of the * nose. It is but justice to state here, that the Armenian ladies had gene rally fine black eyes and hair, with large eye-brows. Their com plexions were fair, some of them very much so; although, as might be expected from their habitual seclusion at home, they showed little freshness and no bloom. This defect may in a certain degree be attributed to their very early marriages. The Armenians are notARMENIANS IN GENERAL. esteemed by the Persians, because they are always engaged in trade, money-lending, and other pursuits of lucre. Generally speaking, they maybe said to be regarded in this country as the Jews are in Europe; but the few Jews who are established in Persia are still more despised than the Armenians,CHAPTER III.

On the 10th of April, with the assistance of Mr. Bruce, who had furnished us with riding horses from his stable, we agreed with a mule-driver for the hire of six mules for our baggage and servants, under the following arrangement. For Captain Salter and myself were reserved two mules each, one for the carriage of two clothes’ trunks and two portmanteaus, and another for bedding and servants. The two remaining mules were for our mutual service, one bearing camp and liquor-cases, and the other being loaded with liquor in two country packages, (Persian baskets covered with leather,) as also salt provisions, rice, flour, and biscuit, with a light folding table, and camp stools. These particulars may seem too minute to be stated, but they are among the essential preparations for so extensive a journey. It was stipulated that from Bushire to Shirauz the hire for each mule should be 16 piastres, or 12! rupees, (each rupee being nearly equal to ll piastre,) provided it bore a full load of 40 Tabriz mauns, of 7f lb. each maun, being 300 lbs. ; and if the animal should be required to carry a man or woman, the load of baggage should be proportionally reduced to about 80 or 100 lbs. The muleteer agrees to be only eleven days on the road to Shirauz, allowing two days for his halting at Kauzeroon; and in addition to the above sum he is to receive a donation of six rupees, if his at tention and behaviour on the road prove satisfactory. On the 12th, as the weather continued cold, we provided ourselves with each a cumlee, or coarse woollen cloth cloak (chokha), such as is e 228 BOORAUZGOON. worn by the Arabs, with a leathern bottle for drinking-water, and a goat-skin or mushuk to contain water for culinary purposes, washing, &amp;c. We also engaged a cook at twenty piastres a month and his victuals, or in lieu of the latter, | piastre diem. Our personal servants have twenty rupees pay, per month, and their victuals; each rides a mule lightly loaded with bedding and baggage. It may here be mentioned that a gentleman travelling alone, ought to provide himself with two bags, made either of carpeting or canvass, to con tain his bedding and night-clothes; these bags to be thrown over the riding mule. If two gentlemen travel together, the bags may be made large enough to serve for two packages of bedding, each about the bulk of those used in a ship-cot, and even on these, with the requisite pillows, blankets, &amp;c. a man may ride without incon venience. On the 13th at night, the muleteer sent his bags and rope of goats- hair, and on the morning of the 14th he brought the mules and loaded them. He first secured each trunk or package by sewing it up in a goats-hair bag; two of these were then lifted on the mule and tied together. Having completed the loading, he set forward with our servants, and arrived by noon at his ground, an open plain of grass, two miles beyond Chuggaduck. We departed from the factory at three in the afternoon, and ar rived at Chuggaduck at half-past six. Not finding our party with the mules there, we proceeded, and in about half an hour came up with them on a plain of herbage. Having drank tea, we retired to rest in the open air, our beds being laid on the ground. We resumed our journey a little before midnight, and about eight in the morning of the 15th arrived at Boorauzgoon. There is no caravansera at this place, but we were accommodated with cover under the thatched gateway of a Jew’s house. The country we had traversed from Bushire to this, was a flat sandy plain, interspersed with villages and cultivated tracts. Near Boor auzgoon we observed some extensive fields of barley and wheat, amongst which grew wild oats, and the white and red poppy. InBOORAUZGOON. 29 some parts the crops had been cut and removed, in others they were ready for reaping, others again required a fortnight more to ripen them. The numerous fields into which these plains were subdivided had no hedges or banks to separate them from each other, or even from the woods; many parts were moist with salt water, and we crossed two salt pools or streams, which traversed the road from right to left. During the march from Bushire in the heat of the evening, the glare occasioned great pain to the eyes. The night air was so cold, v as to force us to dismount several times, in order to acquire warmth by walking; yet by eight o’clock in the day, the heat of .the sun was so powerful, and the light-coloured sand, unscreened by trees or vegetation of any kind, reflected the solar rays so intensely over the country, that our eyes and faces suffered greatly, and we were obliged to remain in the hut during the day. Here, as well as at Bushire, sore eyes and scorbutic complaints in the gums are very prevalent, occasioned probably by the intense glare of light, a fish diet, with no adequate portion of vegetable food, and a general want of cleanliness. Sore eyes may be produced from some of these causes, but as the complaint is endemic, it may perhaps be with reason attributed to the great number of common flies, and particularly to a very small one like a midge, which is continually settling on the eyelids, and there probably deposits the seeds of the disease. After a few days’ journey from Bushire, the traveller quits the low country of Dushtistan, and it is then necessary to be prepared against extreme heat by day and cold by night. A green gauze covering for the face, made sufficiently loose and large, relieves it from the painful glare of the sun, and at the same time defends it against the small flies which abound in the low country during spring. It may also serve as a protection against musquitoes, which are very annoying and troublesome at night. The fatigue of travel ling is no doubt greatly alleviated by commencing the march soon after midnight, but it is difficult to obtain sufficient rest during the day on account of the heat and the flies, as well as the various inter ruptions occasioned by noise, and by the inquisitive intrusion ofDAULEKEE. 30 the Persians, who importune a stranger for medicines, or stand gazing at him and incessantly teazing him with questions. Some of them press forward offering a flower or fruit, and if either be accepted, they expect a present of money in return. Having mounted our horses and resumed the route at half-past two, we arrived at Daulekee soon after seven, and put up in an ex cellent caravansera. About half way to this place there is a post, on the approach to which, on the left, the road is very stony, and is in tersected by the rocky beds of many mountain streams, which at this season were dry. The hills extend parallel to the road at the dis tance of one or two miles, the whole way. About 2f miles from Daulekee is perceived a very strong smell of the black naphtha, pe troleum, or perhaps asphaltum; and at two miles the road is tra versed by a greenish coloured stream of lukewarm water, having a salt and rather acid taste. This stream rises at the foot of a rocky hill about 400 yards distant, from four or five different sources, some gushing from rocks under the hill, and others bubbling up from a marshy spot, which seems to be their point of confluence. On immersing the hand into the water, where it first issues into the open air, it is found very hot; it has a strong pungent bitter taste, and little aluminous: this is the case with all the streams, which are also quite clear at their sources. In one spot, the water, on its descent along the face of the hill, has left a white powder, which on tasting I found to be sharp and acid. It is used for acidulating water to drink, which with the admixture of any sweetening ingredient is denominated sherbet. This term, applied generally to every beverage consisting of water, holding in solution a sweet and an acid, is more appropriate than that of lemonade in its extended acceptation. The surface of the plain below this place, on the left, for some miles, appears as if impregnated with salt, which it imparts to the stream, whose waters at their source have perhaps little or no salt. There alum and sulphur, with a little bitumen may possibly predominate; the acid, I should presume, is derived from the upper surface of thePITS OF BLACK NAPHTHA. SI hill and plain, and the salt is only combined with it afterwards. Within half a mile of the former stream two others cross the road, having their sources in the hills, distant about a quarter of a mile to the right of the road. The last, which has by far the most copious and strongest current, has very great quantities of a bituminous oily sub stance floating on it, which collects in large black patches on pools near the margin of the stream. About 400 yards distant from it, in a plain on the left of the road, are several pits which have been dug for the purpose of collecting the black naphtha. It rises to within three feet, and in some instances one foot from the surface: these pits are ten or twelve feet deep, and about the same space in diameter. Black naphtha, as it is called in Persia, to distinguish it from an exceedingly fine and nearly colourless oil called white naphtha, which is found near the Bucktiari mountains, between Shuster and Ramhor- mus, is, I have reason to believe, the bituminous substance used as a cement in ancient architecture. In this substance the reeds must have been steeped which are found in layers between the bricks in the ruins existing on and near the supposed site of Babylon. To corroborate this conclusion, it is observable that pits similar to those here described are found at Kerkook, near the road between Bagdad and Kermanshah. The naphtha thence procured is now used as a coating for the bottoms of canoes, for the surfaces of the pieces of wood which support the flat roofs of houses, and generally in all cases where it is necessary to preserve timber from the effects of moisture, as in mills, &amp;c. I collected some of the salt deposited on the margins of the first- mentioned streams, and some portions of the black naphtha from the pits, which I shah deposit with the Geological Society in London. The acid taste is stronger in the first-mentioned stream than in any of the others. These waters, after their junction, take a west ward course, and give motion to a small corn-mill, very strongly built in the form of a tower, no doubt for the sake of defence. The aspect of the mountains in this vicinity is extremely precipitous and rugged. They appear to consist principally of limestone.32 PITS OF BLACK NAPHTHA. In this village, which seems to be hastening to decay, the muleteer, contrary to his promise, halted for a day, alleging as an excuse that the mules of the prince (the King’s son) of Shirauz, were entiusted to his charge, and that one of them had been lost on the last day’s march; that to have them with us would be a protection, and he therefore felt anxious to wait a day for the purpose of finding the strayed mule, and of allowing time for those remaining behind to join us. Neither threats nor fair words could induce him to leave the prince’s mules and fulfil his agreement with us; he only declared that he would make up for lost time by longer marches hereafter, and with this assurance, having no alternative, we were obliged to content ourselves. The caravansera of this place is spacious and well built, containing about thirty-six rooms, and capable of affording accommodation to two hundred travellers with their cattle and baggage, with perfect security from heat and rain. There is a very considerable plantation of date-trees, extending from S.W. to N.W. at the distance of about a mile and a half from Daulekee. The trees grow to a very superior size, and the dates which they produce are so prepared as to be softer and more luscious than any others that I ever tasted. This is the only place at which they are so prepared and preserved, and they are hence carried for sale all over Persia, where they are held in high estimation. Their fine flavour is no doubt derived from some peculiar qualities in the soil. Dates and sour milk, often mixed, form the principal articles of food among the inhabitants of the low country. The black naphtha, already mentioned, is applied to a variety of useful purposes. It is found efficacious as a remedy for the scabies or mange in camels, being rubbed upon the parts affected when shorn of the hair. Cloths dipped in it are formed into flambeaux for weddings and other festivities. The tepid streams in the dis trict where it is found, are reported to be highly salubrious, and strangers travelling this way are recommended to bathe in them.KONAR TAKHT. 33 This is an advantage of some consequence in a situation, which on account of its lowness, and the proximity of the bare rocky mountains, is exposed to intense heat during the day, and particularly in the evening, when the solar rays striking directly on their sides, are re flected on the town, and, if the wind then abates, render the air ex tremely sultry. From some Jews settled at Boorauzgoon, our second day’s halting place, I purchased several antique stones of rings, of onyx and chal cedony, and a red like spinelli or ruby, with Greek, Cufic, and Syriac inscriptions. Some of them contained representations of animals, as griffins, beasts and birds, but most of them bore the signs of the zodiac, with figures of the sun, moon, and stars. These antiques are found by the wandering tribes of Illyauts from whom the Jews pur chase them. Sometimes the women and children of those tribes wear them as rings and amulets on the arms and neck, or sewed as ornaments in their caps, for which purpose they are perforated. These Illyauts find also coins of gold, silver, and copper, bearing Arabic, Greek, and many of them Cufic characters, of which I obtained some specimens. After a march of six hours, we arrived at Konar Takht, a village situated in the valley or rather plain of Khisht, which we found com pletely covered with fields of wheat and barley. It extends about eight miles N.W. and S. E., and is in width about three miles. It has several villages, and two very large plantations of date-trees. The Illyauts frequently encamp here for the purpose of foraging their flocks. Respecting these wandering tribes of Illyauts, who are undoubtedly of Tartar origin, it may be necessary here to state that they inhabit the mountains on the west and south-west confines of Persia. Their peculiar habits of life do not seem to have varied from those recorded of their ancestors at the period of the march of Alexander through Persia. On the first appearance of spring, early in March, they very slowly move forth with their flocks and under tents, from the moun-34 WANDERING TRIBES OF ILLYAUTS. tains to the plains in their vicinity, taking that direction in which they know from experience that grasses are first found. Their mode of migration I find to be simply this. A spot within a few miles having been fixed upon by their chief, they load their camels, horses, bullocks, and other beasts of burden with the clothing, tents, carpets, ropes, shearing and spinning implements, and in short every thing required by the party either for use or for future sale; and after sun rise they move off in a body toward the appointed ground, the sheep, goats, and unloaded cattle being separately driven, to graze slowly and progressively in that direction. On their arrival in the evening, the tents of the party are found pitched either on the slope of a mountain, or in some sheltered spot, secured from the violence of winds, and not far distant from water. When the party is large, and the tents numerous, they pitch three or four in a group ; at the dis tance of thirty or forty yards a similar group, and thus for the whole encampment, its general direction being parallel to the mountain which shelters them. The flocks belonging to each division are secured around its respective tents. By this regulation the flocks are kept separate, and obtain their due proportion of forage; and at the same time the various detachments composing the community are within call of each other when assistance is required. When the forage becomes exhausted in one spot, the party mi grate to another in the same order, and occupy it under the same regulation, thus making during the summer and autumn a circular trip or tour out and home. They return to the mountains for the winter, and live during the months of December, January, and Fe bruary in villages or caves, or in those parts of the mountains where fuel is abundant. This mode of life, without any variation, is pursued by them in preference to every other. It will be gratifying in the sequel to obtain opportunities for collecting further particulars re specting these obscurely known, but happy and no doubt well dis posed people. The plain or valley of Khisht, though in itself perfectly flat, isCARAVANSERAS. 35 surrounded by hills and mountains. The caravansera* at the village of Konar Takht is extremely good, and has one suite of three apartments over the gateway. The whole route hither from Daulekee is stony; and the ascent of the mountain-pass called Kotuleh Muloo is very steep and difficult. * As frequent mention will be made of caravanseras in the course of this Journey, it may not be improper to give the reader a general idea of them. They are buildings, or small forts, erected on the public roads, for the accommodation and security of travellers, with their cattle and merchandise. They are generally from 60 to 200 feet in diameter, of good masonry altogether, and often faced round the basement, to about three or four feet from the ground, with large cut stones. They are mostly square in form, with towers for defence at the angles; but some are octangular. In the middle there is an open area, the sides of which are divided into rooms, with small and rather flat-arched roofs; be tween them and the outer enclosure wall there is a long space, which is also arched above, and lighted only by small openings in the arches. This space is allotted to the cattle, and the entrances to it are generally at the angles, so that the beasts, when un* loaded in the open area, proceed by these openings past the rooms, then turn to the right or left, and are sheltered from the weather in this stabling. The outer wall which encloses it has no other opening towards the country than loop-holes for defence. The front toward the public road has in the centre large folding-gates, of sufficient height and breadth to admit the passage of loaded camels. The outer wall, which is about 18 or 20 feet high, is carried up two or three feet higher than the roofs of the rooms, to form a parapet; and a sort of uneven rampart is made, by filling only part of the space between the arches with masonry, so that persons may walk over the roofs of the rooms in every direction. At night, the gates are shut, and barred within; and when danger is apprehended, armed men, stationed within the caravansera, keep watch on the tops of the walls. In the very hot weather, travellers often sleep on the terraced roofs of the rooms or cells, where they find more air than within, and are less annoyed by fleas and musquitoes. As these buildings are placed at the interval of a short march from one to the other, and are often the only habitations to be found within many miles of the road, they are generally occupied by the male part of a poor family, who reside in them as door-keepers, and have for sale a small stock of fuel, grass, or chopped straw; and sometimes, though rarely, dates, flour, tobacco, and even mutton, fowls, and eggs. The finest of these caravanseras have almost all been originally built by order of Shah Abbas the Great, and are about 230 years old. Notwithstanding their antiquity, so dry and temperate is the climate of Persia, where extremes of heat and moisture are never known, that the brick-masonry is in general as fresh in appearance as that of a house of the same materials in England, of only two years’ standing. F 236 PLAIN OF KHISHT. The direct elevation may be estimated at about 1200 feet, but the pass itself is longer and more winding than those of India. In some parts it leads along the verge of precipices from 100 to 200 feet in perpendicular height, washed at their base by a rapid and deep river, with a rocky and sandy bottom. In one of the narrowest places we unfortunately met another caufla, or drove of camels, laden with cotton, &amp;c. which we passed with very great precaution and in immi nent danger. One loaded mule, moving sideways, slipped from the precipice and rolled down, with his load sometimes above and at others below him, to a considerable distance, but was recovered some hours afterwards, and had not apparently sustained much injury. The mountains are throughout very precipitous, and destitute of trees, and have but few bushes on them. They seemed to consist princi pally of sandstone and limestone of different degrees of hardness. Sometimes strata of the harder kind of sandstone extend through the mountains, alternating with a dark-coloured substance resembling indurated or compact clay which crumbles into pieces of a cubic form, and is no doubt easily soluble in water, as it is in some parts washed away by the beating rain, leaving the strata of reddish and yellow sandstone, projecting many feet beyond the surface. The in clination of these strata is generally 10 or 15 degrees from the hori zontal plane. In one place the mountains facing to the westward exhibit in that direction a crust of the hard sandstone above men tioned, with other rocks and soil behind. I saw one instance of this stratum in nearly a perpendicular position, about 150 feet high, having the columnar appearance of basalt. The substance, however, was evidently even, or flat surfaced, and merely divided by fissures run ning parallel to each other, at distances of two or three feet. On arriving at the top of this pass, from which a view was taken, we entered on the plain of Khisht. Among the grain in the fields I remarked red poppies, larkspur, daisies, wild oats, wild pinks, mal lows, and some flowers of the convolvulus, and other genera, which I had never seen before. This being the spring season they were allMENDICITY IN PERSIA. covered somel!

The goats and sheep of this part of Persia appear to have much finer hair and wool than those of India. The goats resemble those of Karamania and Cashmeer in the following respects : — they have small heads, short legs, and large bodies, the hair of which nearly reaches the ground. Both male and female have beards, and they have each a lock of hair hanging forward from the crown of the head. This peculiarity I observed in those from Cashmeer sent to England by Sir Evan Nepean from Bombay. The texture of the hair was very silky and shining. The prevailing colour of the goats was a reddish brown, in some instances graduating to white or black. The sheep were also of a reddish brown colour with soft curled wool, but not long. These being the predominating colours of the woollen cumlees of the country, I conclude that they are manufactured from this ma terial in the natural grain, without being dyed. The price of a goat with its kids was six rupees, and that of a sheep with its lamb or lambs, fifteen. Here also the cost of a fowl was one rupee. To all travellers in these districts, and particularly to Europeans, it must excite a most painful feeling to meet daily with so great a num ber of poor, blind, and sick beggars. Men, women, and children, mostly in rags, and in some instances naked, notwithstanding the extreme cold of the winter, crowd around the traveller and importune him for relief, either in medicine or money, clothes or food. The incessant recurrence of these scenes, and the multitude of miserable objects which present themselves, produce a mingled emotion of amazement and grief, on which the mind dwells involuntarily without being able to define it. To what end has Providence ordained that so many helpless and unoffending beings, so many children of tender age, should be doomed to a life of diversified and perpetual suffering, heightened by the rapacity of unfeeling neighbours, who take by force the clothes, the money, and even at times the food which a passing charity may have distributed among them ! Or rather, what must beKUMAREDGE. 38 the state of society in which such miseries and such abuses are suf fered to exist, as if belonging to the necessary course of things, and wholly incapable of remedy ! On the 19 th of April we marched to Kumaredge. In consequence of the difficulty of the pass which lay before us, we could not set out before day-light. The pass is of no great length, but so excessively steep, that we were three hours in ascending it. Of late it has been much infested by robbers. About two miles beyond its termination we passed the original caravansera, which has ceased to be frequented in consequence of the unremitted attacks of the Maumehsunny rob bers : its doors and walls are now overgrown with grass and weeds. Travellers, instead of halting here, now go on about a mile farther; to the almost deserted village of Kumaredge. It would be difficult to describe the mountains and precipices of this second pass. They are so abrupt and angular, that though in reality stupendous, they resemble in appearance a shelving bank of sand, or earth, composed of strata of different colours, worn into deep channels in various places by the overflowing of water in rapid currents. The ridges left by these were acute, and often nearly per pendicular, having strata of a reddish stone, apparently sand-stone, projecting at different angles of inclination, and forming dams to the streams flowing over them through the clefts, in the manner of a cascade. The ascending path, for a road it could not be called, had every where a precipice on either one side or on the other; and in two places, near the summit, a fissure had taken place, which had separated from the rock that portion over which the path lay, and which will probably soon fall. At one of these places had been erected a wall about eight inches high, for security. The view of the abyss immediately below, from the immense elevation above it, occasioned a slight vertigo, which would have increased if I had not turned away, and fixed my sight on the rock near me, to the left hand. On our arrival at Kumaredge, we found that almost all the inhabi tants had fled from the village, in alarm at a robbery which hadMAUMEHSUNNY ROBBERS. 39 taken place in its vicinity. The circumstances were as follow: Some men from Scind, bringing presents for the Shah Zeada, or Prince Governor of Shiraz, arrived at Bushire, where they very foolishly boasted of the articles they had in charge. After a few days’ stay, they quitted that place with a few armed men, and pursued their journey, which was attended with no particular occurrence until they left Kumaredge. On entering the hills, about three miles distant from that place, they were attacked by a party of Maumehsunny rob bers, of much greater force than their own, who wounded three of them with swords and spears, and took away the effects which they had in charge. It appears, that in the encounter two of the thieves were killed, and two or three wounded. One of the Kumaredge Sepoys, who had been sent as an escort with the party, was likewise killed. On receiving this intelligence, the Prince sent a large de tachment of horse to seize the head men of Kumaredge, and inflict vengeance on them for neglecting to guard their passes, or rather perhaps for not defending the presents coming to himself, by station ing armed men on the heights to be on the watch, and to fire on any party that was seen out of the high road. The inhabitants, on ob taining information of this act of the Prince, fled from the village. The horsemen placed it under the authority of another head-man, and after plundering it while they staid there, for ten days, departed. On the afternoon of the day we arrived, the inhabitants were be ginning to return. Among them was one poor woman, who, on being told that her goat had been spared, and was in the house where we put up, came to look for it, and in keen anguish for the loss of all else that she possessed, exclaimed, on pulling forth the goat from the hole in which it lay, “ Why, in the name of God, did the hard-hearted rascals leave you? they ought to have taken all I had.” It was evident that the animal had been thus exempted on account of its age and infirmity: it was too old to be of any use, or it would certainly not have been spared. This severe visitation on a whole village, compared with the40 KAUZEROON. occasion of it, places in no very favourable point of view the internal government of the country. Our muleteer, who, as we now found, had halted at Daulekee to procure some loads of fresh dates, and not, as he then pretended, to recover the Shah Zeada’s mule, would not move before day-light. On coming to the spot where the Scindians had been attacked, he fired several pistols and muskets, and sent to request that we would not be in advance, but keep all together with him, doubtless with a view to his own security. He walked armed on the flank of the kaufla, or caravan, along the ascent of the heights. But though the country appeared certainly very favourable to plunderers, we sustained no attack, and arrived in little more than six hours at Kauzeroon, a larger place than any that we had hitherto passed. A horseman having been dispatched to ask the Khaun’s, or Governor s, leave for us to put up at his garden-house, we obtained it, and were delighted with the prospect and fragrance of more than two hundred rose-trees and orange-trees, with a profusion of various flowers, all in bloom. The garden is so little attended to, that it has become the resort of idlers, who here smoke, or gather roses, &amp;c. and enjoy their fragrance, and the delights of the garden walks, without reserve. Here flowers are of little or no value; beggars often collect them, to offer them to passers by, when they accost them, with very little humility, and often great importunity, for relief.CHAPTER IV.

DESOLATE COUNTRY NEAR SHIRAUZ. — ARRIVAL AT THAT CITY. &gt; i * • , In order to lose no time, we sent our letters of introduction; and, as most ot the persons to whom they were addressed were absent, the Khaun Governor sent a horseman and letter to Meer Shemshed- din, a noted chieftain of the Maumehsunny, or Bucktiaries, whose resi dence was about twenty miles distant, and near the ruins of Shah- poor, with directions for him to attend me there the next morning, and accompany me to all the remarkable sculptured rocks, particularly to the caves and other curiosities. The Khaun at the same time sent to inform me, that he would himself appoint two more horsemen, armed, to conduct me safe to Shahpoor, and return with me. At five the next morning, the 21st, I set out from Kauzeroon, and proceeded to Dariez, seven miles distant, on the road which we had travelled the day before. Quitting it at this place, I went by a little fortified place called Talgoouc, four miles from Dariez, and without halting there advanced to the entrance of the Shahpoor valley. Having viewed the celebrated tablets of sculpture, so well described by Morier and others, I proceeded directly toward the cave, which is reputed to contain a colossal statue, overthrown and mutilated. A bad road led along the windings of a rapid river, having crossed which, I proceeded until I found it impossible to ride any farther, and dismounted. I here heard the report of fire-arms, and perceived some armed men advancing, who proved to be Meer Shemshed-42 ASCENT TO THE CAVES. din, with twelve armed horsemen, and as many dogs. His younger brother, a fine youth, was of the party. As soon as the salutations were over, the chieftain most earnestly pressed me to postpone my return, as I was then sixteen miles from Kauzeroon, and to sleep at his house, not more than three miles farther in the mountains, towards Keelasuffeed. To this I at first felt obliged to accede; and he then told his brother, and three or four dismounted horsemen, that they were to go to the caves with me. Leaving him, at his own request, to guard our horses, I began to ascend along a stony pro jecting part of the hill, which might be called one of its buttresses. As I advanced, the mountain became exceedingly steep and slippery, and I was obliged to rest five or six times to take breath, and recover from a tremor of the limbs, occasioned by sheer exertion. The fa tigue was rendered more oppressive by the heat of the sun, reflected from the white rocks, which occasioned a parching thirst, and a most intense head-ache. Proceeding very leisurely, I at length arrived at the caves about half-past ten, having been more than an hour in ascending. Near the top, it was necessary to climb over a rock nearly perpendicular; and I had to avail myself of the assistance of three of the young men who accompanied me, including the brother of Meer Shemsheddin. Two of them took hold of my feet and lifted me up; while a third, having placed himself barefooted on a small projecting ledge of rock, reached forth one hand to me, and held to the rock above him by the other. In this way, with much caution and perseverance, I gained the mouth of the cave, by which time I was in a fever. On the ascent, I had a great anxiety for water, but not a drop was to be had: one of the party brought me a bunch of berries, which I ate; but another, doubtless an experienced mountaineer, gave me a plant, quite green, which appeared to be either sorrel, or, if there be such a thing, acid purslain: it is called toorshack, which term means acidulous, and is found in the wilds: these hardy soldiers take it to allay thirst; and it produced that effect °n. nie t0 such a de g re e, as to enable me to proceed without re quirmg water.DIMENSIONS OF THE STATUE. 43 Having entered the cave, I went to the statue, and after examining it, lay down on its pedestal, and having paid a man to go for a tea pot and some bread, I soon after refreshed myself with tea, the water being procured at a distance of about 400 feet within the dark part of the cave. When first brought it was so cold as to pain my teeth in drinking it, but sufficiently quenched my thirst. I then forced my self to drink hot tea without milk, but could not take the least quantity of solid food. After I had finished my sketch of the statue *, a large bundle of dry grass and another of wood were brought, and my companions told me I should not have seen any thing worth notice if I departed without exploring the cave with lights, which they affirmed had never yet been completely done by any per son. One set of men, they observed, had come with many maunds of oil and mossauls, but they did not see all the cavities. In proceeding, I desired the men to lead, as far as they knew the # The following are the dimensions of the statue: Feet. Inches.

The opening of the entrance of the cave is 51 paces, or about 139 feet. Its height 50 feet. The breadth decreases somewhat within. The hall or grand dome, 150 feet from the entrance, is 120 feet in diameter, and about 100 feet high. The descent of the cave from the mouth, is about 2f feet in every 10.

G 244 ENORMOUS STALACTITES. caves, without using fire; then, taking out my pocket compass, I held by the garments of the chief’s brother and accompanied them. We went north for at least 150 feet, and then began to descend for about 40 feet farther, when I concluded, from the black mud beneath our feet, that we were at or near the bottom of an extensive circular room, the vault of which seemed exactly of that form ; it was 100 feet in height, and the diameter of the room might be 120 feet. At the north-east side of the circle I ascended about 15 feet, and then found two passages, one to the right or eastward, and the other to the north. ✓ I went along the latter at the entrance of which I found a stone cistern or tank, about 20 feet by ten, and 6 feet deep. It was dry, and the path led to the right of it. In this direction I proceeded about 80 feet, when my guides turned to the right, although some other road continued onward. It was here so dark that I could not discern any thing nor use the compass ; I judged the direction to be easterly. Holding by the man, I advanced about 100 feet farther, descending a little. They then told me I was near the water, and I desired them to light some straw, which they did, and we found ourselves in the centre of a large and irregularly shaped excavation surrounded by distorted and grotesque objects, which at first sight the imagination conceives to be figures. They are stalactites formed no doubt by exudation from the flat rocks above, which are at least 200 feet thick, and from fissures in the sides. Some of them had assumed the form of pillars, but the greater part were only irregular protuberances, like tortuous trunks of trees, adhering to the sides, and of various thick ness, from 6 or 8 inches to 30 feet in diameter; some extended to the roof; in others the corresponding accumulations of congealed matter above and below had only advanced half way to their junction. There were masses of stalactites projecting upwards, to the height of from 1 to 15 feet. I sent specimens of this substance to Bombay, along with others of the fallen statue and its base, with an account of its dimensions and those of the cave. The views that occasionally presented themselves as we advanced were terribly sublime, and their effect was the more impressive from46 KOTULEH DOKHTER. Some deep perpendicular lines under the feet behind would hardly deserve that appellation, as they seemed rather designed as channels to carry off the water from that part of the pedestal. One indication of the antiquity of this cave may require particular notice. When we reflect on the slow and imperceptible formation of stalactites, and on the thickness (exceeding 200 feet) of the lime-stone rock, hard as marble, through which the moisture which deposits them must find its way drop by drop ; and when we consider the amazing dimensions of these incrustations, we are totally at a loss for data to fix the period of their origin, or that of the excavations, which were doubtless com pleted by human labour. The entrance of the valley of Shahpoor has been formerly de fended by works on the mountains, particularly those on the S. E. side which do not rise so abruptly from the plain as those to the N. W. Of all these fortifications there remain but few vestiges; only here and there a tower is to be seen, and these do not seem to have been constructed with much art; the whole mass of the tower appears to have been formed of rough roundish stones and lime, with smaller stones filled in between them, and they have been connected only by a slight parapet of the same construction. The opening between the two hills is only 200 yards wide, and this space is at present so taken up by the rapid stream, and by the swampy ground covered with high reeds, that there is barely sufficient room v left for the road, which runs along the foot of the east range. The mountains extending in a connected chain from this spot to the Kotuleh Dokhter, and continuing thence so as to form the northern , boundary of a salt lake hereafter noticed, are of uniform structure, the S. W. front being of harder substance and more precipitous, par ticularly near the summit, which generally presents one perpendicular mass of stone, from 150 to 350 feet in height. Below this there is frequently a shelving mass of loose stones with some vegetation, and then another perpendicular stratum of rock is seen, of 60 or 80 feet in height; next to this is a looser soil, but altogether unfit for culti vation, consisting principally of a detritus of limestone. The N. E.TUNGEH CHEETOON. 47 face of the mountains appears in general more covered with ve getation and low trees, more sheltered from the winds, there being another chain of mountains to the N. E. running parallel to these. i i This entrance of the valley is called Tungeh Cheetoon, and appears to have been gradually formed by the flowing of the rapid torrent, now diminished to a rivulet, as the rocks on the left, or N. W. side, rise per pendicularly from its margin to the height of 500 feet. On this natural wall have been executed tablets of innumerable figures in basso relievo, in a style much superior to that of the principal ones on the right or opposite sides. At this season of the year it was difficult to examine closely the tablets to the N. W. of the pass, because at the base of the rocks below them, there is four or five feet water, not of the clear stream but of a muddy swamp, partly covered by reeds too high to look over. On this side I was unable to find out more than three, one of which, the farthest from the entrance, was very much defaced by time and weather. There were two on the opposite side, of which one had suffered greatly from the same causes. These antiquities have been particularly described by Morier. Of the situation and environs of the ancient city of Shahpoor, I formed a sketch by observation without exact measurement, from which it will be evident that the spot was chosen for its facilities of defence, being inaccessible in every direction except by the two passages of the river. After a halt of three days at Kauzeroon, occasioned by our mule teer’s negligence, or his abuse of power, we left it on the 24th. This town extends about a mile along the valley, but the houses, few of which are good, stand detached, and have all enclosures near them. A great proportion of them are falling to decay. There is one quarter inhabited by Jews, who are numerous in proportion to the population, and whose dwellings are in general well constructed. The old Jewish fort is uninhabited, and in ruins, overgrown with grass. The house of the Khaun appears a spacious and well looking edi-48 STATE OF KAUZEROON. flee. He maintains some show of consequence, and has a considerable armed retinue, both horse and foot. Kauzeroon is famed as having been the school, and perhaps the birth place of many of the most renowned Pylewauns, or wrestlers of former times; and it has still a zourkhauna or gymnasium, which retains a portion of its ancient notoriety. There is also a very old building of a circular form, the burial-place of Shah Humza, a peer or saint, to whom is ascribed the power of effecting miraculous cures on those who will testify their faith in his sanctity by prayers, accompanied with sufficient offerings at his shrine. Although the climate of this place is generally considered healthy, yet from the vicissitudes of heat and cold at this season, it can be so to those only who can avoid exposing themselves both by day and night. To labourers by day, and travellers by night its effects must be distressing. The pocket thermometer carried by Captain Salter, ex hibited the following differences: at sun-rise, that is, after five in the morning, 38°, and at ten, the same morning 98°; a very amazing change in five hours, and the more so as at the very time when the heat was here at 98°, the N. W. aspects of the hills in sight, at the dis tance of only 12 or 14 miles, were partially covered with snow. Within doors however the temperature was very equable, the variation of the thermometer being only from 50° to 76° in the twenty-four hours. It may here be remarked that in order to guard against the ill effects arising from these vicissitudes of heat and cold, the traveller ought so to arrange his clothing, as to be able promptly to augment, or diminish its warmth in a considerable degree daily, as occasion re quires. He has also to provide against another very great discomfort and annoyance, occasioned by the great quantities of flies, which not only infest him on the road, but harbour among the baggage and cattle-followers, and swarm in every halting place. A gauze covering for the face is absolutely requisite; and as the places of accommodation are seldom sheltered, or secured from the cold air by doors or case ments, it is necessary to be provided with an adequate quantity ofDEPARTURE FROM KAUZEROON. 49 cumlee or coarse woollen cloth to close those apertures, as also the crevices and breaches in walls. I should hope that the inconveniences here noticed occur only in spring, but then they are attended with another. The mu leteers never travel quick at this season, as it is the time for pas turing their cattle, and thus ensuring their health and strength during the remainder of the year. These evils, however, may to a great degree be avoided by proper precaution; and they are counter balanced by certain advantages peculiar to the period. All the plains are covered with corn, mingled with flowers; the valleys are refreshed by streams of water; even the rugged aspects of rocks and mountains are softened and enlivened by occasional patches of herb age ; the trees, among which frequently occurs the white-thorn, and one with a peach-blossom flower of great fragrance, are all in blos som ; in the valleys the air is really perfumed with the different wild flowers abounding in the grass, among which one of great potency, apparently the wild clveo-stock, predominates. We left the garden of Kauzeroon at four in the morning. The road was pretty good for the first six miles, until it leads over a rough stone causeway, crossing a swampy ground, which extends about two hundred yards on the left to the foot of the hills, and on the right about a mile and a half to a lake of salt water, running in an easterly direction. Here the road turns more to the N. E., and enters the rocky and stony ground of the adjoining hills, thus continuing to the ninth mile. At miles it ascends a steep and rocky mountain, of which the approach to the summit, for the last four hundred yards, is defended by parapet walls, built in a zig-zag direction, bounding that side of the road, alternately, which in its successive windings is nearest the precipice. These walls are well adapted to prevent ani mals from falling; and appear to be also highly advantageous for the perfect defence of the pass, as they are severally shouldered on the steep rocks, and cannot, without extreme labour and difficulty, be turned or enfiladed. At about eight miles, the summit of the short Kotuleh Dokhter,50 KOTULEH PEERA ZUN. or Pass of the Daughter, is gained; and there is a winding and gentle descent from it toward a valley, in which grow a great number ot stunted oaks, and other trees, the first we had seen, which also clothe to some extent the mountains to the northward. A mile farther, there is a small tank of water, at which travellers stop; and at the distance of 1 and 1 { miles are the villages of Adooee and Dashtabird, on the acclivity of the mountains to the left. At ISl miles, the road, hitherto level, begins to ascend the famous Kotuleh Peera Zun, or Pass of the Old Woman, which, although not very steep, is extremely stony. The rocks are all white, and there is abundance of dust of that colour. At the end of about 15 miles of distance, we halted at a small caravan sera with bad accommodations, at which no provision whatever could be obtained, nearer at hand than two miles. We sent for milk, which arrived, ready warmed and curdled by the sun, about three hours after we had breakfasted. Here we found three horsemen travelling to Shirauz. Our march, on account of the bad and stony road, had been but slow, and had occupied us six hours. We here found the tempera ture of the atmosphere very mild, the thermometer ranging from 48° to 63°, but mostly remaining at 56°. The adjacent hills bear great quantities of the bulloot, or oak tree, the timber of which is used in buildings, as well as for fuel and fences. The people grind the acorns into flour, storing them from year to year for that purpose; the agaric is used in tanning, or rather in fixing a reddish brown dye. Near the caravansera there runs a small limpid stream, conducted from the heights nearly impending over the place on the north side. Snow was still lodged on them; and its meltings probably supplied not only this but several other streams, which we traversed in this and the succeeding day’s march. It is the custom of the Persians to make long journeys on horse back, and they travel mostly in the night. Their saddles and other furniture are most simple; they use chains for fastening up their horses, which is done after a mode peculiar to themselves.DUSTARJOON. 51 We left the caravansera of Kotuleh Peera Zun at day-break, and entered upon a rocky path, which, after a continued ascent of three miles, led down toward the plains of Dustarjoon, the level tract of which we gained at the end of six miles. The road, which is not very steep or difficult, is reported to be much infested by thieves, particularly near its entrance upon the plain. Our guides drew out their pistols, and begged us to proceed without stopping to shoot ducks, which we saw at hand, as they feared that the report of our pieces might occasion an attack. The rumour of thieves had occa sioned much talk at the caravansera; and the apprehensions to which it gave rise had occasioned our departure to be delayed till day-light. The flat expanse of the valley of Dustarjoon had the appearance of a lake, being covered with water to the foot of the hills to the south ward, from the melting of the snow upon them. At the end of this march we crossed several small streams of snow-water, one previous to entering the plain, and others upon it, all running into the lake on our right. At about six hundred yards from the village of Dus tarjoon we crossed a very rapid stream, issuing from the fissures of the rocky mountain, now close at hand on our left. This mountain rises perpendicularly two hundred and fifty feet above the springs; and yet the stream, at only thirty yards’ distance from the rocks, is sufficient to turn a mill of the largest size. I understand, that on the top of these rocks there is a flat space, covered with gardens of fine fruit-trees, as grapes, almonds, figs, &amp;c. &amp;c. The valley of Dustar joon is about five miles long, and two wide; and is enclosed by hills of lime-stone, with steep rocky sides, in which are found imbedded many different kinds of petrified sea-shells. On the south and west sides the mountains are covered with snow, which sometimes remains throughout the year: the mountain-springs are numerous all round the valley. Mules, asses, and Yaboo horses are bred by the people at this place; the cows are of a breed similar to those of England, but smaller, and are kept out of doors; but each of them is covered with a cumlee; so also are the horses. All the houses are flat-roofed, and built of mud and straw, the h 252 KONEH ZUNYOON. walls and roofs being very thick and low. The valley is now be ginning to undergo cultivation; and doubtless, with proper care and attention, it might be rendered very productive. I here observed that the stones, resembling sarcophagi, on the tombs, were of the form already described, and actually now in use ; except that these are all solid, and not hollowed, as in the former instance. There being no caravansera at this place, we put up in the best house we could find; it happened to be the abode of a poor family to whom even a rupee appeared a great present. The mother and two young daughters were employed in making the upper parts for shoes, of thick cotton, worked like the texture of stocking, though done by a single needle. Shoes of this kind are in common use throughout this part of Persia, a circumstance which may account for the inha bitants being free from corns. At four o’clock we resumed our journey ; but before we had gone many yards we were called to halt for a strayed mule, which we did for nearly half an hour in the cold. Six miles of this march was over hills covered with bushes; we then descended into lower grounds. Parallel to the road, and about three miles distant on the right, were mountains covered with snow. Those on the left were more remote. A river, which we had observed coming from the westward, here continued close on our left for one mile, when we crossed it, running to the right, and keeping its course within half a mile of the road. We arrived at the caravansera of Koneh Zunyoon, the distance being about twelve miles. Close to this place we crossed a small but rapid stream from the left, which joins the larger river half a mile to the right. The little that seems to remain of the village of Koneh Zunyoon consists of only a few huts adjoining the caravansera, which is at pre sent going fast to decay. Very little forage is to be had here; there fore at this, the foraging season, caravans do not halt, but go on to the open plains, for the sake of better forage. This our muleteer had done, leaving us after separating our six mules with baggage; but we agieed to buy forage for them, for which we paid two rupees, thoughDESOLATE COUNTRY NEAR SHIRAUZ. 53 but for a few hours, as at four in the evening we left the caravansera, and moved six miles farther, to the open plain, where we found our muleteer with his cattle. He had promised to have a tent pitched for us; but he had only secured himself and his baggage, easily in venting, as usual, some falsehood or other, to account for his breach of promise: our people, therefore, clearing a space of ground from thorns, thistles, loose stones, and furze, as well as they could for the moment, laid our beds there, and placed our trunks so as to afford some shelter for our heads. We slept until half-past eleven, when we rose, remounted, and travelled on. I must here remark, that the mountains two or three miles distant on our right were covered with snow, the thermometer being about 48°; and to sleep and travel in that temperature was trying to our Indian constitutions. The road was stony, and led either over or round hills the whole way. For twenty miles there was not a hut, hovel, or habitation of any kind to be seen; the surface of this dreary country was thinly covered by bushes; yet we were approaching one of the finest cities in Persia. At length, having twice crossed a rapid stream running to the right, we passed a guard-hut, or chokeh, about four miles from Shirauz; and as the day broke, we saw before us a sterile waste, stony and dusty, bearing scarcely a blade of vegetation, which extended to ward this once famed city. About three quarters past six we entered the enclosure of a nobleman’s garden called Affyabad, and there breakfasted. A letter was brought to us by a servant of JafFer Ally Khaun, in which that well-known personage, politely excusing him self for not coming to meet us, invited us to his house; we therefore shortly afterward accompanied the servant. Our approach to the city was far from exciting any feelings of wonder; it appeared very little superior to most of our middling cities in India, which, like this, are surrounded by walls, with round towers, such as Bhooj, Cambay, Moongy Pytun, Ahmednugger Petta, &amp;c. There was a striking difference, however, in one particular; for the country surrounding them is enlivened by flourishing villages, the plains are loaded with grain and subdivided by hedges, the roads bear deep traces of the54 ARRIVAL AT SHIRAUZ. passage of carts and cattle, whereas Shirauz has only barren wastes within a march of it. There was, indeed, one solitary village observable, about four miles off, near the hills, one mile on the left of the road, but not a tree or enclosure was to be seen near it, and its buildings presented one low defined mark on the brown and arid expanse. In a valley hills leading to the city there are some very extensive enclosures or orchards with small villas built in them, belonging to the noblemen and gentry of the place. I understand that grapes, when in season, are so cheap, as to be worth only half their weight in grain. These gardens are mostly watered by running streams from the adjacent hills and snowy mountains: the enclosure walls are built of mud, and thatched at top; they are about ten feet high, so that persons walking within are screened from the observation of passers- by. The gateways are built of brick and mortar, and often orna mented. The scene now before me was totally different from what my imagination had anticipated. We generally find that the over flowing wealth of a city gives rise to activity and bustle without, to flourishing suburbs, and to a variety of pleasure-houses and rural residences on every eligible spot in the neighbourhood; but here the whole population of the surrounding country seemed to have been drawn and almost confined together by motives of mutual security to form a city. Such appeared to be the character of the place, under the aspect in which I first beheld it; other impressions will be re corded as they occur.CHAPTER V. SHIRAUZ. BAZAREH VAKEEL.

DECLINE OF SHIRAUZ. ARRANGEMENTS FOR EXPENDITURE ON THE JOURNEY. A MEHMANDAUR ASSIGNED US BY THE PRINCE. On the morning of the 28th of April, we rode out in a northerly direction, first examining and passing through the very extensive buildings of the Bazareh Vakeel. This is a street of 16 feet in breadth of horse road, with rows of shops on each side, having before them a space or seat 4 feet broad, for the exhibition of wares. There is an arched room of masonry, and other accommodations behind each shop, and the whole is covered by arched roofs, admitting light. At the spaces where the streets intersect each other there are fountains. Leading directly from this street are two principal caravanseras and other edifices for public convenience. Each shop-keeper has his name inscribed in Persian over his tenement, which is enclosed by lattice-work and shutters. The entire establishment forms one of the finest assemblages of Asiatic accommodation I ever saw, the whole built of fine brick masonry. The walls of Shirauz, as before noticed, are built of mud, or of brick with an exterior coat of mud; and although flanked with round towers at short distances, they are not surrounded by a ditch, and appear to Europeans of little consequence as a fortification. Within56 MECHANIC ARTS. the walls there is a smaller work, called the ark, which seems com posed of much better brick masonry and is very much ornamented. It has a formidable dry ditch, but no glacis. The palace seems situ ated either within or contiguous to it. The bridge across the ditch is made of common rafters with sticks laid over them. Adjoining the palace is the arsenal, for small arms, ammunition, &amp;c. and a prison for the higher criminals. The Prince’s stables, which are worth seeing, are also adjacent to the other offices of the palace; the buildings being formed into squares, which, leading one into another, have a grand appearance. At short distances in these squares there are stones having circular perforations, so as to serve as orifices for wells. The streets are in general narrow, and as the houses front inwards, and have no windows on the exterior, these avenues are ex tremely dull, and are liable to become very filthy. Such indeed are the accumulations of mud in them, that persons are continually em ployed in digging drains to admit a free passage of the water from them. The channels also from whence water for common use is procured, are often left open, thus rendering the streets dangerous. There are no wheeled carts or carriages in use here: men, women, and children travel on asses, mules, or horses, and sometimes in two cradles, or panniers, borne by a camel. Riding is so general that if a person keeps a horse, his groom requires a mule for his own con veyance, and for the carriage of the horse’s night-clothing of cum- lee, and numud or felt, which is requisite, as these animals are rarely put under shelter. Among the mechanic arts practised here, my admiration was most excited by that of pottery, the productions of which in Shirauz are of superior quality, being of the tint of Wedgewood’s yellow ware: the forms of the different articles are rather elegant, and always very appropriate to their uses. This place is also noted for the excel lence of its confectionery. Fiom all that I observed, however, I was led to conclude generally, that Shirauz exhibits all those symptoms of decay to which the greater part, if not the whole of Persia is hastening.TOMB OF SHAH MEER HCJMZA. 57 Its dismemberment and division must ensue, if a grand and be neficial change in the administration of government do not speedily take place. Already each petty mountain-chief talks freely of his own independence, and of the imbecillity of the government in bartering the high interests of the state for money and jewels. Treasures thus acquired render their possessors timid, suspicious and fretful. In this way they are urged to the commission of abuses, which are resented by the most horrid acts of anarchy, necessarily tending to general confusion. The Persians individually place much reliance on the superiority of their light cavalry ; and if their hosts were converted chiefly into that description of force, they must succeed in rendering nugatory any northern invasion. But the dissensions of the chiefs of the different tribes will no doubt prevent them from uniting cordially for defence. The art of enamelling on gold is much cultivated at Shirauz. Flowers, which are the subjects in which the artificers succeed best, are raised from the gold ground, with the most beautiful colours. Their designs for hookas, chillums, mouth-pieces, pipes, &amp;c. are very elegant. The inhabitants excel also in penmanship, engraving of seals, tomb-stones, &amp;c. In the course of our excursion we examined a very ancient building, with a beautiful blue cupola, covered with enamelled tiles of a bluish green tint, with which also the windows, walls, arches, &amp;c. were ornamented. The structure itself is of yellowish lime-stone, and the enclosure and out-offices are built of the same material. It is dedicated to a descendant of Mahomed, called Shah Meer Humza, and highly venerated as a saint. Its site is close on the right of the high road to Ispahan, near a stone bridge over a rivulet now almost dry, which bears his name. We thence proceeded to the tomb of Hafiz, which we found in a situation exposed to the weather, in front of a building in an enclosure of walls. Near it is the stump of an old cy press tree which was burnt about three years ago. It is said to be about 455 years old, having been planted by Hafiz himself, not long be-58 TOMB OF HAFIZ. fore the period of his death. There is a tank for the convenience of ablution, and beyond it a hall supported by four stone pillars, and painted in fresco, as also is the roof, which is now falling to ruin. There is a garden adjoining ; the other divisions of the building are cells for the residence of servants, who have in their keeping a copy of the poet’s works. This, to all believers, and to every visitor wishing to see it, is laid on his tomb and opened, and the contents of that chapter which happens to appear, are supposed to foretel the future fate of the person, for whom the ceremony is performed: these contents, however, are always susceptible of a favourable inter pretation from the attendant, and he construes them accordingly. Hafiz himself was a Sofi, and the mysterious method of writing prac tised by that sect can be easily made to convey an auspicious meaning. The tombstone is one large block of a semi-transparent substance of the nature of gypsum, called Tabriz marble, veined and coloured with green and red. It is about 6 feet long, 2f wide, and If high: the surface only is covered with verses from his works, headed by a passage from the Koran. Near this tomb are several others, of per sons who probably considered his sanctity efficacious as a passport for all who were interred around him. Among them is one of an Am bassador from the Porte. From this place we proceeded to visit the gardens laid out by Kerim Khaun, called Jehan Nboma from the painted circular building in the centre: its walls, arched roof, and the whole interior are covered with paintings of birds, flowers, and various fanciful de vices, pretty well executed. The lower part of the walls is lined, to the height of about three feet, with slabs of Tabriz marble. In some places these slabs also are ornamented with a running pattern of flowers in gold. The ensemble is rich, heavy, and gloomy, but not at all elegant, neat, or even clean. The centre avenues of all the gaidens have, like this, a shallow channel, from 4, to 8 or 10 feet wide, and 1 deep, for a current of water, and near the walls, which are narrow, there is often a line of cypress, chinaur or poplarGARDENS OF KERIM KHAUN. 59 An open flight of brick steps leads to an audience hall built over the entrance gate, which has also been wainscotted with Tabriz marble, and painted rather in a lighter and better taste; but the ceilings and walls are now much neglected, and falling to decay like all Kerim Khaun’s buildings, except his bazars which are rented to shop keepers. In the gardens we found all the fruit-trees in blossom, and some very small young fruit already set, as apples, pears, nectarines, apricots, and plumbs; those of the smaller kind of damsons are the most advanced. Cherries, although not so common as the other fruits, are just in blossom. The season at Shirauz is altogether about fifteen days later than at Kauzeroon. On the road through the pass of Alla Akbar, under the fort of the Khaun Moortuzaly, is to be seen the Huft Tun (Seven Bodies), an enclosure or garden containing the tombs of seven persons of sanctity; and here also are rooms for dervaishes to stop and reside in. In the hall, are the pictures of Hafiz and Saadi, both ill done, but of some antiquity. Hafiz is represented as a young man, but Saadi has the white beard and mustachios of advanced age. Copies of these are given. The Cheyl Tun (or forty dervaishes), another of these gardens which we visited, has only a few rooms for the accommodation of travellers and dervaishes. Here are perhaps forty tombs of these religious personages ; but the place is going rapidly to ruin. On a subsequent day we paid a visit to the tomb of Saadi, situated in the pass of Tungeh Akbar. This has a better house built over it by Kerim Khaun. The tomb-stone consists of one block, similar in shape to that of Hafiz, of a white lime-stone, hollowed out from the top, raised at the head and feet, and entirely covered with Arabic inscriptions, some from the Koran, and others from the works of the poet. The tomb is said to be four hundred years old, but the building is much more recent. Here is a well so constructed as to afford a passage for persons to descend and bathe in it, having cells also in the sides for their accommodation. On some particular days it is believed to be very healthful for persons to immerge in these waters. i 260 PAINTINGS. On an eminence in the vicinity are the ruins of an ancient fort called Cha Bundar. It is said, that on the summit of one of the remaining towers there is a well which descends to an immense depth in the hill. I passed the next day at the garden of our host, Jaffer Ally Khaun ; and at six in the evening, on our return, we went to the Tukhteh Kudgera, a palace of the reigning family. This, like the other palaces here, is falling to ruin. Its site is on a rocky height at the foot of the mountains, and is said to command one of the best views of the city. The palace contains a good dvwan khoneh, or hall of audience, the rooms to the right and left of which are painted with birds and some extremely ill-drawn landscapes, representing what is called the story of the Dervaish and Thersa’s daughter. In one compartment this sanctified personage, who is called Shaik Sun Aun, a Sofi, sees Thersa’s daughter, an Armenian Greek Christian girl, of whom he becomes desperately enamoured. In the next she is seen refusing to marry him unless he will change his religion ; and many old men are dissuading him from doing so. In the third she directs him to drive hogs to feed, to which he consents, undertaking this occupation for one year. Another compartment shows him thus employed, and the damsel bathing at a distance. The story is not completed in the pictures, but it terminates in his disappointment after all; and two spaces are filled up with bad representations of the King and Queen of Portugal, drawn after the conception which the Persians have formed of their form and costume. These paintings in blue and white, with some pieces representing the shooting and spearing of lions, tygers, deer, &amp;c. fill up the niches : the walls are covered with paintings of trees, flowers, and birds, which tend to give the room a gloomy appearance. The Persian sitting-rooms are all on the same plan, having walls on three sides, and the whole of the fourth consisting of windows of painted glass, in exceedingly small panes, so disposed as to represent different figures. The lower divisions slide up and run outside the upper fillagree work, which is also filled up with glass of differentPERSIAN SITTING-ROOMS. 61 colours. • The floor, which is generally of clay, is first covered with mats, then with a carpet, on which are small numuds, or felts, four feet in width, extending along two sides of the room ; the upper part is covered with a larger numud, on which the owner of the house receives his company. In some cases the owner’s place is not on the end facing the door, but on one of the sides, and then it is in a recess raised about two inches higher than the larger part of the room, which is bordered by numuds on all sides, except that containing the door. On these the lower class of people and attendants sit; their masters, the visitors, sitting with the owner of the house on the raised place, on each hand of which are closets with shelves for keeping any thing which is required to be at hand. Sometimes this saloon is situated between two gardens, in the centre of which are tanks or shallow channels of water. In this case there are windows opening from the raised place, as in the front before mentioned. The colours with which the glasses are variegated are principally yellow, crimson, blue, and emerald-green. There are sometimes two gradations of yellow glass, the one inclining to orange. Having made some enquiries concerning the toilet and attire of the Persian women of former times and of the present, I was taken to visit one of the most ancient of the resident families, that of Jauny Khaun, a descendant of the celebrated Jenghis Khan the Tartar. His countenance exhibited strong traces of his origin. He is now chief of all the Illyaut tribes, and his family residence is near Yezde- khaust. At Shirauz he lives in a palace formerly belonging to Kerim Khaun, in one of the rooms of which are a great number of paintings of the ladies of that chieftain’s time; among others is a portrait of Shauh Noobat, his favourite mistress : the features are certainly fine, but the perspective of the whole is ill executed. A sketch in pencil was taken of the dress. In Mr. Scott Waring’s account of Shirauz a copy of this lady’s picture is given. The old gentleman and his three sons, with whom we sat some time, were very affable, and made many enquiries respecting our62 SEAL ENGRAVING. service, pay, amusements, &amp;c. The Khaun is very powerful and affluent: he can bring, within a month, ten thousand cavalry into the field; and should he survive the reigning monarch, his influence in setting up another may be considerable: he is entirely in the confidence of the Prince of Shirauz, and, together with his family, enjoys the universal respect of all classes. They are distinguished for their hospitality to strangers, of which I believe an English officer of the Madras establishment can speak personally, as I under stand he resided with this family some time. During our stay at Shirauz our time was much consumed by visitors who sat for a tedious length of time, and whom there appeared no practicable expedient of getting rid of, without infringing the rules of politeness. This is one of the most grievous annoyances to which a traveller in this country is exposed. As there are good seal-engravers at Shirauz I procured two stones to be cut, the inscriptions containing together about thirty letters. The stones were topazes, and the charge for cutting was at the rate of a rupee for three letters, about ten-pence a letter; but as the artist executed and ornamented them to our satisfaction, and finished his work in three days, I paid him one tomaun (a pound sterling) for each seal. Some specimens of enamelling on gold in flowers which were shown me, appeared superior to any thing of the kind I had ever seen. The gold ground was left uncovered, and the enamelled flowers were raised very much above its surface. On every hand there are signs of the rapid decline of this city. If any building appeared to demand attention, I generally found on enquiry that it either originated with Kerim Khaun, or had been rebuilt by him; but all his works are purposely suffered to fall into decay; and this would have been the fate of his noble bazar had it not been for the great revenue arising from the rent of its shops and caravanseras. The character of the Prince Governor of Shirauz, who is now twenty-five years of age, is already formed, but not in a mould to ensure its prosperity; and his people, whose rapacity is barbarous and unfeeling, destroy all confidence in government.PERSIAN DESPOTISM. 63 About midway up the mountains, behind the palace of Tukhteh Kudgera, is a small dome built of masonry, over the tomb of a der- vaish named Baba Kooee, who was much revered in his life-time, and whose memory is held in high respect. He lived and died in this place, in a cave which had a very small spring of good water running through it. Three or four small cells have since been added. Before I quit Shirauz I may be allowed to relate two anecdotes of recent date. Hajee Ibrahim, prime minister and' supporter of Aga Mahomed Khaun (in fact he raised him from the rank of Khood Khoda to the throne), and premier also of the present sovereign, Futteh Ally Shah, had a son named Meerza Mahomed Khaun, who about nineteen years ago began, at his own expense, to repair and rebuild the tomb of a saint, Shah Cheraukh, in this city. His pre sent Majesty, wishing to rid the country of Hajee Ibrahim, and at the same time to prevent the insurrection of any one of his family, at one blow carried his project into execution in the following manner. He first caused the Hajee Ibrahim’s tongue to be cut out, and then his eyes; he then ordered his two sons, who were governors of districts, one at Hamadan, and the other the person already men tioned, to be put to death on the same day; in order that previously to putting his minister to death, he might be certain that all his family were destroyed ; and he only waited the intelligence of their death, that he might give Hajee Ibrahim the coup de grace. These arrangements, from the commencement of Hajee Ibrahim’s confinement, took up nearly one month in their completion; when, finding that no resistance was to be apprehended, he ordered his blinded minister to be hanged. These acts need no comment. Hoossein Ally Meerza, the present Prince of Shirauz, was only seven years of age, and of course acted under the direction of his minister Cherauk Ally Khaun. He invited Meerza Mahomed Khaun to dine with him: more than usual attention was paid to the unsus pecting guest, who was engaged to play with the Prince at back gammon. In the course of their diversion the Prince took occasion to withdraw to another apartment, when his people seized Meerza64 PERSIAN DESPOTISM. Mahomed Khaun and put him to death. All his wealth was of course seized. The saint’s tomb, which he had begun to re-build, remains unfinished to this day; all the rich people fearing to under take its completion, lest they should share his fate. There is no doubt that Hajee Ibrahim was himself a very bad man, and merited the calamity which befel him : it is also to be presumed that Meerza Mahomed Khaun was impelled to the pious work of re-building the dome and tomb of Shah Cheraukh merely by the hope of expiating his multitude of former sins; but what a horrible precedent must the seizure of him have been to Hoossein Ally Meerza, Prince of Shirauz, at that time only seven years of age! Ought we to be at all surprised, if with the remembrance of this lesson of atrocity before him, he should continue acts of the same character? An all-ruling Providence, indeed, seldom suffers such enormities to be committed without inflicting ample retribution; but the moral restraint arising from this consideration is not always powerful enough to control the passions of men invested with despotic sway. As another instance of the insecurity of property in this country, it is mentioned that this Prince bought two looking-glasses for about ten pounds, which he ordered to be hung up in a new residence, which is now nearly finished, about three quarters of a mile from the town, in the neighbourhood of Hafiz’s tomb. He one day took the commander of the forces to see the place and its gardens, when the latter casting his eyes on the looking-glasses, and recollecting the insecure state of the country, strongly remonstrated with the Prince on the great folly and impropriety of placing such valuables in a house so far remote from the fort, and so completely out of his power to protect from robbers. He recommended that they should be brought within the walls of the city residence, which is a fortifi cation of itself, being an inclosure of high brick walls flanked by four high towers, and having a dry ditch twenty feet deep round it. In this place, which is called the Ark, the guards are quartered, and here, of course, the two looking-glasses might be shielded from theSHIRAUZ. 65 cupidity of plunderers. The town walls, it is to be obseived, are greatly neglected, and have many breaches in them; nor is there any ditch but what a horseman may easily ride up and down. The better condition of the second inclosure or ark, shews that the government is intent solely on its own security and that of the individual property of the Prince, paying no regard to the safety of the public. In stances equally demonstrative of this miserable policy, and of the wretched state of the administration, were daily related to me with out any surmise on the part of those who mentioned them, that I could thence deduce any unfavourable conclusions as to their political condition. The merchants of Shirauz are as thoroughly possessed with the spirit of money-getting as most others, and sometimes evince it in a ludicrous manner. A man of considerable property, who brought diamonds and other precious stones to a large amount for sale, dis posed of two feroozas to me for thirty-two rupees; as one of the gold tomauns I paid him was deficient in weight by half a rupee, he proposed that I should give him one rupee, and that he should give me half a rupee, to adjust the difference; 1 did so, and he hurried off with it, saying he should keep the half rupee as a present for himself. The horses of Shirauz are of an excellent breed, and are to be had at about half the price of those at Bombay. A good hack for tra velling, easy, fast, and sure in his paces, of four to eight years old, may be obtained at from one hundred and sixty to two hundred rupees. A horse-keeper cleans and attends to three horses on the road and four at home. The daily expense of two horses and two mules in grain and grass, exclusive of servants, is two rupees. The charge for shoeing is one rupee. With a great deal of difficulty we agreed with a muleteer for seven mules with two drivers, at the rate of one rupee each mule per day, engaging them for two months in travelling hence to the north boundary of Persia, on the side of Russia. In addition to this we voluntarily proposed a donation of fifty rupees in case of the66 DEPARTURE FROM SHIRAUZ, satisfactory fulfilment of his part of the engagement, which was to march and halt when and where we pleased, and to act as our servant with his mules. The agreement was committed to writing, and executed before the Cauzee, duly attested, with the necessary securities, &amp;c. These formalities are indispensable precautions in all contracts with muleteers. There exists a regulation to prevent the inhabitants, and females in particular, from quitting the town by night, in conformity to which the gates are shut at dark; we were therefore obliged to go out some short distance to sleep, in order to commence our journey by moonlight. We loaded our mules in the evening, and went to take our rest at the Huft Tun, as it was on the road. The Dervaishes did not fail to put us in mind of paying for our lodging, which we did on our departure from the garden. There is no absolute neces sity for complying with this requisition, but gentlemen are expected to do so. It may be proper here to advert to our arrangements for expendi ture on the journey. On our arrival at Shirauz, we had presented for acceptance the bills furnished us by Mr. Bruce, and Koja Arre- toon, an Armenian merchant of Bushire, and we had received from Koja Karapeet, an Armenian merchant of Shirauz, on whom they were drawn, not only as much money as we required for present use, but every attention to our wishes : it was through his mediation that we settled for the hire ol mules and the purchase of horses. After deducting the sums expended by us in this city, as stated in the account of expenses annexed to this narrative, we took bills for the remainder of our funds on Coja Goolistoon of Ispahan. We determined on proceeding to that city by the western road nearest the mountains. The interjacent country in that direction is known to be little inhabited, and is principally occupied by the wan dering tribes of Illy ants on account of its abundance of forage. As a necessary precaution for this route, we requested Aga Meer, a gentleman of note, to procure for us from the Prince a Mehman- daur, (an officer whose title, in the literal acceptation of the word,ACCOMPANIED BY A MEHMANDAUR* 67 means master of ceremonies,) with orders from him to secure us shelter in the villages, guides, or any other assistance which we might require; the Prince very readily acquiesced, and sent us a horseman of his own body-guard, who had been accustomed to travel the road which we were about to take. To prevent any misunderstanding or exorbitant demand being made by the Mehmandaur, it is a good precaution to ask him before he sets out, what sum he expects to receive for his trouble, on his arrival at the place to which he has received orders to accompany you; for it is not unlikely that he will increase his expectations with his knowledge of your pecuniary circumstances, which he will judge of by your liberality on the road, and the superior character your own servants will naturally give of you./ 68 CHAPTER VI.

VALLEY OF MEERDUSHT.— HABITS AND EM PLOYMENTS OF THE ILLYAUTS. PERSIAN SHEEP. May 4th. We left the Huft Tun at three in the morning by moonlight, and arrived by eight at Zergoon, distant fourteen miles and a half. The first part of this road leads through the Tungeh Allah Akbar, and is very rugged and stony, winding continually among hills and mountains. At seven miles, there is a ruined caiavansera, now under repair, having a good tank of water and a small mnning stream near it in the valley where it is situated. We observed several encampments of Illyauts in groups of five or six tents each; their flocks were seen ranging over the hills, and con sisted mostly of goats and sheep together ; they had also camels, and some horses and asses. Their black tents were not pitched close together, but along the bottom of the mountains at the com mencement of the ascent, so as to be sheltered from winds, and to secure at the same time an equal distribution of the pasturage of the whole valley. This morning we met several parties of Illyauts changing their ground. The old men, the women, and baggage, were removed on horses, asses, and bullocks; the young men, armed, accom panied them; and their flocks were to be driven to the new ground, m the cour se of the day, by the herdsmen. The road, for the last seven miles and a half, was rather better, an more eve. ithin three quarters of a mile of Zergoon, weZERGOON. 69 crossed a stream of fine water, and entered upon a cultivated tract bearing wheat, barley, and beans, all in a much less forward state than at Kauzeroon. Zergoon is surrounded by a mud wall with towers, and is situated so close to a high rocky mountain, that it is completely overlooked. We halted at the Maihmaun Khoneh, a place for the reception and entertainment of government officers, where we met with very good accommodation. The mountainous tract which we had passed, consisting chiefly of limestone rock, was extremely bare of bushes and shrubs. There was very little grass obseivable except in the vallies, and even there the herbage was very scanty. Theie are mountains visible from this town, at seventy or eighty miles’ distance, covered with snow. The only remarkable piece of antiquity which I saw here was a building erected over the tombs of two Syuds, by order of Shah Abbas the great. We found many Jewish families settled here, by some of whom we were offered Shirauz wine, which is forbidden in that city, at fifteen-pence a bottle. * It is to be had in great abundance. May 5th.—The road we had to travel being represented very deep and muddy, we left Zergoon at day-light, and on passing round the north end of the mountain an extensive plain opened on our view, partly teeming with corn, and in some places marshy and covered with water. Here the road branched into two, one continuing along the foot of the hill to Bund Emir, about twelve miles distant, and the other leading through the middle of the plain. After proceeding about a mile we came to swampy ground, in crossing which without a guide there was some difficulty, as it was two hundred yaids in breadth : we traversed it, however, with but little inconvenience from the mud. The road then led along the plain for six miles, at the end of which we went round the south point of a rocky hill, and came to the rapid and deep river of Bund Emir, about sixty yaids wide. There is a stone bridge of three arches over it, so dilapidated that there is some danger in going over it; we therefore dismounted and advanced with great caution, the slope being steep and slip70 RUINS OF PERSEPOLIS. pery, and a great part of the parapet wall and of the causeway having fallen. It was altogether a very disagreeable place to pass over. This bridge is on the confines of the large plain of Meerdusht, extending north and south about forty miles, and being about ten miles broad. The road from hence was a little to the southward of east. Proceeding about eight miles we arrived at the village of Kunara, the lattei pait of the road was good and level j we crossed two muddy streams flowing to the right, being brought from the hills and through the valley, for the purpose of irrigation. The village of Kunara is small, but it is the nearest station to the ruins of Per- sepolis, which lie to the eastward at the distance of about a mile and a quarter, at the foot of the eastern range of mountains by which the valley is bounded. As there is no caravansera, we should not have obtained accom modation without the aid of the Prince’s Mehmandaur, who went forward with the hookum, or written order, and cleared a house of its inhabitants for our reception. At twelve, in order to lose no time, we mounted our horses and rode to the ruins of the palace of Persepolis, which we had been atten tively examining for some time with spy-glasses. The road thither led through a level cultivated tract, interrupted only by two channels of irrigation running to the right. These ruins, even on a distant ap proach, have a very grand appearance; they stand on a platform of immense hewn stones, which is about 1500 feet long, and 50 in height, thus presenting a bold elevation over the plains of Meerdusht, on the verge of which they are situated. Above this platform are’ seen the pillars and principal ruins. The pillars appear li&lt;d,t- coloured like marble, but the stone of which they are constructed is dark within, and they are blanched by exposure to the weather. e principal ascent from the plain is by a double flight of steps, 24 feet wide, right and left, not situated in the middle of the platform, but rather on the northern side of it. The perpendicular depth of eac i step is not more than 41 inches, and the surface at least 15 broad, so that horses may go up and down with ease. The first or lowerRUINS OF PERSEPOLIS. 71 flights consist of 59 steps, and the upper, or return-flights, of 59. The steps are of black cut stone, and, what is astonishing, they are very little worn. On the plane or surface of the platform, a little to the right or north, stand four square masses of masonry, with pillars between them, each mass having the figure of an animal carved on it in alto relievo, about 12 feet in height. Two of these figures re semble unicorns, and the other two represent beasts like lions covered with scales. Over each, in square tablets or pannels are inscriptions in Persepolitan, or arrow-headed characters, which not being within reach are in good preservation. The position of these four quadran gular masses of stone leads us to conclude, that they were the sup ports of two gates, for within them there are two pillars now standing, and the corresponding space opposite seems to require two similar ones: perhaps the whole may have formerly supported a roof of stone so as to constitute a portico. Near them on the right, or turning from east to south, there is a stone cistern, intended no doubt for visitants to perform their ablutions there, preparatory to ascending the stairs leading to the highest part of the platform. The sloping edges of these stairs, and the sides from which they project are covered with figures in alto relievo, representing a procession of persons with musical instru ments, arms, and offerings. The figures on the very lowest side of the steps appeared to me the most extraordinary: one of them repre sented a man leading a goat, the next a car on wheels, each wheel twelve inches in diameter; the car and the animal attached, exceeded the height of the wheel by 22 inches: the upper stones were in an un finished state, or rather the sculptured parts had been removed, so that I could not satisfactorily decypher the rest of the design; but the driver, who was on foot, had wings. It was matter of sur prise to find that the wheels were of the form now in use, each having twelve spokes, a nave, and fellies ; the outer tire being covered with round-headed nails. These figures have been so well delineated by former travellers that I thought it unnecessary to copy them. Of the pillars on the higher part of the platform there are only about thir teen remaining erect, the four front ones being of a different con-72 RUINS OF PERSEPOLIS. struction from the others, and rather of larger dimensions. They appear to have been originally thirty-six in number, disposed in the form of a square of 6 in each row, or together 36, which with the 4 of rather larger dimensions in the front, but near them, amount to 40, from which number these ruins have obtained the name of Cheyl Minar, or Forty Pillars. Fragments of them lie scattered over the platform, some covered, and others partly exposed. There is a con siderable accumulation of earth which prevents the sculpture from being well seen. Beyond the pillars are the remains of apartments in a south and an easterly direction. Those to the southward are raised above the level of the pillared platform, eight feet, and have been adorned with sculpture along their basements. But of these structures there remain only the stone cases of the doors, and those of niches between them; these are all blocked up towards the exterior. Most of the inner surfaces of the sides of the doors are carved; on some, the principal ones, is the figure of a king standing, with at tendants holding over him an umbrella, and a chouri, or implement of state, consisting of a large bunch of long hair fixed in a gold or silver handle for the purpose of driving away the flies. The borders of his garment, as well as the edges of the niches, which in all proba bility were originally formed to contain idols, are all inscribed with Persepolitan letters or numbers to correspond with letters in the arrow-headed character, serving both as ornaments and as records. On the interior walls of one of the buildings are several tablets, beaiing similai characters in pannels. Beyond these rooms, still farther south, is an open space, on three sides of which there were formerly buildings, the vacant side being to the westward. This space is now filled up to the height of more than eight feet with earth and stone, fragments of pottery, and others consisting of a mixture °f lime and pebble. The basement of the three sides is covered with figures in alto-relievo, of which only the heads and shoulders are now visible. The area thus filled up is evidently lower than the ground-line of the buildings before mentioned ; and the outer terre- plain of the structure which forms the south side of this area, is stillRUINS OF PERSEPOLIS. 73 lower; hence the figures on the basement of that south face are of larger proportions ; they are however covered up as high as the breast with earth and debris. On each side-stone of some of the door-cases there is the figure of a man in the act of stabbing in the belly an unicorn, which he holds by the bent horn with his left hand. Others represent a man stabbing a lion, in the erect posture of the unicorn ; the man holding the fore lock of the animal’s mane. After examining this range, I went to those rooms situated to the eastward of the pillars, which I believe to have been the principal place of residence, or rather of worship; for that the latter was the main purpose of the whole edifice seems manifest from evidences which will hereafter be stated. In the largest room are found four large doors; those to the north and south have been decorated by figures of unicorns with wings, and of men of larger dimensions ; the door-cases to the east and west are covered with a great number of smaller figures in rows one above another, and the top of which is a regal figure seated on a chair, with the umbrella and choury behind him, and figures in a kneeling posture in front of his chair. Above is the Persepolitan emblem, consisting of a winged bust with a ring. The figures below are similar to those in the other processions, having arms, musical instruments, victims of sacrifice, as goats, bulls, &amp;c. The wall of the eastern side appears to have been carried out beyond the building itself to the northward and southward; and on its terminations at each end are figures of the thickness of the wall itself, representing lions covered with coats of mail, similar to those already mentioned on the gateways near the principal stair-case. The stone of which all these ruins consist is a blackish limestone, the finest pieces being the blackest. It fractures easily, and yields well to the chisel. It has been already observed that the parts exposed to the weather assume a white appearance. About a hundred and fifty yards to the eastward of the last-men tioned ruined building, there is a steep ascent about eighty feet in height, up the acclivity of the rocky mountain : it leads to a vault or74 RUINS OF PERSEPOLIS. burial-place, the door of which is covered up to the very top, at least eight feet high, with earth and fragments of pottery, stone, &amp;c. We therefore could not examine the interior of this place. An idea may be formed of its site by imagining a section to be cut out of the hill to the depth of twenty yards, so as to form an horizontal terrace bounded by a precipice. The door of the vault is situated at the bottom of the precipice, so as to have opened on the terrace, but it is now covered up by the stratum of earth and rubbish before- mentioned. The sculpture on all vaults of this description is alike in design: at the top, in relief, is the Persepolitan emblem winged; to the right of it a round figure representing the sun, beneath which is a fire-altar, and in front the figure of a king erect, with hands joined and extended towards the altar. The figure in this particular instance has a bow in his hand, which appears to rest on the ground. This is supported by a projecting cornice and mouldings, the corners of which have unicorns’ heads; below there is a row of figures of lions or men, and under that is the door, of the form peculiar to Persepolis, and not unlike those of Egyptian ruins. At the distance of three hundred yards from this vault, and to the southward, is another, cut out in a similar way from the face of the hill. It has similar sculptures and figures. The stone having been here broken into, we entered the vault, although the earth, as in the former instance, covered three-fourths of the door-way. We found the interior to consist of three excavations of an arched form, cut out of the solid rock, each being about nine feet square and nine high, between masses of similar dimensions, and a gallery in front of them forty-two feet long and nine feet broad. If a compa rison so familiar might be used, we might say that the plan of the place bears some resemblance to that of a stable. No doubt the vaults would be found much higher if the earth and rubbish were cleared away. All the sculptures are in relief, a few inches from the surface of the stone; they are cut clean, and though not of the exquisite proportions of the Greek and Roman schools, are well executedRUINS OF PERSEPOLIS. 75 throughout. The folds of the drapery are regular and straight. The grain of the stone is not only soft and free, but of a nature to be easily susceptible of fine carving, and capable of retaining it fresh and sharp; though it may be fractured by a slight blow with a hammer. I do not think that the thirty-six pillars, already mentioned, were ever covered in, except by awnings on days of ceremony. It is pro bable that the walls of the other buildings were finished on the in terior by a double casing of flat stones of smaller dimensions, the intermediate space of about six feet being filled up with earth well beaten down. These structures were perhaps roofed, if not with stone, with the materials used for the covering of houses in Persia in the present day; these are sticks, over which are laid reeds, and upon them a flat terrace of clay or moistened earth, beaten and rolled down to render it compact and water-proof. There are so few fragments of stone to be seen in any direction, that it is difficult to believe that the whole structure, when perfect, had been completed with stone ; on the contrary, the heaps of earth and rubbish in and near the buildings are so considerable, as to warrant a belief that they may have been finished with earth in the manner above-mentioned. To illustrate this description, I took two sketches, one from a height on the south-east quarter of the ruins, comprehending a general view of them ; the other exhibiting a nearer view of two of the pillars, and of the front of the ruins in their vicinity, and to the southward of them. The stone used in the construction of these edifices appears to have been taken from the rocky mountain behind them ; the surface of the rock has the same light colour, yet doubt less, in cutting into it, particularly low down in the quarry, it would be found much darker and of similar quality. It may be added, that on the right of the road toward Nuckshee Rustom, and near some sculptures hereafter to be noticed, I observed a rough unfinished part of a pillar, having centres left on it like those of one which I observed among the ruins of Persepolis, from whence the place m l 276 RUINS OF PERSEPOLIS. question was only one mile distant. I must not omit to observe, that the large single stones that form the sides of the doors are all hollowed inside, so as to lighten them for erection. All the pillars are composed of several pieces; the shaft generally of three, the base of one, and the entablature of three. They are all fluted with small flutes from the base to the capital; and the entablatures also have been elaborately carved and ornamented. Through some convulsion in the course of ages several of the pillars have been shaken or twisted, so that the upper and under blocks do not exactly correspond in the fluting. Some of them have large slabs shivered from them, as if by lightning. One of the four front pillars has the upper stone of the shaft, with the incumbent capital, so shaken and distorted that it is out of its centre, and projects so much as one-fifth of its diameter over the remainder of the shaft below it. We found a portion of a fluted shaft lying quite exposed, which showed the manner in which the several parts of the pillars are united and held together. A piece of stone about one-sixth of the diameter is left projecting from the centre at one end, and at the other there is a socket of correspondent dimensions. These are adapted respectively to a similar projection and socket in the parts connecting with them. These ruins are generally believed to be those of a palace founded by Jemsheed, and reported to have been set on fire by Alexander the Great while intoxicated, at the instigation of Thais, his favourite mistress. The Persians denominate them Tukhteh Jemsheed “ the throne of Jemsheed.” If, however, an opinion may be formed of their original and perfect state from what is now visible, I should pionounce theii destination to have been not a royal residence or palace, but a sort of national temple for the celebration of important public ceremonies, and for divine worship. The following reasons among others seem to justify this conclusion: 1. The plan of the structure extends north and south, thus fronting due west, and open to that side only, as is observable in all places of national worship. 2. The buildings, far from possessing the local advantages that areCONJECTURES ON THE STRUCTURES. 77 ever studied in the erection of a palace, are shut out in a great measure from air, the site being within the mountain from north by east to south. 3. There is only one grand wide double stair-case, and this does not lead directly up to the central or principal build ings. The steps also of these stairs, as we have before observed, do not bear the marks of having been much frequented. 4. The position of the stone basin of water is near the top of the grand and only stair-case, and that spot seems to have been chosen for it in consideration of the ablutions required before entering a consecrated place. 5. There are the burial-places of two kings; one of them immediately behind and above the central hall of pillars, and looking into it. 6. There are no ruins whatever of smaller buildings in the vicinity, nor is it known that there are any in the adjacent country. In addition to these considerations are to be taken into account the situation, fronting the extensive and level plains of Meer Dusht, the great length of the pile, fifteen hundred feet, and its elevation, fifty feet. On the supposition that it was appropriated to the occa sional celebration of some great national solemnity, we may regard the rather advanced position of the four principal columns in front of the thirty-six others, as affording an appropriate station where the king or the high priest might officiate, so as to be within view of a great concourse of people, perhaps the armies of Persia, and a large proportion of its inhabitants. It has been observed by travellers that some of the sculptures already noticed in these ruins represent the processions instituted by Jemsheed, perhaps for celebrating the Nouroos, or commencement of the solar year, when the sun enters Aries, which is still the greatest festival in Persia. May not then the whole edifice have been destined for the scene of some analogous rites, some devotion to the rising sun, the Persian emblem, which if performed on the first appearance of that luminary above the moun tain, must have had an imposing and really a sublime effect, to depict which, as beheld by an observer on the plain, would be an undertaking highly worthy of the most eminent talents in design?SCULPTURES CALLED NUCKSHEE RUSTOM. May 6th.—We left Kunara at dawn, and proceeded to view the sculptures called Nuckshee Rustom, directing our course to the north end of the hill behind Persepolis. Our attention was attracted to some very ancient specimens on this the south side of the valley, and on the corner of the hill opposite the place which contains the sculp tures above-mentioned. The first tablet represents a king on horseback, having a globe on his head. The figure is about twelve feet high ; the hair appears curled all over; behind his horse, which is nine feet high, there are four men, one lower than the other, to the left; the horseman has streamers from his neck and shoulders, and also from his feet, and his dress is such as to exhibit an appearance of long hair. In front of the horse’s chest is an inscription of four lines in Sassanian characters, terminated apparently with a signature. On the breast of the horse is another inscription, and beneath it one in Greek, which is partly legible. Opposite this is a tablet representing two kings, one of whom holds a ring, and the other some streamers of drapery depending from it. Their dresses are the same as those in the preceding tablets, and the horses also, which are about seven feet high. In the centre there are the figures, very much defaced, of two men on foot; the one on the left has a horn and ball on his head, the other a crown; they hold a ring with streamers of drapery depending from it; he on the left holds the ring in his right hand, his left being raised to his mouth. The other carries a sword in his left hand. Behind the former are two men with straight swords depending from their waists ; one holds in his right hand something like a choury over the ball. The other king has two men behind him with their faces turned the contrary way; the one nearest to him holds a long staff, at the end of which is a sort of pallet; the other has his fingers raised towards his face. There are two small figures in the middle, below those of the kings, and reaching only a little above their knees. The principal figures are about twelve feet high. On arc Eacl toprot llei LA JWOli AioNUCKSHEE RUSTOM. 79 On a rock adjoining, on the left, is the bust of a single figure, all below being effaced; this apparently ought to belong to the centre compartment. Each tablet has a projection above it of two or three feet, of stone, to protect the sculptures from rain or accidental injury. After examining these antiquities we proceeded across a cultivated valley, intersected by several deep and narrow streams for irrigation, which obliged us to make a detour of at least a mile to the eastward, to a ruined village. There we were able to cross them, and turning again to the northwest, went to the tombs or vaults of the kings. The objects which successively attracted our notice, advancing from the eastward, were as follows: 1. A burial-place cut out of the perpendicular rock, at a con siderable elevation, and similar to those of Persepolis already de scribed. 2. Another vault similar to the former, except that the front was covered with Sassanian inscriptions on the right and left of the door ; and beneath was a very much defaced sculpture of two horse men fighting. 3. A king on horseback, the face turned to the westward; the hair curled like a wig, as in the former instance; bearing a crown with a globe on it; beads on the neck. Before the figure of the king are those of two men, one kneeling, and another extending to him his hand over the horse’s head. On the breast of the horse and in front of him are Sassanian inscriptions, part of which are very perfect. 4. An elevated burial-place similar to Nos. 1 and 2, but the door of this was only open about twenty-eight inches from the bottom. 5. Another tomb above, and below it a small sculpture of two combatants on horseback. The left horseman’s spear passes through the neck of his antagonist, who is thrown much back in his seat, his horse being seated on his haunches, and his spear being raised in the air. The first horse is at full stretch, and appears to be over throwing the other.80 CULTABAD. 6. An erect central figure of a man, with three on each side of him. He appears to have a horn growing on his head, with which and his forehead he supports an oval ball. This piece is carved in a projection from the rock, as if to represent a pulpit or balcony. 7. Two figures on horseback, apparently pulling at a ring. That on the right has a crown ; he on the left holds an horn and ball or egg, and is attended by a man standing with a choury behind. On the horse’s breast of this figure are nine lines in the Sassanian character. The right hand king holds a baton upright, but there is no inscription on his horse. These vaults and sculptures are cut out of the face of a rocky hill, nearly ninety feet high, on the top of which is a small round pillar of stone. Rising immediately behind is a very high mountain, called Jemsheed’s. We now proceeded to join our people, who had gone direct to the village of Cultabad, about eight miles north of Kunara, on the west side of a mountain formerly fortified, called Istakar. The whole valley of Meerdasht was occupied by small encampments of Illyauts; it is fortunate that these wanderers inhabit it, for without them it would soon be a desert. They pitch their tents, as before observed, near the foot of a mountain in small groups, at some distance from each other, so as to afford their flocks the whole range of the valley. They generally keep near running streams, and are never seen close on the road side. Whenever the forage becomes scanty, they remove to another valley after day-break. They load asses and bullocks with mussocks of milk, sour milk, butter-milk and cheese, butter, fresh and boiled. These articles, as also coarse woollen and hair cloth, and fine carpets, are sent to the nearest village or town for sale. In hours of leisure the women, who often assist in tending the flocks, make carpets of their wool, and coarse cloth of the same material. The carpets, which are made of different sizes for various purposes, are much esteemed, both for the brightness and perma nency of their colours and for their durability ; even in Persia they bear a very high price. Each family also manufactures its ownILLYAUTS. 81 clothing. They never live in villages except in the winter, when they approach the warm flat country and plain. In autumn they retire to the Surhud, or cold region of the mountains, which in some places remain covered with snow throughout the year. These par ticulars were written at Oojan, a deserted village on the verge of the Surhud, where at this season, (the beginning of May) the north-east sides of the mountains were covered with snow, and their streams were swoln with its melted waters. The black tent, which is the constant habitation of the Illyaut, appears low and rather flat, its sides being about five feet high ; it is open on that side which is least exposed during the day. The Illyauts sell sheep, goats, kids, and cows, also asses, horses, and camels. Some of them have mules which they use for burden, and sell when opportunity offers. The price of a cow is estimated by the weight of milk she yields, about one tomaun being given for every maund (seven pounds a half) of milk; a sheep or goat sells for four rupees; a kid for two; a full-grown camel sells for fifteen tomauns or pounds sterling. There are two breeds of camels in Persia, that of the Gurmehseer, or hot low country bordering on the Persian Gulf, and the other from the Surhud. The former is considered much inferior, and does not sell for more than two-thirds of the price of the latter. The sheep have very large tails, almost wholly consisting of fat, which is used for burning in lamps, and also as a substitute for butter in cooking. In this case it is cut into small pieces and mixed with the meat, either to be boiled or stewed. The mutton and lamb are very fine and high-flavoured; the wool, although not of the finest, is of very good texture. The Illyauts have with them horses of a small breed, which are kept for their principal people to ride on; the rest, both men and boys, ride on asses, carrying with them a stick with a knob at the end, to urge the beast forward, and to drive the flocks before them. They have some of them arms, which they use occasionally for offence as well as defence, that is, to plunder others when they find themselves the stronger party. Their women, who, as we have stated, often tend their flocks, are robust M82 ILLYAUTS. and of coarse features. Their dress is a blue chemise and blue trowsers, the former reaching to near the knee, and the latter to the ankle; over their heads they throw an oblong piece of white cloth, which hangs down in front to the elbows, and terminates in a point behind extending to their knees. In the cold weather the men wear jackets of an entire piece of numud or felt, and the women have jackets of sheep-skin which they wear with the wool inside in cold weather, and outside in hot weather. The Illyauts are of Turkish or Tartar origin, and they generally speak the Turkish language. There are several classes of them, dis tinguished as Illyauts, Buctiaries, Mauhmesuni, Felhi, and Loors. It is said that the Mauhmesuni, residing in the surhud or cold moun tains near Kauzeroon, have preserved the original northern features and fair complexions by forbearing to intermarry with the other tribes, and that their women are famed as being very fair and beau tiful. These people are noted robbers, and spread terror round the country adjacent to that which they inhabit.' eral ^esof^ esuni » Jeli.aaH, fcsurlmdorcollii oiiginal norttemfei iteraiarry witlfcl being very fablfe id spread tenor nit t k. 83 CHAPTER VII.

DREARINESS OF THE COUNTRY. May the 7 th.—We marched from Cultabad at three in the morning, on a road which led directly among mountains. After proceeding four miles we passed by the foot of a rocky mountain, on which are the ruins of a fort called Istakar, now unoccupied; here the road began to be a little stony and uneven: at six miles we passed a bridge on our left, and a road leading over it in that direction to Shirauz. This bridge had seven arches, extending sixty yards, over the Bund Emir river, running to the left. Although we did not cross it we perceived that, like most public structures in every part of Persia which we had hitherto seen, it was fast hastening to decay. The road onward continued along the foot of the mountain on the right; the river flowed parallel to the road for two miles, and at this dis- , tance we found that its anterior course was from the north westward. In the valley from whence it came there appeared to be three or four villages, an advantage which few valleys in this part of Persia now possess. The mountains on the left were from two to five miles dis tant, We proceeded through the same valley, having rocky moun tains on our right, for eighteen miles ; the road then turned round the end of this mountainous range, and led into another valley, m 284 MAYEN. where we saw the town (for so it may be called) of Mayen, sur rounded by larger trees than we usually observed elsewhere. During our advance thither, we crossed many small channels of water for irri gating the lands of the valley ; they often presented some difficulty, as, though not broad, they were three or four feet deep, with a soft muddy bottom. In various places, a little to the right or left of the road, a foot-path is observed, leading to a slight bridge, formed of a few sticks, covered with grass, and earth above it, just of sufficient strength to bear a man, but too weak for cattle: it is necessary for travellers to beware of these places at night, as they are very dan gerous. The road to Mayen, at the mouth of the valley, was crossed by a very rapid stream, breast-deep, which obliged us to take a devi ous route, with considerable difficulty, over rocks and through chan nels of water, frequently up to the girths, round the base of the hill before mentioned, on our right or to the south-east, for nearly three miles, the rapid stream winding close on the left of our road. When the streams, thus divided and diminished, had spread over the valley, we quitted this road, which led to another village, and crossed the low land in the direction of Mayen, then not far distant on our left. After some further difficulty in crossing three streams, and flounder ing through ploughed fields saturated with water, we arrived at the caravansera of Mayen at ten o’clock, after a march of seven hours. Had not the interruption of the river diverted us from the high road, the distance would not have been more than twenty-two miles; but, by the circuit we were thus obliged to make, our march was extended to nearly twenty-five miles. The northern sides of the hills near us on our right, and of those fifteen miles distant on our left, were not quite free from snow, some streaks and spots of which appeared near their summits. The ther mometer at sunrise, on our march, was at 39 °; but after nine in the morning we felt the heat to be very considerable. Although Mayen is a large village, or perhaps a small town, the caravansera is suffered to go to ruin: there was not a single cell in it fit for a human being to sleep in. Even with the assistance of theMAYEN. 85 Prince’s man, we could merely obtain leave to go into a room used as a cow-house* We had fared, however, no better at Kunara and Cultabad. We here began to be apprehensive that we had been Imposed upon by the guide, and that he had conducted us by this route in order to afford his friend, our muleteer, an opportunity of foraging at his ease, and without expense, regardless of our sufferings through want of accommodation. We found these filthy places infested with flies, musquitoes, fowls, fleas, mice, bats, and other vermin, which so annoyed us as to prevent our taking repose either by day or night. Mayen is surrounded by many gardens enclosed with walls, where, as well as in the cultivated places in the vicinity, we observed a great number of walnut and mulberry trees, of larger growth than any that we had seen in Persia. It is in a truly romantic situation at the foot of rocky mountains, capt with snow, enclosing the valley, which is four miles long and nearly two broad. The entrance to it by the way we came is narrow; and at the other extremity there is a defile, so confined as to be perceptible only on a near approach, through which a river enters and a road leads out of it. The inhabitants were occupied in ploughing and irrigating their fields ; and a few black tents of the Illyauts were visible. During the night of this march, we saw many fires on the acclivity of the rocky hills, some of them made in natural caves, which had been chosen no doubt by Illyaut families, as affording warmer shelter than their tents. The grasses, which in Persia are rarely good, were better and more abundant in the valley of Mayen; they even seemed luxuriant in a territory where limestone rock so universally predominates. They were mixed with a kind of wild barley, or something of which the head very much resembled it. It is impossible for words to depict the utter misery of the Persian poor, or labouring class of people, in their domestic condition. The walls and roofs of their habitations are of mud, which, in consequence of the severity of the climate, are, it is true, more substantial than86 CONDITION OF THE PERSIAN POOR. those of the same kind of dwellings in India, but the interior is much more filthy, for the Indian people, and the women in parti cular, pay greater attention to cleanliness. Here, however, as among that people, and the lower classes in Ireland, the cow, calf, dog, fowls, swallows, mice, cat, all harbour in the same hovel and live together with its tenants. The thickness of the mud walls in the Persian huts, may be said to augment their interior accommodations, by allowing niches and cavities to be formed for various uses. Some of these, having a stone ledge in front, are made so high as to serve for rack and manger; there is a space above for grass, and another below for grain and chopped straw. About eighteen inches beneath this there is a hole with a stick across, to which the cattle’s head ropes are tied. Similar niches for securing cattle are generally made at regular distances of about five feet, all along the interior side of any enclosure wall, by which the court or area belonging to the house is bounded; and they are very useful, as they prevent the forage from being trampled upon, and afford the means of keeping the cattle secure and within sight. Other cavities in the walls of the houses are used as shelves, and in the corners there is a projection of mud, shaped like a swallow’s nest, which contains fat with a piece of cotton wick, and thus serves for a lamp. At the bottom of another corner a sort of coop is made, projecting about fifteen inches, and twelve in height, to hold two or three fowls and chickens: a round hole in the middle of the floor serves as a fire-place both for cooking and for giving warmth to the dwelling. The roofs of these hovels are thus constructed : first a row of branches of trees laid across from wall to wall; over these branches a smaller row of sticks ; upon them reeds, which, together with the sticks, project beyond the exterior of the walls about two feet; over the whole, a coating consisting of earth mixed up with water and chopped straw; this is beaten down flat, and rolled with a heavy wooden roller. Such is the entire defence against snow, and also against rain, of which there falls very little in the southern part of Persia.IMAUM ZADA ISHMAEL. 87 In one hut I observed a lamp for burning fat, made of earthenware glazed green, about two inches and a half in diameter and three inches high, with a spout two inches long for the lighted end of the wick to project from. Their implements of husbandry are quite as simple as those of India, which they much resemble. Their ploughs and harrows are generally drawn by two, but sometimes by only one bullock. May 8 th. —We left Mayen at three, and after proceeding for a quarter of a mile through water-channels, turned on our left to the northward, and entered the defile between mountains about six hundred yards asunder, the road extending along the foot of the western range. At four miles and a half we crossed a river from the left, which continues along the left of the road until it reaches the village of Imaum Zada Ishmael. Here are about fifty houses; and in a building of great antiquity, surmounted by a dome, is the sepulchre, built of brick, of the saint of that name. The village is nine miles distant from Mayen. Passing onward, we began a gentle ascent, turning to the north ward. At the end of ten miles the ascent is much steeper, and very rocky, with high mountains to the right and left. At eleven miles and a half, on the summit, there is a tower at which are posted a few armed men, looking like banditti; but acting, or pretending to act, as a guard. Close at hand is a reservoir of very fine water, which at this time was nearly full; it is covered by arches of masonry, and has a door, with stone steps leading down to the water. The road beyond this ascends for about six hundred yards on the brow T of the left hand hill, where a view is obtained of the valley and ruins of Oojan, distant about five miles, and also of another village called Abroze, near a pond of water. A steep descent then occurs of nearly a mile, where the road becomes flat, and extends over a plain for more than four miles to Oojan, which we found deserted and entirely destroyed. The caravansera was in ruins, and so filthy as to be fit only to shelter cattle. There being no better accom modation to be had, we cleared out a small cell and laid our beds00 JAN. 88 in it, but a cold, and no doubt very unwholesome damp, affected our limbs when we had lain down. Oojan is situated in the centre of a valley about eight miles in breadth, and extending N. W. and S. E. about fifty miles; the moun tains which bound it have still snow on them. The only human beings to be seen here were Illyauts, with their black tents near them ; these people furnished us with milk and butter, but no other provision could be procured ; for want of forage for our horses, we gave them long grass from the edges of the marshy ground near the river. A very short distance beyond the caravansera, there is a bridge, now falling to ruin, of nine arches, over a fine small stream of clear and very cold water, running to the N. W. along the centre of the valley. May 9 th.—We crossed this bridge in the dark, before day-break, with some danger, as it v/as very insecure, and proceeded along an excellent road near the N. E. or right hand range of hills for twelve miles. We here quitted the direct route to Aspas, which village appeared to be about three miles distant. Near it is shewn the swamp where the King Bharamgour was drowned while pursuing the gourkhur, or wild ass. The horse with his rider, as well as the gourkhur, disappeared, and were never seen again. It is a circum stance worthy of notice, that wild asses do not now inhabit this part of the country. This valley was formerly believed to have been the site of many palaces built with ornaments of various colours, and used as hunting- seats by Shah Bharamgour; but there is now scarcely a village re maining, nor can any ruins be found of sufficient consequence to give credibility to such a tradition, unless those of what seems to have been a saint’s tomb at Oojan can be so considered. The level expanse of this district, the goodness of its soil, its pas tures, and its water, would to any industrious nation have appeared too desirable to be overlooked, and would have attracted numerous settlers; the Illyauts alone seem to be sensible of its value, and occupy it during some of the spring months. Throughout the wholeKOOSHKEHZERD. 89 distance of sixteen miles, from Mayen to Oojan, we saw only the two villages above mentioned, the latter of which lies east from the top of the pass of Imaum Zada Ishmael, and is distant from it about four miles. This day we proceeded fifteen miles farther along the valley, and saw only the village of Aspas. On turning from the main road, we ascended an easy winding pass leading to an eminence which com manded a view of many miles around, and then continued our way through another fine valley for eighteen miles and a half, and not until having gone that distance did we arrive at, or see any habitation except a few straggling black tents of Illyauts. We now found a decayed village called Kooshkehzerd, consisting of about twenty miserable huts and a caravansera in ruins, occupied by a guard of Buktiaries. These men were stationed to protect the road, though they staid in the caravansera; and, to judge from their appearance, they were more likely to employ themselves in plundering passengers than in attending to their safety. The extraordinary desolation and misery observable throughout this country, on the face of which hardly a shrub is to be seen, are far beyond my powers of description. Every man and woman whom we met accosted us for money ; and one even took hold of the reins of my horse and stopped him forcibly, in order to obtain some relief from me. Their mien and their ragged garb alike bespoke extreme wretchedness. On enquiry, I found that the distress occasioned by the dreadful maladministration of government was at this period aggravated by a scarcity in the northern districts, from which these wretches were endeavouring to migrate to places of greater plenty. A boy of ours who had been sent to a distance of about a mile and a half to procure milk, was met by a man on the road, who, availing himself of his own superior strength, took from him a pair of shoes nearly new; and incidents of a similar kind occur so frequently, in consequence of the deplorable state of the country, that no single native dare move unarmed from village to village, if even his clothes be good enough to be an object of plunder.90 DESOLATION OF THE COUNTRY. What is to be the fate of this miserable country ? From all that we have already observed, it appears that at no very distant period, the south and west parts of Persia, at least, must be divided among a number of chieftains, whose hardy followers, accustomed to a preda tory life, dwell together in fastnesses, or rather like wild beasts in dens among the mountains, to which, when worsted they can easily retire, and subsist on acorns, wild figs, almonds, and other fruits that abound there. Even young thistles will to them be food to which they are not unused. We marched twenty-two miles over some fine well-watered plains, on which no human beings were to be seen except those who were wandering toward another country as beggars. We arrived (May 10 th,) at Dehgurdoo, which, we had been told, was inhabited. Its caravan sera, which had been described to us as excellent, we found too filthy even to keep a cow in. This season was the beginning of spring, and the ground in many places was covered like a carpet with tulips and other flowers, yet hardly a blade of good grass or forage was to be found; on the margins of the streams there grew some like rushes. Not a shrub was to be observed exceeding three feet in height, and scarcely a bird or animal of any kind appeared to enliven this dreary solitude. Similar signs of desolation had been manifest for a considerable distance. Even the wandering Illyauts avoid this barren waste as destitute of sustenance for asses and sheep, none of which are here observable. During the two last rather long marches the glare was excessive, and the heat in the mornings was annoying and scorching to a greater degree than what I could remember to have felt at the same hour in India, yet snow still lay in the hollows of the mountains. The rocks still consisted of the yellowish lime stone already noticed, with occasionally some masses of amygdaloid, of which I think sandstone formed the bed. Every thing on the plains below seemed covered with dust of a light sandy colour, which augmented the glare and gave a dismal uniformity to the view. To the various enquiries we made concerning the causes of the extending devastation and rapid decline of the country, the answerYEZDEHKHA UST. 91 generally given ascribed these evils to the oppressions of the govern ment. We here found an instance in point. This village of Dehgur- doo, in the time of Kerim Khaun, about forty years ago, had twice the number of inhabitants, and double the extent of ground under cultivation that it now has, and paid thirty tomauns, or pounds annually: the present governors want to exact three hundred; this is a stretch of oppression which the inhabitants cannot bear, and they all talk of soon evacuating the place, intending to go either to the Surhud, or otherwise to the eastward into the district of Kermaun. On passing a little water channel, I observed a water-mill turned by it, which I went to examine, and found it to be of very small ditnensions, the force being only applied to turn a grinding-stone; and its mechanism was of the most simple construction. The country onward being depopulated, and affording a favourable haunt for thieves, who have long infested it, we were strongly desired not to march before day-light, and we adopted the caution. We had a good road for twelve miles among low hills, and then arrived at a more rocky height, on which was a tower occupied by men with match-locks to protect the road. Near it was a spring of better water than we had before seen. Adjacent were the ruins of a deserted village and a tomb, which were jointly denominated Goomuzeh Lala. Beyond this, the road continued over stony hills, and through valleys between them: at nineteen miles, we passed through * one which opened on a fine plain, where we saw at the distance of six miles the village of Yezdehkhaust. We were overtaken by a violent storm of hail, rain, thunder, and lightning, which lasted an hour and a half, and soon wet us through. We continued our way, and at twenty- three miles descended about sixty or seventy feet, by the road which extended along the rocky side of a narrow valley about four hundred yards wide, between steep acclivities ; it was partially culti vated, and was watered by a small stream. At about twenty-four miles, we arrived at a newly constructed caravansera, opposite the fortified village of Yezdehkhaust, the hovels of which are built on the edge of the precipice on the north side. This new caravansera is n 292 YEZDEHKHAUST. erected on the site of a former one, of the age of Shah Abbas the Great. There are caverns in the rocks sixty feet below the houses of the fort, inhabited by many families; among them are several shops. Along the rocky sides of the valley to the distance of half a mile from the fortified village there are similar caverns; they were doubt less originally intended for burial-places. The rocks here are all amygdaloidal, and composed of stones and gravel indurated into one mass of various colours — blue, red, yellow, and white ; some of the more compact parts are of a blueish tint, and apparently limestone; these are traversed by ramifications of a milk-white substance of nearly the same degree of hardness. Tomb-stones are made of this substance, which if polished would appear like marble. There are other sepulchral tablets of a white compact stone which may be termed marble of an inferior quality. This village is called a fort because it is difficult of access, being situated on a long upright mass of amygdaloidal rock fronting the deep valley before mentioned, and separated from the rocks behind by another ravine. To complete its security there is a narrow dry ditch with a few sticks laid across, to form a bridge of communication : and hence, although it possesses in itself no means of defence, the ignorant Persians deem it impregnable. They asked me if I thought that cannon could do it any harm. About &lt;300 yards to the N\ E. of the fortification, there is a new built brick cupola and a dwelling, under which is the tomb of a saint, named Imaum Zada Ally, a relation of Imaum Zada Ibrahim. The term Imaum Zada signifies the son of a saint, and it is an hereditary title. The road throughout the march hither was generally good, though in some places rather stony. The weather, during the whole day was cool, the thermometer at half-past nine in the morning beino' only at 58°. There had been rain during the night of the 10 th, and on this night also, occasioning very cloudy weather in the morning. May 12 th. We moved at four o’clock toward Aminabad, along a road leading up the ravine, behind the rocky fortification, and thenOSHAUK PLANT. 93 near the tomb above mentioned, where it became broad and level, and had the appearance of being much frequented. At about six miles we passed two ruined fortifications bounding the right and left of the road, and marking, as I was informed, the confines of the province of Fars to which one belongs, and of Irauk, in which the other is situated. Within half a mile of the fortification of Yezdehkhaust, the stony plains abound in the Oshauk plant, which produces the gum ammo nia. It grows to about six feet in height, some of the stems being of a dark colour, like ripe sugar-cane, and others of a light green, tinged a little with lake colour near the joints. The following are some of its peculiarities: it bears leaves only on the joints near the ground, where they grow thickly around the stem, which at the root is two inches in diameter; the first four knots are within a few inches of each other, and have the leaves first spread out into a sheath, which nearly surrounds the stem; the next four joints are progressively at greater distances, with a sheath to each of them, at the upper end of which are leaves. These diminish in size at every joint, until at the fifth there are none perceptible at the end of the sheath. This fifth joint has a single long branch of flowers, proceeding out of a long sheath, and they both have four divisions each, rather shorter than the other; at the fourth, the centre stem becomes more thickly set in every direction with these flower-stems, the sheaths of which are very small, and diminish in length and thickness until they terminate in one flower-stem. The sheaths are thin and light-coloured; each flower atlheres by a small shank to the flower-stem, and is round and of the size of a pea, appearing to be composed of a number of smaller flowers not much larger than pins’ heads. These, when examined by the microscope, exhibit five leaves, curling inwards, each holding a seed of the shape of a kidney. The little globular flowers surround the flower-stem at irregular distances, becoming smaller near the end of it. In the latter end of June, and from that period until the end of July, the lower leaves turn yellow, and the plant becomes ripe. ButAMINABAD. 94 in the month of May, while the plant is soft, an insect of the beetle kind begins to puncture the stem in every direction with his pro boscis, which seems well adapted to the purpose. As the stem shrinks and dries, there exudes from these punctuies a milky juice, which flows down and indurates near the joints, whence it is ga thered by the inhabitants of the adjacent country, about the latter end of July. A native of Aminabad, accustomed to collect the gum annually, brought me eight of the plants and one of the insects 5 it was from him that the above description was obtained. He gave me also some of the gum of the preceding year, and shewed me the quantity collected from one plant, which is somewhat less than a pound. The gum was very impure, having bits of the dried plant, leaves, and even small stones in it. The individual collector sells it in this rough state, at from half a rupee to one rupee per maund of 71 lbs., to the dealer, who buys up the quantities gathered by various collectors, and sends them to the coast, or to Ispahan, for sale. Specimens of the gum, and of the leaves, flowers, and perforated stem of the plant, as well as of the insect, were sent by us to Bombay, to gratify the researches of the curious on this subject. After marching nine miles over an excellent broad road, occasion ally rather stony, we arrived at the village of Aminabad. We had been led to imagine it a heap of ruins, but were agreeably surprised to find that very great progress had been made in rebuilding it, the principal part being now nearly finished, on a very judicious plan. The approach to it was by a broad road, lined with trees, beyond which were garden-enclosures, which formed the entrance from the southward. This approach was about 150 yards in extent, when it opened into a quadrangle, on the east side of which were stables and a caravansera, having in front a tank for washing, and near that a covered cistern for draught water. The west face was occupied by the front of a mud fort, with towers and a gate; and in this enclo sure were securely sheltered 150 human beings, the remaining inha bitants of this place, which only seven years ago was a flourishingPROTECTION AGAINST ROBBERS. 95 town. The new buildings have been erected within the last three years. The caravansera is built of brick, on the site of a former one, erected by order of Shah Abbas the Great. It is of an octagon form, and defended by battlements on the outer walls, with upper rooms over the gate. In consequence of a want of water, and the preva lence of a scarcity throughout the country, the Nizam eh Dowla, the Governor of Ispahan, was induced to discontinue these works, and most of the inhabitants fled to other districts. On the north face of the square is a mosque, and adjacent to it a hummaum, or hot bath. A straight road, corresponding with the approach already described, is continued to the northward, and there it was intended to erect a gate. The inhabitants are obliged to dwell in a fortified enclosure, for two rea sons : first, the fear of being plundered by gangs of robbers, who infest this and the adjacent districts; and secondly, a similar dread of being exposed to the depredations of parties of armed men, be longing to government, who frequently pass through this place, it being on the high road to the capital, Ispahan. Five miles to the westward is the fine town of Isferjoon, which, as it abounds in water, and has superior advantages of security, has become populous. This also belongs to the government of the Ni- zameh Dowla, and owes much of its prosperity to his judicious ad ministration. Farther to the west and north-west is a range of mountains, with snow on them; beyond which, at the distance of about two marches, commences the mountainous tract Surhud, or cold country, inhabited by the Bucktiaries. In consequence of the daring depredations committed by the nu merous bands of robbers in this country, an arrangement has lately been made by the existing government for the security of travellers on the road. Certain of the inhabitants have permission to form themselves into a body, and to go armed for the defence of the country, holding themselves responsible for whatever property may be plundered from travellers; and as an equivalent for this defence and guarantee, they are allowed to levy a tax on each loaded animal passing through the district which they protect. This tax does not96 PROTECTION AGAINST ROBBERS. amount to more than one rupee for five mules or ten asses loaded, or for three loaded camels; but as there is much difference in the value of the various articles of burden, the rate of charge is not fixed, but abatements are made according to circumstances. The amount thus levied is distributed in pay to these armed associates, who receive no other emolument. When any property has been plundered, they immediately pursue the robbers, until they either succeed in recover ing it, or are repulsed by superior force. While we were at the cara- vansera, two wounded men were brought to us for inspection, with a request that we would give advice as to the proper mode of treat ment. One of them was shot through both arms, and the other through one knee and the calf of the right leg. The wounds had been inflicted two months ago; and the poor man’s legs had been dressed with tents of cotton passed into the orifices of the wounds until they met, thus occasioning a great and incessant discharge of matter, which had very much debilitated him. We advised another mode of practice, consistent, as far as we knew, with that of European surgeons, and tending, as we hoped, to accelerate the man’s recovery. We could not help reflecting, that small pamphlets might, with a spirit of pure philanthropy and Christian charity, be here circulated in the Persian and Arabic languages, describing the most simple methods to be pursued in cases of wounds, either from sword-cuts or musketry, with such directions as might prevent or alleviate the miseries occasioned by them. A short treatise, also, on the manage ment and cure of ophthalmia would be highly useful. The Cauzee, or Moola, the priest of each village, might have one deposited with him for public use, he being of course qualified to read and explain its contents. This incident leads me again to notice the general distress which presents itself, in all its forms, to the observation of European tra vellers in this country, and is a source of great pain to those in whom the feelings of nature are not deadened. So numerous are the claimants for relief, that it is often necessary, for the sake of quiet ness, to withhold it entirely, lest a boon conferred on one shouldINCONVENIENCES FROM BEGGARS. 97 attract a multitude, whose clamorous importunity there would be no reasonable means of appeasing. The mere difficulties of travelling are trivial, compared with those harrowing or irritating sensations produced by the sight of poor, helpless, naked children, and of feeble men and women, begging for food and clothes, and this too when the traveller is sitting at dinner, and is restrained from giving what he can well spare, by the apprehension that the gift, on being made known, might involve him in trouble, and even in danger. While driven to this harsh alternative, he frequently hears of acts of oppres sion and tyranny that have caused these miseries, and of which he cannot hear the recital with patience. If to these painful emotions we add the anxieties felt for those who are most dear to us, and who may possibly want either advice, protection, or comfort, which we are at too great a distance to administer, it must be concluded that travel ling is by no means so enviable a pastime as the perusal of travels by a comfortable fire-side may represent it to be. To one who has a family, the distresses of children are peculiarly afflicting; for, while detached from every domestic tie, he sits a lonely stranger in a cara- vansera, his mind naturally dwells on the recollection of them, and but too easily yields to despondency. It is in the evening that these melancholy reflections obtrude, and have the deepest influence; a fact to which the experience of many travellers has borne testimony, and for which various reasons have been assigned. The stillness of the hour, the increasing gloom, the fatigue after a day’s journey, the thoughts of home and its social comforts at this period of time, the consciousness of absence, and the sensation of insecurity in a strange country; all these circumstances conspire to depress us when in health, and are doubly formidable in case of indisposition. May 13th. — We moved at two in the morning, and it was not until after ten that we arrived at Komesha, distant twenty-two miles. The morning was very cold, and was rendered more so by a wind from the snowy mountains; the thermometer was rather lower than 38°. At nine miles we passed the town of Muksood Baiguy, which is surrounded by ruins, and saw as we advanced many fine villages98 KOMESHA. in the valley, all on our left. At about twelve miles was one called Zearut Gah, which, with others of which I do not remember the names, very strongly indicated the superior administration of the go vernment of this district: in fact, although the soil of the valley is far from being very rich, yet it has all the signs of a prosperous population,—houses, towers, mud enclosures, kenauts or water-courses, sepulchres protected by mud cupolas, and stone-covered burial-places. These enclosures had trees in them, and here and there even a crow was seen, with numbers of sparrows, which circumstance we noticed on account of the rarity of its occurrence. The town of Komesha is a very long space, encompassed with walls and towers, within which are innumerable ruins of walls, hovels, with arches above ground and kenauts below. Within the walls, and in their vicinity, there was some cultivated ground in a verdant state; we also observed some pigeon-towers, of considerable value. I went to visit the tomb of Imaum Zada Shah Reza, which is situated in a garden one mile and a quarter N. N. E. of the town, at the foot of a rocky mountain. Within the inclosure there are cells for the Dervaishes, a stone tank about 80 feet by 100 ; and another of shallow and clear water 20 feet by 12 , abounding with fish. The tomb of the saint, whose death took place several centuries ago, was originally within the walls. About 400 years ago his remains were brought out hither, and a tomb-stone was placed over them, inscribed with passages from the Koran. At a still later period a cupola of brick was erected over the tomb, and the other enclosures and accom modations for Dervaishes were added. This is generally the case with all these places, and it tends to increase the difficulty of ascer taining the date of their erection. After visiting the tomb I returned to examine some pigeon-towers, of which many were to be seen near it, in the valley. The space of ground adjoining the tomb is now a most extensive burial-ground, having a Shoor Khona, or washing- house of the dead, attached to it. This building is a low dome over a stone reservoir, about six feet square, filled to the brim, and evenPIGEON-TOWER. 99 overflowing with water from a stream which runs into it constantly.

The pigeon tower which I first observed was about forty feet in height, and as many in diameter within. It is surmounted by a smaller one, about ten or twelve feet in diameter, around which are three or four little towers, some square and others round, to serve as entrances for the pigeons. The inside is divided as it were into com partments by six buttresses, which project from the sides toward the centre, leaving there a clear space of twelve feet diameter beneath the upper tower. These buttresses are 18 feet high, and 3 feet thick. In the interior surfaces of all the walls there are holes 8 inches square, and 12 deep, for the nests, (rather diminishing within,) so as to form half an oval. The outer walls of the tower are constructed of stone and mud, and are 4 feet thick. There is a staircase of the same materials, which winds close to the walls, and through arched perforations in the buttresses. Over these buttresses there is an arched floor, which is of course open at the central space beneath the upper tower. Over this there is another arched terrace, which in fact forms the flat roof of the tower, but also leaves an opening in the centre, of the same diameter as that in the floor below. The little towers which surround the central one communicate with the interior by apertures in the roof beneath them, of their own dimensions, that is four or five feet square, or in diameter, as their form is either square or circular. These little towers are full of apertures for the pigeons to enter at, some of them having a small piece of mud projecting as a kind of threshold. Towers of this kind are very numerous in the vicinity of Ispahan; but though they constitute a very valuable species of property, many of them are falling to decay in consequence of the vast depopulation of the country, and pigeons are now much more scarce than in former times. May 14th.—We proceeded towards Mayen along a level and good road, near which were to be seen a few straggling plants of the o 2100 CARAVANSERA. Oshauk. The caravansera at which we put up was built by Shah Abbas the Great, and was certainly the finest that I had hitherto seen. The whole is built of brick, and though now more than 200 years old, much of the building, and the front in particular, exhibit not the slightest marks of age. This was surprising to us, who had observed the destructive effects which heat and moisture rapidly pro duce in India, where the outer coating of such an edifice would, through these causes, be more decomposed in six months. This ex traordinary state of preservation is certainly owing to the temperate and dry climate: not even any marks of wet were to be observed on the outer faces of the building. The bricks are of the usual size, and of a light yellow colour, hav ing more the appearance and consistence of earthen ware than of brick. They seem to have been made of very compact clay, and to have been equably burnt; and these qualities are particularly observ able in those parts which have been rubbed by frequent contact of the hands and feet. The bottom of the building is of blue limestone with white veins; in short of very good marble, though not of the finest quality. The decline of public spirit, and the altered policy of the govern ment, are obvious even in the treatment which this fine building has undergone. Its front, in order that the expense of doors and of attendants might be saved, is blocked up with a mud wall, having for entrance a hole just sufficient for a horse to pass through, with a hurdle for a gate. Indeed travelling in Persia has been almost dis continued, the extortions being so great that by every possible expe dient the inhabitants can barely subsist. During the whole of this and the preceding day’s march, not a blade of grass was to be seen, nor any vegetation, except some weeds, which the mules would eat. The price of barley is one rupee per maund of 7| lbs., and that of bread If rupee, for the same weight. Though we were now at no great distance from the capital, the road for the last two days had been totally destitute of passengers, either horse or foot. There existed no commerce to give a stimulus to travelling; even in the fields thereI yellow coloffl,i ce ot ' ea rtlien ware In ^ compact clapj feareparticiilarljife oWbyirquentcot ouMngis of blue ta l marble, tbougbnotii feed policy of the gir which this fine biiiig re expense of doors si with a mud wall, hari rseto pass through,® Persia has been aliti DEPOPULATION OF THE COUNTRY. 101 were rarely any labourers to be seen. No persons arrived at the cara- vanseras while we remained in them. Here and there we could dis cern a few sheep and goats, but there were no cows grazing; no Yahoo horses running about as in other Asiatic countries. All here seems reduced by oppression and distress to a state of inactivity and torpor. For a space of twenty-four miles, on the principal high road of the country, there is not a single village; no forage, no trees, no people, no cattle, no birds: in short, no trace of animation to relieve the dreariness of glaring rocks, of arid plains, and of roads still whiter with dust. This want of vegetation, so apparent in every direction, is a defect which counterbalances the advantage derived from a dry atmosphere in preserving edifices from decay. It results from the absence of that moisture necessary for the decomposition of the substances of which the soil consists ; hence the whole face of the country, unsusceptible even of this first degree of fertilization, remains in primitive naked ness, and presents a yellow and dusty aspect. With respect to the inactivity of the people, and their indifference as to the preservation of their public buildings, they are principally attri butable, in the opinion of all with whom I conversed on the subject, to the mania of accumulating wealth, which has long possessed most of the people in power. The following circumstance is related as having occurred many years ago to a very high personage, and is an instance in point: — It was his custom to have armed men stationed at a little distance from the front of his palace, whose office it was to fire a volley as soon as he should have mounted his horse, which cir cumstance was to be communicated to them by signal from an officer stationed for that purpose. One day the personage in question took a somewhat longer time than usual in mounting, and the zumbonas, or patereros, were fired by signal from the officer. The horse, a fresh and young one, started ere his rider had gained his seat, and he of course was thrown. He immediately gave orders for the men who fired to be all put to death. The sentence had been executed on about twenty-five, when the remainder petitioned for pardon, alleg- f102 KERRAUTCH. ing that the accident arose through no fault of theirs, and that they would each pay a fine of five tomauns. This offer was accepted, and the remaining culprits were saved, the arbiter of their doom angrily remarking, that he was sorry he had been so hasty with the others, as they would perhaps have contributed their quota, which would have been of more service than the loss of their lives. This was related to me by several persons, who all believed the story. May 15th.—We marched at two in the morning along a rather uneven road, and at three quarters of a mile passed the mud walls of the town of Mayen. Having proceeded ten miles and a half, we went through a pass having some little acclivity, and here the road was rugged and broken. At eight miles farther we deviated from the direct road to Isfurnuk, leaving that village on our right, and conti nued along the high road to Ispahan. We were obliged to take this route in consequence of an extensive swamp, which at this period happened to be much overflowed. At twenty miles we quitted the high road, and began to cross the flat plain, so as to get round the marshy part of it; and after crossing many water-courses, and tra versing some inundated and muddy fields, where not even a foot-path was to be seen, we arrived at the village of Kerrautch instead of that of Isfurnuk. It was at the same distance (six miles) from Ispahan, though in another direction. Here being no caravansera, we put up in a private house.CHAPTER VIII. APPROACH TO ISPAHAN.

FRESH AGREEMENT WITH OUR MULE DRIVER, AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR PROCEEDING. It is remarkable that all the inclosures, either of fields, gardens, or dwellings, are built as if to resist an enemy, with low gates, closed in many instances with doors of stone, and defended with towers on the angles of the walls. This I observe to be particularly the case with all new buildings belonging to the royal family. The country through which we this day passed was rather stony, with the excep tion of the swamp, which being very heavy, retarded our progress so much, that we might with a great deal less trouble have gone on by the other route to a caravausera, near the Chaur Bang, at the en trance of Ispahan. We had been induced to halt here, from an idea that Isfurnuk was six miles nearer than Ispahan ; but this deviation of three miles over a deep and bad road occasioned us a considerable loss of time and labour. In the evening, our Mehmandaur, probably from a desire to im press us with a high idea of the great population of the capital, which104 APPROACH TO ISPAHAN. we were about to enter? and to prepare for our reception in style? told us that he would go on before and get a place ready for our reception; and at the same time advised us to be at the city gates at an early hour next morning? in order to avoid the various difficulties we should be liable to encounter in the middle of the day, in conse quence of the crowds that we should find in the streets at that period. We therefore rose at dawn, and proceeded by a circuitous route to the right of a small hill, until at the end of about six miles, we re gained the high road, which we had quitted the day before. Here commenced the suburbs and gardens of the city, the distant view ot which from the rising grounds, conveyed to us merely the idea of a large town, greatly increased in extent by including within it very many gardens. The approach to Ispahan by all the principal roads is through gar dens. That along which we passed, led through the Chaur Baug (or four gardens) ; on passing the gate of which it divides into two roads, which extend along the principal or central avenue. They are each twenty feet broad, having between them a plot of garden ground fifty feet wide, bordered with two rows of high poplars and plane trees*, rising from among bushes of rose trees and jessamine, which were now in full bloom. In the middle flows a stream of clear water in an open channel of white masonry, nearly level, and having falls of masonry wherever there is an inclination of the ground. This avenue is enclosed by walls of masonry 18 or 20 feet high ; which, together with the trees, afford an agreeable shade during the greater part of the day. These walls are so thick that arched recesses have been formed in them three feet deep, with the breadth of a pillar only be tween them. The basement of the arches is of such convenient height, as to serve for seats in these recesses throughout the whole ex tent. At regular distances of about 200 yards, the roads unite round a basin of water, opposite which on either hand are gateways leading to * Called Chinaur, perhaps originally brought from the plains of Shinaur.ARRIVAL AT ISPAHAN. 105 dwelling houses for servants and travellers, and to shops near the gates for sherbets, hookahs, bread, acid milk, and other refreshments. ■ After passing through the Four Gardens, which are altogether about a mile in extent, we came to a bridge over the river Zainderood, having walls on each side with arches, and a narrow foot-path under them, and in the centre rooms projecting over the river, for persons to sit and smoke in. The road over the bridge is about 30 feet wide, and level throughout; its extent in length may be about 200 feet. After passing over, we entered the Bazar of Shah Abbas, which was really grand, and replete with very superior accommodations. At intervals to the right and left there were large folding doors of cara- vanseras for the convenience of merchants ; but now, unfortunately, used as stabling for the cattle of the town, principally asses. On quitting the Bazar we passed through other gardens, resembling those already described, having a stream of water in the midst, opening to tanks, and one or two small falls constructed of marble, carved on its surface, like the scales of fish, to give more lustre to the water on its descent. In one place there is a fall of about eight feet, into a cir cular basin, around which are niches for bathers, so arranged as to screen them from the observation of passengers. Having left the gardens we came to a narrow, low, and ill-built mud gateway, flanked by two small towers and a wall leading from them. Here we imme diately perceived both by sight and very strongly by scent, the infe riority of the paltry buildings of later date—their narrow avenues, low, dark, and confined arches, and equally mean shops, the whole obscured with smoke and dirt. We could here guess the real drift of our Mehmandaur in advising us to move thus early through this part of the town ; for, as we were on horseback, we might at a later hour have been greatly impeded, if not totally obstructed by the carriage of goods into and from the shops. We then went through another gate and bazar equally narrow, but rather more lofty, with some better shops at intervals, and entered the Meydaun Shah, a grand qua drangle, about 500 yards in length by 200 in breadth, having in theINTERIOR OF THE CAPITAL. middle of one of the long sides a square building of six stories, in which was a fine hall, supported by pillars, where Shah Abbas used to re view his troops, and see horses exercised in the square below. Op posite to this building, which is called Ally Khaupy, is a very beau tiful mosque, and at the southern end is the JVfusjud Shah, of which I took a drawing from the Ally Khaupy. This is the highest building in the city; and from its terraced roof I beheld many of the principal edifices and public places. Of these, besides the two mosques already mentioned, there were the JVIusjud JVIadre Shah, the Hushteh Be- husht, or Seven Paradises, the Gool Dushteh Baug, the Cheyl Sit- toon, or Forty Pillars, the Behisht Ayeen, the Amarut Noo, or New Palace, the Aungoorishtoon or Naraugistoon, or Grape and Orange House, the upper and lower Chaur Baug, the Huft Duss, or Seven Residences, the Ayneh Khoneh, or Palace of Mirrors, and numerous mosques and minarets of the city, as well as of the Yahoodeca or Jewish quarter, and of the Joolfa or Armenian quarter. There were ruins also of numerous places of former note, intermixed with other ruined heaps of common dwellings, and streets all covered with yellow dust. One of Shah Abbas’s palaces having been assigned to us as a re sidence, we proceeded thither, and after passing by high walls through many turnings, we entered by rather small doors into the area. We found the audience hall very magnficent; its front is open, and sup ported by four pillars covered with looking-glass, resting on stone pedestals; a dwarf railing joined their basements above the floor, which were three feet of stone. The extent of the room is 78 feet by 35 , the height of the pillars to the long beams below the transverse ones, is 20 feet. In the midst is a tank of marble, 18 feet by 15, having a fountain, with a tray or basin of marble to intercept and dis perse the water in its fall. The pillars support a square beam 14 inches deep; on which, and on the inner wall, rest the cross beams, which are joined by a concave moulding, the whole ornamented with colours on a gold ground. The beams below are covered with looking- glass, and on the sides are represented hunting scenes, in miniatureCHEYL SITTOON. 107 to*! or Grape ad (y' 4eW I)*, ,,11 * of Mirrors, and im 'eHiBoftklakooln, uenian quarter, There | note, interuiixed will j| treets all covered with jeli i been assigned to us as is nassinffbv high walls tbi rail doors into them 1 its front is open, di )king-glass, resting od l 'oasements above the fe tent of the room is Wdi beams below the tr» i of marble, 18 Wf f marble to j support a si* '* jJ, rest tie ®® 18 ’ ( |, e whole om®* 1 ; jdw are covered paintings on a gold ground. A section of the ceiling would exhibit its square centre, or highest part, covered with looking-glass, the sloping sides studded with stars of the same substance, and the in termediate space covered with smaller stars and figures, also flowers painted in red, blue, and gold. The curves are ornamented with gold ground, and with paintings of hunting scenes; and the last ho rizontal division, even with the bottoms of the beams, is adorned with blue and gold flowers. The walls are ornamented in the following order, commencing from below. There is a wainscot of Tabriz marble, four feet high, variegated with coloured flowers; next a range of pictures, and niches of two feet in height; then a broad blue moulding of eighteen inches, with a running pattern on it of gold flowers, leaves, and scrolls ; above this are arches covered with looking-glasses, having a pillar between each. The arrangement of the side doors, niches, &amp;c., if described as commencing with the opening of the front, is in the following order. Above the wainscot of marble already mentioned, are, first, a picture; next to it a niche; then gold flowers on a red ground; another picture ; a door with gilt lattice work; a picture ; a double door of gilt filligree work ; a picture ; a door; a picture; a niche with gold flowers on a red ground; and thus in succession. The plan of the front was similar to that of the sides, in respect to the alternation of doors and pictures, with the addition of a fire-place on each side. The entrance to this audience hall was through the space between the wall and the pillar next to it, the in termediate spaces between the other pillars being closed by the dwarf railing. In the middle of the long face there is an open arch of 18 feet, leading to a room or recess, elevated one foot above the au dience hall. This apartment was for the Shah, the nobility, and per sons of elevated rank. May 17th.—We visited the Cheyl Sittoon, or Forty Pillars, which we found to be a most superb palace; it is supported by twenty pillars, which, by reflection in the tank, appear as forty, and hence the name is derived. The audience hall is one hundred and twenty feet long by sixty broad, and fifty feet in height. The four p 2108 PICTURES. central pillars standing at the angles of the tank) rest on pedestals carved as lions, the heads at the corners serving for two each. Those heads facing the tank, spout water into it. The other pillars have simply a square stone pedestal. The pillars and walls, in short all the parts of the audience hall, except the doors and the wainscoting of marble, are covered with looking-glasses. Behind this hall is a room with a tank in it, and from it a door opens to the great saloon, or sitting hall, adorned with six large paintings; that to the right of the door on entering represents Shah Abbas the Second, with the Ambassadors from India, sent by Aurungzebe : in the foreground, or lower part of the picture, are dancing-women of Georgia, with castagnets. The picture opposite represents Shah Abbas the First, surnamed the Great, receiving the Ambassador from Turkey, Ab dallah Ahzeez Khaun, an Usbeg. Near the Shah is Allawurdee Khaun, one of his surdars, who built a bridge of thirty-three arches over the Zainderood. The third picture, which is in the centre arch to the left of the door, represents Naudir Shah fighting with Mahmoud Shah in India; in this subject are introduced elephants and Indians. The fourth picture opposite this represents Shah Ishmael Mauzee engaged in battle with the Sultan Selim of Con stantinople. This engagement took place near Chaulderoon. In the fifth picture, on the right of this, is represented Shah Tamasp the First, with the Paudsha of India, Hummayoon, sitting near him, supposed to be complaining that his, the Persian monarch’s, surdars, or generals, have taker his country from him: he obtains from the Shah a hundred and twenty thousand horsemen to recover it. There are Georgian women depicted in the foreground with tambours and pandean reeds. The sixth picture represents Shah Ishmael engaged with the Turks under Shah Ibek, Khaun of the Usbegs. Here it is pretended that seven of Shah Ishmael’s officers routed 75,000 Turks, and took whole droves of them prisoners. On the right, at a little distance, Shah Ishmael’s horsemen appear to be coming up, with their fingers raised to their mouths ; a gesture indicating extreme astonishment at these mighty feats, and denoting IshmaelAMARUT NOO. 109 to merit the title of King of Kings. The keeper, in explaining this subject, added that Nadir Shah had himself declared, that had he lived in the time of Shah Ishmael he would have been considered as his slave. These six large pictures, about thirteen feet by ten, are better executed than most of the others, and may probably be considered as faithful, and truly interesting representations of the costume and manners of the times to which they relate. There were, however, four paintings under glass in the outer room, small portraits of the Shah’s mistresses, three of which I considered the best pieces in the whole collection. They represented Georgian slaves in different dresses of that time, all very elegant and truly Persian ; and annexed are copies of two of those paintings. There are some inferior apartments behind the picture hall, but they were said to be defaced, and unworthy of notice. We now proceeded to examine the Amarut Noo, or New Palace, which contains some very extensive ranges of apartments lately finished by the Governor, Nizam ed Dowla. The apartments are indeed very elegantly fitted up, and are destined to be occupied by His present Majesty and his suite. They are said to be furnished with all that he can immediately want; though it is not to be sup posed that his whole family, including all those who are alive out of his two hundred and forty children, could be accommodated in them. The pictures are numerous, and they are all portraits of His present Majesty, Futteh Ali Shah, and his noble family of sons; a well imagined compliment from the person who prepared this royal residence. The rooms extend along three sides of a square or garden, and are sufficient for the accommodation of an hundred persons with every possible convenience. There are orange groves between the sitting-rooms ; and tanks of water are found in the principal apartments, which are all arched. At the two extreme angles of the building are towers; one of them is fitted up for sitting in, and has a passage beneath it to the Cheyl Sittoon; the other110 ARMENIAN CHURCH. is intended, no doubt, for a place of security, as its iron-barred win dows show. These towers spoil the pleasing effect of the whole structure, but they may possibly have their use in future times. These and similar features of security are observable in the plan of all new buildings erected by the great in Persia; I remarked them first even in mansions of private families at Shirauz, and afterwards at Aminabad, and in all new caravanseras, &amp;c. May 18th. — We went to visit the Armenian church at Joolfa; passing first through another road of Chaur Baug Gardens, we crossed the bridge of thirty-three arches, already mentioned, which was erected by Allawurdee Khaun, though it bears the name of Shah Abbas. Each arch is of twenty feet span, and fifteen in height ; the piers are eleven feet thick. The bridge is altogether fifty feet wide; each pier is divided into two of twenty feet each, by an arch of ten feet span, nine feet high in the middle; the spring of the arches begins at six feet. Through these central arches in the piers there is a foot-path for passengers under the bridge for its whole length, square stepping stones being placed in the river under the transverse or main arches from pier to pier. The road over the bridge has an arcade on each side; and at each sixth or eighth arch, there are staircases cut out of the piers, leading down to the water. The foundation of this bridge, as high as three feet above the water, is of stone, and the superstructure of brick. The road over it is thirty feet wide, and is paved with round stones ; the arcades on each side occupy ten feet, the exterior wall being two and a half feet thick and fifteen feet high ; the small arch two and a half feet wide, and the inner wall five feet thick. At every fifth or sixth arch, there is an opening from the bridge road to admit foot passengers. These side-paths are much frequented by women and children, to whom they afford great security. Under the centre arch there is a tank in the river of an octagonal form, built of stone, through which the water flows. The stepping-stofies between the piers are herePICTURES. Ill laid at the sides of the tank instead of being placed in a direct line across. Having passed this bridge over the river Zainderood, which separates the suburb of Joolfa from Ispahan, we proceeded for about a quarter of a mile, through many narrow streets, having high dead walls on each side, and a gutter of running water in the middle, and at length dismounted at the principal Armenian church and residence of the archbishop. The entrance to the church from the street was through a gate covered with plates of iron: we advanced through some zigzag passages, apparently constructed for defence, and came to the area in which was a belfry of small bells : this was a square struc ture erected on four stone pillars, and situated before the church door. It was placed here, and not on the church, that the edifice might not seem to tower above the mosques. The church was small, and very much covered with paintings of the period of its erection, which took place about two hundred and fifteen years ago, in the reign of Shah Abbas. The paintings are chiefly representa tions of our Saviour, of the Virgin Mary, of the Saints and Apostles. In them are depicted the more remarkable events of sacred his tory, such as the carrying of the cross, the resurrection of Christ, &amp;c. &amp;c. The subject of the largest picture is the general resurrec tion at the day of judgment; and here, as in many similar works in Roman Catholic churches, the principal groups of figures are monks of the country going in procession directly to heaven. In the lower or foreground is seen an abyss of gloom and fire with open-mouthed dragons, through the jaws and bodies of which are seen to pass the wicked wretches doomed to eternal flames. Above the monks are represented many angels in the act of sounding their golden trum pets. There was one circumstance which I could not help remark ing : I had observed that many of the smaller pictures represented matrons, of whom mention is made in sacred history, with a mien and attitude designed to excite reverence; yet not one female, not even a child, has a place in the resurrection on the day of judgment. This exclusion may have been intended as a compliment to the112 DEPOPULATION OF ISPAHAN. Persians; who, believing that women have no souls, of course assign them no existence in heaven. How uncharitable! when the ter restrial paradise of every Mussulman, like that of most Christians, is in a woman’s love. Had the Armenians of that age, like many religious men of the present day, been careless and indifferent' as to the prevailing opi nions and prejudices of the Persians, true believers of the Koran, and had their sole anxiety been to convert them and render them either hypocritical or sincere members of the Greek church, as events might turn out, they might have tried to render the effects of this painting more subservient to their desired influence over the minds of the Persian men, (who alone could have seen and would have admired it,) by peopling the region of felicity with angels of the fair sex, assisting Eve (as described by Milton) in her prayers for the pardon of frail mortals; and even the direct road to heaven might have been shared by the fair of Georgia and Circassia, whose forms would have been a fine contrast to those of the bearded monks. By these means also the transition from the view of so much bliss to that of the region of woe, where monsters are devour ing old male sinners, would have been far more appalling. In the time of Shah Abbas there were in Joolfa twelve thousand houses of Armenians, and twenty-four churches. There are now not more than six hundred of the former, and twelve of the latter. They have a convent containing fourteen nuns, and a monastery in which the archbishop and bishops who do not marry reside. From this diminution of the Armenian inhabitants we may esti mate the great depopulation of Ispahan, and indeed the general decline of Persia. The Armenians were exclusively merchants and shopkeepers, and never engaged as soldiers; they have also been prevented by every possible means from leaving the country. Yet their decrease has been after the rate of nineteen out of twenty ; what then must have been that of the population liable to serve as soldiers, and to be thinned by warfare. Nor are we to sup pose that those suburbs of Ispahan that are occupied by Jews haveAYNEH KHONEH. 113 shared a better fate ; for the Yahoodia, or Jewish quarter, has now but few houses remaining. Returning homeward by a different route, we passed through the division of the town called Sadutabad or Jesabad, the whole of which we found in ruins, without an inhabitant. The walls were so levelled as to form spaces for fields, some only being left standing to serve as enclosures. From this quarter we proceeded along the river to the palace and gardens of Huft Duss/ or Seven Habitations. These were all intended as the abode of the Shah’s wives and family, during his residence, for the transaction of business at the palace of the Ayneh Khoneh, or Hall of Looking-glasses, which is situated in gardens adjacent to the Huft Duss. The last-mentioned palace is constructed expressly for the habitation of women; its windows being all toward the interior garden, except a few which face the river, on the banks of which it is built. The rooms are of the same descrip tion with those of all the king’s residences, as they front inward toward the garden. In the middle of one front there was a hum- maum or hot bath, which appeared to me the most complete of any that I had seen. I was tempted to take a plan and section of it, in order to show the labour and attention bestowed in Persia on this most essential convenience and luxury. The Ayneh Khoneh was evidently built on the same plan as the Cheyl Sittoon, but on rather a smaller scale. Like that, it is com posed of an open hall supported by pillars, the four central ones resting on figures of lions; a tank in the centre; a small enclosed room behind, having also a tank; and behind that a sitting-room, the walls of which are covered with paintings. Here Shah Abbas and his friends are represented, in compartments, in convivial intercourse with their favourite female slaves, Georgians, or as we call them, Circassians. The terraced roofs of the Huft Duss command, certainly, the best views of Ispahan. That towards the east is bounded by a range of mountains six miles distant; below them is the town, extending to the line of the horizon ; in the middle ground is the handsome Q114 MEYDAUN SHAH. bridge, adjoining the Chaur Bang, by which we entered the city ; approaching the fore-ground is the river running to the left of the palace of the Ayneh Khoneh, which is the nearest object on the right. The fore-ground is occupied by the railing and terrace of the Huft Duss. To the northward is seen the mosque of the Meydaun Shah, en veloped by minarets and garden trees ; this view is terminated oy a very high mountain covered with snow, about fifteen miles distant; but a fore-ground is wanting to render this a subject for painting. The view to the westward includes two bridges, the nearest of small dimensions, and situated close below the buildings; the further one is that of thirty-three arches, already described. Over it are seen domes of the mosque of Madre Shah, trees of gardens, masses of the houses of Ispahan and Joolfa, with another rugged mountain in the distance. From this delightful spot I again passed through, or rather crossed the Chaur Baug, one of the gardens of which was contiguous to those of the Ayneh Khoneh; the whole way through them was very strongly perfumed by roses which grow here in such profusion, that the beggars collect and offer them to strangers as a means of attracting notice and relief. How different an interest would these elegant public walks excite if they were the avenues to the capital of a Christian country, where the presence of the fair sex enhances and refines every enjoyment! How much more cheerful would appear the seats under the arcades, and with what superior gladness would the roses and jessamines, and even the shade of the trees, be hailed, if they contributed to the recreation of females, for whose taste they seem peculiarly adapted. It may here be allowable to introduce some remarks on the general character of the public buildings. Halls of audience are approached by long avenues to the right and left of shallow tanks, with foun tains, which are in front; the edifice, by this kind of approach, is rendered more conspicuous. The roads to the entrance of the gar den are for many hundred yards bounded by walls twelve feet high,PUBLIC BUILDINGS. 115 having arcades, where, on ceremonial visits, the retinue place themselves, and add greatly to the appearance of state: on some occasions these arcades, which are continued along the enclosure of the gardens, are filled with attendants, who here remain in some degree under cover. All buildings intended for simple residences, and not for state, exhibit merely dead walls on the exterior ; the rooms are open on the interior side towards the garden, in which fountains and tanks are always conspicuous: the apartments in general consist of a sitting-hall, surrounded by many smaller rooms of the same kind for females; their bed-chambers being in rows behind the apartments now described as fronting inward, and having that side open. These sleeping-rooms are therefore between the exterior wall and the inner apartments, and are lighted through perforated domes, with which all rooms are covered. The perforations generally consist of thick coloured glass. This arrangement of admitting light from above, is adapted to the hummaums, and to every private apartment. The hummaums and rooms leading to them are all heated by flues; those for the hot bath being nearest and directly over the fire, and the rest, in succession, proportionably less exposed to its effects. The flues are arched with brick, and the rooms over them are floored with stone: the former pass round the tanks ; and every room appears nearly air-tight, its doors being generally doubled by a turn in the passage. The practice of immuring and of veiling women in society has occasioned a dreariness of aspect in the towns of Persia. All the streets present lines of high dead walls; and what a European would call a house is not to be seen. The great people attach gardens to their houses, to obviate any necessity for their women to go out. Every thing to a stranger appears dull and filthy: the want of cleanliness observable in the middle class of men is no doubt occa sioned by neglect of their persons, in consequence of there not being that stimulus to please which the presence of ladies in public q 2116 TOMBS. excites, and there being, hence, no favourable regard to cultivate., Through these usages, unsocial in every respect, the cities and towns are necessarily enlarged: they cover an amazing extent of ground, and yet they contain comparatively but few inhabitants. In consequence, too, of the oppressive means used by the govern ment for the extortion of money, all persons avoid making any external show of affluence, and strive to conceal their property - rather than display it; and thus every thing in their towns assumes an air of melancholy and forlorn wretchedness. In short, any gen tleman arriving at Ispahan without any means of introduction which might enable him to visit the interior of the houses, would declare that it was merely a large space of ground covered by dead walls and ruins, having a few wretched inhabitants, among whom there appeared to live some old beggarly females. May 20 th.—In consequence of an earnest invitation we waited on the Governor, Nizam ed Dowla, at his house; he sent his nephew to conduct us, and the interview took place without any state. After telling us how much he was our friend, with other compliments, and asking some questions respecting England and our journey, he ended by requesting our company at his house to dinner in the evening. He gave this invitation on hearing that it was our determination to set out from Ispahan next day. After this morning visit, we went to see what I understood to be the tomb of a Jew named Ishahua, the son of Zechariah. At least it was so denominated to me by a Jewish rabbi, who added that it had been taken possession of by the Mahomedans, who now paid their devotions here as if the tomb contained a saint of their own. We viewed it, and found that the soft calcareous stone with which the tomb had been subsequently covered, bore a date fixing the period of its erection an hundred and nineteen years ago. The oldest of the priests told us, on enquiry, that it was known to have been in that place long before the Imaum Zada Ishmael ordered that his remains should be buried in an adjoining apartment, in consideration of the acknowledged sanctity of the place. I now determined uponTOMBS. 117 a closer examination of this last-mentioned tomb, and I had there fore to soften the prejudices entertained by the Mussulman devotees against these visits of strangers to their tombs, by the usual pretext of an offering to the shrine. I found the tomb a very ancient and highly finished piece of workmanship; it was five feet high, and the covering was all of stone, inscribed with passages from the Koraun in the Arabic character. There were similar inscriptions in relief on the stone tomb of Ishahua, in the middle of which was some writing in Mustaleeh characters. Around this there are many other tombs ; and such is the reputed sanctity of the place that the bodies of three or four Surdars, recently deceased, were here deposited until they could be removed to other sacred receptacles: the smell of these putrid bodies was intolerable. The tomb of Imaum Zada Ishmael is encompassed by a cage or railing ten feet by six, and six feet high, of very ancient workman ship, finished in a style far superior to any thing of the kind I had hitherto seen in Persia. The principal parts of the frame are of wood, inlaid in mosaic, with silver flowers, similar in form to those on the ceilings of Shah Abbas’s palaces, which are probably imitations oi these on the tomb, as the latter structure is upwards of seven hundred years old. Imaum Zada Ishmael was the son of Zeide, the offspring of Hussein, the son of Hussein. Over the tomb was a him hob, (or covering of gold tissue,) with shells of ostrich eggs hung above it, and on the top of the cage were thousands of rags, placed there by devout persons in order to propitiate the favourable intercession of the saint. The railings were all of solid silver. This tomb is beneath the centre of a cupola of excellent workmanship ; the doors and window-frames of the building are of wood inlaid with ivory and silver in mosaic, similar to the frames of the cage which encompasses the tomb. Of the same workmanship are all the folding-doors in the passages leading to the large folding-gates at the entrance into The tomb. These gates are covered with plates of iron and steel, inlaid throughout with very fine gold work in flowers, rectangular figures and compartments filled with monograms, and Arabic chap ters or passages from the Koraun. The large doors fill the arch,118 BAZARS. which is about twelve feet high and eight or ten wide: they open into an area about an hundred feet in diameter, having fountains of stone, with two large and well executed stone basins or vases, the upper edges of which are also encompassed with Arabic inscrip tions in relief, the lower part of the exterior being carved with scrolls and flowers. The vases are about four feet in diameter, and the same in height. Within this area, the floor of which is covered with tomb-stones of various and ancient dates, there is the entrance to a small mosque adjoining. There is another range of buildings to be passed after leaving the area, to which there is an inner and an outer door ; across the latter an iron chain is stretched during the day-time, and it is entirely shut at night. The cupola of Imaum Zada’s tomb is covered with blue enamelled tiles, which may have been subsequently added. On enquiry I was informed that the Cufic character, which resembles the Arabic of the present day, was that which was in use in the time of Mahomed; there being preserved in the principal mosque at Shirauz some hand-writing in that character, in a book of Ali, the nephew of Mahomed. If this character was then in use its origin may have been many centuries antecedent. The immense length of the bazars of Ispahan, with caravanseras on their right and left, may serve to attest the former magnificence of the city. In passing along these bazars we observed shops of all descriptions : those for sherbets and sweetmeats were fitted up in a style of peculiar neatness. There were different streets or rows assigned to different trades: the tailors, cap-makers, &amp;c. were in one; the shoe-makers, sadlers, &amp;c. in another. In one place we observed whole ranges of shops for all kinds of glass and China ware, now in use, among which were glass hooka bottoms in great abundance and variety. A distinct department was appropriated to the sale of carpets, boxes, and other articles necessary in travelling. On the outside of every shop were hung samples and specimens of the article to be had within. There tvas not, however, so great an afflux of people to these places as the extent of the town might lead us to expect.VISIT TO THE NIZAM ED DOWLA. 119 At dark we were conducted by the light of flambeaux to the house of Hajee Mahomed Hussein Khaun, the Nizam ed Dowla, (or Guardian of His Majesty’s riches,) and after the usual ceremonies of taking off shoes, &amp;c. were ushered into an apartment open to an inclosure or garden, with water in it, and a few trees and flowers. We were led to a station near the rather elevated nummud which was to be the seat of the Nizam. One or two persons were in the room, which was lighted up by four candlesticks with glass shades of English manufacture, and four tapers, similar to those used in Roman Catholic churches, each stuck on the point of a copper- tinned candlestick, and placed within a pyramidal screen or shade. These were placed on the carpet that covered the room, on the two long sides of which were nummuds, as also on the short side or upper end, where the Nizam’s place was, and near which we were seated, cross-legged, after the manner of the country. On enquiry, we found that this great personage was gone to prayers. His brother very soon came and sat down near us ; and in about a quarter of an hour afterwards the Nizam made his appear ance, when we immediately rose; he met us and shook us by the hand; he then proceeded to seat himself, but very slowly, as if waiting until we should have taken our seats; but as the etiquette here is, not to sit until your host does, and then to make him a salam or obeisance, with the right hand raised toward the breast while bending forward, we waited until he was seated, and after performing this ceremony resumed our cross-legged position. A conversation then began on different subjects, in the course of which he enquired respecting His Britannic Majesty’s troops, and those of the Company, their numbers in India, the artillery of the English, and how it was served, adverting at the same time to the immense number of guns which His Persian Majesty possessed. On the latter point my only remark was, that so long as His Persian Majesty possessed such myriads of cavalry, a description of force to which the country was peculiarly well suited, his guns could never be required. The Nizam then praised the Persian cavalry, and observed that they would ride120 PERSIAN DINNER. at, and attack an enemy’s gun, without the slightest fear; and to this I assented. He enquired if we had not a great desire to be presented to the King; and (in the court phrase) to touch his feet: I told him we had long hoped to have that honour. Coffee and cullyoons, the Persian smoking implements, were then called for, and brought ; when, continuing the conversation, he expatiated much on the great friendship now cemented between the English and the Persians; adding, that Persia was, in fact, as much ours as England. I remarked, that had we not entertained the same sentiments, we should not have ventured on traversing the country almost alone; to which, as a natural expression of confidence and security, he acquiesced. I then begged leave to present to him, as a specimen of our improve ments in mechanism, one of Bramah’s patent padlocks, which he accepted. After another twenty minutes’ conversation he ordered dinner. It may not be superfluous to describe the ensuing scene in detail. Servants came in, bearing water in basins and ewers, for the guests to wash the right hand: after them came others holding cloths, folded up, on their extended arms; these could not with strict pro priety be called the table linen, as the repast was to be taken on the floor. They opened and spread them along the nummuds; each cloth, which was of printed calico or chintz, was of the length of the side of the room on which it was placed, and about four feet wide: it was printed with sentences of the Koraun, at regular distances of about three feet, contrived thus, apparently, that a sentence might occur nearly opposite to each guest. They are generally of a com plimentary nature, and bear some allusion to the usages of hospitality. The ground of the chintz, in which these sentences are thus intro duced in compartments, is of a running pattern of flowers. After the cloths had been laid, bread was brought in copper trays: it is in the form of soft cakes like crumpets, one of which was laid on the cloth, to serve as a plate, before each person, of whom by this time ten or twelve more had arrived, and had taken their seats, after being saluted with the usual bismillah, or welcome, from the Nizam. ThereDINNER DESCRIBED. 121 o 5 the ice actually floating in them. To each bowl there was a very a ISas Iiei| light and flexible spoon, of pear-tree wood, highly and curiously carved; and from these I perceived the Persians each sipped a little from the sherbet before him, as if to taste whether it suited his palate. These trays bearing the bowls were suffered to remain, and other trays were brought and placed as near to us as was conveniently possible, bearing pillawed fowls, with rice, eggs, and curries, sweet meats and vegetables, dressed with eggs like omelette, except that the vegetables predominated. To us, as strangers, plates were given, ;be the ensuing scene it an&lt; ^ our owri knives and forks w T ere brought.

Whatever they took thence, whether rice, meat, or other eatable, they placed on the cake of bread, eating from it with the help of the right hand only, and occasionally breaking pieces from the cake. There were cups of melted butter on the trays, in which the guests dipped their fingers, and thence dropped the liquid over their meats or rice, drinking from either of the sherbets when and how they pleased. ^ pattern of flo'® wi th pillaw, and gave us some of his bread, a mark of distinction ^ in copper if ;[ which might well have been dispensed with, but which it did not be- , R122 GUESTS. were globular basins to contain the mouth-rinsings, having a flat cover on them full of holes; no towels or napkins were brought, and each person used his own handkerchief. After all had been removed, the conversation was resumed; the cullyoons were again brought, and after some time sweet tea was handed round, without milk. About half-past nine we retired, every one appearing extremely sleepy, and actually dozing. JVly knees were so painful, in consequence of sitting so long in a posture to which I was unaccustomed, that I could with difficulty get up and walk: in stooping to pick up my hat, I had nearly fallen. We were conducted home by the light of a long paper lanthorn, of that kind which folds down into a flat circular form. We retired to rest, extremely glad that the ceremony was over. On taking leave of the Nizam, I had asked if there was any thing which I could do for him in England; when he observed, that I must be aware that in Persia glass bottles and china-ware were al ready made, but of inferior quality; and he was anxious that I should engage for him a glass-manufacturer and a porcelain-manufacturer, to settle at Ispahan; adding, that he would treat them as well as they could expect. I promised him that I would attend to his request, on my arrival in London. It is not necessary to particularise all the guests who were of the Nizam’s party. Next to him sat his youngest son, Ebrahim Khaun, a lad of about eleven or twelve years of age, who is already betrothed to one of the King’s daughters. His elder brother, Ramazoon Khaun, sat next to his uncle, the Nizam’s brother. Ramazoon is a young man, about nineteen or twenty, of no very intelligent mien. In general, the children of Asiatics, at the age of eight or nine, are far more sprightly and intelligent, as children, than men and women of riper years are in respect to their age. The females in Persia, when past their twentieth year, soon become large-featured, harsh, and haggard; this at least was the case with the few, perhaps fifty or sixty, whom I had an opportunity of seeing, during my route through Persia. The young men are, many of them, well made, with ratherPRICES OF COMMODITIES. 123 handsome manly features; the old men in general look well, and their appearance becomes somewhat more impressive, in consequence of the practice that prevails of imparting a black colour to their beards and hair. The skin of their hands appears in general to be much darker than that of the face, probably from the henna with which they frequently dye them when young. The following are the prices of various articles at Ispahan; the maund of 71 lbs. English being the integer of weight for most com modities, even for grass and chopped straw. Rice sells at 3r rupees per maund; candles at 131; soft sugar one rupee per pound; mutton, 2^. rupees per maund; milk, 1 rupee for seven quarts; eggs, 40 for one rupee; chopped straw, | rupee per maund; green grass, 31 pice (of 52 to the rupee) per maund; wood for one day’s fuel, 1 rupee; grass for two horses per day, 11 rupee; barley, 1 rupee per maund. The monthly wages of a horsekeeper in travelling are twenty rupees; for a cook and servant, the same; the hire of a mule hence to Tabriz is sixty rupees; to Shirauz, thirty; to Tehraun, thirty-two. The keep of a mule, whether halting or on march, engaged by the month, is rated at 14 rupee per day. The price of a middling mule for baggage, with chain, pins, &amp;c., is 240 rupees; that of a Yahoo horse, for riding or baggage, with saddle, is 100 rupees. A good mule, for travelling or riding on, may be had at from 320 to 800 rupees, including furniture. It ought to be noticed, that mules and horses are cheapest at Kau- zeroon, and in its vicinity. The traveller should also be apprised, that as Armenians are not so much respected as Mussulmans, although more likely to further the interests of a Christian, it is advisable to engage a Mussulman as head man, and to select the cook, and all other servants, from among the Armenians. Every article which is of the produce of Iraun or Persia is to be purchased at Ispahan, the bazars here being some miles in extent, and presenting the greatest possible variety of goods, such as carpets, cullumdoons or pen-cases, books and paintings, hookas or cullyoons, native dresses, horse-furni ture, copper utensils, cutlery, drugs, confectionery, &amp;c. r 2GRATUITIES TO SERVANTS. 124 Donations are expected by every servant bringing victuals, sweet meats, or other presents from the Persians; gratuities are also looked for by all palace door-keepers, gardeners, or persons having charge of any garden in which a stranger may happen to reside. We gave two rupees to each of the keepers who shewed us the palaces and gardens; and we each paid at the rate ot one rupee per day for our residence to the keeper of the palace. Although we had entered into a written agreement with our mule-driver for seven mules, at one rupee per day each, for two months, he took occasion, at Ispahan, to plead the impossibility of fulfilling his engagement on those terms, on account of the great scarcity of provision and grain which prevailed there, and throughout the country. So extreme, indeed, was the pressure of want, that the Nizam, as we were informed, had confined upwards of 2,000 of the poor people, in order to prevent them from leaving the district alto gether ; and allowed a small daily pittance of money to each indivi dual, that would just serve to keep him alive, in a famishing state. Many poor persons who, having women and children dependent upon them, cannot be subjected to this confinement, and at the same time are, by this circumstance, less able to migrate, go daily into the fields, and dig up the roots of weeds and thistles, which they carry home and cook for food. In consequence, therefore, of the above repre sentation of our muleteer, we voluntarily gave him an additional half rupee per day for each mule, to commence from the day on which we entered Ispahan, and to continue until grain should be reduced to the price which it bore on our departure from Shirauz, at which place he had made this agreement, knowing of the scarcity. Our ex penses are thus increased to twenty-two rupees per day, or eleven rupees each. There seemed some hardship in this advance on the original terms, yet we chose to accede to it, rather than cancel the agreement; be cause it would have been impossible to procure mules at Ispahan, since they had been all sent away to other districts, for the sake of forage. Although this was the season of spring, no grasses of anyPREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY. 125 ;ittei1 dement H P ee P er k eacli, f r °pUtlieiiiipo S 8 i| ls i on account of tie ? ^UtWejandtluoDft ^ pressure of want, li; W upwards of 2 , 1 | trom leaving the diste: kind were procurable, and the horses and cattle were fed either on chopped straw, or green barley, wheat, or lucerne.

Before our departure, we deducted the sums expended from the amount of the bill brought by us from Shirauz on Coja Goolistoon, an Armenian merchant, and took from him bills for a small sum on Tehraun, and the remainder due to us in bills on Tabriz.

May, 21 st.—We quitted our residence in Ispahan at three in the afternoon and passed under cover, through more than two miles in length, of bazar, before we reached the gate of the inner wall. At this place, the native inhabitants are detained and are not allowed to quit the city without permission from the Khaun; unless with Europeans, who, being allowed to take away their servants, may obtain egress for them in that capacity. This prohibition may now be necessary, as vast numbers of the poorer classes would be disposed to quit the city in this time of scarcity. The road from this gate to an outer one, distant about three quar ters of a mile, is lined with gardens. It then leads upon the open plain and becomes very narrow and inconvenient, crossing many brick arches over water-channels, all of them much worn away and nearly in ruins. The surface of the ground is in many places covered with a crust of salt, which adds greatly to the strong glare produced by the light-coloured and dusty soil, and not relieved by the verdureKENAUTS. 127 DCKISG THEIE JCUsf, Kills, nnui-f '^-IHKDOTEOfffiu SUlTtHUCS, in Ispak at tki ijli more than two i j^ate of the inner il letained and are not i m the Khaun; unfe' he awav their semtv&gt; , This prohibition if orer classes would lied® ^ of even a tree or a shrub. Some slight patches of ground are discern ible under cultivation; and on the plain for an extent of more than a mile and a half from the city are the ruins of houses, most likely its former suburbs. A little grass is seen near the edges of the water courses, but not a blade on any other spot. At this period wheat and barley were in the ear, and ripening ; cotton a few inches in height, and melons in long hollow beds just sown. The weather was cloudy with occasional showers attended by lightning. The salt appearance of the soil just noticed, was first observed by us at the swamp which we crossed near Isfurnuck. At the small fortified village of Guez, where we now arrived, the water is brackish. About half a mile beyond it there is an excellent caravansera. Grain and articles of food are here procurable, but no other provender than chopped straw for cattle. Near this place, and on the road, are the remains of houses, and kenauts or water-courses, the water of which is a great accommodation for travellers. These kenauts are aqueducts for conveying water from springs in the hills for miles through the plains to serve for their irrigation, and onward for the supply of towns. The method pursued by the Persians in constructing these aqueducts is, I believe, peculiar to themselves. The water, from the base of the hill in which it springs, is conducted around rising grounds, as far as is practicable in open channels, and then through subterraneous arched channels, formed after the follow ing process. The line of direction having been first marked out, wells of three or four feet in diameter, and of depths varying ac cording to the height of the soil above the waters level, are sunk at distances of twenty or thirty yards; and from the bottom of these cylindrical pits, a narrow arched passage or channel is excavated, about three or four feet in diameter, connecting one well with another throughout the whole line. Where the soil is either saline or of too loose a consistency, the water is conducted through short pipes, round and elliptic, of earthen-ware, joined together by cement. The wells are of course sunk one rather lower than another, so as to allow a very gentle descent of the water to its place of destination. The advantages128 MOORSHA KHORE. of this process are, that the water is accessible throughout the whole line ; that during the hottest weather it is always covered, and there by kept cool; and that its absorption and evaporation, which in this dry soil would near the surface be very considerable, are to a great degree prevented. The direction of the kenaut is easily traced by the small heaps of dry stones and earth of the shape of an inverted tea-saucer, observable round the mouths of the wells. When these aqueducts are carried near a high road, they afford a supply of water easily accessible to travellers by means of a line and bucket, which in this country are purposely carried among the bag gage on a journey. In fact all Persian travellers, on horseback or otherwise, carry with them draught-water either in leathern bottles, or in the skins of goats, kids, &amp;c. Some of them have a bottle and cup attached to their saddles or to those of their servants: these vessels are formed of a metal called bidder, probably zinc, which is not easily fractured, and is deemed more efficacious in keeping water cool than any other substance. May, 22d.—We moved at two in the morning, and arrived at Moorsha Khore soon after nine. The road led mostly over a plain, and was good throughout. At nine miles we noticed a ruined cara- vansera; and at twenty-one miles, after passing some hills we arrived at an excellent one called Madre Shah, which is now little used, and has no habitations near it. Here begins a very fine plain extending N. E. eight miles, and N. W. upwards of sixty. At twenty-four and a half miles, was the village of Moorsha Khore, occupying both sides of the road, and about half a mile farther was its caravansera in an excellent state, with abundance of water near it, of superior quality to that of yesterday. The hills situated four or five miles to the left, which bound the plain, appear less connected than the ranges we had before observed, their bases only seeming just in contact, and not crossing as it were one behind the other so as to form what is called a chain. If the Spanish distinction were to be adopted this would be called a sierra, and not a cordillera. Beyond these hills, at the appa- lent distance of about twenty miles, were mountains covered witha % M fcji ers ^J means of ^edamongiji ^Rjonliot^ '^m leaking ^of tliem t ej | to fee of kit ®e &amp;,prol)af)lj 2 Et more efficacious in k morning, anlii oadled mostly ora i’!

This day’s march was a little more enlivened by the appearance of cattle, and of people travelling, mostly unarmed, and of course under no apprehension of thieves. In fact it is but just to observe, that since entering the district of Irauk, governed by Hajee Mahomed Hussein Khaun, we have observed more cultivation, and have found the villages somewhat better peopled than heretofore ; the roads also have presented superior accommodations, having been under his administration repaired and improved. From the top of the caravan- sera I observed large patches of land in a state of culture near the village, which however is itself nearly in ruins, and very greatly de serted. Not a blade of grass could be procured ; chopped straw was one penny per pound, and wheat 1 i rupee per maund. The nights were now cool and very delightful, being at no time chilly. During the day the heat was mitigated by the cloudiness of the atmosphere, and by the breezes from the snowy mountains to the right and left. May 23d. — We marched to the village of So, distant 251 miles. The road continued along the plain, which is nearly level, and about eight miles in breadth, extending N. N. E. and S. S. W. There was an almost imperceptible ascent the whole way. Not a blade of grass was to be seen, the only vegetation consisting in a few lacteous shrubs, from 10 to 16 inches in height, thinly scattered over the surface of the soil. On the hills and mountains not a tree or shrub was visible, nor were there any villages, either inhabited or deserted, to be seen throughout the valley. At nine miles we passed an unfrequented caravansera; and at twenty-one miles a ruined and almost deserted village, on the verge of a deep ravine, watered by a small stream which is traversed, a mile farther, by a bund or dam of masonry. There the road leads over stony heights, and is in many places narrow, and not very good. At 241 miles we came to some little cultivation, and passed along enclosure walls of gardens, having the high lange of hills somewhat less than a mile on our right. At 251 miles we s130 EXCAVATIONS* arrived at a new caravansera, situated about 300 yards on our right, and having on either hand between it and the road a fortification around houses of two stories, which, with their adjacent cultivated grounds and gardens, are situated in a narrow valley, protected from the northerly winds by the steep sides of low hills. On the acclivity of these hills, to the right, the caravansera is built. The gardens appear to be at present neglected, but they are well watered and shel tered, and contain many fruit trees, some of which were now in blos som, and others had very young small fruit on them; as apricots, nectarines, peaches, almonds, apples, cherries, and walnuts. These may be construed as signs of plenty, yet we actually observed two women digging with a knife in a neighbouring field, and eating the roots of weeds that grew there. They turned away their faces, even in that state of misery, to avoid our notice. We saw many other per sons at a greater distance in the act of stooping, as if employed in the same precarious search for food. Here, as at Yezdehkhaust, I ob served excavations in the high bank of a rising ground, but these were of smaller dimensions, and only designed as shelter for the sheep and goats at night, which are not let forth from hence until the sun is high and warm. When the kids and lambs are kept in one flock, and the sheep and goats in another, this appears to be a good arrangement, as the lambs are kept near at hand, and on the best grasses, and the milk of the dams is secured, which is valuable here, and much in use, there being no pasturage fit for cows. During this march we very cer tainly met no more than five or six persons travelling on the road; and the whole tract of the country may without impropriety be term ed a desert. The caravansera of So is a good one, and commands a tolerable supply of articles of food, but we found no grass. The mules, however, for the first time these many days past, were turned out to pasture on the weeds in the neighbouring wild. We had here the advantage of good water. The weather, in consequence of northerly winds was cold, the thermometer never exceeding 58°. We were daily accosted by beggars, but not in such numbers as at Ears. In the evening as we looked toward the fields with a spy-glass, weKOHROOD. 131 observed at least twenty individuals, men, women, and children, some of whom were certainly too young to discriminate what weeds were edible, employed in digging and eating their roots. Some were collecting and storing them in cloths for domestic use. It is hardly possible to conceive a state of society more cheerless, more hopeless, more wretched than this. On enquiry I found that grain, this year, was four times the price that it obtains in common years, and that the wheat harvest would not be completed and housed in less than two months, a period cer tainly very late ; but as the country is elevated, and much exposed to the cold north-west winds that blow over the mountains, on which snow still remains, the backwardness of the season may be naturally accounted for. We were informed that at Kaushoon, only forty miles off in a northerly direction, fruits and grain were already ripe, and gathered. The village of So, is, I find, out of the main road, being at least five miles to the right of it, and on a route by no means so good. The report which 1 heard of the main road was, that it leads through Aga Kemaul Bala, and has good caravanseras, but is destitute of inhabitants. , We procured fruit here, dried and prepared after the manner of the country. They were plums and apricots, from which the stones had been extracted, and walnut kernels substituted, and which after this operation had been dried in the sun, forming together a palatable food. May 24th. — Our march this day was to Kohrood, distant fifteen miles, over a rough and hilly tract of country. Close to the village of So the road is crossed by four or five fine streams flowing from the moun tains to the right, and uniting near the bund or dam already mentioned. The rivulet at that place, however, is said to be far from abundant, the waters being for the most part exhausted in irrigating the whole valley near So. After traversing a range of hills, we descended at about eight miles into a valley, having one solitary house to the westward of the road. This valley is well sheltered by mountains in all directions, s 2 ‘132 ROMANTIC VALLEY. and is watered by very fine streamlets which frequently wind near or cross the road : not more than one-fourth, however, of the ground is cultivated, doubtless through want of inhabitants. At about ten miles is the summit of a pass, which by gentle windings we ascended. The vales between the hills have all streamlets, and are partly clothed with verdure, among which there is some grass. Here I began to observe a change in the stony surface; and for the first time per ceived grey granite, projecting in masses from the hills : those which we had previously seen appeared all of limestone, or sandstone. The descent of the pass for about half a mile was steep, and led toward a confined and low vale between high mountains, the tops of which had snow on them ; the road along the more gentle descent was stony, until we arrived at the village of Kohrood, or, literally, Mountain River, situated at the bottom of the vale. Huge masses of granite were seen projecting abruptly from the declivity of the hills; and on viewing the ranges of mountains it was easy to distin guish the different substances that composed them. The most elevated of these was granite; the body of the mountain was of a greenish neutral tint, with dark and reddish rocks, projecting fre quently in strong light and shade; next below them was a range of acuminated and precipitous mountains of limestone of a lighter colour; the nearer and lower range was more even in its surface, which was of a reddish brown, but covered in many places with weedsj its strongest feature, particularly along the bases of the hills and near the central stream, consisted in the masses of granite already noticed. The mountains nearly joining at their bases, render the appear ance of this valley extremely romantic; and this effect is increased by the rather uncommon view of extensive plantations of noble fruit trees, and of chinaurs and poplars, which are seen along the whole bottom, and to the distance of half a mile up the narrow vales be tween the hills. These, chequered by patches of corn fields in ir rigated terraces, and enlivened by the presence of a large village on the acclivity of a hill protected by a fortification, constitute a land-scape of o ( lorded vf The orcliai streamlets. and to be the fort w s In this s landscapes n present at on as recognizee snow, would tains, covere dure of sprin mountains, v the glaring vegetation, wi while the nea fruit, and by' presence of ai sent in them Id e here p containing tl: process is use' oblong specii apricots, year.

The caravansera at which we put up afforded very wretched accommodation, being ruinous and filthy. The orchards were in a most thriving state, and were all watered by streamlets. The houses of the village appeared to be better built, and to be intermixed with fewer ruins than in other instances ; but the fort was totally neglected, and suffered to fall to decay. In this sheltered spot, and other mountainous parts of Persia, landscapes might be selected, which if faithfully painted, would re present at once the characteristics of all the four seasons of the year, as recognized in Europe. Thus the highest mountain, coveied by snow, would exhibit winter; the next range of rather lower moun tains, covered with light evergreens would indicate the nascent ver dure of spring ; the next inferior range of calcareous and sand-stone mountains, with their naked and precipitous surfaces imbued with the glaring colours of ochre, red, and yellow, and divested of all vegetation, would seem as if parched by the sultry heats of summer; while the nearer ground, diversified by orchards abounding in lipe fruit, and by fields of grain ready for the sickle, would announce the presence of autumn. All this variety do the mountains of Persia pre sent in the month of May. We here procured more of the dried fruits already described, as containing the kernels of walnuts in lieu of the stones. The same process is used in the preparation of moist acid plums, chiefly of the oblong species. Melons, pears, and apples, as well as plums and apricots, are dried in the sun, and preserved from year to year. Our Mehmandaur had directed us to the ruined caravansera, but we found that the place at which travellers generally put up, was about half a mile beyond it; a very pleasant house and garden close on the right of the road, at the farther extremity of the village and clear of its houses. The soil of this place is sandy, the rocks are of granite, sandstone and limestone of different colours, and in the vallies there are strata, of134 GUEBRE-ABAD. amygdaloid, containing a great proportion of limestone. The grain and fruit are in the same state as at So. May 25th. —We set out for Kaushoon, distant 25 miles, at two in the morning. The road at the commencement is extremely confined and stony, leading' between walls and garden inclosures, along the bottom of the valley. Beyond the garden-house, the hills approxi mate, having their summits distant only about 500 or 600 yards from each other, and separated at their bases by only a narrow slip of valley, planted with fruit trees to the distance of more than a mile. After winding along the hills to the left, we came, at four miles, to an old bund or dam of masonry, extending between two hills, and retaining a large expanse of water. Here we descended and passed it, by keeping the stream close on our right the whole way ; it is about thirty feet in height, and has an outlet for the water at the bottom. This pass is at night particularly dangerous, as the rocks are slippery and the road has fallen in some places, and is in others formed only of timber, covered with twigs and earth. The streamlet on flowing from the bund runs near and frequently across the road for seven miles, when it takes a N. E. direction toward some extensive plains. The road here ascends to the remains of a fine caravansera of the time of Shah Abbas, situated on the height, and having a covered tank in front. It may now serve as mere shelter for travellers, but there are no inhabitants in its vicinity. At 71 miles are seen close on the right of the road the ruins of the town of Guebre-abad, a town of the Guebres or fire worshippers, of the date of the cara vansera—about 230 years. Opposite this place the chain of moun tains on the right terminates, that on the left extends a little to the north-westward. We ascended the latter by a winding and very stony path for half a mile. At eight miles is the crown of the ascent, from whence the road leads W. N. W. on a descent of nearly a mile; the hills are backed by granite mountains to the westward, nearly pa rallel to the road; but no hills are to be seen on the right, or N. E. at a shorter distance than thirty miles. It was on the summit of thisBAUG-FIN. 135 pass that I first observed the peak of Demawund beyond Tehraun, the distance of which must be at least 180 miles. That remote mountains are distinctly visible is a circumstance which shows the clearness, or rather dryness of the atmosphere of Persia; this pecu liarity of its climate has been noticed by most travellers, who have written on the subject. From the bottom of the descent the road continues over a stony surface, rendered uneven by the mountain streams from the left, which all flow toward Kaushoon, within three miles of which a rivulet runs on the right of the road, to the cul tivated grounds near the town, and is there apparently distributed in irrigation. From the road is seen on the left or westward, about 31 miles dis tant, a shooting seat, Baug-fin, belonging to His present Majesty; it is situated at the foot of the hills, skirting the mountains, near a spring of fine water, and is surrounded by orchards and gardens having tanks in them. The king, on his annual excursions from Tehraun to visit Ispahan, generally sojourns a few days at this place, which is said to afford a cool and agreeable retreat in these arid plains. On our approach to the town, we observed the barley to be all cut, and the wheat already ripe, a circumstance that has relieved the poor inhabi tants, who only a month before had been obliged to subsist on the roots of weeds, and even devoured horses. According to their ac count ten thousand persons have died through sheer want of food. At 21 miles we arrived at the walls of Kaushoon, having the town gate on our left. The road here turns to the right, and continues on the outer edge of the ditch, which is dry, being merely a deep ex cavation of earth. Having proceeded two miles, we came to the Baugeh Shah (garden of Shah Abbas). During the seven hours that we had been on the road, the glare of the light sandy soil tanned our faces extremely, and was more scorching than that of any tract which I remembered to have traversed in India. At nine in the morning the thermometer was at 98°. The garden of Baugeh Shah is part of four, forming a Chaur-baug on the outer edge of the ditch to the northward of the town, and136 KAUSHOON. ne ar its principal gate. In this warm and sheltered valley? the giain and fruits are ripe nearly a month sooner than in the more elevated and exposed southern districts which we had quitted ; even at So and Kohrood the barley and wheat required two months to bring them to maturity, and the fruit trees were either in blossom, or had only a few green fruits on them. Here on the contrary we purchased abundance of ripe cherries, and of apricots of the small kind, also green gages, melons, and apples nearly ripe. To the south-west of the town are several ranges of hills, the nearest being eight miles distant, and the highest and most remote about twenty. The parts bordering on the plains are composed of amygdaloidal strata ce mented with limestone; then occur angular precipitous masses of yellow and red limestone, and above them rise the peaks of granite, still retaining snow in their hollows. Kaushoon is encompassed by a wall and towers of brick and mud, having in some parts a double wall and fausse-braye. It extends two miles from east to west, and one and a half from north to south. There are several gates, and within its precincts are observable va rious mosques, and cupolas of coloured tiles. A long covered bazar extends from the north gate in a southerly direction to the centre 01 the town. I found here a greater proportion of buildings in good repair, and fewer ruins, than in other Persian towns on the route. In the Chaur-baug are many very old cypresses and firs, the dia meter of the trunks of the former being at most fifteen inches, and that of the latter about twenty or twenty-four. The firs are of a heavy headed kind, having no branches within fifty or sixty feet of the ground. These trees were planted in the reign of Shah Abbas, and are therefore about 230 years old. When we consider the height of the cypresses, we must conclude that they here find a congenial soil, and if planted more extensively might have obviated the general scarcity of wood in Persia. It is less by any physical disadvantages, than by • the baneful influence of despotism, that the growth of timber has been checked; nor is it to be expected that a people whose immediate interests are thwarted by oppression, will entertain that provident re-SEMSIN. 137 gard for the welfare of their posterity, which is one of the efficient motives to plantation. The heat which ripened the fruits, engendered multitudes of flies and musquitoes, which greatly troubled our repose by night. These and other natural effects of a hot climate, induced us to determine on marching by night so long as they existed, in order to obviate as much as possible the numerous inconveniences by which they were attended. Mirza Hussein, the collector subordinate to the Nizam, agreeably to orders transmitted from his master, sent us for breakfast a colla tion of sherbets, sweetmeats, and fruits cooled with ice ; and in the evening for dinner, pillaws accompanied with sherbets, prepared as those of the morning. To return these presents would have been deemed insulting; and this necessity of receiving things often useless to any but our servants, together with that of attending to ceremonial leave-taking visits from persons of distinction, and of making dona tions to all servants sent with victuals, &amp;c. donations seldom ade quate to the expectations they form of a stranger’s munificence ; — these compliances with custom, I say, are not only expensive, but par ticularly wearisome to persons obliged to travel by night, and should, for the sake of personal comfort, be avoided as much as possible. Yet it is unfortunate for a stranger that he should be restrained, by the apprehension of such encroachments on his time and his resources, from cultivating that acquaintance with a people which can alone qualify him for describing their manners and character. May 26th.—At one in the morning we set out for Semsin, distant twenty-two miles, and proceeded by a very pleasant road over a sandy plain. At eleven miles we passed on our right a fine caravansera of the time of Shah Abbas, and a respectable-looking town called Nus- serabad. The hills and mountains were, as before, distant about six miles, and near them, in the valley about four miles from the road, were several small villages. The soil throughout this march was in general salt and sandy, and but scantily watered. There were but few weeds, and not a blade of grass to be seen. The village of Sem-138 PASSAUNGOON. sin is in ruins, and has only a few inhabitants dwelling in small forti fied enclosures, at about a mile’s distance. The caravansera appears to have been recently rebuilt, and is spacious and convenient. The weather began to be hot by seven o’clock, and continued so all day ; not a cloud was to be seen, and the glare was intense. May 27th. — We proceeded to Fassaungoon, distant twenty-four miles and a half. On leaving the caravansera we entered upon a stony road leading by a gentle ascent toward the opening of the hills from N. by W. to N. W. At about five miles we passed through the ruined and deserted village of Deyna situated on the highest ground. At eleven miles we came to the village of Aubshoor (or salt water), consisting of a few inhabited hovels, near which, on the left of the road, was a caravansera. The road here continues over arid stony and sandy plains, along the base of the southern range of mountains dis tant from three to five miles. The country is dry, and divested of all vegetation except a thin scattering of weeds over the brown sur face of the soil. We halted at the caravansera of Passaungoon, which is rather on a small scale, but affords good accommodation. Near it the soil is somewhat more abundant in weeds, from which asses and mules select some aliment. Both before and after crossing the high ground connecting the hills between which we passed, a plain extended on the right as far as the view could command, having a naked and desert aspect. Demawund towering above every other mountain, appeared at sun rise as near to our observation at this place as hills would appear in India at only forty miles’ distance. The white colour of its snow-clad surface was not then perceptible, on account, probably, of the vapour which at that hour overspread the plain, and its shadowed side being presented to us. From this caravansera are seen several deserted villages and enclo sures, one of them of considerable extent about two miles to the north-eastward. As there is but little water on this arid and sandy plain, two small tanks have been sunk near the caravansera and roofed with domes ofORIGIN OF CARAVANSERAS. 139 masonry. They have each an arched portico with stone seats on the sides, and a covered passage leading from it by steps down to the water. In front of the portico is a stone trough for cattle to drink at, which serves also as a barrier to prevent them from descending to the tank. When we contemplate the great expenses which have been and still aiki incurred, for the purpose of providing accommodations for travellers and their cattle, we are led to conclude, that great numbers must have formerly traversed the country. The establishment of so many caravanseras may have originally been called for by the exten sive intercourse and traffic of a populous and flourishing nation ; but however that may be, the continuance of such establishments is now necessary for very different reasons. Such is the miserable and de populated state of Persia at present, that it has not within requisite distances, in the public roads, any of those accommodations for the traveller which most other countries possess; and it very frequently occurred to us, that the caravansera, in which were a poor man and his son, stationed as porters of the place, and subsisting partly by the sale of fresh water, and a few fowls and eggs, constituted the only place of security for a whole stage. Having had frequent opportunities of observing Persians of the poorer class, travelling some with and some without their families, 1 shall here attempt a general description of their mode of life during their journeys. If the man has with him his wife and family, which is but rarely the case, except with those who possess some little pro perty, the wife and children ride on an ass, yaboo-horse, or mule, she and the youngest child being covered up. Beneath the covering are also the provisions and clothes in two bags thrown across the beast s saddle, and over them the bedding with a pillow, or a nummud rolled up ; on these thrown rather far back the rider sits. There are rings and hooks of iron fixed to the saddle, on which various articles are hung, and reach nearly to the ground. These usually consist, first, of a haircloth nose-bag for the beast, containing chopped straw, or chaff. Second, a cylindrical case with a cullyoon, having on its sides pipes for t 2140 PERSIAN TRAVELLERS. the tongs, an iron rod for cleansing the pipes of the cullyoon, and its chillum and tobacco. This case is often painted or covered with carpeting. By the side of the beast walks the man, with a wallet on his back like a knapsack, and bearing a stick knobbed at the lower end; he has generally a child either on his wallet or on his shoulder, and in some instances one also walking by his side. The man is relieved by the woman from the ass, as often as her strength will per mit. At the end of every mile or two, the party sit down on grass or stones, and, in preference, near water. They travel thus by moon light, and in the cool hours of the mornings and evenings. After nine in the forenoon in hot weather, they make a longer halt for the purpose of preparing their victuals, and of eating and sleeping. Having predetermined on some place near water for this purpose, they begin at some distance on their approach to it, to collect dry weeds, sticks, dung of cattle, and other combustibles on and near the road, and thus continue gathering until they arrive at the selected spot. The ass is here unloaded and turned loose, with his saddle on, to pasture on the weeds ; if the place be totally sterile the bag of chop ped straw is attached to his head, he being secured by the long chain fastened to his head-stall, which serves, on the road, both for bridle and whip. The nummud is laid on the evenest spot of ground, in the shade, or behind the wall of a ruin, if there be one, to screen the female from view. The wallet or double bag before mentioned is then opened, the contents of which, if the travellers be not in a state of wretchedness, are, a cup or wooden bowl of sour milk, a quantity of dough worked up the preceding evening with a little leaven tied up in a tanned skin of sheep or goat, with the hair outward. This dough is exposed to the heat of the morning sun or that of the fire to complete its rising. The towa, or flat iron baking utensil, is then unhooked from the saddle. It is of an oval form, about ten inches by five. They place it on the burning fuel to be heated, while pieces of dough are detached from the mass and adapted to the shape of the towa, being about a thumb’s breadth at the edge and thinner inPERSIAN TRAVELLERS. 141 the middle, like a large biscuit. They are wrought to this form by pressure with the fingers, and pricked with the point of a knife. The cake is slowly baked on the plate of iron, but not turned; the upper side being merely held to the embers until it is browned. During this process, sometimes performed by the female, but oftener by the man, one of the party goes to the nearest village to purchase a supply of sour milk, unless there be some of the preceding meal remaining, in which case it is preserved in a leathern bottle hung on the saddle. It is mixed with water, and becomes a very sharp and acid beverage. This, and a proportion of the wheat or barley cakes left of former meals, form the principal part, and generally the whole of their daily nourishment. Sometimes they are so fortunate as to find a few berries or wild sorrel, which serve to quench their thirst on the mountains, or a young thistle. This they dig out of the ground as deep as possible ; the green prickly leaves and the top serve as fodder for the ass ; the remaining part is eaten by themselves. Sometimes they may have had an opportunity in passing through the last town, to add a few luxuries to their store, such as a hard white curd cheese, leaves of sallad, a green melon, a few onions, or at least their top- leaves which they do not reject, some salt, and a few seeds of the poppy; the latter when stuck on the flattened dough before baking, give the bread a soft and pleasant flavour. It is not unworthy of remark, that the practice of strewing bread with poppy-seeds prevails among the Jews in all countries, and seems to be one of the customs which this singular race of men have derived from their Asiatic an cestors. In this minute detail of the travelling arrangements of the poor Persians, we may recognise many circumstances incidentally alluded to in sacred history. It is not likely that habits of life so simple and inartificial, can have deviated much from those of the patriarchs of old. The repose in the open air ; the preparation of bread; the leisurely journeying, and a variety of subordinate circumstances, as sociate intimately with the notions that we gather from Scripture of a way-faring life; and perhaps from some of these solitary groupes in142 PERSIAN COSTUME. the wilds of Arabia or Persia, the painter might derive many inter esting materials for the composition of a “ Flight into Egypt.” If these wanderers are travelling through a district in which they observe the black tents of the Illyauts, they, depending on their hos pitality, go to them, and generally either obtain the present of a small quantity of such food as they want, or are invited with the customary bishmilla or welcome to sit down and eat with them. There are certain articles almost as necessary to a Persian, as a clasp-knife is to an English ploughman or labourer. These are, a flint and steel with amadou, or the fungous substance commonly called German tinder, and cotton match; these implements for ignition are carried together in one of the numerous small bags or purses at tached to the waist of the traveller, who carries also a case-knife for use or defence, stuck in his cummerbund or cloth girdle. The repast of bread and diluted sour milk being ended, they usu ally smoke the cullyoon, and then repose all together on the num- mud; but more frequently the woman and children are placed on it somewhat aloof, so as to be screened from observation, the man and his son lying on the ground. Thus they sleep until the scorching heat of the day is past, when they arise, replace their loads and resume their journey. Persians of all ranks use nearly the same costume ; the rich and affluent make no other distinction in dress than what arises from a finer quality of cloth ; and it is their general maxim at present, to appear in as poor a garb as the mind can condescend to, in order that they may elude the demands of the poorer classes for relief, but principally with a view to exempt themselves as much as possible from the arbitrary and exorbitant requisitions of government. The national dress, then, for the men, consists of a pair of drawers, generally blue, reaching from the waist to below the calf of the leg, over this a shirt of the same colour, open near the right breast, and there fastened with a button and loop, and open also at the sides near the bottom, which reaches to the middle of the thigh. The sleeves are very wide at the shoulders, and descend to the wrists,PERSIAN COSTUME. 143 where they are not tied, but left loose. Over the shirt they wear one and occasionally two coats, which sometimes open by a row of buttons and loops from under the armpits down to the elbow, and always from the elbow to the wrist, and are bound to the waist, either by a kind of belt of worsted girthing, or by a cloth cummerbund, blue and white. On the head is a cap of felt or of sheep-skin, tanned and lined, or, when marching in hot weather, a chintz cap. The shoes are of knit worsted or cotton, with leather soles, lengthened out, and turned up at the point. These shoes reach up to the ankle, and being of an elastic make sit light on the foot, without pinching or occasioning corns. Persons who travel bind a cloth ligature about four inches broad round the ankles, which, they say, prevents them from swelling. The food of the more opulent sort of people when travelling, is chiefly the bread and acid milk already mentioned, with the addition of meat, cut into small pieces of fat and lean, stuck on a thin iron skewer and broiled over the fire. Slices of onion are sometimes in troduced among the fat and lean. This preparation of meat is called Khebaub. As the mutton and lamb of Persia are extremely fine and very fat, exclusive of the tails, which are an entire mass of fat, they are rendered very savoury by this easy and expeditious mode of dressing. Another very savoury dish of the same name is thus prepared: pieces of the fleshy part of mutton or lamb are cut into slices like our chops, which are covered with sliced onions or shalots, and stewed with black pepper ; this is kept for the next day’s march, when the onions are removed, and the meat, fried in a little butter or mutton fat, is eaten with bread or rice. In winter the men wear over their usual clothes, cloaks or jackets of sheep-skin, and have caps of the same material, the wool being kept inside, and the exterior left in its yellow tanned state, or covered by coloured cloths. The sleeves of the cloaks sometimes reach to the wrists, but more commonly terminate at the elbow, the wool being observable only at the edges. Men of the poorer class have jacketsPERSIAN COSTUME. 144 similar in form and size, made of felt, the body and sleeves being of one entire piece. These jackets are generally worn as cloaks, the sleeves hanging loose outside. They have gloves or rather mittens of the same material. Of the dresses of the females I can say but little. They wear drawers like the men, and a chemise with an opening, not on the right side but in front, fastened with buttons; the sleeves have also buttons at the wrist. Their drawers are loose, but worked of dif ferent colours, and tight at the ankle. The upper dress consists of an oblong piece of woollen shawl or linen cloth, folding over the chest and arms, and one corner hanging down behind, to below the knees. There are no doubt other garments, but the whole person is enve loped from head to foot with a long wrapper of chequered cloth, fastened to a coif or cushion on the head, the sides meeting in front, and reaching down to the feet. Suspended from the coif, by two hooks, with chains or strings down each side of the head, is a long strip of white cloth, which covers the face and the junction of the wrapper in front. The part over the eyes is open-worked, and that opposite the mouth has a damp or wet appearance, occasioned by the moisture of the breath. This thin slip of cloth is called roobunda ; it is only kept over the face when the female is within view of strangers, at other times it is laid aside, as well as the wrapper, or, if both are worn, the roobunda is thrown back, and left to hang over one side of the head and shoulder. Both men and women, if travelling, wear high-heeled slippers and boots of red, green, or yellow leather. Ornaments appear to be worn mostly on the head, arms, and wrists. Scarlet seems a favourite colour, particularly for binding or edging other colours, on the part most likely to be seen by strangers, near the ankle. The women studiously avoid exposing any part of the skin; but I perceive that the middling class are fond of carrying their children, particularly if they be fair, to the gardens and walks, where I believe a stranger may notice and admire them without giving offence. The beauty of a child is presumptive evidence of the beauty of its mother; and the ladies of Persia, amidst so muchROOM. 145 seclusion and restraint, are entitled to no small praise for this in genious and logical mode of asserting their claims to admiration. Edging, cord, silk, lace, of different colours, are, I observe, very much worn on the dresses of men, women, and children, both rich and poor. Blue is the prevailing colour of the garments of the middle and labouring classes, both male and female ; these garments are seldom if ever washed, being generally kept on until they are Worn to rags : the women, indeed, are sometimes seen to carry their clothes to a streamlet, where they wash them, and after drying them on the grass, fold them up for future use. May 28.—We this day dispatched a letter to Captain Willock, resident at Tehraun, and marched for Room, distant twelve miles. The road was in general level and good, but the country was desti tute of cultivation, except near the villages. At five miles we crossed a stream running to the right through the enclosures of Laungerood, a half-deserted village ; and at ten miles, another small stream, running also to the right among some cultivated grounds. Here, as on the march of several preceding days, we observed a kind of grass resembling kootch, or couch. In the course of the last two miles, ere we reached the gates of Koom, we crossed several small streams and kenauts for irrigation. Near the walls of this place, on the exterior, there were numerous sepulchral ruins, among which were those of tombs, covered by tiled cupolas, of several sanctified per sonages of remote ages : these are evidences of the ancient conse quence of the town. There was a remarkable ruin of a mosque, of which the gate-way and two minarets are still standing, and are of very antique construction. I observed that many of the domes have the conical, and not the Saracenic arch. On the pinnacles of the highest buildings, and occasionally on those of inferior height, are nests of storks, which are so large that sparrows find room to construct their nests in the cavities and irregular projections on the outside of them. A colony of these little birds invariably establish themselves in the perpendicular side of the stork’s habi tation. We observed one of these large nests on the baudgheer,146 TOMBS AT KOOM. or ventilator, and others on two pillars on the enclosure walls of the tomb of Fautema, the virgin daughter of Imaum Moossa, son of Imaum JafFer. The cupola over this tomb is very conspicuous, being entirely covered with copper gilt. The original structure was erected over the sepulchre by Buggy Baigum, the daughter of Timour Shah. Fautema was the sister of Imaum Raza, whose tomb is at Meshed, in Khorassaun. Pilgrimages, I think, are performed to both these tombs. The gilt cupola was added to this structure about twelve years ago by the reigning monarch. The interior of the tomb and cupola is like that of Imaum Zada Ishmael, already described; but the cage-railing here is all of silver, and the wood pillars are covered with it. Report says that there are consi derable riches in jewels belonging to this sepulchre. It is shown only at night by lamp-light, for the sake of grander effect, and if it is requested to be opened by day, a proportionally greater fee is expected. On the north side of the town and close to the walls is the bed of a river, now dry, its waters being dammed up to the westward, and diverted into numerous channels for irrigation. This river bed is crossed by a stone bridge near the gateway. Seven-eights of the town are now in ruins. Its site is on the same plain as that of Kaushoon, but being more exposed, its harvest is rather later. The wheat required twenty days for its maturity; barley was ripe, and they had begun to cut it. It being about seven in the morning when we approached the gate, we met many of the inhabitants going out with their sickles to reap; each labourer was mounted on an ass, and the troop was accompanied by gleaners, chiefly poor boys and girls, with many children of beggars, who are here a very numerous class. On entering the gate we observed the foundation walls of a new and extensive caravansera, then building. In the bazar there were quantities of fruit to be purchased, chiefly apricots, white mulberries of but little flavour, having the taste of sugar and water, and unripe green gages. Grain, in consequence of the barley harvest, is cheaper,PublLsheA by Longman,,Hurst,R ms, Orme,, &amp; Brown,London May 28,1813.POOLLEH DULLAUH. 147 being only one rupee per shaka or double maund, about two-pence per pound weight. May 29th. — Setting out for Poolleh Dullauh, distant twelve miles, we quitted Room by a gate to the north-westward, and crossed a bridge of masonry, of nine arches, over the river bed before mentioned, about one hundred yards from bank to bank. The stream is said to rise at or near the Zurdeh Koo, or Yellow Moun tain, to the north-west, and ere its arrival at the town walls its waters are drawn off to various parts for irrigation. Turning to the north-east, we crossed, within a mile, many small streams or channels; after which, the road quits the cultivated tract, and leads over a flat, barren, and gravelly soil, bearing no grass nor any vegetation, except the usual weeds. The same good road con tinues along this sterile plain to a bridge of eleven arches, over a salt river, which is a few yards to the southward of the cara- vansera gate of Poolleh Dullauh. The stream comes from the westward, and appears to draw its waters from the barren hills that lie to the north. The bridge is at present in good repair, and the river, which is thirty yards wide, has two feet water. The caravansera of Poolleh Dullauh is in. a bad condition, with but little accommodation ; the three rooms over the gateway are the only ones habitable, and are so merely in hot weather, as their open arches must render them too cold for travellers in winter. Sweetish water is to be had within a mile of this place; but here is neither wood, nor indeed any kind of provender for cattle, except the leaves of reeds. It is even advisable, on this march, to bring water from Room, rather than depend on obtaining any supply upon the road. As it almost always happens that cara- vanseras have arched door-ways and window apertures, without either doors or windows, Europeans would have the means of securing a great degree of comfort, if they carried with them two or three cloth screens, like tent doors, to fasten into the walls with iron pegs, at these places. They would thus prevent inquisitive persons from watching their motions all day, and would be protected from u 2148 HOSE SOOLTAUN. the dust and the intense glare of the sun, which scorches and tans the skin very much. The practice of building caravanseras on arches of brick, and of roofing houses in the same way, has no doubt originated in the scarcity of timber. Throughout the whole country, from forty miles south of Shirauz to the northward of Tehraun, a space extending nearly across the kingdom, scarcely a tree is to be seen, except a few firs and cypresses, as already noticed in the gardens. In this vicinity there was a kiln of burnt tiles, of an elliptic form, designed as tubes for the kenauts, or water-channels. There is not a village in sight of this place, nor was any to be seen on the road, though the country on either hand is an extensive plain. I observed on this route, that the lofty Demawund had, in point of deep colour and defined outline, the same appear ance which a mountain of one-third of the distance would exhibit in India. May 30th.—We proceeded in a north-east direction for the village of Hose Sooltaun, distant twenty-one miles. The road for the first five miles passed over heights and among hills, and at the end of this distance we came to two small wells, or kenauts. Here travellers coming from Koom often halt, in order that they may be enabled to go on to Kenara Gherd in another march, by which one march is saved. The spot has no attraction but the wells, and a few weeds for asses, there being neither shelter nor fuel. The road then leads over a saline plain, leaving here and there hollows of considerable magnitude, white with salt. This desert extends to the village of Zeraun, and to a range of hills in a westerly direction, distant twenty miles; eastward it stretches as far as the eye can see, and is said to reach to Mausila, distant forty miles. Within rather more than a mile of the caravansera of Hose we passed another range of stony heights, which were not saline. The caravansera of Hose is not only small and confined, but very filthy, and fafested with myriads of flies. Here is nothing but water to be had, and even that is scarce at the end of the dryANECDOTE OF THE KING. 149 season. The country around for six miles is so sterile, that it does not produce weeds for asses. A man stationed at the caravansera sells wood, ghee, sour milk, and barley kaw; he procured us a little goat’s milk by sending six miles for it; of course it arrived late in the day, entirely spoiled by the heat. The ghorekhur, or wild ass, is found on the salt plains near this place, and in greater numbers towards Mausila. The amazing speed and spirit of this fine animal renders him a fit object for the chase; and the present King, like his predecessors, occasionally takes the diversion of hunting him, attended by a retinue of horse men with spears, bows and arrows, and fire-arms. We here learned an anecdote of His Majesty which is strongly characteristic of his notions of political economy. Two years ago, the Nizam ed Dowla, formerly spoken of, passing this way in the hot season, found the hoze, or covered tank of water, nearly dry; and though the place was not within his own district, gave orders for the construction of another covered basin, which, together with the former, would ensure travellers a supply of water throughout the year. The work was begun ; the space for the enclosure walls was sunk to the depth of about twenty feet, and stones were collected for commencing a building of about fifty feet in diameter; when it happened that His Majesty passing this way, enquired what work was carrying on. They told him it was a new tank which the Nizam had ordered to be built, on finding that there was not an adequate supply of water for the place during the hot season. The King replied with that exalted dignity and liberality of senti ment for which he has been ever conspicuous, that works of this kind, where nature had not done her duty, should be performed by himself as King, and that they were not proper for a subject, inferring that it belonged solely to the father of his people to supply them with what Providence had withheld. He therefore ordered the work to be suspended: the workmen returned to Ispahaun, where the Nizam employed them in other undertakings not so likely to come within the cognizance of His Majesty, who hitherto has not had150 KENARA GHERD. leisure to realise his excellent intentions. The present season, at least, will pass ere they take effect, and what farther time may elapse it is not easy to calculate. His Majesty, no doubt, deemed it unfitting that his treasurer should lay out any money in his own name, which might perhaps by His Majesty be considered as belong ing to the state. May 31st. — Our ensuing march was to be to the caravansera of Kenara Gherd, distant twenty-five miles. This evening our mule- driver, availing himself of some traditional stories related at the caravansera, respecting bugbears who haunt the desert road onward, lead men astray and destroy them, began to declare that it was dangerous to proceed otherwise than all in a body, and that his mules could not travel this immense march (only twenty-five miles,) over a shocking road, in less time than the whole night. He therefore begged, that instead of letting the mules go in advance as usual, we would set out along with them at night-fall. This mode of suiting his convenience, by attending him and his mules at a slow pace, he had often tried to make us adopt, and sometimes with success. On this occasion I acceded, and did not take any rest, as was customary in the evening. The mule-driver, thus secure of our company, loitered, trifled, and was so long in getting ready, that it Was near ten o’clock ere we set out. The road, which was thoroughly good, led for the first ten miles among barren heights, very often crossing the beds of saline mountain torrents, now nearly dry. At ten miles we ascended a height, and afterwards proceeded over a more level desert, in which at intervals we saw white plains of salt, that appeared like the sea. The moon was at the full, and the night was altogether the pleasantest that I had passed on the road. The bugbears spared all our party, and we arrived in perfect safety at a very large caravansera west of the village of Kenara Gherd, after a march of about seven hours. For the last five miles we had traversed many hills and vales, but the road throughout was broad, much beaten, and very good. On the north side of the caravansera runs a fine rivulet, calledZEEOON. 151 Kunaleh, from a village about twelve fursucks westward, by which it flows, and which is named Kunaleh Rood. Beyond it, at the dis tance of two miles, extending from E. N. E. to W. S. W. about fifteen or twenty miles along the course of the river, is a range of hills, on the plains near which there is an abundance of green grass. Here I had the gratification of again descrying a few black tents and numerous flocks of my old friends, the Illyauts. Beyond the nearer range of rocky hills there is a chain of mountains covered with snow, which rise majestically, and also may be said to have much of the frigid and repelling aspect of majesty : the wind that blows from them made us feel even here their chilling influence. The weather this day was sultry and cloudy: perhaps here, as in India, it has a greater tendency to be so at the period of the spring tides than in the neaps. This circumstance ought always to be taken into account in the diary of a hot country, as greatly influencing the changes of temperature, and in reading such a diary it should, of course, be constantly borne in mind. Kenara Gherd is a straggling and but small village, having many enclosures of gardens, and fine cultivated fields around it. Nature seems, indeed, to have liberally endowed it, but the propitious influence of a benign government would doubtless improve the value of her gifts. On the right of the road, about one mile to the southward, is the small village of Zeeoon, encompassed with cultivation. Observ ing three tents of Illyauts pitched here, I visited them: the inhabitants told me their home was near Shirauz; that they had wandered hither, and that famine had so impoverished them that they had not the means of returning so great a distance. The men were dressed like the Persians, and the women had that peculiar manner of wearing the handkerchief on their heads, which has been already noticed. The faces, chests, hands, and arms of these people were marked with various characters, and figures of flowers, animals, &amp;c. Those on the women’s foreheads were points and lines in fanciful devices, and occasionally slight outlines representing deer.152 DEPARTURE FOR TEHRAUN. Their language was Turkish, and they had a dog to guard the tent. Some of the women, while suckling their children, were em ployed in spinning wool into thread for making the slips of cloth for their tents. From the tent-poles were hung skins full of sour milk, ghee, ubdoo (sour milk diluted with water); on the ground lay carpets, tanned skins, and pack-saddles, for bullocks or asses. All the ropes, as well as the cloth of the tents, were of black hair. June 1st.—We departed for Tehraun, the residence of the King, distant twenty-two miles. After we had crossed the river, which had a channel on each side for irrigation, the road led over a plain of gentle ascent for two miles, when it became steeper: in another mile we had ascended the mountains, and were on their other declivity, where, had it been day-light, we should have been able to discern Tehraun. Having descended, we traversed plains but little cultivated, and crossed three or four streamlets running to the right. At sixteen miles there occurred a branch of road to Raye, and the tomb of Shah Abdool Azeem in its vicinity, but we kept along the left hand road to the town gate of Tehraun. I could not help remarking that there were no houses, or even huts, without the walls ; and not one-tenth of the surrounding plains appeared to be under cultivation, though this town was the abode of royalty.CHAPTER X.

GOVERNMENTS HELD BY THE KING*S SONS. On our arrival near the gate, we were met by Captain Willock and Dr. Campbell, to whom we had written, and who were kind enough to come out to welcome us. We accompanied them to the British residence, a very spacious and pleasant building, fitted up in the European style, with stoves, mahogany tables, chairs, and other elegant furniture. Here were great abundance and variety of new publications, journals, and newspapers from all quarters of the globe. It will easily be imagined with what satis faction we enjoyed this transition, though it would be but mo mentary, from a way of life replete with fatigue, uneasiness, and discomfort, from journies over rugged mountains and desert plains, from lodgings in cheerless caravanseras, to a scene of domestic comfort and recreation so congenial to our national habits. We were shown to a separate suite of rooms which were given up by Captain Willock for our accommodation. As we determined not to make any stay here, Captain Willock sent to apprize the King’s minister that we should wait on him next x154 VISIT TO MEERZA ABUL HUSSEIN KHAUN. day, which we did at seven in the morning. This personage, Meerza Shuffea, the Vizier or Sadur, is a man of slender make with small features, having the mild or smooth manner of speaking of a female more than of a man. He is greatly respected here, and has recently received a letter from the Emperor of Russia, written with his own hand, an honour which our Sovereigns have never deigned to confer on him. What may have been His Imperial Majesty’s object in this condescension, and whether it is likely to be attained, must at present be matter of conjecture. The very high value attached to this economical compliment of the Emperor by the Persian Minister may be worthy of some consideration, as it evidently shows that a certain degree of political influence may even in Persia, where it could least have been expected, be acquired without ex pense, by a mere act of courtesy. The Vizier lives very unostenta tiously, no doubt from motives of personal policy. After retiring from our visit to Meerza Shuflea, we proceeded to the residence of Meerza Abul Hussein Khaun, the gentleman who lately returned from Russia as ambassador, and who was formerly in England in that capacity. We found him a most affable and well- bred man : in his manners there was an acquired freedom of address, and a friendly ease in his conversation, much of which he owed to his residence in Europe. He is certainly a staunch admirer of the English, of whose liberality he is now enjoying very substantial proofs. He lives in a much more splendid style than the Vizier, has chairs for those English gentlemen who visit him, and shows them every attention. On taking leave of him, he politely pressed us to dine with him; and as Captain Willock on introducing us to the minister had testified our desire of the honour of being introduced to His Per sian Majesty, we did not decline the invitation, being obliged in con sequence of the expected introduction to make a longer stay at Teh- raun than we at first intended. The delay was of the less consequence because we had not yet got our Mehmandaur, and had not seen the public buildings. The hummaums or hot baths were, as objects of curiosity andVISIT TO THE HUMMAUMS. 155 cleanliness, those which first occupied us. After returning and break fasting with the Charge d’affaires, we proceeded to them. They had been previously heated and prepared for the sole reception of our party, which consisted of Captain Willoek, Dr. Campbell, Captain Salter, and myself. As the process pursued in using these baths has not, to my recollection, been detailed, I will attempt to de scribe it. We first descended a flight of steps about ten feet below the street, and turning to our right, entered an apartment somewhat resembling a coffee-room, moderately heated by flues under the stone floor. Along the sides of the room there were carpets spread on masonry raised two feet above the floor to serve for seats. The light was admitted to the room through a cupola perforated by holes of different ornamental shapes, in which were inserted pieces of glass of various colours, and resembling the common bull’s eye glass. Round the room were hung rows of phials of coloured glass, of dif ferent shapes, some like tassels: perhaps some of these glasses might serve as lamps to be lighted up at night. In a place like the bar of a coffee-room, occupying the middle of that side of the room in which were the doors, stood one of the attendants with sherbets and cul- lyoons. He furnished each of us with a piece of coloured cloth, eight or nine feet long, by three broad, which on undressing and before taking off our lower garments we fastened round our waist, and then finished undressing. Thus equipped in our bathing garb, we followed one by one to the inner room or bath, on entering which I felt a degree of heat that made me apprehensive of fainting for want of air, and I feared I should not be able to remain ; but, on proceeding very slowly, encouraged by my companions who had been accustomed to it, I found the temperature more tolerable. I went up to a man who stood near the tank of hot water, and he poured over me two or three buckets of it, just so warm as not to give pain, and then threw a quantity on one of the cloths for sitting upon, of which there were four, spread along the place. I then sat down, as my friends had done on theirs, having near me a bowl of x 2VISIT TO MAHOMED KHAUN ZUMBOORAKCHEE. 157 After our return to the residency, we visited the owner of the hummaum, Mahomed Khaun Zumboorakchee, who is very well disposed towards the English. He is an old man of aifable, pleasing manners. His house was very well finished and ornamented, having some dark red stones of a stellated form, fixed in the centres of the ceilings, which were painted white, with broad borders or mouldings of blue and gold. There were pictures of Europeans in each niche, not very well executed. In the course of a conversation with Dr. Campbell, on various subjects, he informed me that he had himself seen manna on the beeid tree, a species of willow, and that the substance found on the shrub guiwun is the guezungabeen, and not manna. He adverted in the evening to the powerful effects of animal magnetism of which he had been an eye-witness when at St. Petersburg. There came to visit us at the residency two Russian gentlemen, Mr. Maz- erowitch and Mr. Ricard, the former a colonel, who appeared very well bred and affable. We returned their visit on the following day. The streets of Tehraun are in every respect as bad as those of any other town; but it is much better fortified, having a deep but narrow dry ditch with a fausse-braye round the escarpe. The walks have good double gates and bridges, and the environs, regarded in a military point of view, have the advantage of being but little en cumbered with gardens and enclosures. There was stormy weather on the second of June, with rain, thunder and lightning: the aspect of the distant mountains covered with snow had a very fine effect, particularly that of the Demawund, whose summit was enveloped with clouds. After waiting a considerable time in expectation of being called to the presence of His Majesty, we received at two o’clock an inti mation that he could not see us that day. We afterwards heard that His Majesty had just written to the Russian Ambassador, who was then on his way hither from Georgia, desiring to be informed whe ther he wished to come to Tehraun or be received at Sooltauneea,158 INTRODUCTION TO THE KING DELAYED. where the King is annually accustomed to take up his residence about the end of June, for the hot season. Sooltauneea is situated nearly half way to Tabriz, and is so much the nearer to the Russian frontier. It is evident, from the conversation of the Persians, that they wish it to appear that the Russians have ultimate views on India or Turkey. They say that the Russian Ambassador, in a conference with one of the chiefs who met him, hinted that he wanted a warmer country, and one that was rich and fertile, with other remarks of simi lar tendency. The Russian party say that their emperor has a million of men in arms, and that, leaving 200,000 on the European frontier, he has 800,000 quite disposable, for the attainment of any object that he may contemplate. They add that his views are perfectly pacific, or he would adopt very different measures to realize them. June 5th. — Some deviations from established usage, in the mode of our visiting the King having been required by the Minister, which Captain Willock did not approve of, a delay arose that seemed of uncertain duration, and we applied for leave to depart, with the royal order for a mehmandaur to attend us, &amp;c. &amp;c. This order, we hourly expected to receive, but at the same time considered it pro bable that by testifying our anxiety to depart, we should accomplish our other object, and be allowed to go into His Majesty’s presence, according to the etiquette observed with regard to British officers. Yesterday, (June 4th,) the Russian gentlemen were invited to dine with Captain Willock, and our party at table consisted of seven ; four English officers, two Russian, and one Georgian. After an elegant repast, healths were drank to the King of England, the Emperor of Russia, the Prince Regent, and other potentates; and the evening was passed in that harmony and reciprocal good will which became the occasion and the place. In the course of the evening we rode out to view the only places of consequence near the town. The first we visited were the Ne- gauristoon gardens belonging to the king. In the middle was a tank of an octagonal form, with a small fountain playing in the4 PICTURES. 159 centre of it, from which flowed a stream of water down the whole garden. We were unexpectedly amused with the warblings of nu merous nightingales among the trees, and accounted for this cir cumstance by the denuded state of the country around, which obliged them to lesoit to these coverts as their only shelter. We proceeded from this to another garden of the same description, and at the end of it, enteied the Amarut or palace, of which the hall of audience was decorated with paintings on the walls of three of its sides, the fourth being open. They were whole length portraits; the centre one represented His Majesty sitting on his throne, and his elder sons standing to the right and left. In another picture, the King his swords, bows, and arrows. On the two long sides of the room were painted about fifty figures in two rows on each side. That to all of very recent date, and certainly do the artist very great credit. Malcolm, and Mr. Strachey : the last subject they had endeavoured to make as handsome as they could, from recollection, and had succeeded in their own way, by giving him the face of an arch intriguing woman. With these gentlemen are represented several of the Persian ministers, and people of distinction in the present court. The drapery, costume, and ornaments in this as well as in all the pictures were skilfully executed and were well deserving of attention. The buildings themselves, however, like every similar production of the present day in Persia, are so slightly and flimsily constructed that they already seem to be verging on a state of decay. was seen attended by five or six of his favourite servants, bearing lister,i General Malcolm, Sir Harford Jones, and Sir Gore Ouseley. On isetkseemeli the opposite side were portraits of three French Ambassadors whose ®t,AW names I now forget. Although these diplomatic personages are exhibited as if piesent at one interview, it must be obvious that in this scene the unity of time has been disregarded, since the periods of each successive embassy occupied some years. The paintings are the right of the King’s portrait represented the British Ambassadors, Briiofk In another room close in front of the tank before mentioned, we m \M\i were shown ful1 length portraits of Sir Harford Jones, General160 TAKHTE KADJER. The next place we visited was the Takhte Kadjer, a palace and gardens on the acclivity of a hill, distant about three miles and a half from the town. In the middle of the gardens, which, like the others, have a broad centre walk, there is an octagonal build ing with open arches surmounted by a cupola, covering a tank and fountain of water; the appearance of this structure at a distance is really most pleasing. After passing it we proceeded through a con tinuation of garden-ground, and then advanced through several gates with walls supporting oval terraces of different heights, the ascent to which is first by covered stairs, and then by two flights of open stairs, leading to the upper terrace, on which extends the fayade of the palace. From this terrace the view of the surrounding country was diversified and extensive; it appeared in every way adapted to the contemplation of majesty. This elevated threshold commanding a prospect so magnificent, led us to anticipate the redoubled satisfaction which might await us on our arrival in the upper rooms of the palace, where, reposing on the luxurious carpets which decorated those royal apartments, we might recover from the fatigue of ascending long flights of stairs, and enjoy a more com manding view of the surrounding country, bounded on one side by mountains, among which rose the lofty Demawund covered by eternal snow, and presenting in another direction the distant ruins of Rais with its venerable antiquities ; in the middle ground of this landscape we might look down, as upon a chart, on the for tified town of Tehraun with its cupolas and gardens, mosques and tombs; other gardens forming a fore ground. But to relish such a scene of contemplative enjoyment, the mind requires to be at peace with itself and all the world, and to be defended from the intrusion of any objects that are associated with ideas of a contrary tendency. Our hopes became clouded on eutering the building, and ere we had reached the summit they gave place to a host of antipathies which embittered all the pleasure that we had promised ourselves from the prospect. Our access to the palace was by a long dark passage, to which the light was scantily admitted by small openings throughDESCRIPTION OF THE PALACE. 161 the thick walls, covered within and without by gratings of iron. The first flight of steps, extremely narrow and dark, reaches to a consi derable height and opens upon the area for the King’s ladies, a kind of inner garden bordered with trees, rose-bushes, and flowers. It is surrounded by ranges of apartments two stories high, so divided that each suite shall admit one family, that is, one of the monarch’s ladies and her children. Within the enclosures are hummaums and other requisite out-offices. There were in the garden several frames of wood, supporting platforms bounded by a low railing; these are of different sizes, but generally twelve feet long and eight wide, and altogether about five feet high from the ground. They are used as bedsteads or couches for the ladies to sleep on in the open air, during the very great heats of June, July, and August; and are so used by those ladies who remain here, when the King with a select party of fifty or sixty of them, goes to reside at Sooltauneea. Among these apartments is an audience-hall adorned with pictures, which commands a very extensive view of the surrounding country, and looks out also upon the gardens below. In order that the ladies may be enabled to see what is going on in the gardens without being themselves observed, the windows have lattice-work of brass or silver, which adds also to their security. We now ascended to a room over these apartments, which was well finished; its doors and the frames of the windows were highly painted and lackered, of a beautiful small pattern, inlaid with ivory and mounted with silver. At the angles of the uppermost building are towers, having loop holes and terraced roofs, so as to be capable of defence. In fact, similar provisions against hostility are observable in the whole structure. All the walls are very high; the corners of the garden are surmounted with towers: the space of garden-ground is divided into two gardens, and the doors that lead from one to the other are all very small, not admitting more than one person to pass at a time; or rather, the communications between the gardens are so planned as to lead by a long passage through two or more narrow doors. The front arches of the building are filled up with masonry ;162 ANECDOTE OF A SHOPKEEPER. the outer doors are covered with plates of iron studded with brass, and the narrow stairs open on the terraces generally by trap-doors. All these and other contrivances for security are so many signs of the dread of insurrection and revolt; they indicate the continual apprehension of domestic foes under which the sovereigns of this wretched country live, and which is so watchful, that if a person of influence even digs a well in the town, he is suspected of a design either to introduce people into it by subterraneous passages, or to undermine the palace. It might seem, that as fear generally begets cruelty, the severest measures would be exercised by the government on all who betrayed any feeling of discontent or disaffection. Yet the utmost freedom is used among the people in their conversations concerning the policy of the state, and the poorest of them will often address, or rather reply to, the Sovereign or Prince with the most fearless insolence. A few days ago His Majesty was going on horseback through the bazars, when a shopkeeper came out and thus addressed him: “ Your Majesty little knows the sufferings of the poor at this u moment; while you are enjoying profusion, we cannot get bread “ to eat: all the grain, the moment it arrives from the country, “ is bought up by monied men, and they, unfortunately for us, “ are men of consequence : it is then locked up, and served out “ for sale only by small and most insufficient quantities at greatly “ enhanced prices. In the name of God, attend to our cries and “ relieve your subjects, who are starving.” The King listened to his complaint, and giving some unsatisfactory answer, rode on, fol lowed by many of his principal people, among whom was his son, Prince Hussein Ally Meerza. The shopkeeper in despair called out, “ God send that the Russians may make themselves masters of this “ country for the relief of the poor.” The Prince, who is commander of the fortified town of Tehraun, heard the man, and as he passed looked at him long and steadfastly, as if to scrutinize his counte nance, and remember it; but no farther notice was taken of the affair. Civil war, that greatest and most fatal scourge of politicalSUMMONS TO THE PALACE. 163 society, still hovers over this abused and devoted country, where no security exists either of person or property; where the apparent tranquillity, or rather silence of the public mind, arises, not from contentment, but from mutual distrust; where the consciousness of dissimulation in one individual inspires him with the dread of it in another; where oppression graduates from rank to rank, and each man becomes the slave of those above him and a despot to those below him; and where selfishness, extinguishing all public spirit, augments the desolating evils of penury and famine. The people, congregated in towns by a communion of wretchedness, are abandoned to it without resource or mitigation ; not a tree, much less a forest, offers its retreat or shelter among the parched and arid wastes around them. Thus circumstanced, it ceases to be matter of surprise that they should be allowed to utter their repinings with impunity, or that they should contemplate invasion as an evil more tolerable than their actual state; wherefore, if the instance here adduced be symptomatic of their general temper, they are hastening to the very crisis of anarchy. We observed that the mountains to the northward were still covered with snow, and they probably remain so more or less throughout the year. The majestic and cloud-capt Demawund towers above them all, and, doubtless, ever retains the livery of winter. This mountain has some pretensions to being considered as the resting-place of Noah’s ark. June 6th.—The King having satisfied his mind as to the mode in which he would receive us, sent early in the morning a summons for us to attend at the palace. At half past nine we proceeded thither, dressed according to the usage of the court on these occasions, that is, in our own full uniforms, but in red cloth boots, and over them high-heeled green slippers. On our arrival we passed through a gate from the town which opened into a plain or square, in front of the ark or fortified palace. This square was encompassed by dwellings for the servants of the household. Having advanced half through it, we turned to the right, over a bridge of wood covered y 2164 DESCRIPTION OE THE PALACE. with earth, that traversed a deep but narrow dry ditch ; and we then entered the gate of the fausse-braye, along which, turning to the left, we rode from three hundred to four hundred yards, hav ing the wall of the fortress or residence on our right, and that of the fausse-braye on our left. Then, turning to the right, round the tower at the angle, we passed through a long double range of shops crowded with people of all descriptions. We pro ceeded thence through a gate in the principal wall, covered with plates of iron having on them sentences of the Koraun inlaid in gold. It was studded with gilt knobs of brass. This second gate opened to a square, with mounted guns in it, around which were apartments for the military men on duty. There was a direct road through the square over another bridge, leading by a covered passage to the garden, at the upper end of which, and fronting the centre, was the hall of audience, resembling in its construc tion that of Shah Abbas, in which we resided at Ispahan. It was lined with mirrors, and had in the midst a throne of marble covered up with cloth, and there were curtains of the same cloth let down before the whole front of the hall, to exclude the dust and the glare of the sun. Along the central avenue of the garden leading to it there was a tank, and a long slip of water, with trees, rose-bushes, and flowers, in the squares on the sides of the path. We advanced, keeping close to the wall on our right, and going round about one-fourth of the square we passed through a gate into another square surrounded by the dwellings of domestics, and having a tank in the midst, opposite which was the sitting apartment of the minister. We approached him, and sat down for about two hours and a half, during which time we conversed with him upon dif ferent subjects. The King, we understood, was then at breakfast with some of his family. As we sat, many of the principal Sirdars came to pay their court to the Sudder, or Minister; and after the lapse of about one hour from our entrance, we observed a servant bringing in this personage s high turban and pelisse of ceremony. This was a cloak of embroidery, or tissue, having a cape and tippetCEREMONIES ON BEING PRESENTED. 165 of brown fur, which covered the shoulders and breast. Having put them on he left us and went to the King. He returned in about twenty minutes. We now observed that the doors leading to His Majesty’s residence were opened, and many well dressed officers and persons of distinction passed into the square, to pay their devoirs to His Majesty, who, as we understood, was seated on his throne to receive them. These visits of ceremony continued for an hour, and the persons on their return took off their robes of state and their high- heeled slippers, and went homewards. This ceremonial is part of their daily duties. Among the persons who sate with the minister, was the King’s physician ; and for a short time we had the master of the ceremonies, Allyar Khaun Kudjer, a very handsome young man, related to the King. This gentleman had on his face several natural beauty-spots of a dark colour and round form, which other courtiers imitated by patches, after the fashion formerly prevalent in Europe, and observ able also in all old portraits of Persian ladies. The minister now arose from his seat; and we followed him, passing first through a door near us on the right of the room we sat in, by which the visi tors were going out. I must here observe, that during our stay with the minister cullyoons were brought for us and the various persons sitting near him, so that part of the time was passed in smoking. Sugar-candy was also handed for those who were selected to eat it, as it was to us. After passing through a narrow passage turning to the left, round the exterior of the room which we quitted, we entered by another small door, into the garden of the King’s private residence. This was an octagonal structure, in the centre of the garden, with walks all round the walls, intersected by others in the direction of the palace. We went up one of these walks, and turning to the left at the end of it proceeded down another near the left hand wall. From this walk on the right we saw the King seated on his throne, in an upper room, open and supported by pillars. When we came to the end of the walk turning toward and fronting the King, we made two low bows,166 AUDIENCE WITH THE KING. as did also the minister, whose motions we observed and repeated ; then advancing to the first cross walk we made another bow; pro ceeding thence until we arrived within about fifty yards of the build ing, we again halted and made two bows. Here we took off and left our slippers, and walked in the cloth boots to another turning and bowed again. We now came to a small door from which a flight of steps led up to the open room. These were covered with blue glazed tiles. At the head of the stairs was the door of the King’s sitting room, on advancing to which, fronting the King, we made two bows rather low, and severally entered the room, keeping close to the wall on the left. When we had taken our stations here we each made a very low bow, and ranged ourselves standing. The King then spoke, addressing us with the wonted welcome of Koosh Amuddee, and proceeded to ask various questions, such as—Had we come from India ? how old were we ? He expressed himself as happy to see us ; declared that he had a particular regard for our nation, and highly valued our friendship. In fact he conversed with both Captain Wil- lock and Dr. Campbell familiarly, enquiring after the former Ambassadors, General Malcolm, Sir Gore Ouseley, and “ Mr. Jennes” (Sir Harford Jones), asking what that most intelligent gentleman was now employed in. The room of state in which we were, was thirty feet by twenty, having walls only at the ends: the long sides being open to the garden, and supported each by two pillars of wood covered with looking-glass, as were also the walls, both above and below the customary belt or border, which projects some inches from the wall, and is continued over the doors. In most other palaces the space above the border is alone covered with looking-glass, the lower part being decorated with paintings. In this apartment the border itself was also of looking-glass, and the ceilings were ornamented and painted with gold flowers and figures on a blue ground; the floor was covered by a carpet. On the end opposite that by which we entered appeared a door and two niches; the door was painted and inlaid in the manner already described, and the niches were filled with glasses of different figures, having a half length portrait in each,DESCRIPTION OF THE THRONE. 167 of either man or woman, in the manner of Chinese paintings on glass, which perhaps they actually were. The throne was a heavy structure of wood, supported by six curved feet, painted and lackered to represent a ground-work of pearls, and inlaid with silver and precious stones. On each foot was a pine-shaped ornament of jewels set in gold and silver. The extent of the throne was about ten feet by eight; the upright cross-piece at the head was of carved work somewhat resembling that of an old-fash ioned bedstead, highly ornamented with silver, gold and stones, surmounted in the centre by a sun of crystal, and on each side a bird of silver and gold. The platform of the throne was elevated about four feet above the carpet, and was surrounded by a railing: the ascent to it was by a flight of three steps, painted and inlaid like the body of the throne to which it was adjoined. At the expiration of about ten minutes a servant entered with a a cullyoon embossed with precious stones; he made a profound salam or obeisance, and ascended the steps of the throne : there he salamed again, and, kneeling on the throne, presented the cullyoon to the King, who smoked a little and then returned it to him, kneeling again to receive it. The servant then descended the steps without turning round, and retired backward, making profound obeisances until he had quitted the room. This ceremony of the cullyoon, which lasted altogether from fifteen to twenty minutes, finished our interview or rather presentation ; and bowing again a£ the same places as on our approach, we withdrew. The King’s dress was of a black shawl, with bunches of pine-shaped crimson flowers; there was a shawl of yellow and crimson stripes round his waist: on his head he had a rather small black wool cap : on the left side, in the shawl waistband, he wore a dagger, the hilt of which projected very con siderably. It was studded with such a profusion of diamonds and rubies as to conceal from sight the gold in which they were set. This Weapon was fastened by a belt of pearls over the shawl-cincture, having at the end a tassel of pearls of the largest size, and this tassel, which was about as large as his hand, the King continued fingering168 ADDRESS OF THE CHARGE D’AFFAIRES. and playing with during most of the time we were in his presence. I did not perceive any other ornament about his dress, but he appeared to wear on each arm, under the outer garment, a buzabund or armlet. The style adopted by the charge d’affaires in addressing the King appeared to me rather too submissive and degrading. He spoke nearly as follows: “ These gentlemen, King of kings, have, all “ their lives, been anxious to touch the dust of Your Majesty’s feet, “ and this day forms a new beginning of their lives ; they look on all “ their past days as nothing, and glory in the honour conferred on them “ by Your Majesty, King of kings.” These fulsome compliments were frequently repeated, and seemed to be taken merely as compliments, continued from regard to ancient usage. The King was very affable ; and though evidently suffering from diseased lungs, for he had a very bad asthmatic cough, he conversed cheerfully. I remarked in his appearance a disposition towards consumption, a bend of the chest, through difficulty of respiration, a peculiar expression in the eyes, and a thinness or sharpness of the features, particularly the edge of the nose. He was of a somewhat handsome person, rather light than muscular or corpulent, and his beard was large and long, though not quite so much so as it is represented in the pictures of him, which have all some resemblance to His Majesty. The number of his children I could not exactly ascertain: it is generally agreed that he has at least sixty boys and sixty girls living, and many persons add that there are an equal number deceased, so that their total number must have been two hundred and forty. He has already given in marriage twelve of his daughters; and about twenty- five of the elder of his sons are governors of the principal provinces and cities of the empire. Preparations of fireworks, &amp;c. were at this time making at the palace, to celebrate the nuptials of one of his sons, which were to take place in about three weeks. This son is called own brother of Abbas Meerza, being born of the same mother. Some of the King’s elder sons, besides their commands of pro vinces and cities, which all of them possess, are in confidential situa tions about his person or household.SONS OF THE KING. 169 The first son is Mahomed Ally Meerza, governor of Kermaunshah. The second, Abbas Meerza, governor of Azerbyejaun, resident at Tabriz. The third, Abdoolah Meerza, governor of Zunjaun. The fourth, Ally Muggeh Meerza, governor of Causween. The fifth, Hoossein Ally Meerza, governor of Shirauz. The sixth, Hassan Ally Meerza, late governor of the city of Tehraun, and now in some other government. The seventh, Mahomed Kooly Meerza, governor of Khorassaun. The eighth, Mahomed Tuckey Meerza, governor of Booroojeerd. The ninth, Hyder Cooly Meerza. The Prince, for whose nuptials preparations were making, is Ally Shah Meerza, now governor of the city of Tehraun, who is to espouse the daughter of Mahomed Ally Khaun Kudjer. This young man is twenty-six years of age, and has already a progeny by several mistresses; but he has not yet been married. The present Monarch appears to be about forty-five years of age 9 and has reigned twenty years.wmm 170 CHAPTER XL KUMAULABAD. — SUFFER KOJA.

June 6th.—Our passports and other documents having been signed, we prepared to depart for Kumaulabad, distant 35 miles. We quit ted the residency at half-past six in the evening and travelled all night, eleven and a half hours. The road, for twenty-six miles, led over a dry stony soil, and crossed many beds of rivulets, now des titute of water, the passage of which was heavy and tedious on account of the loose gravel and sand. Having proceeded thus far, we had the hills close on our right, and here crossed a bridge over a river flowing from those hills and running rapidly to the left. As it was night we could not view the beauties of this romantic spot, which, no doubt, might have afforded a fine subject for delineation. After crossing the bridge we traversed many deep channels for irriga tion, and deviated from the high road, leaving it on our left until we had passed about half a mile beyond the village of Soolemauneea, where we again entered it. The country from hence to Kumaulabad, distant nine miles, consisted chiefly of plains covered by pasturage, in which were many groupes of the black tents of the Illyauts, and also some white tents occupied by servants of the King, whoKUMAULABAD. 171 keeps here 400 or 500 head of cattle, principally horses and mules, to pasture. The village of Kumaulabad is very small, and at present nearly in ruins ; it was with some difficulty that we found a hovel in which to put our beds and table for the day. June 7th.—In consequence of the slow motion of our mules the march last night had been greatly retarded, and it was not until six this morning that we arrived. We observed here abundant cultiva tion, though in rather a backward state ; and there were altogether many more birds than we had seen elsewhere on the route. The vil lage reminded us of those in India, having a due proportion of cows, buffaloes, mules, asses, goats, sheep, dogs, fowls, and other domes tic animals. The plains are copiously watered by streamlets in every direction, some of which being deep and muddy had rather impeded our progress on the road. June 8th.—We set out for Suffer Koja, distant 28 miles, which we reached in ten hours. At six miles we came to Songoorabad, the first post station for horses from Tehraun. The road hither is flat and plain, but intersected by several streams for irrigation. There are hills extending parallel to the road at the distance of eight or ten miles, which are backed by the mountains which form a strong natural boundary to the province of Mesanderaun ; and to the southward there is another but lower range of hills which form the boundary of these fine and most extensive plains in that direction (or to the left), at the distance of twenty-five or thirty miles. On these plains there are extensive patches of cultivated ground, bearing barley and wheat; and a number of small fortified villages are observable to the right and left of the road, and distant from it three or four miles. In the range of mountains that divide this district from the pro vince of Mesanderaun there are only four passes, each about twelve miles in extent, and very difficult for mules and asses j but through them iron and other articles are transported on these beasts of burden from one province to the other. Onward from Songoorabad the road is rather better, and is less intersected by streams. It leads directly past a residence to the z 2m Suffer koja. northward of a garden near Khishlauc, which was built by His Ma jesty as a halting place on his way to Sooltauneea. Our Mehman- daur, however, choose to deviate; and as his horse station was at Suffer Koja, a village about a mile to the left of the road, he took us thither, and thus occasioned a circuit of at least two miles and a half ere we regained the highway, which might have been avoided. We were given to understand that posts of eight, ten or twelve horses, with the like number of men, are stationed at regular dis tances of from 24 to 32 miles, from Tehraun to the Russian frontier. There are stations of this kind at Songoorabad, Suffer Koja, Cas- ween, Siadeeun, Aubhaur, and Sooltauneea, and so on all through the country. Government allows for the maintenance of these establish ments about 300 tomauns or pounds sterling per annum for each post. The duties required from them are to forward expresses, and to furnish from one to eight or ten horses to any messengers, travelling chupper or courier, on government business, or to any other person to whom the regular permission has been officially granted. The messenger or traveller on his arrival at a station leaves his horse and takes another onward; he is accompanied to the next station by a man on foot, who brings back the return-horse to his post. Each station has part of a house assigned for accommodation, the rooms being furnished with carpets, numuds, bedding and pillows. The persons in charge of them dress victuals for the travellers if required, and for these he is to pay, unless the order granted to him specifies that he shall be supplied with food on his journey. The favour of an order for post ing is to be obtained of His Majesty’s ministers : it enables the travel ler to claim the use of a fixed number of horses free of expense ; and the order itself cannot be procured for money, nor is it transferra- ble by purchase. The post horses are in general very serviceable, and this mode of journeying is highly desirable on account of its expedition and ease. A traveller having but little baggage, and being attended by a Mehmandaur, would find no difficulty, I should think, in proceeding through Persia at the rate of two stages, about sixty miles, within the four-and-twenty hours, and thus from station to station. ■ -CASWEEN. 173 June 9th.—Our next march was of ten hours, to Casween, distant thirty miles. At sunset we quitted Suffer Koja, and regaining the highway near the King’s garden wall, proceeded along the plains by a much better road than that of the two preceding days, being harder and less interrupted by streamlets. The range of hills to the northward still continues, but seems to decline towards Casween, or perhaps recedes from it; the distance of the hills from the road appears to be about five miles. There occurred no villages on the line of march, but in the morning we observed several to the left on the plains, which as heretofore abounded in pasturage of weeds, but had little or no grass. In the enclosures near the road we observed the zenjeed or flower ing silver willow in full blow, spreading its odour to a considerable distance around. The smell of the zenjeed blossom is said to have the effect of greatly increasing the passions of females, and on this account men of character are careful to preserve their wives and daughters from its influence; but for some reason or other which requires elucidation, the enclosures of all the villages in this direction contain many of these trees, the leaf of which, and indeed its nature and characteristics resemble those of the willow. The smell of the flower seemed not unlike that of ripe fruit kept in a store-room, sweet and mellow, having withal, when near at hand, a soft scent like that of the henna. The fruit of the tree is like the bear or olive of India ; it is full of farina, and in the midst there is a hard stone resembling that of the date. The town of Casween is surrounded by a mud wall and towers, but it has no ditch. It is of very great extent, and though but thinly peopled, has proportionally a greater number of inhabitants than the towns of Persia in general. All round the walls, to the distance of a mile, there are innumerable fields or orchards of vines and fruit- trees, such as apricots, pistachio nuts, apples, &amp;c. &amp;c. In the town there are many good houses, mosques, tombs and other structures. We were conducted through it, and lodged at the residence of the Khood Khoda, which was certainly an estimable favour, as the mansion was a good one, and the rooms allotted to us were wellCAUTIONS RESPECTING MULETEERS. carpeted and furnished with many conveniences. Some fruits, as the apricot and the white mulberry, were already ripe. The evening was hot and cloudy, with some appearance of rain. June 10th. — We departed for Siadeeun, distant twenty-one miles, leaving Casween at midnight by the nearest gate to the house at which we lodged. We were obliged to make a circuit outside the walls from the north to the southmost angle before we came to the high road. This is an inconvenience which we always expect in towns, in addition to that of being surrounded all day during our halt by idlers, and of having some trifling articles pilfered from us, as well as of suffering greatly from the heat, and being annoyed by flies and mosquitoes. We found the high road good, but sandy, leading for some dis tance through garden-enclosures; it continued very fair and level to Siadeeun. We were informed by our muleteer, whose views in travelling differ from our own, that the road now taken inclines too much to the westward, and is sixteen miles longer than that to the N. W. ; but on enquiry we discovered that the road of which he spoke was only travelled during the extreme heats, and although shorter it led over heights and was by no means so good as that which we had chosen. In general it is necessary to receive with great caution the information of muleteers on any subject in which they can be supposed at all interested, and to consider it merely as deserving further investigation on less equivocal testimony. The two main principles by which they seem to be actuated are, first to travel, when employed during the spring, along the road most abounding in forage, and secondly to go by easy stages, and to journey leisurely, allowing their cattle to take advantage of any pasturage that may present itself, and to trespass, if unobserved, on the cultivated ground to the right and left of the road. They prefer moving by night at once with the party whom they attend, and halting by day. But it is only in the spring that they are anxious for short marches, unless paid by the day. At other seasons they are willing to make very long marches, as their mules are then fed onSIADEEUN. I 175 kaw (chopped straw) and grain. In general, on a march of six fursucks, or about twenty-one miles, a loss of time is to be appre hended as follows ; of night’s rest an hour and a half before setting out, in order to load the cattle and take a cup of coffee, or, what tends to give much greater alertness, strong tea; then the slow pace of mules compared wdth that of riding horses may be considered as occasioning a delay of somewhat more than an hour; thus in a march of the above distance there will be a loss of from 21 - to 3 hours, which may in a great degree be obviated by previous arrangement. Let the mule or horse on which the servant rides, carry the traveller’s bed, packed up in two bags made of carpeting, and with this baggage one or two small cases of tin or copper containing the tea or coffee-pot, with sugar, milk, and a sandwich box, a lamp, flint, and steel. Thus provided, the traveller may stop when and where he pleases, to rest and refresh himself, allowing his servants an opportunity of smoking, which greatly alleviates the fatigue attending long night marches ; and on many occasions he may by only a few minutes’ rest escape that most painful and overpowering sensation of drowsiness, perhaps augmented by the cold air, which combining with anxiety of mind and bodily exhaustion, renders existence for the moment an oppressive and valueless burthen. The village of Siadeeun is at present in decay, but it has many enclosures and gardens of fine fruit-trees, which at a distance give it a respectable appearance. We were accommodated at the Chupper Khoneh, an upper-roomed place, but affording a comfortable shelter. Here were two rooms carpeted, with beds rolled up in the corners ; so that had we travelled, what may be called chupper-post, or as couriers, our beds would have been unnecessary. At this village is a station of eight horses and ten people. About mid-day arrived a Mehmandaur, from Tabriz, who was conducting four Lesguays of distinction, from Daughestaun in Georgia, to the King at Tehraun. We were told that they were going to offer their services to him in the event of a war with the Russians, to whom their tribe are said to bear a kind of hereditary hostility. Another messenger arrived,176 AUBHAUK. bearing letters for the court, who informed us that the Russian Ambassador was to halt at Oojoon, and thence proceed by easy marches to meet His Majesty at Sooltauneea. June 11th. — Our next journey w T as to Aubhaur, distant twenty- eight miles, which occupied us eight hours, ten minutes. We left our chupper khoneh at Siadeeun, at midnight. The road, for the first six miles, led over gentle heights, and then by a very easy slope into a valley. The ground thus far was gravelly, and bore but little vegetation of any kind; but on coming to the centre of the low plain which is about five miles in breadth, we observed a river meandering through it, and a great number of villages, each sur rounded by gardens and cultivated grounds irrigated by kenauts. The fallow land here was not quite so bare of weeds as that near the hills that bounded the plain to the N. E. and S. W. parallel to the road, which continued extremely good until we came to some gardens and enclosures of Sherfabad, belonging to Aubhaur. Here we seemed to deviate from the general direction, and turn to the S. W. into a kind of footpath which led among gardens and enclo sures of cultivation on both sides of the river, which we crossed several times; its bed was 100 yards wide, the water flowing rapidly in several small streams about eighteen inches deep, in a S. E. di rection. At Aubhaur, we were accommodated at a residence belong ing to the Meerza Ismael of Zunjaun, which had excellent and abundant conveniences. The district of Zunjaun extends south-eastward to Pauseh twelve miles; and in the direction of Room, or more southerly to Curwa twelve miles. Zeeabad is four fursucks distant from this place. The barley here is cut, but the wheat requires twenty days to ripen. In the course of a month the natives expect a great deal of rain, for which the husbandmen are now preparing their fields. The practice of the Persian agriculturists is to sow broad-cast, after a shallow ploughing and harrowing, the ground being irrigated and drenched before ploughing. They allow their fields to lie fallow in succession. As there i&amp; in general no deficiency of running water for irrigation,PLANTS. 177 I should think that the adoption of the alternate green and dry crops without fallow, would be of service to the country; but as there is such an extent of ground for culture, perhaps the course now pur sued may be expedient until a change of circumstances shall urge the introduction of the other. I observe that they sow clover under fruit trees, and that it thrives there exceedingly; a fact which may be worth the consideration of some agriculturists in Europe. For lucerne they have fields without trees ; the larkspur here is wild, and highly luxuriant, with fine deep colours. They have also the wild white rose and hollyock, and a variegated wild flower smelling like musk, which retains its odour after being dried and placed in a book. The Zenjeed tree here is very common, and exhales a most fragrant per fume ; the trees have a profusion of scarlet blossoms ; and their leaves of a silvery white hue, form a very good contrast with the other vege tation. In addition to what has been before stated respecting this tree, it may be here observed, that the flowers grow in small bunches like the lilac, of a vermilion colour within, and a silvery white on the outside. It blossoms in June, and therefore exhales its potent fragrance rather later than other flowering shrubs; thus affording a sort of incense to celebrate the return of harvest, and the first gathering of cherries, apricots, and other summer fruits. From its association with these agreeable occasions we may in some degree account for the mysterious effects ascribed to its influence. At this season the Persian ladies are particularly induced to seek the refreshing shade of the garden-trees, where they freely indulge their taste for ripe fruits, which no doubt tend to give a livelier circu lation to the blood, and a more joyous flow to the spirits. Hence, and in consequence of the state of luxurious seclusion and tranquil lity in which they live, they may become more than usually suscep tible of the tender passion ; and as summer has ever been hailed as the peculiar season of love, they may have ascribed to this blossom, which blooms when other flowers are faded, an exclusive and fanci ful charm. The stimulating effects said to be produced by the fra grance of the zenjeed-flower, may therefore be traced generally to A A178 SAINGAULA. more sensible causes — to the influence of the season and of its en joyments, on the ardent temperament and imagination of the Persian fair. I do not mean at all to dispute the excitement of strong and luscious odours ; perhaps on the delicate nerves of females it may be much more evident, and thus they may have been able to trace back the effect to its most obvious cause. The weather, which for some days had been sultry, was now much cooler; and the change is attributable to the north-west winds which blow over mountains that are still clad with a remnant of snow. The country, with the exception of some spots near the villages and rivulets, is destitute of any species of wild tree or large shrub, and the hills, although not so rocky as some which we have passed, are completely bare. At Aubhaur there is a post station of nine horses and four men. June 12th.—Our journey to Saingaula, distant 16 miles, was per formed in five hours twenty minutes. We set out at one in the morning, and through an inadvertency occasioned by the sleepi ness of our Mehmandaur, we took a wrong road, and deviated to the left for about eight miles until we came to a village at the foot of the hills. Here, in consequence of some delay, we remained till day break, when an old man put us on a track which we again mistook, and finding ourselves much too far to the westward we struck across the country in a N. N. E. direction, and after going seven miles we regained the high road on our right, and pursuing it for a mile further, came to the village of Saingaula. Here, by good fortune, we obtained accommodation at the house of Haujee Kudkhoda, where all travellers generally put up. This small village is situated on the left bank of the river already noticed, and the plain or open ing between the ranges of hills is here not more than three miles. The greatest part of that space consists of uplands abounding in forage. Here were numerous herds of cattle and sheep ; and we saw many luxuriant fields of lucerne in different stages of growth, some ap proaching to maturity. Among the grasses we observed much of theFLOUR MILLS. 179 white or Dutch clover. Near the rivulets the herbage was like that of the meadows in England, and the cattle were all in a very thriv ing state. The inhabitants were employed in collecting weeds that had been dried, with which they were loading their asses, that they might be housed for forage to serve in dry weather for horses, asses and mules. There is still a great deficiency of trees and brushwood. Near this village are several small flour mills moved by water, of which the stream is not more than fifteen, or at most eighteen inches broad and six deep. It is brought from afar in a channel about ten or twelve feet higher than the horizontal wheel on which it acts. It descends by a channel formed of a hollowed tree, resting on a sloping stone wall at an inclination of about thirty-five degrees. The wheel turns the upper stone of a mill horizontally by an iron spindle; the stone is thin and about three and a half feet in diameter, having a cavity in the middle to receive the grain. The method of stopping the mill answers to the simplicity of its construction ; the water at the fall is diverted, and the wheel itself is so fixed as to be raised by a lever occasioning a degree of friction that retards it, and lifting at the same time the upper millstone. As the side of the wheel on which the water acts is lowest, the millstones not being perfectly horizontal, an accession of power is no doubt gained ; and on this side the flour falls into a cavity formed in the floor for its reception. The motion of the mill is regulated by increasing the friction by pressure against the wheel from below. The same simplicity of mechanism is observable in the hinges and bolts of the doors. The latter are drawn by a peculiar wooden key, adapted exclusively to them, and the former are pivots cut out of the last plank of the door, which is left thicker at the outer edge for that purpose. These remarks may seem trivial, but it should be recollected that in coun tries where no perceptible progress is made in art, the existing speci mens of it rank among the most authentic and interesting of their antiquities. June 13th.—We marched for Sooltauneea, distant eighteen miles, and reached it in five and a half hours. The road throughout was a a 2180 SOOLTAUNEEA. exceedingly good, having a gentle ascent to the plain of Sooltauneea. We several times crossed the bed of the same river whose course we noticed on the preceding days. The cold in this elevated tract was very sharp, and the wind piercing ; the thermometer not exceeding 36° or 38°. The soil on each side of the road was high, dry, and rather gravelly. Toward the latter part of the march we observed many holes of a particular species of rats, of the size and much of the make of the English squirrel, in whose habits they partici pate to a certain degree, sitting upright with their paws close to their bodies. The tails were bushy and very short; not more than two or three inches. Their colour was uniformly that of the ground they inhabited, a light reddish brown or dun ; and their numbers were very considerable near Sooltauneea, where we did not observe much cul tivation. These vermin make great havoc among the grain and roots. On this march we met several cauflas or droves of mules, asses, camels, and Yahoo horses, all loaded with wheat and grain, proceed ing towards Casween and Ispahan. Others were going for grain to Meeana, from whence the loaded beasts were coming, and where wheat, as we understood, was bought at the rate of twelve Tabriz maunds for a rupee; it was expected to sell at Ispahan at about two maunds for a rupee, leaving apparently a great profit; but it must be considered that the carriage is very dear and the distance great. Within about two miles of our station we left a high road which leads direct to Zunjaun, and does not pass through Sooltauneea. This straggling village is situated on a very fine level plain about twelve miles in breadth, covered by luxuriant weeds and grasses, of which cattle are very fond. Near the village a great deal of lucerne is grown in successive crops. Im mediately on entering the plain we observed an edifice towering above the buildings of the village, which we afterwards found to be the tomb, now nearly in ruins, of the Sooltaun Khoda Bunda Ally. The top of the cupola appeared to be one hundred feet above the level of the streets near it. This most noble monument is doubtless very antient, and it is lamentable to observe that the servants of His pre sent Majesty are destroying a work so venerable, for the sake of theSUMMER RESIDENCE OF THE KING. 181 brick and ornaments which are to be used in building a suite of confined rooms, termed a palace, with an enclosure, or keella (fort) for defence. This dilapidation has been going on for the last seven teen years, so that only a small part of the original building is now in a complete state; but even thus, it forms a magnificent ruin. The central apartment is about sixty feet in diameter and ninety feet in height, being one arched dome. It may be acceptable to give some description of the new summer residence for His present Majesty, the construction of which has led to the dilapidation of this antient fabric. From the road, we entered first the inclosure for security, a mud fort about 100 yards square, having on two opposite sides two gates, one from without, and the other leading into the gardens of the royal residence. The area of the fort is filled with small arched mud hovels eight or ten feet high. From the gate last mentioned, there is an avenue through a double row of willow trees leading to the palace, distant about two hundred yards, to which there is an ascent by a heap of loose ashes, intended perhaps for a mount. The entrance-door is in an octagonal structure, through which there is a passage leading to the haram, or apart ments of the ladies, from which there are private stairs leading to the terraced roof of the principal sitting-room, which is octagonal and surrounded by walls ten feet high, having no door, window, or other outlet. At one angle of the area which encloses it, stands a high pavilion of two stories, of a single room each, about ten feet high and fourteen by ten square, to which, and to a railed terrace covering the whole, there is a staircase, very narrow, and even difficult of access. It opens on the terrace or flat roof by a trap door, so contrived as to be easily defended. This pavilion, with the ornamented railing in the Chinese style, is mostly formed of en amelled tiles removed from the ruins of the tomb ; and it has much the appearance of a prison from without, there being only two win dows visible, and they are in the upper room to the eastward, covered with strong iron gratings, for the security of the select182 HARAM. females who compose His Majesty’s travelling haram. These fa vourites, in the opinion of our Mehmandaur, must be in possession of every earthly enjoyment except liberty. The following is the method he exultingly described to us of transporting these houries from place to place : — On the evening before the departure of His Majesty, they are severally enveloped and secured in white cloth sheets or wrappers, having open work only before the eyes, so that not a particle of the person is visible. In this state they are seated on horses, and conveyed to the next halting-place, surrounded by female attendants and eunuchs, the whole cortege being also en circled by guards. As they move only by night, the delicate com plexions of the ladies are not affected even by the glare of daylight, and their eyes are not shocked by sight of any vulgar object, either of man or beast, except the head of the horse on which they ride, which may perhaps be perceptible through the open-work of their covering in front. The servant of the household who gave us this description, added several particulars respecting their domestic con servation. He pointed out the spot near the door of the sleeping- rooms, in which there is a eunuch on duty, sitting day and night during their residence, and also apartments for several more of these trustworthy wretches near and surrounding the pavilion and the octagonal sitting-room attached to it. He observed with an air of exultation and unaffected solemnity, “ His Majesty is a great King of kings; he has horses and wives without number, and a noble long beard,” placing his hand to his waist as if to describe its length, and raising and moving his head from right to left. He then said, “ I will take you to his picture which is beautiful to behold.” Desiring us to follow him, he unlocked some iron-cased and barred doors, and we descended several arched passages, lighted only by holes from above, into a room for the Monarch’s more do mestic society, in which he sits in familiar converse with his sons and confidants. Here were several paintings. On the wall of the face of the room, fronting the light, was seen His Majesty in the act of spearing a wild ass. The white charger on which he isPAINTINGS. 183 mounted appears painted or dyed red, up to the middle of his body, the tincture terminating in a sort of ornamental border, ac cording to the usual mode for distinguishing the King’s horses, as exhibited in various paintings. The handle of the spear is covered with gold, and some of the attendants with muskets are seen gal lopping after him. In niches on each side-wall to the right and left of this picture are seen portraits of the King’s elder sons, four on each side, placed in the order of their respective seniority, and all richly dressed. The first to the left was Abbas Meerza, next to him was Mahomed Ally Meerza, and in the same order appeared the other six. There was one remarkable, and apparently rather omi nous circumstance in these pictures. The princes on either side are represented with their daggers so placed as to have the handles, and not the points, towards the king. Four of them, therefore, had the dagger on the contrary side to that on which it is usually worn. On enquiry how this deviation from the usual mode of wearing that weapon had originated, I was informed that it was intentionally intro duced, and that this departure from custom was an act of deference to the sacred person of His Majesty, against whom, even in a pic ture, the weapon of no subject, much less that of a son, should be suffered to point even by accident. The artist who executed this work was doubtless so much of a courtier as to be aware that a strict adherence to costume in this particular might have cost him his head. He would avoid being suspected of an intention to even hint that the princes were likely to forestall their inheritance, and to rebel against their sire ; an act, the possibility of which, considering the power and influence possessed by them, may have been obnox ious to the royal jealousy. So wary is the etiquette and homage of this court, that death must not even be spoken of in His Majesty’s presence ; how much more reprehensible then must be any symbol which should indirectly suggest the idea of assassination ? This at tention to minutise strongly evinces the train of thought that prevails among all the Persian officers of state, of which even the lowest servants are aware, and in some degree participate.184 DEPARTURE FROM SOOLTAUNEEA. After we had examined this private apartment, our conductor led us across a little garden, and unlocking other strong gates, showed us a suite of rooms, the middle one of which was considerably ele vated above the rest, and commanded a view of the surrounding country, being open to the north, and supported on that side by only two pillars. In this state apartment it is the custom of His Majesty to show himself to his numerous troops, who are made to pass in order, and at the same time individually to pay their devoirs to him. It is here necessary to observe, that from the first entrance of the apartment to the pavilion before described, each suite rises on a terrace one above the other; and from the highest there is a cor respondent descent to the open hall, where the King reviews his troops and receives their homage. At a distance of from two hun dred to four hundred yards on the plain, we saw two mud-built hovels, the temporary residences of the King’s physician and the treasurer. The whole of this palace, and the buildings which they are now adding to it, are constructed of mud and of bricks brought from the very superb ruins of the tomb already mentioned. The plain on which Soultauneea is situated is twelve miles broad, and is bordered by hills backed by snow-covered mountains. The natural grasses which it produces, to a considerable extent are pre served for the King’s stable establishment, by persons appointed for the purpose, and scarcely any cultivation is allowed. It is near this residence that His Majesty receives the Russian Ambassador. June 14. — Our next march was to Zunjaun, distant 21 miles. The road throughout was very good, leading over gently rising grounds covered with weedy forage, and occasionally intersected by channels for irrigation. At about 12 miles, in a little spring to the left of the road, we found water-cresses in very great perfection, and ate heartily of them. We crossed a rivulet, at seven miles, about fifteen yards wide and four or five feet deep, by an ill constructed bridge of one arch, very steep and high in the middle. It is observ-ZUNJAUN. 185 able that the most elevated part of the‘plain is near Sooltauneea, as the rivers and streams of the tract we are now traversing take a place, the residence of the Shah Zada Abdoola Meerza, has an aspect of superior population and security: the inhabitants are better dressed than those of other towns that we had lately passed. ' We were accommodated at the Mehmaun Khoneh, close on the outside of the east gate, where we obtained abundance of apricots, cherries, gages green and red; and although they were the first fruits of the season, they were so cheap that we had a greater quantity than we could eat for half a rupee, (15dA I had made several enquiries as to the origin of the grand tomb at Sooltauneea, and had been referred to Haj ee Ibrahim, as the most likely person to give me the requisite information. On my arrival June 15th.—We set out for Armaghana, distant 24 miles, (seven hours.) On quitting the Mehmaun Khoneh at one in the morning, several hundred yards, covered temporarily with grass and wood, saw by the light of the lanthorns some watchmen, with each a small oil-lamp burning near him ; their dress and general appearance were beggarly, and their arms a sword or stick. Going out at the opposite gate we passed through the suburbs, and after a little difficulty gained the broad highway, which throughout this march led over different course and flow to the N. W. At fifteen miles we passed Teezee, a fine village to our left, with some cultivated grounds and trees near it. At 21 miles we came to the fort-gate of Zunjaun, situated on a rising ground with suburbs on its exterior. This here I found that he was dead; and thus terminated my hope of ascertaining the date of the edifice. I could not learn that any had been traced except an old inscription said to have been found on a stone in an old caravansera formerly belonging to and near the tomb. we were led through the gate into the town and along a bazar of instead of arches, which extended to the opposite gate. We here high dry ground, scantily covered with weeds and grasses interspersed with stones. We continued among the sides of hills either ascending B B186 ARMAGHANA. or descending throughout the whole twenty-four miles, which, as the road was stony, became a most tiresome march. At nine miles we descended a deep valley and crossed a rivulet flowing to the left; and after traversing the opposite acclivity, passed another, which, in its deep banks bore the marks of occasional floods, and seemed like the bed of a torrent. At twenty miles occurred another of the same description, beyond which we crossed several streamlets for culti vation, of which hitherto we had observed no signs during this march: not a sprinkling of verdure presented itself to relieve the eye in this stony wilderness ; “ the very rats instinctively had quit itat least we saw none of these animals, nor any traces of them as we passed along. Near Armaghana, on the left of the road, there were many fields of wheat and other grain in a backward state. The village appears to be comparatively well-conditioned, and the people are more robust and fairer than those that we had been accustomed to see on the road. The Turkish language, which we found to be spoken more or less throughout the country after we had left Casween, is the only one that is well understood here. The villagers of Armaghana are proud, morose and insolent; they showed no disposition to supply us with bread, milk or wood, and secluded themselves in their keellas or miserable fortifications. This repulsive and unsocial character is common to most of the inhabitants of these lonely regions; it seems to be a consequence of that penurious selfishness which prevails among mankind wher ever nature has distributed her bounties with a stinted hand, or where political circumstances have thwarted and discouraged human exertion. It is a kind of boorish shyness, engendered, perhaps, by pride, shame, and suspicion; it repels every effort at conciliation, and it provokes in a stranger that indignant feeling with which a man tolerates the unmerited contempt of those who are themselves contemptible. Opposition of religion has added virulence to this unsocial disposition. This waste of high stony plain extends to the N. W. as far as the eye can reach, perhaps forty miles, and is bounded by mountainsILLYAUTS. 187 covered with snow. The numerous streams which we had traversed, all running to the left, gave us reason to suppose that there must be a considerable river flowing through the plain, which however is uncultivated and destitute of villages. On its verge we perceived here and there some black tents of the Illyauts; and their retreats, among the recesses of the hills to the westward, parallel to the road, were indicated occasionally by volumes of smoke. We overtook on the road a man and woman of the Illyauts, accompanied by a few sheep and several bullocks, loaded with tent furniture and plattees, slips of thin bamboo or cane. The man was riding a mare, and driving another loaded; the woman rode another horse, having for her seat two bales of carpeting, some bedding, spinning-wheels, and other domestic utensils. The carpeting was perhaps ultimately destined for sale at Armaghana, after the tent cloths, utensils and other articles of burden should have been deposited on the halting ground, where, no doubt, the main body of the tyfa or tribe had by this time established themselves, as the sun was already hot. These two persons, we concluded, had been the last to set out, and were conveying the remainder of the stock to the new encampment. The hills bounding this plain to the southward are about ten or twelve miles distant from our present station, and decline in height to the N. W. The direction of this day’s march was much to northward; perhaps N. N. W. all the way. We found here very good accommodation at the Mehmaun Khoneh, which, like that of the former place, we found ready carpeted. Here is a chupper- station established of six horses and four persons. The horses were so bad as not to be capable of performing the next day’s march. June 16th. — Our next journey was to Aukhund, distant twenty- six miles. We departed at one in the morning, and passing close to the left of the fort, entered the high road about one mile from the village. We had deviated from it to the left about two miles before we arrived at Armaghana, which is distant perhaps half a mile from the direct line of road. We met with much less stony and uneven ground during this day’s march: at three miles occurred an acclivity b b 2188 SINGULAR PHENOMENON. of about one hundred and fifty yards, after which the road was again good. At ten miles we had gained the highest part of a range of hills, which may be termed a pass, though by no means difficult. At this place which was said to be half way from our next halting station, a guard was posted to levy a toll or contribution on all loaded cattle. Here a path diverges to the left, to the village of Daushboolauk about two miles distant. Daushboolauk belongs to the district of Khumseh, which is divided between the governments of Azerbyjaun and Zunjaun. This station forms the boundary of that subdivision. Toward six in the morning, as we were journeying on, it was our fortune to witness a very singular phenomenon. A very cold wind had set in from the N. W., occasioning fogs in particular places along the valleys, rising only a few yards above the wet ground, on account of the cold air which condensed them. On coming to a height which overlooked these vapours, we saw one of them in what appeared a deep chasm or valley before us, into which the road led. Beyond the valley we observed above the fog the tops of high mountains crowned with rocky precipices which seemed as no great distance, and therefore proportionably steep. We were aware that we had a kotul or pass to go over, and had been told that Aukhund was at the top of it on the other side. As we were still by our reckoning ten miles from that place, we dreaded the labour of crossing from the chasm below such a precipitous and extensive chain of moun tains. On descending slowly towards the fog, I perceived a dark object in it which resembled a distant village; but as we advanced it soon changed its aspect and assumed that of a long avenue of trees, which seemed to open out as we approached. My friend and I were both expressing our surprise at finding an avenue of fine trees on a desert where we did not expect to see a village, and on which we had hitherto proceeded for miles without observing any trees, when in a few minutes we found that the view had been illusory and that the nearest objects, in what had seemed the avenue, had the appearance of camels with light burdens, on one of which we remarked a manNOTICE RESPECTING MR. BROWN. 189 mounted. Afterwards, as they cleared the fog, they proved, as we now thought, to be mules laden with bags of grain, and men and boys walking with them. We passed on through the fog, which was very thick, and for a time lost the high road. The wind soon blew off the vapour, and the sun shone very bright, when to our asto nishment this fancied range of mountains was found to be only a bank before us of forty or fifty feet high, over which the road proceeded. We at first concluded that the lofty ridge of mountains we had observed from the eminence was intercepted from view ; but no such range existed within twenty miles of us. The bank was crowned by rocky masses, which seen through the fog, had occa sioned these successive illusions. The day-light now enabled us to perceive that no other objects presented themselves in the adjacent country. I had all the morning observed the fogs stretching along the valleys and leaving the tops of the hills, or mountains, as they then seemed clear ; and during the early part of this march the valleys appeared in the twilight like extensive lakes or tracts of ground covered by snow, a proof of the great density of the vapour. This series of fallacious appearances produced an indescribable effect on the mind, and might to an oriental fancy have suggested the idea of magic. Some time previous to the occurrence, I had been making en quiries of our Mehmandaur, respecting his motives for advising us not to move long after our baggage, or march at any great distance from it. He stated, in general terms, that he gave this advice in consequence of the deserted state of the country, adding that, about twelve days ago, a murder had been committed at a place a few miles farther on the road we were going. This brought to my recollection the murder of Mr. Brown, near the same spot, a year or two since, of which very extraordinary event I was anxious to learn some par ticulars. The Mehmandaur said he remembered the outrage, and observed that Mr. Brown, contrary to the advice of all his friends and of the best informed persons in Tabriz, had refused to take with him a Mehmandaur, though the Prince Abbas Meerza had offered190 NOTICE RESPECTING MR. BROWN. him one to escort him to Khorassaun, whither he said he was going. He farther observed that it had been reported that Mr. Brown had had a battle or quarrel with some travellers on the road, and that he had been killed near a bridge over the river Kizil Oozan, which we should pass on our next day’s march, being situated under the mountain of Kauflaun Ko, then in sight. That river being the boundary of the provinces Irauk and Azurbyjaun, it was not ascer tained within what jurisdiction the murder had been committed, and no traces had as yet been found of the perpetrators. Ac cording to the law of Persia, when any robberies or public injuries are committed in the country, the villages near which they take place are made answerable for them, and their inhabitants are there fore deeply interested in discovering the offenders. The present atrocity, however, was committed far from any village; and, as it should seem, on a kind of neutral ground on the confines of two pro vinces, where the law could not decidedly operate. This evidently shows that travellers in general ought to be extremely cautious in crossing the boundaries even of districts, and much more so in pass ing from one province or country into another. It also shows that a single traveller should, however objectionable may be the expense, take with him in every case a Mehmandaur. This attendant acts as a purveyor and guide; he is an adviser in any emergency; he is an accredited witness in case of any wrong or imposition sus tained ; his presence generally serves to protect a stranger from fraud or violence ; and if not, his experience affords the readiest clue for discovery and redress. In fact, he may be considered, in every respect, as a public friend. The spot where the murder was committed is reputed to be the scene of many extraordinary and supernatural appearances. To a spectator stationed there, and on the road and bridge, Kauflaun Ko seems crowned with a palace and forts, very distinctly visible, but on approaching them they disappear, and only stones and rocks are found in their stead. These illusions, like some of the same kind which we have just noticed, are no doubt occasioned by theGal ft 'ttas ) ( j or mu ismget coriW ® ef lisieputeifo^' it some INSTANCE OF SUPERSTITION. 191 refraction of light through a dense medium: the Persians, unable to trace them to their true cause, are disposed to ascribe them to the agency of supernatural beings. Among a people who believe in necromancy, and who regulate their journeys and most of their transactions in life by the fallacies of judicial astrology, this instance of superstition is by no means a matter of surprise.192 CHAPTER XII.

It has the marks of having been formerly much more extensive, and is now half deserted and in ruins. The accom modation afforded us at the Chupper Khoneh, although endurable by travellers like ourselves, was of the worst kind. The inhabitants appeared poorer and more sordidly dressed than those of other places; the children and women were wandering about in rags; the former in some instances nearly naked. The country presents a succession of hill and dale for twenty miles, and is bounded by the mountains of Kauflaun Ko. There are three good villages within four miles of each other, in a northerly and westerly direction, but the face of the land presents no sign of wood or even shrubs. The price of provisions here is moderate; a half- grown sheep, two rupees and a half; a lamb, one rupee and a quarter; apricots and cherries in sufficient quantity for a desert for two per sons, one-fourth of a rupee; for a horse’s keep, (two feeds of grain and grass,) one rupee per day.CAUFLAS. 193 We were informed that about eight miles from hence, to the N. W. near a vihage called Mamaun, there is a mountain of rock salt. I found a specimen of it in the manger of the cow-house at Auk- hund; it was striated like marble, and perfectly hard ; the smooth ness of its exterior was probably occasioned by its being licked by the cattle. If we had reason to complain of our accommodations on entering upon them, we had still greater reason for disgust ere we quitted them. The house was infested by myriads of voracious bugs, which invaded and kept possession of our bedding and coverino 1 of everv kind. * ^ The muleteer on this march gave us a great deal of trouble, and positively refused to allow his mules to go along with us, alleging that we went too fast, and that he must keep them with other mules of his own that formed part of a caufla that was fol lowing at some distance. We knew not of this, nor expected any such appendage to our train when we agreed with him at Tehraun. By dint of strong measures we succeeded in bringing on our mules in a body, and he accompanied them this day j but he contrived to take us out of the road, and cause us to lose an hour or more on our march. in fact, when we regained the high road, his other mules with the caufla weie in sight; and no doubt this deviation was puiposely brought about, like that at Saingaula, that we might be forced to go his pace, and that his other mules might be kept near us. Thus by hindering and annoying us as much as possible, he enabled his cattle to feed leisurely while we were crossing the country without a road. Here, as in other cases, the presence and service of a mehmandaur were essentially useful in compelling the muleteei to perform his agreement, which, by an indispensable precaution, had been made as specific as possible, and committed to writing. June 17th. In proceeding to Mean a, distant twenty-four miles, we were urged, by both the mehmandaur and the muleteer,, to move at dusk ; but knowing the distance we refused. They declared thatCAMELS. 194 the road was over mountains, and extremely bad; and now as we feared a repetition of the trick of missing the right way, we pro cured a guide from the village. It was most fortunate that we did so, for the road proved to be very intricate, and was intersected in every direction by others. For the first five miles it was over hills and rather bad, but afterwards it passed along a regular declivity, increasing as it descended to the river Kizil Oozan. The latter part of the road was rather dangerous, having precipices on the right for three quarters of a mile. The soil after the first few miles was light coloured and soft, like loose sand, but it was not deep, and bore hardly a blade of vegetation ; perhaps it was impregnated with salt. We met many camels laden with grain; the drivers of them mostly asleep on the loads, covered by sheepskin cloaks, and hardly distin guishable from a bundle of sheepskins, except by the legs hanging out before or behind. All these camels had on their heads a piece of skin, apparently camel’s skin with the hair on, having holes through which the ears are passed. These grotesque hoods seemed of natural growth, and, contrasted with the rest of the body which was desti tute of hair, made the animal look much like an ostrich. They were perhaps designed as a shelter for the head against the ex tremes of cold and heat. Of all situations and positions for sleep ing, that on the back of a camel must be one of the most unfavourable, on account of the strange and jolting movement of the animal; but habit can reconcile the body even to this movement, and downright fatigue and drowsiness will do the rest. If excessive watchfulness and exertion will render a man capable of sleeping in a battery amidst a roar of ordnance without being awakened by it, which is an experienced fact, there is no difficulty in believing that a man may slumber even on a camel. Those of this country are very small, and appear to carry but a trifling weight in proportion to the price paid for them. In fact, to any owners but the Illyauts, they seem very unprofitable beasts of burden, the load being only from fifty or sixty to seventy-five Tabriz maunds of seven pounds and a half, while the asses carry half that weight with equal celerity and ease. They?wore ns IP itfi KIZIL OOZAN. however, feed with no less facility on the weeds and small shrubs of the plains, and are perhaps more easily tended. Here we again remarked the black tents of the Illyauts in places where the green vegetation was most abundant, and where the hills presented a shelter from strong winds. At about fifteen miles from Aukhund, was the bridge over the Kizil Oozan, already noticed, which we crossed. It has three large and four small arches. The country around is wild and romantic; a little below the bridge on the left bank rises a rocky mountain, which has on it an object resembling a flat-roofed oblong and large house ; perhaps this is the palace alluded to. About 100 yards farther on the same mountain there appears to be a tower and wall resembling fortifications. These are the objects of which it is said that on approaching them they assume a different form, and prove to be mere rocks. If this report, which is generally believed, be true, the phenomenon may perhaps be thus accounted for. The rocks after crossing the river are of a different character from those that occur on approaching it; they are basaltic, and in many places assume the columnar form, though of no great height. The fancied tower and house then, may be masses of basalt, shaped by art in former times to look like a fortification erected for the de fence of the bridge, and also to serve as a post for this purpose, as they perfectly command the river. They, as well as other objects, are magnified generally to double their height by refraction of light through the vapour. It is asserted that they are not what they seem, and that on examining them closely they are found to be huge low rocks ; but from all that I could- observe I should certainly expect their appearance to be realized where seen, either high or low. The refraction affects only the altitude of objects, and therefore cannot otherwise distort their real form and features. The Kizil Oozan is a deep and rapid stream running through a wild desert of mountains, through which in the course of ages it has worn many great chasms. Beyond the bridge the road ascends for a mile and a half, and descends the same distance over a steep and high mountain, the surface of which is of the same soft loose c c 2196 MEANA. substance already described, and its skeleton is formed of basalt, below strata of sandstone and grey granite. The other mountains of this range appear of the same character. On the right of the road we observed the remains of a broad pavement of basaltic fragments, no doubt originally established as a high-way; but at the present season the path along the soft soil near it is far preferable for horses. It may be asked whether this work as well as the fort and house already mentioned are not of Roman origin. One objection to the affirmative conclusion is, that the bridge, which is probably coeval with them, has its arches pointed after the Moorish or Saracenic form. Two miles beyond the mountain occurs a flat bridge of 23 arches, 150 yards long and 10 wide, including the parapet walls ; it crosses another river running to the eastward, which in its course through a very extensive valley, supplies a great number of streamlets for the cultivation of grain, and of a large quantity of rice. On the hills to the left, which join the mountain range already crossed, called Kauflaun Ko, are two fine villages within five miles of this place, the one deserted, and the other called Cooltuppa. At Shehderabad, eight miles S.W. from hence, an English engineer, Mr. John W. Williamson is working a copper-mine. The ore is good, but there is a difficulty of obtaining hands and a scarcity of pecuniary resources. At four miles beyond the last-mentioned bridge, making altogether a march of twenty-four miles, we came to the straggling town of Meana, which we passed through, because we heard that its old buildings were infested with a little creeping insect called mulla, whose bite is said to produce disease and ultimately death. We were accommodated in a new mud building beyond the town, hitherto untenanted by these formidable visitants. The disease attributed to the effect of their bite, is described by Dr. Campbell as beginning with nausea, bilious vomiting, and loathing of food; to which suc ceed obstructions of the liver, gall-bladder, and other viscera, ter minating in death, within the space of six weeks or two months, according to the strength of the patient. There has been nothing clearly ascertained with regard to the connection of this disease withPRICES OF COMMODITIES AT MEANA. 197 the bite of the insect: the inhabitants of Meana do not fear it, and say that it only affects strangers. At other places the mulla, during the hot season, sometimes comes in myriads, and overruns the villages like a swarm of locusts. The rooms are thoroughly scalded with boiling lime-water, a few days after which the insects are found collected together in large black patches, dead. The people of these villages, like those of JMeana, do not fear the bite of the insect, alleging that it is mortal to their neighbours, and not to themselves. A road strikes off from hence to Ardebil, on the S.W. verge of the Moghaun plains, noticed by the Romans as being impassable on account of serpents. Meana seems to be well stocked with buffaloes and cows. The inhabitants appear to be altogether prosperous, and have a great deal of land under cultivation. The village is in the province of Azur- kyj aun ; &amp; n d here, for the first time, we observed that the people saluted us by touching or taking off their black caps. Thus far, they aie all Mahomedans. Our accommodations at the new mud building weie but indifferent. The prices of articles are as follows: Wheat 48 lbs. per rupee ; rice 1 libs.; wood 84 lbs.; milk 25 lbs.; a cow giving in one day a Shahehmaund, or 15 lbs. of milk, costs 24 rupees ; a buffalo yielding 30 lbs. of milk, 80 rupees; a sheep giving 3£ lbs. milk daily, 5 rupees; a camel for burden carrying 80 Tabriz maunds, costs 80 rupees ; an ass carrying 30 maunds, 24 rupees; a mule carrying 50 maunds, 240 rupees. On enquiring of several intelligent inhabitants respecting the mulla, we were informed, that, according to the general persuasion, it does not bite the inhabitants of this village, nor any poor people ; that it generally breeds and harbours in the crevices of old walls, and does not come forth if a light be kept burning; and that ‘its bite in the first instance produces no other perceptible effect than a round black spot, with a lump below it. In form and colour this insect resembles the large dog-tick of India. It is of a greyish water colour, and is hairy under the body, and between the legs.198 TOORKMAUNSHAHEA. At Meana, we were shown some carpets made by the Illyauts in the neighbourhood; those measuring 7 feet by 3|, designed for beds, were sold at 12 or 15 rupees ; those of 12 feet by 5, were charged 40 rupees. They were generally of a neuter ground, and coloured in the middle ; they were of great weight and thickness, and reckoned of the finest fabric in all Persia; in point of strength, warmth, and superiority of texture, they appeared well deserving the study and imitation of our English manufacturers. The upper surface is of the texture of coarse velvet, extremely thick, and of a proportionably long pile or nap ; it is very durable. The colours, many of them very brilliant, are mostly dyed by the Illyauts; some of them are wrought in grain, from the original red, white, brown, and black tints of the fleece. June 13th.—We departed for Toorkmaunshahea, distant 22 miles. The road for one-third of the march was bad and intricate, being neither broad nor well defined, leading over hills and heights, and frequently intersected by the windings of a rivulet, with many muddy streamlets. It afterwards became broader, but continued hilly throughout the whole way. At 18 miles we observed a village on the left, and crossed another rivulet flowing in that direction. We came to another considerable acclivity, and observed many encamp ments of Illyauts on the neighbouring heights. On descending, we arrived at Toorkmaunshahea, a small, poor straggling village, after a very fatiguing march of 22 miles, over unequal ground. We were accommodated at a new building and enclosure, situated on the left of the road, beyond the village, from which it was separated by a stream. Toorkmaunshahea appears to have a most extensive culti vation attached to it, occupying the higher part of the valley to the south eastward. The grain seemed to be retarded in its growth, in consequence of this elevated and comparatively bleak expo sure. Some Moguls arrived with their tents, and took up their ground near the village. They travelled with mules, and servants on horseback. The tents were unpacked from the baggage borne byUSDENSHEE. 199 the mules, and when pitched appeared to be small (about 8 feet by 5), and low; the colours of their cloth were light blue or green mixed with white. We dispatched a letter to the Secretary of the Russian Ambas sador, now within a few miles of us, stating that we should be on his ground on the following morning. This previous intimation was judged to be necessary in order to obviate any delays. The females of the province of Azurbyjaun wear a dress with sleeves open to the armpits and buttoning to the elbows; sometimes they do not draw on these sleeves, but wear them hanging from the shoulders like wings, thus exposing to view the sleeves of the blue chemise beneath. The Turkish language is spoken altogether; and Persian is not even understood. The children have many of them auburn hair and grey eyes, and are in general very fine, healthy, and of fair complexion. Having received from the Russian Ambassador an answer to our letter, stating that he should be glad to see us, we directed our route to the neighbourhood of Shaingulabad, where he was encamped about four miles to the northward of the high rOad in a deep valley enclosed by high hills, which site he had chosen as a shelter from the heats. On leaving our station we began immediately to ascend a hill, and continued over an undulating country covered with grasses for twelve miles to Usdenshee, a village inhabited by the more industrious Armenians, dhey are entitled to this epithet, as an honourable distinction from the indolent Persians. Here a most decidedly fa vourable change appeared in the state of the cultivation, and we had an opportunity of observing the superiority of the Christian to the Mahomedan religion in improving and harmonizing the condition of society. The animated and cheerful appearance of the village, in which females were observed going about in every direction and employing themselves in useful occupations, formed a delightful contiast to the sepulchral dulness of the Mussulman habitations that we had of late been accustomed to survey. A scene like this could200 INTERVIEW WITH THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR. not be contemplated without feelings of triumph and exultation in the blessings of that genuine revelation which promulgates “ good will to mankind,” as the test of its divine origin, and improves the social system by exalting the female character. At Usdenshee, we quitted the high road and entered upon a path leading in a more northerly direction along fine cultivated valleys to an inhabited village, four miles farther. From hence we pro ceeded along a deep cultivated valley interspersed with corn-mills, to the Ambassador s encampment, pitched close to the village of Shaingulabad, a small cluster of habitations thinly peopled and having a ruined keella or fort on a rising ground. We found the whole village taken up by the suite of the Ambassador or the Persian troops who accompanied him, who together occupied almost every house. All the women of the village had been, by order of the Persian Mehmandaur, who was sent with the Embassy, either sent away or confined in holes surrounded by walls, where they could not, in the smallest degree, be observed. We halted in a garden under some trees, where we breakfasted, having sent a note to inquire when His Excellency would be visible. In a short time an aide-de-camp or officer on duty came with the Ambassador’s com pliments, requesting that we would dine with him at one o’clock. We accordingly waited on him at that hour, in our full uniforms, and were received with every possible mark of kindness. He said that having heard we were not accommodated with tents, he had ordered some to be pitched for us near him, and that he hoped we would consider ourselves as his guests during the time we could spare to remain here, adding that every thing we wished for, that was in his power, he would with pleasure do for us; — this kind offer related to passports, letters of introduction, &amp;c. We halted here the next day, and it is but justice to observe that I never in my life was more gratified on any similar occasion than I was by the kindness of the Ambassador, General Yermoloff. He is himself an officer of great merit, possessing the confidence of his sovereign, by whom he has been employed during the late wars withPOLICY OF RUSSIA. 201 France, in commands of great trust and responsibility. He com manded the 8000 men composing the body guard of the Emperor of Russia and the King of Prussia, on their advance to Paris. Not only he, but all his officers on this mission, together with the two Counsellors of Embassy, M. de Negri and M. de Souoloff, were men of distinguished .merit, having most of them various crosses and honorary insignia. The general himself had eighteen different orders, among which were three stars ; but as he always had on plain clothes, they were not worn by him. These gentlemen of the Embassy were descended from the first families in Russia, and from their conversation, which was in French, they appeared extremely well educated. The Embassy consisted of the general, two coun sellors of embassy, about thirty officers, a painter, a physician, a surveyor, twenty-four troopers of Russian cavalry, some officers of Cossacks, Circassians, &amp;c. One of the counsellors, M. de Negri, a Greek gentleman (I believe of Constantinople) was, we were informed, a member of the council of state, and his relatives were people of considerable consequence in Russia. It is a very important feature in the policy of the Russian government, that individuals of eveiy nation eithei allied with or dependent on that power, are eligible to public employments and may be promoted to the highest offices in the state. General Yermoloff, to prove to me how pre valent was this policy, specified several instances of it, and declared that in all Poland there were not more than four Russians employed publicly by the state, including the Grand Duke Constantine himself, though he held his government in Warsaw, the capital. I could not help reflecting on the very opposite policy, no doubt originating in causes as opposite, which appeared to have actuated our Indian government. Of the effects of this policy, I had the means of forming an opinion, having passed the greater part of my life in India in a military capacity, and having often, but of late more pointedly, remarked its baneful effects, in disposing the minds of the distinguished natives unfavourably towards us. To set this forth, it may be allowable to compare in some points the Indian202 POLICY OF RUSSIA policy with that of the power now under consideration. The Russian government, on acquiring any new possession, as Georgia, for instance, thenceforward to form part of the empire, are very careful not to disgust the principal people whom they find invested with power, or holding any confidential employment previous to the cession. They do not displace established public functionaries to make way for Russian minions and court favourites ; on the contrary they leave them all, as in the instance of Poland, in possession of their offices, with very few exceptions arising from the change of system; and thus they encourage rather than frustrate the views of ambition and future pre-eminence by which the various indi viduals in public stations are actuated. In fact, they offer them their protection, and open a larger and more favourable scope for their exertions, by holding forth the prospect of honourable and advan tageous situations under a government more powerful than that whose interests they had originally espoused. Through these gentle and prudent measures, the acquisition of a new territory is effected with very little excitation of the feelings of its people, the mass of whom, observing no adverse change in the course of things, are scarcely conscious of this silent transfer of the reins of power. The local governments of India, on any new acquisition of territory, which, contrary to the case of Russia, seldom happens to be con tiguous to their own, aim at the accomplishment of two objects. The first is to keep it in subjection with the least additional expence, or in other words, with the smallest possible augmentation of civil and military establishments; the second is to institute a superiority of European influence in every branch of government, political, judicial, civil and commercial. In furtherance of this latter purpose care is at the same time taken to provide for those whose names stand foremost in the lists for lucrative promotion. Hence it becomes necessary rather to frustrate than to cherish any hopes of individual aggrandisement which the natives of distinction may entertain, nor can any increase of their influence either political or even commercial be acquiesced in.leofle, km( me is of coii- COMPARED WITH THAT OF BRITISH INDIA. 203 Ihe advantages of the contrary course pursued by the Russian government, in this department of policy, will no doubt be detailed and illustrated by more competent writers on the general subject to which it belongs ; it is therefore needless in this place to enlarge upon it: but I may be permitted briefly to adduce some of the baneful consequences that have resulted from the system acted upon in India. In the affairs of nations it has been observed, that a direct opposition to schemes of ambition and pre-eminence is the cause of foreign wars; and in the concerns of a single nation the same prin ciple of action tends to foment intestine discord, rebellion, and civil war. The first acquisition of territory on the side of Bombay which I can remember was Malabar; and it is well known that we were involved in many long and painful contests with its inhabitants, first in the south, under the principal Moplas, and then more northerly, in Coteote, with the Nayrs. It would be foreign to the purpose of the present narrative to enter minutely into the different causes of these internal commotions; but I cannot help observing generally, that they were mainly attributable to the unfortunate policy already explained. They might have been obviated in a great degree, if after first entering upon the government of the new territory the administration had, at least for some time, allowed a limited scope for the exertions of persons employed, and expecting pre-eminence in this warlike state; but unfortunately our military establishment, originally organized for a very different mode of warfare, did not admit of the employment of irregular troops, commanded by persons of distinction, Nayrs and Moplas, as was usual in Malabar; nor could any natives be admitted, except as private soldiers. Similar causes may have operated to produce the recent dis turbances in the Mahratta country, where our different forces, sub sidized for the service of their Highnesses the Nizam, the Peishwa, the Guikwar, and the Berar Rajah, are simple detachments from our regular army, principally infantry without a due proportion of n n 2204 POLICE OF THE BRITISH IN INDIA. cavalry, and therefore calculated rather to reunite into one powerful, slow-moving, besieging army, than to act separately and with celerity in small bodies. Yet, such were the duties naturally to be expected from them by the native powers who subsidized them. I must here remark, and it is well worthy of notice, that the very composition of the subsidiary forces is such, that the native powers who subsidize them have no alternative but to keep up their original bodies of irregular horse, to protect them from the hosts of cavalry maintained by their warlike neighbours. There seems to be no doubt that if it should hereafter become necessary to enter into a much more extensive scale of warfare, this necessity will arise more from the original inadequacy of the subsidiary forces to the individual views and public services required of them, than from any other cause whatever. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say, that let the object in view be once clearly defined, and troops commanded by English officers will go as near to accomplish it as those commanded by men of any other nation. For example, if in the formation, or sub sequent perfectioning of the subsidiary forces, the end contemplated had been to render it needless for the native princes to maintain large bodies of cavalry, and to make those forces capable of acting with superior power and celerity in hunting down the Pindarees, &amp;c., those desirable objects would have by this time been accomplished. There would have been attached to those subsidiary forces bodies of well-appointed light cavalry, supported and protected by small bodies of infantry, who could have followed them within reach by being mounted, for such an occasion, on the commissariat’s camels and other beasts of burden, for which kind of operations the Mahratta country is peculiarly favourable, having at distances of a few miles a fortified vil lage, heights, or broken ground, of which advantage might be taken. If, instead of economically forming our subsidiary forces of mere detachments of our standing army, a proportion of each force had been composed of cavalry of the country selected from the most effective of the whole, and commanded by British officers, such proportion of the subsidiaries would be suited in a superior degreePOLICY OF THE BRITISH IN INDIA. 2 05 to tbe light duties that might be required of them, and a limited scope would have been left to the ambitious views of the few indi viduals who form the best description of their troops. The cavalry of the native powers of India is composed of men of wiom not more than one-fourth in number would be deemed eligible for our service; and when we consider the native trooper as a c^om- pound of man and horse, not more than one in six of such troopers would be admissible in our cavalry. The advantages of the selection ere indicated must therefore be obvious; for, by attaching a m-eat proportion of such superior troopers to our interest, we avail 'our selves of the main strength of their irregular cavalry which in a defense point of view exists in them alone, and render the residue til more contemptible than before. It must also be remembered at in political balances the maxim is, that one in favour, or one in opposition must be considered as making a difference of two. This would doubtless be duly attended to, were it not opposed and thwarted by a more common, and of late a more favoured maxim, that a penny saved is a penny gained, than which nothing can be more a acious in regard to the military establishments of India, where superior efficiency alone must make up for inferiority of numbers • for efficiency implies celerity of movement, and in offensive warfare that alone is economy: and until we are reduced to defensive operations, which I trust I shall never live to witness, delays are inseparably and unequivocally attended with boundless profusion. However, I had almost forgotten that I was not in India, but in Persia, a country which, fortunately for the application of this digres sion very much resembles that of the Mahrattas, and any subsidies 01 its defence might advantageously be formed on the principle here ^ To revert to our intercourse with the Russian EmbassyGeneral 1 ermoloff, from the time of our first introduction to him as British officers, threw off all formality and reserve towards us, and behaved with as much affability and kindness as if we had long enjoyed his acquaintance and even merited his esteem. He desired that weVENOMOUS SPIDER. 206 would come to him perfectly at our ease, in our usual travelling- dresses, and pass our evenings at his tent. In every point of his conduct towards us he evinced a desire to oblige us. He earnestly requested that we would inform him of the route which we intended to take through Russia, and hoped that we would, if possible, halt another day with him. This invitation we could not refuse to accept, and in return we begged that he and the gentlemen of his suite would allow us to be the bearers of any letters which they might have to send to their families or friends resident on or near the line of our journey; and we knew that they might more conveniently avail themselves of this offer, if we delayed our departure another day. . . . Having understood that the General had some Circassians m his suite, I had expressed a wish to see their national costume ; he therefore desired two of them to dress themselves in different dresses ; the one appeared in armour and on horseback, as for war; the other presented himself in undress. General Yermoloff per ceiving that I much admired these dresses, and seemed anxious to make sketches of them, directed the painter of the Embassy to save me that trouble by making two drawings of tho^e persons on the spot, which he gave me. . . Early in the morning I walked out with the intention of finding some position from which to take a sketch of the Russian encamp ment and of the mountainous country around it. On ascending one of the hills in the neighbourhood, I observed crawling on the ground an insect resembling a large-bodied spider, having four sharp fangs or claws projecting from the front of its mouth. I concluded that this was one of a species of tarantula which General Yermoloff had described on the preceding evening as amazingly venomous. He stated that it is found in Georgia, where he had known one or two instances of persons dying in convulsions from the effects of the bite. For the purpose of satisfying my curiosity I contrived to make the insect pass over a string, prepared with a slip-knot, by which I secured it by the legs, and carried it to the tents. It was pronouncedDEPARTURE FROM THE ENCAMPMENT. 207 to be the insect in question, though not of so large a size as those found in Georgia. The natives of the village called it in Turkish Bheule, and warned me to beware of its bite, as it would certainly prove fatal. The name by which it is known in Georgia is Phalang. As we were to set out from the camp very early on the following morning, we expressed a wish to take leave of the Ambassador over night, that we might avoid disturbing his accustomed hours of rest. He however assured us that he was an early riser, and stated that he had not quite finished his letters: as we could not doubt that these were of a private nature, and written to satisfy the minds of his friends in Russia as to his welfare, we readily and cheerfully acquiesced in the delay, and sending off our servants and baggage by three o’clock in the morning, we remained until near six, when we were informed that His Excellency was up, and ready to receive us. We therefore went to take leave of him, when, to our very great surprise, we found him just closing a large bundle of letters, in writing which he had been occupied during the greater part of the night. Having finished, he brought them and gave them into our charge, men tioning successively the names of the officers to whom we were to deliver them. We now perceived that they were addressed to those in command of all the principal places and towns in Russia through which we had to pass, the series commencing with the first Russian post on the frontier of Persia, and ending with two letters for Warsaw, in Poland, which he desired that we would deliver with our own hands, one being addressed to the General Officer on the staff of the Grand Duke Constantine, and the other to His Impe rial Highness the Grand Duke himself. Among these letters, there was not one of a private nature or regarding his personal interests. I must own, that at the moment when they were presented to me, I felt embarrassed and confused by the mingled feelings of gratitude for the favours shown to us, and the provident exertions made for our future comfort, and of regret for having on the day before so cheerfully, and as it might now appear, so interestedly, delayed our departure. With these sentiments was combined the regret at so208 OOJAUN. suddenly leaving this estimable man, without any hope of having it in my power to make him a return for these acts of friendship. Confused, however, as I was, I could only express to him my sincere thanks, and wish him health to enjoy that prosperity to which his friendly disposition so eminently entitled him. Durins: the whole of our intercourse with General Yermoloff and the officers in the Embassy and of his suite, I observed not only a general amenity of manner, but a degree of familiarity subsisting among them, which led me to believe that many of the junior officers were the Ambassador s kinsmen. I was afterwards informed that only one of them was at all related to him; and I now conclude that this enviable state of their society was solely attributable to the conciliatory and amiable disposition of their chief, General Yer- moloffi June 21st. — We set out for Oojaun. The road commenced by an ascent up some high hills by which the valley was bounded, and which are so steep as to be considered dangerous. The path was altogether good, and continued over heights and uneven country to the westward, until we gained the high road about five miles from the village we had left. It here turned into its usual direction of N. N. W. At eight miles we passed the village of Yainga two miles to the right, and at ten miles a caravansera on the road. We crossed a stream running to the left, close to it, and after ascending a height, perceived afar off the village of Tickmaundaush, which at thirteen miles we passed at the distance of one mile on our left, and con tinued our march over very fine plains covered with forage. At sixteen miles, we crossed a river running to the right through the valley, and here observed the village of Kurrama one mile and a half to the right, and that of Sheerwauordai one mile to the left. In the plains of forage there were many horses feeding, and small tents pitched for persons to guard them. After traversing another range of rising grounds, we observed a palace of the King’s about three hundred yards to the right of the road. It had but a little garden- ground around it. This palace was built for His Majesty to retire to &lt;ARRIVAL AT TABRIZ. 209 in the hottest weather, Oojaim being considered the coldest part of Persia. It has the advantage also of abundant forage for cattle. After crossing a plain, and a bridge over a rivulet flowing to the right, we arrived at the village of Oojaun, a wretched place. We had no better accommodation than a dark and filthy stable. There were several villages within view, as Boostunabad, N. 80 E. distant three miles on the foot of the hills, at which are some mineral springs ; Keltaun, N. 70 E. f mile ; Seysaun, W. two miles; Selmud Mountains covered with snow, distant twelve miles S. 65 W. and Couvauna Mountains, distant six miles, 155 W. June 22nd. — Our next journey was to Tabriz, distant thirty-two miles, which we performed in nine hours. We left our hovel as soon as we could, and set out at eleven at night, travelling over a very good road, with a gentle ascent, until we arrived at a defile, or ghaut, at eight miles and a half. The ascent was steep, but the descent much more so. At ten miles we passed a caravansera covered with arches on the road, which is often occupied by robbers, who, as it is not open above, can defend it a long time. Here the snow in winter drifts from the hills, and often impedes travellers, for whose safety and shelter the caravansera was originally built. About a mile farther there is a rivulet which disappears among the rocks. The road continued good until we drew near the village of Bausmitch, which is large, and surrounded by abundant cultivation and gardens. Before entering the village, we crossed a rapid rivulet by a wooden bridge. After quitting the place and its enclosures, we con tinued to ascend and descend stony heights till we arrived at Tabriz. The latter part of this march being over white soil and stones, producing much glare, heat, and dust, was harassing and fatiguing. In fact, although the road was very broad and much beaten by the continual passage of travellers and cattle in great numbers, yet it seemed altogether one of the most disagreeable that we had hitherto encountered. Doubtless the annoyance which we experienced was rendered more grievous by the distance we had this day marched, and we did not arrive at the gardens within a mile and a half ofPRINCE ABBAS MEERZA. Tabriz until eight in the morning. Here we halted, and having written to Dr. Cormick, a gentleman resident at the town, we break fasted on cherries fresh gathered from the trees, and some of the finest we had ever seen. They were of the white-heart kind, very highly flavoured and full of juice. The other fruits were not yet in season, which was rather to be regretted, as the peaches of this place are reported to be larger and finer than any in Europe. Here we found great abundance of walnuts of the preceding year, dried peaches, apricots, and very large nuts which grow wild. We were supplied also with the paper-almond, the shell of which is so thin as to break on pressure; pistachio nuts, ice, in short every thing requisite for a comfortable repast. The English gentlemen resident at Tabriz live together in very great harmony, dining alternately at each other’s houses, and paying other friendly and social visits. They most kindly requested that we would be their guests. From the moment that they introduced themselves to us in this suburban garden, (for they all came thither to see us at eleven o’clock,) their kindness was equally cordial with that which we had experienced on similar occasions on the road. Here I cannot pass unnoticed the superior hospitality which prevails in small social circles of this kind, not only to the individuals composing them, but to others who are introduced as strangers to them. In the retrospect of life, those situations in which I made, one of such a society seem almost the only ones which the loss of an opportunity of renewing would excite a feeling of regret. June 23d. —-We paid a visit to the Prince Abbas Meerza, having first waited on his Vizier, in red boots and the usual costume of court. We went through the ceremony of bowing twice or thrice at the interview. The Prince was very affable, and asked us many questions concerning India, our return to England, and other inci dental topics. He requested that I would consult with Captain Monteath respecting the defence of the frontier, and examine the fortifications of this place ; both which intimations I attended to the next day.FORTIFICATIONS OF TABRIZ. 211 June 24th.—In the evening we rode out in company with Captain Lindsay of the Artillery, and Captain Monteath of the En gineers, round the walls of the town, which the Prince is now strengthening as much as possible ; but it is lamentable to observe, that, instead of attending to the advice of Captain Monteath, he is going on in his own way, and seems to rest the defence of the town on the prayers of his head priest and the efforts of the Musulmans, which, however, would be of no avail against Russian artillery. The town is surrounded by two walls, the first or inner one being of mud, flanked by towers of brick masonry, the whole about twenty feet high, having a parapet, weakened by holes cut through it for throwing stones, with loop-holes, &amp;c. This and the rampart also, as well as the towers, are all hollow, and already shaken and cracked from top to bottom in every direction, particularly the towers, so that a few shot must bring the whole down. Even in its present state it serves merely to increase the dangers to which the troops would be exposed from an enemy’s fire, as the bricks and stones would fly in all directions when struck by shot. This mode of defence, too, by high narrow walls, is more objectionable here than elsewhere, because earthquakes are so very common every year; and they alone frequently shake these walls, which can never be consi dered of any farther use than to obstruct an enemy destitute of cannon. The second or outer wall, a kind of fausse-braye, is a high narrow parapet erected on the escarpe, which, beginning from the bottom of the dry ditch, is built throughout only of mud, and is crumbling down by its own weight, before the whole is finished. This also has no flanks, and can be used only for musketry and stones. The distance between the two walls is frequently no more than ten feet, and in some places twenty or thirty. The ditch is a deep trench of about twenty feet, and thirty or forty wide ; its sides are built up with mud, and on the counter-scarp a quantity of earth is thrown to cover the walls, which purpose it might answer very well; but it is at the same time so constructed as to give cover to the enemy from the fire of the walls at the foot of its slope. e e 2212 FORTIFICATIONS OF TABRIZ. In addition to these defects the houses, inclosures, aqueducts, and ruins, are allowed to remain untouched close up to the ditch ; and in many instances the public buildings of the garrison are erected with their walls close and parallel to those of the town; which are all very great defects to a fortification. On one side is a structure which they call a citadel, being nothing more than a portion of the town walls projecting beyond the rest, and separated from the town by a single wall of similar construction. The different faces of this work are seen, from the heights outside, in reverse ; and it is, at all events, as easy (if not easier) to be taken by an enemy as any other part of the fortification. The ditches are crossed by bridges of wood covered with earth. This specimen, not to mention others, is sufficient to show that the Persians are quite as ignorant as the Indians, of the art of defence. The grand mosque, and the ark, old massive buildings of very great height, have been both shaken and greatly destroyed by earth quakes within the last three years; yet the natives continue to erect buildings with high walls in all directions. June 25th.—We went with the same gentlemen to the ark or for tified palace, to see the train of artillery ; and, I regret to say, we found them in a very miserable state. A few small six-pounder amusettes, on light and low carriages, called the mountain-train, so constructed as to be carried by mules, when taken to pieces ; and a few nine or twelve pounders, all of brass, cast on the spot, mounted with their timbers ; — these together constitute all the artillery for the defence of the town, and perhaps of the frontier, with but few, if any, stores or ammunition for them. The brass guns are pretty well cast and bored here ; but the iron work of the carriages is very inferior to ours of India. In fact, there are very few of the little mud-fortified places of India that are not better provided with guns and stores for defence than this capital, or rather this principal military frontier station of the Persian empire. On thisi day, finding that no mules were to be hired, and not being disposed to wait the arrival of any from Teflis or Tehraun, we tookALARM CONCERNING THE RUSSIANS. 213 occasion, on a visit to the Kaima Khaun, or Minister, to request that he would send orders for us to be supplied with six chupper horses, to take us to Erivan. Another difficulty arose respecting the coins or remittances : it appeared that we must lose by whatever coin we took with us from this place ; that which we preferred was the bajo- glee or Dutch ducat, which, being of gold, is most conveniently carried. The Persians, at this juncture, were in great alarm concerning the intentions of the Russians; and finding that our Indian, government will not allow any of their officers or men to remain and act hos- tilely in the Persian service, they were of course eager to give employ to our ancient rivals the French. At present, that is at the period of our journey, there were five officers of that nation, and four of Italy and Sicily, recently entertained by the Prince, who had directly appointed them to the command of battalions, &amp;c. For a short time, the English mode of drill and exercise was ordered; but of late it has been neglected. The policy of preventing English officers from entering into the service of the native powers, is very question able ; for it can hardly be conceived that if they were so employed, their influence would be otherwise than beneficial to the English interests, wherever they might be ; and certainly such engagements ought not only to be permitted, but encouraged to such an extent as would check the introduction of foreigners. There are nearly 1000 privates of the Russians and Georgians in this Prince’s service, who have from time to time deserted from their own, and have been received by him. He appears to be not inattentive to those measures which are cal culated to promote the welfare of the province which he governs. He has engaged Mr. Armstrong, a scientific man and an excellent mechanist, in superintending the construction of mills and other public works, at a salary of 800 tomauns or pounds a year ; and his services are a most valuable acquisition to the country. The Persians are of' quick apprehension, and very apt in learning any art or science, and there is no doubt that they will profit rapidly under soPRINCIPAL PERSONAGES. 215 the mountain train ; but the stores and ammunition are, as already stated, very deficient. The names and titles of the principal persons here, are as follows:— Khym Mekam, or Meerza Boozoorg Issau, third in employ. Abool Kaussim, Minister of the Prince. Meerza Mahomed Ally, head Mustoffee or Secretary. Meerza Tucky, second Mustoffee. Meerza Hussaun, third Mustoffee and Secretary at War. Futteh Ally Khaun, mentioned by General Malcolm in his History of Persia, is Governor of the Town. This gentleman is of the Beshed family. The principal merchants are Syed Ahmet and Syed Abdool Gauny. The Dutch ducat circulates here for six rupees, minus one-eighth ; and if a traveller requires money, an advantage of from 15 to 18 per cent, may be obtained by giving bills on India, as such remittances are always in request. As the Prince has a mint of his own here, we expressed some curiosity to see its productions ; they coined for us a few tomauns and half tomauns for counters, of which I preserved some. fr : Food, fruit, and almost all articles, except tea, sugar, wax candles, cutlery, and European wares, are to be had here at extremely mo derate prices.216 CHAPTER XIII.

Although the Russian Embassy had been received by the Persians with marks of respect, yet I learnt with considerable regret that the officers of the mission, and even General Yermoloff himself, had not been treated individually with that consideration and attention which they so much merited. Indeed, while we were with them near Shaingulabad, we heard some complaints respecting the defective supply of articles required for their daily use. It was also stated that they were minutely watched and circumscribed in all their motions, and all communication with the natives of Persia was pre vented. The Persians, I observe, assume a very high tone in conversation, as if the late trifling increase of their military establishments ren dered them sufficiently powerful to oppose directly and openly the views of Russia. They recollect at the same time that they formerly resisted the Russians with success, and they affect to regard these diplomatic advances as dictated by fear, nor can they be persuaded that the present Embassy ought to be viewed in a very different light from those which they formerly received from the same quarter,GOVERNMENT ORDERS. 217 ^iiid that it should be treated with much greater deference. They do not appear to be sufficiently aware of their own disunited state, indeed of their political decline; nor do they seem well enough in formed of the late change of character that has taken place in the Russian armies, the great superiority of abilities by which their officeis in general are distinguished, and especially the improvements by which those in high ranks have qualified themselves as com manders during the last war. They are not at all disposed to give credit to the reports of the immense disposable force which Russia now possesses, but treat these rumours as mere political gasconades; a species of ammunition with which their own rulers are amply pro vided. Persia, I will maintain, possesses some natural means of defence not to be surmounted by heavy armed European forces, and can avail herself, for predatory and offensive operations, of a host of invul nerable champions, among her Nomade tribes, who must look down from their fastnesses with exultation on the advances of a regular army, bedizened after the modern fashion, as promising abundance of plunder which they can seize at pleasure and without risk to themselves, since they have nothing to lose. Notwithstanding every exertion on the part of our friends during our stay at Tabriz, we were not able to procure either horses, mules, or even camels for the transport of our baggage. We required no more than six; and here perhaps lay the difficulty, as in hiring so small a number it was thought that we should not have attendants sufficient to defend them in this wild country, so near the confines of the Russian territory, and so infested by banditti of the Khordish and Illyaut tribes. Thus circumstanced, we procured, through the kind intervention of Dr. Cormick, an order from the Prince Abbas Meerza for six chupper or courier horses, to be furnished to us from station to station. The Prince also most obligingly assigned to us six of his own mules to carry our baggage the first long march of forty-three miles, from Tabriz to Mehraund, and granted us also an official order218 DEPARTURE FROM TABRIZ. for the abundant supply of all such articles of sustenance as should be required for ourselves and our horses from Tabriz to Erivan, the capital of a district of the same name, where another great personage held the command. It ought to be added that as the Prince had already divested himself of a considerable proportion of his disposable means of transport in supplying the Russian Embassy with horses and mules for their baggage, and with tukht rewauns for their officers, this act of his kindness to us must have exposed him to some personal inconvenience, and was therefore the more memorable. The tukht rewauns alluded to are a kind of covered seat, litter, or cage, carried by mules, harnessed to two poles, one mule before and another behind, in the same manner as a sedan is carried by chairmen. It is a mode of conveyance which the Persians deem effeminate, and proper only for women or for persons labouring under the infirmities of old age or disease. It was doubtless allotted to the Embassy as a means of screening the principal officers from the intense heat of the sun, as they chose to travel by day, which the Persians never do unless urged by necessity. June 27th.—After dinner, about nine o’clock, on a fine moon-light night, we left Tabriz for Mehraund, distant forty-three miles. We first moved through ruins of houses, and at about two miles crossed a narrow bridge over the Agi river, running to the left. Its sources are in the plains of Sir Aub, and in the mountains of Sevallen beyond them. For thirteen miles beyond this bridge, the road has on its left a salt and marshy plain, and on its right a tract of drier groun and some hills. This tract is in itself good, but is in many places intersected by streamlets for irrigation. We now crossed another bridge of two arches, over a river running to the left; and close at hand was the village of Sahilan. Thus far the water is brackish. We proceeded twelve miles farther along the road, to Sophiana* where the range of hills verges close on the right. After quitting the ruins of this village and traversing some small streamlets, we passed between hills for eight miles further; the interval that sepa rated them seldom exceeded half a mile and abounded with pasturage,GOVERNMENT ORDERS. 219 having in the middle of it a strong current of water. Here we found a ruined caravansera, and a chummun or pasturage, called Yain, sufficient for the maintenance of large flocks of camels and other cattle. Ere we reached this place we had observed several groups of tents of our friends the Illyauts, pitched along the ascent and in sheltered spots. Their herds were seen ranging over the hills. Two miles hence we descended gently by a pass between hills until we reached the cultivated grounds surrounding the village of Mehraund, having a separate fort on an eminence to the south-eastward of the houses, which seems good for the defence of the country. This march of forty-three miles occupied us ten hours and a half. The accommodations at the Munzul Khoneh were good, and here we first made trial of the mode of subsistence established for travellers having a written order from the Prince. Our provisions were sup plied by his public servants, pursuant to the order, daily, in the fol lowing proportions of meat 7 lbs., bread 21 lbs., rice, butter, milk, eggs, and fowls in greater plenty than we could require. We ordered that some of this fare should be dressed for us, being apprehensive that our attendants, who were far in the rear, would not come up in time. The request was complied with, and our cook, on his arrival observing what preparations were makings merely boiled some fine rice for breakfast, and got ready some hot water for tea. The villagers, however, seeing him thus occupied, supposed that he would dress all that we wanted; and therefore, while we from night marching were asleep, they ate up all that they had been preparing for us. It was not until twelve that we got our breakfast, dressed in a hurry and very badly. Our horses too fared much the worse for the pro vident hospitality of the Prince, for they were fed with gratuitous chopped straw instead of purchased grass. Much of the provision brought to us was of inferior quality and dirtily served up : so much, thought we, for being entertained through the privilege of the Prince’s order ! He had also lent us six mules; but his servants kept them back on the road while they cooked and ate their victuals at the first village to which they came; and although they set out three hours before us F F 2220 GOVERNMENT ORDERS. from Tabriz, they did not arrive until more than an hour after us at Mehraund. It is a custom with the Princes, and other persons in command in Persia, who vie with each other in marks of hospitality to strangers whom they wish to favour, such as for instance to persons of dis tinction travelling through their districts, to change the Mehmandaur who accompanies them, and to give to the one substituted a written order which is to secure the supply of such articles as are required for the daily sustenance of the travellers, as well as of their followers and cattle. The different halting places are noted in this written order, and the public servants stationed there are enjoined to provide the requisite articles and to charge government with them in their accounts. If an officer or any other person in the Persian service travels on government business, a sum that is deemed equivalent to his daily expenditure, and is rated according to his rank and to the number of his equipage, is specified as the value to be supplied to him in provisions at each halting place; and he has generally the option of receiving the specified supply in kind or in money. For example, an officer commanding a battalion, or a gentleman in the medical department, travelling on duty, is allowed two tomauns or pounds sterling a day, or the equivalent of that sum in provisions. The head-man of the village at which he halts, when the order is pre sented, either pays him the cash or furnishes to him the provisions. The money is frequently preferred; and if the traveller chooses to make two stages per day, he claims the stipulated sum at each halting place. While considering this subject it may be useful to mention some disadvantages which are encountered in travelling under a govern ment order, for fresh cattle from village to village. In the first place, the cattle can seldom be obtained without considerable delay; for the head-man at the halting place, in order to spare the cattle of his own village, sends to those in the vicinity, requiring them to furnish their contingents. In our own case, although we wantedGOVERNMENT ORDERS. 221 only six horses or mules, and had given notice at eight in the morning, it was not until nine at night that they were collected. In the next place, ropes and bags were wanted for the boxes. Then it almost invariably happens that the people of the distant villages, or other persons ill disposed to pay due respect to the order, send a lazy, lame, or otherwise inefficient animal, who in consequence of his slow progress retards all the rest. Besides, as the owners of the beasts accompany them throughout the whole stage, they are de sirous to spare them as much as possible, and go much slower than those who let out their mules to hire. In the course, too, of so many changes among strangers, many things are liable to loss or to damage in packing. All these inconveniences, added to the very great one of marching much earlier and of being on the road much later, from want of influence to enforce expedition, render the dimi nution of expense in this mode of travelling, the only object of consideration. For things that are not in daily use such a convey ance may certainly be desirable ; but for the carriage of bed or camp trunks, cooking utensils, and also of the horse-keeper with his ropes and other equipments, none but the traveller’s own cattle, or those hired by the month or for the day, can conveniently be em ployed. With the addition of two boxes of clothes, a traveller ought to have little more than the articles above mentioned. With respect also to the provisions obtained by order from the villages, the supply of them can be expected to answer for servants only; and if the traveller has but two, this apparently hospitable license is of little use, as the articles which it procures are generally of the worst kind. The packing and loading of the horses being required to be re peated at every station, must obviously demand great care and attention ; much trouble would be saved if the loads were previously subdivided and tied together in half loads by the traveller’s own people every evening ; allowance being made for some weaker cattle by rendering most of the burdens light enough for a boy to ride along with them. These precautions, and the attendance of an active and intelligent servant, may diminish many troubles which222 ALHUNDAR. would otherwise impede the traveller’s progress and prevent him from obtaining needful rest. As for ourselves, we lost a great part of our rest by travelling in the night: a variety of circumstances concurred to interrupt our sleeping in the day-time, such as the glare of light, the taking of our meals, the annoyance of insects, the noise of our own people, the neighing of horses, the braying of mules, the singing of beggars, and the impertinent curiosity and loquacity of the villagers. June 28th. — We departed at ten at night from Mehraund for Gur-gur, or rather for Alhundar, distant thirty-four miles, where we arrived at half-past seven on the morning of the 29th. We pro ceeded over the plains of Mehraund for the first six miles; and then, approaching the hills, began to ascend much higher ground. Here, as on the latter part of the march of yesterday, we ob served a scarcity of all forage, except weeds, and these occurred only near the water-courses. At sixteen miles appeared a ruined caravansera on a high mountain vale, with hills in its vicinity. The road hitherto, and four miles further, was uniformly good; but afterwards it began to be stony, leading over hills and vales, the higher range of hills being parallel on the right at the distance of about half a mile. At twenty-four miles we gained the summit of a very strong pass, between high, rocky, and barren hills, having a rivulet running through it which descends from its source in a small swamp a mile distant on the S.E. side, and increasing in magnitude toward the bottom. At twenty-seven miles the range of hills terminates, and a plain commences, which is well culti vated, and has many streamlets and mills. At twenty-nine miles there is a branch to Gur-gur from the direct main road ; it turns to the right or N. E. and E. verging close on the foot of the hills until it reaches Gur-gur, thirty-two miles and a half from Mehraund. Here as our Mehmandaur found a want of accommodation, we passed on northward to Alhundar, a village still more execrable in appear ance, where we were accommodated in a cow-house, a much worse shelter than any we had found since we left Tehraun. Throughout the whole of this day’s march we found abundance of water inDIET IN HOT CLIMATES. 223 streamlets that traversed the country. The weather early in the day began to be sultry and close, and continued so; when moving to the eastward, we found it scorching and oppressive. The night was cool and delightful. It is obvious that the effects of heat and sun shine must be much more severely felt by European travellers, who generally prefer journeying in the morning; and as they are in the habit of eating full meals at stated periods, are disinclined to move after dinner. To this they are still more averse, if they be in the habit of taking wine or any other stimulant after that meal. For my own part, although I have, during more than twenty years of my residence in India, discontinued the use of strong liquors of every kind, from a conviction that such a beverage would be like fuel added to fire ; and although I have substituted sherbet and lemonade for water when it has been found brackish, or in other respects unwholesome, yet I have remarked that whenever I marched soon after a full meal, I then, and only then, became thirsty, and my mouth felt more or less parched. If the practice of marching or riding immediately after dinner be continued for many days together, indigestion and diarrhoea supervene, with all their deleterious con sequences. While resident in India, my abstinence from vinous liquids of every kind enabled me to expose myself to the sun with nearly as much impunity as a native of the country ; and in marches that often lasted from sun-rise to sun-set, I found that if I once drank I afterwards felt an inclination to repeat the draught. It was my practice, whenever thirst became troublesome, merely to rinse my mouth for the purpose of allaying it. In short, the habit of indulging, to any great degree, in intoxicating liquors, in a hot climate, appears fraught with many dangers, as it predisposes the frame to all the diseases incident to such a temperature. Hence, persons who are accustomed to consider those liquors as essential to their comfort, ought to shun travelling in hot climates, or even a long residence in them, as they would shun contagion. Too much exer cise or bodily exertion, during heat, will be attended with conse quences similar to those arising from excess in wine; such as restless-224 CROSSING OF THE ARAXES. ness, thirst, and feverish heat in the hands and feet, perceptible at night Where the former cause of these symptoms operates, as in the case of a traveller or a military man, the latter cause, indulgence, ought to be avoided. As instinct tends to the preservation of animals, so the dictates of nature and reason in man will point out whatever is beneficial or hurtful in any climate or country in which he may happen to be. To a stranger it may be useful to observe the preva lent and confirmed habits of the natives, and to follow their example in the choice of his food. In hot countries the favourite diet consists of vegetables and fruits, while animal food in excess is regarded with a repugnance almost amounting to disgust; the free use of the former eatables tends to prevent constipation, which is another most power ful source of disease carefully to be guarded against in travelling. June 29th.—We left our dark and comfortless abode by eleven at night, and set out for Nuckshywaun, distant 32 miles. Having passed through the village and proceeded half a mile beyond it, we turned to the right down a steep chasm in a northerly direction, and rode over a flat at the bottom. At five miles we observed the village of Sooya, close on the right, and about a mile northward of it on a high ground were the ruins of a village of the same name. The road here was rather narrow and bad, but it led again over flats, no doubt at times overflowed by the river Arras or Araxes, which we crossed at eight miles, flowing very rapidly to the right, and in this part about sixty yards wide. The ferry-boat was of the rudest con struction ; it was twenty-two feet in length, and thirteen in breadth in the middle, being near about 1 £ feet deeper than at the two extre mities. It was of a lozenge form, having three pieces of timber extending the whole length, under which were fastened the planks of the bottom and those of the sides. These were three feet high, and formed of three thick planks. Below and on the uppermost planks are fixed uprights, between which other thinner planks are nailed. This unwieldly machine was pushed across the river with thick poles, which were used as oars in the deep water. We marched into it, with attendants, cattle, and baggage, the only precaution used beingNUCKSHYWAUN. 225 that of taking the baggage off the backs of the horses. They walked in thus unloaded, by two places at one end, defended by a railing which was removed to admit them. This entrance of our cattle into a bark of such primitive structure, in the neighbourhood of Mount Ararat, could not fail to suggest an allusion to the embarkation in the ark ; or rather our landing on the other side of the river, in this lonely country, might accord with the idea of its evacuation. Might we not here say, that after the subsiding of the deluge, the stream was seen to flow in its present channel, the uncultivated hills and desert places wore their present aspect, and plants similar to those that they now bear, then grew on them ! Might we not conclude, that in a scene such as this, the Patriarch first noted the recurrence of the seasons in their order, which, according to the Divine promise, should continue uninterrupted until the end of time ! Although we had only nine horses and men, the passage of the river occupied us an hour and a half. After reloading the horses on the opposite bank, we continued our march along a gentle ascent for eight miles, and then entered a strong pass between precipices of naked rock, having a rivulet in the middle, along the stony bed of which we occasionally moved, as there was no other practicable road. After leaving this defile, which was about one mile long, we went up some barren heights, and, again descending, crossed the same rivulet, which was here much larger and deeper, intersecting a nar row valley of good pasturage. We traversed another range of sterile hills, and at thirty miles came to a broad river which was fordable, close to the ruins of an old bridge of thirteen arches of brick. At thirty-two miles, after passing through the garden-enclosures and a great part of the town of Nuckshywaun, we halted in the house and garden of an Armenian, where we met with exceedingly good, quiet, and retired accommodations. Our host was remarkably attentive, and regaled us with two plates of apples, of the pippin kind, very small and delicious, indeed superior in flavour to most of the apples grown in England. He spread carpets, placed cushions, brought us water, bread, and all that he could suppose we wished for. G G226 MOUNT ARARAT. / The Armenians, Christians of the Greek Church, appear, from the little that I have seen of them, to be industrious and peaceful. They far excel the Mahomedans in agricultural pursuits, in weaving, and other useful arts, which form the basis of a nation’s opulence. They are in general much slighted by their Mahomedan neighbours, who are a worthless, indolent, high-worded, but base-minded race, remarkable for duplicity, attached by prejudice to their own tribe or sect, exclusively. They think it highly superior to all others: in their overweening impudence, augmented by ignorance and super stition, they have recourse to its sanction on most occasions to injure Christians ; and rely on their plenitude of faith to exculpate or rather to expiate their own most abominable vices. About eight miles from Nuckshywaun there is a descent toward a beautiful plain, well watered and cultivated, extending east and west many miles: here the traveller first beholds Mount Ararat in all its splendour, rearing its head like a cone-shaped cloud far above every eminence in the wide expanse around. It seems like a point of junction between the heavens and the earth. In consequence of the attraction of this stupendous mass, clouds are seen impending over it when the sky is elsewhere clear ; and frequently an aggregation of storm-clouds may be seen, from which lightning is silently emitted, the thunder not being heard at so remote a distance. These vivid flashes, through the vaporous and gloomy veil, seem to threaten a de luge to the fertile vale beneath. The summits of Ararat, for there are two, one lower than the other, are covered with perpetual snow, to about one third of the altitude of the principal mountain. There is something indescribably awful in their aspect when invested with clouds emitting lightning, while all else beneath this Asiatic sky, from the zenith to the horizon, is still, sultry, and serene ; and while the arid and parched expanse of almost herbless soil, seems perennially thirsting for a shower. In contemplating this sublime object, the mind dwells involuntarily on that mysterious tradition, held “ devoutly true” by the people of this region, that the ark of Noah still rests in the snow on the inaccessible heights of Ararat;MOUNT ARARAT. 227 and the imagination adverts at the same time to that tremendous visitation which depopulated the earth, reserving a single family as the germ of its future generations. They who traverse land and sea, for the purpose of beholding objects which history has consecrated may pause here ; for this is the central point, the nucleus from which the families and tribes and nations of mankind have sprung. The time at which the principal mountain appears peculiarly striking, is at dawn, when its brow seems as if streaming with light, that glides along the sharp ridges and furrows of snow which diverge from the peak. The first rays of the sun give to the snow a rosy glowing tint, heightened perhaps by contrast with the cold grey hue that at this hour pervades all objects in the distance. The lower part of the mountain is then in shadow, except the gentle acclivity near its base, covered by grass, which here and there catch ing the light, seems to emerge partially from the surrounding obscu rity. I attempted to make a drawing of it at sunrise, but despaired of giving an adequate idea of its grandeur, or of representing it in its due distance. The smaller hills or rather rocky mountains, which are below it, within ten or fifteen miles of its base, are of a different aspect, their surface being of reddish rock, without any vegetation except what serves to characterize the deep and sheltered chasms. When they are reached by the sun’s rays, however, they then serve by their yellow lights and impurpled shades, to show the great dis tance and magnitude of Mount Ararat, which retains its cold ground. In Nuckshywaun are the remains of a very extensive city, observ able in the traces of fortifications, kenauts, and minarets. There is a ruined tower sixty feet high, and thirty in diameter, which is of great antiquity. The present town seems indeed to stand on the ruins of a former one, which are evident from the chasms, arches, and frag ments of walls occurring among the foundations. Mount Ararat is seen from hence, in the extreme distance. June 30th. — On leaving this place the road led, for the first eight miles, over a desert of hills destitute of vegetation, and after wards across a grassy plain. At eighteen miles we observed the vil- g g 2228 DAIVULLOO. lage of Khorg, in a valley, about a mile and a half distant, and at twenty miles close on the right, the ruined caravansera and village of Karabaugloo. We descended on the left into a very fine valley, well cultivated and full of villages. At twenty-seven miles we found a ruined village, and in this part of the valley observed many streams running to the left. The road here again diverged from N.N.W. to north, along the barren heights and hills on the right, the cultivated ground lying to the left. At thirty miles and a half we began to traverse a number of rapid and fordable streams, occupying a breadth of three quarters of a mile, and together forming the river Arpa Chia, which rises in Ally Guz and the mountain of Karabaug. Here the road turns to the westward. At thirty-two miles we halted at the village of Noorasheen Soofla, situated about one mile to the left of Doodhungea. It has a stream close on the right, running in that direction. The village, which is nearly new, and scarcely finished, has abundance of fruit trees, and affords good accommodation. Here, in the evening, I took another view of Mount Ararat, and of the villages, hills, and plains below it. July 1st.—At night we departed for DaivulJoo, after having been detained for some time by a storm of thunder, lightning, rain, and wind. We immediately crossed the rivulet running from the left, and for the first four miles proceeded through low and muddy ground, much intersected by streamlets for irrigation. Afterwards we gradu ally ascended to a pass among barren and stony hills, and at fourteen miles observed the village of Shadatek, situated under hills about three quarters of a mile to the right. The road then continued over a fine flat plain, having hills on the right, and swampy plains ex tending on the left to the base of Mount Ararat. We arrived at Daivulloo, a straggling village on the south base of a detached rocky hill, having beyond it open plains to the Arras river, and to Mount Ararat. The distance on the right is eight miles to the foot of the hills, which are backed by rocky mountains, connecting with them, or separated by an interval of little more than a mile. In conse quence of the heavy rain of the preceding night, the ground wasERIVAN. 229 exceedingly wet and muddy. We were accommodated at Daivulloo in an open shed, which, though not very convenient, was acceptable in the present weather, which was very hot in the middle of the day, and cool at night, though not unpleasantly so. We were here joined by Mr. Strachey, who, we rejoiced to find, had given up his former intention of going by way of Turkey, in consequence of the present unsettled state of the country on the route thither, particularly near the city of Arzeroom, the Padshaw of which had died about a month previous, and his treasure was now at Erivan. The opening and plundeiing of the English packet at that place, about ten or twelve days before this period, was a circumstance very little expected, and being unpiecedented, was to travellers an occasion of great alarm and apprehension. July 2d. We set out at night for Erivan, distant thirty miles, proceeding over a level country, well cultivated, and much inter sected by streamlets and rivulets rather muddy. At fourteen miles we passed through the remains of extensive fortifications distinguish able only by mounds, like tumuli, at regular distances, and by stone walls, which extended across the road. The place is now called Topra Keella, and is, by some, supposed to be the Artaxita of the ancients; but it answers rather to the description of Tibirum, on account of its distance from Eaivulloo. At four miles farther we passed the Armenian village of Alias Khoosh, and then crossed the Guerney, a very rapid river, three quarters of a mile from the village, on the opposite of a valley of swampy appearance. The stream divided into two branches, each thirty yards broad, but fordable. Throughout this day’s march we had the swampy valley, covered with pasturage, on our left, extending to the foot of Ararat, uninterrupted by heights. Through this valley runs the Arras. We ascended a little from the rivulet, and continued to traverse the plains by a very good road. At twenty-eight miles we came to the houses forming the suburbs of Erivan, which is a very large straggling town, having a separate fortification, with double walls, towers, and a covered way to the southward ; and a town to the north of it commanded by hills230 ERIVAN. that bound it in the same direction. We turned off to the right to the quarter occupied by the Armenians, which is called Aunabad, where the Armenian Bishop has a house and a church. We here obtained excellent accommodations, and were well supplied with food and other necessaries. The head man of Erivan, named Hoossein Khaun, sent us an invi tation to visit him, which we promised to do when the Surdar had sent us cattle for the transport of our baggage. Ihis is the man who defended the fort against the Bussians under General Godovitch, in 1808, a service of which he feels very proud. The Bussians had penetrated into the fort and palace, and were either killed 01 diiven out. The weather continued very hot in the day time, and agreeably cool at night. The town has numerous fine gardens and houses ; it contains many inhabitants, of whom the proportion of Armenians exceeds that of Mahomedans. These Christians of the Greek Church appear to live here in great security, as we observed a very great number of women and children around the church. The females here cover themselves up ; but are not so strict in shunning observ ation : their mouths, however, are screened by a cloth. The Persian dress, or vesture, is much used out of doors. The Armenians in general have fair complexions, and appear healthy and fresh-coloured. As our Mehmandaur’s order extended only to this place, we dis charged him with a present of ten tomauns, with which he seemed satisfied. Another man was sent to escort us. July 4th. — By ten at night we obtained fresh horses and departed for Ashterrek j we passed close under the fort, and then aftei ciossing a bridge ascended the high steep bank on the opposite side, the top of which appears nearly on a level with the terre-plain of the fort, and might be advantageously employed by an active enemy. From hence we turned to the northward, and passed up heights impending over the town. We continued along their tops by stony roads, and were here overtaken by a violent storm of hail, rain, and lightning, during which it became so dark and wet that the guides on horseASHTERREK. 231 back missed the road. After ziz-zagging over the country till day light, we perceived the Armenian village of Ashterrek on the right bank of the rivulet of the same name, which we crossed by a bridge erected against the side of a precipice of perpendicular basaltic rock which we had to descend in getting to the bridge. Having ascended on the opposite side, we halted in the house of the principal inha bitant of the village, and obtained excellent accommodations ; but as our order for horses, provisions, &amp;c. was not given us on this place, being made out for another, we were obliged to proceed again after having breakfasted, and dried our clothes at a large fire made for the purpose. Here we remarked several ruins of churches, all for tified ; and like the tomb-stones near them, they were of peculiar con struction. Some of these ruins are said to be one thousand years old. In this place, as in all Persia, there are manifest symptoms of decay; not one-fourth of the houses being inhabited or in habitable repair. In the present instance this desolation was in a great measure attributable to the Persians themselves, some of whom it appears were let loose on this and the neighbouring villages by the chief of Erivan, as a punishment for having joined or assisted the Russians during their last siege of that city. When the Russian forces retired toward Teflis, the Persian troops plundered and laid waste their own frontier. Many of the inhabitants, male and female, fled with the Russians, establishing themselves within their confines, and still remaining their vassals. The villages of these poor people now serve as winter quarters to the Turkish Illyauts, who pasture their flocks on the surrounding country. Among them are occasionally found a very few poor wretches of the Armenian fugitives who ven tured to return. It is obvious from the ruins of very large and well built churches, observable in great numbers in this place and the adjacent districts, that the population was once very numerous; and it is no less evident from the traces of semi-circular arches in these extensive ruins, that their founders were well instructed in the noble art of design, and were therefore probably a cultivated people. These232 WANDERING TRIBES OF THE KHORDS. buildings are of hewn stone of two or three different colours, as red, yellow, and black, disposed so as to form figures ; and the foundations are often of a harder substance, either basalt or granite. They are all erected on eminences, fortified, and at a considerable elevation above the surrounding houses, which have their basement stories more or less below ground, so that they appear as if defended by the citadel church. In the evening we departed, and went over some heights on the right of the same precipice or ravine to Anavauk, a village consisting of a few miserable huts near a large church in ruins, about five miles distant from Ashterrek. We put up at a miserable hovel, where we were detained by rain the whole day, the night, and the next day. We were in continual expectation of a messenger from Ibrahim Bey, a Khord chief, to whom the Surdar of Erivan had recommended us; but as none arrived, we dispatched a horseman back to him at Erivan, to obtain further positive orders, and to describe our condition to him. Here we began to perceive that the Surdar of Erivan possessed little or no sway over the chiefs of the wandering tribes of Khords who occupy this wild and desolate country, abounding in cattle and presenting numerous fastnesses. These Khords are the descendants of those who harassed the retreat of the ten thousand under Xe nophon, and annoyed the march of Alexander. They inherit the untameable spirit and predatory habits of their ancestors. Feeling themselves in sufficient force to disregard the control of any esta blished government, they asquiesce in a nominal subjection to Persia, in order that they may despoil at pleasure the Bussian ter ritory. The tract which they occupy is singularly adapted to their pursuits; it is situated on the conjunctive boundaries of Russia, Turkey, and Persia; a sort of undefined neutral ground, though politically speaking, an integral part of the latter kingdom. It would require the coercion and discipline of a much more effective sovereignty to reduce these Khords to order. Their marauding incursions into the territory of Russia may probably give rise to—IKARNI URREH. 233 some important changes; and it is thought the government of that empire will avail themselves of these grievances as a ground for additional dominion ; nor would it be surprising if they were to obtain a cession which should extend their boundaries southward to the river Arras. July 5th.—At eleven this day our horseman returned; and having through his influence got two of our horses changed, we mounted and set out for Abberhaun, though the weather was still unsettled and threatening. The first eight miles of road to the N. N. E. led along the right bank of the ravine of Ashterrek, a precipitous chasm of basaltic rock. We passed several ruined churches, and observed an encampment of Illyauts at the foot of the snowy mountain of Ally Guz, on our left. We were now on a range of high hilly land connecting that mountain with another, apparently insulated on our right, called Kami Urreh. We had previously crossed two branches of the Ashterrek river, rising in Ally Guz; one of them by a stone bridge of a single semi-circular arch of forty feet span. Though there is nothing left of the masonry of this bridge, except the single course of stones forming the arch, in which there are breaches and crevices in many places, yet laden cattle are driven over without apprehension. The arch is semi-circular, and the stones that form it extremely well jointed. Our present path was not the high road, which in fact we had left on the stormy night when we quitted Erivan, and had gone to the westward of it in the march to Ash terrek. We had however the satisfaction of traversing a country of hills and vales, most luxuriantly covered with grasses of all kinds, interspersed with dowers of delightful odour and hues. There is an excellent spot for a station of defence, formed by the approximation of two deep rocky ravines of the Ashterrek, and terminating at the confluence of their streams into the river of that name. This tongue of land is a natural strong hold, that might be greatly improved by erecting dams to retain the water in the ravines, and thus render the place a peninsula, of which the land approach would be a very narrow isthmus. It is of a commanding elevation, H H234 TENT OF A KHORDISH CHIEFTAIN. and is centrally situated between two mountains, or in fact in the middle of a pass, though not the principal one, near the frontiers. Hence we continued for some miles along high ground, and then began gradually to descend toward very extensive plains surrounded by mountains, all covered with luxuriant pasture. Here a post might be advantageously fixed; and the valley ought to be occupied by two or three regiments of cavalry, as the hills in every direction command and defend the situation, which, unlike the greatest part of Persia, produces inexhaustible stores of forage. There is another, and doubtless a much better road to the eastward of Kami Urreh. We entered upon it on the left bank of the prin cipal branch of the Ashterrek, about five miles distant from the encampment-ground at the ruined church of Abberhaun. From hence to the opening between two mountains through which the river passes, that is, for three miles, the country continues plain and covered with pasture. It was occupied by several encampments of Illyauts and Khords in black and white tents, some of which had split reed walls painted; others had walls of the same black hair cloth which formed the remainder of the tent. We saw some tents with reed mats for walls, and having roofs covered with felts like the Tartar tents. Here we were met and accosted by Khords well mounted, dressed and armed like Turks. The whole race are eques trians. About two miles to the right o£ the road there is a copper mine now worked by private individuals, who pay for this privilege. The Khords, who were very free and easy in their address, wore long red caps, or rather bags, the ends of which hung down behind their heads. Within the last four miles we proceeded through two rocky passes between hills, having the river on our left; and after a march of thirty miles, arrived at the chaddoor or tent of the principal Khordish Khaun or chieftain. He was a person of a fine portly figure; he received us standing outside, with a Turkish pipe in his mouth, surrounded by attendants, over the heads of whom his women were peeping from the sides of the tent. It was a very large and com modious one, divided into three apartments by curtains, and alto-235 RUINS OF TliE CHURCH OF ABBERHAUN. gether about forty feet long by twenty broad. One side of the floor we saw covered with nummuds or felts, on which the men had been sitting; on the other side we saw the women, some spinning and knitting, others staring at us strangers. The middle apartment was covered by nummuds and carpets for the reception of visitors, but no one was in it. The chief received the information which our guide had to give him from the commandant at Erivan, with a smile of apparent satis faction ; but he never once conversed with us or asked us to sit down. Even Illyauts would certainly have done that act of courtesy. He told our people he was sorry that it was too late now (seven o’clock!) to pitch a tent for us, and that we should find sufficient accom modation in the ruins of a church close at hand, where, if we thought proper to put up for the night, he would send us all that we wanted. But he afterwards refused us a change of horses or an escort of men, and withheld every other assistance; nor would he, after we had halted, give us even milk, fowls, or other provisions for money. Doubtless, both this man and Ibrahim Bey were too powerful and haughty to care for the Sirdar of Erivan, who must have been aware that he could not controul these freebooters, even while he pretended to send them positive orders. We went round a little hill, near which in a small swamp were the springs of the Ashterrek, and having thus avoided crossing that river, we arrived at the ruins of the church of Abberhaun. Here was no resting-place but what was wet and filthy; no cover but the impend ing parts of arches, broken at a height of 20 feet above us; it was cold and wet, both under foot and over head ; the wood given to us was too damp to burn, and we were for a longtime shivering and sickening with the chill of this comfortless place. At length, however, about eleven at night, the fire was made to burn ; tea was prepared, and a repast was made of two boiled fowls between three of us; after which we went to our beds, wet as they were, and as soon as they had become sufficiently warm, we were able to sleep very soundly. h h 2 ; ^ •236 ENTER THE RUSSIAN TERRITORY. The Khord chief was so pertinacious in his ill behaviour to us, that he would not even furnish us with a guide for our next day’s journey. Before taking leave of Persia, let me remark that its population consists of two distinct classes ; that dwelling in towns and villages, which may be termed the Persian inhabitants; and the wandering or nomade tribes, which, though spoken of under the appellation of Illyauts, or as Maumehsunies, Loors, and Buktiaries, are all accustom ed to the same pastoral life, spring from Tartar origin, and speak the Turkish language. The rapid decline of the Persian part of the popu lation has been already noticed as indicated in the almost deserted state of the villages and the faded splendour of the towns, which are all more or less sinking to ruin and decay. But I have no reason to think that the nomade tribes are declining in the same manner; and their exemption from such fate shows that the cause exists in the govern ment, which neither does nor can oppress any ol the inhabitants but those who are settled in towns and villages. All the tribes of Illyauts are free from such vexations, and the only duty exacted from them is to furnish a certain number of horsemen for His Majesty’s service. These are mostly of the Buktiari tribe. In fact the habits of these tribes are likely to ensure to them their property, and a permanent occupation of the country, while the Persians seem doomed to dwindle away by emigrations, and may at no distant period be found only in the north eastern provinces now belonging to them, but which may then be subdivided into petty states and perhaps attached to other adjacent governments. July 6th.—We moved at four in the morning for Kara Klissia, distant thirty miles. At about six or eight miles from the church which we had left, we began to ascend the mountains which form the Persian boundarv. At the foot of them was a ruined church and fort, where we quitted the Persian, and entered the Russian territory. Here forage was plentiful on the hills and in the vales, but the acclivities were high and steep, and the paths were narrow. We had on our left another, and I believe a much better road, though perhaps not well known to our people; but we chose the shortest, whichKARA KLISSIA. 237 however led up and down mountain after mountain for sixteen miles, and afterwards continued along the bottom of a valley, by a rapid rivulet, the course of which we followed. It was bounded on both sides by rocky mountains ; those that appeared in the latter part of the route were covered with wood in a most luxuriant manner. The ground bore a profusion of flowers, among which was the yellow lily of extraordinary size and beauty, in high blow. Among the trees we found almost all the fruit-trees and shrubs of Europe growing wild; their fruits, however, were eaten and relished by the natives. There were strawberries, cherries, plums, pears, walnuts, and hazel-nuts of the largest size. This valley extended to Hajee Kaura, where it became rather more open, and the state of the cultivation and roads indicated the influence of a much superior government. We now passed round a hill on our right, and entered an extensive valley bounded by high mountains to the northward, and intersected by a rapid river. We had observed, that about one mile before our arrival at Hajee Kaura, the stream that we had so far traced took a direction to our left. We again entered upon it before we reached Kara Klissia, which was six miles beyond the last-mentioned place, and thirty from our former station. Immediately on our arrival at Kara Klissia, we waited on the Colonel commandant with letters for the commanding officer, who was absent. Being now in the Russian territory, we were glad to avail ourselves of the order given by the Ambassador for us to be fur nished at every station with a change of horses. These stations, appointed at different distances, are formed of Cossacks who are em ployed in carrying public dispatches. When on the road they walk and lead their horses by the bridle, which are loaded with baggage like post-horses. We had not provided ourselves with Russian currency, and therefore changed our ducats for silver roubles, a coin resembling the dollar, to of which we received three for the ducat. As the country extending from hence across the mountains of the Caucasus to Alosdock is not considered as in Russia Proper, the post-238 KARA KLISSIA. horses are to be paid for in silver roubles instead of paper assignats, which are so depreciated that one rouble in silver is worth four in paper, although the latter were originally of the same value. Kara Klissia is a miserable village, and of no importance except as a station for Russian troops ; they consist of one brigade of the line, and a small body of Cossacks. The place is low and muddy; all the houses are built of timber, so mortised as to form strong walls, and their roofs are covered with earth. The ground floors of them all, even of those in which the soldiers are quartered, are sunk to the depth of about three feet. Upon the whole we were worse off here than even in Persia. Not a shelter could we procure until the Colonel commandant put us into part of a house occupied by a junior officer: but here no one could understand us, and there was only one young gentleman that spoke French with whom we could exchange a word. We, however, obtained our passports, with orders for horses, and were able to set out by seven next morning. Among the difficulties that now occurred, there was one against which we had not provided ; our boxes were not in bags so coupled as to be thrown across the saddles of the Cossacks. We therefore bought ropes and tapes, with which we tied them two by two for the purpose of being thus carried; but even with the lightest load our servants were not permitted to ride. We therefore determined on arranging our baggage so as to have two horses almost unburthened, and to take another horse for the third servant at each post at which we changed. We found no difficulty in making this arrange ment. The young officer who spoke a Kttle French was sent with us to Teflis, and every thing was done by the commandant at Kara Klissia to assist us. General Yermoloff had given us letters to Prince Semitzawaradin, (a Georgian, I believe,) but we did not see him, and we understood he was gone to Gomry. The bread which we found here was black and heavy; we had some fowls and eggs, but no good meat or fruits.CIVILITY OF THE COSSACKS. 239 July 7th.—We set out for Oozunlar, distant twenty-four miles, at seven in the morning. Immediately below the town we forded the river, near a bridge of two tiers, and proceeded by a path along the left bank, over narrow and frequently dangerous precipices, having the river close below on the right. This road continued to the first post stage, distant twelve miles, in reaching which, as the ground was very uneven, we were nearly four hours. Here we changed horses, and proceeded twelve miles farther, to Oozunlar, which we reached in three hours. A few miles beyond the first station, we crossed a deep rapid river by a well-built stone bridge of one semi-circular arch, evi dently of Armenian construction, as there were two crosses, one on the bridge and the other at a little distance on the rocky height adjoining. Within five miles of Oozunlar, the road entered upon a well cultivated plain extending to that village, which is large, and has a spacious ruined church near it. The inhabitants are Armenians. On the right we observed a deep ravine, through which flowed a rapid stream ; and it was curious to remark that one side of this ravine con sisted of a precipice of basaltic rock, nearly four hundred feet per pendicular, while the opposite side was of granite, and sloped re gularly down to the river’s margin. The Russian itinerary measure is the werst, equal to about two thirds of a mile. The rate charged per werst here was two copecks of silver each. At all the posts we found bread, fowls, and eggs, which the Cossacks with great kindness dressed for us. In mention ing these troops I must not omit to say, that they appear to be the most useful of any for such a country as this. Both officers and men are far from being fastidious with respect to their quarters, and are easily satisfied: the post station at which we now were, certainly had not accommodation equal to that assigned to the serjeants in our service, and yet the officer in command was a Major. The men very cheerfully and with great alacrity loaded their own horses with our baggage, and on the road were particularly attentive; they endeavoured to anticipate all our wants, and even wishes, gathering fruits and flowers for us wherever those objects attracted our notice.240 CHEECHKAUN. July 8th.—Our next journey was to Sholavera, distant thirty-four miles. We departed at day-break* accompanied by the Cossack officer; and after passing through the village, and a cultivated plain beyond it for about three quarters of a mile, we began to descend along the side of a mass of perpendicular basalt by a road constructed of stone. We of course dismounted and led our horses, proceeding in this manner for a mile, with the river before mentioned on our right. About half a mile farther we crossed a rivulet by a brdge, and afterwards ascended a high mountain. At the sixth mile we crossed the river by a bridge of Armenian structure, and then continued along its right bank to sixteen miles; here we forded it with some difficulty, as the stream was deep, rapid, and one hundred and fifty yards in breadth. We ascended an eminence, and at eighteen miles arrived at the post of Cheechkaun in an elevated situation. There were silver mines about six wersts distant, which were worked by contract and were not found very productive. Mines of lead have also been opened in this district. The country is covered with wood, and among the trees are those of the wild walnut, the hazel nut, plums, cherries, and pears. On this march I had an oppor tunity of observing the great difference in form between the hills of granite and those of basalt. The first were almost in every instance conical and acuminated; the others consisted of horizontal strata in steps or terraces, with sides nearly perpendicular. It has been already stated, that at Oozunlar one side of the chasm of the river was perpendicular and of basalt, and that the other which sloped to the water’s edge was of granite: this slope was covered with verdure. Over these heights it was impossible to travel at a quicker rate than three* miles an hour. At six miles farther the hills terminated, and the road became much better. Near this post we found superior accommodations at a large village, which had a bazar where articles of provision were to be had in great plenty of good quality. In Armenian villages, the houses are built with their floors two or three feet below the level of the street, with roofs of earth eitherARMENIAN VILLAGES. 241 flat or lounded; and as they are open on one side, it is the custom to keep a number of fierce watch-dogs, whose barkings do not tend much to soothe the repose of persons who are not accustomed to ^ them. The caits of this country are of a peculiar construction. They aie about twelve feet long, broad behind, and narrowing to a point in front. They have wooden wheels about four feet in diameter, without iron tires; the spokes and naves are large, and the axle-tree, which is of wood, is made fast to the wheel and turns with it. The naves are girt with wooden hoops. The vessels of earthen-ware still used by these people, and borne on the shoulder by many of the women, are of very elegant design, and resemble those antique specimens which are from time to time dug up from ruins. The substance of the ware is white, and of a very good kind. The men and the women when grown up, or after twenty years of age, become coarse-featured, and their skins are much shrivelled. The necks of the women are thin, like those of the Hottentots; they paint their faces red and white, and puncture their skins in various figures; but their children, to the age of seventeen or eighteen, are beautiful to a great degree, and have a fiifj bloom on their cheeks. The shepherds who tend their flocks on the wilds carry their draught-water in wooden flasks on their backs. As the Cossacks are not accustomed to travel by night themselves, they cannot be depended upon when they undertake to wake a tra veller at an appointed hour. We tried them several times and they failed us. If left to themselves they never brought the horses until broad day-light in the morning. July 9th.—Teflis, the object of our next march, was distant thirty-seven miles. We proceeded eighteen miles and a half to Kodi, which we reached in four hours; and as there was only a non-com missioned officer at this station, we found very little accommodation, and breakfasted in a garden. We again set out, and within about half a mile from this post we descended to a natural basin or lake242 ARRIVAL AT TEFLIS. that appeared to be of salt, having water only at one end. It was entirely encompassed and shut in by hills, and was in length eight miles, and in breadth four. After crossing it we ascended unculti vated heights destitute of trees, and at nine miles further came to the post of Soganlook, close to the river Koor. This place has no accom modation for travellers. The road led hence along the right bank of the Koor, and between it and some high hills to Teflis. About one from that town we were detained for forty minutes at a cjuaian- tine station. The distance from Soganlook to Teflis we found to be eight miles and a half; the road throughout this short march proved to be uncommonly good. Passing through the town we were met by the servant of the prin cipal Armenian resident, who conducted us to the house of his master, at which, by invitation, we put up. He was the son of Arratoon Issaya Khaun, a man particularly well disposed toward the English, to whom we had letters, and who, we were shocked to learn, had been recently killed by lightning. The house was excellent, and was situated in the quarter inhabited by the General and the Gover nor, being near both their residences. As we were now in the capi tal of Georgia, we sent our letters to General Koutousoff, who received us most politely next morning, and gave us an invitation to dine with him, which we accepted. It is gratifying to add, that from respect to us simply as British officers, he showed us every possible attention ; and began immediately by enquiring our wishes, which he promptly assisted us to realize. Indeed I have very rarely expe rienced such disinterested urbanity, and so evidently proceeding from a sincere wish to be of service to us as Englishmen. Every day during our halt at Teflis, he gave us some fresh mark of his good ness of heart, and of his obliging disposition. In the evening, on this first introduction, the General, imagining that we were not suffi ciently well accommodated with our Armenian host, offered us a house which was then fitting up for himself, which he very kindly took us with him to view, and walked with us through the bazars, and through the best part of the town, pointing out every thing worthyDRESS OF THE LADIES OF GEORGIA. 243 of our notice. We could not, however, accept this hospitable offer of a house, from respect to our Armenian host, who had ever shown himself favourable to Englishmen, and testified a particular solicitude for our welfare. July 11th.—We were again invited to dinner by General Koutousoff, who told us he expected we should consider ourselves as his guests. In the evening we visited the Governor, who was just then returned from the country. At six we went to pass the remainder of the evening at the house of Prince Baiboodoff, a Georgian Prince, where we saw his family of ladies, and were entertained with observing a variety of dances peculiar to the different tribes inhabiting the region of the Caucasus. Some of these dances were performed by Geor gian young men ; and among them there were two ladies, who, to a slower measure, executed a sort of formal stately movement of no interest. These exercises were performed by the ladies and gentle men merely at General Koutousoff’s request, in order to show us the Georgian style of dancing. The dress of the ladies was unbecoming to a very great degree; it was much in the style of our very oldest fashions, exhibiting long waists and flat chests ; and in fact displaying none of the contour of the female form, except by a kind of narrow shawl tied round the loins. Their countenances were much disfigured by the formally arched eye-brows, and their head-dresses were utterly ungraceful, being somewhat in the shape of an inverted bowl or mortar, a mere truncated cone. Their raiment was of silk, and their slippers, with high heels, were painted green and blue. In the deportment of these ladies there was altogether an extreme coldness, amounting to more than mere reserve, purposely assumed no doubt for the occasion, which they thought would not allow of any degree of ease and freedom of manner; nor was it unlikely that they would rejoice to divest them selves of so much formal restraint. This adherence to Moorish customs is to be expected among the inhabitants of a country so long under the yoke of the Mahomedans. Four or five men with musical instruments of a construction resembling the guitar or violin, and with a double drum, played for i i 2244 GEORGIAN ROUTE. the dancers, and sung at the intervals when the dancing was sus pended. All the bystanders clapped their hands in accord with the movement, and seemed entirely to relish the music. Drams and wine were freely drank by the whole company, and a long table loaded with fruits and sweetmeats, was brought in for the refreshment of the guests. The General and all the principal officers of Teffis, were invited to this Georgian route, which, from the display it gave of the costume and manners of the country, was to me a very novel and interesting spectacle. Respecting the beauty of the Georgian women, which oriental fabulists and poets, as well as their imitators, by common consent extol, I had been led to form a less exaggerated notion ; and therefore was not much disappointed on finding that those we saw had no pretensions to it at all.CHAPTER XIV.

ALL PERSONS GO ARMED IN GEORGIA.—OBSTACLES TO THE CIVILIZATION OF THE CAUCASIAN TRIBES. A perpetual bar to our enjoyments was the anxiety which we felt to prosecute our journey with as little delay as possible, and which here urged us to take advantage of the post which was to leave Teflis on Sunday the 13th. As the post is always dispatched under a strong guard of Cossacks, our wish was to avail ourselves of their protection, and thus avoid giving the trouble of furnishing us with a separate guard. We had also some hopes of overtaking Mr. Strachey, who having quitted us at Kara Klissia, arrived at Teflis a few days before us, obtained his passports, and two days afterwards, being provided with a separate escort, departed for Mosdok. In order to make the necessary arrangements, we took the intervening day, the 12th, to ourselves, applied for our passports, and got as many of our ducats changed into paper-money as would be necessary to carry us through Russia. The ducat was here worth twelve roubles, while in other parts of the empire, where paper is more in demand, it is said to obtain no more than ten roubles sixty copecks. In order to be entirely246 FLOODS FROM MOUNTAIN SNOWS. at our ease we dined at the tavern, where we had an excellent repast in the French style, for two roubles two copecks (or about five shillings) a head, including jellies, fruit, and two bottles of wine. Being led to expect better accommodations at the Russian posts than we had found in travelling through Persia, we determined to disencumber ourselves of beds and every other article of baggage not absolutely requisite on the road, and therefore gave them as a perquisite to our servants. We procured cases to be made for the carriage of our trunks on the horse-saddles of the Cossacks ; took out certificates of health for ourselves, and passes for the return of our servants to Persia. We also laid in a small supply of sugar, tea, and other provisions for the ensuing journey. It is here necessary to remark, that as in Persia the severity of the preceding winter was indicated by deeper snow than had been known for many years, so in Georgia and on the Caucasus, from the same cause, the meltings of the snows had swoln the rivers to a greater height than they had reached within the last forty years. We were informed that many gentlemen had come thus far in carriages, and we were very desirous to purchase one for ourselves, as we had now travelled on horseback with the same horses nearly two thousand miles. Several carriages of different constructions were offered to us, and we had agreed for an excellent barouche, bought at Peters burg, and now in good condition, for two thousand roubles, when intelligence was brought that one half of the stone bridge over the Terek at Vladi Kaukass was carried away by the torrent, which had likewise so broken up and destroyed the roads, as to render travelling in a carriage at that time impracticable ; and as the necessary repairs upon them would require two or three months to complete them, we determined to continue our route on horseback. We considered this the more expedient, as it would tend to our greater security against the Oossetian banditti, who committed depredations on the road through the region of the Caucasus.

The site is very favourable, being on the side of a large hill, and having the river Koor on the lowest part. The general direction of the streets is N. W. and S. E. Its celebrated hot springs produce a stream which runs through one side of the town, and there supplies several baths erected in the Georgian style. The water, after flowing from them, is used by al most all descriptions of people for washing their persons and their clothes. The hot stream is allowed to pass continually through the baths, and therefore there is a constant supply of tepid water. We went early in the morning to these baths, and found them very de lightful ; the water however is sulphuric, and in smell resembles that of Cheltenham. It was lamentable to observe that the buildings of the baths were in a state of neglect and decay. The windows had been broken, which admitted fresh air, and this is inconvenient to bathers as it occasions them to cool too soon. The principal cistern of the waters is below the level of the floor; the bather descends into it, and after staying a short time, he quits it, and is rubbed down by the attendants in the manner practised at Tehraun, in Persia. He then enters another rather cooler bath, and at last returns to that which he began with. The water, each time a person enters, feels at first rather hotter than the body can agreeably bear. In the summer season the town of Teflis is very hot; the water for drinking is neither clear nor very good tasted; it is procured from the river Koor, and is doubtless impregnated by the mineral springs which fall into it above the town ; and of these it is said there are many. On the opposite bank of the river are the suburbs, consisting of the houses of the poorer sort of Mahomedans or Tartars. They are connected with the town by a wooden bridge, at a very considerable height over the river. The great attention which is now paid to the improvement of248 IMPROVEMENTS IN GEORGIA. Georgia will no doubt add many articles of manufacture to its exports; among others those of glass and leather are in contem plation. At present it furnishes wines in abundance, embroidery, steel arms and armour, horse furniture ; and it is particularly noted for fine furs, of which I believe the black fur forms one, and for yapoonchees, a species of cloaks of black felt, with an external nap of long black hair ; these sell, according to the fineness of their tex ture and finish, from five to ten roubles each. As Georgia affords abundance of copper from the many mines now working, it is the intention of the government to encourage the manufacture of copper ware at Teflis, as an article of commerce. In fact, so large is the quantity of copper now on hand that they are casting statues with it, under the superintendence of an Italian artist, of considerable merit, who receives a salary from the government. I believe they have also begun to cast small field-pieces. I remarked in these districts a breed of goats, bearing a long silky fleece, and having nearly the same characteristics with the goats of Kermaun, and, I believe, the same with those of Cashmere. As the climate and pastures of the mountains of Caucasus will no doubt be found congenial to these animals, the woollen manufacture will of course be an object deserving the care and cultivation of this wise and attentive government. Coarse woollens are manufactured even at present, so that the fabric is already introduced, and needs only to be perfected as to quality and texture. The views of Russia, with regard to this country, seem to tend towards establishing it as an entrepot for European commodities; as a mart for the produce of the surrounding countries, and in par ticular for the supply of Persia and Turkey. To prepare for realizing these views, men of abilities have been employed in tra versing the country, and in ascertaining the most eligible lines of communication between Georgia and the Black Sea on one side, and the Caspian on the other, availing themselves, as far as may be prac ticable, of the course of the rivers. The grand obstacles to the speedy success of these schemes ofPREDATORY TRIBES OF LESGUAYS. 249 improvement appear to be the local situation and the present lawless manners of the different tribes of inhabitants. Possessing as they do a region bordering on Turkey and Persia, and backed by the moun tains of the Caucasus, they are likely to remain long unsubdued, particularly as they are surrounded by the Khords, Lesguays, Cir cassians, and other tribes who are as free, lawless, and warlike as their ancestors in the time of the Romans, twenty centuries ago. The first effort of Russia may perhaps be to obtain possession of as much of Persia and Turkey as will cause their boundaries to recede, in consequence of the appropriation of an intermediate tract of country. The next step may be that of ensuring a preponderance of a population of Christians of the Greek church, that is of Ar menians and Georgians, from both countries, Persia and Turkey. If in doing this the Russians establish free seminaries for instruction, they may in time succeed in inducing the Circassians to send their youth thither to be instructed in reading and writing, and thus be rendered Christians and friends, instead of Mahomedans and invete rate enemies. The Georgian roads are now much exposed to the predatory irruptions of the Lesguays, a hardy tribe, who as they scorn the re finements and luxuries of domestic life, and disdain the questionable enjoyments of wine and liquors, are unfettered by the influence of those seductions which operate so powerfully on other children of nature. To the credit, and no doubt also tending to the internal peace and unanimity of the Russian government, several Georgian officers of distinction are promoted to the rank of general officers in the Russian service, and employed in commands and situations of trust in that empire. There are actually several young boys, the children of the principal families of the Caucassian tribes, now living under the protection of the officer commanding at Teflis, who employs them about his person as subalterns in order to attach them to him. The career of preferment is fully open to them, and they may aspire to250 PAPER MONEY OF RUSSIA. the highest commands with the same degree of hope as it they were Russians by birth and descent. It has been already intimated, that the paper money of Russia is to be bought here on rather favourable terms ; and here therefore the traveller ought to provide himself with a sufficiency for his jouine} to the opposite frontier. We received for each ducat after the i ate of three roubles of silver or twelve of paper; or rather 26 silver roubles were worth 100 roubles in assignats. But it must be remembered that Georgia requires money of Persia, and therefore bills on that country are always acceptable, and somewhat advantageous. Peisia in like manner requires cash in India, and of course Indian bills sell generally to advantage in Persia. In the latter country the Venetian ducat passes for six reals or Persian rupees, whereas that coin may be frequently bought in the Indian markets on much lower ter ms, ge nerally at about 41 Bombay rupees. On entering Georgia, a passport is required from the Biitish lesi- dent in Persia: at Teffis this document is examined, and another is given to the traveller in Russian ; if he be desirous that his clothes or valuable effects should not be fumigated at the quarantines, it will be necessary for him to have them examined at the nearest principal town or here, and then sealed. A padrojna, or road-pass and order for post- horses, is also to be taken up here, for all that part of the route which extends through the Russian dominions. That which we pro cured was to serve from Mosdok to Lemberg, for which payment was made at once, at the rate of 2 copecks (paper money) per werst, for each horse. For 1902 wersts, we paid 152 roubles, 20 copecks. On Sunday, July 13th, the post left Teflis for Mosdok with a guard, and we followed it, after dining with General Koutousoff, who, I believe, through politeness retarded its departure a little, and ac commodated us with a separate guard, commanded by an officer. We took our leave of him on horseback, at three o clock, having previously sent off our baggage on four post-horses, for which we paid two copecks silver each, per werst, besides that which we hadRUINS OF MSCHETTA. 251 before paid being the Emperor’s duty of two copecks per werst for each horse which we intended to take on through Russia, according to the route stated by us, which was from Mosdok to Lemberg ; the intervening distance from Mosdok to our present station Teflis, being considered beyond the confines of Russia Proper, was paid for as al ready noticed in silver roubles, about four times the value of those of paper. At about four miles from the town we crossed a branch of the river Koor, flowing from the left by a wooden bridge. The road continued along the right bank of the Koor. At fifteen miles we crossed by a bridge another river, called the Arragua, and about a quarter of a mile beyond it, passed through the remains of the former capital of Georgia, called Mschetta, which stands at the confluence of the Koor and the Arragua. In the centre of the town there is a very large ancient church, and near it a cemetry containing the tombs of the Kings of Georgia. On the summit of a conical moun tain to the eastward of the church, there are the ruins of a monastery, and within half a mile of them, on the left of the road, those of another church. They were originally no doubt within the precincts of the town. At eighteen miles we arrived at the post of Hartsiskel, where we changed horses. The road to it, which was extremely, good, con tinued along the right bank of the Koor, which was sometimes half a mile distant from us, foaming and rapidly rolling its dark coloured waters. On this march we crossed several smaller streamlets towards Duchett, two of them were of mineral waters, having an acid and sulphuric taste. On the plains about a mile from the post, we crossed a small branch of the Koor, flowing from the left. The mountains near us were all well wooded, and the plains were covered with herbage and flowers. Hartsiskel is situated on a plain five miles in diameter, extending east and west. On the heights were frequently observed ruins of mo nasteries and churches, and they had all the appearance of having been fortified. This post has only a few huts and out-houses for stabling, and affords little or no accommodation to travellers. We K K 2252 DUCHETT. had reached this place in four hours and twenty-five minutes, having travelled at the rate of about six wersts an hour. After refreshing ourselves with tea, we again set out at half-past ten at night, and proceeded toward Duchett. The road was good until within about three quarters of a mile of that post, when we descended a hill and ascended another on which it is situated. Here we were accommodated in a convenient house, which had for merly been very spacious. On the outside of the fortified post, at which are stationed some infantry with a field-piece, under the command of an officer, there is a good bazar. We arrived here at three, and sle until six, when we breakfasted and resumed our journey. July 14th. — Our next route was toKashaoor, distant fifty-one wersts, or about thirty-four miles. On quitting the post of Duchett we began to ascend some high hills, partially bare or covered with grasses, and in some places shadowed by trees, exactly resembling the country on the top of the Ghauts, in Coorg or Wyenaud. The scenery occa sionally was much like that of a park. Although the inequalities of the country were steep and abrupt, we observed cart roads in every direction ; there were numerous hamlets in various situations, and on the heights were fortified villages and churches. We here ob served some specimens of the agriculture of the native Georgians. They were ploughing with ten pair of oxen and buffaloes, which ren dered turning difficult; their fields of grain are therefore extended longitudinally, I mean in proportion to the breadth, and sometimes they are seen a quarter of a mile long: but these extensive fields, without separate inclosures, combine and form vast cultivated spaces, the size of which is only proportionate to the grandeur of the surrounding mountain scenery. The plough had two wheels, one three feet in diameter, and the other ten inches; the axle-tree being of such extent as to allow the smaller wheel on the upper part of the accli vity, to keep pace with the larger one which ran in the rut below. The pole was fixed, not midway in the axle, but nearer the larger wheel, which alone turned on it. With this contrivance theyANNANOOR. 253 managed to plough the sides of the hills. We crossed several wooden bridges; the road throughout was good, but continually either up or down hills the whole way. Within about a mile of the post of An- nanoor, distant about twelve wersts from our last station, we crossed a river flowing from the left. The whole country is copiously watered. The village of Annanoor is situated on a small plain surrounded by hills and mountains : on an eminence directly overlooking it there is a fort in which the officer resides, this being a station for Cos sack horses. We here showed our passports as we had previously done at similar stations, and after changing horses, as usual, proceeded. Among the scenery around, we observed a fine effect of gradation and contrast of colour, which might have been well worth the study of a master in landscape. The highest hills, covered with verdure, were in deep shade, and partially veiled in mist; less distant were the villages with their white houses and cattle, in full light; the near ground, of yellow ochre tint, was also in light. The rocky parts were of granite, covered with white moss and occasional patches of green grass on the flat surface of the rocky masses, and also between them. The pro jecting rocks were in deep brown shade. The Georgians have a great number of bee-hives in the villages and on the flowery plains. They are of wicker work, tall and tapering, in shape resembling a truncated pyramid, having a hole at top for the ingress and egress of the bees. They are placed on flat rocks, or on a flooring of masonry. Much attention seems to be paid here to the propagation of these industrious and productive insects. We observed numerous little hovels all over the country contain ing corn mills, which, like those in Persia, were moved by a stream of water, acting laterally on a horizontal wheel. On quitting the small plain of Annanoor, we entered a deep valley between two high mountains, the road passing along the foot of that to the left hand, and having the river on the right. This grand defile extended to the post of Passanoor. In the course of it, on the peaks of almost all the detached hills and mountains, were seen towers,254 SCENERY OF THE COUNTRY. or ruins of churches. There were also a vast number of villages, or rather hamlets, situated on heights, several hundred yards above the road, having between them deep chasms, from which issued little torrents white with foam, thus possessing facilities of defence, and a convenient supply of water. The men of this region seem, like wild animals, to resort by preference to fastnesses difficult of approach, and commanding a view around, so as to be easily watched and guarded. Any spot so situated would be chosen for a hamlet, if sufficiently bare of trees, and flat enough for houses, which, how ever, in many instances, rise one above another. These heights are backed by high mountains, covered with dark green trees ; and the acclivities of the hills being fertilized by the melting of the snows, are either cultivated, or covered naturally with an even carpet of luxuriant grasses, like that which clothes the surface of the valleys. The pre dominant rocks were granite, basalt, limestone, and slate, much intermixed, and presenting a variety of surface and of colour, which tended greatly to enhance the beauty of these romantic views. The slate mountains were of a dark neutral tint, occasionally assuming crimson and purple hues; the granite of a light-neuter ; and the limestone of an ochre or terra sienna colour. These diversified tints and various forms were here and there so disposed as to produce the most beautiful effect on the landscape. Near the post we crossed two very considerable streams from the left, flowing toward the Koor, besides many small streamlets which traversed the road. Over all of them there were bridges v of wood, very strongly constructed and well put together, and most likely the work of the Russian soldiers. On the mountains we observed numerous cattle tracks ; and the deep cavities and recesses were filled with lofty trees. The road near Passangoon turns to the N. W. having mountains close on the right and left. We continued along a similar route from that station, having the river Arragua on the right, to within three miles of the post of Kashaoor, where, after crossing a bridge, we began to ascend a very steep road bounded on the left by a precipice the whole way, which overlooked the valley of the Arra-OOSSETIANS. 255 gua. On the tops and sides of the mountain were many fortified vil lages. Near Kashaoor are the remains of a fort said to have been built by Heraclius. The present Russian post is on a very high eminence, but does not as yet, (for they are improving it,) afford much accommo dation. We slept in a very small tent, which, from the excessive rain that had fallen during the night, was wet through ; and we were very uncomfortable. The weather was cold, and the more so in this situation by reason of the proximity of the snow-clad mountains. The country on the right and left of the road onward from this place, is occupied by the tribe of Ooss, or the Oossetians, a very daring, high- spirited, and untractable race of men. Their habits are very different from those of the Georgian villagers^ of whom we had met on the pre ceding marches some parties returning in the evening from their harvest-fields. They were singing hymns, after the manner of the Russian peasantry; their music was wild, but the different voices were well matched and sustained. The Georgians are accustomed to drink daily very great quantities of the wine of the country, which is weak and rather tart to the taste of a stranger; it is said that some Georgians will drink seven bottles of this wine in a day, without being intoxicated. We quitted the post at five in the morning, in a very dense mist or rather drizzling rain, which not only wetted us through, but rendered the roads muddy and slippery, and therefore difficult, as they con tinued on the ascent. We pursued this upward road for two hours, or about six miles, having deep precipices on our left, and hearing far below us the roaring and dashing of the unseen river Arragua. After winding along the acclivity of the mountain, we passed between two peaks that crown it, and there observed, on the left of the road, a cross of iron on a stone pediment. Beyond this there are some high mountains extending on the left of the cross, which marks the source of the Baidar river. We now began to descend toward the post of Koby, distant from our last station sixteen wersts or eleven miles. On this route we traversed some masses of snow and ice that had accumulated in chasms, and, on getting beyond them, perceived the256 PLAN OF POST-STATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY. rivulets rapidly flowing from beneath these natural bridges, arches of ice having formed themselves over the water-course which sustained the incumbent snow. We saw whole chasms thus filled with snow, from the bottom to the very verge of their precipitous sides. The whole of this line of road was good and broad; nor was it in any part so steep as the Ghauts in India generally are. Beyond the cross, the mountains present a total change of face ; they are rocky, steep, and frequently almost perpendicular, scantily clad with trees or herbage, except in the deep cavities. About a quarter of a mile beyond the post of Koby, the river Terek first comes near the road on the left, from a valley between two mountains to the northward. This post is well built, and has accommodations for many soldiers and travellers. It is a matter deserving particular notice, that the Russian soldiers, wherever stationed, are usefully employed in public works, as roads, bridges, military posts, See. This employment is embraced by them without any reluctance, and cannot but operate most favourably on their general character, as it counteracts those habits of dissipation to which soldiers are prone in the intervals of active warfare. It diminishes the repugnance excited by the presence of soldiers among the inha bitants of a district, who, seeing them thus occupied, cease to regard them as slothful and vicious intruders, the drones or locusts of the state. This union of the civil with the military character, so auspi cious during the best periods of the Roman empire, may one day pro duce important advantages to that of Russia. The following is the general plan on which the stations in this country are built. A square is formed, one right angle of which, or two connecting sides, are occupied by houses for the soldiers and officers, stabling for the Cossack horses, &amp;c. ; the corresponding right angle or two sides being fenced by rows of high palisades and a large gate. The dimensions of the square are determined by the number of troops destined for the station. In the centre of most of these posts there is one brass field-piece, and sometimes more. The houses or barracks are built of timber hewn square, laid flat on one another and mortised at the corners. The windows and doors are cut out ofKASSY-BEG. 257 the side that faces inwards ; the former are frequently covered with paper instead of glass. The roofs consist usually of long slips of bark spread open and fastened down by long battens laid across them to prevent their warping by heat or moisture. In each of these dwellings there are stoves or rather ovens, at the mouths of which the fires are made, which serve for cooking, as well as for heating the ovens to bake their large loaves of bread. This article forms the principal food of the Russian soldiers. Part of it is steeped in hot water until it becomes acescent by fermentation, when it fur nishes their favourite beverage called Quass. It is with such simple fare as this that the Russian soldiers are found uniformly satisfied, cheerful, and ready to labour with alacrity on any public work. They are all artisans of some kind or other; and wherever a battalion is posted it there erects for itself a village of block-houses, and possesses the means of supplying nearly all its primitive wants. We proceeded for Kassy-Reg, distant sixteen wersts, or eleven miles, through plains at the foot of hills, having the foaming Terek on the left of the road, which we found pretty good. The village of Kassy-Beg is situated at the bases of almost perpendicular mountains of limestone, granite, and slate, one mile in height. On its left flows the Terek, beyond which there is a chain of green mountains. On the summit of an isolated one there is a monastery or church; and in the distance is seen the snow-clad mountain of tremendous height called Kassy-Beg, said to be equal in altitude to Mont Blanc. The situation of this village is romantic in a high degree. The road for ward, lies through a very confined chasm close to the Terek, from the margins of which the rocky mountains rise abruptly to a great height. After a march of two hours, we arrived opposite the post of Dariel, placed in a very picturesque and indeed sublime situation. In order to reach it, we had to cross an intervening rivulet by a low wooden bridge. The road is between that rivulet and the Terek, which is here crossed by a bridge fixed to the perpendicular rock, a part being hewn away to form an approach at right-angles to the bridge: it is twenty yards wide, and strongly built. Opposite the258 DARIEL. post of Dariel, which is well built and provided with good accommo dation, there is an isolated mountain on the left of the Terek crowned with a fort now in ruins. At a spot not far distant from this post I observed the black naphtha or bitumen oozing from between rocks at the mountain’s foot; it is considered to be of little or no value, and is only applied to the axle-trees of wheels of carts and carriages as a substitute for grease. The chasms even in the highest parts of these stupendous moun tains are seen to produce a few firs. The precipices are frequently from six to eight hundred yards perpendicular, presenting a sur face of very large-grained granite, limestone, and slate. Along this mural boundary of the river Terek the public road has been wrought (or, as the French would say, pratique) with excessive labour. Parts have been exploded by gun-powder, and others exca vated by manual toil, so as to form in the face of the rock a lateral groove of sufficient width and height to admit wheel-carriages. Upon this corridor of a road, floored, walled, and roofed as it were by naked rock, and having on the open side no railing or protection to guard the verge of the precipice, we proceeded, almost stunned by the thundering roar of the river in the gulf below, of which the effect was such, that all around us, even the firm and fixed rock, seemed to vibrate and tremble. The rush of swoln torrents to its confined and stony bed, and the struggle of this accumulating mass of waters with the barriers that impeded it, produced the same loud concussion, and whirl, and boiling swell, which mark the conflict of opposing currents in a narrow channel at sea. The sound was the more deep and aw ful by reason of the profound chasm from which it was emitted, and which was overhung by mountains, so abrupt that they threatened momentarily to collapse and overwhelm it. We arrived at the post of Lars, distant five miles and a quarter from Dariel, situated on an eminence, commanding a town of the same name on a projecting ledge of rock, round the side of which winds the Terek. On approaching the post, we crossed a rivulet, nearly filled up with stones brought by the torrents from the mountainsIMPETUOUS CURRENT OF THE TEREK. 259 close on the left hand. The post is large and well fortified with stockades, having spacious and convenient buildings within it, afford ing good accommodation. In many places we observed that parts of the hill having become detached, sometimes 950 yards wide, had slided and settled, spreading themselves in the valley below; and on the river sides, near the junction of the rivulets thus formed, were seen immense deposits of stones, trees, and other substances, which the mountain-streams had carried thither as their spoils. On the road, at six wersts, four miles, we passed the village post of Cartash. This year the Terek had overflowed the whole valley, and had even settled in other channels; on which account the road onward was no longer practicable, and as there had not yet been sufficient time to repair the damage, we were obliged to pass along the edges of the mountain declivities, and to cross the chasms formed by rivulets, which we accomplished with great difficulty, accompanied by a strong guard of infantry, and by the officer commanding the last post. The mountains still continued high, and the whole of this wild country abounded in fastnesses, favourable to predatory tribes ; various places were pointed out to us from which the Oossetians sallied forth to make prisoners, or to levy plunder on the road. This march, like the preceding one, was frequently interrupted by detached masses that had slided from the mountain, and by changes in the river’s course, which had rendered the usual places no longer passable; and among these obstacles, sometimes wading through water, we proceeded to Balta, a bad post, four miles distant from the former. It had but little accommodation, and only just served to protect the inhabitants of the village. We observed avast number of small moveable corn-mills, appearing like huts, about six feet square, built of planks, and resting on four timbers. They were placed on the streamlets in such positions as might allow the current to act on the horizontal wheel, and were used chiefly for the purpose of grind ing corn for the soldiers. From this place the road led over extensive and humid plains or grass for eight miles, to a bridge over the Terek, opposite Vladi Cau- l l 2260 CIRCASSIAN HORSES. cass. We had been informed that this bridge of masonry was no longer passable, having been half carried away by the late flood, and this we found to be the case. For the convenience of passengers a traject had been contrived by means of two ropes, on which ran pullies with an iron frame attached to them, of a stirrup form, to serve as a seat for one person at a time; it is pulled backwards and forwards by a small rope fixed to its centre, and in this manner ourselves and our trunks were conveyed over this deep and rapid stream. The horses, under the care of the Cossacks, forded the river at some distance below, with very great difficulty and risk of their lives. On the road to Yladi Caucass we met many large lots of horses going from the Kabarda, a district of Circassia, situated on the river Kuban, to 1 eflis, for sale; most of them were intended for the Russian cavalry, and there were some select ones for individuals. The Circassian horses from that district are of a good size, and are much prized for their high blood, beauty, and speed. Some that I saw had large bodies and light thin necks; they were mostly geld ings, as entire horses are seldom sold, but they had very good action. The Russian officers purchase them at high prices as chargers. For the finest mare and horse which General Delpozzo could obtain during a long residence at Georgewesk, he paid five hundred silver roubles, or about a hundred and twenty-five pounds; and a hun dred roubles or twenty-five pounds was the price paid for a fine horse oi the same kind, belonging to the commanding officer at the post of Lars. These horses appear to me not only cheap, but of a breed which, in respect to blood and bottom, may be well worth a trial even in England. Ihe untamed Oossetians who reside near the environs of Vladi Caucass, lie in wait for passengers, whom they carry off and detain as prisoners until they obtain ransom for them from the Russians. Ihis practice of extorting money has subsisted among them for upwards of forty years, and they pursue it so constantly that scarcely three months pass in which some passenger of note is not way-laid and captured by them. The spots pointed out to me as most dan*^261 OOSSETIANS.7 gerous were passes up narrow chasms leading to the high mountains on the left or westward, and also some deep vales overhung by mountains and covered by woods on the right of the Terek. In both these directions the country is by nature so difficult of access that in order to pursue and overtake these freebooters, it would require large bodies of light troops expressly trained for this service. From what transpired, on enquiry, I learnt that the Russians are frequently the aggressors, and that their conduct has been hitherto so oppressive and unconciliating towards the Oossetians, that the latter have been urged to a continuance in their predatory habits by a spirit of retaliation. Some instances were related in proof of this assertion. A few months previous, two Russian officers and two females were taken prisoners and detained until a ransom was paid, when they were released. A certain sum of money, although perhaps not quite so great as that which they had claimed for this ransom, was due to them from some merchants who had employed them a few days before in the transport of their baggage and as guides, and when the service had been performed had refused to pay them. About a year before this, a Russian Major was seized by the Tchet- chenses, another tribe of Caucassian mountaineers. The Emperor of Russia, on being apprized of the circumstance, sent orders to General Delpozzo, who was then in command of Vladi-Caucass, to pay the sum of twenty-five thousand roubles demanded for the Major’s release. The general, however, as it was stated, marched with five or six hundred men to a village inhabited by Tchetchenses, who had been protected in their labours of tillage, and to whom ammunition and grain had been given, under a stipulation that they should deter their wilder friends and neighbours from entering and plundering the Russian territories and roads adjacent. The General sent for the head men of the village, and told them that they must either pay him the twenty-five thousand roubles themselves, or compromise the demand, by procuring the.release of the Major. He was released soon afterwards, and the General returned with him. He then wrote to the Emperor, that having received His Majesty’s commands, he262 VLADI CAUCASS. had assumed the discretion of acting in the manner described, as the most effectual preventative of similar attacks in future. It may be presumed that the Emperor in ordering this ransom of a valuable officer, considered that no other means for his recovery were avail able ; and indeed the policy of the Greneral’s expedient was but doubtful, as it tended rather to alienate a people whose attachment might perhaps not have borne such a trial. Several other occur rences of this kind were related to me by persons whose testimony I had no reason to doubt. During the heavy periodical rains in this country, from the latter end of April to July, the mountain thaws, or rather torrents, bring down with them to their junction with the Terek immense quantities of stones, sand, and fragments of timber, which not only obstruct and divert the water s course, but also cover the roads frequently to an extent of fifty yards, and to the height of ten and even twenty feet. These obstructions are annually either to be removed, or the road is again to be cut through or round them. The masses thus accumulated and the labour employed in removing them are surprising to a de gree that almost exceeds belief; all, however, is to be performed by Russian soldiers. The little town of Vladi Caucass is built on a flat plain of deep black mould, which on any considerable fall of rain becomes deep mud. The houses are built of planks and timbers covered either by thatch, or the barks of trees cut open and flattened for that pur pose. Although but of slight construction they have a very neat appearance; the walls are white washed, and the frames of the doors and windows are painted of another colour. The windows are very small, but they are glazed. In the interior there is a stove built of masonry which serves to heat two rooms, the orifice being in one and the body of the stove projecting into the other. In this manner are built the houses throughout all the frontier villages of Russia, and apparently with a great and unnecessary waste of timber, though, as that material is so plentiful, it may have been preferred as re quiring less labour than any other.PASSAGE OF THE CAUCASUS. 263 At this place, if a good carriage be procurable, the traveller may use it with advantage on the route onward, as the difficult road over the Caucasus terminates here. The country northward of that range of mountains is clear of any formidable heights, and no tract impass able to a carriage occurs between this and Mosdok. JVfany caits and other vehicles as well as horses are kept here for hue, at rathei lower rates than those charged by government for a similar number of horses, &amp;c. Any number of carts, and even a kibitka for travellers to ride in, may be hired from hence to Mosdok. Horses are kept here at a very moderate expense, the plains surrounding the town being covered with a profusion of forage of very nutritious quality, as it abounds in clover, lucerne, and many aromatic herbs. The government here maintain an establishment of post-horses; and as there are also great numbers kept by indi viduals, a traveller may obtain as many cattle for carriage as he can desire. The letter-post, or what we may call the mail, departs from Mosdok for Teflis, and from Teflis to Mosdok, on Sundays. It is carried on horseback, and is well guarded and escorted by infantry and Cos sacks, the latter part of the way with a field-piece. The Mosdok post takes two or three days to arrive at Vladi Caucass; that from Teflis takes three or four days. The opportunity of such an escort is highly convenient to those who can travel with sufficient rapidity. Exclusive however of this, there are many facilities for travelling; the Russian commanding officers are all extremely kind and attentive to strangers, and particularly to British officers on this route, and invariably assist them with guards, passports, and all other requisites. The charge from Vladi Caucass to Mosdok, for two kibitkas, carrying baggage and servant, and having two horses each, is only five silver roubles, or 21 each, although the distance is fifty-six miles and the journey is one of considerable danger. The mail is escorted by the gun and infantry only between Vladi Caucass and Mosdok: to and from Teflis its escort consists of Cossack264 PASSAGE OF THE CAUCASUS. cavalry. That line of route being beyond the frontier, the rate of charge is two silver roubles per werst for each horse. The accommodations found at the posts on the road are in general sufficiently good; and it is there always possible to obtain fowls, eggs, brown bread, milk, and frequently butter 5 if the tia'vellei be in haste or be not provided with cooking apparatus, the Russian commanding officer at these stations will most kindly procure meat, fowls, and other victuals to be dressed for him by the people under his ordeis. I am sorry to add that the different post-houses at this time of the year are much infested with fleas, and frequently with mosquitos. Notwithstanding the appalling anticipations that we had been led to form of the Caucasus, we found very little difficulty in passing those mountains. The roads are in general very good, and prac ticable even for wheel-carriages throughout. There is only one lange of mountains to traverse, and the passage is by no means so aiduous as that of almost all the Ghauts in India, the declivities being nothing near so steep. The accounts given to us had foretold not only diffi culties but peril. If a traveller, from inability to ride on hoiseback, wishes to use a travelling carriage throughout the whole way, he ought to take with him a Russian subaltern officer to assist him, and especially to provide an escort of soldiers to help the carriage thiough the most difficult places. At some of these he must expect to walk perhaps five hundred yards at a time: here the difficulties are greatest, and the tremendous precipices adjoining are likely to alarm a person unused to contemplate them, but they do not frequently occur. On the whole the facilities afforded by the Russian com mandants are so great, and the expenses of travelling so moderate, that to traverse the Caucasus ought not now to be regarded as a formidable undertaking. On the contrary, the stupendous grandeur of scenery, the beauty and variety of landscapes, the novelty of man ners, costume, and habits of the people, observable on this route,; combine to charm the attention of the traveller, and to render him almost unconscious of fatigue.265 ! (fills are m of’ifi- listol' GEORGIANS ALL ARMED. • A 'a 1 Circ ' mstance worth y of note, that in this country, and indeed throughout Georgia, all persons go armed when they have occasion to quit their habitations. Young boys of eight or ten years of age carry with them bows and arrows, knives and swords, which they are thus early taught to use. Those a few years older have pistols and musquets, and these weapons are borne by every man in the country, even by those employed at plough. Not a traveller of any description is to be met on the road, who is not apparently rather laden with arms than otherwise. Their musquets covered m a case of fur, whether riding or walking, are slung on their backs, and hang across from the right shoulder to the left hip. Their outer garments are trimmed as it were with rows of cartridges stitched or laced all over the front. Such combustible habiliments seem to render the use of fire-arms not very safe, but it was not stated that any fatal accident had ever occurred or was appre- bended from them. r No effectual measures have yet been adopted to civilize these people, and to render them useful subjects of the state to which they belong. The practice lately instituted of taking some of the young sons of the principal men, to educate them, will no doubt tend greatly to this desirable object. It may be safely assumed, that one mam reason which has operated to render the minds of these people unwilling to submit to the laws of their rulers, has been the bad policy of Russia in sending, or rather in exiling to the most distant commands, those of her officers who were most undeserving. This policy has, however, now been changed for a better; and officers, selected on account of their great merit, have been appointed for Georgia. Another great obstacle to free intercourse of the Caucas- sian tribes with Russia, consists in the quarantine regulations, which are permanent. An opinion prevails, that these tribes have the plague perpetually among either one or other of them. Hence they are actually allowed no communication with the interior, at least by means of the Russians, who to this day, I believe, have few if any of their own trust-worthy people competent to speak either of the M M266 RUSSIAN POLICY IN GEORGIA. languages of these tribes. The ground of this opinion concerning the plague is therefore never called in question ; and these poor people, in mercantile pursuits, suffer so much by detention, exaction, and other grievances at the quarantine stations, that should they be disposed, they could not without considerable difficulty, under these restraints, take either cattle, honey, butter, hides, furs, yapoonches, felts, or any of their merchandize and commodities to Russian markets, or even obtain free leave to import to their own moun tainous abodes any articles of Russian manufacture for their own use. Some mode of communication might be established at an intermediate village or frontier-station at which merchandize might be deposited, and not removed until duly fumigated and purified. This village might be occupied by settlers whom the prospect of lucrative Tgency would attract thither; and this medium of traffic might subsist under proper regulations, until the intercourse became more general, and the state of the mountain-tribes was better under stood. At all events, great pains should be taken to induce them to cultivate lands within the Russian territory, as this step would of itself constitute a pledge of their future good behaviour.267 I ■ CHAPTER XV.

HIS ANSWER, OR DERING OUR RELEASE, AND INVITING US TO HIS RESIDENCE AT NOVO TSHERKASK. Thursday, July 17th. — Our first stage from Vladi Caucass was to a station called Elizabeth’s Redoubt, distant twenty-two worsts, to which, and no further, we were able to accompany the letter-post, as it was eight o’clock in the morning before we set out. The first part of the road was over the black soil already mentioned, which was muddy, in consequence of the late rain ; but it was in general level and very good. We had many carts with us, and a gun and timbrel with lighted match: there was also a company of European infantry and fourteen Cossacks mounted. The day was very hot, and the march, which we performed on post-horses, proved a very tedious one, on account of the slow motion of the gun and infantry. We proceeded, however, accompanied by three or four officers and about twelve Cossacks, at least two miles in advance of the guard and gun, and arrived long before them, as they halted for forage on the road. mm 2268 CONSTANTINE’S REDOUBT. At the station we were pretty well accommodated; some beer of the country was brought, with fowls, eggs, milk, and even wine of Georgia. Our departure had been by beat of drum, which was performed thrice; the first time, to give warning to load the carts and cattle; the second, to put to the horses; and the third, to march. As the letter-carrier was anxious to arrive at Mosdok next day, the Commandant of the post sent to inform us that the mail would depart as early as two in the morning, which it accordingly did, by beat of drum, as before. July 18th. — Our journey to Mosdok, distant fifty-six wersts, was performed in six hours. The road was over a plain, like that of the preceding day, covered with forage. We found not the least dif ficulty in marching by night, and arrived at the station called Con stantine’s Redoubt, by nine next morning. Here the convoy halted until eleven, and we breakfasted as usual. Within a mile of this re doubt, we had traversed a range of hills, or rather of high grounds covered by trees, on the north side; they were called the Black Mountains, but were scarcely of a magnitude to deserve the name of hills. Our road onward from Constantine’s Redoubt continued as before. At the distance of ten miles from Mosdok, we came to a part which was said to be the most dangerous, of all the road; it was a range of hills, destitute of any vegetation except grass. Here the convoy halted, as it had done once before on this march; how ever, after descending into the plains of long grass that extend from these hills to Mosdok, which are considered as far from clear of Circassian freebooters, and are full of pheasants and other game, we gallopped on. It was fortunate that we did so, as night came on ere we arrived at the formidable and much widened river Terek, which again traversed our path and separated us from the town of Mosdok. Its waters were high, and we with difficulty forded two branches of the river, and then crossed the principal stream in a jungar, consisting of two boats lashed together, bearing a large-railed platform. Here it was necessary to take over with us one of ourQUARANTINE-HOUSE AT MOSDOK. 269 horses and carts to carry our baggage to the quarantine-house. We and all our effects, in common with every person and thing coming from Georgia, were regarded as being tainted with plague, and until we were duly purified nobody could be allowed to come in contact with us. The passage of the river took up considerable time, and it was quite dark before we obtained a place of shelter. We were guarded in our way from the river’s edge to the qua rantine-house by troops with fixed bayonets. The physician, or quaiantme inspector, went along with us. A room having been assigned for the reception and fumigation of our baggage, we were desired to deposit the whole of it there. It was an apartment about sixteen feet square, with a thin lath flooring raised four and a half feet above the ground; on this all our boxes and clothes were to be opened and placed. We were, however, permitted to take away our beds, with such plates, cups, and other utensils as we might want for immediate use. These were to be fumigated the next day. The boxes and clothes being thus deposited, pots of brimstone, salt, muriatic acid, and other ingredients for fumigation, were brought, and ignited or otherwise set in action. The double doors were then closed and locked, as our effects were to remain there the whole night. We retired to a miserable hovel which was shown to us as our quarters. It may be necessary to observe that our probation was for one day; that to which merchants are subjected extends to seven. As the river Terek was flooded and turbid, we could not at the quarantine get even good water to drink ; at length some hot water was brought, and about nine we took some tea, after which we went to lie down on the grass outside the house. It was impossible to take any rest within on account of the swarms of musquitoes, which, notwithstanding our endeavours to smoke them out with lighted straw, exceeded in number those that I had ever seen in any place even in India. About nine in the morning we were al lowed to remove our trunks and other effects, and we then gave up the clothes and things that had not undergone fumigation. For this purpose it was necessary to shift ourselves, and put on theJESUITS. 270 purified and stinking apparel. A little after noon on Sunday the 20 th, we received the rest of our baggage, and went in a vehicle called a droshky, belonging to the commandant, who very kindly sent it for our use to the residence of the Jesuits established here, who on our arrival had by letter most obligingly invited us to take up our abode with them. During our short stay at Mosdok we experienced every possible attention, and the most friendly assistance, from the superiors Pere Henri and Pere Joseph. Their community has but recently settled here, and they are building a very fine chinch with a dome over it: the whole is to be constructed of timber ; but, considering the place, it will have, when finished, a very grand and imposing appearance. However much the establishment of this order of religious may be discountenanced at St. Petersburg!!, it certainly promises many ad vantages to a town like Mosdok, where their utmost exertions to in terfere with the spiritual concerns of all the potent chieftains ot Cir cassia, cannot be otherwise than subservient to the ultimate views of the Russian government. In fact the multifarious and disagreeable du ties imposed by the regulations of this order on its members, of ad ministering medicinal and spiritual relief to all sick persons, even to those infected with the plague, whom they are uniformly bound to attend, and the tuition which they gratuitously offer, by establishing within their own monastery a free-school for the children of the in habitants, in short all that their institution enjoins them to perform, must in a country like this be at present unequivocally advantageous to the interests of the state. Mosdok being considered as in Russia, the post-horses, which generally belong to government, are paid for in paper roubles, or as they are termed assignats, which though originally current at the same value as the silver rouble, are now so depreciated as to pass only for one-fourth of that value, in the purchase of food or other articles. This consideration is worth the attention of those who may be disposed to buy a carriage at this place, which may sometimes be done on favourable terms, because Russian gentlemen passing into Georgia,KIBITKA DESCRIBED. 271 frequently leave carriages here of European construction to be dis posed of. In these very remote parts of the Russian empire, the traveller finds neither caravanseras, as in Persia, nor inns. Where the post- house is not good enough, it is the custom for him to wait on the police-master of the town at which he halts. This person on appli cation to him, issues an order for accommodation, a sort of billet on some private house, the family of which will, if reasonably paid, pro cure, and dress if required, any provisions, such as fowls, eggs, fish, or milk, bread, and butter. Sometimes the police-master sends a man with the traveller to point out proper quarters, and assist in providing such articles of subsistence as he may immediately require. This to a stranger is a regulation which obviates many perplexing inconveniences. Although Mosdok did not afford us any fine fruits, yet we were agreeably surprised to find another article of food, which to us was a very acceptable novelty. This was some very fine sturgeon and stirlet, with which the place is abundantly supplied. In the evening, at five, we went to visit the commandant, with whom we drank coffee, and purchased of his town-adjutant a kibitka for 300 roubles, paper currency. It was to be repaired and sent to us the next morning by eight o’clock. Monday, July 21 . — At ten o’clock the kibitka was brought. Our passports had been examined by the colonel-commandant, who gave us a guard of six cossacks and a written circular to his posts, to ensure us assistance. We left Mosdok at eleven, in the kibitka with five horses harnessed with ropes, three put to as wheelers and two as leaders, with the postilion on one of them. Our order was for only four horses, and we paid for no more ; but it is customary for government to allow one extra for their coachman, who drives in the box. This kibitka is a boat-shaped vehicle, resembling the half of a cask sawed lengthways, and mounted on wheels. Ours was of large272 DEPRATURE FROM MOSDOK. dimensions, the interior being in length six feet, in breadth four and a half, and in depth three. It was lined with sheet-iron, and the outside was ribbed like that of a boat; it had a fixed hood of wood covered with leather studded with brass nails, and had a leather apron and curtains. The axle-trees were of wood, and there were no springs. There was a box to lock behind, of the breadth of the carriage, in which we stowed away all our canisters, provisions, liquid as well as solid, plates and other instruments, which rattled together among the straw in which they were packed, as the vehicle jolted along. In the hold we stowed our other baggage, consisting of four trunks, bedding, gun, case, pistols, and servants’ luggage. Having then placed ourselves within, the coachman and servant mounted the box, and we set out on our journey. It may here be remarked, that had our destination been for Teflis by that day’s post, it would have been particularly advisable to leave Mosdok on the Saturday evening, and remain at a redoubt and station on the road, about two miles distant. That station is beyond all the rivers, and clear of those numerous obstructions which present themselves on going from Mosdok in that direction. Carriages, carts, baggage and saddle horses, may be hired here for the trip to Vladi Caucass. Our route was for Georgewesk, and the first stage was Paulodolsh, distant thirteen wersts. The road was flat and good, but dusty; and as its direction was westerly, we were much oppressed with the heat of the sun that shone full on us in the evening. On our left we observed enclosures at different distances, consisting of wattles, and having huts within them. There was a basket of the same materials supported on four high poles. Within each of these baskets, which were nearly in view of one another, there was a Cossack sentinel posted, who kept a good look out to see that no Circassian free booters entered within his range. The enclosures were stations of communication, where the Cossacks on duty had their horses ready saddled, so as to take the field on the shortest notice. A certainPAULODOLSH. 213 proportion of these men are thus continually on the alert along the whole boundary, to prevent the Chirkasses and Tchetchenses from plundering the country adjacent to their own. The road extended over a very spacious plain; the mountains to the southward, distant thirty or forty miles, wore backed by others coveied with snow. There was no cultivation to be seen, nor any dispersed villages or hamlets; on the plain, though deeply covered with forage, no cattle or horses were to be seen grazing, except near the enclosures or posts occupied by the Cossacks as guards. We arrived at Paulodolsh, a large village with many neat huts, white-washed within. At the doors we saw great numbers of children, all having, without exception, flaxen hair and very fair complexions. Their mothers were short hard-featured women, much sun-burnt, wearing a dress like that of the native Portuguese in India, a handkerchief on the head tied in front, a long chemise extending to the heels, and a short petticoat tied over it above the hips. The neck was not at all supported, and the chemise being of flax or woollen, of a thick texture and heavy, was weighed down so as to have a very unbecoming effect. Though the children had good complexions, they had many of them the short pug-face of the Calmuck Tartars. The men wore very large coarse felt hats. There appeared to be abundance of farming stock of all kinds; horses, kine, pigs, geese and poultry; and the carts and other apparatus were numerous in proportion. The houses were thatched with reeds; the hedges, as well as the walls of the stables and out-houses, were wattled. The second stage was Ekaterinogradski, twenty-two wersts; the road good and level, the country of the same character as before, and the mountains about the same distance. The village is of middling size and has a church, with some appearance of fortification. Prochladnoi (eighteen wersts) was the third stage; it is a large village with rectilinear streets of neat houses, or rather, thatched cottages. The day being Sunday, the people were all cleanlyGEORGEWESK. 274 dressed; there were great numbers of women and children about the doors and under the shade of the trees. We were driven to Soldatskoi, the fourth stage, (seventeen wersts,) by a little boy of seven years of age. We had a very good road, and travelled rapidly : we now began to observe occasional patches of cultivation. The fifth stage was Paulowsk, twenty wersts. The road was flat and good to within half a mile of the post; it then became steep. Having to descend to a river we locked the wheel with one of the rope-traces of the wheel-horses. We crossed the river with no difficulty, as there was very little water, and ascended the opposite bank, to the post. Near this place we concluded to sleep rather than proceed, as we were informed that the floods had broken down the bridge near Georgewesk, and that we should not be able to cross the water by night. The country seemed a little better cultivated; there were hills and mountains on our left as before, and we were now entering a more secure territory, as there were no longer any Cossack posts in sight. Monday, July 21 st. — We set out for Georgewesk, distant twenty- five wersts. At eight wersts we came to a declivity, locked the wheel, and passing through a village at the bottom, again ascended. The road continued good until we came to a little rivulet running to the right, which we crossed by a bridge. On approaching Georgewesk we forded the river to the right of the bridge, which we found broken down. We halted here to have the wheels examined ; the two hind ones required to be re-constructed, and having to wait until that could be done, we were accommodated at the house of a subaltern officer. Here I had an opportunity of observing the manners of the place, which were perfectly those of the militia cast; the family consisted of the gentleman, his lady, and four children. They possessed around them many farm-houses, a garden and different out-houses, with horses, cows, pigs, geese, poultry, and other stock, like that ofWATERING-PLACE. 275 a farm. The profession of arms and the pursuits of agriculture were thus grotesquely united. The poor people gave up half the house to our use, and shut themselves up in the other half, either through civility or shyness, perhaps both. For re-making the wood-work of the wheels of our kibitka we paid twenty-six roubles, paper. Near a hill about forty wersts southward of this place there are acid mineral waters, and also hot wells, which are reckoned efficacious remedies in many complaints. They are much resorted to by the Russian gentry; upwards of two thousand persons were said to be there at this period, probably most of them from the same motives that impel visitors to the fashionable watering-places in England, to kill time, play at cards, and drive away the spleen. Georgewesk is a considerable town, and has many good barracks and quarters for soldiers. General del Pozzo resides here as general of the division of Kabarda and Kuben ; he is also governor of the province, the limits of which extend to that of the Eon. He was at this period gone with six thousand men to establish a post on a river in the country of the Tchetchenses. We had here to take leave of the officer who, by General Kou- tousoff’s appointment, had accompanied us from Teflis. His family reside at this place. He had been of great service to us, always going in advance to get our post-horses provided and ready, paying expenses, keeping accounts, and in short, doing all that lay in his power to assist us. To him, therefore, and to another gentleman, who, as he spoke French, had interpreted for us on the journey, we gave our two Arabian horses, with their saddles and bridles. Having had a day’s trial of the kibitka, I shall here give some account of its conveniences and disadvantages. With respect to the stowage and transport of any quantity of trunks or other baggage, this vehicle is certainly more appropriate than the coJecJiC) being more roomy. It will serve to carry a family, or even three gentle men with their servants and baggage. But it jolts so much, that although we had travelled only 114 wersts over soft and very even ground, it had bruised the muscles of our shoulders exceedingly. N N 2276 INCONVENIENCES OF THE KIBITKA. Indeed, while the kibitka is in motion, it is impossible to lean back unless there be a support of bedding and pillows. We preferred to sit on our small trunks covered with two blankets and a carpet which nearly served for a seat; but we here determined to procure, if possible, another conveyance of the caleche kind on springs, or else to purchase bedding, as we had thoughtlessly left our own at Teflis. During the repair of the wheels, we calculated on having time to make the requisite enquiries and to provide for other wants. Hitherto the Russian officer had paid for our post-horses, and had discharged other incidental expenses. The rate of hire for the horses is three roubles paper for each werst; it is said to be at some places so high as five paper roubles per werst. It is requisite that the traveller should purchase at any of the large towns on his route a certain quantity of copper coin to give to the postilions and drivers. We gave them ten copecks each per stage. A gift to this amount was not absolutely necessary, the matter being left to the free-will of the traveller. Our servant carried the coin in a leather bag, to be distributed when necessary. The exchange of paper roubles for copper coin or small silver money is effected with very great loss; we obtained only four roubles and a half in copper for an assignat of five roubles, at Mos- dok. This no doubt arose from the scarcity of copper coin in that remote place. In addition to the bedding, 1 would advise the traveller to have a paii of holsters fixed to the side of the kibitka; netting at top for hats and other things, and pockets at the sides for any small articles frequently needed. The curtains should be particularly well fixed and long, in order to exclude the sun’s rays, wind, dust, and rain. We found the heat very oppressive while travelling at mid-day and in the evening. It also appears to me, that the kibitka being ex tremely low, suffers more from dust than any other carriage. July 23d. Our wheels were at length repaired; and bedding was bought, consisting of three separate pieces, covered with leather, each of which cost forty-five roubles. We departed for Savernaia,ADVICE TO TRAVELLERS. 277 after waiting from three in the morning until ten, for horses, which we at last procured, not from the post-house, but by sending to the master of the police, who ordered them to be furnished to us from the inhabitants. On making further enquiry respecting the watering- place already mentioned, we were informed that forty wersts from this are the hot-water baths, and at the same distance farther are some very cold mineral springs of an acid and astringent nature. They are frequented, as before observed, like those in England, by valetu dinarians, who hope to derive strength from them again to live freely; and by hypochondriacs, who seek there a change of air and society ; as also by a gayer class, whose pretext is not perhaps the recovery, but the preservation of health, by the united effects of travelling and amusement. It is said that much gaming prevails there. Many splendid equipages are seen journeying thither, from the post kibitka to the landau with six horses ; the other varieties are the droshky, the briska, the caleche, the dormeuse, the coach, the chariot, the barouche, and lastly the barouchette-and-four. I must observe, that as the keep of horses is very moderate, and the animals are of a fine breed in Russia, and particularly here, it is not con sidered even genteel to move with fewer than four. We dined at the Governor’s, who sent his carriage and four beau tiful grey Circassian horses for us, and invited a party to meet us. He gave us an order, effective in his own district only, securing to us every possible assistance as to quarters, horses, and other requisites, which it enabled us to obtain when no other means would have availed. In mentioning this act of courtesy, I would recommend to all strangers performing this journey, to be particular in paying visits to governors and commanding officers of rank, observing on these occasions all the forms of showing respect, by propriety of dress, polite enquiries, professions of civility, and of readiness to exe cute commissions on the route, &amp;c. These attentions are agreeable to the persons themselves, who consider them to some extent as their due ; they secure to the traveller the advantages accruing from aI 278 JOURNEY TO SAVERNAIA. variety of local information, they ensure to him orders for assistance in his journey, and they gratify him with a knowledge of the meri torious characters of the individuals themselves. These visits pro duced, in our case, a very favourable impression with regard to the superior education of the persons now in authority in these countries. The Russian gentry all speak French, and in general (I really believe) with more correctness than their own language. To limit the assertion, I should say that I have known young Russian gentle men speak French with the Parisian accent, inflexion, and gesture, at an age when our English youths would be supposed to have had no more time than was requisite to acquire the rudiments of their own and the Latin language. I do not suppose that this proceeded from either natural quickness or from superior tuition ; but from neglect of their own language for the French, which is here universally spoken. In the course of conversation, it was stated that the Kabarda horses were reputed to be equal in swiftness to those of English breed. They make delightful carriage-horses, being tractable and high-couraged. Grain is cheap here, and bread also. A loaf equal to four Yorkshire cakes sells for five copper copecks; fowls at sixty copecks (about 7d.) a couple. The intermediate stages of our journey to Savernaia were Alexan dria, twelve wersts; Sabli, forty miles ; Alexandrow, twenty-seven wersts, from whence to Savernaia were nineteen wersts. With the addition of some fractions to these estimates, the whole distance may be computed at ninety-eight wersts, which was performed in eight hours fourteen minutes. On our first stage we traversed a bad bridge over a rivulet flowing from the left, and had in view a rivulet and village half a mile to the right. The road was rather uneven but good. At the post-house they tried to make us pay for five post horses instead of four, but the claim was abandoned on proper explanation. Here we perceived that our vehicle had sustained damage. The new wooden naves of the hind wheels being rough within, had taken fire through fastDETACHMENT OF COSSACKS. 279 driving, and water was required to extinguish them. It is necessary to be prepared against these accidents on the road, by carrying a quan tity of water in the kibitka, as well as naphtha, which is here used instead of grease for the wooden naves. On proceeding to Sabli, the second stage, we met half a regiment of Cossacks marching toward Georgia with field-pieces and tumbrils; the guns having been taken to pieces were carried on carts of the country drawn by bullocks. The Cossacks marched in pretty regular order, their commandant being at the head of the column, decorated with crosses and orders, all exposed. The column was preceded by a few kibitkas, and in the rear were three lines of Cossack soldiers with bat-horses, all loaded, their burthens being covered with nummuds. All their muskets were carried in cases of h$ir or felt, and I perceived that they could take them out and use them at speed. They did not ap pear to have any tent-equipage or followers at all, and there was not a single female. They moved very slowly, continuing their march in the hottest part of the day. Each Cossack carried a spear about twelve feet long, resting on his right stirrup ; he had also a sword, a musket, and many had pistols. They were all dressed in grey great-coats, and wore caps bordered with fur. The country throughout this stage was uneven, but more cultivated than that which we had lately passed through. At half the distance there was a considerable ascent; and just before entering Sabli, we crossed a rivulet. This stage of forty wersts we performed in three hours. We here observed that the enclosures of court-yards, &amp;c. were of stone, but the walls of the houses were of timber as usual. Sabli is only a small village, consist ing of a single street. The road to Alexandrow, the third stage, twenty-seven wersts, is good but uneven, leading over rising grounds; we found it extremely hot and dusty. Blue or grey clothes are absolutely requisite for tra velling ; other colours, particulary white linen, become in an hour so dusty as to be unfit to appear in. We crossed a bridge over a rivulet running to the left of some tracts of tillage, widely dispersed. The road to Savernaia continued of the same character; near its280 VILLAGES. termination we came to an ascent, and on arriving found very bad accommodation. There is a loss of time in changing horses of at least thirty minutes in general. Even the public courier takes twenty minutes. Many more are consumed in the greasing of wheels, and in getting money changed to pay the next post, and of course much time and trouble may be saved by providing a sufficient quantity of copper and silver coin, to answer this purpose. Notes of five roubles, however, are taken ; and when change cannot be given, the difference is credited, and is accounted for at the subsequent post. July 24th. — Our next stage was to Novo Sergiewsk, fifteen wersts, over an uneven, stony, and bad road, which occasioned much jolting. We crossed many ravines by wretched bridges, one of them close to this village: the weather was cloudy. We observed many stacks of wheat, barley, and oats, and there was much cultivated ground for grain. Pheasants appeared to be numerous in this district. To Pokrowsky, thirty-three wersts, the road was over hills, but good. We crossed several small bridges. This is a large straggling village, situated at the foot of some hills. We proceeded to Stawropol, our third stage of this day, distant thirty- one wersts. We passed, at nineteen wersts, a deep descent, at the bottom of which there was a straggling village, partly surrounded by sen tries of infantry, in straw huts. They were posted here to prevent any communication with the exterior, as this village was said to have been infected with the plague during the last three months. The whole road was uneven and rather bad. At the town of Stawropol, no horses were to be had, nor was any place to be found to accommodate us; the Governor’s order alone, here proved of use. We were received at the house of a merchant, and the next morning obtained two horsevS from the master of the police, there being only three at the post. This scarcity of horses occurs frequently at the towns or large villages, and is occasioned by the frequency of travelling post, in a country where the expenses attending it are so moderate. The total distance from Savernaia hither, was seventy-nine wersts, which we performed in nine hours and a half. The road was nearly covered by carts car-STAWROPOL. 281 ^ militaiy stores to Georgia; we had observed at Alosdok some liundreds of these vehicles, waiting to proceed on the same destin ation. There were also four or five hundred recruits; and it appeared that great preparations were making to strengthen Georgia. Officers were hastening to join their regiments, &amp;c. and all were enquiring earnestly about Persia, the embassy, India, and other topics of like interest. On making some enquiry here, we were informed that the village, which we had observed to be surrounded with sentries, had not the plague, but laboured only under an endemic and contagious fever. Stawropol is a town of considerable size, and appears to be in an im proving state. They were enlarging the new church, and were cover ing its roof with copper. The streets here are all straight, and the houses stand at a distance from each other, which regulation, as they are all built of wood, seems efficacious in preventing the spread of pesti lence as well as of fire. The enclosures, however, are nearly all of wood also, consisting of a dry wattling of twigs. The roofs of the houses are thatched, but they are the less likely to take fire, from having through moisture and dust acquired an incrustation of vegetative soil, which produces grass and weeds. All the roofs have this appearance : their slope is very steep. The population in the villages of the country is great, although they are remote from each other. July 25th.—Our first stage this day was to Moskowska, distant thirty- one wersts and a half. Immediately on quitting Stawropol, we went down a steep descent, and after crossing two small bridges, over two streams running to the right, we ascended a very abrupt acclivity. This would be a passage of some peril by night either in coming to or in quitting the town. The road onward was softer and exceedingly good, until it reaches the post-house situated on a height overlook ing the village of Moskowska, which is a mile further. Here, as on the preceding night, we had rain, thunder, and lightning. Donskaia, our second stage, was twenty wersts distant. The road descends from the post-house, and passes the village of Mos kowska, at the distance of half a mile. We found it still very good,I 282 DISTRICT OF THE HETMAN PLATOFF. but we had now become somewhat accustomed to the jolting of the kibitka, and suffered less from it than at first. About five miles from Donskaia the country is quite plain, and here are villages almost con tiguous to each other throughout the rest of the way, along the banks of a rivulet running on the right of the road at the distance of half a mile. Donskaia is the frontier village of the district of the Don, and is of course under the government of the Hetman Platoff. The road was extremely good all the way to our third stage, Be- sopasnaia, distant twenty-two wersts. Here, as along the whole tract of country from Mosdok, and even from Vladi Caucass, there is a great scarcity of trees. None are seen except in the vicinity of the villages ; and there are hardly any fruit to be had but wild cherries, of a bad taste, which are dried in ovens. The population is numerous, and the proportion of women and children very great. The latter are, as before observed, very fair; but the women are of short stature, with broad and coarse features, and many of them have flaxen or red hair. The houses or hovels are filled with pigs, fowls, pigeons, calves, cats, and dogs ; the fleas and flies swarm in such numbers as to blacken the floors, walls, and beams. In the corners of all the dwellings there are brass plates and paintings, or daubs of saints and virgins. The better sort of people have many coarse prints of these sacred person ages, placed along with others of their general officers, princes, and great men, who are all represented on horseback; a familiar but useful mode of propagating military inclinations, and of exciting emulation among the lower orders. All their children are able to ride on horse back at three or four years of age, and the habits which they generally acquire in infancy are those of a Cossack soldier, to subsist on the coarsest fare, and to endure being mounted all day, and even all night if requisite. Our fourth stage was to Shregradnoi, twenty-five wersts. Soon after setting out we crossed a bridge over a rivulet flowing to the right. The road was altogether good, and towards the end of the stage led through some low level plains unvaried by a rise as far as the eye extends in any direction forwards. The village is small andHESTESLAUSKAI. 283 very irregular; the post-house is somewhat beyond it. Here our hind axle-tree was found to be cracked, and the wheel had inclined so much as by continual friction to have cut through one of the ribs of the body of the kibitka. As the people thought it would not hold out another stage we halted in order to have a newaxle-tree made, which was with some difficulty undertaken for twenty roubles, being eight for the wood work, ten for the iron work, and two for the labour. The breadth and great size of the kibitka rendered it not very easy to find wood for a new axle-tree ; and as the village smith was absent, we were detained till morning. We slept at the post-house, or rather watched there, for the annoyance of fleas and flies, and the bustle occasioned by the changing of horses for travellers, hindered us from sleeping. This is an inconvenience that attends every post-house, and it is always preferable, if possible, to procure quarters elsewhere. July 26th. — Our first stage was to Hesteslauskai, reckoned twenty- three wersts, but the distance must be shorter, as we were only one hour and two minutes in going. On the road we observed several very large droves of bullocks and cows going toward Moscow for sale. We were told that they cost from ten to fifty roubles each in this country, and would be sold for double the value at that capital. Our new axle-tree was well primed with pork-fat as well as with naphtha, and certainly with effect, as it did not catch fire, although we went much faster than before. At the post of Hesteslauskai we observed two small ill made windmills, the first we had seen on our journey: in front of the church, and near the road, there was fixed an image of a saint, upon a pole surmounted by a covering ; a box near this figure was taken down and brought to us to receive our alms. The village is built close on the left bank of the river Yegar- lik, which is one of the tributary streams of the Don. From the time we had begun to travel post, we had mares as well as horses indiscriminately yoked to the carriage, and they were often accompanied by one and even two colts from two to six months old, which ran all the longest stages and of course returned with their dams, immediately after arriving at the post where the cattle are o o 2SREDNOI EGARLIK. 284 changed, It is the custom for post-horses to return unburdened, and they are seldom allowed to be put to any carriage going that way. We proceeded to Kopali, twenty-two wersts; and thence to Rascip- naia where we slept, at a very bad post-house. The first part of the road had been flat and sandy, over uncultivated plains as before. About one-third of the way from Kopali we crossed a new bridge ; the road continued good, but the country was not quite so flat. We thence travelled by an exceedingly good road to Pestchanaia, thirty wersts, and onward over more uneven ground to Srednoi Egarlik, twenty-seven and a half wersts. On the plains, which were abundant ly covered with forage, we observed numbers of quails, partridges, and a species of wild-goose. The quarantine at Srednoi Egarlik consists of many separate small buildings forming squares for the accommodation of travellers ; the whole encompassed by palisades and a ditch. The barriers, and I believe the adjacent heights, are guarded by Cossacks. The regula tions of this place are, as far as I could ascertain, as follows, in a description of what took place with regard to ourselves. On our arrival at the barrier, we were delayed some time, and were then desired to send in all the papers or passes we possessed, which we prepared to do. A carrier dressed in greasy black clothes advanced with all due solemnity to the barrier, and seizing the papers with a pair of long tongs, disappeared with them. After this we were kept waiting in the carriage somewhat more than an hour. An officer and a soldier then advanced and opened the barrier, the soldier leading the carriage in the first instance to a fumigating room. Here we were met by several persons, and required to give in our things, which were to be kept twenty-four hours ; therefore a change of clean clothes had to undergo fumigation immediately in order that we might put them on when we had been duly purified. Our baggage and boxes were all taken into this confined room, where every thing was unpacked and opened. We were told that all articles of iron or leather, as pistols and swords, as also tin canisters of tea and sugar, would not be smoked; all our clothes, linen, andQUARANTINE. 285 other apparel were taken out and hung on cords ; all paper-packets, even such as contained specimens of minerals, were opened, and the contents, as well as other objects of curiosity, were jumbled together and the papers exposed. All sealed letters were pricked through with an iron instrument preparatory to their exposure to vapour. Any trinkets, cash, or paper currency that we might have, we were desired to take with us to another place. We left all our things, after selecting a change of linen, and some bedding for the night, which were taken to be purified by smoke and gas. We then got into the kibitka and were taken to another house, and shown into an apartment in which were stoves and iron gratings placed at about the height of a table, on which we were desired to place every bit of paper bound round our trinkets, &amp;c. On another table of wood was placed a wooden bowl, containing what appeared to be a mixture of vinegar, salt, and water, in which we were enjoin ed to put all our cash, either silver or gold, and afterwards to wash in this liquid the outside of each of our trinkets separately; Captain Salter’s watch, with hair-chain, my compass and chain, seals, keys, rings of whatever stones, and other similar articles were subjected to this process; not a single thing would they allow us to exempt from it. Every minute article of our property was either washed or fumi gated ; every packet, even one containing a small portion of Dr. James’s powder was opened, and the papers removed to the grate, as were also the paper currency, and every bag of leather or other material. After this exposure of all our minute articles over the grate, which occupied more than an hour, our clean smoked clothes were brought in and deposited on a bench: we were informed that we could not be allowed to touch them until we were quite naked, and we were told to undress even while people were in the room. Having taken off all but our shirts we desired them to leave us, which they did, warning us on no account to touch the clean clothes until we were naked. At this time the physician came in and examined our arm- pits, groins, the glandular parts of the neck, and in short all the parts of the body in which the plague displays itself. He gave us a black286 QUARANTINE. and filthy-ldoking sponge saturated with vinegar to pass over each of those parts separately, and then left us, hearing us previously de clare that we were in health and had not the plague. We then put off our apparel and dressed ourselves in the clean fumigated clothes. Vessels were brought containing the usual ingre dients for the production of gas, which being mixed up, the vapour was passed under all the papers, lying on the grate, and we retired into another apartment to avoid its effects. In half an hour we were al lowed to return and collect our trinkets, papers, &amp;c. and then pro ceeded to a small separate habitation that had been allotted for our residence. During the above-mentioned process, a heavy storm had come on which drenched the carriage and wet many of our things which were spread on the cords, &amp;c. in the fumigating room, the roof of which, though made of a double layer of bark, was in such bad repair as to admit the rain in streams. The hovel to which we were removed, and in which we were to pass the ensuing seven days, had its floor about three and a half feet below the level of the ground, being one half of its height. The small openings of the windows at the ground level were almost obscured by rank weeds which grew all round the place, reaching to the eaves of the roof. The storm of rain had wetted the floor and the benches within. On entering we found that the place swarmed with fleas, mosquitoes and mice. The walls and beams were actually blackened with flies, which rested on every thing that was laid down even for a moment. There were fixed bed-places or tressels on which we laid our leather-covered bedding; but as we had not provided ourselves with any sheets or light covering, we were unable to sleep during the whole night, and it was out of the question to place our beds in the open air, as the ground was covered with high weeds and was then wet with rain. At the time of our arrival no provisions could be procured but lean and bad mutton, a bit of which was roasted by a fire of wet wood, and some very bad, sour, brown bread was brought us to eat with it. In the evening we made some tea, which was all the sus-288 QUARANTINE. Information was brought to us that we must pay eighteen roubles thirty copecks, to send a mesenger post in a kibitka; and that our letter, unsealed, must be fumigated. This was accordingly done, and two ten-rouble assignats were given to the officer who came to receive them. Of him I enquired if there were not Cossacks at every post between this place and the residence of the Hetman, and why a single horse man could not be sent with the letters, adding that in fact the duty was General Platoff’s, and that without General YermolofF’s letter I should not have written to him. To all this he merely answered that a messenger in a kibitka would go the fastest; I replied that I was certain there would be a loss of more time in changing horses at the post-houses, nearly half an hour at each post, and that not more than one third of that time would be required for a change of Cossacks; but that he ought to know best, and I begged he would act accordingly. I also enquired concerning the letter-post, and was informed that letters left this place only every Saturday : this was Monday. As Captain Salter found himself feverish, I requested that people might be sent to clear the weeds from the space around the house, for which labour we would pay them. It was promised that this request should be attended to. Meantime we began to be aware of another annoyance: the oven or fire-place for cooking was within the room; and though it was doubtless serviceable in preventing miasmata, it produced intolerable heat which continued all night. The water at this place stinks, and is very unwholesome to drink, as it invariably produces diarrhoea on all strangers who use it. The name of the place is derived from the bad odour of its water. Another circumstance which appears to me of serious import, is, that all travellers from Georgia and every other place, are made to perform quarantine promiscuously with those from the Kabarda, or Circassia, where it is believed that the plague continually exists. These men are allowed to brino; with them wool and woollen-cloths, and hundreds of thousands of skins of sheep, goats, hares, foxes, &amp;c.QUARANTINE. 289 &amp;c. which are exposed to the air under sheds, in a situation near which people are passing indiscriminately all day long. Even prisoners brought in irons from those districts, the Kabarda or Circassia, are kept with other travellers, and sleep under the same roofs with them. For these reasons, the fact appears to be, that although it is very certain that we should have gone through Russia without carrying the plague with us if we had never entered the quarantine, we were here exposed to great danger of taking the infection and carrying it with us from hence. That gold, silver, and copper coin, and even paper money, should be duly purified, is a proper regulation which should be scrupulously attended to, because those articles pass through innumerable hands, and are thus liable to infection ; but the annoyance of unpacking all trinkets, (which foreign travellers keep safely locked up, and which are not so likely to change their owners) and of washing them in the filthy brine, is surely needless, whilst the boots, belts, and other articles of leather or iron belonging to people of the country who may have actually had intercourse with persons infected by the plague, are left unpurified. There is another grievance which requires to be abolished. There are double keys to all the padlocks placed on the doors of the fumi gating rooms, one of which keys the quarantine servants reserve, and can thus enter the rooms where a traveller’s property is deposited when they please, though they pretend to deliver the sole key of the room to him, and thus relieve him from all apprehension. We witnessed a proof of this custom of keeping double keys. A Monsieur Jervais, a French wine-merchant, who had accompanied us from Teflis, had received the key of the room in which his effects were deposited for fumigation; it was opened by the servants in our presence with another key. He warned them at the time of the serious conse quences which must ensue if he reported this act of theirs to the government, and they appeared to be sensible of the propriety of his remarks. , ■290 QUARANTINE. The room in which our effects were placed for fumigation was immediately adjoining that which contained the property of M. Jervais, consisting of bales of shawls, chintzes and other merchandise, which the officers of this quarantine had obliged him to open out; although in order to obviate any occasion for this trouble the bales had been closed and sealed, at the quarantine near Teflis. The officers alleged that they knew not of the quarantine to which he adverted, and denied that any authority existed there for sealing up mer chandise. M. Jervais would be in consequence liable to undergo a much longer detention than he expected, as all goods fresh imported must remain in quarantine a whole fortnight. Hence it appears, that in these establishments a great deal is left to the discretion of the officers ; and this seems a defect in the regulations, for which a remedy should be speedily provided. No care whatever is taken to preserve cleanliness in the hovels, or rooms of accommodation. On the contrary, every thing detrimental to the health of the persons confined in them is tolerated. The bread and water are bad, the wine worse; the air is impregnated by the effluvia of stagnant ditch-water in trenches choked up with rank weeds, which, as we have already observed, nearly close up the small apertures of the room, fifteen inches by twelve, which are called windows. Within the precincts of the quarantine there are no artisans; not a carpenter, tailor, or shoemaker ; not even a washerwoman. The linen that has been soiled by the gas-process cannot be made clean at this place. To each hovel there is, I believe, a Cossack or servant appointed to fetch in wood and water, which are gratuitously allowed. He who attended upon us was in himself a nuisance that no one who could avoid it would endure under the same roof. His quass stood fermenting in the door-way, attracting myriads of flies to blacken the adjoining walls. His couch was a bench in the passage covered with sheepskin cloaks and felts, in which were vermin of everyQUARANTINE. 291 kind. In his peison he was loathsome and disgusting; his pale face and his extremities were swelled, and he appeared to be la bouring under a salivation which was then subsiding; his dress and habits were so filthy, that it was really disgusting to allow him to bring any article of subsistence; but he alone was permitted to go out, and he knew where every thing that we wanted was to be procured. For ladies who are detained at this place on their return home, a regulation is made, by which the wife of the attending surgeon examines them. This is done in a manner equally indelicate with that in which the surgeon himself examined us, as already described. The apartments for ladies of course are distinct, and females alone are suffered to attend on them. The lower classes of Russians, however, have very little more sense of decency than savages ; we saw numbers of them running about the rivers at Mosdok, and at work in the boats or on shore, entirely naked. It is not unlikely that the habit of»smoking all day long greatly tends to prevent the ill effects of the noxious air in which the Rus sians habitually sleep. Ihis habit every stranger may not be dis posed to adopt; but there is another more unequivocally salubrious, which any one confined from one to six weeks in succession at a quarantine, should by no means forego. This is the exercise of walking to and fro in the open air, which should be practised as much as possible ; foi it is a well ascertained fact, that all persons who suddenly rest from the fatigues of travelling, become after the lapse of a few days of quiet, extremely predisposed to fever and to bilious complaints. When the place to which they are confined is low, damp, and exposed to the miasmata of rank and putrescent vegetation, they can with difficulty prevent the attacks of fevers and agues, particularly in autumn, when the atmosphere is alternately hot and humid. In fact, were I to be confined here for forty days, which would have been the case it I had brought with me woollen manu factures, I am certain that I should not escape fever unless I perse- p p 2292 QUARANTINE. vered in taking every possible precaution to avert it. lo the above predisposing causes to disease, may be added the want of rest, and the debility which it occasions. On enquiring of the commandant of the place for what reason clothes cannot be washed here, he stated that the water is so bad that it spoils them. He sends his own linen to a distance of thirty wersts to be there washed in good water. In the course of conver sation, he informed us that it was now eight years since any plague had appeared at this place. Wb were gratified to learn, that it is in contemplation to erect very speedily a new quarantine, or to place the present one in a complete state of repair. As the greatest torment and molestation during the hours of sleep proceed from fleas and mosquitoes, the traveller would do well to provide himself with loose silk trowsers and waistcoat in one piece, or with a bag to enclose the whole body at night, care being taken that no fleas obtain a lodgment within. To exclude mosquitoes, no contrivance is equal to that of coverings or veils of gauze. A suitable package might be easily devised for carrying these things in a small compass with the bed linen. The day after our arrival at the quarantine, another kibitka was brought to the barrier of it at an early hour, as was the case with us. Its passengers underwent the same ceremonies, and were detained more than two hours before they were sent to the adjacent village, at which they were to remain until accommo dations could be spared for them at the quarantine, which was then full. As soon as the carriage was announced, we saw the running foot men put on their black greasy clothes, and handling their tongs, march off like imps of darkness to the gate, to take the passports, which they brought back with them, and afterwards mixed up in front of the hovel some liquids which instantly emitted a most disagreeable vapour. Over this they held and turned about the papers, which are kept until the purifying process is over, and then examined by the superintendant.293 ANSWER FROM COUNT PLATOFF. It was observed to me, that as soon as a vacancy should occur by the liberation of any person from the quarantine the travellers in ques tion would be brought up, and undergo all the ceremonies that were piactised with regard to us ; but that the days during which they weie detained at the village would be counted as part of the term of quarantine. Perhaps of the two the village is the more desirable residence. Experience now enables us to advise, that the traveller should, on the day before he enters this place, be careful to select and keep apart from the rest of his effects a stock of provisions and of other articles necessary for his cleanliness, comfort, and convenience for twenty-four hours. Any letter which he may have to forward, should be ready written; it would even be preferable to dispatch it a day previous. Saturday, as we have observed, is the only post day at this place, and the charge by post is but six copecks for each letter; but for an express sent in a kibitka, the demand is eighteen roubles, thirty copecks. To save a great deal of trouble, all things of consequence should if possible be packed up in tin, and sealed at the quarantine of Mosdok; and the traveller should be provided with a number of tin boxes of various sizes to answer these purposes. On the return to India through Georgia, he will be subject to a considerable detention there, which he may in a great measure obviate by writing to either of the general officers in command, who, if they are still resident at Teflis, will, on ap plication, direct that nothing more shall be done than is absolutely necessary ; and perhaps the detention will not exceed twenty-four hours. July 30th. — At three in the afternoon we received an answer from Count Platoff, who most politely effected our release, sent Cossacks to prepare horses, and ordered two or three of them to escort us on horseback to his residence, Novo Tsherkask. Pre viously to our leaving the purgatory, however, we were required to change linen again, which was fumigated, and we were once moreDEPARTURE FROM QUARANTINE-HOUSE. 294 examined by the surgeon as to our respective state of health. I told him we were much more likely to be unwell now, than when we arrived. These ceremonies being ended, horses were put to the kibitka, and we left the pest-house with joyful hearts, expecting to rest better on the road in a jolting vehicle without springs than we were able to do in the quarantine. cm -cross VIDEO FOR l RISING COMM EIRE, — TRIl PIATOFF AT n ARE SHO' TENTATES. — TROPHIES OF WITH A CAR!

We went out by the north barrier along the stinking rivulet, which we crossed by a bridge, and soon gained the open plains. The village to which the recently arrived visitants at the quarantine were tem porarily removed was said to be a far more cleanly and desirable place than the quarantine itself, which was certainly very possible. Our road to the first post was over wide untilled plains of grass, level to all appearance as far as the eye could reach. Among the grasses we saw many pheasants, and several pairs of large birds re sembling the bustard. The road continued perfectly good to Negloi Egarlek, and onward from that place to Mechetinskaia, distant twenty-six wersts, over plains equally level. To Ragalnitskai, twenty-eight wersts, we journeyed over a more undulating tract, and crossed a bridge close at the post-house. Since leaving the quarantine, it has been our custom to give five copecksUKSYE. 296 to each of the postilions, and the same sum to each of the Cossack guards at every stage. The horses are small but strong, and very wild. They are caught when wanted, on the plains on which they pasture, by means of a rope and noose. On these extensive plains we observed a great number of stacks of hay, kept in store to be used on the road and at the posts and adjacent villages ; for the whole country swarms with draught-horses and horned cattle. To Bataiskaia, twenty-six wersts, the road was still uneven, but generally good, leading over plains as before. A river hows to the right of this scattered village. We proceeded to the town of Uksye, distant twenty-nine and a half wersts. In order to go to Novo Tsherkask it appears, that on leaving Bataiskaia we must have quitted the high road, which per haps goes to Old Tsherkask, for our path became smaller and ex tremely rough, so much so as to oblige us to drive much slower. Soon after quitting the post, we saw buildings extending along the front of a hill for miles, intermingled with spires and cupolas, which we afterwards ascertained to be the towns of Uksye and Old Tsherkask. At six wersts we came upon the river Don, which we followed, having it close on our right until we came to the ^floating bridge which leads over it to the town of Uksye. This place, large and straggling, occupies the acclivity of a hill rising from the right bank of the Don, which is here about three hun dred yards broad, and called the Uksye, the bridge being of that length. This bridge is built on floating rafts of timbers joined together, and is no where more than an inch or two above the water : in some places the pressure of a passing carriage causes the ' stream to flow over the planks. The bridge is about thirty feet wide, and the several platforms or rafts, each about eighty or a hundred feet in length, which form it, are united to each other by ropes and secured by grapnels. To admit the passage of boats up and down the river, one of these platforms is probably removed by being floated out of the way. We observed that the shores upUKSYE. 297 the course of the river from the bridge were covered by boats of differ ent dimensions, of one or two masts. The largest appeared to be of 150 tons. They are all built of deal, and some of them are 150 feet in length. Some of the platforms of the bridge have rails on the sides, others have not, but the ends of the timbers on which they float project a little out of the water in a curve upwards. The bridge on the whole is well contrived, as it rises and falls with the water, which is sometimes swoln much above its present level, and covers a large tract of flat country near Old Tsherkask. After crossing the bridge, the road turned and led along the right beach of the town, and thence ascended through the middle of it. All the houses are built of plank, having the gates and basement story very low; these and the enclosures are built of a yellowish sand or limestone. As each house has a considerable space of enclosure near it, the town extends over a large tract of ground, and its buildings are thus preserved from the spread of conflagration, as the planks used for fences may be easily removed, to prevent its communication. Uksye seemed to carry on a considerable trade in black naphtha, barrelled up to be used as tar ; timber planks ; new sledges and boats ; iron-ware, &amp;c. There are several churches and chapels, one of which in the middle of the town is of considerable magnitude. The style of these edifices partakes of the Moorish as well as the Christian ar chitecture. The cupolas and copper coverings of the roofs are painted green, as are also the roofs of some private houses. The upper balls and crosses are gilt; and the houses, although built of wood, have an air of great neatness in their exterior. After we had ascended to the summit of the hill, and had passed through the town, we proceeded over uncultivated plains by a road of many windings, to avoid acclivities, to a post-house standing isolated on a rising ground, distant altogether twenty-nine wersts and a half from our last station of Bataiskaia. Here we changed horses, and proceeded for Novo Tsherkask, the new capital of the Don Cos sacks, distant nineteen wersts and a half. The road was over the same range of uncultivated plains and heights; and here, as almost298 NOVO TSHERKASK. throughout this district, there is not a tree or large shrub to be seen, except within the gardens and enclosures of houses. In these there are very few vegetables or fruits ; only some apricots and bad apples. The total of this day’s march was one hundred and fifty-two wersts and a half, which was performed in fifteen hours and fifty-five minutes. The first aspect of Novo Tsherkask is extremely pleasing, as beheld from the top of a height where it appears to cover the whole sloping surface of another considerable eminence, and looks like a vast number of little detached villas, or ornamented cottages built in lines at right angles, with spaces for squares, and other openings among them. The churches, of which there are several, are all in open areas or squares, and the houses are built fronting toward them, which seems an excel lent arrangement, and worthy of being adopted in other towns. The whole of this capital is nearly new, and looks clean and regular. At the entrance, there is now in progress, but as yet unfinished, a kind of triumphal arch of considerable height, with columns, orna mented with pediments, on which statues are to be placed. They are erecting this in honour of the Emperor Alexander, who is expected here, and to whom, as I am informed, the Cossacks, as well as all the inhabitants, are enthusiastically attached. July 31st. — On our arrival at the town we were taken to an exceedingly good house of two stories, in a large square, and three of the best rooms in their furnished state were given up for our accommodation, the family there resident retiring to the other side of the house. Here we were soon visited by Count Platoff’s Secre tary, who, by his desire, acquainted us that he regretted that his country house was too small to admit of his receiving us there, parti cularly as he had given up a part of it to Mr. Strachey, who had arrived in ill health a few days before us; but he begged that we would allow him to send us wine, bread, game, and whatever provisions we wanted. These he afterwards supplied to us most abundantly, and the people of the house dressed our victuals. The Count also ordered a guard of a non-commissioned officer and six men to mount guard at our place of abode, to carry letters for us, and299 DON COSSACKS. to attend to all our wishes. We thus found ourselves most com- xortably settled, and attended upon nearly free of all expense. ount Platoff was at this time in a very infirm state of health, and extremely weak, yet his time was entirely devoted to public affairs, o which he is in the habit of attending principally at night, snatch ing a few moments of slumber when nature requires it; but he is no sooner awake again than his officers return to him to receive orders and resume the transaction of business. At his country house reside three English ladies, one of them a protegee of his, and the others her two friends: there is also a Mr. Wood, whose principal business, I believe, is to attend to the Count’s stud of brood horses, which, I am informed, are well worth seeing. He is also a companion to the ladies. As the Count is fond of the English, and shows them every possible attention, he will probably have many to settle here at no very distant period. A watch-maker, who speaks English well, is now established at Novo Tsherkask. There are many shops for all articles of cloth, iron and tin-wares', cutlery, earthen-ware, furs, &amp;c. The market which they occupy is covered over, after the manner of the Persian bazars. Its roof at present is merely of wood, but no doubt, as the population augments, it will be permanently constructed of stone. Here, as at many other Cossack towns and villages, there is evi dently a greater proportion of women and children than of men, which may be accounted for by the absence of the latter as soldiers, and also by the losses which the Hon Cossacks sustained in the late glorious struggle against the French. It must be observed that every Cossack, whether shopkeeper or artisan, is a military man, and that no proportion of the male population was exempted from attending the first of all military duties on that dreadful but honourable occasion. The profession of arms being thus general, is the reason also that a greater proportion of the oldest men are left at home; and this class alone accumulates; consequently they have now as many generals and colonels as subalterns. Within the town there are twenty general officers. Q Q 2300 DON COSSACKS. The men and women all dress in long upper garments; the men wear a thick woollen great-coat or cloak, with a little cap ; the women have a dress somewhat resembling a night-gown, opening down in front, under which appear a pair of loose drawers. The upper gar ment is made either of silk, damask, satin, or coloured cotton. On their heads they wear a knitted cap, of the same form as a night-cap, having two stripes, or being otherwise ornamented with coloured figures on the top. This is secured to the head by a coloured handkerchief bound tight round the forehead, the long corners being left to fall down the back. All young women, who have not been married, wear their hair plaited down the back, in the manner of the Indians; but those who are or have been married, exhibit no such streamer; yet the handkerchief (perhaps purposely) is so attached that the corners hang low down behind, and thus an observer is left in uncer tainty as to their youth and state in life, until he obtains a nearer inspection of the person. All articles of subsistence are very cheap here, and of good quality, as bread, milk, meat, grain, and fish, which is very fine indeed. They prepare, but I believe in this place only, clouted cream, like that made in Devonshire and in Ireland, which is a favourite luxury. They have fruit also for sale, but in no great abundance or variety ; as the town augments in the course of time, a greater quantity of different sorts will probably be grown. The bread, which is in exceedingly large round and flat loaves, is very superior, and the wines of the Don, resembling champagne in flavour, are acknowledged to be good. Sugar, tea, coffee, and almost every other article of con sumption in use among us, may be had here in plenty, and of good quality: in short a traveller may at this place provide himself with a complete supply of all the various articles which he may require on his journey. The features of the Don Cossacks are in general of the Chinese, or rather the Malay cast; the distinctive characteristics being small eyes and high cheek-bones. The women have little that is feminine in their appearance ; and they are said to be ill-natured and shrewishMODE OF PREVENTING DAMAGE BY FIRE. 301 in their tempers, always aiming to rule at home. They have all broad features, and are of a strong robust make ; many of them are of a form decidedly masculine and large, not easily distinguished from men by a stranger, from their abominable custom of flattening the shape of their bosoms ; and as they have no cincture round the waist, the loose wrapper or gown is incompatible with that tightness and neatness of appearance for which the females of our own country are so much admired. In this loose and ungainly attire, the Cossack women, with their broad coarse features, have a disagreeable mascu line appearance. In short their dresses and customs exhibit a gro tesque mixture of Moorish and Russian, The port of Odessa, which has lately been opened on the Black Sea, and is intended to be made a free port for ten years, is distant seven hundred wersts from Novo Tsherkask ; but by the navigation of the Sea of Azof, merchandize from England, which is much wanted here, might be brought considerably nearer. The articles chiefly in de mand are cutlery, brass-ware for doors, house-furniture, flannels, dimities, and fine cloths for shirts. The returns would be wheat and grain, wines of the Don, caviare, leather, and furs; also tar of the black naphtha; perhaps deals for spars, the prices of which are about one rouble per cubic foot. The port regulations of Odessa make con veyance of goods by carts very cheap ; and these vehicles might also be made to answer very well for articles of little weight With re spect to the circulating medium, the ducat is now worth eleven roubles; but it appears that exertions are now making in Russia to raise the paper currency, as it has latterly depreciated to one-fourth of its nominal value. At Tsherkask they have a curious regulation for the prevention of damage by fire. On a board, which is hung at each door to public view, are painted figures of the instruments which each house-keeper is to have in readiness, and to attend with, in case of a calamity of this kind. For example, at one door is the painting of a hatchet; at another, that of a water-barrel; at a third, buckets, or crow-bars, a ladder, or other implement. On any alarm of fire the house-keepers302 VISIT TO COUNT PLATOFF. are to proceed to the spot with their respective apparatus, of which they are ever reminded by the figures at their doors; and thus a pro per supply of the various things wanted in these cases of exigency may always be calculated upon. On farther observation I find that there are two triumphal arches now erecting in honour of the expected visit of the Emperor ; one on the north, and the other on the south extremity of the town : the cost of each in foreign workmanship, together with building materials and ornaments, is estimated at thirty thousand roubles. They are of one story, and have merely the arches and columns, there being no rooms nor any staircases to ascend to the top of them. As the sol diers perform all the mechanic and manual labour required, the ex pense of the erection is very much diminished. August 1st. — At five in the evening one of Count Platoff’s car riages and four, in which was his secretary, came to take us to his country seat to dine with him. This residence we found to be situ ated three miles distant, on the acclivity of a hill rising from the Uksye river, which now proves to be only another channel or back water from the Don at Old Tsherkask. On our arrival we were in troduced to the fine old Count, who expressed his utmost pleasure on seeing so many English at his house ; and during a long conversation carried on in French, on our part, through the secretary, who interpret ed to him in Russ, dwelt all the time on the very great honours and attention which he had received from the English while in England, and testified in strong terms his friendship for that nation. In the course of this interview liqueurs were brought, of two kinds, red and white, which were offered to us in small glasses, according to the universal custom in Russia, and were handed round to the rest of the company, consisting of general officers covered with stars and crosses of merit, old veterans with white hair and mustachios. We sat at this time in an open varanda which encompassed the Count’s private apartments. Dinner being announced we followed the Count to the octagon room in which it was served up. Of the party, besides Mr. Strachey, Captain Salter, and myself, there were two general officers,DINNER AFTER THE ENGLISH MANNER. 303 the commandant of the garrison, the secretary, the two aides-de-camp, two other officers, the post-master, and another gentleman. The Hetman seemed to take pleasure in copying the English even in their custom of dining late in the evening, and in the mode in which the repast was served up. At the ends of the table there were soups, fish, and meat; and in the middle were made dishes, sweetmeats covered with coloured salads. Every thing was served in plate. The Count himself did the honours of his own table; first undergoing the fatigue of helping every one to soup, sometimes even in the silver plates which were too hot to hold without pain. After the soups, the different dishes of meat, &amp;c. were brought round to each guest, ready cut up after the Russian usage. After partaking of various things before us, the hospitable veteran remarked to me that I had the portrait of His Royal Highness the Prince Regent on my wine-glass, and that to his health I could not refuse to drink a little of the wine of the Don, which he assured me was wholesome and would do me much more good than water. Although I had not for nearly twenty years been in the custom of taking any wine, I re plied, that on this occasion I would do all in my power to obey his wishes, and filled my glass. Fortunately, the wine, which to my taste was delicious, was very light, and much resembled champagne in its sparkling effervescence. Having once begun it was not pos sible for me to excuse myself, and I drank several glasses to different toasts among which was one to the Emperor of Russia, from a glass that stood before the Count, which he handed to me, having His Majesty’s portrait. His British Majesty’s health I also joined in. Our own healths, individually, were also toasted, and those of the general officers and of all the company. We lastly proposed to drink the Count’s health with long life to him, to which I added a hope that he would see the Cossack families who had lost their men in the cause of their country augmented to double the numbers they possessed before the war. After all, and on breaking up, the Count gave us one from himself, which was, “ The whole of the British na tion, his friends, and the sincere friends of Russia.” We then retired304 COUNT PLATOFFS VILLA. to the varanda for the sake of the cool air. The small handsome octagon room in which we had dined stood separate from the wings of the residence, and was connected with them merely by covered alleys of grape-vines. The private apartments formed one very exten sive wing to the right; that on the left contained probably apart ments for the officers of his staff, with subordinate rooms and out- offices. On the brow of a hill on our right, as we went to dine, I observed a temple apparently of an octagonal form, the road to which was through a vineyard. The buildings composing the man sion enclose an area within which the carriage turned, and drew up at the central part of the house. The front of the oblong quadrangle is bounded by a railing, and the entrance is by a large pair of folding gates. There was a tea-equipage placed in the back varanda in which we sat, and tea and coffee were made for us, which we took after the English manner, and were much gratified to find ourselves once more in the society of our countrywomen. The commandant of the garrison and the general officers also took tea, but with spirits instead of cream, and this mixture they called, out of complaisance, grog. They how ever soon retired. About this period of the visit I found an opportunity of speaking with the Count respecting a packet of a shawl which I had brought from India for the Countess of Baudicea at Sebastopol, sent to her from her brother, Major Willis, the town-major of Bombay. It was in a small round tin case, soldered down, which from its state of security had passed all the quarantines and had not been opened since we departed from India. The Count very obligingly gave it in charge to the post-master, with the letters which I had written to the Countess of Baudicea and to Mrs. Willis at Elmahieh. He ordered that it should be dispatched to the Countess, with whom he was not per sonally acquainted. This dispatch of the packet was a great relief to me, as I had found much difficulty in passing it through the quaran tines and custom-houses. Feeling anxious for the good character of the English I madeSPLENDID PRESENTS GIVEN TO COUNT PLATOFF. 305 I many enquiiies among the Russia officers as to the propriety of be haviour of those persons who had accompanied the Count about three years ago from England, and who still resided with him at his house in the country. It was with great pleasure that I heard the highest encomiums pronounced on their attentive and praiseworthy behaviour in every respect. It was described as altogether worthy of the esteem which it had so completely obtained of the Count him self. - - As we had heard much of the presents and orders of merit given to the Count for his extraordinary services and personal exertions, we were anxious to see them, and our wish was very soon gratified. We were conducted to one of the inner apartments, and there all these splendid insignia were separately shown to us. 1. A culguer or plume of diamonds and rubies, of very great value, given by the Emperor of Russia to the Count, as an ornament for his cap. It was too heavy to wear; but on all important public occasions he carries it in his hand. 2. A brilliant gold snuff-box, with the Emperor’s picture in it. 3. Another somewhat similar, bearing the portrait of the King of Prussia. 4. A sword which he highly valued, and to the hilt of which he had added several large brilliants. This was given him by the city of London, and bore an English inscription commemorative of his gallantry and of the high esteem entertained for his exertions in the great cause of the liberation of Europe. 5. What he valued still more, a medallion picture set in brilliants surmounted by a crown of the same, of His Royal Highness the Prince Regent of England. Besides these, there were many paintings of the Empress of Russia, the King and Queen of Prussia, with several other portraits presented to him on the part of the different allied powers. In short, all the orders of Russia have been conferred on him with many others, constituting altogether an assemblage of badges of honour more numerous perhaps than has fallen to the lot of any other individual.306 THE COUNT’S ATTACHMENT TO THE ENGLISH. These honourable memorials will be dear to his family and to their descendants, and will in fact be held in estimation by all the subjects of the Russian Empire, for whose welfare his life must have been devoted throughout a career of active warfare and of services fraught with peril. Ere I dismiss this subject, it may be proper to mention other un equivocal traits of his kindly disposition and great regard for the English. Mr. Strachey, from the time of his arrival at Tsherkask, having been very unwell, the Count, although his mansion was then full, assigned a room for his reception, and as his kibitka was far from comfortable, had given him a caleche of his own, for the con tinuation of his journey. On our arrival he had provided for us excellent quarters in town, and desired his secretary to express his regret that there actually was not room for us at his country resi dence. He also sent us, in much greater abundance than we re quired, a variety of viands and wines, and requested that we would use his carriages, and avail ourselves of the services of a non-com missioned officer and three mounted Cossacks at our pleasure. Before we had been introduced to the Hetman we had determined on departing from Novo Tsherkask after the dinner, but on men tioning our intention to his secretary, he replied that the Count was in hopes that we would have favoured him with our company for a much longer period, and that with this conviction he had delayed writing to His Royal Highness the Prince Regent and to his esteemed friends Lord Percy, Lord James Murray, and His Grace the Duke of Northumberland, to whom he wished that we would take letters for him. He added that as Sunday was a very great festival, no less than the birth or rather saint’s day of the Empress Dowager, he wished us to be present at the solemnity, and afterwards he would not farther trespass on our time. The moment the secretary mentioned the Count’s letters, we begged him to say no more, and assured him we should feel it our duty to wait until he had written his letters, of which we should take charge with real pleasure. We herefore determined to postpone our departure until Sunday, after the breaking up of'the dinner party.

We of course engaged to take a few bottles in the carriage as samples, agreeably to his desire. Among various remarks in the course of conversation, the Count obseived that we must look upon the extensive plains of pasturage around us as the nursery of horses for the cavalry of Russia, and that they were as essential to her power as inhabitants and cultivation; that grain was abundant all over the Empire, and that much more ground, now fallow, was ready to be added to the districts appro priated to the growth of wheat whenever it should be required. Respecting horses, his own opinion was, that those of the Karabaug, of the Persian breed, crossed by the Arabian, were the best for all the purposes of cavalry. On my mentioning the horses of Kabarda, he said they were high-spirited, well made, and of a good size; but, like most others of the finer sort of horses, they required great attention and care in the grooming and feeding, without which they fell off in condition. August 2d. — In the evening we went to see the honorary colours, letters of thanks, and various military trophies of the regiments of the Don Cossacks, deposited at Novo Tsherkask, as their head quarters, and which they had acquired at various periods since the reign of the Empress Elizabeth. The custom of conferring these honours upon them seems to have been continued from that period. We were conducted in the first place to the council-room, where we saw several excellent pictures of the Emperor Alexander, of the Empress Catherine, a very good portrait of the Emperor Paul, and one large full length picture of Peter the Great. There was also one of the noted Cossack chieftain, who conquered the people of the Caucasus. The paintings are very well executed. At the head of the council table is the chair of the Count as r r 2308 MILITARY TROPHIES OF THE COSSACKS. Hetman, and on the sides are placed four chairs for various general officers who assist as councillors. The first chair on the right, assigned to Major General RadivonofF, as second in command, is permanent; the others are possessed every three years in succession by councillors appointed from among the many general officers within the districts of the Don. In the middle of the table stood a very remarkable ornament, in form resembling a sarcophagus; on examining which, I found that each of its sides had a different written instrument or deed upon it, which together contained copies of the oaths taken by the members of the council, and of the orders (or ukases) issued by the Emperors concerning their duties ; so that in fact the councillors when assembled have not only their oaths, but their duties ever pre sent to their eyes. We next descended to the rooms in which the banners and tro phies were deposited; the door was opened with very great solemnity, and those only were admitted to whose custody they were entrusted, and who conducted us as visitors; it was closed as soon as we had entered. Then the folding-doors of some large presses or cases were opened. There were drawers in which the colours of each department were separately deposited, of which the greater part were shown to us; but the number was so great that it would have re quired almost a day to inspect them in detail. They were all ban ners of satin or damask embroidered with gold, with fringed bullion, and other decorations of the same metal. The colours of the silk ground were green, blue, yellow, white; on some were painted va rious saints; most of them bore representations of St. George and the Dragon ; but on others there were large embroidered crosses of gold on a silver ground, bordered with medallions of arms, &amp;c. Others again had the spread eagle superbly embroidered; and along with each standard was a box containing the letter or testimonial, written on the occasion upon which the colours were conferred. , These memorials were mostly bound up like books in velvet, with ornaments and tassels, and clasps of solid gold, having a gold box annexed containing the seal of government.RUSSIAN SPRING CARRIAGES. 309 The writing was chiefly on leaves of vellum, the edges and borders of which were highly ornamented, and at the bottom there were small paintings or vignettes, representing the acts or battles which had obtained those rewards. Some of them were painted on satin, and the pages were all interleaved with silk. Each banner was bordered with an inscription in large characters, either of gold or of some striking colour, containing the name of the Emperor or Empress who conferred this honorary badge, and record ing also the occasion and the date. A particular description of these valuable and interesting memorials is now preparing, for the purpose of being annexed to the history of the Cossacks, and of their Hetman, Count PlatofF, by his secretary, Mr. Smir- nikofl! Until that authentic detail appears, any attempt to describe them from recollection must be necessarily defective and unsatis factory. We passed down by the new bridge of boats over a branch of the Don, in the line of the Moscow road, and inspected the triumphal arch which they are erecting there, as the Emperor is expected to enter Novo Tsherkask in that direction. We then rode round to look at several vehicles on springs, of the caliche and dormeuse kind, of which many were shown to us, at different prices, from 1200 to 2500 roubles ; that at the highest price was certainly a very elegant carriage, and nearly new. It was what we call a barouchette, fitted up with boxes and every other requisite for travelling, and was stated to have cost 2000 roubles at St. Petersburg. We desired that it might be purchased for us, as it would enable us to save a great deal of time in travelling by night as well as day, which in a kibitka cannot be done without a great deal of jolting, because, as holes and obstructions in the road are not perceptible in the dark, we may be asleep at the moment of passing them, and may be exposed to sudden shocks that are not unat tended with danger. A vehicle with springs in some degree alle viates these inconveniences, and places the traveller much more at310 COUNT PLATOFF PRESENTS US WITH A CARRIAGE, After sunset we were gratified by the arrival of Count Platoff, who came to return our visit. He drank tea with us; and in the course of conversation I accidentally mentioned that his Secretary had had the kindness to assist us in looking out for a carriage, and had actually met with an excellent one, nearly new, which we had requested him to purchase for us. I had imagined that the Count would be pleased on hearing that this good office had been performed towards us ; but on the contrary, he declared that the carriage in which he had come should be given to us, and begged our acceptance of it for his sake, hoping that we would keep it in remembrance of him. I endeavoured to decline accepting this pre.- sent in every possible way. Mr. Grassman, who interpreted for us with the Count respecting our intended purchase, mentioned to him the person to whom the carriage belonged; but the Count, address ing him in the Russian language, enjoined him, as he valued his friendship, not to allow us to purchase any thing here, saying, “ these “ Englishmen will go away, but you will remain behind; if they “ buy any carriage, you shall never see my face again: you must “ tell them it is a mistake, and the carriage cannot be sold. &lt;c I shall send them one of mine. Now,” continued he, “ as you “ value my support, say nothing of this until they have my car- “ riage.” The Count remained until nine at night, and then went home. On the next day I found that he had again sent to Mr. Grassman, to inform him that at one o’clock the carriage would be sent to us; that it was very convenient, would hold four per sons inside, and would carry two boxes in front and rear. This, of course, made us relinquish our attempt to purchase a new carriage, though not without some anxiety lest his liberality should occasion him inconvenience, for as he had already given a carriage to Mr. Strachey, we could not conceive that he had any remaining, but those required for his establishment. We understood, however, that he had sent for more from St. Petersburg. Our kibitka, with the bedding and other equipments, must there fore be left behind. I would here recommend strongly to allVISIT TO THE CATHEDRAL. 311 tiavelleis from the east, to purchase, at first, the best carriage they can meet with for their homeward route. They should be particular in purchasing one with a pole, and not with shafts, as the post- horses of any other country than Russia cannot be harnessed to shafts constructed on the Russian plan. Wherefore, had we even proceeded in the kibitka, we must necessarily have discontinued it at Kiew, or at all events at Warsaw, beyond which it could not have been used. A traveller from India may calculate on obtaining a carriage on springs, of one kind or other, at any part of the route from Teflis to Georgewesk; and if not, he ma^y be sure to supply himself here, as there are many of various descriptions in all parts of the town. August 3d. This day being Sunday, when all classes of people attend church, we had an excellent opportunity of observing their costume. The ladies were very gaily dressed in silks of various colours, rose, pink, blue, &amp;c. &amp;c. Their gowns were in the form of a pelisse, open in front and reaching to the heels, without folds or buttons, fastened round the waist in some instances with a riband. At one o clock we repaired to the new cathedral church, and as the service was already begun we waited a little, and took an opportunity of going in while the Te Deum was singing. Count Platoff and all his officers were present in their full uniforms, decorated with stars and orders. We walked up the centre aisle, and placed ourselves near the Count. The service was chaunted in a very impressive manner; there were no musical instruments, but the chorus of voices produced a very grand effect. At particular periods of the service, some small guns, that were placed near the church, were fired. The dresses of the canons and other ecclesiastics, as well as the gold and silver orna ments on the images of saints and on the canopies over them, were very splendid and magnificent. At two, the service being ended, the Count returned home to take some repose from the fatigues of the morning and of the preceding day, in order to recover strength to do the honours of the public dinner, at six in the evening, which his rank and important station required him to give, in honour of theSLAVERY. birth-day of the Empress Dowager, or rather of the day of her patron saint, which is kept all over Russia as a solemn festival. The ceremonies incumbent on the Count on this occasion are, to receive, at eleven in the forenoon, the addresses and congratulations of all the inhabitants, and to entertain a large party of them at a public dinner in the evening. Although a great number of equipages attended the church, yet I was informed that there was present only one General Officer, with his family, out of twenty who generally reside at Tsher- kask, but who were at this moment at their country seats. Consider ing the population of the place, the church was, on the whole, but thinly attended. Among the inhabitants there are, besides Cossacks, foreigners of various countries ; several Germans, established as vint ners, or rather makers of wine, and also brewers; they have settled here but recently. One of that nation teaches French at the public school. Mr. Grassman is married to a Polish lady; and I find there are seven or eight more ladies of that nation resident here, who are generally very accomplished, and are greatly admired. They almost all speak French, and form among themselves a little society a la Fran $aise. Slavery exists here. Men, women, and children, are sold to Rus sians, or to foreign settlers, on what are called very moderate terms. A servant maid in robust health, about seventeen years of age, was pointed out to me as having cost three hundred roubles paper, or about fifteen pounds sterling. There are domestics of the same kind in almost every family. For the short time that we resided here, our &gt;vashing was under taken by our hostess, who employed her female slaves in this work. She charged for about 100 various articles, from a shirt to a neck- handkerchief, ten pounds of soap, and twenty roubles for washing; a most unconscionable demand, which was made, no doubt, as an equi valent for house-rent. According to a late regulation by the Emperor, merchants are pre vented from obtaining padrojnas, or written orders for post-horses, for the carriage of their goods, especially in places or on roads muchDEPARTURE OF MR. STRACHEY. house, where he is aware that horses are kept, and thus the iourney is continued from village to village, the halt being always made at private houses; but this is done at a greater expense than that which is incurred in travelling by the government post. Horses are to be had, however, at each stage ; and a traveller with merchandise may move from one side of Russia to the other with very little difficulty, and at a very moderate rate, as it is indeed but little higher than the charges of the government post, which are extremely small. They are now budding a new cathedral church of stone at Tsher- kask, which is to be as large as any in Russia; yet they have already six different churches, at which service is performed on Sundays and holidays. The Cossacks are very religious; and although there are some divisions in their tenets, the orthodox mode of worship is that of the Greek church. Mi. Strachey, finding himself sufficiently recovered to proceed, had left Tsherkask two days before that fixed for our departure; he was attended by a young French servant, who spoke a little Russ, and whom he had engaged to accompany him to Hamburgh. We had delayed our departure solely for the purpose of taking charge of Count Pla- toff’s letters. The exhaustion caused by continued attention to public business had prevented him from writing these letters until the evening of Monday the 4th of August, when we waited on him for the purpose of taking leave. It was not until 10 P. M. that we were able to get away, in the caleche which he was so kind as to have repaired for us. s s314 TAKE LEAVE OF THE COUNT. This vehicle, although roomy, was rather too venerable, and had not a very promising appearance; we regretted much the necessity of relinquishing our original intention to purchase the best and strongest we could get, but we could not thwart or contravene the kindness manifested in this liberal and truly hospitable offer. While we were engaged in taking leave of the Count, and of the officers and other individuals of his family, he had, as we afterwards found, given private directions for storing our carriage with provisions, wine, game, and even fruit packed in large wide-mouthed bottles. He had likewise ordered that a non-commissioned officer should precede us in a kibitka to prepare post-horses, and that a guard of mounted Cossacks should accompany our carriage to the confines of the district of the Don. It was not until he was satisfied that all these arrange ments had been made, and that all was ready for our secuiity and accommodation, that he allowed us to depart. The frank, open, and unrestrained hospitality of this veteran warrior could not fail to in spire us with the warmest feelings of respect. We had come upon him, as it were, without formal introduction, and with no other claim to his notice than that of our being British officers, and we were received on the footing of friends who had been long acquainted. That qualification of being British officers alone seemed a sufficient passport to his regard; and he appeared happy in having an oppor tunity to testify his sincere friendship for a nation which had greeted him with so many expressions of esteem and admiration. The recep tion accorded to him and to his brothers in arms, on their visit to England, has been censured by some as having been too ostentatious and unnecessarily expensive; but this narrow view of the matter will surely be abandoned, when it is known with what kindly feelings the compliment has been remembered. It was very easy to see that Count Platoff really delighted to speak of England; and that his en comiums were not the mere dictates of courtesy, but flowed sponta neously from the heart. That national hospitality cannot be con demned as either prodigal or ill-judged, which produced these happyREMARKS. 315 results, however unlocked for, in countries where we had scarcely been known, even by name. If it tended to make foreigners better acquainted with the British character, it increased their friendship for us, and produced an impression on the continental nations more per manently favourable than any act of mere policy could have done.316 CHAPTER XVII.

On leaving Tsherkask, our road led directly past the Count’s country house, then ascended a hill, and afterwards continued good until we reached the post-house ; We proceeded to Bobinskaia, forty wersts, in four hours and a half, over uncultivated plains, or rather over high grounds, along which the road wound very much in order to avoid the declivities. All this tract was covered with abundance of grasses and weeds. At Bobinskaia there was a post-house, but no village. August 5th. — The road to Prechebinskaia, nineteen wersts, was more uneven, and led over a country destitute of trees, and very lonely, presenting a few huts at distant intervals, and having nume rous stacks of hay and grain. We proceeded to Essenowskaia, twenty- one wersts, in two hours and a quarter. By the Count’s orders we had been furnished with six horses, although we paid for only four, and this favour continued to the boundary of his district. Our road to this post was rendered deep and toilsome, by a heavy fall of rain, accompanied with thunder and lightning; we were still travers ing the solitary unappropriated tract around the Cossack capital, bare of trees, but abundant in forage. There was not a village within view. Our road to Holadsnaia, twelve wersts, was still over plains, and much lighter, as the weather was good. At nine wersts, weVILLAGES. 317 crossed a bridge, and passed a village on our right called Bobrikow, he first that we had seen since leaving Tsherkask, a distance of nearly 146 worsts: here we observed a considerable extent of culti vated ground. Our next stage was to Essaolooskaia, twenty-five wersts, on a very uneven road leading over heights. At seventeen worsts, we crossed another bridge over a rivulet flowing to the right • and under a hill covered by trees on the left, was the village of akowka. The post of Essaolooskaia, we found to be situated on the same rivulet. To Ivanoffskaia, twenty-five wersts, the last post in the district of the Don Cossacks, the road was good, but over hilly ground. Here the Cossack guard that had accompanied us from Tsherkask left us ; we gave the non-commissioned officer a letter for Mr. Smirnoff, and presented him with five roubles ; the guard at Tsherkask had received twenty-five roubles for five men. It was nine at night before the Cossacks departed ; we then, after refreshing ourselves with tea, re sumed our route, ascending a hill under a heavy storm of rain. We had now to encounter a little ill fortune; the night was extremely daik, the roads near the village were numerous, and we lost our way a short time after quitting the post. We continued crossing from one road to another, pursuing each of them a little way ; and were in this state of embarrassment for some hours, when at length we perceived the werst post, and were thus assured that we had regained the high road. These werst posts answer to our mile-stones, but they serve the purpose much better, and are of great advantage to travellers in this solitary country, being fifteen feet high, and therefore visible at a considerable distance on these flat plains. We reached An- dreanopolskaia, distant seventeen and a half wersts from the last post, in four hours fifteen minutes. The high road when we had regained it, proved to be much smaller, and less distinctly marked than that which we had previously travelled. We continued our route to Tiherpoochina, fifteen wersts, (three hours). The rain had moistened the black soil of the road, and rendered it heavy ; we continued our route for three hours, and arriv-418 VILLAGES. at the post by day-light on the 6th. Here was a small village, with others in its vicinity, surrounded by cultivated grounds. We travelled the next stage, twenty-five wersts, in two hours and a half, by a deep road over uncultivated land, £o the large village of Longinskaia. The route to the town of Baukmoot was uneven, but rather better; we crossed a bridge over a rivulet at the entrance of the town, which contains three churches, and has a market. We halted at what was denominated a tavern kept by a Jew, at which we found nothing to eat, although the host told us on our arrival, that he could give us some roast mutton. In order that we might compensate him for any trouble, we desired him to prepare us some coffee, but he told us, that for two large cups of the best coffee, he charged five roubles ; judging from this subterfuge in the way of extortion, that he was unprovided with either mutton or coffee, we left the house, and having purchased some lemons and bread in the market went to the post-house. The road from hence to Kopauky, twenty wersts, was up and down heights the whole way. We observed a few houses on the declivity of an eminence, and soon after descended to the village situated in a valley. After a considerable ascent from the post-house, the road, though over uneven ground, continued good to Slaviansk, twenty-four wersts, one hour and three quarters: on entering the town we crossed a bridge over a river of moderate size, flowing to the right. Slaviansk consists of some scattered dwellings situated on the left bank of this river. The charge for post-horses to this place from the boundary of the Don Cossacks is five roubles each per werst. We went the next stage of thirty wersts in three hours and a half, over a very good road, to Delginskaia. August 7th.—The road continued pretty good to the town of Issi- oum, distant eighteen wersts, one hour and forty-five minutes. This place appears to have been formerly fortified, being surrounded by a ditch with guard-rooms at intervals. The higher quarter is now ne glected, but in going through the lower part, bordering on the river iACCIDENT ON THE ROAD. 319 Donetta, we found many new houses building, and a fine church nearly completed. The market is extensive, and there is much cultivated ground in the vicinity. We here found that we had been deceived at Slaviansk, having been made to pay five copecks per horse for seventy- two wersts, the amount of the three last stages, when the proper charge was only three copecks; on complaining of this to the post- mastei of Issioum, he merely observed that the proprietor of the post lived at Hurkoff, on our road onward, and gave us his name. August 8th. We set out for Savinsti distant thirty-two wersts. When we had gone above half the distance, one of the front wheels of our vehicle broke down, and we were obliged to go back half a mile to a hut which we had passed near the road. As we were not near any town we had no hope of obtaining the assistance of a regular coach-maker, but we were informed that the owner of the cultivated lands near this place resided at a farm-house about three wersts distant, where he kept a large establishment of ar- tificeis, and that if we wrote to this gentleman in French, requesting that he would order his artificers (slaves) to repair the wheel for us, he would do so with pleasure, and would allow us to pay for the work. We accordingly put the pieces of the broken wheel into a light kibitka lent to us by the inhabitants of the hut, and our servant having yoked one of the post-horses to it, mounted the vehicle and drove to the gen tleman’s house. He was absent, having gone with his finest equipage to the fashionable watering-place already mentioned, near Georgewesk. It seems that gentlemen of landed property in Russia, not unlike some of those of England and Ireland, value their estates solely as affording the means of procuring them a residence in luxurious cities, or in other places of fashionable resort, where they often dissipate their funds very speedily in gaming, or in expensive entertainments. The money thus thrown into circulation, may, in the possible course of things form part of their next year’s receipts, and this consideration perhaps operates as a palliative to that troublesome malady, the con sumption of the purse. In the absence of his master, the superin- tendant of the workmen undertook that they should repair the wheel,320 LOWER CLASSES OF RUSSIANS. requesting that the letter might be left with him for the gentleman’s perusal, which was done. At three in the afternoon of the next day the wheel was brought back in a state of repair, for which we paid fif teen roubles, and we disbursed five more in expences at the hut, and in small presents. Having kept the post-horses and fed them while delayed at this hedge ale-house, we set out as soon as the wheels were adjusted. At this place we had some opportunities of observing the way of life pursued by the lower classes of Russians. They seemed to be in a state of plenty; yet in my opinion, when compared with persons of the same rank in England, they appeared to be habitually filthy in a very great degree ; their servants both male and female were most coarsely fed, badly clothed, and subjected to incessant drudgery, stacking corn, driving horses and cows, or carrying water from a great distance. We travelled the remaining sixteen wersts to Savinsti in an hour and a half. The road was narrow, uneven, and bad, the soil generally wretched, and toward the latter end rather sandy. The village is large, and is intersected by a small rivulet. We proceeded to the extensive village of Balaclea, nineteen wersts, an hour and a quarter, by a deep sandy road, though leading fre quently over rising grounds. The scenery around was fine, alternating from coppices and plantations of timber to tilled lands, and assuming in many places the aspect of a park. The horses were excellent, and wherever the road would admit of it, we went on at a rapid rate. This part of the country, indeed, presents a most enlivening change; here are more cultivated grounds, more wood, a greater abundance of forage and water; the villages are more thickly strewn, and the inha bitants are more numerous. We now began to pay for five horses, and the people at the post-houses frequently tried to make us pay for six. The dwellings in the villages were for the most part surrounded by kitchen-gardens well stocked with cabbages and other esculent plants. There was a cavalry regiment stationed at Balaclea, then training to the use of the Polish lance; we saw some of the men at exercise, who had all swallow-tailed flags attached to theirCHARKOV. 321 lances, which they carried upright on the right stirrup, and fastened by a belt over the right shoulder. We proceeded twenty wersts by a deep sandy road over a plain, to Andrewka, a large village on a rivulet that joins the Donetta. From this place to Zmiew or Smioff, twenty-seven wersts, the first part of the road was good, and over plains, but for the last three wersts it was bad. We crossed two small bridges, and a large one very near the town, which is very extensive, but scattered and irregular. The road hence to Besbowdowka, twenty-four wersts, was deep and sandy, passing occasionally through close wood, where it was frequently narrow. On setting out, we crossed a bridge over a branch of the Donetta, and after travelling eighteen wersts, arrived by nine in the morning, at the town of Charkov, situated on the Donetta ; it is well built, and has many churches, bridges, barracks, and other public edifices. Here are several inns ; that to which our postilion took us was kept by a Jewess, yet the accommodation was tolerably good and clean, considering the country, but the charges were exorbitant. For these and for many other attentions to travellers the hostess is noted, though they are generally too extravagant to produce their intended effect. There are two coachmakers established here, and the town abounds with vehicles of all the different kinds used in Russia. The carriage-horses are generally very fine; but the method of driving three abreast is very injudicious ; the middle horse alone trots, and as the others canter or gallop with their heads diverging outwards, they can assist but little in the draught, and have certainly a very awkward appearance. We here began to surmise that a secret understanding existed between the masters of post-houses and those of the taverns or inns for their mutual interest; the former studying to retard the progress of the traveller in order that he may be obliged to benefit the latter by a longer delay. Word was brought to us that there were no horses to be had at the post-house, and that as several gentlemen had been waiting before us, we could not be supplied with any until night. Suspecting that there was some collusion in this, I ordered my servant to try to hire four or six to take us on to the next stage; T T\ 322 DELAYS AT THE POST-HOUSES. he was told that forty roubles was the charge for twenty wersts, though the post charge for that distance is only three roubles ; we offered ten, and a present of two to the post-boy who should bring the horses, but without effect. We wished also to get our wheels changed for four new ones, to be fitted to our carriage before night-fall. The expence demanded was 300 roubles, which we of course deemed too exor bitant to be incurred. At length, in the evening, having declared that we would on no account sleep at this inn, we succeeded in obtaining horses, by bribing the post-boys to apprize us when any arrived at the post- house. Delays of this kind must be apprehended at all large towns, in a country where travelling by post is so very cheap. A regulation might surely be made by which all tavern and inn holders should be obliged to keep a certain number of horses, as auxiliaries to those of the post-establishment, and until this, or some other expedient is adopted to obviate the delays of travelling, it is advisable for a stranger not to go to the inns in the first instance, but to drive di rectly to the post-house, and there to enquire particularly for horses, and get his padrojna registered in the book kept for that purpose, because, should another traveller subsequently arrive, and be beforehand in using this precaution, he will be first served. Some times a small bribe to a stable-boy or hostler, to keep a look out for horses, and give notice of their arrival, will be efficacious. If none are to be had at the post-house, recourse must be had to the town, and in this case the traveller may resort to an inn. He may there remain while the horses are putting to, and even should he detain them there a short time, the delay seems to give no kind of umbrage to the owners or the postilions. In this respect, the Russian post boys and horses, are more entirely at the service and disposal of the traveller, than those of most other countries. About nine o’clock we got away from this Jewish inn, and from the courteous invitations of the Dalilah who kept it, and were highly satisfied when our horses had passed out at the gate, as the delay in itself objectionable, would have been rendered doubly vexatious byVALKY. 323 the numerous impositions, and exorbitant charges to which it would have exposed us. We proceeded 20 wersts by a deep and sandy road to the village of Liouboutin, where we found a tracteur or inn keeper, established near the post-house. Here, as before, there were no horses, and we were recommended to the inn, but we went to sleep in the carriage, and did not get away until eight in the morning, aftei bieaktast, as there were no horses to be hired in the village. August 10. (Sunday.)—The road, which led through cultivated plains was generally 100 feet in breadth. It may here be remarked that as the country is flat, the roads are not made, but are left of very great width, in order to afford ample choice of ground for a carriage to move over, while those parts that have been most cut up are left fallow, and recover themselves in time. The great extent of uncul tivated land admits of these spacious roads, without inconvenience to individuals. No rates are imposed for the purpose of raising funds to repair them, nor would any be very productive, for they are but little frequented, considering the cheapness of travelling. On this stage we passed through several tracts covered with wood, which contributed to render the country very picturesque and delightful. At the end of 28 wersts we arrived at Valky, a large straggling town situated in a valley. The people were preparing to go to church in their Sunday dresses ; that of both men and women con sisted principally of a long woollen garment of their own manufac ture, reaching to the ankles, the only distinction being, that the men wore a kind of striped red and yellow , , or blue cloth, like a sash round their waists, and the women had nothing of the kind. The head-dresses of the latter consisted of a cap, or a sort of bandeau of cloth round the head, left open at the top, where flowers were stuck in their hair. They wore party-coloured petticoats and boots. Although it is said that a person ought not to look at ahorse given him, in the mouth, as much as to say, that his age, when obtained for nothing, ought not to be noticed, yet travellers ought surely not to follow this advice, with regard to either horses or carriages, which if very old, and received in a present, only impede their hi- t t 2324 POULTAWA. ture movements. In travelling, as in war, delays are expensive? and a present of this kind is no saving. The road hence to Kolkoemak, twenty-five wersts, was a little cut up, but by no means bad. However, at the distance of eight wersts from the place, one of the hind wheels broke to pieces, and the car riage came down on its side, luckily without hurting any one. This was the second accident of the kind within five days, that befel our luckless vehicle. It was two o’clock in the day, and the sun was shining hot in our faces. We after some delay tied a long piece of wood to the carriage, to serve for a wheel, and had then to walk over sandy roads, nearly six miles to the town, which we accomplished by five in the evening, not without the inconveniences of some blisters on the feet. Having been for some weeks unused to walking, my feet were much swelled with this exertion. We took some refreshment, and then procured two kibitkas with six horses to convey us and our baggage onward, leaving the broken- down caleche, with the post-master, who engaged to send it after us to Poultawa, seventy-five wersts, for fifty roubles. He furnished also the covered kibitka in which we journeyed to that place. The other kibitka carried the servant and baggage. Our first stage was a long one, thirty-eight wersts, to Zenowska, and occasionally over very rough ground. The rate at which we went was about sixteen wersts an hour ; the carriage having no springs, and being withal rather too narrow for two persons, we were dreadfully jolted, bruised, squeezed, and cramped. This mode of travelling appears to me not only annoying, but even dangerous to health, on account of the bodily agitation, and head-ach which it produces. Our next stage, eighteen wersts, to Daubinowska, was over a good though sandy road, and we had excellent post-horses. Another stage of twenty wersts brought us to Poultawa. The first aspect of this town is fine; it is seen at the distance of three wersts on a woody height, which seems crowned with its churches, and other public edifices. On ap proaching the foot of this hill, we crossed a number of rivulets by several small, and one large bridge, and ascended through streets ofINviTATION FROM PRINCE REPNIN. 325 houses, interspersed with trees. The houses in general seem of much older date, than those of most other towns on our route. There is a new squaie not jet completely finished, which surrounds the monu ment erected to commemorate the victory gained by the Czar Peter over Charles XII. of Sweden. The houses forming this square are of superior elegance. The monument is a pillar surmounted by an eagle, carrying in its bill a crown of laurel. Its base, surrounded by a railing formed of crosses, bears an inscription on its sides, with the date 1709. The entire pillar, from its colour, appears to be of bronze ; perhaps it is only coloured to imitate it. The ground on which the Swedes were encamped, and which is still to be tiaced by the lines, partly filled up, is now enclosed within the beautifully shaded and retired garden of Prince Repnin, where the heat of the day seldom penetrates, and where, although within the precincts of a populous city, the calmest tranquillity prevails. There is a pavilion in one of its sides, which commands some rather extensive and very picturesque views. At this sultry season the shaded avenues of the garden afforded a most agreeable retreat. On our arrival in the town we had some difficulty in procuring tolerable accommodation in one of the inns; and after all we found the style of serving up food in them, and the state of the beds, alto gether filthy. Letters to Prince Repnin had been given us by the worthy General Yermoloff, to whose kindness we were indebted for all the pleasant moments of our journey through Russia. Having sent these letters, we shortly afterwards received a most obliging invitation from the Prince to dine with him. At three o’clock we waited upon him in his garden retreat, where he and his amiable princess received us, and we dined in a deep recess in a grove or wood, which rendered the repast quite delightful. The party consisted only of five ; the Prince, his consort, his aide-de-camp, M. Ribicoff, and ourselves. We were regaled with all the delicacies of the season, and a variety of fine fruits, melons, pines, cherries, &amp;c. with madeira, champagne, and other choice wines. After walking in the shaded garden for an hour,326 DEPARTURE FROM POULTAWA. we retired, and again returned to teal at nine o’clock, after which a most friendly and agreeable conversation was kept up until twelve, when we took leave of our very amiable hosts. August 12.—We excused ourselves from attending at a public feast given this day in honour of the marriage that was then to take place between the grand Duke Nicholas of Russia, with the Princess, sister to the King of Prussia. We were occupied in hastening the neces sary repairs of our carriage, which were at length effected, not however without the unexpected and unsolicited kindness of the Prince, who, I found, being informed of our troubles, had sent an officer of police to desire the coachmakers to attend to our wishes, and treat us as his friends. In consequence of this intimation, they took off the wheels from another carriage then on sale, and fitted them to our own vehicle, receiving the old wheels in return, and charging four hundred and fifty roubles. We might, however, have purchased a new travelling caleche for one thousand six hundred roubles, and this we should have had no hesitation in doing, had it not been our wish to keep whatever remained of the old carriage, in remembrance of the excellent-hearted Count Platoff. Having once more launched the caleche, fitted up with curtains as a screen from the evening sun, we resumed our journey at four in the morning of the 13th August. We had previously taken leave of our most worthy hosts, the Prince and Princess, who expressed a strong wish that we might return to Poultawa, at the period of the arrival of the Emperor and the grand Duke, who were expected in about a month, and on which occasion 50,000 men were to be reviewed by His Majesty and his Imperial brother. It was expect ed that at this review would be practised all the evolutions and movements of the memorable battle and victory of Poultawa. The Prince also assured us that it would give His Majesty and His High ness satisfaction to see us present at this grand spectacle. These honours, however gratifying they might be to our feelings as English officers, we could not, of course, stay to receive ; but we had an am ple earnest of the condescension of the Emperor and the Grand Duke,VISIT TO GENERAL PAPOFF. 327 their polite assurances and invitation of Prince Repnin. We may here again remark the good effects of the courteous reception accorded by our rulers, and indeed by the nation at large, to those august strangers on their visit to London, the remembrance of which will no doubt be cherished by the Russians for years to come. It has tended to multiply acts of reciprocal good will, and to enlarge that friendly intercourse between two independent nations, which must tend to give permanence to that good understanding between them, which, from the present distance of the Russian boundaries from our own, may be expected. We had deferred our departure until the morning, in order that we might not arrive too early at the residence of General Papoff, one of the privy councillors of state, to whom we had letters from his son-in-law in Persia. Our first stage was to Kowleichowka, twenty- one wersts, by a very good road over a flat country^ It continued so throughout the next stage of twenty wersts, to the large vil lage of Richetelowka, in the middle of which stood the mansion of General Basilowitch Papoff, conseiller prive actuel de Vempire. When we arrived at the post-house, an officer came with a message from the General to invite us to come to his house and be his guests. It is ne cessary here to observe, that a young lady, to whom we had been intro duced the evening before, at the house of Prince Repnin at Poultawa, had then requested us not to arrive at Richetelowka before nine o’clock, and it was at her instance that we had delayed our departure as already stated. We now recollected that a carriage and four horses had very rapidly passed us on the road, and it appeared that the lady travelling in it had hastened to apprize the General that we should very shortly arrive at the post-house with his son’s letter. After washing ourselves, therefore, and without waiting to change our dress, being determined not to stay, as the General’s carriage had been sent for us, we pro ceeded in it to his residence. On our arrival we were introduced to him in a suite of apartments, all the walls of which were decorated with paintings, drawings and prints; the furniture was of ancient fashion, but costly and substantial; and every thing around328 ATTEND CHURCH AT RICHETELOWKA. \ bespoke great affluence. Among the numerous servants, we recognised two by their liveries, as being those who were standing behind the car riage which had passed us. After having conversed with the General, we were about to take leave, when he acquainted us that his niece would be with us immediately. In a short time the young lady appeared, and, a little to our surprise, proved the same to whom we had been introduced at Prince Repnin’s. She explained to us that she had pass ed us on the road, and had moved to us, but that she saw we were close shut up in our vehicle on account of the very great dust. She then said that she was obliged to attend at the mass and ceremo nies, to be performed by the priests, and that it was the earnest wish of her uncle, as well as of herself, that we should take our breakfast with them at twelve, at which hour they would dine, for the sake of our company. In short, she prevailed on us to stay and dine with them at their own hour, two o’clock. Meantime we proposed, if she would excuse our dress, to accompany her to church, which we accordingly did. On attending the church, we were introduced into the same pew with the ladies, who, however, generally keep themselves separate. In the Russian form of worship all persons present remain standing; they chaunt responsively to the priest, making devout signs of the cross, and striking their breasts when the confession of sins is recited. The chaunting of the choir, the long robes and venerable beards of the priests, give the whole ceremony a very solemn and imposing effect. Here, however, as at Tsherkask, a degree of levity was observable among the higher orders, who were occasionally talking and smiling while the offices of devotion were performed; but the service on the whole was undoubtedly very grand and impressive. At the conclusion of the service we followed the procession, in which the young lady was the principal personage. The priests conducted it round the square of the market, and onward to the river’s edge, where a boat with an arbour in it was waiting. When the priest bearing the cross had entered it, the boat was pulled into the middle of the stream by ropes from the opposite bank: the priest then dipped the cross in the water; and then guns were fired, and other demonstra-RUSSIAN FESTIVAL. 329 tions of solemnity manifested. In order that we might have a better view of the whole ceremony we were invited into an upper room of a house built on this occasion purposely for the reception of the lady, from which we beheld a sight certainly of very gratifying interest. The countenances of all the people in the assemblage expressed the most heartfelt joy and contentment: they were drest in their holiday attire, the girls wearing wreaths of flowers on their heads, and ready to dance with the village youths. The children were anxiously wait ing for the scrambles which they were aware would soon take place, according to custom. All these individuals were slaves; yet there actually appeared among them a more unclouded expression of hap piness, and freedom from care, than is generally to be observed among the rustics and labouring tenantry of the most strenuous advo cate for the abolition of slavery. Their contentment seemed, indeed, to flow from the highest sources, from a religious feeling, gratitude to their Maker, and to their protector, General Papoff, cheered by a persuasion that their condition claimed, and actually possessed, the peculiar protection of the Almighty. The ladies and gentlemen resi dent in the village all attended, and were of course invited to the public dinner given on the occasion. The last ceremony, that of kissing the cross, commenced on the return of the priest from the river. All the village people flocked around to perform this homage on the sacred symbol, the priest sprinkling it with holy water during the whole time. The lady then requested us to attend her to the mansion, whither the cross would be brought, to receive the same homage from the General, his suite, and all the ladies of the family, as well as the domestics. We accord ingly accompanied her, and, after due homage had been paid to the cross, we sat down to chocolate and other refreshments; for in a Russian entertainment of this kind there are but short pauses between the removal of one variety of repast, and the introduction of another. We witnessed another amusing and gratifying scene, over which presided our fair and amiable hostess, who did all the honours of the house. She summoned us to assist her in throwing among the crowd330 RUSSIAN CONCERT. of villagers without, a variety of ribbons, ear-rings, necklaces, crosses, brooches, and other trinkets. Handfuls of these she threw from the different windows alternately, along the front of the house facing the river, in order that they might be equally distributed among the merry groups assembled on the lawn. Numbers of the young men and women were there dancing to the sound of their rural music. It was somewhat remarkable, that in these dances, which consisted en tirely of advances and retreats to and from one another, each active and vigorous swain had two damsels as partners; this perhaps is the ori ginal proportion of women to men, which provident Nature has esta blished for its own unequivocal ends, but now found only in countries not as yet drained of their male population by the ambitious views of interested individuals in power, with their attendant train of wide- extended miseries. Such consequences may, ere this, be felt by the lower classes of free-born Englishmen, who, unlike the happy slaves before us, may not unaptly be compared, in relative condition, to the extremities of a man in apoplexy, in whom the head has for years been acquiring a preponderance of the circulating fluid, at the expense of the subordinate parts of the system, which at length become too debilitated and infirm to assist in supporting the overwhelming weight. The scrambles that next took place under the different windows, in succession, afforded much amusement, and they ended in a shower of gingerbread nuts, rained upon them by the old General himself, out of a measure of about a quarter of a bushel. The games were over soon afterwards* and dinner was announced, when each guest handed a lady to table, the places of honour being assigned to us as strangers. During the repast, a kind of concert was performed, on about forty horns, pitched to the gamut like the pipes of an organ, every performer sounding only one note, of different duration, from a semibreve to a semiquaver, as the air might require. The execu tion was slow, but very good, producing an effect nearly resembling that of a large organ, accompanied by a full orchestra: some tones were like those of the human voice, others had the softness of theDINNER. 331 flute; ill short, the whole arrangement appeared to me quite novel, and desei ving of some consideration among our military bands. In the pauses of the instrumental music, there were songs executed by numerous voices, the words of which occasionally conveyed some playful allusions to the married state, there being among the guests at table an officer and a young lady who were betrothed. However pleased I might be with the music, both vocal and instrumental, the pleasure was alloyed by a grating reflection, that the performers, like the crowd of spectators, were all actually bondsmen, though their condition, under the humane General Papoff, was softened into that of family seivitude ; and, to judge from all appearances, was charac terised rather by voluntary attachment than by compulsion. Theie were about eighty guests at dinner, which was succeeded by a desseit of fiuit and sweetmeats, along with which were introduced four or five boys of the parish; one of them placed on its end the cue of a billiard-table, which the others, crowding around, grasped with their hands in rapid succession one over the other, and he whose hand, at the end of this ascent, was uppermost at the point of the cue, won a plate heaped with fruit and sweetmeats. Other boys, using an allowed freedom on this occasion, entered by the windows, claimed a little portion of sweetmeats, and then went away; and these claims were repeated until another plate-full was exhausted. These little festive ceremonies, we were informed, took place on all Sundays and holidays : there were, besides, numerous gifts to parties on their marriage, presents of condolence in case of accident, &amp;c. In short our worthy host seemed to do all in his power to make him self beloved as a landlord and master, and to render the people on his estate as happy as possible. The same amiable disposition was manifest in the behaviour of his niece, whose kind attention to us, as strangers, was most gratefully felt at the time; and I am persuaded that neither Captain Salter nor myself will ever forget it. It being mentioned as probable that M. PapofF’s son might travel from Persia to India, we left for him with his father several letters of introduction to all our most intimate friends at Bombay. u u 2882 m CHAPTER XVIII. BELOTSERKOWKA.

Our carriage being ready, we quitted these most amiable people at four in the evening, and proceeded twenty-five wersts (two hours and a half), by a road in itself good, though over uneven ground, to the post of Belotserkowka. The sun shining in our faces was very hot, even at six in the evening. Our next stage was to Beigadirowska, twenty wersts. At setting out we crossed several bridges and a large river, and ascended a hill beyond it, within the first two miles. The rest of the road was good, and continued so through the town of Corol, twenty-five wersts, which we passed in the night. One of our front wheels ran off the box of the axle on our approach to Loobna (thirty-three wersts), and we halted to have it repaired. On this emergency, and on many others, while the gentlemen were doing all in their power to assist us, the people of the lower class showed a disposition to impose upon us, running away with every thing they could lay their hands on, and asking the most extravagant prices for the smallest piece of work. For putting the box into the wheel again, making a new nut, and tightening three rings, a coachmaker demanded forty roubles; the post-boys meanwhile set off with their horses and left us, in orderIMPOSITIONS ON THE ROAD. 333 that they might do him a service by obliging us to accede to his terms. We rejected them, however, and got the requisite work done for thirteen roubles. These extortions were attempted houily, even though we had a servant who could bargain and expostulate with the parties ; had we not travelled with a servant veiy well versed in the Russian language, we should have been thus annoyed beyond all endurance. At most ol the post-houses one expedient or other was tried for the purpose of cheating us, either by mis-stating the number of wersts in a stage, the number of horses to be paid for, or the rate of payment; and most unfortunately for us, although the imposition was detected and resented, it always occasioned us such a serious delay, that as far as regarded ourselves we found it best not to offer any strenuous resistance to the petty impositions which were attempted to be practised. The road to Lassorka, twenty-seven wersts (two hours), was extremely good, and continued so twenty wersts farther to the town of Periatin. It was from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet broad, perfectly level, and planted with willow-trees on each side. We proceeded twenty-four wersts, and arrived at Smotriki on the 15th of August. At this, as well as at the last post, there were no horses to be had, and we consequently lost six hours of our time. The disgust occasioned by these delays was greatly aggra vated by the intemperance of the people at the post-houses. Indeed many of the lower class of post-boys were utterly drunk by six o’clock in the morning, and we had to wait sometimes for hours ere the accounts were settled and the padrojnas copied out. We journeyed hence thirty wersts (three hours and a quarter) by a rather sandy, but good road, to Jagotina, where again we were disappointed in our expectation of fresh horses. We sent a mes sage, with Prince Repnin’s letter, to the mayor, who in two hours procured us the cattle we required from the people of the village. In the course of this night there was a considerable fall of rain. There was a turn in the road from the post-house to334 KIEW. the south-west, round a lake or , swamp, near a very superb mansion and grounds belonging to some nobleman. The road passes over a causeway across the swamp, on which there are bridges and mills. It thence continued to be good, though rather heavy, until we approached Periaslaw, distant thirty-three wersts from the last post. This town appears to great advantage in the distance. It is situated on an eminence which favourably displays the cupolas and spires of its churches and public buildings. The approach to it is rendered inconvenient by many bridges, some of which being out of repair, are passed not without danger. In the town we observed a great number of Jews, who, I find, are numerous in every large place in this country. The whole district around and near the road was in a state of high cultivation; they were gathering the harvest, and the plums, pears, apples, and other orchard fruits, were ripe. To Erkawtsi, eighteen wersts (one hour twenty minutes), we had excellent horses, and the road was good. The post is situated on the right of a lake. We proceeded along a level and good road twenty-eight wersts, bordered with willow-trees, to Barsipol. It being now night, we waited to dress our dinner, and afterwards slept until twelve o’clock, when we left this extensive village. To Browari, twenty-five wersts (two hours fifteen minutes), the road was rather sandy and deep, particularly the latter part of it. We thence proceeded twenty wersts to Kiew, along a very sinuous road of deep sand, through woods intersected by swamps, among which it meanders to a plain watered by a river near the town, which even at the distance of eight or ten wersts has a fine appearance. Its monastery, churches, and other edifices, are conspicuous on a hill; their cupolas, covered with copper, some gilt, and many of them painted, add much to its dignity. Indeed, it possesses many superb edifices. We crossed the river Dnieper by a wooden bridge about thirty feet broad and five hundred yards in length, floating, and held in its position by piles driven into the side opposing the stream. It is of a construction similar toKIEVV. 335 that of othei floating bridges, consisting of platforms of forty or fifty feet, lemovable when a boat has to pass. The bridge sinks a* little on the passage of a carriage. After going over it we ascended a hill, on which stands the town, by a winding road, on surmounting which the stranger is gratified by the view of many elegant edifices. There are shops, magazines, and in fact, all that can attract the eye of a traveller. The hotel at which we alighted was kept by a Jew ; but every thing was clean, and of good qualitv. I tiansmitted Cxeneral Yermoloff s letter to the Governor, Na- zimoroff, whose clerks returned a receipt for it. I had also one letter, which I delivered with my own hands, to the Princess Ipsi- lanti, who invited us to dine with her on the following day. This town is inhabited by a great variety of people, Russians, Poles, Jews, and Greeks, all appearing in the streets in their peculiar costume. There were also some French and German shopkeepers, or, to use the more dignified term, proprietors of magazines ; also French and Polish milliners, &amp;c. &amp;c. In this place it may not be improper to recapitulate the various causes of the numerous delays that are daily incident on this route. The traveller necessarily consumes some time in attending to his personal wants, as cooking, washing, &amp;c. He has also to pay due respect to the hospitable invitations of the princes, nobles, governors and public functionaries, to whom he may have been introduced, and must therefore spare some hours for visits of ceremony. Then there are the usual accidents aud casualties on the road, the damage of the carriage or harness, and the repairs consequently necessary, besides the greasing of wheels, an operation by no means expe ditiously performed. The tardiness and blunders of drunken posti lions, the difficulties that occur in the changing of money, in settling accounts at the post-houses, the people at which are frequently in toxicated, so as to be unable to transact business in a business-like manner, particularly at night, to which may be added those that present themselves on getting the padrojnas copied, and a variety of other impediments, repeatedly interrupt the journey. To change336 VISIT TO THE CATACOMBS. horses occupies an interval of from thirty to ninety minutes, and after a pause of this kind at night, there is no hope of fetching up lost time by increased speed, as it is necessary to move slowly after sunset. Nor is it the mere affair of a moment to detect and resist the extortions and impositions attempted at the post- houses. There may also be a want of horses, not unfrequently occasioned by collusion of the post-officers with the tracteurs or inn keepers for the purpose of detaining the traveller, and of making a little profit by him. All these delays are certainly grievous, but they are in part compensated by the moderate charges for post-horses and by the rapid rate at which they usually move by day, and, if you please, by night, from post to post. On calculating the extent of our route, we found that Kiew is 1855 wersts, or 1236 miles from Mosdok, and that place 1820 miles from Aboosheer, making the whole distance 3056 miles. Sunday, August 17th. — At seven this morning we went to the cathedral for the purpose of descending into the catacombs in which are deposited numerous bodies, said to be those of saints. On com ing to the iron gate which secures the receptacle of these precious relics, we observed before it a chapel containing a great accumulation of riches, displayed as ornaments and decorations. Our servant was here desired to furnish himself with lights in order to conduct us through the subterranean labyrinth. While he was absent on this errand, we waited for the exit of a great number of visitants from this confined place in order that we might have the advantage of a freer air in viewing it; but as he did not return in time, the attendant priest very politely gave us each a small wax taper, and we proceeded in company with several gentlemen who had been waiting like our selves for admission, and one of whom spoke French, so that through him we might hope to have our curiosity better satisfied. We de scended by arched passages excavated from the sandstone rock, which led directly under the sanctum of the cathedral, towering above. In passing along, we perceived the coffins containing the bodies of the saints; they were deposited in niches cut out of the rock onVISIT TO THE CATACOMBS. 337 seats, and arched over. On the lid of each coffin was a painting re presenting the person of the saint, and his name and style were in scribed on a board, or painted on the wall of the niche. Some of the recesses were larger than others, and contained two, or even four bodies; there were occasionally two bodies in one wide coffin. Within each coffin at the foot, there was a box with an aperture in the hd, to receive the charitable donations of pious persons. The bodies appeared to be dressed, or rather swaddled with embroidered caps, and bags for the hands, with crosses on them : as we passed them, those persons in our party, who were of the religion of the country, kissed the hands and arms of each saint, and some of them left copper money on the body or in the box. In some parts of these caverns the air was very confined, but in ge neral there was a perceptible current of cold air, introduced through gratings communicating with other passages. The lights rather aided this ventilation; when I first saw them I feared that they would dete riorate vital air, and occasion disagreeable sensations; but we did not experience any, nor did we feel any difficulty of respiration. In the different parts of the catacombs there were altogether seventy-four coffins of saints, interred or deposited in various ways, and with various circumstances of distinction. There were some coffins of silver, highly wrought and embossed: others were in caves in the rock, the mouths of which had been closed after interment, and a little glazed window left, through which to view them. There was one, a St. John, buried up to his neck in the rock; and near him was deposited a Prince, who had sold all his lands and possessions to endow the church, to which he retired, and there ended his days. One of the saints was said to have been crucified by the Jews, and his body, on being found, had been brought here. We observed an ex cavation of greater than ordinary extent, having two alcove recesses, in which were deposited ten bodies: and nearly under the centre of the church there is a cave, on the floor of which twelve bodies are laid near each other ; these were the original founders of the church. The crowd of persons who visited the catacombs at the same time that we33 $ DEPARTURE FROM K1EW. did was very great, and it was with great difficulty that we moved along; we were at times obliged to stop until the press of people had gone forward or passed us. After about an hour spent in exploring these caves, we went to another catacomb, at a little distance, in which were deposited the bodies of forty-seven more saints. On returning thence, we went through the square adjoining, in which the guards were mounted, and passed in front of the arsenal, a very fine range of buildings. This arsenal, and the churches we had visited, are suri'ounded by fortifications of gazons, having a plain clear for three or four hundred yards before them. Kiew may be recognised as a town of considerable importance by the number of spacious mansions belonging to princes, nobles, and generals. There are shops of all kinds, and manufactories of various articles of utility Or luxury, among which the establishments of coachmakers form a large proportion. Of the taverns and public-houses, many are kept by Jews. It appears that here, as indeed all over Russia, spirituous liquors and tobacco are in very great demand, and the sale of them is enormous. As the Governor had taken no farther notice of General Yermo- loff’s introductory letter than by the receipt for it, we concluded that we were not to expect an opportunity of visiting him, or any other person of influence from whom interesting information might be obtained. The dread of being delayed induced us to send an excuse to the Princess Ipsilanti, and instead of going to dine, according to invitation, we departed from Kiew without much regret. Hurry, in fact, and that alone was the great bane of our enjoyments ; an anxiety to move onward ever engrossed our minds, and tended to prevent us from viewing with due interest or gratification the objects that presented themselves on our route. We were performing a journey and not a tour; yet on retrospection we could not but blame ourselves for not having at times travelled a little more leisurely. The reader will no doubt see reason to concur in this censuie ; but he must admit, that the present itinerary, however jejune, may be glttl as a pliers may l 361 mater profit and &lt; 5 ft post-house obliged to pay ei&lt; tier, over a hi! ot the town of Kii is, we found that lours, during whi in served with to the police-mast these officers uni igeus, This a he wrote on the si In the mean tii ®i agreed with i the next post, B Hutto our utter a ©iage had beer la $ter came for\ !m ns, and that l ®ed that prefer As the horses downer of the fust-horses as v : ® Sfs i Wt still IlltS «partoi **veij bad.

J J The post-house for horses being four worsts distant, we were obhged to pay eight roubles for four horses to draw our carriage ofte to f R 7 ^ 6aU the ^ throu g h ^e streets of the town of Kiew. At the post-house, as if ill-luck was to befal us, we found that all the horses a xy A / uie norses were out; and after waiting two , uring w ich we actually saw the servants of other gentle* men served with horses, I wrote in French a letter of complaint o the police-master, as I had ever found on former occasions that these officers uniformly manifested a willingness and readiness to ob ige us. This application for assistance had the desired effect, as he wrote on the subject to the post-master. In the mean time, after our letter had been sent off, we had found an agreed with a man of the town to supply us with six horses to die next post, Bellagarotki, twenty-five wersts, for twenty roubles. ut to our utter astonishment, on the servant’s return, and when the carriage had been got ready, with the horses put to it, the post master came forward, and declared that he had six horses ready for us, and that the persons who had been served before us ob tained that preference by being furnished with courier passports. As the horses already hired by us had been harnessed, we gave the owner of them four roubles for his trouble, and set out with post-horses as usual. At Bellagarotki they made us pay for six horses, but still at the reduced price of three copecks per horse. The fiist part of the road to this post was good, but the latter part was very bad. Another misfortune attended us at the next post; for the Vice-Governor had ordered sixteen horses to be reserved for him, and as even that number had not been completed we were detained nine hours and a half until horses had returned and were refreshed xor us. August 18 th. We drove at a rapid rate to Mottaigin, twenty-five wersts (one hour and a half), by a very good road, over uncultivated x x 2340 ROJEAH, THE FIRST POST IN POLAND. I plains. From hence to Rojeah, the first post in Poland, twenty wersts, the road was narrow, but good, being evidently a made one, on which considerable expense had been incurred. On the adjacent grounds there were woods, and intervening lawns and glades, with occasional clumps of trees, much resembling park scenery. Here we moved on at the rapid rate of one werst in two minutes and a half, as measured by our watches. We arrived at Raukovitch, sixteen wersts, in one hour ten minutes, by a very good road. In this country the price or purchase of horses for posting is from 100 to 200 roubles each; the finest large carriage-horses may be bought at from 500 to 1000 roubles. The women of Poland dress differently from those of Russia, having on their heads a quantity of white cloth, of a flowing gauzy texture, which hangs behind down to their waists. We hap pened to be passing through the country at a season of general festivity and drunkenness. The grounds were still well wooded. The road to Radomirz, eighteen wersts (one hour and a half), was through a fine forest of fir, oak, birch, &amp;c., but all on a deep sandy soil. We observed numbers of very fine firs fit for ship-building. Near the town we crossed many wooden bridges, one of which was at least eight hundred yards in length, over a broad river running to the right. There were several of two or three hundred yards in length. We proceeded to Beerazoka, eighteen wersts, through a sandy and woody tract in the first instance, but over a hard and good road toward the latter end of the stage. This continued, though rather narrower, to Studianitza, eighteen wersts, over a country somewhat less wooded. The road was very good to Zeltomirz, nineteen wersts and a half The post-station was two miles north of this town; and the inso lence of the post-master was such, that we were obliged to go thither to complain of him. Zeltomirz, being the capital of a district, is a large and crowded place, having a governor, to whom application must be made by travellers when their padrojnas require to be changed, as in case of altering their route. The inhabitants, the females in particular, are clean and well dressed ; indeed, it is evi-*VILSK. ' m evident that cleanliness is much more attended to here than in Russia. We had to travel by a sandy and deep road from this place to ilsk, sixteen wersts, and in consequence of the delay to which we were subjected, we did not arrive until after night-fall. The horses, on setting out, turned suddenly round and broke the pole; the post master, standing at the door, saw the accident, and told our people that we might put up the carriage for the night at a Jew’s tavern not far distant, as it was too late to procure a pole or look out for carpenters. We ordered him to take the carriage into the post-yard to prevent its being robbed, and expressed our intention to sleep in it. We asked him to allow us to place our kettle on the fire which we saw. He replied, that it was nearly out, and he was going to bed which he did. In the morning our servant went for a carpenter, and procured a pole which was fitted to the carriage by eight o’clock. We were then told that the Prince to whom the horses at this and at three successive posts onward belonged, was going on a journey himself, and had issued orders that his horses should be kept for him, and that others, obtained jfrom his slaves^ might be furnished to inferior travellers. Some very small poor jades were brought from the adjacent farm-house, and we set out after a loss of nine hours. These detentions are by no means un common. ' August 19th.—The road to Poolen, twenty wersts, was sandy and led through fine forests of oak and pine. On our arrival we found, as in the former instance, that the post-horses were reserved; others belonging to farmers were detained, and one man, also detained, ran away as we arrived. We now observed that the post-people were more cleanly and better dressed than those of the former stations ; but unfortunately they are allowed to retail spirituous liquors, a pri vilege attended with very pernicious consequences. We preceded to Socolov, fourteen wersts (one hour and a half), by a very uneven and hilly road through timber forests. We here paid for four posts at once, a very imprudent proceeding, for a traveller maybe342 NOVOGOROD POLINSK. sure n6t to be so well served at those posts which have been paid in advance. Here again the post-master told us that his horses were just come, in, and required to be fed; he of course recommended us to a tracteur, his friend, who lived over the way. He kept us waiting two hours until some fowls were roasted for us, received and paid for. These people play into each other’s hands by the most shameful artifices.; Our next stage was to Nesseloine, thirteen wersts, by a pretty good road still through forest-grounds. The post-boys, all along the road in this district, are continually drunk, even at five o’clock in the morning. They stopped to procure ardent spirits at all the half-way houses and halting-places. We observed numbers of Jews offering wares for sale in every direction, with their accustomed im portunity. . To Novogorod Polinsk, twenty-two wersts and a half, the road was good. Near this town we crossed the river Sloutch, eighty yards broad» by a boat, into which the carriages were driven. Here, for the first time for some hundreds of miles where no stones had been visible, we saw some large masses of granite. The town is situated on a hill resting on a stratum of this kind of rock. We proceeded hence to the small village of Giewdovitch, nineteen wersts, and on ward to Korets, twenty wersts, and to Hammapoil, twenty-five wersts. We went these two stages by night, over good and even roads, in five hours; but we were deceived with respect to the distance, for which we paid more than was justly due. We were by day-break at Hammapoil, where we got some small cups of coffee and four peaches for one silver dollar. The latter part of the road was rather deep and sandy. We had heavy rain all night, but we travelled on, and were not in the least degree wet, so well was our carriage secured by leathern aprons and glass blinds. August 20th. We journeyed seventeen wersts (one hour thirty- five minutes), to Kravinski Cortmar, by a plain road, but over deep sand, which continued so, through forests of fine timber, to Gstrog, thir teen wersts. On approaching the town, we went along a bor dered causeway* nearly two wersts in length, across a swamp inter-EXTORTION OF THE ROST-MASTER AT MLEENOFF. 343 sected by many small streams flowing to the right At Ostrog we found that French was generally spoken. The town has many ruins of old buildings, and the remains of circular towers and co vered gateways, not connected however by inclosure walls. The road hence to Goolcha, twenty worsts and a half, was deep and muddy, through a hilly country. We traversed a swamp by a long wooden bridge at the entrance into the town. To Warkowitch, twenty-two wersts and a half (two hours and a half), the road was heavy in consequence of rain, and led over uncultivated ground broken into little hillocks. The country now began to exhibit less foiest scenery than before. In this village we found a large bazar or market, roofed over. Here a report reached us that Mr. Strachey lay ill at Hoobno, the next town on our route. We arrived there (sixteen wersts) in one hour forty minutes, by a very good road. The town is of good size, and its inhabitants seem, like those of the whole district, to be well dressed, and in easy circumstances. The road to the village of Mleenoff, fourteen wersts, was in itself good, but over very uneven ground. We were here subjected to an imposition which deserves to be mentioned. It appears, that the post-master here, who is a Jew, not only lets out horses on hire, but is also a contractor for the supply of post-horses when required by Government, which may be said to be the case in those instances in which padrojnas are given. But as the rates at which he is paid for the latter are very low, it is to his interest to find out any deviation, how ever slight, that has been made from the route supposed to be laid down or otherwise in the padrojnas, as such a discovery enables him to make his own terms for the supply of horses onwards. Now, on our departure from Teflis, the town which General Kutusofl* supposed to be in our direct route through Poland was Lemberg, and, therefore, the number of wersts for which we there paid the government-duty of two copecks per werst, was calculated from Mosdok to the frontier of Poland in the direction of that town. But on our approach to this frontier, that is, on our arrival at Hoobno, we found that Lemberg was a little to the left of the direct route from this place to Warsaw the344 LOOTSK, capital, which route led through Lublin. Although our passports specified that we were proceeding through Warsaw to Hamburg, the padrojna mentioned Lemberg; and the Jew therefore contended that we had deviated from our route, and refused to furnish us with post- horses, unless we paid for them at his own price, which he fixed at eight roubles silver, and which we were forced to comply with. This demur did not take place until the morning, for on our first arrival the post-master said that there were no horses, and that several carriages were waiting. We therefore slept in our carriages, for Mr. Strachey, who was with us, could not, although provided with a courier pass port, procure horses himself until next morning. August 21st. We went to Yerslavitch, eighteen wersts, by a hilly and bad road. From thence to Lootsk, a small town, nineteen wersts, we proceeded over a succession of high grounds. We now determined, in order to prevent any further imposition, to get our padrojna altered, and for this purpose we applied to the police-master, who wrote on it what was necessary to ensure our safe passage through the Russian frontier : this precaution was very well-timed, as we after wards found. In the town of Lootsk, there is a kind of citadel of masonry. There are some fine churches, stored with relics of saints, &amp;c. After passing through the town by a wretched road, we proceeded over a swamp 600 yards broad, by a long bridge. On crossing it we came to a ruined monastery, where we looked back on the town, which from this position has a good appearance, and affords materials for an excellent view. We travelled hence with six horses, three and three, the driver riding on the near shaft-horse. The road from hence to Torechen, twenty-three wersts and a half, was very uneven, and much cut up in consequence of rain. It was not much frequented. We crossed several swamps and small streams. The cattle of this country are of smaller size than those of the pre ceding districts. We proceeded to Woemitch by a good road, over heights and among forest-grounds. At this place we saw a proces sion made in celebration of a Jewish wedding. The married couple went through the town in a cart to the house of the bride, attendedPOLISH LAW CONCERNING POST-HORSES. 345 by many people of their tribe, with fiddles, &amp;c. They returned the same way, all the women dancing without the men, two by two, in advance of the procession formed of the bride and bridegroom, with their relatives and friends. The road continued good for twenty-five wersts, to the old strag gling town of Vladzimirz, presenting many venerable ruins of gate ways. We observe that in Poland there is a much smaller circulation of copper as well as of silver. The post-houses are better built, and better served than in Russia. We proceeded to Oosulug, twelve wersts and a half, by a sandy but good road. As this is the last station in the. Russian territory, the traveller must here change any silver he may have for gold, reserv ing only a very small quantity for immediate use. Here also the baggage ought to be examined ; but as ours was in very small com pass the officers did not trouble us with that ceremony ; our passports, however, were taken to the highest in authority, and by him copied! At this place the Russian padrojnas cease to be of use, or at least their validity terminates at the next post. It is particularly requisite to be careful in preventing any more horses than are absolutely necessary, to be put to the carriage, before crossing the boundary, because there is a law prevailing in Poland which obliges the traveller to take at the post-houses in that country the same number of horses with which he travelled from the Russian territory. Close to the town of Oosulug is the river Bug, which here divides Russia from Poland. It is navigable for boats of forty tons to its junction with the Vistula, which is of course navigable to Dantzic. Boats from that port are two months in coming up thus far. We crossed this river by a ferry-boat, and paid six roubles for the transport of our carriages, by the same conveyance. On leaving the river we proceeded by a causeway over a swamp to a barrier, which was then shut. On its being opened to us, we were conducted to a house at which our passports were to be written, and our baggage examined, which was done, however, in a very cursory way. We were asked whether we had any quantity of tea or tobacco, and on answering that346 EXCHANGE OE COIN. we had not, we were suffered to proceed towards the town of Roobia- shoff, twenty-five wersts, as charged to us ; but the distance was evi dently much less, and perhaps did not exceed sixteen. The road was good throughout; and on our arrival at the post-house we began to ex perience the effects of the Polish system with regard to travelling. The master endeavoured to oblige us to take six horses all the way through Poland. To do this would greatly enhance our expenses; and we found that such was the slow rate of driving, that our progress would not be at all accelerated by taking such a number. We deter mined, therefore, to resist this imposition in the outset, and declared that we would take only four to each caleche. The post-master, in his turn, declared that he was by law entitled to make us pay for the same number of horses which we had used in travelling through Russia. We exhibited our padrojnas, which were made out for four each; but finding that this was ineffectual, I went to the town and complained of this imposition to the Commissary, or judicial super- intendant, who gave me a note for the post-master, enjoining him to give us only four horses. He told me, however, that the law was against me, and that if I came with six, it would be expected that I should go on with six; but I explained that I had arrived at the last Russian post with only four, and that the fact of my having entered Poland with six was owing to an imposition practised by the last post-masters, who were no doubt desirous to assist their colleagues. The Commissary moreover observed, that if the post-master found our carriage to be heavy, which I admitted it to be, he might insist on our taking five horses, but even in that case we ought only to pay for four. The affair being settled, I returned to the post-house, where out of spite we were detained two hours and a half, and at last set out on our first stage with only four horses to each carriage. We had ex changed our coin at Roobiashoff on the following terms: 30 grosschen of copper, 1 stolen or florin; 19 florins, 1 Dutch ducat; 6 florins 20 grosschen, 1 silver rouble of Russia, or 4 paper roubles. The rate at which we were required to pay for horses was two florins347, OBSERVATIONS ON THE POLES. per Polish mile for each horse, the mile being equal to seven or eight Russian wersts. Each postilion receives three florins per stage, if it be long, and two and a half if it be short; two florins are charged at the post-house for registering the application for horses, and one florin for wheel-greasing, the grease being supplied by the traveller. The river Bug at this place is sixty yards broad, and is navigable for large boats, numbers of which are built here. We were informed that the Grand Duke Constantine had caused some gun-boats to be built, which were sent to navigate the river as high up as possible. The gold and the paper currency of Russia are allowed to pass beyond the confines, but the silver is not; it must be exchanged for gold. Our passports had been entered at the Chancellerie, opposite the banier, and a note had been sent to the post-master, requiring him to supply us with four horses each; no further official preparative for our journey was required. We proceeded to Ookhanica, three Polish miles, in three hours. This was a slow rate of driving: the road, which was a made one, was good, but narrow and bordered with ditches. In travelling through Poland after leaving Russia, the most striking points of dif- feience appeared to be the following. There was greater cleanliness in the houses and in the persons of the people: the Polish women have finer features than those of Russia, and they are in general much better dressed. Tillage and farming are attended to in a superior manner; the farm-houses are neater and in better order; there are no slaves or serfs, paying a kind of poll-tax to the King. Beggars, how- evei, by profession, are very numerous, and forcibly obtrude them^ selves on the traveller at every station. There are numerous Jews, but not so many, I think, as in Russia. The country in general is well wooded, and forest-ground seems to predominate. We went to Kransniashin, two miles and a half, a small village with a well-built church. The road was good from thence to Krasnis- tofl^ another small village two miles and a half from the former. Wu crossed a bridge over the Wyesps, joining the Vistula, which y y 2348 PALACE AND GARDENS OF PRINCE CZARTORISKY. accompanies the road on the right at no great distance. To Piasky, four miles, the road was through sand and among forests of large trees. Such a country seems favourable for robbers, but though we travelled by night we sustained no attacks of any kind. We proceeded three miles and a half to Lublin, a town of some antiquity, as ap pears by its old churches, monasteries, and mansion-houses. The inhabitants in general were well dressed. We crossed the river by the bridge. Here the post-boys drive so slow that it was impossible to travel more than three or four stages in a day. The road to Mar- kooshoff, on the Vistula, (four miles) led through a great proportion of forest-ground, and occasionally through some fine fields of potatoes. We proceeded from thence, three miles, to the well-built town of Poolavia, in which are the palace and gardens of Prince Czartorisky, a nobleman distinguished for his liberal and hospitable behaviour to all who visit him. He possesses immense property in various parts of this country. His stud of brood mares, amounting to two thousand, furnish annually to Russia one thousand and seven hun dred young horses. He has an English gardener, and a groom or superintendant of the horses, harness, and stables. I was informed that here is a fine collection of antiques, with some statues and pic tures worth seeing, and that the gardens and palace are universally admired. In the town are some very good inns, and many well- built houses of stone and brick. Close along the gardens of the Prince flows the Vistula; and from the opposite bank of that river the palace and its subordinate buildings are seen to very great ad vantage, and compose a fine landscape, a rather uncommon sight in Russia. Our carriages were ferried over the river, which is here seven hundred yards broad, in a large boat, into which they were driven with the horses attached. The boat was eighty feet long, twenty wide, and two deep. We paid six florins for the transport of two carriages and eight horses. To Granitza, two miles, the road was through deep sand, and very heavy, particularly near the river. At Poolavia the post-master had of his own accord put five horses to our caleche, as being extremelyPAIKSETCHNA. 349 weighty. We proceeded to Coznitza, three miles, through a tract of deep sand full of holes and inequalities. Here we passed the night in a violent storm of thunder, lightning, and rain. August 24th. (Sunday.) — The road to Richoval, two miles, con tinued through deep sand, having the Vistula in the distance on the right all the way. We; passed many fine villages, and in fact throughout Poland the roads are enlivened by houses and cottages, villas and barns. The women are but coarsely clad, but their clean liness of dress is more and more evident as we proceed. The men are not so much addicted to drinking as the Russians,.and even the post-boys, although adults, are not so often intoxicated. We proceeded two miles and a half through a succession of forests, swamps, meadows, hills, and sandy soil, by a rather deep road to Meeshoff. The face of the country much resembles that of England, and perhaps for this reason we esteemed it very fine. The palings, the wattled hedge-rows, the cottages, farms, and out-houses, all reminded us of England. The left bank of the Vistula was thickly studded with villages. This sandy road continued three miles to Gora. We crossed the river Vilitza, sixty yards wide, by a boat. Gora is a fine new town on the Vistula. Our progress to Pairsetchna, two miles and a half, was very slow on account of the deep, bad, and sandy road. We twice met carriages driving in the opposite direction, and on both these occasions our horses were taken out and exchanged for those in the other carriages. This was done to save the horses.350 CHAPTER XIX. WARSAW. EXORBITANT CHARGES AT THE WILNA HOTEL. JOURNEY TO SLOOPSEE. ENTER THE PRUSSIAN TERRITORY. POSEN. — BYTSYN. DROSSEN. PRANKEURT ON THE ODER.

August 25th. — After travelling this last stage of three miles pur posely at a very slow rate, we arrived by day-break at the beautiful avenues of high trees near the barriers of Warsaw, called Varsova.- Here the guard stopped us, and after examining our papers, directed us to go to the general commanding officer, and sent a Cossack on horseback to show us the way. We drove through the fine avenue of trees, and entered Warsaw, a very large and well-paved town, thronged with carriages and military men, moving in all directions. We went to the house of the Commandant, but finding no one up at this early hour, we retired to the Wilna Hotel, where we had excellent accommodations. In the course of the day we repaired to the palace of the Grand Duke Constantine, with letters for His Highness, and for his chef-d’etat major, General Koorootoo. We found no one there, all were absent; at twelve, we went to the commanding officer and gave him General Yermoloff’s letters. We rode through the town in a carriage on a shopping excursion. In the evening we had the curiosity to go and see the palace, or chateau royal de Zameck, celebrated for “ le$ tableaux de Bactarelle de Cavalette.” There was a series of portraits of the Kings of Poland, terminating with that of Stanislaus; the saloon was dark, and covered withWARSAW. 351 marbles of different colours : what I found most complete, were the columns and walls of the concert or music-room; these were only imitations of marble, but they were very superb ones, and appeared finer than the marbles from which they were copied. The ceiling of the concert-room, which was spacious, was finely painted by Bac- tarelle, who I understand is still living in the neighbourhood. We also saw the statue of Sigismunda on a pillar near the palace. She is represented as bearing a cross in her right hand and a sword in her left. Theie is the picture of a queen, next to that of Stanislaus, which is xemaikable, as it represents the only female sovereign which Po land ever had. Her name was Yadwiga or Heetewige. The back part of the palace commands some beautiful views of the Vistula in the distance. Some improvements are now taking place, by which a number of small houses will be removed, and the garden will be extended to the river’s edge. The accommodation at the Wilna Hotel, as already observed, was very good ; the remise, or glass-coach furnished to us, as well as the horses, appealed clean and respectable, and the valet-de-place was well dressed and extremely active. The coffee was strong and deli cious, and the bread was excellent. Among the various objects pointed out to engage our attention, they showed us the bed in which Buonaparte slept when here; in the same bed slept Alexander, Emperor of Russia, on his last visit to Warsaw. The buildings of this city are entirely after the French model, and the ornaments, the gilded carvings and figures, are all in the same light, frivolous, and harlequinade style. Although we rode a good deal about the town, we had not time to inspect in detail any of the public buildings, except the palace. We saw a number of hack carriages, mostly caleches, or barouchettes. Warsaw is famed for its manufacture of light travelling carriages, and I think justly so; for in these carriages the accommodations for sleeping are contrived in a superior manner. With respect to wheels, however, those of Russia appear to be preferable, the fellies of them being formed of one piece instead of five or six, incurvated352 EXORBITANT CHARGES AT THE WILNA HOTEL. by art; these Russian wheels are, in my opinion, of the best possible construction, and deserve to be imitated in England. From what I have seen, the carriage iron-work of Moscow is undoubtedly the best. Carriages are cheap here, the prices varying from 1200 to 2000 roubles; from 120 to 180 or 200 Venetian ducats. In this place it may be allowable to remark, that as very vexatious delays are frequently occasioned by want of change, the traveller should take care to be always provided with a certain quantity both of silver and copper coin for every contingency. Also, in taking an extraordinary number of horses at any particular post, it is ne cessary to be very careful and explicit, in order to avoid any demur at the next post, where attempts are likely to be made by detentions or otherwise, to oblige the traveller to continue with the same number onwards. One of the finest spectacles here, is seen on the parade every morning on the mounting of the guard, at which the numerous cavalry and bands of music produce a striking effect. August 26th. — Still urged on by anxiety to accomplish our journey, we left Warsaw at six in the evening. When we came to settle accounts at the hotel, every species of petty exaction was practised upon us. For our washing we were charged two florins and a half; for cleaning the carriage, eight florins ; for hang ing it high on the springs, one. The bill of subsistence, &amp;c. for three persons, from day-break on one day, until three in the after noon of the next, amounted to one hundred and fifty-eight florins ; this, with a residue for the servants, made up ten ducats. Mr. Strachey changed his old and broken caleche for another second-hand one, which, however, looked almost as good as new, giving seventy ducats to boot. We found, in short, every possible facility for laying out money, and procuring whatever we required. As the charges of posting now became so much higher, and as the rate of driving rarely exceeded a foot-pace, Mr. Strachey took only three horses. Notwithstanding this and other precautions, the travelling expenses in this country greatly exceeded those in Russia, as will be seen in the statement inserted in the Appendix.BLOWN IE. 353 On our coming to the gate to pass out of the town, our pass ports were demanded by the sentry and taken to be copied. This detained us twenty minutes, as we had two which required copying. On proceeding we found that, the roads near the town had been repaiied, and were somewhat better than usual, though on the whole exceedingly heavy. There were many villages scattered on the level territory around. In this quarter there is an evident Scarcity of trees. Our first stage was to Ojaroff, two Polish miles (one hour forty-five minutes). The annoyances, impositions, and detentions at inns on the road, in this country, diminish greatly the pleasure to be derived from travelling. The road to the second stage, Blownie, two miles, began to go over rising grounds, but it was for the most part plain and sandy, which occasioned us to travel slowly. Blownie is a small town, and is paved. The expenses for horses may be stated thus: eight bongros per horse, equal to two florins, the sum charged on our preceding route in Poland; to the postilion per mile of seven wersts, three quarters of a florin, or three bongros; but with this they are not satisfied, and persons in easy circumstances generally pay them at the rate of one florin per mile. For greasing, and expedition, or registering, the charge is one florin for each carriage. Thus far, however, we have one horse more than we pay for, yoked to the carriage; this indulgence, I believe, is at the option of the post-master. They allow it when they think it necessary, in order to prevent the rest of the horses from being too much exhausted. To Sochaiyew, three miles and three quarters, and thence to Zowry, the same distance, the road was over a flat country, but very sandy and heavy. There were swamps to the right and left of it. Close to the latter town we crossed a long causeway of wood and earth, which we again traversed on proceeding toward Kniew, the next station, three miles and three quarters. The first part of the road thither was over a sandy plain divested of trees, but rather swampy; the latter part led near some fine forests, interspersed with villages in all directions. Kniew is a small straggling village,354 KTODAWA. situated in a flat country covered with fields of grain, and having in the distance deep forests, the tops of whose trees resembled those of India. We moved slowly by moonlight toward Kutno, two miles and a quarter along deep sandy roads, in which here and there a few projections of granite rocks were visible. From the pretty small town of Kutno we proceeded two miles and a quarter to Glaznow, over a continuation of rather deep sandy road, through a well-culti vated country interspersed with villages. Among these, and in other parts of the road, there are numerous public-houses, for the sale of wines and tobacco, but drunkenness is less frequent here than among the Russians. To Ktodawa, two miles and a quarter, the road was rather harder and better, but still sandy. This is a small town in a well-cultivated district. The same kind of road continued to Koto, a pretty little town in the midst of swamps, which extend for miles beyond it. We proceeded hence by night for Kominie, distant four miles and a half, which we reached in six hours, driving very slowly. In the latter part of the stage we observed some beautiful park scenery. Kominie is a pretty town; its houses are of brick, in a better style than ordinary, and they stand closer together, so as to form more regular streets than those of the towns we had lately passed. It stands on an eminence surrounded by low marshy flats, intersected by small streams and pools, over which there are many bridges. We thence proceeded to Grobla Kosaaka, distant altoge ther two hundred and twenty-two wersts from Warsaw. On coming to the boundary we were stopped by a small guard of Cossacks, whose commanding-officer, in the course of fifteen minutes, copied our passports. This place is on the extreme verge of Poland. On journeying to Sloopsee, about four miles and a half, our road led at first through park and forest scenery alternating with plains. There were scarcely any villages to be seen, and their rarity is doubtless occasioned by the proximity of the boundary, which is defined at Grobla by a rivulet running to the right. It is crossed by a bridge connecting with a causeway or embankment a mile in extent.POSEN. 355 We were now in the Prussian territory, and our next stage was Wreznia, distant three miles and a quarter from the last. The road was in many places rather deep, and extended over a flat country, in many parts uncultivated and swampy. The houses and families of Jews were still numerous, though fewer than heretofore. Wreznia is a small paved town. The post-houses here are in better order and are kept by more respectable people, chiefly Germans. Many of them are taverns, their keepers speak French, and are very atten tive and civil. Here only eighteen florins are given in exchange for the ducat. The Prussian coins are thus subdivided: one ducat three reichs-thalers, and at times three and one third; one reichs- thaler, six florins ; one florin, four bongros of seven and a half grosschen each. All ducats are taken alike. The carriage-harness here is extremely bad, consisting only of cords, with a noose to each, without either collars or bits. To Kostrazyn, three miles and a half, the road was over deep sand, and in the latter part hilly. This post station is in a small town, having many villages near it in every direction. The Prussians are a more cleanly and handsome people than the Poles. They are generally of light complexions ; the contour of the face is oval. The females are very fair ; they wear bonnets of straw and of painted silk. The harvest here was rather earlier; there were great quantities of potatoes and tobacco growing in the fields. The road to Posen, two miles and three quarters, was over rising grounds, uneven, deep, and sandy all the way. There were some extensive woods in the distance ; and the fields here, as in the pre ceding stage, appeared to be all open and unenclosed by hedges. Posen is a fine, large, and well-built town, having better houses and streets than any which we had yet seen in Prussia; the street in which the post-house is situated has a walk down the middle of it lined by shady trees. From all that I saw of this city, as it may be called, it seems to be a desirable place of residence. It has bar rier gates on the side towards Poland. We proceeded to Bytsyn, four miles and a quarter (five hours and a z z 2MESENITZ. 356 quarter), by a very deep road over hills and occasionally through flat plains, skirted by woods in the distance and partly uncultivated. At Posen we had obtained inferior horses, a disadvantage incident to most post-houses established in towns. The road onward to Poriew, two miles and a half, was sandy and uneven all the way, with woods in the distance; the fields were still open, without hedges or any prominent enclosure. In general there is a scarcity of trees except near the vil lages or in forests. A few willows, however, are seen on the borders of marshes near the road. From the small village of Poriew we pro ceeded to Silno, four miles (three hours fifty-five minutes). The road for the first half of a German mile is through deep sand over hills and among woods, the latter part was through a tract assimilating with park scenery, the cultivated grounds being interspersed with clumps of trees. 1 his being the season of harvest the country has a very gay and animated appearance. The road continued extremely deep for twenty-three miles to Mesenitz, a large handsome town, having bar rier gates. Our next stage was to Zidenzig, four miles and a half (six hours). At ten (English) miles we crossed the boundary of Old Prussia and ^entered the district of Brandenburg. The road was through deep sand; here and there it was paved for a few hundred yards, but these parts being uneven were more disagreeable to travel over than even the sand. The country throughout was hilly, and much covered with wood. Zidenzig is situated in a well-watered valley. This and other Prussian towns on our route seemed to have the advantage of an excellent police; whenever we passed through any of them by night all was quiet, and no sound was heard except that of the watchman s horn, and his half-singing exclamation, warn ing the people to beware of fires. The almost universal head-dress of the women here is a black silk handkerchief tied with a very large bow in front. Silks of other colours are also worn, but they are less common. The dresses of the females in general are very neat and clean. The post-houses are all very good, and are provided with commodious apartments. To Drossen, two miles and a half, we had a deep sandy road overFRANKFURT. 357 hills and through woods. This town reminded us of those of the same class in England, the shops of butchers’ meat, cheese, butter, &amp;c. being much of the same character. The women too, attending market, carried small square baskets, in the manner of our English country folk. Drossen is a fine old town, having many new buildings, which indicate its improving state. We saw fewer Jews here than in other places. The next stage of three miles and a half, through deep sand and foiests intersected by wet and uncultivated plains, brought us to Frankfurt on the Oder, a very large and populous city. At the last post a toll was taken for the bridge, of three florins and a half for two carriages, or rather for seven horses. We left Frankfurt for Minchenburg, five miles, four hours and a half. The road on leaving the fine town of Frankfurt is paved, and bordered with trees. For about ten miles, or half way to Minchen burg, it is on the ascent, and afterward begins gradually to ascend. The post-charges had been augmented at the last station for this stage, as follows: in florins, for seven horses, ten; duty for paving road eight and three quarters; town pavement one and a quarter; expedition, or registei ing two ; altogether about eighty-two florins, or four ducats ten florins. To the postilions were given five florins and a half. The road throughout was very good, but became much narrower after the first few miles from Frankfurt. From Minchenburg we proceeded three miles and three quarters to Vogelsdorf, along a road like the former, paved and lined with trees. This continued throughout the next stage of three miles to Berlin. This is an exceedingly fine town, superior to any I have seen of the same extent. The houses are substantially built, well fronted and roofed with tiles. The principal street, fronting the park gate, has three walks down the middle of it, shaded with trees, and into these walks no carriages are admitted. On a platform over the gateway are the four celebrated bronze horses so frequently described and extolled for the masterly execution of them. They are attached to a car, in which is the figure of an angel in the act of driving them. This figure holds a banner with a cross, above which is represented a bird holdingBERLIN. 358 an olive branch. The day of our arrival here being Sunday, we were much gratified by the sight of the inhabitants, male and female, in their best attire, walking and riding through the streets and in the park, a fine and agreeably retired place, shaded with trees regularly planted so as to form avenues for foot passengers, and larger ones for carriaoes. The houses on the sides have benches in front, where groups of persons are seen seated, eating and drinking, or at all events smoking, which seems the universal custom. The contented and happy expression observable on every countenance afforded me as pleasing a spectacle as I have enjoyed for years. What we saw of Berlin led us to form a very favourable opinion of it, and to regard it as a residence in which a few days of the summer season might be most agreeably passed. There was a very splendid display of beauty among the fair sex, enhanced by all the advantages of elegant dress, with which the gay costume of the other sex did not fail to harmo nize. We saw many very fine horses, and some handsome carriages. The style that prevails here, whether for houses, ornaments, or the dresses of ladies, is entirely French. One custom however seems of native origin, which, as already observed, is almost universal—the practice of smoking tobacco, from the German pipe, the peculiar form of which is well known. The postilions have constantly the lighted pipe in their mouths while driving; the young gentlemen when attending their belles on the promenade habitually smoke while they walk and converse. The ladies have in general very fair complexions with light and even flaxen hair; there are very few brunettes among them. The children and young girls are all extremely pretty, their faces oval, and the features delicately regular. Berlin is excelled by London only in the convenience of side pavements; the houses are altogether as good, if not rather better than those of any portion of London of the same extent. This city, like Warsaw, is famed for its manufacture of travelling- carriages, which are equal if not superior to those of that capital. The vehicles called brishks are particularly convenient; they have three or four swinging-seats, and afford a great deal of accommo-BERLIN. 359 dation. Many of them are very light; and on the whole they are preferable to any other kind of carriage for travelling on the Con tinent. The town is situated near the river Spree, on which boats of con siderable burthen are used. There is also a navigable communication by means of canals to Potsdam, and, in connection with the Elbe, to Hamburg. It should seem that the drainage of the streets is not perfectly practicable, as the sewers occasionally exhale a most offen sive odour. There are regular passage-boats to the cities above mentioned, affording every convenience to passengers who meet with the greatest attention on board of them. They navigate from Berlin to Hamburg in three days; the charge for each person, in cluding that for an ordinary or table d'hote is five ducats; if the person provides his own subsistence, it is only two ducats. As the roads are extremely deep and heavy, the water conveyance appears to be preferable. Ihe branches of the Elbe, if properly improved by auxiliary canals, might afford great facilities for the transport of grain and for the supply of all necessary merchandize to the interior. With respect to the journey from hence to Hamburg, perhaps a single traveller could not do better than perform it on horseback, with post-horses, dispatching his luggage by the boat, which would arrive much about the same time with himself. To travel in a carriage, particularly a heavy one, is not only extremely tedious, but very expensive. The charges attending one carriage for this distance are about thirty ducats, as will be found detailed in the account of expenses inserted in the appendix. At Berlin, and indeed at every other large town, the traveller would do well to procure for his own guidance the most esteemed topographical account of the place. The “ Guide to Berlin and Potsdam” (printed 1813) is to be had at the publishers, Rue des Freres, No. 13. It being Sunday, the shops were closed, and we could not make this and other purchases which we had in view. In the evening, being urged, as usual, by increasing eagerness to pro ceed, we resumed our journey.360 GERMAN POSTING. The expenses of a day at Berlin stand thus: a room eight florins; breakfast three; dinner at the table d'hote four; if the traveller dines in his own apartments he is better served, but the charge is eight florins; tea, three; and in these charges no liquor of any kind is included. The hire of a carriage is four dollars ; of a valet de place, one dollar. ; ) We travelled onward in two caleches, as before, and our servants, with extra post-horses. On setting out for Henningsdorf, two miles and a half, we had to pay for one mile more than the real dis tance. This is called the mile royal. The road was through very deep sand. We crossed one bridge for which we paid two florins, and another at which the toll was seven florins for each carriage. The same kind of road continued to Cremen, two miles and a half, through wood the whole way, and occasionally over hilly ground. To Fehrbellin, two miles and three quarters, it was still sandy, but rather better; here we observed that the people dug turf for fuel from the swampy flats, as is practised in Ireland. To Kieritz, four miles and a half, the sandy road continued to improve. It would be a burlesque to apply the epithet of posting to the rate at which we travelled, as a man might walk much faster; we went only about two or at most three and a half English miles an hour. The printed regulations, I believe, do not require greater speed, and they allow one hour for changing a single carriage ; one and a half for two carriages travelling together, and half an hour for an express courier. From the time when we first began to travel with German post-boys, we observed that their habit of driving was tedious to a great degree. They would restrain their horses when they showed an inclination to go fast; they would stop at every ten or twelve miles to feed them and give them drink, and would halt frequently to adjust the boughs of shrubs tied on their heads to keep off the flies. The German post-boy, with his pipe in his mouth, is not to be put out of his way in the least; he must be allowed to stop every two miles to get a dram (or what he calls schnaps) for himself, and water for his horses, although they have not been out of a, walk the whole way. TheBOITZENBURG. 361 roads have generally meadows on each side of them, and are lined with trees. We were now entering a country in which enclosures of . fields by hedges were much more frequent. To Cleitzky, three miles and a half, we travelled through a sandy and hilly tract, covered with forests of oak and fir. The way was tedious, and the heat of the sun excessive. The same wooded and hilly country ex tended to the small town of Perleberg. On departing from thence for Linsen, three miles and three quarters, we entered on a narrower road, bordered by trees, but sandy throughout. On arriving at the gate of the town our boxes were to have been taken out for the purpose of being examined; but we gave a dollar and obtained a piece of paper, which on our presenting another dollar, was counter signed by the custom-house officer, who also looked at our trunks and was satisfied on seeing that we were travellers and very lightly equipped. The town is on the confines of the state of Mecklenburg. We crossed a bridge and paid a toll of half a florin. Proceeding thence through a flat, swampy, sandy country, by a road hardly passable, we reached Looptain, five miles and three quarters. We crossed another bridge during the night, where we paid a toll of nineteen schillings, and received a ticket. To Boitzenburg, four miles and a half, we had a winding road, through deep sand, altogether worse than any other stage that we had encountered during our journey. The post-master voluntarily furnished us with five horses to assist us through this heavy and fatiguing line of road. After passing the bridge and toll-house of the old paved town of Boit zenburg, we entered the Danish territory, and proceeded by a rather harder road, paved here and there, to Lauenburg, one mile and a half. The road from thence to Essenberg, three miles, was still better, partly paved, and leading over high grounds which com manded fine views of the Elbe. On the left, in a valley near the road, there were vestiges of the French lines and batteries. September 3.—We thence departed for Hamburg, distant three miles. The road has a gradual ascent all the way along the foot of some hills close on the right, and is better than that which we had passed, 3 A362 ARRIVAL AT HAMBURG. being generally paved in any difficult part either ascending or de scending. The approach to Hamburg is very pleasing; the country in the valley on the left is highly cultivated, being laid out in meadows and gardens, embellished with gentlemen’s seats, and villas, throughout all which the utmost neatness and cleanliness prevail. They are all built in the Hutch style. The heights on the right are not so much resorted to as the plains, which are intersected by various canals communicating with the Elbe, and thence command an un bounded supply of water. On arriving at a barrier, at which were posted a guard of soldiers, a well-dressed non-commissioned officer took cognizance of our names, rank, &amp;c. as also of the place from whence we came and the house at which we were to live, but no search took place, nor was any further trouble given us. We arrived safe at the Hotel de Russie, situated fronting the river near the principal walk and resort of genteel company. This town or rather free city is large and populous. Its houses are of many stories, and in general much higher than- those of London. The streets, as in all old towns, are ill paved, and are crossed in every direction by canals from the river, over which wooden bridges are thrown, and large mills are established even in the heart of the city. Many of the houses, and indeed those of whole streets, receive goods from boats in these canals by means of cranes projecting from the houses. The city, in short, presents many of the conveniences for which London is distinguished, and almost all that man can want or desire may here be had for money. The lower classes of people, however, differ much from those of England in habits and costume, particularly the women of vierland, (four lands,) whose dress is altogether singular. They wear on their heads a large round kind of hat, somewhat resembling, by its very great size, that of the Chinese. This remarkable costume, and indeed all that are peculiar to Hamburg, have been ably delineated by Professor Zuhr, in his engravings from original paintings representing the different dresses and cries of the city.PASSAGE TO CUXHAVEN. , ggg Many public coaches or post-waggons travel to and from Hamburg m every direction, the average terms of which may be taken at six bongros per mile of five English miles, with allowance for 50 lbs. of luggage. The charge for a passenger without luggage is only four bongros. A passage to Cuxhaven by packet-boat costs nine marks four schillings. These boats sail with the ebb-tide twice a week to meet the English government packet-boats for mails, whose station is Cuxhaven, and which sail from thence for England on Thursdays and Saturdays to Harwich. The subdivision of money is as follows: one ducat of Holland from 7.12 to 7.18 marks; one mark is 16 schillings, and one schilling is worth about one English penny. The price of ducats fluctuates much; it is at present about ten shillings and four-pence English. On the 5th, in the evening, having previously settled for our accom modation to Cuxhaven, we seated ourselves in a droshky or long open carriage, and drove down with our baggage to the quay. Here we procured persons to put our trunks into a small row-boat, which was to take us to the passage-boat, regularly stationed a quarter of a mile off, in the river, on the outside of the boom thrown across the basin for defence. After passing through many stockades, and round some wooden piers, we reached our vessel, which was not unlike a Margate hoy, and about the same size. By using our sails with an easterly wind, we glided swiftly down the river, among ships of all colours and nations, enjoying the reflection that our troubles of travelling were at end, and anticipating the pleasure of soon beholding our native country. The stillness of the summer evening, and the novelty and animated variety of the scene, made this water excursion peculiarly pleasant. The view of Blanknaes and other villages, as well as of numerous boats loaded with vegetables, some of which were rowed by market- women grotesquely dressed, formed an ever-changing picture. The accommodations which we found on board could not but be gra tifying to travellers inured to inconveniences of all sorts: the boat 3 a 2364 DEPARTURE FOR HARWICH. was neat and clean : on the sides of the cabin were eight fixed bed- places, which, to prevent disputes, were numbered ; each person when he took his passage at Hamburg received a card, on which was written the number of the birth he was to occupy. On our going into the cabin, the master very kindly spread a table for us, and furnished us with milk, bread and butter, and with hot water for tea. These provisions, as well as coffee, liquors, and tobacco, were to be had on board at moderate prices. Toward nightfall, it gave me pleasure to observe the master and seamen sit down toge ther on deck to a meal consisting of coffee, brown bread, cheese, and butter, of which they ate' heartily, but none of them drank spirits although they smoked tobacco. This abstinence from so dangerous a stimulant, in men whose way of life might be expected to pre dispose them to it, could not fail to raise them in our estimation, and increase our confidence in them. After dark we lay down to sleep in the clean bed-places, and in the morning were awakened by the voices of the people on deck, talking of the appearance of the pier of Cuxhaven, close to which place we now found ourselves. We soon afterward landed, and took up our abode in a tavern until the Harwich packet should be ready to sail. In order to save trouble, we sent our trunks at once on board this vessel, from the boat, having first settled for our passage to Harwich at five guineas each. We were not long detained at Cuxhaven, for by seven the next morning we were sent for by the Captain of the packet, that we might be on board nearly at the time of high water, or before the turn of the tide. In the cabin of the packet we found every convenience, and very superior accommodation ; it was carpeted, and fitted up with eight mahogany bed-places ; the beds, curtains, and all the furniture were extremely clean, and the servants attentive. We sailed with a light south-easterly wind, and proceeded about twenty miles down the Elbe, which is however so broad that we should not have known we were still in the river, had it not been told us. We were soon afterward out at sea, and, the wind becomingARRIVAL IN LONDON. 365 fairer, we made the land of old England about four in the evening of the 9th, and got into Harwich late at night. As Mr. Strachey had letters of consequence for government, he landed and proceeded forthwith to London. I waited to get my boxes passed through the custom-house, and this business, as well as the examination of our passports, was necessarily deferred, because the offices were shut up, and we were in consequence delayed until a late hour, nine o clock next morning. On coming on shore, we found it customary to distribute presents to the master, the steward, the mate, seamen, and servant-boys of the packet; these gratuities amounted to one guinea from each person. My fellow-passengers, who were as anxious as myself to get to London, joined me to the number of six in taking our places toge ther, so as to occupy an extra stage-coach, in which we set out about eleven o clock in the forenoon, and arrived in London late at night. The journey being now terminated, it only remains for me to add some general remarks on the route, to point out its advantages, and show how it may be varied without any great increase of difficulties. In the first place, then, with respect to the choice of this route from Europe, it must be observed, that by going through Russia, over the Caucasus into Georgia, and through Persia, the traveller passes, generally speaking, through civilized countries, where no de serts intervene, and the plague is not to be apprehended. A great proportion of the route lies in Russia, a country in which travelling is secure, expeditious, and cheap. Wherefore it would be advisable to proceed by sea to Riga, or St. Petersburg, where good vehicles of different kinds are to be purchased on moderate terms, and thence proceed either in a carriage on springs, or in the light kibitkas found at each post. The journey from Petersburg, through Moscow, to Teflis, may be performed in three weeks, if the traveller set out from Petersburg at any time in the month of June; and at Teflis the carriage may be disposed of at little less than the original cost. The only disadvantage of importance on this line of route is, that, with the exception of the two Russian capitals, it presents few366 GENERAL REMARKS. objects worthy of notice until it reaches the Caucasus. The route through Europe, however, might be varied at pleasure, with the sole precaution of entering Persia through Georgia, for the sake of safety. Travelling through Turkey is at present disagreeable and precarious, at best, and it may be attended with danger if any of the Pachaliks be at war with each other, or in rebellion against the Porte; and these disturbances are frequently occurring. A journey of considerable interest might be taken through the Netherlands, up the Rhine, and thence to Vienna, and by Herman- stadt to Odessa, proceeding from that port through the Crimea, and along the northern side of the Caucasus. But in taking this route the traveller ought to set out in April. Indeed, whatever direction may be preferred, I would strongly advise all persons desirous of perform ing the journey by land to the Persian Gulf, to allow themselves at least a month, or even two, more time than we took for the journey here narrated. Many of the little fatigues and disappointments which we experienced would thus be avoided. Let it be understood, also, that two gentlemen proceeding together may, after crossing the channel, get into their travelling carriage, and pursue their journey in it to the confines of Persia. Of all kinds of vehicles for this pur pose the barouchette is the best, and it ought to be so contrived as to form a bed for two persons. There should be a light box on the front seat, containing all the different articles necessary for a meal. This box might be fitted to rest on the front seat, while journeying ; and at night either be placed between the seats or so elevated as to allow the feet to pass under it, and thus render the whole length of the carriage available for sleeping in. This mode of conveyance would serve until the travellers entered Persia, through which country they would have to proceed on horse back, and they might do this by short stages in the morning and evening, amounting together to from twenty to forty miles a-day. On completing their land journey they would find little delay or difficulty in proceeding to India, as there are ships to be found at Bushire, about every fortnight, going to all the three British esta-GENERAL REMARKS. ^ bhshments, Bengal, Madras, and Bombay. The entire passage might be effected with very little risk, excess of fatigue, loss of time, or increase of expense, particularly when compared with the extravagant demands for any thing like comfortable accommodation to or from India on board a regular East Indiaman. Let no one, however, un dertake the overland trip, without expecting to suffer a little from privation in the article of food; and also from want of rest, when celerity is attempted. From those with whom eating and drinking is a primary consideration, the stores of an Indiaman claim a decided preference. With respect to the fatigue to be apprehended, my opinion is, that by beginning with short stages, and gradually increas ing them from day to day, a weak person would rather improve than impair his bodily strength. There is little embarrassment to be ap prehended on the score of language in the various countries on the route. French is universally spoken in Europe; and at Teflis there are servants to be obtained who speak Turkish and Persian, and in some instances English and French. Nor is there any necessity for changing the dress for that of any other nation, as the costume of England is every where respected.Tk Am Countries th Shillings and Passage per or liquors, Wages of on Persian G Landing at' Hire of 3 m each Bought fort Guides on ti Senses of 14th of A, Brents to si Porchaseof piosj chaii Black sheep, Hay IsU] 0116 rupee *&gt;?21sU 'ewiiu 6.^ .jKun dances t c Vtof e Sl2G373 APPENDIX. —No. II.

To the foregoing sum ought to be added the expenses of the first outfit in India for the voyage to the Persian Gulf; such as travelling trunks, table and canteen, liquor for the sea voyage, saddle and pistols, &amp;c. which may be estimated at from thirty to fifty pounds. A deduction however may be made for the amount of sale of horse and carriage, which cost us, as is seen in this account, nearly one hundred ducats. It ought to be recollected that the time occupied in the journey was nearly seven months, and that the sum expended, being about £220, is after the rate of about £378 per annum. In that sum of £220 are comprehended all incidental charges of travelling a distance of nearly 3800 miles by land, and that too with post-horses through Europe, exclusive of the sea voyage of nearly two months from Bombay to Bushire ! The Author, anxious for the welfare of his brother officers, very strongly recommends to them this mode of travelling, with some variations in the route through Europe, on the return to India, as highly interesting and entertaining; and, when a little more time is allowed, not very fatiguing.
