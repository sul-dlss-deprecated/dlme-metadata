Enclosure in Colonial Office covering letter No.17903/33 dated 4th May, 1933. 17903/33. 29th April, 1933. Sir, I am directed to transmit to you, to be laid Fr Res 27 3 33 — — before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, a copy of a despatch from the Resident at Aden regarding his recent visit to Socotra and certain outlying parts of the Aden Protectorate. A copy of the despatch of the 27tn of March, referred to in paragraph 1 of this despatch, is being sent to the Admiralty under cover of Colonial Office letter (No.17955/33) of the 29th April. 2. It will be observed from paragraph 3 of the accompanying despatch that the Resident recommends that the limit of the Red Sea Patrol should be extended to include the whole of the Gulf of Aden up to the eastern boundary of the Aden Protectorate at Ras Darbat Ali, and the Island of Socotra. This Department wishes to support the recommendation made by the Resident, and would be glad to be informed whether it would be possible for arrangements to be made accordingly. 3. Copies of this letter, with the enclosure thereto, are being sent to the India Office, Air Ministry and Foreign Office. I am, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (SD.) G.F.SEEL.Copy. At s &amp; COKFIDEKTIAL . The Residency, No. 67 Aden, 27th March, 1933. Sir, I have the honour to refer to my despatch No.66 dated 27th March 1933 dealing with my recent journey to Socotra and other outlying parts of the Aden Protectorate. 2. This tour has strengthened the opinion that I have longheld that there ought to be more direct contact with the outlying parts of the Protectorate which are now seen only at infrequent intervals. I was told at both Abd-el-Kuri and Socotra that these islands were visited two or three years ago by an Italian vessel which laid down marks, took soundings and made surveys. The Aden Residency had no knowledge of these proceedings. Foreigi ships would be less likely to venture on irregularities of this kind in an area which forms part of a British Protectorate if the appearance of British vessels in these waters were not such a rare occurrence. The disinclination of the people of Qishn to allow facilities in their country for the Royal Air Force was mainly due to the Arabs 1 natural mistrust of st:'angers, and was in marked contrast with the attitude of the tribes in the vicinity of Aden, who are familiar with the visits of British officers and are no longer suspicious of their intentions. The construction of landing grounds by the Royal Air Force has brought several ofthe remoter districts of the Protectorate within easy reach; but Socotra, which is 500 miles distant from Aden is accessible only by sea, and many of the towns and villages along the 600 miles of His Majesty’s Secretary of State Protecoorate/ for the Colonies, LONDON.Protectorate coast on the mainland are still without facilities for aircraft, 3, The remedy that commends itself to me is an extension of the Red Sea Patrol. The Gulf of Aden forms part of the East Indies Naval Station, but His Majesty’s ships in this Command are seldom seen at Aden except in transit to and from England, and they are not normally available for cruises in the Gulf. On the other hand the Red Sea Sloops (which belong to the Mediterranean Command) are often at Aden, which they are permitted to use as a base although it is outside the limits of the Red Sea Patrol. They are also allowed to visit Mukaila and Sir ’Ali. It would, in my opinion, be of great political advantage if the existing overlap of the Red Sea Patrol to Aden, Mukaila and Bir ’Ali could be extended to include the whole of the Gulf up to the eastern boundary of the Aden Protectorate at Ras Darbat Ali and including Socotra. I am not directly concerned with the African side of the Gulf of Aden, but I think it probable that its inclusion in this arrangement would be welcomed by the authorities in British Somaliland. I have discussed this proposal with Captain C.S.Sandford, O.3.E., R.N., Senior Officer, Red Sea Sloops and Commander A.R. Farquhar, D.S.C.,R.N., and I understand that it is unlikely to involve any additional expense. I therefore recommend it for your consideration; and I suggest that, subject to your approval, the Admiralty be asked whether it can be arranged. I have, etc., (Signed) B.R.Reilly. Resident, etc.COLONIAL OFFICE, / ^ P.Z.2517/33. DOWNING GIRjiST. 17955/33. 29th April 1933. Sir, I am directed to refer to the letter from this Department of the 13th of February, numbered as above, Fr.Hes.27.3.33 and to previous correspondence regarding the proposal of To Admiralty 29.4.33 the Resident at Aden to visit Socotra and certain To Air MLn. 29.4.33 outlying parts of the Aden Protectorate, and to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, a copy of a despatch from the Resident containing a report on his tour. Copies of letters on the subject which are being addressed to the Admiralty and Air Ministry are also enclosed. 2. It will be observed from paragraph 6 of this despatch that Colonel Reilly expresses the view that Ras Darbat All may be accepted as being the eastern limit of the Aden Protectorate. In this connection attention is invited to It . Laithv/aite * s letter, No.P.4334/1930 of the 11th July 1930, to Mr. Cowell, in which reference is made to the claim of the Sultan of Muscat that the boun dary between his territory and the Aden Protectorate is at Ras Darbat Ali. In view of the opinion expressed by the Resident at Aden the sultan*s claim will no doubt now receive further consideration. 3. A copy of this correspondence is being sent to the Foreign Office. I am, etc. (Sd.) G.F. S£hL&gt;THE RESIDENCY, CONFIDENTIAL* No, 66.66 Aden, 27th March, 1933* Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram dated 2 nd February I 933 and to state that H.H.S. 'Pensance” arrived in Aden on the 23 rd February and that I left in her for Socotra on February 28 th accompanied by Captain H.V. Rose, Personal Assistant, and Flying Officer J.R* Wemyss, Royal Air Force, and returned to Aden on March 12th, after visiting the islands of Abd-el-Kuri and Socotra and the ports of Q,ishn, Mukalla (from which I made a journey inland to the Hadhramaut valley), Bir T Ali and Balihaf. I wish to express my thanks for the arrangements that were made by the Admiralty at the request of the Colonial Office to enable me to undertake this journey, and my obligation to Commander A.R. Farquhar, B. 3 .C., R.N., and lie officers of H.H.S. 'Penzance' for making it a very pleasant one. 2. Some points in my tour may be of interest. 3* As far as I know, the island of Afcd-el- Euri has never previously been visited by officials from Aden. It is about 4 miles in length and barely 2 miles in width at its narrowest point in the centre, where there is an anchorage on the southern side, from which we walked across to the northern shore. The island is devoid of vegetation and its few wells are brackish. The inhabitants, who are said to number about 200 , live in primitive hovels and s Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, London. subsist/subsist on fisti and food brought to them by occasional dhows from Arabia and Africa. Money is practically unknown, and the people deal with the Dhows by bartering .fish and shells for their reQuirements• They acknowledge the sovereignty of the Sultan of Socotra, who has a representative on the island. 4. The large island of Socotra (about 70 miles in length and 20 to JC in width) presents a striking contrast to the desolate Abd-el-Kuri. Its thickly wooded V hills rise to peaks of 4000 and 5000 feet from which streams descend to villages of small, neat houses surrounded by plantations of date trees, patches of water melons, and pasture for sheep and goats and the straight-backed breed of cattle peculiar to Socotra. The present Sultan of Qishn and Socotra, Sultan Ali bin Ahmed Towari bin ’Afrar, has recently been elected in succession to his cousin Sultan Abdulla bin T Isa. He flies a Union Jack on his dar, and his people appear to be simple and friendly. At his own suggestion he accompanied me in H.M.S. 'Penzance” to Qishn, the capital of his Mahri territory on the mainland of Arabia, in order to expedite a settlement of the difficulty about the establishment of an emergency landing ground for the Royal Air Force there, to which references have been made in recent Aden Political Intelligence Summaries (paragraphs 2203 and 2275 ). 5. On our arrival at Qishn the local objections to the landing ground were withdrawn, and the Royal Air Force Officer who accompanied me arranged for the clearing and marking of a suitable site. I accordingly removed the economic pressure which (as reported in Political Intelligence Summary paragraph 2275 ) had been put on the Socotrans and Mahris. The co-operation of the .u-aiti authorities in enforcing this pressure contributedlargely to its success, their refusal to admit two Uahri dhows to the port of Mukalla having made a strong impression. The people at Q,ishn gave us a friendly reception and appeared to welcome the close of the landing ground controversy. 6 . I took the opportunity of my visit to the Sultan of ,ishn and Socotra to consult him regarding the eastern boundary of his mainland possessions, with regard to which the British Resident in the Persian Gulf has lately raised a doubt. The Sultan was rather vague about the question, the decision of which, he said, he would leave entirely to me; but there was a general concurrence among his principal advisers that the boundary between his territory and that of the Sultan of Muscat is at Has Darbat ’Ali, in spite of the fact that there are Mahris living in the villages of Kharifut and Rakhyut to the east of this point. I am therefore of opinion that Ras Darbat f Ali may be accepted as being the eastern limit of the Aden Protectorate. 7 . At Mukalla we were received with his customary courtesy and hospitality by Seyyid Bubakr bin Husein bin Hamid al Mihdhar, the representative of Sultan Umar, who, as usual was absent in India. we were met by Group-Captain Boyd, who had arrived £rom Aden with Colonel Lake, Squadron-Leader Rickards, Squadron-Leader Russell, and Plying Officer R.H. Harris, and were flown to Shibam, about 100 miles from the coast, the principal town in the Qu'aiti portion of the Hadhramaut valley. Both here and in the Kathiri towns of seyyun, Ghurfa and Tarim, to which we travelled by motor car, we were welcomed with a great display of cordiality and hospitality. This was the first visit by a Resident of Aden to the valley of the Hadhramaut/Hadhramaut, and the reception accorded to us bj the Qu’aiti Governor of Shi bam, the Kathirl Sultan of Seyyun and the A1 Kafs and other merchant a of Tarim, and the friendly demeanour of the people in general are indications that the inhabitants of this area no longer deserve the reputation for a fanatical dislike of strangers which they had until lately, and which was evident at the time of the journeys of the Bents and Leo Hirsch in 1893 . This change of attitude is attributable to the close connection that has been established by many Hadhramis with Singapore and Java, where they have acquired wealth and an acquaintance with the modern world, and to the visit of officers of the Royal Air Force at Aden - notably Squadron- Leader A*R.M* Rickards, A.f.C* — and of travellers such as Mr. Van der Meulen and Colonel Boscawen, who have established friendly personal relations with the principal people in the valley. 8 . The appearance and peculiar characteristics of the astonishing succession of mud-brick towns and villages wnicli line the broad valley of the Hadhramaut in the heart of a great area of rocky and desolate wadte, and the degree oi tneir civilisation and modern development have in recent years been made known to the outer world by the aerial photographs taken by Squadron-Leader Cochrane, Squadron-Leader Rickards and other officers of the R.a.F. and by the descriptive books of Van der Meulen and Von V, is smarm, and of Herr Eelfrits. A visit to them is an interesting experience, and mine has given me a vivid impression of the crowded ft sky-scrapers” of Shibam, the picturesque palace of the Kathiri Sultan which dominates the walled city of Seyyun and its surrounding villas and gardens, and/0 and the elaborate residences of the wealthy merchants of Tarim. 9 . Throughout there is a strange mingling of the ancient and the modern - motor cars, garages, and electric light intruding into communities which still indulge in internal feuds and warfare that necessitate walled defences between neighbouring villages and trenches for the protection of cultivators against the sniping of their enemies. The authority of the Kathlri Sultan is limited to Seyyun and a few other places and is openly repudiated elsewhere; while the position of the titular Sultan of Tarim is so feeble that he lives in Seyyun and contents himself with a representative in Tarim who is entirely overshadowed by the local Seyyids and especially by the members of the wealthy and powerful family of the A1 Kafs, who were our hosts in this town. The Qu’aiti Governor of Shibam is said to have better control and to maintain more order at his end of the valley, although his appearance does not suggest a strong ruler. 10. The more enlightened Arabs of the valley are keenly alive to the disadvantages of the lack of efficient government, and they also feel acutely the drawbacks of their isolation from the outside world and the absence of easy communication with the sea. The Al Kafs have been making, at their own expense, a motor road from Tarim to conneot with the Q.u’aiti port of Shihr, about 34 miles east of Mukaila, and have overcome tribal and other difficulties to the extent of completing its construction for most of the distance, a portion over the mountain ridge near the sea is still unmade, and here the promoters of the road are encountering local obstruction secretly inspired, in their opinion, by the Qu»aiti Government, which dislikes a /0 a scheme that may tend to loosen its present grip on the land-looked Kathiris. I found that it is the fashion in the Hadhramaut to attribute most pclitioal and economic ills to the supine selfishness of the absentee Sultan Umar of Lukalla, who Is alleged to waste his time and hisr ©venues in Hyderabad and to obstruct all progress in both the ou ,a iti and the Kathiri territories. The accusation of malevolence is exaggerated, but the charge of neglect and avarice is well founded, 11. The Kathiris, who were in former times in control of the whole country, would like to be rid of their economic and political dependence on the Qu’aitis, and t o have direct relations with the Aden Residency, from which they hope to receive encouragement and support in the improvement of their country and its eiaancipation from ■u T aiti ascendency. Thisd esire is a natural one, but it is necessary for the British authorities at Aden to deal very cautiously with their aspirations. I am personally in favour of cultivating good relations with the Kathiris, whose extensive interests in Singapore and Java give them an importance beyond the limits of the Aden Protectorate, and of encouraging them in their plans for the betterment of their country. But our friendly interest in the fortunes of the Kathiris ought not to be allowed to prejudice our old-standing relations with the Qu T eiti authorities of Hukalla, who control the coast line and whose friendship is one of far more practical value to His Majesty’s Gcwernment than that of the Kathiris. I made it clear both at Mukalla and at Tarim that I had no intention of sacrificing old friends for new, but I urged on the Qu’aiti Regent at Mukalla the desirability of helping the Kathiris in their reasonable aspirations,/0 aspirations, and on the Kathiri Sultan and the Al Kafs the importance to them of preserving good relations with Mukalla. 12, At Shibam the principal subject on which the local u’aiti Governor dwelt was his alleged fear of the possibility of a Zeidi advance against the Hadhramaut through Beihan. 1 reassured him on this point, and told him that His Majesty *s Government had no intention of permitting Zeidi penetration into Beihan, and that they fully realised that it commanded the road from the Yemen to the Hadhramaut. 13* I am indebted to Group-Captain C.T. Boyd, O.B.B., M.C., A.P.C., for arranging the flight to and from Shibam. The details of our journey in the Hadhramaut were dealt with in his usual efficient manner by Squadron- Leader A.R.M. Rickards, A.F.C., R.A.F., whose energy, tact and popularity with the Arabs throughout the Aden Protectorate have been of great political value during his five years 1 service in Aden, which has now unfortunately cone to an end. I shall be glad if an appreciation of his work in the Protectorate from a Political viewpoint can be conveyed to the Air Ministry. I have, etc ., (Sd.) B.R. Reilly.

Y* Yk1897 THE ISLAND OF SOCOTRA [A melancholy interest attaches to this paper, which was the last ever written by its delightful and adventurous author. It reached me from Aden with the letter from him which I subjoin, and the next thing I heard was that he had returned home suddenly and had died. —En. Nineteenth Century. Aden, Feb. 22, 1897. Dear Mr. Knowles, I have occvpied a week of enforced idleness here to put together a short account of an expedition we have just made to the little known island of Socotra. We are going off in a few days for another expedition into Arabia, and the time of our return home is uncertain, so perhaps you will not mind seeing through the proofs. Mrs. Bent joins me in kind regards. Yours sincerely, J. Theodore Bent.] Cast away in the Indian Ocean, like a fragment rejected in the construction of Africa, very mountainous and fertile, yet practically harbourless, the island of Socotra is, perhaps, as little known as any inhabited island on the globe. Geographically it is African, though really it is Arabian. Most people have a glimpse of it on their way to India and Australia; but this glimpse has apparently aroused the desire of none to visit it, for the Europeans w r ho have penetrated into it could be almost counted on the fingers of one hand. During recent years two botanical expeditions visited Socotra, one under Professor Balfour, and one under Dr. Schweinfurth, and the results added marvellously to the knowledge of quaint and hitherto unknown plants. We spent two months on it this winter, traversing it from end to end, with the object of trying to unravel some of its ancient history, so shrouded in mystery, and to learn something about its present inhabitants. Marriette Bey, the eminent Egyptologist, identifies Socotra with To Nuter, a place to be bracketed with the land of Punt in the pictorial decorations in the temple of Deir el Bahari, as resorted to 975t r 976 THE NINETEENTH CENTURY June by the ancients for spices, frankincense and myrrh ; and he is probably correct, for it is pretty certain that no one given spot in reach of the ancients could produce at one and the same time so many of the coveted products of that day—the ruby-coloured dragon’s blood {Draco Kinnabari of Pliny), three distinct species of frankincense, several kinds of myrrh, besides many other valuable gum-producing trees, and aloes of super-excellent quality. It is, perhaps, annoying to have to add another to the list of the many tongues spoken in the world, but I think there is no room for doubt that Socoteri must be added to that already distracting catalogue. Before going there we were informed that the inhabitants spoke a language closely resembling the Mahri tongue of Southern Arabia, and we very nearly committed the indiscretion of engaging a Mahri-speaking interpreter at Aden. Though Socotra has been under Mahri rule probably since before our era—for Arrian tells us that in his day the island of Dioscorida, as it was then called, was under the rule of the king of the Arabian frankincense country, and the best days of that country were long before Arrian’s time—never theless, the inhabitants have kept their language quite distinct both from Mahri and from Arabic. Of course, it is naturally strongly im pregnated with words from both these tongues; but the fundamental words of the language are distinct, and in a trilingual parallel list of close on 300 words, which I took down in the presence of Mahri-, Socoteri-, and Arabic-speaking people on the island, I found dis tinctly more in the language derived from an Arab than from a Mahri source. In subtlety of sound Socoteri is painfully rich, transcribing the words causing us the most acute agony. They corkscrew their tongues, they gurgle in their throats, and bring sounds from most alarming depths, but luckily they do not click. They have no word for a dog, for there is not a dog on the island ; neither for a horse or a lion, for the same reason ; but for all the animals, trees and articles commonly found there they have words as distinct from the Arabic and Mahri as cheese is from fromage. Dr. Schweinfurth sees in the name of Socotra a Hindoo origin, and the survival of the Hindoo name for the island, Diu Sukutura, which the Greeks after their easy-going fashion changed into Dioscorides; this is very ingenious, and very likely correct. When the Portuguese reached it in 1538, they found the Arab sheikh dwelling at the capital, called Zoko, now in ruins, and still called Suk, a survival, doubtless, of the ancient name. The present capital is apparently a Latinised form of the Arabic tamar, or date fruit, which The old capital of Zoko is a delicious spot, and the ruins are1897 THE ISLAND OF SOCOTRA 977 buried in groves of palm trees by the side of a large and deep lagoon of fresh water ; this lagoon is only separated from the sea by a narrow belt of sand, and it seems to me highly probable that this was the ancient harbour, where the boats in search of the precious products of the island found shelter. The southern coast of Arabia affords many instances of these silted-up harbours, and the northern coast of Socotra is similar, many of the lagoons, or Ichors as they call them, being deep and running over a mile inland. The view at Suk over the wide lagoon fringed with palm groves, on to the jagged heights of Mount Haghier rising immediately behind, is, I think, to be placed amongst the most enchanting pictures I have ever seen. Extensive excavation at Suk might probably bring to light some interesting relics of the earlier inhabitants of this island; but it would have to be deep, as later edifices have been erected here ; and labour and tools would have to be brought from elsewhere. Much is said by old writers about the Gireek colonists who came to Socotra in ancient times, but I cannot help thinking that the Hellenic world never carried its enterprise much in this direction, for, if they did, they have left no trace whatsoever of their existence there. The few inscriptions we found on the island are all purely Ethiopic. We got one at the west of the island, near Kalenzia, very much obliterated, but in Ethiopic characters of a late date; we got another inscribed stone to the east of the island, bearing similar lettering; and the large flat, inscribed surface at Eriosh, on the northern coast, of such soft stone that we could easily cut into it with pebbles, is covered with purely Ethiopic graffiti, exactly similar to those found in and around Aksum in Abyssinia—long serpent-like trails of Ethiopic words, with rude drawings interspersed of camels, snakes, and so forth. Conspicuous amongst these are the numerous representations of two feet side by side, with a cross frequently inserted in one of them; there are many separate crosses, too, on this flat surface—crosses in circles, just exactly like what one gets on Ethiopic coins. Hard by this flat, inscribed surface are many tombs of an ancient date. These tombs, which are found dotted over the island, bear a remarkable resemblance to the tombs of the Bedja race, once dwelling on the shores of the Red Sea to the north of Suakim, and subject to the Ethiopian emperor; they consist of enormous blocks of unhewn stone inserted in the ground to encircle and cover the tomb ; and this forms another link connecting the remains on the island with Abyssinia. When the Abyssinian Christian monarchs conquered Arabia in the early centuries of our era, and Christianised a large portion of that country, they probably did the same by Socotra, and, inasmuch as this island was far removed from any political centre, Christianity probably existed here to a much later period than it did in Arabia.in r 978 THE NINETEENTH CENTURY June Marco Polo touched here, and alludes to the Christians of the island. Francis Xavier, on his way to India, and Father Vincenzo are explicit in describing a base form of Christianity as existing here as late as the middle of the seventeenth century. Needless to say that all osten sible traces of our cult have long ago been obliterated, and the only Socoteri religious term which differs in any way from the usual Mohammedan nomenclature is the name for the devil; but we found, as I have already said, the carved crosses on the flat surface at Eriosh, and we found a rock at the top of a hill to the east of the island which had been covered with rude representations of the Ethiopic cross. Scattered all over the island are deserted ruined villages, differing but little from those of to-day, except that the inhabitants call them all Frankish work, and admit that once Franks dwelt in them of the cursed sect of the Nazarenes. I feel little hesi tation in saying that a branch of the Abyssinian Church once existed in Socotra, and that its destruction is of comparatively recent date. If we consider that the ordinary village churches in Abyssinia are of the flimsiest character—a thatched roof resting on a low round wall—we can easily understand how the churches of Socotra have disappeared. In most of these ruined villages round enclosures are to be found, some with apsidal constructions, which are very probably all that is left of the churches. Near Eas Momi, to the east of the island, we discovered a curious form of ancient sepulture. Caves in the limestone rocks have been filled with human bones from which the flesh had previously decayed. These caves were then walled up and left as charnel-houses, after the fashion still observed in the Eastern Christian Church. Amongst the bones we found carved wooden objects which looked as if they had originally served as crosses to mark the tombs, in which the corpses had been permitted to decay prior to their removal to the charnel-house, or KoifirjTrjpia, as the modern Greeks call them. The quondam Christianity of Socotra, I think, is thoroughly well established, and its nature as a branch of the Abyssinian Church. I wish we could speak as confidently about the origin of the so-called Bedouins, the pastoral inhabitants of the island, who inhabit the valleys and heights of Mount Haghier, and wander over the surface of the island with their flocks and herds. It has been often asserted that these Bedouins are Troglodytes, or cave-dwellers pure and simple, but I do not think this is substantially correct. None of them, as far as we could ascertain, dwell always or by preference in caves ; but all of them own stone-built tenements, however humble, in some warm and secluded valley, and they only abandon these to dwell in caves when driven to the higher regions in f 197 THE ISLAND OF SOCOTRA 979 Whilst we were on the island the season was exceptionally dry, and most of the villages in the valleys were entirely abandoned for the mountain caves. The Bedouin is decidedly a handsome individual, lithe of limb like his goats, and with a cafe-au-lait-co\o\xxedL skin; he has a sharp profile, excellent teeth; he often wears a stubbly black beard and has beautifully pencilled eyebrows, and though differing entirely in lan guage, in physique and type he closely resembles the Bedouin found in the Mahri and Gara mountains. Furthermore, the mode of life is the same—dwelling in caves when necessary, but having permanent abodes on the lower lands ; and they have several other striking points in common. Greetings take place between the Arabian Bedouins and the Socotran Bedouins in similar fashion, by touching each cheek and then rubbing the nose. We found the Bedouin of Mount Haghier fond of dancing and playing his teherane, and also peculiarly lax in his religious observances ; and though ostensibly conforming to Mohammedan practice, they observe next to none of their precepts ; and it is precisely the same with the Bedouins whom we met in the Gara Mountains. There is certainly nothing African about the Socotran Bedouins ; therefore I am inclined to consider him as a branch of that aboriginal race which inhabited Arabia, with a language of its own ; and when Arabia is philologically understood and its various races investigated, I expect we shall hear of several new languages spoken by different branches of this aboriginal race, and then, perhaps, a parallel will be found to the proudly isolated tongue of this remote island. The Bedouin’s house is round, and surrounded by a round wall in which the flocks are penned at night; it is flat-roofed and covered with soil, and inside it is as destitute of interest as it is possible to con ceive—a few mats on which the family sleep, a few jars in which they store their butter, and a skin churn in which they make the same. In one house into which I penetrated I found a bundle hanging from the ceiling, which I found to be a baby by the exposure of one of its little feet. Everything is poor and pastoral. He has hardly any clothes to cover himself with, nothing to keep him warm when the weather is damp, save his home-spun sheet; and he has not a soul above his flocks. The closest intimacy exists between the Bedouin and his goats and his cows ; the animals understand and obey certain calls with absolute accuracy, and you generally see a Socotran shepherdess walking before her flock, and not after it; and they stroke and caress their little cows until they are as tame as dogs. The cows in Socotra are far more numerous than one would expect, and j there is excellent pasturage for them ; they are a very pretty little breed, smaller than our Alderney, without the hump, and with the long dewlap; they are fat and plump, and excellent milkers.980 THE NINETEENTH CENTURY June The Bedouin does very little in the way of cultivation, but when grass is scarce, and consequently milk, he turns his attention to the sowing of jowari in little round fields dotted about the valleys, with a wall round to keep the goats off. In each of these he digs a well, and waters his crop before sunrise and after sunset; the field is divided into little compartments by stones, the better to retain the soil and water; and sometimes you will see a Bedouin papa with his wife and son tilling these bijou fields with pointed bits of wood, for other tools are unknown to them. Socotra without Mount Haghier would be like a body without a soul. Haghier makes it in every sense of the word. Kising as it does to a height close on 5,000 feet in many jagged and stupendous peaks, Haghier occupies a central position in the island, and catches the fugitive sea mists, which so rarely visit the Arabian coast, at all seasons of the year. Bubbling cascades and deep pools are found in all its valleys at the driest season of the year, and in the rainy season these become impassable torrents, sweeping trees and rocks before them; and the hillsides up to the edge of the bare granite peaks are thickly clothed with vegetation. Three considerable streams run to the south of Mount Haghier, fertilising three splendid valleys until the waters, as the sea is ap proached, lose themselves in the sand. To the north there are many more streams, and inasmuch as the sea is considerably nearer, they all reach it, or rather the silted-up lagoons already alluded to. By the side of these streams innumerable palm groves grow ; in fact, dates form the staple food of the islander. And out of his date tree he gets branches for his hedges, stems for his roofs; the leaf provides him with his sleeping-mats, and, when beaten on stones, with fibre, with which they are exceedingly clever in making ropes. Our camel-men were always at it, and produced, with the assistance of fingers and toes, the most excellent rope at the shortest possible notice. They also make strong girdles with this fibre, which the niggers who are employed in fertilising the palm trees bind round their bodies and the trees so as to facilitate their ascent, and provide them with a firm seat when the point of operation is reached. They weave, too, baskets, or rather stiff sacks, in which to hang their luggage on either side of the camel. A Socotran camel-man is a most dexterous packer. He must do away with his camel’s hump by placing against it three or four thick mats or nummuds, and on this raised surface he hangs all his luggage, carefully secured in his baskets, with the result that we never, during any of our expeditions with camels, had so little damage done to our property, even though the roads were so mountainous and the box- tree bushes constantly rubbing against them. The camels, too, are very fine specimens of their race, standing considerably higher than1897 THE ISLAND OF SOCOTRA 981 the Arabian animal, and when mounted on the top of our luggage, above the hump thus unnaturally raised, we felt at first disagreeably elevated. Whilst on the subject of camels and camel trappings, I may add that each owner has his own mark painted and branded on his own property. Some of these marks consist purely of Himyaritic letters, whilst others are variants, which would naturally arise from copying an alphabetic original, very old-world. I take these marks to be preserved by the steady conservatism of the Oriental; we copied many of them, and the result looks like a partial reproduction of the old Sabaean alphabet. The glory of Mount Haghier is undoubtedly its dragon’s-blood tree found scattered at an elevation of about 1,000 feet and upwards over the greater part of Socotra. Certainly it is the quaintest tree imaginable, from 20 to 30 feet high, exactly like a green umbrella which is just in the process of being blown inside out, I thought. One of our party thought them like huge green toadstools, another like trees made for a child’s Noah’s ark. It is a great pity that the Socotrans of to-day do not make more use of the rich ruby-red gum which issues from its bark wdien punctured, and which produces a valuable resin, now used as varnish ; but the tree is now found in more enterprising countries—in Sumatra, in South America, and elsewhere. So the export of dragon’s blood from its own ancient home is now practically nil. If the dragon’s-blood tree, with its close-set, radiating branches and stiff, aloe-like leaves, is quaint—and some might be inclined to say u gly—^ has,nevertheless, its economic use; but not so its still quainter c omrade on the slopes of Mount Ilaghier, the gouty, swollen-stemmed Adenium. This, I think, is the ugliest tree in creation, wdth one of the most beautiful of flowers ; it looks like one of the first efforts of Dame Nature in tree-making, happily abandoned by her for more, graceful shapes and forms. The swollen and twisted contortions of its trunk recall with a shudder those miserable sufferers from elephantiasis; its leaves are stiff and formal, and they usually drop off, as if ashamed of themselves, before the lovely flower, like a rich- coloured, large oleander blossom, comes out. The adenium bears some slight resemblance, on a small scale, to the unsightly baobab tree of Africa, and looks as if it belonged to a different epoch of crea tion to our own trees at home. Then there is the cucumber tree, another hideous-stemmed tree, swollen and whitish; and the hill slopes covered with this look as if they had been decorated with so many huge composite candles which had guttered horribly. At the top of the candle are a few short branches, on which grow a few stiff crinkly leaves and small yellow flowers, which produce the edible fruit. This tree, the Dendrosicyos Socotrana of the botanist, is alone, like the language of Vol. XLI—No. 244 q tt982 THE NINETEENTH CENTURY June the Bedouin, found on Socotra, and is seldom more than 10 or 12 feet in height. It is a favourite perch for three or four of the white vultures which swarm in the island, and the picture formed by these ungainly birds on the top of this ungainly tree is an odd one. To the south of Mount Haghier one comes across valleys entirely full of frankincense trees, with rich red leaves, like autumn tints, and clusters of blood-red flowers. No one touches the trees here, and this natural product of the island is now absolutely ignored. Then there are the myrrhs, also ignored, and other gum-producing plants; and the gnarled tamarinds, affording lovely shade, the fruit of which the natives do, oddly enough, know the value of, and make a cooling drink therewith. Then there are the tree euphorbias, which look as if they were trying to mimic the dragon’s blood, the branches of which the natives throw into the lagoons so that the fish may be killed, and the poisonous milky juice of which they rub on the bottoms of their canoes to prevent leakage. Such are among the oddest to look upon of Socotra’s vegetable productions. Wild oranges, too, are found on Mount Haghier, of a very rich yellow when ripe, but bitter as gall to eat; and the wild pomegranate, with its lovely red flowers and small yellow fruit, the flannelly coating of which is only eaten, instead of the seeds, as is the case with the cultivated one. The Bedouins would bring us aloes both in leaf and in solution, in hopes that we might take a fancy to this venerable Socotran production. Now a very little of it is collected, and everybody takes what he likes from the nearest source, whereas, I believe, in former times, when aloes were an object of commerce here, the plantations were strictly divided off by walls, and the owners jealously looked after their property. The vegetable world is indeed richly represented in this remote island, and one could not help thinking what possibilities it would offer for the cultivation of lucrative plants, such as tobacco, which is now grown by the natives in small quantities, as is also cotton; and perhaps coffee and tea would thrive on the higher elevations. Some of our camps on Mount Haghier, and the expeditions therefrom, were very delightful. At a spot called Adahan, where a sort of pass winds its way between the granite peaks, we were encamped for several days at an elevation of close on 3,000 feet above the sea-level. Here, when the mist came down upon us, we were enveloped in clouds, rain, and wretchedness; but the air to us was cool and invigorating, though I fear our scantily clad attendants found it anything but agreeable. There were drawbacks, too, to the enjoyment of our mountain camps in the shape of several kinds of pernicious grasses, which grew thickly round our tent, and the seeds of which penetrated relentlessly into everything. Grass thorns invaded our day and night raiment,1897 THE ISLAND OF SOCOTRA 983 getting into places hitherto deemed impregnable, and the prickly sensation caused by them was irritating to both body and mind. Mount Haghier is such a very peaky mountain. Ghebel Bit Molok (a name which sounds, by the way, as if it was of Assyrian origin) is the highest; it is very sheer and unapproachable at its summit, and though only 4,900 feet high will give trouble to the adventurous crag-climber who is bent on conquering it. Then there are the Dryat peaks, the Adouna peaks, and many others piercing the sky-like needles, around which wild goats and civet cats roam wild, but no other big game. From Adahan we were easily able to ascend to the highest ground ; though perhaps one ought not to say easily, for climbing is no joke up here through dense vegetation and rocky gullies. Looking down into the gorges, we enjoyed some splendid effects, and I was con stantly reminded of the Grand Corral of Madeira. Of all our camps in the more mountainous district, I think one called Yehagahaz was decidedly the prettiest. It was low down on the southern slope of Mount Haghier; our tents were pitched in a grove of palm trees at the meeting of two rushing streams ; tangled vege tation hung around us on every side, and in whichever way we looked we had glimpses of granite peaks and rugged hillsides clad with dragon’s blood. The village was quite hidden by trees and creepers, but its inhabitants were away on the higher pasturage, and our men occupied the empty tenements. Then, again, Fereghet was a most charming spot. Here our tents were pitched beneath wide-spreading tamarinds, and we could walk in shade for a considerable distance under these gigantic old trees. Fereghet, moreover, was the site of an ancient ruined town which interested us exceedingly; walls, 8 to 10 feet thick, had been constructed out of large unhewn boulders to check the torrent, which in the rainy season rushes down here, carrying all before it to the sea. These walls are clearly the work of an age long gone by, when weight moving was better understood than it is at present, and doubtless the ruins of Fereghet maybe traced back to the days when Socotra was resorted to for its gums. The fine old tamarind trees had done much to destroy the colossal wall, only about 100 feet of which now remains ; but there are many other traces of ruins and a small fort of later date. It is likely enough that Fereghet was a great centre of the trade of the island, for frankincense, myrrh, and dragon’s blood grow copiously around, and the position under the slopes of Haghier, and in almost the centre of the island, was suitable for such a town. We opened a tomb not very far from Fereghet with a great block of stone over it 6 feet long by 3 feet thick; but the ill-conditioned relatives of the deceased had placed nothing therein save the corpse; and we were annoyed not to find any trace of inscriptions 3 u 2984 THE NINETEENTH CENTURY June near this ruined town, which might have thrown some light on the subject. All I feel sure of is that the Portuguese did not build this town, as it is commonly asserted. In fact I did not see any building on the island which can definitely be ascribed to that nation. W hen one has seen the elaborate forts erected by the Portuguese on the coasts of the Persian Gulf and East Africa, one feels pretty confident in asserting that they took no steps to permanently settle themselves in Socotra ; in fact their occupation of it only extended o\ er a period of four years, and the probability is that, finding it harbourless, and worth little for their purposes of a depot on the road to India, they never thought it worth their while to build any permanent edifices. On the plain behind Tamarida there is a conical hill about 200- feet high called Hasan, which has been fortified as an Acropolis, and was provided with cemented tanks. These ruins have also been called Portuguese, but they looked to me more Arabic in character. There are also the foundations of some curious unfinished houses at Kadhoop, also assigned to the Portuguese ; but there appears to me to be no reason whatsoever for ascribing these miserable remains to the builders of the fine forts at Muscat, the founders of Ormuz and Goa, and the lords of the East up to the seventeenth century. Below Fereghet the valley gets broader and runs straight down to the sea at the south of the island, where the streams from Mount Haghier all lose themselves in a vast plain of sand called Noget. This is the widest point of the island of Socotra, and it is really only thirty-six miles between the sea at Tamarida and the sea at Noget, but the intervention of Mount Haghier and its ramifications make it appear a very long way indeed. The island to the east and to the west of its great mountain very soon loses its fantastic scenery and its ample supply of water. We first landed on Socotra at the town of Kalenzia, at the extreme western end of the island, with an apology for a port or roadstead facing Africa, and the one most sheltered during the prevalence of the north-east monsoon. Kalenzia is a wretched spot, a jumble, like the capital, of the scum of the East: Arab traders, a Banyan or two, a considerable Negroid population in the shape of soldiers and slaves, and Bedouins from the mountains, who come down with their skins ’and jars of clarified butter to despatch in dhows to Zanzibar, Muscat, and other butterless places. Butter is now the great and almost the only export of the island, and the butter of Socotra has quite a reputation of its own m the markets on the shores of Arabia and Africa. The Bedouin’s life is given up to the production of butter, and the Sultan of Socotra owns a dhow which exports it in very large quantities ; and for this purpose thev keep their numerous flocks and herds—more numerous, I think, than I ever saw before in so limited a space.1897 THE ISLAND OF SOCOTRA 985 Scattered over Socotra 'there are numerous villages, each being a little cluster of from five to ten round or oblong houses and round cattle pens. I was informed by a competent authority on the island that there are 400 of these pastoral villages between Eas Kalenzia and Eas Momi, a distance of some 70 odd miles as the crow flies ; and from the frequency with which we came across them during our marches up only a limited number of Socotra’s many valleys, I should think the number is not over-estimated. If this is so, the population of the island must be considerably over the estimate given, and must approach twelve or thirteen thousand souls ; but owing to the migratory nature of the inhabitants, and their life, half spent in houses and half in caves, any exact census would be exceedingly hard to obtain. Kalenzia, like Tamarida, has its lagoon, fed by water coming down from its more humble, encircling mountains, reaching an altitude of about 1,500 feet. The shore here is rendered pestiferous by rotten seaw r eed and the bodies of sharks, with back fin and tail cut off, exposed for drying on the beach, and the eight days we had to tarry at Kalenzia before our journey inland could be arranged for were the most tedious of those we spent on the island. Kalenzia boasts of a wretched little mosque, in character like those found in third-rate villages in Arabia ; Kadhoop possesses another, and Tamarida no less than two; and these represent the sum-total of the present religious edifices in Socotra, for the Bedouins in their mountain villages do not care for religious observances, and own no mosques. It is a wonder that all the inhabitants of Kalenzia do not die from fever, for the lagoon here is very fetid-looking, and they drink from nothing else ; w r e preferred the brackish wnter from a well hard by until we discovered a nice stream under the slopes of the mountains about three miles away, to which we sent skins to be filled. This stream is under the northern slopes of the Kalenzia range, and near it are the ruins of an ancient town, and as it trickles on towards the island it fertilises the country exceedingly, and its banks are rich in palms and other trees. The abandoned site of this old town is infinitely preferable to the modern one, and much healthier. Whilst at Kalenzia we must have had nearly all the inhabitants of the place at our tent asking for a remedy for one disease or another ; mostly gastric troubles they seemed to be, udiich they would describe as pains revolving in their inside like a wheel, and wounds. The Socotran medical lore is exceedingly crude. One old man we found by the shore having the bowels of a crab put on a very sore finger by way of ointment; a baby of very tender age (11 months) had had its back so seared by a redhot iron that it could get no rest, and cried most piteously. They have no soap, no oil, no idea of washing or cleansing a wound, and cauterisation with a hot iron appears to bemammmmmmm Y 986 THE NINETEENTH CENTURY June their panacea for every ailment. Yet the Bedouins in the mountains certainly understand the efficacy of clipping; one of our servants had a touch of fever, and the native leech, who demanded 2 annas from me as his fee, shaved a bit of hair off his patient’s head, punc tured the skin, and to this applied a horn, which he sucked, and then proceeded with certain incantations necessary to complete the cure, sitting and looking at his patient, and making passes with his hands as if he were about to mesmerise him. A favourite remedy with them is to stop up a nostril with a plug to prevent certain noxious scents penetrating into it ; but, as far as we could see, they make no use whatsoever of the many medicinal herbs which grow so abundantly on the island. The women of Kalenzia use turmeric largely for dyeing their faces and their bodies yellow, a custom very prevalent on the south coast of Arabia; they wear long robes, sometimes dyed with indigo, some times of a bright scarlet hue, the train of which is cast over one arm, and a loose veil of a gauzy nature, with which they conceal half their faces. Silver rings and bracelets of a very poor character and glass bangles complete their toilet, and the commoner class and Bedouin women weave a strong cloth in narrow strips of goat’s hair, which they wrap in an unelegant fashion round their loins to keep them warm. From one end of Socotra to the other we never found anything the least characteristic or attractive amongst the possessions of the islanders, nothing but poor examples of what one finds everywhere on the south coast of Arabia. Many weddings were going on during our residence at Kalenzia, and at them w r e witnessed a ceremony which I had not seen before. On the morning of the festive day the Socotrans, negro slaves being apparently excluded, assembled in a room and seated themselves round it. Three men played tambourines or tom-toms of skin called teheranes, and to this music they chanted passages out of the Koran, led by the ‘ mollah ; ’ this formed a sort of religious preliminary to a marriage festival; and in the evening, of course, the dancing and singing took place to the dismal tune of the same tom-toms, detri mental very,to our earlier slumbers. The teherane would seem to be the favourite and only Socotran instrument of music—if we except flutes made of the leg-bones of birds common on the opposite coast, and probably introduced from there—and finds favour alike with Arab, Bedouin, and negro. The houses of Kalenzia are pleasantly shaded amongst the palm groves, and have nice little gardens attached, in which gourds, melons, and tobacco grow ; and in the middle of the paths between them one is liable to stumble over turtle backs, used as hencoops for some wretched specimens of the domestic fowl which exist here, and which lay eggs about the size of a pigeon’s. Owing to the scarcity of water in the south-western corner of the1897 THE ISLAND OF SOCOTRA 987 island we were advised not to visit it; the wells were represented to us as dry, and the sheep as dying, though the goats still managed to keep plump and well liking. Perhaps the drought which has lately visited India may have affected Socotra too; and we were told before going there that a copious rainfall might be expected during December and January; but during our stay on the island we had hardly any &amp; rain, except when up on the heights of Mount Haghier. We took five days in getting from Kalenzia to Tamarida, and found the water question on this route rather a serious one until we reached Mori and Kadhoop, where the streams from the high mountains began. Mori is a charming little spot by the sea, with a fine stream and a lagoon, and palms and bright yellow houses as a foreground to the dark blue mountains. Kadhoop is another fishing village built by the edge of the sea, with a marshy waste of sand separating it from the hills ; it possesses a considerable number of surf-boats and canoes, and catamarans on which the fishermen ply their trade. Just outside the town women were busy baking large pots for the export of butter, placing dung fires around them for this purpose. The Socotrans are very crude in their ceramic productions, and seem to have not the faintest inclination to decorate their jars in any way. Between Kadhoop and Tamarida the spurs of Mount Haghier jut right out into the sea, forming a bold and rugged coast-line, and the path which connects the two places is as fine a one to look upon as I have ever seen. It is marvellous to see the camels struggling along this road, and awful to hear their groans, and the shouts of the camel-men as they struggle up and down and in and out of rocks; in parts the road was so bad that we had to engage twelve men to carry our luggage slung on long poles. The views inland up the rugged yellow crags, covered with ver dure and studded with the quaint gouty trees, are weird and extra ordinary, and below at our feet the waves dashed up in clouds of white spray. We had heard much of the difficulties of this road and the dangers for foot-passengers, and we were told of the bleach ing bones of the camels which had fallen into the abyss below. In fact, at Kadhoop our men tried all they could to persuade us to go round by sea; but we ourselves experienced none of these difficulties. We certainly saw the bones of one camel below us, but none of ours followed its example; but we revelled in the beauty of our surround ings, which made us think nothing of the toilsome scramble up and down the rocks. As we left the mountain side and approached the plain of Tamarida we passed close by what would seem to have been an ancient ruined fort on the cliff above the sea, evidently intended to guard this path. Sultan Salem of Socotra, the nephew of old Sultan Ali of Kisheen,988 THE NINETEENTH CENTURY June the monarch of the Mahri tribe, whom we had visited two years before on the south coast of Arabia, governs the island as his uncle’s deputy. He has a castle at Tamarida of very poor and dilapidated appearance, which he rarely inhabits, preferring to live in the hills near G-arriah,' or at his miserable house at Hanlaf, some eight miles along the coast from Tamarida. Hanlaf is as ungainly a spot as it is possible to con ceive, without water, without wood, and invaded by sand ; quite the ugliest place we saw on the island, its only recommendation being that during the north-east monsoons the few dhows which visit the island anchor there, since it affords some sort of shelter from the winds in that direction, and Sultan Salem has a keen eye to business. His Majesty came to visit us shortly after our arrival at Tamarida from his country residence, and favoured us with an audience in the courtyard of his palace, with all the great men of the island seated around him. He is a man of fifty, with a handsome but somewhat sinister face; he was girt as to his head with a many-coloured kafceh, and as to his loins with a girdle supporting a finely inlaid Muscat dagger and a sword. His body was enveloped in a clean white robe, and his feet were bare. We had again occasion to see him before we left the island, when we were bargaining with him for the use of his own dhow to take us back to Aden; and we found him in business matters very grasping and cunning, and, after demanding four times as much as we ought to pay, he finally managed to extort from us double the proper sum by forbidding the captains of any other craft to deal with us. This degenerate descendant of the kings of the frankincense country did not impress us much as a man in whom we could place implicit con fidence, but nevertheless he gave us two fat kine and four lean lambs. Certainly Tamarida is a pretty place, with its river, its lagoon, and its palms, its whitewashed houses and whitewashed mosques, and with its fine view of the Haghier range immediately behind it. The mosques are new, and offering but little in the way of architectural beauty, for the fanatical Wahhabees from Nejd swept over the island in 1801, and in their religious zeal destroyed the places of worship; and the extensive cemeteries still bear testimony to the ravages of these iconoclasts in ruined tombs and overturned headstones. Still, as in Marco Polo’s time, there is a mysterious glamour about the inhabitants of this island. They bear a very uncanny character with their neighbours, and two nervous Somali lads, who accompanied us in the capacity of servants, expressed great fear of being bewitched, and got hold of a story of a woman of Muscat who was bewitched by a Socotran and turned into a seal, in which form she was compelled to swim to the island. This imputation of magic power has survived long, for in ancient days Socotran women were believed to lure ships on to their doom with their magic wiles, and to possess the power of1897 THE ISLAND OF SOCOTRA 989 producing calms and storms at will. As for the inhabitants of Tama- rida, they are much afraid of certain jinni, or goblins, which haunt their stream, and never, if they can help it, go near it at night. 'We hired our camels for our journey eastwards from the Arab merchants at Tamarida; they are the sole camel proprietors in the island, as the Bedouins own nothing but their flocks: and excellent animals they are, too—the strongest and tallest I have seen. Of our camel-men, some were Bedouins and some were niggers, and we found them on the whole honest and obliging, and with the usual keen eye for a possible backsheesh, not uncommon elsewhere. The eastern end of Socotra is similar in character to the west, being a low continuation of the spurs of Haghier, intersected with valleys, and with a plateau stretching right away to Bas Momi about 1,800 feet above the sea-level. This plateau is a perfect paradise for shepherds, with much rich grass all over it; but it is badly watered, and water has to be fetched from the valleys below. In the lower ground are found quantities of wild donkeys, which, the Bedouins complained, were in the habit of trampling upon and killing their goats. Whether these donkeys are naturally wild or descendants of escaped tamed ones I am unable to say. Some are dark and some are white, and their skins seemed to me more glossy than those of the domestic moke. The Bedouins like to catch them if they can, and tame them for domestic use. The east of the island is decidedly more populous than the west, as the water supply is better, and we were constantly passing the little round-housed villages, with their palm groves and their flocks. At first we kept along the lower ground for some time, passing by Garriah Khor, a very long inlet or lagoon which stretches inland for at least two miles ; and then we ascended to a plateau which runs all the way to Kas Momi, about 1,500 feet above the sea-level. We found here large numbers of Bedouins dwelling in deep caves with their cattle; and as we ascended we passed a peak 2,000 feet high, called Godahan, which has a great hole in the middle of it, through which a large patch of sky is visible. Behind this peak is a curious flat ridge, raised not so many feet above the plateau, which is called Matagioti, and is perfectly honeycombed with fissures and crevices, offering delightful homes for people of troglodytic tendencies. Huge fig trees grow in these crevices, and dragon’s-blood trees, and the large herds of cows and goats revel in the rich carpet of grass which covers the flat surface of the plateau. Unfortunately, this rich pasture ground is only indifferently supplied with water. We obtained ours from two very nasty holes where rain water had lain, and in which many cattle had washed ; and when these dry up the Bedouins have to go down to the lower valleys in search of it. Before we left it had assumed the appearance of porter. As Ras Momi is approached the country wears a very desolate990 THE NINETEENTH CENTURY June aspect; there are no trees here, but low bushes and stunted adeniums covered with lichen ; very little water, but plenty of undulating grass- covered hills. It is curious that in this somewhat wild and at present uninteresting locality we found more traces of ruins and bygone habitations than we found in any other part of the island. About five miles from Eas Momi, and hidden by an amphitheatre of low hills on the watershed between the two seas, we came across the foundations of a large square building, constructed out of very large stones, and with great regularity. It was 105 feet square; the outer wall was 6 feet thick, and it was divided inside into several com partments by transverse walls. To the south-east corner was attached an adjunct, 14 by 22 feet. There was very little soil in this build ing ; nothing whatever save the foundations to guide us in our specu lations as to what this could be. Other ruins of a ruder and more irregular character lay scattered in the vicinity, and at some remote period, when Socotra was in its brighter days, this must have been an important centre of civilisation. The hills all about here are divided into irregular plots by long piles of stones stretching in every direction, certainly not the work of the Socotrans of to-day, but the work of some people who valued every inch of ground, and utilised it for some purpose or other. The miles of walls we passed here, and rode over with our camels, give to the country somewhat the aspect of the Yorkshire wolds. It has been suggested that they were erected as divisions for aloe-growing; but I think if this was the case traces of aloes would surely be found here still; aloes are still abundant about Fereghet and the valleys of Haghier, but here near Eas Momi there are none. Near the summit of one hill we passed an ancient and long disused reservoir, dug in the side of the hill, and constructed with stones ; and during our stay here we visited the sites of many ancient villages, and found the cave charnel-houses already alluded to. Before leaving this corner of the island we journeyed to the edge of the plateau and looked down the steep cliffs at the Eastern Cape, where Eas Momi pierces with a series of diminishing heights the Indian Ocean. The waves were dashing over the remains of a wreck, still visible, of a German vessel which went down here with all hands some few years ago, and the Bedouins produced for our edification several fragments of German print, which they had treasured up, and which they deemed of fabulous value. Eas Momi somewhat reminded us of Cape Finisterre, in Brittany, and as a dangerous point for navigation it also resembles it closely. We took a southern path westward again, and after a few days of somewhat monotonous travelling after leaving Eas Momi we again came into the deeper valleys and finer scenery of the central district1897 THE ISLAND OF SOCOTRA 991 of the island, and found our way across the heights of Haghier to Tamarida again. I should think few places in the world have pursued the even tenor of their ways over so many centuries as Socotra has. Yakout, writing 700 years ago, speaks of the Arabs as ruling here ; the author of the Periplus tells us the same thing ; and now we have a repre sentative of the same country and the same race governing the island still. Socotra has followed the fortunes of Arabia ; throughout, the same political and religious influences which have been at work in Arabia have been felt here. Socotra, like Arabia, has gone through its several stages of Pagan, Christian, and Mohammedan beliefs. The first time it came in contact with modern ideas and modern civili sation was when the Portuguese occupied it in 1538; and this was, as we have seen, ephemeral. Then the island fell under the rod of Wahhabee persecution at the beginning of this century, as did nearly the whole of Arabia in those days. In 1835 it was for a short time brought under direct British influence, and Indian troops encamped on the plain of Tamarida. It was then uncertain whether Aden or Socotra would be chosen as a coaling station for India, and Lieutenant Wellsted was sent in the Palinurus to take a survey of it; but doubtless the harbourless condition of the island, and the superior advantages Aden afforded for fortification and for commanding the mouth of the Red Sea, influenced the final decision, and Socotra, with its fair mountains and rich fertility, was again allowed to relapse into its pristine state of quiescence, and the British soldier was con demned to sojourn on the barren, burning rocks of Aden, instead of in this island paradise. Finally, in 1876, to prevent the island being acquired by any other nation, the British Government entered into a treaty with the Sultan, by which the latter gets 360 dollars a year, and binds himself and his heirs and, successors, £ amongst other things, to protect any vessel, foreign or British, with the crew, passengers and cargo, that may be wrecked on the island of Socotra and its dependencies,’ and it is understood that the island is never to be ceded to a foreign Power without British consent. A more peaceful, law-abiding people it would be hard to find else where— S uch a sharp contrast to the tribes on the south Arabian coast. They seem never to quarrel amongst themselves, as far as we could see, and the few soldiers Sultan Salem possesses have a remarkably easy time of it. Our luggage was invariably left about at night without anyone to protect it, and none of it was stolen, and after our journeys in Southern Arabia the atmosphere of security was exceedingly agreeable. Money is scarce in the island, and so are jealousies, and probably the Bedouins of Socotra will remain in their bucolic innocencer i r 992 THE NINETEENTH CENTURY June to the end of time, if no root of bitterness in the shape of modern civilisation is planted amongst them. It is undoubtedly a providential thing for the Socotran that his island is harbourless, that his mountains are not auriferous, and that the modern world is not so keen about dragon’s blood, frankincense and myrrh as the ancients were.
