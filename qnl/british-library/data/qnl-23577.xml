BAHRAIN: 23rd November, 1937., My cook, a Portuguese subject, informs me that when in Bombay en route to Bahrain to work for me here, he was informed at the B.I.S.N.Coy Ltd f s office in Bombay that he must produce a certificate of inoculation in order to proceed to Bahrain. The man was duly onoculated at the Haffkine Institute in Bombay on 28th September, 1937 by a Parsi gentleman who gave him the usual certificate and collected five rupees for same, but did not give a receipt for this fee. I understand from other travellers that when this inoculation is necessary, it is performed free of charge. I infer, therefore, that because my poor cook is illiterate, he was charged this sum, and led to think that the certificate is a receipt for same. Could you therefore very kindly advise me:- i if such inoculation is compulsory, and ii n ' ' ' performed free of charge, and iii to whom I may apply for the return of the five rupees of which my cook appears to have been swindled. rrThanking you, I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully,—X ( No - 12/12 Political Agency, Bahrain,the 12th Decenber 1937.

It Is more than likely that the Parsi doctor demanded far more than the proper fee but any such accusation would obviously bo hotly denied and in the absence of a receipt it could not be proved, t is however open to you to co nunicate with the Director of Haffkine Institute, Bombay, on the subject 1* you sc desire.

A Dear Sir, HARBOUR DUBS - TBUCIh-L COAST We understand from the Ruler of C^atar that he is introducing harbour dues on sailing craft. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie state that such dues have been started recently in SI Hasa. It seems to have been a recognized practice hitherto among Rulers in the Persian Gulf that harbour dues were restricted to launches. It is to be expected that all Rulers will now institute harbour dues on sailing boats not only for the sake of the money but to retaliate for the tax on their own craft in foreign ports. 2. We have asked the Ruler of Qatar to inform us the date the regulation came into force and to send us a copy. Yours faithfully, For &amp; on behalf of LTD.,29th ^.pril, 1938. To The Manager, Petroleum Development (^atar) Ltd. Dear Sir, ^fter compliments - I have brought to the notice of His Excellency the Ruler your observations expressed in your letter dated 23rd April, 1938 with reference to what His Excellency had ordained about collecting harbour dues from (sailing) boat owners. His Excellency has ordered me to confirm to you that the foremost point in his mind is to keep up to the spirit &amp; the meaning of the Concession and to see that nothing constitutes a breach of the conditions therein. His Excellency has similarly confirmed his desire to facilitate all that may prove of mutual interest to both parties in the progress of the work and the comfort of those concerned. He also pointed to the present state of affairs and the circumstances involving these, but he does not see why collection of Harbour Dues from boats coming to Qatar should constitute any breach of the spirit of the Concession in so far as these are collected as Harbour Dues from the boat-owners themselves and this has no connection with what you say. Boats carrying water, etc. to Tekrit are foreign, and have been materially benefitted' through the Company which is v/orking in ^atar at the time when all (lav/s of ) justice &amp; humanity point that this benefit should go to '^atar. Mth reference to this.His Excellency wishes to remind you of the discussion theft we had during your last visit to Dohah when the subject of water was dealt with. H.E. informed you then that it was possible to obtain water/iv Dohah by drilling several ordinary well out of which collectively enough wrater could be procured. But you explained to him that you preferred to import w^ater from outside and His Excellency seeing that this was your wish did not like to raise obstacles in the way as he had the interest of the Company in view and such a high opinion of yourself- &lt; 0 - You had confirmed to him that you would ask the contractor in charge of transport not to use the dhows mentioned. Nevertheless, all the boats that touched here with water, etc. were out of those which you had promised would not come. His Excellency has expressed to you his desire to co-operate with the Oompany and facilitate matters for the material interests of both concerned (by God’s grace) - he does not wish to insist upon what you have confirmed. But it is not just that these boats should be all-owed to go without Harbour Dues as long as they receive more than reasonable charge from the contractor. This is why His Excellency had decided to collect Harbour Dues from them as per our first letter dated 18th April, 1938. His Excellency issued this regulation on 1st April, 1938 to the effect that Rs.5/- are to be collected from each boat carrying water end Rs.2/- on each boat carrying merchandise, equipments, etc. i n these are small. We have as desired by you instructed the official to keep a proper record of the number of the dhow and the name of the Nakhuda. ^nd to reassure you, His Excellency has ordered me to convey to you that on his communications with you about these matters a spirit of gentleness 5c tranquility prevails. The Harbour Dues on the other- hand are known and collected in all countries, not to say that H.E. collects Harbour Dues from water-dhows which formerly used to come to Q^atar carrying water from outside.

Legal Aid to Seamen who get into Difficulties Abroad Sir, I have been considering the difficulties, which are sometimes caused by the fact that consular officers have no authority to make ( advances from public funds to defray the cost of providing legal defence for British seamen, who fall into trouble in foreign ports and are detained by the local authorities. 2. No doubt in some cases your honorary legal adviser will agree to give advice or to make enquiries without charge, and in ( others you may be able to collect the cost of any fee required, locally, from the ship’s agent or by deduction from the seamen’s balance of wages. However, in cases occurring at your post or in your district, where such arrangements cannot be made, and you consider expenditure from government funds is justified, you should report the details briefly by immediate telegram. 3. The only cases, in which the provision of legal assistance from official funds may be contemplated, are those in which you consider that the seaman is likely to suffer from serious hardship owing to the excessive severity of local justice, a strong probability that he has been unjustly charged, or to conditions of imprisonment likely to be detrimental to health. Such assistance will only be considered in cases when the ship owners or the National Union of Seamen are unable to provide legal aid. 4. Your telegram should contain, where possible, the following particulars:— (1) Name, home address, Discharge A No. and port of engagement of seaman. (2) Name and address of relatives or friends who might be willing to assist. (3) Name of ship and port of registry. (4) Particulars of offence of which seaman is accused. His Majesty’s Superintending Consi+tof £&gt;Qicers. [p.t.o. 15525 37°9i —19- HBi mm 2 (5) Estimated cost of expenditure on legal defence for which sanction is sought. (6) Any special circumstances, i.e., if there is reason to believe that the seaman has been unjustly charged or is likely to be excessively penalised, the fact should be mentioned. 5. Cases of citizens of Commonwealth countries or of the Colonies and Protectorates should be referred to the appropriate Commonwealth or Colonial authorities unless the persons concerned are normally resident in the United Kingdom. If there is a Commonwealth representative in the country in which you reside you should consult him in the first instance. You should refer to me only in the case of British seamen who are more closely connected with the United Kingdom than with any other part of the Common- / wealth, persons who, if they were not seamen, would qualify for relief or repatriation in accordance with the regulations for dealing with Distressed British Subjects. 6. In cases where expenditure is authorised, an undertaking to repay should, if possible, be obtained from the seamqn but a copy of your report will be sent to the Ministry of Transport, who will ascertain whether reimbursement can be obtained. 7. Extra copies of this despatch are enclosed for transmission to consular officers under your superintendence. I am.

With reference to the development of a trade in refri gerated cargo from Australian Ports to the Persian Gulf, the Company's Managing Agents, Calcutta, have recently written us • as follows “We have every intention of retaining the “Chupra' and “Canara' on this service. We can quite appreciate the desire of the Oil Companies to have regular arrivals of refrigerated eargo at Persian Gulf ports but our diffi culty here is that even if we arrange loaders starting at regular intervals from Sydney it is quite impossible to guarantee that they will arrive regularly spaced in the Persian Gulf. Not only do we have to face at the present moment unpredictable delays in Australian ports owing to strikes and labour conditions, but we also have to face similar delays in Bombay and Persian Gulf ports. It is therefore very difficult for us to lay down a set programme for the “Chupra' and “Canara“ but you may assure the Oil Companies that we shall do all we can to assist them in this matter. As you know, a new “0“ class vessel has recently come into service, the “Carpentaria', and we expect a further vessel, the “Chandpara', some time next year. Once this vessel joins the service, we will endeavour to release another “C' class vessel for the Persian Gulf in order to assist in this trade.' From this you will see that as far as is possible there will be regular sailings which should do a great deal to encourage this important trade. 6 You will be interested to know that the vessels “Canara' and “Chupra' have 45,000 Cu.ft. of refrigerated space.
