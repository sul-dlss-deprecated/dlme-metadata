A Palestinian Christian from a small town near Jerusalem, he speaks of coming to AUC along with other Palestinian students due to the troubles in their homeland at that time, although he did not require the financial support many of them received from the university. He credits the international diversity of the AUC student body, and coeducation with female students, as proving beneficial to him in his later life and work, as did the academic preparation he received. He also notes the impact of AUCâ€™s Foreign Students Advisory Board in assisting him and others in preparing for study outside Egypt. Askary later worked in Saudi Arabia and then relocated to Florida in the United States where he pursued a career as a financial services executive.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
