The activities of the Bahrain Government during 1362 were mainly confined to ensuring food supplies for the population, direct and indirect co-operation in all matters concerning the prosecution of the war and in carrying on the normal administration of the state in spite of decreases in staff, increases in prices and difficulties in obtaining most things that used to be imported from abroad. The shifting of the scene of war to a sphere more distant from Bahrain did little to alleviate the problem of food supplies. During the year imports of rice ceased and the people were obliged to accept a diet of wheat, flour and barley instead of living upon rice to which they were accustomed. This caused some discontent and grumbling and there was a certain amount of illness aggravated by the change in diet but the improved arrangements which were made by the Government for distributing rationed food throughout the islands resulted in everybody being able to buy rationed food at the controlled price. Cereals, dates and sugar, costing about fifty lakhs of rupees, were bought and imported by the Government and distributed and sold to the people during the year. As the revenue exceeded the budget estimation by a considerable amount the Government was able to bear this large outlay without having to make inroads on the Reserve Fund. Though the cost of rationed food and many other essentials was controlled by the Government the prices of most other commodities, both local and imported, continued to soar. In 1361 Bahrain was suffering from unemployment. In 1362, especially at the end of the year, no able bodied man was unable to obtain work. Owing to the cost of living and the competition between companies and the Services to obtain labour the scale of wages increased and skilled and unskilled men were tempted to leave their permanent employment in order to earn higher wages in temporary posts. In spite of granting a war allowance the Bahrain Government was faced with the prospect of losing many of its employees including clerical staff, teachers and trained police. Many foreign employees preferred to seek high paid war work in their own countries than to serve in Bahrain. For these reasons and owing to the impossibility of carrying out any public works because of the prohibitive cost of building and the lack of materials, expansion in the various departments of the state was severely curtailed. A disturbing factor of the labour position is the effect that it is likely to have upon pearl diving which is Bahrain's only permanent industry apart from oil. Many divers have obtained employment on shore and will probably be unwilling to return to diving. The year brought prosperity to people engaged in many trades and occupations. Pearl brokers had a successful season as the pearl market in India was good. Owners of date gardens made money as the controlled price of dates was high and many people sold their dates in the black market. Speculators in cars made fantastic profits and in spite of the reduced quantity of imports and partial control of prices piece-goods dealers prospered exceedingly. Labourers employed in cutting coral stone and digging and burning gypsum and lime earned over 100 per cent more than they did before the war. Carpenters and masons demanded and obtained very high wages. Owners of houses suitable for lettingand of buildings suitable as store-houses obtained very high rents and in Manama the value of house property and land increased to such an extent that there was what might be described as a land boom. Unfortunately most of this prosperity was temporary and not due to normal causes but owed its origin to war condi ;ions. The ctate of public security continued to be good, no serious crimes occurred though there was an increase in thefts. At the end of the year trouble developed among the labourers of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited and a number of them went out on strike for some days demanding higher wages and various concessions. They were granted an increase in pay which had been approved but not brought into effect before the strike occurred. The ringleaders were loca y educated young men and the idea of going on strike was undoubtedly fostered by the constant reports put out on the wireless about other strikes in various parts of the world. The revenue during 1362 was higher than in any previous year, Customs receipts alone produced almost 14 lakhs and the total revenue collected was 47 lakhs For the year 1363 I have anticipated that the revenue will be 40 lakhs and that the expenditure will be 35 lakhs. It is hoped that at least 5 lakhs will be added to the Reserve Fund but the sum available for adding to the Reserve Fund will depend upon what funds must be kept available for purchases of tooc supplies by the Government. The 1363 budget contains no allocation for import ant new works or for any expansion of the administration, it is a conservative war time budget and provides only for continuing the work of the Government on its present scale. C. DALRYMPLE BELGRAVE, C.B.E., Adviser to the Government of Bahrain. CnJ &lt;x&gt; CO Q p CQ CM CT) CO H11 THE DIVING INDUSTRY. The diving season was a good one. Pearl prices were very high although the catch does not appear to have been a large one. Since the war the markets of Europe and America have been closed but there has been an active demand in India for pearls of all qualities and the prices which were paid in Bombay this year were higher than in 1362. The season was a profitable one for divers, nakhudas and brokers. 1 earl prices in Bahrain were high at the opening of the season, then there was a slight fall followed by a rise which was maintained until the end of the year. In spite of the increasingly heavy cost of provisioning the boats only 6 boats out of the 167 whose accounts were dealt with by the Government diving clerks failed to make a profit. The Government did what was possible to encourage the industry by selling dates and crushed wheat to the nakhudas at controlled prices and by deferring the payment for the first supplies of food until the boats returned after their first trip to the banks. The Government also waived the usual pearling licenses for the year. These various concessions contributed to the success of the season. It is still generally believed, outside Bahrain, that much of the revenue of the state is derived from pearls. No direct revenue is derived from pearls or from divers apart from a negligible sum which is paid for the annual registration of diving boats. No taxes of any kind are levied on pearls us it is the policy of the Government to encourage the industry by allowing it complete freedom from any form of taxation. Indirectly the Government profits by the success of the pearl diving because if the people concerned in the industry make money they spend it in the bazaars and more goods are imported into Bahrain on which the Government collects customs tax. The principal buyers during the season were Messrs. Dhamanmal Isardas. Messrs. Ratanchand Dipchand, Haj \ usuf Mahmood Hussein and Haj Abdurrehman Khunji ; the last two are local merchants who have only recently interested themselves in the pearl trade. All the Bahrain sellers sold profitably but it is thought that about half of the season's catch is still being held by buyers wno anticipate even higher prices next year. The following shows the variation in the prices of different qualities of pearls at the beginnintr and the end of the season i-— b &amp; At the beginning of the season.

Rs. .. 30 25 •• 30 25 .. 30 2012 Divers in the boat which made the biggest profit during the season received Rs. 398, in the second most successful boat each diver earned Rs. 346, but the average earning of a diver was only Rs, 167 and against these amounts must be deducted the loans advanced to the divers before and during the season which amounted to Rs. 88-4. Accordingly the average diver after working for 4i months made a clear profit of Rs. 79, a small sum to compensate him for the rigorous work of the diving season and considerably less than he would have earned if by working in a shore job. In spite of the small reward there are still many thousands of men in Bahrain who are attracted to the diving industry mainly because there is always the possibility of making big money by finding an important pearl. The two largest pearls which were found during the season weighed 150 and 104 chows respectively and in these two boats a diver received Rs. 240 and a puller received Rs. 160. In the year under review 277 diving boats were licensed, about 8,000 divers were employed in the diving fleet and the sum received by divers and nakhudas on account of the pearls which were sold to the shore merchants was approximately Rs. 16,32,000, which is an increase of six lakhs over last season's prices, POLICE AND PUBLIC SECURITY. Strength. At the end of the year the strength of the State Police was 3 officers and 334 N.C.Os and other ranks, the strength of the Special Police was 1 officer and 150 N.C.Os and other ranks, the Natur Forces was 182 men. The total number of armed men was 666. Civilian employees attached to the State Police, including boat crews, gardeners, cooks, etc., amounted to 35. There were 11 deaths in the whole force during the year. Duties. The Special Police were employed entirely at the Oil Field. In addition to their normal duties the State Police maintained twelve outposts and permanent guards including Police Station personnel at Manama, Muharraq and Hedd, prison guards at Jida and mounted patrols centred at Budeya and at Jaw. The Naturs also maintained twelve posts including the garrison of Hawar Island, posts at Sitra. Suk al Khamis and on islands beyond Muharraq and guards on oil installations near Manama and on Muharraq island. In spite of additional night patrols in Manama, which were necessary owing to the serious increase in thieving, the usual daily parades were carried out throughout the year and all men took part in the annual musketry course which was fired on the Safra range. At the end of the year the musketry course was revised and brought into line with the course now used in the British Army, which is shorter than it used to be. Another innovation during the year was the adoption of foot drill in three ranks which has replaced the old style of four ranks. The Machine Gun section fired the usual course. The section which carried off the shooting trophy obtained an average of 71-2 per cent, the average of the whole force was 62*5 per cent. As many men as possible were granted leave during the year but the number of men absent at one time never exceeded 19. Men who had more than two months' leave due to them were allowed to draw leave pay in lieu of any leave over and above two months. As the Police do not draw rations while on leave men who had accumulated leave availed themselves of this concession. A number of policemen obtained their discharge during the year and their places were filled with men transferred from one of the Levy Companies which was being disbanded. Owing to highly paui employment being available in Bahrain for able bodied men very few suitable recruits presented themselves for enlistment and no new recruits were taken on during the year. Uniform and Equipment. A supply of new uniforms and equipment including shorts, shirts, overcoats, blankets, etc., was supplied, on payment, by the military authorities in Iraq. Previous attempts to obtain materials in India had met with small success.13 Rations. The Military authorities in Iraq also supplied the State Police and Special Police with a large proportion of the dry rations which were used including rice. Rice was enjoyed by the Police throughout the year while the civil population were unable to obtain rice. The arrangements for obtaining rations and uniforms were made through the Defence Officer in the Persian Gulf. Monthly rations for State Police and Special Police included the following items :— lbs. 01. Firewood .. 60 0 Rice 22 8 Flour 22 8 Meat 2 4 Ghee 3 12 Mong Dhall 1 14 Gram Dhall 1 14 Onions 1 8 Salt 1 61 Spices mixed 0 6 Soda 0 1 Garlic 0 i Vegetable .. .. .. Costing about 7J annas Police Pay. Owing to the increased cost of living and the high wages obtainable in Bahrain which attracted the Police to leave their service in order to obtain employment elsewhere it became necessary to improve the conditions of service. Until 1362 the basic pay of a Policeman was Rs. 25 per month, after two years' service, provided that he passed the musketry test, he received an allowance of Rs. 3 per month, he also received a clothing allowance of Rs. 3 per month most of which was spent upon replacing items of renewable uniform. In 1362 the basic pay was increased to Rs. 27-8 and all clothing was made a free issue so that the clothing allowance was enjoyed without an}- deductions. An arrangement was made in the case of the Special Police at the Oil Field by which they were given a free return bus pass to Manama once every week. The Naturs, who receive no rations, were granted a war allowance of I2i per cent which increased their pay from Rs. 25 per month to Rs. 28-8 per month. The cost to the State of a Policeman in 1362, including pay, rations and uniforms but not including accommodation, water, lighting, etc., was approximately Rs. 54 per month. Jail. In the past prisoners were housed in a yard in the Fort which contained cells along one of the walls. Long term prisoners only were sent to Jida Island. Prisoners from the Fort were sent to work in various parts of the town in charge of Police. Opportunities existed, and were frequently taken, of escaping and of communicating with friends. The arrangement was unsatisfactory for disciplinary, sanitary and political reasons. During 1362 the new jail in Jida was completed and all prisoners sentenced to a month's imprisonment, or longer, were transferred there. Prisoners attending hospital or serving for less than one month or not sentenced to labour were retained in the Fort. The new jail consists of one large well ventilated barrack room, built against the face of one of the old stone quarries with suitable sanitary arrangements. In addition there is a Police guardroom, a store and a kitchen and on the cliff immediately above the jail a barrack room for the Police from which there is a view over the sea in all directions. The prisoners are employed on stone cutting, cultivating a garden and in building a pier at Budeya which is being constructed of stone from the ruined houses. Crime. There was only a small increase in the total number of cases presented by the Police in the courts but there was an increase of 50 per cent over 1361 in the number of theft cases. Out of 342 thefts which were reported to the Police 162 were not detected, 28 were not investigated and convictions were obtained in 152 cases. Most of the thefts were from shops and houses in Manama or from the Bahrain Petroleum Company. During the year various epidemics of stealing occurred which ceased when persons were convicted and severely punished for the prevalent type of crime. There was an outbreak of bicycle thefts and thefts from cars. Most of the convicted thieves were boys or youths usually with previous convictions. In these cases the Bahrain Court punished the offenders by caning14 them in the market place which proved to be more of a deterrent than sentencing them to well fed and comfortable imprisonment. At the beginning of the year there were many cases of thefts of food and it frequently appeared that the offenders were driven to steal owing to hunger. By the end of the year there was no genuine excuse for able bodied men being without work. The Police in Manama and Muharraq were responsible for catching a number of smugglers engaged in sending sugar and other commodities out of Bahrain. The Police launch was used on patrols around the coasts and on several occasions this resulted in smugglers being captured red handed. In spite of the increase in traffic the percentage of accidents was no higher than it was before. List of Police Prosecutions in The Bahrain Courts 1362. Attempts at thefts Thefts Robbery ..

(Report by Dr. R. H. B. Snow, State Medical Officer.) The question is constantly being fought out in our minds as to how far two peoples, two civilisations, can meet with mutual advantage, the one giving, the other co-operating. Too rigid a vestern standard among a people of alien customs and environment may court indifference or even ridicule. Too much compromise will defeat the ideals which it is desired to maintain. It is necessary therefore to seek a common meeting ground where the best characteristics of both sides will combine to produce the desired result. It is surprising how easily an Arab will adapt himself to the routine discipline of a hospital, knowing himself to be the gainer he will give comparatively little trouble. On the whole Arabs are not difficult to reason with and having made up their minds will endure most things. Some patients come in with the express purpose of being treated over a certain period of time of their own choosing, many of these are Persians who cannot afford to delay their passages back to their own country, others are travellers from the Trucial Coast and even from Muscat. In the winter many come from Saudi Arabia for treatment only and are usually very amenable. Occasion ally patients arrive from the Yemen or from the Hejaz. At certain times of the year, particularly after the pearling season, it is difficult to find room for all incomers. The Isolation hospital usually has a waiting list for V.D. and during early winter endemic dysentery reached such high figures that it was impossible to accommodate all the cases needing treatment. Many had to be sent away. Starvation and its concomitant diseases caused grave concern during the first half of the year. It became noticeable from September 1942, it improved during early 1943, but suddenly worsened from April to June, from then onward the situation was relieved and by November the condition was negligible. Compared to allied conditions down the Coast the number of deaths was extremely small. The whole situation was directly influenced by further imports of foodstuffs and the establishment of food distribution centres. After a time wheat became the staple diet instead of rice, and very soon most people became accustomed to it. An interesting feature this year was the number of nationalities represented by the inmates of the hospital. In the Arab wards there were patients from Bahrain, Persia, Saudi Arabia, the Persian Gulf and India, also one Mongol. In the Services wards people of Great Britain and all the principal colonies were treated, these patients totalled 388, and many contracted the predominating diseases of the Island namely. Malaria and Dysentery. In July and August the two Services wards were overfull with 31 inpatients when the various heat manifestations claimed large numbers. The kindness of the Manager of the Bahrain Oil Company in helping to alleviate this condition by providing air-cooled houses for convalescent purposes, was of great value. 1 he Services wards have proved their value to be well worth the added strain on the resources of the administrative staff. The Matron, Miss Harbottle, was primarily responsible for their maintenance, and for keeping up the constant supply of food, drugs, dressings and general requisites which were continually needed. Without her organising ability the Services scheme, inaugurated here, would not have been possible. We were greatly indebted to the R.A.F. personnel who helped in numerous ways and whose assistance has been much appreciated. The hospital compound was enclosed during the year and building work was completed. In process of time it is hoped that the garden which has been made will improve the appearance of the buildings which were erected at so much cost.16 BAHRAIN GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL.

Attendances continue to rise considerably, being 15,000 more than last year. Schools. The school doctor had to be withdrawn during the hot weather to replace one on leave but 8 out of the 11 schools were visited twice weekly, no more visits could be managed owing to the transport difficulty. It is regrettable that so little can be done at present in this direction because this work is most vital. In-patients. Enough empty beds were never available to deal with all requirements. The Isolation hospital of 14 beds admitted a record number of V.D. and Dysentery cases and the Services wards kept half full on an average and full to over-full during July and August. Epidemics. Smallpox cases were practically non-existent. Chicken-pox and Mumps were evident in small numbers. Typhus was feared, but only one case was diagnosed in May. The nearest places of contact were Kuwait, Basra, and Abadan where the mortality was about 17%. A small epidemic of Typhoid started in the autumn and then died out. This was mainly in Muharraq and Manama. People came very readily for inoculations.17 Venereal Disease. 972 fresh patients were seen and 237 cases of the infectious type were admitted, 113 were Syphilis, and 124 Gonorrhoea, 1819 injections of N.A.B. and Bismuth were given and several thousands of ' 693 Opthalmia. This is our most important work, especially in the schools; 263 patients (22%) were admitted, and 292 operations performed. The total of new cases seen all over Bahrain was 3594, 12-5% of all patients. Trachoma with all its sequelae accounted for 2016 of these cases. Dysentery. Endemic amoebic dysentery showed its usual high figure especially during the fly seasons of early summer and late autumn. This year, however, bacillary dysentery cases were much more numerous and almost an epidemic broke out in November. An added factor appeared to be the change over to the wheat and barley diet. It is thought that a certain amount of gut inflammation was produced lighting up a latent dysentery. Many of the patients were old men suffering also from malnutrition. In Manama 492 cases were seen compared to 234 last year. The people do not yet realise how flies disseminate this disease so a small anti-fly campaign was started in the autumn using fly traps in the hospital, the fort, the markets and the Shaikh's Palace at Rafa. A quarter mile area around the hospital was flycontrolled using phenyle and oil, with exceedingly beneficial results. Malaria. Figures showed a slight increase and were 10-5% over the whole year in Manama compared to 10% in 1942 : and 18% during the worst May—June period compared to 16% in 1942. Only routine work, on which 100 men were employed, was attempted as lack of transport affected the supervision and distribution of oil. Garden channels, house wells and drinking pots proved the most fruitful sources of breeding. About half a million channels and pits were oiled and fish applied and re-applied to eleven thousand wells. The gardens in the Zinj area are now at last under control. A meeting of the General Anti-Malaria Committee, under the chairmanship of Shaikh Mohamed bin Essa, took place at the end of the year. Questions of quinine supply, house well control and concen tration of the work in the towns, were discussed. Present supplies of quinine are sufficient for 1944. but the chief anti-malaria aids were again stressed namely, the co-operation of house owners in making weekly inspections of their own water sources. Malnutritional Complications. This entity was divided into :— Cured. Not cured. Died. 11 Starvation .. Total 37. 16 10 Malnutrition Oedema Total 33. 8 15 10 These figures only represent the male inpatients of one hospital in the Island. Total statistics are not known as there is not yet any registration of births and deaths in Bahrain but in some villages it was reported later that large numbers of persons died of starvation, a case in point was the small village of Dair on Muharraq Island where it was said that over fifty people died within a short period. The treatment of these cases was bafflingly difficult. A terrible apathy predominated, and mental persuasion to will these people to live was exerted. A good mixed diet with milk and stimulants and sometimes Vitamin B only gave very slow results. Those not cured were relieved only for the time being, fortunately most of them were old men. As already mentioned this condition was quickly righted and by the end of the hot weather it had passed away. The Services. Outpatients are now attended to in the camps of the Forces concerned, at Muharraq, Jufair Naval Base, and the Army camp near Awali. Only the more serious cases are now dealt with at the Government Hospital. During the year 388 in-patients were admitted, and 140 of these were in the22 Laboratory and X-ray Statistics. Laboratory.

Doeg, Lady Medical Officer.) The number of in-patients treated this year was 738. The average stay of each patient in hospital was much longer than last year, allowing therefore more thorough treatment, and so the work actually done was greater than would appear from the numbers as compared with those of last year. During the months of Muharram and Ramadhan the number of in-patients was low, while at other times all the beds were occupied, and patients have had to be refused admission.

Many cases of trachoma were found amongst pupils and teachers, and these have received treatment for the condition. is be their Many children in all three schools were suffering from anaemia and carious teeth. Treatment has been given for the anaemia, and the children have been told to get their parents' permission to giver have their bad teeth extracted, but so far this permission has not been forthcoming. All teachers and school children in contact with typhoid cases were inoculated with T.A.B. were was ( due 1 In Manama School 489 new cases were treated and treatment given to old cases twice weekly. Owing to the small number of trained nurses this has had to be done by the assistant lady doctor. In Muharraq 511 new cases and 2,238 treatments of old cases were given, corresponding numbers for Hedd School being 170 and 930. The treatment in Muharraq was being done by a trained nurse under ln ^ medical supervision. The school girls at Raffa attend the clinic and so far no actual inspection in the school itself has been done. Many of the eye and skin conditions amongst the children are due to dirt, and could be avoided if the children could be persuaded to take an interest in the cleanliness of their persons. Something might be done in this direction by offering small prizes such as soap and towels for the best marks for personal cleanliness, etc. The general condition of the children in Muharraq School is much better than that of those in Manama where many are weakly and appear to be underfed. Matron's Report. The trained staff of the Government Hospital decreased during the year to less than half the original number owing to many of the Indian nurses returning to India to join the military forces, the increased pay which was offered by the Government failed to induce the staff to remain in Bahrain. To make up the deficiency more local probationers and domestic staff were employed and their hous' to fir the v beco; Man; chan Man; has 1 mun land their25 usefulness was increased by lectures and by demonstrations on nursing including lessons in English which were given by the Director of Education. Though many probationers showed promise they required more individual attention than could be given to them with the present limited staff. It has been decided to recruit three British Nursing Sisters to take charge of the different departments who will help to train local staff.

During the year over 2,000 articles were made by the hospital sewing woman and over 150 by the hospital tailor. Linen supplies which were obtained before the war are wearing out and much time and work was spent on repairs. In spite of rationing and supply difficulties the food supplied by the hospital has been kept at a high level. One of the chief difficulties was ensuring regular supplies of pure milk as the local sellers invariably try to water it. The work of the Indian dhobis has fallen off to such an extent that it became necessary to consider building a dhobi ghat in the hospital grounds where the washing work could be easily and closely supervised. Pilfering, especially from the women's hospital, continued. Prevention is difficult as it is believed that women visitors are the culprits as they can remove linen and other articles under their clothes. The Service Wards continue to run smoothly and the staff are grateful for the help which is given by the R.A.F. sisters in these wards. LAND REGISTRATION DEPARTMENT. During the year 871 registrations were carried out of which 660 were sales, 53 were gifts, 118 were registration of titles and 25 were auction sales by order of courts. Approximately Rs. 13,000 was collected in fees which exceeded the budgeted amount by Rs. 4,000. This increase was mainly due to the higher value of properties. The total number of registrations was 100 more than in 1,361. Property values during the year continued to rise, this was especially noticeable in the case of house property in Manamah and date gardens. Owing to the influx of foreigners, all desiring to find houses, and the impossibility of erecting new houses because of the lack of building materials, the value of houses of a type suitable for letting has doubled during recent years. Date gardens have become a profitable investment, for the time being, owing to the high cost of dates. Gardens near to Manamah are the most valuable but in some cases gardens far distant from the town have recently changed hands for more than twice the price which was obtained for them two or three years ago. Many local merchants continue to invest the profits which they make in the bazaar in property, this has been seen especially in the case of Persians who obtained Bahrain nationality. The only com munity which never purchases land or house property in the country is the Indian community. A number of barasti dwellings are built upon land owned by the Government for which the land owners pay ground rent, the number of plots leased during the year was 242, the majority of them being in Manamah.'26 A few small pieces of Government land were sold realising Rs. ' ^ ™ ^ fish traps on Government leased a few sites on the coast lor fish traps, n t e pas ^ ^ owni re gi s tration Government property without obtaining permission an t icn c aim Government ensure of existing traps and leases for new sites though not financ.ally profitable for the Govern, that the ownership by the Government of the foreshore is maintained. During the year His Highness appointed a new Khalifah Committee Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa Alkhalifah for dealing with applications y e ' ittee consisting for permission to sell property. These matters in the past were dealt with b^ ^ of Shaikh Abdullah, the Adviser to the Government and Shaikh Salman m s ruler. The new committee in addition to dealing with land sales examines o'her J the Ruling Family including the division of their estates and the contro o vaiioi s who are unfit to look after their own property. JUDICIAL. Bahrain Courts. During the year 596 cases were heard of which ibo cases, 208 were land cases, mainly registrations and 228 were civil suits At he end oftheyear^ 3^ cases were pending. Most of the criminal cases were offences against the food con o g smuggling charges. The total amount of fines inflicted amounted to over Rs. 40.000, most o sum accrued from fines in smuggling cases. No important estate cases were opened during the yea, as the Minors Department dealt with most of the estates which in the past would have been adi tered by the Bahrain Court. There were no cases of any particular interest or importance. During recent years the number of big diving cases has fallen off which is probably due to an improvement in the diving industry, bankruptcies have also decreased and there are fewer civil suits mvo ving large sums of money. It appears that now-a-days more transactions are conducted on a cash asis which reduces the amount of litigation and is a sign that there is more money available in the bazaars. The total amount of court fees collected from all the Bahrain courts was Rs. 6,270, about Rs. 2,000 less than in 1,361. In the Bahrain Small Court 1,264 cases were heard of which 318 were pending at the end of the year. The Sunni and Shia Shara Courts dealt with 363 cases and 62 cases were referred to the Majlis Tijara, most of them from the Small Court. Only two cases were submitted to the Shara Appeal Court and fifteen to the Bahrain Appeal Court. Towards the end of the year one of the three Sunni Qadis retired from the Shara Court on account of age and ill health and was granted a pension. The death occurred of Shaikh Mohoined bin Ali Alkhalifah, one of the magistrates on the Small Court. Shaikh Ali bin Khalifah bin Daij Alkhalifah and Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah bin Ibrahim Alkhalifah were appointed magistrates on the Small Court and Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad Alkhalifah was appointed President of the Majlis Tijarah. MUNICIPALITIES. Manamah Municipality. The revenue in 1362 was Rs. 1,08,600 and the expenditure was Rs. 1,09,400. In the previous year the revenue was Rs. 1,09,000 and the expenditure Rs. 96,000. The main reasons for the increase in expenditure were higher rates of pay owing to war allowances and the substantial rise in prices of all materials used by the municipality such as stone, sand, implements, animal fodder and the upkeep of ageing municipal vehicles. The most important work completed by the municipality during the year was the extension of the sea road from the western end to beyond the Government hospital. The work was started in 1361 and the road was completed and surfaced in 1362. In addition to this work various town roads were resurfaced with a mixture of oil and sand. Progress was also made in filling in some of the unreclaimed areas inside the sea road and a large low lying piece of ground on the south of the town by the side of the Rafaa road was raised by a filling of town rubbish and covered with earth. This area used to contain stagnant water after the rains.27 Great difficulties were encountered over town cleaning during the vear Th.. i 2 r t,y their r**™ Rf i= .hen, w,.l, small walled enelosures built with stone and gulh.irrrmgTn'bl^ Overaoo of these rubbish containers were constructed in different parts of the town.

There were fifteen meetings of the council during the year and rg sub-committees were appointed. The decisions of the council included the writing off of old debts amounting 'j' Muharraq Municipality, including Hedd. The revenue for 1362 was Rs 51 000 and the expenditure was Rs. 52,500. The budget for the year anticipated an income of Rs 46Too aU of which would be spent. Owing to the financial position no major works were embarked on and th! mnmcpahty confined its activities to routine duties. Even the norma! work oTto™ cleaning r^- ng roads and looking after cemeteries, washing places and markets cost considerably more 'than in the past owing to the increase in wages and prices. During recent years Manamah has developed into the commercial centre of Bahrain at the xpense of Muharraq. Trade in Muharraq has declined. When the diving industry was flourishin e Muharraq was the wealthier of the two towns, it contained the houses and places IfZne^aU e important pearl merchants and was the centre of the pearl trade.

The revenue of the Sunni Wakf Department was Rs. 4.000 and that of the Shia Wakf Department was Rs. 37,600. There was some dissatisfaction among the Sunni Ulema against the Qadis who control the wakfs owing to the Qadis refusal to pay in advance the proceeds collected from wakf gardens w ic arc dedicated to the upkeep of mosques and the pay of mosque officials. A petition was prcsen c to the Government by a number of Imams and Muezzins on this subject. It was decided by e Government that the Qadis acted rightly in refusing to advance the salaries out of wakf funds not intended for this purpose. The newly elected Shia Wakf Committee met regularly during the year. Owing to the high price of dates a certain proportion of back debts was recovered from the tenants of wakf property. New leases for date gardens were on a higher scale than in the previous ears. EDUCATION. Government Boys' School. {By Mr. F. J. Wakelin, Director of Education.) School Statistics; School.

The figures below give some indication of the extent to which this has been carried out during the year 1362. Formerly a complete Primary School consisted of six grades. In Shawal (October) a seventh was added and the classes renamed, thus forming three Kindergarten and four Primary grades. ist Term. No. of Boys per class. Max. Min.

In addition to the New Primary School opened in Manama in Shawal, the Village School of Rafa has been converted into a Primary School. There are now five of these primary schools as against three of last year, each following a common syllabus and provided with books for all students in all subjects. In Shawal (October) General Knowledge, Handwork and Drawing were added to the curriculum. Staff. The increase m the number of classes has meant the engagement of ten additional teachers. Most of these were found locally, six being recruited from the Secondary School. It is gratifying to report that these young men compare most favourably with local teachers recruited a few years ago. They lay greater emphasis on understanding than on rote memory and thus produce quicker and better results. Durin g the summer holiday the Director visited Jerusalem and Beirut in search of teaching staff but he was unable to induce anj-one to serve in Bahrain as the salaries in their own countries were so much higher than the Government was willing to pay. Four of the foreign staff left during the year ; two Palestinians and two Syrians. In three cases t e reason was the attraction of better paid jobs in their homeland : the fourth, the Headmaster 0 the Secondary School, resigned because of the ill-health of his wife. There are no suitable local men to replace them. W ^ l Secondary Scho01 - Ther e are three forms in the Secondary School. In October s , a ie beginning of the school year very few boys were admitted from the Primary Schools and r a jr n . Wlt . hln the SeCOndar y Sch001 itself was strictl y 'mited. It was possible, in this way. to e s an ard by one year, the new Form I doing the work of the previous Form II and so on. The primary education of the present Secondary Schoolboys was, through no fault of their ' Very P 001 '' Their kno wledge of Arithmetic did not extend beyond a superficial acquaintance of30 the Four Rules; Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry were unknown to them. They had read three books' in English but could not make use of the language in any way. Their History and Geography were limited to a few useless ' facts 1 that they had committed to memory. It was on this basis that we had to build our present Secondary Education. Arithmetic, Algebra, Geome ry, History Georgraphy and Science have had to be taught from the beginning, all three forms ta ing the same lessons in these subjects. Thus there is the anomaly of primary schoolboys studying books which are used in the higher forms of the Secondary School. In this lies the answer to criticisms of lack of enterprise in not teaching typewriting and other secretarial and commercia subjects So much leeway has to be made up in the subjects noimally taught in the Primary Schools that it is not yet possible to make additions to the syllabus. In a very few years boys in Form I will be more advanced than those in the present Third Form. An indication of the rapid progress in English is that Science and Mathematics are now taught in English in the Second and Third Forms. Another encouraging sign is that Yusif Shirawi, the top bov in Form III last year, was able to enter Class IV of the American University Secondary School at Beirut. The authorities reported that his Arabic and English were good but that his Mathematics were weak. This boy holds the British Council Scholarship. The unexpected loss of the Headmaster and an Assistant Master at the end of the year 1362 reduced the staff to two. At this time of the year it was not possible to find a foreigner, and there are very few Bahrainis qualified to teach in the Secondary School. As a temporary measure the Director is teaching Mathematics, Science and English. The Hostel. The accommodation in the Hostel has been considerably increased. Eight new rooms have been added thus doubling the number of rooms, and the kitchen, bathrooms and latrines completely rebuilt. There are now six dormitories to accommodate 35 boys. Among the new rooms added were a large games room and a library. Boarders are under constant supervision and are expected to take part in keeping the building clean and in good repair. They make their own beds and sweep out the dormitories. Two boys from each of the Village Schools are living in the Hostel attending the Manama Primary Schools. In this way it is hoped to train them as teachers so that in a few years time they may return to their villages as school masters. On 1st Rabi Awal (8th March 1943) His Highness, accompanied by Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa and Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa, visited the Hostel to open the extension. He afterwards visited the Secondary School and gave away the prizes. Village Schools. There are three in number. In all cases the standard is deplorable. We have now overcome the difficulty of over-crowding by adding two or more class rooms to each school. Where formerly 80 to 90 children were sitting on the floor of one room each class now has its own room and the maximum number of boys in a class is restricted to 40. In only three classes out of 15 are there more than 25 in a room. The local staff in the villages can barely read or write and have no conception of teaching or discipline. These are gradually being replaced by teachers from the towns. These men very naturally refuse to live in the villages but transport is provided for them daily. The poverty of the villagers is lamentable. They are undernourished, miserably clad and carry the dirt and disease of years. Four cases of venereal disease were reported during the year, all of them being schoolboys under 14 years of age. To alleviate their hardships every schoolboy is given two loaves of bread daily and during the year they have been issued with two sets of clothing. English Teaching. English is first taught in the second year of the Primary Schools. In classes 2, 3 and 4 Basic English is used and is taught by the Direct Method. This has31 proved remarkably successful. The vocabulary of 850 words has a very extensive range embracing all subjects. The fact that a boy can keep up a continuous, if limited, conversation after six months study provides a great stimulus to further effort. After three years the boy has a command of the whole vocabulary and thus has access to the wide and ever growing library of works in Basic English. On reaching the Secondary School he proceeds from Basic to wider English. Basic English is peculiarly suited to the study of Science and Mathematics as the very economy of words leads to directness and clarity ; all Secondary Schoolboys were made to go through the full course before embarking on the usual syllabus. Medical. Owing to the shortage of medical staff the Schools' Doctor attended the schools for the first three months of the year only. Drugs and first-aid materials have been supplied regularly and were administered by the Headmasters. There is no improvement in the state of the schoolboys' eyes. Daily 25% attend the various dispensaries which necessitates an absence of from one to two hours. Head diseases have been almost entirely eradicated. No boy is allowed to wear a head shawl in the class room unless he is infected. It is now considered a disgrace to sit with the head covered and this has lead to rapid improvement in the cleanliness of heads and ears. Equipment. Considerable difficulty has been experienced in obtaining adequate supplies of stationery and other equipment. The normal source of supply is India, but owing to the restrictions which have been imposed it has been extremely difficult to obtain even the essential minimum. In Muharram a consignment was received from India which had been ordered nearly a year before. Only half of our original requisition was allowed. This stock is running very low. Further material is on order but it is held up until a permit can be obtained to export it from India. Throughout the year the British Council in London and Cairo rendered invaluable assistance by the purchase and despatch of school books and other educational material. British Council Assistance. The assistance given to the Government of Bahrain by the British Council falls under five headings :— (a) An annual grant of £500 towards the salary of the Director of Education. (b) A scholarship of £75 per annum at the American University, Beirut, for a boy chosen from the Secondary School. (c) Books and periodicals to the value of £150 presented to the Public and School Libraries. {d) A grant of £50 for the purchase of an epidiascope which will be sent out from England. {e) The purchase and transporting to Bahrain of school books and other educational material on behalf of the Government. During the past year we have received not less than 4,000 school books in Arabic and English, in addition to 250 Arabic works for the Public Library. Public Library. A Public Library was opened at the end of the year, the money having been provided from the proceeds of the Secondary School play earlier in the year. At present it contains about 250 Arabic and 200 English books. There are, as yet, no facilities for lending books, but arrangements are being made to introduce these in the very near future, when the Library will be open for all Service Personnel as well as Bahrain is. )ls. las The Reading Room is the large north room of the Education Department Offices. From 30 to 40 people make use of it each day ; so far no Europeans have visited it.32 Clubs. There are five clubs for Arabs in Manama and Muharraq. Their activities are not very wide-spread. Each has a meeting room crowded with small tables and chairs where members gather to gossip over tea and cigarettes. In some cases there is a library of sorts and in all a Radio and few indoor games. None could be called a centre of cultural or intellectual development (although some of them do make this claim). Their committee and members are sadly lacking in initiative and drive. In two cases, however, evening classes are held in Arabic, Arithmetic and English. We try as far as possible to encourage this by the provision of books and occasionally paying visits to the classes and giving lessons there. Recently one club in Muharraq entertained a party of R.A.F. men and issued a standing invita tion to any who wish to drop in, an invitation which has been readily accepted by a few. The British Council sends magazines regularly to these clubs, most of them in English but a few in Arabic also. School Plays. As a result of the financial success of the Secondary School play in 1361 each school and club determined to outdo the others by the production of a super-spectacular show. This resulted in a veritable festival when for a period of two months the Public were invited to subscribe, and then to attend a rather dreary play once a week. Certainly large sums of money were collected which were, it was claimed, to be used for such creditable purposes as building club libraries or for clothing the poor. The public were, in the end, a little surfeited and not a little wearied by the seemingly endless stream of ' Blank Tickets.' The most disturbing aspect of the matter was that the activities of the staff and the boys of the schools were directed solely towards the collection of money. No attempt was made to derive any educational experience from the preparation and production. Carpenters and tailors were hired : none of the properties were made by the boys themselves. The expenses were therefore enormous. For these reasons the sale of tickets for school functions has now been prohibited. The Secondary School play produced Rs. 3,400 which was allocated to the Public Library. The proceeds of the Primary School plays—Rs. 2,000 were used to provide clothing for all village schoolboys. Games. A very successful inter-school sports meeting was held on the Fort ground on 15th R/Thani (22nd April 1943). His Highness, accompanied by Shaikhs Abdulla and Mohamed bin Isa, attended and gave away the prizes. The standard of performance was surprisingly high considering that so much time was expended in practising for the ten minutes drill display, that preceded the field events, and in debating who should carry the flag in the march past, that there was no time to train for the events. Football matches are now held more regularly and fewer are scratched by teams anticipating a beating ; but the attitude towards defeat remains unaltered. When asked the result of a match in which his team was beaten 4—2 a boy will reply, ' We scored two goals.' Recruitment by the Oil Company. In the past the management of the Bahrain Petroleum Company rarely recruited from the upper forms of the Government Schools finding that untrained boys with no education make better progress than those with a little schooling who think that they already know all that there is to learn. The requirements on the clerical side being a working knowledge of English, efficiency in the four rules of Arithmetic and a receptive mind. Improved methods of teaching are now having their effect so that a fourth year Primary School boy is now more trainable than a Secondary School boy of a few years ago. It is hoped, in the not too far distant future, to work out a practical scheme for the encourage ment of the recruitment of Bahrain Schoolboys both on the clerical and technical sides.33 During the year 39 boys obtained work with the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Most of these were fr oni the Primary Schools, being boys who had completed only one or two of the four years of the course. The following table gives the details School.

The estimate for 1363 shows a further34 increase from Rs. 150,000 to Rs. 210,000. The additional expenditure has been on staff salaries, books and furniture. In 1362 the average expenditure per boy was Rs. 106-/6 compared with Rs. 87-/8 in 1361. Government Girls' Schools. The work of the Girls' Schools was carried out during most of the year under considerable difficulties. Because they were unable to obtain passages the Syrian teachers failed to arrive in Bahrain until a month after the term had started. The local teachers worked well and did their best although lacking qualifications and in many cases unexperienced in holding senior posts. In addition to this the difficulties in the Manama School were increased by the resignations of the headmistress and her sister about three months after the term had started, the former resigned owing to ill-health, having serious eye trouble, and the second mistress resigned in order to travel with her sister. After the two senior teachers left the local teaching staff carried on the work under the direct supervision of Mrs. Belgrave. There was no change in the curriculum of the schools during the year. Owing to lack of staff various new developments which had been planned were not embarked upon and cookery lessons were suspended owing to the impossibility of obtaining supplies of food. The number of girls attending the schools increased and three new class rooms were built in Manama. About one hundred applicants for admission to the schools were not accepted owing to lack of suitable staff and accommodation. Out of ten girls who graduated by taking their leaving certificates five were taken on as junior teachers. Mrs. Sawaf, Headmistress of the Muharraq School, was appointed Schools Superintendent for Hedd and Rafa. A mild form of physical exercises was practised daily in the Manama and Muharraq Schools. The health of the girls appeared to be better than in the previous year especially in Muharraq, this is probably accounted for by the fact that a large proportion of the Muharraq students are from the Ruling Family or from families of merchants. One of the Government lady doctors or nurses visited the Schools weekly during the year. The annual exhibition of the needlework of the combined schools was held again at the Palace, Manama, by kind permission of His Highness. The standard of work was high and there was much competition to buy those articles which were for sale. The exhibition was attended by men on the first day and ladies on the second day, the crowd was so great on the second day that some people were unable to get inside the rooms. Manama and Muharraq Schools presented plays during the term, the proceeds from the sale of tickets together with a contribution from a private boys' school amounted to over Rs. 2,000 and were expended on clothing for poor students. Monthly cinema performances for the girls' schools were provided during the year by the Public Relations Department which also supplied the Schools with a number of interesting periodicals and pictures. The total number of girls at school at the end of the year was 822 and the number of teachers in the four Schools was 37 of which only two were foreigners. Among the new girls who entered the Manama School at the beginning of the year there was an unusually large proportion of Shia Bahama. The Bahama community in the past has held back from sending girls to the Girls' Schools though they have always sent their boys to the Government Schools. Pupils in the Manama School included Arabs, Bahrana, Sunni and Shia Persians, Indians and Jews, in Rafa and Hedd all the children are Arabs and in Muharraq they are Arabs and Holis, Sunni Arabs of Persian origin. It is a sign of the changed attitude of a section of the community towards female education that a number of daughters of religious leaders are now attending the schools which, when they first started, were vigorously opposed by the students' fathers.35 The Technical School. {By M r. G. E. H utchings, Principal). Students. The number of students in training in the Technical School has varied only slightly since the beginning of the re-organisation in 1360. During the greater part of 1362 the number remained steadily at 55. W hen the scheme was first outlined four years ago a school of some 150 to 200 boys was visualised, but wartime restrictions on building, equipment and staffing have precluded any such expansion. Moreover, an increase in the number of pupils must depend to a great extent on the expansion of the Primary Schools, and although these have in recent years greatly increased the capacity of their junior classes they cannot immediately release a larger number of well qualified boys of the age of 13 or 14. The standard of education and intelligence of boys applying for admission to the Technical School shows gradual improvement each year. The improvement is particularly marked in the case of a group of 21 younger boys, aged 13 to 14. admitted last summer, who now constitute a new reparatory Class.' It is intended that these younger pupils shall carry out a year of general education and elementary workshop practice before entering upon the normal two-year course of trade training. The good progress made by this class suggests that the lower age of admission and the lengthening of the school course to 3 or 4 years should become the regular practice. Popular prejudice tends to impede the recruitment of a satisfactory type of boy for technical training, and this factor also must be reckoned with when the time comes to increase the size of the school. 1 he most able boys in the Primary Schools aim at professional, clerical, or business careers. They regard mechanical trades as the province of their social and intellectual inferiors. Certainly. working-class life in Bahrain provides abundant evidence in support of this view, and there is nothing to suggest that a youth who starts his career in a workshop will ever rise to a position of importance. The facts are so well known to parents and teachers that propaganda in favour of technical education would bs quite futile. At midsummer 5 students from the Mechanical and 4 from the Woodwork Departments, having completed a full course at the School, entered apprenticeship with the Bahrain Petroleum Company A number of others have been accepted by the Company in various minor occupations. Abnormal pressure of work in all the Company's Departments has not favoured the development of a satisfactory apprentice training scheme linked with the work of the Technical School. At the present time ap prentices have only limited opportunities of gaining experience in the highly skilled tasks because equipment and instructors cannot be spared for work which is not rapidly productive. The existence of elaborate training schemes set up in connection with vital war industries in Britain and merica suggests that the Oil Industry has been unfortunate over this important factor in its economy. Four students holding scholarships from the Kuwait Oil Company left the school in June. A fifth member of this group has returned for further study. As in previous years many of the boys eaving the Technical School have entered employment which is not directly related to their school training. This is partly due to the arrest of local industrial development during the war. Certain activities which have recently increased employment generally in Bahrain have not offered such scope lor trainees in skilled trades. The majority of the Technical School pupils live in poor circumstances. Their condition is somewhat relieved by the small maintenance allowance which it has been felt desirable to continue and in addition a proportion of the boys have been given clothing. Boys whose homes are in the distant villages and a few others (11 in all at the end of year) have resided in the Education Depart- ment's Hostel, a very satisfactory arrangement pending the establishment of a boarding house on the echmcal School site. The discipline and welfare of the boys in the School has become largely the concern of one of the Syrian teachers, who is also responsible for organised games. The value of his work is revealed in the pleasant atmosphere of the School and the confidence of the boys.36 Staff. At the end of the second-year 1361-2 the then senior Woodwork Instructor, Bashir Abu Ghazaleh, resigned after 7 years' service. It has not yet been possible to replace him. His colleague in the Woodwork Department is not so well qualified to teach, or to manage the contract work in the shop. A large part of the work in this Department has therefore been undertaken by the Principal. Two other Syrian teachers have remained on the staff, one, previously mentioned, taking a large share in the general organisation and doing much of the class teaching (mechanics, drawing and technical subjects). The other is less versatile, but his work in the Engineering Shop has been satisfactory under the severe limitations imposed on him. The English teacher, a local man, has worked willingly but he is not a skilful teacher, producing rather poor results. Three ' Workman-Instructors' are employed in the shops, and although they do not give regular lessons they are of great assistance in supervising workshop practice. Since the beginning of the school-year 1362-3 (September 1943) the Principal has tutored four senior students who have undertaken a third year of study. The time devoted to this work would have been spent more economically had the class been larger. It may here be noted that in poin of numbers the economic basis of the whole establishment is unsound. The anomaly of the position is that with only 55 pupils, divided into 5 classes of widely varying size and standard, the staff of 5 (including the Principal) is overworked. If the number of pupils were doubled, the classification remaining the same, the work could be carried out very conveniently with a staff of six, thus reducing appreciably the cost of education per head of the need for continuity of the scheme through a period of extraordinary difficulty. Scheme of Training. The principal change in the organisation of the school work has been the institution, as mentioned above, of a ' Preparatory Year ' for boys below the age at which students were formerly entered. Even with the three-year course which this system indicates, it is to be understood that Technical School training cannot be equivalent to full trade apprenticeship where that is possible. Ideally apprenticeship and school training are complementary, the school providing educational background and regulated manual training while the commercial workshop extends the range of trade experience. Without the co-operation of progressive industry the Technical School cannot be of maximum service to the community. Reference has already been made to existing difficulties in the matter of apprenticeship in the oil industry and elsewhere. It is intended to retain the present scheme of school training in anticipation of improved industrial conditions after the war. The cutting off of all supplies of material has still further limited the scope of school workshop practice. Metal-work has survived only by the use of a limited assortment of scrap metal. Some timber purchased before local stocks were exhausted has made it possible to continue woodwork contracts and during the year some good pieces of work have been executed. MINORS' DEPARTMENT. During the year the Department took over the administration of eighteen new estates and dealt in transactions which amounted to over 3^ lakhs of rupees. The assets of one of the estate cases was over one lakh of rupees and in another there were over seventy different leases to be dealt with. Collection of rents from over 450 properties amounted to Rs. 32,000, more than double the sum which was received in 1361. The department continued to lend money to the public, on interest, secured by mortgages of gold or title deeds of property. During the year Rs. 1 ,43,000 was advanced and Rs. 60,000 was repaid. Ten properties were sold during the year. It is the policy of the committee to avoid selling property unless no other course is open but occasionally the income of the estate is insufficient for the necessary upkeep of part of the property. Six houses and six shops were bought by the departmenton account of various estates, more property would have been purchased but the great increase in land values in Manama restricted purchases. A piece of land opposite the Secondary School, under the administration of the department, was used as a site for a large school building which was let to the Government on a long lease. The department also carried out various improvements in the amara of the late Khan Bahadur Abdurrehman Zayani. In this case the estate, which was being administered by a guardian, was handed over to the Minors' Department by orders of His Highness owing to the unsatisfactory conduct of the administrator.

At the end of 1361 experiments were made in various parts of Bahrain to ascertain whether wheat could be grown. The seed which was used was partly Canadian wheat, which had been imported as food and partly Indian wheat seed. It was sown on new ground and also on previously cultivated ground by the Government, by His Highness Shaikh Sulman and members of the public. On the whole the experiment was a failure. In many areas the seed failed to germinate or did not reach maturity, possibly owing to the salt in the ground and where it ripened a great proportion of the grain was taken by birds. Garden owners who planted small areas of wheat found it an expensive and unproductive crop. Owing to lack of early rain no wheat was planted as a rain crop and all of it was grown on irrigated land. In the past some wheat and barley has been grown successfully as a rain crop in certain parts of Bahrain but owing to the uncertain rainfall, which seems to be diminishing each year, there is no certainty of this being a practicable proposition. There is a steady increase in land being put under cultivation. During the year the Government levelled and prepared an area of about 13 acres adjacent to the Palace Garden, on the edge of Manama town, irrigating it from the Palace Garden well. This ground was planted with wheat, which failed to mature and later with date palms and some lucerne. In many districts private owners have extended their gardens and cultivation to the extent of the available water supply and local garden owners are now growing European vegetables in the winter, which is the only season during which European vegetables will grow, and indigenous vegetables in the summer, all of which find a ready sale in the markets. An indication of the increased interest in agriculture is the fact that in the past animal manure from stables could be had in return for its removal, now it can only be obtained by purchase. In the Government garden at Budeya grapes were successfully grown but on a small scale. The vines were imported from Karachi. This has shown that the soil and climate of Bahrain are suitable for grape cultivation. Among the many trees and plants which have been imported during recent years from India and which have now become indigenous a strong bamboo has been found of great use for building purposes, it produces sticks twice a year and requires little attention and is in many ways more useful than date palm sticks. PASSPORT DEPARTMENT. The revenue from passport fees was Rs. 8,800, about Rs. 1,300 less than was collected during the previous year. Since the beginning of the war passport fees have steadily decreased but the duties of the passport department staff are no less than in the past. The extension of airways services has necessitated more inspection work at the landing places. During the year over 250 people who would normally have taken out book passports travelled between Bahrain and India and Iraq ; owing to the book passports not being available about Rs. 1,700 in fees was not collected.38 Over 12 ooo passengers landed in Bahrain during the year ; 10,647 came by launches and dhows, 1,536 in steamers and 435 by air, this does not include service passengers. Particulars of all persons leaving or arriving are registered by the Department. Destitute Persians continued to be landed on the coast from sailing boats which usually succeeded in escaping capture. During the year 41 persons were caught while landing and were sent back to their places of origin. In the summer there was a round up of beggars and a number of them, who had entered Bahrain illegally, were repatriated. Eighteen persons, mostly Persians, became naturalized Bahrain subjects. A large proportion of the leading Persian merchants and shopkeepers have now adopted Bahrain nationality. The condition under which Bahrain nationality is granted includes not less than ten years' residence in the country and the ownership of a house or place of business. FOOD CONTROL. The problem of providing suitable and sufficient food for the people of Bahrain, arranging its distribution and combating profiteering, hoarding and unjustified increases in prices became more difficult during the year under review. Conditions of starvation and malnutrition were apparent, especially in some of the villages, during the last quarter of 1942 ; these conditions seemed to improve early in 1943 but again deteriorated between April and June ; from June till December conditions steadily improved till by the end of the year scarcely any malnutrition cases were being seen in the hospitals. Two reasons contributing towards the improvement were the increased amount of employ ment in Bahrain and more satisfactory arrangements for the sale and distribution of food. During the year rice ceased to be available in. Bahrain as a ration though till the end of the year a little could be bought in the black market at a very high price. Stocks of rice though carefully rationed and augmented by 200 tons which were purchased from Dubai were exhausted by end of October. At the beginning of the year the ration of an adult was 20 lbs. of cereals which included 8 lbs. of rice, the rice ration was reduced in March to 4 lbs. and in September to 2 lbs. In October it ceased altogether. It was found that wheat was the only cereal which could be regarded as a substitute for rice and each reduction in the rice ration was followed by an increase in the wheat ration until eventually wheat entirely superseded rice. The monthly ration of 20 lbs. of cereals was maintained throughout the year. It is not a generous ration in a country where few alternate foods exist; in large households the ration appears to be sufficient but in a family of two or three it is difficult to exist on the ration. Towards the end of the year Bahrain was supplied with some barley which was sold to the public. It was extremely unpopular and quite useless to certain communities as it could only be eaten in the form of flour and many people had neither the means of milling it nor were they able to bake bread. Rationing in Bahrain is complicated by the great difference in the manner of living in the towns and in the villages. The townspeople, especially the foreigners, eat bread, the villagers rarely eat bread and do not possess ovens or bakeries. All communities however eat crushed wheat which can be made into a form of porridge and mixed with date juice or fish or meat when it is available. During the year there was a serious increase in bacillary dysentery. In the Government hospital twice as many cases were seen in 1362 as in 1361. 1 here is no reason to believe that infantile mortality increased very greatly though it is not possible to check the figures as registration of births and deaths has not yet been enforced in Bahrain. I he public ascribed all illnesses entirely to the fact that rice was unobtainable, while this opinion was not justifiable there seems no doubt that the wheat diet was partly responsible for the dysentery by irritating an alimentary canal already latent with this infection and thus exacerbated by the disease. The following shows the cereal ration at the beginning and at the end of the year Muharram (January 1943). Dul Haj (December 1943)- 8 lbs. rice 4 |b s - fl our 6 lbs. flour 4 Js. barley 6 lbs. wheat 12 lh *. wheat 20 lbs. 20 lbs.39 The sugar ration of 4 lbs. per month was reduced in April to 2 lbs. and then increased to 2^ lbs. Here again local custom complicated the matter of rationing. The village communities normally use scarcely any sugar, the non-Arab town communities, especially Persians, use a great deal. It was found that villagers were trading their sugar ration to people employed in smuggling it out of Bahrain, therefore the Government took steps to limit the sale of sugar in village shops. Subsequently an adequate quota of sugar was allotted to Bahrain by the Government of India which was later increased by an additional 25 tons monthly for use as barter. All meat, charcoal, firewood, potatoes, fresh fruit, etc., ear imported into Bahrain from Persia. The Persian nakhudas normally sold their goods in Bahrain and bought other commodities to take back to Persia. After rationing existed they were unable to buy sugar, piece-goods, etc., in Bahrain. It was no longer in their interests to bring meat to Bahrain. In order to ensure the import of these essential necessities the Persian nakhudas were were allowed to purchase sugar and tea in Bahrain equivalent to the value of the meat, firewood, etc., which they imported. The arrangement is working well. Tea and coffee were rationed on 1st Rabi-al-thani (7th April), the ration was 2 and 4 ounces per head per month respectively. This became necessary because owners of tea and coffee hid their stocks and refused to sell. On 1st Shaban (3rd August), rationing of tea and coffee was stopped as sufficient supplies of these commodities reached Bahrain. A monthly quota from India was allowed consisting of 20 tons of tea and 32 tons of coffee and a consignment of coffee arrived from Aden. The Government was again the sole importer of essential foodstuffs such as flour, barley, dates, wheat and sugar but the quotas of tea, coffee and ghee were divided among local pre-war importers of these commodities. Some forty lakhs of rupees were utilised by the Government throughout the year in purchasing supplies for the country. It was fortunate that the State's financial resources were sufficient to provide this capital for buying food to feed the population. Methods of distribution of food supplies inside Bahrain were greatly improved during the year and much was done to simplify rationing methods ; in all these matters the Manamah and the Muharraq municipalities undertook much of the work, such as issuing monthly ration cards in the two towns. Rations were sold from Government owned shops, staffed with Government employees, usually in villages and from approved shops in the towns. In May the number of approved shops was increased and each shop was issued with the same quantities of rations. Each ration card bore the name of the shopkeeper from whom the rations were to be purchased. The quantity of rations issued to each shop corresponded to the number of persons allocated to that shop. Previously any person could buy his rations from any approved shop. The new method proved successful in avoiding congestion and overcrowding and provided opportunities to trade for smaller shopkeepers. In Hedd, the third largest town in Bahrain, on Muharraq island, a new Government shop was built in the compound of the Police Station and was opened in May. Before the shop was opened there were general complaints against the local shopkeepers, mostly Persians, who were accused of hoarding, profiteering and smuggling. After the opening of the Government shop all complaints ceased. To cater adequately for the needs of the villagers, who form about half of the total population, six new Government shops were opened at convenient points where they could supply the needs of surrounding villages. Whenever possible the shops were placed close to police of natur posts so that they could be effectively guarded and the people could be controlled. Places containing a Government shop, a school and police post have developed into centres for the adjoining villages. As the result of an arrangement which was made by the Bahrain Government with a Basrah merchant at the end of the previous year the Bahrain Government bought about 2500 tons of dates from Iraq most of which arrived in Bahrain during 1362. The dates were sold at controlled prices in the Government shops and in authorized shops. The Government set aside sufficient dates to supply the needs of the diving fleet for the 4^ months of the diving season. The dates were sold to the nakhudas at controlled prices and to encourage the industry payment for the first lot was deferred till the boats returned from their first trip to the banks at which time the nakhudas were more easily able to pay for the dates. Crushed wheat was used as a substitute for rice in the diving boats. With wheat and dates arranged for and supplied by the Government the Bahrain diving fleet was better40 provisioned than the fleets of neighbouring states and diving was carried on successfully throughout the season. Dates, date juice and jareesh, which is a species of porridge made of crushed wheat, was the staple diet of many people in Bahrain during the year. If this food, in sufficient quantity, is available in future the people of Bahrain will be able to exist. During the year the Government of India placed an embargo on the export of cotton piece- goods, except under quota. Owing to the small tonnage allocated to Bahrain, the very high prices existing in the market and the usual tendency of merchants to hold back their goods it became neces sary for the Government to take measures to ensure -that people could buy piece-goods at reasonable prices. In July the Government bought from the local merchants one-third of their stocks of certain kinds of cheap cotton materials at 5% above the cost price. These piece-goods were sold by the yard to the public at cost price, the quantity which could be purchased by each person being limited to a certain number of yards. One-third of future imports of piece-goods will be purchased on this basis by the Government for sale to the poor. A very strict control was exercised throughout the year on the export of all types of goods fiom Bahrain. Numerous attempts were made to smuggle sugar, piece-goods and other commodities out of Bahrain as enormous profits were obtainable from this trade. Ihe police and the ( ustoms staff made many arrests during the year and convictions in cases of smuggling and other offences against the food regulations resulted in fines amounting to over Rs. 40,000 being imposed by the Bahrain Court as well as numerous prison sentences. A *' black market ' exists in Bahrain and will continue to exist while rationing and price control is enforced. The people who trade in it are not the people who lodge complaints. Undoubtedly some people sell most of their sugar rations, buying date juice instead and sweet makers and cake makers continue to produce goods for sale which they make from sugar and flour bought in the black market, but as long as the foodstuffs remain in the country little harm is done. After nearly two years of rationing the public tiave become well accustomed to the new way of living. Even in the villages, where the bulk of the population is entirely uneducated, rationing arrange ments are working smoothly. The people cheerfully accept the fact that they have, in many cases, to walk several miles to the Government shop where they buy their food and that nothing can be obtained without paying cash. The people who do grumble, and they are not numerous, are usually the wealthy town merchants who are not the people who suffer most from the present high prices and restrictions.

The Electricity Undertaking has been in operation since May 1930, and failure of supply, due to Power House faults, has been practically nil. There has been no failure of underground distribution feeders or substation equipment. Financial Position. After meeting all charges a surplus of Rs. 56,510-1-9 is shown for the year 1362, which has been carried to ' Operating Reserve. Electricity Charges. Electricity charges were not increased in 1362, but it may be necessary to re-consider the present charges in 1363 owing to the great increase in the cost of material and labour, and general running expenses. Prospect for 1363. Connected load will increase in 1363 as follows A further 50 KW is to be installed at Muharraq Aerodrome principally to deal with the new air conditioning load. A further 50 KW transformer is being installed at the Jufair Naval Base. British Overseas Airways Corporation are adding approximately 20 KW and an extra 25 KW of transformer capacity will be added to Gudhaibia substation to deal with this. A new 200 KVA generating set by ' Mirrlees Bickerton and Day Ltd., England, is on order from England for the Government Power House and it is hoped that it will be available for load during the summer of 1363. The usual domestic load increases in the bazaar and town should add approximately 20 KW. Total new connected load is estimated at approximately 140 KW. Telephones. The number of subscribers connected to date, is 96. The proposed laying of underground mains to assist communication was not carried out, owing to difficulty in obtaining material. The present overhead system is working as satisfactorily as can be expected in the very humid atmosphere of Bahrain. This Department was self-supporting during 1362. The new telephone switchboard, ordered on 12-1-43, has not yet arrived but a spare 20 line is in stock. Appli cations for more connections have been refused owing to the difficulty in obtaining new telephone instruments. Transport Department. The Government Garage carried out the repairing and servicing of all Government vehicles (27). Great difficulty is being experienced in keeping vehicles on the road owing to spare parts not being available locally, or obtainable, as yet, from overseas. The Government of India, however, through the Political Agent, Bahrain, has been of great assistance in the matter of tyres. A ' quota ' was allotted to Bahrain without which Government and essential public vehicles would have come to a standstill. The purchase of these tyres is controlled, they are issued by the State Engineer's Department, essential vehicles being given priority. Fire Section. The Government and Municipal fire engines extinguished eighteen fires during 1362. No major outbreaks occurred. Traffic Section. The State Engineer's Department continued to carry out the registration of all motor vehicles in the State, testing of brakes, lights, etc. (in accordance with the Bahrain Govern ment Motor Vehicle Proclamation of 1357). The licensing and re-licensing of all drivers was also carried out by this Department, 65 drivers being examined during 1362, of whom 49 passed. The number of licenses issued during the year 1362 was 157. The price of car batteries is controlled and they are issued by the State Engineer's Department as in the case of tyres, firstly, to essential vehicles. The number of motor vehicles now in use in the State is approximately 522 including those of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. It is expected that many more will be added.43 Oil Royalty and Government Inspection. All oil produced by the Bahrain Petroleum Company's field in 1943 (1362) amounting to 868,025 • 287 tons was gauged and sampled by the State Engineer's Department. 59 cargoes of refined oil amounting to 421,523-224 tons were sampled, tested and inspected. The State Engineer is responsible for this work and personally carried out all refined oil inspections. The crude oil shipped from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company to Zellaq and Sitra was also gauged and sampled, this amounted to 641,180-233 tons. Records, curves, etc. showing oil produced by the field, used on the Island, and in the Refinery are kept at the State Engineer's Office. From the Curve supplied with this Report it will be seen that revenue from this source showed an increase over 1942 (1361). Financial Position. Oil Gauging Section. The cost of gauging and inspecting all crude oil and refinery products amounted to Rs. 13,100-0-0. Fees paid to the Government by the Bahrain Petroleum Company on account of services rendered by the State Engineer amounted to Rs. 24,600-0-0, leaving a balance on the Credit side of Rs. 11,500-0-0. General. Water Scheme. The Municipal water scheme is held in abeyance owing to the war situation. Until this is carried out, including suitable draining, the breeding of mosquitoes and consequent high percentage of malaria will continue in the Manamah City area. Shaikh Hamad Bridge. Shaikh Hamad Bridge was operated successfully during 1362. Total revenue amounted to Rs. 36,500-0-0. Operating costs, etc. including all charges amounted to Rs. 18,900-0-0, leaving a surplus of Rs. 17,600-0-0. A statement is attached showing Revenue and Expenditure for 1362. Staff. Since the Department was started in 1349 every effort has been made to train Bahrainis in the work of the various sections. The Department has 79 employees of all classes out of which only six are foreigners (British subjects). Shaikh Hamad Bridge. Financial Position, 1362. I. Expenditure. Rs. a.

W. R. Smith, Director of Customs and Port Officer). The revenue collected by the Customs Department from all sources, including boat licences, exceeded last year's revenue by Rs. 4,53,648, and exceeded the amount which was anticipated in the budget by Rs. 7,60 ,111. The higher revenue does not indicate an improvement in trade, or a larger amount of imports, but was due, in the main, to the higher initial costs of the goods imported. A further unforeseen source of revenue was the collection of over one lac of rupees from storage rents accrued from stocks of cereals stored at Bahrain for redistribution to the Arab States in the Persian Gulf. A good illustration of the higher costs of commodities is given in the ' comparison of principal commodities,' where it will be seen that although less flour was imported in 1362 than in 1361, the value of 1362 imports of this commodity was double that of 1361 imports. With regard to piece-goods, although the value of 1362 imports is slightly less than those of 1361, only half the quantity was imported, in 1362, viz., 623 tons as against 1 ,256 tons in 1361. 1362: Actual Receipts, compared with Budget Estimates.

On the 23rd of August, 1943, a local craft laden with a cargo of 402 bags sugar was returning to Manama Pier from the s.s. ' DALGOMA On her way she sprang a leak, and went aground. Boats were despatched to her rescue, and a part of her damaged cargo was saved. The boat was eventually brought on shore and repaired. The Light Tender ' NEARCHUS ' paid her usual visits of inspection to the Harbour Lighting. General. Customs receipts have again been conservatively estimated for the ensuing year, as, under present changing conditions, it is impossible to gauge with any degree of accuracy, what the imports will amount to. GENERAL. Investiture. In December His Highness Shaikh Sulman was invested with the Order of Knight Commander of The Indian Empire by The Hon'ble The Resident in the Persian Gulf, Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., the ceremony took place in the Palace, Manama, and was relayed on the local broad casting system. Presentation of Guns. Two guns which had been captured from the Italians during the North African campaign were presented to His Highness Shaikh Sulman by the Middle East Command. They were placed one on each side of the steps in front of the Manama Palace. Distinguished Visitors. In October Lord Wavell, then Viceroy Designate, passed through Bahrain on his way to India accompanied by Lady Wavell and his staff. A few days later Lord and Lady Linlithgow landed at Bahrain en route for England. On both occasions the visitors were met by His Highness Shaikh Sulman. Their Royal Highnesses the Amirs Khalid and Mahomed sons of His Majesty King Ibn Saud visited Bahrain on their way to and from India and were the guests of His Highness Shaikh Sulman. Customs Directorate. Mr. C. C. L. deGrenier who held the post of Director of Customs since 1925 and was later appointed Food Controller proceeded to the United Kingdom on long leave pending retirement. Mr. G. W. R. Smith, previously of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. Ltd., was appointed Director of Customs and arrived in Bahrain in March. Poor Relief Measures. The Sunni and Shia Poor Relief Committees continued to administer the funds which were collected by them and contributed by the Government for purchasing dates and other food for distribution to the poor both in the towns and in the country villages. I'rom the reports submitted by these committees it appeared that by the end of the year conditions generally were better than at the same time in the previous year, the improvement being due to more employment and better distribution of food. Race Meeting. The first race meeting ever held in Bahrain took place on Muharraq island in November in aid of War Charities. The races caused very great interest and were attended by many thousands of spectators. A substantial sum was realised for war charities. Sunni Kadhis. Shaikh Abdul Latif bin Joder, of Muharraq, one of the three Sunni Qadis retired during the year, owing to age and health. He was granted a pension by the Government. Obituary. The death occurred of Shaikh Mohamed bin Ali AlKhalifah. Shaikh Mohamed had for some years been the President of the Mejlis Tajarah ; before holding this post he was a Magis trate on the Bahrain Small Court.55 BUDGET—1363. REVENUE. The revenue for the budget year is estimated at 40 lacs of rupees, the actual revenue during the previous year was 47 lacs. The expenditure for the budget year is estimated at Rs. 35,30,000, the actual expenditure in the previous year being Rs. 33,29,000. I have anticipated a surplus of revenue over expenditure amounting Rs. 4,70,000, for investment in the Reserve Fund. The total anticipated revenue for the budget year represents a decrease of Rs. 7,00,000 on the actuals for the previous year, 2. Out of the whole estimated revenue of the State, 40 lacs, the sum of 26 J lacs is to be obtained from oil royalty and 8| lacs from customs sources. The third largest source of revenue is now the income from the Reserve Fund which amounts to 2| lacs. 3. Oil royalty has been estimated at slightly less than the actual of 13.62. Customs receipts in 1362 were astonishingly high, they amounted to just under 14 lacs which is more than double the sum which I anticipated in the Budget for 1362. No customs records are available before 1344 but during the last eighteen years the peak year, 1346, produced only ui lacs from customs sources. When I prepared the Budget for 1363 I entertained grave apprehension as to the effect of the war upon customs revenue, it seemed likely that owing to shipping difficulties and various restrictions in trade there would be a diminution in the quantity of imported goods resulting in less duty. The increase in the customs revenue during 1362, which was over 5 lacs more than the previous year's actuals, was due mainly to the rise in the prices of the imported goods and partly to the revenue from food supplies in transit through Bahrain to other Gulf States. In spite of a successful year I have anticipated only 8^ lacs from customs in the budget year. 4. Interest from the Reserve Fund represents 3% on the capital which now amounts to Rs. 91,41,000 face value. Medical Receipts consist mainly of the fees received from the Army, Navy and Royal Air Force for service patients who are admitted to the special wards in the State Hospital. Land Revenue is obtained from registration fees on sales of property and rents from land which is leased out by the Government. There is no land tax in Bahrain of any kind. Education receipts include an annual grant which is made by the British Council, school fees and the proceeds from the sale of work carried out by the Technical School. The last item was not shown separately last year but was credited to Technical School Expenditure. The revenue from motor taxes and driving licenses has been estimated at less than last year owing to the probable decrease in the number of vehicles on the road. Passport receipts have decreased during the war owing to fewer people travelling abroad on book passports. Judicial receipts were unusually high in 1362 owing to the fines which were imposed in cases of smuggling and offences against food control regulations. In estimating considerably less revenue under this heading than in 1362 I have assumed that there will be a decrease in smuggling activities. I have shown receipts from the Government garage as a separate item, these receipts are, in fact, book transactions between the various Government departments and the garage. Oil gauging fees paid by the Bahrain Petroleum Company for gauging, which is done by the State Engineer and the Government gangers, of products exported by the Company in ships which are not owned by the Company. Some reduction in bridge tolls is expected owing to the decreas ing number of vehicles. 5. The summary of the Electric Supply Department's budget has been included with the State Budget. This shows an estimated revenue of Rs. 2,18,000. The revenue includes the interest from the Depreciation Reserve which is invested in the Government of India Securities paying 3%. A surplus of revenue over expenditure amounting to Rs. 2^,000 is expected which will be added to the Operating Reserve which is a provision against future replacement of plant and machinery. 6. In the budget for 1362 a Suspense account of Rs. 7,73.000 was shown which represented the value of the food supplies held by the Government at the end of the year. I have not included this in the budget for 1363 but have shown it in the Summary of Revenue and Expenditure.BUDGET—1363. EXPENDITURE. The estimate for expenditure for the budget year exceeds 35 lacs and is higher than any other year in the history of the State. It exceeds the actual expenditure in the previous year by 2 lacs. Out of the 35 lacs the allowances to the Ruling Family absorb 13 lacs which is more than one third of the whole estimated expenditure. The Budget Surplus is estimated at Rs. 4,70,000, but as the revenue has been based on very conservative lines and more than sufficient has been provided for most of the items of expenditure it may reasonably be hoped that the Surplus will be more than the sum which is shown in the budget. Almost the whole of the expenditure consists of salaries which for the most part are paid to Bahrain subjects living in the country. In past years the expenditure included the provision of large sums for purchases from abroad such as building materials, motor vehicles and for the construction of Shaikh Hamad Bridge. This money went out of the country but the expenditure in the 1363 budget is almost entirely local. The expenditure on State Departments is estimated at Rs. 4,50,000 which is ^ lac more than the actuals of the previous year. Customs expenditure in 1362 was abnormally high as it included certain payments on account of leave, etc., made to the retiring Director of Customs. The cost of the Food Control Department has been shown this year as a separate item, it has expanded considerably since last year owing to the building and opening of new Government shops. In several Departments provision has been made for a full complement of staff which does not at present exist and it is doubtful if the vacancies will be filled during the Budget year. The increased rate of war allowances, which was introduced in the latter part of 1362, higher wages and the normal annual increments have all contributed to the greater cost of administration. The provision of Education exceeds last year's expenditure by over one lac. In all schools, except the Technical School, the number of teachers has increased and one large new school was opened. War Allowances at the present rate were not paid throughout the year 1362 but have been provided for during the whole of 1363. A sum of Rs. 28,000 is allocated for higher education and expansion, this includes fees for boys who may be sent to study abroad during the next school term, provision for two new Kindergarten schools and some additional more qualified teachers for the existing schools. Out of the Rs. 60,000, which is provided for the Technical School Rs. 8,000 is the cost of material which is expected to be recovered by the sale of work. The increased expenditure on Public Health is to a certain extent offset by the anticipated revenue of Rs. 65,000 which is expected to be received in fees. The higher cost is due to the high prices of stores and equipment, war allowances, increments and the cost of food. Defence and Protection now costs the State almost 6| lacs. It has risen steadily since the beginning of the war and is likely to increase. The sum in the budget allows for the scales of pay existing at the end of the year 1362 and no provision has been made for any further increases which may become necessary during 1363. Only Rs. 20,000 has been provided for uniforms and equipment as in 1362 a quantity of new material was purchased by the State. The Special Police, who are paid for entirely by the State, are employed solely on protective duties at the Refinery and oil fields. This expensive responsibility was undertaken by the State when the military authorities decided that it was necessary to employ a Special Police Force to prevent sabotage, etc. Towards the end of 1362 the Police were given a war allowance. Earlier in the year they were granted a concession by which instead of paying for certain items of their uniform from their uniform allowance all uniform was issued and replaced freely and the men were allowed to retain their clothing allowance for themselves. The Special Police were also provided with tickets entitling them to free transport once weekly between Manama and their camp. The cost to the State of the pay and rations of a policeman is now Rs. 51 per month which does not include clothing, housing, etc. The Police receive rations on a generous scale, including rice, and the quantity of cereals per head per month is more than double the quantity of the cereals which is issued to the public. Most of the other items of expenditure in the budget are self explanatory. Out of the sum which is provided for Poor Relief the Government distributes a small quantity of dates to many57 hundreds of poor people daily in Manama and Muharraq and also loaves of bread to the undernourished children in the country schools. The new works which are mentioned under Public Works include a new Women's Dispensary in Muharraq, in place of the present hired house and some additions to the Fort and the Schools. Under State Engineer's Department the expenditure shown against Shaikh Hamad Bridge is Rs. 41,000. The actual expenditure is estimated at Rs. 17,000, annual depreciation is Rs. 8,000 per annum. In 1361 and 1362 no sum was set aside for depreciation. A new account has now been opened into which the annual depreciation on the bridge will be paid and the depreciation for 1361 and 1362 has been included on the expenditure side of the 1363 budget. In 1362 the State sustained a loss of Rs. 56,500 over the sale of food supplies to the public. This was caused by the State selling certain commodities at less than cost price and also by being obliged at times to sell foodstuffs before the costs were ascertained. The sum of Rs. 60,000 has been provided to cover similar eventualities in 1363. In the past Departmental expenses such as stationery, furniture, etc., for all Government Departments were shown in a separate budget heading. In the new budget these expenses have been divided among the Departments concerned. In the Budget for 1362 the amount spent by the Government on the food supplies which it held at the end of the year was shown as a Suspense Account. This year a new account has been opened for Food Supplies on a commercial basis and the amount which had been spent by the Government at the end of 1362 is shown as an advance to that account against purchase of foodstuffs. The sum outstanding at the end of 1362 was approximately 14 lacs, normally this sum would have been added to the Reserve Fund and would have produced an income of Rs. 42,000. In addition the State has provided for a possible loss of Rs. 60,000 by the sale of foodstuffs apart from the cost of administering Food Control.
