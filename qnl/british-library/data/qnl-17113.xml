The Bombay Government is therefore being notified of the 'insult', so that it may be prevented in future.There are two enclosures:1 - Letter from Essai Johannes, Broker at Bushire to Ephraim Gerrish Stannus, dated 27 July 1824. It requests directions on how to respond in future to requests like that from Captain Greene.2 - Letter from Captain H J Green to Messrs Essai Johannes, Broker at Bushire, and Arratoon Malcolm, Linquist at Bushire, dated 27 July 1824. The letter concerns the factory stewards refusal to provide the Captain with breakfast.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054665.0x000013#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
