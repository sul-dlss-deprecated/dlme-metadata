My dear Sir, In continuation of my note of the 30tli of August, I novr do myself tlie honor to submit, for the information of His Excellency the Viceroy, a Memorandum I have drawn up, embodying my views as to the personal concessions and acts of grace that would be most suitable for the Chiefs of Eajputana on the occasion of the forthcoming Imperial Assemblage to be held at Delhi. Believe me. My dear Sir, Yours faithfully, (Sd.) C. K. M. Walter.1/ ^7 V ^7 \x ^ x iNi r 4 4 : ^ \ A m , J ts/li ■ t iV 'v v M tr qJs' fer IX [secre.t &amp; confidential.] \ ^ memorandum by major c. k. m. walter, in temporary charge of the office of agent to the governor general for the states of raj put an a, dated abu, september gin, 1876. Having carefully perused aud consi dered printed papers, viz., a letter (secret and confidential) from His Excellency the Viceroy of the 18th ultimo to the address of the Officiating Agent to the Governor General, with a Memorandum by Lord r Lytton, dated the 11th May last, received under cover of the Private Secretary to the Viceroy's secret and confidential letter, dated the 18th of August, on the subject of the Imperial Assemblage to be held at Delhi, I have the honor to submit the following remarks. * JL ^ ^ 2. The independent Chiefs under the Rajputana Agency are 18 in number, ex- eluding Shahpoorah and Lawa, who re- ^ 4 ceive no salutes, and are as follows :— Meywar receives a salute of Jeypur „ „ If ir&lt; T 1. 2. 3. Jodhpur 4. Boondee 5. Kotah ^ 15. Bikanir 7. Kishengurh 8. Kerowleo 9. Bhurtpur 10. Ulwur 11. Tonk 12. Dholepnr ^ 13. Jaisalmir 14. Sirohi 15. Jhallawar ^ yJG. Doongurpnr y*17. Pertabgurh yas Banswarra 0 / (m A t r / iv*-' 3. The Tonk salute was reduced from 17 to 11 guns in 18G7 on account of the misconduct of the late Xawab. The present Chief received a salute of 17 guns during the visit of His Royal High ness the Prince of 'Wales to Agra, sub ject to general decision hereafter. O . / f. r 'v' k c H l i t /us y* ' I ^ /Uwi i u^u A( 2 ) 4. The salute of the Mabarawul of Banswarra was reduced in August 1869 from 15 to 11 guns for a period of six vears, and the restoration is still deferred. 5. Of the 18 Chiefs above enumerated, to all of whom, except, perhaps, Kotah, I conclude invitations will be issued. I think we may calculate on having present the following:—TJdipur, Jeypur, Jodhpur, Boondee, Bikanir, Kishengurh, Kerowlee, Bhurtpur, Ulwar, Tonk, Dholcpur, J h alia war, or 12 in all. 6. The Maharawul of Jaisalmir suffers from ill-health, and the income of his State is very small. The Bao of Sirohi is too very badly off. I therefore think that they, as well as Doongurpur, Pertabgurh, and Banswarra, might be ex cused attendance, whilst, perhaps, under present circumstances, the Kotah Chief will not be invited, or, if invited, not expected to attend. The Maharaja of Bikanir is engaged to marry a daughter of the Bhooj Chief in the cold weather; the exact time has not yet been fixed, but it may, perhaps, interfere with his attendance.] 7. I may here note that, in case of the Maharawul of Jaisalmir beinff present at the Imperial Assemblage, his place would be much higher than where I have put him, he being of very ancient lineage; but as neither he nor his ancestors have ever attended a Durbar, his position with reference to other Chiefs has not been defined. 8. I have most carefully studied His Excellency the Viceroy's views on the subject of grants of personal concessions, or acts of grace, to the Chiefs and peoples of this country, as described in paragraphs 21 to 25 of His Excellency's Memo randum, in addition to the second portion of marginal remarks opposite paragraphs 16 and 17 of the same.( 3 ) 9. The grants of personal concessions and acts of grace, most acceptable to the Chiefs of Hajputana, would undoubtedly be—an increase to the number of guns allowed them in salute; Ind, the bestowal of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India; and Src/, a diminu tion in the amount of tribute paid to the Government. 10. The remark that nothing touches the heart of a Chief so nearly as guns,' is undeniably true ; and I am perfectly convinced that, on the present auspicious occasion, this mode of grant ing concessions is the very best that can be adopted. 11. I observe that His Excellency the Viceroy, in his Memorandum, paragraph 22, proposes bestowing a salute of 21 guns on Cashmere, Sindia, and Ilolkar; and I would respectfully suggest that a similar compliment be paid to the Maha- rana of TJdipur, as he is undoubtedly en titled to the highest place amongst all Rajput Chiefs, and is held, on account of his ancient lineage, in the greatest esteem by all Hindus. 12. Orders have latelvbeen received t/ from the Foreign Office to invest His Highness with full powers in the ma nagement of his State. He has not yet been installed : perhaps advantage might be taken of the Imperial Assemblage for the performance of this ceremony. 13. Jeypur and Jodhpur come next in Rajputana, and are of equal rank. The salute of the former was . raised from 17 to 19 guns in March 1869: the in crease is, however, only for the present Maharaja's life. His Highness is already a Grand Cross of the Star of India, so that it is difficult to suggest any concession for him, particularly as the amount of his tribute was, in 1871, reduced from Rs. 800,000 to Rs. 400,000; but I think( 4 ) the salute of the present Maharaja of Jodlipur might with propriety be raised from 17 to 19 guns: the honor would he most warmly appreciated hy the Chief, who would thus, and I think justly so &gt; he placed on an equal footing with Jeypur. 14. Next comes the Maharao Rajah of Boondee, who receives a salute of 17 guns. He is the oldest ruling Chief now in Hajputana; his State is well governed; he gives little trouble to the authorities ; and, as Ilead of the Chohans, it would be a graceful compliment to raise his salute from 17 to 19 guns. 15. Bikanir, Kerowlee, and Bhurtpur all receive a salute of 17 guns, and I do not think their position is such as to entitle them to have this salute increased. The first may possibly not be able to attend. For the second (Kerowlee), I would point out that the principal of the loan of two lakhs of rupees granted to the Durbar by Government in 18G8-G9 has been paid off, but interest is still due on the same. I hesi tate to suggest anything in the present financial difficulties of the Government which will cost money; but, if it could be managed, I would recommend that pay ment of the balance of interest now due (the amount could be ascertained from the Einancial Department) might be waived. This concession would be a most grateful one to the small State of Kerowlee. 16. The Maharaja of Bhurtpur has long sighed for the bestowal of the Grand Cross of the Star of India: per haps the gift of this high honor might be considered with reference to him as the acknowledged head of the Jat clan, and the Maharaja of Bikanir, whose ancestors once ruled at Canonj, and who is a junior branch of the Jodhpur Family. 17. Kishengurh, though ranking senior to Bhurtpur, receives a salute of only 15( 5 ) guns. Ever since his accession to the gadi, he has been a most loyal feudatory. I can speak personally of his good con duct in the Mutiny of 1857. His small State is exceedingly well governed; and to raise his salute to 17 guns would be a well deserved, and highly appreciated, compliment. 18. Ulwur, Dholepur, and Jhallawar are all minors, and their States are under the management of British Officers. Each receives a salute of 15 guns, to which I could not recommend an in crease, nor do I know of any particular concession that would be suitable for them. Some special gift, such as a full length portrait of Her Majesty the Queen, might, perhaps, be presented to them as mementoes of the occasion. 19. There only now remains the Nawab of Tonk, and I think advantage might be taken of the occasion to finally restore to him his salute of 17 guns, which was reduced to 11 in December 1867, owing to the misconduct of the late Nawab. It is true that, on the occasion of the visit of His Royal High ness the Prince of Wales to Agra, the Nawab received a salute of 17 guns,' but this was subject to final decision hereafter; and I am not aware of any other concession that could with pro priety be made to the Nawab.
