Dated, Ramadan 18, 1351 1 5 JAN 1933 i?'roni To The Adviser ? Bahrain Government, Bahrain. H. B. M's Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to report that on the night of Friday, January 6, 1933, two Bahrain fishing boats Ismail joliboats; returned to Maiiara^ and separately reported to the Amir and Police that they had been fired on by Persian Bellums on Fisht- Al-Jabrin. One shot had been fired at one of the boats on Wednesday morning and four shots at the other boats on Thursday before midday. A launch with a party of Police and the nakhudas of the fishing boats was sent out on Friday morning. Two Persian bellums, one empty and tae other loaded with sugar, were found anchored on the fisht. The first boat, the larger of the two was boarded and searched but no arms or ammunition were found. The nakhuda of this boat, said when the police arrived, that he knew the cause of their coming was owing to the shooting by the second bellumOn arriving at the small bellum, it was found that sacks of sugar were piled up round the sides with openings like loopholes and two men with rifles were seated in the cover of the sacks. The boat was boarded and the Nakhuda was arrested. He denied having fired any shots. Both nakhudas were brought back to Manamah by the police and a party of police was left on the bellums to bring them to Manamah, which they did on the following day. I, as police officer, investigated the matter and heard the statements of about a dozen witnesses. Eventually the nakhuda of the bellum admitted having fired a shot at the fishing boat on Wednesday but he denied having fired on the second boat on Thursday. The crew of the second fishing boat, whose evidence sounded reliable, all stated that the bellum had followed them, both sailing, for some distance, firing shots at them. The nakhuda of the bellum stated that he fired the one shot on Wednesday in order to make the fisher men bring him fish. This it appears is customary at Huwait but is not done in Bahrain waters and it is not a practice to be encouraged. 1 came to the conelusion that there was no poli tical motive in the shooting and after severely warning the Persian nakhuda I allowed the parties to agree to a compromise which was effected by the Persian nakhuda handinghanding over two bags of sugar to the Bahrain nakhudas. This fisht, part of which is above the sea at low tide is one of the many islands forming part of the Bahrain archipelago, a fact ^ which is universally admitted. On discussing the incident with Jl. Shaikh Hamad it was suggested that the Bahrain Government should erect a stone pillar on the fisht in order that there should be no doubt as to the ownership. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant.Extract from A&gt;iews for the period 1st to 15th January 1933. 20. On the morning of the 6th January two small Bahrain boats made separate reports that they nau been fired on (at different times) by two Tangisi/i balla ms near the Fasht al Jarim. A party of armea police were sent out in a motor launch flying the Bahrain flag. Investigation showed that one of the two Tangisiri ba llams had actually fired on the Bahrain boats. The nakhuda offered the excuse that ne fired as he wished to attract the attention of the boats in order to buy fish (this custom is not altogetner unusual,though not aone in iiaiirain waters). It may be conjectured,though the only eviaence is that the ballam which fired was laden with sugar,that the Tangisiris were smugglers who wished to warn off inauisitive strangers. Eventually a Compromise 1 was permitted,the offending Tangisiri bal lam giving each of the two Bahrain boats a sack of flour as compensation.— Hito it. A portion 01 it is ebove the sea ierei at low tiae ana it lorrns pert of the iifihrain archipelago, it wiii. be seen from the chart tnat it is not far iron the anchorage wnere big snips, auon as some oi tne r.tricK Line,have to anchor onu sailing boats taxe reiuge bemna it from certain wincis 7 so that it my reasonably be considered as covering the entrance to tne naroour* In the circumstances, it seems sounu xor the iiahram Government tovput up unootrusively some icina of navigation marK ana 1 unaerstano tiiet the matter hac been the suoject of discussion between *&gt;elgrave and the ohaiich beiore now. i3ut 1 toid iicigrave tnat,before approving of the 8Ugg98tlon 9 I would enquire wnether you saw any objection to their proposed ? ction.
