                           Centaur, and the recovery of its cargo of indigo by the underwriters of the vessel. Kemball writes to the Government of Bombay, enclosing a letter (no.193 of 1854, folios 221-22) from himself to Colin Campbell, Honourary Secretary General of the Insurance Committee at Calcutta, dated 22 May 1854. In the letter to Campbell, Kemball writes that, at the behest of the Government, he cannot take responsibility for further retrieval of the
                           Centaurâ€™scargo of indigo. To that end, he adds that he wishes to dispose of the indigo he has accumulated to date, and which is currently kept in ill-suited storage facilities in Bushire. Kemball sends the letter addressed to Campbell to the Government in Bombay for prior approval.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x000030#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
