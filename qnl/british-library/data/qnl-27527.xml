Bahrain, normally free from political disturbances, /seems,-p- seems unfortunately to have joined the' ranks of the other Middle Eastern countries where political activity is accompanied by violence and destruction. Che first of the three days set aside in these countries for demonstrations against the partition cf Palestine was only marked here by processions of schoolboys and youths followed by a rabble of women and loafers who marched round the town chanting slogans. A few minor incidents took place, two cars, one belonging to a Jew and one carrying Jews, were stopped, and stones and mud were thrown at them* ,An elderly deaf Jew was beaten up by some unknown persons, and a doctor of the American Mission was stopped by a crowd shouting, 'Down with America, Zionists, Russians and Communists', mud was also thrown at the houses of Jews and some Iraqi Christians, and the windows of ohe Eastern Bank, several of whose staff are Jews, were broken. On the second day, there was a larger procession but no incidents. On the third day, the procession was larger again, and even more highly organised including an open truck used as a rostrum for speakers. It conducted Itself in an orderly way until it reached a.building used as a synagogue where a mass of people with io thrust.into the building. The real organisers of the demonstration then seemed to have disappeared, and one synagogue was looted by the lower and tougher element of the town, many of them non-Bahrainis. Within an hour 12 houses and ohree shops belonging to jews were looted. Che police seemed to have behaved fairly well but found, as is not unusual in dealing with mobs in oriental cities, tnat on suppiessing ae riot in one quarter it broke out in another. Aoout 70 prisoners were taken, but these only represented a fraction of the rioters. It is hardly possible to estimate the amount of damage done, here again, only a sraall^ proportion of the looted proper^ has been recovered. On the evening of the disturbances, a curfew was declared and an Elan pub lished forbidding the meeting cf more than five^persons, No further disturbances have since taken.place. The.instigators of these and of ocher undesirable political activity in rhe island are believed to be a set of young men Hio describe themselves variouslv as the 'National League', 'Popular Front' etc: ordinarily, they confine ‘themselves to pamphleteering and a great deal of talk, but they appear to be qi ick seize advantage of any opportunity to make trouble, and t is feared that their recent success may have cmooldened tnen. The same element, It is reported, have been discussing, ulans to sabotage the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s refinory and other works, but Ibn daub's declaration of policy towards his oil companies has had a good effect, and the..o is now loss talk on these lines. One schemer is said to have proposed letting loose cats soaked in paraffin-oil near the petrol installations.’ The Jewish community is allowing itself to.be mulcted of large sums of 'protection money' paid, invariably by cheque to those who profess, in mosc cases quite falsely, to be le to shield them from further disturbance. The small community of Jews here - there are only a few hundred - have also broad cast their sympathy with the 'Arab Cause'.fi-J i u There have been two heavy showers of rain • a ^ n, one ^ owar( ^ s the end of November and the other in the first week of the period under report. * £BTCES OF ESSENTIAL COMMODITIRS .(Per Kilogramme). .

One of the many amenities to follow in the wake of the Oil company’s institution in this island is the cyclo- styled newspaper (issued free) - ’’The Bahrain Islander” - ’’published fortnightly by and for the employee^ of The Bahrain petroleum Company Limited”. The presentation of news in this publication is, noc unnaturally, somewhat oleaginous, but like all BAPCO activity it no doubt serves the purposes for which it is intended. • The following is a fair sample;- ” MAY - A RECORD NO ^TH. Shipments of oil from Sitra during the month of May climbed beyond all previous records for any single month in the history of 'Bapco”. Thirty seven tankers leaded bulk cargo, two cargo ships loaded drummed products and eigxiteen vessels called at Sitra for bunkers only. The above vessels sailed out of cur busy harbor carry ing a total of 486,657 tons of that 'Unsurpassed” Bapco product. in addition -he wharfs handled incoming freight shipments from U.K. and U.3.A. from six cargo vessels which did not require bunkering; so all in all the Sitra Marine divi sion handled a total of sixty-three ships, -* 1 better than two per day. Captain Georg Anderson -our busy port captain, is justly proud of his spritely Mariners and all of us can be equally proud of each and every Depart ment who co-operated to make such a fine record possible. Every department, division and Individual employee of the Company, regardless of where he was assigned, or his job, contributed and helped make that fine record for May,. 1S47.” 128. SHIPPING.

He has. changed the gate-keeper of his Fort and sleeps in the Fort at night instead of in his private house.
