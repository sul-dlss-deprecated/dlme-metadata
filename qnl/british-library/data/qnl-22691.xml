Captain C.G.Prior, I.A., Political /Agent, Bahrain.&lt;r Copy of a letter No. 947 dated the 16tli September 1929, from Lt. Colonel HoR. P.Dickson, CoIoEo, Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Secretary to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushireo In reply to your No^s 2013 of 2ndo September 1929, I have the honour to furnish you with a list of guests whom Colonel More predecessor entertained during 19 28 and 1929 up to the end of May 1929 when I took over frcm him. This list will give you a good idea of the amount of enter taining the Political Agent has had to do especially in tte cold weathero 2o From a conversation which I had on this very subject with my predecessor just before he left, I gathered that he was always out of pocket where the entertainment of guests was concerned. He pointed out that with the arrival of the motor car, and the opening up of the desert route to Basiah, the stream of visitors official and otherwise from ^raq had increased sixfold, and that the old isolation of Kuwait no longer existed. Lto Colonel More gave it as his opinion that from an 'entertainment of guests' point of view Kuwait should be classed higher than other Agencies in tl^ Gulf and advised me to study the subject and recommend Es 200/- as a suitable figure for Kuwait as soon as I conveniently couldo 3. From the short experience I have had of Kuwait I am inclined to endorse what ray predecessor said. I have only been here 3-^ months but in this period which is the 'dull' season so to speak, I have had to Entertain 32 Officers of His Majesty's Services including 'Iraq Police, to dinner or lunch. 4. I do not of course include in the above numbers the weekly quiet dinner which I give to His Excellency Sheikh Ahmed, and which is of such value in maintaining healthy ^ include the occasional small dinner .of parties which I have madg f point of giving since my arrival— -J to members of the European oomimmlty here, and leading members of Kuwait Arab society• These latter do not cost much for no intoxicating drinks are servedo Still they should be taken into consideration, I think. 5o In arpM j k jWT conclusion and following the advice of my predecessor a man of careful hacits and ox nin© years ex perience of Kuwait, as well as from my own experience, I an of opinion that the Sumptuary Allowance assigned to the Kuwait Political Agency, should, to-day if possible, be increased from the present Rs 100/- p«m«, to Es 200/- # Cer tainly it should not be less than Rs 150/-« Kuwait is in creasing in importance as a Political centre, and it is necessary that we keepj^ pace with the times and recognise that entertainment forms a veiy necessary part of the duties of a Political Officer. This is especially so in the case of a place like Kuwait which possess neither hotels not Rest Houses of any description. £££££££££££££££7 n No. ' -1/15 of 1929. The Political Agency, Bahrain.

Sir, * I have the honoiir to refer to my letter No.973 dated the 15th August 1929, and to enquire whether any decision has been arrived at in the matter# My opinion that a very strong case exists for an increase in the sumptuary allowance attached to this post remains unchanged, and I may mention that in the first eight days after my return from Karachi, I put up eight visitors and twelve in the first fortnight, and as there is no likelihhod of a hotel opening here. Political Agents will continue to have these demands made on them# If it is not too late, I would request that the allowance for this Agency be fixed at Rs.250/- and not 200/- as originally asked for, an amount which will even then compare unfavourably with the allowances at Sistan.

To put uj» a further demand while the other question is under consideration would, Colonel iscco t links, inevitahly delay and coffi^licate the matter, since the two qLuestions are ccnnpcted. oeccndly, much cf the entertaining at the #osts on the Arab coasts have been due to the large number of officers Ci tae Hoyal ir .Force who have visited these places recently. The Bcyal Air r'orce, however, propose to institute rest mm houses fcr tueir owl officers at Muscat, Bahrein and Kuwait shortly and this should xxxxmi:3 result tn the demands put upon the hcs ^ltality cf Pclitioal cffioers 'being considerably reduced. Oclcnel Barrett, who held all three jests before^they were visited as frequently now as they/are^, by officers of the teyal A.ir ^orce ; has express- ect the view that trie Sumptuary allowances are more or less adequate. It seeias jrotoable, therefore, that this will again jrove to be the case when the Royal Air Porce have established rest houses for their own officers. 4. Colonel Biscoe, therefore, would prefer to wait and see the result of the ste_ps taken by the Royal Air .Force before addressing the Grovernment of India. Should these fX#ectations not be realised, he will be in a xauch stronger position to represent the matter if he can state that the result for an increase of Sumptuary Allowance is based on a nonRal state of affairs. At present the proposal would jrcbably be negatived on the ground that it was based on an abnormal situation, which would shortly be rectified.

Since 1930 Bahrain has become the centre of an increasing British, American and Bu rope an population connected with the oil Company including at present 18 married couples. Hot all the wives however are in Bahrain at the moment, m addition the Haval Station of the Persian Gulf Division has recently been transferred to Bahrain* The Agency always has been and is the centre of the social life of the Island, \ and. •.and entertaining by the Political Agent undoubtedly plays a very important part in that lifci and should be considered a very important part of his duties. 4.

A case was prepared in this office for the general revision of the customs compensatory allowance given to officers serving on the Persian side of the Gulf. The line taken was that there had been a very considerable rise in the customs duties and it was shown that tnere had been an average increase of 500^ over the duties in force in 1930 when the allowances were fixed. The Government of India demi-officially suggested that we should show officers in separate categories according to the seniority of their appointments and prepare statements showing how much their expenses had increased ov^irig to the rise in customs duty. As you can imagine this entailed a considerable amount of work as it amounted to preparing family budgets. The Govern ment of India's eventual reply to our case was that they did not see sufficient justification for an increase. This was their official reason; the demi-official reason is contained in confidential demi-official letter No. F.26(13)-S/36, dated the 30th November,, 1937, ♦a copy of which is enclosed. Therefore Sir Trenchard considers that the best line of approach would be for you to prepare a case showing that your financial advantages do not by any means compensate you/- We ightman JSsquire ., ICS., Politica1 Agent, Bahrain.-2- you for the financial outlay that you are called upon to make in entertaining. He suggests that you should prepare a budget in actual figures shovting your financial advantages under Income-tax, customs duty. House rent and Rs.100 enter tainment allowance on the one side and your extra expenditure on entertaining, importing servants, high wages etc, on the other. In practice you now have to entertain on the scale of a Resident. It could ^and should ; also be pointed out to the Grovernment of India that any increase they may feel justified in making would only be of a temporary nature as naturally when the Residency moves over, the Resident would bear the principal burden of entertaining and the Political Agent would be able to carry on on his present allowance of Rs. 100/-. Perhaps you would amend paragraph 4 of your original draft or return the draft as it is with your budget figures and we will do it here.| V • ixternal firtment. - iho 30Iloverabor 1957* 'i £ Inoreru30 in the Custocns Compensa tory Allovanoes of offioem and establi ih- mente eervinK in Iran and the Phr&amp;iaj\ Oalr« Tznypt You will Bee from the official orders which we .ire sending out Biaultaneously that it has not been found poaaible to cuioit the necessity for ftfiy increase in the Cuatouis Gofflponsittory Allowinooa that are now being dram by the officers urn eatabliabments in Iran* 1 give below the main considerations which have weighed in this connection* 2« It has been assumed throut^hout the diocussions on the subject that it is necesamy to increase the Customs Compensatory Allo^iancea of the officera in Iran aa a reault of the rise in the rate of Iranian import dutiea in order to make their pecuniary position equal to that of those serving in India* In making this comparison one important factor in the situation has been entirely overlooked and that is that no officer serving in Iran pays any Income Tax and the value of this concession is very great* A first class iesident in Indiap for inatanoe 9 pays an I no one Vax of at least !t8*!XX)A per i^enaem besides a 3uper T ax of iia*0OO/« to /• 2 • to 900/ m por annum* The officers of lowr39 statua will of course pay aaaller amount a but the toot raraaina that the Inoocmi Tax rates in India have been araaticrdly raised during tiie last few years and now oonatitute a very material reduction in the emolument a which officers senring in India draw^ but it has never been auggeated or claimed that they ahould receive compensation in a^y form for Uie loss they suffer* Officers aerviQB in Persia already receive some compensation for the high cuatoms rates and are better off than any officer servix^ in India since they pay neither Income Tax nor houae rent and get on the whole very liberal allowances* 5* It has also been su&amp;;ested in the correspondence that offioors of the Levantine Consular Service serving in Persia are bettor off than our officers becaoae thoy get a c hi^h cost of living* Bonus* e have no definite information as to how much^onus is but it cannot bo disputed t at our consuls in Iran are on the whole far better paid than tiioae in British .Service* Moreover all cos this the /D.O.No . /2/ The 20th January 1938♦ \ » ' J P any thanks for your demi-official letter No. 97/ 64/14 dated the 14th January 1938 regarding the Bahrain Sumptuary Allowance.

Weightman Esquire, ICS., Political Agent, B ahra in .No. 363-1/16. Political Agency, Bahrain, the 3rd March 1938. JT / From 4 / H. Weightman, Esquire, I.C.3., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Oulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to request you to forward to the Government of India this application for an increase in the Sumptuary Allowance granted to the Political Agent, Bahrain. As I have already laid before you all the facts, and as I believe you are fully satisfied that the present allowance is totally inadequate I venture to hope that you will accord it your strong support and will urge on the 'Jovemment of India the desirability of removing a legitimate grievance under which the Political A^ent, Bahrain, at present labours. 2. This allowance was fixed at Rs, IOC/- more than 30 years ago and until a comparatively short time ago was ade quate for its purpose. In the past two or three years, how ever, it has become increasingly apparent that it is totally inadequate to meet more than a fraction of the cost of the purely official entertainment with which the Political Agent is now burdened. The local European and American population has increased from roughly a dozen persons to a total of over 500, comprising an important commercial community to which, as you know, it is important for a variety of reasons that offi cial hospitality should be liberally extended. At the same time the Naval Base in the uulf has been removed from Henj^m to Ltanamah Island; Bahrain is becoming of ever increasing interest to the Koyal Air Force and the probability of a Hoyal Air Force Base being located on the Island is no longer a/-a secret; finally with Bahrain as a stopping place on the Imperial Airways 1 route, the number of officially-sponsored visitors is on the increase, and indeed includes members of the Royal Family. Though the fact that it has been finally decided in principle to transfer the Political Residency from Bushire to Bahrain is sufficient in itself to demonstrate the new orientation of interests in the Gulf, Bahrain still remains unserved by a circuit house or hotel, the whole bur den of entertainment therefore falling upon the Political Agent* 3* A few figures may be quoted to indicate the increasing charges which the Political Agent is called tlpon to meet. It is on record that the late Political Agent in one winter only provided meals for no less than a thousand guests. Other records which I have seen show that in one year the Political Agent accommodated visitors few, if any, of whom he had met before, at the rote of 166 persons for one day. My own com mitments in my first three months of duty in Bahrain amounted to 83 visitors for one day and in addition 176 local guests to dinner. Actual expenditure on entertainment for the three months of November, December and January only approximated to a total of Hs. 1500/-. These figures do not include hospita lity shown to His Highness the Shaikh and his family and to members of the Arab community and that this is no inconsidera ble factor will be evident from the fact that a single Arab dinner at the Agency on the occasion of the visit of His Hoyal Highness the Amir Saud cost no less than Hs. 230/-. Nor do they take account of the cost of receptions given by the Political Agent on occasions such as Proclamation Day, His Majesty's Birthday and so on. 4. It may perhaps be argued that the expenditure which the Political Agent incurs on entertainment is set off by his freedom from income tax, customs duty and house rent. IA'•3*» I venture to suggest that such an argument could not logically be upheld since It ignores the very nature of a Sumptuary Allowance, Such an allowance bears relation not to the emolu ments which an official receives nor to the incidental advan tages or disadvantages of his position, but solely to the assumed cost of the entertainment which he is required by his position to undertake - a fact which is sufficiently evident irom a glance at the Indian Political Service List. Neverthe less in order to meet a possible argument of this nature I attach to ohis letter a financial statement showing that the benefits so derived are fully counterbalanced by abnormal expenditure in other directions attendant on service in Bahrain 6. A few remarks in regard to this statement may not be out of place. On the 'credit' side I trust it will be appre ciated that I have taken maximum figures. On the 'debit' side ray inclusion of item 4 (cost of sending wife to Europe) may cause comment. I would suggest that it is amply Justified by the climatic condition^ of WTamamah, and that at least it is no more irrational to take account of this item of expendi- ture/than to argue that the benefits derived from freedom from income tax ?nd house rent can properly bo set off against losses caused by obligatory entertainment. 6. I venture to believe that from your ov/n observations in the past two years, together with the figures now supplied, you will be prepared to support a. request for an increase in the Allowance to Hs. 300/- per mensem.

For 10 montha in the year there are no locally ^:rovn vegetables and fruit. Con sumption of tinned vegetables and imported fruit is necessarily lar^e in a climate like Bahrein. At the same time fresh, i.e. local food supplies are generally nore expensive t an in any place I have known in India. ' services' include items such as darzls whose charges are more than a 100^ higher than in India, ^ticles such as furniture, fire -wood and the like are iniinitely core expensive In Bahrein. Iten 3./-are more expensive in Bahrain than in India. Apart from liquor the total benefit is pro bably not more than Rs. 25/- per mensem, Cn liquor the benefit is considerable, but the volume consumed Apart from official en tertainment does not justify an estimated saving of more than Rs. 100/- per ruensom# It must flso be remembered that there are Bahrain Customs charges which the Political Agent can only avoid by direct importation. On all articles purchased from shops in the bazaar the Political Agent pays the f\ill price, which Includes Bahrain Customs. Itom 3. Represents difference between the average monthly cost of current in Bahrain during 1937 and average monthly expenditure incurred over a period of several years in India. Item 4. It is quite impossible for an European woman to spend more than six months in the year in Bahrain, in a house not provided with air conditioning, without incurring unjustifiable risk of illness. Visits to India or places in the Near Kast are of insufficient benefit to counteract the effect of the Bahrain climate and it follows that liiuropoan woman are compelled to go to 'England. The return fare is roughly Rs. 1500/-. In the Political Service in India it is unnecessary for wives to leave their husbands at any time of the year in at least 76 perc ent of Superior Posts, and few posts, if any, involve — purely for the sake of health — more than thr-se months• separation in a hill station. In such cases inevitahla expenditure need not exceed Ks. 2000/-. Thus in India there is a 25 per cent risk of spending Rs. 2000/- per annui on enauring one's wife 's health. In comparison with the 100 per cent risk in Bahrain this sum can be converted into Hs. 500 per annum.

The case of P.A's increase of Sumptuary Allow ance was discussed and the P.A. asked that the draft wMch he had prepared mi^ht be returned to him so that he could represent his case himself and ask P.R. to forw.- rd his letter to Government. Id/- H.W. 14/2/38.D.O. Ko. +^/64/14. dated the 12thl£arch, 1938. Sir Trenchard desires me to say that with reference to the statement attached to your letter No. 363 , dated the 3rd March, he does not agree v.ith item 4 on your debit side, 1.e. the expenses of sending your v.ife home, and when he forwards his recommendations he will have to say so. It may be that the Government of India will think differently. 2. On the other hand he does agree that your entertaining is far larger than would be undertaken by a Political A.gent in India. He suggests, therefore, that you revise your statement entering on the credit side your tU 100 Sumptuary allowance, and on the debit side the average cost of a yea^s entertaining, which you may be able to get from your accounts and those of Loch, who, Sir Trenchard believes, kept careful a ccounts. V. If you can have these ready by the time Sir Trenchard arrives in Bahrain, he will endeavour to get a letter off to the Government of India before he leaves for London. H. Weigr.tman Esquire, ICS., Polit ical Agent, Bahrain.D.O.No. Dated the 16th Karch 1938. Will you please refer to Galloway's demi-official letter No# 464/64/14 dated the 12th I*arch 1938 regarding the Bahrain Sumptuary Allowance. and for this reason I was unable to include actual expendi ture figures for 12 months* entertainment in my statement. All I know is that Hickinbotham told me that even in the hot months entertainment costs more than the allowance. I* can scarcely use this as the basis of an estimated figure| since an estimate necessarily creates the danger that the Govern ment of India may seize on it to delay consideration of the case until I can personally produce figures for a full 12 months.' It is partly for this reason that I have framed my statement in the manner submitted. 3. I realise that you do not agree with Item 4 on the debit side but I hope you will accept my argument that it is no more irrelevant or unworthy of consideration than the whole of the so-called credit side. I feel very strongly that these alleged credits should not be taken into consi deration in fixing the Sumptuary Allowance. Though I do not ask you to omit your comment on this item 4, I do ask you to append it to a remark on the impropriety of admit ting the credit side at all, 4. I most earnestly request you to forward my letter to the Government of India before you go to London since obvious ly I cannot deal with the case myself while you are away, and the prospect of further postponement would, to say the least, be very disturbing. I am afraid Loch's accounts are not on record here, The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, KCIE, CBE, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Yours sincerely,No. 363-1/15. From H. Welghtman, Esquire, I.C.S,, Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to request you to forward to the Goverrunent of India this application for an increase in the Sumptuary Allowance granted to the Political Agent, Bahrain. As I have already laid before you all the facts, and as I believe you are fully satisfied that the present allowance is totally inadequate I venture to hope that you will accord it your strong support and will urge on 'Uie Go vernment of India the desirability of removing a legitimate grievance under which the Political Agent, Bahrain, at present labours. 2. This allowance was fixed at Hs. 100A more than 30 years ago and until a comparatively short time ago was ade quate for its purpose. In the past two or three years, how ever, it has become increasingly apparent that it is totally inadequate to meet more than a fraction of the cost of the purely official entertainment with which the Political Agent is now burdened. The local European and American population has increased from roughly a dozen persons to a total of over 600, c6mprising an important commercial community to which, as you know, it is Important for a variety of reasons that official hospitality should be liberally extended. At the same time the Naval Base in the Gulf has been removed from Henjam to Manamah Island; Bahrain is becoming of ever increasing interest to the Royal Air Force and the probabi lity/-51&gt;p -2- lity of a Royal Air Force Base being located on the Island is no longer a secret; finally with Bahrain as a stopning place on the Imperial Airways* route, the number of offi cially-sponsored visitors is on the increase, and indeed includes members of the Royal Family. Though the fact that it has been finally decided in principle to transfer the Political Residency from Bushire to Bahrain is suffici ent in itself to d emonstrate the new orientation of intere sts in the Oulf, Bahrain still remains unserved by a circuit house or hotel, the whole burden of entertainment th refore falling upon the Political Agent. 3# A few figures may be quoted to indicate the increas ing charges vdiich the Political Agent is called upon to meet. It is on record that the late Political Agent in one winter only provided meals for no less than a thousand gue sts, Other records which I have seen show that in one year the Political Agent accommodated visitors few, if any, of waom he had met before, at the rate of 166 persons for one day . My own commitments in my first three months of duty in Bahrain amounted to 83 visitors for one day and in addi tion 176 local guests to dinner. Actual expenditure on en tertainment for the three months of Novanteer, December end January only approximated to a total of Hs. 1600A. These figures do not include hospitality shown to His Highness the shaikh his family and to members of the Arab community and that this is no inconsiderable factor will be evident from ohe fact that a single Arab dinner at the Agency on the • occasion of the visit of His Hoyal Highness the Amir S^ud cost no less than He. 2 30/-. Nor do they take account of the cost of receptions given by the Political Agent on occa sions such as Proclamation Day, His Majesty^ Birthday andso on. From my own experience and from the Information given in to me by my predecessor I am left/no doubt that for five mon ths in the year the Political Agent* s expenditure on enter tainment amounts to Rs« 500/- a month. For six months it is possible to reduce entertainment to an average cost of He# 250/-5 while for one month the Political Agent may expect to be on recess and thus be relieved of this expenditure. Thus for 12 months the expenditure amounts to Hs. 4000/- against receipts from the Sumptuary Allov.ance of Rs. 1200/-. 4. I venture to believe that from your own observations in the past two years, together with the figures now supplied, a request you will be prepared to support/for an increase in the Allow ance to Hs. 300/- per mensem. You have yourself remarked that in practice the Political Agent is at present required to en tertain on the scale of a Kesident and it will be appreciated that I apply only for a temporary increase in the Sumptuary Allowance, to continue until the Gulf Residency moves to Bah rain, when the Political Resident himself will of course bear the principal burden of entertaining here and the Political Agent will be able to meet the cost of obligatory entertain ment f rom his allowance of Ha* 100/-• 5. Since the scale of entertainment remains constant while this reference is under consideration I venture most earnestly to request that orders may be obtained as expeditiously as possible.

Briefly, owing to the rapid and ejctenaiye deTelopment of Banrain in recent years, indicated in pragraph 2 of Mr.^iight- -nuu^a letter, the Political Agent in the these days is commit- -ted to an entirely abnormal scale of entertaining, which he certainly would not hare to meet in any other Political Agency under the (lovarnment of India. 3ome indication of t he eJt- -psnses he has to incur can be gathered from paragraph 3 of At * /eightraan'a letter. The scale of the Political Agent's entertaining in Bahrain la Indeed cowmen a orate with that of a Resident, but hie sumptuary allowance remains at the r^te fixed - Rs.lOO/- per menaem-when there were some ten Europeans in Bahrain instead of as at present some five hundred. Bahrain is now the centre of the Persian Gulf, and as you are awareit has been decided to move the esid^ncy there frora Buahire, and when this occurs the Kasident will of courae undertake the entertaining at Present borne by the Political Agent.

'Weightman iisq., I.C.S., Political Agent, Bahrain.D.0.No.D,762-E(P)/38. External Affairs Department, Simla, The 30th May 1958. jn ? ^ My dear Fowle, Will you kindly refer to your official letter No.C/155 dated the 23rd March 1938, in which you supported Welghtman's request for an increase in his sumptuary allowance from Rs.100/- to Rs.300/- a month. 2. Although I agree that Weightman must find it necessary to do a good deal more entertaining than was required in 1906, when the sumptoary allowance was fiHed at 100/- per mensem, I am afraid that it is quite out of the question to secure any increase in this sumptuary allowance at the present time. ^s you are aware, the financial outlook in India for 1938-39 is very gloomy, and it is barely a month since all spending Departments were called upon to scrutinise their budget allotments with a view to making all possible reduction in expenditure. This makes it impossible, at the present time to support any proposal involving increased expenditure which is avoidable. Moreover in this particular case it must be noted that while the situation in Bahrain has not materially altered since(Weightman took over charge as Political -kgent last November, his immediate predecessors did not make any complaint. The present situation is only temporary and will presumably terminate with the transfer of the Residency from Bushire to Bahrain. 3. In the circumstances, while I sympathise with Weightman*s difficulties, I am afraid that there is no hope of getting him an increased sumptuary allowance. Yours sincerely, Sd. H.A.F. Metcalfe. .i.Mi AD«0« No* 956-1/15 Dated the 29th Jtaie 1938* t I have received from Galloway the enclosed copy of a demi-official letter No. D # 7aq^B(P) dated the 30th Kay 1938 which arrived recently at Bushire in regard to my claim for an increased Sumptuary Allowance* As it seems evident that the claim has not been examined on its merits | I feel bound to submit the following comments to you* 2« The reasons stated f or inability to secure an increased Sumptuary Allowance are as followss* (i) The gloomy financial outlook makes It Impossible to support increased expenditure which is avoidable ! (li) My immediate predecessors made no complaintsj (iii) The present situation is .only temporary, . 3. On the first point, It is of course entirely true that the expenditure is avoidable, if the Govemnent of India consider it proper for one of their officers to meet from his own pocket expenditure properly chargeable against the Indian Treasury. If that is so, then there is nothing more to be said, but I take leave to doubt if the Government of India would make an official pronouncement to this effect, # (ii) In regard to the second argument it shouldte noted that Prior claimed an increased allowance in 1929 and again in 1930# I see from a note recorded fcy Loch In 1936 that though he regarded an increase as justified he did not propose to raise the question as he apparently anticipated a rapid transfer of the local Reaidaney to Bahrain. Hlcklnbotham left/- / The Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fov/le, KCIB, CBfc) Political Resident in the Persian Gulf*! • « % I left me in no doubt of his view that a serious grievance exist ed, but obviously enough he was not in a position to raise it officially. In any event the actions or omissions of my pre decessors do not and cannot affect the merits of the claim made* (iii) As for the third point, the Political Agent, Bahrain, can scarcely be expected to derive any satisfaction from the knowledge that some successor in years to come will be relieved of this drain on his private pocket. The fact remains that until the Residency does move to Bahrain (and this is still a remote prospect) the Political Agent must, if the Government of India refuse to consider any relief, spend close on £250 per annum from his private pocket in order to meet the cost of official entertainment • 4 # I^y only request is that the application be considered on its merits* I feel sure that the Government of India will not doubt the accuracy of the figures which I have already given, and the only question for decision is whether they are prepared to meet charges incurred on their behalf or require me to do so.

The adoption of a similar principle and its application . in the case of Bahrain would provide a reasonable amount of relief f though it might be reasonable to amend the scale in one particular case, i*e« it will not be necessary to provide for an allowance of £3/- per day for the first seven days of the Political HesidenVs visits to Bahrain, the level rate of £lA remaining. 4# It is possibly a novel way of assisting an officer of the Indian Political Service to meet the cost of obliga tory entertainment, but after all if it is held proper for His Majesty 1 s Navy it need not, I think, be regarded as un suitable for our own Service. I should make it clear that this new 'Seals' should be additional to the existing Sump tuary Allowance, which will continue to aid in meeting the cost of purely local official entertainment. 5.

This expectation, however, has proved to be wrong and I feel compelled now to renew my application for an increased Sumptuary Allowance* 3* I must admit that in dis'mst at my failure to obtain consideration of my earlier application on its merits I decided to abandon the maintenance of meticulous accounts which would show exactly the cost of obligatory entertainment • nevertheless Z am in a position to quote certain facta and figures which I think will be sufficient to prove that In asking that the Sumptuary Allowance for the Political Agent, Bahrain, be increased to Rs*dOO/«* a month 1 did not exaggerate the charges which he is compelled to neet* I have now been in ^hreln almost exactly 3^ years and in that time no loss th^n 1276 Europeans have been entertained to meals at the Agency* This figure, I should explain, excludes guests living in the house and personal friends invited in the common practice of consociation* As 1 stated in ray original application, in my first three months of duty in Bahrain S3 ovamight visitors were accommodated in the A^encyt while from the 1st January1940 up to dat« the total cocma to 76 'gueat-nlghta^ • In tht Interim the annual average has remained fairly conetsnt, the full total being dust over 560# Even after making an unduly generous allowance for coy personal consumptiony my liquor bills alone have exceeded wy Sumptuary Allowance by 33^%* Apart from the frequent visits of the Political Resident| guests at the Agency during «y poriod of office here have included members of the British loyal familyf the mbasaa or from Bagdad, the Vinister from Tehran, Admirals, Air Officers Conmanding in 'Iraq, Bishops and so onj and in order to be able to entertain such guests in an adequate manner I have been compelled to maintain a larger staff here than 1 nave ever needed In India; this alone involving me in extra expenditure of •860/- per annum* Other distinguished visitors to Balirain, who have had to be entertained at the Agency even though they did not stay in the house, have included the I'lng of .laudl Arabia and his Heir-Apparent (the latter vibfak be paying his fourth visit to Bahrain shortly), the Amir Feisal, several laudi Ministers, the •Iraq Foreign Minister, and t&gt;» American inlster in 'Iraq* The viar has had little, if any, effect on the stream of visitors and such small relief as there may have been is fully off-set by the necessity for entertainment in order to promote ¥far charities and similar activities* 4, From the statistics quoted in the oar^in, it *111 ^ be apparent that even on a most Cost of Ilquer conservative estimate my expendl- Cost of additional staff tore on obligatory entertainment 1276 *Beafc»gaests' •••..•.••4is#1276J of European and American guests 660 'overnight -guests' • • • ^•2200 1 alone in 30 months service j.n ^ * Bahrain has amountto close on ai.10,000/-* And to this total jrwst be added the cost of entertainment of Arab notables. I regret that for the reasons stated above I connot quote figures for this, but you ^vil 1 observe that in paragraph 3 of ray letter ondor reference noted that a single Arab dinner at Uie Agency on the occasionof one of th« Amir Saud 1 ^ via its hero coot no looa than fc.230/~, Tho full total therefore «111 not bo short of &amp;«ll|OCX)/« 9 against «hlch I have received as*3 f 000A In Sumptuary Allowance* 6. I may bo permitted to remark that you yourself have had experience of tho burden which official entertainment imposes on the Political Agentf Bahrain; and the present Secretary to the Government of India in tho stomal Affairs Department has also had occasion to observe conditions in Bahrain* X trust therefore that you will be prepared to recommend to the Government of India that even if the necessity fo^ economy in public expenditure renders it necessary to require the rolitioal Agent| Bahrain, to meet a part of the cost of official entertainment from his private purse he should at least be relieved of a reasonable proportion* I venture to auggeat once xaore that an allowance of as*300A per mensem would constitute a reasonable proportion, and I trust that it will be found possible to reimburse me at this rate at least from the date of ny original application, the 3rd Maroh 1938* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, . r-V 1- Political Agent, Bahrain*\\ I No -64/14.

To The Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, Simla. Sir, I have the honour to refer to the correspondence ending with Sir Aubrey Metcalfe's demi-official letter No. D.726-E(P)/38, dated the 30th May 1938 (whicn 1 request may be taken as the record) and to enclose a further letter from the Political Agent at Bahrain. 2. Mr. &lt;Veightman has set out the facts so clearly that there is little to add, and the situation discloses what is little short of a scandal. The Political Agent represents the Government of India in a foreign country and circumstances oblige him to entertain on a scale that bears no relation to similar posts in India. The proposal to enhance his sumptuary allowance in 1958vvas rejected on the ground of grave financial strin b ency, an argument which would carry more weight if the sumptuary allowances attached to the highest posts in India had not been very greatly enhanced since 1906, .vhen the Bahrain allowance was fixed, and if new sumptuary allowances had not been granted by tne Government of India at about this time. Government have benefited by reducing sumptuary allowances at Meshed, where the allowance has been reduced from 2s. 500 per mensem to 2s. 100, owing to a reduction m the amount of enter taining, and they should in equity be ready to increase the allowance* at posts where the entertainment has very greatly i ncreased.■ 76 2 - 3 # sir Aubrey lietcalfe's above mentioned letter contains two misapprehensions. The Tirst is tiiat none oi iir, ./eightman s immediate predecessors made any complaint. 1 complained bitterly in 1929 and 1930, for as an of rices at the bottom of the time scale I found the entertaining a very heavy burden and my applications for an enhanced sumptuary allowance ^ere rejected cy the late oir Hugh Biscoe as he feared that they might prejudice the claim for a customs compensatory allowance which he was then putting up on behalf of the posts on Persian soil. Colonel Loch refrained from putting in a claim as he thought that the transfer of the Residency was imminent, and Captain Hickinbotham would have complained had he been permanently posted to Bahrain, 4, The second misapprehension is that the transfer of the Residency from Bushire to Bahrain would affect a cure. This proposal has been under discussion since 1926 and the transfer is still not in sight. It is clear that whatever i^r is arrived at it cannot affect the issue for at least foua/years and a reduc tion in compulsory entertainment in, say, 1945, will not help the pocket of a Politiccl Agent in 1940. 5. I therefore recommend that the 2s, 400 per mensem saved by the reduction of the sumptuary allowance at Meshed should be taKen into account, and Rs,200 per mensem added to the sumptuary allowance at Bahrain, on the understanding that this increase will be re considered if ana when a transfer of che Residency to Bahrain takes place.
