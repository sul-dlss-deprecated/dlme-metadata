August, 1945. I have been instructed by the Hon'ble the Political Resident to inform Your Highness that an United States Anqy Survey Mission under the command of Lt. Moore of the United States Amy wishes to visit Muscat early in September. This Mission has been working on the Trucial Coast since June taking ground fixtures for the verification of maps made by aerial * photography. Lt. Moore wishes to visit Your highness in Sep tember in order to carry out survey work in Muscat territory and to arrange for hi a party to travel on a line parellol to the coast and 50 miles inland for this purpose. 2. It is not clear from the information so far received whether it is the intention that only the Patinah coast should be surveyed or whether it is desired to survey the whole of the coast line of Muscat territory; but it seems probable that the Survey Mission will wish to undertake latter project. Apart from the transport difficulties which will arise from attempting to travel on a line 50 miles inland from the coast, the proposed operations of the survey party will presumably be impracticable for the same reasons which led to Your Highness to advise against the visit of a locust party to the hinterland this winter. In these circumstances it might fce as well to reply that provided the survey party keep within the coastal areas under Your Ilighnesd control there would be no objection to their activities, but that in the present circumstances it is not possible for them to operate in Oman. This is of-courae subject to Your Highness seeing no objection to a survey of your territories being car ried out. 3. I shall be grateful if Your Highness will kindly le t me know as early as possible the reply you wish me to send to the Hon'ble the Political Resident. f)e N His Highness Saiyid Said tin Taimur,- ~ r oiir.

August 1945 we wish to inform you that, while we have no objec- .. tion to Lt. Moore visiting us in Muscat and permit him to under take survey work in the coastal areas as we shall explain to him, we feel it necessary to point out that such facilities must now be treated on a peace time basis for which negotiations may be conducted in the usual manner. We shall expect to receive an approach from our friend the U. S. A. Government. We wish to make it clear in conclusion that it will be impossible for the party to travel at a distance of 50 miles from the coast at present. Mr. R. I.

AMERICAN CONSULATE Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, November 13, 1946 From Parker T. Hart, American Consul To Sheikh Sulaiman bin Humayer A1 Nabhani, Tenoof, Jebel Akhdhar, Oman. Greetings and best wishes. I was most happy to receive your friendly letter of July 24, 1946, transmitted by the hand of our good friend Dr.W.Welles Thoms, and I reciprocate heartily your cordial greetings and those of your sons Sultan and Humayer. As I am now departing from Dhahran for the United States I am delivering my reply to my successor Consul Waldo E.Bailey, who will forward it to you through His Highness Said bin Taimur, Sultan of Muscat and Oman. It is a pleasure and an honour to have news of you through Dr.Thoms and to learn that you have ex tended to him such gracious hospitality and assistance. For this, Consul Bailey joins me in expressing deepest thanks. May the friendly relations between Arabs and Americans continue to be a factor for stability and peace. God keep you and your family welland happy, and give you long life. Sd. Parker T. Hartv,. £) British Middle East Office, Cairo 5th February, 1947 SECRET Dear Hay, This is in reply to your D.0.NO.95-S of the 15th January about Mr. Sullivan. He is on the diplomatic list here and is described as 'Attache Adjoint (Questions Petrolieres)', his appointment dating from April, 1946. I gather that in normal life he was an accounts clerk, or something of the kind, in one of the American oil companies and after the war was appointed as assistant to the then American Oil Attache, a senior man by the name of Pagett. Pagett has since faded out but Sullivan has stayed on. The general impression 1 gather is that he is carving out a job for himself by asking a lot of questions from anybody he can get hold of, compiling statistics and, to be frank, making a general nuisance of himslagf. It would be unwise to trust him too far but, on the other hand, there is no reason to suppose that he is visions or harmful. He is a hail-fellow- well-met type of man who goes in a good deal for social functions. On the whole, I should say tnat he should be treated with a certain amount of reserve but handled tactfully. Yours sincerely, (Signed) A. Overton Colonel W.R. Hay, Political Resident, Persian Gulf. ' PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN, the 15th January, 1947 SECny; P,tPtN&amp;t£5=£ My dear Sir Arnold, On the 11th January I received a call from Childs, the American Minister at Jeddah. He brought with him one Don. J. Sullivan who described hirasfcef as the American Oil Attache for the Middle East, and asked me a number of pertinent questions about oil matters In the Gulf. He stated his intention of returning here shortly when he hopes to Interview Packer, the local Petroleum Concessions Limited Manager, and also to visit the Trucial Coast and find out what Petroleum Concessions Limited are doing there. 2. I should be grateful for anything you can let me know about Sullivan. I gather he made himself rather unpopular with the American Manager of the BAPCO here and I think we may find him a bit of a nuisance. As however he was introduced to me by Childs I propose to give such assistance in the way of travel facilities as is possible and any information about oil developments which is not of a highly confidential nature. Yours sincerely, (Signed) W. F. Hay. Sir Arnold Overton, K.C.B., K.C.M.G., M.C.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000375_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/174</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000375</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/174</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 6/34 Foreign Interests: American Interests in the Persian Gulf'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1945/1947</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-05-30T22:50:36</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (19 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 21; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
