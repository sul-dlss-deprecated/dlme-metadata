HIS Majesty’s representative presents his compliments to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Ahwaz on the subject of inauguration of service of navigation between Italy and the Persian Gulf by the Lloyd Triestino Company. Tehran. March 5, 1934. Enclosure in No. 1. Consul Watkinson to Sir R. Hoare. (No. 14.) Sir, Ahwaz, February 23, 1934. WITH reference to your despatch No. 5, enclosing copy of a despatch, dated the 31st January, to the Foreign Office regarding the inauguration of a service of navigation between Italy and the Persian Gulf by the Lloyd Triestino Company, I have the honour to report that the steamship Fenicia arrived at Bandar Shahpur on the 24th January, and called at Mohammerah a fevr days later. The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation (Limited), who were already forwarding agents for the Italian shipping combine, have been appointed agents for all the Gulf ports. 2. According to the manager of the Ahwaz agency, this vessel was a small tramp steamer of about 2,500 tons, with accommodation for a few passengers. She had never been east of Suez before, and was unprovided with ice. Before arrival at Bandar Shahpur all their food supplies had -gone bad, and it was with difficulty that sufficient was obtained to last until they reached Basra. From information given in Port Said it was imagined that Bandar Shahpur was a flourishing township, with all necessary provisions and facilities. The manager I of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation (Limited) was very unfavourably 1 impressed with this ship. ^ 3. Mr. Spence tells me that he sees no prospect of a freight war with the British India Steam Navigation Company for general Persian Gulf business, as the companies operate from bases situated in different parts of the world. There was already an arrangement in force between the Peninsula and Oriental, the British India and the Lloyd Triestino as regards Indian traffic and transhipments for the Persian Gulf, but the amount of cargo transhipped in Bombay from Italian vessels was negligible. So far as he knows, the present Lloyd Triestino Gulf service is not intending to call at Indian ports on either the outward or the return journey, and so does not compete for Indian trade. 4. The real struggle is between the Italian line and the German Hansa line, which are in competition for transport of railway material and other Persian Government stores delivered at Bandar Shahpur. The latter has already recently obtained the contract for transport of 25,000 tons of machinery for sugar factories purchased from the Skodawerke and shipped from Hamburg. Mr. Spence was recently in Trieste, where he was informed by M. Cosulich, one of the principal directors of the Italian shipping combine, that only the question of transhipment at Port Said or Bombay prevented such orders from benefiting Italian shipping. 5. Hitherto, so far as I am aware, all military stores landed at Bandar Shahpur have been shipped by German vessels, including the British aeroplanes supplied by the De Havilland and by the Hawker Aircraft Companies, which were delivered on board in English ports.

Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received March 14.) (No. 93.) Sir, Tehran, February 22, 1934. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 26 of the 11th January, instructing me to submit my observations upon the new Lloyd- Triestino steamship service to the Persian Gulf. I have also received your despatch No. 74 of the 8th February, transmitting the views of the Political Resident, and a copy of Sir Francis Humphrys’s despatch No. O.T. (A) 4 of the 5th February upon the same subject. 2. The information which I have been able to gather about the new venture in Tehran confirms that contained in Sir Francis Humphrys’s despatch. The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation are acting as agents for the Lloyd-Triestino, and Mr. Spence, the corporation’s representative at Ahwaz, went to Bander Shahpur to meet the Fenicia on her arrival (see my despatch No. 43 of the 31st January). In view of the close relations existing between the corporation and the British India Steam Navigation Company, I presume that the corpora tion would hardly act in this capacity without the approval of the steamship company. It may even be that some understanding exists between the British India and Lloyd-Triestino companies, as the former are, I am told, more worried at present by the competition of the Hansa Line, who are quoting rates to European ports 50 per cent, lower than the British rates, rather than by the prospective competition of the Lloyd-Triestino. 3. I am not aware whether much cargo is ordinarily carried by Lloyd- Triestino steamers to Bombay and thence trans-shipped to British India steamers for conveyance to ports in the Persian Gulf. If so this freight will be lost now that there are through steamers from Italy to the Gulf. But it seems to me more likely that most of the cargoes will consist of freight which would otherwise have been carried, possibly by Strick Line steamers, from ports on the North Sea. In any case the present programme, one round voyage in two months, is not very formidable, though it will doubtless be expanded if it proves a success. 4. The immediate reason for the institution of this service has doubtless been the contracts obtained by Italian firms during the last year for the construc tion of various sections of the Trans-Persian Railway. I need hardly say that the account of these contracts given in the Sole of the 13th December last (see Rome despatch No. O.T. (A) 176 of the 14th December, 1933) is greatly exaggerated. The contracts do not cover the whole railway, in fact they probably cover less than 10 per cent, of the total line to be constructed, and they do not extend to any works not directly connected with the railway. Nevertheless, they are in themselves of substantial value; they have led to the introduction of many hundreds of Italian artisans and workmen, and they doubtless have led, and will lead, to extensive importations of Italian material and machinery. 5. These cargoes, even with the cement trade to Iraq, may not be sufficient to render the new service profitable in the absence of subsidies from the Italian Government, but they are possibly sufficient to provide a commercial motive for the activities of that Government. I find it hard to believe that the Italian Government can have political aims in Persia in the sense of harbouring designs upon Persian territory or of wishing, or still less expecting, to acquire such a dominating position in the counsels of the Persian Government as will ensure them the support of Persia in major international affairs. I am equally sceptical about their aims in Iraq and in the Arab States of the Gulf so long, at any rate, as these are clearly marked as British preserves, although I realise that undue activity on the part of Italy in these States might force His Majesty’s Government into the uncomfortable position of having to announce open protectorates. [65 o—3] March 14, 1934r\ J i &amp;C o Section 3.6. The aims of the Italian Government in all these countries is, I surmise, to find new outlets for Italian trade and new spheres of employment for Italian subjects. To achieve these aims they will use every art and artifice to penetrate new markets, to secure concessions and contracts and to place Italians in Govern ment or private employ, and the exercise of these arts and artifices may sometimes be indistinguishable from political activities. In any case, the extension of Italian interests in Persia, if at the expense of important British interests, is certainly most deplorable, though not more deplorable than the extension of Japanese or German interests, and doubly deplorable when it is secured by unfair competition, such as shipping subsidies. This last question is, as the Political Resident has pointed out, one that cannot be treated locally. For the rest I can only suggest that if the competition to British shipping is serious even without the subsidy (and there appears to be some grounds for doubting whether it would prove so), and if it is necessary to maintain the British India service on political grounds (for His Majesty’s Government, unlike the Italian Government, have political interests in Persia), a system of subsidies must be instituted irrespective of what the Italian or other Governments may or may not do. 7. I am sending copies of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade (No. O.T.

Unless some agreement between the British India Steam Navigation Com pany and the Lloyd Triestino has been, or is, reached, the former company will be faced with the prospect of a freight war for Persian Gulf business'. I shall report further details as they come to hand, and in the meantime the attached copy of an extract from a circular addressed by an Italian firm established in Trieste to Persian firms may be of interest^ 1 2 3 4 ) 3.

Foreign Shipping in the Gulf* Competition with British shipping in the Gulf is at present confined to the Hansa Line (Germany) and to a few Russian and Japanese ships. Very shortly, however, according to a press message, Italy is to he represented in these waters by a regular monthly service of the Lloyd Triestino Line which will presumably be supported by a Government subsidy and will thus be able to offer lower cargo rates. There is already a marked absence of British goods in the Gulf. Provided that foreigi goods are delivered by British shipping the situation has some compensating feature, but if subsidised foreign shipping has to be competed against as well as trade, this advantage will be reduced. As an example, at Bahrain, a few days ago, S.S. 'WOLFSBERG' of the Hansa line delivered about 240 tons of machinery (almost entirely for the Bahrain Petroleum Co.) and a large quantity of Belgian sugar.2r ^ — Original by Bag .

Sir I have the honour to inform you that, at the end of January, a Lloyd Triestino cargo vessel called at Basrah with a cargo of Italian cement Mr. Walter Denso, a representative of the Lloyd Triestino, is visiting Iraq from Bombay to make arrangements for a regular service between Trieste and Basrah. It is understood that the agents in Iraq will be the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, who are the local agents for the Peninsular and Oriental, the British India, the Khedivial Mail, and the Ellerman and Bucknall Steamship Companies, as well as Lloyd's. Presumably therefore shipping interests in the United Kingdom are already well aware of the development. 3. Mr. Wills of that corporation informs my Commercial Secretary that a 'tramp” service is contemplated, with sailings every two months, calling, according to cargo available, at Port Said, Red Sea ports and Aden, Bombay and Karachi, Persian Gulf ports and Basrah, and possibly on the westbound voyage Haifa and Beyrouth. It is not at present proposed to carry passengers. Mr. Wills believes that the Lloyd Triestino have no present intention of rate-cutting; and are likely to compete • with the Soviet sailings from the Black Sea and the Hansa line sailings from Hamburg»rather than with British lines. 4.

I cannot help feeling (and the Foreign Office are rather disposed to agree) that Colonel Fowle's telegram uoes not cover the whole ground. On the broad question in issue the point he takes is, of course, a good one. But to enable us to make up our minds here as to what, if any, action can be taken, it would, I think, be of assistance (ana the Foreign Office agree) to have some more precise indication of his views as to points such as the following:- (a) Whether in his view a service of this nature is likely to pay; (b) To what extent it is likely to be a nuisance, politically or otherwise; (c) What, if any, political precautions will be needed in the event of its materialising. Ought there, for instance, to be any restriction on visits to Trucial ports, on the landing of foreigners in any of the Gulf Sheikhdoms, etc?

Minister, Tehran, about this development which they regard as being of considerable potential importance, and we have also sent an express letter asking the Government of India and the Political Resident for their views. It ,seems clear that the Italian line is receiving a heavy Government subsidy, and it is considered that the Italian Governments motives must be mainly political. ^‘ksched note prepared by the Department Previous Papers :— Overseas irade shows the foreign services at present running to the Persian Gulf with their ports of call as far as these can be specified. It will be seen that the German Hansa line is the only one which hitherto has j 5041 2000 1.31&lt;0 * 'i has been maintaining what can be described as a iairly regular service. The Department of Overseas Trade think that the Italian service will probably call at Bandar Shahpur and any other port for which they have sufficient cargo, and the possibility arises that they may wish to call at ports on the Arab Coast of the Gulf. We may, therefore, have to consider whether it is desirable that any steps should be taken to restrict the penetration of Italian influence into the Arab States. There can, of course, be no objection to Italian vessels landing cargo at Bahrain, Koweit or Muscat, but it might be considered necessary to prohibit the crews from landing at these ports, and some action may also have to be taken in regard to the Trucial Coast where, as far as is known, i'*'. vessels belonging to European States have not hitherto made calls. The Trucial Shaikhs have in the past been generally hostile to the idea of visits being made by foreign vessels to their States and reference is invited to the papers at P.951/26 in the attached bound volume regarding the Shaikh of Debai f s refusal to allow the landing of cargo from a German vessel. There are precedents for excluding foreigners from the Arab Coast, and after the war restrictions were imposed on German Nationals visiting any of the Arab States in the Gulf (please see Mr. Laithwaite f s note of 2nd October, 1930, flagged). These restrictions ^ have since been withdrawn in the case of Bahrain, Muscat and Koweit. Restrictions have also been imposed on Soviet vessels, and in 1928 the Shaikhs of Koweit/ * ^''tTT/u Igi'Minute Paper, Department. Koweit and Bahrein were advised not to allow the crews of Kussian vessels to land (P.2954/28), The Shaikh of Bahrein, who has a religious objection to Soviet citizens, went further than this, . and in 1929 the Bahrein Government issued a notification forbidding Russian vessels even to land cargoes at Bahrain. ^ J Meanwhile we can await the views of the Government of India and the Political Resident, and the question whether any special action need be taken can be considered in the light of these. lit ls\\ .

Lloyd Triestino . of Trieste, from the Adriatic. Sovtorgflot » of Odessa, from Russian Black Sea Ports. Swedish Bast Asiatic Co. . of Gothenburg, from Gothenburg and the Continent. While the Hausa Line advertise calls at all the ports mentioned, they call only when sufficient inducement offers, and it frequently happens that ports are omitted. The same remarks apply to all lines. The Lloyd Triestino service started in December, 1933 and was based on Italian exports for the new railway. They will, therefore probably call at Bandar Shahpour and any other port for w^ich they have sufficient cargo. The Sovtorgflot follow the usual Russian plan of butting in wherever they see a chance. The Swedish East Asiatic Co., made a few calls with Swedish railway material for the Persian Railway. They are not making further calls at present. While certain Japanese interests have their eyes on the Persian Gulf, they have not yet started running a regular line. 22nd January, 1934,F CONFIDENTIAL In any further communication on this subject, please quote No. E 7900/7900/34 and address— not to any person by name. but to— “The Under-Secretary of State,’’ Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. r r. z. * r O • &gt; ) / o i G ^ /.
