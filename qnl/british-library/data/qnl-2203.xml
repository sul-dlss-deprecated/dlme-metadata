I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that the telegram was received by the Agency only ten minutes past five yesterday afternoon. This does not seem to me to be very good service.

Dear Sir* Bahrain Receipt ^ ^ ^ voko.z-v*'* *•“ «• Ae beg to thanK you for your letter Ho, 462 of the 13th June. tie appreciate your difficulty as regards the teth ering oi infected camels but we beg tc put our case more in detail for your kind consideration. The agreement in question was drawn up with a view tc alforcing us freedom from technical interference in respect of cur installations but it was obviously never envisaged that animals woulc be tethered on the ground and a clause to prevent this was not at the time considered necessary. It is perhaps not appreciated that the camels are tethered under and in the proximity of our London Rhombic Aerial. This aerial relies for its directive properties on* amongst other tilings, its distance from ground level, and for this reason ground is chosen which is perfectly flat and free from unevenesses. The careful planning of the Installation Engineer has now bean nullified by the presence of these animals in addition of the danger to our underground cables as previously mentioned. To continue an efficient service to the Public we could, at great expense and inconvenience, dismantle the present aerial system, including masts, and re-erect elsewhere, but we have no guarantee that the new site would be free from the staking of animals. s', xs —( 2 ) No* 294/43 We have in the pa^i enjoyed the cooperation and friendly assistance of the Bahrain Government, in fact our presence here depends on amicable v/orking between us* We trust we may rely on these relations being main- talned and respectfully beg you to reconsider your deci* sion in our favour* Yours faithfully f Copy to Political Agent,No. 1946-33/3 Political Agency, Bahrain, v The 20th June, 1946.

Cable &amp; Wireless Limited, Bahrain. p s.*- Regarding your lettsf No. 29A dated lOtti Rajab, 1365. The camels are tethered on the site in question because it is the only area in the neighbourhood of the Fort which consists of sand and their old lines cannot be used owing to mange infection. The men in-charge of the camels have been stationed in a barasti off the edge of the protected are but close enough to the lines to keep the camels under supervision. I have read over the agreement referring to the protected area and I find it difficult to interpret it as precluiing the tethering of camels in that area. S.Z.© No.2116-33/3. Political Agency* Bahrain* The 2nd July, 1946. To The Adviser to the Government of Bahrain* Reference your memorandum No.1359-36-16 dated the 25th June, 1946. 2. Although* as Messrs. Chble &amp; Wireless Limited have already admitted (vide their letter No.29A/43 dated the 10th June* 1946) the question of tethering camels was not* specifically covered in the agreement* their presence in the area concerned appears to be against the spirit of the agreement, in addition to constituting a potential menace to underground cables. 3. In view of these factors therefore, and also of the strong technical reasons advanced by the Company, in their letter No.29A/43 dated the 16th June, 1946, it is hoped that you will find it possible to accede to their request, and to have the camels permanently removed elsewhere.
