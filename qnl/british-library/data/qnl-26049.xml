Dear Miss Rolfe, Will you kindly refer to' ygnr lette: dated the 4th February 1^43 (Ext#249/43; about Mr.Rene Piquemal? We have not recruited anyone of this name as Foreman or Assistant Foreman for the Ordnance Factories in India, and he would not be appointed from this country in such a capacity except through us. As it seemed possible that he might have been employed by one of the commercial firms engaged in steel manufacture in Bengal, we got into touch with Messrs.Tata Ltd. They were good enough to enquire of other commercial undertakings interested in steel production in India, but neither Tata nor any of those firms has any knowledge of Mr.Piquemal. Yours sincerely.Ext. 22f9/43 DRAFT D, 0 , LETTER.

Enquiries in several Departments of this Office have failed to throw any light on the case, but Bull of the Military Department has suggested that you might be able to say whether such a man was recruited by your Office and sent out to India as a foreman or assistant foreman, or whether you know if he was employed direct by the Government of India in that capacity.

Iss, 9th January 1943* 249 943 Dear Rumhold, A strange story is told me oy xne Red Cross of a soldier named Rene PIQUEMAL of the l6th R,A.D.A., General Staff, who was reported missing in the loss of the SIROCCO on May 30th 1940. He was presumed drowned by the International Red Cross after exhaustive enquiries. His father, however, now writes that he has obtained information from a source which he says is very sure 'I have learned that from England he was sent to India, somewhere near Calcutta, to be employed in a steel factory. I learnt once again that he left India on a Red Cross ship ’torpedo boat American WOOMING* which boat, after having touched at Cadiz, was never heard of again”. (I presume that he means that he left India on a Red Cross boat which carried the rescued crew of the torpedo boat WYOMING). This succession of events concerning a simple soldier seems to me extraordinary, but I cannot dismiss it,in view of the circumstances, without verification. If we could say that the son was not sent to India, and v/as not among the Wyoming crew, it would probably meet our purpose. Can you help me?. Yours sincerely, ft£Co.
