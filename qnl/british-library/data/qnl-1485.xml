With refereno^o the first sentence of paragraph 4 of my telegram No.18672 of 19th October, copy is enclosed of notes exchanged with the Legal Adviser, India Office regarding the extent to which the Sheikh of Koweit is bound in respect 01 tne Neutral Zone by the 1913 correspondence, ti.. ;i p n. /f / 3 /oi 4-fcIndia Office, Whitehall, q y r *] O, Vi • ± Ext.7930/46 . ^ December, 194^. Now that the question of some Oil Company, British or American, obtaining an oil concession from the Sheikh of Koweit covering his rights in the Koweit Neutral Zone has become a live issue, perhaps some preliminary consideration should be given to the question of a political agreement being eventually drawn up between the successful Company and His Majesty* s Government. 2, You will be aware that similar political agreements have been concluded with the respective concessionaire companies in the case of all the Arab States of the Persian Gulf - with BAPCO in respect of Bahrein, with P.C.L. in respect of Muscat; Qatar and the individual Tracial Sheikhdoms, and with the Koweit Oil Company in respect of Koweit proper. Briefly, the effect of these political agreements is that the Oil Company concerned undertakes to respect the position of our political authorities in the Sheikhdoms, that British, strategic and other interests are safeguarded and that an undertaking is given to enable the production and resources of the Company to be placed at the disposal of His Majesty* s Government in the event of national emergency or war. There is also in the Koweit Political Agreement a clause to the effect that the Company will erect a refinery, if commercially justifiable, and will consult with His Majesty’s Government about this. (There is a Special Refinery Agreement with P.C.L' The Companies further undertake to remain British by registration (likewise in respect of any transferee or subsidiary companies) and to employ as many British subjects or subjects of the Ruler as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking. Frau the point of view of the Company the effect is that they secure the co-operation of the British political authorities in obtaining from the Ruler the assistance they require in oil developments. K.L.Stock, Esq., * Ministry of Fuel and Power, Millbank, S.W,1.\ .* •'* : V • ,+el n o 0 ) ' 1 i r 3. -he case of the Koweit Neutral Zone is different from that of the other Sheikhdoms in two main respects:- (a) the oil rights of the whole of the Zone are at present held jointly by Ibn Baud and the Sheikh of Koweit and (b) the Sheikh of Koweit may consider that he is not bound under the terms of the 1913 correspondence (a copy, of which is ( To Sheikh of Koweit, dated • jD(/£ 2?th October, 1913 ( Prom Sheikh of Koweit, dated ( 2?th October, 1913. Cl enclosed) to secure the agreement of His Majesty’s Government before concluding a concession for the Neutral Zone; thus we might find it difficult to use the necessity of obtaining our consent to a concession agreement as a lever with the Oil Company in securing the conclusion of a political agreement. A copy of notes exchanged with the Legal Adviser, India Office, is enclosed in connection with the legal position. 4* The form which any political agreement for the Neutral Zone would have to take would, of course, depend on whether Caltox, who already hold Ibn Saud’s share of the oil rights, obtain the Koweit share also, or whether another Company - British or American - do, and in the latter event on what kind of arrangements they make with Caltex for co-operation in working the Zone. In this connection the question whether the Zone will be exploited from the Koweit or Saudi Arabian side (or both) will also be relevant. There is also, fT n SU r^ )0Se '? possibility of an arrangement being come to whereby rio Zcnu i s divided into two distinct geographical areas, one of which Galt ex night exploit on behalf of Ibn Saud and the other of which cwnother Company might exploit under a concession from the Sheikh of Koweit. ^ Although, therefore, we cannot go very far at the moment in considering the details of any political agreement, we assume that mis Majesty’s Government will wish to have such an agreement, and it i-^.y be desirable to familiarise the competing Companies with the idea 7' a fairl N early date. This would seem to apply particularly to the Burmah Oil Compary who are not entirely familiar with the political set-up «i a *4 ' © Ifc set-up in the Persian Gulf; P,C.L. are, of course, already familiar with the idea of political agreements and may perhaps be expected without difficulty to fall in with His Majesty’s Government’s wishes on the subject. 5. We should be glad to have your observations generally. I am sending a copy of this letter to Garran at the Foreign Office and Dodds at the Admiralty (with a copy of the relevant telegrams) and should be glad to have any comments they may wish to offer. The Admiralty would, I think, be primarily interested in a political agreement from the point of view of the Pre-emption Clause usually included in these political agreements. We are also asking the Political Resident whether he has any comments.— n translation of a letter dated the 26th Zu-al-Kada 1331 (h7th October 1913) from Shaikh Sir Mubarak- as-Subah, huler of Kuwait, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf© After compliments.

With reference to the conversation which took place between us yesterday, if you see no objection therein I wish with your consent to inform the British Government that you are agreeable to the visit of Admiral Slade in order that he may inspect the places (showing traces) of bitumen at Burgan and elsewhere and that if there seems in his view a hope of obtaining oil therefrom. Your Excellency agrees not to give a concession in this regard to anyone other than a person nominated and recoramended by the British Government* This is what was necessary to communicate to you and may you be preserved* Dated the 26th Zu-al-Kada 1331 (2?th October 1913)#0 Legal Adviser The Kuwait Neutral Zone is an area south of Kuwait proper which, by an agreement between Ton Saud and H.M, G-. in 1922 (subsequently accepted by the Sheikh of Kuwait) was recognised as ” common to the two States of Nejd (i, e. Saudi Arabia) and Kuwait who were to enjoy equal rights in it until such time as a fresh agreement should be arrived at between them regarding it through the good offices of ' (See page 80 of P.G-. 13). In 1913 (ut a time when an area now including the Neutral Zone was claimed by Kuwait) the Sheikh of Kuwait agreed in an exchange of correspondence with the Political Resident that he would not give an oil concession in respect of Burgan (a place in Kuwait territory proper) 'and elsewhere' other than to a person appointed from the British Government, The question has now arisen how far, if at all, the Sheikh of Kuwait is bound by the 1913 correspondence in^ respect of his desire to grant an oil concession covering his rights in the Neutral Zone, We should be grateful for any opinion you feel able to give on this point. I assume of course, that the condition precedent to tne obligation under which the Sheikh placed himself in 1913 was strictly fulfilled, i,e, that there seemed at that time in the^ view of Admiral Slade and the Sheikh’s son hope of obtaining oil from the place of bitumen shown. If so, then it seems to me that, in so far as it still lies in the power of the Sheikh to grant a concession in the noutral territory, whether jointly with Ibn Saud or in relation to a tract geographically separated under an agreement with the latter, and assigned to himseli, there would be no justification for his not adhering to his undertaking. The matter might, however, stand on a different footing if it were successfully contended that the neutral territory never in fact belonged to the Sheikh, his present joint rights therein dating only from 1922.

I think I have fathomed the reasons underlying the Shaikh’s attitude towards Petroleum Concession Limited which formed the subject of my telegram Mo.571 dated the 22nd October^ 1946 and has been puzzling me for sometime. 2. The trouble was, I imagine, that the Shaikh feared that Petroleum Concession Limited were going to try to claim ore- ferential treatment on the grounds of long standing acquaintance and old friendship with him. He told me on several occasions that he, did not know Skliros personally and had had no renalar exchanges of greetings, presents etjcetera. Later on he told me ? while on the same subject, that Holmes, when negotiating with him for the Kuwait Concession-had presented him first with a launch and a motor car. 3. In actual fact it was not Skliros’ intention to make any V such claim and I advised him to make this .quite clear to His Highness. Petroleum Concessions Limited did, in fact, make him a pure and simple business offer and I think he was much relieved At any rate he has completely dropped his previous”line of talk” emphasising that he was under no sort *f obligation to the °• rY g Under the circumstances I think that my suggestion that x etroleun Concessions Limited should be less un-oriental in their approach was wrong and that their tactics were probably correct.

Please refer to India Office express letter No. Ext.7930/46| dated the 6th December, 1946. 2. I hope to telegraph my comments shortly on the proposal to conclude a Political Agreement in respect of the Kuwait Neutral £one. My first reaction is that from our point of view it is *in every way desirable that we should obtain such an Agreement and that the only reason for hesitating to take action to this effect is the fear of causing annoyance to Ibn Saud. His Majesty 1 s Minister. Jeddah, will presumably be asked how that potentate is likely to view the matter. 3. I am writing now to state my views on the 1913 correspondence about Burgan, vide paragraph 2 of your express letter. With all due deference to Kemp^ opinion, I feel that even if from the strictly leg^al aspect the correspondence can be regarded as binding the Shaikh to consult us before giving an oil concession to insist on this in practice would be contrary to both logic and justice. Shaikh Mubarak* s letter is not in the form of an agreement and refers to a specific ecc&amp;sion. Although he uses the word M never' I cannot believe that he intended to bind himself and his successors for all time in respect of all oil concessions in his territory. In Sir Percy Cox* s letter Shaikh Mubarak was asked to agree that Admiral blade should inspect the places at Burgan and elsewhere showing traces (presumably external) of bitumen and that if the Admiral saw any hope of obtaining oil therefrom he (the Shaikh) would not give a concession for it to anyone other than a person nominated and recommended by the British Government. The Shaikh replied that if the Admiral came he would send one of his sons with him to show the place of bitumen in Burgan and elsewhere and that If In their view (=in the view of the Admiral and the Shaikh^ son ?) there seemed a hope of obtaining oil therefrom he would never give a concession in this matter to anyone except a person appointed by the British Government. The most that can be read into this, in my opinion, is a promise by Shaikh Mubarak not to give an oil concession except to our nominee in places showing traces of bitumen which were inspected by the Admiral and the Shaikhs son (?) and from which he and the son (?) were of opinion that oil might be obtained. I have nothing on record to show what places were inspected by the Admiral and what his views were regarding the prospects of obtaining oil from them, but I do not see how Shaikh Mubarak* s letter can possibly be read as covering places not Inspected by the Admiral and I am very doubtful If it can be held to cover places so inspected and not claimed at the time // for exploita tion especially after a lapse of so many years.

'£ Ul~i I aiu replying to Abraham's letter of 17th January about the Koweit Neutral tone. I believe that the reason why the Zone was not definitely allocated or divided up in 1922 was that in view of certain rumours as to the existence of oil Sir Percy Cox did not feel able to agree to its allocation to either party until the rumours had been set at rest. So far as is concerned the matter has never been taken any further and there is no further agreement at present in contemplation. Unofficial suggestions for the division of the Zone have, I think, been made in the past, but I should not imagine that either Ruler would agree to a division until he considered that ho had full information about the oil prospects of the whole Zone. I would not however exclude the possibility of a division of the Zone at some future date if the Rulers can agree, since from the administrative point of view this would no doubt be a convenience. a 192f7, Tout** •InowsO* F.

The ©yect terminology to be used requires rather careful thought end It would perhaps be worth while considering it at this stage. 4 . Watson will no doubt b© willing to show you the whole draft agreement if you wish. It mostly follows the lines of the ruwait Oil Company’s agreement.

The last stage would then be an agreement between this Company and the two huieis containing provisions regarding production, communications, Customs, etc. It seems to me very difficult at the present stage for either Shaikh Ahmad or his concessionaires to accept any very definite obligations regarding action to be undertaken in territory where they have only undefined fifty per cent rights. 5 On the assumption that none of the parties the Neutral £one I think it nay be found desirable for fc P-/A- f L. /tv n(i h'f-86/13 Telegram En clair From Political Agent, Kuwait, To Political Resident, Bahrain.

The Gulf dead rent was on the same level as that of I.P.C. The latter Group have not in fact discussed the rate of royalty with the Sheikh.

Dear Lepper, r^o Would you please refer to your letter of 21st February regarding the drafting of Article 1 of your proposed Oil Concession Agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit covering his rights in the Neutral Zone. I unders'Goad you to say that the remaining Articles of the draft agreement followed the lines of the Koweit Oil Company’s Commercial Agreement of 23 rd December, 1934. The terms will clearly affect Ibn Saud and the Caltex Company, and we should, therefore, have expected (though we are not entirely clear on this point) that the Agreement will have to be cleared with Ibn Saud and Caltex before it may be finalised. In this case it will presumably be impossible for an agreement of the type contemplated to be finalised during Abraham's present visit to Koweit. We should, therefore, in the circumstances like to have the opportunity of considering further with the Ministry of Fuel and Power and Foreign Office the precise drafting of this Article before giving you a definite opinion. Subject to these reservations it may be of assistance to you now to have the opinion of our Legal Adviser who has noted as follows. 'Even if it were possible - and I think it would be somewhat difficult - so to frame an article as to safeguard the position of the B.O.C. in the particular manner suggested/ G. W. Lepper, Esq. , Burmah Oil Company, Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, E.C.2.

In the circumstances there would appear now to be no point in such a division, and one must, I t link, assume that the interests of their respective concessionaires would in any event be present to the minds of both the Rulers, and that no arrangement would be arrived at which would derogate from the rights granted or tend to embarrass the grantees in the fair and full exeiuise thereof.'

Dear Harrison, I confirm receipt of your tel phone message of yesterday passing on the following telegram from Mr. Abisham to Mr. Jatson:- 'Suggest show Article one to India Office ”in case they or Foreign Office can 'suggest any better wording'. 2. Article one of our draft for an agreement in respect of an oil concession over the Neutral Zone reads as follows:- ' ARTICLE 1 . - Whereas by a convention 'signed at Uqair on 2nd December 1922 'it was agreed that all rights in the 'Neutral Zone as defined in Appendix 'A attached to this document and shown 'gene ally in red cn the attached map 'should be shared equally by the 'Government of Nejd and Kuwait it is 'now agreed and understood that all 'rights and obligations referred to in 'the paragraphs which follow shall 'apply only in respect of the fity per 'cent share of such rights and 'corresponding obligations pertaining 'by virtue of the above mentioned convention 'to the Shaikh.' 3. With reference to the Uqair Convention it is essential to our proposed agreement that any subsequent fifty/fifty division between Kuwait and the Nejd of the territory of the Neutral Zone shall not involve any corresponding territorial division of the oil rights.4* We feel that there is some doubt as to whether Article 1 in its present form would safeguard us in the contingency referred to in paragraph 3 above and we shall greatly appreciate any advice which the^ India Office or the Foreign Office can give for suitable additions or amendments to the draft ArtiCi-e. 5.

Agreement the usual clause reserving from the operations of the oil company defence sites etc. required by H.I.i. G-., the l/ar Office and Air Ministry say that, while they can foresee no such definite requirements at present, they think the inclusion of such a clause would be a wise precaution. 3. Y/buld you please copy any further correspondence on the Neutral Zone direct to(S.2503/63/91) SECRET POREIGi; OEb’ICE, 3. ;1. 1. 9th April, 1947. Dear Crafftey-Smith, As you probably kp.ow the Sheikh of Koweit has recently declared himself ready to dispose of his oil rights in the Lieutrai Zone of Koweit, He has received bids from the Iraq Petroleum Company, Eastern Gulf Company (American) and the Burmah Oil Company (British). Lie has not yet closed with arty of them but we learn that the Iraq Petroleum Company^ bid is substantially higher than that made by the BurmahOil Company. Clearly so long as the status quo is maintained, tiie only way of exploiting the zones oil would be for Galtex (who hold the concession from Ibn Saud) and the Conopany who get the concession from the Sheikh of Koweit to make some sort of working agreement for joint exploitation. The question arises, however, whether it would be preferable to try for a division of the zone into two parts. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was at first opposed to our taking the initiative in attempting to bring about a geographical division of the heutral Zone, since negotiations might well extend over years and lead to a revival of boundary disputes with Saudi Arabia elsewhere. He felt that some kind of personal agreement between the two rulers regarding the division of oil rights in the Neutral Zone whether on a geographical or some other basis would solve many of our . difficulties. ^ - f*}-' Hay has now had the opportunity of discussing the question of oil rights in the Neutral Zone with the Sheikh. The latter said that if’VLid* Company reached an agreement with Ibn Saud's compaiy for joint operations all would be well. Otherwise it was for His Pajesty* s Government who had created the zone to decide how it should be divided between the two companies. He said that he had no intention of raising the matter with Ibn Saud vrith whom he never discussed local politics. L.B. Gra£gte^-3mith, Esq., CMC, QBE, / metaerWhether His Majesty’s Government will actually be asked by the Sheikh of Kov/eit to take steps for the division of the Zone may depend on which oil company obtains the Sheikh of Koweit’s rights. If Eastern Gulf do, they will no doubt come to an arrangement with Galt ex (if they have not already done so), and the Sheikh will be content to let the status of the i.eutral Zone remain as at present. If, however, the 'Bumah Oil ComiJany obtain the concession there is more chance of His Majesty*s Government being-pressed to arrange a division. In either case we ought to consider whetner a division would b e to His Majesty's Government*s advantage or not. Besides the complications inherent in attempting a geographical division of the zone to which Hay refers a further difficulty would arise if an oil bearing structure were later discovered lying across the dividing line (though this is a difficulty which could arise from ary frontier line in oil bearing territory). On the other hand there might be same advantages in a geographical division of the zone. In the first place it would obviously simplify administration. As far as we know there is at present no administration of ary sort in the Neutral Zone but wit/i the development of oil tlie need for some sort of administration will arise and it is hard to imagine that ary sort of joint administration run jointly on behalf of Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit could function • satisfactorily though the two oil companies in‘their own interests might be able to exercise a salutary restraining influence on their masters. Secondly a geographical division would no doubt make it easier for His Majesty's Government to obtain satisfactory terms in the Political Agreement which in accordance with our usual practice we would wish to make with the compary which obtain the Sheikh of Koweit's rigilts. The normal type of Political Agreement which has been made with other Arab Sheikhdoms in the Gulf provides inter alia :- (a) That the company and ary subsidiary or transferee company shall remain British. . /(b) r(b) That-His Majesty’s Government may reserve from the areas of the operation of the oil company any sites selected 'for defence purposes, for aerodromes, aeroplane or 'seaplane bases... or in connection wita the development 'of harbours.' (c) That in a state of emergency or war His Majesty’s Gove rnment should nave the right of pre-emption of crude oil produced; may require the company to use any local refinery facilities to produce oil in accordance with His Majesty’s Government’s specification; and shall have the liberty to take control of the company's works, plant and premises. ,7e could probably obtain these terms in resrject of half the Zone if fully owned by Koweit, but Ibn Saud would clearly raise the strongest objections if we sought to apply them to the whole Zone owned jointly by Koweit and Saudi Arabia and exploited by a joint company. In fact, we would almost certainly have to give up ary idea of a Political agreement which could be operative so long as the status quo continues'. For your information we understand that the prospects of finding oil are slightly higher in the North, i.e. Koweit half of the zone than in ohe South. If this is known to Ibn Saud it will presumably make him less likely to agree to division. I should be grateful if you could let me know wnat you think about this question. Yours sincerely. (Sgd.)

SSCRSH 1 Deetr l arrison. ue have been considering the ^&gt;oints raised in your letter No.Ext .1*07/47 of the 1st Inarch to Lepper about the Burma Oil Company*s proposed concession witn the Sheikli of Kov/eit covering his ri^its in the Neutral Zone and we liiink that you iaay be interested to have the.opinion of our legal adviser on this subject. It is as follows At meetings held at the Foreign Office in 1^34 with the Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs the view of the Foreign Office was expressed that no part of the oil concession in the Neutral Zone could be separately granted by either of the rulers concerned, tut only jointly by both rulers. The Saudi Arabian representative agreed that his Government was not free to dispose of the concession or any part of it except in agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit. In fapt the Saudi Arabian Government hsus granted to the Califomia-Arabian Standard Oil Comioary a concession to the extent of all the Government's ^right, title and interest, now or hereafter' in the Neutral Zone and that, I think I am right in saying, without reference to or the concurrence of the Sheikh of Koweit. Possibly the views of the Foreign Office in 1934 were wrong and the Saudi Arabian Government did not thereby exceed their powers under the 1922 Agreement, and I think their action would now justify the Sheikh of Koweit in making a similar concession.without reference to Ibn Saud, but on the other hand I am sure that the terms of the 1922 Agreement preclude the concessionaire of either Government from actually exploiting its concession without the concurrence of the other Government* t sxnc6 'biis r’i.^h.'^s of ©soli Govsimrisn’t ©x© in -ctei; unscoix*. To this' exteni,. therefore, it certainly might be desirable, to consult Ion Sand and Caltex before the proposed agreement is finalised - but this would depend on the terms of the agreement which I have not seen. As regards the drafting of Article 1 of the agreement, I am inclined to think that it does need redrafting to make it quite clear that the concession refers to the Sheikh* s present rights and interest in the heutral .oone, out 1 coulo, not adv^e on the precise wording without seeing the agreement as a Whole, ^ Subject to this I agree with the Legal Adviser to the India 'office, that one must assume that the Rulers will in the mture make no arrangement which vdll derogate from the rights granted by them or tend to embarrass the grantees in the fair and Hill exercise of those rights. A search has been made in dur records in order to ascertain whether or not the Saudi Arabian Government referred to or obtained the concurrence of the Sheikh of Koweit when they granted a concession of their rights in the Neutral lone to the California-Arabian Standard Oil Company. V/e have not been able to find any evidence that the Saudi Arabian Government referred to the Sheikh of Koweit. But this is not necessarily conclusive and you may think it worthwhile to see if there is anything in your records which sheds any light on tnis question.

On the other tend, it mil he muon more difficult to define a frontier now, ’when every foot of territory is of great potential value, .nan xi was in the past. If an Agreement on the lines of those n*&lt;te with other Arab Sheikdoms in the Gulf is not- considered vitally necessary, and the formal division of territory =an he shelved, the choice lies between a working agreement xor joint exploitation by both companies and some loose geographical division of the zone, if only one tacitly agreed on between the two companies concerned. Provided Saud and the Sheiich of Eoweit are not asxed to commit themselves to any final division of the territory, «voul it not, perhaps, be possible for them to agree about sharing the royalties? In the circumstances, a profit- sharing agreement might commend itself to both rulers; ^the ^ ^npanief, taving gambled on the acquisition of 'rights' which are disputed, might be persuaded go divide royalties between tnem. With the passing of years, if a Woouldbe iouna - - l - m distinct zones, u.ie g o Witn tne passing ox for the two companies to work m /ruler, - Vu8 . G rulers mijht find it 'best to agree to recognise the 'boundary of these zones as the 'boundary of their otm frontier, «- To sum up, a .clear-cut geographical division would he the most desirable solution, hut I agree with Hay that a search for this would involve interminable and probably abortive negotiations, A working agreement for joint exploitation would be the solution least disturbing of the status quo and general good relations, A half way solution, by which the two companies operated in distinct aones and the two rulers split both royalties would wprk all right until the, precise line of geographical diviaion became important to either company’s individual revenues. If the Ira (^Petroleum Company obtain the Sheikh of Kuweit*s rights, the fact ;bhat Messrs. The Standard Oil v Company of New Jersey or Socony-Vaouum now hold a- large interest in both the Iraq Petroleum Company and Aramco may facilitate friendly acoonmodation between the two exploiting interests.

A Dear Harrison, ^ # Would you please refer to your letter of the l^th Ivlarch and subsequent oorresponaence on the subject of the Koweit Heutral Zone and the possibility of its being divided between Koweit and Saudi Arabia. Until the successful candidate for Koweit's share of the rights in the Neutral Zone is known we do not feel able to add much to what has already been said on this subject. Normally we would have expected the two oil companies who hold Ibn Saud's and the Sheikh of Koweit's oil rights in the Neutral Zone respectively to come to a satistactory working agreement between themselves; and we would not expect eioiier of them to be very willing to'exchange a 50,0 share °f the rights over the whole area for 1C0&gt; share over part of t ie area. In this case, apart, from cutting down an already ^ fairly small area, such an arrangement might be unattractive from the point of view of excluding from one of the sectors the most convenient shipping terminal or water supplies, etc. y,e appreciate that there are definite advantages in a oartition scheme, if circumstances make this xeasiole, and it may be that some of the candidates for the Sheixh oi noweit s rights would find it easier than others to come to a working arrangement with the Caltex Groiro, ht it is not possioie to tell whether this will be so until the 3heixh ol ivoweit P-Q- &amp;a,ur&lt;a.c£ /V*. 9*5'*, &lt;1.

Hie Shell Group, from whom we have made some enquiries, also do not know much about these people. They have, however, provided us with some information (deriving from the Refinery Catalogue of 1944) which indicates that they are consulting petroleum engineers, primarily concerned with the design, con struction and operation of refinery plant and oil processing equipment. There is nothing to indicate that they have any experience of oilfield development or crude oil production operations. At this stage, therefore, it does not look as if they are likely to be serious competitors with the other candidates for an oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone.

My dear Eion, Neutral Zone % Gass, a director of the Anglo-Irani&amp;n Oil Company, saw Victor Butler today and mentioned, in confidence, that the A.I.O.C* were definitely interested in the possibility of securing the Koweit Neutral iione concession if and when they became free to put in a bid* As you will be aware, discussions are going on between the partners in the Iraq Petroleum Company group with the object of amending the Red Line Agreement in such a way as (amongst other things) to leave the partners free to undertake oil developnen: in the Red Line area on their own or in as sociation with other companies as they may choose. Various modifications in the Red Line Agreement have been agreed upon amongst the major partners in the I.P.C. group, but still await acceptance by Gulbenkian. Gass appeared to be hopeful that Gulbenkian* s concurrence might be obtained within the next month or two but this, of course, remains to be seen.

This is to confirm what I said on the telephone this morning about the visit of Mr. A. Jacobsen, President of the Ameranda Petroleum Corporation. He said that his Corporation wanted to hid for the Koweiti Rights in the Koweiti-Eaudi Arabia Neutral Zone. He had ascertained that the State Department had no objection to the entry of his company into this field. The object of his visit to London was to find out if H.M.G. had any objection to his company bidding for the Koweiti Rights in the Neutral Zone, and if the answer was that H.n.G-. had no objection, to find out if the Sheikh had imposed a time limit on the bidding and if the grant of any concession was subject to the final approval of H.M.G. From the Foreign Office point of view there is no objection to this company bidding for the Neutral Zone concession, and I understand from Donaldson, with whom I discussed the question, that the India Office would not wish to raise objections. Me agreed, I think, that it would be best for Mr. Jacobsen to receive his answer from your Ministry.

Confidential, Dear Donaldson, Following Pyman's letter to Mitchell of 9th August, ana my subsequent conversations with you and Reed, Victor Butler had two short interviews with Jacobsen, Resident of the Amerada Petroleian Corporation, and formed the view that he does not really expect to get the concession, but that, if he does, he will certainly en deavour to come to terms with the Arabian/American Oil Company who hold Ibn Saud 1 s rights in the Neutral Zone. It appears that a month or two ago the State Department cir cularised a number of Independents to the effect that there were still areas in the Middle East for which concessions had not yet been granted and indicating that they would be glad to see them taken up by American Independent companies. It looks as if Amerada*s interest may be largely to please the State Department, ; Mr. Jacobsen had been to see the State Depcjrtment and when he enquired regarding the probable attitude of the British Government, the State Department replied that they did not know but would be v ®ry glad to hear if he was able to find out from us over here. &gt; MINISTRY OF FUEL AND POWER, * PETROLEUM DIVISION, &gt;flOO '? *• : ...... r C . o - 7 MILLBiiNK., S.W.l. 23rd August, 1947.

He fully accepted this; —-——- - (e) we had not formulated any firm views on whether a larger cash payment down would be better than a larger royalty or vice- versa, but that a much higher royalty than was being paid on other existing concessions would undoubtedly cause a good deal of trouble* Jacobsen expressed the view quite bluntly tnat the sensioie arrangement seemed to be for the neutral zone to be dov^j-oped jointly by the ^trabian/american and the Kuwait Oil Company. .7e made no comment on this expression of opinion. You will be interested to know that we have ascertained from the treasury that &gt; hold an interest in Amerada to the extent of 226,000 shares pledged under the R.F.C. loan and 1,978 shares free stock. A point on which we would like your advice is that Jacobsen rang up just before leaving for America to say that if they did decide to bid for the Kuwait Neutral Zone concession it would probably be necessary for them to employ as negotiator, at a very good fee, someone with considerable experience of the Middle iiast and he asked whether we would be able to put him in touch with anybody. He was told that we would think it over and let him know if the situation arose, but that our first reaction was that as we wished to be impartial we might find it difficult actually to suggest or recommend a negotiator to one of the parties seeking the concession. V7e would appreciate your views on this point. . , X am sending a cony of this letter to Pyrnan, Yours sincerely, &lt; (sgd). l. MONSELL-DAVIS. ^COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS OFFICE KING CHARLES STREET, ' WHITEHALL, S.W.I. Ext. 1326/ 47 2nd September, / I enclose herewith two copies of a note of a conversation I had with Southwell the other day. as regards the heutral Zone it would appear that Southwell .ias already made his views on the subject known to the Sheikh and 1 doubt whether there is anything further we can do at the moment except wait and see. Incidentally we should be interested to know whether there has been any definite evidence that the Sheikh actually discussed the heutral hone with Ibn Saud during his recent visit. ,-Lieutenant-Golenel A.C. Galloway ' x ,\ - c.i.s., a &gt; Political Hesidency, l U 6-.. . -Bahrein. -.'M© Mr. Southwell called to .see me yesterday evening in connection with a communication which his Company had recently received from the Political Agent about the status of Koweit Bay. 1 explained to him what the position was and he appeared very well satisfied. 2. V/e then touched on the general continental shelf question as applicable to the division of the sea bed of Persian Gulf in the howeit area. I explained to him our views on the difficulties whicn would meet any attempt to arrive at an agreement for a division of the Persian Gulf, ile said he appreciated this but v/as naturally anxious that no other Compaq/ should obtain rights in that part of the Gulf which might reasonably be regarded as pertaining to Kuweit. He said he thought he might write to us staking out the Koweit Oil Company's interest in this area. I said I saw no objection to his doing so. 3. Conversation next turned to the neutral Zone. Mr. Southwell said he was very worried about the present position. .The Koweit Oil ’Compaq/ were expanding their operations very rapidly and were aiming at production of 15-20 million tons by 1950. They required absolutely all the local labour they could obtain and if a new Company started to develop in the Neutral Zone without consideration of the Koweit Oil Company's development plans and attracted labour from Loweit, this would make it very difficult for the Koweit Oil Compaq/. Prom his own point of view there was only one solution, namely that the Koweit Oil Company should obtain the Neutral Zone concession. The difficulty was of course the 'led Line* agreement but he hoped that this difficulty might be removed in the next two or txiree montns. As regards Aramco he said that the Koweit.Oil Company had no agreement with them regarding the Neutral Zone at present but that relations with them v/e re very friendly - they exchanged a certain amount of information, etc. and he thought there should be no difficulty in coming /toto a satisfactory arrajagement. -llr. Southwell,seemad to think that the prospects of oil being found in the northern part at least of the neutral Zone v/ere very,promising* I asked hha how he would view it if the .Bunnah Oil Gompary obtained the concession. -He said that while the Bunnah Oil Company owned a considerable number of Anglo-Iranian shares and the two Companies had' certain Directors in common, the policy of the Burmah Oil Company would not necessarily fit in with the policy of his own Company. He also, said that on ^•is -i.ast visit n© had mentioned to the Sheikh of Koweit his views as tj tne desirability of the Koweit Oil Compary being granted the Deutral Zone concession, lie tnought himself that it would be to the Sheikh*s own interest to do this in order to avoid future diiiiculties. Tne Sheikh already had more money tnan ne could spend at the moment and from that point of view there was no point in the rapid development of the Neutral Zone by some Company other than the Koweit Oil Company.

(A.I.O.C.) « ^ &gt; In mid-July Mr. Brookes of the American Independent Oil Company arrived in Kuwait and it became clear at once that he was very much under the wing of Izzat Jaafarwho acted as his adviser in his approach to His Highness and arranged accommodation for him in Kuwait. I gave him precisely the same information about the Shaikh*s intentions etc. as other bidders have received. 2. During August and September I believe Izzat Jaafar v/as in contact with Brookes and Isenberger in Egypt and the Lebanon, fhe latter asked His'Highness to accommodate him, Brookes, and Bai Holland (Secretary) on their visit in November to bid. This suggestion did not commend itself to His Highness and he arranged 3. From various signs it seems more than likely that Izzat Jaafar has received financial inducement to further the cause of the American Independent Oil Company. This will not help them should His Highness discover it - and he will at any rate suspect it should Izzat make any serious effort to take their part. The for the Kuwait Oil Company to accommodate Brookes and Hollandand one in Chile (he did not mention the Yemen) and that they have &amp; 100 million 'to play with'. 6. To the majors Isenberger is very much of a 'mean operator' and he admitted to me that it was he who made the notorious bid of 33-J$ royalty for a concession covering 2,000 hectares in Venezuela on behalf of the Phillips Petroleum Company. (It was found to be too expensive to operate and the Company lost heavily). who The people/would otherwise have obtained that concession were the Gulf Oil Company. 7. He also stated:- (a) That he believed that the Tide Water Oil Company had been invited to bid by Abdulla Mulla and that they were not at all keen. T (b) That he had been given a local estimate that the Shaikh would give the Neutral Zone concession in about 2 months. He did not disclose the source but I suspect it was Izzat Jaafar and consequently quite unreliable). (c) That Gulf were bidding on behalf of the Kuwait Oil Company, and (d) That this Company had given no thought to what arrangement could be made with Aramco should they obtain the concession. He tacitly admitted that Aramco would not be likely to welcome them as partners. 8. He and his hangers-on have been most secretive and 'on their guard'. In fact the latter told the butler in the Oil Company house where they are staying that they would rather have their meals alone 9.

Kuwait Neutral Zone ^ r, Further to my letter of the 5th December, v/e have had word from the Amerada Petroleum Corporation (of Delaware, U.S.A.) that they have quite recently made an offer to the Shaikh for his oil rights. Their bid is a cash payment of / 3i million, a minimum yearly payment of / 500,000 to be paid until the value of the royalty equals or exceeds this payment, and a royalty of 25 cents per barrel of 42 gallons. / The latest comparable figures for the American Independent Oil Company are 0 3i million, 425,000, and 0 1.30 per ton of oil, plus one eighth of the value of all gas. If they do secure the concession, Amerada have expressed the intention of merging with ’’one or two other American independent companies whose standing will be such as to make them unquestionably acceptable to the Shaikh as well as to the British Government”. According to Amerada, it seems that American companies already represented in the Persian G-ulf area would welcome the entrance into the field of responsible independent American companies as this would dispel the idea prevalent in some circles that the Persian Gulf area is something like a closed preserve for the benefit of the very large companies. Jacobsen, of Amerada, tells us that the Secretary to the Shaikh informed him that matters as regards the bidding may soon be coming to a head. It looks as if there is no time to be F.A # K.Harrison Esq., Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, Whitehall, S.W.l. /lostv i lost if British interests are not to he eliminated entirely.

Yours sincerely, (Sgd) L. Lonsell-Davis * £ -Ref. ED 745 Pt. 6 ^ MINISTRY OF FU3L AND POWER, PETROLEUM DIVISION, 7, MULBANK, LONDON, S.W.l. Dear Harrison, 5th December, 1947© Eusvait Neutral Zone wall Y/ith reference to the bidding for the Shaikh of Kuwait *s oil rights, the Burraah Oil Company are becoming perturbed at the forcing up of payments by the American Independent Oil Company and their latest bid reported by Tandy in his note, of which you sent us a copy, does not icprove the situation. The rate of royalty on crude oil of about 9/- per ton offered exceeds appreciably the prevailing highest royalty rate in the Middle East of about 8/- per ton, and there are bound to be consequential repercussions. It is expected that B.O.C. will agree to better American Independent’s present terms, but before Abraham is able to discuss them with the Shaikh next January the Americans may think fit to increase their bids to figures which B.O.C. may well consider prohibitive and that the concession on such terms is an uneconomical proposition. I think we must be prepared for the possibility that B.O.C. may wish to call a halt, not perhaps completely, but adopting the standpoint that they cannot continue unaided. Doubtless many diverse factors will be taken into account by the Shaikh in awarding the oil rights, albeit the financial aspect is likely to remain uppermost.

I do not think it likely that the Shaikh would react unfavourably should two (or more) of the cmnpanies now bidding for the Neutral £one come to an understanding and submit a joint offer. He would appreciate that this might enable them to offer more favourable terms than they could offer individually. 3. I think there is no reason to suppose that the Shaikh has any intention of fixing a time-limit for receiving bids. He is by no means in such a need of cash as to make it necessary to close the auction prematurely and lose whatever improved terms he would otherwise have gained. In any case he has told each company that they will be given an opportunity of topping the last bid before the auction is closed. 4. The following details in connection with the Sinclair offer may be of interest. (i) Twichell informs me that he and Lloyd Hamilton negotiated the original cpncession with Ibn Saud on behalf of Standard of California in 1932 and that he obtained the Abyssinian concession for the Sinclair interests in 1945. (ii) The Sinclair Company are in need of oil as their refining capacity amounts to more than twice their crude oil output. (iii) He expressed himself in favour of joint Anglo- American enterprise in Middle Eastern oil. (iv) He stated that the Petroleum Division of the State Department had full knowledge of his purpose in coming here.

As to the proposal generally it is my impression that a division of the Neutral Zone would be undesirable technically from the point of view of exploitation of its oil, if any, and that the comnanies concerned would be likely to prefer to exploit the^oil_jointly« This might not be inconsistent with a division for - the purposes of administration, although many problems would arise should a joint company establish itself athwart the boundary line, 3. I should bo inclined to suggest that we might wait to see whether the companies concerned are likelv to form a joint organisation to work the Neutral Zone before making any suggestion that the Zone be partitioned, 4. In my opinion the Shaikh would probably flatly refuse to discuss the subject with Ibn Saud* It is true that they are on the best of terms, but Shaikh Ahmed would be all the more afraid of bringing up a controversial subject which might embitter their relations. His reply to any such suggestion would probably be that His Majesty's G-overnment created the Neutral Zone - - let them divide it*. ✓■N The Hon'ble Lt-Colonel Sir Rupert Hay.

Abraham, to Sir Rupert Hay. (a) the highest firm and accepted bids so far are: (i) Gulf: % 3,000,000 plus $ 400,000 annually (ii) Phillips: % 3,250,000 plus % 425,000 annually (b) In addition he has had: (iii) a written bid from Amerada of % 3,500,000 plus £ 500,000 annually. (iv) an approach from Sinclair. (v) an approach from Superior. (c) He has told (iii) (iv) and (v) to produce references, and he emphasised that the only bidders about whom he is satisfied are Gulf, Phillips (AI0C), P.C.L. and B.O.C. In view of this I decided to make a bid which would be well above (i) and (ii), and which would also, though . not by very much, beat (iii) if this bid were later allowed. My bid was £900,000 (Rs.120 lakhs) plus £125,000 annually plus royalty at Rs.5 As.5 per long ton and the Shaikh expressed himself as satisfied vith this and gave his usual assurance about not settling v. r ith anyone without giving me a further opportunity to bid ! H.H. and Abdulla Mulla made clear the follov T ing facts: (A IOC)vE / 'vt (^ft) Ext. r )S 0 A 8 SECRET d&amp;dS 4 Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, Whitehall, London, S.W.l* ,!) r.^arch, I9Z18. At a recent inter-depe.rtmental meeting with the Ministry of Fuel and Power and the Foreign Office the position regarding bids for the petroleum rights in the Koweit Neutral Pone was reviewed and the question whether it would be desirable to try to influence the Sheikh in favour of a particular oil company or group of companies was specially considered. ^ v&lt;iS generally felt that the increase in the bidding was such thc't the large sums involved might soon be incommensurate with the oil prospects of the area.' There mgy however be companies having as yet no concessions in the Middle East which may still wish to raise the stakes; and clearly N.N.G. is not in a position to influence the /merican companies in deciding how much they are prepared to offer^ ■■ ..c should be interested to know whether you consider it likely that the j Sheikh may close the bidding at an early date or prolong the auction I for an undefined period. 3 « The latest definite bid of whi-ch wc have information is that of the Amerada Petroleum Corporation, which offered an initial payment of £ 3 A million, a minimum annual payment of # 500 r 000 and a royalty of 25 cents per barrel, have recently heard that if Amerada succeed in gaining the concession, it will be joined by the Continental Oil Company and the Seaboard Oil Company, both of which have been successful in their operations in U.S.A. Fe are advised that Amerada, in conjunction v/ith^the other two companies, would make a strong team and have sufiicient assets, knowledge and ability to make a success of developing the concession. /+• Fe do not know whether Gulf Oil Corporation intend to advance its latest 01f«r. However, as you are aware, it has been mutually agreed between the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Corporation that if. exther of them should obtain Kowoit♦s rights in the Neutral Zone it would share them equally with the other. For the present the A.I.O.C. are debarred from bidding even as an equal partner with the Gulf Oil Corporation in the Koweit Oil Company. This•position may alter when *'^ -Line Agreement is revised, negotiations regarding which are still proceeding, though it appears unlikely that any settlement will be reached for three or four months at the earliest. _5 • By the time you receive this letter you will no doubt have seen Abraham, who will have explained to you the Burmah Oil Company’s intention to increase its previous bid and its readiness to go up to £ 1 , 000 , 000 . Before leaving here Abraham remarked that, if unsuccessful, he would, after his return to the U.K., probably approach Gulf with the object of endeavouring to arrange a tripartite agreement between Gulf, A.T.O.C., and B.O.C., with the purpose of acquiring jointly the Koweit share of the rights in the Neutral Zone. We have no indication whether A.I.O.C. and. Gulf would look favourably on this grouping of companies, v.’hich as far as we are concerned would seem quite a good arrangement. Fe/ Lt. Col. Sir R. Hay, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrein. c A/O 582 0A IE.... /0 3 . ’4 A CONF1DI2. c foel thc.t \ c cc.nnot dictate to the oil conipa.aies whether or with whom they will go into partnership, although the British companies vill undoubtedly consult us before finally committing themselves to any such agreement. As regards the Burmah Oil Company I should explain that it is an important shareholder in n.i.O.C. and consequently if it were to acquire rights in the Neutral Zone it would tend to develop the area in agreement with the Koweit Oil Co. o. I should here say in parenthesis that since our interdepartmental meeting, there has been an important development so far as the participation of the Burmah Oil Company is concerned. The Treasury I-c.ve expressed the opinion that, in view of the deteriorating position of our bf, - la nce of payments since January, 191 j- 7 , and the small amount Ox steel &lt;_iVe.ila.ble, which, when taken with our dollar shortage, will mean that the British petroleum industry will be hard put to it to develop concessions already held, the Burmah Oil Company should be hauled off as soon as possible from further participation in the Neutral Zone ruction. Since, however, Abrahar.. has already gone out c.nG since the sheikh is apparently in no Lurry to dispose of his rights and it is unlikely that any final commitment will be reached in the near future, the Treasury have said that they are prepared to wait until Abrahar.. returns home in order to assess the position. Nothing has yet been said to the Burmah Oil Company about this developp.ient anc. we should therefore prefer that you make no reference to it in any discussion with Abraham. 1 * e realise that there are likely to be some administrative difficulties if the Sheikh grants a concession to a company not connected in any way with the company already established in the vicinity. If two separate companies in Koweit and the Neutral Zone were expanding their operations simultaneous!3^, the3^ might be faced with a shortage of labour, and the cost of local labour wna materials might rise rapidly. In their own interests, however, too computing companies would probably make arrangements to ensure that action by one of them did not seriously prejudice the position though an independent company would naturally wish to push ahead with its development in order to get quick returns oh its capital. I should be grateful for 3rour opinion whether any real wilficulty of this nature would be likely to arise. No doubt the ' local manager of the Koweit Oil Company, or Southwell in the course a- one of his visits, will have informed the Sheikh of his views as to the disadvantages likely to be suffered by his company or Koweit ' xrom the appearance on the scene of an entirely new. company. is a further aspect of the Koweit Neutral Zone question wncL requires consideration. Based on the best information cvailable, the expansion programmes for the oil fields of the different Middle East countries provide for the following increases in production:- Country mk 1251 Millions of Tons Persia 19.2 37.0 Iraq 4.7 13.5 Saudi Arabia 8.0 25.5 Bahrein 1.1 1.2 Koweit Q,atar 0.8 nil 24.4 1.0 Total 102.6From these figures you will see that the production increoso for Koreit is already considerably more rapid than that in any other Kiddle East country. If a nev/ oil.field should be developed, the rate of increase in Koweit production would be still greater. If this should occur we may well expect repercussions in some of the neighbouring countries, such as Iraq, which nay express dissatisfaction with the relatively slow rate of increase in their production and the consequent loss to them of revenue from oil royalties, etc. Taking the afore mentioned 1951 production forecast, the approximate overall payments by the oil companies to the Government, at the present scale of royalties, taxes and other payments, are estimated as follows Country Persia Iraq Saudi Arabia Bahrein Koweit Millions of £s ib.5 5.9 10.3 O .35 5.95 Qp.tar Total 0.23 36.63 9. .In spite of the administrative and other difficulties which we ray have to expect if an independent company obtains the concession, it is important that you should not give any advice to the Sheik which could be construed as directly or indirectlir favouring the grant of the concession to the Kovreit Oil Company or any other of the big established oil companies, whether British or American. A certain section of public opinion is continually pressing the U.K. Government to adopt a policy favouring immediate internationalisation of oil resources. The allegation is made that the Anglo-American. Oil Agreement is designed to protect the position of the existing big oil companies and to prevent independent companies getting a footing in oil producing areas, particularly in the Middle East. It is therefore necessary to avoid any suggestion that we are pressing for the grant of the concession to any particular company unless there are over-riding considerations of great importance which would justify departure from this general policy.

Shaikh has informed me that he intends tQ close Neutral Zone auction in May and that he has asked all four competitors whom he recognises viz Petroleum Concessions uimited, Burma Oil Company, Oulf Oil Corporation and iimerican Independent Oil Company to send representatives to Kuwait in that month if they still wish to be considered. Political Copy taken for Kuwait File. a&amp;v•mm*** aKCRKT. The Residency, Bahrain, the 19th March 1948 D&gt;0. Mo. 591-3, 5*1 S r ^ Please refer to your demi-official letter No. Kxt. 550/48 of the 3rd March about the auction for the oil concession in the Kuwait share of the huwait .neutral iione. 2. xn paragraph 2 you ask me how long tVie auction is likely to last. X have replied to this question in my telegram No.219 of the 15th March despatched from Kuwait. The Shaikh hopes to close the auction in May and has asked all the competitors whom he recognises to send representatives to Kuwait then. It appears that he wishes, if possible, to exclude the other competitors viz* Amerada, the Sinclair interests (Twitchell) and the Superior Oil Company, from whom he has refused to accept offers pending the production of ref erences. 3. X am told that the Shaikh will in due course ask the Company which makes the highest bid to produce its detail ed proposals. if they do not satisfy him he will turn to the next highest bidder. 4. Prom the local point of view the combination of companies suggested in your paragraph 5 would be .co-«v-enfently satisfactory and I feel sure it would be acceptable to the 3haikh who would welcome the prospect of a solution which would leave as few as possible of his friends disappointed. 5. X was sorry to learn from paragraph 6 of your letter that the economic crisis may make it necessary for the Burmah Oil Company to withdraw from the auction. X am not in a position to argue on this subject but X would point out that it is likely to be some years before operations can start on an extensive scale in the Neutral £one. Negotiat ions between the successful company and the shaikh, and then between the shaikh’s Company and I bn Saud’s Company, and then between the two Companies, H.M.G. , Ibn Saud and the Shaikh regarding political and administrative arrangements will inevitably take a long time and after that a considerable period must be devoted to exploration and surveying before operations can start for the production of oil, if it is discovered. So far therefore as the shortage of steel is concerned it would appear probable that the Kuwait Oil Company and also Petroleum Concessions .Limited in Qatar will have completed most of their constructional programme before steel is required for operations in the Neutral Zone. Xn these circumstances I very much hope that it may still be found possible to allow a British Company to compete for the Neutral Zone Concession, if not on its own, then jointly with an American .Company as contemplated in paragraph 5 of your letter. - , 6. The report contained in my telegram No.228 of the 12th March that it was understood that the Shaikh intended to ask for payment to be made in dollars may perhaps influence the Treasury’s attitude in this matter. the information w a s obtained not from the Shaixh himself but from'his Secretary Abdullah Mullah who told Schooling the Manager of the Ottoman / Bank J.P. Gibson JSsquire, Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, London, ij.W.l.- 2 - Bank at Basra that *hen a concession Was granted the Shaikh vrould ask for payment to be made in dollars* Abdullah Mullah also told another bank manager that the Shaikh w a s likely to favour the American Independent Oil Company owing to the large dollar payments they had offered* This may be one of the points that the Shaikh is leaving for settlement until the auction is completed c.f* paragraph 3 above and if it is considered a vital one i would suggest that Abraham might be prompted to make enquiries about it* 7. In your paragraph 7 you enquire whether any diffi culty would be likely to arise from competition for labour if t»o companies in Kuwait and the neutral &amp;one were expanding their operations simultaneously. As I have pointed out in paragraph 5 above the Kuwait Oil Company should almost have reached the limits of their expansion before the Neutral £one Company can begin* In any case I do not think tne situation would be worse than it is at present when there is great competition for labour in Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar and at various places on the mainland owiog to the ever expanding activities of the various oil companies and the construction of the Trans Arabian pipe-line* In fact the situation may well improve as nomads who have obtained employment with the Oil Companies are showing a tendency to marry and settle near the camps and large numbers of Arabs, Persians and Baluchis who are affected by the rise in prices and the practical cessation of the pearl trade are migrating from the Trucial Coast, Muscat and other places to the oil-fields. 8* In your paragraph 9 you discuss the possible reper cussions in Iraq and other countries of the greatly increased rate of production and revenue in Kuwait which will ensue if a new oil field is developed in the Neutral done in addition to the present one. It is difficult for me to asses the nature and extent of such repercussions which in any case are not likely to be felt for some years for reasons already stated. It would not, however, appear to be fair to either Kuwait or iiaudi Arabia to slow up the development of the oil resources of the weutral zone , if any exist, for fear of exciting tVie jealousy of neighbouring countries. 9. with reference to paragraph 9 of your letter, the Political Agent and myself have been and will be very careful not to give any aavice to the shaikh which could be inter preted by him as indicating that we expect him to favour one or other of the competing companies.86/13 Telegram S.6 (CYPHER TELEGRAL - Q.T.P. - SECRET).

Prodrome, London. Telegram From To No.7. Dated the 15th May, 1948. IMPORTANT. Secret. Following from Political Resident. Shaikh hopes to close Neutral Zone auction by end of month* Rhoades of Gulf Oil Company is here. In reply to enquiry from Abraham Shaikh has asked him to come by May 20th. Representative^ of American Independent Oil Company is at Cairo and I understand will be summoned. Shaikh says he warned Skliros of Iraq Petroleum Company since months ago that his Company should send representative in May iff they are still interested but has heard nothing further. Please telegraph whether Iraq Petroleum Company will be sending representative. Shaikh does not propose to invite Amerada and Sinclair iHfcszss interests to bid. 2. Rhoades latest offer is 1 # 65 dollars per ton royalty i.e. the equivalent of the royalty paid by Aramco in Saudi Arabia, 3,750,000 dollars down and 600,000 dollars annua] payment. He says he does not think his company can match the royalty offered by the American Independent Oil Company but that they are prepared to raise the down and annual payments if necessary. He says that as the Company is now offering dollar payments they will probably have to take up the concession if granted as a purely American entity and that Pyron will shortly be discussing this matter in London. 3. General opinion here is that one of the two American Companies will obtain the concession owing to the attractiveness of the dollar payments. 4. Wells of Amerada has applied for Kuwait visa for visit of three months to negotiate oil lease for Amerada, the Continental Oil Company and Seaboard Oil Company. He may be thinking of endeavouring to obtain lease for sea-bed. Shaikh has approved of grant of visa.

I agree that you should be impartial between British and American Companies. 2. We do not like ? him to offer 40$ royalty or other high percentage royalty associated with a low initial payment and low minimum annual payments ? understood to have been made or considered by some companies. It might have undesirable repercussions else where in the Middle Fast. But we do not think you should advise Shaikh and be drawn into detailed discussion of merits of different bids. If asked you aay however ? point out to Shaikh 'that while a royalty in kind or ad volorem might well suit his books ?we wonder whether a verv high royalty coupled with a lesser initial payment would prove satisfactory to him since; (a) Shaikh's income would be subject to wide fluctuations depending on price of crude oil. (b) He would not have received substantial benefit of a chah down payment which would be particularly favourable for him if no oil in commercial quantities should be discovered. A 40$ royalty would of course be ) very profitable to him while prices are high. But with very big developments ? planned in Middle Fast as a whole it is al^Least a prossibility that Middle Fast crude prices will trend downwards even against a steady world market.

            Resident in the Persian Gulf (William Rupert Hay); the Political Agent at Kuwait (Gordon
            Noel Jackson, Maurice O’Connor Tandy); the India Office (later the Commonwealth
            Relations Office, Eion Pelly Donaldson, Adrian Harbottle Reed, Ralph Ingham Hallows);
            the Foreign Office (Lancelot Frank Lee Pyman); the Ministry of Fuel and Power (William
            Dunmore Monsell-Davies); His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda (Alan Charles Trott); the
            Shaikh of Kuwait (Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ) and various oil companies in relation
            to the auction process instituted by the Shaikh of Kuwait for his share in the
            Kuwait-Saudi Arabia Neutral Zone oil concession.The companies which expressed an interest in bidding for the
            Kuwait neutral zone concession included Petroleum Concessions Limited, the Burmah Oil
            Company, the Eastern Gulf Company, the Amerada Petroleum Company, the American
            Independent Petroleum Corporation, the Superior Oil Company of California and the
            Canadian Eagle Oil Company. However owing to the Shaikh's requirement that
            financial backing and resources to undertake exploitation of an oil concession are
            proven by each potential bidder only four companies were permitted to continue and
            submit final bids on 1 June 1948 – Petroleum Concessions Limited, the Burmah Oil
            Company, the Eastern Gulf Company and the American Independent Petroleum
            Corporation.Other matters discussed in the file include:the question of the political agreement between His
               Majesty’s Government and successful Oil Company and discussing whether such an
               agreement could be made with an American Company and also what changes and special
               requirements would have to be made owing to the concession only being for the Shaikh
               of Kuwait’s share of the neutral zone.a visit paid by the Shaikh of Kuwait to Ibn Saud (‘Abd
               al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd)and the question of whether or not
               the neutral zone was discussed by them.debate around the possibility of a geographic division
               of the neutral zone in order to make administration of the zone easier, and the
               conclusion that negotiations for such a division could take years and would not
               perhaps be in the best interests of the Oil Companies exploiting an oil concession
               there.a hydrographic survey of the coast-line of the neutral
               zone to locate a suitable landing site for heavy equipment.a new air service instituted by Iraq Airways in 1947
