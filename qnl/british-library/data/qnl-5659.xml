WATBRLOW Secretary. 20th June, 1949.********Iji Introduction The economy of Egypt, at the present tirae # rests upon a precarious balance between production t exports and requirements* The possibilities of achieving any outstanding expansion of the first two factors are limited; while the extreme rapidity with \Vhich the population is increasing gives grave cause for anxiety that the basic requirements of the nation may soon outstrip the capacity to meet them* Meanwhile the ever present threat of a fall in the standard of living, due to these basic economic factors, must be seen against the background of social and political restlessness, as the systems of the Moslem, Arab and Turk gradually disintegrate before the impact of Western civilization, leaving an unhealthy vacuum which Communist theories and practice may all too easily fill. An oustending symptom of the unhealthiness of the body politic is the existence within it of great social extremes. In Egypt these extremes have now become dangerous, as they were in Prance on the eve of the Prench Revolution: extremes between the wretched poverty, disease and ignorance of the masses and the great wealth and culture of the few; extremes between modern thought and mediaeval obscuratism, extremes between modern science and industry and traditional primitive practice. Egypt is thus faced with urgent social and economic problems which may require to be handled with the greatest vigour and imagination if a cataclysm is to be avoided. The following paper depicts in brcsd lines the economic situation in Egypt and the problem facing the country, as well as the measures canvassed, adumbrated, contemplated or in some.measure being put into effect by the Government. It is not a very encouraging picture. There is little sign that / the2 the character and scope of the.problem are realised by the Egyptian authorities or, if in a general way realised, that ^ any serious attempt is being made to ascertain the essence i of the 'atter in its fundamental features, or to attack its solution in a thorough -going way. Such measures as exist and are in operation, and such further measures as are projected,couatitute only a piece-meal and ad hoc treatment. There is no indication of a scientilic attempt to ascertain the problem or of long-term planning to cope with it. Even the Nile Waters project can at best only prevent catastrophe by providing that there may be enough cultivable land to maintain at about the present standard of living the size of population which is likely to have been reached by the time the projects are completed. But the population may continue to increase after the point at which no udoioiDnul waoer i^ available. His Majesty’s Government and the United States Government can no doubt help by contributing to assist the realisation of the various existing chart-term projects, and thus to mitigate the symptons of the sickness. But a much more funComontal treat ment of the matter seems to be called for if our help is to be more than tinkering with the problem, and w&gt; shall need to watch careiully for the point where help on such a basis vouid merely amount to throwing gaod money and exxort do^n *xhe clr-'in# It seem that we still have bo ascertain what is the b^^&gt;ic cause of Egypt’s predicament. That done, ib will be necesoc-ry to draw up a long-term plan for dealing with it. This will probably have to include some means oi remeo.ying or counter acting the defects of Egyptian character referred to in the last paragraph of the paper, or the ej.focts Oo. these delects. ^ut in all this, account must be taken ox the acute sensitiveness nf the Egyptians, which . akes it a difxicult matter to give advice or help unless they xirst ask xor it. me Egyptian loreign /Minister■r' 3. Keister has no'xv made an initial approach to His Majesty's Government for assistance in social reform and economic development. He has accordingly been advised by the Foreign Secretary to consult the Head of the British Middle East Office re 2 ar dinn; the preparation of a long-term and comprehensive plan. It is therefore suggested that the recommendations in this paper should be regarded as the draft brief for Sir J.Troutoeck for his discussions with the Egyptian Government. II. Population. The 1937 answer showed a total population of 18.9 millions. The 1947c&amp;n is records an increase of 3*1 millions, bringing the total to 19.01 millions. This increase of 19. 8/0 in ten years may be compared with the increase during the period 1927'* 37, which amounted to 12.1 &gt; 6 . The Egyptian birth rate, 40 per 1000, is the highest in the world after the Palestinian. The death rate, over 26 per 1000 , is the highest in the world. Infant mentality is appallingly high. Measures now being taken or proposed to improve health services will result, it is hoped* in the lowering of the death rate, and the rate of • population increase may therefore be expected to accelerate. Meanwhile, Egypt is already the most densely populated eountry in the world, and as will be shown, the possibilities of expanding the country's income are limited. /Ill4* Ill Agriculture , The economj'- of the country is predominantly agricultural. Some 70^o of the population, or about 12 million at the present ^ time, are engaged on agriculture. During the past 25 years the totalaa-ltiwted area has remained static at about 6 million acres (the total crop area has however been increased to about 9 million acres as a result of the transition from the basic system of irrigation to perennial irrigation). The possibilities of expanding the cultivated. area,and the action at present planned, may be summarised as follows: (i) Extension of the cultivable .area . (a) N ile Waters projects . The greatest single contribution will undoubtedly be made by the three projects to be executed outside the borders of Egypt, namely the comprehensive Nile Waters schemes involving dams on the Blue Nile at Lake Tana, on the Equatorial Nile just below Lakes Victoria and Albert together with the cutting of a canal through the Sudd and other works, and in the Northern Sudan# The Egyptian Government has voted £S 4-g- million for part of the cost of the dam at Owen Palls near Lake Victoria and to cover compensation for disturbance on the Lake shores when the level is raised. It is calculated that this project will add one million acres to the area at present under cultivation in Egypt, and will facilitate the raising of more crops on the land at present under basin irrigation. As much of the land is march or salty and will have to be reclaimed, the full effect of this scheme, however, may not be felt fully for about 20 years, ■(b) Qena project . Of possible more immediate realisation is a plan, evolved in recent months, to bore tube wells in the basin- irrigated lands of the Qena and Aswan provinces of Upper Egypt so as to tap Underground resources of water and use it for perennial irrigation. The first stage of the scheme would consistcon r ist .In tho orcction of an Sloctric Power Station at Qcna&gt; ^ v/ith its sub-s tat ions, to supply. 500 pumping units over an area of 1^5,000 acres* T-his stage would take 5 years# The second stage (also of 5 years) would involve the installation of 500 other units in the remaining 125,000 acres covered hy the scheme, power for which would he supplied hy the hydro electric power station at Asv/an* The present supplies of water at low Nile do not permit the. conversion of this area, which extends to about 1 million acres, to perennial irrigation. More over, this conversion is not possible until full control of the Nile flood is secured hy works further upstream, as the basins are a safety valve in years of high floods. The Egyptian Government hope to obtain a loan for this purpose from the' International Bank and a team of experts from the Bank has just visited Agypt to stud 3 r the scheme which we ourselves have recommended to the President of the International Bank. The Egyptian Government estimate the cost of the Qena Project (250,000 acres) at about £S 8 millions, of which some £E 5 millions would be spent on imported equipment and the rest locally-on labour, etc. l n our view it is likely that this estimate is considerably inflated. (c; other schemes under consideration hut not yet worked out in detail: (i) tho sinking of wells in the coastB.1 holt of tho western desert; (ii) tho irrigation of areas in the western desert hy canals dug from tho Kile; (iii) the tapping and control of sources of artesian and sub-artesian water in the cr.rr:\s of Kharga and Be.khla, (the total area of those oasis is roughly equal to the total cultivated area of Egypt). Parafra and Baharia. which would reclaim considerable areas if cultivators from the Nile Valley could ho persuaded to emigrate there and if conWnications were improved.(iii) 6o (ii) In crease of production in the existing cultivated aroa ^. This can he achieved hy:~ (a) in a relatively small region - converting from ^ u h_asis H irrigation (the land being irrigated once a year, when the Nile Is in flood) to perennial irrigation , permitting more than one crop to he raised in a yoar 0 But the '‘basins’ 1 , which cover about 1 million acres, cannot be converted to perennial irrigation until complete flood control of the Nile further upstream has been instituted. At the moment they represent a safety valve in years of high Nile. . ) Inc reased use of ferti lisers . At the moment crop yields are below pro - v/ar levels owing mainly to the land having been starved of fertiliser during the war. Before the war imports of nitrates and superphosphates averagec about 500,0C0 tons per annum with a value of about £3 millions. The net increment clue to the utilisation of fertilisers was estimated at £11—12 million per annum. A nitrogenous fertiliser factory now building at Suez (with a loan of # 7 millions from the Import-Export Bank) will, when it goes into production in two or three years’ time, go a long way towards making the country independent of imports; and plans have been sketched for another factory to be built using the electricity generated at the Aswan dam: this project is un likely to come to fruition for some ten years. The possibilities of expanding production by means of mechanisation are probably limited, owina to the small size of th&lt; agricultural holdings and the availability of surplus labour for for cultivation by the primitive but effective methods at present used. Moreover, statistics collected in 193V indicate that grose returns are highest on tho large estates may actually p. 78. ) small farm, and that the breaking up of increase efficiency. (lssawi,opp cit.7 « (iii) Crop production, imports and exports #. i . • The perconta^c of land cultivatod -under the main crops in 1935-.. and 1945 was as follows: 1935 1945 Co. t ton 20.7' 10*7 Maize 19. 6 20. 5 Wheat 17. 5 1 18.0 Beans 5.2 4. 3 Rice 5. 8 6.9 Cotton and whoat atfc the fellah’s main cash crops* The area under cotton was more than halved during the war to make possible increased food production, it has now risen to nearly its pre-war level* Exports similarly nearly reached the 1938-39 level ( • tons) in 1948 tons). The price has increased sixfold' and constituted 80^ of the total exports by value last year. Before the v/ar Egypt did not normally import wheat, since the war however, imports at a rate of tons per annum costing approximately £ have been necessary, partly because of low' yields due to lack of fertiliser, and partly because of increased consumption, largely hy the ex panding urban population. The area under rice has now been nearly doubled since before the war to meet the present world demand ( tons were exported in 1948 at a cost of £ ) and the price has increased sixfold* An increase of 201^ in the average prices, of crops has taken place since 1938-39, resulting in an increase of 144^ on the average revenue per acre* The maintenance of this increase is very largely dependent on the ability of Egypt to export her cotton and rice at substantially present prices. There is likely to be a v/orld demand for Egypt’s surplus rice for some time* ButIV 8 . But there is less, certainty about the maintenance of existing cotton prices and.there are indications of a likely heavy fall in world raw cotton prices when normal conditions in textile markets are restored. Moreover, Egypt is now having to comp-+,e not only with increased production of cotton in other countries, such as Russia, China, Brazil and British Africa, including production of long staple varieties - hitherto h£E own monopoly - but also with the development of substitute fabrics such as rayon and nylon. It is therefore of the greatest importance that her present excessive dependents on cotton exports shall be reduced by expanding production and export of other commodities. Charles Issawi in his book; Egypt; an Economic and Social Analysis 11 points out that the soil of Egypt is much too precious to be wasted on wheat and maize which should be left to countries practising extensive cultivation like Australia and the ArgentineV and suggests that J^gypt should aim at expanding production of flax soya beans, jute, fruit, vegetables and dairy products. ''At present the coum,rfr is cotton minded. Hence the admirable cotton research and cottoa credit facilities. it must become fruit minded and dairy minded'. This will involve the development of (a) research facilities; (b) canning and dairying industries, which might require government help; and (c) credit facilities. The Egyptian Government is now making a beginning by setting up a system of agricultural and animal husbandry centres on what appears to be sound lines.IV Industry and Minings Industrial production in Egypt is mainly confined to to food processing, -light industries such.as textiles tobacco and footwear and cement, and petroleum and superphosphates* Industrial activity in Egypt, which began expanding some twenty years ago and was greatly intensified during the war, has continued this tendency in the last four years. Many new textile mills have been opened, and other new enterprises include the manufacture of plastic wares, chemical fertilisers, oxygen and acetylene, metal working and founding, while there are in course of erection a large nitrogenous fertiliser factory and three small steelworks. Some of the smaller • concerns established during the war have either gone out of business or are finding difficulty in meeting the competition of imported goods, and owing to the high price of Egyptian cotton difficulties ore arising in the textile industry, which now supplies a great proportion of the country’s requirements in medium and low-priced goods and in addition has a certain surplus available for export; but the larger concerns, such as those of the Misr groups, are unlikely to be seriously affected./ In some cases of recently established industries it is clear that there was a lack of realistic planning in relation to the probable capacity of the market once the war-time scarcity of consumer goods had disappeared. The development of rural industries depends mainly on organisation, and the Government informed F.A.O. in February, 1948 that the promotion of rural industries was included in their long term plan for raising the standard of living of the fellah; but nothing has materialised as yet, apart from some interest shown by the Government in encouraging rug and carpet-making and hand-woven textiles. /Industrial.f - 10 - Industrial production in 1948 was estimated at about £.E.167 millions, or almost equivalent to the value of all^ imports from abroad in. that year (which, incidentally, were five times the pre-war value). Capital invested in industry and commerce is now in the region of £.iii.l25 millions, with reserves of about £.E.50 millions. A measure of the con- ♦ ■ ' . .. . ■ • • tribution of this movement of industrialisation towards the problem of providing fuller employment for the population as a whole is given by the relatively modest figure of 450,000 the official estimate of the total number of employees of all grades in Egyptian industry. If mining and housing is included the figure is about 750 , 000 . Petroleum production ( tons in 1948) is sufficient for all domestic requirements except kerosene. Some 500,000 tons of phosphates 200,000 tons of low grade manganese and 200,000 tons of salt per annum are produced. The con struction of a hydro—electric power station at the Aswan dam has now begun. The utilisation of some of the power to be generated for the production of nitrogenous fertilisers has been contemplated for many years, and an international commission was asked in 1947 to report on the possibilities. The Government appears to have decided in principle that this scneme shall be realised, but no plans have been elaborated. bince the earliest date mentioned for the beginning of generation of power at Aswan is 1953, full operation of the station will probably not begin before 1955 , fertiliser production is an even more remote project* In 1937 iron ore deposits estimated at 1,000 million tons of high grade ore, were discovered near Aswan. Another international commission visited Egypt in February .1949 to study the economic possibility of utilising Aswan-generated electric power in smelting the ore with a view to economising /coke.••r coke. Another body of opinion within the Government favours normal blast furnace practice, with steelworks probably on the coast or at an existing port. Here again no detailed plans have been made, and the widely—advertised project may possibly be shelved* There have been several comparatively promising new strikes of oil in the past year, but the expansion of refinery capacity by Anglo-Egyptian Oilfields Limited (Shell) to exploit them to the utmost is held up by Government obstruction over leases of land, and restrictive legislation. The Government T s own refinery is to be extended, tenders having been invited for the supply of the necessary equipment. The Government have ruled that no crude oil is to be exported# but their restrictive legislation is discouraging the foreign companies who have found the oil from refining it in Egypt. Meanwhile, the expansion of Egyptian industry is limited by 4 factors: (a) Shortage of skilled labour and inefficient labour management. (; The productivity of the average Egyptian remained low.. Harold Whitehead and Company, the British industrial consultants, who were commissioned by the Egyptian Government in 1948 to advise on industrial efficiency recommended:- (1) the development of a 'worksmanager' class to fill the present gap between managing director and tech nicians ; ( 2 ) introduction of costing systems; ( 3 ) more human approach to personnel management; ( 4 ) attempts to raise the standard of supervision and discipline among foremen; % ( 5 ) application of stricter discipline to labour to coincide with higher wages and increased stability. /The •••The general consensus of opinion is that it ,is chiefly in foremanship that Egyptian industry falls short and that it is at this level that increased training is needed* The British Training Within Industry scheme is becoming known in one or two places, and a scheme some- ..'..it ‘ . ... «. * * * *• . ' f thing on these lines might have great possibilities in Egypt, (b) Absence of raw materials. Prom this point of view industrial development should be concentrated on agricultural processing industries and mining; (c) Shortage.of capital; and (d) Absence of an internal market. /This,.•J ~ - 13 ~ This maybe considered the currant factor in the situation. Since the possibilities of export on any large scale must be slight for some time to come, the pace of industrialisation is set by the size of the rural market. As long as Egypt has a semi-feudal rural economy, and as long as the needs •f the mass of her inhabitants for industrial goods are limited to a few gallons of kerosene, a few kilograms of sugar, a few yards of cotton cloth and a few pounds of tobacco, there is no scope for a modern capitalist industry. As it is, the present inequality of land distribution deprives industry of even the clientele of the rich* who prefer to buy foreign goods. At this point the argument may be recapitualted as follows: Egyptian agriculture carries a large surplus population, whose presence is seriously depressing the standard oi living. Furthermore, cotton prospects are poor and it has become necessaiy for agriculture to develop other branches of production. The ©nly important ones available are livestock, dairy-farming and fruit and vegetable production. But although a certain amount of export may be possible, these branches will have t# rely mainly on the home market. Such a market can only come intr* being if a large industry is built up. But industry in its turn is conditioned by the rural market, which in its present form cannot absorb more than a very small output of industrial goods. /The..•The solution of this vicious circle comes inevitably to the mind: the break-up of the large estates into family farms of about four feddans, the modification of inheritance laws to prevent further subdivision below that level and ' e development of co-operatives togive the farmers the benefit of technical improvements and collective work. •-16- VI. The Social problem : (i) Individual poverty. The Social problem is implicit in the economic ie* In the first place, the standard of living, measured by the quantity of commodities available for the mass of the population, is slowly • but surely declining. In the second place, there is growing unemployment, latent if not apparent. With the constant increase of the rural population - some 7 Q£ to 80 ^ of the total - agriculture is being progressively overloaded with a redundant labour force: it is estimated that this amounts to about two fifths of the rural population, or 2 j million people. As a result, the cash return to labour must continually fall unless prices can continually rise. Prices of Egyptian agricultural produce have in fact risen three to four times on the average compared with pre-war days. World prices of cereals have, of course, risen even higher, but the Egyptian Government limited the price of home-grown cereals in an attempt to check the rise in the cost of living, now nearly three times what it was in 1939. Meanwhile farm wages (and the great bulk of the 4 , 300,000 persons employed in agriculture including those privately registered as landowners or tenants, work for wages) have risen 2i times. Rents have also risen. Thus, although the cash return to cultivators is higher than before the war, it has not, generally speaking, kept pace with the rise in the cost of living, so that their real income is falling. The rural population is therefore suffering a progressive improverishment, and this process may be drastically increased if world prices of cotton, and cereals / werewere to fall seriously. (ii) Unemployment In addition to the latent unempbyment implicit in this situation there is a certain amount of real unemployment, though much less than might be expected. During the war many thousands of hands were employed by the British and allied forces in workshops and in ancillary occupations, while many others worked in small factories (largely closed since then) set up to produce articles of which imports were restricted by the war. Many of these workers came from country districts and most of these have apparently been re-absorbed into the rural community. Others have found work in the numerous factories, mainly textile, which have been started since the war and which are still in the main working three shifts a day. There appears, however, to be a certain floating mass of labour in the towns, in the main casually employed, which may well increase owing to an incipient depression in the textile industry due to the high price of raw cotton. In the absence ol any efticient system of unemployment registration and labour exchanges no reliable figure can be given; and, owing to the ability of Egyptian workmen to make a scant living from odd jobs, to live on their relatives in hard times, etc*, the number of wholly unemployed is probably small. Officials of the responsible Egyptian Government Department, when questioned on the subject, invariably insist that there is no unemployment problem in the sense that it is. understood in Western Europe, i.e. a large mass of qualified workers thrown out of employmecfc and liable to be an unsettling factor in the urban / population- 18 - population. (iii) Land Tenure. Figures of gross output compiled by the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture give £E100 million as the value of the gross output of Egyptian agriculture in 1939, which would give a gross output of £E20 per acre. Thus it is possible for a peasant farmer to live off a farm of 2 acres, with a gross income of £E40 per annum, which may correspond to a net income of, say £E30 per annum. If, therefore, the gross income from agriculture were to be equally distributed between the 12 million farm population, it would give a level of gross income of £E 8 per head or £E40 per family; if, that is to say, the land were equally distributed, and each family owned 2 acres of land, it would be possible for the population to exist on a stan dard which, though very low, would yet be adequate in regard to food. However, the distribution of landownership is extremely unequal, and three-quarters of the 4 million actively occupied in agriculture do not own even as much as one acre. The class of snail proprietors up to one acre are also employed as part-time labourers. Thus over 3 million of the 4 million actively occupied are either landless or own only tiny areas less than half an acre in extent. 37 per cent of the land is owned by large proprietors with • estates over 50 acres, 30 per cent by medium proprietors with farms from 5 t 0 50 acres, and 32 per cent by farmers owning under 5 acres. With the increase in population, the class of the small properties has increased far more rapidly / than-19- than the other classes; between 1905 and 1940 their numbers increased by 133 per cent, while the area in the under 5 acre class has increased by 50 per cent. Most of this increase has been in the area of farms under 4 % one acre, that is, in the sise. of farm which does not provide a minimum subsistence level. Thus the increase of population has added to the number of landless or sub-landed peasants. The growth of this class has reduced the size of the medium-sized peasant farms, and has nibbled away.from the area under large estates. The other classes have remained roughly the same. Land Reform. The Ministry of Social Affairs have had on their own files for some years two associated plans (l) to control land rent by fixing a maximum which is quoted variously as 12 , 14 cr 16 times the land-tax, ( 2 ) to fix minimum agricultural wages at a subsistence level to be determined by local committees. These two plans are inter-dependent and are necessary to prevent the landowners from escaping the effects of reform by transferring the working of the land from tenants to themselves, or vice versa. The Ministry think the time is opportune to revive these projects, and expect less opposition from land-owning interests in Parliament than there would have been, -say two years ago. . • * Mustafa Marei Bey, Minister of'State, announced / at/ (iv) - 20 - at the beginning of April 19U9t the preparation of a Bill aimed at reducing land - rents. .He describe.d the Bill as-one of the most important ever considered- in the way of social reform. ^ further step in the same direction, though of limited application owing to the relatively small total area •of land available for distribution, aims at the creation of a class of land-owning peasants. A bill which has reached the Committee stage • at the Senate, provides'that any state-owned agricultural land which has been reclaimed should not be sold to landowners, but should go in plots., of 3 to 5 acres complete with a house either to landless fellahin or to landless diplomes of the agricultural schools with interest-free loans , repayable over thirty—years to buy implements, seed and beasts. A distribution of 3000 acres in Gharbia on these lines was actually made ini March 1948, allegedly as a result of King Parouk's personal intervention# It can be accepted that this is now a firm item of Government policy, but any enthusiasm must be tempered by the fact that no land is being reclaimed in Upper Egypt. However, we have been assured that land reclamation schemes have priority, and that between 20,000 and . 50,000 acres can be turned over each year. There is a danger that this measure, although genuine in conception, may be exaggerated for purposes of political propaganda.- 21 - (iv) Public Health . ' The population of Egypt is debilitated by endemic diseases. ^ 75/- of the population are chronically infected with bilharzias, and 90/ with trachoma. Malaria, hooksores are also v/idely prevalent. The Ministry of Public Health’s Annual Budget of about £E12,000,000 is much larger than the Annual Budget of the Health Services of all other Middle East countries combined. The Ministry have c satisfactory programme of hospital construction which aims at providing a 500 -bedded general hospital for each province headquarters, a 100 -bedded hospital for each district headquarters, and one rural health centre for every 15,000 people. In addition there are hospitals for special diseases including one of the finest ophthalmic diseases organisation in the world. .This programme is being steadily carried out and at the present time the Egyptian Authorities aim at building one 500-bedded hospital a year and a number of district hospitals and rural health centres. A very fine hospital in Mansurah has just been completed. There is no lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Ministry and no lack of finance. Every effort is being made to increase the number of doctors, but a*t the present time the building programme as regards, rural health centres tends to get ahead of the supply of doctors to staff them. , The Egyptian Authorities have realised for some time that more doctors are required and within the last eight years have increased the Faculties of Medicine in Egypt from one to three, which is resulting in a considerable increase in the number of doctors which qualify every year. The number of doctors at present in Egypt is somewhere between 4 and 5 thousand of whom between 1,500 and 2,000 are in the Ministry of Public Health. : .The number of doctors in Egypt is already far greater than that in all the other Middle Eastern countries combined, but the Egyptian Authorities intend to increase the number to about 8,000 as soon as possible. Tho defects of the hospital administration/t -22- administration in Egypt at present are entirely due to bad human relations and low ethical standards, u Man f s iriiuuxnity to Man M and the abuse of authority are all too prevalent. Steps are being taken to remedy these failings as far as possible by increasing the number of British doctors teaching in the Faculties of Medicine and by ^ reorganizing the nursing services and increasing enormously the number of British Sisters. The Egyptian Authorities have' created over 90 vacancies for British Sisters and have recently engaged a British Nursing Adviser to reorganize and control their Nursing Services. The preventive health services are of a high standard and compare favourably with other comparable countries - particularly as regards the prevention of endemic diseases and child welfare. The Government plan to construct 1,200 village health centres throughout the country. About 80 of these had been constructed by the end of 1948 and 30 more were planned for 1949 * but several sta id empty due to lack of doctors and nurses to run them. Pure Drinking Water sunnlios . This project, of first importance from the point of view of improving the health of the rural population, was forced into first place by the 1947 cholera epidemic. The sum of £E3i* millions allocated for this purpose in 1946 appears to be quite inadequate. A contract was recently placed for the completion of one of the five large waterv/orks, with its network of mains, to be erected in the Delta, and tenders were due to be opened for a second such project in the early part of 1949 . In addition to these large schemes in the northern part of the Delta, pure water is being provided in other parts of the country from wells sunk in the villages and provided with powered pumping sets. About 2,000 of these will be required eventually, in addition to over 12,000 wells equipped with hand pumps. There should be no difficulty in meeting Egypt*s requirements of pumps from the United Kingdom, but the present world supply of pipes is likely to hold up the realisation of this scheme. Nevertheless a responsible official in the Ministry of Public Health stated some months ago that the percentage of the rural population supplied with pure drinking water had been raised in the last three years or so from 25 / to 40^6 H.M.G. has agreed to contribute £E2 millions out of the profits of the Anglo-Egyptian Cotton Buying Commissions of 1940-41 to the cost of the village drinking water scheme on condition that the Egyptian Government make equal contributions. The Egyptian Government has not yet asked for any of this money to be handed over. (v)/* -23- (v) Housing* A Workers' City is being built at Smbabeh, a suburb of Cairo, the target of which is 6,650 houses. Work started t~&gt;aras the end of 1947 , and about 600 have been completed, while a total of 1,000 will, it is hoped, be ready by October, 1949. The cost to date has been in the region of £.E.4i millions. Another project which is receiving study is one put forward by the Ministry of Social Affairs, which proposes a 10 -year plan for the construction of 40,000 town dwellings and 100,000 country dwellings annually at a cost of ^E .16 millions. Under this plan the Government would raise the money by an internal loan at 2 -J to 3 P er cent and make advances of up to two-thirds to any organisation prepared to build dwellings of the type required. Priority in the allocation of the town dwellings would go to f?^milies with incomes below £.2.9 per month. Where possible new housing estates should be built on state-owned land; all possible methods of carrying out the plan should be used, such as a special building corporation with fixed interest rates, formation of co-operative building societies, assistance to industrial companies prepared to build housing for their workers. Little serious consideration seems to have been given hitherto to the availability of materials or labour or to the question of the control of the luxury building which has been so evident in Egypt in the last two years, but the Egyptian authorities have stated that largo quantities of iron, steel and timber are now being purchased from abroad. While there is little probability of the programme reaching the figures stated, it is satisfying that housing has at last become a subject of public policy, and it seems that the provision of finance, at any rate, is not to be allowed to be an obstacle to any measures which are practicable from other aspects. (vi)(Vi) Social Insurance . In January 1947 two I.L,0. experts elaborated an actuarially- possible scheme giving at first pensions insurance and later sickness benefit to industrial and commercial workers in the most highly-developed areas in ]Sgypt, The Government has continually promised to bring in this scheme, and a final version of a bill was approved by the Higher Labour Council at the end of 1948, but the project has again boon shelved by the Undor Secretary of State at the Ministry of Social Affairs who wishes to investigate the possibility of a universal non-contributory pensions scheme paid from the national exchequer, H.M. Smbassy have continually emphasized that the success of any scheme is dependent on efficient administration, and before the project was shelved, had arranged for four men to go to England for up to six months* training with the Ministry of National Insurance, An interesting sidelight is that the Higher L^b^ur Council found it necessary, in order to keep the scheme out of politics and the doldrums of Egyptian Government Service to recommend that it should be run by an autonomous board* (vii) Indu strial Welfare r There has been striking progress in this field recently but chiefly owing to the initiative of the bigger employers, some of whom have preferred to apply their profits in this field instead of having them taken in Excess Profits Tax. E^pl^yers are finding that it is generally in their own interest to provide welfare services which help to give them a more settled labour force. The. Government is attempting to encourage this movement, even to the extent of wishing to impose on employers services wnich should be a government responsibility, a.g, housing, medical services, transport; but they can scarcely take credit for what has already been done by industry^ (viii) Rur al Welfare, Since 1945 there, have been proposals to impose certain obligations on land-owners for the provision of social and health services for their workers and tenants. Legislation was promised in the speech from the throne in November 1947 but has not yet been passedo / (ix)(ix) Go-operation, Jj'or three years the Government has had a plan for the creation of a co-operative bank, but it has not yet come into existence# The present proposal is that the Agricultural Credit Bank should be expanded so that it can finance co-operative societies, but this bank*is not truly co-operative but only a modified form of joint-stock bank. (x) Labour Policy # After a considerable spate of legislation since 1942 the general feeling is that enough has been done for industrial and commercial workers for the time being; as far as any wage policy can be said to exist, it is that wages should be raised by prosperous firms; no attempt is made to raise the standard of wages generally in small concerns or to improve the enforcement of existing labour legislation. There is no constructive work in the way of employment service, vocational guidance, training, rehabilitation or manpower-planning; the Labour Department works almost entirely without statistics# (xi) Trade Unions# The Government have supported individual trade unions particularly in disputes against foreign employers; but they have-shown no desire to encourage the formation of a responsible national trade union movement; federations and confederations are still opposed# The only Government plans that exist are for the development of the welfare side of union activities; the Ministry of Social Affairs hope to form a trade union advisory branch to help unions (whose officials are in many cases scarcely literate and know little of office procedure) in administration; dependent on this is a proposal for which finance has yet to be agreed that the Government should subsidise the unions in the provision of clinics, sickness benefit etc. There is some hope in this proposal if the right advisory staff can be found, but the way in which the present fund for rewarding efficient trade unions/ (xii) - 26 - is administered' does not encourage trade unionists to expect too much. The general picture is therefore of a good deal ot un- coordinated thought and aiacuasion, some realistic and some unrealistic. The desire to raise the standard of living is in the air and all the leading personalities of Egypt at least lip service to it; their declarations may often be more genuine than' one would expect although occasionally they' are marred by an admission that reform is only conceived as defence against Communism; it is in the realisation of this general desire that Egypt fails. The co-ordinated knowledge of economic and sociological factors is lacking, and the absence of an exact scientific, mathematical outlook makes any planning unrealistic; ani above all there is a lack of drive and energy. None of these proposals appear to call for any large sums of foreign currency with the possible exception cl the uoman^ for timber for a housing programme; and until ministries spend the modest amounts already voted to them for these various projects social needs can scarcely be advanced as an argument for more foreign currency*.\ -27- (xii) Education Sinoo achieving independence the Egyptian Government ho._i embarked on a vast educational programme# The Constitution enacts that education must be free and compulsory for all children between 7 and 12. As a result about a million children, or 40% of the children between these ages, now attend elementary schools. In addition in 1939 about 230,000 children (including 83*000 girls) attended Government primary, secondary and high schools and about 320,000 children attend private schools. -^Syp^iQ-ri education suffers from the following defects: (a) The Government schools are rigidly over-centralised. (b) There is an undue concentration on classical Arabic and inadequate attention is given to practical sciences. (c) There is a great shortage of teachers and their standard is low. •(d) Elementary school children are debarred from entering primary or secondary schools. (o) The system is top-heavy; there is a disproportionate number of University students to the number of elementary school children and though the standard of teaching at the Universities is high (as a result of importing foreign professors at great expense) the students are too ill-prepared to take full advantage of their learning. The whole system of Egyptian education therefore needs overhauling. The importance of improving and expanding the education of the common piecple cannot be overstressed, since from the long-term point of view it is only by such measures and the abolition of child labour (which cotton production encourages) female education, mass education, the provision of /amenities- 28 - | —^ . ■ amanities and racraatione in tha villagas, ato,, that Egypt’s vital problem Lf overpopulation, poverty and squalor can be effectively tackled. It is understood that the Egyptian Government are planning to spend £10 millions on new schools in the next 5 or 10 years, and that since 1946 many new schools have already been opened* VII Egyptian Five-Year Plan . The ^nly overall development plan produced by the Egyptian Government is the so-called Five-Year Plan* prepared in 1 945 and approved in 1946. Whatever may have been the intention at the outset, this plan has not worked out like similar plans .rawn up in other countries. It was in fact little more than a list of classes of development work considered desirable or necessary, with some of the more important projects individually mentioned. A total of £.E.96 millions was to be provided, £.E.46 millions out of the General Reserve and the remainder out of current revenue in five equal yearly instalments. It was left to the responsible Government Departments to draw up and execute plans for individual projects. As far as can be ascertained no surveys of the progress of work under this plan have been made, and it is thus difficult to assess the extent to which it has been completed, though a certain amount of progress is known to have been made. In any case the calculations must have been thrown completely out by the rise in prices of Imported capital equipment which has taken plqce in the last four years. Moreover, other projects have forced themselves on the attention of the Government owing to changing circumstances, and events such as the cholera epidemic in the autumn uf 1947 prcfcably necessitated /shifts-29- shifts in priority. . Of the total sum of £.E#46 millions to be provided out of the General Reserve, Parliament in July, 1946 allocated £.E. 22 ^: millions as follows: — £. E. 4 millions. £.E.2 millions. £•E ,2 millions £.E.1^ millions £.E .6 millions. (1) Roads ( 2 ) Reclamation of swamp lands (3) Cairo main drainage (JjO Schools and Hospitals (5) Irrigation and Drainage ( 6 ) Pure Drinking water supplies £.E.3i millions (7) Agricultural schemes £.E. 1.7 millions ( 8 ) Other projects about £.E.2 millions. Another sum of £,E.7.8 millions was set aside out of the General Reserve in July 1947, while a total of £.E.24 millions has been allocated out of current revenue in the three financial years 1946-7“‘8 and 1948 - 9 , i*e. somewhat less than the annual sum of £.E.10 millions foresoon.- 1 - SYRIA INTRODUCTION The natural resources of Syria are such that agriculture is and will continue to be the basis of her economy, A prosperous and progressive agriculture must therefore be the cardinal aim of any plan for Syria’s economic development. Agriculture provides a livelihood for two thirds of the population. It produces the basic raw materials for Syria's industries. Its products form the major part of Syria's export trade and provide the foods that maintain the health and well-being of the people. Syria's water resources represent an untapped source of weaXtH which, if turned to account, could play a very big part in the economic prosperity of the country. In the Jezira, lying in the North-iiast between the Suphrates and the Turkish and Iraqi frontiers, Syria possesses an area of out standing development possibilities, both for rain-fed and irrigated agriculture, ranking with the Gedaref district of the Sudan, the Tigris and Euphrates Valleys in Iraq, and the Karun in Khuzistan. The total cultivable lands of Syria would however require for their exploitation a rural population of nearly 5 millions, or more than double the present‘agricultural population. There is therefore in Syria as a whole, and in the Jezira in particular, a unique opportunity for settlement and development. Meanwhile, within her borders and in’ nearby countries, some hundreds of thousands of workless and landless Palestinian Arab refugees are herded in camps, subsisting on relief, to which the United Kingdom and the United States Governments have been the principal contributors. Substantial outside assistance will be required for any large-scale scheme for the resettlement of /thethe refugees, and the practical, political, economic and social difficulties are not to be underestimated. But the plight of the refugees presents an opportunity which Syria might well turn to good account. % POLITICAL . Syria, like ether Arab States, was left in a state of demoralisation and impoverishment by the Palestine war. Her impoverishment was aggravated by the burden of the refugees and by mismanagment of her finances. The stage was set for the emergence of some new force to assume leadership. Little was Known of Husni el Zaim at the time of the coup d 1 etat . He is a Kurd and has made his career in the Army, His coup was carried out with surprising speed and efficiency but, whilst he secured a vote of confidence from a little over half the Chamber of Deputies, it was only with great difficulty that he succeeded in persuading any of its members to form a G-overnment with him. His Government was recognised by the United States, Krance and ourselves on 27th April. Zaim has stated that he does not propose to alter the foreign policy of his predecessor and that his i*!ret objectives, after an armistice with Israel, are the composing of the differences with the Lebanon and the encouragement of foreign capital investment for the construction of pipe lines. He has now signed a legislative decree ratifying the Pranco—Syrian Monetary Convention negotiated by the previous Government. The agreement with the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company was ratified on 18th May and Zaim has made it Known that he hopes shortly to sign the proposed agreement with the Middle Bast Pipe-line Company and to come to terms with the Iraq Petroleum Company in regard to their proposed pipe* line and the terminal on the Syrian coast. (a) Anglo-French Relation s In the past we have had to be careful not to press the /SyriansSyrians too strongly to accept British advice lor Tear or offending French susceptibilities, -‘•his consideration has however now almost ceased to apply. The Syrian Government employed a British firm (Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners) in 1947 to rnaHe an economic survey of the # country. In the same year they engaged a British expert to review their system of taxation system, and they also employed several American agricultural experts. Reports have been made to the Syrian Government by the Agricultural, Health, Labour, Forestry and Soil Conservation, and Statistical Advisers of the British Middle East Office. Early this year an. unofficial Syrian envoy visited London to enquire about possible military and economic aid from this country while a request has been made for British matrons and nurses for appointment in Syrian hospitals. French influence in the Syrian educational system has now virtually disappeared and there are no longer any Frenchmen employed in any of the University faculties or Government secondary schools. There is a possibility that the present Vice-President of the American University at Beirut may be appointed Rector of the University at Damascus and that teaching in most Faculties will henceforth be conducted in English. 3 , pcpQLftTfcM ^he population of Syria was estimated in 1944 at 2 , 901,000 of whom 71.5 % were classified as rural. The non— sedentary population consisted at that date of about 150,000 nomads and about 150,000 semi-sedentary persons, bringing the total up to about 3,201,000. The rate of population increase is 22 % and the estimated total population in 1954 is 3 , 625 , 000 . 4. AREA The total area of Syria is about 57,000 square miles (or about 37 million acres), of which about 15 % (or 5.5 million acres) is at present under cultivation. About one third of the cultivated area is normally allowed to lie fallow each year. Approximately 13 % of the 5.5 million acres of cultivated land is irrigated.- 4 - 5. A GRICULTURE Syria.*s rural population is insufrlcient to all the arable lands. Less than half the area potentially cultivafTT/s is now under cultivation. In order to achieve full cultivation, with the present system of agriculture, more than twice the present population would be needed. In the Jesira and the Euphrates Valley especially, rich lands remain undeveloped for lack of labour. Syria is well endowed with natural water supplies. The Euphrates and its major tributary, the Khabur, water a large area in the East, whilst the Orontes is the largest of several rivers in the V;est. Except for pump schemes in the Jezira and the canal scheme which irrigates the Damascus oasis, little has been done to promote irrigation. Rainfall is limited over the entire country to the winter months (October - April) and the amount ol rainfall is subject to considerable fluctuation. This dependence on fainfall results not only in marked fluctuations in the year- by-year productivity of agricultire but also restricts the range of crops. The extension of irrigation is therefore of first importance. The present irrigated area could be more than doubled, from 710,000 acres to about 1 , 500,000 acres. More-over, the yield per acre could be raised considerably through improvement in methods, techniques and the introduction of better animal breeds and plant varieties. Any improvement in agricultural technique will depend first of all, however on the expansion and overhaul of agricultural education. (a) Irrigation The areas available for irrigation development are: / (a)- 5 - (a) the Yarmuk Basin (the Mzerib Project); (b) the Orontes Basin (from the Lebanese-Syrian frontier to Acharne in the Ghab Depression); (c) the Orontes Basin (in the Ghab Depression after drainage); (d) the Euphrates Valley (from Meskeneh to Raqqa); (e) the Euphrates Valley (from Deir-ez-Zor to Abou Kemal); (f) the Euphrates Valley (from a weir in the Halabiya Gorge); (g) The Khabur Valley (the Canal A project, with its headworks at Tel Maghass). Except for the projects described under (d) and (e), which would require only a small capital outlay for the purchase of pumps and the construction of distribution canals and similar minor works, the various irrigation schemes listed above would involve considerable capital expenditure. (b) Drainage Apart from development by irrigation, there are also a number of areas which by drainage would provide rich and fertile lands for cultivation. The drainage of some of these lands would have the added advantage of removing the breeding- ground of the malaria-carrying mosquito and improving the health of the people. Among them are the Mzerib, Awaj and Barada flood wastes in Southern Syria, and the huge areas of the Ghab Depression, the Roudj swamp axl the Qouaik marshes South of Aleppo. Some of these lands could be irrigated after \ drainage, whilst others are in rain belts where irrigation would not be necessary. / To'^nngH 4 ■■I 6 - To sum up agricultural development can t&gt;e on two broad lines: (a) the more efficient use of the land at present under cultivation, by means of irrigation, the use of fertilisers, the improvement of cultivation practices,etc (b) the extension of cultivation to land at present waste but cultivable, and by the reclamation of land, preferably in areas suitable for mechanical cultivation (like the Jezira, the 'Western regions of Homs, and Hama and the Mohafazat of Aleppo) and having an adequate rainfall. . But the construction of all-weather communications must proceed parallel with land utilisation, so that the produce may be quickly and cheaply transported to the markets. (c) Cadastral Survey An essential preliminary to all development is the accurate surveying and mapping of the country. While a gre-' deal has already been done, much of the country requi: .^ re surveying, while some of the rich lands are only partially mapped. In particular, considerable work remains to be done on the Cadastral Survey without which many improvements in farming methods and mechanised farming will be difficult to achieve and the completion of certain development schemes, e.g, irrigation projects, will be seriously delayed. Early steps should therefore be taken to review existing legislation with a view to facilitating and speeding the settlement of ownership disputes and the completion of the Cadastral Survey should be a high priority. (d) Land Tenure The familiar evils of share-cropping, absentee landlordism and strip-farming are to be found in Syria. There is also, in the Eastern parts of the country, periodical reallotment, which offers/ (e) U) (g) (h)- 7 - offers no inducement to development and encourages land abuse. A reform of the system of land tenure and of the ownership of water-rights will have to be devised if the farmer is to free himself from his financial thraldom to the landowner and the - _^chant. ( e ) Farming capital One of the most serious obstacles to the small farmer's advancement is the lack of facilities for obtaining shortterm capital at a cheap rate. .An extension of the loaning powers of the Agricultural Bank would help. But, if the 7 ast majority of the small farmers are to emerge from their chronic state of indebtedness, the best solution might be found in the formation of Village Cooperative Credit Societies, such as have been set up in Cyprus and elsewhere. (f) Cooperative^ Such a system, besides providing the farmer with credit, can be extended to perform other functions, such as the collective supplying of the farmer's material needs and the pooling and marketing of his produce. (g) Marketing Boards In order to achieve standardisation of produce and the better development of markets, as well as to encourage new varieties and the use of improved methods. Marketing Boards will prove to be essential, particularly in regard to fruit and vegetable produce. The Syrian Government should be encouraged therefore to take the lead in setting up such Boards. (h) Agricultural Machinery The farmer would be greatly helped too by the formation of organisations on cooperative lines for the purchase, operation and maintenance of agricultural machinery. Customs returns show that the number of agricultural machines'imported in 1948 to be double the number existing in 1947. Prospects for 1949 are that still larger numbers will be imported.- 8 - The Syrian Government are alive to the need for reforms and improvements on the above lines hut whether any efiective action will he taken remains to he seen,. According to a recent unconfirmed report, the Zaim Government has issued a decree directing that a Committee he set up to reconsider the Syrian State Laws and Regulations concerning State land and to propose whatever reforms are required 'in order to conform with wo rld social and economic evolution' and to fulfil the following airas:- (a) to limit and restrict the right to land ownership in the general interest in accordance with the principles of social justice; (h) to lay the foundations for a distribution of State land among small peasants and workers and pensioned military and civil employees; (c) to draw up a system for a limited agricultural land company to guarantee State rights and evolve a plan for cooperative farms. (*) (i) Crqpa Cereals (which form the basic diet of the people) constitute almost a monopoly among field crops and occupy an area approaching 3,300,000 out of a total annual acreage of less than 4 . 000 . 000 acres under general field crops, amongst cereals themselves wheat accounts for more than 2 , 000,000 acres and barley for nearly 1.000. 000* The wheat yield per acre compares favourably with that of the main producing countries of the world, but the same is not toe of prices. In 1948 the price of Syrian wheat was £44 a ton (or £50 a ton) at the border while the world wheat price this summer will stand at £24 a ton c,i,f, Beirut, (j) Wheat Office The Government grain collecting and distributing organisation/ (D- 9 - organisation (MIRA) is to 'be liquidated on the 15th July next. In its stead the Government propose to establish a Wheat Office whose functions will be;- ^ (i) to control prices with a view to bringing them more in line with world wheat prices; (ii) to curb speculation and profiteering; (iii) to ensure adequate supplies to cover local requirements (iv) to assist farmers, especially those in the Jezira area, in disposing of their crops at reasonable prices; (v) to control wheat exports. The proposal to set up a Wheat Office is a move in the right direction. Should farm labour be available and communications be extended, any expansion in cereal production will also however have to take into account the need for silos for grain storage, (k) Rice Production of rice has gone up considerably in Syria in the last few years. The tonnage produced in 1947 (21,500 tons) was seven times greater than that produced in 1939, while imports over the same period have been reduced by almost 80ft. The Jezira is. the main area of production but rice has recently been cultivated more extensively in the Mzerib area of the Hauran and in the Acharne region of the province of Hama. With the extension of irrigation there is no reason why Syria’s output should not increase still further, at least to cover her own and the Lebanon’s requirements. Care would have to be taken however to reduce the attendant risks of malaria to a minimum# ( 1 ) j etton The requirements of Syria’s spinning mills are more than met by present production. New mills are however being built which will raise the total requirements in ginned cotton to over 20,000 a year. Increased local cultivation of cotton will therefore be desirable, especially in irrigated lands, which produce a higher and/10 - (m) (n) (o) (p) and more uniform yiQld. The most; suitable areas would be the Euphrates Valley and the Jezira, the Orontes Valley and the Ghab region# Other possible areas are the lands to be irrigated by the Aleppo Water Scheme and the Mzerib irrigation scheme. Qi Uve . P -U At present, olive oil production is barely sufficient for internal requirements, for human consumption and soap—manufacture# There are large areas of non-irrigable land suitable for the cultivation of the olive tree and increased cultivation could provide for Syria’s own needs as well as for a substantial export trade# But prior research and experimental work in the use of fertilisers, the planting of improved varieties and the more scientific terracing of the land would be necessary. The growing of fruit presents very considerable possibilities for Syria. The principal fruits are figs and apricots but the diversity of soil and climate make a wider range possible. Sales abroad would be increased if better quality were achieved and better marketing methods introduced. There would be excellent opportunities for the canning and preserving industry. Vegetables Similar opportunities exist for vegetable cultivation. Suitable areas would be the province of Latakia, the Orontes Valley, the Lake Tiberias district, the Jezira and the Euphrates Valley, Grp und-nuts There are certain promising areas for the cultivation of ground-nuts (e.g# the Euphrates Valley, the Latakia district and the Jezira). 6 . LIVESTOCK Sheep in Syria form a valuable asset to the country. They outnumber all other types of livestock. In the export market, of first importance is the wool at present being sold to the United States, As far as meat supplies are concerned, Damascus might be a suitable/11 a suitable centre for a canning factory which would draw on Iracj_ and Transjordan, as well as Syrian sources, for its supplies. Additional pasturage would have to bo provided if meat canning were to be an economic proposition. A research station and demonstration farms would be desirable. 7. FORESTS The forests of Syria have suffered, like the forests of other parts of the Mediterranean region, from ruthless exploitation and the uncontrolled introduction of large herds of sheep cand goats. Imports of wood are estimated at about 476,000 cubic metres annually and annual charcoal requirements are 40,000 tons. The demand is unsatisfied and forest reserves cannot provide what is required on a replacement basis, at present, Reaffortestation of very considerable areas would confer great benefit on the country by supplying timber and fuel, reducing erosion and conserving water supplies. The main present need ifi natural regeneration to prevent soil erosion. The forests include evergreen and deciduous oak, stone pine, Aleppo pine, cypress and juniper and the montane typos. considerable number of fruit-trees exist, both wild and in cultivation. The maintenance and extension of the forests depends on afforestation and the establishment of a forest police, Syria reformed its Forest Code in 1935, but little effective action was taken until 1938, when two divisions of forest police were established, one in the North and the other in the South. The present Director of Forests has made wide acquisitions of reserves and created a better Forest Department, But reservation has gone too fast for public opinion and the need is now to expand the Department, consolidate what has been gained, obtain more effective protection for natural regeneration and then launch into larger afforestation schemes.12 3. MINERALS Syria’s known mineral resources cannot be depended upon to play more than a very small part in the country’s economic development and the absence of important minerals, such as iron and coal* make the creation of any heavy industries impossible at present* The only metallic minerals to be found arc chromite, manganese ore and asbestos* The only non—motallic minerals are salt, asphalt and building- stone. 9* OIL In view of tho largo deposits of petroleum in neighbouring countries and of tho similarity of certain parts of Syria to thoso countries there is always tho possibility of discovering oil. The Syrian Petroleum Company had spent some £S 9 million by 1947 on test borings without tho discovery of oil. Borings are continuing in the North-East. 10. PIPE-LINES The I.P.C. pipe-lino from Kirkuk to Tripoli passes through Syrian territory. Plans have boon made (although the Syrian Government’s agreement has not yet been secured) for tho doubling of this pipe-line and for tho construction of a now terminal on tho Syrian coast, probably at Banias. Tho estimated cost is £ 33 million plus 0 42 million. The completion dato is expected to be 1953« Meanwhile an agreement has been drawn, up for the laying of a pipe-line (Middle East Pipe-Line Company) v/hich will run from South-ViKst Persia to a terminal on tho Syrian Coast, probably at Tartus. The estimated cost is £ 33 million plus 0 100 , the expected completion date being 1952 . An agreement with tho Trans-Arabian Pipe-Line Company for the laying of a pipe-line (from Dhahron to tho Lebanese Coast) through Syrian territory was ratified on May 18 th. All those works should bo of considerable assistance /to(24 ] - 13 - to tho economy of Syria, in providing employment, currency and an easing of tho oil supply position, 11. COMMUNICATIONS (a) Roads Except for the remote and undeveloped areas, particularly the Jozira, road communications are generally adequate and no large programme of road construction is necessary. At present a major difficulty is rather tho maintenance of the existing road system* An estimate of road construction required in opening up the agri cultural lands of the Euphrates Valley and the Jozira, together with an analysis of costs, is given in Annex A, paragraphs 10 and 11 . (b) Railways The railway system does not serve the best interests of the country. The Southern regions, including Damascus, have no through rail connexion with Aleppo and the North. The rail link between the West and tho large and potentially rich lands of the North-East and Iraq passes through Turkey. There arc suggestions therefore for a direct link with Bagdad, to which the Iraquis have agreed in principle. Tho route might bo via Homs-Palmyra-Abou Keraal, with a new direct line from Homs to Damascus. Such a lino would be uneconomic. To serve tho rich Jozira, a line farther North, from Aleppo via Raqqa to Deir-ez-Zor, would bo necessary Tho Gibb Report recommended the following prograrane of railway development: First Stage (a) Damascus-Homs (200 Ians.) Detailed investigations and execution. (b) Aleppo-Latakia (220 kms.)

Costs The estimated costs (at 1947 prices) of these projects All the above capital costs include the cost of locomotives and rolling stock. Detailed surveys of alignment are estimated at about £3 500 per km. The cost of imported material would be approximately 50 $ of the total. Import re quirements would include probably 135,000 tons of stool rail and lj million sleepers. An estimate of railway development to serve the Euphrates Valley and the Jezira is given in Annex A, paragraphs 13-17. (c) Civil Aviation Only Air-Prance served the Levant States before the war, but other foreign lines are now also well established, among them Pan-American World Airways, which alone maintains a round- the-world service via Damascus. Under an international agree ment concluded in April, 1947» granting rights not yet extended to other foreign linos, Pan-American - are also entitled to pick up and discharge international traffic at Damascus. In 1946 it organised and staffed a local company, Syrian Airways, which was taken over by the Government, for military purposes, in 1948. It has not are: (including bridge) TOTAL £3 178 million so far been /demilitarised.. - 15 - domilitariaGd. Monnwhilo plans have been drawn up far the oan- struction of an international airport at Uozz&amp; P near Damascus, the cost of which, at a roujh estimate, might amount to £3 million. (&amp;) Ports , The natural jutlets to the sea fjr Syrian trade are Iskenderun (Alexandretta), Beirut and Tripoli, While these three ports were under French Mandate there was no need to consider development of other ports. The cession of Iskenderun to Turkey in 1939 concentrated Syrian trade through Beirut which, with Tripoli, in 1945 became a Lebanese port, Syria now lacks a deep-water harbour and it has been recommended that invostigations be made into the development of Latakia (to serve the North) and Tartus (for central Syria). Traffic centred on Damascus would continue to use Beirut, The reaons for development of a purely Syrian port at Latakia or elsewhere are mainly political, Beirut and Tripoli could continue to handle present Syrian trade with no dofficulty and both have free zones. Meanwhile there arc pro posals for new ports at Tartus (A,I,0,0.) and Banins as pipe-lino terminals, (e) Telecommunications . A contract between the Syrian authorities and the Standard Telephone Company was signed in January, 194&lt;% the total value of which was in the neighbourhood of £ 1 , 200,000 and which provided for the installation of automatic tele phone exchanges at Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Hama and Latakia, and the supply of instruments and associated equipment. In addition, an extensive network of carrier derived circuits on open wire lines and international trunk outlets were to bo installed. Two radio broadcasting stations were also to be installed at Sabboura and Saraqeb v/hich would be fed from now /studios- 16 - studios from Dcmascus for tho fitting out of v/hich the Company had als^ obtained the contract. This contract was obtained in the face of fierce competition from the Ericsson Company of Sweden. It was necessary for the company to £'V- centract for automatic exchange equipment to a Belgian sub sidiary ov/ing to the fact that the type of gear required was not manufactured or otherwise obtainable in this country. In due course sanction was obtained for tho expenditure of £500,000 in Belgium. The present position is that it is hoped to open the Damascus exchange this November, followed by the others as the work is completed. As regards the broadcasting stations, matters are also well advanced and a number of Syrian officials are at present under training in England at the Company^ establishment, including the Technical Director and Assistant Technical Director of Broadcasting. 12. INDUSTRY AND POA’ER Syria’s economy having always boon based on agriculture, her indU3tries wore confined until recently to handicrafts and domestic systems of manufacture. Industrial development is limited, apart from the lack of skilled technicians and labour, by the lack of minerals, particularly coal and iron, and of cheap fuel and power. Advances have however boon made in the development of light industries, the most important of which is the textile industry, including cotton and silk spinning, cotton, rayon and silk weaving. (a) Cotton Spinning The estimated output of cotton yarn in 1947 was 1000 tons. Plans have been made for the erection of more mills, which will have a total estimate output of over 10,000 tons a year. The output of raw cotton is sufficient at present to moot current requirements of the mills but very large quantities- 17 - will have to be imported later. (b) Vifeavlap: . The weaving and knitting industry, based on Damascus, Aleppo and Homs, produced in 1947 over 10,000 tons of cloth* Hand-looms still accounted for a high proportion of the total output. The industry's annual requirements of yarn were then estimated at 12,000 tons. Syrian spinning costs are still about 2 or 3 times greater than United kingdom costs and greater efficiency in production, including increased mechanisation, will be needed both in spinning and weaving to compete with foreign textiles. Other Middle East countries are expanding their textile industries and export possibilities are therefore decreasing. (c) / Cement. Cement required by the Syrian market is supplied from factories at Dummar, near Damascus, and from Tripoli in the Lebanon. The Dummar factory's output in 1948 was 50,000 tons, while the factory at Tripoli produced 200,000 tons. Thoir capacity is insufficient to meet the needs of Syria and the Lebanon, especially for any expansion in public works. A third factory is now being built in the Aleppo area, whore it will be well situated as regards communications and will eventually be able to supply the requirements of such areas as the Jezira and the Euphrates Valley. Present prices arc £S 100 per ton, as against import prices of £S 66 c.i.f. (d) Power . One of the obstacles to greater industrial efficiency and to a reduction in costs is the irregular, frequently inadequate, and uniformly expensive supply of electric power. Lack of cheap power is also a deterrent to increased industrial mechanisation. Apart from industry, there is need for a more widespread use of electricity in the home. At present only a small proportion of the country benefits from electricity, /which- 18 - which could play an important part in raising the general standard of living. Also, in certain circumstances, agriculture could use cheap supplies of electric power to advantage, in particular for irrigation pumps. jn The principal sources of power for hydro generation - the Euphrates., the Orontes and the Yarmuk, may have a total potential power of over 126,000 kw. It will he a number of years before demand roaches this figure. 30,000 kw. could bo derived from the minimum flow of the Euphrates alone. With water conservation, 100,000 kw. or more might bo developed. The possibilities of the combination of hydro-electric development and water conservation in the Euphrates Valley are of special interest to Syria. Much will depend however on the outcome of the projected electrification schemes in the Lebanon, which could no doubt be used to supply Syria also with increased electric power. * The Gibb Report recommended that the capacity of the plants at Aleppo and Damascus should be doubled by about 1952, particularly to meet growing industrial and agricultural needs, (e) Sugar . A sugar factory was ejected last year at Homs. It began manufacture this year of sugar from sugar beet. In full production it is considered capable of supplying one quarter or one third of Syria’s, sugar requirements but the area of sugar beet at present grown is insufficient to keep the factory at full capacity. Beet is to be imported from Iraq and cane from Egypt. The factory is also to produce various chemical derivatives of sugar, e.g. glucose, alcohol, etc.. 13. HEALTH The medical services in Syria, which is remarkably free from endemic diseases except for a little mild malaria in the rural areas, are of a low standard owing to the inadequate training at the medical schools, the shortage of /doctors19 - doctors and lack of organisation* Thoro is at prosont only one British medical advisor, an expert in surgery, at the Ministry of Health in Damascus, hut Dr.Jnhi, the newly- appointed Director-General of the Ministry of Health (who visited the United Kingdom under British Council auspices last year and who has a high reputation for efficiency) has now made a request for British matrons and nurses for appointment to Government hospitals. It is hoped that this modest beginning may lead to the adoption in Syria of British medical practice and a visit to Syria by the Health Adviser of the British Middle East Office is being arranged* The former Health Adviser to the B.M.E.O* recommended the appointment of foreign professors of preventive medicine, medicine, surgery, obstetrics, pathology, physiology and anatomy at the Faculty of Medicine ’at Damascus. 14 ' water supply . In addition to providing water for irrigation, the water resources of Syria are also needed for domestic use in both urban and rural areas. In the rural areas much needs to be done which will have to bo spread over a period of many years. The first consideration should be given to those areas which suffer from perennial shortages, in particular the Jobol Druze, the Hauran and parts of the Aleppo and Korns regions. In order to make tiio most economical use of the limited supplies available in these areas, overall plans will be re quired for' each area. A programme of suggested development is contained in Annex B, paragraph (c). 15. LABOUR Conditions of employment, Trade Unions, Workmen’s Compensation, trades disputes procedure, etc. , are proscribed in the current Labour Law introduced in 1946. It is impressive ly comprehensive. Its provisions are based largely ux)on I.L.O. /resolutionsresolutions and for the most part havo bean used as standards to bo reached rather than statutory requirements to be legally observed by all concerned. Flexibility of enforcement by the administration creates anomalies, * Largo employers (e,g. the I.P.O.) are watched closely; the mass of small firms receive little or no attention. Machinery to apply the Law has boon created, e#g. Directorate of Labour, Labour Offices, Labour Inspectors. It is manifestly inadequate, due to insufficiency of staff, inexperience, superficial understanding of the implications of the Law and lack of social responsibility. The officials however appear eager and willing to broaden their knowledge and to receive advice. Judged by Middle Eastern standards, the Trade Unions are well organised, ^ National Federation exists (the General Union of Syrian Labour Syndicates). It is anti communist and claims to represent two-thirds of the Syrian Trade Unionists. Its leaders are recognised as capable, constructive and reasonable representatives of workers 1 interests. Their relations with the former Government were cooperative; the present military-led Government’s anti communist policy is supported by the Federation. Planned industrial developments (oil pipe-linos and the proposed refinery at Tartus, textiles, etc.) and agricultural projects are expected to absorb most of the unemployed (reckoned by the local Trade Unions, in the absence of official statistics at about 50 , 000 ) and to offer employment for the under employed.16, FINANCE Under the French Mandate Syria and the Lebanon formed economic (but not political) unit and had a currency backed by the franc. In March, 1948, as a result of a prolonged dispute on the revaluation of Syria holdings of French francs in the event of the devaluation of the franc, Syria (but not the Lebanon) left the French franc area, divorced her currency from that of the Lebanon and set up a separate Foreign Exchange Office. A Franco-Syrian Agreement recently concluded providen for the settlement of Syria's claim on the 10 milliard of francs previously forming tho curroncy cover. Of this total, 7 milliards, guaranteed in terms of sterling, is to bo released in 14 half-yearly instalments. The remaining 3 milliards will be used partly to satisfy French counter-claims, partly for the purchase of certain European currencies (not including sterling or Belgian or Swiss francs) up to a limit of £375,000 over two' years. Apart from these sums in French francs, Syria's resources in foreign exchange are very small. Sterling holdings are of the order of £3,000,000 nearly all in private hands. An attempt made last year to introduce comparatively strict control over foreign exchange earnings broke down, mainly because Syrian merchants resorted to transacting business through tho Lebanon whore controls are very loose. Syria now operates virtually on a free market economy and in a very hand-to-mouth fashion. No recant trade figures ( and no information for Syria alone are available but it is certain that retained imports always greatly exceed exports and that Syria has always lived largely by tho entrepot trade with Palestine, Iraq and Transjordan. Syria 1 s- 22 - Syria’s actual and prospective earnings from oil companies -N The internal financial position is shaky and there is increasing inflation. The effect of this is well illustrated by the price of Syrian wheat (see paragraph 5 (i) above)# It is obvious that the sale of Syria’s new season wheat surplus (estimated at 100,000 tons) will present difficulties, and that similar difficulties will recur until the prices of Syria’s exportable commodities come more or less into line with world’s prices, t?. INT5RNATIONAL BANK While Syria is a member of the I.M.F. and of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development she has not so far sought the assistance of the Bank# 18. CENTRAL DEVELOPMENT BOARD In their Report to the Syrian Government in 1947 Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners urged the immediate formation of a Central Development Board, the duties of which would be, in the first stage, advisory and, in the second, executive# They suggested that, in the first stage, the Board should study the recommendations for development contained in the Survey and report on them to the Government. In the second stage, the Board would become responsible for 'the detailed implementation of the plan for development decided upon- 23 - upon by the Government. In order to ensure that the Board had a status of permanency, with continuity of service and experience, it would have to be composed of a number of permanent Government officials of the rank of Director-General (or permanent Head of Department) as well as a number of leading citizens, preferably not associated with politics, representing agricultural, industrial and commercial interests. Early this year, the then Minister of Public Works sought our advice about the setting up of a Central Development Board and His Majesty’s Legation furnished him with information on the type of organisation, based on our experience in India, the Sudan and the Colonies, which might be best suited to Syria’s economic needs On 16th May, Zaim announced to a delegation of representatives from financial and economic institutions that he proposed to appoint an Economic Committee to lay down economic plans for the entire country. .Among the plans which this Committee would consider would bo the scheme for t water supply for Aleppo and the contract ion of a railway from interior to the coast. He also proposed to subsidise all Syrian companies ’’whose economic retrogression was noted.” Meanwhile a Director-General of Industries has been appointed, under the Ministry of National Economy, from whom, it is understood, authority will in future bo required before new private industrial ventures can bo undertaken. 19. FOREIGN EXPERTS The Gibb Report also recommended the engagement of foreign exports to assist not only in preparing detailed plans of development but also to help in the implementation of these plans and to educate rind train Syrians to take over from them. The choice of experts, and the order in which they- 2 i* - they should ba engaged, might well form one of tha functions of the Central Development Board. The Board itself might also require the services of foreign experts for specific schemes. As far as agriculture is concerned, the Agricultural Adviser to the British Middle East Office has recommended the appointment of the following foreign experts, to undertake research: (a) an agronomist (b) a horticulturist (c) an agricultural chemist (a) an economic botanist (e) an entomo.logist. Following on the Report of the United States-Syria Agricultural Mission (see paragraph 20 (a) below) four American agricultural experts were engaged by the Syrian Government, only one of whom still remains. 20. PUBLIC UTILITY CORPORATIONS . A further recommendation of the Gibb Report concerned the creation of organisations capable of operating individual development schemes. Such organisations, which might take the form of Public Utility Corporations, besides easing the burden of work on Government Departments, would be a means of attracting private capital into development schemes. An organisation of this nature, which would include on its board officials of the Government or local administrations as well as members of the public, could be used to advantage in the development of particular areas such as the Jezira, or areas recovered by drainage or new irrigation schemes. It could organise the cultivation of the lands on the most economical lines and divide them into suitable holdings, thus avoiding- 25 - avoiding the setting up of uneconomical farm units. It could be used as a medium for settling semi-nomadic tribes and it could train farmers and peasants in improved methods of agriculture. it could ease the problem of land settlement and land tenure, either by outright purchase of lands or by taking over lands on a long-term basis and paying the owner a fixed rent or interest. It could, by its long-term policy, materially assist in giving agriculture the stability it needs# It could also undertake the launching of new crops needed in quantity by industry or for increasing the export trade. 21. SURVEYS OF DEVELOPMENT POSSIBILITIES (a) United States-Syria Agricultural Mission . The United States-Syria Agricultural Missions 1 Report (1947) stressed the need for increased cultivation and extended irrigation, mentioning particularly the lands along the Euphrates and in the Jozira and the Valley of the Orontes. The Report also recommended the introduction of better plant varieties and animal breeds and the establishment of agricultural industries, and made specific recommendations concerning research, agricultural education and administrative, regulatory and control programmes. ( b ) Report by Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners The Gibb Report covered the major natural resources of the country. A summary of the programme of development which it recommended is contained in Annex B. ( c ) Reports by the British Middle East Office Reports to the Syrian Government have been made by the Agricultural, Health, Labour, Forestry and Soil Conservation, and the Statistical Advisers to the British Middle Bast Office, while the same Advisers have submitted a number of confidential Reports to the Foreign Office on the subjects in their respective fields. On(-1) - 26 - On the rocomraendation of Dr, Murray (Statistical Adviser), who has drafted a complete law of statistics for the use of the Syrian Government, the latter have appointed alt. ex-Palestine Government official as their Statistical Adviser. Work on a Statistical Abstract and the organisation of a Central Statistical Bureau is now well advanced. (d) Syrian Taxation A Report on Syrian Taxation was made by Sir Horace Hamilton (formerly Permanent Secretary to the Board of Trade) in 1947 at the Syrian Government’s request. The Report dealt with, and made recommendations upon, Fiscal Policy, the Tax System and Income Tax. 22. SYRIAN GOVERNMENT 1 S FIVE-YEAR PLAN . Until recently the Syrians had adopted an attitude of economic isolationism, refusing to seek financial assistance for development from outside sources or to employ more than one or two foreign technical experts. No action had been taken on the Gibb Report. On 1st March last, however, the then Minister of National Economy announced that the Government were drafting an important Five-Year Programme of Development, which included the following principal projects, (all of which were recommended by the Gibb Report): (a) the enlargemont of Latakia port (b) the construction of a railway network in various districts of Syria, especially the productive and consumer areas, and the linking of them with Syrian ports. (c) the draining of swamps, especially the Ghab plain between Homs and Latakia, to provide about 250,000 acres of arable land.(d) the construction of* several electric power plants on the Euphrates to provide adequate electric energy for Syrian industry. (e) the execution of several large irrigation projects for the exploitation of the largest possible area of land situated in the North between the Euphrates and the Jezira, The cost of this programne was estimated at £Syrian 200 (£22 million) and His Majesty’s Minister at Damascus was informed that it was proposed to raise a foreign loan to meet part of the cost. Meanwhile, as regards the Water Supply Scheme for Aleppo, an agreement was recently signed with the Compagnie Francaise des Etudes Techniques of Paris for the Preparation of the detailed plans. How far Zaim proposes to follow up the proposed Programme remains to be seen. Meanwhile, however, item (b) is included in the plans to bo considered by the new Economic Committee.ANNSX A 34- R33ETTLSMENT POSSIBILITIES IN SYRIA / Syria 1 s capacity for immediate absorption of refugees (wheih was in any ca;-:e very limited) has probably now been fully used up* The Jezira * 2* There are estimated however to be about if million acres of cultivable waste land in the Jezira area. The land is largely rain-fed and requires only men and machinery to get it into production. The three most fertile zones are thought to be (a) the Khabur el Byad (b) the district North- East of Hassetche (c) Tel Kotchek. Numbers who mig ht be resett led. 3* Our estimates (further details of which are given in Annex A) show t at the area might we!' absorb between 100,000 and 245*000 persons, depending on the area assumed to be cultivable and the degree of mechanisation proposed. It is thought however that it would be unwise to plan on the basis of resettling more than 150,000 persons. One of the difficulties in making these estimates is that it is uncertain how much of the land shown as 'cultivable waste' in the Syrian Governments official statistics has a high enough rate of rainfall to allow for resettlement. A large part of the 1,796,000 acres shown as cultivable may lie in the low rainfall area. Communications . 4# Any extensive resettlement will depend, moreover, &lt; ti the development of road and rail communications both within the Jezira area and between that area and the West. Problems irevolved in rcsett loment . 5. It would probably be best for settlement in the Jezira to be based on a combination of mechanised and animal agriculture. It may however prove impossible at first to buy sufficient ploughing animals. Situ 11—holdings would oe unsuitable. The area /is...' * is ripe for large-scale farming on on organised basis. A great opportunity is thus presented for establishing co*operative forms of ownership and management, perhaps on the same linr&gt; as those which have proved so successful in the Sudan. 6. In theory the greater part of the land is State domain or Government-owned. Ov/ing to the distance away from % the central Government, uncontrolled land acquisition by certain tribes and important sheikhs has however taken place. It may prove very difficult to upset their claims which, in the unsettled state of the Jezira, cannot be ignored. 7. Unless resettlement is accompanied by instruction and advice in regard to crop rotation, the use of fertilisers, etc., the area will revert to waste land. Cost of resettlement . 8. At a very rough guess, the initial outlay involved in resettlement is estimated as follows: Surveys £50,000 Tents (it is assumed that the settlers will gradually build their own homes) Wells, etc.Hoad and rail const ruetion 10, Roads. There are fair-weather roads or some form of track ‘ connecting Deir-ez-Zor with Raqqa, Meskeneh and Aleppo (318 kms) and joining Deir-ez-Zor with Hassetche, Qamichliye and the North (232 kms.) Roads from Raqqa to Tel Ahiad (90 kms.), from Hassetche to Ras-el-Ain (83 kms.), from Qamichliye to Ain Divar and Tel Kotchek (about 90 tons.) and from Mayadine to Abou Kemal (91 tons.) would probably be essential. The total length of roads required would no doubt be at least 600 tons. In 194/ it was estimated that the cost of building secondary roads would be about £S 30,000 per km. (roughly £ 3,333 sterling). Annual maintenance costs would be at least £ S 500 per km. 11. Annual estimated costs for the above programme, spread over 5 years, might be summarised as follows: Capital cost of construction £ 8 3,600,000 - £ 400,000 Capital cost of reconditioning 400,000 - 44 , 44 ^ Maintenance charges • 600 , 000 - 66,666 Totals £ S 4,600,000 £ 311,110 12. The employment of refugees on road construction might provide a valuable form of interior relief works, part of which might be financed oy the U.N.R.P # r., in the event of that organisation converting its activities from pure relief to works projects and of further funds becoming available. 13* Railways . The nearest railway line is that at Aleppo, 80 tons, from the river. The N.E. section of the area is traversed by the Mosul-Turkey-Aleppo line at a distance 250 tons, by rail from Aleppo. 14. The following railway lines would be desirable: /(a)...(a) from Aleppo to Raqqa (200 Ians,) (b) from Raqqa to Hassetchc (180 Ians.) (c) from Hassetcho to Tel Kotchek (130 kms.) 15«* The costs (at 1947 prices), including locomotives, rolling stock and all the necessary works, v/ere estimated as follows: (a) £3 26 million excluding a bridge across the Euphrates, costing £S 5 million; (b) £S 24 million; (c) £S 20 million. 16. Further lines could be constructed as follows: (a) from Raqqa to Peir-ez-Zor (150 kms.), costing £S 21 millions; (b) from Deir-ez-Zor to Abou Komal (130 kms) costing £S 20 million, 17. The total length would be about 800 kms. This would probably involve the import of about 87,500 tons of steel rail and 1 million sleepers. Timing of resettlement. 18. It is suggested that, as a first step, a Technical Commission should be sent to the Jezira area to study conditions on the spot. The Commission^ work might take 6 months. After- that period, settlement might take up to 2 years, although it might be possible to settle some groups before the Commission completed its work. Settlement should start at the time ‘of year when settlers would have the opportunity to establish themsevles and take in their first crop. Other -resettlement possibilities in Syria 19 . (a) Irrigation settlement on the Khabur River. The Gibb Report recommended the investigation of a canalisation scheme which might provide irrigation for 83,000 acres and land for about 60,000 souls, assuming that the land were to be intensively cultivated and depending /on.*.on the quality of the soil; (h) Irrigation development in the Euphrates Valley from Meskeneh to Kaqqa and from Deir-ez-Zor to Abou Kemal. Relatively little capital would be required, for oil-powered 12 inch pumps and the construction of distribution canals and similar minor works. The present population of the Euphrates Valley (about 200,000 in 19hl) is sufficient for the cultivation of only about a quarter of the irrigable land on non-irtensive farming. Here again road-building must be an essential accompaniment to any development schemes*B SUMMARY OF RECOMlViai^TIONS OF THE GIBB RBK)RT ^( a ) PROGRAMME FOR IRRIGATION DR^IN^GE .

Until rail construction can he completed the JEZIRA must he linked hy road to western SYRIA and to the coast. Otherwise, the road system should he complementary to the rail and should not duplicate it. There should he no need for a large programme of new road construction, hut plans should concentrate on improvements to existing roads. 9* The plan for execution of rail work is summarised as follows:- Route Approx cost £ Syrian Phase I ALEPPO - RAQQA 26,000,000 EUPHRATES Bridge 5 , 000,000 Phase II RAQQA - HASSETCHE - TEL KOTCHEK 44,000,000 ALEPPO - LATAKLA 34 , 000,000 Phase III RAQQA - DEIREZ ZOR - ABOU KEMAL 4-1,000,000 150 , 000,000 Plus the DAMASCUS - HOMS line, which is outside the area considered, hut should come into Phase I. 28,000,000 10. It is not possible to put in any order of priority the large number of relatively small road schemes recommended in the Gihh Report. These must he considered in relation to the progress of Syrian development schemes as a whole and also in relation to the progress of railway construction. In general, maintenance and reconditioning of existing roads has priority over new construction. Because of the extremely poor state of existing roads in the JEZIRA, work in that area, other things being equal, should precede work in areas where the road system is better developed. Plans for road construction hy the Syrian Government should he integrated with the road construction requirements of the oil companies. The cost of road work throughout SYRIA is estimated hy the Gihh Report at £Syrian 55&gt;000,000. This amount is to he spread over ten years, and includes recurrent maintenance charges. 11. Prom the strategic point of view, interest in Syrian communications has hitherto been mainly confined to the development of a through route, either road, rail, or both, from IRAQ to the LEVANT seabord. A direct route across the Syrian desert would he preferable from this viewpoint, hut would do little to help Syrian economy, which is best served hy a route to the north of the desert following the EUPHRATES Valley. /PortRailways 16. The areas of the EUPHRATES Valley and JEZIRA are at present very inadequately served by rail. There is a single track, standard gauge railway line, which runs north f’rom ALEPPO, crosses the Turco-Syrian frontier into TURKEY at TCHOBAN BEY station, and thence runs a few yard,, north of the frontier line as far as NUSAIBIN, where it re-crosses the frontier into SYRIA, and cuts across the Syrian duck s bill' to TEL KOTCHEK on the Syrian/Iraq frontier Prom TEL KOTCHEK the line runs southwards to BAGDAD.

Stated in the broadest terms, the problem of Egypt is that ^ maintaining a constantly increasing population on a static supply of food. Unless some means is found of increasing the supply of food and other necessities of life, a constant fall in the standard of living seems inevitable. 2. The population of Egypt is increasing at the rate of between 1 % and‘2^ per annum, equivalent to a yearly increment of some 300,000 at the present time. The last completed census, in 1937, showed it to be just under 16 millions; it was estimated at 18-g- millions in 1947 , and by now must be over 19 millions. a) The economic problem: Scarcity of. necessities of life 3. The economy of the country is predominantly agricultural, and Egypt has to aim at selfsufficiency in foodstuffs. But the output of food cannot be expanded pari passu with the increase in population owing to climatic conditions. Apart from a narrow belt along the Mediterranean coast where the winter rainfall is just sufficient to grow a sparse crop of barley, agriculture depends on irrigation with water from the Nile. The only land where this irrigation is readily feasible is the flat alluvial valley of the Nile (with the Fayoum depression) and the Delta; and with the exception of 1 to 1|- million acres, now mostly marsh and lakes, which will have to be reclaimed and for which extra irrigation water will have to be found, it is practically all under intensive cultivation. The desert remains desert because it is in most places 50 or more feet above the Nile Valley. It may be possible to irrigate valleys in the desert with water pdmped up from the Nile, or in certain areas from under-lying water-bearing strata; but it would require vast capitalcapital expenditure to put any substantial area under cultivation in this way, 4. The existing cultivated area can be made to produce mr a within limits, by intensifying the use of fertilisers and - in a relatively small region - by converting from ’’basin” irrigation (the land being irrigated once a year, when the Nile is in flood) to perennial irrigation, permitting more than one crop to be raised in a year. But the ’’basins”, which cover about 1 million acres, cannot be converted to perennial irrigation until complete flood control of the Nile further upstream has been instituted. At the moment they represent a safety valve in years of high Nile, 5 # At the moment crop yields are below pre-war levels owing mainly to the land having been starved of fertiliser during the war. An increased consumption of fertilisers would mean bigger imports. A nitrogenous fertiliser factory now building at Suez will, when it goes into production in two or three years’ time, go a long way towards making the country independent of imports; and plans have been sketched for another factory to be built using the electricity generated at the Aswan dam: this project is unlikely to come to fruition for some ten years. It should be repeated, however, that crop output c annot be indefinitely expanded by intensifying the application of fertilisers# 6, To make up the deficit in indigenous supplies of bread- grains, Egypt is already having to impert wheat and maize# In the current year she has been able to pay for the bulk of these imports by her exports of rice; it is uncertain how long this will be possible. 7, This draws attention to the basic feature of Egypt’s economy- 3 - economy, namely that she is dependent on the produce of her soil for her exports. Cotton (making up 80£ by value — of her 1948 exports), rice (a temporary export) and onions are the three largest items; exports of petroleum products and other minerals such as phosphates, though expanding, are still small. Industrialisation is sometimes said to be the cure of Egypt’s economic ills, but while Egyptian industry can replace some imports of consumer goods, its rdle as a producer of foreign exchange is negligible at the moment and is unlikely to become more important, owing to high production costs arising mainly out of the inefficiency of both labour and management. 8. To sum up, Egypt is faced with a situation in which her increasing population is outstripping her food production, a process which can be averted, if at all, only by bold and extensive capital development. ^&gt;) The social problem ; (i) individual poverty . 9. The social problem is implicit in the economic one. In the first place, the standard of living, measured by the quantity of commodities available for each member of the population, is slowly but surely declining. In the second place, there is growing unemployment, latent if not apparent. Agriculture is even now carried on by primitive and inefficient methods; with the constant increase of the-li the rural population - some 7Q£ to 80^ of the total agriculture is being progressively overloaded with a redundant labour force. The consequence is obvious: the cash return to labour must continually fall unless prices can continually rise. Prices of Egyptian agricultural produce have in fact risen three to four times on the average compared with pre-war days. World prices of cereals have, of course, risen even higher, but the Egyptian Government limited the price of home-grown cereals in an attempt to check the rise in the cost of living, now nearly three times what it was in 1939. The return to the tenant farmer has not, however, risen in Droportion since landlords have raised their rents* fP Vmt q although the cash return to cultivators is higher than before the war, it has not, generally speaking, kept pace with the riso in the cost of living, so that their real income has fallen. The same is true of wage-earning agricultural labourers. In other words the rural population is suffering a progressive impoverishment, b) The social problem (ii) Unemployment. 10. In addition to the latent unemployment implicit in this situation there is a certain amount of real unemployment, though much less than might be expected. During the war many thousands of hands were employed by the British and allied forces in workshops and in ancillary occupations, while many others worked in small factories (largely closed since then) set up to produce articles of- 5 - of which imports were restricted- by the war. Many of these workers came from country districts and most of these have apparently been re-absorbed into the rural community. Others have found work in the numerous factories, mainly textile, v/hich have been started since the war and which are still in the main working three shifts a day. There appears, however, to be a certain floating mass of labour in the towns, in the main casually employed, which may well increase owing to an incipient depression in the textile industry due to the high price of raw cotton. In the absence of any efficient system of unemployment registration and labour exchanges no reliable figure can be given; and, owing to the ability of Egyptian workmen to make a scant living from odd 3obs, to live on their relatives in hard times, etc., the number of wholly un employed is probably small. Officials of the responsible Egyptian Government Department, when questioned on the subject, invariably insist that th-re is no unemployment problem in the sense that it is understood in Western Europe, i.e. a large mass of qualified workers thrown out of employment and liable to be an unsettling factor in the urban population. 11. Industrialisation may prove to be the remedy for this situation of under employment: factories in the towns, and the development- of rural industries in the country districts to give fuller employment to the fellahin and their families. The development of factories has made grert strides since the war and is still going ahead, though there are signs that in some branches saturation of the market is being reached. Machinery for these factories is required from abroad. The development of rural industries depends mainly on organisation, and the Government informed F.A.O. in February, 1948 that the promotion of rural industries was included in their long-term plan for raising the standard of living of the fellah; but nothing has materialised as yet, apart fr .^m some int erest shown by the Government in encouraging rug and carpet-making and hand-woven textiles. A)...- 6 - b) The Social ^roblom : (iii) Disease and I sen or caic c » 12, Poverty of the country in the resources necessary for maintaining its population, and poverty of the individual in thf' means for acquiring his share of those resources, constitute the main and fundamental problem facing Egypt. But much more remains to be done to better the lot of the population. Endemic diseases are rampant, and the population is still about 8tfo illiterate. Some three or four years aigo the construction of village social and health centres was started; the provision of pure drinking water supplies in country districts is considered a project of first priority; and some attention is being paid to housing. The development and speedy execution of such scuemcs is not helped for** ward by the fact that the fellahin, as a general rule, have little desire to better their living conditions or to move away from over populated areas; alt ough they arc becoming resentful of their exploitation by the land-owning classes, and are beginning to de mand a bettor return for their labour. Education is thus seen to be of primordial importance in lifting the fellahin out of their indifference to squalor; and not only the teaching of tho three H f s on which the Egyptian Government perhaps concentrate too much, but also the encouragement of hobbies and games, new methods of practical instruction in hyfeien., etc., w-uld help a great deal to shake them out of their mental apathy. Education and more amenities in the rural areas might, moreover, help to control the birth rate, c) General development work. 13 . In addition to the above, a great deal of development work is required in the field of public utilities which, while not directly affecting the production of food or the standard of living of the population, is nevertheless necessary to raise the general efficiency of the country’s economic system. Such work includes the construction and improvement of road, the renovation of the railway system, suffering from lack of replacement during the war, the increase of electric power generation and the extension of the /telephone./6. #. telephone system, the improvement of town drainage, etc# II# Progress In the last three years # (a) Egyptian Governments plans # (i) The Five-Year Plan, 14# The only overall development plan produced by the Egyptian Government is the so-called Five-Year Plan, prepared in 1945 and approved in 1946# Whatever may have been the intention at the out set, this plan has not worked out like similar plans drawn -up in other countries# It was in fact little more than a list of classes the more important projects individually mentioned. A total of £.E#96 millions was to bo provid d, £.E.46 millions out of the General Reserve and the remainder out of current revenue in five equal yearly instalments. It was left to the responsible Govern ment Departments to draw up and execute plans for individual projects. 15. As far as can be ascertained no surveys of the progress of work under this plaJi have been made, and it is thus difficult to assess the extent to which it has been completed, except as stated below in paragraph 17# In any case the calculations must have been thrown completely out by the rise in prices of imported capital equipment which has taken place in the last four years. Moreover, other projects have forced themselves on the attention of the Government owing to changing circumstances, and events such as the cholera epidemic in the autumn of 1947 probably necessitated shifts in priority# 16. Of the total sum of £.E.46 millions to be provided out of the General Reserve, Parliament in July, 1946 allocated £#E#22i millions as follows:- a) Roads £#E.4 millions. (2) Reclamation of swamp lands £,E. 2 millions. (3) Cairo main drainage £.E. 2 millions (4) Schools and Hospitals £.E. lj millions (5) Irrigation and Drainage £.E. 6 millions. .of development work considered desirable or necessary, with some of( 6 ) Pure Drinking water supplies £.E # 3i millions (?) Agricultural schemes £#E # 1*7 millions ( 8 ) Other projects About £.E* 2 millions* Another sum of £.E.7.8 millions was set aside out of the Genera Reserve in July 1947* while a total of £*E.24 millions has been allocated out of current revenue in the three financial years 1946 - 7-8 and 1948 - 9 , i#o* somewhat less than the annual sum of £*E. 10 millions foreseen. 17 # Under the above-mentioned heads the following progress is understood to have been made in the last three years:— RoaxTs. Certain projects have been completed in the Delt°, and work is believed to have begun on two desert road in Upper Egypt. The improvement and surfacing of the main Nile Valley road from North to South of Egypt still remains to be undertaken. Reclamation of swamp lands . This work consists principally of numerous small earth—fLlling jobs undertaken with local hand labour. Main Drainage . The United Kingdom firm, Braithwaites(Engineers) Limited, secured a contract for about £.E«700,000 for a new mc.in at Cairo, and are busy making the pipes in a factory specially set up by them at Port Said. The laying of the pipes has scarcely yet begun because the Government has delayed the necessary land and because of transport difficulties. /Schools .,•Schools Hospitals. The Ministry of Public Health whose total 1 • annual budget of about £ 0 E.12 million, is probably as large as the annual budget for health services of all the other Middle East countries combined, have been making steady progress with programme for one 500 bed hospital in the Provinces per year# One such hospital in Mansura Province under the 1948 programme is nearing completion. There is no lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Ministry and no lack of finance. Shortages of materials and of personnel to staff the hospitals are the main handicaps to progress. /Irrigation...rr- ■ - 10 - Irri/Tatlon and Drainage * Tho romodolling of tho Esna Barrage was complotod by a British firm* The biggest single projecthunder execution at present is the building of a Barrage at Edfina across tho Rosetta mouth of the Nila. Progress is understood to bo rather slow. A consortium of a French, a Dutch and a Czechoslovakian firm holds the contract* Pure Drinkinr Water supplies . This project, of first im portance from the point of view of improving the health of the rural population, was forced into first place by the 1947 cholera epidemic. The sum of £.E.3i millions allocated for this purpose in 1946 appears to be quite inadequate. A contract was recently placed for the completion of one of the five large waterworks, with its network of mains, to be erected in the Delta, and tenders were due to be opened for a second such project in the early part of 1949 , In addition to these large schemes in the north rn part of the Delta, pure water is being provided in other parts of the country from wells sunk in the villages and provided with powered pumping sets. About 2,000 of these will be required eventually, in addition to over 12,000 wells equipped with hand punps. Some 700 of the powered sets have been ordered, but very few have so far been received, and it seems likely that supply difficulties in the manufacturing countries will hold up the realisation of this scheme. The present world supply of pipes presents another difficulty. Nevertheless a responsible official in the Ministry of Public Health stated some months ago that the precentage of the rural population supplied with pure drinking water had been raised in the last three years or so from 25$ to 40 $. Agricultural Schemes . A system of agricultural and animal husbandry centres is being set up on what appear to bp sound lines, (ii) Other nro.lects outside the Five-Year Plant, 18. Reference has been made above (paragraph 12) to the village health centres . About eighty of these had been constructed by the end of 1948, and 30 more were planned for 1949 (out of an /estimated.•estimated total of 1,200 needed to cover the whole country), out several, it is understood, stand empty due to the lack of doctors '''and nurses to run them. The educated Egyptian shows great reluctance to live anywhere except in or near the big towns, and this lack of a sense of civic responsibility is one of the most depressing features of the present social scene in Egypt as elsewhere in the Middle East. The same tendency restricts, to a lesser degree the supply of engineers and other technicians to outlying areas of the provinces, and is bound to hold up, or at least to lessen the efficiency of, any development work which is being done. 19. In the field of housing , a Workers* City is being built at Embcbch, a suburb of Cairo, the target of which is 6,650 houses. Work started towards the end of 1947* and about 600 have been completed, while a total of 1,000 will, it is hoped, be ready by October, 1949. The cost to date has been in the region of £ # E.44- millions. 20. The Aswan Dam Hydro-Electric Scheme , is slowly moving towards realisation. Work has begun on the building of the pre liminary coffer dam, orders for most of the equipment have been place, and tenders have been invited for the civil engineering work and the building of the power house. 21. Ifow rolling stock for the railways , including locomotives is arriving from abroad at a fairly satisfactory rate. Telephone equipment is also coming in, but a recent adjudication for three automatic telephone exchanges in the provinces was cancelled owing to the attempts by the heed of the department to have the contract awarded on other than purely commercial grounds. This is an example of another type of irresponsibility too frequently met with among senior Government officials, which hampers the execution of development schemes. (b) Progress in Spheres outside Government Contro l. Industrialisation. / 22...22. In paragraph 11 and 7 above, referonco was mado to industrialisation as a moans of providing employment and of r-v improving slightly the balance of trade. Industrial activity in Egypt, which began expanding some twenty years ago and was greatly intensified during the war, has continued this tendency in the last four years. Many now textile mills have been opened, and other new enterprises include the manufacture of plastic wares, chomical fertilisers, oxygen and acetylene, metal working and founding, while there are in course of erection a large nitrogenous fertiliser factory and three small steelworks. Some of the smaller concerns established during the war have either gone out of business or rre finding difficulty in meeting the com petition of imported goods, and there are signs of an impending recession in the toxilte industry, which now supplies a great proportion of the country’s requirements in medium and low- priced goods and in addition has a certain surplus available for export; but the larger concerns, such as those of the Misr group, are unlikely to be seriously affected. In some cases of recently established industries it is clear that there was a lack of realistic planning in relation to the probable absorptive capacity of the market once the war-time scarcity of consumer goods had disappeared. 23. Industrial production in 1948 was estimated at about £.E.l67 millions, or almost equivalent to the value of all imports from abroad in that year (which, incidentally, were give times the pre-war value). Capital invested in industry and commerce is now in the region of £*E.125 millions, with reserves of about £.E.50 millions. A measure of the contribution of this movement of industrialisation towards the problem of providing fuller employment for the population as a whole is given by the relatively modest figure of 450,000, the official estimate of the total number of employees of all grades in Egyptian industry#- 13 - 24. To sum up, it will 'be seen from Soction II of this . £apor that little progress has been made towards solving the fundamental problems of scarcity of food and progressive impoverishment of the population* In fact the vast majority are poorer now, in relation to the cost of living, than they were three years ago*•Ill Targets for Future Development 25* In spite of the many official pronouncements on the subject, it cannot be said that there is any cohesive or courageous plan for the solution of these.fundamental problems. Various projects have been put forward which should in the aggregate bring about an improvement, but the general impression is one of well-intentioned and optimistic nibbling at the problem. (a) Extension of the cultivable area. Irrigation, 26. The greatest single contribution will undoubtedly be made by a project to be realised outside the borders of Egypt, namely the comprehensive Nile Vvaters schemes involving dams on the Blue Nile at Lake Tana, on the Equatorial Nile just below Lakes Victoria and albert together with the cutting of a canal through the Sudd and other works, and in the Northern Sudan. The Egyptian Government has voted £E hi million for part of the cost of the dam ** at Owen Palls near Lake Victoria and to cover compensation for disturbance on the Lake shores when the level is raised. It is calculated that this project will hold one million feddans (one feddan= 1.038 acres) to the 6-7 million feddans at present under cultivation in Egypt, and will facilitate the raising of more crops on the land at present under basic irrigation. ^s much of the land is marsh or salty and will have to be reclaimed, the full effect of this scheme, however, may not be felt fully for about 20 years, by which time the population, if it continues to increase as at present, will have caught up with the increased agricultural output, re-establishing the present position of scarcity. 27 . Of possible more immediate realisation is a plan, evolved in recent months, to bore artesian wells in the basin-irrigated, lands of the Qena and ^swan provinces of Upper Egypt so as to /tap- 15 - tap underground resources of water and use it for perennial irrigation* d'he first stage of the scheme would consist in the erection of an Electric Power Station at Qena, with its sub-stations, to supply 500 pumping units over an area of 125,000 feddans. This stage would take 5 yaars. The second stage (also of 5 years) would involve the installation of 500 other units in the remaining 125,000 feddans covered by the scheme, power for which would be supplied by the hydro-electric power station at ^swan. The present supplier of water at low Nile do not permit the conversion of this area, which extends to about 1 million acres, to perennial irrigation. Moreover, this con version is not possible until full control of the Nile floor is secured by works further upstream, as the basins are a safety valve in years of high floods. The Egyptian Government hope to obtain a loan for this purpose from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and a team of experts from the Bank has just visited Egypt to study the scheme which we ourselves have recommended to the President of the i nternational Bank. The Sgyptien Government estimate the cost of the Qena Project (250,000 acres) at about £.E.8 millions, of which some £.E. 5 millions would be spent on imported equipment and the rest locally on labour,etc. 28. Other schemes for increasing the cultivable area include (i) the sinking of artesian wells in the coastal belt of the western desert - a practise follovi/ed but probably not capable of indefinite expansion owing to the fact that the water tends - to&gt; become brackish; (ii) a project of doubtful feasibility, consisting in the irrigation of areas in the western desert by canals dug from the Nile; (iii) the tapping and control of sources of artesian ana sub-artesian water in the oases of Kharga and Dakhla, Parafra and Baharia, which would reclaim considerable areas if cultivators from the Nile Valley could be persuaded to emigrate there and if communications were improved. Such is the urgency of the problem that the Egyptian Government /would- 16 - would be well advised not to neglect any possible solution. (b) I ntensification of the use of Fertilisers. (c) I ncreasing the efficiency of -^riculture . The Government are anxious to encourage the use of more modern methods and implements such as tractors; but such labour saving devices wou^ . presumably only aggravate the redundancy of labour on the farms and worsen, if anything, the lot of the fellabin. 29* This is dealt with in paragraph 5 above. (d) I mprovement of the lot of the Fellahin * 30. The heavy burden of high land rents on tenant cultivators is at last receiving attention in Parliament, and Mustafa Marei Bey, Minister of State, announced at the beginning of April 1949, the preparation of a Bill aimed at reducing them. He described the Bill as one of the most important ever considered in the way of social reform. further step in the same direction, though of limited application owing to the relatively small total area of land available for distribution, aims at the creation of a class of land owning peasants, a Bill recently approved by the Social Affairs and Labour Committee of the Senate, and now being studied by the same Minister, provides that future sales of Government agricultural land will be only in 3 to 5 acre plots and that each plot shall be provided with a house and public utilities. Government loans to enable purchasers to require these small holdings will be available, repayment being over a period of 30 years, without interest, a beginning had in fact already been made with this* type of settlement: in March 1948, the King opened an estate in Gharbieh province consisting of 600 5-acre plots of which the Government is the landlord. 31- (e) Housing. Yet another project which is receiving study is one put forward by the Ministry of Social .affairs, which proposes a 10-year plan for the construction of* 40,000 town dwellings and 100,0000 country dwellings annually at a cost of £.E.i6 millions. Under this plan the Government would raise the money by an internal loan at 2i to 3 per cent and make advances of up to two-tbirds to any/( S~7J 35./ 17 - any organisation prepared to build dwellings of the type required. Priority in the allocation of the town dwellings would go to families with incomes below £,E.9 per month, (f) Industrial Development , 32. The initiation at long last of the construction of a hydro-electric power station at the Aswan dam is dealt with in paragraph 20 above. The utilisation of some of the power to be generated for the production of nitrogenous fertilisers has been contemplated for many years, and an international commission was asked in 1947 to report on the possibilities. The Government appears to have decided in principle that this scheme shall be realised, but no plans have been elaborated. Since the earliest date mentioned for the beginning of generation of power at Aswan is 1953* -nd full operation of the station will certainly not begin before 1955* fertiliser production is an evon more remote project. (See also paragraph 5)* 33. Attention has been drawn recently to the iron ore deposits near Aswan and to the possibility of founding an iron and steel industry thereon. Another international coirmission visited Egypt in February 1949 to study the economic possibility of utilising Aswan-generated electric power in smelting the ore with a view to economising coke. Another body of opinion within the Government favours normal blast furnace practice, with steelworks probably on the coast or at an existing port. Here again no detailed plans have been made, and the widely-advertised project may possibly be shelved. 34. There have been several promising new strikes of oil in the past year, but the expansion of refinery capacity by Anglo- Egyptian Oilfields Limited (Shell) to exploit them to the utmost is held up by Gove nment obstruction over leases of land, etc#18 - 35» The Government’s own refinery is to be extended, * ' tenders having been invited for the supply of the necessary equipment. The Government have ruled that no crude oil is to be exported, but by their selfish attitude are discouraging the foreign companies who have found the oil from refining it in Egypt.IV. The Extent to which future development will depend on external assistance . External financial assistance . 36. The vast Nile Waters schemes referred to in paragraph 26 above will most probably cost more than £100 millions, and though the expenditure may be spread out over as much as 20 years it may be beyond Eygpt's power to meet her full share of the cost (some 75 -80%) without outside help in the form of loans. Leaving these schemes aside, however, there appears to be no reason why Egypt should not finance most of the other projects mentioned above, either out of the General Reserve, out of current revenue or by floating of internal loans. The Palestine adventure may have slightly depleted the General Reserve and put an unwonted strain on the budget; but direct taxation in Egypt is low and its general level will not be high even when the new ’’progressive income tax” or supertax comes into force - and the national debt is very small (a mere £.E .125 millions at the beginning of 1947), while thene are ample funds seeking investment in the country. The Egyptian Government may, however, ask for assistance in the shape of loans of hard currency to facilitate the purchase of goods only obtainable in the hard currency area. As reported above (paragraph 27), they have already asked the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development for a loan for the Qena irrigation scheme. This request may well be the result of a misapprehension that International Bank loans are always made in United States dollars. If that were.so the loan would provide a welcome increment to Egypt*s hard currency resources. It may well prove however that much of the equipment needed for this scheme, e.g. pumps, will be procurable in the United Kingdom. 37. In this connexion it is worth mentioning that the Egyptian company erecting the artificial fertiliser factory near Suez /referred..-m-—- - 20 - referred to in paragraph 5 above secured- a loan in 1946 of about £47 millions from the Export-Import Bank to finance ^ purchases'of machinery and equipment in the U*S.A # This is not a project in v/hich the Government is directly interested hut its importance, to the country’s agricultural economy is manifest. 38. It is also relevant to mention a contribution of £.E. 2.- millions , to which His Majesty’s Government i s already committed, out of the profits of the Anglo-^Egyptian Ootton Buying Commissions of 1940-41 to the cost of the village drinking water scheme on condition that the Egyptian Government make equal contributions. The Egyptian Government has not yet asked for any of this money to be handed over. b) External material assistance . 39. On the other hand Egypt is and will remain dependent on foreign countries for the supply of materials and equipment. Public interest at the moment seems to be concentrated on irrigation schemes, particularly the Qena and Aswan basin tube- well irrigation scheme, and for this purpose very large numbers of pumping sets will be required. Pumps, again, are needed for the villages drinking water project, as well as pipes, while electric generating machinery, diesel and electric motors, tractors and other agricultural machinery, chemical plant for the fertiliser factory, and large quantities of constructional steel are among the many items which are being insistently demanded from abroad. The world demand for this type of material, arising from a plethora of development schemes, is probably much in excess of world capacity to produce, and Egyptian development schemes are therefore likely to be held up by sheer shortage of supply, quite apart from hard currency stringency which limits procurement from the hard currency area. 40. During the recent Anglo-Egyptian financial negotiations the /Egyptian? - 21 - Sgyptian side repeatedly stressed the point that it was essential to maintain an ample flow of capital goods into the country in order to prevent social unrest. This danger was, presumably, deliberately exaggerated as it provided the Egyptians with a useful talking point. But there is no doubt that the Egyptian Government are convinced of the necessity of doing something without delay to improve the living conditions of the mass of the population; and that they expect the rest of the world to provide them with the tools for the Job. c) External technical assistance . Ul. This, too, will be needed by Egypt in the solution Of her problems, though, due to her conviction that there are plenty of Egyptians possessing the necessary technical skill and experience, her demand is likely to be less insistent. 42. Technical assistance falls into three types (a) assistance and advice by individual experts to Government departments and planning organisations; (b) the services of consulting engineers in connexion with specific projects; (c) the services of foreign contracting firms. 43. As regards a) the Egyptian Government continues to show a welcome tendency to call in the services of experts: about a year ago experts on food canning, industrial chemistry, iron smelting and business efficiency were appointed; and three international commissions, of three to five members each, have been appointed in the last two years to examine and report on different aspects of the Aswan hydro-electric scheme. Other foreign experts of various nationalities have been called in for short periods to advise on certain projects. In addition the experts attached to the British Middle East Office are available for consultation by the Egyptian Government and are frequently so consulted. One has the impression that the reports produced by the experts specially appointed by the Egyptian Government tend to be /pigeonholed- * 2 - pigeonholed in some Government Department, 'but no doubt in time they will bear some fruit. Vl . Consulting engineers used regularly to be appointed by the Egyptain Government for large public works projects, but the Government now take the view that their own engineers are fully competent, and have dropped the practice. A British firm of consultants was, however, appointed for the Aswan hydro-electric scheme, and it may be that the Egyptian Government will realise the value of such assistance when they come to tackle large projects. 45. Public works contracting and c :nstructional engineering has developed considerably in Egypt in.the last 10 years, and quite large contracts (costing £.E.l million for instance) are now being handled by local firms. But there is still a field for foreign enterprise, particularly where the work is of a specialised type. The £.E.3 million Edfina barrage went to a foreign contractor, and there is talk of entrusting the drilling of wells for the Qena Project to an American firm..48. - 23 - V- The extent to which H.lvL Government shjuld attempt to provide assistance, either singly or in conjunction with the U.S.A . 46. ^ Egypt claims from the United Kingdom financial assistance of a special kind, viz:- releases from her blocked sterling balances, and a hard currency allocation. The amount of this form of assistance which can be rendered, is however, determined by many considerations besides Egyp^s stated needs, and sterling releases in particular imply unrequited export* from the United Kingdom, Moreover, it has yet to be demonstrated that the speed at which the Egyptian Government can prepare development plans is such that their execution is being seriously delayed by the non-availability of equipment. The question of the sterling balances is nevertheless relevant to a consideration of the possibility of helping Egypt to solve her economic and social problems. 47. Apart from the above, the assistance which Egypt expects to receive from us is mainly material (i,e. the supply of goods) and technical. As regards the latter, the existence of the British Middle East Office f s pool of experts shows that His Majesty^ Government has accepted the principle of providing such assistance; .and we should continue to use every endeavour to find experts for special posts which the Egyptian Government wish to fill. Owing to the Egyptians* acute national consciousness it is sometimes a delicate matter to give them advice or help unless they first ask for it, and we must thus be prepared to adopt a waiting attitude. The Egyptian Government do and will, of course, seek advice from other countries as well as the United Kingdom, including particularly the U.S.A. for whose technical achievements they have a keen admiration; but there seems to be no reason why the provision of industrial experts should not be a matter for consultation between the British and American Governments.48. Another possible form of technical assistance is the training of industrial technicians and supervisors in foremanship and industrial organisation as well as in technical subjects. The Egyptian Government and Egyptian firms alike are beginning to see the advantages of such training and to look to the United Kingdom to provide it; but difficulties have been encountered, both in finding factories in the United Kingdom willing to accept candidates for their practical training, and also (in one instance) in arranging for an instructor to come to Egypt. 49. Instruction in the English language and other subjects by British teachers is not irrelevant to this subject. The Egyptian Government are perturbed by the apparent reluctance of British teachers to serve in Egyptian educational institutions, and have requested His Majesty’s Government’s help. The position may be improved by proposals now r under discussion with the British Council for the secondment of teachers of English from the United Kingdom. 50. In the field of material assistance the British delegation to the financial and trade negotiations of January/March 1949 emphasised that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to facilitate, as far as possible, the supply of material and equipment required for development projects sponsored by the Egyptian Government, and the annex to one of the letters exchanged on 31st March embodies an estimate of the -amounts of certain categories of goods which are expected to be available for export to Egypt during 1949. His Majesty's Government is thus committed to assist Egypt in this field, and it is to be hoped that United Kingdom industry will play its part and that the industrial situation will maintain the present improvement. 31. The actual procurement by the Egyptian Government ofthe material required for development is, however, mainly a commereial matter, as was stressed in the financial negotiations. Owing to Egypt’s shortage of hard currency and to the sterling balances the United Kingdom has a preferential position as a supplier. This should not, however, relieve United Kingdom exporters of the necessity for making their offers as competitive as possible, as regards both price, delivery dates and terms of contract. Firms on the Continent of Europe, by going further to meet the Egyptians' wishes, are making inroads in several sections of the capital goods market which used to be predominantly British preserves. The Egyptians should be given no grounds for suggesting that United Kingdom firms are hampering the economic and social development of Egypt or that the United Kingdom is failing to implement her oft- expressed promises of help in this respect. 52. The supply of capital goods being a commercial matter, there is no field for co-operation between the British and American Governments. On the contrary, United Kingdom and U.S.A. manufacturers are in keen competition. • The extent to which assistance may bo expected from international -agencies. 53* Egypt is fully alive to the opportunities for obtaining assistance provided by international agencies. As indicated in paragraph 36 above, there seems to be no reason why she should apply for any straight financial help (except in the case of the vast Nile projects), or at any rate why she should be granted any if she does apply. She will, however, probably ask for assistance in the form of loans of hard currency. The application to the International Bank for a loan for the Q.ena irrigation project is one example of such a request. Another, though not related specifically56. - 26 - specifically to the question of economic development, is Egypt’s intention, expressed during the recent financial ; negotiations, of drawing on the International Monetary Fund up to the maximum limit (15 million dollars). Unless however, the preparation of detailed plans for development projects is considerably accelerated beyond its present tempo, Egypt’s demand for capital goods does not seem likely to overtax the capacity of the sterling and transferable account areas, except for such commodities as constructional steel and rails, in other words, Egypt should be able to get most of her requirements for sterling. 5k. International technical agencies such as the F.A.O, have scarcely been going long enough for it to be possible to say what technical help they could give Egypt. There is a Middle Eastern branch of F.A.O. on which Egypt could call for assistance. An Egyptian is Head of the Middle East Regional Office of the W.H.O. VII. Gonclusion 55' Egypt 1 s fundamental economic problem is agrarian; the problem of a peasant population of 15 million whose numbers are constantly increasing and whose standard of living has been declining in recent years. Irrigation schemes are a long term and partial solution; the rural welfare services are palliatives; but the first essential of any general improvement in the standard of life is a radical- agrarian reform which will involve a major redistribution of wealth. There is no immediate prospect of Egyptian landowners accepting such a reform or of any Egyptian Government being sufficiently independent of them to impose it.The new 56, There are however growing signs of progress. ’’progressive tax”, which has at last passed into law, is an .cceptance of the principle of a higher rate of direct taxation on the larger incomes; and at the same time there is a healthy insistence on the importance of economic development rather than mere welfare. There are signs, too, that the public is no longer ready to be fobbed off by blaming the British and even the popular Nationalist writer, Fikri Abaza Pasha, has recently pointed out that, although Egyptians used to blame the British for paralysing reforms and obstructing progress in order to prolong their domination, there have now been national governments in Egypt for 24 years which have failed to tackle her internal problems effectively. 57. The remedy is largely in the Egyptians* own hands. The intensification of irrigation and the conservation of water resources to this end which has been proceeding for over fifty years, and the present Government’s preoccupation with land rent (see paragraph 30 above) show that the problem has been correctly diagnosed but the greatest difficulty is in trying to fit too many bodies into too few acres. The greatest obstacles to its solution are inherent in the Egyptian national character: the lack of the stamina and drive necessary to elaborate plans down to the last detail and to carry them through, and - more particularly - the corruption, selfishness, and lack of a sense of civic responsibility of the greater part of the iiigyptian upper and middle classes, civil servants and professional men alike, which make them reluctant to undertake any task or to live in any environment which is tiring, uncomfortable or unhealthy. These defects must be overcome if Egypt s problem is ever to be fully solved.y fijj (fjl ■V) * FOREIGN OFFICE, I.

Fowler, Esq. , COMMONWEALTH RELATIONS OFFICE.1. Introduction With a population of about millions, Iraq is at present a backward, poor and undeveloped country. Her infant mortality rate is estimated to be as high as 60$ and the population is said to be at present barely increasing. Immense possibilities of economic development nevertheless exist, which, if exploited, could transform Iraq into a rich and prosperous state. These lie in (a) her oil resources, (b) her river water resources, and (c) her rainfed area agricultural resources, which if properly developed could result in a tremendous expansion of agricultural production, enabling Iraq to become a granary of the Middle East, The development of the country cannot, however, take place without administrative and social reform and assistance from outside sources in the form of technical advice and capital investment. 2* An&amp;lo-Iraqi Treaty: An outstanding factor affecting British economic policy towards Iraq is the existence of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Allianca and the tradition of British technical assistance which has resulted from it. The Iraqis are entitled to expect substantial benefits from the alliance and its existence must, at all times, colour our attitude towards oil requests for help in whatever form they are received. The number of British officials in Iraq was 276 .in 1929, 236 in 1939 and 233 in 1946- At present, partly for financial .reasons l?ut partly also to propitiate internal xenophobia, the Iraq Government is deliberately reducing the number of foreign experts employed and is making few new appointments. 3• Plans for Economic and Social Development : Present Position . A beginning has been made in drawing up plans for economic and social development and in starting work on certain specific- 2 - specific projects. The present position may be summarised as . follows:- ^ (a) Communic ?.tions (i) Railways The Iraqi State Railways Administration (which is directed by British officials and has an independent budget) has drawn up a programme of development works, estimated to cost about £10 millions. The plans includo three bridges over the Euphrates, Tigris and Lesser Zab rivers, a new railway station and layout at Bagdad, a seventy mile rail extension from Kirkuk to Brbil in Northern Iraq and the purchase of rolling stock in the United Kingdom. Work on them has now been put in hand and £4i million has already $&gt;een expended. In order, however, to enable the works to be completed it will be essential for the Railway Administration to receive a loan from outsida sources of £3 to £6 millions. Certain of these works - e.g. the Bagdad railway station - .are considered to be unnecessary and unduly costly in relation to Iraq*s present development needs and resources. Tentative nlans have also been prepared for the considerable expansion of the Iraqi railway system both internally and by construction of new linos linking Iraq with Turkey and Syria. The estimated cost of these long-term projects is about £34 million of which £15 millions would be spent in the purchase of equipment abroad. There are strategic reasons why we might not wish to encourage these long term projects. These reasons, however, would be outweighed if the projects were considered important to the economic development of the country. In September 1947 the Iraq Government asked His Majesty’s Government to select for them a railway commission composed of three senior British experts to advise on the railway Administration long term plans and also on the co-ordinated development- 3 - development of railway, road and water transport. Unfortunately, however, before the team had been found the request was withdrawn owing to the change of government after the failure of the Portsmouth Treaty, and has not since been removed* (li) Roads In 1947, the Iraq Government requested His Majesty’s Government to recruit for them six senior British road engineers to carry out the road development of the country. Although candidates were found for all these posts, the Iraqis eventually only decided to appoint a Chief Road Engineer (Mr. J.B. Skinner of the Ministry of Transport) and to fill one other post for one year. Mr. Skinner has prepared a ten year road development plan for new first class roads linking the main towns of Iraq. The estimated cost cf this programme is £14,500,000. First priority will probably be given to completion of roads from Bagdad to Kirkuk and Bagdad to Basra. Mr• Skinner is insisting that this work should be put out to internationally reputed contractors and that competent British staff should be engaged to supervise it. At present, funds to embark on this programme are not yet in sight. (1U) Civil Aviation- 4 - (&lt;7J : (b) . Flood Control and Irrigation A British Irrigation Development Commission appointed :-; 0 arly in 1946 to draw up plans for the irrigation developmsjit of the country. The results of the Commission's work (which v is now almost completed) are described in greater detail in m.e,(o) (49)5 of t;he 1st April. Detailed plans for flood control and water storage works have been prepared and- a tentative scheme for distribution works, lands drainage, * .• . .electricity works and improved river navigation has boon outlined. These plans will enable the area under irrigation in Iraq to be expanded from the present figure of less than * 7 million acres to about 16 million acres. The total cost involved is estimated at £91.515 millions divided as follows:-- Flood control and storage £22.375.million Irrigation development Drainage . Power Navigation »r. £35.26 £23.88 £6.35 million■ £3.65 41 Development on this immense scale must necessarily take place gradually and in step with the growth of the population and the mechanisation of agriculture. The Irrigation Commission consider that the full development outlined above is unlikely t' to be required-before the end of. the century. Spread .out over this period, the cost would involve gin average annual expenditure of about £2 million only. Meanwhile, the immediate needs are flood control, limited irrigation development and drainage and reclamation in the old irrigated areas. On this basis the Commission has recommended a progranme of works for the next ten years involving an expenditure of £20 million, (or £2-million por annum), the estimated breakdown of which into dollars, dibars and sterling is as follows: £4.4 millions :. jL 19.3 millions I.D. 10*5 .millions. Work has now already begun- 5 - bagun on tho first stage of the water storage works which tho Commission has prepared for the Euphrates. An estimate of the cost of the first stages of these works in^ terms of foreign.and local expenditure has been prepared for the * * * . * •' • * ' . r 1 ‘ International Bank as follows:- ; ' : * ** Project Period for Sterling . Dollar ;’•) .• ' ' Completion cost cost' '- • cost Completion of Habbaniyah r-rv project. • 3 years £ 50 Q'pOQQ&gt; - ..ID 1 , 700,000 First Stage r Wadi Tharthar project 5 years £1,437,700 £6,483,200 ID 3,921,200 Gibraltar dam on Diyala 3 ' £1,256,000 £ 360^000 ID 1,288,000 Total £2,993,700 ^6,643,200 ID 6,^09,200 The Commisston anticipates that a large proportion of the capital expenditure, will be recovered from the increase in land values resulting .from the flood control and irrigation works, and 'that revenue sufficient*, to make the various projects productive will be obtained. They have submitted detailed proposals to the Iraq Government for a,taxation system to cover the cost of the works! involving, the levying of taxes on urban property, irrigated land and tho crops produced. &lt; - . The Iraq Government has now decided to disband the Haigh Commission at the end of June. We are however urging them to postpone this disbandment attleast until after the proposed Visit of the International Bank*s technical mission .(see paragraph 5 • ; t . • \ ’ &gt; K below.) ‘ ' ..., • • • ( c ) Agriculture: . • • In addition to the., possibilities of expanding irrigated cultivation, described in paragraph (a) above, there are great • * . V . i • possibilities of agricultural development in the rainfall zone in Northern Iraq. In this area it is estimated that the total cultivable land is about 10 million acres, while the total land at present cultivated annually is only about I? million* ‘acres. • * • . • ' ' . '• . . • There- 6 - There are also considerable possibilities of livestock and 7 ' ? . ‘ ; v. ; .N _ » fishery development, while agricultural pest control is an 7 t • important need in Iraq. Development of Iraq's agriculture J / * r i will, however, be conditioned by the basic factor of shortage of population. Apart from this factor, it will necessarily be a long-term process, since the first requirements are (a) research into agronomic factors, pest control, livestock improvement, soil chemistry, use of fertilisers, plant breeding and plant physiology; (b) a great expansion of agricultural extension work; (c) an expansion of mechanisation; (d) land tenure reform, to break down the power of the Sheikhs, improve the position of the small cultivator, and make possible the development of State land; and, as a corollary to such + .. ... reform, legislation to forestall speculation in land made cultivable by development. • (i) Recruitment •of Experts: ;• ,In recognition • of the importance of the first two .. requirements, the-Iraq Government have during the-past three years asked His Majesty’s Government to;.recruit.:£or them some 25 * senior Bri tish agricultural experts to serve in their Ministry of National Economy. After an extensive’.and ^difficult search, candidates were found for the majority of these posts. In the event, however, ,the -Iraqis only-made six appointments. Of. these, two botanists are now-in Bagdad, An animal husbandry expert and an agricultural machinery expert were appointed but their contracts have already been terminated prematurely, and an entomologist and a soil technologist have been offered posts but have not yet accepted,- * All the other posts - including the most important of all, that of ' agronomist - have boon either cancelled or held in abeyance. Sir Herbert Stewart, Agricultural Adviser to the British Middle East Office, has now recommended that the v appointment1 - 7 appointment of the following foreign exports is essential to the agricultural development of Iraq: (i) an agronomist (ii) a soil technologist (Hi) a director of agricultural machinery (iv) an entomologist (v) a soil conservation officer for the North (vi) an agricultural education adviser (vii) a forest officer (but see (d) below) (viii) an extension services officer (lx) a director of agricultural research (x) an economic botanist (xi) an animal husbandry officer (xii) a sheep-breeding officer and wool expert (xiii) an expert in co-operative organisations*. (but see (h) below) (ii) Mechanisation of Agriculture: The Iraq Government at present owns about 100 tractors, and there are about 400 tractors in private hands in the country#. Taking into account the large numbers of tractors known to be out of action, the area under mechanised cultivation may bo about 150,000 acres* In 1947 the Government planned to increase the numbers of tractors in the country to 2,000, but was unable to carry out this programme owing to shortage of funds*. A bill has now been submitted to the Majlis to set up an Administrative Council to control the importation, sale and distribution of all agricultural machinery, thereby completely eliminating private trade* The Government has also submitted a request to the International Bank for a loan of an equivalent of 4 million dinars to enable it to carry out a ten year scheme for the mechanisation of agriculture, involving an area of 460,000 acres. There should not be any great difficultydifficulty in meeting this annual demand of equipment from the United Kingdom. (iii) Land tenure reform and land •devolopment legislation No Iraqi Government is at present willing to grapple with these measures, in view of the powerful vested interests involved. It is hoped that the Central Development Board, when set up, will be able to secure some action in this field. (d) Forestry: In 1946 the Iraqi Government appointed Mr. G.W. Chapman of the Colonial Forest Service as head of their Forestry Department, and a junior British forestry officer was appointed this year to assist Mr. Chapman. During his three years in Iraq Mr. Chapman has laid the foundations for the sound forestry development of the country. He has set on foot a forestry survey, drafted forest legislation, established demonstration plantations and experiments, organised the recruitment and training of the Forestry Service and generally laid the basis for a sound policy of long-term development. The Iraq Government has now decided to review Mr. Chapman^s contract at a considerably higher salary. (£2 # 220 p. a.). (see paragraph 6 below). (e) Health Services: Durii|g the past three years the Iraq Government has increased the number of British medical professors and specialists employed at the Royal Medical College, Bagdad, and in provincial hospitals. Of particular importance is the recent appointment of Dr. J.M. Watson, a specialist in bilharzia, as professor of biology. Dr. Watson■ - 9 - Dr. Watson has already written a report for the Iraq Government;, on hilhahzia research and control and it is •v *• .v ' _ ^ hoped that as and when the irrigation schemes mature, he will be able to ensure that this vital aspect of public health is adequately dealt with. • Another important appointment which has .lust been made is that of a Tuberculosis Expert, Dr. Doherty. Meanwhile Iraq ! s outstanding needs in the medical field are considered to be;* (a) the appointment of a senior British public health expert to organise the Public Health Services of the country; (b) improvement of the nursing services; (c) expansion of teaching facilities in the basic medical sciences. As regards (b), we hope to persuade the Iraqi authorities to invite Dame Katherine Watt, Chief Nursing Adviser to the Ministry of Health, to pay a visit of inspection to Iraq later this year. (f) Statistics: Dr. J. Murray, the Statistical Adviser to the B.M.E.O. has spent a considerable.,proportion of his time during the past two years in Iraq, where he has organised a Central Statistical Office for the Iraq Government and re-organised the statistical sections of all their Government Departments. As a result largely of his work the first census ever to bo taken in Iraq has just been completed with particular efficiency. (its results are not yet available). Dr # Murray’s work will prove of outstanding importance as detailed development planning proceeds. (g) Labour ' Mr. M.T. Audsley, the Labour Adviser to the B.M.E.O. has paid a number of visits to Iraq during the past three years(i) 10 - years. The country has no Social Insurance system, no coherent Trade Union policy and no adequate labour Department. The development of a sound labour policy is considered to be urgent since the cost of living (which is now about 6^- times what it was before the war), is out of aj.1 proportion to the wage structure of the country and this in its turn is completely unbalanced as between the various principal industrial undertakings. In these circumstances, there is growing distress and unrest. The Iraq Petroleum Oompany is, however, setting an outstanding example, not only by the high rates of wages paid, but by the welfare amenities it provides and the action which it is taking to promote industrial trading, co-operation and trade union development. On Mr. Audsl 9 y f s advice the Iraq Government has now decided to appoint a British Social and Labour Adviser to prepare a comprehensive labour plan for the country and supervise its execution. A search for a candidate is now being made. Owing however to the inadequate salary offered it is considered necessary that we shall subsidise this post if it is to be suitably filled. (h) Co -operative Development In. 1946, Mr. B.J. Surridge, at present Co-operative Adviser to the Colonial Office, was appointed by the Iraq Government to draw' up a plan for agricultural co-operative development. No action, has, yet been taken on Mr. Surridge * s report, but it is hoped that the British labour adviser when appointed (see paragraph (g) above)will be able to follow it up. Meanwhile Mr. Marriott, Co-operative Adviser to the A.I.O.C., has paid valuable short-term visits to the I.P.C. and the Iraqi State Railways.mm* 1 - 11 - (i) Oil Production : Oil production in Iraq fell from 4.7 million- tons in ^ 1946 to 3*5 million tons in 1948* ns a result of the closure of the Haifa pipeline. If the oil companies 1 development plans go according to schedule, and the pipeline is re-opened soon, production should rise to 13«5 million tons in 1951 and 30 million tons in 1956. At the present rate of oil royalties this would mean that by 1951# receipts would amount to nearly £6 million, and by 1956 to about £13 million. As a result of the current negotiations between the Iraq Government and the Iraq Petroleum Company for the revision of the latter's concession, the oil royalty rate may well be increased by as much as 50 $ or even more. (&lt;) Sstablishment of a University at Bagdad . * (See Footnote 1) In 1948, Dr. A.S. Morgan of the British Council and Professor Sir Charles Darwin prepared for the Iraq Government a plan for the establishment of a University at Bagdad. No estimate of the cost was made, but it was pointed out that capital expenditure running into £ millions was likely to be required. In this plan attention was drawn to the importance of relating the output of University graduates in the scientific and engineering fields to the output of trained technicians of the supervisory grades. It was therefore recommended that the establishment of the university should be preceded by the building up of a system of technical and agricultural education, involving the re-organisation of the existing Engineering College, and the establishment of Agricultural and Commercial Colleges. A preparatory college to fill the present vacuum between the University and Secondary School standards should also bo established* It is understood that the present Iraq Minister of Educationsanction h^s now decided to adopt an alternative plan. He is said to have established a University by the si.irXe process of. .incorporating. into ony* unity, the existing schools of Law, Medicine and jlngineering and one ♦or more Institutions.- of higher studies. ‘ He hopes gradually to raise the standard, of these colleges to trjis University level. V/e consider important to the success of this project: .» ' (i) that a British principal to the University should be appointed; and • • ’ (li) that the University shall be a corporate organisation independent of the Ministry of Education. .. • , . . . '' 5 - S^abllshmoqt of a Cent ral Development In 1947 it was suggested to the Iraij Prime Minister by His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad and the Head of the B.M.3.0. that it was most important that a Central Development Board, composed of older statesmen and senior experts who were outside politics and with funds under Its direct control, should be set up to plan, co-ordinate «n&lt;i In certain fields carry .out, the long-term development of the country and that .a British secretary should be ^appointed to this Board who would, we hoped, largely direct its activities. ; ’ * i We consider that the functions of the Board should be to survey the general resources of the State’, to produce plans for the co-ordinated development of those resources, to draw up detailed plans for projects, to decide priority between projects and to arrange the execution of the .projects in such a manner as may seom suitable to thorn. it should have the power to propose legislation to be. introduced by a Minister, to provide for the administration of projects such as the distribution of newly irrigated land and the recovery of taxes or special charges from those benefiting from-.from the projects. It should also have' po'we'r to-propose - to the Council of Ministers legislation, ihclndihg fiscal * 4 * - - l • . . . % * * ‘ * * * } ..legislation, generally designodto promote dbvdiopment, ^It „ '* * •' ‘ • • r,. . .... Should have oxecutivo powers required for the completion of each project until the stage when it becomes &amp; matter for normal administration, which must be done' by the Government departments. It should have power to arrange for the flotation of companies to develop the resources of the State under which the State would contribute part of the capital and take part in the management. It should co-ordinate and control the development projects of the Iraqi State r/ Railways and the Basra Port Directorate. • The present Prime Minister has now decided to press , ahead with the constitution of a Development Board and a Bill will very shortly be submitted to the Majlis. We do not, however, consider this Bill satisfactory. It does pot give the Board a sufficiently comprehensive function, v nor endow it with executive powers, and the fund's to bo assigned to it are limited to such funds as the International Bank may make available. Moreover too much weight is given to political representation. His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad is pressing for the redrafting of the Bill after the International Bank has been consulted. The Iraqi Prime Minister has not yet committed himself to the appointment of British Secretary to the Board. 5# Financial situation: (See also O.N. (49)53'of 7th February). The present f inancial situation ..of Iraq is precarious# In 1947 the budget was comfortably balanced and the Government was proposing to set asids a reserve for development. In 1948 the Government developed a budget deficit running at the rate-of £1 million per month, which rendered- 14 - rondored it very difficult to meet such important current commitments as payment of Civil Service salaries and payments to British contractors engaged on railway and irrigation capital'works, (see paragraph 3 (a) and .. (b) above)). This state of affairs is the result of (a) bad budgeting combined with internal mal-administration and inefficiency and in particular the non-collection of taxes; and (b) the financial strain of the- Palestinian war. The balance of payments situation is also very serious. Complete figures are not yet available for 1948 but the deficit for the year on visible trade is likely to be in the region of £20 millions, imports being estimated at £45 million. The result has been that the generous sterling balance releases for which we provided the order to facilitate the development.programme have been largely frittered away. The-total.of Iraq’s sterling balances (blocked and unblocked) is now only some £9 million in excess of the amo-unt. required for 100 # currency cover. The Iraq Government have now tightened up import licence control, but they have not accepted a suggestion which we have made-that British Customs Collectors should be appointed at Bagdad and Basra. To meet the immediate crises the Iraq Government has had to resort to borrowing from.the Banks and from the Iraq Currency Board to the extent of over £7i million. They have also received advances of oil royalties due up to the end of 1949 and they are hoping to obtain a substantial loan of somo £millions from the I.P.C. as part of the arrangements for a revision of the Company’s concession. Meanwhile, the Government is'making a determined effort to balance the budget for 1949-1950, and to provide a surplus. • • bymm - - 15 - by means of increased taxation, and the reduction of departmental expenditure and the high cost of living •allowances. As soon as we are satisfied that raasonabl » ; ^progress towards reform has been made, we propose to authorise tho Iraq Government to raise a railway loan of \ £3 million in London to meet outstanding commitments to United Kingdom firms engaged in the projects described in paragraph 3(a) (i) above. Prom a short-term’point of view, ' therefore, there is reasonable hope that the financial position will soon be stabilised. Prom a long-term point of view, in 3-10 years f time, Iraq should have all tho funds she needs for development - and more - from oil royalty receipts (see 3(i) above). In the interim period, however, it will be essential for the Government to obtain a substantial foreign loan to enable the railway, road and irrigation development programmes to be carried out. . Meanwhile the Governor of the National Bank has stated that when he visits this country shortly he proposes to engage a very high-grade British financial adviser who would visit Iraq a ‘ * . - » few. months in the year to advise both the Bank and the Minister of Finance. The Iraq Government have now made an informal application for a loan of £19.3 millions from the International Bank of which £11.2 millions are for flood control and * ** irrigation development,£3•3 millions for road dovolopmont, and £3 millions for the t railways. • The Bank is at present examining in detail the possibility of a loan to meet the sterling and dollar requirements and possibly also the requirements of local currency for the first stage of the flood control schemes (see paragraph 3 (b) above.) They propose to send a technical Mission to Iraq in June to study the proposals in detail. It7 It is unlikely that at this stage loans for road and railway development will be granted. Before any loans are authorised, the Bank will need to be as.surod (i) that the Iraq Government is balancing its budget and setting its financial house in order, and (ii) that a properly constituted Development Board is being set up (see paragraph 4 above), 6. Terms of Service for British Experts, The Iraq Government has a standard contract form for the employment of British officials, and its terms are generally considered satisfactory. Great difficulty is, however, being experienced in filling outstanding posts offered by the Iraq Government because: (a) the salaries offered are inadequate,, both in relation to salaries in the United Kingdom and to the cost of living in Iraq, The basic salary normally offered for senior experts (e,g. medical professors-, labour advisers, agricult ural experts) is £1800 p.a, and for junior experts possessing academic qualifications is £1200 p.a. The salaries offered for posts of the technical or foreman grade are normally about £900-1000 p.a. In addition there has hitherto been a high cost-of-living allowance for all these posts of £288 per annum, but according to information just received this allowance is now being halved. Meanwhile the rates of Iraq's income tax levied on British officials are being increased. In view of the financial situation described in paragraph 5 above the Government does not at present feel in a position to offer higher salaries, even for posts of outstanding importance such as that of Labour Adviser (see paragraph 3(g) above)), (b) the length of contract offered (normally 3 years) is too short17 - *¥Sf5l 7 # Targets for further development; It will be seen from the above that daring the past'' three years, plans for development and progress have been drawa up in many fields. The next step - and a far more difficult one - is to implomont these plans. To enable this to be done it is essential: (a) That the proposed Central Development Board constituted on the lines which both we and the International Bank consider desirable and with a British Secretary of high calibre, should be set up without delay. (see paragraph 4 above); (b) As an essential corollary to(a), that highly qualified foreign experts should be appointed to advise the main government departments on development policy and supervise its execution, (c) That a measure of administrative reform should be carried out, involving tax reforms, which the Iraqi/Govornment has put through on paper, and the reform of the civil service, (d) To the extent that exports of foodstuffs be aimed at, that Iraqi: prices should be brought into line with world prices. The targets for development which it will be the duty of the Central Development Board to consider to put in order of priority and in certain cases to execute may be summarised as follows:- (a) to carry out the plans prepared for capital development works in flood control and irrigation. (b) to appoint a foreign transport commission to examine the various projects for airfield, roads, railway, I.W.T. and port development and to draw up a list of priorities for implementation within, say thr'ee and ten yearsf'7*t - 18 - yoars respectively. (c) to embark on a co-ordinated long-term policy of agricultureal development involving large scale research work, agricultural extension work and the introduction of mechanisation and for this purpose to appoint eleven foreign experts; (d) to stimulate the Government to introduce land tenure reforms for existing cultivated land. (q) to draw up plans for th tenure and colonisation of newly developed land - e.g., to consider development by means of public utility corporations or regional boards; (f) to follow up the plans for forestry development, worked out by Mr. Chapman. (g) to follow up the Surridge report on co-operative development and to appoint a foreign co-operative expert; (h) to prepare plans for the development of adequate Public Health Services, to appoint a British expert to carry them out; and to arrange for Dame Katherine Watt, Chief Nursing Adviser to the Ministry of Health, to pay a visit of inspection to Iraq this year#19 - —! (i) To press ahead with the building up of a sound system of technical and agricultural training and of pre-University education as the basis for the establishment of a Tniversity at Bagdad; to arrange for such foreign experts as may be desirable to visit Iraq to advise on the promotion of particular branches of technical and pre-University education, and to appoint a British principal to the University. /.See footnote &lt;7 (5) to stimulate the Government to embark on a progressive labour policy in consultation with the British labour • adviser who is to be appointed. 8, Recommendations for action by His Majesty r a Government . (a) We should continue to urge the Iraq Government to set up immediately a Development Board on the lines indicated in paragraph l\ above and should do our best to find a suitable candidate for the Secretarship. (b) We should in principle encourage the making of a loan to Iraq by the International Bank and should give the Bank all possible support and assistance vis-a-vis the Iraqis. The detailed arrangements as regards a Bank loan will be for consideration in the light of recommendations made, in due course, by the Bank’s technical experts, (c) Since Iraq as a member of the sterling area draws her dollar requirements (which will include the servicing and repayment of any loan by the International Bank) from the Sterling area central reserves and our oil interests in Iraq give her a strong bargaining weapon in the negotiation of hard currency target agreements, we should, bear in mind the desirability73 ) 20 - desirability of meeting from United Kingdom sources Iraq’s requirements of capital goods for the development programmes. (d) We should concert with the United States Government and the International Bank, an agreed list of conditions v/hich both they and we should attach to any financial or other assistanco which it is decided to give to Iraq. Those conditions should include, e*.g. the satisfactory constitution of the Central Development Board, the appointment of British experts to certain key pofcts, and (in the case of a raiIway loan) the carrying out of a transport survey by a foreign transport commission. (See paragraph 7 (b) above),). (e) We should consult the United States Government on the question of the provision of experts under all the headings in paragraph 7 (a) to (j) above, with a .view to determining which could most appropriately be provided from British and which from United States sources - bearing in mind our special commitment under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. (f) We should consider the possibility of improving the conditions of service of British exports in Iraq, by (i) the working out of secondment arrangements from the United Kingdom, and (ii) subsidisation of certain posts in particular the post of labour adviser - see paragraph 3 (g) above. (g) since United States experts are most unlikely to be attracted by the terms at present offered# we should consult the U.3. Government on the question of the’improvement of terms of service. (h) In the field of education we should encourage the Iraqi Government: /See footnote 1.7. (i) to expand technical educational facilities by re-organising the existing Engineering College and establishing Agricultural and Commercial CollegesColleges as thu first stop towards the ostablishinent of a University; (ii) to establish a preparatory colloge to prepare secondary students for the University and Technical Colleges; (iii) to invite foreign experts to pay short visits to Iraq as may be required *. advise on the organisation of the Technical Colleges and the Preparatory College, (iv) severely to restrict the intake into the University itself and maintain its standard at a high level; / (v) to appoint a British principal to the University, ^ Footnote 1, This paper does not include reference to the question of training of technicians of the craftsman and foreman grades, which is being dealt with in a separate paper covering the Middle East as a whole.,I CABINET MID KiiBT (OPv'ICI/JO CCIC (76 SECRET E X * SYRIA Paper Ny the Foreign Office 6967 tf-tTv J 1 • IN TRODUCTION POLITICAL ( ) The termination of the French Mandate in 1945 left something of a vacuum in Syria, Twenty-five years of rigid foreign administration had left the country without experienced politicians or trained officials and without the means of evolving a stable Government. ( ) Owing to the high rate of illiteracy among the population (a feature common to all the Middle East countries) the Syrian Chamber of Deputies can never be truly representative and politics depend upon personalities rather than policies. The administration has, moreover, only a precarious control over the important Dru’ze tribes in the South and the Alaouites farther North. ( ) Since October 1946 when all political parties were suppressed there have no officially recognised parties. In the Chamber of Deputies which existed prior to the Husni el Zaim coup , the followers of the National Party held about 40 out of the 133 seats. This Party was created by ex-President Shukri Quwatly, was formerly led in the Chamber by Jamil Mardam and was generally pan-Arab and Nationalist, Its professed programme, v/hich it took no effective steps to implement, was the reorganisation of the machinery of Government and the improvement of agriculture, industry and the social services of the country, (,) The other blocs were the Parliamentary Constitution Party, which had issued no programme and which could be distinguished from the National Party only by its refusal always to follow blindly in Quwatly’s path; and a bloc of about 60 Deputies who were largely uninterested in internal or external /politicspolitics and who represented tribal or agricultural areas* Their support for the Government of* the day depended on ie success which that support would bring in meeting local requirements - tractors, lorries, a higher price for wheat and sheep, Government contracts, ( ) Syria, like other Arab States, has been left in a state of demoralisation and impoverishment by the Palestine war. Its impoverishment has been aggravated by the burden of the refugees, and by mismanagement of its finances, ( ) Little was known of Husni el Zaim at the time of the coup d f etat . He is a Kurd and has made his career in the Army, His coup was carried out with surprising speed and efficiency but, whilst he secured a vote of confidence from a little over half the Chamber of Depaties, it was only with great difficulty that he succeeded in persuading any of its members to form a Government with him. He has stated that he does not propose to alter the foreign policy of his predecessor and that his first objectives, after an armistice with Israel, are the ending of the quarrel with the Lebanon and the encouragement of foreign capital investment for the construction of oil pipe-lines* he has now r signed a legislative decree ratifying the Pranco-Syrian Monetary Convention negotiated by the previous Government and has informed His Majesty*s Minister that he hopes to reach early agreement with the Trans-Arabian Pipeline Company and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the I.O.C. in respect of the pipe-line conventions, ( ) ECONOMIC (a) POPULATION Despite a remarkably large urban population, conceatrated in Damascus, Aleppo, Latakia, Homs and Hama, the wealth of Syria is based on the country-side and depends either on agriculture or stock-raising, n N/ - .3 - ... ( ) The. settled population amounts to about 2,901,000 of whom 71.5% or about 2,076,000 are. classified as rural. The non-sedentary population consists of about 150,000 nomads and about 150,000 semi-sedentary persons, bringing the total population up to about 3,201,000. ( ) (t) AREA The. total area of Syria is about 57,900 square miles, of which about 15% or 5.5 million acres is at present under cultivation. About one third of the cultivable area is normally allowed to lie fallow. Approximately 10% of 'the 585,000,000 acres of cultivated land is irrigated. (o) AGRICULTURE (. ) Syria^ natural resources are such that .agriculture is, and will continue to be, the basis of her economy. The . expansion of. acrricultural productivity and of the cultivated area uer beod must rank first in imnortance. (. ) Less than half of the area potentially cultivable is now under cultivation. Howeve#.,! large portions of the potential farm lands fail to receive the minimum rainfall essential to cultivation during a substantial number of the crop years. A.ny agricultural expansion must. therefore be first of all in those areas which receiye a sufficient rainfall or thoae which ara adaptable to irrigation. ( ) Rainfall is..generally limited to the winter months (October - April) and the amount of rainfall is subject to considerable fluctuation. The present irrigated area can be almost tripled, from the present 585,000 acres to about 1,500,000 acres. The yield per acre can be raised considerably through improvement in methods, techniques and the introduction of better animal breeds and plant varieties.- 4 ~ ( ) Prom at least two angles Syrian agriculture may toe considered to toe one-sided* * Seasonally it is toadly d.^tritouted and apart from the limited cultivation done under irrigation and such cropping as is possible in the dry season in the relatively higher rainfall areas where the soil retains enough moisture for plant growth* it is almost a one-season-a~ year system. Moreover, the range of crops grown on any substantial scale is extremely limited. Cereals constitute almost a monopoly among field crops and occupy an area approaching 3 , 300,000 out of a total annual acreage of less than 4,000,000 acres under general field crops. Amongst cereals themselves, wheat accounts for more than 2,000,000 acres and barely for nearly 1,000,000, ( ) Agricultural Development can toe on two broad lines: (a) the more efficient use of the land at present under cultivation toy means of irrigation the use of fertilisers, the improvement of cultivation practices etc, (to) the extension of cultivation to land at present waste tout cultivable, preferable in areas suitable for mechanical cultivation and having an adequate rainfall# ( ) The area which offers the greatest scope for mechanical cultivation on an organised basis is the Jezira, Rain-fed farming can toe extended in the Northern belt parallel to the Turkish frontier. Here field crops and orchard fruits can toe. grown* The North-East corner is probably better suited 9 to cattle rearing than mechanised cultivation. Irrigated farming can toe extended toy developing the waters of the river Khatoour and other small rivers. The population is inadequate and there is room for bringing in suitable outsiders such as the Palestinian Arab cultivator refugees. But the construction of all-weather communications must proceed parallel with land utilisation. At the same time, drainage of certain areas, e.g. , the G-hato Valley and along the river Orontes can /play- 5 - % play a part in increasing production# ( ) A fairly complete land registration has resulted from the Land Survey 'begun in 1920 and the subsequent topographical and judicial commission. The Land Code of 1930 has to a large extent replaced the old Moslem Land Laws and the Ottoman Land Code, clarifying ownership and fixing the point of departure for real property rights at registration. The most important category of land is Miri, in which the State retains the right of ownership, while right of occupation is enjoyed 'by private individuals ■ who can sell, mortgage o: it (except to the Waqf). Continuous cultivation is essentia' 1 to prevent reversion to the State# This alone has caused much land abuse. There is considerable absentee landlordism and ^ * tenancy under share cropping systems* These factors, combined with indebtedness, reduce the efficiency of the cultivator# Masha - of 'communal ownership, with its various disadv&amp;atag&amp;$, the worst of which is periodical roallotment, is prevalent in the Eastern parts of the country, is an obstacle to development and encourages land abuse. The main agricultural population suffers from ignorance, poverty and the effects of some archaic land tenure system# A cadastral survey is necessary in Syria and a reform of the system of land tenure and of the ownership of water—rights will have to be devised if the farmer is to free himself from his financial thraldom to the landowner and the merchant. The farmer would be greatly helped too by the formatio v ' ^ cooperatives and of organisations to purchase and operate machinery. According to a recent unconfirmed report, a decree has now been issued directing that a Committee shall be formed to reconsider the Syrian State Laws and Regulations concerning state land and to propose whatever reforms are required 'In order to conform with world social and economic /evolution'- 6 - ovolation” and to fulfil tho following aims:- (a) to limit and restrict the right to land owners.wi.r in the general interest in accordance with rhe . principles of sDcial justice; (b) to lay the foundations for a distribution of L''a land among small peasants and workers and pent:. ; military and civil employees; (c) to draw up a system for a limited agricultural land company to guarantee state rights and e vo.lv. a plan for cooperative farms. (d) PRODUCTION AND INDUSTR Y { ) Tobacco and cotton are gro' 1 ?. in the maritime plain« skins, hides, leather goods, wool and silk. There is a cement factory at Dammar near Damascus and a considerablu fcaad-loom weaving industry specialising in the coarser g.:aci of textiles for local consumption. Brocade is also rracr exported, and copper and brass utensils are made local uL\ &lt;e) LABOUR(f) ROADS AND RAILWAYS ( ) The North-South arterial roads in Syria are probably adequate for present traffic needs and most areas are well served by secondary roads. At present however a major difficulty is the maintenance of existing roads. On the other hand, considerable expansion of all-weather communications facilities will be essential in the event of any extension of agricultural development (e.g. in the Jezira) ( ) The railway systems of Syria form a disconnected series which cannot operate in the best interests of the country. The disposition of the railway system does not in any way serve the potentially rich lands of the Euphrates Valley, which might be one of the most profitable areas for development if low priced transport were available. A feature of the communications system is that not one of the commercial and industrial centres as rail communications with a port on the Syrian coast. A railway from Latakia to Aleppo is a practicable proposition especially if the construction of a deep-water port at Latakia were decided upon. ( ) The Gibb Report (see paragraph below) recommended that the road and rail system of Syria should be integrated with a view to linking Aleppo with the Jezira ersa, the Iraqi frontier and Latakia, and Damascus with Homs and the coastal ports. The Report suggested that the system should be supplemented by feeder roads in the Jezira, and recommended that any new railways should be financed and owned by the State; owing to the lack of trained personnel they should be administered however by an operating company. ( ) Proposals for Anglo-French cooperation in the development of the Middle East railway system in the light of strategic /requirementsrequirements are at present under consideration 'by the interested Departments. The proposals envisage the ^ conversion of railway lines in Syria and the Lebanon to standard gauge with a view to their integration with lines running from Egypt eastwards. (g) CIVIL AVIATION » Only Air-Prance serves the Levant States before the war, but other foreign lines are now also well established, among them Pan-American World Airways, which alone maintains a service from New York to Damascus, and a round-the-world service via Damascus. Under an international agreement concluded in April, 1947, granting rights not yet extended to other foreign lines*, Pan-American are also entitled to pick up and discharge international traffic at Damascus. In 1946 it organised and staffed a local company, Syrian Airways, but financial difficulties forced the Company to close down early in 1948. Meanwhile plans have been drawn up for the construction of an international airport at Mezze, the cost of which, at a rough estimate, might amount to £3 million. (h) PORTS ( ) Because of the lack of a deep-water harbour, almost all of Syria’s overseas trade passes through Lebanese ports. For practical purposes there are only two places in which a port could.be established on the Syrian coast, Latakia and Tart 10 Traffic centred on Damascus will continue to use Beirut. The natural outlet for central Syria would be Tartus, and for the North, Latakia. The latter conforms most closely to the marine conditions required for a deep-water port. There is every Justification for carrying out investigations for a deep-water port there.9 (^ IjYDRQ- ELECTRIC DSVELOPMBNT AND FUEL AND PQ /KR ( ) The Euphrates could h.e an important source of hydro-electric power for Syria, 30,000kw. could be derived from the minimum flow. With water conservation, 100,000 kw. or more might be developed. The possibilities of the combination of hydro-electric development’ and water conservation in the Euphrates are of special interest to Syria. Much will depend however on the outcome of the projected electrification of the Lebanon under the Maasri Hydro-Electric Concession Scheme (estimated in 1947 at £10 million over a period of 10 years), which could no doubt be utilised to supply Syria also with electric power. ( ,;) The electricity supply generally speaking is insufficient unreliable and expensive owing to the high cost of fuel. Mr-* of the present plant and equipment is old and in need of replacements. There is a steadily increasing demand for electricity which the supply companies are unable to satisfy for lack of generating plant. It is estimated that the consumption of electricity in 10 years* time may be 4 to 6 times the present figure. It was recommended in the Gibb Report (see paragraph below) that the capacity of the plants at Aleppo and Damascus should be doubled within the next 5 years. (j) FORESTS ( ) Tho forests of Syria have suffered, like the‘forests of other parts of the Mediterranean region, from ruthless exploit’.on and the introduction of large herds of sheep and goats. Imports of wood are estimated at about 476,000 cubic metres annually and annual charcoal requirements are 40 &gt; 000 tons. The demand is unsatisfied and forest reserves- canru provide what is required on a replacement basis, at present. Reaffortestation of very considerable areas would confer /great- *10 - great benefit on the country by supplying timber and fuel, reducing erosion and conserving water supplies. The mair^ present need in natural regeneration to prevent soil erosion,- ( ) The forests include evergreenand deciduous oak, stone pine, Aleppo pine, cypress and juniper and the montane types. A considerable number of fruit-trees exist, both wild and in cultivation. Much of the country is highly suited to fruit cultivation on a large scale. ( ) The maintenance and extension of the forests depends on afforestation and the establishment of a forest police. Syria reformed its Forest Code in 1935&gt; but little effective action was taken until 1938, when two divisions of forest police were established, one in the North and the other in the South. The present Director of Forests has made wide acquisitions of reserves and created a better Forest Departmon. &gt; , But reservation has gone too fast for public opinion and the need is now to expand the Department, consolidate what has been gained, obtain more effective protection for natural regeneration and then launch into larger afforestation scher (k) FISHERIES ( ) The fisheries potentialities of Syria, both marine and inland, are unimportant. (l) MINERALS ( ) The only metallic minerals to be found in Syria are chromite, manganese ore and asbestos. The only non-metalli^ minerals are asphalt and building materials. (m) OIL ( ) Owing to the similarity of parts of Syria to those of other oil-bearing countries there is reasonable hope of discovering oil, but test borings have not so far produced results /FINANCEFINANCE ( ) On assuming the Mandate, France male Syria and the Lebanon c~u economic but not a political unit, and introduced a currency interchangeable with the franc. The Banque de Syrie et du Liban (a French Company in which substantial interests are held by the Ottoman Bank) became bank of issue and in general acted as central bank but engaged also in commercial banking an! actively promoted French interests, assisted by other Banks, particularly the Compagnie Algerionne do Credit ct de Banque, the Credit Fancier d’Algerie and (during the 1930’s) the Banque Nationale pour le Commerce et 1’Industrie. ( ) In 1944 the French Government promised to compensate the Syrians and the Lebanese for any reduction in the value of theie holdings of French francs which might be caused by the devaluation of the franc, and made an offer in September 1946.? contending however that the original promise applied to one- devaluation only and warning that no compensation for any further devaluations could be expected. The Syrians and the Lebanese asked His Majesty’s Government to intervene and at the same time proposed that their currency should be detached from the franc and should enter the Sterling Area. ( ) This proposal was rejoctod because (a) Syria and the Lebanon are not financially viable, having insufficient exports, visible or invisible, with which to pay for their imports. The imports of both countries increased 7-fold between 1937 and 1947 without any corresponding increase in exports, while the tourist trade and, to a lesser extent- remittances from abroad, which provided the bulk of their invisible exports, had declined.. 12 . (b) His Majesty^ Government could not afford to take over from Prance the responsibility for supplyl^ Syria and the Lebanon with hard currency for essential imports, (c) His Majesty’s Government could not afford to convex into stealing the large franc balance held by the two countries. The amount could only have been added to the blocked sterling balances with which we were already saddled. (d) inadequate exchange control machinery would inevitably start a leakage of currency from the Sterling Area. (...), In the event, the Lebanon initialled an agreement with Prance* The Syrian President and Prime Minister were unwilLP. to face the unpopularity of signing and became involved in the problem of creating a currency separate from that of the Lebanon and backed by Syrian resources. The Joint Exchange Control Committee and Council of Common Interests were abolished. The effect was to depreciate the Syrian pound in relation to the Lebanese pound, to run down the country’s currency reserves, and to involve Syria in payments fiiffio 1 -'' with her oil products supplies, ( ;) When the late Government, under Khaled el Asm, came int power, its first aim was to secure backing for a new Syrian currency (the present Syrian pound has now been unbacked for over a year). Azm began by signing an agreement with France which would, when ratified, have supplied cover for about c quarter of the money at present in circulation. He had hop^ to secure backing for the rest by signing agreements for the Trans-Arabian Pipeline and Anglo-Iranian companies to run pipelines through Syria, and by accepting the new 30-inch pipeline of the I.P.C. These agreements (which the previous /PrimePrime Minister, Jamil Mardam, had declined to sign, although they would have provided employment, currency and an easing of the oil supply position) were to c ontain a clause whereby Q0% of the local expenditure entailed should be paid over to the Syrian Government in hard currencies and reimbursed in Syrian pounds? ( ) At the same time, Azm was endeavouring to secure a settlement with the Lebanon of the quarrel about the • the control of imports and the respective shares of Customs dues from the union* ( ) Meanwhile, the unbalance in Syria’s 1 financial and econcmic life continued, Azm's budget for 1949, which showed an estimate expenditure of £Syrian 129,500,000, was absorbed as to 70% by the two items of (a) military expenditure and (b) civil service salaries. Development schemes in the North and East of the country, drawn up in 1947, had to be curtailed, while thousands of refugees from Palestine were an added burden to•the State. (. ) Trade returns (which are only available for Syria and vthe Lebanon combined) revealed the following state of affairs: First nine months (in me tric tons ) other agricultural products, silk cloth, clothing, raw silk, raw and tanned hides and shoes. There was a considerable trade with Palestine, which was dependent on Syria for many of its imports, with Prance and other European countries, and with Iraq and Transjordan. But inflation, combined with fixed exchange rates, has impeded a return to normal trade relations. Imports Exports Re-exports Transit The chief commodities exported before the war were cereals, vegetables, fruits, olive oil, living animals and /The- 14 - The price of Syrian wheat, for example, is now £44 a ton (or £50 a ton at the border), compared with £33 a ton el'“‘'where. Should Syria embark upon any extensive programmes of public works the effect in the short period might be to continue the inflationary trend of the war years. Money paid in wages would not be offset by an increased flow of commodities and prices would rise still further. Much would depend on the manner in which such schemes were financed and, insofar as the major cost could be covered by taxation or internal borrowing the inflationary tendency would be diminished. ( ) Husni el Zaim lost little time in ratifying the agreement signed by his predecessor. The agreement, ratified on 26th April provides for (a) the liquidation of the blocked franc balances held on Syrian account, amounting to 10 milliards of francs. Of this total 3 milliards are set aside for the liquidation of French claims on Syria, mainly from real property (£Syrian 23»200,000) and for the purchase of certain European currencies (not including sterling or Belgian or Swiss francs) to a total equivalent to £375*000 within 2 years. Part of the sura can also be used to supplement the semi-annual releases of the blocked balances (see (b)) (b) the release of the remaining 7 milliard francs in 14 semi-annual instalments from April,1st, 1948 to A*pril 1st, 1955» Each half-year Syria will thus be entitled to obtain the release of 500 million francs. These releases are credited to Account A under a Monetary or Payments agreement. (c) A Monetary or Payments Agreement comprising two Accounts - Account A, into which the releases are paid, and account B for ordinary current transactions. If the credits from French sources to Account B are insufficient to meet the debits drawn by Syria, Syria may then utilise the balance standing in Account A (the half- yearly fran^releases).&lt;s - 10 - (d) an exchange guarantee as from January 26th 1948 against devaluation or revaluation of the franc in torrno ^ sterling, covering the franc balances still blocked# In the event of any delay on the part of the French Government in implementing the exchange guarantee, interest is payable at the rate of 1% on the amounts due. To sum up, the Syrian Government secure under the agreement (i) the direct release of assets held by the old Syro-Lebanese Joint Committee# (ii) the release of the equivalent in francs of about £ 500,000 every 6 months for 7 years. (iii) facilities for the purchase of European soft currencies to the equivalent of £375&gt;000 in the course of tv/o years. HEALTH ( ) The medical services in Syria, which is remarkably free from endemic diseases except for a little mild malaria in the rural areas, are of a low standard owing to the inadequate training at the medical schools, the shortage of doctors and lack of organisation. There is only one British medical advisor, an expert in surgery, at the Ministry of Health in Damascus, but the Health Adviser to the British Middle East Office has recommended the Syrian Faculty of Medicine to engage foreign professors. II# SURVEYS OF DEVELOPMENT POSSIBILITIES IN SYRIA ( ) In 1947 a United Stntes-Syria Agricultural Mission investigated the status of agriculture in Syria and made a number of recommendations for improvement and development. ( ) In 1948 the British firm of Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners completed a detailed Report on the Economic Development of Syria. Recommendations for further investigation of specific projects were also included in the Report. /SOOPiii- 16 - SCOPE OF THE SURVEYS ( ) Tho United States-Syria Agricultural Missions* Report stressed the need for increased cultivation and extended ^ irrigation, mentioning particularly the lands along the Euphrates and in the Jezira and the Valley of the Orontes. The Report also recommended the introduction of 'better plant varieties and animal 'breeds and the establishment of agricultural industries, and made specific recommendations concerning research, agricultural education and administrati, regulatory and control programmes. Following on this report four American technicians were engaged oy the Syrian Government only one of whom still remains* ( ) The Gibo Report covered the major natural resources of the country. It recommended the following particular projects: (a) a water supply scheme for Aleppo (estimated cost £3 million at 1947 prices) (t&gt;) the development of Latakia as a deep-water harbour (estimated cost £3 million) (c) the construction of a barrage on the Euphrates to provide for hydro-electric power and irrigation development (estimated cost £3 million) (d) the construction of a road and rail network to enable the important agricultural area in the Jezira to be opened up (e) the drainage of the Ghab Valley to reclaim 34,000 hectares of land for winter cropping, (estimated cost £3 million). ( ) The Report contains a substantial chapter evaluating the role of irrigation and drainage in the agricultural potentialities of Syria. It classifies the lands available /for/&gt;£/ - 17 - for irrigation development, from South to North, as follows: Yarmuk Basin Orontes Basin Euphrates Valley Euphrates Valley Euphrates Valley Khabur Valley Other Drainage Mzerib Project G-hab Depression Meskeneh to Ragga Deir-ez-Zor to Abou Kemal Deir-ez-Zor Mohafazat from a weir in the Halabiya Gorge Minor catchments in the Mohafazat of Latakia and the Gaza of Tigris Ghab Valley. Mzerib, Awaj and Barada wastes in S. Syria. Roudj swamp and certain marsh lands. CONCL USIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OP THE GIBB SURVEY ( ) Syria possesses the water resources necessary to irrigate almost 1,000,000 additional acres of land. These resources need to be developed in order to raise the agricultural productivity of the country, not only to feed the rapidly increasing population but also to supply the raw materials for industry and trade. ( ) Although the undeveloped resources of the country are substantial they are not unlimited and may in due course prove insufficient to meet Syria's needs. Irrigation development, therefore, must fit into the economic development of tte country as a whole and must not outstrip the ability of the agricultural population to make full use of the lands once they are available for irrigated cultivation. ( .) The Gibb Report proposes a Ten-Year expenditure of about £50 million to cover irrigation and drainage projects, hydro-electric and thermal power installations, rural and urban water supply systems, roads, railways, airports, ports, telephones and public buildings. Of this amount £ 7.5 million is estimated as the cost of a Ten-Year irrigation and draining scheme. ( ) The proposed irrigation and drainage scheme is divided into two Five-Year Projects as follows: /First FiveL - 18 - First Five Years Orontes — Homs and Hama Khabur •- Jezira Mzerib - Hauran Orontes - Ghab Valley Euphrates - Halabiya Roudj Second Five Years Orontes - Homs and Hama Euphrates - Halabiya RoudJ Completion vf Canal C Collection of data for Canals A and B Completion of Canal A Completion of present scheme. Detailed investigations and execution of drainage works. Detailed investigations of site for weir Detailed investigations of drainage. Execution of Canals A and B Execution of derivation weir Execution'of drainage scheme ( ) Projects for later consideration are listed as additional canals on the Orontes in the Homs—Hama region and on the Khaeour in the Jezira area, and the extension of the irrigation system on the Euphrates in the Halabiya area# ( ) The above recommendations, which include only the first stages of the irrigation system on the Euphrates, would permit the irrigation of some 150,000 acres and offer possibilities for the resettlement of new population# Additional implementation of the Euxohrates scheme between Meskeneh and Abou Kemal could provide as much as 750,000 acres of irrigated land but at a cost higher than that already estimated for the above schemes, a less ambitious scheme would make available about 250,000 acres of irrigated land through the installation of x^'unipirig facilities and would involve the minimum of expense in construction works# SYRIAN GOVERNMENT FIVE-YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN ( ) Until recently the Syrians had adopted an attitude of economic isolationism, refusing to seek financial assistance for development from outside sources or to employ more than one or two foreign technical experts. /had No action- 1 9 - had been taken on the Gibb Report. On March 1st last, however, the then Minister of National Economy announced that the Government were drafting an important Five-Year Programme of Development, which included the following principal projects: (a) the enlargement of Latakia port (b) the construction of a railway network in various districts of Syria, especially the productive and consumer areas, and the linking of them with Syrian jjorts. (c) the draining of swamps, especially the Ghab plain between Homs and Latakia, the drained area of which would provide about 250,000 acres of arable land (d) the construction of several electric power plants on the Euphrates to x^rovide adequate electric energy for Syrian industry. (e) the execution of several large irrigation projects for the exploitation of the largest possible area of land situated in the North between the Euphrates and the Jezira. ( ) The cost of this programme was estimated at ^Syrian 200 (£22 million) and His Majesty 1 s Minister at Damascus was informed that it was proposed to raise a foreign loan to meet part of the cost. Meanwhile, as regards the Water Supply Scheme for Aleppo, an agreement was recently signed with the Conrpagnie Francaise des Etudes Techniques of Paris for the Preparation of the detailed plans. His Majesty’s Government’s advice has been sought about the setting up of an Economic Development Board and we have furnished information on the type of organisation, based on our experience in India and the Colonies, which might be best suited to Syria’s economic needs. /INTERNATIONAL- 20 - INTERNATIONAL BANK ( ) While Syria is a mernber of the I.M.R and of the International Bank for•Reconstruction and Development she has not so far sought the assistance of the Bank* His Majesty’s Minister has accordingly suggested that discussions might he held with the International Bank officials now in the Middle East* RECOMMENDATIONS - AGRICULTURE ( ) The Agricultural Adviser to the British Middle East Office has made the following recommendations for the improvement of agricultural technique in Syria. (a) Agricultural Education needs to he expanded and improved, beginning with the schoolboy and ending with the practical farmer. Teachers will have to he trained. (h) The type of agricultural education given in the present agricultural schools of the Agricultural Department is too stereotyped and needs overhaul and improvement. A greater diversity of agricultural education is required. SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS (c) either the new agricultural School at Hosh Xharabo near Damascus or some other school ’ should he developed into a first-class agricultural college which will give a good four-year diploma course for the present and ultimately would become an Agricultural Faculty of a local University. (a) one of the schools should become the centre for training teachers. (e) another school should concontratecnthe training of tractor drivers and of mechanics in the care and maintenance of tractors. (f) the recruitment of suitably qualified staff from outside for teaching in the principal agricultural school or college will be necessary. /(g)21 (g) a number of specially selected students should be sent abroad to receive higher training in s agriculture and research. (6&gt; Syria does not at present possess suitably qualified specialists to undertake such research. They must be recruited from foreign countries. Initially, the following are essential: (a) an agronomist (b) a horticulturist (c) an agricultural chemist (d) an economic botanist (e) an entomologist. A proper organisation for the collection and preparation of agricultural statistics should be set up. Facilities should be provided and encouragement given in the development of a fruit and vegetable preservation industry both in the home and on a commercial basis. The staff of the Ministry of Agriculture engaged in extensi*.j work needs to be better trained and educated. Practical demonstrations in the cultivators’ own fields should constitute a much greater part of the work than at presoftt.( ) Syria should taka anergotic action against locusts. ( ) The growing of fruit provides very considerable possibilities for Syria. Raisins and sultanas could be grown for export. A very considerable expansion of vegetable cultivation is desirable. Serious consideration should be given to the possibility of increasing cultivation of oil bearing plants, especially the ground-nut. PROJECTS CAPABLE OF CONTRIBUTING TOWARDS THE RflSETTLaMaNT OF PALESTINE ARAB REFUGEES. 4 ( ) The Mzerib Project in the Hauran (although the area is malarial) and the Orontes and Roudj Projects provide an outlet for a limited number of refugees. Implementation of the Euphrates Project c^uld provide for a substantial portion of the refugee population. One feature of the Euphrates Project is the suggestion in the Gibb Report that costly irrigation works would be limited and that considerable areas can be irrigated by oil-powered pumps. A partial scheme for providing about 250,000 acres of irrigated land by pumping is thought to be feasible at the cost of a fairly moderate capital investment. As stated above, however, considerable- 23 - considerable work requires to be done on the cadastral survey of the country. ^ ) Basic programmes for the development of the land and water resources of Syria have been worked out. However, a good deal of investigation and survey work will still be required. ( ) There is some possibility for extended cultivation in the areas of the rain-fed lands, and for the increase of cropping by the expansion of irrigation principally along the Euphrates and the Khabour. ( ) The resettlement of any considerable number of Palestine Arab refugees in Syria will have to take into account Syria's own requirements for its existing population. The available information is insufficient to determine the financial and technical requirements for existing schemes of development but it is clear that substantial assistance will be needed. Major portions of the Euphrates irrigation project might, however, be self-liquidating if communications with the West were improved. ( ) The Jezira region of North-Eastern Syria offers a unique opportunity for settlement and development. Here is an extensive plain in a temperate zone, with a rich soil, in the Northern portion of which rainfall is abundant, and in the Southern portion water is available for irrigation. It is traversed by two rivers, the Khabour and its tributaries and the Balikh. ’ Some irrigation of the Khabour is already under way. The fertile region is sparsely cultivated. It has a cultivable potential of some 3 million acres. The climate being mild, refugees could be established in tents or shacks, and put immediately to work building permanent adobe homes, constructing roads, expanding irrigation works and beginning the planting of some crops. Before this could be done however the question of ownership of the land or possession of- 24 - of grazing and cultivation rights would have to be settled Another opportunity in Syria is offered by the Ghab ^ ‘ « * . • • • • Valley of the Orontes river, in the North-West part of the country (although it must be borne in mind that any development schemes there would probably attract the crowied population of the AlaoQtta Mountain area). The course of the river lies in the middle of the valley, which is surrounded by hills. For several months each year the valley is flooded and is a breeding-place for malarial mosquitoes. The soil is rioh alluvial, but people of neighbouring villages are able to make only scanty use of it. The area involved is estimated at some i 100,000 acres. ( ) This is practically waste land and the Syrian authorities might the more easily therefore bo persuaded to make it available for refugee resettlement, A resettlement scheme would require the construction of a small diversion dam at the upper end of the valley and an irrigation canal along each side. [ During the rainy season the two canals would serve as additional water courses and thus prevent flooding in the valley; and during the dry season they would serve for gravity irrigation. ( ) It is thought that there are several other places in Syria where small refugee groups could be settled, along the course of the Orontes in the Homs-Hama area in the Aleppo area in the North and in the Houran in the South. ! ( ) The following is a rough estimate of the costs of the principal projects referred to in the paper: ir l I (a) Development of the rain-fed area of the Jezira 51,500,000 (b) Irrigation works on the Khabour River £5&gt;000,000 | (c) Euphrates Irrigation Works and Hydro-electric scheme £3&gt;000,000 (d) Other small irrigation works £2,000,000 (a)- 25 - (e) Ghab Valley drainage £3,000,000 (f) Roads £3,000,000 (g) Latakia Port £3,000,000 (h) Aleppo Water Supply £3,000,000 (i) Mezze Airport £3.000.000 Total £26.000,000 Up to 40^ of this total might be required in foreign exchange (i.e. £ 10 , 600 , 000 )• It is impossible to give even a rough estimate of the cost of the railway development recommended by Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners, but the cost would probably range from £80,000,000 to £177,400,000 of which up to 70$ (i.e. from £56,000,000 to £124*180,000) would be required in foreign exchange.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000691.0x0001de_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/4759</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000691.0x0001de</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/4759</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 54/3 'Middle East (Official) Committee Working Party.
