Mr. Ouyang King had been associated with Mr. Mackenzie King in the settlement of the Chinese claims aris ing out of the riots at Vancouver in 1908 and was considered to be an eminently suitable person for representing Chinese interests at that place.

Your Excellency:- With reference to niy letter of the 1st and yours of the 9th of October last, I have the honour to state that the Chinese Government now propose to ap point Mr. Ou-Yang Keng as Consul for China at Rangoon. Mr. Ou-Yang Keng was educated in the United States and has been in His Imperial Majesty*s consu lar service for a considerable number of years at New York and San Francisco. In 1907, he was deputed by the Imperial Government to assist the Commission appointed by the Canadian Government to make investi gations into the Chinese claims arising oui of the Vancouver Riots v/hich broke out in September of that year. He is also a native of Canton, the inhabitants of v/hich Province now form the larger number of the Chinese Sir Edward Grey, Bart., M.P.,* Chinese resident in Rangoon I shall feel obliged if Your Excellency will be so good as to inform me if the proposed appointment would meet with the approval of His Majesty’s Govern ment . I have &amp;c., (Signed) Li Ching-fong.(Copy) Ho. 34, dated the 3Cth April 19C8. Fron - H. A. Ottewill, Esquire, Acting British Consul, Tengyueh, V? To - The Hon*hie Mr. W. F. Eice, Ch ie ^ Secretary to the Governnent of Burma. As you are aware, Yang Chen hung, a would-be revolution ary, put up an anti-foreign placard at Tengyueh about a year ago, and in the month of August went to Japan yj.a Burma. He has written an article about Chanta affairs in the December number of the Yunnan Journal, the organ of his confederates, which is published in Tokio. He accuses every body in Tengyueh of having been bribed, but omits to mention money taken by himself or a promise vii ich he exacted from the Ching Shih party to pay him four thousand taels vhen Hung Sheng comes to his own a^in. Another article under tire non de plume of ”Chu shih M points out what a fine man Yang is, and how he browbeat some British officer at Rangoon and escaped. The style of another article printed under the A !■ nom de plume of ” I lu' T makes me think it is written by Yang himself. After a long discourse it advocates the establish ment of a ”shang hui M at Rangoon. The translation of thewords is 'merchants' guild', 'trade association', 'chamber of commerce' or some such term. The objects of the society as detailed in the article are (1) to insist on the altera tion of harsh laws against the Chinese, and if insistence fails, for all Chinese in Burma to unite in opposing the laws; (2) to obtain command of the trade of Burma now in Briti^i hands; to establish a steam-ship ccnpany; to be in a position to take action against British merchants in order to 'regain sovereign rights', whatever that phrase may mean; (3) to obtain the establishment of a Chinese Consulate at Rangoon, the writer remarking parenthetically that little as he likes the Government of China they have to be appealed to in affairs with foreign countries; to be in direct corre spondence with the Chinese Board of Trade; to superintend local officials; and (4) to act secretly; to arrange disputes amongst members and to prevent failures amongst them. The clause as to sup er in tending local officials means that the society will select its own officers to look after Chinese in Burma and prevent the latter from having any relations with British officials. Yang Feng nien and Chen Shih jui, Rangoon merchants, m 'mmx am infoimad tliat tli6 Taotai has already suggested to the Yunnan Governor Genei^al the opening of a Consulate at Rangoon. It is worth noting that the tendency of Chinese societies is to hide political motives under specious names. The writer does not hide tlie fact that political motives are to animate the society and ends his article by stating that it will make the Chinese in Burma independent of the control of British officials, that it will increase the power of China and in course of time bring Burma again under the rule of the Chinese. It is a curious and persistent lie which the Chinese propagate that Burma belonged to then and that by taking it the British took Chinese territory..' 0 ' .. ti' *•.:•' . . ..lit'V • J i v • | t.*«l opy t \ v-'vf'y’’;- ' V *.,i ■ # r\ r^’t-n ■ i # rL*rJtn*fr ^ -■ v«il» P ' 'D7o^ ; x&gt;r ) i '' i \) l j' • 1 i iitJ mtermc’S to ay note uf tjy&gt; Sth uit.v o.

Sir Edward Grey, Bart., M.P., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.V -X *28 FOREIGN SECRET TELEGRAMS. Secret Department. From Viceroy, 23rd May 1908. Following views Foreign Secret. Chinese Consul at Mandalay. Lieutenant-Governor of Burma :— “ The Chinese Minister has been misinformed of Chinese in Mandalay. At the last census Chinese population of Mandalay town and district was 1,576. The total Chinese population of the province was under 70,000. The Chinese population of the city of Rangoon was 11,018. The Lieutenant- Governor is not aware of any ground for the suggestion that Mandalay now surpasses Rangoon as centre of Chinese trade, and he is satisfied that it is not the case. The Chinese population of Mandalay and places to the north consists principally of Yunnanese, who are loyal and well-behaved and neither give trouble nor require protection. There is no possible legitimate need of a Chinese Consul at Mandalay, or of official visit of a Chinese Consul to that place. In the Lieutenant-Governor’s opinion, the only reason for proposal to place a Chinese Consul at Mandalay is to foment intrigues, probably against railway project, and to undermine cordial relations at present existing between people, as distinguished from officials, of Yunnan and ourselves. Official visit of a Chinese Consul to Mandalay would have same design and an equally bad effect. From a political point of view it is specially undesirable that anything should be done to revive interest in the claim formerly put forward by China to suzerainty over Upper Burma. As it would be obvious to everyone in Mandalay that for trade purposes the presence of a Consul there is not necessary, his visit would certainly be regarded as having political significance. The agreement in the Conventions of 1894 and 1897 is that China may appoint a Consul at Rangoon and that, as the commerce between Burma and China increases, additional Consuls may be appointed as the requirements of trade may seem to demand. A peripatetic Consul is not contemplated. His Honour advises that this position should be maintained, and that, until the development of trade requires a Consul elsewhere, the Consul appointed should remain at Rangoon. For these reasons he urges as strongly as possible that the proposed compromise should not be put forward or accepted. He convinced that its adoption would tend to accentuate difficulties of our position in Yunnan, and would be of no benefit to Chinese trade in Man dalay.” We concur with Lieutenant-Governor. || 3My dear Ritchie The views expressed in the India Office let ter of March 9th. on the Chinese proposal to station a Consul at Mandalay instead of at Rangoon were duly com municated to the Chinese Minister, who has now returned to the charge with the Memorandum of which a copy is enclosed. There seems to he a certain amount of force in the Chinese contention that changes in the movement of trade have brought about the conditions contemplated in Article XIII of the original Convention of 1394. If it is a fact that Mandalay now surpasses Rangoon in importanceimportance as a centre of Chinese trade and residence, could not some arrangement perhaps he made hy which the Consul, though having his headquarters at Rangoon,might, when circumstances require it, reside from time to time at Mandalay? The Government of India did not like Jordan's idea of making acceptance of the Chinese proposal conditional on the formal recognition of MacArtney at Kashgar; hut if you are prepared to reconsider the Chinese request, you might perhaps also wish to secure this or some other 'quid pro quo'.^ORAITDUM CHINESE AJH) BRITISH CONSULS IH BUKMAH AHB YUHHA1T. 0 Oo On the 1st of H^rch 1394 a Convention between China and Great Britain w^s signed in London Article XIII. of -which provides as follows 'It is agreed that His ’•'Taj esty the Emperor 'of China m^y appoint a Consul in Burmah, to 'reside at Rangoon, and that Her Britannic 'Majesty may appoint a Consul to reside at 'Manwyn e 'Further that, in proportion as the Commerce 'betv/een Burmah and China increases, additional 'Consuls may be appointed by mutual agreement 'to reside at such places as the requirements 'of the trade may seem to demand'. On tine 4th of February 1397 a further Agreement between the same two High Contracting Parties was signed at Peking by which modifications were made in cert iin of the Articles of the Convention of March 1394, -amongst others in Article XIII., which was modified in the manner shown in the following clause:- 'It is now agreed that the Government of Great Britain’’Britain may station a Consul at ITomein or ”Shunning-fu, as the Government of Great Britain 'may prefer, instead of at Manwyne, as stipulated ”in the original Convention, and also to 'station a Consul at Ssumao'. fhe above.modification was given effect to by the Bri tish Government ana a Consul stationed at Bornein (Teng- \uo/i) instead of at hanwyne, to which arrmgerient the Ghi— nese Government willingly assented. The Chinese Government on their side have not till now taken the step provided for of appointing a Consul ao Rangoon. meanwhile since the date of the Convention and Agreement trade 4,nd business with Chinese seems to hive greatly developed in the northern part of Burmah. The Viceroy of Yunnan telegraphs that there are at present fro seventy to eighty thousand Chinese in Ava (Mandalay) and its neighbourhood, and the conditions now obtaining there seem to be the conditions contemplated in the origi nal Convention as justifying and requiring the appointment of a Consul to that place. The number of Chinese at Rangoon appear to be less than .%t Ava, ind it is not now proposed to appoint a Con sul at the former place. The Consul to be stationed at .va, if his ippo.intment be agreed to, will be able to at tend to business at Rangoon much more conveniently than he could attend to Ava if stationed at Rangoon. under 11 il ; vUnder instructions from his Government the Chinese Minister would therefore uguin approach the foreign Office on. the subject and express the hope that the Gecretarv of ^tate may he Able to move the Indian Government, in view of the fuller statement of the question set out above, to re-consider their opinion and see their way to accede to the wishes of the Chinese Government. The Minister would only remark further that it does not seem to be a general rule that Consuls shall only be stationed at sea-ports. Of the British Consulates in China more than half are at i-’ld-ces in the interior, - many indeed at places to which there is no access by water. CHINESE LEGATION, March 31st, 1^08.7 ~ j¥ ;opy. ;o .3243, [mediate. The request of the Chinese Government (eonmuni- fiS *&gt; cated by the Chinese legation on January 28th last) that a Chinese Consul should be appointed to Ava (Mandalay) Instead of to Rangoon was, co the Chinese Minister is aware, referred to the Government of India. His Majesty’s Government, having received and carefully considered the reply of that Government, regret that they are unable to accept the proposed arrangement. His Majesty's/Government consider it Important to maintain the principle which was guarded by the terns of Article XIII of the Burma Convention of 18971897, - that OoxibuIs In India ohould reside only at the sea-porte, - and they are therefore reluctantly obliged to state that they are unable to fall in with the wishes of the Chinese Government in this matter.
