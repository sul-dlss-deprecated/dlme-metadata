He describes his father, a prominent academic, and outlines his own early education and life as a graduate student in London, and early career as an economist in Kuwait. He mentions early teaching stints at AUC starting in 1967, contrasting the social class of students then with those in later years, and tells how he came permanently to AUC later in the 1970s. Amin briefly outlines changes in the Economics department over the years, and offers some commentary on AUC students (specifically changes in academic quality over time). He also speaks about the universityâ€™s relationship with Egyptian politics and government, including an anecdote about an AUC committee he served on after the 1973 war. His research interests and writings are also covered.  </dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
