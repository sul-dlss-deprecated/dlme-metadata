The Dhui’ar Province, situated in the western ex trend ty of the Sultan of Muscat’s Southern Arabian territories, is enclosed by the Indian Ocean on its southern side ana by Jibal Qara, a semi-circular formation of mountains running into the sea at Has lianar and hurbat, v/hioh shut it off from the mountains and deserts to the North, Hast and West. South-west monsoon clouds driving up from the Indian Ocean are here met by winds from the North and East and buffeted and depressed until they are entrapped by the mountains over the Dhufar plain. Dhufar is thus unique on the Southern Arabian coast in that it enjoys monsoon rainfall for some tnree months of the year. The Province contains three distinct physical tracts a cultivated coastal belt, Alhafa, divided from the mountains by a desert plain some 40 miles in length and up to 9 riles in depth* The mountains enclosing the western end of the plain are precipitous and inaccessible while these to the Zt st rise steeply with many sheer cliffs and deep gorges but are capped by rolling grassy uplands and interspersed with wide park-like valleys well wooded with wild fig, tamarind, acacia, sycamore and extensive groves of *mishat n aid n metan n , unidentified local ~rees the latter of close grained black wood too heavy to float in water. Varieties of evergreen, privet, babul, wild olive, jasmine, camel thorn, tamarisk and an abundance of wild flowers and grasses provide ample grazing during the summer for herds of milch cattle, camels and goats numbering many hundreds. For shade there is a remarkable evergreen known locally as 'lathac' of which the spreaoing branches reseed themselves oo grow smaller trees round the main trunx giving a vaulted effect. A 'lathab* founa in tedi Darbat provided shade for an entire camp sufficient for a s:a8ll cent, guards, camels and visiting btdouin, thirty persons in all, to be accommodated separately. The uplends rise gently to a height of between 3000 and/ some2 and 4000 i'eot at che top or i-oe waueraiiad and tnence slope away ^i'roni kr* »/0 ttt6 i\Oxtn draining into .vadi Mugsnin* on the southern edge of Bertram Thomas * the Hub 1 el Khali. Flying over the monsoon clouds it can be seen map in ’Arabia tha&amp; the cloud formations are entrapped over the enclosed plain Felix*. Mr,Thomas* and on the southern slooes of the mountains, the reverse slopes spelling of place draining to the North being practically free of cloud and devoid names has been fol- oi moisiure. It is in these wadis that the frankincense, for lowed thr oughout which the mountains have been famous through the ages, grows wild, this note. The dryness of the air determines the quality of the frankincense, the resin of similar trees growing on the southern slopes being spoilt by the rain. Although tbe southern slopes enjoy a good rainfall the ground soli does rot retain the water. Underground rivers rv drain the waters of «•bal Aram into wadi Oaroat the mouth oi which is sealed by a nheer limestone cliff 500 feet high. Tne accumulated waters fill a la^ce tv/o miles long, situated at a height of 1000 feet, end overflow curing the rains to form a picturesque waterfall. Other underground rivers feed perennial springs at the foot of the hills. There are six of these springs; Jerzeez, the best or them, producing an estimated flow of 40,000 gallons of water an hour. ‘These waters, if unharnessed, again disappear underground, in the foothills and reappear to feed extensive fresh water creeks in the coastal belt uiviued from the sea only by narrow sand bars. Fresh water is easily obtainable from shallow v ells at a distance of a hundred yards from high water marx and up to a distance oi one mile inland, beyond which the increased depth of the water discourages prospective cultivators. CLIMATE. Shade temperatures are moderate rarely exceeding 96° Fahrenheit and seldom falling below 60°. Monsoon clouds Keep the summer cool if sticky while the winter months are warn except for periods when cold v.-inds from the northern deserts cause heavy and prolonged dust storms and a sharp fall in temperature. The people of the Province are as varied as the landscape,/ PEOPLE.l/£&gt; av © *Sir Arth ur Keith and Dr. Wilton Marion Krogman noting in Appendix I of Mr. Bertram Thomas 1 'Arabia Felix'. - 3 - landscape, the Southern Arabians of the hills being distinct types considered by some* to be Hamitio in origin. They are a small limbed, dark skinned race with well chiselled features, still in a nomadic aid troglodytic state. Living in their sylvan hills they have left no mark on them. Only those who occasionally visit the few towns speak any Arabic and they observe the forms of Islam only during their brief visits. In their own hills they do not pray on the flimsy plea that there is no water for ablutions, do Islam they prefer pre-islamic riues to propitiate the jinn, of whom tiey go in perpetual dread; rites which their more orthodox Moslem rulers have so far been unable to eradicate. A bedouin of the 'Bait Katan' section averred to me that travelling at night he was once dogged by an old hag who, when rs threatened with a sword, retired growing larger and larger until she v/as transformed into a treo. Another said he had heard jinns in the running streams at dusk while a youth who was produced before me, alleged to be possessed of a jinn, appeared from his father’s descriptions of his actions to be a somnambulist. The bedouin have no irrigated cultivation and they do not labour. Such cultivation as they have is quite unsettled, a suitable paoch being broken up before the rains if the whim takes them or necessity forces them. They live as parasites on the camel, the cow and the goat and barter incense for grain because collecting the former is easier than cultivating tue latter and well fits in with their migrations in search of grazing. The town of Salala contains a community of settled hillmen of the KaGhiri tribe; a long established community of ^aiyias hailing from the Yemen, mostly engaged in trade; a few artisans; some former slaves of East African origin and fishermen. The Hindoo festival of 'Diwaii', until prohibited by the present ruler’s father, v/as regularly celebrated by many professing Moslems of Saiala. It is said to have been introduced by a Brahmin who was shipwrecked on the Jhufar coast ano. remained wo initiate alien rites which found a ready acceptance among the lower classes who had been but imperfectly assimilated by Islam./4 i;* Islam. 5:00^0KY AIiD FINANCIH. Frankincense growing wild, the milch cattle on the hill grazings and the riches of the ?ea provide the clue to the economics of Dhufar. Vast shoals of sardines frequent these waters during the winter pursued by tunny and other species, in their turn preyed upon by sharks, and provide a catch of up to ten thousand bags of sardines round the town of Salala alone and smaller catches along the coast. These are dried the sun and form the staple diet of all draught and milch animals and even of the bedouin f amselves in times of scarcity. It is not now an uncommon sight to see bedouin women and children carrying dried sardines from the beaches on their pack animals sharing the letter’s diet of uncooked sardine. The tunny provide one of the main items of the Dhufar townsman’s diet. The sardines are caught by professional fishermen using a sype of surf boat of which the teak planks are sewn together with coir rope to give added flexibility to resist the buffeting of the surf. They are sold to the merchants in return for grain, cloth and other necessities. The merchants pass them on to the bedouin as forage for their herds during the dry months of the year. Vithout them the lactations of the milch animals dry up. Last year the sordine catch was very poor and groin was almost unobtainable so that distress among the bedouin was widespread. Bedouin met with in .February of this year said they hai had no solid food for two months and less than their usual supplies of milk. They were certainly very emaciated. This distress was the main reason why so many labourers were available for work on the aerodromes and also one of the reasons why the labour was so poor. In normal years the bedouin do not labour. Seles of sardines were until recently made in terms of Maria Theresa silver thalers, but cash seldom passed henas because it w?.s not available in sufficient quantities. Payment in cash earned a reduction in price of up to 150^. Settlement was usually made in terms of the milk of one cow for one mouth to be collected in the following summer. Gash transo.ctions have/have this year, however, become general because the large sums of money brought into the country to pay for labour wording on the aerodromes and the curtailment of imports have made cash more plentiful than goods. Merchants of the town v:ho advance sardines in the autumn remove with their families to the hills in the summer, when grazing is plentiful, and encamp with the bedouin to supervise the collection of their milk and its manufacture into ghi for export. They also purchase the year’s accumulations of hides for the same purpose. They ta^e with them quantities of Indian millet and indigo-dyed cloth sheets to advance against the frankincense which the tribesmen collect from the dry wadis on the northern slopes of the hills. The ghi, hides and incense go to India and grain and cloth for the bedouin, and tea, coffee, sugar, rice and luxuries foi* the townsmen, are purchased with the foreign exchange thus secured. AGRICULTURE. The coastal belt contains valuable groves of cocoa- nuts, a few date gardens, and open fields closely cultivated by the servants of the well-to-do shaikhs and merchants of the town. Sugar-cane, cotton and indigo were until recently the most valuable field crops grown but indigo has now given way to such food crops as maize, millet and sweet potatoes. The hills and desert plain, on the other hand, although their cultivation is comparatively simple, have in recent years been entirely neglected. Collecting incense and bartering it for rrain was preferred by the bedouin; and, in return for their exports, the merchants could in peace time obtain ample quantities of rice and other food from India. The little capital available could be more profitably employed in this trade than in building irrigation works. Now that these supplies have dried up efforts are being made to re-establish cultivation. Old water courses have been repaired and new ones constructed to bring the water of the Jerzeez and other springs/BHHHMMflri /v springs to tiie plain, ana wheat has been grown for the first. are time in living memory. Water and good fallow land/now available but an adequate supply of skilled labour and trained draught animals has so far proved impossible to secure. ADI II-qsrH HON. The administration of the Dhufar Province is in the hands of Dhe Sultan of Muscat himself. He appears to regard Dhufar more as a private estate than as a Province of his Sultanate and maintains a separate treasury. According to an article published some 65 years ago in the Nehla, a superior Arabic magazine of the last century, Saiyid TurMi, the present Sultan’s grandfather, established his rule there at the invitation of the Saiyids of Salala to forestall the unwelcome interest of the Turks. He entrusted the task of establishing Muscat authority to one Sulaiman bin Suwailim, a former slave, and supplied him with a small body of soldiers to secure the towns from the tribesmen. Sulafman bin Suwailim built a fort on the site of the present palace which was later seized and looted by the Kathiri, but it was not long before Muscat authority was re-established. His father took little interest in the Province but Saiyid Said bin Taimur, the present Sultan, has now been in residence there for over a year, has a trained agricultural adviser and an engineer with him and is making great strides in developing the agricultural resources. His Government is based on overwhelming local superiority of force in the form of some two hundred partially trained soldiers, the offspring of former Hast African slaves, armed with modern rifles and made mobile with ponies and two light trucks. Neither the tribesmen nor the townsfolk are well armed and the former are too divided to be formidable. The Sultan’s Government is buttressed by the possession of possibly three fifths of the currency in the Province, over the expenditure of which the strictest control is maintained, oy a comprehensive intelligence system and by control of much of the imported food. This strength is tempered by political Bxarriageswith the tribes and by wise and sympathetic Government. 3ueh practical measures have assured him of the universal fear and respect of his people and of a state of unusual peace and security. That the Sultan does not intend to have his palace looted a -ain is, however, apparent from his heavy expenditure on arms and defensive fortifications around the town of Salala. Saiyid Said tin Taimur derives his income from customs duties, an annual levy on all local produce, payable in kind, together with a tax on gold ornaments. He also claims ownership of all land not proved to be in the possession of another and is letting the land now irrigable from the new Jerzeez water channel at rates of up to 25% of the produce, payable in kind. In addition he enjoys the produce of his gardens, is himself the largest and only progressive agriculturist in the province, imports goods for sale in the State shop and owns and runs the largest dhow plying from l;urbat, the port of the Province. He is also the sole source of all local supplies and services required for the construction and Biain&amp;enance of tie air-port, : ^ith these funds he maintains order in the Province, has constituted regular courts, established a school and a dispensary and has built roads. He also supplies the initiative, technical skill and capital for large scale irrigation and agricultural improvement. AIRPOIT, An airport has recently been developed from a former Royal Air Force ei.ergency landing ground to become one of the links in the Aden - Karachi chain. It was first developed by the British Overseas Airways Corporation who have a station there. The Royal Air Force moved in later and were soon followed by a Air detachment of the United States Army/Corps under the auspices of the Royal Air Force. There is a good airfield suitable for the largest aircraft, ancillary buildings and accommodation for the permanent staff and for 100 sen in transit. It is being used operationally by .ir Headquarters, Aden, for the protection of convoys, by the Royal Air Force Ferry Command for reinforcementsA to India, by the Air Transport Command of the United States Army -ir Forces for the transport of personnel and freight to India as well as by ea.stbound American reinforcement aircraft. The monsoon clouds maKe landing difficult from July to September, but aircraft continued to use the field without mishap throughout last summer with no blind landing equipment. Such equipment is, however, now being installed and it is hoped that aircraft will have no difficulty in using the field all the year round. SECURITY. The Sultan has himself undertaken responsibility for the safety of Allied personnel from local molestation and has supplied police guards for the purpose. Allied personnel are required to observe strict rules of behaviour designed to prevent incidents with the local people which have, during the last year, been remarkably few. A company of Indian troops has been posted for the protection of the aerodrome against external attack. OF SC1NTIFIC INTTREAT. The area contains much of interest to the scientist. The Anthropology, Natural History, Botany and Music of Dhufar have been noted on in the appendices to Mr. Bertram Thomas’ book 'Arabia Felix'. Mr. Thomas had also written on the Philology of Dhufar but the area still presents, I believe, a virgin field for the palaeontologist, and there are some very fine caves to interest the speleologist. For the archaeologist there are the ruins of impressive stone fortifications and spacious villas at Balid and Robat. Those at Balid are moated and contain aju easily distinguished basillica. SPORT. The sea off Dhufar offers unrivalled sea fishing during the v/inter months and excellent duck shooting is to be had on the numerous fresh water creeks along the coast. Ku ait, B3rd June, 1943 Srd.

H? dear Hay Would you please refer to your d.d. letter No.l93-S of 1st February about the definition of M Mahra country” and the boundary between the Sultan of Jfiuscat’.s territory and the Aden Protectorate. 2. In India Office letter No.P.Z.3643/33 of 29th June, 1933, to the Governmentof India (a copy of which was sent to Bushire) it was stated that H.M.G. agreed that the claim of the Sultan of Muscat that Ras Dharbat Ali is the boundary of his territory might be ad mitted and that the Sultan might be informed accordingly. Apart from this there seems to have been no precise definition of the boundary, and it appears from correspondence here with the Colonial Office in 1935 that there was doubt even as to which side of the headland of Ras Dharbat should be regarded as forming the boundary. According to a report made by W.H. Ingrams in 1935 (papers forwarded to Bushire under P.Z.4374/35 of 12th July, 1935) local opinion held that the frontier runs on the west side of the Ras - apparently the headland once belonged to Qishra but was bombarded and captured by the Sultan of Muscat some time past, and rt made some mark upon it”. The Frontier is also shown as being on the west side of Ras Dharbat Ali in a Survey of India map of southeast Arabia 1:2,000,000, but on what authority this was done is not known. According to Ingrams, from Ras Dharbat Ali the boundary is said to run as follows: From Ras Dharbat Ali to Arhqiyut From Arhqiyut to A1 Halta From A1 Halta to Wadi A1 Hana From Wadi A1 Hana to Fiza From Fiza to ’Aful From »Aful to Maghsil From Maghsil to Fadkhut 1 hour ' 3 hours 1 hour 2 hours 2 hours 1 hour 1 hour. 3. I am afraid that this does not assist very much in solving the question of responsibility for the security of oil exploration parties in the neighbourhood of the frontier, but it is possible +&gt;&gt;«+ Reilly (who is now working at the Colonial Office, and whom I am may be able to shed some more light on the subject. / * 4- I enclose a spare copy of this letter for Stewart.
