(E 461/461/91J British Embasay, Bagdad* (72/2/33). 11th January, 1935. . «?'* f My dear Rendel, $ Please refer to your letter E 6535/6054/91 of the 29th December on the subject of possible visits by King Feisal to the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. I agree that, in principle, such visits should be firmly discouraged unless there is some very special reason for making an exception. In the case of the Trucial Shaikhdoms, it should not be difficult for me to dissuade King Faisal from carrying out any intention lie might have of paying them a visit. The case of Kuwait seems to me to be on a different footing and, though I am personally against the establishment of any close] i connection between Kuwait and 'Iraq than exists at present, it wil obviously be much more difficult to convince King Faisal of the justice of our claim that Kuwait is out of bounds for him. You will remember that the Shaikh of Kuwait paid King Faisal a visit in Bagdad last summer, while I was absent in Europe, and it might be claimed by Faisal that it would be discourteous on his part not to return the visit. Then there is the interminable question of the date gardens, and the prevention of smuggling from Kuwait into 'Iraq which has lately assumed rather serious proportions. The Director of Customs recently told me that he estimated that more than £ 60,000 wotth of goods had been smuggled into 'Iraq from Kuwait during the past year, and that a member of his staff had been shot dead in an affray with Kuwaiti smugglers* RENDEL, ESQ., C.M.G.' ■ forIt is true that both these matters are not proper subjects for King Faisal to tackle personally, but it might not be easy to put him off a visit to Kuwait for the ostensible purpose of arranging a settlement of such outstanding questions, though the real object of the visit would undoubtedly be political. While, therefore, I should like to be instructed to use my influence to prevent the King paying a return visit to Kuwait, I assume that every endeavour will be made at the other end to prevent the Shaikh himself encouraging the idea should the question arise, Yours, etc,, (Sgd.)

In connection with the latter I would refer a I you to the last enclosure naciely D»0.3461/461/91 , dated ' 7E/2/33 Baghdad the 11th Januaiy 1933 from Sir Francis Eumphreys to G.W.Rendel, Ssc^o ,C.M.G., of the Foreign Office. 3. In the last five lines on page 1 of this let ter Sir Francis Humphreys writes as follows:- rt The Director of Customs recently told me that he estimated that more than £60,000 worth of goods had been snuggled into IRAQ, from Kuwait during the past year and that a member of his Staff had been shot dead in an affray with Kuwaiti smugglers' 1 . 4. With the very greatest diffidence and with all respect I venture to suggest that the Director of Customs is under a misapprehension both as regards (a) the value of goods snuggled from Kuwait into IRAQ; and (b) as regarding the story that a member of his staff had been shot dead in an affray with Kuwaiti smugglers, and I think I shauld be lacking in my duty were I not to endeavour to correct 4he statement. 5. As regards (a) above: I have throughout 1932 and in the three previous years that I have been in Kuwait, taken a special interest in this question of alleged * snuggling* into IRAQ, and have over and overover again visited the Kuwait-IRAQ frontier along its whole western and northern length and especially in the vicinity of Safwan and Jabal 3anam» I have fur ther discussed the matter, on many^occasi ons, with dozens of Shaikhs and tribesmen, both IRA^J and Kuwaiti and all evidence that I have been able to gather has g^pe to show that very little smuggling indeed gDes on the land side. Indeed that which does go on is confined almost entirely to the IRAQ Muntafik shepherd tribes who annually move into Kuwait territory for 5 months during the Winter and Spring, Even this cannot be clas sed as smuggling proper seeing that all it amounts to is the conveying back with them,to their homes in IRAQ, by each shepherd family, of small quantities of sugar, coxi.ee ana tea - their needs for the return journey, with a little over for home consumption. That this does nox. amount to much roay be guaged by the fact that uhese shepherds are poor and each family has transport barely sufficient to carry its one tent and camp equip age. They have little spare space for contraband. As I have reported on different occasions duringjthe past year, a small amount of contraband traf fic does, undoubtedly, find its way a^d to the many vil lages and hamlets on the IRAQ bank of the Shatt al Arab near its mouth; but from evidence that I have been able to collect it would appear that this traffic is carried on mostly by IRAQ nationals who visit Kuwait in small sailing vessels, make their purchases, and return home aga in. It is, I think, exaggerating the matter a very great deal when the Director of Customs says that apods to the value of £60,000 found their way into IRAQ from Kuwait during 1932. If he were to visit me in Kuwait occasionally,- 3 - occasionally, i tiiiiik, I could prov© to him by ccmparing the very high prices that rule in Nejd &amp; Qassim with those of IRAq, that there is little or no financial inducement for contraband runners to work their traffic across the ' ' l&amp;tv j, IRAQ, border - the big advantage always has, and does, lie A in running goods to the South. Lastly it may interest His Excellency the Ambassador to know that the total value ofimports into Kuwait from all sources in 19 31-32 was only £225,918/-, The figures for 1932 are not available as yet, but as the trade year was the worst that Kuwait has ever yet experienced, it is safe to say that the total imports will not exceed £180,000/- during the current year. It is not, I submit, reasonable to suggest that a third of Kuwait's total import trade is run across the IRAQ, Fron tier in the form of contraband, especially when Kuwait herself has a population of 70,000 souls to provide for. As regards (b); I am afraid, much as I appre ciate -tfie undesirability of doing so, that I must take exception to the misleading statement of the Director of Customs as given uo nis .excellency the Ambassador regard— ing the shooting of one of his staff# This again I do with the utmost diffidence^ The incident mentioned is not only quite well known in Kuwait but as soon as I heard about it I started immediate enquiries (secret and otherwise) with a view to getting at the facts. I was guided in this by the fact that the Times of Mesopotamia in one of its issuer accused Kuwaitis of being the culprits. I myself also visited Zubair unofficially and enquired from the Customs and excise authorities as to their vei si en Ox wile usiness. The net results of my investiga tions showed that the smugglers were men of the Bani Hacbaim tribe resident near Samawa, 250 miles from Kuwait,/ b 4 down to Kuwait and were taking back several camel loads of contraband matter to Samawa when they were rounded up in IR a Q territory nearly 80 miles inside the frontier and in the fight that ensued a member of the Customs &amp; Excise staff was killed. To suggest that Kuwaitis were the blockade runners and that a Kuwaiti shot the preven tive officer is very far from the truth. -o ,.hile X trust 1 may be pardoned for passing the above remarks - which indeed 1 make with all res pect - I feel that the above words of explanation are due in justice to Kuwait, as it is generalities which so often give wrong impression^. And I do not wish persons in London to be prejudiced against the Shaikh of Kuwait. 1 have the honour to be , Sir, Your most obedient servant Lt.-Colonel Political Agent , Kuwait VSS.lo-w ii/ • /7 &gt;•7 t J , jV I \ Ho.

The measures which the 'Iraqi Government suggest that the Shaikh should take are as follows: (l) (aj j.o goods should be allowed to be shipped from Kuwait to 'Iraq before obtaining a permit for each shipment. This permit. together with the shipping documents (manifests) should be authenticated by an 'Iraqi customs official in Kuwait who should send copies of the permit and the shipping document to the Customs Co He c to rate, .Basrah, informing them of the quantity of the goods shipped from jiuwaiuo 'Iraq, so that they may require the importers to produce this quantity.

(2) (a) That a small steam boat should be placed at the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab to watch the movements of boats. (b) That adequate control should be introduced on land. I have the honour to request that these proposals may be laid before the Shaikh of Kuwait and that he may be invited to state if he is willing to co-operate with the 'Iraqi Government in the manner proposed.

From , 5 i l i Firing on a Kuwa it Dhow by the Fao Customs Launch &gt; Sir, I have the honour to forward translation of a letter No»R # E/94r2, dated the 1st May 19&lt;55, together with enclosure, which I have received from His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwaiti 2 # The letter and enclosure speak for themselves* The incident happened on the 23rd of April and the delay in submitting this report has been entirely due to the Shaikh*s laudable desire to make no hasty move, or ask for representations to be made, until after he had sifted all the evidence at his disposal* 4o It is with the greatest regret that I now report this incident to you especially as it comes at a time when the IRAQ authorities are apparently leaving no stone unturned in their efforts to convey the impression that Kuwait is engaged in running quantities of contraband' into IRAQ as a regular pas time | an accusation which we in Kuwait cannot but help thinking has a political origin and in some way or other is mixed up with the organised campaign now being conducted/conAxcted against this Principality (as witness the taxation of the Shaikhs Date gardens, the Faddaghiyeh case and the forcing of the Shaikh to pay export tax on his produce des tined for his om household use) • 5, From my own investigations, which have been conduct-* ed separately frcm those of the Shaikh, there is fairly good ■J i .. evidence that the Kuwait Dhow was crossing the mouth, The Khcr Abdullah on the direct route for the Shatt al Arab estuary, and had just left behind the old Turkish fort (Al Qishla), which is situated on the South Sast corner of Bubaiyan Island, when it was attacked by the IRAQ Customs Laundi whilst still in Kuwait waters. (Vide map Mesopotamia scale 2 miles to inch, sheet Kuwait)* 6* Also as far as one can follow the evidence at ones disposal, the IRAQ, Customs launch would appear to have crossed over from the IRAQ, shore and to have come some/miles outside its own territorial limits, when it made its rether trvU. cruel heartless attack, which, as you wp^ld see, had deprived two homesteads of their breadwinners, and caused two other sailors to be now lying desperately wounded in the American Mission Hospital here# 7 0 At the same time I fully recognise that there are always two sides to every story: certain it is that what ever the results of ones investigations here, the IRAQ, cus toms people will deny the Kuwait evidence in toto# They always do» The case, therefore, must eventually boil down to the dhow crews word against that of the Police Boat crew. This is the unfortunate part of the whole business as although we shall probably never get at the real truth of this sorry business, the results will be to make for fur ther bitterness and distrust between the people and G-overn- fCc ments of Kuwait and IRAQ, which both and I are always trying to better. &amp;•/8# It has struck me perhaps that the IRAQ Customs people at Fao (I refer more especially to subordinate officials and constables) do not know that Bubiyan Island belongs to Kuwait, and that the actual boundary line bet ween Kuwait and IRAQ follows the centre line of the Khor Abdulla from a point Bast of Warba Island { belonging to Kuwait) to the open sea: I make this suggestion as it was once or twice reported to me and as late as 1932 that on more than one occasion IRAQ Customs Launches have been seen creeping along the Southern shore of Bubiyan Island and once even in the Khor Subiyeh itself* That I did not take the matter up at the time was solely due to lack of proper evidence. 9• It, nevertheless, I think, would be a useful point to make with the IRAQ Government, if the question of the eocact whereabouts of the Kuwait sea boundary vis a vis the Fao promontory were thcrcughly instilled into the minds of the Fao Customs Preventive Officers. Clearly IRAQ has every right to do what she likes within her own terri torial waters, and if she suspects contrabandists to be planning a coup near her shores, no one here can complain against the action she takes, always provided she is within her side of the boundary line. 10# What is so unfortunate, and creats so much bad feeling here is the knowledge that IRAQ Customs Launches do operate outside their own waters, and may easily be tempted to commit acts of piracy, for the sake of the large rewards whldi are undoubtedly doled out to those successful in bringing in prizes. 11. I am sending you five spare copies of the report, with the request that one be sent to toe Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf if you see no objection to such/such course^ I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, vwv Lt.—Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait•Translation of a letter No.R-S/94E dated the 5th Muharram 1352 (1st May 1933), from His Exosllenoy Shaikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah, K.C.I.E., Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political Agent, Kuwait. After compliments, I am forwarding to Your Excellency a statement made by one Hasan 'Ashoor, regarding the oase of a small sailing ship (Balam) which was set upon and attacked near to the western shore of the Khor Abdullah, by a motor boat of the i'ao Preventive service (Customs) with the result that two of the crew of the Balam were killed out right, and two more were very severely wounded, they(the crew)having been fired on by the said motor boat, which, it appears, tried to stop rfckK and capture them on the high seas^. The surviving members of the crew however seeing this action of the motor boat, became afraid, put about and made for Kuwaiti The action of the Fao Director of Customs in such a place (i•e.Kuwait , s own waters) is clearly a plain infringment. If he desires to pursue smugglers, he should do so within his own boundary and punish any smugglers whom he may catch there• But his crossing the three mile limit and hunting down sailing ships in such places (as mentioned above) is a great mistake. Please, therefore, be so good as to submit the case to those concerned, so that there may not be similar oocurrances, which are contrary to all lawinternational. Usual ending.-f /9 Translation of statement made to the Director of Customs, Kuwait. •0o0—— /, This is to inform you that^I shipped per the Balam of Nakhuda Ali Ibrahim 10 bags of sugar and 5 bags V from Kuwait to Fao, as per manifest No.692, dated 25th Dhil Hujjah 1351 (EOth April 1933). When the Balam passed the ^Qishlah' and was just about to cross the lower end of Khor Abdl^i^ a motor boat came up, the crew of which started shouting and ordered it to stop. But 'when the crew under-» stood it to be the Fao Customs motor boat, they became afraid of treachery and began to change their course. This they did because the Director of the Fao Customs has on several previous occasions made it a practice to seize sailing ships, unmistakenly carrying cargo to Fao, under proper manifests from the Kuwait Customs Department, and has destroyed these latter, and takenthe boats to the principal Customs Department pretending that they were smugglers, this in order to get a regard from the Government. In the present case the nakhuda was clearly afraid some such thing was going to happen, because #ie had a mani fest from the Kuwait Customs Department for the cargo which he carried to Fao. The motor boat seeing that the Balam did not stop, *hen ordered to do so, fired at it. Two persons were killed including the Nakhuda^, and two were wounded. The rest of the crew in great terror and after much difficulty reached Kuwait in their boat. We have made the above report to draw your kind attention to this distressing incident, and to request you to be so good as to submit the case to His Excellency the Shaikh. Dated, 4th Muharram 1352.

Becently various consignments have 'been stopped and seized, and a number of persons arrested. But there is little doubt that Customs officials and road guards were well compensated 'by smugglers, and they are backed by local merchants who have made profits from the sale of prohibited goods. Efforts to stop the sale of such goods in Ahwaz were made by means of an order that monthly lists of all prohibited goods' in the hands of merchants were to be submitted to the Chamber of Commerce. All goods found in excess would be considered as smuggled. The Customs and police authorities subsequently carried out inspections of various shops where smuggled articles were known to be, and various arrests were made. x X X X x x ^ X x x x ***** *d i ' 'v C01CT1DSNTIAL.

His Excellency, as you will recollect replied that he had definitely been able to ascertain that the Dhows crew had landed and supped at the old Turkish Fort (Qishla) situate at the South East corner of Bubiyan Island, and had afterwards set out for Fao Bar: Further that the dhow had only proceeded a quar ter of the total distance across the mouth of the Khor Abdulla estuary, when it met the Customs launch. This would make the position of the dhow to be about to 4 miles east of the Qishla or South East corner of Bubiyan Island, and well within Kuwait territorial waters. 6 f On the assumption that the dhows crew landed and dined at 7 p.m., and continued their voyage at 7.45 p.m., they could not have proceeded more than 4 miles by 8.30 p.m. which would coincide with the evidence of the survivors, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, \ . - -* Lt•-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait.

I would further point out that all over the world the responsibility for checking smuggling rests on the country affected, in this case on 'IRAQ: At the same time in virtue of the close friendly relations which exist between us and all our neighbours, and in particular between us and 'IRAQ, I desire with the utmost sincerity to cooperate with the 'IRAQ Government in any way that is possible for me, and so to set their fears at rest. The suggestions,however, which have been made by the 'IRAQ Government, I am unable to meet in detail: In this connection I beg to point out that full precautions already exist in my state for the prevention of possible smuggling. Not a single steamship or sailing vessel can export anything from the port of Kuwait without being in possession of properly documented manifests, issued by our Customs Authorities* Neverthless in my desire to cooperate with 'IRAQ , I have given strict orders to my officials, to exercise the closest supervision in these matters. - 2 -/ 4 As regards the suggestion that I should place a small steam boat at the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab to watch the movements of boats - My reply is that the cost of maintaining such launch would be beyond the resources of my small state, but I shall consider the suggestion carefully. Lastly I venture to ask why is the f IRAQ, Government apprehensive of smuggling from the state of Kuwait alone? The frontiers of Nejd for instance like those of Kuwait abut on those of 'IRAQ, , and there are also other states which have ports on the Persian G-ulf besides Kuwait,m Ho. 23.

I took the opportunity, before addressing Your Excellency on the subject, of talking the matter over with His ;Hlxcellency the Shaikh when passing through Kuwait recently. His Excellency felt considerable indignation on the subject, though, as you will see, his letter is moderately worded. It seems to me indeed - subject to such explanation as the Iraq Crovernment have to offer - that this action on the part of their Customs subordinate, which h: s resulted in the killing of two Kuwaitis, and the wounding (seriously) of two others, is exceptionally high-handed, not to say brutal. Apattt frum tne fact that the Oust cms officials apparently opened fire on the Kuwait balam (small / sailing boat) in Kuwaiti waters, (paragraphs 5 and 6 of that the balam was smuggling. I trust, unless the Iraq Grovernment can give a satisfactory reply, that Your Excellency/ Maj esty 1 s Ambas sad or British Jtebassy, bagdad.-2- Excellency will see your way to lodge a strong protest in tiiis matter witJa tJiat Government on behalf of tne Shaikh# / 3. Apart from other considerations such incidents, as pointed out in my despatch lio.569-S of to-day's date, render my task of persuading the Shaikh to co-operate with the Iraq Government in anti-smuggling measures extremely difficult. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Secretary of State for India and to the Govern ment of India.

SUBJECT % Smuggliiig between Kuwait and Uraq. Sir, I have the honour to refer to Your Excellency^ letter i ! ^ Ko#i^0 oi tiie v'lst March, and to state that the proposals of the * Iraq Government concained. in it, for tne co-operation of xxis iiixcel l ency the bhaikh of Kuwait in checicing smuggling from Kuwait and 'Iraq, were put before his Excellency, and that when passing through Kuweit recently on my return from London I took tne opportunity of discussing tne matter with the Shaikh. The result, which I fear is far from being conclusive, is contained in the attached copy of a letter, i ^ K-2/916&gt; dated the 18th May, from His Excellency to Colonel | Jickson* I cannot help feeling that the somewhat ^on- co-operative' attitude of the Shaikh is - at any rate in part - due to the non-accommodating stand taken, in some _ «iattera which concern him, by the 'Iraq Government, ( vide y/ ' tne incident mentioned in my despatch «o.l07-S, dated the f^ 1st iebruary 1933), and also to the arbitrary methods employed by the 'Iraq Customs authorities, culminating in the killing ol two Kuwaiti boatmen, and the wounding of two others, as V*- reported in my despatch Ko.667-3 of to-day's date. As lone Hi s Ma j esty* s Ambas sad or, British Embassy, bagdad, as/ a i , v ■■-3- V) ♦ steam-boat at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab 1 which suggestion he will consider carefully*• As this proposal was one of tie measures which the 'Iraq G-ove nment suggested, I presume that it is the Shaikh who is expected to provide a steanuboat and not the 'Iraq authorities. If this is not the case, and ifc Is the lat er who are to provide the vessel, the point can be quietly dropped. 4. At the conclusion of his letter the Shaikh asks a i pertinent question: why is Kuwait singled out as the sole culprit? he Eejd border, for instance, also marches with that of Uraq, and (as for smuggling by sea) there were other ' States v/ith ports on the Gulf besides Kuwait. As the Shaikh said to me in the course of our conversation, he did not under- stand why, if smuggling does go on, a 'dead set' was made against Kuwait only? why did not tine 'Iraq authorities tackle Bin Saud, for example, on tiie subject? One has indeed only to look at tiie map to see tnat Saudi Arabia is in just a ^ood position as Kuwait for smuggling into 'Iraq, and - if the extent I of the contraband trade approaches the figure given by the Director of uustoms (paragraph 2 aboTe)-then Bin Saud's subjects have undoubtedly taken a large b&amp;nd in it. -nconclusive as the Shaikh^s letter may appear I am not without hope that finally some measure of co-operation will cc forthcoming from him. when I passed through Baghdad on my way to London on April 11th Sir Francis Humphry s was good enough to arrange a meeting between Mr. Sievwright,ac®d: the Director of the 'Iraq Customs, and myself, at which we discussed the question of Kuwait-'Iraq smuggling. Mr. Sievwrignt mentioned the proposal of an 'Iraqi Customs official at Kuwait' (i (a} of the/vr -4- the Ambassador* 8 letter of 31st MarcJa), and on my saying that I did not think the Shaikh would agree to this, suggested that z special Kuwaiti Oust ans official might perhaps meet the case from the 'Iraq point of view. I mentioned this possibility to the Shaikh, not as coming from the 'Iraq authorities, and His Excellency was inclined toi'avour the suggestion, though he has not mentioned this point in his letter. 6. There are two other points on which I would like to touch. The 'Iraq (xOTernment suggest that the Political Agent, Kuwait, might undertake the duties proposed for the 'Iraq official at Kuwait (vl) (b) of the Ambassador's letter). Prankly this proposal does not appeal to me as I feel the more the Political Agent, as a British Official, is kept out of Kuwaiti-'Iraq bickerings, the better. 7. The other point is that of a subsidy from the 'Iraq Government to the Shaikh to meet the latter's extra expenses in co-operative measures against smuggling. The proposal f was first mentioned in Sir Francis humphrys* letter J&amp;io.SO. ^ 629, dated the 3rd May 1932, to the Colonial Oifice in connection with the date gardens, and my views were given in paragraph 10 of my despatch Ho.34, dated the i6th August 1932, to His Majesty's Secretary of State for the Colonies. In principle there are objections to a subsidy from a foreign Power to a small State in special treaty relations with us. As long, however, as this subsidy coula be camouflaged as part of tiie compensation for the date garden© its objection able features were not so apparent. The situation now, however,/5 however, as I underitand it, is tiiat tne ^raq Cyovernment will only give the subsidy separately and as a direct payment to the Shaikh on account of his anti-smuggling co-operation* This undisguised form makes the proposal somewhat more difficult of acceptance* Presumably it might be given in two ways. Either (a) a lump sum to cover all expenses would be given which the 'Iraq u-overnment might feel themselves at liberty to curtail if they were dissatisfied with the results of the Shaikh^ co-operation, or (b) a sum to cover certain specific items of co-operation, such as the placing of a steam-boat at the mouth of the ^hatt-el-Arab,(see p&amp;r&amp;graph 3 above), and the provision of a specific number of extra guards to watch the Kuwait land frontier. (b) would be the less objectionable form of the two. J'or the present, however, I would like to keep an open mind on the question of a subsidy. 8. Personally I am most anxious that relations between Kuwait and 'Iraq should be of a friendly nature, and that any obstacle to such relations should be removed. Apart from any more ethical considerations, there is no doubt that whether n Ij.aq - 'vis a via Kuwait — has right upon her side in any particular incident, she certainly - in their mutual relations as a whole - has might. Kuwait is the smaller Power of the two, and there are many ways in which 'Iraq can make things most unpleasant for the Shaikh and his people. Kuwait, for example, gets its fresh water supply in Kuwaiti water boats from the Shatt«el-.Arab,i.e. 'Iraq territorial waters. 1 Iraq / . ■ has only to close, or threaten to close, the Shatt to these boats, (which I suppose she could do), or exercise vexatious restrictions on their movements under the plea of anti- smuggling/-6- 40 smuggling measures, for Kuwait to be put in a serious predicament* To taice the situation as it stands at present I think that the best line to pursue would be for Mr. Siev- wright f or the local Director of Customs at Basrah, to visit Kuwait, and hare a quiet talk with the Shaikh, Colonel Dickson and myself, if I can get over there. It may be that the result of this friendly discussion will be that some co-operation will be forthcoming frcm Kuwait, which will be unobjectionable from the point of view of the Shaikh, and acceptable to 'Iraq, I have not broached this suggestion to the Shaikh but have no reason to suppose that he will offer any objection. I venture to suggest therefore that at the present stage the 'Iraq O-overnment might be informed in general terms that in reply to their proposals His Saccellency the Shaikh has sent a friendly reply, but has not touched on their detailed proposals. That I have suggested the friendly 'round table 1 discussion, mentioned above, and that if the 'Iraq authorities concur I will suggest it to the Shaikh, and arrange a date, I feel, however, that the success of the discussion will depend not a little on the explanation which the 'Iraq (government have to offer on the incident reported in my letter Ko.567 -S of to-day' a date quoted in paragraph 1 above.

GENERAL. In order to understand the whole contraband ques tion in its proper perspective one must for a start appre ciate tlaat of the States bordering on the Persian Qulf we have two distinct groups of States holding diametrically opposite policies in the matters of customs tariffs. ( a ) -ersia , IRAQ., and Saudiyeh , all believers in the theory that the sole object of Tariffs is to increase the Revenue of the state, and to this end instructing their Customs Departments to make their duties as high as possible. Kuwait . Bahrain , Qatar . Debai (including the Trucial Coast generally), all Arab States lying on the Western shore of the Persian Gulf, whose firm belief is that low tariffs will attract trade to their ports to the definite detriment of the high tariff countries mentioned in (a) above® A not unnatural or incorrect assumption, seeing that their chief revenue is derived from their transit trade with the interior, and also the Pearl Trade, which is almost entirely in their hands. It stands to reason therefore that those countries (b) above in the Persian Gulf,possessing such low customs duties as 4 $ ad valorem, are going to get most of the trade whelre the necessities of life are concerned, while their in- Habitants are going to engage themselves in the contraband business with their neighbours possessing high tariffs (a) above. hII.GONTRABAim TRAFFIC ESTWESN ARAB STATICS IN THE PSRSIAN GULF AND ESRSIA. (a) The Persian policy in recent years of intro ducing prohibitive tariffs all along her seaboard, has natui ly been taken full advantage of by the states on the Arab side mentioned in paragraph I above, and until the arrival of the new Persian Navy, the running of contraband from the Arab Coast to Persia, was a most easy and lucrative pastime. Those chiefly engaged in the business were the inhabitants of the Trucial Coast with their ingrained love of piracy and adventure (as witness the rise of Debai from a village to a large town in 20 years; , although Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait have not been far behind in the game. (b) The advent of Persian new navy, and the strenuous efforts #iich Persia has since made to stop this illicit traffic, have already made themselves felt, and contra bandists working from the Arab side of the G-ulf are now looking round for less risky fields for their operations# Not unnaturally they have turned their attention to the next two best countries for making profits, viz Sa'udiyeh and IRAQ. Both these states maintain high customs duties as part of their national policy, especially on such things as sugar, tea, piece goods, silks, silver thread etc. etc. (c) The Kingdom of Sa^diyeh of the two, is the less easy to run contraband into, even though, it has a long and desolate coast line, with hundreds of starving Bedouins only too ready to run cargoes into the interior in order to make a little profit. The reasons for this are as follows:- U The terror 79hich Bin Sauds harsh andU~1 - 3 - ^ t and cruel viceroy of Hassa, Ibn Jaloui inspires among the Bedouins. 2# ^.he ^Q-Ct that the tribes of Hassa are almost all at enmity with each other and will invariably give each other awav» All know this. j * ^ Jaloui employs a small army of i .iurra n trackers to follow up the tracks of §11 caravan^ suspected of moving from the coast into the interior until it is round and can explain its movements. 4 # The fact that any Bedouin tribe, which captures a caravan carrying contraband is alloised to take three quarters of the whole cargo caught: The state only requiring the camels, a quarter of the goods, and the culprits. Id) IRAQ on the other hand, has a small but conveninet- ly sheltered coastline, with many shoals, roundabout the mouth of the Shatt al Arab, and in the northern reaches of the Khor Abdulla, also a long and from the contrabandists point of view, a most tempting desert frontier, several hundred miles in length, with police posts very far apart, a miserably weak preventive system of car patrols . which can easily be avoided, especially during the great heat of Summer, by determined persons, who know the country with their eyes shut and do all their marches by night. Lastly but not least IRAQ does not go in for the policy, as far as the writer is aware, of getting her Bedouin tribes to cooperate with Government, by a good system of subsidies/and suitable rewards for catching the contraband runners, with the result that every tribal man's hand is against his own Government, and well in league with every contraband runner^ III .KUWAIT AND CONTRABAND RUNNING. (a) if we reflect on the fact that there has been a failure of the pearl industry in the Gulf for the last 4 years, and that the King of Sa^diyeh has done his utmost to restrict trade between Kuwait and the interior of Nejd iNejd, by a system of land Blockade extending over a period t; of 9 years, it is not to be wondered at that Kuwait has, and does interest herself, in running contraband goods into her two neighbours territories, Sa'udiyeh and IRAQ, and into Persia when she can. Actually because of the fact that Persia has al ways maintained easily the hi^iest customs tariff of her neighbours (as much as 200 $ ad valorem/ on same kinds of goods), and the fact that Sa'udiyeh comes next (with an approximately 100 ^ tariff on same goods), IRAQ, with her more moderate customs duties, has been and is, the least sinned against, for quite naturally contrabandists make for the country offering the highest returns. • (b) As mentioned in paragraph 11(a) above, the ac tivities of the Per si an Navy have made it more dangerous than before to run illicit cargoes to Persia. Nevertheless the traffic still exists, for profits are enormous. The business is mostly in the hands of Tangistani tribesmen who sail across from Persia to Kuwait with cargoes of grain, fruit, oat fodder, and tr abbah n cloth♦ They take back tea and sugar. Those who supply them in Kuwait, are mostly Persian merchants, long domiciled in Kuwait, who have friends and relatives on the other side, who know the ropes* Cargoes are paid for in Kuwait and are run to the coast of Persia between Lingah and Bushire, the carrier going halves in the profits wtien disposed of. The difficult coastline of Persia / ^ is ideal for these operations. A few small cargoes are run to the Persian villages on the Barmashir channel running from Mohammerah to the sea: These are all small cargoes, however, and bring in little profit. (o) After Persia, most of the contraband trade trade leaving Kuwait goes into Nejd, sometimes by camel direct across the southern border, and at other times by camelscamels goin^ west) into the IRAQ, southern desert and then when opposite Qassim, breaking up into parties of two and three and making for Qassim hy a swift dash across the intervening desert* The most comnion method is for dhows to take cargoes down the coast to the vicinity of Jinneh Island and Abu Ali where there are a host of convenient shoals and hiding places• From there cargoes are landed on the mainland, where the starving Awazim, Bani Khalid, Ajman, and Mutair, who incidentally all have relatives in Kuwait to put them wise, are only too ready to cooperate if they safely can. It may not be out of place to mention that at the time of writing, the duty fixed by the Sa'udiyeh Governr ment on Sugar entering Hassa is Rs^ll/- on a bag costing Rs.11/-, so it is worth risking much to get the stuff in free# (d) As regards IRAQ. , who, as I have mentioned above is the third in order of States sinned against: What contraband does go from Kinmait across her borders, is run in the following manner:- 1. By small dhow to the entrance of the Shatt al Arab and to the upper reaches of Khor Abdulla. 2 # By camel and donkey across the western frontier of Kumit. Method (1) is managed usually as follows: Small traders from the various villages on the IRAQ side of the lower i reaches of the Shatt al Arab, come down^by small boat or 'Ballam' containing crews of perhaps 4 to 5 men each. They find things very cheap, as compared with the cost and trouble of getting the same articles at Basrah. The difference is probably about a quarter of what they would have to pay in their country. These boats, which come laden with fruit, vegetables, firewood, etc. for all of which Kuwait is dependent on IRAQ, fill up with loads suf-- 6 - loads sufficient to fill their boatsf approximately 10 to 30 bags of sugar or other dutiable articles. The crews then try and get back under cover of ni^it, either by entering the Shatt al Arab and creeping past Fao Customs Post, or dumping their cargoes on the 'boggy** mud flats existing at the top end of the Khor Abdulla, whence confederates at once take the goods over, and hide them in the many villages and hamlets existing in the Palm belt of the Shatt al Arab. It is true that occasionally small Kuwait dhows are hired to run these cargoes, but they are the exception and not the rule. ■ Method (2) is managed as follows, and as far as one can gather, much the bigger volume of contraband traf fic goes into IRAQ this way: For six months in each year Kuwait State Kuwait is overrun by the Muntafik and Hamar Lake shepherd tribes. Approximately some 15,000 persons male and female enter Kuwait after the first fall of rain (November) and spread themselves like locusts over the whole country from Safwan to the Kuwait Neutral Zone and as far west as Rigai in the Batin. These people are all the time sending parties into Kuwait to sell their sheep, wool and ghee and in return buy food and clothing, part of which is of course for their own legitimate needs, but a large portion is for passing on to confederates, who come dowi from the Eupherates from as far west as Samawa and live with them until such time as they can run the stuff they have bought across the western frontier of Kuwait. These con federates are all tough and well armed customers, who dress and look like shepherds. They arrive with plenty of money and either come into the town and buy themselves, or depute the shpherd tribal women to do so. The contraband so run usually goes through to the thickly populated tribal country- 7 - *r country on botti sidos of 'ttie iilupliera'fcesi Little of it, it is said, finds its way into the towns* The shepherd tribes do not themselves engage much in the actiml running of contraband across the border as for the most of their sojourn in Kuwait they are too busy minding their flocks, they do, however, harbour other tribesmen from IRAQ,, who easily pass locally for IR a QJ shepherds• When, however, the time comes for them, the shepherds, to move back to their homes in IRAQ, which hap pens each year in April and May, then each tent and family loads up as much contraband as it possioly can on i us don keys and takes it back to its home on the Supherates, for personal consumption. The volume of this particular form of contraband trade is nothing like that dealt with by their friends, the gentry, who caae down from the iiupherates with money in plenty especially to buy goods; ^or these work with camels (not donkeys) supplied by the Dhafir, Muntafik and Jasha*^ tribes, which carry five times as much as the small donkey of the country. (e) There is another and equally successful method to that abovementioned. It is the Dhafir and Shammar tribal method. Every year, just before summer sets in (April and May) several sections of these two tribes, move into Kuwait and camp on the wells of Jahara or south near the Subaihiyeh and Tawil wells. They come ostensibly to ^summer' near the ^Arfaj^ grazing grounds, which Kuwait is famed for. The visitors number anything from 30 to 500 tents. They all have their n pals M , especially the Dhafir in their rear, across the border in the IRAQ, southern desert. What easier for these sections camped in Kuwait territory to shelter IRAQ, contrabandists in the same way as the sbepherd tribes do. These latter, more often thani' 'v j - 8 - than not, paid agents of merchants in the towns along the Eupherates, sit quiet in camp and make their purchases througih the medium of the Bedouin with whom they are living These latter can he seen in droves coming into the town daily, and marching back to their camps with fully loaded cameIs♦ If one stops them and asks where the stuff is going to, they invariably reply 'for ourselves and our friends, we are engaged in , musabilah T : Iraq is too expensive for us to-day, and we are forced to cone and buy our daily needs fran. Kuwait'. Ihese Dhafir and Shammar purchasers are of course run, by means known to the Bedouin only across to their brethern in IRAQ, and then slowly and surely and in small amounts, find their way up to the Supherates towns. Ori ginal bales boxes etc. are carefully broken and rep^aq/ed into smaller parcels before the Supherates is reached, (f) It may be of interest to mention here that Haji Abdulla Williamson at one time in our intelligence service used before the war to run camels and contraband from Kuwait to Damascus by the desert route. During the Munta- fik rebellion against the Turks on the Eupherates, he ran rifles and ammunition from Muscat to the rebels, -e used $ to land his cargoes on the Ha^ia coast, south of ohe Kuwait Neutral Zone, convey them past Subaihiyeh and Jahara and across the Batin upto the Supherates and employed the Dhafir, Shammar and Ajman Bedouin for the purpose as described in (e) above. Haji Abdulla, with whom I have discussed the contraband question, has expressed his en tire agreement with the contents of this ,T lIote tT . T Y This contraband problem, I fear, is not going to be an easy one'for IRAQ to handle, nor would the Kuwait authorities find it any easier to tackle, however willing- 9 ~ willing they be to cooperate. This for the simple reason that Kuwait (a) is looked upon by all Bedouin of north east Arabia as their natural home and market for fill their wants and it is the policy of Kuwait to encourage this feeling inspite of Bin Saud^ Blockade; (b) Kuwait would to-day die a natural death if this one remaining outlet for her desert trade were denied her; (c) Any attempt of the Shaikh to control what the Bedouin bought or took out would be playing direct ly into the hands of Bin Saud, and would be a dead ly blow to his prestige. Furthermore it would be quite impossible for anyone in Kuwait to say what was legitimate or what illegitimate trade where the desert Arab was cone erne d» They come from the North, South, and West of the State, and it is not the shopkeepers concern to aks where their stuff goes, nor indeed would our friend of the Desert say where he intended to take his purchases for fear lest one of Bin Saud's spies in the town reported his movements to A1 Bagaawi, Bin Saud^ Chief Blockade Officer^ Nor must it be forgotten that the Shaikh of Kuwait, does all in his power to encourage trade with the desert tribes in the hopes that all goods will eventually find their way to Nejd, and so annoy Bin Saud. V* Undoubtedly the one and only really effective or satisfactory method for Iraq to adopt will, in the long run, be to reduce her customs duties on all imports to the lowest possible figure that she can afford, this as a matter of policy , and above all to give up the idea entirely of treat ing her Customs Department as a revenue producing concern. IRAQ, is surrounded by long, lonely and difficult frontiers, all eminently suited to the professional contra band runners methods. If she maintains her present very hi^i import duties, as she is trying to do, she will have to employ large numbers of preventive police, whose upkeep- 10 - »J b 'i upkeep and maintenance will swallow up all profits made. This is the writers considered view on the situation, and he has been able to study the problem from both sides of the picture, both when he was Political Officer in charge of the Muntafik for 5 years, and to-day with his 4% years experience of Kuwait. ri One last point* One notices that there is a grow- ing tendenoy in IBAQ, and elsewhere, to believe that the people of Kuwait Town are the actual 'contrabandists' and are the hold villains who are for ever going backwards and forwards into IRAQ plying their nefarious trade. This is an entirely erroneous idea. The ICuwaitis are quite content to sit in their shops and sell their wares. The actual con traband runners are always Persians, Nejdis or IHAQJS, who come fran their own countries armed with the necessary funds. These gentry as mentioned elsewhere are always in the closest touch with confederates on their side of the border, who are a necessary part of the game. YJ.1* A final point: Let it not be thought that no contraband comes from Nejd into IRAQ, just because of the fact that Nejd maintains a higher, tariff than IRAQ. It is common local knowledge that luxuries, such as silver thread w Zerri t, , ,, unwoven silks' and especially'Japanese piece goods' which to-day are being dumped in ever increasing quantities and at far below fair trade prices, into the Hejjaz and Hassa, are regularly being brought up into IHAQ, via Q.assim, by Bedouins who have no transport charges to bear. It should never be forgotten that a camel journey from say Medina to IRAQ, is nothing at all to a Bedouin. It is indeed a sort of pleasure and pastime, and enables him to see new faces, and bring back strange goods in return. in There are signs also that melted dcwn silver is going /to IRAQ, from Nejd today in considerable quantities. The IRAQ, customs are no doubt aware of this. TEII.TL11* To sum up: If IRAQ seriously desires to check the flow of contraband across her borders, the writer with very- great diffidence, offers the following advice: (a) She should reduce her present Customs all round, and get away from the idea of looking upon the Customs Department as a money producing con cern ♦ (b) She should, as Bin Saud does, get her tribal elements on the border to assist by offering them 4 of the proceeds of any contraband they can catch or be the means of catching. At the same time IRAQ should realize that (b) is a double edged weapon, and one which like the ^boomerang' might easily come back and hurt the thrower - in this case, IRAQ.

My dear Laithwaite, When we discussed your official letter P.Z.3919/33 of the 4th July, enclosing Dickson's interesting memorandum about smuggling from Koweit, I understood that you would be glad to know what our Legal Advisers said as to Koweit 1 s international obligations in regard to the prevention of smuggling. I cannot do better than give you Beckett's minute. It is as follows:- 'There is no international obligation upon 'Koweit to take active steps to prevent persons 'smuggling goods from Koweit territory into that of 'her neighbours. It would be wrong for the Koweiti Authorities to assist it, but that is another matter. 'At most the case cannot be put higher than to say 'that in the circumstances it would be hardly in 'conformity with the attitude of a friendly State 'for Koweit to refuse to consider any scheme of 'co-operation at all, if it were put up to her by 'Iraq and the scheme involved no burden on Koweit 'other than the loss of illicit profits; but even 'this, I think, is putting the case rather high.'

Humphrys 10*- explained that this memorandum had been given to him personally and unofficially, and that he would take the necessary action on it, merely leaving us a copy for record. 2. I understand that Humphrys proposes to call a conference in Bagdad to discuss the question after the leave season is over, to be attended by himself, the competent Iraqi Ministers and advisers (including Sievewright) and by the Political Resident and Dickson. This seems to us a good plan, more particularly as it fits in pretty well with the proposal made by Fowle that the matter should be discussed by Dickson and himself orally with Sievewright. But in view of what Humphrys has said we do not propose to take any further action in the matter unless and until we hear from him again. Yours ever, (Sd.) GrEOEGrE BENDEL J.Gr.

MEMORANDUM BY YASIN PASHA HAMED TO SIR FRANCIS HUMPHRYS. 11th July 1933. Confidential A Memorandum of the Customs position between Iraq and Koweit. The situation of Koweit on the Persian G-ulf adjoining the soutern frontier of Iraq, constitutes a very serious menace to the Customs revenues of Iraa owing to the smuggling that takes place therefrom. The problem has been under consideration for the last two years but no result satisfactory to Iraq has been reashed in discussions that have occurred; on the contrary the position is developing from bad to worse. The smuggling takes place both by land routes and by water: the former in the extensive area between Basrah and Nejaf and the latter by means of the tidal inlet, known as the Khor Abdalla, which gives direct access from Koweit to the neighbourhood of Zobeir. The area around Fao at the mouth of the 3hatt-al-Arab frequented by boats that obtain the fresh water supply of Koweit from that vicinity, is also much used by traffickers in contraband trade. Since armed patrol cars have been instituted to protect the Zobeir border, the illicit trade has been forced northwards as far as Nejaf and seawards towards Fao. The incentive to smuggling is afforded by the low tariff rates imposed at Koweit on goods imported (believed in most cases to be below 10^) compared with the much higher duties/7 h duties levied in Iraq on the articles principally so traded in such as Sugar, Tea, Coffee, Matches, Cigarette paper and Tobacco, It is not possible to state the extent of loss in Customs revenue to Iraq, but if it is assumed that the seizures made amount to one-tenth of the contraband trade then a rough estimate of £30,000 annually can be mentioned. It is possible that a certain quantity of this illegal trade emanates from Arabia proper, but the difficulties of transport in an almost waterless tract of desert help to discount this alternative. As a measure of prevention, the importation of manufactured articles of origin foreign to Arabia is forbidden across the land frontiers between Zobeir and Nejat and at places on the Shatt-al-Arab except'Fao, Seeba, Abul Kasib and Basrah. The posting of an armed sea-going vessel to patrol the entrances of the Shatt-alArab and the Khor Abdalla is now contemplated. Smuggling being as profitable as it is found to be, there is reason to suppose that organized arrangements are being employed by the traffickers. Formerly the main trade of Zobeir was illicit, but the armed patrol cars have acted as a check to some extent and the area of wrong-doing is thus being spread. It is natural that bad characters « not necessarily residents of Koweit - are finding employment in the manner indicated and affrays are frequent. Within the last year three Quoljis (Iraq Customs guards) have been killed by rifle fire and quite as many smugglers have been similarly accounted for. It cannot be said that His Excellency the Sheikh of Koweit is a party to the malpractices described, but there is no doubt that his people - and perhaps some of his officials - find a very profitable living by what occurs. The Kingdom of Iraq and the State of Koweit are on friendly terms and it is very necessary that an agreement should be reached to put a stop/7M stop to an impossible condition of affairs which not only loses substantial revenue to Iraq, but involves a heavy expenditure on preventive arrangements which can never be entirely effective. Some measure of control of Koweit trade and proper supervision over their Customs arrangements is urgently called for. The Iraq Delegation wishes to discuss what form such control could take under conditions which would adeauately safeguard its interests.3iJ ®8lf t! f; : d0 8 t% ■ ;39 5is b : : WO DOicip pflll 3d! , 1 iljJOS it.: « eli insi (357/35/33) I have the honour to transmit to you herewith, in continuation of my despatch Wo. 27 of June 83rd last, a copy of a reply which has been received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the request that enquiry should 'be made into the attack made 'by an * Iraqi Government customs launch on a Kuwaiti helium, 2. The official report accompanying the note from the Ministry reveals such a wide divergency in essential facts from the statements made in the enclosures to your despatch yjp ^ No. 567t-S of May 29th that further representations to the 'Iraqi Government would not he justified without very careful investigation into the true facts of the incident. According to the report of the Customs officer, the helium was no more than one hundred yards from the 'Iraqi shore of the Khor Ahdulla when it was called upon to stop, and it was, there fore, a long way from being in Kuwaiti territorial waters. The statements of the Kuwaiti boatmen are silent regarding their having fired at the Customs launch, and convey the impression that the firing was entirely on the part of the 'Iraqis. Definite assertions are made by the Customs officer that the bellum was the first to open fire, when called upon to stop, that intermittent firing took place from the bellum, and that the Customs launch was hit in several places. If the bellum was in fact the aggressor in 'Iraqi waters the incident assumes quite a different complexion. /3. t.-Colonel G. Loch, Dffg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUSHIRE.- 2 - 3. I suggest that the accounts of the incident given 'by the crew of the 'bellum should be re-examined in the light of the enclosed report and that I should he favoured with your observations regarding the affray in the light of any further information obtainable. 4, I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty^ Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

The facts of the case are as follows On the 24th April at 9 # 30 p.m. the Customs patrol launch H Thetis' in charge of Preventive Officer Phillip Effendi llowe patrolling on the eastern shore of the lOior Abdullah sighted a bellam within 100 yards of the shore. Upon proceeding to inspect the bellam when the launch was within hailing distance the crew of the hellam warned them not to approach nearer, and as the launch still proceeded the crew of the bellam opened fire upon it. Thereupon the Preventive Officer withdrew the launch, distributed arms and ammunition to his crew, and examined his stocic of fuel. Finding this low he put one of the crew ashore in a canoe to proceed across the spit of land, a question of a mile or two to Fao with instructions to the Sub-Preventive Officer in charge to bring re- enforcements including Police and extra fuel in the launch 'Arthenis'. He then kept the bellam in sight, the crew of which again opened fire as he approached and this time he ordered his crew to return the fire, and intermittent firing was kept up on both sides for some time. The bellam proceeded out to sea, and after 3 hours, i his fuel getting low and the other launch not having arrived the Preventive Officer gave up the chase and returned to his base at Fao. There he learnt that the other launch had gone to his assistance with re-enforceme nts of three policemen and two quolchis. This launch returned later in the day, at 3.0 p.m., \7ithout sighting the bellam. Ho casualties occurred on our side as the armour•• 2 •• plating in the fore-part of the launch afforded sufficient protection. The launch was hit in several places without material damage; one bullet pierced the hress airing supports, another passed clean through the horn. It will be seen from above that :«• 1. That the bellam was in 1 Iraq waters being only 100 yards from the shore on the eastern side of Khor Abdullah, Just across the spit of land from Pao. This fact is confirmed by the fact of the Preventive Officer putting a man ashore to cross this narrow strip of land to bring re-enforcements from Fao # which, in fact, he did the same night of which there is emple proof. Owing to the width of the Khor Abdullah it will be seen from the map that this could not have been done if the bellam was on the western side as alleged. 2. The aggressors were the crew of the bellam. They opened fire on the Customs launch. 3. The details given of the damage done to the Customs launch confirms that the smugglers did use firearms and kept up their fire for sometime. This is not the action of innocent traders. 4. All smugglers from Kuwait to 'Iraq invariably provide themselves with a manifest from Kuwait to Fao for use in case they are intercepted by our patrol boats and shepherded into Fao. This practice I have had personal experience of as far back as 1923• They also often carry manifests for Qusbah as well for use in case the Persian authorities intercept them. 5. No legitima1»r trader ships Sugar from Kuwait to •Iraq with the intention of paying 'Iraq import duty. It is an indisputable fact that such a transaction must result in a loss. The Kuwait authorities adnit that the bellam was carrying sugar - this one fact%t&gt; •» 3 ** alone indubitably etamps the transac-tion of one of attempted smuggling.

You will observe that the 1 Iraqi Government consider that no useful purpose would be served by a conference at Kuwait until the Shaikh has agreed in principle to enforce certain specified measures of co-operation in Customs control, or has made concrete proposals of his own. In the light of the uncompromising expression of opinion contained in the enclosed note I feel that it would be quite useless to attempt to persuade the 'Iraqi Government to depute officials to discuss matters at Kuwait. It appears to be necessary for the Shaikh to decide whether or not he will agree to adopt one or other of the schemes suggested for his consideration.

The Shaikh feels that the Iraq Government have, in this matter, made rather a mountain out of a mole hill, mainly due to interested parties having exaggerated and mis- represented matters at Baghdad and he had hoped that it woulc have been possible to convince the Iraq Government through their chosen representative here that Kuwait was not Inot behaving as bad / as she was painted, 4. As you will have observed the Shaikh definitely in his letter of 13th May 1953, forwarded to you under this office confidential No.lCf^ dated the 20th iiay 1933 inti mated his desire to live on amicable terms with all his neighbours, and in the case of Iraq to cooperate in any way that was possible, where questions of alleged smuggling arose, so as^ to set their fears at rest^ , (his words). He also said that he had given the strictest order to his offic ials to watch this particular problem very closely, though, as he said at the time to me, he naturally could not, as the Head of the State admit of its existence. His Excellency lastly pointed out in his letter that not a single steamship or sailing vessel could export anything by sea from Kuwait without being in possession of a properly documented ships manifest issued by his Customs Department and tinder the seal and signature of his Director of Customs. More than this it was derogatory to his rights and dignity as an Independent Ruler to go. 5. In the course of my present conversation with him His Excellency made it quite clear that it was quite impos sible for him to agree to the Iraq Governments proposals as forwarded in British Embassy, Baghdad No.20, dated the 31st March 1933, to your address, because to do so would be tamtamount to admitting the overlordship of Iraq, and that she had a right to dictate to control the internal affairs of the independent State of Kuwait. 6o The Iraq Government,added His Excellency was clear ly endeavouring to make him, the Shaikh, do their work for l -f them, and spend money on measures that were her responsibi- orvJ~ lity entirely. Even if smuggling was going on with his a* knowledge there was no international obligation on Kuwait to take active steps to prevent persons smuggling goods from Kuwait into the territory of her neighbours. 7. It was surely the Iraq Government * s business andjifyi rz 'nai . if they thought such was a necessity. And again it was and not his to post a guardship outside the shatt-al-Arab '^00 'taos gfrf surely up to Iraq to place a string of Customs posts along the v _ v. * . \ 3 WWil ^ aa ^ail ; At present a clear 80 miles of frontier was entirely innocent 08 - ' Kuwait-Iraq frontier if she thought smuggling going on^ * oh' b--Bc §]j! of anything at all in the shape of customs posts or patrol- sdt £1% ling parties. 8« My ovm view, as I have had occasion to remark in another despatch, and I know His ICxcellency believes this to he the case also, is that Iraq is making use of this newly 'dug up ?t smuggling 'cry' to bring political pressure 3 ^ T on Kuwait in the same way exactly as she is making use of ; - 3 5 ton,? his p a te garden property on the Shatt-al-Arab. In other words 2 v'it is a means to an end and part of the carefully laid plan 0j&amp; VllS'j*'' to bring Kuwait to her knees and force her into the Iraq fib fold, U -v '*1 .aflotsi/si t . | .p f * jqr al/ 9* , The Turks did exactly the same thing in the old &gt;0 # 5,f53 ' } JlZ-' ■?,'to when attacking Shaikh Mubarak, and His Majesty King v: 0 Bin Saud has been making use of the weapon for the last q© ^ 10 years, but where he adopted openly hostile methods and tried to strangle Kuwait by a direct blockade, Iraq now uses xji 10-t 6lii .■ | f ^ ^ ^ ' the more subtle methods of the Turks. 59mbwio! i ^ ^ 10. The Shaikh, who has had bitter experience of the Turks as a youngjman, recognizes every move of the game as played by the present Iraq Government officials. Unfortunate -ly there are few Englishmen in Iraq or the G-ulf to-day, who ^ rl r worked with the Turks, and so can appreciate the Shaikh's view point. 11. So long as Kuwait depends for hC*^existence on trade with the great Bedouin tribes of the interior of Arabia 1 60 v ^ . so long is she bound to encourage,by every means m her V :• .a ■JOVBSW i $'■ 03 ^ S power, these tribes, to send in their caravans and make their purchases in Kuwait. It is life to her. 12, Bin Saud has tried in the last 9 years to prevent anything/anything at all going out from Kuwait into his dominions, but without real success; Iraq is threatening to act in simi lar maifcer, by asking Kuwait to agree to impossible conditions such as her posting of guard ships off the Shatt al Arab etc. What is Kuwait's answer? She merely asks both Bin 8aud and in the present case Iraq to do as other nations of the world do, and not interfere with her trade with the interior, but place a sufficiency of customs posts on or near the frontier line to ensure that customs duty is paid. But one cannot help feeling that Iraq, like Saudiyeh, does not want such an arrangement: The object of both being to kill Kuwait and not to collect customs. 12, It may be of interest to know that from certain underground sources at my disposal, I learn that smuggling into Iraq has greatly decreased of late, and that far the greater quantity of contraband i s today going into Nejd. This is due, in the main, to the rumours of war between S^udiyeh and Yemen and the consequent lessening of control which has resulted. 13 # Another point of interest is that several caravans at present small, have recently left Kuwait for the Hanran district of Damascus.

Presence of .n..ed * Iraqi Customs launch in Kuwait waters, between Maschan Island and Khor i^ubiyeh. ;ir, In continuation of my telegram No,233, dated the 1st October 1933, I have the honour to forward translation of a letter No.R/3/1235, dated the 13th Jamad Thani 1352 (3rd October 1933), which I have re ceived from His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait• 2. His Excellency the Shailch first reported the launch incident to me at a Tennis ^.arty on 29th September at 5 ?.L1,, the day before the arrival of the 3enior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf with 1st Lestroyer Flotilla* \ Ee was clearly worried and asked me to telegraph a short summary of the incident to you at once. This I did on 1st October, as you are aware, and after His Excellency had also -.Bntioned the incident to .the senior ^aval Officer, Persian Gulf. 3, The Shaikh told me that he probably would not have heard of the matter for several days had he not himself visited Palaikah and Maschan Islands on the morning of 29th September, whilst on his way back from the pearl banks where he had gone to give the signal for the return of the Kuwait pearling fleet (guffal), The inhabitants of the Island, he said, re- ^ VC&lt;? /reported to him that they had seen the ifao Customs launch eft the previous evening, and on several occasions during the latter part of September, moving about in most sus picious manner between the entrance to rQior Jubiyeh and Maschan Island, and examining water boats and other sailing craft, who ma 13 a practice o:; 1 using this channel when proceeding to and from - p ao«. Some of the islanders further testified that they had, on one occasion, seen the launch take shelter from a south east wind and anchor west of 'he % asr Subiyeh promontoiy, that is to say, actual -ly inside the ba v of ^uwait. 5, According to the shaikh also, one or two of the islanders whose fishing boats had been held up, volunteered the further information that the launch crew had told them that their role was to hold up all craft carrying merchan dise from Kuwait to 7ao (except water and fishing boats) and convey them to ^ ! ao, and charge their owners r ith smuggling and that no manifests in their possession would y help them, as the^e would be destroyed. This latter evi dence however, though important Lnd though it bears out many other stories I have heard about the methods of Pao preventive officers, must be taken v/ith reserve, I think. In response to the Shaikh*s enquiry as to why they, the islanders, had not reported the presence of the launch to Kuwait earlier, they replied that as poor fishermen they had not dared to do so, lest their in formation eventually come to the ears of the Fao authori ties and they be punished by having their boats seized and nets destroyed (ITot a difficult operation on a dark night)« 7 # On the 1st and 2nd October the Shaikh at my request proceeded to make iramediate enquiries from some nakhud r ,s of water boats, which had just come in from Fao» Their evidence he incorporated in his letter of 3rd October to me (under reference). 8v- 3 - 8* ■ Eis jixcellency verbally explained to me that he had found difficulty in making these men talk, for they one and all were engaged in carrying water from Fao, and some had families there. They were clearly afraid of consequences and begged him not to forward their names to the Political Agent (myself) as this would end in their certain ruin with the Jao authorities who would certainly, in due course, be supplied with the whole story, of how they had informed* Tor this reason, His Excellency said that he was averse to divulging actual names, at any 'ate for the present, lie had however got their written statements and could get others from the Falaika Islanders if necessary. 9* According to His Excellency some of the boatmen when being interrogated pointedly asked what he, the Shaikh, had been able to accomplish about the Kuwait boat which had been attacked by the self same launch on the high seas at the end of June last, and had had 2 men killed and E severely wounded out of a ere?/ of six. (^ee my letter No.264, dated the 5th Hay 1933). That inci dent, they said, was an utterly unprovoked attack on an innocent and harmless craft and happened far from the * Iraq Coast, the whole local seafaring world knew this. The very presence of the said launch today near Llaschan clearly proved, they said, that the t Iraq authorities ordered her to go far afield, and also as clearly showed that neither he, the shaikh, nor the Political ..gent, had been able to get satisfaction or compel the Customs De partment to confine their activities to their own ter ritorial waters. 10« As the Shaikh explained, and I fear I must agree with him entirely, the disturbing point about the whole thing is the irresponsible, increased boldness shown by the Fao Customs authorities these days. For their launches to act so far afield from T Iraq waters- 4 - -11/ afield from -Iraq waters as they are doing proves con- elusively, I think, that (a) They are receiving direct encouragement to do so from higher authorities: (b) They are not in the least afraid of con sequences. In other words they believe that His Majesty 1 s Government the protecting power is either powerless to do anything, or does not wish to bring pressure on the 'Iraq Government. 11. In this connection I have only to refer you to the correspondence and especially to lette'r IL. J /85, dated 24th June 1953 from the Director of Customs and Jxcise, 3aghdad to the ministry of 'inanee which was forwarded under your i:o.ll|-5-8, dated the 31st august to illustrate wha t I me an # J 12 # I greatly regret to have to say it, but the story put forward bears every indication of having been en uirsly concocted, and if you will read my original despatch Ho.264, dated the 6th Hay 1933 carefully you will note that i prophesied that such a complete deniQ^ would be put up by the Customs Department. The Kuwait story of the attack was siiiple and straightforward one on that \ occasion, and one would have liked to see the T Iraq government do the honourable thing and admit excess of zeal on the part of their preventive police.Instead they, 2 months after the event took place, reply with the curious sto-y that one armed launch (whose first volley had knocked out 4 men) could not single handed tackle a small dhow ^ v ' „ - men oiil\ j but must needs send for another armea launch from J'ao, to come to their assistance. They omit Lo mention that the 2 men escaped with their craft ano orought her safely back to Kuwait, a not very creditable performance from their point of view if their story bore any relation to facts.11. I trust you will strongly press for a clear assurance from the ? Irac[ Government that theix armeo. patrols will not invade Kuwait waters again, and will con fine their activities to their own waters, otherv/ise tne next thing we shall hear of will 'be a sea fight between the Shaikhs armed forces and the ^raq.

After Compliments, With reference to our verbal complaint with regard to the armed /ao Customs launch, 1 beg to infom Your Excellency that the presence and activities of the said launch in the shallow waters north and west of the Island of Maschan have been confirmed. The most recent occasion on which the said launch was seen there, was by some waterboat nakhudas » who ply backwards and forwards between Kuwait and Fao. These saw her on Wednesday the 27th September 1933 (i.e.6th Jamad thani 1352) in the morning at about 3 0 T Clock ^.rabic (8.20 A.M.). Other nakhudas also depose to have seen her in the same place and on the same day at 1 # 30 Arabic time \ .A.M.y. She was again seen (also by water boat nakhudas) on Thursday the SStii September 1933 (i.e. on the 7th Jamad thani 135E) in the evening at about 11 0* Clock Arabic (4 .20 .ir a iti. ). Small boat-owners engaged in the Fao Kuwait ferry service from whom enquiry has also been made state that the above are not the only days on which the launch has been seen in Kuwait waters, but that on several other occasions prior to the ones mentioned above she has been seen moving about and keeping watch in and about the par ticular Y /aters in question. I therefore beg to draw your attention to this transgression, which I never would have thought the Chief i j?ao Customs officer would have for a moment countenanced. I request that you be so good as to refer the matter to tjj ... v a.ithoi it ies cOiicerned anc. ask them to put an iiimediate stop to these activities, which are being practised by the Uniex customs Officer (at Fao). 1 make this protest and ' request lest a serious misunderstanding take place which vYell spoil uhe rej_ations 01 two good neighbours.

Hy views a 'e, and have been able to collect no fresh evidence to make me alter then, that the original Kuwait story of the attack was a simple and straightforward one, and far more likely to be the true version than the complicated and rather wonderful one out forward by the Director of Customs, and two months £ 'ter the incident took place. Their story as put forward, that one armed launch, whose first volley had knocked out 4 out of a crew of si six could not tackle a snail boat defended by 2 survivots, but must needs send 'or another armed launch from Sco to come to their assist; nee, does not ring true. 6, I had occasion to remark in my confidential des- T3a uch i.o. . , dated the 11th October 1933; one would have r i - liked to see the 'Iraq .rovernment do the honourable thing and ^ ' admit excess of zeel on the part of their preventive Police, Kuwait would have reacted imnediately and generously, I am very sure.

To make quite certain about things, I renewed my inquiries into the iatte ■, ■xad I filly satisfied myself that the statement of Hasan *Ashoor and the survivors was the truth, and it lias been proved that the Customs launch has for long made a practice of interfering and intercepting boats at any place (on the high seas). The boat in question met the launch at the entrance of Khor ^bdullah, and one of the launch crew shouted to the crew to lower their sail. The latter from the start were nervous that the launch would treat them as she had often treated other boats, namely that she would board them, tear up their manifest, and tow their craft to Tao declaring her to be a prize caught smug gling, so that they (the launch crew) might win a reward from the Iraq Government. The nakhuda of the boat in ques tion clearly also became afraid, though he was in possession of a .Tr o manifest, which he had taken with him from Kuwait and ciecided uo run lor ^uwait and not submit to examination. Hext when the crew began to turn their sail i.e.(to resume their course back) the launch fired a volley at them and idxle.. u ;j ..rsuns and ounded two others. The survivors (2 men) after great difficulty and trouble, managed to return to Kuwait. It appears to me quite certain that the OfficerOfficer of Tao is trying to exonerate himself, when he states that the incident happened within 100 y^ards from i « -ord anu when he sa3 r s that he landed one of his crew on the same shore to get help from Ifao.

They only got off in the evening. (f) When the Police investigating officer took Hussain Sffendi, Hie Commandant of the launch, himself and the two unwounded sailers (Mohamed and Abdulla) back to the alleged scene of the outrage, he, Hussain Sffendi, guided tiiat official up the Khor Abdulla and pointed out, as the place of the incident, a spot on the reverse side of the Fao Penin sular, behind the Dawasir Date plantation, - a position in actual fact very far from the actual site of the attack (See sketch attached) (gi The rolic© Cxficer himself appeared to doubt tiie truth of Hussain Sffend^s statement, in view of Iheir, the jolly boat crews, protests, and repeatedly tried to make him adait where the true spot was, but without success. (h) Hussain Iff endi and his launch crew had clearly conspired together to tell the same stoiy, namely that the jolly boat had been found close in shore behind the Dawasir Date garden, and so in 'Iraq waters. The inference being tnat she had discharged her cargo on the Iraq shore and was making off. 4* If the evidence of Hassan bin Abdulla is a true statement of fact, and I see no reason to doubt it, after the severe cross questioning that I put him through, items (a), (c) and id) of the preceding paragraph would appear to have been wholly indefensible acts on behalf of the Customs launch. Further from statements (b), (c) and (e) it would appear quite clear that the attack was made in Kuwait waters Bubiyan Island being a part of Kuwait State. As regards (f), (g) and (h), it would appear that Hussain Sffendi realizing he had done wrong, did everything to th row dust in the eyes of the Police Officer for obvious reasons. 5. My inspection of the Kuwait Customs House books ahews that on the date in question.

In any case one fact remained clear: She was empty at the time of the attack, and was wending her way peacefully to Kuwait, her home port. 9* What His Excellency objects to so strongly, and rightly so, I think, is that the jolly boat was attacked and taken in Kuwait waters. There can be no doubt of this in view of the evidence, seeing that both she and the attacking launch lay aground on Bubiyan Island the best part of a whole day. 10. The Shaikh points out that, were the Fao Customs people playing the game according to the rules, and dis playing their anti-smuggling activities within 'Iraq water only, til ere would be entire confidence all round and no one would complain, least of all himself, but the reverse was the case, as witness the similar affair of last April (See my No .S64, dated the 61h May 1933), and the recent operations of 'Iraq Customs laundies close in to Kuwait,— 4 •• K\iirait t between Maschan Island and IQior Subiyeli# (See my isgo . / despatch No♦ 245 of 11th October 1933) ♦ .a J ^a&gt; v - 1 trust a very strong protest will be made to the Ivv^--' 1 Iraq GoTernment in this matter, also that same will be us] f v \&lt; back ® d a demand for Rs # 600/-, blood money to go to the \m,: relatives of the murdered man Abdu Shah, and Rs # 200/-, . s ,. | ^ \f \v- ' ■ kz : , v ^^ood money, for the wounded man Hassan bin Abdulla, I ^ vv\y^ f hk ''' ^ ^efini'oifr ^ 801 purj&gt;oseiy asking nothing for the murdered Nakhuda, as X to r, 3£ ^ he ie not a Kuwait aubject.

After 2 nigits and 1 day including the ni^it on which we set sail, that is on the morning of the second day, at 1 0*Clock (6»15 A»M») 15th October (?) we met the Fao launch near Has Buhiyan* The officer in charge pretends that he touted to us to lower our sail, we certainly did not hear him, all we know was that he fired four rifle shots at us» ¥e signalled to him not to shoot, and as the weather was calm, we shouted to him (the officer) to bring his launch alongside. He however refused, and opened a steady rifle fire on us and continued same, till he had killed our nakhuda, Haji by name, and wounded Abdu Shah, who at the time was holding the mainsail rope and lowering the sail. We were close to the land of Bl;biyan. Next I was hit Thereupon the remaining 2 of our crew threw them selves into the Sea and swam to the launch where they were hawled on board. They explained to the officer (Hussain Effendi) that he had killed one man and wounded two more, and that their boat carried no cargo at all. The officer at first tied them up and beat them severely, then he untied one man and sent him across in a ^dug out' canoe to fetch Abdu Shah and myself to the launch. After that the launch came along side our boat, which in the meantime had grounded by the stern. The launch also went aground. In the evening at about 2 O'Clock Arabic (7.15 P.M.), we both got off with the tide, and the launch towed us to the 'Bangalah' (Fao Customs House). We arrived there at dawn (16th October?) They sent me, 1he dead Nakhuda and Abdu Shah to Hospital•• 2 •• Hospital, and the other tiro unwounded numbers of our orew th^r sent to the local Police Station. After we, the wounded men, had had our wounds dressed, they sent Abdu bhah by land to Basra (his wound was serious). Then they took me and the 2 unwounded sailors with the Chief of the Police in a launch to a place behind the Dawasir Gardens (i.e. up the Khor Abdulla). Ih ia piaoe Hussain Sffendi pointed out as the spot where the firing took place. But when the Police Officer asked us, we replied that it was not Hie place at all, but that the true spot was near x^as Bibiyan. After much argument with Hussain Bffendi and much endeavouring to make him point out the true place of the shooting, the latter refused to alter his statement. We therefore all returned to Fao at 1 O'clock Arabic, night (6.15 P.M.). On arrival we were at once driven off in a car to Basra Police Headquarters. Next day we were taten to the courts, where we gare report similar to that which we gave at the 'Bangalah' We remained in court till 6 O'clock Arabic (11.15 I.M.). We were then taken back to the Police Station and received an order of release. Hassan Abdulla. Thumb Impression. D/-S3.10,33. -ooo—• q i Lt^-Colonel, Polltlca 1 Agent, Kuwait.

I hope you had a successful trip to Doha. I found the SheiKh of Kuwait in very jpod order although, of oours:, still distressed about his date gardens and the blockade. I went into the question of his vessels being inter fered with by Iraq customs' craft and having heard a good deal from both sides, am convinced that these craft have been operating in Kuwait territorial waters. He looks to us as his protector to stop this interference as he wis! es to maintain friendly relations with Iraq. Although smuggling undoubtedly goes on the Sheikh naturally will not admit it, and hr s warned his people that if they smugrle they do so entirely at their own risk. His complaiiit is that the Iraqis must obey ordinary international'law and stop the smuggling in their own territorial waters, which is a perfectly reasonable attitude to adopt. He^is also rather upset about the posts aBd telegraphs having been installed by Iraq in his territory — according to him - without his permission, and being run'by -i- r ctQi o % . _ is s. splendid fellow and I am suro will receive the kind treatment he deserves in the Ions rmu tho ltno ^'y ou '[i} 1 enjoy your trip with Simeon in H??-, • Th ey wall all be full of interest and you vail find thee a very good party* ant Cblonel •W.Powle, 0.

Sir, With reference to your telegram No.llSO, dated the 11th December 1953, I have the honour to forward the follow ing documents, which I trust will provide all the information you desire on the subject: (A) Note on the 'Drinking Water' available in the Town and immediate vicinity of Kuwait: (B) Note on the various points on the Shatt- al-Arab estuary where 'Drinking Water' can be obtained, at different seasons of the year; (G) Rougji sketch map of the mouth and bar of the Shatt al Arab, showing the approximate boundary of * Iraq territorial waters, to wards the open sea. II»(i) As regards ( a ): I have prepared this myself from notes which I collected for Army Headquarters, India, recently, the facts mentioned are from personal observation and enquiry. (ii) As regards (B): I have collected the datagiven ; direct from a number of Dhow (BUM) Captains, who are regular ly engaged in bringing drinking water from the Shatt al Arab it to Kuwait and selling/to the public. Although I found a certain divergence of opinion as to the 'exact spots', at different months of the year, where sweet water could be obtained, I think the information given in my note will be fo^d approxiBHtel^y correct. m vIt should be realized however that the ' sweet water line ' dividing the definitely salt water from the definitely sweet water does, and must, always vary with the strength of North and South winds, as well as with high tides and low tides. The r t exact spots Tt mentioned by me, are of course where absolutely sweet water can be found, though it will no doubt be appreciated that for a considerable distance below such points (say 2 miles) drinkable, though brackish water is always obtainable. (iii) As regards (C): I was kindly assisted in obtaining material „or my sketch by Lieutenant Thomas, R»I5 # , Navigating Officer of n.M.S.Shorehanu The latter gave it as his opinion that the ^ boundary ^ of ^raq territorial waters towards the open sea, must be considered to be 5 miles from the southern edge of the MARAKAT Abdulla Mud Flat which, he said, at dead low water (neap tide) is exposed as per sketch (See blue at hi^i tide line). This gives us/a distance of fully 10 miles of open water from Fao promontory to the limits of T Iraq's terri torial water. Whether Lieutenant Thomas* estimate of the bxz^e of the riiUQ flat is correct and whether his viewnoint as to the extent of 'Iraq's territorial water is the right one, I am not expert enough to say, but I should imagine that he. is not far wrong in his views. IIIo. fou will recollect that His Excellency the Shaikh when discussing this matter with you^October last, gave it as his opinion that drinkable though perhaps not entirely sweet water could be obtained all the year round (in an emergency) from a point outside 'Iraq's 3 mile limit - that is to say from a point approximately at the western entrance of the Hooka channel. He, evidently, like myself, had no idea of the enormous extent of the Uarakat Abdulla mud flat, or that such was ever entirely exposed which says itis at/- 3 - lUV j? tt A . ^ ant . at extreme neap tides I have the honour to be, Sir , lour most obedient servant, ^ ' - Lt»-Golonel, xolitioal Agent, KuwaitIMMEDIATE VIGINiaY. Inside the town proper of Kuwait, there are many salty and brackish. Y/ells v/hich provide water for washing purposes, 'but only one exists which give good sweet water, but this only in small quantities. Immediately outside the town walls and close to the official Bedouin camping grounds, there are two groups of wells known as (a) A1 Dasma ( Id ) xi 1 Shamiyelu The former need not be considered in this note as thesre are only 40 wells, in poor condition. The latter i.e. the 'Shamiyeh' wells, consist of nearly 600 small wells. They are situated in several groups to the South v /est of the Town, and from/a mile to a mile from the walls. Though the number sounds imposing, the wells themselves are poor affairs, scooped out by hand, and in some cases lying only a few feet apart. None of the wells are lined, and mostly are under a yard in diameter. The wells vary considerably in yield and quality, and also, to some extent, in accordance with the seasons of the year; some becoming rather brackish towards the end of Summer. One recently tested was 40 feet deep, and had 2 feet of water, yielding 45 gallons which, however, soon refilled. In former years these Shamiyeh wells used to supply practically the entire population of Kuwait with water, but with the great increase in population during Shaikh Mubarak's reign, they began to prove insufficient, particularly after a scanty rainfall. The rainfall during the Winter of 1907-1908 was particularly bad and in the- 2 - in the Summer of 1908 the water problan may, for the first time, be said to have become acute. It occurred to one boat&lt; owner to try importing water for sale from the Shatt-al- Arab, and, as it was found that water so brought could be sold very cheaply, and yet return a good profit, a regular fleet of water carrying boats, has grown into existence. At the present day there are 49 boats, of the type known as ^ 'Bum', employed exclusively in this trade, of these an average of 6 arrive daily, each with about 8,000 gallons of water worth roughly HsolOO/-. Many more people, especially the poorer classes now drink imported river water than water from the fr Shamiyeh n wells, as in view of the high rates of donk^r and camel carriage from the latter, they find it cheaper and easier to do so» - Ox a 3ritish force stationed at or operating from Kuwait, there wDuld probably be sufficient water available from the Shamiyeh wells to supply all needs especially if such force were camped near to the wells themselves. As in the case of the townspeople, however, trans port has to be considered and it might be found more con venient and economical to use imported water, which could , , . boats always be maue available in reasonable quantities,^/being brought to any part of the foreshore desired. No pumps or piping are available, as the water is always landed from the boats in skins or in kerosene oil tins, ^arge numbers of locally made wooden water tanks are available. One or two sweet water wells exist at Haweli (5 miles) and 3irra (10 miles) but the cost of bringing in the water would certainly be prohibitive for the great majority of the population.rt b ' NQT^ ON THS ViiEIQUS FOIKTS IN Tl-Ii!

THS TSAS BY ICUV/^IT WxiTJjR BCATb^ (i) For purposes of determining the approximate sweet water 'points' required, taking into consideration, tides, winds, current, full stream, half stream and empty stream, it will be necessary to divide the year into 3 seasons, which I shall call (a) Hi^h Flood Season (normal) when snows are meIting. (b) Low Flood Season (normal) when river is a3ipty» (c) Half Flood Season (normal) when the 'Iraq rainy season is on, ' (ii) At the sanB tiiiB it must be realized that other minor factors also affect the question under discussion, which it would be inconvenient to discuss here, (iii)Taking each item separately we get the following resul ts During (a) Normal Hi^h Flood Season (March, April, May, June) sweet water can be obtained anywhere in the river estuaiy between the extreme southerly point of the Fao promontory and and the southern end of the date belt on the Persian shore. This during ordinary flood years. Should the 'floods' be exceptionally higf i that is to say well above the average, sweet water can be obtained as far south as the western entrance of the Hooka Channel, This is however rare. The above rule applies for 'mean' tides, should the tide be high and at the samej u ^ - 2 - be blowing, the sweet water limit, will move two miles upstream, while vice versa for a low tide and north wind we can add a couple of miles in a seaward direction^ During (b) Normal Low Flood Season. (July, August, September, October) sweet water canbe obtained under the following circumstances and at the following points: At High Tide and with north wind blowing five miles south of Abadan, (Faddaghiyeh Estate,.) At High Tide and with south wind blowing in the vicinity of Abadan itself, At Low Tide and with north wind blowing a little be low the half way point between ixbadan and Fao (Dora Estate). At Low Tide and with south wind blowing 12 miles below Abadan» ^or a 'still' day the mean between the above fibres may be taken. Luring (c) formal Half Flood Season , or during ♦Iraq's winter rainy season (November December, January, February) sweet water can be obtained as follows: If rains up country have been g;ood . between Bao and a point 3 miles below it, taking into consideration wind and tide. If rains up country have been poor, between Fao and a point 3 miles above, according to wind and tide. Note (a), It may be worth mentioning that the inhabitants of /ao for approximately 6 months in the year have their drinking water brought them in boats.lu-j - 3 - (b) During the above 6 months each Kuwait water boat, as it calls at r^ao to be examined by the Customs Authorities before departing with ''full taliks' for Kuwait, gives local o ioials 4 kerosene tinjS of sweet water as a good will offering.

STIBJKC'; Snuggling between I^iwalt and 'Iraq. Sir, I haTe the honour ^o refer to paragraph 8 of my despatch !To,569-3, dated the S9th May 1933, In which I mentioned the pressure which -Iraq could hrinp to hear on Kuwait hy exercising restrictions on the movements of the Kuwait water-hoats. The point is of importance as it is not only in connection with smuggling, but In other matters also, +ha+ this pressure could he applied. I asked Colonel nickson to Itrrestigate the matter and 1 enclose a copy of his Report, Ho.S98, dated the i6th Decemher 1933. • briefly, the situation would appear to be as follOTSfS. Local wells exist which were sufficient for the local population in pre-war years. These wells, however, depended largely on rainfall, and owing to the Increase of population under Shaikh Mubarak's reign, in about 1908 their wte* supply began to prove insufficient, especially when the rainfall was poor. Water then began to be brought in boats from the Shatt-el-Arab, and there are now some 50 boats employed exclusively in this trade. In an emergency/c\ aner^encv the local population would be able to carry on ^Ith the local supply, Taut they could perhaps only do this for a short period. Artesian wells could profealaly 'be sunk with suceess which may render the local population corapletely independent of the Shatt-el-Arafe water,'teut this would, cost raoney and. throw out of employment the men employed in the water-carrying trade. 3, With regard to the actual supply of water from the Bhatt-el-Arab, Apparently under the most farourahle conditions, which only exist for four months during the year( March to .Tune ),fresh water can 'fee obtained at the western entrance of the ^ooka Channel. '%ether this area is in T Iraqi waters may Ise douVtful, but as fresh water could only be obtained from this area for the comparatiTely short period already mentioned, this point is not of much practical Importance. For the rest of the year to obtain •esh wa'er the water-boats have to proceed above a line drawn from the extreme end of the l?ao peninsula to the southern end of the date belt on the Persian shore.i.e. well within 'Iraqi waters.

The visit of H.M.S.Hawkins and quite recently the ar- rival of the Ruler of Bahrain in H.M.S.Shoreham, kept me very busy and I have got behind hand with a lot of my work. I had an anxious time when the Hawkins was about to arrive, as my one and only cook went down with Delirius Tremens and died after a five day struggle, in which both Greenway and Mylrea fought hard to save him. 4. His death and funeral took place 2 days before the Admiral, Mrs.Dunbar-Nasmith, and Captain and Mrs.Creagh were due to stop with me. You can imagine hov/ I felt. 5. Luckily I found Holmes* cook in the Bazaar, and got him to help during the visit. Since the Hawkins departure, however, I have had no cook, though one is coming. 6. The surprising part of the whole business is the fact that neither I nor anyone else here ever even suspected the cook of drinking. 7. Of course an enquiry was held and as a result I got the Shaikh to deport the offending Jew and his family (who secretly sold the Araq) out of Kuwait. 8.

[II h Sir, »/ith reference to my despatch Ko»263, dated the 1st November 1955, and paragraphs 6 &amp; 11, I have the honour to report that the sailor xJ )dul ohah was wrongly, but rather excusably, reported by me as having died of wounds at Basra. 2♦ It appears that ^bdul Jhah t s relatives, who are quite poor people here were told by the ITao Police that he had died and been buried at Basra and that was the end of ew the story from thys point of view. 5, ./hat actually happened was that ^bdul ohah hovered between life and death in the Basra hospital for 3^ months, made a remarkable recovery and returned to his delighted family literally 1 as one from the dead t on December 20th last* He, however, had a relapse on arrival and was again confined to his bed till 10th January. 4, Abdul 3hah T s wounds were (a) a rifle bullet through the right thigh (b) another rifle bullet through the lower part of his back which passed through his body and out to the front completely severing one testicle and half his penis. «Vound (b) has maimed ^bdul ohah for life. 5. His Excellency the Shaikh sent ^bdul Shah to me on 15th January thinking I might like to take his evidence. 6. The man was still suffering from the effects of U &gt;&lt;—- iIk _ 9 _ of Ms wounds, but was- able to confirm the whole 'shooting' story as reported by Lie. lie however made the additional statement that he had not been shot in the preliminary general firing that took place on their boat, but in a manner savouring of a deliberate attempt to do murder* Ke said that firing had ceased altogether and the launch crew, finding that no one returned their fire called out :T We give you peace (Aman) . .76 will not fire any more, Jxpose yourselves'. Le thereupon stood up (he had been lying down taking cover) and lowered the sail, began to furl it with his back turned towards the launch, suddenly a volley was fired and he fell wounded from behind in two places. 7. He emphasized (as already reported) that there was no wind at all when he was lowering the sail and the inci dent took place. He also Tt swore on oath' that the boat had been on a legitimate trip to Bandar Dilam, was empty when it was 1 shot up 1 , and carried no firearms at all. 8. The man volunteered the interesting information which I certainly had not heard before that both Phillip Jffendi and Hussain Sffendi had since been removed from . their posts at Fao. 9. In the light of the above events, I desire to modify paragraph 11 of my despatch No.263, dated the 18th November, referred to at the beginning of this report and trust that the blood money asked for by me from the T Iraq Government as compensation be altered as follows: (a) Hs.400 for the man Abdul bhah. (He is maimed for life). (b) ?cs»200/- for Hassan bin ^bdulla. (Wounded but recovered). oxj 0 10 o I would letesl reiterate my request that the jolly boat be returned by the Customs authorities to the rightful owner at an early date.

As I note that some doubt appears to exist as to the limits of Iraqi territorial v /aters in this region, I think it advisable (in view of the Conference which is to take place on February 15th between repre sentatives of the Iraqi Government and of the Shaikh of Koweit) to transmit to you herewith copy of a note on this subject which was addressed to the Iraqi G-overnment on November 29th, 1929, together with a further note of March 7th, 1930, making certain amendments thereto, 3. Prom the terms of these notes, you will observe that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom support the views expressed by Lieutenant Thomas in the enclosure to your despatch under reference and in that the Iraqi Government are well aware that,/claiming that the whole of the Rooka channel lies within Iraqi territorial v/aters, they would receive the support of His Majesty's Government, In any case, there can Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel T.C.W. Fowle, C.B.H., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E .can be no question I think that the western end, where the Koweiti water 'boats operate, is in Iraqi waters and I consider that His Excellency the Shaikh of Kaweit should oe left in no doubt on the point. I trust that the position will be made quite clear as a result of the conference alluded to above. 4. I should be glad to be favoured as soon as possible with your observations as to the actual subjects which the Shaikh's representatives propose to discuss with the Iraqi government at the forthcoming conference which I hope will avoid as far as possible, too detailed reference to past incidents and will concentrate on the ways and means of preventing their recurrence in future. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, /h /h0 P Y) Secret, The Residency, No« P» 0. 287. Baghdad, dated 29th November, 1929. My dear Prime Minister, Will you please refer to Sir Gilbert Clayton's Secret letter No.P.0.188 dated the 9th of April, 1929, on the subject of the position of the 'Iraq G-overnment in regard to the Hooka Channel, in which he stated that His Britannic Majesty f s Government were unahle to form a definite opinion on the position until a survey of the area had been completed. The details of the survey, which, as was stated in the last paragraph of that letter, the Port Director had been asked to carry out, have since 'been received and have been given careful consideration by His Britannic Majesty's Government. The result of the survey is to show that large areas of mud flats on 'both the 'Iraq and the Persian sides of the estuary which were formerly considered to be dry in patches only at low water, have, in fact, a definite low water line. In the opinion of His Britannic Majesty^ Government the 'base-line for the determination of the limit of territ orial waters is the line of mean low water spring tides, and the flats thereby are to be regarded as territory. As a result of the information furnished by the survey His Britannic Majesty's Government have reached the following two conclusions (l) That there is a strong case for considering that the mouth of the Shatt-al-'Arab is a line joining the extreme end of the mud flats on the /'iraq^raq and Persian shores to which I have referred above, and that the waters of the river down to the mouth may 'be claimed as 'Iraqi national waters. This line would take within the Shatt-al-'Arab area a portion of the Hooka Channel. (2) That it could reasonably be contended that the Rooka Channel is wholly outside the Persian territorial waters and lies partly within 'Iraqi territorial waters and partly in the open sea. As, however, there is no generally recognised principle of International Law governing the limitation of territorial waters of two riparian States at the mouth of a river, the result of a reference to arbitration on this point could not be predicted with any certainty. It is,therefore, most important to avoid a dispute with Persia on the point mentioned in sub-paragraph (2) above, and this, in a lesser degree, is also true of the conclusion in sub-paragraph (l) above. I am therefore able to advise Your Excellency that in the opinion of His Britannic Majesty's Government the establishment of the proposed Shatt-al-Arab Conservancy Board and the delegation to that board of the responsibility for the upkeep of the Hooka Channel would offer the best means of eliminating the risk of dispute with Persia on this very contentious subject. Details of the evidence on which the above conclusions are formed will be sent to Your Excellency as soon as they are received from London, 'but in the meantime I strongly recommend that an early decision should be given on the question of the formation of the Shatt-al-Arab Conservancy Board (to which my /Conf identialy) Secretariat of H.E. the High Commissioner for 'Iraq. Baghdad, dated 7th March, 1930. My dear Prime Minister, Will you please refer to my Secret letter No. P. 0.287 dated the 29th of Noveinber, 1929, on the subject of the position of the 'Iraq Government in regard to the Rooka Channel. His Excellency the High Commissioner has 'been informed that as a result of further consideration which has been given to the point mentioned in conclusion (2) of that letter, it is considered that the position would be better explained by the substitution of the following 'That it could reasonably be contended that the whole of the Rooka Channel except a small portion of the Eastern end lies within ? Iraqi territorial waters. The eastern portion so far as it lies more than 3 miles from the Abdulla Bank must be regarded as probably being partly Persian territorial waters and partly open sea, but the position is doubtful as, according to the principles of international law recognised by His Majesty's Government, it depends on what must be deemed to be the line of the coast north of the end of Abadan bank, and sufficiently definite information is not available as to the extent to which the mud and sand flats south of Dorakistan project southward. It would be reasonable that the control of the whole of the Hooka Channel should rest with the Authority responsible for the river, but there is no generally recognised principle Secret. No. P.O. 75. /of| 9#'' of International Law governing the limitation of territorial waters of two riparian States at the mouth of a river, and the result of a reference to arbitration on this point could not 'be predicted &gt; h] ■ , with any certainty.' !q Hi His Excellency will be obliged, therefore, if ! the above paragraph can be substituted for the sub- ■ ' o :: 1 ^ . paragraph 2 in my letter referred to. .JilEi . r Yours sincerely, . is;;: . 6 er (Sgd).

This letter should therefore be :l 7 f -read in conjunction with my ^Confidential &amp; Personal n letter dated the 31st January 1934, which ccmes by the same post as this. 2» In considering my present letter, I would ask you also to kindly peruse very carefully (a) My confidential despatch No.47, dated the r v/ 8th March 1933: (b) His Excellency the Shaikh's letter, forwardee under my confidential despatch No.103, dated the 20th May 1933: (c) My Note on contraband questions forwarded MM you under my confidential No. 113, dated the 30th May 19 33: (d) Paragraph 7 of my Note on the discussions held in Baghdad with His Majesty's Chargds D'Affaires, forwarded to you under my confiden tial memorandum No.179, dated the 8th August 1933, and (e) My confidential No.219, dated the 14th September 1933; as these will enable you to understand the Shaikh's attitude of mind as well as the imminent danger that Kuwait stands i . win if sur pgiici © p is nicicLs 'to *I p6lq _ on 'fcli© gpounds of expediency. So I am also enclosing with this a precis of His Excellency's talk with me yesterday (30.1.54).. It is lone- and reads somewhat disconnectedly, I fear, but that is due to the fact that as he talked I took down ndtes of wtat he said. He particularly asked me to send them to you. 4« ohortly the Shaikh t s attitude, which has semewhat hardened in the last few months, may be summed up in the following words I am an independent state, just as f Iraq is, I have just as much right to try and improve the trade of my country and people as T Iraq ha^: The very existence of Kuwait as a state depends on my keeping avenues of trade open with the tribes of the interior. Bin Saud has, by his blockade destroyed S/3 of these avenues, and now 'Iraq is trying to divert the remaining l/3 of Kuwait t s trade with the Bedouin to her port of Basra, by means of diplomatic pressure, and the demand that Kuwait should cooperate and stop what to ♦Iraq is smuggling, but which to Kuwait is legitimate trading. To stop all so called smuggling' by land, would be to kill little Kuwaiti remaining source of life, her import trade^and would bring about my Stated certain destruction. Gn the other hand ^raq, an immense ly rich country, is not appreciably affected by the so called smuggling through the Bedouin tribes of the interior, I can therefore only come to the conclusion that the pressure now being brought to bear on me is only part and parcel of the 'general unfriendly attack^ which has been going/going on against me during the last four and a half years, and which has cost me close on Rs»50,000/~ to counter, (Date Gardens Revenue, Bashiyeh and Faddaghiyeh cases, ?ao case^ and water-boat- persecution). I am quite aware that there is no international obligation upon me to take active steps to prevent persons smuggling goods from Kuwait territory into that of my neighbours, provided I and my officials do not assist, for ' / I have taken legal advice on this point. (In this connectio^ see Mr»Warner of the Foreign j b ^ ? 7 / Office D.O. No»P#Z»4555, dated the 28th July 1933 to Mr.Laithwaite of the India Office)^. 5» The above being the Shaikhs attitude and view point generally, he thinks that the policy you and I should adopt in Baghdad at the coming conference should be one of 'Wait and see ft «. As ♦Iraq's attack develops her arguments may be countered* But in the main our attitude should be defensive, 6, My views are those of the Shaikhs, especially as I know positively with my 4^ years experience of Kuwait's hinterland trade and my 7 years experience as an Administra -tor in the Supherates, that nothing short of killing the whole of Kuwait's trade with the interior will really 6-c stop smuggling. This would of course unthinkable, and fortunately for us would be an impossible undertaking. 7. At the same time I realize that it will be good policy for the Shaikh, who after all is in friendly re lations with ' Iraq, to do what he can to appear to want to cooperate. In this light therefore let us examine what Kuwait can and cannot give away, also in what way 'Iraq can do likewise. (i) Kuwait can tighten up the issue of manifests to all ships that put to sea from her port. This she already does, but it can be made moremore strict» She cannot i (a) issue manifests for goods that go into the interior, for nothing goes out of the town in hulk, or by means of organized caravans• All that happens is that individual Bedouins come into the Town buy their needs, and disappear again, Kuwait in other words is like a big English market town, and just as in England thousands of persons may be seen daily coming into the town from the country in order to buy their small wants from the shops, and go home again; so does the same process go on day by day in Kuwait* It would be impossible t to control this daily shopping business, short of closing all gates for good on the land side, for the simple reason that no one knows what it is eventually intended for the ^raq markets and what not. You cannot punish the innocent Bedouin^ legitimately buying his wants, or ask the shop-keeper to try and spot the prospective smuggler by preventing suspicious individuals buying from him. The thing is impossible. (It should be realized that Kuwait always has a nomad and village population 4ft- outside her walls of anything upto 10,000 souls, who have to be fed). (b) Post a guard ship outside the Shatt al Arab, because she cannot afford to do so. Nor would such be of much use. (c) Patrol her borders , and hold up smugglers, for the simple reason thajfc as mentioned in (a) above, these do not work in caravans but as individuals, and the country to be guarded is- 5 - •-q: (3, ti o &lt;8 A Tn u is vast desert with a 120 mile frontier line* Such patrols would be faced with the difficulty of saying what a man was carrying for his family use or what was intended to be taken into 'Iraq* (d) She cannot accept the appointment of an , Iraq official in Kuwait to watch the Blockade question, and issue permits for goods that go by sea to 'Iraq, as it would neither be practicable nor serve any purpose with the land tradegoing on unchecked* Nor could Kuwait accept this interference with her sovereign rights, ii) f Iraq can on the other hand:- (a) place a string of customs posts along her frontier between Safwan and Higai. She has none on this 120 mile stretch at present. (b) She can get her Bedouin tribes, especially the Dhafir to cooperate on her side of the frontier by a system of subsidies, and giving them a share of the 'catch', as Bin Saud does. She prefers not to do this, and so the Dhafir have become one of the chief snuggling tribes. (c) She can base car patrols on Busaiya and Zubair, the former operating from Rigai to Jarishan, and the latter from Jarishan to Um- Qasr, to look for and seize 'dumps' of contra band goods collected on the 'Iraq side prior to being sent on to the riverain area. (d) She can make it an offence and bring pressure to bear on her own powerful merchants in Baghdad, Basra and elsewhere. (I could give names of certain of these if necessary), and forbid them to import sugar cargoes to Basramarked ^Basra option Kuwalt n on the throat of confiscation. Any cargoes so marked in the Bills of Lading which go to Basra in 70 cases out of 100 are intended to be landed in Kuwait. d (e) She can stop the enormous export of ^raq cigarettes that now come to Kuwait free of 'Iraq excise duty, which are merely dumped in Kuwait by interested 'Iraqi firms with the deliberate intention of getting them sent back into 'Iraq as contraband through 'Iraqi bedouin in their pay. (f) She must know or should be able to find out the names of 'Iraq traders engaged in con signing cargoes to Kuwait for contraband pur poses (I am told these are some of the highest in the land), and can take steps to punish them. (g) Lastly but most important of all, she can reduce smuggling to a negligible quantity if she will only reduce her duties on sugar, tea, matches and tobacco to a reasonable figure.. There is nothing under the head ' Cannot 'that I can think of, so I do not mention any* 8. Our policy at Baghdad therefore, in my opinion, — — —-• n- should be to listen to what 'Iraq has to say, poit out Kuwait's difficulties, and counter by pointing out the things she can herself do to stop smuggling. That the remedy lies in 'Iraq's hand there is no shadow of doubt at all. At the same time we can 'rub it in' that the Shaikh of Kuwait is sympathetic, where he can be, without actually hurting himself, and we can quote as an example » that he arbitrarily takes full duty on 'Iraq merchants- 7 - 'Z o S merchants cargoes consigned ,T Basra option Kuwait^ even ■fclxough. such cargoes are not landed at Kuwait at all but go on to Basra. This he does in his efforts to stop this form of smuggling. I have the honour to be, Sir , Your most obedient servant ♦ ' ' Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait*NOTE GIVING THE 'VIEWS OF HIS EXCELLENCY ' ^TEE SHAIKH. ON THE a^UGGLING QUESTIONS WITH t IRAQ,. 4' Dicated to Lt^-Golonel H 0 R»P .Dickson, G»I»E., Political Agent, Kuwait, by His Excellency the Shaikh on 30th January 1934 for submission to the Hon T ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf 1, Kuwait was an independent State long before Sa^di Arabia and modern t IraQ[ had come into existence# In the past she had developed, prospered and become a great cemtre of trade for middle Arabia and the Bedouin tribes of the interior, including those of 'Iraq* 2 m Bin Saud then appeared on the scene, rose to be a great King (incidentally by the help of the SlHikh of Kuwait), and feeling himself strong enough to defy both His Majesty t s Government and Kuwait, decided to stop all trade moving from Kuwait to his dominions* His openly avowed object was to divert Kuwait trade to his ports, and so make the latter important at the expense of Kuwait. His real reason was the hope that he might compel Kuwait to cone into the Nejd fold (as Asir did) to escape destruc tion®. He declared a strict military blockade, but in the process he kept his personal relations on a more or less friendly footing# This was 10 years ago# 3, He, the Shaikh complained to His Majesty's Government under whose protection he was, but got no re dress- For ten years he raised his voice, but without result# His Majesty's Government's policy was apparently one of expediency'. She did not want to offend Bin oaud, so the Blockade went on# 4 As a result the total receipts from the Kuwait Customs fell -drom approximately 10 laos of rupees per annum in 1922 to Rs.60,000 in 1932. Kuwait today was a weak and crippled State and great poverty ruled witMn her borders^ 5* During the post war British occupation ofof 'Iraq there had never been much trade between Kuwait and the f Iraq tribes or the towns on the IHupherates, far the simple reason that 'Iraq's reasonable customs duties then attracted the bulk of overseas trade to the port of Basra. Kuwait was comensated by her steady trade with Nejd and Qasim. G, When however new 'Iraq was given her independence, she slowly but surely began to raise her tariffs on all imports from overseas, till they approximated roughly to the very high and vicious figures ruling in Persia. This especially applied to s\jgar and tea, vital necessities of life; it meant that the same bag of sugar which in Kuwait cost Rs® 10/- was sold in 'Iraq for Rs„40/--. This policy simply invited trouble. 7« The inmediate result was that smuggling which for the past 10 years had only been going from Kuwait into Nejd (Because of Bin Sauds Blockade) began slowly to flow also into 'Iraq. 'Surely', said the Shaikh, 'the fault was entirely 'Iraqs, not his, for this state of affairs'• 8, The chief 'profit earners' in this smuggling business were well known business houses in 'iraq, who commanded capital in abundance — while those who tookaway goods intended to be run as contraband were 'Iraq tribesmen invariably. One of the methods employed was as follows: Merchants in 'Iraq arranged for cargoes {sugar mostly) to be consigned 'Basra option Kuwait V and then landed such cargoes when the steamer called at Kuwait, and had them stored by selected Agents to await favourable opportunity® Next when their spies ^and they had cBny of these within the 'Iraq customs department itself, reported that proper vigilance was not what it should be, or had relaxed, the merchants arranged with certain Shaikhs up-country to sendto send, small parties of men down to Kuwait to take delivery of tlie goods (always in small (Quantities) and convey ttiem to selected dumping places in the ^raq southern desert, such as Bedouin camps etc» where the contraband was general ly made up into bigger parcels or bags for removal up to 'Iraq, He, the Shaikh, wanted it to be clearly under— stood that he disapproved of such methods, and had as far as he was concerned, forbidden caravans carrying whole bags or cases to leave his Town* He could not stop small quantities being bought of articles of food and clothing• He had also made it a practice to charge full duty on 'option' cargoes owned by 'Iraqis, even if such were not landed and went on to Basra. This was his contribution towards stopping ♦Iraq merchants using Kuwait as a port for their back-door trade• Why, however, did not the ^raq Government do something to help themselves by forbidding her nationals to import sugar under this 'option' cargo system? Why should the onus of being 'hasty' be thrown on him, the Shaikh* The commonest form of smuggling, if smuggling it could be called, was by means of the Bedouin and river tribes ofIraq. This was quite unconnected with merchants in 'Iraq. These gentry were n\t quick to learn of the profits to be me.de, due to the 'Iraq Government's high tariffs. They came down to Kuwait to sell ghi, skins, wool etc., and under the guise of innocent shopping, took away goods, much of which no doubt eventually got to 'Iraq. It was the same method employed by the tribes of Nejd during the last10 years. The 'Iraq tribes had themselves learnt the game. 9. To him, the Shaikh, and to the shopkeepers of Kuwait it was all good trade, and the latter merely sold their goods to the Bedouin and did not naturally carecare wlsre articles so sold eventually got to. This was not their business. They merely sat in their shops and sold their goods. 10» This increase of ♦Iraq's tariffs, has to some extent, no doubt, bettered Kuwait's trade ,111 the way described, during the last years, for Kuwait's customs receipts have risen from the Rs,60,000 level, mentioned in Rs* para 4 above, to close on/70,000 in 1923, a poor comparison however, compared with the figures of 10 lacs ©# and over of 12 and 15 years ago. 11* The next step was the discovery by 'Iraq that her high customs duties, was diverting trade to Kuwait. This must be stopped at all costs, she says. She, therefor begins to raise the cry of ' smuggling from Kuwait ^. She goes further, she decides to follow Bin Saud's method and if possible destroy the only outlet left to Kuwait trade in the interior. Not only was it all good business, but like Bin Saud, 'Iraq also, no doubt, hoped, by a policy of strangulation to persuade Kuwait to come within her fold 12» The position of Kuwait, placed as she was today, between her two powerful neighbours, was an unenviable one. Bin Saud on the one hand was trying steadily to divert what few imports she had left to his own ports, by a com plete prohibtion of trade with Saudi Arabia. 7 /hilst 'Iraq had now joined in the game, and seemed equally determined to divert to Basra what little trade Bin Saud had left to Kuwaiti 13 4 To use the Shaikhs words n Two big saluqi dogs were worrying a small Jerboa, each intent on devouring it, the latter by wriggling and turning was trying to save itself, but where was Great Britain, who was supposed to be the protector of the Jerboa'. Tf Glearly ', said the Shaikh, ^if both Bin Saud and 'Iraq were allowed to get their way in this matter, the t^e end of Kuwait was near, for it would mean that she would nave to close her gatesit vi t? - 5 - gates by land to the Bedouins who came up to market, and her merchants would languish and die* Was this fair?' 14. Hypocritical t Iraq, with her tongue in her cheek obviously anxious not to spend money on a strong anti- smuggling service in the desert was trying to get His Lajesty T s O-overnment to play her game for her. She was clever at this. She was asking that he, the Shaikh, should TT pQke out his eye with his own finger', 15, It would seem that ^raq developed her plan early in 1903 and through His Majesty's Ambassador, requested that he, the Shaikh, should cooperate to put dom. smuggling which to Kuwait was no smuggling, but merely selling goods legitimately to the Bedouin of the interior^ She asked (a) that he daould place an armed dhow near the Shatt al Arabj (b) that he should accept a customs official in his capital to issue trade permits etc.; (c) that he should patrol his own side of the frontier, with a view to seizing contraband runners. He, the Shaikh, had rejected (a) because he could not afford it, (b) because it was not compatible with his honour and dignity as a sovereign State and (c) because such course would be useless.* He did promise and would again promise to use his good offices towards the prevention of overt aauggling in his capacity of a friendly and neighbouring ruler. Beyond this he could not go. 16. In his opinion it was clearly up to 'Iraq to act K-o-'V' If herself and do her dirty work for her. She bad the following /v. courses open to her and could act any time she chose, but apparently did not so choose (a) To reduce her terrific high import duties on sugar, tea, matches, etc.. (b) To place a chain of customs posts on her frontier along tfeie Batin Valley* (c) To improve and strengthen her sea patrols, round the mouth of the Shatt al Arab.- 6 - (d) To stop the Muntafik tribes from ccming down to Kuwait (especially the riverain ones) and buying cont raband ♦ (e) To stop 'option' cargo gambling by Baghdad and Basra merchants* (f) To employ her own tribes to catch the smuggling as Bin Saud did. 17. 'Iraq had no right whatsoever to ask him, the Shaikh to try and interfere in his own States trade» He was Just as free to encourage his people's trade and attract trade to Kuwait, as 'Iraq herself was#. Just as T Iraq had a right to live her own way, heighten or lower her customs duties without reference to him so he had 1he same right- Though his was a small State he was Just as independent and had Just as many rights as Turkey, Persia and Syria, her neighbours. 18. Were Kuwait under 'Iraq's sovereign control, the matter would have been different entirely, but Kuwait was independent, and neither had 'Iraq the right to bully her or try and force her to restrict her trade with the outer world. Nor (and he said this with every respect) did he think that His Majesty's Ambassador had acted rightly when he had forwarded 'Iraq's proposals of 19S3 (See para 10). He could not have clearly appreciated Kuwait's independent position. 19. He, the Shaikh, earnestly desired to live on good terms with 'Iraq, but in trade matters every state had the right to do the best it coulo. for its own nationals, $ nowhere in the world was this right disputed. were 20. There wae^of course other matters, instance the smuggling of arms, which were on an entirely diff^rei^t^ footing. He, the Shaikh, would be wrong and acting c«p«i- munaliy were he not to assist a sister state in ever^ way possible where the snuggling of munitions of war was con cerned, but this point did not come into the picture. 21. He, the Shaikh, unfortunately believed that- 7 - that 'Iraq, was working to find a pretext for imposing a military blockade, te just as Bin Saud had done. Being weak he could not make war on 'Iraq, at the same time if she acted in this manner (instituted a blockade) it would not be his business to try to teach 'Iraq what was best for her. He could only protest to His Majesty's Government. 22, It was possible that 'Iraq might attempt to 'bring him to so called reason' by making Kuwait water-boats pay a prohibitive port duty at Fao or 1hey might even declare the Shatt al Arab closed to Kuwait to water-boats. If they did this he, the Shaikh, would on the grounds of humanity alone and for the sake of thousands of his poorer inhabi tants have to do his utmost to get His Majesty's Government to interfere. He might be forced to appeal direct to His Majesty King George himself. 23. It was clear, finally added the Shaikh, that this smuggling question was pa^rt and parcel of the political pressure which his neighbour thou^t fit to bring to bear on him. (e.g. the Date Gardens, Revenue and ?ao questions). 'Iraq would never cease her attacks, until Kuwait admitted her suzerainty over her and till this happened was not going to lose a single opportunity of hurting him if she could. It was with the deepest and most sincere regret that he said this, but facts were facts.

Prior to the receipt of that telegram, I had repeatedly advised the Iraqi Government to be as amenable as possible in this matter, and, as you are aware from the notes enclosed in my despatch No. 774, I urged the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take a broad view,' and to regard any discussions that might eventually take place as falling within his province rather than that of the Ministry of Finance. I took this line because, owing to the events of the recent past, I felt that it was improbable that the customs experts on either side would regard the questions at issue in any but a parochial light, and that the discussions, far from producing any agreement, would develop into a fruitless wrangle over recent incidents, the blame for which cannot properly be allocated. I suspect, of course, that there are faults on both sides, and that, owing to uncertainty as to the limits of territorial waters, it is more than probable that the zeal of the Iraqi customs authorities has, at times, led them to take action outside the limits within which they can properly operate. 5. The agenda for the proposed conference to which Nuri Pasha finally agreed was as follows :— (a) Consideration of the proposals put forward by the Iraqi Government for co-operation between Koweit and Iraq for the prevention of smuggling. {b) Boundaries of territorial waters of Koweit and Iraq. (c) Consideration of the practical means of dealing with frontier incidents affecting the Koweitis and Iraqis. {d) Consideration of complaints by either party. This agenda differs slightly from that which I telegraphed to Bushire on the 6th February, and I am explaining the discrepancy in a private letter to Colonel Fowle. 6. Nuri Pasha readily fell in with the suggestions (contained in my despatch No. 84 of the 8th February) which I put forward for the actual procedure to be followed at the conference, and which was devised to produce ^ y ' some sort of written agreement or understanding within the short space of time available. I was anxious that the conference should eschew as far as possible jejune discussion of the regrettable events that had taken place during the past year, and should devote itself to consideration of the means of placing the relations between the two parties on a more satisfactory footing for the future. 7. It was for this reason that I felt it necessary to enlarge the agenda so as to include items other than that relating purely to the dispute over smuggling. It is eminently desirable, for example, that not only should the boundaries of the terntonal waters be finally agreed upon, but that each side should undertake to gi\e the necessary instructions for its nationals and officials to be warned of the dangers attending illegal operations outside the recognised limits. As regards items (c) and (^), it is unfortunately only too apparent that, in the absence of some means of silting the evidence in regard to incidents as and when they occur, it is impossible to arrive at the truth. My object in suggesting these items was, therefore, to secure that some machinery should be set up to enable an impartial linding to be gnen to both sides. I understand that the Iraqi Government had it m mind to suggest that the services of Colonel Ward should be utilised in this connexion, and that any reports which he submitted, after examination of the actual participants in, or witnesses of, incidents should be scrutinised by the British judge at Basra before being communicated to the two Governments. would regard such an arrangement as being most equitable in the circumstances, am the sheikh would, in my opinion, be foolish to refuse it if in fact, it is ever proposed to him. 8. Had the conference taken place on the basis of this agenda, the oppoi unity thus afforded for the sheikh to regularise his relations with the Iraqi Government would have been most favourable, since the intransigent elements on both sides would have been subordinated to what, I hope, would have been the larger view adopted by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs. J. 1 he action of the sheikh in declining to give the necessary authority to his representatives to enter into frank discussion with the Iraqi Government on t le mes suggested now places him, and will, I fear, continue to place him in an unfavourable light. Persistence in his attitude may endanger not only his own peisona interests m Iraq, but also the general interests of his subjects. ^ should not he forgotten that the Iraqi Government are able, if they wish, to cut Uter supply ^ should ji jfld should fattleirmer ij 1 may men ®t to come te the indep Powers, and I was conducted :inference si illy of the tyf If this is i lis own for I ^bthedesi and that Native in In m persu fitatively repre i jentofl famme 1 living, ^ ^ Mn send eb% THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (A rabia ). February 27, 1934. CONFIDENTIAL. S ection 1. [E 1280/669/91] No. 1. Sir F. Humphrys to Sir John Simon.—(Received February 27.) (No. 96.) . t ^ Sir, Bagdad, February 15, 1934. YOU are aware from correspondence beginning with my despatch No. 774 of the 11th December, 1933, and ending with my despatch No. 84 of the 8th February W - last that the Iraqi Government had responded favourably to my suggestions for a conference which was to have taken place in Bagdad on the 15th February with representatives of the Sheikh of Koweit, to devise practical means of preserving law and order in the territorial waters and on the land frontier between Iraq and Koweit. From a further despatch (No. 89 of the 12th February), which will reach, you by this bag, you will observe that it has been found necessary to postpone this conference owing to the refusal of the Sheikh of Koweit to give his representatives the necessary authority to speak and act for him. In these circumstances, I consider it desirable briefly to describe the present position, if only to demonstrate that the task of protecting the sheikh's interests in Iraq, difficult at any time, is made no easier by his present disinclination to come out into the open and meet the Iraqi Government in frank discussion. 2. There can be no doubt that the Koweitis are inveterate and daring smugglers, both by sea and land, and have themselves largely to blame for the blockade which Ibn Saud maintains against them, and for the energetic preventive measures taken by the Persian and Iraqi Governments. So far as this country is concerned, the Director-General of Customs estimates that the annual loss to the Iraqi Treasury resulting from illegal Koweiti activities amounts to no less than £60,000. This figure is disputed by the political agent in Koweit, and I am not in a position to guarantee its accuracy. The control of the Iraqi customs is, however, in the hands of zealous, efficient and conscientious Englishmen, who, I am convinced, would not have taken the extreme measures against Koweiti smugglers that have resulted from time to time in loss of life had they not been satisfied as to their necessity. 3. In September 1932 the Iraqi Government put forward proposals designed to secure the co-operation of the Sheikh of Koweit in the prevention of smuggling. They suggested that before goods were shipped from Koweit to Iraq a permit for each shipment should be obtained. This permit, together with the shipping documents (manifests), should be authenticated by an Iraqi customs official in Koweit, who would be responsible for sending copies of the permit and the shipping documents to the Collector of Customs at Basra, and would inform him of the quantities of goods shipped so that some control could be exercised over the importers. If necessary, the political agent at Koweit could supervise and possibly undertake the duties of the Iraqi official mentioned above. As an alternative, the Iraqi Government suggested the establishment of a combined Iraqi-Koweiti Customs Department to levy customs duty on the basis of the Iraqi tariff, on the understanding that any excess duty over the Koweiti tariff rates in respect of goods consumed in Koweit would be refunded to the sheikh. They also proposed that, in order to watch the movements of boats and dhows, a small steamboat should be stationed at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab. These proposals were placed before the sheikh in March last, but his reply in May was non-committal, and Colonel Fowle was of the opinion that a round-table discussion seemed indicated. The Iraqi Government, who were approached, considered, however, that no good purpose would be served by such discussion until either the sheikh accepted their proposals in principle or put forward satisfactory ones of his own. Their view was that useful discussions could only be conducted on the basis of proposals, the principles of which had been already agreed upon between the two parties. No alternative suggestion had been forth coming from the sheikh, when matters were brought to a head by the incident which formed the subiect of vour telegram No. 354 of the 9th December last.

I may mention in this connexion that recent articles in the vernacular press have drawn attention to smuggling from Koweit, and have urged the Iraqi Government to come to grips with the sheikh. Should this be the first move in a political campaign against him, I cannot help feeling that by his recent action he is playing directly into the hands of those who oppose him here. It seems to me. therefore, that it would be well if a serious warning could be given to the sheikh on the dangers of temporising in a matter which mav prove of vital imoortance tohpl '—x 3 yjl f 11. I gathei from a telegram from tlijg-Political Resident at Bushire of the 26th January last (see my despatch No. 84 of the 8th February last) that it is at present the policy of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to emphasise the independence of the sheikh so far as concerns his relations with foreign Powers, and that, for this reason, Colonel Fowle considers it undesirable that he and the political agent at Koweit should act as the official representatives of the sheikh. I was under the impression that the foreign relations of the sheikh were still conducted through representatives of His Majesty's Grovernment, and that a conference such as that which forms the subject of this despatch was eminently of the type where his representation should be undertaken by British officers. If this is not so, and if it is a fact that henceforth the sheikh is to conduct his own foreign relations, I think it advisable to point out that it has always been the desire of the Iraqi Government to treat directly with the sheikh personally, and that it has only been the mediating influence of His Majesty's representative in Iraq that has prevented them from dealing harshly with him during the past few years. 12. I trust, therefore, that the Political Resident at Bushire will be successful in persuading the sheikh that it is in his best interests to be authoritatively represented by responsible British officers in early conference with the Government of Iraq, and that Colonel Fowle will be fully supported by His Majesty's Government in his efforts. Failing this, I cannot but regard the future with misgiving. 13. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran and to the Honourable the Political Resident at Bushire.

Will you please refer to my telegram No. 9 of the 17th February on the subject of the conference between representa tives of Kuwait and the Iraq Government. I should have preferred to wait for the receipt of the express letter promised in your telegram Ho, 210 of the 20th February, but as the bag goes this morning I am afraid our letters will cross. By this bag you will receive a copy of my despatch No. 96 dated 15th February to the Foreign Office, which sets out the case in detail as we view it from this end. Since that despatch was written, I have received a letter from Nuri Pasha, No. 1168 dated 18th February, a copy of which I enclose. I was most disappointed that it was found necessary to postpone the conference, chiefly because I had prepared the way by several interviews with the Iraqi Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Finance for a discussion which, I think, would have led to an amicable settlement of the complaints ox both parties and a practicable modus vivendi for the future. If A lonourable ieut. -Colonel T. C. W. Fowle, C. B. E. , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R E.was If the conference had taken place as arranged, there every prospect of a settled helng arrived at within two days. Everything has now heen changed by the resignation of the present Cabinet 4. ociomet, and it is most unlikely that either Nun Pasha or Nasrat ai Parisi (the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Finance) will he memhers of the new Government. We therefore have to hegin all over again in a very different atmosphere, and I fear that we shall not be able to hold the conference now for some weeks until the new Ministers have settled down in the saddle. Iraq seems to me to have a real grievance against Kuwait m the matter of smuggling, and I do not deny that Kuwait may have well-founded complaints against the Iraqi customs authorities for the manner in which they sometimes carry out their duties. If the Shaikh is going to take up an intransigent attitude towards the Iraqi complaints about smuggling, there is little doubt that the Iraqis will attempt before long to adopt Ibn Sa'ud's method of treatment i.e. to blockade him and, as Kuwait is dependent upon Iraq for its fresh water supply, the pressmre that might be brought to bear on the Shaikh would be very severe. Hitherto, I suppose, he has relied on the good offices of His Majesty's Government to im from Iraqi reprisals, but he cannot bank on the(copy) MINISTRY FOR POHSIGN AFFAIRS BAGHDAD, IRAQ# No. 1168, Date 18 Feb. 1934. My dear Sir Francis, I have to acknowledge with thanks receipt of your letters Nos. 77 and 87 of 8th and 12th February. We shall look forward to meeting the Kuwaiti representatives in due course. The procedure out lined in your earlier letter seems admirably designed to expedite the work of the Conference. The Iraqi Delegation will be composed with a view to the division of the Conference into two committees. Our representatives on the first committee will be two members of the staff of this Ministry and the Director of the Port of Basra: they will deal with items 2 and 3 of the Revised Agenda. The representatives for the second committee will be nominated by the Ministry of Finance, with a view to dealing with item 1. As regards item 4, it remains to be seen whether any live complaints will best be referred to the machinery set up as tlie result of item 3, or dealt with by the Conference itself. I hope to preside myself over the opening and closing stages of the Conference and will inform you of the final composi tion of our delegation as soon as possible. I attach for convenience of reference a copy of the Agenda as amendedby my letter 741 of 4 February 1934 and should be glad to know if they are agreed to by the Kuwaiti delegation.

May I be permitted, mth very great diffidence and respect, to register a protest against the wording of two telegrams which His Majesty's Ambassador at Baghdad, recently addressed to you on the subject of smuggling from Kuwait. '7 2. I refer to (a) Baghdad telegram No,6, dated the 6th February 1934 v 3s (b) Baghdad telegram No.8, dated the 12th February 19 24, i I copies of which were sent me by you. 3. In the first of these (a) EUM* s Ambassador uses the words 'but if the Shaikh is truculent it will do him no good, he is perhaps even more at the mercy of 'Iraq than of Bin Saud'. In the second (b) H-M's Ambassador uses the words 'I trust that you will make it clear to the Shaikh that it is in the interests of himself and his subjects, to place his relations with 'Iraq on a satisfactory footing, without the least possible delay'. 4. With the deepest respect I would point out that the words used appear to me to have an unnecessary minatory meaning behind them and seem to suggest that H.M's Ambassador has definitely made up his mind that the Shaikh of Kuwait is the sinner in this unfortunate business, while 'Iraq is the innocent pnd injured party. 5. Surely there are two sides to every question, and surely in the present impasse, it would have been more just to have maintained an open mind until the difficulties of both States/ he Hon'ble Lt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, G.B.'E., I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, B U S H I R 3 . / / lStates had been fairly presented and thrashed out at the Conference, 6, I have on several occasions during the past year, attempted to explain, and as recently as the 21st Januarv long 1934 in my/confidential Despatch No.C-36 , I have pointed out that what 1 Iraq condemns and calls 'smuggling', Kuwait considers to be 'fair and legitimate attempt to keep her old and hard won avenues of trade open'. This is the crux of the whole argument, and this is where the whole difficulty lies. Two entirely opposite points of view exist and it surely is up to H.M's iiinbassador to try and understand Kuwaiti point of view as well as ^raq^, before prejudging her, 7, What makes things more difficult is the fact that for sometime past a heavy press campaign has been allowed to go on unchecked in the 'Iraq papers against everything to do with Kuwait, The latter even talk now of the advisability of annex ing the principality,- I mentioned this matter to you when you ■ were here recently, and have sent you several extracts from Baghdad, Basra and other papers to illustrate my meaning. This campaign unfortunately has had the worst possible effect on the Shaikh, and has done more than anything else lately to 'harden his heart' against his northern neighbour. 8, Although it is almost too late now, I suggest for your very careful consideration that H,M 1 s -ambassador might be asked to take definite steps to stop this press campaign, else the consequences may be deplorable indeed, . ® 9, In the meantime and for your information, I am enclosm a table showing imports and exports (sea) into and from Kuwait of sugar, tea, coffee, matches and tobacco, principal articles complained of as being snuggled for the last 12 years* I .icxve obtained these from my annual Trade Reports, which are of course taken from the Customs House figures, 10, If the figures are studied it will be seen that the rather wild accusations of 'Iraq that Kuwait 's imports (for the Purpose of running contraband) have enormously risen in recent- 3 - rccsnt; years, a.pe noi bopne ou't by fscts.

The Shaikh is within his lef;al rights to refuse co-operation as the burden of checking smuggling rests on the country into ^hi ch the smuggled goods are taken. On the other hand if the Shaikh does not co operate the f Iraq Government have various legal methods, stopping the Ifeait water-supply ceing imt , with which they can retaliate. The foiwait-Iraq conference #iich was to have taken place recently in Baghdad did not materialise oxdng to the Shaikh 's refusal to give proper authorisation to his representative. ri he Shaikh has, however, agreed to tighten up his manifests, which if carried out in a way acceptable to the 'Iraq (Joverrsnert chould considerably lessen (if It does net altogether stop) the snuggling by sea, srd it is en the sea an&lt;? not on the land that regrettable incidents have taken place by the action of 'Iraqi Custcxns officials shooting Kuwaiti boatmen. The ne^t step therefore is fbr an ♦Iraqi Customs official, as sugpected by the Shaikh, to visit -uwait for discussion with the Bhai kh on the subject of manifests, ^ith regard to Kuwait being represented at any conference by/ ■-3- item (c). On the land, as far as I know, no fror?+ler incidents affecting Kuwaitis and Iraqis have occurred: such incidents haw been confined to clashes •between the ? Iraqi Cub tows offlclalB and Iraqi srnugfelers. 6 * 71 th regard to the reasons put forward, in para graph 11 of His Excellency the Aahass ado r T s despatch to the effect that a Conference such as the one on sMu^llng was of the type where the Shaikh's representation should be undertaken by ritish officials. My objections to either -olonel '1 clrson or myself or both representing the Shaikh a+ such a Conference are 'based on considerations for the interests of neither Kuwait nor 'Iraq, but for those of His Majesty's Ooveirment . The latter have already a number of comnitnents of varying responsibility with regard to Kuwait affairs. The Date Gardens, concerning which they gave a definite nromise to the 3haikh, is one; Ibn Saud's blockade, concerning which no actual promise was given but certain hopes were heir out, is another; the orotectlon of the whole of the Kuwait Vinci pall ty - Tide India Office despatch ^o» V%.76B3/'r53, dated the 1st February 19 34, to the foreign Office, is a third; while Oil interests re^esent a fourth, I do not imagine that His Majesty's Govern ment, if they can avoid it, wish to take on their shoulders any further responsibilIties with regard to -uwait. At present the Kuwait-'Iraq swligirling Is not such a responsibility. Fis Majesty's Govennnentt: have given promises to neither side, and if Kuwait should suffer by lawful retaliatory measures on the part of the 'Iraq Government , (see paragraph 6 (??) of my ^xnress Letter already/-4- already qpot ed), Fip Majes+y's 0o7emraent are not affected, and the Shaikh roust take the conBequenceB of 'wM ch he has had ample waTnin^-, The situation therefore seems to be one in i7hi cti His Maj esty *s &lt;ToiremF»ent shou restid ct their efforts to ^oo^ offices while thrroselves formally remaining in the hacksrround . I am strongly of opinion therefore that the ^haildi at any corf ere nee or tallc should be represented by his ov-n representative with Colonel ^i d^son or I, or both, present for mirposes of advice, as put forward In ray /' telegram (lTo # B5 of 2f5th JqnunTv 1934) quoted by Sir Francis TT umphrys. If on the contrary Oolonel I^ic^son and I appear as actual representatives of the BhaiMi then it seems inevitable that Tr is Majesty's Government •will assume some dl' ect, ard in my opinion unnecessary, responsibility for the smuggling ouestion, more especially if the conference at which we appear is in any way a failure. In other words there is no need - if I may put It that way - for His Majesty's Government to pick the chestnuts out of the fire for the Shaikh, and -oossibly burn their fingers in oon sequence. 7 » I think It extremely unlikely that the Bhalkh ^111, for the Present anyhow, agree to any conference at Bagdad. If the two parties therefore cannot be hrou^it together at a formal conference, the only alternative is to -oroceed by informal conversations covering the various points at issue stage by stage, and the first step in this direction, ttlch in no way connits the 'Iraq Government to srything, is for an f Iraqi Oustoms official to visit Kuwait for a discussion wit h the Shaikh on/'by Brltl offlcisls: this w Id in ray opinion tend to Hie Majesty's (roverranent directly responsible fbr the Kuwait-Iraq sim^linfr question and thus unnecessarily add to th el r c oraml tiaent s.

I enclose a diatribe on smuggling from Kuwait which appeared in 'A1 Ahali' of March 7th (it is one of several which have appeared lately), from which you will see that we are now getting some of the backlash of the minor press campaign which is heing waged against the Shaikh.

Ijoc al Press Extracts. Wednesday. 7th March, 1934. A1 Ahali. Smuggling in the A Grave Problem. In a leader under the above heading calling attention to the increase of smuggling of goods into Southern Irac. from Kuwait and calling upon the Government to adopt effective measures for the suppression of this illicit traffic, the editor writes 'A point that arrests attention in connection with smuggling from Kuwait is that all, or at least most of the goods so smuggled ape British goods. Those who know assert that certain foreign icials in /.on,ait and a section of native Kuwaiti officials who are under the control of the British have a large hand in this affair. This goes to show that it is the intense competition that British goods are facing in Iraci that has induced these (? foreign and native officials in Kuwait) to act in this manner. Foreign (other than British) goods, particularly those of Japan, are placed in the markets of Iraq at very cheap prices, and have almost ousted aritish home and colonial goods from our markets. Therefore the promoters of trade in British goods have resorted to smuggling these goods in order to evade payment of customs duty thereon and thereby enable their placement in the market at competitive prices. Reports received from our correspondents in the South indie- ate tilat a secret hand is directing this smuggling, for the bands 0 f smugglers are properly organized and are running their traffic 'ethodically. Their number is very large, and if this traffic ntinued it would constitute a serious economic danger to this country. » After referring to recent orders issued by the Iraqi Govern- [ er it fop the strengthening of customs control posts on the Iragi- fiwaiti frontier, the editor v/rites: /'We do not consider this alone to be adequate for the purpose. The Government should go into the very foundation of the problem, study it carefully and in detail, and so act as to induce the British authorities in Kuwait to exercise control in order that no more facilities should be left in Kuwait for smuggling.

Unofficial visit of the Llutasarrif, Basra, to lluwar Sir , I have the honour to inform you that Monday, 26th March was observed as the *12 al Haj (or sacrifice) in Kuwait, and the 26th, 27th and 28th were observed as public Holidays here and in Basra. 2, On 26th March His Excellency the Mutasarrif of Basra, Tahsin Beg All, accompanied by the following members of his staff, visited Kuwait in an entirely unofficial am private capacity: (a) Doctor Ibrahim ^kif Alius!, Director of Health, Basra: (b) Sami Beg, Accountant General, Basra: (c) Abdul Wahab al iMaama, Deputy Controller of Customs. (d) iibdul Jabbar Khudairi , prominent merchant. (e) Nuri Thabit, Editor and Proprietor of the Comic Paper ^Habz-Booz'. 5» The Mutasarrif and (b) and (c) were accommodated at Dasman, the Shaikh r s private residence, while (d) and (e) stayed with a leading merchant known as ibn Bahar. 4 # The party were conducted to Kuwait by Mr .Gabriel, His lUxcellency the Shaikh* s lawyer in Basra, who apparently is on very friendly terms with the present Mutasarrif. 5. The Shaikh himself, who is nm in camp at Eaweli (7 miles away) came in daily to see how his quests were fa/r ing.h \ 6. The Kutasarrif and party left for Basra again on 28th March at mid.—day, -lie Shaikh told me that he did not invite the Mutasarvr if or any of his party down to Kuwait, nor cli d he know the Mutasarrif previously. Air that happened was that the Mutasarrif taking advantage of the f ID Holidays, got Mr .Gabriel to enquire privately from the Shaikh, if he could run down and see Kuwait for two nights in ^ a strictly private capaciuy'. The ohaikh by verbal message through Mr.Gabriel conveyed his readiness to give an Arab welcome to such a distinguished visitor, but requested that he should come in a private capacity. The matter was accordingly arranged on Monday and the guests arrived on Tuesday. 8. Juring the Mutasarrif t s two days stay in Kuwait, friendly calls were exchanged between him and myself. ^ 9, The Mutasarrif apparently, took very great pains to make himselT agreeable, and the Shaikh from being on his guard and very suspicious at first, told me with enthusiasm, last night (£8.3.54) , (when I had him to dinner to meet the Imeri can Minister) that his guest had been so delighted with his visit and with the Arab hospitality accorded to him by the people of Kuwait , that in a parting speech he had expressed profound astonishment that his own countrymen and in particular the r Iraq papers had been carrying on such a pernicious and libellous campaign against fellow Arabs like the people of Kuwait and © their Shaikh, as they had been during recent months. \ 10. According to the Shaikh, the Mutasarrif in the presence of all his Staff, gravely told him (the Shaikh) that in his opinion the 'smuggling' accusations that had been levelled against Kuwait by all and sundry in T Iraq were 'wild' and grossly unfair^to the Amir of Kuwait and his people, and that the re^l fault lay with his own Government in t Iraq, for not reducing the Customs tari s to— o — to a reasonable and decent figure» The Mutasarrif T s above remarks were cordially endorsed, added Hie Shaikh, by the members of his Staff, who also condemned their country's methods towards Kuwait, 'whose Ruler was one of the noblest of Arab Amirs and had done mucn for the cause of Arabs in the past' (their words). 11 o 1 myself ?/as impressed by the Mutasarrif r s treat ment o.. the bhaikh, and by the keen interest he showed in Desert and other matters, when he called on me. (He spent a full hour in my house), 1^*• -i'loa^h 1 tnink the dhaikh takes rather a too optimistic view of the impression he and his people made on the Governor of Basra, there can be no doubt that the visi uors enjoyed their stay here and carried back with them greatly changed views on their host and his difficulties, ihi s is indeed a±l to the good, and. is after all i/ihat the Shaikh has all along been trying to make 'Iraqis see. 13. The fact that in discussing 'Iraq's smuggling ac- 0 cusations against Kuwait, the Hutasarrif and Staff expressed 1 the opinions they did, shows that urnny right thinking men in 'Iraq believe their country to be in the wrong in this matter and Kuwait to be the injured party. This is significant and proves what the Shaikh has always maintained, namely that if only one can get prominent 'Iraqis to ccme and see his side of the picture, they would have a different tale to tell in Baghdad. These, of course, are my views also. 14. Before their return home, the ITutasarrif and his entourage bought several automatic revolvers, with ammunition also quantities of Jau de Cologne, which only a few days previously I had warned the Shaikh to be most careful about and see that they did not go into 'Iraq as contrabands Sven kutasarrifs can smuggle, it seems, on occasion. 15.

March, Mr .Edmonds, Adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Baghdad accompanied by Colonel Ward, C.M.G., C.I.E., etc., . ort director, Basra, flew down to Kuwait by Jastbound. air mail, and returned again to T Iraq on Friday 2Srd March also by air. 2. Mr.Lomonds stayed with me whilst in Kuwait and Colonel ./ard with Mr, Chisholm of the A.P.O.C. 3. Beyond receiving a telegram from Mr ..Edmonds on the 21st asking me to put him up, 1 had no idea that the above 'Iraq officials had any intention of coming here, nor did I know what their business was. 4. iilthou^i both m * Mr .Edmonds and Colonel ward assured me that their visit was purely 'private', from subsequent talks, and putting two and two together, it is clear, I think, that they came to make personal and private investigations into the smuggling activities of 1 Iraqi xaerchants and their confederates, the tribes on the Euphrates, 5. As Kuwait has nothing at all to hide, I took pains to explain to Mr.Edmonds in several lengthy talks, thebetween the two States, which the Shaikh above all persons^ is so anxious to maintain. o. 1 'i-ink I was able to tell fc*Edmonds, several things about the smuggling trade generally and in particular about the guilty activities of the T Iraq tribes themselves, whicxi he did not know before. I hope also that I was able to convince him that the people of Kuwait did no snuggling themselves at all on the land side, and that by sea only a very small percentage of the fishing community went in for the game, V. Mr. Edmonds appeared surprised, I think, at my statement that the smuggling fraternity whether engaged in the contraband running to Persia, Saudi Arabia, or 'Iraq were in 98 cases out of 100, nationals of those countries. 8. I gathered from Mr.Edmonds that before visiting Kuwait, he hada^ready been up the Khor Abdulla (to its head) with Colonel V/ard, and had also visited the Southern T Iraq desert, west of the fT Batin ?T valley, so the presumption is that both were engaged on some scheme^ whereby * Iraq could bring effective measures to bear on their own nationals engaged in the smuggling business. This is all to the good of course. 9. .Whilst I am, and shall always be, only too delight ed to furnish information on such things as 'smuggling fr etc to /distinguished persons like Mr .Edmonds and Colonel v /ard, I should prefer, if possible, that they let me know sometime beforehand Y /hen they wished to visit Kuwait, It will be easier for me to prepare them a proper welcome etc. 10» I think it not unlikely in the present case, that the visits of the Mutasarrif, Basra (reported elsewhere) and of Colonel Ward and Mr .Edmonds, were in some way connected. 11.

V 'v ^4&gt; In continuation of my telegram No. 174, dated the 15th May 1934, I have the honour to forward translation of an official communication from H .S. the Shaikh, No. R4/1506, dated the 14th May 1934 to my address, ¥/hich ( speaks for itself. ^ 2. You will recollect that when you were in Kuwait recently I mentioned on the 10th of May that I had received a disturbing report frcm Bedouin of the visits of certain * Iraqi armed cars the previous day, and in your presence the same evening I told the Shaikh, who said that he had also heard the news and was sending out a special party by car to investigate the truth of the report. This party apparently went out at dawn on 11th May and returned to Kuwait on the night of the 13th May and was under the com- / mand of an excellent and trustworthy Shammar tribal officer called MIR3HID. 3. The Shaikh, who as usual is rather bad at writing a clear report, obtained the material for his letter to me from his officer MIHSHID, and in order that I might get hold of the full facts, he sent tie man round personally with the letter with instructions to give me a verbal account of what the party had seen and heard. 4. I may mention in passing that Mirshid is a reliable10/- reliable Bedouin of good family, who has held responsible posts (a) under Captain Glubb, R.E., late officer in charge of the southern 'Iraq desert Police, (b) with an ii.ii.F,armoured car column during the Akhwan rebellion of 1929-30; (c) with Captain Papworth during the H.A.F. survey operations of 1932-53. 5, r.iirshid's statement to myself is forwarded with this letter together with a sketch map which I have made to enaole you to recognize place names at a glance. 6. As you will see from Mirshid's report the portion of iluwait territoiy which has received the attention of the 'Iraqi armed cars is the lonely area lying-tthe north west of the State, and bounded by the Jahara -SafY /an Road, the Jalal Liyah- cum-IDAIRAT ridges ani the BAT IN Valley. 7. I trust that as a result of my telegram referred to at the beginning of this report, you were able to lodge the necessary protest to the 'Iraq Government on behalf of His Excellency the Shaikh at this rather uncalled for series of incursions into Kuwait territory, and that as a result orders will be issued to the Commandant of the 4 cars which have recently been posted at Safwan forbidding him to cross the Kuwait border again. 8. The armed cars in question number four, and were brought to Jafwan, I believe, early in May. One of them is equipped with a wireless set and the others doubtless have receiving sets, but I cannot be sure of this. All are under the command of an officer named Saleh al Safwa» 9. Doubtless their transference to the northern bor der of Kuwait forms part of the 'Iraq G -ovemments laudable anti-snuggling programme, bilit it should not be too much to expect their commandant to confine his attentions to the territory lying west of the ^atin .repression and outside Kuwait territory generally.' ii ' 1 s:.; ^ t? 4 10. viftiile it is gratifying to see the ^raq Government at last taking energetic anti~smuggling measures by land (whicli have long been advocated by me) the least that one can expect is that these measures are taken in ^raq territory. 11, : or the rest, the personnel o? the armed cars apparently consist of T Iraq Desert Police and are not tf 'Customs Preventive Officers''.

Hence it became necessary that we should send out a car to verify the same . A car was therefore sent out with a couple of our servants in charge of one Mirshid ash-Shammari, They were ordered to proceed and carry out a careful patrol to the North keeping within the territory of Kuwait • reached Raudhatain and turned to Um-al~Madafi 1 , whete they found a party of Kuwaiti tribesmen, whom they asked about the abovementioned armoured cars, and from whom they got the information that these cars had visited than daily* One Walad (the son of) Radhi as-Sumairi , a Kuwait tribesman camped there, informed the party that the said cars last came to them on Friday on 27th Muharram (11th May 1934) and had searched their tents, and that when they (the Kuwaiti tribesmen) protested against the search by those ♦Iraqis of their tents, the latter struck one of them with a stick. Further, according to the report of tribesmen camped north of the Liyah ridge and the ±dair T at ridge, the f Iraqi armed cars pass them regularly and proceed southward (and westward)• The moving about of ♦ Iraqi armed cars in Kuwait territory and their interfering with our tribes, has, therefore, been oonfirmed. This, of course, is a question that we can never overlook, for we do not like that anything disturbing to existing good relations and inconsistent with the rights of adjoining States should ever occur betvfeen- 2 - x,o^ between us and our neighbours. We have ordered our servant Mirshid ash-Shammari to report to you personally to inform you of all the verifications he had made.

His Uixcellency the Shaikh ordered me to proceed to the north of Kuwait State by oar accompanied by 2 M Fidawis n (members of Shaikh's bodyguard) on 11th Ilay* His instructions to me were that I should visit the various camps of Kuwait Bedouin situate in the north west corner of Kuwait State, and find out by process of enquiry etc if any ' Iraqi armed cars had been seen moving about by night or day in Kuwait territory* The following was the result of my tour of in vestigation: (a) I proceeded from Jahara to Rauthatain on the Basra road on 11th May, and from there moved west to Um al Madafa. The Bedouin camped there all confirmed that 2 and at other times 5 cars, armed Desert Police constables had on at least 7 occa sions since 1st Hay passed their camps ano. had gone in a southerly direction, (b) At one tent at which I made enquiry, the owner, a person named Hohamed the son of Rathi al Sumairi (sana) complained that as he and his women folk were changing camp^ (they had been stopped and searched near the iJoata, and because had protested he had been abused and (c) On the 12th May i learned from a Kuwait AraibdaY/i by name Samil al Sirbil that his tents had been visited 4 days previously by 4 armed cars wilh 2 Lewis guns apiece and manned by T lraq0i struck wi 1ii a cane. This was on the May. and that he , his women, and his tents had all been searched. They had not been maltreated in anyway. (d) On the same date (12th Hay) i visited the\ i - 2 - o visited the camp of the Amir of the Shaikh of .oiwait t s Pidaiviyeh, Haif bin Hajraf, who with some 40 tents was camped between Um al Madafa and EAXMk . The xkmir reported that the armed cars had been seen moving about on at least 7 occasions during the previous 10 days, and that on one occasion they had visited his camp and he (the Amir) had given them coffee and entertained them generally» further that the conroandant had been very friendly, and had implied to him that his presence in Kuwait was by the Shaikh's sanc tion and approval, and that t Iraq and Kuwait were working in friendly cooperation in their joint efforts to stop smuggling. (e) On the same day I visited Ifarhan ibn Khadaiyir's (Kuwait Mutairi) camp, 10 miles north of Um Ruaisat, and was told that 2 'Iraq cars had visited him two days previously and that the crew had drunk coffee Y /ith him, (f) On the 13th May I visited the Al Diyahin section of the Mutair (Kuwait subjects) near Hauma and learned that they had also seen 2 armed cars manned by 'Iraq Desert Police going south west on 10 th May and later in the day had seen them going north again. (g) I returned to the A Rauthatain again on the 13th prior to proceeding back to Kuwait, and met two 'Iraq Desert Police constables grazing their camps ^ there. I knew thou personally, and in a friendly talk they told me that the name of the officer commanding the 4 'Iraqi cars, was Saleh al Safwa. They also told me the names of the crews but I can only remember five of these, They were r Raddad al Laaibi {Azayad tribe)Ibrahim al Maih (Anaze tribe) Ghachan ibn G -ubeh( Juareen tribe) (Brother of the Shaikh of the Juareen) Mans in? al Ajmi (known as ibn al Marriyeh).

Sir, I have the honour to forward English translations of the following letter and enclosures which I received on 15th May last from His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait; (a) Letter No.R4/l507, dated the 30th Muharram 1353(14.5.34) from the Shaikh of Kuwait to H.M's Political Agent; (b) Statement A' made by Kakhuda Ghanim bin Mohamed, a Kuwait subject to H.E.the Shaikh; (c) Statement n B Tt made by Nakhuda Hussain bin Mohammed, a Kuwait subject, to H.S.the Shaikh. 2. The letter and enclosure$ speak for themselves, and I think afford sufficient proof that the 'Iraq Customs armed launch from Fao has once again violated Kuwait territorial waters, though in still more serious manner than on the previous occasion, when it operated on and off for a period of some seven days between Maschan Island and Subiyeh village at the entrance of the Khor Subiyeh. (In this connection see my telegram No.23^, dated the 1st October 1933 and my despatch No.245, d^ed the 11th October 1933). ^ 3. You will doubtless observe from the sketch maps 'A' and ,T B Tt which I append for convenience of reference, that n Al Kaghasil n and f 'Al Tha'alib', the localities op posite which the Kuwait v/oodcutters craft were held up and fired on, lie at the northern end, and centre respective -ly of the Khor Subiyeh, a purely Kuwait estuary approxi mately/it ioa filllo 3;1 di::;; i$ i dsch' i 1 no b'-'- jo s-- 1 j# 'ygo ' i* approximately 45 miles long and ly miles wide, I have personally visited both places, more than one occasion, and can testify as to correctness of position etc., Neither is a village or hamlet as one might suppose, but both are well known areas, lying along the shore of the mainland, where the 'Turfa' bush, an excellent firewood and much valued in Kuwait, grows in profusion. 4. If you will refer to Section No.6 of the Government publication 'Treaties and Agreements between the British Government and certain Arab Rulers' for year 1926 and the map which faces page 22, it will clearly be seen that the boundary between 'Iraq and Kuwait places the Islands of WARBA and Bubiyan, as well as the whole of the Ehor Subiyeh within Kuwait territory, 5. There is another small island lying south-west of Warba and shown on my sketch fir B n which also lies within Kuwait territory, mention of which I venture to make here as it has recently been rumoured that the T Iraq Government intended to establish a Police post on it. 6. For the rest, I might mention that both the 'Ballan' and the 'Jolly Boat' referred to by the Shaikh as having been fired on are very small crait, scarcely •0 ft. in length , with a total ere?/ of 3 men each including the Nakhudas Some 15 of these craft are permanently engaged in bringing firewood (especially the Turfa bush mentioned above) frcm the region of the Khor Subiyeh to Kuwait. The boats are owned by the very poorest of the townsfolk and the profits made are small indeed, seeing that a weeks round trip usually ends in the boats cargo of firewood being sold for a total of Hs.6/- to Rs.8/-. 7. I have myself personally examined the Nakhuda of one of the boats fired on (B), and I find it hard to believe/ ■- 3 - ^ 'v '5&gt; believe him to have been guilty of trying to smuggle goods into 'Iraq, for a more miserable specimen of humanity I have rarely seen. His boat as you will see, from his statement, was the one seized and tal®n off to Fao as a prize. The other boat (B) was given back to the owner because from the Nakhuda T s own statenent , certain small leaves and twigs were found in the bottom of the boat which fact was considered to have proved his innocence. The Commander of the motor boat, however, was apparently not above robbing the unfortunate crew of their bread. Probably we shall be told that the seized empty boat, contained grains of sugar strewn over the floor. 8, The point I wish to emphasize in reporting this matter, is of course not so much the question as to whether the two boats were or were not engaged in smuggling as the fact that an armed * Iraqi launch was operating and firing on sailing craft, in the Ivhor Subiyeh entirely outside its legitimate sphere of operations. The launch would appear to have come up the IChor Abdulla, rounded Bubiyan Island from the northern aid and moved south again down liie Khor Subiyeh. 9, I confess to being not a little puzzled as to why the 'Iraq authorities, after several months of quiescence and 'playing fair' should once again permit their ?ao armed launch to 'break the rules of the game'. I can only suppose that some new official has been oent to Fao who wishes to ^ acquire merit and favour by show ing extra vigorous activity, or that the Central Government does not properly inform its provincial officials of how the Kuwait-'Iraq frontier line runs. This latter appears to be the most likely answer in view also of the curiously and almost simultaneous incursions into ICuwait territory of 4 armed cars fron the North, reported in my Confidential -No.C-180, dated the 16th May 1924. 10, X trust that you will see your way to make early and vigorous representations on behalf of His Exoell y'ioisi i i33; His —iXCGll©ncy 'th© bhsii Jh oi ii-uwait; 'to tiiG t Ir0.Q_ G-ovsmiiiGii't, at the above fresh violation of her territorial waters, and will ask that the Fao customs launch be forbidden in future to enter the IChor Subiyeh either from its northern or southern end. 11. point which might strike you, is the late re porting of the above two incidents (A) and (B) by the Shaikh, which as you will doubtless have noticed, happened on the 18th and 20th April 1934, respectively. The Shaikh tells me that he himself only heard the story on 8th May, and then as a rumour only. It took him frcm 8th to the 14th to get hold of the llakhudas concerned and get their evidence. According to the Shaikh, both men pleaded the usual stoiy as to why they kept their ,f mouths shut'. They said they were poor men aigaged in earning a few rupees each voyage, and they were afraid to come and tell their story, they feared they would be locked up, or at least kept in Kuwait pending the rulers pleasure. This, as breadwinners, they could not afford. They thought it wisest to keep silence. The above attitude of mind is all too common, I fear, among the local Arab, which makes the. obtaining of evidence almost impossible.

I should further request that you will kindly represent both of the abovementioned cases to the authorities concerned, with the request that they take serious steps to prevent the occurrence of such oft-repeated aggressions and infringements, which are wholly inconsis tent with the rights and privileges of good neighbours• n *Note by H.l^s Political ^ent. tp or position of Maghasil and Tha^lib, see sketch map w A n marked in red ink «'a' y% Translation of a statement made by nakhuda G-hanim bin Muhammad, a Kuwait subject on 29th Muharram 1353 (13.5.34). Leaving Kuwait in our 'Balam' on the 3rd Muharram 1353 (17»4,34) lite arrived at the ' Maghasil n (in IQior-as- Subiyeh) very early next morning. After sunrise the Fao customs motor boat came upon us and started firing at us at long range. It fired ei^Sat shots and then ceased, 7 /e fearing lest fire would be opened again and that seme of us might be killed, set sail and proceeded to?fards the motor boat. When we drew near, shouts, with much abuse and ugly names greeted us. The launch then drew up to us, cast anchor and stopped, lie aide did the same, V/e noticed seven men carrying rifles in the motor boat. On asking the reason why they had fired on us, and vhj they abused us, their attitude became worse. They shouted that we had sugar on board, and we asked them to come and search our boat. They came alongside and two of them, one Saiyid Ibrahim by name, who, I believe, was their leader, and another one, Abdur Rasul, boarded our boat. —ie\ searched her thoroughly and saw nothing but small chips and leaves of firewood (the remains of our last voyage) and also that our boat was old and leaky. Satisfying themselves they gave us permission to go wherever v/e liked, but asked us if we could tell them of boats carrying sugar on board. To this I replied that I was a poor woodcutter and knev/ nothing about any such boa us, vastly, they opened a small box which we had, and took our bread which we had kept inside.

The cars v/ere moving fast in a southerly direction. 2, Mr. Chi shorn on reaching Safwan frontier post, asked a Desert Policeman on guard, hew it was that Iraq armed cars were working in Kuwait territory, when there was a sir^- V* board as big as lifeclose the post, marking the Kuwait boundary. The man according to Mr. Ghisholm, answered with a la-ugh that Kuwait had no territory, outside Kuwait Town, a rather significant reply from a plain policeman« 3. Mr.Chisholm further stated that on his return jour ney to Kuwait on 23rd May, he again stopped at oafwan. post and this time found 5 Iraq Government lorries there, three of which had Lewis Guns mounted on them. He also met the Commandant of the Detachment, Saleh bin Safwa, ( doo paraS of my Despatch G-180 of 16th May 1934) who he described as a pleasant speaking man. Mr.Chisholm casually asked this individual if he knew where the Kuwait boundary began and he replied, n Yes, at that large signboard over there'. Note/ ( vv ^nqt2. -&gt; The signboard indicated was erected some years ago by the ohaikh of Kuwait and had the writing on it renewed 2 years ago at my suggestion. It bears tte following inscription in Arabic and English: ^KUWAIT FRONTIER' rt ileep to the left ?t . kr•Ghisholm. then asked the officer if his cars ever crossed the frontier in search of anugglers and the reply came, 'No, never', 4. On 25rd May Shaikh Han tush al Suwait of the Dhafir visited me frcm his camp on the west side of the Batin, beyond Athaiba and Huhail, and although at first he was averse to giving me information, after persuasion, admitted that five days previously y /hen he came up to Kuwait, he had seen four Iraqi armed cars north-west of the IDAIRAT. He added that the cars had been regularly searching Kuwait territory west of the Basra road and everyone knew about their activities, 5. In conclusion I enclose a translation of a second letter from H.S.the Shaikh, ITo*R/4/l512, dated 19th Hay 19S4 with enclosure, protesting against these continued incursions of the Iraq armed cars, and requesting that the authorities concerned be asked urgently to forbid such acts lest a regrettable incident occur. 6. Regarding the statement of Abdulla al Sumairi, forwarded as enclosure t o the Shaikh's letter, I will confine myself to making the following observations only: (i) The man Abdulla al Sumairi is the brother of Mohamed the son of Rathi al Sumiri (See Statement of Mirshid al Shammari in sub-para. v (b) forwarded with my report G.180 of 16th i 5° ^ I.iay 1934) whose camels were stopped on 11th May as he was changing camp with his women folk. (ii) The search now complained of v/as made on 14th May, so his and his brothers tents which5 n yo which were together were visited twice by the Iraqi cars, with an interval of 2. days bet ween vi sit s. (iii)Tents were surrounded and guns trained on an unfortunate lot of women and children. (iv) No so called contraband^ was found after search on either occasion as far as I am aware. (v) The man Abdullah al Sumairi and his brother are Kuwait subjects of poor but very respect able family and with their father are well- kncwn to me . (vi) The e^uiry js? the cars crew for 'Mirshid', the Shaikh T s officer who on 11th May visited Al Summiri's tents, on his tour of enquiry, is significant. 7, I would suggest for your consideration that with your request that the Iraq G -overnment should immediately forbid their Police cars crossing the froitier, they (the Iraq Government) be^ invited to furnish an explanation of the circumstances under which such incursions have been made. 8. In this connection, I recollect that 2-o years ago when some Kuwait cars accidentally crossed the western boundary of Kuwait for a distance of la miles, in pursuit of a murderer, tlie Shaikh was the first to admit his men's mistake, and offered a most handsome apology to the Iraq Gov ernment.

After compliments, Reference our letter No. R/4/1506, dated the 30th Muharram 1353 (14-5-34) regarding the f Iraq Governments cars which crossed the frontier into Kuwait, we are sending herewith a statement of a Kuwait subject whose name is 'Abdullah as-Sumairi, from which you will be able to see what is happening as a result of the operations of these cars within the Kuwait Frontiers. We shall, therefore, be pleased if you will be so good as to refer the matter urgently to the authorities concerned with a view to put a stop to such incursions, because we fear that some misunderstanding may happen as a result of their wandering about within our borders, which we are anxious to avoid.

Para 2 of letter to Baghdad,No.E 6535/6054/ 91 ,d/-29/12/32, wtach gives a sumnary of the policy of H.M.Gr, in respect of Kuwait. The ^shaikh himself is apprehensive of encroachment 'by Iraq, and is not likely to agree to the proposals of the Iraq. G-overnment in their present form. On the other hand he has large interests in Iraq in his date gardens and might like to co-operate with Iraq in this, matter on that account. % \ In any case there would appear to 'be no harm in putting the proposals of the Iraq Govt, to the Shaikh, who would prohahly suggest counter- proposals. If you concur, a copy of Embassy letter No.20, d/ 31/3/33, may 'be forwarded to the P.A., Kuwait, with a request that, if he sees no objection, the proposals of the Iraq G -ovt. may 'be communicated if to the Shaikh for his views. P.A. may also 'be asked to furnish his own views. i? - /*/&lt;, a i'I I I thinic that P. A.

I know you will do your best to bring the Shaikh to a reasonable frame of mind, and you can count on me to do anything I can to secure a fair deal for him with the Iraq Govermaent.

'4. •■&gt;&lt;? /t*. c-&lt;- itwee] P.S&gt; You will see that the agenda as finally agreed between Nuri Pasha and myself differs slightly from that which I tele graphed to you in February. This is due to the desire of the Iraqi Government to avoid as far as possible a barren argument of the particular complaint mentioned in item 3 as telegraphed to you and to include it in item 4 with a view to arrive at practical- 4 - practical measures for dealing with all general complaints as distinct from isolated incidents. My telegram of February 6th was sent off under a slight misapprehension. You will, I am sure, agree that the agenda as finally proposed is preferable and most likely to attain the object proposed. I ought to add that it will not now be possible to convene the Gonierence until after March 6th owing to the absence of the Iraqi Director of Customs on a tour of inspection. ; J</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001f8_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/531</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0001f8</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/531</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 53/83 I (D 99) Kuwait-Iraq Smuggling'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1933/1934</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-08-28T10:57:36</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (355 folios)</extent><extent>File is arranged in chronological order, from earliest at beginning of the file to most recent at end.Serial numbers in red crayon refer to entries in the notes at the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Condition: A bound correspondence volume.Foliation: The file's foliation is written in pencil, in the top right corner of the recto of each folio.
