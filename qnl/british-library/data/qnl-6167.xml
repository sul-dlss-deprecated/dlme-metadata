In any case extradition treaties do not normally provide for the surrender of the property of a criminal, but only of persons charged with the commission of crimes. Our Legal Advisers point out that no State is obliged under international law or practice to enforce the penal laws of another State or to give effect to the sentences of the courts of another State in penal matters. m he practice o f the United Kingdom and of many other countries is not to enforce the penal laws of foreign countries nor to give effect to the sentences of their courts. It is therefore perfectly open to the Kuwaiti authorities to decline to return the cars to Iraq.

I am in favour of this proposal myself anu have consulted H.M. 's lanb^ssy at hagna&amp;a who say they can see every advantage in Ine negotiation of such a treaty. 2.
