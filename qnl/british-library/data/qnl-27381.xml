Sir, Your most obedient servant, sd. h. Weigntman. Officiating Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf. ♦ sent under Printed letter Ho.0/552 of tne 21st August 193d.Th« Honourable the Political Resident In the Persian Gulf* C/C Poetmaeter f Karachi* I have the honour to say that It la becoming more and more urgent to undertake eorae legislation for the li censing 9 registration and control of motor drivers and their vehicles in Bahrain* Accidents have been distressingly fre quent and there have been several deaths* In Bahrain there are considerably more f oreign than native owners and drivers f and the regulations so far operated by the Bahrain Government have been of no legal value for the control of such foreign ers* Hitherto the Political Agent had had to rely solely on the provisions of the Indian Penal Code f which 9 while adequate for the punishment of rash and negligent driving, are value less for »ny real control or for the devising of precau tionary men mires. 2 * I had at first thought of sug eating the application of the Indian Motor Vehicles Act together with a Motor Vehi cles Tax Act and rules under both Acts, but after Air the r examination I have come to the conclusion that this would be unnecessarily cumbersome and that it might raise diffi culties in ensuring identical legislation by the Bahrain Government for their owh oubjeots* I am now of the opinion that the simplest method is to draft a Klng f s Regulation, utilising/-2 - utlllalng the preoodente in procedure of 'The Poeeeeaion an} Traffic in Anas regulation 1936' and 'The Bahrain ).«« regard ing the Ownership of hnaovable Property in Bahrain by Foreign ers Regulation 1937'. The sohoduls to this Klim's Regulation would b e a Proclamation issued by the Bahrain Oovamnent and I eufcmit herewith drafts of both* The basis for the draft iagulotion is the 'effective' part of the Indian itotor Vehicles •ct, and it will b« oreserved that the dra t ^gulation ;tnd the Schedule provide for rules to bs mads by thi Political Agent and the Bahrain Government respectively. 3. I have been in consultation with the Bahrain Govarnment on tliia matter, * 1*1 they are in agreameht with me in consider*, ing that the proposed action is necessary and accept the draft Proclamation. I have further drafted a aet of rules, again in consultation with the Bahrain Government, and these dra t rules are attached herewith for information. I enclose ^Iso a copy of a letter No. P/3/57 dated the 31st Ame 1938 from the Cobh tuand&amp;nt, 3tate Police, Bahrain (in the absence of the Adviser on leave) making an official request that action should bs taken on the lines ind ented above. 4. It may bs c onsldered that the provision in the draft regulation that rules should be framed by the Political Agent implies too great a devolution of power to ths Political *gont, but I suggest that this is preferable to overlo ding the King's regulation or its sche&amp;il* with detailed rules which may require revision from time to time, «*eh such revision in* volving a revised fing**! Regulation. By the action taken the convention has jean established that Agency and Bahrain Govern, mant rules should be drafted in concert by ths Political gent end the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, end from the draft rules themselvss it will bs seen that such roles sre infect (and will continue to be) based on similar rules in fores in India or elsewhere in ths British fimpirs.5. I request therefore that, if you approve, His Majes ty's loverrunent may be moved to sanction the issue of a King's Regulation with a schedule on the lines suggested at the earliest possible date* The matter ie of some ur gency in order to ensure that the present lock of control over motor drivers and owners of motor vehicles should not be allowed to continue* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/ H.
