April 17, 1896. CONFIDENTIAL. (6765.) Memorandum on the Persian Situation. SIR M. DURAND’S Memorandum displays a deplorable condition of things in Persia, but not one that can excite any surprise in those who have visited the country, or have studied the ques tion for anv length of time. Persia, so long as it remains under the present Shah, is incurably rotten, and there is not one of his sons who would not, in all probability, be a change for the worse. Patching up so crazy a vessel is an almost hopeless attempt. Sooner or later it will founder. Only as it has some useful timbers and a valuable cargo, there will be salvage worth looking after. The following seems to me to be the points of main importance suggested by Sir M. Durand’s Memorandum:— 1. What to do when the Shah dies .—Two years ago he as nearly as possible expired, and the rumour of his death was spread in Tehran; and yet it would scarcely he believed that our Legation was not only without instructions of any kind, but had (if I have been correctly informed) no plan of action or idea whatsoever, but was prepared simply to wait and see what might turn up. Both Russia and England have agreed to recog nize the Valiahd as the legitimate heir, and as the least objectionable of the sons. But I have always thought that in the event of the Shah’s sudden death, it would be well for the British Minister at Tehran to have instructions in advance to communicate with his Russian colleague as to the steps to be taken to insure a peaceful succession. No other Power is greatly interested or would claim to take a hand. We do not want the Valiahd to ride down from Tabriz with an escort of Russian soldiers (in the same way as we our selves brought down Mohammed Shah in 1835), and to be installed as Shah under Russian auspices, which would almost certainly happen if one of the [394] B2 ■■■■■■ i! I ■ other Princes made a move in Tehran, and if we to stand aloof. Can there be any objection to Sir N. O’Conor mentioning to Prince Lobunow in the course of a friendly conversation about Persia, our willingness to co-operate with Russia in the event of the death of the Shah, or to our Minister at Tehran receiving general instructions which would enable him to act should the emergency occur? It might even be well for the British Consul at Tabriz to accompany the new Shah in such a case, as the Russian would almost certainly do on his own account. 2. But there is another point on which Sir M. Durand is all but silent. If the Valiahd dies, as is very likely, before his father (he has Bright’s disease), who is to be the heir ? The Zii-es-Sultan is treacherous and brutal, though crafty and resolute. The Naib-es-Sultaneh is cowardly and incompetent. They hate each other, and'each might endeavour to strike for the throne. But the \ ahahd has a son, already grown up, whom I have heard favourably spoken of. In an analogous case earlier in the century when Abbas Alirza, who was Crown Prince, died in 1833, his elder son became heir-apparent in his place, and succeeded his grand father, Path Ali Shah, a little later. Could not Sir M. Durand ascertain something about this young man—his character and inclinations, his position at Court, the views of the Shah about him, the chances of his being appointed Valiahd if his father dies, the probable attitude towards him of Kussia, &lt;xc. ? The Sadi-Azam would never back the 'id. Would he join the Valia lid’s son, or would he side with the Naib ? 3. Upon the question of a renewal of the old assurance by Russia of a guarantee of Persian integrity and independence, it may be worth while to sound the Russian Government again I can not imagine that they will return a favourable re P y. iey shirked giving an answer in 1893 and they will probably repeat that attitude. Such a refusal or evasion might, however, gi ve us the opportunity for making the statement to which I next turn. 4 I agree with Sir M. Durand as to the advisa bility of intimating to the Russian Government that any aggressive movement on their part in North Persia would probably lead to some counter dis positions by Great Britain in South Persia. There is no necessity to bind ourselves to take the Gulf ports, or to occupy any territory, or indeed, totromryttw o o adopt any specified course of action. I cannot see why any such intimation need be so worded (as the India Office seems to fear) as to constitute an obligation upon us to strike, whether the moment is, or is not, opportune. On the other hand, it is surely clear that Russia cannot be suffered to annex Khorasan, or any of the northern provinces of Persia, while we sit still and do nothing. Other wise, why have we a policy and a Minister in Persia at all ? The danger is that if there be (as is possible) a disturbed succession, the Russians will slip troops into Meshed, or Kuchan, or Astrabad, on the pretext of local disorder or menace to Russian interests, and that once there they will not be got out again. We do not want any Persian Chanta- buns. Such a contingency is much less likely to arise if the Russians know in advance (as they must already conjecture) that it would probably be the signal for a corresponding British move elsewhere. They want Persia, not merely for the intrinsic value of the northern provinces, but in order to get to the Gulf; and they will not rashly take any step that would effectually, and at a blow, prevent the realiza tion of that dream. I would suggest, therefore, as a wise precaution (assuming that Russia declines to renew, or evades renewing, the former guarantee), that Sir iN. O’Conor be instructed, in the course of his conversation at St. Petersburg!! about a peaceful succession—which Ins suggestion of Anglo-Russian co-operation will show to be the primary object of British policy— to observe that a disturbed succession might lead to results which neither party would wish to pre cipitate ; since any temptation that Russia might experience to intervene in the protection of her own interests in the north, might provoke a correspond ing temptation to Great Britain to safeguard her own even greater interests in the south. Ought we not, however, to look even a little further ahead ? Supposing that such a warning is given and is disregarded, and supposing that Russia does, upon some pretext, suddenly occupy and absorb an important part of North Persia, what line do our military authorities at home and in India, what line does the Indian Government itself take as to the policy and practicability of holding certain—and, if so, which—of the Gulf ports, and of occupying, influencing, or protecting any—and, if so, which—of the southern provinces ? During the last Conservative Government in IS91, I remember Balfour telling me that he had been4 unable to procure any opinion or advice from the responsible authorities on this subject, and at his request I wrote a Memorandum on the steps that might require to be taken. Has the question, however, ever been examined or discussed by the India Office or the Indian Government from the standpoint of their superior knowledge and re sources ? 5. I concur with Sir M. Durand in thinking that an agreement with Russia about Persia is quite out ol the question. We should have the Constanti nople situations of last autumn reproduced, feature for feature, at Tehran. Each reform pressed for would be made a “ stationnaire ” question over a 0 ain. We should get the kicks, and Russia would pocket the halfpence. It would seem to be much better-—where rival interests are frankly divergent -—for dther party to play its own game, instead of affecting a community of interest which does not exist, and which would only be assumed bv one party at any rate as a blind. suggested loan appear to be sound. There is no particular reason—at this moment—why we should pander to the Shah’s insatiable cupidity! It would be a favour to him, not a help to his country. We should be placed in an invidious position in CO lectm, the annual interest, and, having once }ielded, we should be bled for more. 7. The one real chance, however,’of doing some- nng that would be enormously beneficial to usia, that would conciliate the Shah, and that would promote British interests and i„ flu e„ ce would he to Anglicize the administration of the Customs on the Persian Gulf, with the hope of making th.s venture a financial success, and of ultimately extending the svstem Jni i over me uhole country-in other words, of doinv for Persia what Sir R. Hart has done for Chi„a° the Customs Department (for the Gulf ports) remain a Government Department, but let it be placed under a British head, and worked bv British or European subordinates. There could imt be he same nattve objection as there was, for instance o the Regie, seeing that the bulk of the ,1 collected from foreign, British or India' joerchandize, while there would probably bet long be a native demand that - &lt;. ■ 6 Should be flatly treated, in order to e'seape^he ^ s ^°Ri; h r ariou — 1 - I 10 ' lnce &gt; lf not every city. There is inPersia little of the frantic fanaticism and hostility to foreigners that are rampant in China, and if the system has been a conspicuous success in the latter country, I cannot see why it should fail in Persia. Sir M. Durand says that the one obstacle is the Sadr Azam, who now farms the Customs from the Shah, and makes 40,000Z. a-year by sub-contracts. But why not square the Sadr Azam by the same methods that it is always possible to adopt with his master? If under any new system it can be shown to the Shah that he will make 10,000/. a-year more than he did before, and to the Sadr Azam that he will make 5,000/., they will both be ready to put it into operation to-morrow. It would seem to be a pity to shelve as impracticable the one real chance of Persian reform simply because the avarice of an individual Minister, and he a Persian, stands in the way. Surely it should be within the resources of diplomacy to conciliate or come to terms with the Sadr Azam. Might it not in any case be worth while to consult Sir M. Durand on the matter ? I believe it to be the only method of really benefiting Persian administration, and at the same time of strengthening British influence and popularity in the country. 8. We have tried the experiment of officering the Persian army before now. It is not the slightest good as long as the soldiers do not get their pay. You want not merely British officers, but a British War Minister at Tehran. It will be time enough to think of it again, if ever we are in occupation of any part of the country, not before. 9. The post at Kesht does not appear any longer to justify an expensive Consulate (750/.). I would reduce it to a Vice-Consulate, and spend the money better elsewhere. 10. Particularly would I like to see some interest taken in Seistan. It is contiguous to Afghanistan. It is certain that when Persia breaks up we cannot allow it to be quietly absorbed by Russia. If it is so absorbed, she will get to the Gulf. Seistan is a British interest. That the bulk of it now belongs to Persia is due to us. I think we might do something to safeguard for Persia that which we have secured for her, and which we cannot afford to let pass into other hands. In proportion to the interest we show in Seistan now will be our opportunity of saving it in the future. I may add that it would be a great pity ifthe Shah’s appeal for advice from the British Govei .unent were entirely ignored. I have many coi respondents in Persia, and they unite in thinking that he is more disposed to listen favourably to representations from the present Government than Irom its predecessor. They also press upon me the advisability of giving a word of encouragement to the Shah to hold himself independent of Russian pressure. If no interest is shown in him by England, he is apt to think himself deserted, and to feel that he had better come to terms with the future arbiter of his country’s fortunes. He is of mercurial temperament, and is easily depressed or cheered. April 12, 1896. GEORGE N.

Surely it should be within the resources of diplomacy to conciliate or come to terms with the Sadr Azam. Might it not in any case be worth while to consult Sir M. Durand on the matter ? I believe it to be the only method of really benefiting Persian administration, and at the same time of strengthening British influence and popularity in the country. 8. We have tried the experiment of officering the Persian army before now T . It is not the slightest good as long as the soldiers do not get their pay. You want not merely British officers, but a British War Minister at Tehran. It will be time enough to think of it again, if ever we are in occupation of any part of the country, not before. 9. The post at Resht does not appear any longer to justify an expensive Consulate (750/.). I would reduce it to a Vice-Consulate, and spend the money better elsewhere. 10. Particularly would I like to see some interest taken in Seistan. It is contiguous to Afghanistan. It is certain that when Persia breaks up we cannot allow 7 it to be quietly absorbed by Russia. If it is so absorbed, she will get to the Gulf. Seistan is a British interest. That the bulk ot it now 7 belongs to Persia is due to us. I think we might do something to safeguard for Persia that which we have secured for her, and which we cannot afford to let pass into other hands. In proportion to the interest we show in Seistan now will be our opportunity of saving it in the future. I may add that it would be a great pity if6 the Shah’s appeal for advice from the British Government were entirely ignored. I have many correspondents in Persia, and they unite in thinking that he is more disposed to listen favourablv to representations from the present Government than from its predecessor. They also press upon me the advisability of giving a word of encouragement to the Shah to hold himself independent of Russian pressure. If no interest is shown in him by England, he is apt to think himself deserted, and to feel that he had better come to terms with the future arbiter of his country’s fortunes. He is of mercurial temperament, and is easily depressed or cheered. GEORGE N. CURZON. April 12, 1896.[This Document is the Property of Her Britannic Majatrty s Government. NO. 1 .

My Lord, Tabreez, June 21, 1897. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the copy of a despatch I have this day addressed Her Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires at Tehran, on the subject of the establish ment of a Russian Ecclesiastic Mission to the Nestorians in the districts of Urumiah and Sal mast. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL G. WOOD. Inclosure in No. 1. Consul-General Wood to Mr. C. Hardinge. (No. 2.) Sir, Tabreez, June 21, 1897. I HAVE the honour to report, for your information, that a Russian Ecclesiastic Mission passed through Tahreez, a short time ago, on its way to the south-western districts of Azerbaijan, where it is intended to establish a congregation of Nestorian converts or adherents to the Orthodox faith. The Mission is composed of two popes, or priests, one a Russian, who is the custodian of the Orthodox Cathedral in Erivan, and the other, “ Kasha ” Shimoon, a Nestorian, horn and educated at that place. These religious have made it known that they would settle permanently in the districts of Urumiah and Salmast in the event of their succeeding in finding 300 Nes torians who would join the Orthodox creed. On leaving Tabreez they directed their steps to Khoi, which town, however, owing to the absence of Nestorians, they but passed through on their way to “ Jamalabad,” or, as it is pronounced by the Syrians, “ Jamalava ” and “ Gavilan,” two Nestorian villages, of which the inhabitants went forth to meet them and give them welcome. From these places they travelled towards Urmi, and were met and greeted at the “ Shankarlui ” Bridge, some 13 miles from that town, by the Nestorian Bishop of the plain, Mar Yonan, great numbers* of the clergy, and practically the entire Nestorian residents, among whom many “ Chaldeans ” (Roman Catholic Nestorians) and Presby terian converts. Having stayed a day or so at Urmi, receiving visits of welcome and ceremony, they left for the village of “ Superghan,” in the neighbourhood of the Lake of Urumiah, the residence of Mar Yonan, by whom they were accompanied. At this place, on Thursday, the 4th instant, on the occasion of the celebration of Ascension Day (old style), the Russian priests read a declaration in the churchyard, containing the terms on which Nestorians would he admitted into the bosom of the Russo-Greek Church, and, eventually to Russia protection. Almost l,200 names representing, it may he said, the entire population, were signed, and among them those of many of the Nestorian clergy, headed by Mar Yonan. At Mushabad, a village close to Superghan, they obtained, according to trustworthy report, 700 adherents, and are said to he still occupied in extending their action. It is noteworthy that, notwithstanding the fact that the Russian Mission has not favoured, so far, the Armenian communities in those parts with its attentions, the inhabitants of Ganabat, a small Armenian village near Urmi, gathered together the church ornaments, and went out in procession to welcome them with the Nestorians on the occasion of the Nestorian demonstration at the Bridge of Shankarlui.

The situation presents a quaint anomaly, for we have thousands, according to report, of the Shalvs Christian and most industrious subjects, who have hitherto lived in peace and perfect freedom from persecution, deliberately accepting, and this under the eyes of their native authorities, a change of their religious tenets equivalent to an abandonment of their nationality, without obtaining or making the slightest effort to obtain a single promise or guarantee for future comfort and safety. The action of the Russian Ecclesiastic Mission to the Nestorians is a fitting corollary to the intentions and attitude taken up by my Russian colleague during the recent disturbances in Tabreez. It is needlessly provocative and deliberately insulting to the Shah’s authoritv. t! I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL G.

Constantinople, July 24, 1897. I HAVE the honour to forward to your Lordship herewith copy of despatch which I have received from Her Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Van, reporting on the occurrence at Diz in the Hekkiari district towards the end of May last. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) PHILIP CURRIE. Inclosure in No. 1. Captain Elliot to Sir P. Currie. (No. 32.) gj r? Van, July 6, 1897. I HAVE the honour to make the following Report on the occurrence at Diz in the latter end of May, about wdiich I telegraphed to your Excellency on the 3rd June. . On the 22nd or 23rd May, zaptiehs from Julamerk seized the bridge across the Lab, opposite to where the Valley of Diz joins that of the Lab. The Valley of Diz is occupied by the Nestorian Ashiret of that name. The effect of this action was to cut off the people of Diz from their docks which were across the river. The object of it was to get arrears of tribute out of the people of Diz. Both the time and the manner of it were unusual. The custom is to demand the tribute in October when the people, having sold their produce, may be expected to have money by them, and further, to give notice, before collecting tribute, to Mar Shimum, who deputes one of his men to attend. On this occasion, Mar Shimum was not informed of the intention to collect tribute till two days after the zaptiehs had occupied the bridge of Diz. When the bridge was seized, some Diz men went down to protest. They sat down and talked with the zaptiehs, and supplied them with food. One of the zaptiehs sent word to Julamerk that they were being fired on. The next day, accord ingly, the Kaimakam, Cazi, and Mudayimum came dowm to Diz with troops, and a following of Kurds from Julamerk. The Diz people met them at the bridge, and a parley ensued. The Diz men got alarmed at the attitude of the officials, and began to make off. The troops were ordered to fire by the Kaimakam, but as I have reported elsewhere, they took care to hit no one. The Julamerk Kurds, however, did their best, and some men got bullets through their clothes, but no one was hurt by the firing. Three children were, however, drowned in a torrent by falling from a bridge as they fled in terror up the valley. Some of the Diz men returned the fire as they retreated, and one of the officials got a bullet through his sleeve. Diz was then occupied, and £T. 500 was demanded. Eventually 1,055 sheep, 37 cattle, £ T. 24, and various other articles were taken, and the people of Diz left in a state of destitution. This act has aroused indignation and sympathy not only amongst the Christians, but also among the better disposed of their Mahommedan neighbours. On hearing of it from Mr. Browne I w r ent and saw the Acting Governor. He immediately telegraphed to Julamerk, and dismissed the Kaimakam and the Mudayimum, and ordered their successors to start without deiay. I his prompt action very probably averted very serious trouble as the Ashirets were on the verge of despair, and thought no resource w r as left them but to die with arms in their hands. It appears too, that serious measures were in contemplation against the other Ashirets, and even Kochannes. These have now been abandoned. [1588 a —1] BMar Shimum has all along used his influence with the Ashirets to keep them quiet. The announcement that the Order of the Osmanh, 2nd class, was on its way to him, and a telegram of congratulation he received irom the Acting iO\ernor, Shemshi Pasha, could not fail to have a good effect. . I met the Mudayimum at Bashkala. I believe him to be honest and eneigetic, but he is too hasty and inexperienced for a place like Hekkiari. lie appears to be not more than twenty-five years of age. Mr. Browne says that he afterwards, when he understood the vrong that had been done, saved the Diz Maliks from further bullying by the Kaimakam. The zaptiehs were Kurds from Julamerk. I here is a very strong hostile feeling between the Nestorians and the Julamerk people, and the employment of these zaptiehs for coercing the Christians is always likely to lead to disturbances, I have, &amp;c.

All progresses favourably, the material turned out is of good quality, and is gradually establishing a market lor itself. Lately a merchant from Azizieh ordered a large quantity, preferring it to that made at Marash. We are going to establish looms at Shahr and at other villages so as to gradually absorb all the Christian labour which is unemployed in the district.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 442 of the 2nd July, I have the honour to forward to your Lordship herewith copy of a despatch which I have received fromHer Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Van, giving a report of Ms journey in the Hekkiari district. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) PHILIP CUPtPIE. Inclosure in No. 3. Captain Elliot to Sir P. Currie. (No. 31.) Sir, Van, July 4, 1897. I HAVE the honour to report my return from Hekkiari on the 2nd instant. I have visited Nochannes, where I spent three days, and had several interviews with Mar Shimum and other leading men of the Nestorians. Mr. Browne, of the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Mission, was of great assistance in interpreting into Syriac for me, and kindly accompanied me for this purpose to Diza, in Gavur, Khumaroo, and Bashkala, from which place he returned to Kochannes and I to Van. Mr. Browne has also supplied me with various information about the Nestorians, which I beg to inclose with my despatch No. 33. I am greatly indebted to him for what he has done to help me. I visited Moussa Bey at Khoumaroo. I was wrong in my despatch No. 24 of the 1st June in stating that this man had a reputation but little deserved of protecting Christians. I confounded him with another Kurd of the same name, who lives near Gartchegan. This man has saved many lives, and has drasvn down on himself in consequence a lot of unpleasantness, and incurred no little risk. I had some difficulty at first in obtaining an interview with him, as the Kaimakam of Shemdidan, Noori Bey, who happened to be on a visit to Khumaroo, told off a police officer to attend him. On the day after my arrival, however, the Kaimakam, the Officer Commanding a detachment of troops at Khumaroo, the police officer, and Moussa Bey came to call. When they had taken their leave and were mounting their horses, I called Moussa Bey back, and invited him to stay longer. The others could not do so without being impolite, and after this Moussa Bey was free to come as much as he liked. I mention this incident to show the distrust with which Moussa Bey is regarded by the Govern ment. At Kochannes I found the Metropolitan (Matran or Archbishop) of the Nestorians still there, living in Mar Shimum’s house, and afraid to venture far from the village. His church and diocese are at Mar Ishn, in Shemdinan, in Turkey, but he dare not live there for fear of Sheikh Sadig, who has made several attempts on his life. His family are in Balulan, Tergavar, Persia, and he obtained, some time ago, permission from the Turkish Government to join them there, but has hitherto been afraid to leav&amp; Kochannes, as he heard that Sheikh Sadig had men on the watch for him to kill him. I suggested his coming with me, and he seemed glad to avail himself of the oppor tunity. At Diza (in Gavur) the Kaimakam undertook to see him safely over the frontier, and, as he seemed perfectly at ease in his mind, I left him to the care of the Government. On his arrival at Diza with me some soldiers of the garrison came up to him and said they were glad to see him. Sheikh Sadig is not liked, and I looked on this as an indication of the feeling against him, and sympathy with those he has persecuted. I may mention here that the Nestorians seem to entertain a high opinion of, and feel great confidence in, the Turkish regular troops. In the Diz affair, about which I telegraphed to your Excellency, the soldiers, when ordered to fire on the villagers, purposely fired wide of them, and the officer in command declined to order his men to direct their fire better, though urged to do so by the civil officials. I was told this by a Diz Malik and some villagers who were present. They also say that when soldiers are sent to collect taxes they take no more than the assessment, and refrain from oppressive behaviour. It is a pleasure to record this testimony in favour of the Turkish soldier, whom I have always regarded as most patient and subordinate. The frontier is being watched by detachments of troops and Hamidieh cavalry, and I was told that the Kurds in the summer pastures are keeping together in larger camps than usual as a precaution against attack by Armenian revolutionists. A party of fifty Shikak Kurds from Persian territory crossed the border and carried off all the sheep from Kotrannes, a Nestorian village about 40 miles inside4 the frontier. They were intercepted on their return, and had to abandon the sheep, winch were, I believe, restored to their owners. The Shikaks, instead of returning to Persia, remained in Turkish territory, and A\ay aid and robbed travellers. The day I reached Diza on my return from Khumaroo icy robbed and stripped five Turkish Kurds, leaving them nearly naked, and the nexi night they carried off some mules from the village near which I camped. This seems to be an ordinary occurrence on this frontier, as, during my former iourney, much the same sort of thing happened. The patience of the Turkish Government in matters of this sort seems some what surprising. 1 am making the affair at Diz, the general condition of the Kestorians, and the question of Sheikh Sadig the subject of separate Reports.

The universal impression is that he meant to make existence impossible for them. The impunity enioved bv the authors of the Armenian massacres, and the belief prevalent among Christians and kinds that an Imperial Firman to massacre the former had gone forth has within the last two years produced a state of affairs that cannot much longer be nut no with Inclosure Ivo. 3 gives some sort of idea of what this is. P P K This by no means includes everything that has happened durino- the nerind referred to in the statement. Nor does it take account of such minor exactons and outrages as for instance are committed by individual Kurds who come to a village and tomand a present. If they do not get what they want they avenge themselves sooner 01 later by setting hay-ncks on fire or doing similar damage. It is not to be supposed that the Nestorian Ashirets are guiltless of raids on their part These, however are usually in retaliation for losses inflicted on then and are not to be comparea with what they suffer. Moreover, they complain that theGo v em- .affenders^to unpunished rel,1 ' eSSiVe mt ' aSUreS a ^ mSt them &gt; but allo - s KurdishThey also complain that the roads are not safe for them to take their produce to market, and hence they find it hard to raise money to pay their tribute. The constant harassing they have endured would before now have driven the Ashiret, who are the only armed Christians in this vilayet into rebellion, were it not that Mar Shimum has exerted all his influence in exhorting them to be patient, and to hope for a fair hearing and justice from the Government. Mr. Browne has greatly assisted Mar Shimum by good advice and encouragement, and there can be no doubt but that his presence at Kochannes has been and is most beneficial. Mar Shimum’s task, nevertheless, is a difficult one. His cousins are always employed in intriguing against him, and since the time of Belvir Pasha they seem to have been encouraged by the Government officials, who do not give him the support he has a right to expect. I believe the intention of sending Russian priests to Kochannes is due to intrigues on the part of those who wish to embarrass Mar Shimum. He claims that if he is properly supported by the Government in dealing with his own people, and that if the Kurds are kept from molesting them and the roads to the markets rendered safe, that he will keep the Ashirets quiet and get them to pay their tribute. As regards the Russian priests they had not arrived at Kochannes when I was there. Mar Shimum, and the Matran (Archbishop) assured Mr. Browne most strongly that they had no wish or intention to give up their church and become orthodox. On leaving Bashkala I met a priest on the road who, I hear, is a Nestorian by birth but a Russian subject, and of the Orthodox Church. He way on his way to Kochannes, ostensibly to visit relations there, but he had stayed a week in Van with the Russian Consul, and £ T. 150 from the Credit Lyonnais had been waiting for him in Van. I believe him to be one of two Russian priests that met with a most enthusiastic reception from the Nestorians in Urmia a few weeks back. The Nestorians are now in a very despondent condition. They seem to consider matters to be about as bad as can possibly be endured, and that before long they will have no resource but to abandon their religion or emigrate. Many have already left, and some once prosperous villages are entirely deserted. Thanks greatly to Mr. Browne’s friendly help and advice they still retain a hope that better times are coming. If disappointed in this they look forward to nothing better than their extinc tion as a separate people and church. They told me that their hopes were placed on England’s influence being exerted on their behalf. I impressed on them that all I could do was to lay the state of their case before your Excellency, and warned them against being too sanguine. I have spoken to Shemshi Pasha about the state of affairs in Hekkiari, and uged the importance of supporting Mar Shimum’s authority and exiling Sheikh Sadig. I have great confidence in Shemshi Pasha’s will and ability to put things on a proper footing throughout this vilayet. He has, as is inevitable when a man does his duty in this country, made enemies, and 1 fear their intrigues may prove too much for him eventually, unless he is supported by the Porte. I have, &amp;c.

This Company is formed to give practical effect to a scheme which in different shapes has been widely discussed for over 30 years, both from the strategic and commercial points of view, to connect England 'with India by a more comprehensive and direct Overland Route than has hitherto been included within the meaning of that term.At different times at least three Routes have been considered. One from Alexandretta through Syria to the head of the Persian Oulf. A second from Haifa via, Damascus and Bagdad, thence following the lines of cultivation and population through Persia and Beluchistan to Kurrachee, and the third, the more modest and practicable scheme adopted by this Company, of an almost straight line fiom Port Said following the course of a pastured valley to the head of the Persian Gulf. This line has the great advantage of being practically free from political complications, of presenting no engineering difficulties or works of any magnitude, of being under 1,000 miles in length, and capable of construction within a very limited time, for say £5,000,000 sterling or £5,000 a mile, whereas the other lines above indicated would entail protracted and delicate negotiations with France, Turkey, Russia and Persia, with attendant delay of probably several years, an incalculable outlay of money, and the almost inevitable risks of political complications in the future. Full particulars of the route to be followed by the line adopted by this Company will be found in a comprehensive article by Mr. C. E. D. Black, in the “Contemporary Review” of April, 1895, in an admirable paper by Col. A. T. Fraser, R.E., in the “ Journal of the Society of Arts ” for September, 1896, and in a paper read by Mr. Black before the Society of Arts on the 5th of May, 1897. Extracts from these three authorities and a map accompany this Prospectus, and will be found to contain rough estimates of the cost of construction and earning powers of the line, with a comparison of its strategic, commercial and linancial advantages over the other routes suggested and of the present Red Sea Route. It is proposed so soon as definite surveys, estimates and Government support shall have been obtained, that the Pioneer Company should sell its undertaking to a larger Construction Company with a nominal Registered Capital of £600,000, in which Shareholders of the present Company will be entitled to receive a proportionate 'pro rata allotment in fully-paid Shares, and that the Construction Company should, after the capital has been secured and actual contracts have been entered into for the construction of the line, sell to the final Railway Company itself the whole of its Goodwill and interest in the undertaking for twice the amount of its issued Share Capital in fully-paid Shares, so that original subscribers to this the Pioneer Company will not only obtain a magnificent return for their money,but will be entitled to the credit of having contributed to the successful carrying-out of an Imperial undertaking of the first magnitude and of the greatest importance to India and our Eastern possessions, worthy of having taken shape and being commenced in the 60th year of the Queen’s Reign. It must be remembered of course that the present scheme, while supplying the obvious and much needed complement to the Suez Canal route, is only a link in the chain which must jiltimately be completed to connect India withEgypt by land, and that sooner or later Companies or Syndicates will undoubtedly be formed to construct a Persian Gulf railway connecting Bassorah with Quetta or Kurrachee, with probable branch lines to Teheran and the coal and oil regions in the neighbourhood of Bagdad which will prove of the greatest value to the line now contemplated, both as sources of fuel and as traffic feeders. The only contract entered into by the Company is one with the Anglo-Indian Banking Corporation, Limited, of the 21st day of May, 1897, but whereas there may be other contracts or agreements entered into for the raising of capital or otherwise to which this Company is not a party, subscribers to this issue will be held to have had sufficient notice thereof, and to waive all claims in respect thereof* under Clause 39 of the Companies’ Acts, 1885 to 1896.

The Persian frontier question's still to the fore ; the rivalry between England and Russia at Teheran for political ascendancy and com mercial supremacy having never before been so keen. The opening of the Karun River to navi gation, immediately after Prince Dolgorouky’s departure from Teheran in September, v.-.ir; ro- j warded here as a breach of faith on the part of ' Persia, by which England secured very serious I advantages. As it was useless to seek the re- i scinding of that act, it was determined to set , about' obtaining compensation iu tue Aorth without delay, and, if necessary, by the exercise | of verv strong pressure. _ ^ i Prince Dolgorouky returned to his post with i instructions to this effect, and even in the short time that has elapsed he has secured some 1 results, while other and more important advan tages arc already looked for with conhdence. A Russian Consul is already installed at Meshed, the obiections of the Persian Government on the score of Mahometan fanaticism having vanished at the first real insistence. Persia has moreover, renewed her promise to construct a '-&gt;-ood road from Meshed to the north-west, to Tom the Russian road from Askabad. A communication in to-day’s Xovosti, evi dently from a well-informed source, states that Russia further insists that Persia shall open to Russian navigation the lagoon Murd-ab, which | lies between Enzeli and Pera Bazar, near Resht, and that she shall commence at once the con struction of a high road from Resht to Teheran. We are informed that the Persian Government fully agreed to these demands. Rules for he navigation are being drawn up, and, together with a Decree opening the lagoon to Russian vessels, will be published shordj. _ The precise value of these concessions on the part of Persia is rather difficult to estimate. If, instead of a road, a railway were to be built from Resht to Teheran, it would be a vei&gt; complete set-off to the opening of tae Krmm. Even if a good road were constructed north ward from Shuster, without which a mere right of river navigation is of little value strategically, the advantage would be absolutely on the side of Russia. .There is no private enterprise in Russia, however, and unless tne Government takes the matter m hand jvhich it seems disinclined to do, it is probable that no railway will be built for a long time to come. ! Meanwhile, what is really important to Eng land is to note that Russia is qmte dctermined to keen her hold over northern Persia, botu commercially and strategically ; and that every privilege or concession we obtam from the Government of the Shah will be followed im mediately by demands for at least equivalent advantages for Russia. Russia is, ol course, extremely well situated to enforce compliance with her wishes.

Thus, it was recently reported that owing to the success which had attended the establish ment of the Russian Consulate-General at Mashad, other Russian Consulates are to be created at Ispahan and Bushire, together with numerous commercial agencies. To t ie uninitiated this will be understood to mean that the experiment of a Consulate-General at Alashad has been sufficiently successful to war rant the appointment of Consuls at other places in Persia. This plausible argument will not, however, deceive adepts in Central Asian politics. They know full well that no su ch reason has induced the bcPe vity on the part pf^gland. the war with Afghanistan in 1878-80 was followed by the realisation of the long dormant designs on the independence of the Turkomans by the expedi tion under Skobeleff. Russia’s movements in the Transcaspia districts excited the atten tion of the English Government, who appointed Consul Churchill, and subsequently Colonel Lovett, to the Consulate at Astrabad to watch their proceedings.

Tabreez is a city in the North of Persia. The Kurds are a fierce race who belong to Kurdistan, partly under the dominion of the Shah, and partly governed by the Sultan. They are scattered about various provinces of Persia, but are specially numerous in the region surrounding Tabreez. They are devoted Mahometans, and are difficult to control by the Turkish Administration. The correspon dent, writing under date of June 23, says:—An un precedented act of violence has been committed on a Pritish subject. Hafiabad, a large village on the river Jaghatu and about 45 miles on the east of So uj-Bulak, with three other villages, belongs to the Greenfield family. Mrs. H. Isaac Green field, in order to administer and look after her property, has, since the death of her husband, been mostly living with her children in that village. In the beginning of May last, on a fine eVcning, Miss Katy Greenfield, a girl 14 years old, was induced by her servant, an old Kurdish woman, to go for a walk. Whilst walking she was suddenly seized and carried away by a horseman of the name of Aziz, who hud been lying in ambush with three other Kurds. Unfortunately at this time the young lady’s three brothers were absent from the village. One of them was in Europe, another on his way to Persia, and the third at Tabreez on business. When Mrs. Greenfield heard of the occurrence she at once mounted a horse and, followed by one of her servants, pur sued the abductors, but night coming on she lost traces of them, and returned to report the case to the British Consul-General at Tabreez. The Ameer Nizam, Governor-General of Azer baijan, being applied to by Mr. Paton, the acting British Consul-General, telegraphed to So-uj-Bulak for the restoration of the young lady to her mother. The acting Governor of the latter place answered that it was out of his power to restore the girl, because he pretended she had been carried across the frontier to the village of Tevila, in Turkey. After negotiations and exchange of notes more stringent orders were i sent to So-uj-Bulak, and Miss Greenfield w as then brought to that town and confided to the care of Molla Abdulla, a Kurdish Mufti. The next day a mock inquiry was held, in which none but Mussulmans took part. It is said that instead of. Miss Katy a Kurdish girl, wrapped up j in black and tightly veiled, as the Mahometan. custom is in Persia, was introduced. The girl declared to the assembly that she was a Maho-1 metan, and desired to live and die in that religion. The result of the inquiry was then telegraphed to the Governor-General at Tabreez. The acting British Consul General was not satisfied with this; he insisted on the girl being brought to Tabreez and interrogated in his presence. New orders to that effect were sent to So-nj-Bulak. When it was known there that the young lady would be taken to Tabreez, a party composed of the beggarly and lowest class of Turkish subjects proceeded to the house of Molla Abdulla, drew out Miss Greenfield, and forcibly carried her to the Turkish Consulate. Thomas Enendi, the Honorary Consul, seeing the rioters coming, ordered the door of the Consulate 1 to be shut against them, and then from the terrace advised them to carry and remit the girl to the local authorities, because, he said, she being British and the abductors Persian subjects they as Turkish subjects had no right to meddle with the matter. To this the rioters answered by smashing the door of the Consulate and leading Miss Green field to the terrace, where stands the mast of the Consulate’s flag. They made her sit at the base of the mast. Then tumultuously, with threats and abuse, they demanded the Consul to hoist the flag. This they did under the idea that the Persian Government would shun taking the girl from the protection of the Turkish flag, as such an act would constitute an insult to that Power. The Turkish Consul getting somehow or other out of the hands of the rioters sought safety in flight, leaving the Consulate in the hands of the rabble. The rioters, in order to protect Miss Greenfield from the heat of the day and the cold of the night, pitched a tent on the terrace and made her live in it. As an additional precaution several Kurdish women were lodged with her. These matrons, while keeping a strict watch on their victim, did not cease to inculcate on her mind the principles of Islamism and the felicities flowing thereform. fo give effect to their teachings they did not neglect to threaten her with instant death the moment she dared to profess Christianity. Not content with this, they have compelled her to write and sign different letters in which she is .made to declare that she has been a Mahometan for two years, that she has been fasting during the sacred month of Ramadan, and that she has not [by compulsion but by her own volition followed Aziz, the man chosen by her to be her husband, and that if forced to go to Tabreez she would put an end to her life. The rioters, after lodging Miss Greenfield in the Consulate, have been sending word to the Kurds in Turkey, in viting them to come and defend Islamism, because they pretended the English Consul wanted to take to Tabreez and forcibly convert to Christianity a girl who had become a true believer. The Turkish Consul - general from Tabreez and the Ottoman Ambassador from Teheran both sent several telegrams to the rioters advising and ordering them to desist from their illegal and criminal conduct and to deliver Miss Greenfield to the So-uj-Bulak authorities, other wise they would be severely punished. The rioters paid no attention to these counsels, nor abstained from intimidation. Many of the Turkish Kurds answering the call of the rioters began to arrive, all armed, at So-uj-Bulak, and joined the insurgents. The local authorities, see ing the turn which the affair was taking, declared themselves unable to take Miss Greenfield out of the hands of the Turkish Kurds without using force and shedding much blood. The Persian Government then proposed to the British Lega tion to send Mr. Paton to So-uj-Bulak, and there question the girl as to her choice of religion. The Shah himself, to obviate all difficulty and settle speedily this thorny question, sent word to the British Legation expressing his personal wish that Mr. Paton should go to So-nj-Bulak, and there make the necessary inquiry. After the exchange of views and many telegrams between Tabreez, Teheran, London, and Constantinople an agreement was at last arrived at. To facilitate the surrender of Miss Greenfield to the local authorities the Turkish Government was requested by the Persians to authorise their Consul- general at Tabreez to accompany Mr. Paton to So-uj-Bulak and there persuade their subjects to give up the girl. The necessary permission having arrived, Bejet Effendi and Mr. Paton, accompanied by a Persian functionary and other persons, left Tabreez on the 13th iust. for So-uj- Bulak. The latest news from that town states that the Turkish Consul-general on his arrival at the place was received with some marks of respect by tne Turkish Kurks, but ho has been told that, the question being simply a religious and not a political one. neither he. the Consul-general, nor the Ottoman Ambassador at Teheran had any thing to do with it.

It is understood that a treaty is now being airanged between Russia and Persia, half politi cal, half economic, containing the following two stipulations A commercial union between the two countries which will have the effect of all but absolutely excluding other Powers from commercial relations ; and, secondly, the rele- D gation of political representation abroad to a , single one of the two Powers, either Russia or 5 Persia.

But if he sees that all the unproductive labourers have bread, he must also see that they turn out their tale of work and are so distributed that I and their other customers are bene fited by them. For if society undertakes distribution, it means that it takes from me all my surplus which I now distribute and distributes it for me. Therefore it must in return undertake the distribution of reli gion, art, medicine, literature, music, &amp;c. There must be inspectors to see that Sir John Millais paints a sufficient numoer of pictures and that Madame Patti does not sing half a note flat. In my jnarket town of Bromley, Mr. Hyndman would decide how many doctors, dentists, batchers, and music masters there should be, and that each did eight hours’ work a day, and I should be obliged to employ one of them, for I should have no money to go in search of a better.

(3*) TEHERAN, Oct. 5. There have been disturbances at Meshed for the last three days, directed against the tobacco monopoly, and business has been at a standstill, but the town is now quiet and order has been restored.—Our Correspondent, by Indo-European Telegraph. RUSSIA AND PERSIA. PARIS, Oct.* 1). On the 26 th ult. I sent you information of a treaty between Russia and Persia excluding other Powers from commercial relations with the latter and assigning diplomatic joint representation abroad to one of the two Powers. Two days afterwards a St. Petersburg telegram stated that this 'vvas positively denied in diplomatic circles. Not liking to reply without being certain, I have waited till my informant had time to ascertain whether this official contradiction ought to be accepted. I have now received a letter which enables me. to state that the contradiction is mere cavilling, at once somewhat childish and clumsy. It speaks of a new 'treaty of commerce and denies only this. But I have never spoken of a new treaty. 1 have said that a treaty is being “ arranged,” without in any way affirming that it is a new one, or that the existing treaty will be changed by altered or additional clauses. But this is precisely what the denial avoids specifying, adopting once more this tortuous expedient of using ambiguous words. But I am sure that negotiations are going on, that before long the result of these negotiations will be known, and that one of the clauses of the arranged treaty will provide that if Persian refugees in Russia—and this alludes to a relation of the Shah, who has sought shelter in Russia— were conspiring against Persia, Russia would take the pledge to hand them over to the Persian authorities. Moreover, at this very moment one of the most important representatives of Persia in Europe has been summoned back to Teheran to finish the arrangements or conditions of the altered treaty of which the negotiations had been begun under his auspices. This negotiator I could even name, if necessary. If I were to say all I know about this Persian matter, I could allude to the rivalry for influence which exists at this moment at ieheran to an extent which hitherto has never been realized ; I could affirm that one Power has even proposed to Nasr-ed-Din to make a fresh tour through Europe at its own expense as a proof of its friendship, and that the Shah, without refusing, has not, or, at least, has not yet, accepted. I could add that even in the direction of religion the Persian Shiites are being incited against the orthodox Mahomedans, the Sunnites,in order to detach the Persian Mahome dans from the ties of the Caliphate, of which Abdul Hamid is the most powerful, if not the undisputed, chief and Commander. This is what I have to reply to tbe official denial of St. Petersburg regarding the Russo-Persian negotia tions. 1 think that the reply may seem enough to impartial readers, but 1 am ready to say morebeing kinds that had been in cultivation tor many years ; some, comparatively new varieties of Ameri can origin ; and two which have not yet been put in commerce. 'We staked off 8ft. at each end of the drills right across, leaving the middle (44ft.) untreated. The 8ft. at the top we treated according to the Jensen method of high-moulding, that is, to cast up from between the rows sufficient soil to cover the haulm, and then flatten it down on the top of the drill. The object aimed at in this treatment is to prevent the disease, which first attacks the leaves, from travelling down the stem to the tuber. The 8ft. at the other end of each drill, at the bottom of the piece, we treated acccxding to the formula given by M. Prilleux, with which most successful results have been attained in France. The middle of the piece, beyond the ordinary treatment of earthing up aud hoeing, we left untouched. In due course, first the early, then the middle crop, and then the later varieties showed signs of ripening, but a very remarkable thing was that while in every drill signs of maturity were as plain as could be, the decay of the haulm stopped short as soon as the drill ran into the 8ft. treated by the new remedy. At that end the stalks were green and vigorous, and so they remained until past the middle of September, while the upper portion and the middle of the drills had ripened off nearly a n onth before. The effect of keeping the plants growing for a longer term must have tended to an increased yield,and thus proved the solution to be a stimulant as well as a remedy. On digging the different lots, although some were heavier croppers than others, and some were more diseased (the “ Dean ” and the “ Village Black smith,” both coloured sorts, being the worst in that respect), the comparative results of the different courses of treatment tallied to a remarkable extent in all the sorts. The top piece, treated on the Jensen system, was a little diseased, but not much, the middle piece (44ft.), which was not treated at all, was very badly affected, whilst the bottom, which had been syringed with tbe salts of copper solution, had escaped with an infinitesimal proportion of disease, in one case— that of a new sort named “ Prodigious ”—not a single tuber being affected, and in the case of the others not more than 2 to 4 per cent. Comparing the yield of sound tubers, the French remedy stands as six, the Jensen method as four, and the ** trust-to- Providence ” course as three, in proportion to each other. The formula we used was as follows :—31b. of sulphate of copper and 11b. of quicklime to 20 gallons of water, applied on the foliage at the rate of 140 to 150 gallons per acre. In preparing the solution, the sulphate of copper should be dissolved in a wooden tub, the quicklime slaked in another tub, and, when thoroughly slaked, mixed with the copper solution. The solution should then be well stirred, and when the liquid is being drawn off for use it should be again stirred to insure an even dis tribution of the salts of copper. We applied the solution with a common garden syringe, but for a large area a portable bucket with a spray-nozxled hosepipe would be better. The crumpled foliage sorts retain the liquid more than the smooth-leaved ones, such as “ Early Puritan ” or ** Beauty of Hebron ” do, and the effect of our serving all the sorts alike was to cause the wrinkled ones to wear rather a geared look for a week or two after they had beenPERSIA.^'* The epidemic has ceased at Teheran, and business is being resumed. At a moderate estimate the mortality in Teheran reached 13 , 000 , but some place it at over 20 , 000 , in- ! eluding the surrounding villages. Six new * cemeteries were opened. The total number t of deaths in Persia was not under 30 , 000 . The only organization for relief was the hos pital improvised by the American Presbyterian mission. More than 80 patients were admitted, 1 of whom about one-third;were saved. More than 2,000 natives received medicines and care. Many Europeans also independently visited and as sisted the cholera victims, saving many lives. About 20 Europeans have died. r Axm -lealecs A.id speculators are vcij -- prices for deliver y of the new crop. COLONIAL NOTES. . The work done and in progress at the experimental : arm% which under the instruction of the Ministry ot Wriculture have been established in different parts of the Dominion of Canada, is treated in an interesting report by Mr. W. Saunders, the director. During 18J1 farmers in almost evei^ part were blessed with bounti ful crops, and the outlook, from an agricultuial standpoint, is most encouraging, for there have been improvements in the preparation of the soil, in the selection of seed, and in the general management of crops, all indicating that increased intelligence is being brought to tear on farm work. The stores of fertility in the soil are being more carefully husbanded by a judicious succession of crops and greater pains are taken to rep ace the elements which repeated cropping has removed, the mental inactivity of the past is fast being replaced by a spirit of inquirv which augurs well for the future. The best aami.e.tkfi ci geed grain obtainable, all ^the&lt;4z) Press Suiting and Intaation Agency, 359, STRAND, Cutting f &gt; Date Address of Journal. The Shah seems likely to pay very dear ^ his trips to Europe, if the statements made as Yd the present condition of Persia by a Constan tinople correspondent of The. Times deserve the implicit confidence which is claimed for them. It is asserted that the endeavours made by Nazu-ed-Deen to introduce some of the elements of Western civilisation into his country, few and baiting as these endeavours have been, have excited the fanaticism of Persian Mohamme danism to such a pitch that the Shah’s Crown is endangered, and Persia on the brink of a Mahdist revolution. The anger of the mollahs at the number of Europeans who have been appointed to posts under the Government, so far from being assuaged by their triumph in compelling the repeal of the tobacco monopoly, appears to have been fed and further stimulated by that con- - spicuous proof of their influence with the people. I They are demanding the expulsion of all Euro peans from Persia, and the abolition of the Bank of Persia, recently established by English capitalists. Acts t&gt;f violence against Europeans are said to be growing more and more fre quent ; threatening notices have become as common as in Ireland; and, to crown the whole, a Mahdi has been discovered at Samara, near Bagdad, in the person of Moll ah Kajji Mirza Hass an Shirazl who, it was announced in many mosques on the occasion of the late Muharrem festival, is predestined to emancipate Persia from the yoke of “the accursed Feringhee.” Nor is it only these preachers of wrath who threaten mischief. The misgovern- ment of the country has given rise v-}ib disaflection in the most varied quarters. Treachery is alleged to be rampant even within the Palace itself, the Shah’s third son, who occupies the past of War Minister, being regarded as in secret sympathy with the --malcontent leaders, while the Grand Vizier has judged it discreet to parley with the most influential of the mollahs. Russia is, of course, charged with being at the bottom of the mischief. There is never a political conspiracy formed in Western Asia that Russia does not get the credit of fomenting. In this case, however, the Russophobists must be allowed to have some strong presumptive evidence on their side. Russia is in a very favourable position now for snapping up the Persian pomegranate the moment that the ripe fruit falls from the tree. She main tains a detachment of Cossack cavalry at Teheran, as the body-guard of the Czar’s ambassador in that city, and the Turcoman regiments of the Persian army are all officered by Russians. Finally, a Russian expeditionary force could reach Teheran in ten days from several points on the Transcaspian Railway. The danger to British interests constituted by these circumstances was pointed out by Mr. George Curzon three years ago, in the literary record of his travels through Central Asia. Mr. Curzon, however, is no longer at the India Office, and nobody supposes that Lord Kimberley has either the time or the inclination to trouble himself about such a small matter as the prospects of the annexation of the Kingdo: of Darius by the descendant of Pe * 1&amp; await an inquest. — &gt;-&gt; ■ , I O’Brien, of 88 , Marsh Lane, informed the police that the body was that of his wife, whose age was 4o. It appeared that she retired to rest as usual on Wednesday evening, and be could not account for her disappearance. He missed her during the night, and had been endeavouring to trace her whereabouts. It is surmised that she must have risen and left the house while in a fit of somnam bulism. Leeds School Board.—T he members of this! Board held their ordinary meeting yesterday at the- oSk-es in Oatveriey three t, Mr. B. G. Wilkinson pre siding. Mr. Cockburn proposed that “pupil teachers m 1 denominational schools in the borough be admitted .to the ' Board’s classes for instruction of pupil teachers, subject to ' an annual navment by thp managers of £2 per teacher, and subject also to the fulfilment of such conditions as- the Board may from time to time impose.” He said that this marked a new era in the history of the Board. So far as he knew, they had never taken such a step before. The resolution, if adopted, would have the effect of open ing all the classes to all the teachers in the town at cost price. He was pleased to know that the educationalists of Leeds were able to pull together in common sympathy and effort at the heavy load behind them. Mr. J. H. Wurtzburg, in seconding the resolution,^ said that it was a graceful act on the part of the Board, and had been gracefully done. In his opinion even the most captious critic could not object to the proposaL (Hear, hear.) It should not be forgotten that the Volun tary schools educated a third of the children in Leeds, and it was no doubt the wish of the Board that those children should be efficiently taught. The motion wa« supported by Mr. Maguire, the Rev. J. Longoottom, and Mr. Earnshaw, and unanimously adopted. It was resolved, on the proposal of Mr. Fawcett, to purchase from the Leeds County Council a portion of land adjoining Beeston Hill School, to enable the Board to straighten the boundaries of the school site. On the motion of Mr. Cockburn, it was decided that a loan of £ 7,120 be raised from the Leeds Corporation for the expenses of the site for a permanent school to super sede the present temporary premises in the Salem and Pottery Field districts. Daring Theft of Postal Orders at Beam- lkt.— At the Leeds Police Court yesterday, William Arthur Darnborough, a young lad, was charged with stealing 16 postal orders from the Back Lane Post Office, Bramley, on November 2nd. On that date he went to the post office, which is also a provision warehouse, and made a small purchase. The wife of the postmaster went into the cellar to fetch the article he required, and on her return found him shutting down the slide through which Post Office business is transacted. She asked him what he was doing there, and he apologised if he had done anything wrong, protesting that he had taken nothing. Shortly afterwards Mrs. Boocock missed 16 postal orders, each of the value of half-a-crown. On the same afternoon the prisoner called at a local tradesman’s shop and asked if it was necessary that the postmaster’s name should be on a postal order before it could be cashed. He was answered in the affirmative, and said he was much obliged. He had asked two or three others, but could not get to know. Police-constable Handley arrested the prisoner the same evening at his father’s house. When Handley went in prisoner said, “ It’s me you want for taking them things from the post office in Back Lane.” When charged, he said he had not got the orders. Prisoner strongly denied the charge, and said he had never seen the missing postal orders. It was stated that the orders had never been presented for payment, and had not been traced. After a lengthy con- -nffcation the Bench convicted prisoner, and taking into Bsideration the fact that he had been waiting trial for a k, ordered Mm to be further imprisoned with hardPUBLIC WORKS IN PERSIA. 4$ 'VISCOUNT fcjIDMOUTH asked a question with reference to a concession reported to have been made to the Russian Government for the construction of public works in Persia. The EARL of ROSEBERY.—I am not in a posi tion to give my noble friend very full informa tion because all that has reached us has been in telegrams, and I do not think that these form a proper iJasis to give as full an answer on a question of this kind as 1 could wish. But, as far as I can gather from the news I have received, this concession is only a revival of part ftf an old concession granted in 1890 and which has practically lapsed by disuse. As soon as I receive further information,by despatches or otherwise, I will communicate it to the noble viscount ; but in the meantime our impression is that, both, from investigation at Teheran and from investigation on the part of the Indian Government, there is nothing in this concession to which the Go vernment can take serious objection. ' i The House rose at five minutes to 5 o’clock. 'career he found his friendthegratefulrecioient of many honouis and rewards. He knew full well that none of them could have fallen to him without the loyal assistance he had invariably received from the civil and military services in India—an assistance and co-operation for which he would ever be grateful. Kor could he forget the kindly thought which prompted them to entertain him there that evening or the very handsome reception, they had given him. He was not unmindful of the further high compliment they had paid him in asking him to have his portrait painted tor their club. It was indeed an honour oi which ho was deeply sensible, and for which he begged to offer them his best thanks. (Loud cheers.) Uther toasts followed.
