The-profit accruing from the export of tea (about ts.200/- per dase) will*be allowed to go to Importers of food ad an incentive* 2 * lx is necessary because the 25 tons of Darter sugar per month permitted by the Government of India (or even ixc 43 tens re commended by you) will not be enough to finjp.ee our imports, '-e have allotted barter su*ar for imports of dates in parch at the rate of 'or each h..400/- of food imported, a^: our aim is to sell dates at 2/3rds cost price aiiu the profit to the date importer on each bag of sugar is about Ks.20Q/-. At 'this rate we required 47^7 tons to sub sidise our March imports of dates and other food. Of course we only ^ave permits for the export of 25 to^s and 22.7 tons is therefore 'owed” to importers. If the Government of India agree to the export of 43 tons por month and if our date imports drop in the; coming months it may be possible to make this up to importers, but 1 consider it well to bring tea into the barter scheme as a precaution. 3 . it is proposed that the Food Company will buy all tea imported, with the exception of 12 tons per month required for local consumption, and will allow importers a 20,S profit. A small percentage (in the neighbourhood of 1%) will be allowed as ”conmission , ‘ to the manager and to cover clerical, storage, and other expences. Permits to export the tea will be given to importers of food. If sufficient food is not imported to require the export of the bulk of the tea in ‘the hands of the company traders can be allowed to export the sur plus tea on payment of hs.200/~ per case to the food company and the proceeds credited to our fund for subsidising grain. 4 C i shall be grateful for your concurrence to the above scheme. The Government of India, it appears, have not specified the amount of tea we may export per month but have given us 41.6 tons ”to allow a margin for purposes of barter for essential commodities with the Persian Coast” vide the Political Residents Memorandum No. C/475 dated the 26th November 1943 forwarded with your endorsement No.C/1650 dated the 29th November 1943. jn fi t XLUA Taj or T.Hickinbo tham,C. 1.3. ,0.5.3., the Political .Agent, BAHRAIN.

Under instructions from the Government of India the shipment of the above tea was suspended from Bombay in 1942 until further orders hence naturally we had to store the same in rombay ^ond. The said tea was kept in Bombay till 1945. Due to the climatic conditions the contents of the above tea got deteriorated and the nature of the contents suffered and even the weight decreased. /softer inspection the Government of India was pleased to declare the above tea 'FRUSTRATED' and permitted the shipment to its destination for which licenses were originally issued. After renewal of licenses on payment of additional tea cess, the Bombay office was allowed to ship the same to Dubai. This was done in three lots of 960, 1419 and 153 cases and the whole consignment has been received in Dubai.

N0 .c/475 of 1943 dated the 26th of November 1943 addressed to you with a copy to me). Distribution was based on this and 43q % was allowed for local consumption and 66^ a for barter purposes, in view of the short supply of tect in India howeve^the Trucial Coast quota for periods januciry— parch and April—deptember 1944 were reduceo to , oi the ^ original amount and revised allocations .ere made accordingly tU -(vide you 1 * memorandum No.c/1222 dated the 23rd of August 1944). v ?or the period October 1944 to Larch 194q the Trucial Coast quota was eventually fixed at 191,648 lbs and a revised distribution list was submitted with this office upcpress Letter ^NO.061.1225 dated the 13th of January 1945 in reply to your b express Letter No.c/34 dated the 6th of January 1940. In ^ other words the monthly quota for the pe. iod January-Jeptember 1944 was 13.86 tons and 14.25 tons for the period October 1944 to parch 1945 as opposed to the 41.6 tons hich \.as oi iginally expected. ,4. since the 1st of January this year however, 5701 chests of tea and 99733 lbs of tea have been imported into Dubai and Sharjah. Allow ing 100 lbs of tea per chesty this amounts to 6,69,833 Ids, which is equivalent to about 7 months supplies at 41.6 tons per month or about 1 year 9 months supply based on the quota reduced to The consignors and consignees of these imports are known but there is no information to'show against whicn'allocations or quotas or periods this tea has been supplied, until therefore I know for what period this tea has been allottea it is aifxicult for me to allocate it accurately for local consumption and barter, in fact, up to date it has never been possible to properly check the imporus of tea because the manifests or Bills .of Lading, as the case may be, do not indicate against which quooa the export has been allowed. This unsatisfactory state of affairs could in my opinion be remedied by adopting the following procedure:- a) informing this office of the periodical quotas for the ’racial Coast a1^ least 3 months in advance, b) Obtaining from tne Tea Controller confirmation5.- 50 fa •&lt;h P dH 1 ' of the dis oribution of the quota asaibraitted by this office before che commencement of the period in question. c) obtaining from the Tea Controller details oi al b # export licences immediately they are issued. This information could be telegraphed ana should shovv clearly the quota against, which the licence has been issued and ho., much frustrated tea has been included. d) attaching a copy of each licence issued wion the manifest or dill of Lading. 0# 'phe export, ot^ frustrated tea from India has further complicated the issue. In this connection kindly refer to your memorandum Mo .1622—29/17 dated the 19th of April 1S45. In para 2 it states that frustrated tea will be debited to the regular quota to start with but that the export of tea will be allowed even after the 1944—45 allocation has been exceeded. This presumably means that all frustx*ated tea at present in oossession of the merchants can be imported into trie xrucic;.! Coast irrespective of the quotas allocated to them.^ But that any amount imported in excess of the regular quota vvill be deoited to successive quotas. If this interpretation is correc it orobably accounts for the large quantities of tea which are now arriving in Dubai and dharjah. until however a clear statement showing details of the regular Trucial Coast quota, quantities of frustrated tea included ana the balance oi frustrated tea to be debited to luture quotas (indicating individual merchants concerned) it will not be possible feu me to saoisfactorily sort out the apparent muddle. j Vvill now bake the case of Lustafa bin ^iDdul Latif* curing the last five years this merchant has oattened on the public and the war conditions and reaped huge profits. As a result of a speculative deal however he now linos himself in possession of a large quantity ot tea and no means ol evauin&amp; the control re 0 ulations which prevent him iron making a icr^e and easy profit. He has therefore appealed to the ioiitical authorities expecting them to modiiy the restrictions in his favour regaraless of the effect any such changes might have on the general market conditions and the repercussions on the public.° All he is concerned with is making a -profit. in his petition he pleads a hard luck story from Yifhich one might come to the conclusion that he is entitled to some relief. His account of the transaction however is by^no means correct. He states that he purchased the tea in 1942 and was prevented from disposing of it by the Government oi India order prohibiting all exports of tea. in actual fact he purchased this tea in April this year well knowing it to be frustrateQT^^e^', naving no unUersuandable reason to believe that it would not be subject to control when it reached the Trucial Coast and being in a position to know that all frustrated tea would be deoited to the Trucial Coast quota. ^ 'Your latter Ho.1622-29/17 to the Director of customs informing him of the release of frustrated tea for export CoC is dated the 16th of April. I enclose however a copy of ajletter X received by Damodardas Hemandas from his agent in India from which it will be seen that the Tea Controller warned the merchants about the disposal of frustrated tea in February 1945. g. The quota of tea for the period October 1944 to_ parch 1945 was 1,91648 lbs of which Lustafa bin Abdul Latif was allotted 14,799 lbs (viae my Express letter Mo.C61.1225 daced Oie 15 Oi of January 1345). gince uanuary 1945 however this merchant has imported 2,797 chests of tea i.e. about 2,50,000 lbs. most of which is frustrated tea. in other j words, since bhe 1st of January he has imported a quantity oi tea amounting to approximately 16 tinjes his allocated share of the last quofca and approxima uely 1«S times uhe quota for the/- ■^ II the whole Trucial coast for that period# All this frustrated \ tea which he has deliberately purchased will be debitea to the Trucial Coast quota and may well result in the cancellation of the regular quotas of other merchants who do not possess frustrated tea. - -If this should happen they will be debarred from from legitimate trade in tea and the market as a whole will,in any case be flooded with comparatively expensive frustrated tea (tea for^local consumption is controlled at w#l/ 8 /- per lb and for barter Ks#3/- per lb has been fixed). 9 . j would draw your attention to the invoice he has produced for one consignment of tea amounting to 1413 chests containing 113970 lbs of tea. I am inclined to doubt the itemss- (a) te. 28492- 8-0 On account of godo.n rent Insurance eh rges from 7/9/42 to 31/4/45. (b) ” 14246- 4.0 On account of renewal of quotas at Calcutta @ as. 2 /- per lb purchased against surrender of old quotas. (c) ' 19660-15-0 On account of insurance premium. Total ' 62399.11.0 * ^ 1 q. He has admitted before me that he purchased die tea in April 1945 from Lessrs. G*A» Handerian Ltd. and I therefore fail to see why he should pay all the insurance and godown charges since 1942 as separate items. Expenses on these accounts would normally be included in the purchase price of the tea. I also fail to understand why he stould have to pay hs. 14,246/4/- for renewing the quotas and I further doubt very much if he would cover the consignment by insurance for die journey to Dubai to the extent of paying ;s.l966o/15/— as premium. In other words, I am of the opinion that the invoice has been concocted with a view to obtaining more profit, when he represented his case befoi me l clearly explained bo him my views on ik his action in deliberately purchasing this large amount of frustrated tea and also expressed my doubts as to the genuineness of his invoice. He protested that when he purchased the tea he did not know that it would be debited to the Trucial Coast quota and that he was under the impression that it would not oe subject ac any control when it reached Dubai. I told him that I was not prepared to accept his explanation and uhat personally I did not consiaer bha/he was entitled to any relief but I left the matter open by saying bhat I would give it my further consideration. 11 . I calculated that by disposing of this consignment of tea under the existing controlled ratest&amp;}’43q % at 1 / 8 /- per lb and 56a % at 3/- per lb he would soand to lose about hs.38,000/- assuming of course that the invoice was correct. If however, as I suspect, ihe three items referred to above are fictitious, then he can still a profit of sorae hs.X4,000/-* After giving Hie matter careful thought I came to the conclusion that,, while personally I considered Lhat he should be heavily penalised for what he had done, dhere was officially no actual proof thac he'had not acted- In good faith^ although there was goc good reason to suppose that he had nob done so. I therefore decided that in the interest of trade it would be advisable to afford him some relief and I informed him that I was considering ways ana means which would, as far as possible, enable him to dispose of his tea without incurring excessive loss, but without raising ohe present controlled rates. 12. I decided against raising the price'of tea for local consumption for obvious reasons. I decided against raising the barter xyxxHM pdce because, apart from upsetting the barter system it vould not be possible for kustafa bin Abdul Latif to make good his losses in a short time. Bearing in mind that other merchants would also be taking advantage of any rise in the barber price, it would take him several months to dispose of suffleant tea to cover his losses, assuming of course that prices in Persia were sufficently high bo permit of che barter price being raised, prices in Persia however appear to be fluctuating rapidly and if the barter price is raised for one month/J)5&lt; 4 70 0 ) l month it may well have to be reduced uhe following monili to attract required commodities and keep the barker trade open# I therefore decided that, .in view of our large 3 cocks, the simplest solution would be to permit him to export privately a quantity of tea on the sale of which he would make sufficent •profit to cover the bulk of his supposed losses. If for example he were sennitted co dispose of 6000 lbs of tea, he should be able to realise a profit of about 6/- to 7/~ per lb. i.e. Rs*36,000/ 42,000/-* I have not passed final orders on this case and will refrain from doing so until I have had an opportunity of discussing the matter with you during your forthcoming visit. Other merchants whose genuine stocks of tea have been frozen since 1942 will also have to be afforded some relief and I proposed to adopt the sane procedure in their cases. The only' case which has been represented so far is that of Dhamanmal lesardas whose petition was forwarded with your endorsement ijq.2219-29/18-a dated the 3oth of Hay. I have informed his agent in Dubai that his case will be favourably considered when he produces an invoice for the frustrated tea in question. 13. I apologise for the length of this memorandum but the problem is somewhat complex and has,in my opinion, been rendered so la^^iy by the Tea Controller's apparent reluctance to supply timely informa-ion on the subject of quotas etc. I would'therefore request that these difficulties be represented to him with a strong request to follow the procedure surges^ed in para 4 or any other procedure which you may consider suitable.

A.C. As verbally ordered, I enclose herewith a translation of the letter received by us from Dubai with its original. I am much confident that you, as promised, will wire to Sharjah about this question. Tea - From enquiries we have made, they issued an order on the basis of 20% for the importers. Dhamanmal Isardas’ place also obtained a permit on this basis i.e. from 48,000 lbs, they got an optional sale permit for 9600 lbs. They previously had 2000 and now they got for 7600. But our place (has not been given) on the same basis, because according to the papers which we received (we have been granted) 8% according to them and no more. It means that from 207893 lbs. we got a permit for 16707 lbs. of which 5000 lbs we previously allowed and 11707 lbs, its permit was sent to us yesterday As a matter of fact this matter gives a comparison as the proverb says (the ceiling and the scattered air) otherwise how one has been given 20% and the other 8%. It is a strange thing. As the permit was sent to us about sunset, otherwise I was decided to go to Sharjah to investigate the matter myself. At the same time we learnt that the order had been issued from Bahrain and equality has been given to all at 20%, how do we get 8%. What is the cause and reason? This is an objectionable case, and I do not accept this. I have wired you in this connection to ihake enquiries on your side. If the Political Agency, Bahrain or the Political Agent, himself, fixed that quantity for us, and that we are different from others, we have no objection. But if it has been from other source, we have the right to object. My purpose is to inform me -detaily about your enquiries. U.E. Translation of copy of letter dated 30th Shaban 1364 received from Dubai. I consequently sent you a letter dated 28th instant, which Inshalallah has reached you. U.E.HT mm V AIRMAIL.

In your memorandum No. 768.1225 of 10th July 194-5&gt; your reasons, as I understand them, for recommending that this merchant should be singled out for differential treatment were that a) he bought the tea in April 194-5 only and the godown, insurance and charges for renewal of quota were concocted and not true b) frustrated tea, if it is to be counted against the regular quota, will in effect deprive regular importers of tea of their normal profits c) he has battened on the public during the war and reaped large profits. the frustrated tea was bought only in April 194-5 and whether you made similar enquiries regarding other merchants* purchases. 4.

Copy of a statement received from Tea Controller, showing allocations during 1944-45 and 1945-46 of regular and frustrated teas adjusted against the quotas for the Gulf Shaikh (toms during these two years is forwarded herewith. It will be seen from it that exports of frustrated teas to Muscat and Trucial Coast have exceeded the quotas for these places by 358,458 lbs. and 322,005 lbs.respective ly. 3. The Combibed Food Board have recently decided that quantities of frustrated teas exported to any destination during 1945-46 in excess of the quota for that place should be adjusted against the 1946-47 allocation. With a view to examining whether the Government of India, should ask for a reconsideration of this decision in so far as Muscat and Trucial Coast are concerned, as the effect of the decision on these places would be that they would hardly get any tea from Ihdia during 1946-47, they would like to be furnished with estimated minimum requirements for consumption in these places during 1946-47. 4 .

The file contains the correspondence of the Political Agent, Bahrain with the Political Officer for the Trucial Coast and the Residency Agent, Sharjah; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire and the Tea Controller for India, Calcutta. Included in the file are several circular lists compiled by the Tea Controller for India and the Political Agent, Bahrain. These lists show the tea quotas for the Trucial Coast shaikhdoms and neighbouring Arab States, the names of the Indian merchants in Calcutta and Bombay licensed to export tea to the Trucial Coast, details of shipments of tea and its distribution among Bahrain and Dubai merchants on importation.The file also contains copies of official correspondence between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and others, mainly Government of India officials in the Department of External Affairs, New Delhi. They discuss reductions in the Indian tea quotas allowed for export to the Trucial Coast for the following purposes: local consumption, re-export to neighbouring countries such as Saudi Arabia, as barter for fresh meat and other essential supplies from Iran, for consumption by the British Residency and Consulates of the Persian Gulf. The file also contains a small amount of merchant correspondence, mainly between the Chairman of the Persian Gulf States Pool (an association of Indian tea exporters), Calcutta and the Political Agent, Bahrain about the allocations of both regular quota tea and frustrated (spoiled) tea for export to the Trucial Coast.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Tea Controller for India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf States Pool, Chairman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Food resources</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Food statistics</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tea</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000b7#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
