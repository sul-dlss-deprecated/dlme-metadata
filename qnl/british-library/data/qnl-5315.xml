Do you see any local objection ? They might be useful elsewhere in emergency.Telegram From To No. Dated II C!ll Political Agent, Bahrain. Political Resident, Bushire. 158. 29th May 194'. Your telegram No.320 dated the 28th I &lt;• y. 2. I am not sure how to reply. While I appreciate obvious advantages and also that you probably have reasons of which I am not aware I fear proposal may do more harm than good. 3. Purpose of sending detachment here w ould need very careful explanation both to Shaikhs and public. If we say it is for internal protection Shaikhs would reasonably resent suggestion that internal situation is likely to pass beyond their control. If we were to give other reasons (or give no reasons at all) we might cause widespread alarm in all classes that we ourselves fear external attack. Finally propaganda would orobably be spread that we mistrust Shaikhs and Bahrain Arabs. 4. I will telegraph further after expected discussion * next week with Air Officer Commanding regarding possibilities of Local Defence Force — — ■■■IM/l-A 2S/1-B 28/l-C *yi rw. _ S, 28/1-D S- 28/1-E 28/1-F 2o/l-0 Wita P.A. 5 28/l-H 2b/1-I With p jr. r 28/1-J With P.A. | as/i-K 26/1-L \ 26/1-U 23/1-a 28/1-0 With P.A.

The Resident states that he is considering requesting a company of Indian infantry to be stationed in Bahrain, pending the formation of a local defence force, and asks the Political Agent if any local objection might be raised;the Political Agent’s reply to the Resident (f 3), dated 29 May 1940, in which the Agent suggests that the presence of such a force ‘may do more harm than good’, adding that careful explanation to the Shaikh and to the public would be required, and that mistrust and alarm might be the result;a typed list (f 4) of files in the War subject series (File 28). The list is similar to that given in Penelope Tuson,
                              The records of the British Residency and agencies in the Persian Gulf(London: India Office Library &amp; Records, 1979), with the exception that the list includes those files subsequently destroyed and thus not listed in Tuson. Some files in the list have pencil annotations in the margin reading ‘With P.A. [Political Agent] S.’ It is unclear why this file list is included in the file.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Army</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Indexes</topic></subject><subject><topic>Civil defence</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000033#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
