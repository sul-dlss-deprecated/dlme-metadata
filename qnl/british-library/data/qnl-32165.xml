V.ould you kindly see that on any occasion where I am likely to meet him 2 chairs of equal size are arranged as conversation on diferent planes is difficult, may be mistaken, but I think the idea is borrowed from ibn Gaud, who has these little thrones put up in each room that he is likely to go in, so that no one can sit in his seat. 2. fchile we are on this subject I may sey that I saw a picture in your office of some official occasion in which the Shaikh was sitting on a sort of Vtoolworth throne, while the Political Officer, 1 think Cole, sat so .ewhere down by his coat tails in an ordinary chair, cole was only an Assistant Political Agent at i&gt;ahrain, but i hope no Political Officer will ever put himself in such a ridiculous position again. I am afraid these idoas come frou belgrave, who is anxious to invest poor Shaikh Hamad with regal state, but nothing is further from the Arab mentality and Belgrave should De very firmly discouraged if he indulges in any more moves of this kind. If you get an opportunity you might mention the matter to hiu* and remind him that Bahrain is not in nuritania. Would you please have this letter filed where it will not be lost sight oi.

V,e have in the past on frequent occasions wished to honour certain of the roiling family or of the notables or those rendering to us or to our Government special service by granting them some personal and visible form of recognition. Vie find that this anniversary of our accession is a suitable occasion for introducing this order which we have caused to be made specially for us and which we have named the order ot the Khalifah. On Thursday, at the meeting at the xjaw courts we shall decorate our brother Sh.iiiohamad bin isa, who is the senior member of our family, with the Star oi the order a:,d we shall present the order and the medal to certain other persons who have rendered service to us and to our Government. Usual endingThe public are hereby notified Vhereas it is ci*ternary and expedient in many coun- tries of the world that the Soverign should confer on the princes of the blood and on the nobility and on those per sons who have rendered signal service to the State a visible form of recognition so therefore we have chosen this day on which we celebrate the Anniversary of our Accession, to institute and erect the Order of the nhalifah whereof we £ and our heirs shall be soverign. By our royal pleasure we do hereby decree that tne Order of the Khalifah shall eoneist of three degrees, the first being the Star of the order to be worn on the left breast, with the collar of the Order around the neck, the second being the Collar only and the third being the medal of the Order. \\e further enjoin and command the recipients of the Order to wear and display the insignia of the oraer on all official occasions whieh shall occur in our State.

Addressed to Secretary of State for India, repeated to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and Political Agent, Bahrain, We are informed hy Political Agent, Bahrain, that Reman Catholic Bishop from Aden has arrived in Bahrain to open newly- huilt church, and has “brought Insignia of Cavalier of St s Sylvester from the Pope for presentation to Sheikh, Sheikh who has been advised unofficially to decline is, however, intrigued by the idea, but states he will not accept it if Political Agent insists. 2. Case has been discussed with Prior in India. It has revealed that Sheikh, without giving any notice, has recently produced a new Bahrain Order, which he states he wishes to bestow on our officers. There is already a Muscat Order, but Muscat is an independent State. Prior is of opinion that proposed Order in Bahrain is objectionable and we agree. Case is somewhat similar to that of Mokalla reported in India Office letter No.P.Y„2308/39 of September 7th to the Colonial Office. Institution of Orders by Arab States under British Protection is likely to lead embarrassment with Indian Rulers in India. Acceptance of Order from the Pope by Sheikh of Bahrain will, moreover, encourage Sheikt/s wish to proceed with Order of his own. 3, Subject, therefore, to further views of Political Resident we recommend (a) that Sheikh should be instructed to refuse Order from the Pope and (b) that he should be informed that approval of His Majesty 1 e Government cannot he accorded to institution of Order of Chivalry by a Ruler of a State under His Majesty f s protection.

However, as the Colonial Office attached little importance to papal awards, and the Foreign Office did not expect to be consulted by the Vatican on awards to those not in the service of the Crown, the British Government decided not to intervene in the matter. The text of the papal award (in Italian), dated 25 September 1939, appears on folios 13-14. There was greater concern among British officials about the decision of Shaikh Hamad to institute the order of the Al Khalifah (text of
                           alan, dated 7 February 1940, folio 29). The papers include a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Geoffrey Prior, to the India Office, dated 14 March 1940, describing interviews he had held with both Charles Dalrymple Belgrave (the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain), and Shaikh Hamad, at which he expressed his concerns about the new award (folios 21-24). To the India Office, Prior stated that he hoped the award would lapse.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
