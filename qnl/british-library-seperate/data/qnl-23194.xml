It is noted that the HC Cruizer
                           Nautilushas been dispatched to Katiff [Al-Qaṭīf] with an invitation to join the General Maritime Treaty 1820, because the Resident has not been able to travel there in person.It is explained that the Resident has not been able to restore the Abou Semate tribe (also spelt Aboosemate) to favour with the authorities in Bahrain. It also notes that Shaikh Solaman been Ahmed, elder brother of Shaikh Abdoola [Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Aḥmad Āl Khalīfah], has died. The political consequences are therefore briefly outlined.The letter reports the Resident's view that the Persian Gulf is in a tranquil state, piracy has been curbed, and the 'allied tribes' have become accustomed to British mediation of disputes. It further explains that the Resident has had to correct a number of erroneous interpretations of the General Maritime Treaty among the Arab chieftains while at Sharga [Sharjah].It also enters into a discussion of whether or not the power of Sooltan been Suggar should have instead been allowed to grow unchecked, but concludes that it would have only led to increased piracy. It further raises questions as to how long Shaikh Tannoon [Ṭaḥnūn bin Shakhbūṭ Āl Nahyān] will remain subject to Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd, the Imam of Muscat.The item has four enclosures:1 - Letter from Ephraim Stannus to Shaikh Abdoola been Ahmed dated 23 February 1825.The enclosure is explaining that the Resident has had to depart for Bushire due to ill health. It also requests that the Abou Semate tribe is restored to favour, as they have already suffered extensively as a result of the Shaikh's wrath.2. Translation of a letter from Shaikh Abdoola been Ahmed, Bahrain to Ephraim Stannus dated 25 February 1825.The enclosure is explaining that the Shaikh is not currently in a position to safely pardon the Abou Semate tribe, as they have killed twenty-five men belonging to different tribes that must all be reconciled first; the Shaikh pledges to do all within his power to end the feud.3 - Letter from Ephraim Stannus to Shaikh Mohomed been Erraher, Katiffe dated 5 March 1825.The enclosure is explaining that the Resident has not been able to visit Katiffe (also spelt Catiffe), as a result of ill health. It explains therefore that Captain George Herne, Commander of the HC Cruizer
                           Nautilus, has been dispatched with an invitation to join the General Maritime Treaty. It notes that Katiffe is the only settlement on the southern coast that has not signed the treaty, and pitches the benefits of doing so.4 - Statement of Resident's expenses incurred during his tour of the Arabian coast dated 10 March 1825.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054665.0x000067#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
