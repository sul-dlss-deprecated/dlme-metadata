As tliG joui nGy was unclGrtalcGn with little or no warning', no proper instruments for surveying were procurable; a prismatic com pass, two pocket aneroid barometers, and an ordinary thermometer, were all I could collect. January 29th. Left the Telegraph Office, Shiraz, at quarter to 3 p.m., passed through a portion of the bazar and out of the town by the Ispahan gate, then turning to the right, following the load alongside the ditch of the town for three-quarters of a mile, taking a direction S. E., proceeded to the village of Jafferabad, 4£ miles from the gate, and 3f miles from the walls of the town. Hie load is quite flat, and for the most part passes through cultivated ground. Jafferabad is a small village, with a private house and garden belonging to a Shiraz merchant. January 30th .—Leaving Jafferabad at quarter to 9, arrived at Pul-a bridge. Pul-i-Fassa at ten minutes past JO : dis tance 5 miles. This bridge crosses a small stream, which runs into the salt lake some few miles further on. It rises in the marsh of Karabagh, some 6 miles to the westward. At present its waters are sweet, but as the season progresses they become brackish and undrinkable. The road from Jafferabad to the bridge ran through a perfectly level plain, marshy in places, with a slight salt efflorescence here and there. During heavy rains it becomes very soft, and the going is bad. Left Pul-i-Fassa at 11-20 ; rode along a level plain skirting the outlying spurs of Maharlu, until a point of the hill, projecting into the plain, was reached (4£ miles), direction to this point was E., afterwards it took a S. L. course ) on the one hand the road ran very close to the hills, and on the other to the salt lake. At 1-38 p.m. (8 miles from the bridge) reached a second point; this is the one seen fiom Shiraz. Hie load for some distance continued near to the hills, but afterwards the plain opened out, the road following the line of the lake; about 8 miles from the village of Maharlu, passed a place which is known as Dobeneh; there is no habitation.t I 2 * Taxes, f 1 Man=8Pbs but several disused wells and a couple of trees known as the bench, a class of wild pistachio. About 5 miles before reaching the village, passed through ground under cultivation which contin ued up to the village. Just before entering it, there was a small stream of water, clear and sweet. This stream is used some little distance up in the hills to drive a mill. At 3-40 p.m. arrived at Maharlu. The village gives its name both to the lake and to the hills above it. These are fine bold limestone bluffs standing some 4,000 feet above the plain of Shiraz. The weather was cold, cloudy and showery ; clouds prevented a good view of the distant hills. The village is in rather a tumble-down condition, built on each side of a dry watercourse. The people seem civil and friendly. It consists of about 80 houses, built of mud and stone, inhabited by some 350 people. Malyat * 11,500 krans ; 700 mans f of wheat and barley sown yearly; produce beyond that kept for home consumption is sent into Shiraz for sale. There are no mules, but about 1,000 donkeys, 40 oxen kept for tillage, and some 2,000 sheep are kept for food and produce; distance from Shiraz 23f miles. January 31st. — Left at 8-15 a.m. Weather cloudy and raining ; the distant hill not to be seen. For the first mile or two the road was somewhat stony; just outside the village crossed a small stream, which seemed to be strongly impregnated with sulphur. At 9-7 a.m., or after going miles, passed a village under the hills to yj £j ie a hout 2 miles off, called Posht-i-Par, consisting of about 20 houses. Direction of road here somewhat more easterly. 9-33 p asse d a road on the right hand going to Kharanjan, a village in the plain. Road now on a smooth plain, bearing south east again, going very easy. 9-53 a.m. passed a village and garden v»jG quite close to the road, called Bukat, about 100 inhabitants. 10-S a.m. passed level with end of the salt lake, and shortly came on to ground which much resembled the Bushire Masheelah, but not quite so bad; followed this until 11-45 a.m., then came on to a smooth plain with some little scrub. At 12-45 p.m. arrived at Khairabad; the road level and easy the whole way. The people of the village civil and quiet; the village consists of about 20 houses built of mud bricks, the whole surrounded by a high wall, with towers at each corner; 100 inhabitants. 2-15 p.m. started again. The road led over easy country, covered with short brush wood (butah).The general aspect of the ground and hills very similar to that about Murchichoor.* 3-11 p.m. passed „*'r the smai1 ° f K “ ao - a ' “b™ 4 to Teheran. this portion of the road the supply of water is good; there are several kanats of good water. 3-50 p.m. passed the village of Huseinabad. 4-25 p.m. Katah Gumbaz, a village of certain pretentions, was reached. Here also was good water. After leaving this village came into country which was well cultivated, chiefly with tobacco; a small canal of running water ran close beside the road the whole way up to Sarvistan, where we arrived at 5-45 p.m. Distance from Maharlu 251 miles. The whole road is perfectly flat and easy going, being part of the Shiraz plain. That portion which resembles the Masheelah has been caused, I imagine, by the decrease in the waters of the salt lake. To this point wheeled carts could be easily brought. Sarvistan is apparently a thriving place, consisting of about 300 houses, with a population of 1,000 people. It is divided into four parishes; 1,500 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly; 2,500 donkeys; no mules or camels; 52 oxen for tillage; malyat 1,500 tomans. There are some 150 gardens, containing chiefly pomegranate and walnut trees; there are some few date-palms, but these do not bear fruit. The houses are mainly built of sun-dried bricks; gatch (plaster of Paris) is obtainable from the surrounding hills. The water is good. The people seem civil enough, but they have the name of being a wild, turbulent lot. The temperature of this place seems milder than Shiraz. The date-palms appear to grow better, and I noticed myrtle growing freely. I have never yet succeeded in keeping any in Shiraz through the winter. February 1st. — Left at 10-5 a.m. Road bearing south-east through a level plain, somewhat stony in places. After going 41 miles came to a deep gully, with a small stream of water at the bottom. After going another three-quarters of a mile, passed a se cond stream, and immediately entered some low hills, which the road passed through, and gradually ascending for some 2f miles we camped at a Bourgt on the side of the •j* Tower, • . y 0 Kuh-i-Siah, another Bourg being on the top of the spur. The whole of this piece of country resembles the bit of road on the top of the gatch hills between Kauiaridj and Kazerun. 1 &lt;j&gt;*54 A short, easy ascent took us to the top of the pass which is about the same height as the Bourg. Thence the road took a south-south-easterly direction, and winding for some miles among low hills, crossed a small stream. Aspect of road and country here very similar to that of * On the road between Shiraz j Seena h_Sefid.* The country be- nnd Hus hire, near to Dasht “ j c Arjin. tween the road, which runs almost along the side of the Kuh-i-Siah and the hill on the left, is completely seamed with gullies and watercourses, and has a very tumbled- about appearance. A little pick and shovel work in places would make this por tion of the road available for wheeled carriages. It is, however, the roughest part that we have as yet crossed j it is on the whole fairly level, and there are no abrupt ascents or descents. The hills are everywhere more or less wooded with wild almond and wild pistachio. After crossing the stream, for 4 miles the road passed through a semi-sort of jungle of the above trees until reaching J&amp;a. Meyan-Jangal. This is but a ruined caravanserai in the middle of the plain, as its name indicates. A Tofangchi tower has been built out of the debris. Facing what was the doorway of the caravanserai, about 2 &gt; yards away, is an Imam-Zadeh. Distance from Sarvistan 16£ miles. February 2nd, temper ature at 8 a.m. 42 3 . It froze heavily during the night. Started at 8-3 a.m. The road ran through a level plain, dotted here and there with a few trees, for about 3 miles, then it entered some small hills, and gradually ascending for If miles, came on to a sort of plateau, when a small stream was crossed. The country now became more thickly wooded with wild almond and wild pistachio trees. The road was somewhat stony, winding in and out of small hills. The next 3£ miles was a gentle ascent to the top of a Tang.f The gradient very easy. The whole ascent was not so steep as that of the Kinar-i-Gird hills from the Tehran side. Country pretty, somewhat like that x Part of the road near to between Meyant Moollah and Khaneh Delibeea on the Tehran to , . Shiraz road. Kergoon. 1 he whole road practical for two-wheeled carts; direction south- south-east. About a mile beyond the top of the Tang, came to a deserted and almost ruined caravanserai by the roadside. The aspect of the hills somewhat rounder than those previously seen ; they were also more thickly wooded. Just behind the caravanserai was a good spring of water. The snow line seems to be some 500 feet above this point. After leaving the caravanserai, the roadj gradually descended, skirting the bases of a series of low gravel hills, until it came out on the Fassa plain. It had been somewhat stony, but now became less so. The country among the hills resembled greatly the Khaneh Zenian plain. The last 5 miles something like the descent from Gabrdbad to Kashan, but not so steep. The general view of Fassa not unlike Kazerun. Date-palms grow all over the place. Fassa seems to be in a most flourishing condition. The houses well built, and the streets somewhat cleaner than the generality of Persian towns. People all were most civil and obliging. Great quantities of wheat, barley, and opium grown. There are no spe cial industries in the place; the whole of the working population appear to be engaged in agriculture. Temperature here much milder than that of Shiraz; as early as this, one is able to sit with windows open during the day. Roses and hyacinths already in full bloom. Distance from Meyan Jangal 17! miles. Fassa is the name of the district as well as of the town. It is under the Kawam-ul-mulk, who keeps a naib or lieutenant in the town. Population of town about 5,000; 1,000 houses. Population of district from 35,000 to 40,000. The district comprises 31 villages, Wz., Rownez-i-Bala, Rownez-i-Pyne, 'Aliabad, Deh-i-Naw, Teng- kerm, Katchaya, Akbarabad, Banyan-i-Kushk, Kasr-i-Keram, Harun, Sararud, Dasticheh, Feruzadmard, Sa’adabad, Muhammed- abad, Fedish-koh, Zahadan, Senan, Kangan, Kharan jan, Meyandeh, Nasirabad, Nabandagan, Ghiyasabad, Sheshdeh, Akbarabad-i- ^ Skeshdeh, Darimy, Darakuhyeh, Dowlatabad, Jelyan, Sheikhabad; at all these villages barley and wheat are sown in quantities of' il *''^ su ' 100 mans to 1,000 mans yearly. Great quantities of opium are also sown. Fassa opium is perhaps the best of any produced in Persia. Labourers^ wages range between 15* shahies and 1 kran per # diem. Provisions of all sorts are very plentiful; water is good and in fair quantity, chiefly brought into the plain by kanats. The gardens about the town and villages are filled with fruit trees of all de scriptions. The date-palm here bears fruit. Maly at 180,000 krans per annum. February 4th .—Left Fassa at 11 a.m. The road runs through a level plain of apparently rich alluvial soil, everywhere being well cultivated with barley, wheat, and opium, and in some cases Indian-corn. After going for half an hour (If miles! passed the village of Nasirabad; Fedishkuh, 1 mile, and ^Aliabad, 3 miles away to the right. 12-25 p.m. passed Harun (5 miles). err 0 * iS 8 * iblk-Jo • y f ibShortly after leaving this village, the road took a south-easterly direction, and the dry bed of a stream was crossed. Still keeping to the plain, and through heavily cultivated ground, passed by the village of Ghiyasabad, the road here getting somewhat more to the south. At 2-30 p.m. arrived at the village of Nabandao-an distance 13 miles. Nabandagan is a large and prosperous walled village, almost worthy of the name of town ; it contains 700 houses with a popu lation of 8,500 people; 3,000 mans of wheat and barley and 500 mans of poppy-seed are sown yearly. The village owns 88 oxen lor tillage, 4,000 sheep, and 4,000 donkeys; no mules. Carts could be brought here from Fassa without any difficulty. The village, however, is about half a mile from the main road, which runs along the base of some low hills nearly straight to Jelyan. Water is plentiful along the whole road. The plain has numerous villages dotted over it, and also a number of watch-towers, but the latter are falling into ruin. The plain of Fassa is completely surrounded by hills, and pre sents somewhat the appearance of an elongated diamond. It is probably about 20 miles long east to west, and 12 broad north to south. February 5^.—Left at 9-35 a.m. For 3| miles the road contin ued along the plain up to the village of Jelyan, which was passed on the right hand. After going another mile, rounding some low hills, the bed of a river, about 80 yards across, was passed; there was scarcely any water in it, even at this time of the year. Shortly afterwards (three-quarters of a mi lei we came to a fair stream, crossed by a very primitive sort of bridge; three quarters of a mile' further on and the village of Mordi was reached. The stream ran by the side of the road the whole way, and is known by the same name as the village. The village only contains 50 houses, 150 people; 2,000 mans wheat and barley and 70 mans of poppy' seed are sown yearly; also some Indian-eorn, 20 oxen, and 600 sheep are owned by the village, but no donkeys or mules. After going another 2 miles along the base of some low hills, * Defile. we entere&lt; f a somewhat narrow Tang ;* the road here was rather stony. The Tang extended for about a mile, the hills on the left side being somewhat precipitous for the last half mile, those on the right sloping and broken. Along the sides of the Tang I noticed the remains of an aqueduct generally built up of stone and mortar, but in some places cut out of the rock. This is said to have been built and carried along the sides of the hills right down into the7 plain of Danil&gt;, to supply that place and llassanahad with water. I could not learn about what time it was supposed to have been built. Having passed through the Tang, we came out on the plain of Sheshdeh. An easy ride of 3 miles, along a level and good road, brought us to the village of that name. Distance 12 miles. Sheshdeh is a large and prosperous place, but the people are of a somewhat forbidding caste of countenance, and appear to be inclined to be rude and uncivil, differing from the other villagers we have come across in this respect. The village contains 200 houses, 700 people; 6,000 mans of wheat and barley, and 80 mans of poppy.seed are sown yearly. The villagers possess 60 oxen, 1,500 sheep, and 50 donkeys, but no mules. February Sa.—Left at 8-30 a.m. The road from the village of Sheshdeh to that of Akbarabad took a course nearly due east. The latter village was reached at 9-15 a.m. (2| miles), it then diverged to the south-east until the Kaladi Karabulagh was reached at 11-2-3 a m. (7 miles). This is a sort of rallying place of the black tents; it consists of a largo tower in the centre, surrounded by four high walls flanked by towers ; in the space between the centre tower and the walls are one or two wells of good water. It belongs to the Kawam-ul-Mulk. When we passed, there were in, or about it. 400 tents, 2,000 people, owning 50 span of oxen, 5,000 sheep, and 200 donkeys; 700 mans of wheat and barley are sown yearly. The plain has numerous watercourses, some dry, some with running water. We also noticed numbers of wells about this portion of it. A he soil of this plain appears to be exceptionally good, richer than any previously noticed in Persia, nearly approaching that of the black-earth zone of Southern Russia. Left the Kalafli at 12-40 p.m., and at 1-19 p.m. passed a small open village called Tangabad. This may be considered to be at the entrance of the defile, called Tang-i-Rulaghy. From this point the hills closed in rapidly. 2-5 p.m. arrived at the village of Darakuyeh. Distance 13 miles. The village is but a small one and somewhat dilapidated. It contains 100 houses, 300 people, 8 span of oxen, 400 sheep, 50 donkeys. Malyat 1,500 krans; 1,500 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly. February till. Left at 8* 7 a.m. Before reaching the top of a small kotal* the road passed through some low hills, and over somewhat £2b Sy ijJS * Pass.8 stony ground. The pass took nine minutes to walk down and four to walk up the other side. It was a deep ravine, which evi dently carried off the drainage of the hills and plain, down into the Darab plain. The road then followed the side of the hills on the left hand for half a mile; then a short turn to the south-south east of a quarter of a mile brought it to the top of the descent into the Darab plain. Twenty-one minutes walking down an easy, but in places somewhat rocky, descent brought one on to the plain. This portion of the road would present some difficulties to wheeled vehicles, but a little work would soon make it practicable, except at the small kotal, where they would have to be unladen, or, if it were necessary, the ravine, I think, could easily be crossed by a light bridge. The country at the head of the pass * A pass on the road between ,1 I i ji j i i i i Shiraz and Bushire. greatly iTsemblGs that above and below the Kotal Dokhtar.* Close to the foot of the descent into the Darab plain, we passed two conduits built of stone and mortar; these are said to have been built in connection with the aqueduct previously referred to. 10-50 a.m. passed the village of Hassanabad, and at 11 a.m. stopped near a small Imam-Ladeh ; distance 9| miles. The plain about here is covered with fine well-grown Konar trees, and also with clumps of still finer myrtles. The soil appears to be fine alluvial, givingcrops of great richness. The plain is well watered by numerous small streams of good water. Many villages and gardens in every direction ; also many camps of Eeliants. The hills on the left hand, along the bases of which the road runs, are very fine indeed, presenting to the eye a succession of rugged crags with perpendicular sides. They show much more character than is usual in Persia. For the most part they appear to be pure limestone. Left at 12-12 p.m. llode along a road at times slightly stony near to the base of the hills. At 1-25 crossed the Chashma Gulabi, a fine spring which issues from the base of the hill ; the water was beautifully clear and limpid, the excess forms a small stream which runs off into the plain and makes a marsh of some size. 1-47 p.m. passed a hill which appeared to consist of nothing but V fine salt. It is called Kuh-i-Nimuk. The many various colours, together with its numerous sharp pinnacles, standing out against the dark background formed by the hills behind, made it a very lemaikable object in the landscape. 2-5 p.m. passed another fair stream. 2-40 p.m. passed the village of Bakht-i-Gird on the right about a mile in the plain. 3-20 came in sight of the Kala^h Dardb, US9 a garden above the town under the Kuh-i-Ma’adan. Soon after wards, passing between two small hills, came on to the town, where we arrived at 4-30 p.m., and got to the above Kala^h, passing first through the whole length of the town at 4-45 p.m. Distance 24 miles. The garden is full of date, orange, lemon, and rose trees. The plain through which we have ridden generally resembles that of Kazerun, but the trees are all more fully grown. Owing to the mild temperature of the place, lemons are to be found on the trees ripening all the year round. Eeliants pitch their camps and remain here all through the year. From the foot of the pass the country again admits of wheeled carriage being used. The hill above the town is called Kuh-i-Ma'adan, because of the number of mines in it. It is said that copper, iron, and silver are all to be found here. None are being worked at the present time^ nor have they been for a great number of years. Almost in the middle of the plain one cannot help noticing a small isolated hill with two peaks; when one approaches it, you perceive that it has been once surrounded by a high wall. This place is known as the Kala'h Darai. Tradition has it that it was built by Darab, the King of Persia, known by us as Darius Coda- manus, in all probability. I have not been able to trace this, how ever, in any of the Persian geographers. The town of Darab, or rather Darabgird, as it should be written^ is not so well built as Fassa: the houses are mostly built of mud and stones ; very few of kiln-burnt bricks were to be seen. The main street is long and straggling, and there is not a proper bazar; but owing to the gardens, which are numerous and apparently thriv ing, it appears to cover a lot of ground. The date-palm flourishes here; so also do apricots, peach, plum, almond, and pistachio trees, and on the hill-sides grape vines. The town proper contains 1,000 houses, with a population of 6,010 ; malyat 24,000 tomans, 400 donkeys, 4,000 sheep. Provisions of all kinds plentiful. Houses are built of sun-dried bricks. Gatch can be obtained from the hills; kiln-burnt bricks 15 krans per 1,000 ; sun-dried 2 krans per 1,000; labourers hire 10 to 15* shahies per diem. The following are the villages of the district of Darabgird :— Dobarun. Raheinabad. Harbadan. Dabiran. Maryan. yijJs Kalahno. Meyanshakh. Dashtiband. Kalmadan.

The walls, which evidently were simply mounds dug out of the plain and thrown up, leaving on the outside a ditch of about 40 feet broad, must have been at least 20 feet high. Within the enclosure, as near as possible in the middle, are two small rocky hills. On one, the higher and southern-most, standing about 100 feet above the plain, there are the remains of some build ings, and also a well. The building is, so to speak, modern, built of unfaeed stone and mortar. At one point there are the remains of a brick building, but the bricks used are of the modern size. Running straight from this hill to what undoubtedly was a gate, are the remains of an aqueduct: beyond the walls some of it sup ported on arches still remains. The style of building and materials is similar to that on the top of the hill. Around the base of the hill and all about inside the walls, are numerous small mounds, but none of sufficient size to cover the ruins of an Achscmenian palace of even minor importance. After searching the whole place most carefully and examining the rocks all about, not the slightest trace of a stone-mason's handiwork could be found : the rocks show no sign of ever having been touched. All about the enclosure were numerous pieces of brick, some of the size now used, others consi- •derably larger; pieces of tiling were also occasionally to be picked up.The place did not give one the idea of any great antiquity. It doubt less belongs to the Sassanian period, and not to the Achsemenian, as we surmised and hoped. February 11th .—Left at 10-30 a.m., went round the hills to the south to see what is known as the Naksh-i-Darab. After riding for an hour and a quarter round the base of the hills, came to the Naksh. In a sort of bay of the hills, above a very fine clear pool of water, a piece of rock has been squared away, measuring some 12 to 14 feet in length by 9 feet in height. On this a fine bas-relief has been carved. In the centre is a figure, life-sized, seated on a somewhat small horse. It has the large globular head-dress and bunch of curly hair rendered familiar to us in the various other bas- reliefs at Shah pur, Naksh-i-Rustam, Naksh-i-Rejeb, and on the coins of the various Sassanian kings. The figure faces to the right; its left hand is advanced and rests lightly on the head of a man, its right hand is advanced and seemingly holds a sort of short truncheon. A collar of pearls is around the neck, and the cloak llowing behind is fastened with a double clasp. The breeches also are very full and flowing. The horse is heavily caparisoned. The large horse-hair ornament attached to the saddle cloth is especially conspicuous. As far as the horse and rider is concerned, this bas- relief resembles very closely that at Naksh-i-Rejeb {vide Porteris Travels, plate 28). In front, just by the horse's head, is a figure of a man in Roman dress with a Roman sword; he is holding up his hands pleadingly. Next to this figure is that apparently of a woman. It is slightly to the left front of the horse's head. Next to this comes the figure of a man upon whose head the left hand of the mounted figure rests. He looks beseechingly up into the face of the main figure, holding his right hand up to heaven. The face is clean shaved, except a fringe round the cheeks and under the chin; the hair of the head is close cropped. Behind him, going up to the top of the Naksh, are 23 heads, some with part of the shoulders and breast visible; these are somewhat crowded together. The drapery over their shoulders is something like that of a monk's, especially in the case of the first of these figures. Behind the horseman is a group of soldiers in four tiers of three each, mounting to the top and filling up the left-hand side of the Naksh. They have all high-rounded hats, flowing mous taches, and curly long beards; their hands rest on the hilts of their swords, which are straight. Their dress comes down nearly to the knee : the trowsers are somewhat full; round their ankles are straps with buckles. Under the horse's feet is a dead man. In the right-12 hand lower corner is the figure of a horse, smaller than that on which[the main figure is mounted; it has a hogged mane; between its legs is a circle with spokes, probably meant to represent a chariot wheel. The whole bas-relief is exceedingly well cut and in very good preservation, all the faces except that of the central figure having escaped the iconoclastic hands of the Mahomedans. About an hour’s ride further on, along the same hills, which have many beautiful springs, brought us to the place known as the caravanserai. In a somewhat larger bay in the hills a place has been cut out of the live rock. The st'ne quarried out has been used for building up portions of this place and for part of the roof. Nothing similar to this building has ever been noticed by me in Persia. It may have been used as a mosque, a house, or caravan serai, or perhaps a church. To this, however, I shall refer later on. It is in the shape of a cross, the doorway facing nearly due south, the whole cross almost coincident with the four points of the compass. The length 26 yards and breadth 23 yards, width of centre aisle yards, width of cross aisle 4 yards. In the centre there is therefore a space 5 £ yards by 4 yards ; this rises straight up to a height of 22 to 25 feet; it is now uncovered, but originally was closed by one big stone. Prom about 9 feet above the ground, arches spring up to the height of about 6 feet, thence to the opening it is square. On each side of both the aisles there are two small arches, which lead to a small gallery about 4 feet high, going all around the place, except at the end of the aisle facing the east. Here there is a place which at first looks like an old English fire-place, but it has no outlet for smoke, and does not show signs of having ever been used for fire. Around the top of this is a stone ornamentation with carving; the stone is whiter and softer than that of the building. The carving, which is about ten inches broad, consists of some writing in the Naksh characters : on half the top and the right-hand side the carving was completely obliterated, but on the remainder the words Mohammed, Hassan, Fatima, and Amir-ul-Mumenin, were to be distinguished. On a sort of frieze inside there was similar carving, but this was quite undecipherable. Over the main doorway, and on each side of it, there is also an inscription in the same character; of this only the word Mohammed could be read. The stone on which this is carved is that of the rock, a dark stone, and apparently very hard. About 20 paces from the entrance of this building is a small archway, which leads into an arched room about 15 feet long by 10 broad. This has been cut very neatly out of the rock.13 All the stone of the main building is clean cut and faced; at the spring of one of the arches there is some slight attempt at ornamentation. Nowhere could I discover writing of any sort other than that referred to above. About 200 yards away in a second hay of the hills and some what behind the caravanserai, is a chamber roughly cut out of the rock, or it may be a natural cave. This has been used as a mill. f A watercourse has been led down from the hill immediately above it to two large deep cisterns, some 20 feet deep by 8 in diameter. The surplus water was led off by a course built along the hill side ; it could be traced winding away along the base of the hills for some 2 miles, and we were informed that originally it went as far as Deh Khayr, 7 miles distant. Above the entrance to this cave was a Naksh inscription of the same size as that over the doorway of the church, but only a letter or two here and there could be made out. All about the foot of the hills and for some 2 or 3 miles in the plain, there are small mounds and traces of habitations, point ing to the fact that once a big town existed here. Careful search among the hills failed to discover any inscrip tion which would throw any light on the subject. Deh Khayr is a prosperous place with many gardens, and also some signs about that once it had been a big place. Passed in the plain several remains of the watercourse above referred to. The village contains 200 houses, 500 people, 50 span of oxen, 100 donkeys, 550 sheep, malyat 13,000 krans. The village is the property of the people inhabiting it; 7,500 msins of wheat and barley sown yearly. Distance 10 miles. February 15^.—Left at 7-53 a.m. The road ran through a level plain for about 7 miles, when about a quarter of a mile to the left, the village of Fathabad was passed. Almost directly after, it entered between some low hills, outside of which were numerous low mounds; also evidences of former buildings were noticed. At the immediate entrance to the hills there were the ruins of a large mill. After following for a mile or so, the dry bed of a stream again came out on to the plain. The road from this point made a somewhat ser- 4' pentine course to obviate some insignificant hills. At 12 p m. passed a ruined village and halted at a Bourg, slightly off the road, where there was some water. 2 p.m. started again. The southern hills here began to converge rapidly, and the plain, which before was very open, narrowed considerably. After going 7 miles came to some low hills, spurs of the above, and descending by an easy gradient between two of them, came into a narrow valley with a14 ( small village in its centre called Chahardang, leaving this on the ^ ^ left and following the valley for a mile, crossed over a small hill; jUj O'fter going for another hour got to the village of liosak. Dis tance 28 miles. The village is in a very tumbled-down condition, with no accommodation, but it is very picturesquely situated. The hills to the north are high and bold; those to the south, whilst of in ferior height and much broken up, some with a considerable amount of scrub, have abrupt sides and sharp bold peaks. In the valley itself, clumps of myrtle, with several large isolated konar trees, aided the picture, whilst a good deal of cultivation, with a fair stream of clear water running through the centre, completed it. In no place was the road impassable to wheeled carts, nor is there a difficult place about it. The village contained 100 houses, 300 people, 40 span of oxen, 4.000 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly, 400 sheep; malyat 50.000 mans of grain; no donkeys or mules. February 13th ,—From Rosak to Forg there are two roads,—one by a Gardeneh, which, I was told, was 4 Farsakhs, and one by a Tang, 5 larsakhs. I was told that the latter was the easier, and was more or less level the wholeway, but that it was full of turns and twists. The shorter road appeared to me to be better suited to a telegraph line, so 1 went by that. Left Rosak at 8-7 a.m. For the first 5 miles the road ran through the valley, level and easy-going; the country gra dually became very confined. At 10 o’clock, or after going G miles, began to ascend gradually over a very stony road, and at 10-30 came to the head of the Gardeneh, called the Gardeneh Bezan-i-Forg. The -9 ascent is very gradual and easy, but the road is rocky and bad. The * A place on road from Shiraz ® Unlike that about the to Busbire. 1 er i-zan,* but the trees are not so thick* nor is the ascent nearly so steep or long. Near the top I saw buried in the ground some khumerahs to collect water, similar to those w T hat Chardin describes as having seen between Lar and B’ Abbas. These are the first that I have ever come across. About 100 yards futher on, was a small tank, here w'e breakfasted. The tank was in bad repair, and the klmmerahs broken, no one seeming to care to repair them. The khumerahs must have been in this place a long time, as they appear to be very old. The guide said that they had only lately been discovered. 11 45 started again. Road all down hill, a long but not very steep descent, somewhat stony. This may be likened to the bit of 4 ♦15 road from Moyan Kotal to the Dasht-i-Barm,* but it is not quite * A part of road between SO stony. At 1-5 P.M. got right down sidraz and Kuyeroon. into the plain, and at about miles off had Forg before us; an easy hour’s ride took us in. The plain is nearly circular, witli Several date topes about. We also saw two blue-domed Imamzadehs in the distance. The village of Forg is square, walled in by mud walls, with flanking towers, a gate with flanking towers, on its east and west faces. The houses are all built of mud or else sun-dried bricks; the best of them seem to be but a broken down concern. The place is in anything but a prosperous condition. The peo ple, however, were very civil and obliging. Water seems very plentiful, several small but good streams running through the streets. Provisions also in abundance and cheap. Distance 1-1 miles. Forg contains but 100 houses, 500 people, 40 span of oxen, cows for milk 300, sheep 300 ; no donkeys or mules ; 4,000 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly; malyat 5,000 krans. Sun- dried-bricks cost 2 krans per 1,000; gatch procurable from the hills about. Labourer’s pay 5 to 7 shahies per diem. Rafters 15 shahies to 1 kran each, but these arc only al&gt;out 10 feet long; they are cut in the hills and brought in. In conversation with the Chief Fath Ali Khan, a powerful man, who has all this district, in cluding Lar, under him, he pays yearly over 1,000,000 krans malyat to Government. I read out to him the names on the map between this and Lar; he did not recognise one of them, and gave me the following as being the correct stations between the two places :— Farsaklia. Cbahnahr ........ 4 Feduny ........ 3 Barkam ........ 5 Sh^hgheb ... ..... 3 Tang-i-nuyeh ........ 5 Kahneh ........ 2 Lar 2 February 16th .—Left at 7-30 a. m. After going 3 miles, came to a hill on the right, on which were the remains of a ruined castle, and at the foot of it a number of mounds and other signs of a town. The place is known as the Kala’h Rahman. The hill is some 180 feet high, and, together with the ruins about its foot, covers a considerable amount of ground. All over 81A ■ ■ • '16 the hill facing the east are ruins of towers and walls, built of rough, unhewn stones and lime. To the west it is quite precipitous, and is only guarded by a wall, which follows the line of the crest from the flanking walls. This wall is terminated at its southern end by a large tower. J ust below it is a large and deep chasm; this was in all probability a well. Near it is an excavation in the rock and hill-side, built up with stones and mortar, where it was necessary; 18 yards by 7 ; this was a large tank. In front of this again is a small conical hill, upon which was a small house of four rooms, the front one looking east, being 21 feet long by 10 wide, and the three back ones about 10 feet square. Around the foot of the hill are the remains of a wall of stones and mortar, similar to that on it; beyond this wall again, but starting from the same point at the northern end of the hill, is a wall which encircles the whole b:ise of the hill at a distance of some 400 yards; it rejoins the defences of the hill at a bastion on a spur at the southern end. In this enclosed space are many mounds of various sizes, and one larger than the others; apparently has had a wall of its own to protect it. On the hill top, at the southernmost point, is a platform with a well; beyond, outside of the wall, near to this is a small tank with remains of a small room still standing. The place at the foot of the hill, which seemingly has once been surrounded by a wall, is now known as the Hammam. Remains of pillars of gatch and brick still exist; it is built on a slight elevation, and the surrounding wall is built of stone and gatch. In all probability this was the principal building in the place, as immediately in front of it there is a tank, and beyond that the gateway in the outer wall. This outer wall was also built of stone and mortar; the gateway has either had an advanced fort to pro tect it, or else the mounds around it are the remains of the be siegers' works. Some little distance in the plain, about 500 yards from the gateway, are three circular piles of large white stones; in the centre of each circle is a small, round hole. Tradition has it that from this point the besiegers commenced their mining operations, and so worked their way to within the inner fortifications Near to the hill, and running from the spur to the right, are the remains of an aqueduct; quite close to this is a second one in good condition with water in it. It crosses the roadway by means of a series of archways of fair span, and well constructed. It is as good a piece of work as I have seen in the country. I imagine that the fort and remains belong to the Sassaniaa period, if not17 even later. They are of the same class of work as the Kala'h Darab. 10-45 a.m. again started on the road, which ran for 2f miles across a level plain. It then entered some low hills and soon got into an intricate mass of ravines and gullies. About as ugly a piece of country as I have ever seen, even in this country of excessive ugliness, it was an accentuat- # A bit of the Kavier near to i i*.- £ o.i • nr i i i Teheran. e&lt; l edition or the Derreh-i-Malek-el- Mout.* After going through this for an hour, we got into a narrow defile between two long low hills. The whole place seemed as if the earth had been placed in a colos sal furnace and then thrown out anyhow by the spade of a Cyclops. The defile took an hour and three-quarters to get through ; it was very narrow, with scarcely room in some placee for two horses to pass. The hills on each side were not more than 80 to 100 feet high, with jagged tops; they seemed as if they had only been forced by some convulsion of nature out of their original positions within a few hours. Another half hour’s rough going over and around hills and up and down ravines, we came out on a small level plain. It took just an hour to cross it; we then crossed over the slope at the bottom of some hills; this was cut up in every direction by watercourses, and apparently, by the number of round stones about, at certain times must be swept by floods. Another hour’s ride brought us to Taskat, which is a village some 3 miles off the main road. The place is very dilapidated, with no good roads ; it has, however, a very fine date grove. Distance 191 miles. I hear that there is another road from Forg, somewhat to the south of the one I came, the guide having brought me this way, as it was the shorter. The two roads bifurcate at the entrance to the hills. The southern one is level and not stony. It is, however, about a Farsakh longer. By the road I came it would be nearly impossible to take wheeled carts. An intelligent man of mine who followed the longer road, tells me that they could go by it without any difficulty. The charvador followed the latter road. February 17th.—heit at 7-25 a.m. The road was only a track across the plain, which was covered with low scrubs. After going 2 miles we came to some low hills, and passing through them for half a mile came out into the Dasht-i-Tashkurd. A long level plain, about 50 miles in length and some 15 broad, I should say; at the far end (N. N. W.) is the Balook-i-Fardany; 7 miles off, somewhat more northerly, is the village of Dasht-i-Konar, oppo site nearly due south a long range of hills called Galagah; this $ ^ B18 range seemed to bound the southern side of the plain for its whole length. We followed the plain along the base of some low hills on the left hand until £-30 p m. Distance 19 miles. The plain is covered in nearly every direction with salt efflores cence, and in some parts the going is very soft, but easy carts could be used without difficulty, except during rainy weather. Just before turning to the north-east, around a point of the hills, came to the direct road to Forg. After passing this point the plain opened out to the north, going then for 7 miles further, came ^ to Said Jowdar, a poorish village with a good date grove. There were no provisions of any sort to be got; the water, however, was good, and there seemed plenty of it. A small stream from the hills, Taskat. Malyat 1,080 krans, 70 houses, 2 )0 people, 100 sheep, £0 oxen; 1,000 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly. No accommodation. Houses, date huts. February 18th .—Morning very cloudy. Said Jowdar, 100 houses, 300 people, 100 sheep, 4£ oxen; 1,500 to £,000 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly. Running water ; no provisions in shape of straw or barley. Left at 7-£5 a. m., across the same plain, quite level, with a great deal of salt incrustations about. Generally like the country between Bo'asjoon and Ahmedy. After riding for an *01 £*5) hour passed the small village of Rafeeabad with the village of ^ Karkun, about £ miles to the north-east, both with good date plan tations ; about the plain date topes were to be seen in every direc tion. At 9-10 a.m. passed the road from Tarun to Lar. 9-54 a.m. came on to the direct road from Forg to Bundar Abbas. This, however, has no villages on it, and seems only to be used by Feli- ants. 10-££ a.m. crossed a small stream; at 10-35 passed a larger branch of the same river, both quite salt; the latter about 10 feet wide with a depth of 6 or 7 inches. At 11-48 arrived at the village obi cyol*- of Sa'adatabad. Distance 13^ miles. The plain is all more or less salt, very soft, and after heavy rains would be very bad-going in deed. It is cut up by several watercourses. Rains, however, do not bother this part of the world much; the people tell me that they have had none here for 18 months. I imagine this must be taken to mean that they have had no heavy prolonged rains, as I noticed signs of somewhat recent showers. The KalaTi of Sa’adatabad t is completely in ruins; the people all living in date huts. There is a very fine stream of water running- through the place. The latter part of the plain, within some £ miles of the village, is covered with a semi-sort of jungle of Gez trees. Rafeeabad, belonging to Hajji Nasir-ul-Mulfc, has 10 houses, 40 people, 6 oxen, 30 cows; £00 mans of wheat and barley are sown yearly. Houses, all date-palm leaves.19 * Small canal. Sa'adatabad, belonging to the Kawam-ul-Mulk, consists of 70 houses, 350 people, 42 oxen, 30 cows; 200 mans of wheat and barley are sown yearly. 100 sheep. February 19th .—Left at 6-30 a.m. The road for the first 2 miles was somewhat up hill, slightly stony. It then entered the Tang-i-Lamby, winding about for some 20 minutes among low hills, and then came out on a small plain about 6 miles long by 4 wide. r lhe Tang in no place was difficult-going, in some places it was a bit stony, but otherwise the road was good. Crossing the plain, by the side of the road on the left hand, was a good jub* of water, it is called Khunab (blood-water). It is stated that some robbers once were beheaded near here, and that their blood ran into the stream, ever since the stream has been known by that name. At the end of the plain the road made a short, sharp descent into the dry bed of a ri er, and then upon mounting the other side, imme diately entered the Tang-i-Zagh; this is a difficult place, the windings of the defile are very considerable, the hills on each side are often nearly perpendicular, exhibiting at times most wonderful colouring and queer shapes, the like of which I have never seen in this country. Nature has used her paint box with a liberal hand, and formed such a picture as would delight an artist's eye. “Hills upon hills and alps on alps arisetheir sides of deepest purple streaked with, or fading away into, tinges of the most delicate violet or mauve, some with sides of rose, with deep bold splashes of black or bluish green, others of a tawny, yellow striped with a bronze brown, such as would bring joy to the heart of an aesthetic he here would have a chance of living up to, but I doubt his cap ability of climbing them,—if he was not limp before doing so, he certainly would be after. It is not one individual hill by itself that is so extraordinary, but the way they are grouped, and the contrasts of colour which make up this wonderful picture, unequalled by any thing that I have seen either in Persia or the Caucasus. After get ting through the defiles the road bent to the south-west and gradually ascended; highest point reached by aneroid 26-30. Then gradually descending, it entered the dry bed of a river, and follow ing this for some 5 miles, passed the village of Abmah, about a mile to the left. The plain on the right and right front nas somewhat curious, broken up into a series of little hills with flat tops, and somewhat abrupt sides, as if once the whole plain had been a lake, and the waters in subsiding had cut valleys and gullies in the plain. The section showed about 10 to 15 feet of gravel above a bluish grey clay.20 For some way the read ran between highish hills, and no distant view was to be got. The whole of the latter part of the way was stony, and was by far the worst going yet experienced. It would be difficult to get vehicles through either pass or over some parts of these river-beds, but not by any means an impossibility; a very little labour would render the whole route quite practicable. 5-40 p.m., arrived at Gohrah. Distance 29 miles. The hills hereabouts are more like mud heaps than hills. Many flourishing date topes about. This place and the last, Sa’a- databad, seem to be on the high road to Yezd; a great number of camel caravans have been passed, going to and coming from that place. Gohrah has no proper village or houses, but opposite to a Tofangchi tower, which is in partial ruins; we put up in a good- sized room made of sun-dried bricks. The houses or huts of date palm leaves are erected all over the place under the date trees, which are very numerous. There are 350 such huts inhabited by 700 people; 2,000 sheep, 80 cows, 60 oxen, are owned by them ; 5,000 mdns of wheat and barley are sown yearly. Malyat 800 # ^ ^ tomans. Rahd^r* is sold for 1,000 tom ans per annum. This is the first Rahdar that I have seen on this road. Houses can be built of sun-dried bricks or stones and mud. Gatch is to be got in the hills. The water is good all the year round ; there are two good wells in a hill near. This hill is called Musht-i-Kuh; here the villagers have built themselves a Kala’h, and when occasion arises they take refuge ; there is only one road up to it. The hill appears to be 1,000 to 1,200 feet high, and has a square flat top. The base is some 12 miles in circumference. The KalaTi is never left unguarded. February 20ik .—Left at 12-10 p.m., went along a stony road, passing about 1 \ miles from the end of the date trees, two Abambars,t which soon dropped down into the usual dry watercourse, followed this for some 4 miles; it is known as the Chin-i-Tul, then something in the shape of a Gardeneh or rather a long slope from the hill on the right. Kuh-i-Zuratu cut up by watercourses, led down to the little village of Zuratu, a small place nestling under the hill. This was about the best camping place we had had, nice patches of green turf, under fine date trees, with a good spring of fresh water rushing from the hill-side. This spring continues good all through the year. Although the road now is not available for vehicles, owing to the numerous deep watercourses which intersect it, yet a little work would soon make it fairly practicable. Dis tance 7 miles. + Water tanks covered over.21 Zuratu has 7 houses, 30 people, 4 oxen,' 30 goats ; 400 mans of wheat and barley are sown yearly. Malyat 400 krans. February 21st .—Left at 8-10 a.m., followed the Chin-i-Zuratu till 8-45, when the road dropped into a dry riverbed, and then came on to the Bir-i-Buland; direction nearly due south. The road fairly open and broad, but here and there somewhat stony, with some slight gradients. At 9-32 came to a small open plain called Barak. At 10-5 the direction took a westerly bearing, and a small Gardeneh, called Godar-i-Sowaro, was crossed. It then worked in and out of some small hills, and at 10-45 again dropped into the river-bed. Here there was some water in it, and it is known as the Ab-i-Sherene. At 10-55 stopped to breakfast. 11-55 off again. 12-2 p.m., road was still among the same line of small hills, but working towards the east. 12-31 p.m. came out into the plain called Sahra-i-Dardam. Road now nearly due west. After going for about 5 miles through this plain, covered with mimosa, acacia, and wild almond, arrived at the village of Sarzeh. Water from wells and also a spring from a hill close to, but this although sweet and plentiful now, gets very brackish in summer. It appears that from Gohrah to here there is another road via Finn, which is about 4 farsakhs (14 miles) away from here, in a north-north-westerly direction. The road by which we came, although so round-about, is really the shorter. Distance 17 miles. In the river-bed I noticed that the oleanders were in flower, and near Zuratu I picked up a wild water melon. February 22nd .—Rained heavily from 4 a.m. to 11 a.m. Could not get on ; tents completely saturated. I saw bushes about in considerable quantities, which I took to be the milk-bush. On Kuh Farkun snow has fallen heavily, and it is somewhat low down on the hill-side. I should judge that this hill must be at least 12,000 feet high by the position of the snow in such a low latitude. Sarzeh,—20 houses, 100 people; 700 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly; 8 oxen, 150 sheep. Rezwan, Bar, and Geru,—three villages under one head,—200 houses, 700 people, 60 oxen, 2,000 sheep; 4,000 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly; 600 tomans malyat. February 23rd .—Left at 7-30 a.m. The road crossed the bed of the Ab-i-Sherene, and then working nearly due south for some 2 miles among small hills and broken ground, bore away to the south east ; again crossing the river-bed and through a plain similar to the Sahra-i-Dardam, it was open-going, and only here and there stony. Camped for breakfast near to the junction of the Ab-i- Cfdp*' -r'l 8 ;r* e* 5 i H dr*)22 Sherene and Rud-Kh^nch-i-Shur. Close to this place is also the junction of a road with the one on which we were going. On en quiry I learnt that this is a donkey and foot road to Ganao, which branches off from the main road nearly at the entrance to the Sahra i-Dardam, and shortens very considerably the road from Zuratu. As far as I could see, it would not be difficult, and would decrease the total distance by about 10 miles. At this point there was no water in the Ab -i-Sherene, but the Rud-Khaneh-i-Shur has a small, rapid stream, which flows from the Kuh-i-Nimuk. Left again at 12-13 p.m., following the same plain as in the morn ing. It is called the Dasht-i-Mohdam. This plain runs parallel to, and at the back of the Ganao hills, which are immediately behind bandar Abbas At 12-29 got nearly due south-east, and at 1-5 p.m. level with the village of Ganao, about 5 miles to the right in the hills, with a fine grove of date trees at the foot of the ascent. On the plain and near to the road was an Abambar, with a few date-palm huts, which were inhabited by the Rahdans. Went on, and at 2-25 p.m. camped near an Abambar close to the road-side. There was not much water in the tank. This is a high table-land, a spur of the Ganao hills on our right. Had to send 'j-p to a village, called Desek, in among the hills, some 5 miles away, for supplies. February 24th .—The Abambar is called in this part of the world a Birka. Rained heavily from 3 a.m. up to about 8 a.m., and then more or less all day. Left at 8 a.m., and gradually descending an even slope, more or less stony, and cut up here and there by watercourses, at last came to the usual dry bed of a river ; followed this for something over a quarter of an hour, and then got out into a plain with ^4* st*- Chahaly and Issin on our right front. Halted at Chahaly, where ^.2} we were met by men from the Governor. Distance 8 miles. Leav ing Chahaly, immediately dropped into the ’wide bed of a river with high sandstone cliffs on each side. This we followed for 29 minutes, and then ascending the cliffs to the right by a sharp, short pass, got into a lot of curious sandstone hills cut up in every direction into funny forms and peaks by the effects of running water. Followed along a road in the plateau of sandstone, which was nothing but a series of narrow troughs cut by the innumerable feet of donkeys and assisted by rain, for over an hour, and then descending quickly, came on to the sands which surround Bandar Abbas. It rained almost the whole time, and the clouds were both thick and low, so no distant view was to be got. Distant 16 miles. Chahaly,—20 houses, 60 people, 3,000 date-palms; no mules or donkeys.23 Xssin,—100 houses, 100 people, 0,000 date-palms; malyat of both villages 500 tomans. Bandar Abbas,—50 ) houses of sun-dried bricks, 9,000 people, 200 dale-palm huts, 2,000 people; malyat of Minab, Shamilat, Kishm, Beyarban, and Tasium 2,400 tomans per annum. The cus toms are let for 45,000 tomans per annum. Gatch is brought by sea from Bandar Kamir. Labourer’s pay 10 shahies per diem ; sun-dried bricks 2 krans per thousand. All along the road, until within 10 farsakhs of Bandar Abbas, there is not only better water, but it is also more plentiful than on the Shiraz-Bushire road. At Chahaly and Bandar Abbas there is also good water. The people everywhere have been most civil and obliging ; all doing their utmost to help one. Their politeness from Shiraz to here has been extreme; scarcely a person met on the road failed to give the salaam. I cannot help saying that I have been most agreeably surprised all the way along. March 1H.— Left at 9-5 a.m. Went out by the same road as I came in. Nothing of any consequence to note, except that the place I have hitherto called Chahaly, is really Hormudar, Chahaly being about half a mile to the north. Arrived at Hormudar at 12-45 p.m. ; left at 1-45 P.M., and arrived at the Birka at 4-15 p.m. Weather at first cloudy, but clear now. The Abambar, which when we passed down was quite empty, is now quite full. A lot of people with us; sent out by the Governor and Foreign Agent. They are a lot of curious looking men, armed with match locks, swords, knives, and shields. They might have been of some use fifty years ago, but now, except to put in the foregiound of a picture, they are not worth much. One gentleman is very gorge ous with silver mountings to his paraphernalia. They are mounted on camels, horses and donkeys, and altogether form a non-deset ipt- looking crowd. The name of the riverbed, which we passed through between Bandar Abbas and Hormudar, is Rud-Khaneh Chahchekor. March M.—Left at 6-25 a.m. The road went on the same track as we came by, for something less than a mile, and then bore away to the right, north-easterly. It gradually led down into the plain through which we had come from Sarzeh, and continuing through this, crossed the Rud Khaneh-i-Shur. At 8 a.m., came level with where the river had cut its way through some low hills. The plain about here is very stony, but here and there are patches of good ground which have been cultivated; the crops, owing to the scarcity S to G t /24 * of rain, are only now beginning to show up. The plain is much cut up by streams, especially by the main branch of the Shurab, which covers a lot of ground when in flood. After going about 7^ t_&lt;IS miles came to the Sahra Kunuk, really a part of the same plain; at 9-32 a.m., or after going 11 miles, descend a deep gully, at the bottom of which was a salt stream, another Shurab. At 10 a.m. the road bore away to the south-east, crossing a sort of plateau with a gentle descent; at the foot, another riverbed was passed; this also covered a fair quantity of ground, which, as far as one could judge, had lately been all under water. With the exception of these streams and the ground affected by their floods, the track, it is impossible to call it a road, is fairly good, although in places ^ stony. At 11-5 a.m. arrived at Kalah-i-Kazi, or, as it is more generally known, Kalzazi. This village has a fine grove of date trees, and there are also numbers of fine grown mimosa dotted about. These, among the young-growing crops give a park-like look to the surrounding country, and a picturesqueness to the village. The place seems in a very flourishing condition, and the people are very civil. The men are a fine lot of fierce-looking fellows, with long curls and flowing beards. The women, happily, wear a little more cloth ing than the men; they wear regular marks, and seem fond of red as a colour. Fancy, that in most cases they are old and ugly, as they cling to their masks. Kalah-i-Kazi,—100 houses, 300 people, 70 oxen, 100 cows; 2,500 mans of wheat and barly sown yearly. Sun-dried bricks 35 shahies to 2 krans per 1,000. Distance 18 miles. March 3rd .—Left at 6-35 a.m. The road ran through a level plain, with a fairish quantity of stones on it. Clumps of acacia and oleander also all over it. At 8-40 a.m. arrived at ihe village at.au of Takht, a flourishing place. Saw another village (Jahun) away in the hills, about 4 miles off to the north-west. Passed around Takht and went along a big grove of date palms on the right hand ; on the left were some high hills with very steep sides. Among the ciops, which here seemed in a somewhat more forward condition, were lots of well-grown mimosa trees; about the road I noticed a dwaif sort of oleander, with a star-shaped flower, small, and nearly white, not unlike a white forget-me-not: have not seen anything similar to this elsewhere. At 10-5 a.m. came to the village of Chahistan, 11£ miles, breakfasted, and left at 11-25 a.m. SunVery hot. Still keeping along the road went to the north-east, through country still more park-like in appearance. In places the going was very soft, and the road was much cut up by the laterains. 12-20 p.m. came to the village of Khuslikuh, at the foot of the hill of the same name. Ten minutes after leaving this, came to a riverbed, or rather to the commencement of what turned out to be a large expanse of ground at times swept by floods; crossing over this at 1-5 p.m., came to the main stream, still carrying on over ground which was but a mass of stones, and every yard of it apparently having only recently been subjected to a severe flood ; got out of it at 2 p.m. This was about the roughest piece of riding that I have ever had in this country. It was diffi cult to keep the horses on their legs. The camels went by a road along the base of the hills, crossing the stream nearly at the point where it emerges from the gorge. This road is the main one from Bandar Abbas to Kirman. Arrived at Shamil at 2-30 p.m. Distance 22 miles. Takht,—400 houses, 1,200 people, 100 oxen, 250 cows, 300 sheep; 2,500 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly. Malyat 1,000 tomans. Chahistan,—40 houses, 100 people, 10 oxen, 50 cows ; 250 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly. Total number of date trees owned by both villages, 40,000. Khushkuh, —200 houses, 800 people, 68 oxen, 20 cows; 3,500 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly ; 15,000 date trees; malyat 450 tomans. Shamil—170 houses, 500 people, 100 oxen, 100 cows; 5,000 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly ; 16,000 date trees; malyat 600 tomans. March 4th .—Halted the day. In the morning I rode up to the point where the river debouches into the plain. It appears to make its way for some distance through a narrow gorge, with hills of some size each side of it. The Kirman road follows this gorge, and must at times be blocked for days together when the river is in full flood. I could not see any road over the hills, obviating such a contingency. After breakfast I went back on the direct road to Takht and also on that to Ziaret. I had been told that there were bad roads, and quite impassable after heavy rains, and that also near to Ziaret the river was confined to its bed and did not overflow. The first half mile of this road passed through a dense date grove; thence for about 5 miles the ground was covered by what one might call a mimosa jungle; thence on to some salt ground covered with low scrub; in places all along the going was soft, although it was some days since rain had fallen, no camels had passed over this portion of the road. At Bandar Abbas, Kalgaz, and Shamil, I had been told that the sea-road and the rah-i-meyan (the middle road), as that which I2f, was on i? called, were impracticable after rains, especially for camels. Having gone some 12 miles and finding that the in formation given was substantially correct, I returned to Shamil. At Bandar Abbas and about here the current coin is the rupee. At the former place they would only take the kran at 27 pul in stead of 40, and here they would not take them at all. March 6/h. —Started at 7 a.m. Road bearing south-east. It passed between the date grove and some low gravel hills on the left hand. After going for half a mile, crossed a stream issuing from a deep gorge in the hills. On the summit of the one nearest to Shamil were the rums of the Kalah-i-Shamil; they seemed to cover a lot of ground. I had not been told of these ruins, and so did not examine them. I took an ordinary Tofangchi tower on the hill immediately behind the village to be the much vaunted Kalah. Up the gorge is the road into the Rudbar district. This stream, I was told, ultimately joins the one of the day before, and is also a branch of it. After passing the stream, the road still bore to the south-east, but both hills and date grove diverged. The plain, which as far as I could judge to be of rich alluvial soil, was covered with sprouting crops in every direction; amidst them were well- grown mimosa trees, and some camelthorn ; also some of the small oleander-like shrub. After going 2 miles further, passed another small stream. Two and a half miles beyond this came to the village of Chah- khark. Three and three-quarter miles further on a third stream was passed. The bed of this was some 200 yards across. This part of the country is open, and is known as the Sahra Chahkhark. The whole way each side of the road, as far as the eye could reach, seemed to be under cultivation. The road was much cut up by watercourses; the ground everywhere along the march has been soft, the going being generally easy. Five miles further on again a stream was passed; its bed was about 120 yards across; this stream, they tell me, joins its waters to the Minab near to the sea. 11-5 a.m. arrived at Grurband, a thriving village, with a large square kalah, which is gradually falling into ruin. Distance 15 miles. Chahkhark,—80 houses, 350 people, 20 oxen, 50 cows; 1,000 nidus of wheat and barley sown yearly. As malyat 10 per cent, of grain is given in lieu of money. Gurband,—200 houses, 700 people, 80 oxen, 150 cows, 20 camels ; 4,000 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly ; malyat 250 krans. March 6th. — Left at 6-25 a.m. Morning again cloudy. The roa d ran through the same plain vnth the lower spurs of the Rudbal ^ ' hills, close on the left hand. The plain under cultivation right up27 to them and on fcho right hand as far as the eye could see. The main range of the Rudbal appears to be about 6 miles off. Both lines with extremely serrated tops, rising here and there to very abrupt peaks ; the sides of the distant hills appear to be almost per pendicular. At 7-20 a.m. passed across the bed of a small stream. At 7*47 a.m. passed on the left hand a good-sized village called Dam-i-shahr, and at 8-5 a.m. a second, called Noband. At 8-30 passed on the left a large date grove ; some of the trees were very fine indeed. At 9 o’clock entered a large date grove with the village of Shahvar in the centre of it. The village seems very fairly prosperous; got out of the grove at 10-5 a.m., and came on to the bed of Minab river, with the town of Minab on the far side, where we arrived at 10-15 a.m. There is not much water in the river at the present time; depth about 2 feet, and breadth about 100 yards. The Kilah on the hill above the town is in a dilapidated state. The town consists of numbers of well built houses, and is sur rounded by a mass of date groves and fine gardens. It is quite the most prosperous place that I have seen on the journey. Distance 16 miles. The road which I have been following these last two days must be nearly identical with that which Marco Polo took when he visited Hormuz; the plain evidently is that which he calls For mosa. There is no necessity for me to point out that the river Minab is the ancient Anamis, mentioned by Strabo as the spot where Nearchus beached and repaired his fleet; it is all too well known. I have tried to identify some of the names used by Marco Polo, but have not succeeded. With regard to the wine made from dates mentioned by him, the people tell me that in days gone by they used to make such wine, but that it is never done now. The chief fruits of the place appear to be dates; the number of date trees is something enormous, and the people claim that the grove is second in size only to that of Busreh. It runs down each side of the river to the point where tidal effects interfere with the irrigation, about 2 miles from the sea. The average breadth is about 6 miles. Secondly, come mangoes, then oranges of sorts, citrons, shaddocks, and lemons ; no stone fruits or nuts are to be found. During winter and spring there is always plenty of water to be found in the river, but in summer it is all used up for irrigation, and only near to the meuth is there any flow.28 The people of the place are most civil and obliging ; they seem happy, well-conducted, and prosperous. They are all more or less employed in agriculture, and do not appear to have any industry peculiar to tlie place. There is a small colony of Shikarpur merchants, who seem to thrive, and appear, as far as I could learn, to be well treated. Since we arrived it has been raining heavily, and all the distant hills are completely obscured. Dam-i-shahr,—70 houses, 250 people, 50 oxen, 50 cows, 30 don keys ; 2,500 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly; 2,000 date trees; malyat 50 tomans. Noband,—20 houses, 100 people, 12 oxen, 15 cows, 100 sheep; 300 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly ; malyat 25&lt;» krans. Shahvar,— 200 houses, 520 people, 40 oxen, 100 cows; 2,000 mdns of wheat and barley sown yearly ; 4,000 date trees; malyat 100 tomans. March 7th. —Went up to the Kalah this morning, and had a good look round. It is built of kiln-burnt brick and partly of sun- dried ; in former days it must have been a fairly strong place. The hill-side is covered with bastions, towers, and connecting walls. At the foot of the hill is a large square enclosure, with high walls and flanking towers; inside these is a space of at least five acres in extent, containing many good and substantial houses. The walls are about 20 feet high, and built of sun-dried bricks. From the top I noticed a sort of valley between some low hills at the back of the date grove from Shahvar and the main range. After breakfast I rode across to a point opposite the Kalah, the water in the river had much increased in volume, and was very muddy. At two points where I tried to cross I was nearly carried away. I at last managed to get across with some little difficulty and a good wetting. Opposite the Kalah, on this side of the river, are some small sandstone hills, date groves, and gardens, then a small bridle-path leads through a narrow valley and comes out nearly opposite to Shahvar. The hills are about 100 feet high, very curiously formed with jagged edges. March 8th .—From 3 a.m. to 2 p.m. continuous violent thunder storms, accompanied by heavy rain. The roads have consequently been much cut up, and I am generally advised that it would not be judicious to attempt visiting Hormuz. This is a disappoint ment, as I had looked forward to seeing the site of this old place. Minab,—700 houses, 6,500 people, 200 camels, 200 oxen, 100 donkeys; 12,000 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly. Malyat 13,000 tomans. Building materials, such as gatch and rafters.29 ? are generally brought from Bandar Abbas by boat. Rafters of Zanzibar wood cost 3 to 4 krans each, and gatch about 7 to 10 krans the 100 mans. Gatch is also to be found in the hills. Sun- dried bricks cost 2 krans per 1,000. Labourers pay about 15 shahies per diem ; mason's 2| krans per diem. March 9th. — Left at 6-25 a.m.; day fine ; for some little distance the road passed between some low sandstone hills on the left and the date grove on the right; it then cut into the plain, bearing nearly due south; about here there was not much cultivation, the plain was however covered with camelthorn and low scrub. At 7-53 passed through the bed of a small stream without any water in it, in spite of the heavy rain of yesterday. Country very flat, and the going soft. At 10 a.m. halted close to a river and near to a small village called Chah Kambar. 12 p.m. off again. At 12-18 crossed the river at a place called Ju Mahallah. This is but a small village of 3 or 4 houses. On the hill top, nearest to the ford, is a small round tower in ruins. The stream is broad, but not deep. I am told that this stream rises in the Bashakird hills and winds out of the plain to the sea. It appeared to me to join the Minab, near to the sea. It certainly has no connection with it this side of the sandhills. All about here, and right up to Kalavy, the ground is very soft; there is a good deal of salt incrustation about, and near Kalavy it is a regular marsh, very trying to the horses. Distance 22 miles. March 10th .—7 a.m. raining slightly now. During the night it came down very heavily. I had been told at Minab that about 2 farsakhs from this place there was a curious Kalah on the top of a hill, and that it was well worth seeing, there being the remains of a number of water tanks and some buildings made of immense stones; it was known as Kalah gat. I determined to see what it was, hoping that I might find the ruins of some old palace or castK After going 4 good farsakhs, instead of 2 across the Dar-i-Masheh, and then across some very nasty ground, among a lot of sandstone hills and by the bed of a torrent, came to the Kalah on the top of an isolated hill, with high, perpendicular sides, most difficult to approach—a sort of steep shelving road had been made on the west side, and this was commanded by a sort of fortified gateway. On our approach this gateway was manned by about a dozen villainous-looking Tofangchis, armed with matchlocks. After getting admission and going over the whole place which covered about six acres of ground, we came to the conclusion that we had been most completely sold; there absolutely was nothing to see,—some few holes in the ground, may once have been water tanks, and that was all; the place could have had nothing but i3 %30 a local history, and in all probability it was a sort of refuse for the inhabitants of the diftrict during times of disturbance. All that we got for our pains was a real good ducking, as it came on to rain heavily as soon as we arrived; thus the whole country was obscured, and I had not even a chance of getting a good look- round into the interior. ^ In the plain passed the two villages of Ramehan and Dodar. 'I’he plain extends for many miles to the south between the out- lying spurs of the Bashakird and the hills bordering the sea. All the hills in the foreground were sandstone, whilst those of the main range appeared to be limestone. The plain is much cut up by watercourses, and in some places fair streams. Chah Kambar 15 houses, 60 people, 10 oxen, 50 cows, 10 camels, 150 sheep; 500 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly. No malyat. Kalavy,— 44 houses, 120 people, 20 oxen, 10 cows, 150 sheep, 30 camels, 1,000 date trees; 1,100 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly. Kuhistak,— 110 houses, 300 people, 20 oxen, 160 cows, 20 camels, 250 sheep, 10 donkeys, 1,700 date trees; 1,000 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly. Malyat of Kalavy and Kuhistak 100 tomans. March 11th .—Rained heavily all night. During the night one of the huts came down, and a beam smashed my prismatic compass. From this point I had only a small pocket compass to take bearings with. Left at 8 a.m. Road across a very bad bit of ground; it was generally soft, and in some places deep ; we often had to diverge a great deal before being able to pass a bad bit of ground. In one place I got well in, my horse sinking to . the shoulders, then all the servants, one after the other, did^the same. This was about the only real bit of fun that we had durino the whole journey. At last got out of the bad ground on to some good hard-going at the back of a date grove and along the base of some small hills, it having taken us an hour and a half to do 3 short miles. At 10 a.m. got to Kuhistak; waited until the mules came up. They only arrived at 12-30 p.m.; every mule showing by the mud on the baggage that it had been down. We then started again, crossing at its mouth a small stream, Chahlak it is called. After leaving this, the road went along the sands quite close to the sea; course due south ; the Arab coast to be seen to the west and south-west. 1-40 p.m. crossed another stream. At 3 p.m. passed a village in the sandhills to the left, about a mile off called Ziaret, O The road still on the sands, with the sea about 100 yards off. At31 4-35 p.m. reached tlie village of Geru. During the march had a great deal of heavy rain. Geru is something like a mile inland among a lot of sandhills. Just on entering the village crossed a small stream. Distance 20 miles. March 12th ,—During the night it rained very heavily, there were also tremendous storms of thunder and lightning. Leav ing was quite out of the question ; the road in front was, I was told, very heavy,and there was a bad river to cross, which, owing to the late rains, would be impassable. Kohsiah, —25 houses, 120 people, 10 oxen; 500 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly; 20 cows, 1,000 date trees; malyat 35 to mans. Geru,—150 houses, 440 people, 21 oxen; 3,000 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly; 100 cows, 170 sheep, 2,000 date trees, 20 camels; malyat 100 tomans. March 13th. —Rain,thunder and lightning going on the whole night, and raining heavily now; but as I cannot afford to waste any more time, am going to try to get on. 8-30 made a start; for about 2 miles followed the line of some sandhills, then it came on to rain harder than ever. From this point road went out on to an open plain, with lots of camelthorn and low scrub all about. At 9-20 passed the village of Tahruy; at 10-30 passed another village called Serik. On the left were a lot of hills of fairish height, about 3 miles off. On the right a succession of date groves, and the sea in the far distance. The ground all about was soft-going. A number of small streams full of muddy v/ater were passed. These streams? evidently the draining of the hills to the left, must have a lot of clay in them, as the water is very white. None of them of any importance. 11-50 came to the village of Kardir and stopped alongside to breakfast, l-o started again, and in an hour came to the Gez river, a deep, swift-flowing stream, about 60 yards aeross- and running about 6 miles an hour. Tried it and found that it would be impossible for laden mules to cross, so perforce had to camp. 1 was told by some people who were about, that they have been stuck here for six days waiting for it to fall sufficiently to enable them to cross; rain, however, has fallen daily and prevented them. The water is now evidently decreasing, and we may be able to cross to-morrow, supposing no heavy rains fall during the night. Dis tance 14 miles. March 14th .—Weather warm, clear, and damp. A little rain fell during the night. Have been to see the state of the river, and A 5 &gt;&lt;32 find that it has fallen at least 3 feet during the night, but it is still too deep for mules to cross without getting their loads wetted. Will see what it is like in the afternoon, and, if possible, cross to the village of Gez about a mile away. The plain is similar to that which we have hitherto followed, but in addition to the mimosa there are numerous Gez trees, some very fine. On the ground I have noticed an insect of a bri lit scarlet, something in shape like a large bug ; when pressed, a few drops of intensely scarlet fluid are squirted out. 1-30 p.m. started, getting across the river and succeeded in getting whole camp over by 3-30; all damageable articles had to be put on camels. The water must have been at deepest part about 3 feet deep. Went on to Gez and camped there for the night. Distance 2 miles. Kardir,—20 houses, 100 people, 11 oxen ; 500 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly; 1,000 date trees, 200 sheep. Gez.—20 houses, 100 people, 14 oxen; 500 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly; 8 camels, 70 cows, 12 donkeys, 150 sheep, 500 date trees ; 32 tomans malyat. March 15//&amp;.—Left at 6-18 a.m. Weather fine. The road for the first few hundred yards went over bad soft ground, then through a small date grove out into the plain. The ground throughout this stage was in places bad. The plain not unlike that between Boras- joon and Ahmedy near to Bushire. At 7-25 passed the village of u!/ Gawan on the left and Namordi on the right, about 2 miles off. 8-25 A-M. crossed a river, not much water in it, but the banks high and steep, about 160 yards across. At 8-53 passed the village of Zerabad on the left; 9-45 passed through the village of Sakui, ^ and 10-45 arrived at Karat. Distance 16 miles. The Beluehis here are very close, and refuse to give any parti culars about their villages. ^ Namordi,—150 houses, 450 people, 24 oxen, 70 cows; 1,200 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly; 15 camels, 16 donkeys, 1,000 date trees, 200 sheep; 40 tomans malyat. Karat,—20 houses, 110 people, 16 oxen, 40 cows, 100 sheep; 400 mans of wheat and barley sown yearly ; 300 date trees. March — Left at 6 a.m.; fine bright day. Went to the south-east for about a mile until we got under the hills. I was told that the ground in the centre of the plain was much cut up by the late rains, and that it was bad-going. At 6-12 passed a narrow but deep bed of a stream with but little water in it. A day or two ago it was full and impassable: this was a really nasty snot. 1 am sure any one trying to cross it when in flood would certainlyS3 be lost. The plain, although soft in places, was generally fairly good-going; some camelthorn and scrub about. Some few bugs similar to those previously referred to were seen here and there. 7-35 passed by the village of Brizg on the right hand, about a mile off. On the far right were some date groves and beyond them occasional glimpses of the sea could be got. Sandstone hills on the left hand, about half a mile off. Sharp-pointed peaks, and with that broken-off aspect common to up-country. 8-5, low hills now to the right as well as on the left. At 8-25 got in among them; they are all of sandstone, cut into curious and at times fantastic shapes, some resembling statues of colossal size. The whole place appears as if it had been subject to the effects of either the sea or else of running water within a very short period of time. 9-5 passed the village of Gawan and at 9-35 came to the vil lage of Mukhjangan, where we breakfasted. Here we were interviewed by a Biluch chief, a fine-looking fellow, got up in very gorgeous attire, covered with arms of all sorts, including the ever present hide shield; he commenced to talk very big, but after a time quieted down and ended by begging for krans and powder. 11-20 a.m. off again. Weather got very hot and close. Plain sandy, crossed another stream with very deep sides, about 18 yards across. This would also be a bad spot in heavy rains. Followed the plain until we arrived at Gatan at 1-5 p.m. Distance 204 miles. Low sandstone rocks in every direction. Kuh Mubarek in the distance nearly due south. Gatan,—100 houses, 450 people, 30 oxen; 400 mans of wheat and barley, also Indian corn, sown yearly; 120 cows, 250 sheep, 2,000 date trees, 5 donkeys; 30 tomans malyat. March 17th. — Left at 5-48 a.m. Fine clear morning. Went away across the plain to the south-south-east to get out of a line of bad ground. We have been threatened all along the march since leav ing Bandar Abbas with what the natives call mee 7 is. A meen appears to be a piece of treacherous ground ; it has a fair face, but no secure bottom. I made the acquaintance of one to-day and did not find it pleasant. The guides walking along quietly in front passed over the ground easily; it looked all good hard sand; all at once my horse plunged and sunk to the girths, thinking that it was only a small bit of bad ground, I sent him along for some yards; finding he could get no further, I got off. The poor beast had sunk up to the shoulders in the ground and looked woefully dis tressed. We only managed to get him out with difficulty, and after3J. good hard work. I almost thought once that I should lose him. After heavy rains the whole of this part of the country gets covered with these meens. They are well named, as they are real mean deceitful things. I suppose that they are due in some way to imperfect drainage, the country being so flat; or perhaps some pecu liarity in the strata not allowing the water to drain off, the sun dries the top leaving these treacherous spots below. The plain near to the hills on the left was dotted with scrub and proved better going. At 9-5 came to the village of Kuh V Mubarek in among some small hills, and at 9-45 halted to break fast. Kuh Mubarek bearing west-north-west. 11-15 off again. The plain hereabouts was entirely sand, and we were caught in about as bad a storm of wind as I have rarely experienced. In spite of the late rains having beaten the sand down, yet it flew about in such clouds that at times one could not see a yard beyond the horse's ears. There was not a tree or a shrub to break the force. The sand and small stones were blown into one's face with such force as to be absolutely painful. Happily the direction of the storm was so as to strike one on the beam; to have faced it, would have been impossible. 11-15 passed a small riverbed with deep steep sides. At 12-45 came to another of the same description, and at 1-15 p.m. ^ arrived at the village of the Gangan, where we camped. It was but a bad spot, but going on in such weather was not to be thought of. Distance 20 miles. March ISth .—Left at 5-35 a.m. The road over the same sandy plain, with but little scrub about, bore for a hill east-north-east, which we reached in an hour, went round it and carried on in the same direction passing some date groves, and through a more wooded country, chiefly gez trees. At 7-12 passed a river called Taber Kand, about 100 yards across. We came this wav, as we were told that this river on the direct road would be very difficult to cross. It would stop one, even here I imagine, after a conti nuance of wet weather. Bearing now east-south-east, at 8-25 came to a small riverbed with steep sides, another nasty spot in the rains. Ground all along sandy, with slight salt incrustation. Passed several fine date groves, and at 9-45 camped under one for breakfast. 11-15 off again. Country as before for nearly 8 miles, when we L c'.a^ came to the village of Jashk. Distance 23 miles. From the sandhills close by the telegraph buildings are visible, about 10 miles away.35 19th March .—Marched into Jaskh Telegraph Office, the first mile across the plain ; then through and over some sandhills on to a masheelah for about 3 miles, then across the peninsula to the office.
