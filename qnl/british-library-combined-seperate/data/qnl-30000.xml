It also contains a printed note by Haji Sultan Shushtari calling for a Persian shipping company to provide competition to the British India Steam Navigation Company (see folio 240).Henry George Chick's (Commercial Adviser and Vice-Consul at Bushire) reports on German Trade and Shipping in the Persian Gulf have been included in this part for 1910-11 (see ff 315-329) and 1911-12 (see ff 219-230 and ff 201-215, two copies), along with a copy of a Diplomatic and Consular Report on the Trade of Basra for 1911 (see ff 272-282).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><subject><geographic>Shatt al Arab</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Basra</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100035251855.0x000002#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100035251855.0x000002#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100035251855.0x000002#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
