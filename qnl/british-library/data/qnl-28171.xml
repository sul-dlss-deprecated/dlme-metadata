O.T.P.flLE COP&gt;H ~ 4 ^ MfF+P. ^ ' / Brit v British Embassy, Caracas* 19th March, 1945 Ul Sir, 3 0 APR jj 1 t if x With reference to my despatch No. 62 of 4th May,19^l4&gt; t v, 4-‘U 4- 4 -q c&gt; +-i nrr a-f o-f am(^Ti +. .Q mo rfR I have the honour to report some interesting statements made by Mr. Arthur A. Curtice over the luncheon table to Mr.Ander son a few days ago, regarding the post-war petroleum situation# You v/ill recollect that Messrs. Herbert Hoover Jr., and 2 . Arthur A. Curtice, well-known to the petroleum industry as technical and legal consultants, were employed by the Venezuelan Government some two years ago as expert advisers on the drafting of the new Petroleum Law. You are also aware that Messrs. Hooever and Curtice, after completing their official task, found ed a company, the United Ceox&gt;hysical Company, with headquarters at Caracas, for purposes of collaboration with the oil industry here and in other parts of the world. The services they at first proposed to render were mainly advisory but have new been expanded to include technical assistance. In particular, they now place at the service of the oil companies a new technique for increasing the flow of oil by the introduction of acids into bearing strata. The value of this process, besides acceleration of flow, resides apparently in the reduction of steel equipment brought about by its useo In this connexion, Mr. Hoover mentioned that the w acid process” would contribute in large measure to offset the reduced allocation of steel to the oil industry recently determined by the United States Government; according to Mr* Gurtice, the latest revision of steel priorities cuts down steel supplies to the oil industry by one half. 3. You will be aware that Messrs. Hoover and Curtice recent ly visited the Near East as advisers to the Government of Iran on applications pending for oil concessions in that country and that they took the opportunity of studying the oil situation in Iran and the Near East ; generally. You have doubtless received re ports from Sir Reader Bullard and others of their findings. Mr. Curtice tells Mr. Anderson that before Ms departure for t he Near East he v/as at pains to impress upon President Medina that while his new oil policy bi.d fair to solve the domestic oil problems of Venezuela for many years to come, it left the re lationship 'Of Venezuela with other oil producing countries un touched. Such problems were being envisaged by Britain and the United States to whom they were of vital c oncern. In this regard, it would be misleading if President Medina should be left under the impression that Venezuela, thanks to her great resources, could aspire to an independent position in the world of oil. Mr. Curtice found President Medina then somewhat sceptical and over-confident, though he did aay that he v/ould be .very interested in hearing the views of Messrs. Hoover and Curtice on their return from the Near East. /4. Mr. Curtice The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C.,M.P., Foreign Office, London, S.W.l.4. Mr. Curtice showed Mr. Anderson, in confidence, a copy of the report on the Near-Eastern oil situation which he has just furnished to President Medina. He felt unable to allow Mr 9 Anderson to take a copy of his report, though he saw no objection to his quoting any of his statements for official purposes. 5* The report gives an account of the known oil fields of the Near East, location, extent* capacity proven , or estimated, present output, names of concession-holders, territorial allegiance ..etc. The location.? capacity and ownership of refineries is also given together with a des cription of existing facilities for oil-transport overland and bjr sea. Costs of production and shipment are broadly outlined. 6. President Medina is left to draw from the report and from other data regarding the oil situation in the Americas already in his possession, the follov/ing main inferences:- a) That the two principal concession-holders in Venezuela, Standard Oil of New Jersey and the Shell Group, occupy a very minor position in the Near-East. b) That a strong majority position is held in the Near- East by other United States companies, who hold a minority position in Venezuela, where their production is still in its initial phase. c) That the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company have in the Near- East inraense reserves and production and the largest re finery in the world. d) That the United States, Britain and Prance have each one-third of the production over the Haifa line. e) That the Shell Group and Standard Oil of New Jersey share about equally the preponderant control of oil dis tribution and marketing throughout the world. f) That the cost of oil production in the Near-East and ocean transport of oil therefrom are so low in comparison with operational and shipment costs in the Americas that to-day Near-Eastern producers if left to their ov/n devices could deliver oil-products in United States ports much more cheaply than could South-American, e.g c ,Venezuelan producers. g) That Near-Eastern grades of oil are superior to those of Venezuela, with the exception of the light oils hitherto found in a few small formations^ (The new SHELL field in limestone formation near the Colombian border may prove an important exception.), h) That, ov/ing to the acceleration of oil production for war needs in both the Near East and the Americas, a major post-war problem will be the regulation of the pro duction and distribution of oil in various parts of the wo r ld&lt;&gt; i) That Venezuela, in particular, is now in a state of over-production. Whereas her pre-war peak had reached 400,000 barrels a day, it now stands at 800,000 barrels a day and, if the present programne of the Standard Oil of New Jersey is carried out, will attain 1,000.000 barrels a day by the end of the war. According to conservative estimates, Venezuelan post-war production will have to be /stabilised-'-'dr m m- 3 stabilised at between 500 ? 000 and 600 o 000 barjrels a day. inezupl? j) New United States entrants into the fields are already beginning to feel that the may prove too onerousa EXT ) 20 i 3 ent... k) Viewed from everj^ angle, the post-war situation is bound to be tense with conflicting interests,, so that, failing international and orderly control^ v/ith sacrifice on the part of all concerned,) it will be impossible to avoid catastrcpheo l) Viewed from the Ver.uzueian angle, eggs should be counted now before an jnevV tabiy embarrassing brood is hatchedc Venezuela must iiii.iediateiy forego the prospect of an ever-expanding oil revenue and base her economy for the next decade at least on a conservative estimate. 7. As regards prospects in other American countries, Mr. Gurtice volunteered the following opinions: The Mexican Government was already convinced of the bankruptcy of their confiscatory policy, though whether they would be able to reverse at now was at least doubtful. Brazil had already started soft-pedal.ling her nationalistic policy and would be glad to abandon it at the earliest possible moment. Argentina, though obdurate and less clear-sighted, was really in the same fix. Peru was in the happier position of having dis covered her oil resources too late for the current expansion, so that her economy had not yet been compromised by oil and she could afford to abide her time© As regards Colombia and the great oil deposits east of the Andes generally ? Mr 0 Curtice thought that development could and would be undertaken pro vided the respective gCYerur.ents understood ‘the facts cf the world situation aid afforded facilities accordingly. 8 0 As regards Russia, Mr. Curtice considers^ and has doubtless so informed the Venezuelans, that the oil resources discovered under the urge of war, about which Russia maintains secrecy, will far exceed the needs and productive capacity of Russia for many years to comer so that her present interest in the affais of neighbouring oil producing countries is almost ent i r e 1 0 p o li ti o ahc 9c Mr 0 Curtice further informed Mr. Anderson thab he had formed the most gratifying opinion of British administration and the conduct of oil business in the Near Mast, and constant ly acknowledged the courtesy meb by Mr^Hoover and himself eveiy- wherec, They were both fervent apostles 03 ? Anglo-American co operation, and warmly approved a policy cf enlightening South- American governments on the cold facts of the international oil problem 10. Messrso Hcotfver and Curtice are v -&gt; I understand* to embark soon on a journey to Arabia, at the invitation of local Governments. 11. Mr. Andersen informs me that although he was careful to refrain from any reference to the Venezuelan Governments oil refinery policy* Mr 0 Curtice, h propos of the reduction in steel availments, volunteered the remark that President Medina v/as no longer so insistent on the immediate develop ment of domestic refining, and seemed to be willing to leave that problem to his successor. 12» I have sent copies of this despatch to His MajestyS Ambassador at Washington, to His Majesty's Representatives at /Mexico4 - 4 - Mexico City ?
