So fertile was the landscape around the town, that the British bought some land near it in order to grow vegetables for the garrison at Aden (p. 68).As recently as 1872–73, the Ottoman Turks had made their presence felt in Lahej: according to Hunter, the eldest brother of the Sultan, Abdullah bin Mohsin, had ‘intrigued with the Turks, and invited them to occupy their fortified house at Al-Hautah’. In response, the Government of India decided to occupy the Lahej territory to ‘support the Lahej Sultan’. The stand-off lasted until the end of the year, when the Ottoman troops withdrew. The fortified house in question is the structure visible in the background on the left of the image.An excavated area and tumble-down walls take up most of the foreground, while a number of several-storeyed, crenellated structures occupy the horizon behind low-brick-walled enclosures. In the right lower corner of the image bricks can be seen stacked in a sequence of chevrons alongside some flat slabs, forming a rectangular paved area.In the middle-ground, toward the left of the image in the right foreground, are a donkey and five laden camels. Two figures stand on raised ground alongside the camel furthest to the right; the figure on the right appears to be wearing white, European-style clothing.</abstract><typeOfResource>still image</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Photograph</genre><name type="personal"><namePart>Frederick Mercer Hunter</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Ethnographic heritage</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023400730.0x000001#share">Public Domain</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
