Squire »msmns&amp; extracts sm 'jissmi 'Islab' dated 24th Kay 1947 At the time when Mona. Najibullah Khan, the Acting Minister of Education, was appointed to represent Afghanistan at the 'Middle Eastern Regional Air Navigation Meeting' in Cairo, he had similar preliminary discussions at Delhi. So in pursuance of these discussions and with the concurrence of the Royal Afghan Government, an (Indian) Mission composed of the following gentlemen arrived by air at Kabul at 8 a.m. on Friday the 23rd May 1947, with a view to negotiating an agreement on Indo-Afghan Air Communica- tions in accordance with the International conventions of Civil AvLition. At the Kabul aerodrome, they were received by the Chief of the Air General Staff, Director of the International Conferences of the Foreign Ministry and Director of the Special Section of the Ministry of Education From the 24th May 1947, the Indian Mission will start their discussions with the Afghan delegation headed by the Acting Minister of Education. (Names of the Afghan A Indian delegates) During their stay in Kabul the Mission will be the guests of the Royal Afghan Government. 'Islab'dated 25th May 1947 At 10.30 a,m. on the 24th May 1947 discussions between the Afghan and Indian delegations commenced under the chairmanship of the Acting Minister of Education, who welcomed the Indian Mission on behalf of the Royal Afghan ' Government, expressed his pleasure on their arrival and hoped to achieve satisfactory results from the ensuing discussions. The leader of the Indian Mission reciprocated these feelings and expressed gratitude to the Royal Afghan Government on behalf of the Indian Nation and the Indian Government. Technical matters involved were then assigned to Technical Committees. The discussions of the Conference■ ■an are 1)011076(1 to centre round preliminary surveys relating to Indo-Afghan Communications hy air. w Islah w dated 26th May 1947 . The second session of the Anglo-Afghan Civil Aviation Conference was held from 10.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. on the 25th May 1947, under the presidency of the Acting Minister of Education. 'Islah' dated 29th Mav 1947 . On the 26th May 1947, discussions between the Indian and Afghan Air delegations were held between 10 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. for the third time under the presidency of the Acting Minister of Education. These discussions continued between 3-30 and 6 p.m. on the 27th May. The fifth and the last meeting was held between 9-30 and 10-30 a.m. under the presidency of the Acting Minister of Education. At the end of the meeting the leader of the Indian Air Mission thanked the Acting Minister of Education for his guidance at the Conference. He said that the discussions held at the Conference, besides being beneficial to Afghanistan and India, created feelings of good understanding between these two countries. The Acting Minister of Education then closed the Conference and on behaD of himself, his colleagues of the Afghan delegation and the Boyal Afghan Government thanked the leader and members of the Indian Air Mission. He added that the discussions held at the Conference, which was in fact designed to carry out preliminary survey and exchange of views on behalf of the Governments of Afghanistan and India on the subject of Civil Air Communications between Afghanistan anl India, had been very useful emd successful. He hoped that with co-operation between these two countries, these discussions would prove of great help in the future stages of establishing air' services between Afghanistan and India. He also said that technical surveys carried out and the facilities provided byfc I i themselves very valuable. He concluded by saying that fact that this Conference had provided the first In the opportunity for the Indidn and Afghan delegations to meet, was in itself worthy of appreciation from the stand point of future relations between Afghanistan 'and Free India and the mutual goodwill of these two brother countries.

The Civil Aviation Mission sent by the Governiuent p£ Xftciia left l^»bul this morning after discussions with the Afghan Government lasting a week. I now have the honour to enclose a brief record prepared by Lt.Col* Abdur Kahim Khan, Counsellor of this Legation, on the main subjects discussed, together with certain observations which should in my opinion be brought to the notice of the Government of India* 2* It will be seen from this account that from the very outset the two delegations were discussing civil aviation problems from somewhat different standpoints* In your telegram No *66 of March 4th I was definitely informed that the Mission would not negotiate an air agreement but would only look into technical requirements* Your telegram No*A 0473 of the 30th April confirmed that this was merely a 'technical mission to discuss details for organization of air services between India and Kabul'* I should perhaps have reported earlier that when I gave this information to the Minister of Foreign Affairs on May 6 th he at first hinted that the Afghan Government would not in any case be able to proceed with their civil aviation project* As however the mission was only technical and exploratory, with no idea of concluding an agreement, and as it was due to arrive on May 14th in only eight days time, All Muhammad promised to let me have his Government's definite reply as soon as possible* On May 8 th I was informed of their agreement to the visit* On May 11th I received your fb'bO telegram^jlQ^ lOS dated May 10th saying that the date of arrival had been postponSTand thftt the Director-General of Civil Aviation would himself lead the mission, and it was not until May 18th thf t I received your further telegram No*112 giving the final composition of the mission then due to arrive on the 22 nd May 9 The fact that the mission was now being headed by the Director-General of Civil Aviation in person and was being accompanied by Messrs .Dalmia and Isphani of the Indian National Airways and Orient Airways respectively indicated that the intention of the Government of India might have been to enlarge the scope of the discussions, but no specific intimation was given to me of this fact and it was only on the mission's actual arrival that its leader informed me that he had an air agreement in his pocket ready for signature* I varned him against trying to press the matter too fast as the Afghan Government were to the best of my knowledge only prepared to exchange information regarding technical requirements* 3* It soon became apparent that the Afghan delegation were somewhat embarrassed by the proposal for the immediate conclusion of an air agreement and after their first days meeting on Saturday, May 24th, Mons. Najlbullah Khan* the leader of the Afghan delegation asked if he could have a private interview with Mr*Kahim and myself to explain matters which he could not well discuss in open assembly* Accordingly on Monday afternoon, May 26th, he came to this Legation and explained that the real trouble had been Soviet Russia's objections to the construction of an aerodrome in Herat and that until these had been overcome the whole of Afghanistan's civil aviation schemes must be held in abeyance* This made it clear that in no circumstances could the Indian Mission have achieved the immediate inauguration of civil air services to Afghanistan and it is perhaps unfortunate that so much publicity had already been given in the Indian press to this as the object of their visit* The failure of the mission to achieve its larger objective was therefore a foregone conclusion and was due to circumstances beyond its control* Subsequent discussions of the possibility of a large loan for general development purposes had little direct connection with the subject in hand and I do not quite see how these can possibly have been held to have come within the scope of the mission's brief however enlarged it may have been* Satisfactory progress however seems to have been made in purely technical discussionsand no doubt the mission's own report will show that frpnj this point of view useful results have been achieved® ' ^ f J47 4. As regards my Counsellor's general observations with which I am in entire agreement, it is perhaps a pity that the mission could not have obtained from the External Affairs Department more inform ation regarding social conditions in Afghanistan and perhaps I am myself in some measure to blame for not having prepared guidance notes on these subjects beforehand* Had it been possible to have given longer notice of the actual composition of the mission, of the date of its arrival and of the ground it was intended to cover, some of this confusion might have been avoided* It was certainly a pity that the mission should by its very composition have raised in quite such an acute form the communal issues that unhappily dlfide India today* The Afghans are of course fully aware of the situ ation but official discussions of the internal difficulties in India have hitherto been scrupulously avoided* That Afghan officials, including the Prime Minister, who gave Mr.hahim a two hour interview before his departure, should have taken full advantage of the position to discover all that they could about possible future political developments in India was only to be expected* 5® It is too early to appraise the final results of the mission but I think that there can be no doubt that its visit will have served a useful purpose® On his arrival the Director-General of Civil Aviation Informed me that he had, subject to my approval, been given specific instructions to make a special effort to return Afghan hospitality and though I was at first somewhat doubtful of the wisdom of such a course I was able to ascertain that the Afghan Government, though not wishing to put the mission to any trouble, were by no means averse to this suggestion* As a result the mission gave a very popular and successful garden party at Bagh-i-Babar on May 29th which was attended by the Prime Minister, Afghan Cabinet Ministers, Members of the Diplomatic Corps and other guests to the number of approximately 200* I think that there can be no doubt that the publicity achieved by this move and by the arrival of the Bristol Wayfarer plane on two occasions (it returned to India between the 24th and 28th) and the flight which it gave on the 30th to certain Afghan Cabinet Ministers and other members of the Afghan delegation have stimulated general interest in civil aviation in Afghanistan and may make the Afghan Government somewhat less nervous in their approach to the subject than they have been hitherto* Now that the ground has been cleared by discussions I hope that it may be possible for me in due course to ascertain the real opinion of the Afghan Government on the whole subject and possibly to bring them round gradually to the view that the advantages of some such service as is now offered by India might more than outweigh the difficulties with which they are at present obsessed* 6* I am sending copies of this letter to the Foreign Office and the India Office* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, To The Secretary, External Affairs Department, New Delhi.

Practically all members of the Mission were in possession oi visiting cards at their homes but hardly any brought these as they imagined that Kabul was not civilised enough for the use of visit ing cardsl In fact, one member of the Mission told me that they did not know whether civilized or modern bath room furniture would be provided or whether they would have to go out into the open for certain purposes for which a bath room is used. Practically all of them had dinner jackets, dark suits etc. at their homes and would have liked to have brought these instead of the ordinary rough and plain clothes which they brought with them. (2) Practically all members of the Mission were unaware of diplo matic and similar obligations resting on members of a Mission visiting a foreign country and particularly a place like Kabul where the Afghans are most touchy and sensitive to what th^y see and hear. Certain very embarrasing moments occurred during^the visit of the Mission which could have been avoided easily if the members had been informed beforehand about what should be the normal social and semi-official procedure of contact with ill embers of the Afghan Government and of foreign Missions. (3) It appears that absolutely no specific and binding directive was given to members of the Mission which ?euld have restricted their discussions at the Air Conference meetings and otherwise to the subject of Civil Aviation only. The result was that more time was spaat on discussing the question of the general loan for Afghanistan and other allied subjects rather than examining the technical possibilities and improvements and adjustments of facilities available in Afghanistan for the establishment of Civil Aviation in the country. I doubt if anything more than the work on the first and second day was done by the Sub Committees in this connection. They certainly did not go to Kandahar and Herat and possibly did not even examine in detail the facilities available for Civil Aviation in those areas. (4) The very great importance to India and also to the Afghan mind of avoiding any comments, discussions or partisan attitude towards Indian politics was apparently not sufficiently emphasised to the members of the Mission before th«y left the country and the result was that some of them fell into the trap and spoke about Various matters connected with Indian politics which could have been safely left unsaid. (5) It was also obvious that the social relations between members of a technical mission such as the present one and members of Foreign Missions at Kabul were not communicated to our people.The Leader of the Mission therefore followed the usual practice in India and called on foreign Embassies and Legations as well as various Afghan Ministers. If this practice was to be followed it would have oaen a good thing if the Leader had been given a fairly carefully drawn up Aide Memolre and a short description account of the status, position etc. of the various Missions at Kabul so as to avoid altfpos si bill ties of his making mistakes regarding the rank, etc. ot the Heads of the Missions and other matters which in diplomatic spheres are closely; connected with and are fairly important, for such occasions. (6) Lastly* I feel it would bsve been a good thing to warn the meabars of the Mission and certainly the Leader that in the present state of Indian Politics and particularly the Indian representation at Kabul extraordinary care was to be exercised in discussing any Indian affair so as not to create a wrong impress ion in the mind of the Afghan Govt, regarding the approach to Afghanistan by India or Indian parties in any one or other direction. ; W- Bahi. 30.6.47.mmmmmmmmmmmmFzrns* -« 3 «- aiiG aaterj, ,1 vk s t irt?

(S) 7 ixirlng the couree of the ciiscuesions between the Indian Civil Aviation Mission and th» Afghan delegation* on which I shall be reporting separately* it soon became apparent that whatever assist ance the Mission night be able to offer still the Afghan Govera^ient would not be prepared to take any immediate action for the inaugur ation of air services between the two countries. At Monday*s session M. Rajibullsh Khan* the head of the Afghan delegation* was driven to admit that their unwillingness to push their discussions to their logical conclusion was due to international considerations which he would discuss privately with the leader of the Indian Mission and myself. This he has now done and I nave also had a further explanation of the whole business from All Muhammad Khan* the Minister for Foreign Affairs. 2. Briefly the position is that the Kuaaian re cuions to the visit of the American Air Mission to Herat ax* the end of January which were only apparent after the Afghan Government had issued their invitation for the present mission from India to visit Kaoul (vide my tele gram Jgn .lfi of the 1st February 1947 addressed to the Government of India) have been so violent that the Afghan Government much against their will have been compelled to call a halt to their projects. The details which All Muhammad gave me are briefly as follows. After the departure of the American Mission in February the Soviet Ambassador called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and informed him bluntly that his Govermoent understood that the Afghans were considering the inauguration of civil aviation services involving the construction with American assistance of an aerodrome at Herat and possibly others elsewhere in Northern Afghanistan* but that under no circumstances could the Soviet Governjaant permit any such undertaking* Such a scheme was* in Ku&amp;sian eyes* merely an extension of the Anglo-American policy of encirclement of Soviet Hussia which was being followed tiirou&amp;hout the Near and Middle bast* and these aerodromes would be a threat to the security of Soviet Hussia. , The Russian Government considered Northern Afghanistan to be their own sphere of influence and if the Afghan Government wished to develop aerodromes and air services in this part of the country the Hussions were ready to give them assistance in so doing. 3. All Muhaumad was very angry and replied that he could not possibly submit to the theory that Afghanistan was divided into 'spheres of lnfluenee ,, and must categorically reject any claim on the part of the Soviet Government to ixiterfcx'e in any way in Afghanistan's internal affairs. There were many ways in which Hussia could in the past have helped mid could now help Afghanistan if she were sincere in her offers of assistance* but no real help had ever been given. He added that Russia should welcome rather than object to the construction of aerodromes in Northern Afghanisttn by the Americans as in the event of war it would take the Americans at least five hours to occupy any of them whereas the Russians would be in a position to do so in half an hour or less and would no doubt find them most useful. The Russian Ambassador failed to see any thing humonous in this and complained that it was no matter for levity. He subsequently repeated his warning both to the Prime Minister before he left for Hussia on April 14th end also to the King in person when he presented to him a new motor car on behalf of the Soviet Government. 4. All Muhammad admitted that though it was one thing to reject the claim of the Soviet Government it was quite another thing to continue with their projects in the face of Russian threats. Th» matter had formed the subject of anxious cabinet discussions over the past months and they had reluctantly come to the conclusion that they could proceed no further unless they were assured of full American and British support for their complete economic programme.^ w i I don't quite see how, ersonalities and portfolios eing distributed as they are m India. Col. Crichton is usefully to disseminate the perfectly sound morals that Sir Giles Squire, in his personal letter, draws from this ,f entertaining” incident. D.T.M. 17 / 6 .l. DEPARTi EIn’T.

I NJM AN CIVIL AVIATION MISSION TO KABUL FOR USE BY DEPARTMENT ONLY In the despatches and private letters below Sir Giles Squire describes the visit of an Indian Civil Aviation Mission to Kabul. The Mission was headed by the new Director General of Ciyll Aviation, Mr. M.I. Rahim, ICS, and contained, among other Government officiaJLs, two representatives of Indian Civil Aviation lines. Sir Giles Squire complains that although the Mss ion, according to his information, was a M technical Mission to discuss details for the organisation of air services] between India and Kabul” it had air agreement ready for signature. This consideraj embarrassed/ /c f «---»* i-Jl embarrassed the Afghans who were in no position to conclude any agreement. Tk* Counsellor of the Legation attended the several meetings held, and his, i-eport is attached to Sir Giles Squire's letter No.P.674/44 °f st May to the Government of India. From this report 5_t‘ seems that satisfactory progress was made on purely technical (discussions, but the Indian object of concluding an agreement wq.s not possible of achievement. Official^ the Afghans explained that any civil air agreement was dependent on a large loan to complete their 15 year programme of which this agreement would.form a part. In a private meeting, however, between Mr. Rahim, His Majesty's Minister and Najibullah Khan (Acting Minister for Education; and. leading -• Afghan Delegate) the latter explained that, the resp. cause. : of their inability to conclude any agreement had been Russia's objection to an aerodrome at Herat (see despatch No. 46). Thereafter the meetings strayed on to the subject of loans; a smaller loan for civil aviation only was no use to them until the larger loan was assured and the Afghan Government were already negotiating with the U.S. for the latter^ Subsequently Najibullah Khan produced his Minister for Natioi|al Economy at one of the sessions, who explained that Afghanistan wanted a loan of 250 crores and gave details of how they intended to repay. On tftr. ■ooioJi oiete, Sir Giles Squire deplores the. Muslim League partisanship displayed.by Mr. Rahim to all and sundry, ■— of which Afghan btioiaCea took full advantage to obtain first hand information of Indians internal political difficulties, a subject which had been scrupulously avoided up till, then in Kabul.

FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM 6, Albuquerque Road, New Delhi. 22nd May, 1247. ?- i Dear France Civil Aviation Service in Afghanistan j , It appears from reports which have reached this office- that Afghan Government have under consideration a number of schemes for the inauguration of civil air services in the country. The first scheme involved negotiations with an American Mission under General Giles sent by Trans-World Airways, and as the result of which the following proposals were made to the Afghan Government, (a) The establishment of services between - (ij Tehran and Kabul via Herat and Kandahar; (ii) Kabul and 3^ahrauvia Kandahar and Lingah; (iii) Kabul and Karachi via Kandahar and Quetta; (b) That 5 or 6 Dakota aircraft be used and T.W. A. provide the pilots and technical staff to operate the services. (c) Inauguration of the services to costi255,000; operation of the services for the first year to cost dn ,354,59^; revenue from the services to show a profit of 78,92o over operating costs. No details are available as to the extent to which T. W. A. are prepared to finance this venture but it is doubtful if the Afghan Government could afford to lay out even 50^ of the cost of starting the services, nor even to pay for the construction of a 2,000 metre runway at Kabul. It appears that the Afghans ha«t expected the Americans to make all necessary runways and to build up the ground organisation, whereas the Americans expected the Afghans to do j this. For these reasons it would not appear that much progress would be made—^ on this scheme for some time to come. 2. The second scheme which has been considered by the Afghan Government is the inauguration of an Afghan National Air Services Company to provide services between:- 3. On the basis of the above services a number of paper plans sire said to have been made, the most recent of which envisages - (a) the foimation of a Company with Capital of ^s.5,000,000 (Afghanis) (equal to Rs.1,250,000 (Indian)); (b) purchase of 6 Avro XIX aircraft. Only nebulous calculations of operating costs etc. have so far been made. A feature of the plan, however, is that the services would be operated by Afghan Air Force personnel using military airfields. It is reported that no Afghan yet possesses a ,r B' Class Flying Licence at present. 4. It has recently been announced in Delhi that a Government of India Civil Aviation Delegation, which includes representatives of the R. I. A.F. and the Indian civil air companies, is leaving for Kabul on the 22nd May at the request of the Government of Afghanistan. The Mission hopes to negotiate an agreement between Afghanistan and India. The Government of India h&amp;ofc previously for some years been contemplating asking for the Afghan Government’s permission to extend the Delhi/Lahore/Peshawar service on to Kabul, but it had then been decided that it would be better if matters could be so arranged that the initiative came from the Afghan Government. It is understood that when /the R. E. France, Esq., Secretary of the UKRI Committee, Cabinet Offices, S.W.1.OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM 6, Albuquerque Road, New Delhi. 2 . the Afghan Education Minister, Mr* Ifeji Bullah Khan passed last autumn on his return from the Regional Conference of P. I. C. A.O. at^ Cairo the Government of India raised the question of extension of the air services* Mr. Haji Bullah Khan then invited the Government of India to send a delegation; the departure of the Indian Mission is the result of this invitation. It is understood that the Indian Civil air companies are not impressed with the Afghan Governments plans for internal services in Afghanistan - see paragraph 2 above, as they are sceptical of the Afghan's ability to provide the capital and necessary ground organisation. It is not anticipated that anything more will eventuate from the present Mission than an extension to Kabul of the existing service to Peshawar. Yours sincerely, R.E.

V Exte 8518/4^ Subject : - Civil Air Services An Afghanistan The main theme in this despatch is the progress made towards the establishment of civil air services in Afghanistan; this is chiefly the work of MtNajibullah Khan, Af^ian Minister for Education, who represented the Afghan Government at the Air Navigation Meeting at Cairo in October#’ As a result of the negotiations in Cairo and of the talks which he had in' Delhi on his way to and from Cairo, it appears likely that there will soon be regular air • services both east and west from Kabul# • At Cairo M.NaJibullah Khan . . arranged for an Afghan Airways Conpany to be startedj with the assistance of Trans-^orld Airways, on the lines of the Iranian Airways* This Company will operate a reciprocal service between /KabulKabul and Tehran with the Iranian Airways, and the service will probably start next Spring. This joining of hands with Tehran is a complete reversal of the previous policy of the Afghan Government who had rejected a request from the Iranian Airways for the Inauguration of a service between Kabul and Tehran; it was thought that a concession to one neighbour might lead to a demand for similar concessions from Russia. In Delhi M.Najibullah Khan is tnderstood to have made a similar agreement for reciprocal services with India, to run between Peshawar and Kabul and between Quetta and Kandahar. • - A T.W.A. Advisory Mission is expected to arrive in Kabul shortly to help in making Kwaja Rawash aerodrome suitable for use and to install it with the requisite equipment. Planes will be American and to start with the Indian services will be run by Dakotas. Until sufficient Afghan personnel have been trained to operate the services pilots and ground staff will be American. Sir Giles Squire strikes a note of regret that the BOAC have taken no part In the new* developments. It looks at the moment as if the Afghan Government will rely entirely on /American ^L 1 American help for maintaining the air conpany, bat they are still hoping to conclude the contract for the new Avro planes from England. If, as appears likely, this contract is not concluded whe use of British aircraft in Afghanistan will be confined to the Air Force.

The A ir Jvlission headed by G-eneral Giles the Vice President of Trans-. ; /orid Airways has not arrived in Kabul so far and it is believed that the I.ission has retumed to Cairo from Teheran. The Mission is to visit Kabul at a later date and the Afghan Government are desirous of importing from India 1,000 gallons of 100 Octane aviation spirit to meet the possiole requirements of their aircraft. It is understood that a similar Mission representing Pan-American airways will also visit Kabul in the near future.Extract from Middle East Summary No* !• Afghanistan . 21. During the last war proposals were mooted to run a courier service Delhi-Kabul. In 194-1 the proposal was held up for fear that a similar concession would be made to the G eiman Lufthansa and when it was finally put to the Afghan Government it was refused. In 1945 it was never raised officially since the India Government had no aircraft available except Lend-Lease Beech-craft and there were political objections to their use at the time. 22. Up to date the only two proposals for air services to Afghanistan have come from the India Government! first, for India to ope ate an extoision of the Calcutta-Peshaw service to Kabul: secondly, to operate a joint Indo-Afghan circular service Peshawar - Kabul - Kandahar - Quetta. 23. In February 1946 we received a report through the Military Attache at Kabul that Afghanistan was negotiatin^rith the U.S. Government for an international air service to be routed through Afghanistanj at the same time they would welcome the establishment of a similar British air service and British technical assistance in the construction of airfields and other installations. Afghan desire to see international air ser vices staging in their country has been expressed ;r©re recently by Najibullah Khan, the Afghan representative at the P.I.C.A.O. Middle East Regional Conference: he specifically said that the question of the feeder service Peshawar - Kabul, though by no mesans shelved was being subordinated to this primary aim: one of such international air services would, he hoped, be British.Extract from Middle E ast Sunmaiy No. 2. AFGHANISTAN : 8 ?. In spite of Afghan desire to see a U.K. trunk route going thiougi Afghanistan, the re-routing through Afghanistan of our landplane routes to India and i'ar East or Australia is not considered practical, but^ consideration may be given in the future to extending the U.K. - Teheran service to Kabul. - • 88 . India is actively considering the conclusion of an agreement with Afghanistan, which they think should be negotiated urgently in view of a United States proposal to route their service to India through Afghanistan. The various Indian proposals are:- (a) ' an extension of the Calcutta - Peshawar service to Kabul, giving Afghanistan reciprocal rights on the Kabul - Peshawar sector: (b) proposal to form a joint Afghanistan - Indian company, operating with Dakotas (later Vikings) on a three-times weekly frequency (ultimately a daily frequency) from Kabul to Peshawar, and linking at Peshawar with services to Delhi and Calcutta. India will be prepared to offer technical assistance and training facilities at the civil aviation training centre which she is forming in India. (c) a joint Afghanistan - Indian company operating a service Peshawar-Kabul - Kandahar - Quetta. j i 7■HHH ' »o« Sion &gt;mcK, s.k. u ‘doth 'ioveaber, 134^. 10^41/104 U/MMj ( — &gt; ■S'* S 4 8124 I-e«r Chancre /, | a enclose o-igticpt aoir raaponf*«nce axetiangee nit? ; ■ I rr&gt; regarding a ciTl aviation agreement which in uire is shout to negotiate with the Afghan Qorerasient acting on behalf of the Govemaent of India* £• a y &gt;u will sec the agreement relate© only to the oper tion of cervices het~e©n India and /fghanlstua* and a Bermuda type agj eeiaent wouid Indeed aeeai rather portentous for achieving the liaised objectives in view.

F. 417-F/46 of 10th September last about the propo'sed ”cTvTl~avi at ion negotiations on behalf of the Government of India with the Government of Afghanistan, 2. We appreciate that Squire must be authorised to negotiate on the basis desired by the Government of India and concur in your proposal that he should be instructed accordingly. At the same time we are most anxious that the Americans should be informed of the position as early as possible since, although their local representatives no doubt know better, their officials in Washington may fail to appreciate the constitutional reasons why any of His Majesty’s Representatives should, on behalf of the Government of India but with our approval, embark on negotiations for an agreement deviating* from the Bermuda model so soon after the recent Anglo-American civil aviation talks. If the United Kingdom Government were to embark on negotia tions for a bilateral civil aviation agreement with the Afghans, we should both wish and, in view of our recent statements of policy, be obliged to base them on the Bermuda model: and if the Americans should embark on similar ventures they might well ask us to give them our moral support as we have expressed our willingness to do, on request, in the countries in the Middle East: in view of our special position in Afghanistan, and particularly if Squire had himself negotiated a non-Bermuda agreement for the Government of India, there would be the greater need for us to comply with such a request. 3./ D.M. Cleary, Esq., India Office'.3. To anticipate these possible eventual!- - ties and to forestall any loose talk in American civil aviation circles in Washington, we should much appreciate it if you would agree, with reference to your telegra m No, 16929 of the 17th September to the Government of Tndia, to instruct the Deputy High-Cormissioner to explain the position to the United States Representative in New Delhi, and Squire to do likewise to his United States colleague in Kabul. We could then notify our Embassy in Washington of the instructions v/hich you had issued so that they in their turn could inform the State Department if they so wished. Furthermore as it seems likely that the Americans will hear of these negotiations from their Representative in Kabul soon after their commencement, we hope that by explaining the position frankly to them now we may divert them from any possible v/ish to muscle in by giving the Afghans unsolicited advice about ’pure Bermuda* which might embarrass Squire. 4. I should hesitate to trouble you with the above requests were it not that our civil aviation honeymoon appears to be characterized by an extrava gance of frankness on the American part as to v/hat they are up to everywhere, and to the fact that General Brownell, who has been sent out as President Truman’s personal representative for civil aviation matters to the Middle East and India, appears to be totally incapable of understanding the purpose and limitations of British influence in countries with which we have been closely associated. 5.

Najib~ullah Khan, Minister for Education, Afghanistan, visited this Directorate on the 12th September to aiscuss with D.G*. civil aviation in Afghanistan. D.D.G.(A) was present. The Minister stated that Ms Oovt^s policy was first to negptiate internata onal routes through Persia and Afghanistan, calling at Kabul. They proposed fo feive preference to B.O.A.C. if this was possible. If it could be arranged, they would like to have several international routes through their country. The Minister was on his way to attend the PICAC Regional Air Navigation Meeting for the Middle East shortly to be held at Cairo, and stated that he would return through Delhi, and would again visit this Directorate when he hoped to have some more concrete proposals to make. 3. Tith regard to Indian servjc es into Afghanistan, he stated that his Govt, would welcome a service between India and Kabul, but that their policy is to negotiate the international routes first, and then deal with routes with India. D.G. stressed the ass is tance that India could give to Afghanistan i* 1 tha development of their own airways, if they were proposing to do so, by the training of personnel at Indian schools and aero dromes. He also mentioned that India could give some technical advice and assistance. R.E. stated that he fully appreciated this, and would inform his Govt. It is likely that there will be considerable delay before any international routes will come into operation through Afghanistan, and it is obvious that it should be the policy of the Indian Govt, to endeavour to persuade the Afghanistan Govt, to change their policy, and to allow Indian airways to operate to Kabul immediately, especially as this would^ensure the development of the aerodrome at Kabul and its technical facilities. H.E. appeared to be much interested in the idea of a servic e between Kabul, Kandahar, Quetta and Karachi, possibly operated by a Join t Indian-Afghan company.MINISTRY OF CIVIL AVIATION, 1 -^ARIEL HOUSE, .* STRAND, LONDON, W.C.2. 9th October, 19*f6 Your letter No* xliS.T* ^422^^6 of the 30th September to Burkett, regarding the air service to Afghanistan apparently crossed in tne po^t ^ le tter No* Sxl. 735 of 3rd Oct ober to Harrison.

Charge d*Affaires, ^abul, of which a copy was sent to us, containing the information that the Afghan Government are keen to have a through airline or several airlines passing through ^abul, and would like one of these to be British* We have considered this matter, but do not .think that there is any likelihood of our routeing any of our main trunk services through Afghanistan. Apart from economic considerations the route is not an attractive one from the flying point of view, and we have always envisaged that a service between India and Afghanistan and onwards to Persia should be left to India to provide. Possibly we might at some time consider the extension of the London—Ankara-Teheran service to Qabulj but this is a matter for the future, and in any case would not constitute a through service.

CIO &lt;*&gt;v please rofer to previous minutes on Ext.7080/45, in the ligtit of which our letter to India of 13 th February, 1946, was drafted. The Government of India do not consider that the Model Draft Agreement circulated by the Foreign Office would fom a suitable basis for the proposals which they intend to make to the Afghan Government. They consider that F.M.G. themselves have had to resile from the position embodied in the Model Draft, and point out that in the special circumstances prevailing in Afghanistan, particularly hav4yregard to the Afghans’ ignorance of civil aviation matters, a different approach is required. Apart fran the merits of the case, the constfctional position in India has now so greatly altered that the authorisation of His Majesty's Minister Kabul by H.M.G. to make the approach suggested by the Government of India to the Afghan Government is merely a formality unless there is some specific interest of H.M.G. involved. When the matter was last discussed it was made clear that there was no question of a British air line through Afghanistan and / if this sti^l ho].ds good, we need have no hesitation in telegraphing^His Majesty's inister) as requested by the Government of India.

Further, since the circulation of the British standard form of agreement, His Majesty’s Government in their negotiations with the United States at Bermuda in January 1946 have had to resile from the position which they adopted at Chicago and which was - tf^.D.O.No. F.674/44 of the 26th May 1946. As pointed out the Afghans hnve only a vague idea of the commitments embodied in principle in that form. The United Kingdom United States of America agreement abandons the regulation. .m r - 2 - c 4 0 • ) ! W i i— regulation by Government 6f the opacity operated in international air services and concedes the privilege of carrying Fifth Freedom traffic. This agreement with the United States of America must considerably modify His Majesty's Government's approach to other countries, and we do not consider that it would be advisable to make play with the principles in the British standard form of agreement at this stage with the Afghans, 5, Moreover, the Government of India have not entirely accepted the British standard form of agreement and put forward an alternative which was accepted by the Commonwealth Air Transport Council, This form has been used in our counter-proposals to the United States Government (a copy was sent to the India Office with Posts and Air Department letter No, 8-M(A)/l-46 dated 22nd January 1946), It has already proved necessary to prepare a modified form and if we are to approach the Afghan Government on the basis of a uro forma agreement, we would prefer to adopt a modification of our own form rather than the British standard form. In view of the Bermuda developments, however, we m^y have some difficulty in maintaining our own stand and we should prefer to await developments before putting a form of agreement to the Afghan Government, 6, Meanwhile, we are anxious that no time should be wasted in discussing abstruse principles with the Afghan Government, We have a concrete proposal to put to them and it is desirable to keep the discussions as simple and as flexible as possible in the initial stages and if possible throughout. They are more likely to understand a simple proposal to service from A to B, withmtmmm TT— r ~ rm v .iL T - 3 - b 4 ^ rJ the type of aircraft, the frequency and the part they — ... » are to play in terms of aircraft, aerodromes, men and money; and from such a discussion we should hope to elicit their ideas and to he able to mould our proposals in order tp secure agreement. If necessary, we could offer to assist the Afghan Government to establish operations at their end by the supply of any available equipment and by technical advice. / 7* The fact that the United States of America Government in the Bermuda agreement have scheduled an air service via Afghanistan to India makes an approach to the Afghan Government on our part all the more urgent. It does not follow thrt we should agree to an American Air Service to India via Afghanistan, but if the Americans were to open negotiations with the Afghans for the opening of this route the chances of our own approach being successful would be greatly reduced. 8. In all the circumstances, we hope His Majesty's Government will now agree to Mr. Squire approaching the Itoke* s Afghan Government early as suggested injpgr demi-official letter to Crichton No. D.12443-F/45 dated the 7th January 1946. We should be grateful for a reply by telegram. A copy of a note which we propose to send Mr. Squire for his guidance is enclosed. 9. I am sending a copy of this letter to Mr. Squire. Cleary , Esquire, External Department, /L. India Office, LONDON .r r H...Q y i /; In his informal approach to the Afghan Government His Majesty's Minister should firsh propose an extension of the Calcutta-Peshawar Air Service to Kabul suggesting that this be run by an Indian Company and offering the Afghans the reciprocal right, if they care to exercise it, of running a service themselves between Kabul and Peshawar. 2* If this is not acceptable, then the formation of a Joint comapny might be proposed for the Peshawar - Kabul route. The Indian interest in this company would be held by the operators of the Calcutta- Peshawar Service who would charter their planes to the Joint company for the Peshawar - Kabul extension. The advantage of this arrangement to the Afghans would be that the Joint company would not have to purchase their own aircraft. The operating cost of an extension of the Calcutta - Peshawar Service to Kabul would be about Rs. if lakhs per annum, exclusive of income received. The Service would be a high grade one with aircraft of a large type e.g., Dakotas and there would be at the outset three up to a daily service, according to the traffic demands, and to introduce modern transport aircraft of the Vickers Viking type. From Peshawar there will be a through service via Delhi to Calcutta affording connections with the main air transport services in India and with the main international % air services radiating from India. 3. The Government of India would be willing to assist the Afghan Government to establsh operations at their end by the supply of any avilable equipment flights per week between Peshawar and Kabul. Later it would be the intention to increase the frequency *ndand by technical advise on such masters as aeteorlogical and wireless communication, extension of airfields etc. and would send technical experts to visit Kabul to discuss details of this kind with the Afghan authorities In addition, the Government of India would be pleaded to assist the Afghan Government in regard to the training of all grades of technical personnel required in civil aviation - aircrews, aerodrome control staff, radio staff, meteorological staff, etc. i. Civil Aviation Training Centre is being formed in India, where facilities would be made available for the training of Afghan nationals? who, to finish their training, might be given some practical working experience in the Indian Civil Aviation Organisation. 4. It is understood that the Afghan Government may be interested in the establishment of a loop service over the route Peshawar - Kabul - Kandahar - Qoetta, connecting with Indian air services, both at Peshawar and Quetta. The commercial and operational possibilities of such a service would require investigation and the Government of India would be prepared to arrange for this to be undertaken. The operation of such an air service might be undertaken by the Joint Company proposed above. Aircraft for the operation of this service might at fir t chartered but at a later stage it would be appropriate for the Joint Company to acquire aircraft of own for operating this service. The nucleus thus • formed would provide a basis for further developments which might later arise for air services wihin Afghanistan,D. 0, No. 692/44. f b i British Legation, Kabul. 1 5th September 1946. %- Lill you kii^dlv T&amp;tir to-^ur letter No. Ext. 4829/46 of the 22nd July 1546? 2. as you will have seen from our telegram No« 97 _of the ord September, the Afghan Government have selected Aiiqadr Sa'daqalinaab Aqai Najibullah Khan Tourvayana, Acting Minister of Education, to represent them at the Middle Eastern Regional Air Navigation Meeting to be held in Cairo.

Subject:- Civil Aviation in Afghani atari * Reference attached copy of a draft on the above subject* 2* It ia proposed to hold a meeting of the representatives of the P* &amp; A*. VV&amp;r, Finance and F.A.Deptt# on Friday the 14th December 1945 at 3 P*M* in the External Affaire Department to consider the Question of introducing an air service or services to Afghanistan with special referenee to the following Questions (i) Oli wtet route or routes is it desired to operate the proposed aervice i*e* is it to be a circular service to Kabul, Kandahar, Quetta or merely a trunk service Delhi. Lahore, Peshawar, Kabul or both? These questions are to be considered both from the commercial and political points of view. (ii) whatever type of service is to be instituted, are the practical requirements available - men, *x machines ground installations etc*? will Air Force aerodromes at Peshawar and ^etta be available to this service? fill there be aoy objection to service crossing over existing prohibited areas nd on thpy be modified if ana When the air service is organised? (iii) To what extent (a) financially and (b) operationally # would the Afghan Government be asked to participate in the proposals? (ivQ To what extent are the proposed services to be regarded as (a) normal comnercial developments as parti of the general Post-war Civil Aviation plsns of the Govt, of India or (b) as desirable on merely political grounds? (v) To what extent, if any, should the Afghan Fund be utilised for meeting the cost of the proposed services? 3. In considering these Questions it has to be borne in mind that what we are trying to work out is not a complete detailed scheme but a basis for discussion with the Afghan Government in a preliminary approach. At the same time, anything we may offer to them even in this tentative scheme, we should probably not be able to avoid hivirg to give, if the Afghans accept the general idea and are prepared to negotiate a practical system to be introduced as soon as ffinxxii possible. 4. will the Departments concerned kindly nominate their representatives and say whether it will be convenient for them to attend the meeting on the date and time proposed? Since the service would involve the entry of foreigners into India, Home Deptt. may also like to send a representative, aid may therefore see. Sd/~ T.S.Br ovnsdon. Under Secretary(I) P. h a. Deutt.

This case was discussed with pQuire on his way to England* He said that the Afghan Government were not. really interested at present in air services and the first Jung wag to get thefli interested* The proposal ior splitting the services into two, namely (a) an Indian operated extension of the Calcutta- Peshawnr service as far as Kabul; end (b) a joint Indo-Afghan circular service Peshawar- Eab u 1-Kan dahar - nett a ? would not appeal to the Afghans, vfoo would be likely to insist either on our operating one service cntirely ana their oi^erating another service entirely, or on one service* The idea of an Indian operated^extension to Kabul, in which the Afghans would not share, will therefore have to be held in abeyance and not maationed to the Afghaa Government fear the present, though it continues to be regarded by the Government of India essentially a part of the trunk air service frem Calcutta. Tranediate efforts therefore are to be concentrated on the circular route Pe sh aw ar -Kabul -Kan dahar - ett a (to be operated jointly by the Afghans and ourselves* The idea of a joint service partly operating in one territory and partly in the other would' be likely to appel to them both as a reasonable Quid pro quo and also because they would not be expected, to meetnjie“whole of the capital operating cost.* It may # olso be mentioned in this connection that the pos+-war service Karachi-Ida ore is now to be routed via Quetta instead of via Jacobabad, and the Quetta-Afghans services will thus form a very convenient link. 5. The capital and operating costs of the Peshawar- Kabui-^uetta route have been worked out as in the enclosed statements. It is now suggested that this general scheme be put to the Afghan Government for consideration without any commitment on either side* It might be added that the cost of aerodromes, radio stations, etc. in Afghanistan would be the Afghan Governments share in the service and that Government of India would themselves be prepared to meet the rest of the capital cost, d that tne operating cost would be equally shared. This should be set out as a verygeneral proposal without at. a y gaHstai jwrsfpiisxk prejudice or commitment to obtain the A?gh&amp;n Government f a reactions, .ftiat we wish to do now is to get the Afghans used to the idea by putting some sort of a concrete scheme before them.

Duke explained that as circulation of the file had lad to very slow progress with the* production of an agreed draft letter to be sent to Kabul to enable the Minister to make an approach to the Afghan G-overnmert it was hoped to reach definite conclusions by discussion in this meeting. The points for consideration as External Affairs Department understood them were set out in External Affairs Department u/o T T o. 11662-F/45 dated 6th December 1945 which had been circulated to all concerned. The question of routes was first discussed. IT. Duke said that IT. Squire’s advice ha=d been that although the only link which the Government of India desired was between Peshawar and Kabul the Afghan Government would be unlikely to agree directly to that and the approach should therefore be made by suggesting a circular service through Peshawar, juetta, Kandahar and Kabul to be operated by Coy. ir which the Afghan Govt, should share equally with the Indian. IT. Shoobeft said that India only wanted the Peshawar to Kabul portion of the service in Afghanistan. Mr. Zinkin said that Finance Department were only p r eppred to sup art the Peshawar - Kabul service, and on the suggestion of Sir Frederick Tymms it was agreed that as the loop service via Kandahar and ^etta was of no commercial interest to India a frank approach should be made to the Afghan Government and they should be told what we wanted. .-e should first try for the extension of the Calcutta - Peshawar service to Kabul to be run bv an Indian Company offering the Afghans the reciprocal right if they care to exercise it of runnir^ a service themselves between Kabul and Peshawar. If this was not agreed to then the formation of a joint Company might possibly be proposed for the Peshawar--K b bul portion of the service. The Director-General, ^ivii Aviation was opposed to the use of small plants, and /rec onm endedrecommended that the service should be run as a high grade OEe with no planes smaller than e«g. Dakotas, din^/ Goomander ./iggintcri agreed with this, bir Frederick Tymras emphasized that there v;ould in any case be no Question of the Afejoans operating a joint service through to Calcutta* If they agreed to a joint service it could only be on the Kabul - Peshawar section. 3. The Question of the availability of aircraft and staff was next discussed. Sir Frederick Tyrrnis said that he thought that a service of the type contemplated could be put into operation within 12 months. 4. The Question of the use of Peshawar airfields an^ flying over the prohibited areas of the P orth-Jest Frontier were next considered. !?r. Bhore said that there was no objection to the use of the Peshawar airfields for a civil air service from the Jar Department’s point of view. Wing/Coraraander /igginton said that '-H* ,;(1) proposed to maintain Peshawar as a service airfield with the normal flying facilities and controls but that it would not be fully xcupied by service planes. There would be plenty of room in the air but a certain number of additional administrative buildings would have to be constructed for a civil airline. 5. Y/ith regard to prohibited are^s. Sir F.Tymns stated that it had been agreed before the Chicago Conference that the prohibited areas on the 1 orth-Jest Frontier would be limited to the Tribal Yrea and that a corridor for civil aviation through the Khyber pass would be permissible. He explained that one result of the Chicago Conference was that if a corridor was allied through a prohibited area for an international air service that corridor must be available for other international air service^ but that thi a need not prove an em bar rase mart in practice as ray international service wouli have to fly on a specified route to oe agreed separately and it was possible to stipulate another route for any other service which might be negotiated. 6. The question of the Afghan Cloverment f s participation in the sea vice was further considered. Sir F.Tyoms said that if the Afghan Government insisted on a joint company a small company could probably be organised the Indian interest in which would be held by the operators of the Calcutta- Peshawar line. The loint Company could then charter the same planes for the journey from Peshawar to Kabul so that the joint coy. would not have ~tb/ purchase their own planes. Mr• zirkin asked #iat the probable loss in running a direct service would be. Sir F*Tymns estimated that the operating cost of a service that was part of the larger one to Calcutta would be abaut ds#lf lakhs a year, exclusive of any income received. T^.Zinkxn said that Finance Department would agree to expenditure of this order whicn would be included in the posts &amp; Air Department budget as for an ordinarily subsidised Indian coairiercial service. Finance Department did not. want fcs ax the Afghan Fund to be used for this purpose, and were not to be understood as agreeing at'present to my capital expenditure in Afghanistan. If my such expenditure was considered necessary it would have to be treated as a separate proposal. 7. ]jr. Bhore raised the Question of search and rescue measures/for planes which might come down in Afghan territory. ^.Jijrlggintari considered and it was generally agreed tn-t the right would have to be reserved for service or other aircraft from India to search for civil aircraft lost in Afghanistan but it was considered that this point could be taken up at a later date. 8.8. As regards airfields in Afghanistan W/C* Ti ffg inton said that the one at Bherpur v/as of no use and that we should have to be al lowed to use that at Khwaja Rawash. The latter has no pucca runways but is suit*i)l Q in its present condition for use by Dakotas during 9 months m the year/i.e. when it is not wet or under snow. The Afghan Government had under consideration a proposal to build a 2,500£f yard concrete runway but were detterred by the cost and it was not anticipated that they would be willing to undeitaKe it for the sake of an Indian service from which they merely derived landing etc.fees. It was also mentioned that eome storage for a reserve of 100 octane aviation aua spirit would be required there, juestions of meteorological and wireless comnunicati ons were also discussed but it was finally decided that these points could all be settled later. 9. Sir F.Tyums however pointed out that His F^iesty’s Government had had to build all the airfields and installations required by British air lines in small or poor States such as tne Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf and Persia before the war, ae these could not posa bly afford to construct and maintain installations of the required standards. It would probably be necessary to consider similar assistance to Afghanistan. But it was decided that in view of the fact that the airfield at Khwaja Aawas was usable even in its present condition, this subject should not be raised with the Afghan Government nor any offer made to them on these lines in the first approach. The first thing was to make the approach to the Afghan Government on the broadest lines and if this was favourably received technical experts would have to visit Kabul to discuss the possibilities in more detail.

As you know these ideas are in complete conflict with those of the United States Government and the latter are no doubt being brought to the notice of the Afghans by the United States Legation, Kabul. I agree, however, that it would be well that such an indication the Afghans should not take the form proposed in the Foreign Office circular of 11th August. It would be better for it to be expressed in more general terms and to be described as the policy which H.LI.G. and the Government of India would ordinarily adopt in respect of services between their territories and other territories. I think that the Government of India are in the best position to draft such a statement for H.M. Legation, Kabul and it could be given 4- /-w 4- v.*!

It appears from Major Crichton* s lettei^of 26th October that no progress had been made by tha Uxt.57o9/45 ; date, and that meanwhile the Legation had received (without our knowledge) a circular of a draft fum of agreement intended to cover possible air services between the United Kingdo m and other States, which it was suggested should be ccmmunicated informally to the Afghan Government. Lajor Crichton appears to be doubtful of the wisdcm of this, no uoubt fearing that it might lead to confusion in the minos of the Afghans. Although Mr. Cheetham was present at the meeting, he appears not to realise the special circumstances of the case, and questions the necessity for consulting the Government of India.

As you will see, and as Crichton himself has noticed, this draft Form of Agreement covers possible air services between the United Kingdom and other States. It is not clear to us, therefore, why Crichton should have thought there could be any question of referring the draft to the Government of India or of securing their agreement, I and why he should not yet have taken action on our letter.

India Office.[ W 9346/24/802 ] Circular. Foreign Office, 11th August, 1945. Dear Chancery, We enclose a copy of the draft Form of an Agreement for Air Services which has been designed for use in the negotiation with foreign Governments of such bilateral Civil Aviation agreements as His Majesty’s Government may find it necessary to conclude. The main document is based on the Standard Form of Agreement for Provisional Air Routes drawn up at the Chicago Civil Aviation Conference, while its Annex incorporates the principles embodied in the British White Paper of October 1944 and upheld by the United Kingdom Delegation at Chicago. 2. We think it would be helpful if you were to com municate a copy of this document informally to the Government to which you are accredited, explaining that as soon as His Majesty’s Government have worked out their plan of routes they intend to propose to various countries the negotiation of a Civil Aviation agreement on the basis of the British draft. It should not be assumed, however, that we will necessarily wish to negotiate in the immediate future with all the Governments to whom we are communicating the draft, although we will wish to approach them sooner or later and in some cases have already taken the first steps. 3. One further point which you should explain is that the draft Agreement is designed to cover services on which Third, Fourth and Fifth Freedom rights would be required. Some of the provisions may, of course, be unnecessary or require to be varied in the actual Agreements to be negotiated with individual Governments. Yours ever, GENERAL DEPARTMENT.

The draft pro forma bilateral agreement submitted to the; first meeting of the Commonwealth Air Transport Council by the United Kingdom delegation as Conference Document No. 7 incorporated the provisional form of standard agreement adopted at Chicago and, in an Annex, provisions based on the standard clauses adopted at t .e Commonwealth Air Conferences in Montreal and London in 1944* The Annex in the United Kingdom draft was designed to deal with air services between two terminal countries. 2. The draft was remitted by the: Council for study by a Sub-Committee consisting of Sir Frederick Tymms and Mr. W.C.G. Cribbett. They concluded that it would not be possible to draft a standard for. of agreement which could be applied without variation or adaptation to the circumstances of every country or route. The simplest course would be to produce one or more specimen forms of agreement, based on the general principles of Commonwealth policy, for application in given conditions. The United Kingdom draft (c.A. T.C. Document Lo. 7)&gt; subject to certain drafting modifications, would be suitable in th case of negotiations affecting terminal countries, but it would need amplification to cover air services operating in transit across the territory of a contracting party. Whilst this purpose could have been served by adding further appropriate clauses it was felt that additional clauses in abstract terms, unrelated to specific air routes and countries, might prove difficult to comprehend. Accordingly in the interests of clarity it was decided to take India as an example of a transit country and to draw up a hypothetical bilateral agreement covering United States services operating to, over and through India. The Sub-Committee accordingly submit to the Council two forms of agreement for consideration, viz:- (a) the United Kingdom draft, as amended, for negotiation between two terminal countries (Appendix l) and (b) the Indian draft covering the position of a country both as a terminal and transit country. (Appendix II). The former reproduces C.A.T.C. Document 7 with certain drafting improvements and an additional Sub-paragraph (j) of paragraph 5 of the Annex, but does not include the modifications, recommended in paragraph 5 of this ID ort. The Annex of Appendix I lias been deliberately left on a flexible basis which enables capacity, frequencies and load factors, which must vary from route to route and from time to time, to be determined according to the circumstances of each route and inserted in the actual agreements cr dealt with by separate exchange of letters forming part of the agreement. Tor example, the 6&lt;J/o load factor discussed at Chicago for universal application in a multilateral Convention represented a conservative average which might be too low for certain routes and too high for others. A load factor of QOfo might reasonably be quoted for the London- Paris service, whereas a load factor of 55% might be appropriate to the conditions of operation between the United Kingdom and Latin America, advantage of this form of bilateral agreement is that the load factor appropriate to the particular service or services forming the subject of agreement can be separately determines and varied from time to time, as experience dictates. The Indian draft, on the other hand, is an example of an actual bilateral agreement which might be negotiated between the United States and India and therefore translates into specific terms the general provisions of the United Kingdom draft and, in addition, includes provision in paragraphs3 and 4 of the Annex for the transit position. 4. It is also considered that the agreement, as distinct from the Annex, is susceptible of modification to bring the Chicago standard form into line with current conditions and to include certain additional provisions which appear to be necessary. None of these modifications, in our view, is inconsistent with- Recommendation 2 of Resolution VIII of the Chicago Final Act (ihrt 1). These modifications, as described in the succeeding paragraphs, have been embodied in the Indian draft, and. should likewise be made to the United Kingdom draft in appropriate cases. /AGREEMENT0 2 AGKSEiSOT (a) Preamble and Final Articles it has not been the general custom in the past to make bilateral air transport agreements through the medium of plenipotentiaries whose signature requires ratii ication. The normal method of exchanging drafts, * with final signature by an officer authorised by the Government concerned, appears adequate: and more convenient for this pur &gt;ose# (b) Article 1. The provision lor immediate inauguration of the air services, in thn, original Article i, is adequately covered by Article 2 and may be deleted. (o) Article 2. The immediate inauguration of the services is made subject to subsequent governing articles. The conception of an 'operating permission' to the designated air line, subsequent to the conclusion of the agreement (which itself should be operative) appears unnecessary; the first part of ohe Chicago article gives an unqualified right, and it is then inconsistent t° make the subsequent 'operating permission' subject to other provisions for delay. A new clause 2(b) has been inserted. It is essential that the inauguration ol air services should only be permitted when the air route is suitably organised, and the contracting party responsible for the air route must be given discretion in this matter. While the clause may not be entirely in accord with the Chicago draft, the alternative would be to defer agreement. (d) Article 3» A new article has been 'inserted to ensure the provision of the statistics, without which the capacity cannot be determined in accordance with the Annex. To wait for international statistics to be published would not be practicable. (c) Article 11. It appears desirable to expand this reference to the multilateral general convention. The coming into force of the Convention on Inter- national Civil Aviation will not affect the terms of the agreement, except in the matter of references and no amendment of the agreement will then be necessary . This article of the Chicago draft had reference to a convention for the regulation of international air transpDrt, which is still to be negotiated. 6 . The following additional explanations are given of the form and specific features of the Indian draft:- AGKEEMENT (a) Article A« It appears necessary to give specific rights to use all ground organisation provided for public use on the specified air routes. A new clause ( 1 ) has been inserted. ANNEX (b) Paragraphs 1 and 2. Paragraphs 1 to 4 of the United Kingdom draft designating air lines and specifying the air routes could, it seems, be conveniently condensed into two paragraphs in an actual agreement. /( c ) G.107,711It appears desirable to restrict this paragraph to a c oar statement ol the traffic -which may 'be carried 'by the designated arr lines. Following the principles discusses at Chicago, ^he right is gi/en, subject to limitation of capacity, to carry third and fourth freedom traffic (vide 3 (a)(i)) and third, fourth and fifth freedom traffic in tranoi ^ across the territory of the other party (vide 3 (a)(iij). ^ ihe fxro rag is universally agreed - the second cannot reasonably be withhe u. e carriage of fifth freedom traffic to and from the oerritory ^ contracting party is permitted subject to the consenu of ^ 11 ^ 1 '- ° a c '. \ concerned (vide 3 (• a -) (^-'i-i)), subject to its being justifiea (vi e para. ), and subject to its being carried purely as incidental trail ic l^viae paragraph 5 (v)). (d) Paragraph J+_._ This reproduces the criteria, prescribed in che U.K. draft, buc at is contemplated that fifth freedom rights shall be normally conceded, as an incidental, where there is no national service. (e) Idragraph 3. In this article are grouped all the provisions prescribing how the capacity of the air services is to be calculated from time to time. ^ The draft specifies a load factor of 60 per cent, to be used an ca leu lata on, This might be modified and a different figure substatuced an the course of negotiations. Sub-paragraphs 1 and 3 define respectively the total capacaty to be operated into the territory of each party. The bulk of the traffic defined in these two sub-paragraphs is common. Sub-paragraphs d eu d define separately, for each party, the capacity to be operated an transat over the territory of the other party. The effect of sub-paragraph (v) is to permit 'escalation' based on fifth freedom traffic, except that originating in-or destined for the territory of the other party. (f) l-dragraph 6 . This paragraph provides for the equal division oi capacity between the operated of the two parties, but provides also for the operation of the whole of the capacity by the United States air lines until India decides to operate to the United States.

The permission to carry traffic specified in sub—paragraphs (a) (iii) and (b) (iii) of paragraph 3 will be judged in the light of the following factors, namely, (i) the air transport needs of the territories concerned judged in reration to public convenience and necessity: _(ii) the adequacy of other air transport services in and between the territories concerned; G. 107&gt;71l(a) Pan American Airways: Trans Continental and Western Air Inc. : /(iii)(iii) the economy of through air service operation, judged in relation 60 the capacity allocated to the specified air services under paragraph 5 of this Annex. In order to maintain equilibrium between the capacity of the specified air services and the traffic originating in or destined for the territories of the two contracting parties for carriage over the specified air routes and to maintain proper relationship between the specified air services and other air services operating on sections of the specified air routes, the frequency and capacity of the air services to be operated shall be determined by the competent air authorities of the two contracting parties, initially and from time to time, in accordance with the terms of this paragraph. (Until otherv/ise agreed by the competent aeronautical authorities, for the purpose of this Annex, the measure of capacity of an air service is the average aggregate pay load capacity operated on the stage in question in a period of one week; and the fre r icy of the air service means the number of aircraft operated over the route in one week). (i) The total capacity of the specified air services operated into and from India between the United States and Karachi may be sufficient to carry the traffic specified in sub- paragraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph 3(a) of this Annex at a load factor of not less tnan 60 /o- or such convenient approximation as may be agreed. In calculating the capacity due regard will be paid to the variation in the pay load of the aircraft doe to the different length ox stages. (ii) The total capacity of the air services operated by Pan American Airways and Trans /Continental and Western Air Inc. respectively East of Karachi may be sufficient to carry the traffic specified in sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph 3(a) of this Annex at a load factor of not less than 60 /q or such convenient approximation as may be agreed. (iii) The total capacity of the specified air services operated into and from United States territory between India and the United States may be sufficient to carry the traffic specified in sub-paragraphs (i^ and (ii) of paragraph 3(^) of this Annex at a load factor of not • less than 60% or such convenient approximation as may be agreed. In calculating the capacity due regard will be paid to the variation in the pay load of the aircraft due to the different length of stages. (iv) The total capacity of the air ser ...ces operated by the air line(s) designated by the Government of India beyond the point of entry from India into United States territory may be sufficient to carry the traffic specified in sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph 3(t0 of this Annex at a load factor of not less than 60% or such convenient approximation as may be agreed. /(v) G. 107711(a)(v) The traffic specified in paragraphs 3(a)(iii) and- 3(b)(iii) of this Annex shall not be taken into account, either initially or sub.ioquently, in calculating the capacity or frequency of the specified air services. (vi) The frequency of the air services may be determined from time to time by the contracting party or designated air line concerned, provided that the competent aeronautical authorities of the other party are satisfied (a) that the aircraft proposed are suitable for operation on the air routes in their territory and (b) that the proposed frequency is reasonably related to the needs of traffic on the route. (vii). In order to meet seasonal or temporary fluctuations in traffic demand the designated air lines may, by agreement between themselves, temporarily increase the frequency and/or capacity of the air services in order to meet the traffic demand. Any such intended increase of capacity or frequency shall be reported, as long in advance as possible, to the competent aeronautical authorities of both parties who may confirm or modify them and determine when the normal service shall be restored. 6 * The capacity determined in accordance with the provisions of the Annex of this agreement shall normally be operated as to one half by the air lines designated by the United States Government and as to one half by the air lines designated by the Government of India. Until the Government of India has designated an air line under this agreement, the whole of the capacity may be operated by the air lines designated by the United States Government in such proportions as may be agreed with the Government of India, but when such Indian air line has been designated, the United States Government shall arrange’with its designated air lines to withdraw correspondingly x \^ome or all of the additional capacity which they have operated under this article, J.n order to maintain the principle set out in paragraph 5 of this Annex. 7 , (a) The tariffs to be changed on the specified air services shall b agreed in the first instance between the\designated air lines in consultation with other air lines operatingxon the route or any section thereof. Any tariffs so agreed will be subject to the approval of the contracting parties. In the event of disagreement; between the airlines, the contracting parties themselves shall endeavour to reach agreement. Should the contracting parties fail to agree, the matter in dispute will be referred to arbitration, as provide for in Article 10 of the Agreement. G» 107711(a) /(b)(b) The tariffs to be agreed in accordance with (a) above shall be 1 ixed at reasonable levels, due regard being paid to all relevant factors, including, economical operation, reasonable profit, differences of &amp; characteristics of service (including standards of speed and accommodation)^ and the tariffs charged by any other operators on the route. Tariffs charged for traffic taken up or put down at points on a route '(other than traffic destined for or embarked in the country v.iiose Government has designated the air line) shall be higher than the corresponding tariffs for similar traffic carried by local or regional services on the corresponding sector of the route.

Mr, H,A.F, Rumbold India Office Mr, G.F. Squire, H*M, Minister, Kabul. Mr, N,J,A, Cheetham Foreign Office Mr. D.M, Cleary India Office Mr. J,P. Ferris India Office Mr. W.W. Burkett Ministry of Civil Aviation A. Proposed I«do-A£ghan Air Service Mr. Squire explained that the Afghan Prime Minister had asked for a detailed, proposal for a joint Indo-Afghan service, and that the Government of India agreed that the discussions should be carried further. The Government of India, however, had ^only-r - oontIv--eftablttdthe Legation to / kJ rd yJ put forward financial and technical details, and he doubted whether it [ uiLotJ was yet necessary to consider the allocation of aircraft. If any scheme io was to be acceptable to the Afghan Government, a large share of the capital i.. &lt; cost of of any losses would have to be borne by the Government of India, although the operational costs might be less considerable than appeared at first sight, as there was every reason to hope that a weekly Peshawar- Kabul Service would carry a considerable number of passengers. Six Frederick Tymms estimated the capital cost of service from Peshawar to Quetta via Kabul and Kandahar at Rs* 5 lakhs, exclusive of ground f installations; a twice weekly service with Beechcraft Expeditors between Peshawar and Kabul as an extension of the existing Calcutta-Peshawar • / ^ ' service would only cost about Rs. 2^ lakhs. ~ ' 2. Mr, Rumbold said that, while the Afghan Government primarily desired a circular service joining their four principal towns, Kabul, Mazar*d-Sharif, Herat, Kandahar, the Government of India ^»iffie,l at an extension of the f cow cJi^L I«lf,A. 0 al Sm a—Peshe.,;ar service to Kabul, and that the^proposed Peshawar- L Kabul-Kandahar-Quetta service was merely a means of helping the Afghans to agree to the Peshawar-Kabul link. It might help to ride the Afghans off their idea ior a circular service, if estimates of the comparative cost of the circular service and of a Eeshaivar^uetta service could be prepared for the Afghan Government, and it oould be .made clear to them at the same time that the former would be for them much the more expensive as the Government of India would not, of course, contribute. The proposals regarding the link service and the share of the oost to be borne by the Afghan Government should be explained to them at the same time, 3. Sir Frederick Tymms said that the Government of India had long determined on extending the Calcutta-Peshawar service to Kabul after the war. .. - Qul?ta 0uld 3180 be read y to consider a joint Indo-Afghan service between and Kandahar. It might not be possible at the outset to achieve a regular service at all seasons, but Mr. Squire said the Afghans would not consider this a serious'drawback, 4. Mr. Squire emphasised that the Afghans world prefer to work with the Americans in accordance with their general policy of avoiding the grant of concessions to their neighbours. It was for this reason that they had signed the Five Freedoms agreement at Chicago, although by the Prime Minister s own confession they did not know to what they had committed themselves, and they-had spontaneously offered the Americans facilities to %oross their territory en route to China. They also thought that the Americans would undertake the necessary construction works in Afghanistan without cost to themselves* jui American route to Kabul would not pay its way as the Government* of India could restrict the extent to which it carried Fifth Freedom traffic to India and indeed could prevent it entering India over the North West Frontier r and it was desirable to make this clear to the Afghans, fhis might not, however, prevent the Americans initiating a service terminating at Kabul* 5* Against Mr* Squire’s suggestion that we might secure American co-operation, it was emphasised that the competition between this country and the TJ.S.A* in the sphere of civil aviation generally was very serious indeed and that the Americans would use for wider purposes any opening we helped them to obtain in Afghanistan* In Afghanistan, however, we had the advantages of our connection with the Afghan Air For*e and Mr, Squire suggested that we might perhaps let them have a few small transport planes for staff officers, to encourage air mindedness, as had been done in Persia* 6. With regard to personnel, under the present proposals the non- Afghan staff at the Kandahar and Kabul airfields need not exceed half a dozen in all and the Government of India were willing to train Afghans to take over these positions eventuallyi 7« A necessary prerequisite of the service was a ground survey of the 'Kabul and Kandahar airfields. The Afghans might not readily agree to someone being sent up from India foir this specific purpose, but the H*A,F, pilot instructor with the Afghan Air Force, or the R,A.F. staff officer, who is understood to be shortly proceeding to Kabul, could easily find opportunities to make the necessary survey* It was agreed that: (i) the matter could usefully be pursued tentatively by H*M, Legation, Kabul, with the Afghan Government, without any attempt being made at this stage to present them with cut and dried plans, (ii) Sir Frederick lymms might have prepared in the ^ivil Aviation Department rough estimates of the comparative costs of the n circular” and ”link” services and of the proportion to be borne by the Government of India in respect of the latter. (ill) the suggestion should be put to the External Affairs Department that the Charge d f Affaires at Kabul be authorised to place these estimates before the Afghan • Government at his discretion, (iv) the Government of India be asked to make arrangements for unofficial ground surveys of the Afghan airfields. B, Afghan refusal of transit rights for U*3.3,1? . Sta linabad-ifo orog Air Service Mr, •iieetham referred to Katodontelegram No. 71 of 17th July, which reported the Afghan refusal, and transmitted a request from the Afghan Government for British advice, Mr. Runbold suggested that it was a suit able opportunity to explain to the Afghan Government that the U^.S.R.,“3- ■ g not being a party to the Two Freedoms Agreement were not entitled to transit rights in Afghanistan ixlijte India, in order thus to emphasise the difference between the Russian and the Indian position* Mr* Burkett said that the request was far from unreasonable in itself* It was agreed that these points might be made to the Afghan Government, it —dng made clear that we regarded the matter as entirely one for the Afghans to settle. Proposed Survey of Air Route from India to Baghdad via Zahidan and Tehran Mr. Rumbold said that the proposal originated with the Government of India, who had asked Air Transport Command (India) to provide a military aircraft for the purpose. Sir Frederick Tymms said that Air Transport Command had expressed their willingness to co-operate as long ago as September, 1944, but it had proved necessary to consult the Air Ministry, who had refused to agree, on the ground that all suitable aircraft were required for first priority work. It was hoped that this objection would not be insuperable as it might be the case that owing to the location of aircraft aut particular times, a second priority job could perhaps be done without prejudice to first priority work. General Mayne has written to the Vice Chief of the Air Staff stressing the urgency of the project, as it must be completed while British military rights in Persia are retained. It was desirable to use a military rather than a civil aircraft, because this reduced both the jieoessity for obtaining Persain consent and the danger of Russian objection as they used nominally military aircraft on their service between Tehran and Meshed. 2. The Foreign Office has now asked Sir Reader Bullard at Tehran for his conments by telegraph, particularly on the question of consulting the Persian Government. If it were a question of obtaining their consent, the reasons for using a military aircraft v/ere of course much diminished, 3. It was agreed that the replies to Gfserai Mayne r s letter and to the Foreign Office telegram to Tehran must be awaited. If an air survey proved iopracticable suggestion of a ground survey of the route might be made to the Government of India, P* Question of Regularising the Position of O.N.A.C. f s Services between India and China It was explained that C.N.A.C. originally obtained the right to fly a fixed number of services between certain airports in Burma and China in 1939 Q^d that there were supplementary agreements in 1 S 42 , giving them rights at Indian airports. These rights are now being greatly exceeded, first in respect of the airfields from which the service was being operated, and secondly in respect of the number of services. Services had now reached the figure of approximately 2 a day (exclusive of military freight services for the U.S. forces in China, some of which were commercial in character) and were producing an average monthly revenue of nearly Rs.9 lakhs. The Government of India were considering whether it would not be advisable to regularise the position by negotiating a new agreement, 2. In the ensuing discussion, it was agreed that it was impossible to curtail traffic during wartime. It would be possible to negotiate a new agreement giving the Chinese such rights as war conditions may from time to time render desirable, subject to the retention by the Government of India of the right to terminate the arrangement at short notice and the repetition of India 1 s right to operate a reciprocal service when she wishes. But this negotiation might cause more trouble than it was^ . - 4 - worth and the existing agreements were terminable in respect of India at 3 months notice* It was agreed that on the whole it would probably be easier to leave undisturbed the present informal arraJSgements. 3* Sir Frederick Tymms said that it was essential that India should obtain reciprocal rights on this very important route after the war. But they had no plans ready at present. They must have rights for a specifically Indian,not merely a British service. Hr. Burkett thought that it would be preferable for the British Commonwealth to negotiate, when the time comes, as a unit with China in matters of civil aviation, so that all Commonwealth parties concerned got what each needed out of the Chinese, 4* It v/as agreed that the question of regularising the C.N.A.C. service should not be raised with the Chinese Government at this stage unless the Government of India particularly pressed the point. #Ext» 2538/45 DRAFT LETTER /r W,C*G.Cribbett # Esq» # Ministry of Civil Aviation, Ariel House, Strand, W«C«2» 1 2 JUL 1945 .

In accordance with the closing words of the Prime Minister at his interview with Mr. Squire, the Government of India have prepared a concrete proposal which, subject to the views of H.M.G-., will be put to the Afghan Government. The proposal comprises a Joint Indi»-Afghan service operating between Quetta, Kandahar and Kabul, and a purely Indian service from Peshawar to Kabul - this as a reasonable concession in return for the expense of the Joint service, which will naturally be largely borne by India. The operations cannot be coraraenced in the immediate future, as the technical details have not yet been fully worked out.

Afghan Government have appointed a committee to consider the report now received from their Minister in Washington on Civil Aviation Conference, and until they have fully understood its implications they are unwilling to commit themselves in any way. But proposal for courier service or even for occasional flights was definitely unacceptable as a first step. Minister for Foreign Affairs however said that Afghan Government look forward to the establishment of a Commercial Air Service between Kabul and India before long and as Afghanistan could not run her own service, single joint service with Afghan participation seemed natural solution. 3. As there can be no question of any such service being organized in Afghanistan except by the Government it would seem best for service to be Governmental under the auspices of the Posts and Air Departments of the two Governments.

S.R.735 7th March, 1945* 1945 L jar Peel &gt; Thank you for your letter of February 24th, your reference EXT. 740/1945^ enclosing a draft telegram to the Government of ThaisTabout their proposed courier service from India to Kabul. The crux of this matter seems to us to be the diversion of aircraft to a service which could scarcely be justified on the grounds of war requirements. You have been corresponding on this subject with Gough. From our experience of the line taken by the Americans about the use of Lease/Lend aircraft for other than strictly war purposes, I should be considerably surprised if they did not create a good deal of trouble over the inauguration of a courier service to Kabul, even if Lease/Lend Beecher aft Expediters were not used on this particular route - and all the more so since the Americans have shown a desire in the past to operate a courier service of their own to Kabul. In these circumstances we entirely agree with the general line taken in your proposed telegram. I suggest, however, that the reference to fill up loads in the first sentence migiht be omitted. We have now decided to acquiesce in the U.S. proposals, subject to certain reservations, but as the service to Kabul would not have the basic justification of a war requirement, I do not think you need introduce the fill up load aspect unless you particularly wish to do so. As to the points raised in the appendix to your letter, it hardly seems necessary to pursue the M legal' position arising R. Peel, Esq. , India Office S.W.l.out of the Chicago documents if it is accepted by all concerned that the Lease/Lend objections to the inauguration of the courier service are conclusive. It would be difficult to make a convincing distinction between a courier service operating ‘ * fairly regularly, and perhaps even carrying non-official passengers on a paying basis, and a scheduled international *** civil air service, and we are inclined to agree with you that if India advanced this argument it might well scare the Afghans before they have formally ratified the Chicago Agreements. I am sorry that you have not yet had copies of the Chicago documents. Unfortunately they are still in very short supply. The Stationery Office are, however, printing additional copies and I hope that you will get sane very shortly. Yours sincerely,FOREIGN OFFICE S • W • 1 • 6thi March, 1945. (W 2917/2^91/802) Dear Peel, Thank you lor your letter Ext.740/1545 ox* February 24th addressed to Hayter, about the proposed air courier service between India and Afghanistan. 2. Subject to Gribbett’s views, we concur generally in the terms of the draft telegram to the Government of India. Yours sincerely Cajuah (N.J.A. Gheetham) R.T. Peel, Esq.., G.B.E India Office.The Americans have recently agreed to the R.A.P. in India making over to Indian Civil Air Lines twelve lease/lend Beechcraft Expeditor Aircraft for operation as transports on behalf of the R.A*P* The Government of India telegram of the 11th February (Ext«669) below, suggests that a lease/lend Beechcraft Expeditor (to be made over by the R*A*F*) should be operated by Indian National Airways as a diplomatic courier plane between Delhi and our Legation at Kabul. No doubt this aircraft would be one of the twelve alluded to above. Failing our approval to the use of a lease/lend Beechcraft Expeditor for this purpose the Government of India suggest in paragraph 6 of their telegram that a Beechcraft Expeditor already in use by I.N.A. (and therefore a non lease/lend aircraft) might be used for the purpose, and replaced by a new aircraft (no doubt lease/lend) from the R.A.F. The E. &amp; 0. Department have pointed out that the twelve lease/lend Beechcraft Expeditors referred to above are being made over to Indian Civil Air Lines* on the understanding that they are operated under the control of the R.A.F. and that they will be used for services on internal air routes in India and Ceylon essential to India*s war effort, and nominated by the Air Commander-in-Chief. The proposed courier service between Delhi and Kabul is obviously not included within this definition. Consequently, a fresh approach would have to be made to the Americans before any of the aircraft concerned could be diverted to that service, and before the Americans would agree it would be necessary to satisfy them that the proposed service is connected with India’s war effort. This is so obviously not the case that it seems best not to put the suggestion to the Americans at all rather than run the almost certain risk of being turned down. As for the alternative proposal in paragraph 6, the E. &amp; 0. Department confirm that there are a few old Expeditors now used by I.N.A. which are not lease/lend. Although the restrictions referred to in the preceding paragraph do not apply to these aircraft, the E. &amp; 0. Department consider, and I think that we may agree, that it would be impolitic to use any of these old aircraft for the service, and to replace it by a lease/lend aircraft, for the Americans would doubtless draw the obvious inference that the opening up of the service is the direct result of their having agreed to the transfer of the twelve new Beechcraft Expeditors to I.N.A. and Tatas. The same objections apply to the use of any British Civil Transport Aircraft that may be in operation in India. We know that I.N.A. have a number of old British aeroplanes, but we do not know whether they are suitable for this particular service, but even if they are it would appear to be better tactics to wait a few months before opening up the proposed courier service. In the interval it is hoped that our civil aviation relations with America will have developed sufficiently to make it less possible for the Americans to raise any objections to the project, and by that time it is possible also that more suitable British aircraft will become available for use (e.g. Dominies or possibly Warwicks which are already used by the R.A.F. in India ) thus incidentally enhancing the prestige value of the service. The objections to opening up the courier service at the present stage are strengthened by Mr. Squire’s telegram of the 15th February at Ext.740 below, in which he explains that it is unlikely that the Afghans would wish to come to a decision on such a proposal just yet. His suggestion that for the present we should limit ourselves to a n informal approach to the Afghans with the object rather of testing their reactions to our plans than seeking their concurrence to a specific proposal seems sound. It is accordingly proposed,subject to the views of the Foreign Office, Air Ministry, and Department of Civil Aviation, to reply to the Government of India in the terms of the draft telegram below, pointing out the objections to their proposal and suggesting that the project should be postponed for a few months. It is also proposed to telegraph Mr. Squire (repeating to India) authorising him, subject to the views of the Government of Ihdia, to make an informal approach to the Afghan Government on the lines suggested by him.s i n Qeth e above Minute was written, the Government of India ^^complicated the issue by their telegram 1727 dated 21st February (Ext.831/45), in which they suggest that Mr.Squire should take advantage of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (which Afghanistan and India have both signed) to press for early agreement to the proposed courier service. The objections to this ' proposal are (1) that we are not on safe ground in claiming that the courier service is of a kind that would be covered by the Convention, and (2) that in any case to cite the Convention in this connection might well scare the Afghans from ratifying it. A draft telegram to the Government of India on the lines of the above Minute ( and covering the point about the Convention's accordingly submitted; it has received the concurrence of all the departments interested (including the Foreign Office). A draft telegram to H.M. Minister, Kabul, is also submitted, instructing him to act, subject to any further views which the Government of India may desire to offer, on the line^indicated in para. 4 of the telegram to India.

Dear Peel, Thank you for your letter of the 24th February about the Government of India’s proposal to open up an air courier service from Delhi to Kabul. I entirely agree with the line you are taking in your draft reply insofar as the use of R.A.F, and Lend Lease aircraft are concerned. You will no doubt be consulting us again if and when you propose to re-open the establishment of the courier service so that we may, at that stage, consider what, if anything, can be done about the supply of British aircraft.

Apart from one or two formal alterations I doubt whether it really necessitates any material modification of the draft. You are in a better position this Department to judge‘s this however, and we shall be grateful for your views. “A- I r. Cleary ■ Unfortunately neither the Foreign Office nor the Air Ministry have yet, despite constant reminders, let us have even one copy of the Agreements signed at Chicago. It is therefore rather difficult to express a view as to the validity of the Government of India* s argument that if the Afghans ratified the Convention, we would acquire a treaty right to operate a courierservice to Kabul, on the grounds that it is not a regular scheduled civil air transport service. But prima facie I am rather doubtful whether the Government of Indian contention is really well founded and we had better get the advice of the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office on it. But even if it is right, it would surely be a mistake to bring so pointedly to the notice of the Afghans at this stage what would be the result of their ratifying the Convention. I can think of no surer v.ay of securing that they refrain from ratifying it. I suggest that you include some thing on the following lines in your letter to Mr. Cribbett. n \\e are a little handicapped in considering the G-oveminent of India’s telegra;. N 0.1727 of 21st February by the fact that we have not yet got even one copy of the documents signed at Chicago. Prima facie the Government of India’s suggestion that if the Afghans ratified the Chicago /Conventionit 15^ £■«...V—; Convention we would be entitled to run courier services of the sort suggested to Kabul, on the score that it is not a regular scheduled air transport service, seems to us of doubtful validity. We would much welcome your comments on ^t and our draft telegram will need expansio n to cover the point. But even Tf&gt;u is well founded we doubt the wisdom of drawing so pointedly to the notice of the Afghans at this stage the legal effects of the ratification by them of the Convention, as $ie reaction of the Afghans wraL probably be to refrain from ratification, M A copy of the letter to Mr, Cribbett might then also be sent to the Foreign Office and the draft to Mr. Hayter, expanded to include a sentence asking for his comments on the point also. VJLO'- ri- V • « jr .^4 XT o. ' 2 ViMr. Cleary There is a little muddle-headedness at Delhi about the effect of the idea of allowing existing military services to carry non-essential paying passengers on their present proposal and I would therefore prefer to see the point covered in our draft. Perhaps we might replace the marginal insertion in paragraph 2 by the following:- ’’The proposal to permit carriage of non-essential paying passengers for fill-up purposes on existing military services does not of course bear on proposal to start an additional service which could not be justified as essential for war purposes”. A 4r I think that your proposed addition to the draft might also he more precise. I suggest the following '5. Your telegram No.1727 of 21st February. It is doubtful whether convincing distinction could be drawn between scheduled international civil air service and a courier service operating fairly regularly particularly if latter carried non-official paying passengers.

The Government of India have now decided in favour of a courier air service to Kabul, and are anxious that H.M. Minister should be authorised to open negotiations with the Afghan Govemwent as soon as possible, since it would for technical reasons be preferable to start the service in March. From a strictly political aspect, the proposal seems, desirable, and mai\y of the difficulties fo^hadowed in the Government of India* s telegram might best be left to Mr. Squire to settle with the Afghans on the spot. I should be grateful for your views, particularly on the suggestion in para. 4 of the telegram affa/t making available any unused space in the service for non-official fare-paying passengers, and the lease-lend difficulties mentioned in para. 7» With regard to the fomer xx&gt;int, I am inclined to share the fear expressed by the Government cf India that the Afghans would not countenance the proposal in its present form.f*rr\ External Secretary^ I am afraid that it vri.ll not be possible to use Lend/Lease ixiachires or machines of types obtained on Lease/Lend without prior consultation with the Americans. There is little chance of their agreeinc unless it can be shown - which I doubo - that the proposed Service is in aid of the war effort, particularly as in the present case the -Service is, i gather really contemplated forwnrpstige reasons and in order to forestall an American Service, mncficeda consent; in a case of triis ^rind »,culd be in ah^/' event s£* remote as to irudce it scarcely desirable to try: the' inclusionjof -fill-up passengers would make the cnances cf consent even though it would not necessarily of itself turn the scale against us. There are, however, special reasons which seem to put the Gov eminent of mdia's proposal ■wholly out of court and indeed, I have this morning received the attached letter from the Air Ministry (about which I have spoken to Ur. Gough). #L • A few months ago we received a pitixul telegram xiom the Government of India saying that Tatas and I.IAA. could scarcely carry on their internal services conducted almost entirely in aid of the war effort, unless 12 Dakotas could be ; oaae available to them. After a considerable struggle with the Air .inis.ry A.M.S.O. hi-iiself was j^suaded to ask the U.S. Gen^rAI eriles bo give permission tghiny ins ructing the Air Comiiander-in- Chief, S.S.A.C., to make the Dakotas available on loan to Government of India vrho^rr^igef for them to be operatea by tne two Companies on services nominated by the Air G.-in.c.^n certain fairly stringent conditions regarding finance ana fill up passengers. In the event Expediters have, with /umerican permission, been for the time being substituted for Dakotas, xt would seem, however, out of the cueition after the A,u,rleans agi’eed only a week or two ago to the use of Expeditors on internal services on the understanding that they are essential1 to Indian war effort and that the R.A.P. retain full conti’Ol over t.ieir use blandly to make these planes or others of the same type available^ to I.K.A. for such a service. he latter £ *..t laoi i ?.tter for- thia &gt; T Te re a^;ain. hovre. er. t he ^ is that [e Service can be Ax? oi'.y lo submit the proposal to the London Munitions .Lssi.-pj .ent Board -..her'^ the Aiericans will almost certainly object.

It is yuite likely that these difficulties about the conversion to civil use of British military types, as also the manufacture of pre-war British civil types will largely disappear v/hen the German war ends. 4.That, however, will be too late to start the Service f as is proposed next month. It would seem, therefore, that the only alternative to♦postponement is for the authorities in India to get hold of some sufficiently serviceable British old civil types. Until recently at least, the I.K.A. fleet included 3 DH.89 , s. It might possibly be worth enquiring whether they would be technically suitable and are in a fit condition for this Service, S'.

AIR MINISTRY, ADASTRAL HOUSE, KFNGSWAY, W.C.2. 12fth February, 1945 • Dear Morley, I am sorry to trouble you with yet another point about the arrangements for the loan of 12 R.A.F. Beachoraft B^peditor a'~‘^?raft to the Government of India for operation by TATA and INA. I have just seen a copy of 'telegram from the Government of India, External Affairs Department No. 1438 of February 11th which says that INA are now prepared to operate a courier service fran Delhi to Kabul, using Beachcraft E^qpeditor aircraft to be made available by the R.A.F.; and that the Government of India hope to be able to carry Afghan official passengers and mail and possibly non-official passengers on paying basis. Y/hen Sir Frederick Tymms and Sir Gurunath Bowoor were in London in December, we discussed the arrangements which would be made to permit the use of lend/lease aircraft by the 2 companies and as a result, a letter was preparedywhich Rumoold saw and agreed in drafts from Air Chief Marshal Courtney to Lt/General Giles, the American Chief of Air Staff. This letter contains the following passage M The services to be operated would be internal air routes in India and Ceylon, essential to India*s war effort and nominated by the Air Commander-in-Chief , *. I hope you will bear this in mind in considering the present proposal to operate a service which comes outside the bounds of India and Ceylon. It is true that paragraph 6 of the telegram points out that the Beachcraft was obtained on lease/Lend^but for some reason, which I do not quite follow, the same paragraph goes on to say that the f Government of India understands that the embargo on use for any but war ■ purposes has been or is about to be raised. Although Giles has said that Ihe agrees to the arrangement as proposed in Air Chief Marshal Courtney* s letter, I do not think we would be justified in interpreting this as authority ^trlT^use of a lend/lease aircraft for services coming outside • India. I hope, therefore, that you will keep in touch ■'with us in dealing with this telegram. Yours sincerely, A.F. Morley Esq., India Office, £ 4 Central Buildings, Matthew Parker Street, V/estminster, S.W. !•I attach a copy of the letter which was sent by Air Chief Marshal Sir C. Courtney to General Giles of the U. S.A. A.F. It was drafted in concert with me. It has now been agreed with the concurrence of the Aniericans to hand over to the Indian civil airlines 12 Beechcraft Expeditors on the same basis as was proposed for the Dakotas, as an interim iueasure until Dakotas can be oade available. This makes it quite impossible without the concurrence of the Americans to use the Expeditors on a service to Kabul. This service is so obviously unconnected with India's war effort that it seems to me quite impossible ;$0 approach the Americans in the matter at the mcmient. « Moreover I would not pursue at this juncture the question of opening the service with old Expeditors not obtained on Lend-Lease or with British type aircraft. This would carry too obviously the implication that the opening of the service has been the direct result of the new Expeditors being handed over to the Indian civil airlines. It is much better to vait a few months and then set up the service, preferably with British type aircraft, v*hen the risk of a row with the Americans will be much less. In the interval a good many developments in our civil aviation relations with the Americans are likely^ which would make action vis-a-vis the Afghans a good deal less awkward. Incidentally I think that we should resist any tendency on the part of the Air Ministry at this time to refer to the London Munitions Assignment Board /anyany proposal to use British type aircraft for this service. It is evident from paragraph 3 of Mr. Morley's note that the Air Ministry are a good deal out of date in their interpretation of our White Paper obligations. * 15 . 2 . 45 . ‘4 s ^ ^6th January, 1945 Dear General tiiles, I asked your advice during our conversation on Friday about an arrangement we are considering for making use of the in India. These companies are reduced, at present, to a mere handful of old aircraft but they have personnal and facilities capable of handling very much more. The Air Conaoander-in-Chief, South East Asia Command has therefore proposed that he should make use of the under-employed personnel and facilities of these companies, thus releasing R.A.F. manpower for other duties. He woiiH like to use the companies as his agents to operate R.A.F. Dakotas already allotted or to be allotted to A.C. S.E. A. The services to be operated would be internal air routes in India and Ceylon essential to India's war effort and nominated by the Air Ccmimander-in-Chief. The aircraft would remain vested in the R.A. F. , and under the control of the Air Coramander-in- Chief. Passenger and freight space would be allotted by as at present an Air Priorities Board The only exception to this would be that if a seat in one of these aircraft falls vacant, or the priority traffic is less than the aircraft's capacity, non-priority passengers would be allowed! on board for fill-up purposes. Fares would be charged for passengers not travelling on behalf of the Government but the numbers of non-priority and f are-paying passengers would be a negligible proportion of the whole. Arrangements will be made so that no profit will accrue to the companies by reason of the charging of fares, which would either be surrendered by the companies or else set off against operating costs. It is the essence of the proposed arrangement that the companies would be operating R.A. F. aircraft on behalf of the R.A.F. As you will see this proposal is very similar to the arrange- personnel and facilities of two small civil air line conpanies ment we already have with B. 0. A.C. , and my own view is that no /questionquestion of re-assignment of the aircraft need arise. Neverthe less, as I explained to you on Friday, I should not like you to feel that we are allowing civil companies to operate Lease Lend aircraft without your knowledge a.nd without first ascertaining that you have no objection. we can, as you see, assure you that these Dakotas, which were allocated to us for essential military transport services, will continue to be used for that purpose but will be operated by civil personnel, the aircraft themselves remaining always within the control of the R.A.F. There is no question of sale or lease of Lend Lease aircraft to civil companies nor is there any question of civil aircraft being put in a position to make profits out of Lend Lease aircraft. The number of aircraft we have in mind is about 12. You very kindly undertook to confirm that there was no objection to this arrangement on your return to Washington, and this letter will serve as an aide-memoire. Yours sincerely, (Sgd) C. L. COURTNEY. . Major General Burney F.iLGiles, U. S. Arijy Air Force, Claridges Hotel, Brook Stree, W. 1.There are a number of small points on which the draft is based on a misreading of the E.&amp; 0. Departments minutes.®* cocxclx^, , I also urge that the last sentence of the draft requires considerable amendment. I would see no objection to Mr. Squire telling the Afghan Government informally of what we would like to do later on when the demar*is on our aircraft resources for war purposes are less pressing. But it would be most undesirable for him to suggest that we have any immediate objectives in mind, whatever he says is likely to reach the ears of the United States Legation sooner or later and if he implies to the Afghans that we are ready to start a service of any sort now, the Americans would deduce that we have been enabled to do this only by the arrangements to which they have consented regarding vnrigut of this sentence to cover this point.t«riM - ^.n.. ^ —— DRAj 1 T LETT; IE G*S*I n « Gough * so*, Air Ministry.

Although there is no possibility I of oi 3 ening up such a courier service through the agency of any existing civil organisation, they have asked K.L.R. to ~~rfcag«i the Afghan Governn.ent the possibility of using air service planes and personnel (who would probably have to be disguised as civilians}. I have consulted L-r.Birkett of the Civil Aviation Department of the Air llin is try on this proposal and he has told me over the telephone that there is no objection to it from their point of view. Bilateral negotiations between limitrophe powers would not in his opinion prejudice in advance any general /agreement f \I agreement that we may wish to secure on post-war civil aviation. Nor could the Americans cavil at the use of air service personnel in civilian dress, for they themselves have employed this device to secure an air service to Stockholm. I do not think that there is any objection, therefore, to the Government of India exploring their proposal, ncr to the postponement of a reply to Ilr.Engert until they have had an opportunity of making up their minds.

On reading the draft, I felt that H.M. Minister at Kabul should be told a little more about the policy background against which he was being asked to object to the establishment of an American service, and I took the opportunity of a telephone conversation with Rumbold this morning on another matter, to mention the point to him. He suggested that a sentence should be added to the ^ draft telegram asking the Government of India to repeat to H.M. Minister, Kabul, all recent telegrams dealing with develop ments in the international sphere, leading up to the American decision to convene an International Conference in the U.S.A. on 1st November. This suggestion would, of course, completely meet the point I have in mind. ° n ' ^ R.T. Peel, Esq., India Office, , t, Whitehall, S.W.1 — ■ - i ML \ ...

IN ficf4 I fear I have been responsible for diverting the noting on this case to the important question of future commercial air developments on the Kabul route. This question needs early consideration, but for the ncmeht/with Mr.Engert's tentative suggestion of an American diplomatic air service from India to Kabul. Mr. Squire’s letter was dated 10th August and it may well be that Sir Olaf Caroe will already have answered it and, we may hope, discouraged the idea. But I think it would be as well if we telegraphed our views on the proposal on the lines suggested at ‘A* in Mr.Rumbold’s note. I put up a draft to the Government of India in which the concurrence of the Foreign Office and Air Ministry will be necessary. Mr.Rumbold has seen and concurs.

NOTES FOR REGISTRY. REGISTER NO. EXT. 375VU* This proposal is hardly past the embryonic stage, since the American Minister has most properly coimrunicated it to Mr. Squire from the outset; but, in view of past history, it obviously demands serious consideration. *&gt; N -. ^ The Afghans have hitherto succeeded rather well in playing off the Russians, the Germans and the British against one another in the matter of air concessions; but it is possible that they may consider the Americans rather differently, though Mr. Squire is confident of the contrary. At present only the Russians have a service running to Kabul; this has been operated for many years, regular in fact though not in name, but it remains strictly limited to Diplomatic uses - a point to be noted in view of Mr. Squire*s belief that an American Diplomatic Air Service would be the thin end of the wedge for couanercial interests. Our attitulfe towards the operation of foreign air routes in Afghanistan was in the past largely determined by our desire not to afford the Afghans any excuse for admitting Lufthansa. One reason for this was (10308) VTt.l3B71/P.159 1,000 5/39 A.* E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 (10854) Wt.l8826/P.221/2 3,000 (2 sorts) 6/39 /purelypurely political, and needs no explanation; the other ■was our fear that a Berlin-Kabul- Bangkok air route would have a distinct advantage in time and possibly in cost over the Imperial Airways route to the Far East. These points, together with the advantages which would accrue to us from the establishment of a British air service - presumably essential should the American proposal succeed - are set out in Minutes at PZ 1046/41. 7-p. (*«*'*• 29/8/44. Presumably the whole question of world air routes based on strategic and commercial considerations will be a matter for agreement between the Allied Nations after the war, and it seems probable that there will be a good many new routes opened up. The Afghan Government cannot expect, and may not wish to remain cut off from air routes indefinitely, and will doubtless be drawn into the network eventually. In the meantime, however, it seems, according to Mr. Squire, that the Afghans are unlikely at the present time to entertain the idea of the Americans running an air service to Kabul. Sir Kerr Frazer-Tytler also stated in his telegram No.125 of 23 rd April, 1941, that his impression was that the Prime Minister would not if he could help it allow any services, other than f*- Russian, to operate in Afghanistan during the war. This, of course, was in 1941, and things have a very different complexion now. In fact, it seems to me not unlikely that the Afghans, who are inclined to look on America as their fairy godmother, might welcome the idea and see in it possibilities of trade development. It is unfortunate that Mr. Engert has raised the matter now, for if an air service is to be run from India it should properly be run by the British ; from every point of view. The Americans might argue that they run a China-India service, but China has been very much the concern of America, whereas Afghanistan has always been the Government of India’s special interest. We shall have to get the Government of India’s views on this, and I think that it would be worthwhile sending a telegram to ask for them. fcxckc *hP. ^^ ^ too* oU^\cU}U.

The Americans ought not to be given any encouragesnent to run such a service, which would certainly be the thin end of the wedge, and I do not feel at all certain that the Afghans would refuse an application from them. we ourselves got busy again over an air service with Afghanistan, It clearly lias got to come in the near future, and the sooner we establish our position the better. The Afghan Goverment is very forthcoming with us at the moment and it might be a good opportunity to get their consent to a service with India. But can the aircraft be made available and would it be contraiy to our understandings with the Americans if we started a service fi'om India? If we discourage Mr, Engert, as I think we should, it is for consideration what will be the best grounds for doing I have been feeling for some time that it is high time (Sd) R.T.Peel. 31st August, 19 Vh&gt;1. On the cammercial side my recollections are that the Americans desire a West-East route, passing through India and linking with Pan American airways at Hongkong or Shanghai* B.O.A*C. route branched South at Rangoon and K« L.M. at Baijgkok. I have always thought - and indeed there are papers on the subject - that B.O.A.C. wished to continue their route from Rangoon to Hongkong* Facilities for landing in Afghanistan would no doubt appeal to the Americans, since from there they could either pass via India to China and the Eastern littoral or could develop this route to the Northwards via Sinkiang and Lanchowpu, which was projected by Lufthansa* The use of Afghanistan would enable the long range land based American aircraft to cut out Iraq and the Persian Gulf - and possibly India - and give them a very useful stepping stone on the commercial side* I think from this aspect any foothold in Afghanistan would be undesirable* 2. On the political side, and having regard to possible future Russian aims, I think Afghanistan should be induced to rely more on us than on a distant U.S.A. Much, however, may depend on future plans for world security and on developments of the theme of Regional security. This, however, should not I think be allowed to compromise the general, policy, namely that we should - although we may have to be very much more forthcoming - draw Afghanistan closer to us, and in particular to India* From this aspect, also, I think we should view an American air footing in Afghanistan, before we ourselves have such a footing, with apprehension. 3* On the defence side I can see no objections whatever to a regular service between India and Kabul. This service would link up, in India, with any post-war airlines, whether British, American, French or Dutch. At one time there was some objection to the air route - Delhi, Lahore, Peshawar, Kabul - passing over the Khyber. There was a proposal to route it from Lahore, and thence South of Kohat and up the Kurram, reaching Kabul via the Shutar garden. This had the disadvantage of cutting out direct facilities for passengers to and from Rawalpindi and Peshawar, where adequate passenger and freight facilities were required. I cannot see, however, thatunder present conditions our defences on the Khyber are of such great importance, Uty own view, for many years, has been in favour of a regular service between India and Kabul - even if it had to be subsidized. There is something also to be said for a service to Kandahar, linking with at Jacobabad, The chief obstacle has, I believe, always been Hashim Khan and his ”suspicions”. If, however, the Afghans could be got to agree, I think I.N.iL could make aircraft available, even if they had to reduce to some extent on other routes. Even a weekly service, started with small machines, would put us in a very strong position and would attract passenger and freight carrying which could be developed later when further aircraft become available. A service once started inculcates a habit and, moreover, possession is nine tenths of the law. If this is deemed a favourable opportunity - and these in Afghan circles are fleeting - I think we should be well advised to get ahead with it. But our proposals must be capable of fulfilment the moment the all clear is given. It is no use getting a concession and then being unable to take immediate advantage of it. (Intld.) G-.N.M. 4th September, 1944.The tendency of American policy in civil aviation has recently been zo break away front xhe line taken at the London talks tliis summer* Mr* Berle had then agreed that the basis for an international conference should be the paper (known as the Balfour Paper) wliich was accepted • at the Empire Conference a year ago. The Americans now stress the need for expanding civil aviation without waiting for the end of hostilities by a series of bilateral agreements. Such a proposal was put to the Indian Delegation which was in Washington in the second lialf of August and, although we have not received an account of those talks, it is understood tliat the delegation replied that such a bilateral agreement might restrict the discussions for an international agreement and tliat in any case they had not been briefed to deal with the matter in tliat way. H.M.G. are now trying to persuade the Americans to go back to an early international conference and are being well supported by Canada Indeed all the Dominions are disposed to cold shoulder the new American approach. Before Mr. Berle launched his new proposal, the American C.A.B. (Civil Aeronautics Board) had produced a list of routes recommended for adoption by the U.S.A. These included among many others:- New York - Eire .... Cairo - Basrah - Karachi - Calcutta and also - New York ••.. Oslo .... Moscow - Tehran - Basrah The T.W.A. (Trans-continental &amp; Western Airlines) in its application to the C.A.B., had mentioned Baglidad, Teliran, Kabul, Karaclii and New Delhi among other places, but our report does not give the details of the routes.The Government of India, in response xo an enquiry 1 * 1*0111 here, liad proposed a provisional list of air rouxes as B her ulximate aim during xhe post war period”.

As Mr. Wood states the Americans plan a service from New York via Oslo and Moscow to Teheran and Basra* \t would In these circumstances I think that Mr. Squire should be instructed to tell Mr. Engert that we certainly hope for an Indian air service to Kabul after the war, but that in present circum stances we do not think it is justifiable to divert any part of the aircraft resources of the United Nations to a purpose of this sort which obviously would not further the war effort. We would in particular see objection to the establishment of an American service between India and Kabul even for the limited purpose suggested in advance of an international conference on post war civil transport generally.

From the correspondence which seems to have come to an end with Peel*a Secret letter to Metcalfe No*P«Z«94/39 of 24th March 1939 it does not look commercial service, presumably because we felt that it was not worthwhile as well as difficult to arrange.

I hardly imagine that we should be ready to encourage an American corrmercial service to Kabul and the institution of a diplo matic courier service might possibly be the thin end of the wedge. On the other hand it would not be at all a bad thing if a start were made with opening up this country to foreign air travel and in any case T see no reason for discouraging Engert as I have not the least doubt that the Afghans would not for a moment entertain the idea of the /mericans running a diplomatic, much less a commercial, service to Kabul at the present time.

I think that the Afghan Government will welcome any opportunity of developing their means of communication with the outside world (Cf. their desire for a telegraph and telephone agreement with us: I believe they have one with Germany). They will doubtless be eager to have both a German and a British airline and they are likely to resent it if we try to prevent their having either the one or the other. I think it can be assumed that, if the British line is instituted, there will have to be a German line also. If there is a German line, it will certainly be contrary to our interests (otherwise the Germans would hardly bother about it). The only chance of preventing the institution of the German line lies in foregoing the advantages of the British line. (Signed) A.V. Goverley-Price. 4/3. I do not at all like the idea of our remaining inactive about this proposed new German air service to Afghanistan, jlf any action by us would prevent it from starting. '“Eut I am not at all sure that we should be able to induce the Afghans to agree to refuse permission to the German air line. Even if we told the Afghans that we would naturally view the matter with the gravest concern, I wonder if that would be sufficient to put a stop to the project.

This is almost entirely a political question, but on general grounds I should have thought it bad policy to forego the advantages of a British Air Service to Afghanistan on the chance that the Afghans might then refuse to allow Lufthansa to come in. If we were to renounce our service to Lisbon on the off chance that the P ortugu ese would then ask the Germans to discontinue their service, I should think the Portuguese would just laugh at us.

Gp.685 Minute Paper. Department. Please see the previous submission at p.Z.306 and Sir Kerr Praser-Tytler*s telegram No. 50 of the 19th February, P.Z.997, reporting German activities which suggest the re-opening of the Lufthansa air service to Kabul in the spring. In their telegram of the 23rd February the Government of India advocate# an immediate approach to the Afghan Government for permission to start a regular weekly service between Kabul and Lahore on a reciprocal basis. Such a service will have various advantages, e.g; (1) for mail carrying, for visits of the Minister to Delhi and for a possible forced evacuation from Kabul; (2) as valuable propaganda in tribal territory; (3) from the Afghan point of view as giving rapid access to a port for Afghan commercial interests Financially the moment is opportune as the service can be fitted in as an extension of other Indian National Airways commercial services to Karachi and Calcutta from Lahore, and will only cost 50,000 rupees per annum as opposed to the old estimate of 4 lakhs. The Government of India see no reason to be deterred by fear that a regularisation of the Russian service may be a result of our instituting a service (in fact the Russian service is already ^egulai^but it is only a courier service and does not carry passengers or goods.) As regards the Germans they do not consider that they will be influenced by our action or inaction in this field. This, of course, is fairly obvious and the Government of India have missed the real point. The real crux of the matter is not the risk of provoking Germany into taking action but of diminishing our chance of inducing the Afghans to withstand German pressure for the re-establishment of their service. What we should of course like best would be for the Afghans to agree to an Indian service and to refuse to have the German service restarted. This however is a solution which seems hardly likely to be realised in present circumstances. That being so, I am still of opinion that the objections to a German service are so serious that it would be greatly preferable to give up the idea of an Indian service if by so doing we can persuade the Afghans to refuse to allow a German service. If however it is clear that a German service is now inevitable then we should certainly lose no time in demanding similar facilities for ourselves. A draft telegram to Kabul is submitted, instructing Sir Kerr Fraser-Tytler to raise the matter with the Afghan Prime Minister, but not to make any application for a British service at this stage unless it becomes clear that the Afghans are already committed to a German service or would not resist a demand for such a service if made.Draft Paper. b vt POLITICAL (3XTSRNAL) DRAFT 1 FELEGRAM t.

Lan ) r &gt;f ;o id is a &gt;f view would be to obtain the Afghan Government^ agreement to our service while persuading them to refuse a similar request from the Germans. Assuming, as appears probable, that this solution is unrealisable in present/* present circumstances, I still feel that the re-establishment of the German service would be so dangerous and so injurious to our prestige that I should prefer to abandon the idea of a service with Lahore if ^-^that were the only way of preventing the German service. It may, however, be, as would appear to be indicated by the information in Katodon 50, that the re-starting of the German service in the Spring is now inevitable. If that is the position, there will be every advantage in making an early application for permission for a British service and, if possible, in getting our application in first. &amp; Unless therefore you see objections please approach the Afghan Prime Minister and endeavour to ascertain whether and with what degree of firmness he would withstand a German demand for an air service if made. If the reply on this point seems quite satisfactory, it would seem best not to ask for a British service. If however it is clear from the Prime Minister’s answer that the Germans have received or undoubtedly will receive permission to re-start their service, you should at once tr take up with him a request for his agreement to our starting a regular weekly service with Lahore on the lines of paragraph 6 of the Government of India’s telegram of the 23rd February. The last sentence of paragraph 2 of the/the Government of India T s telegram provides an argument which should be helpful towards persuading the Afghan Government of the value to themselves of the proposed service. 4. irivwi if the Prime Minister’s answer is satisfactory it might be worth while to try to discover whether he would be prepared still to resist the German demand even if he had agreed to a British service. You should then report his reactions to this question, together with your view as to the extent to which we can rely on any assurance that he may give. Question of making a request for a British service can then be considered in light of your report.INDEXED Copies Circulate d. •;. i A'S.^ e .

Y/e have considered the obvious objections, and regard them as of less vital importance than benefits to be derived from establishing ourselves in sphere of civil aviation in Afghanistan. Obviously any approach we may be able to make to Afghans on this question must be prejudiced if they come shortly after an objection to the re-establishment of Lufthansa. We feel., too, that Afghans may react unfavourabl to such objection and even if they do not they would probably find it difficult to resist German pressure for the re-establishment of the . service/ umservice which per .se dees not connote hostile ox- subversive activity. • o.

B Z.197/41. XXX Cypher telegram from Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to H.M. Minister, Kabul dated 18th January 1941. (No.of words 290). IMMEDIATE . Katodon No.18 of 14th January and No.10 of 8th January. I agree that developments mentioned in Government of India’s telegram No.121/14 of 10th January do not necessarily indicate drift on part of Afghan Government towards Axis camp. On the other hand, H.M.G. continue to view with apprehension activities of German agents in Afghanistan and elsewhere in Middle East (see in this connection report by Hackin enclosed in Peel’s most secret letter of 14th December). If you see no objection I shall be glad if you will take early opportunity of speaking yet again to Afghan Government on this subject. You should remind them of their previous assurances regarding effective surveillance over Germans and other mischief-makers (see. for example, paragraph 3 of Katodon 144 of 11th November 1939) and emphasise once more that it is just as much in their interests as in those of H.M.G. that check should be kept on subversive activities of Germans (cf. paragraph 3 of Katodon 121 of 31st May and paragraph 4 of Katodon 126 of 4th June 1940) . 2. If Afghan Government should take with you line mentioned in paragraph 2 of Katodon 10 of 8th January, this might provide opening for representing to them that H.M.G. and Government of India in return for their own ready co-operation with the Afghan Government expect adequate co-operation from the latter in imposing stricter control on Germans and Italians and restricting their influence. Fact that Afghan Government may be taking stock of their position seems to make time opportune for such representations. In this connection you might, if you think advisable, also refer to the substantial help which we have offered in the form of credits and assistance in disposing of Afghan cotton and wool. If you consider it , expedient you might also find opportunity in this connection to M mention question of restriction of Legation news bulletins and recent reports that Germans may be planning to re-establish Lufthansa Air Service to Kabul. Grant by Afghan Government of facilities for German air service during present war would .'1 naturally be viewed with gravest concern by H.M.G. It would in addition provide easiest possible means for return to Afghanistan of Shami Pir Ghulam Siddiq or other pro-Amanullah agitators whenever it happened to suit Axis powers to pursue their intrigues with enemies of present regime in Afghanistan. 3.

Minutes. Query. concur in draft letter (Sgd.) A.S. HALPORB. 17th March. I fear we must, since the financial objec tion is overruled. With all due respect, however, I venture to point out that (A) of Mr. Peel's minute is not in accordance with the Foreign Office view on a primarily Anglo-German aspect of the matter. As pointed out in Mr. Collier's minute of January 21st in this paper, it would not in fact be ’’difficult to refuse' a German request for permission to prolong their service from Kabul to India: we would have reasonable grounds for a refusal, and any German resentment incurred thereby would doubtless be vented on His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom - quite apart from the fact that the Government of India, as such, have little to gain or lose by being forthcoming or un-forthcoming to Germany. As regards the first objection mentioned in (A), I would also point out that the present German and Soviet services are regular in all but name, so that the Afghans would surely never dare to withhold permission for them save in conditions in which t .ey would equally dare to cancel their previous authorisation of a regular |'irregularity” of such services seems, therefore, immaterial both as regards the Russians and service. The theoretical 'regularity' or Germans on the one hand, and ourselves on the other/Minutes. other. Moreover if, after the establishment of their Trans-Indien route, the Germans found it convenient to drop the Kabul service, they would not, I imagine, be deterred or prevented from doing so by the fact - if it were a fact - that that service had become 'regular', since they have too much foresight to tie themselves up far y. ahead in the existing transitional conditions: ^ ‘ either they would conclude a short -term 'regular 1 ’ A ^ (I f agreement, or they would not conclude one at all till they saw how their main trans-Indian service suited their requirements. As regards (B) of Mr. Peel f s minute (the sentence immediately following (A)), this also is a view which, in the absence of further elaboration by Sir W. Fraser-Tytler, the Foreign Office feel unable to share or understand - please see in this connexion the minutes on N 5090/38/97. Q UC h Soviet citizens as the Soviet Government desire to send to Kabul (and ojf course no others would be allowed by them to go) will be sent there regardless of the dis comforts of the route (which by Soviet standards are negligible now), provided always that the Afghan visa can be obtained. tSgd. ) D.W.

They both appreciate the advantages to be gained from such a service, particularly in the direction of encouraging closefcontact between India and Afghanistan, and also in the way of AO pr op agenda showing that air enterprise is not the monopoly of the Germans and the Soviet Government. Moreover, the route is an easy one for modern aeroplanes, and the strategical objection to the opening up of the prohibited area of tribal territories to occasional flights by foreign aircraft is not, in the view of the Government of India, serious. 7 m Wt in380/T 121 icon 5.38 8 ./2 At the same time, in view of other considerations, both are agreed in advising that we should go slow in this matter, and wait, at any rate for a year, until we have further information about the Germans* intentions and the financial situation improves. They point out that neither the Germans nor the Russians have yet succeeded in establishing a regular service, and it is possible that when the Germans have started their service across India to the Far East, they may drop the line to Kabul. The Russian service also might be closed down if the Afghans ever get a reasonable road through to the Oxus. If, on the other hand, a regular British service started running between Lahore and Kabul, it is probable that both the Russians and the Germans would demand a regular service also, and, in addition, the Germans might ask for permission to prolong their existing service to Kabul into India; a request which it would be difficult to refuse. If permission for this were granted and the Germans established a direct service from Berlin via Kabul to Lahore and thence to the Far East the route would be much shorter than that taken by Imperial Airways, to whose interests it might accordingly prove detrimental. As regards the Russians, Sir William Fraser-Tytler points out that a regular service would be bound to involve a relaxation of the present very firm attitude which the Afghans maintain over the entry of Soviet subjects into Afghanistan, and would lead to an increased number of Russians entering the country. He attaches importance to this aspect of the matter, and it would seem probable that the attitude of the Afghan Government tov/ards a British service might be considerably sv/ayed by this consideration. It is true that this danger might/Minute Paper Department v ; Department. 3. might perhaps 'be met, as suggested by the Foreign Office (see Mr. Lascelles' Minute of 21st January) by the expedient of running the Lahore-Kabul service on the same lines as the present German and Russian services, i.e., in theory, as irregular services. I am not sure, however, that the Government of India would ever agree to facing the expenditure involved unless they had definite permission from the Afghans to run a regular service. 3. Finally, and, from the Government of India f s point of view, this is a very important consideration, there is the question of finance. It was estimated in 1933 that an annual subsidy of 3 lakhs would be needed, and, in addition, a ^capital outlay v/ould be involved since aeroplanes for the service would have to be purchased. The Government of India do not feel that in existing financial conditions expenditure on this scale would be justified. ^It may be mentioned that in 1933 they were prepared to charge half the required subsidy to Civil Aviation Estimates and to debit the remainder to the Afghan Reserve Fund. •&gt; ^ ^ ku 4. There are, of course, arguments on both sides of this question, and the Foreign Office take the view that the advantages of a British service would outv/eigh the disadvantages pointed out by Sir William Fraser- Tytler and Sir Aubrey Metcalfe. I am, however, impressed by the weight of expert opinion that it would be politically disadvantageous to have regular German and Soviet services, and there is at least a reasonable UsUl possibility that the Germans wottld abandon their Kabul started. service once they have got their route through xntox India/ They would certainly find it very expensive to run both ’ 7173 Wt 8900/111 10,000 4.88 services/4. services. A great advantage of giving them permission for the route through India lies, of course, in the fact that it is under our control. The strategical objections to opening up the corridor through tribal territory to foreign aircraft are perhaps not serious, but they are at any rate a consideration which tells against the scheme. As regards the question of promoting British prestige, a great deal has been done by Mr. Russell Stracey, who has been training Afghan airmen in Kabul, and the projected sale of another tv/enty Hinds to the There are^other and Afghan Government will also help, less expensive ways of achieving this object ? which are under consideration. The scheme for a British air service would undoubtedly be an expensive luxury which could only be justified on the grounds of its political value, and I feel that the case for this has not yet i been made out. Possibly in a years time circumstances will have altered. Umj * i A i£.lL ir&lt;- c&amp;t,* t Military Secretary . ^ , E. &amp; 0.

'fhe political objection could very easily be overcome by the simple expedient of running the Lahore-Kabul service on the same lines as the German and Soviet services, i.e. regularly in fact, but not in theory: the system appears to work quite well. The commercial objection, on the other hand, might well apply even if it were possible to prevent the Germans from prolonging their service from Kabul to Lahore; for the service to Kabul is so fast that a good many people might prefer it even if it meant waiting a day or two in Kabul end flying on by the British service. But it is not as though Imperial Airways were at present without competitors*. &gt; V Await India Office minutes. (Sd.) D. LASGELLES. January 21. ^Moreover we cannot hope to keep Kabul permanently insulated from India. I agree generally with the above minute. There are no real political objections to the service, and we could always refuse a German request for permission to use tne same route on the ground of the security of tne frontier and of the concession already made to the Germans by allowing them to fly across India at all. Finance is the real trouble; but even tnat, I suspect, looms larger than it need do in the minds of the Government of India. (Intld.) L.G. . r I — Ij ■ Vltor' «•* air arnica to Kabul. I am desired to refer to paragraph 4 of your demi-official letter No *P*2•4492/38, dated the oth July 1938, and to the subsequent correspondence that has passed between the Foreign Office and Fraser-Tytier on the above mentioned subject. You ask for the views of ihe Grovernment of India as to whether it wDuld oe to our advantage to attempt to counteract Grerman influence in Afghanistan by running a British air service between Lahore and Kabul. There are strong arguments both for and against the proposal and it will perhaps be helpful if I set these forth in some detail. 2* To take first the arguments in favour of it, there can, in the opinion of the Government of India, be no doubt that the technical difficulties would oe slight, if modern aircraft are used, since the distance is very short and no hi^i mountain ranges xj.o,ve to be crossed. Politically there is much to be said for .the proposal, since it would encourage closer contact betweeni s • • *. - 2 - between India and Afghanistan and would show to the Afghan people that air enterprise is not the monopoly of the Crermans or of the Soviet Government. Strategically it would not appear to be particularly dangerous in spite of the fact that it would mean opening up the prohibited area of tribal territories to occasional flights by foreign aircraft. 3. There are however important objections, financial political and commercial which merit careful considera tion. Such a service would need a heavy subsidy from Government, which was estimated in 1933 at about 3 lakhs per annum. Considerable capital outlay would also be involved, since there are now no available aircraft and these would have to be purchased. The Government of India feel that until financial conditions shov/ great improvement they would not be justified in considering any outlay on the scale involved. Apart from this to establish such a service at present might well encourage both the German and the Soviet Governments to press the Afghan Government for permission to establish their existing irregular services to Kabul on a permanent oasis. As you are aware no such permanent permission has yet been given to the 3oviet Government and we understand that the German service from Berlin to Kabul{%g\ 4 -3- /ndia .M ^ ^ is still on a purely temporary basis. The German Government have recently received permission from His Majesty 1 s Government to set up a service to the Far .jjast across India by the same route as is used by the Dutch and French Air Services. It thorAf ^ /J tn ey may drop the line to Kabul which must be extremely ^ expensive and of little but political value to them/ ^here is also the commercial asoect which mio*ht h« nf ^rA-' — v.ixxoxx m jL^i o uo U s interest to Imperial Airways. If a regular British service is running between Lahore and Kabul, it is c '° Iss-st possible, if not probable, that the German Government might ask for permission to prolong their service to Kabul into India, and, although it would be possible under the International Air Convention of 1919, to refuse this it might be difficult to find adequate reason lor doing so. If a direct service were established by the Deutsche Lufthansa from Berlin via Kabul to Lahore and thence to the Far Last, the route followed would be much shorter than that taken by Imperial Airways and a very distinct advantage in time and possibly in cost of passage would be achieved to the detriment of Imperial Airways.fc* T e/* -4- 4. Taking all these factors into consideration, the Government of India are of opinion that it would be wise to abstain for at any rate another year from raising the question with the Afghan Government• It migjat however be taken up again after the financial position show signs of improvement and wd have some clearer indications as to the Gorman Government’s intentions both v/ith regard to their existing service to Kabul and their proposed service across India to the Far East. 5.

As regards the Soviet aspect (para 2), it must surely be true, and seems to be tacitly admitted by Colonel Fraser-Tytler, that the operation of the existing irregular service, with or without passengers, has already enabled the Soviet authorities to acquire strategic experience of the route. Possibly an agreement to permit a regular service would 'imply permission for Soviet citizens to use it'. But the influx of Soviet citizens would continue to be controlled by the Afghan Government by means of the visa system. It is not as though Kabul were at pre- sent inaccessible from the Soviet side: any Soviet citizens for whom the Soviet Government can obtain Afghan visas can always get to Kabul as it is, and I doubt whether the Soviet Govern ment would attempt to send many more into Afghan istan if a regular air service were established - or, for that matter, many less if the present irregular service were discontinued on the establishment of an adequate road connexion. On the other hand there is much force in Colonel Fraser-Tytler 1 s argument that the danger of a German trans-Pamir route to the Par East being established is for practical reasons a remote one, and that consequently we are not necessarily faced with a choice between such a German trans-Pamir service and a German service using the Khyber or the Kurran valley. Qy: Copy minutes to 1.0.Minutes, As regards the Russian argument, I agree with Mr. Lascelles. Colonel Praser-TytJ.er has missed my point. As regards the question of the German service, too, my point was that, even if there was no such service over the Pamirs, the fact 4 that there is now to be a German service to and across India in any case reduces the objections to a German service to India viaKabul, making the point at issue simply whether or not there is much more objection to having it via Kabul than to having it follow a more southerly route before it gets to India. Moreover, even if that route is open to objections which do not apply to a route via Persia, it is still arguabl I think, that these would be outweighed by the advantages of having a British service to Kabul.

You suggest that it would be preferable xo have a German service running through tne corriaor, rather than to see one established over the Pm ire* X am inclined to agree witn you, though I am not certain how far the Inuiai authorities would do so. I daresay however taat uiey mi^it not view a corridor tiirough the Kurram valley, wxiich is of course the raost direct line to Lahore, as quite so dangerous as one through the Khyber* But I, tiiougn X bid not bring this out clearly in my letter to Peel, was basing my attitude not so much on a enaica of evils, as on the consiueration that the eataoiisiu?ient of a iertian line over die Pamir to China scemea at present to be a long way off. In order to establish such a line it would I think be necessary to have at least one or pemaps two landing grounds in binkiang, for emergencies if for nothing else, and I do not tain*, as things are at present, there is a possibility of the Jhissians who are in virtual control there permitting such an arrangement. If tne Japanese overrun Hortn China they may I suppose endeavour to get control of dinkiang, but it seems at least doubtful '.ihether tne Buasiana would ever allow them to spread tneir influence so far along their southern oorder, without a fight. The possibility that the German service might extend across the Pamirs therefore seamed to me to be raore remote than the possibility that once thc;ir route tnrougn India was estaolishea they might abanaon this un~ profitable Kabul route. 4.

INDIA OFFICE J Dear Peel, I have read with interest the copy which Fraser- Tytler sent to me of his letter to you of the 22nd July about the Kabul - India air service; but, with all respect to his local knowledge, I am not convinced that there is any danger in a Russian civil air service to Kabul, or much danger in a German service from Kabul to India. We know, from the Military Attache’s weekly summaries, , £ that Russian aeroplanes now fly more or less regularly /r L between Kabul and Termez; and as the objection to a Russian service is strategic, it can surely make very little odds whether they carry civilian passengers or not. As regards yasa las the Germans, we have now given permission for a German service to the Far East via India; and it does not seem to me to matter much in practice whether that service comes to India via Kabul or via a more southern route. It may be undesirable to have German aeroplanes flying over the Khyber Pass; but it would seem still less desirable to have them flying/ R.T.

H / l 0 K •1938 j In your lex.T,er of 5th July No. P.Z* 4192/38., you ask for my observations on the question of Tihe establisnment of an air service between India and Kabul, as a counter to uhe newly es'uablished German service from Berlin. 2. You will by this time perhaps have seen my despatch No. 85 of June 28th, which deals generally with the expansion of German influence in Afghanistan, and contains some suggestions for countering it. In the concluding paragraphs I have raised the question of an air service from Lahore (not London as stated) to Kabul and thence to Karachi, as a piece of counter propaganda to the German service. 3. prom the local point of view such a service would be useful, not only as propaganda, but as a link, with the capital of the Punjab, and also with Afghanistan*s principal port in India. I consider that its value in Kabul would be very considerable, as affording a means of quicker communication with India, and thereby helping towards a sadly needed improvement in understanding between trie two countries. r a / (, / 3 ir. 4. At the same time I fear that the objections raised in the note accompanying your letter have much weight. I referred to one of them in my despatch, namely the possibility that the Russians might, in the event of our establishing a service, consider themselves impelled to do the same. I did not refer to the second objection, namely that the establish ment of our service might lead to the linking up of the two German lines, because I did not know at the time what action R. Peel Esquire, India office, London. j Mid.

Once the corridor were opened it would be very difficult to prohibit foreign air craft from using it regularly. 5. Liy conclusion, a regretful one, is that we should go slow. The German service is not yet established by convention and the Foreign Minister dropped me a hint a day or tv/o ago that it might not be. It is possible'too as mentioned in your note that the German community here has reached its peak and that it, and with it a certain degree of German influence will tend to decline. One cannot however be certain of this, and I am watching the situation carefully. should the German line be established on a permanent footing, and German influence tend to increase rather than to diminish, I might have to alter my attitude. For the present however I think we should leave the air prestige of Britain in Kabul in the very capable hands of Russell-Stracey and his Hawker mechanics. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe and Collier.Despatch from H. M. y s Mikistf&gt;r, Kabul, to His Majesty^ Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 85, dated the 28th June 1938. Deports submitted by this Legation in the past three years have drawn attention to the rapid increase in the German economic penetration of Afghanistan. The possibility that this penetration might have motives other than purely economic has been mentioned, but there has hitherto been no evidence on which to base any conclusions of this nature. Recent events in Europe seem however to place a different interpretation on German activities in general, and the recent establishment in Afghanistan of an uneconomic German air service lends weight to the suspicions 1 have at times entertained that German activities in Afghanistan may have ulterior motives, which in circumstances might constitute a definite menace to the British Empire. It is as yet impossible to say if these suspicions are well founded or not but a brief review of Afghan-German relations at the present time may perhaps be of value. 2. At the end of 1934 relations between Afghanistan and Germany were none too good. Early in 1935 the trial and execution in Berlin of the Afghan student who had murdered the Prime Minister’s brother a year before, and the imyment by Afghanistan of an instalment of the debt owed by Ex-King Amanullah to Germany restored confidence between the two countries at the moment when the first foundations of the new Afghan economic structure were being laid. It is probable that had His Majesty’s Government and the Govern ment of India been prepared at that time to assist Afghan commercial develop ment Germany would have not obtained the foothold she now has in the economic life of this country. In 1935, however, the state of world politics, were different from what they are today, and Germany was prepared to take commercial risks which at the time appeared unjustifiable to more prosperous, countries. 3. The development of German penetration of this country was favoured by three factors, the readiness of the German Government to advance credits and to accept payment partially in raw material, the supply of fairly efficient experts of different types who were ready to work for a moderate wage in conditions of supreme discomfort, and the natural German bias of Mr. Abdul Majid, President of the National Bank, who is married to a German wife. This combination of factors has produced the following results. The German Gov ernment has furnished credits of between one and two million pounds to Afghanistan for the purchase of arms, and is taking in return over a term of years £600,000 worth of raw material and the balance in cash, two of the great manufacturing firms, Siemens and Steel Union are believed to have advanced another million and a half pounds for the purchase of machinery and there are now employed in Afghanistan over 80 Germans in 25 to 30 different branches of activity. I forward as an enclosure to this despatch an abstract taken from our most recent return of foreigners. It represents a conservative estimate and is probably not complete, but it illustrates to what extent German influence has permeated the early stages of industrial development of this country. 4. On the social and cultural side of the picture the revival of the German school in 1935 has had a powerful and lasting effect on a proportion of the rising generation. Two years ago the Olympic Games at Berlin gave an oppor tunity to a number of young Afghan athletes to see something of German orga nisation and efficiency, and the tales they brought back of their experiences in Germany as compared with the hospitality they met with elsewhere in Europe lost nothing in the telling*. And now there is a German air service operating regularly and efficiently and linking Kabul with Berlin by a week ly flight of only 40 hours duration. These are all matters which ha%had and are having an effect on the young intelligentsia of Afghanistan, among whom admiration and respect for the rising power of Germany is wide spread. 5. The question is how far this influence could in any conceivable circum stances be a menace to British interests or security. So long as the world is at peace the assistance rendered by Germany to the progress of Afghanistan is to our advantage. Afghanistan wants all the help she can get in develop ing her resources and increasing her prosperity, and any country which assists her to this end should earn our gratitude. But in the event of war in which ENCLOSURE tN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter Dated _ Received No. JUL J 3 AM AUG 1238 I2 Great Britain was involved the position would be far different. It is probably true that the German penetration of this country is aimed primarily at Russia and that the Germans see in Afghanistan the focal point in Central Asia where they might link up with Japan against the Soviet Government, but what is true of Russia is also true of India. In any war involving Great Britain and Germany, the latter would certainly attempt to make use of Afghanistan as a base from which at any rate to harrass the frontier of India and tie up as much as possible of the Army and Air Force in India. 6. It may seem very unlikely that such an attempt would be at all success ful, but experiences of the last war have shown the amazing tenajlcity of purpose of the German race and the courage with which they will further their country’s interests in the most difficult and dangerous circumstances. Von Lettow in East Africa and Wassmuss in Iran are good instances of these qualities, and it will also not be forgotten that a mission of^mr Germans actually penetrated to Kabul in circumstance of extraordinary difficulty in 1917. The good sense of the Amir Habibullah, aided by an annual cash subsidy of twenty and a half lakhs of rupees, kept Afghanistan neutral but the Germans are as I have shown above in a far stronger position in Afghanistan today than they were in 1914. 7. I would not suggest that Afghanistan is in the least likely in the event of war to join either side, least of all to run the risk of annihilation by Great Britain, but with this extremely vulnerable border at her disposal, the ques tion of the benevolence or otherwise of her neutrality is a matter of much importance. In 1921 Sir Denys Bray, then Foreign Secretary to the Govern ment of India recorded the following significant note in commenting on Afghan intrigue \\’ith the tribes :—‘ We must face the fact squarely that the Amir has it m his power to stir up the frontier tribes whenever he' likes, and bv the expenditure of a few hundred rupees among them, and#he cost of a modicum 0 trouble 1o himself, to land us in an expenditure of crores and an infinity of ^ r0 lnoi 31.' fact is unfortunately nearly if not quite as true now as it was m IJJ1- Without a breach of neutrality an ill-disposed Government in Kabul could materially help our opponents, and it is obvious that in the event of war every effort of the Germans established in this country, backed by German money, would be to see that they did so. 8 . If the above appreciation is correct and His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India consider that efforts should be made while there is still time to counter this German influence, an estimate of our present position 1 lhlS P T ° t s ! tK ! n 18 in many respects considerably weaker than it was in the last war It is true that we have succeeded in living down to a aige (.egice the hatred and suspicions of the previous hundred years, but much Ins bem°nuTl l iLd n h en&lt; ]r ed ' ^ p - es . e . nt S eneral Policy towards Afghanistan he tribes We i, .I t | he / eeUmllg 1 1I 7' ltatl °ns of the forward policy towards tlie trifles Me have lost our exclusive position and the strong lever of a vcaily cash payment to an impoverished country.

There are upwards of 100 unofficial Nazi Agents scattered through out the length and breadth oi Afghanistan, in closer touch with the people than any other foreigners, living the life of the country', and no doubt spreading Nazi propaganda and pro-German ideas wherever possible. Against this we have an admirable but restricted agent in our tiny Air Force contingent, a repre sentative of Messrs. Marcoiiis who may soon be leaving and the Indian Trade Agency. This Agency Inis much political as well as commercial value and could be of far more value were the Agent able to maintain his position fully against foreign competition, to tour the country, visit all the main commercial centres and encourage trade exchanges between Afghanistan and India. We have recently been ashed to find experts to assist the Afghan Government in developing their coal fields. This is an opportunity which will I trust not be missed ot getting a tooting in what may be a valuable industry in th future. As a result of Sir Arthur Giver’s visit (my despatch No. 62, dated the 24th May, lf J8), we may be asked to assist the Afghan Government in the development of their animal husbandry^. We should certainly be ready to pro vide experts for such an undertaking. There are at present before the Govern ment of India certain proposals recently made to me by Mr. Abdul Majid (my endorsement despach No. 68, dated the 4th June, 1938), for assisting Afghan trade. These should receive the most careful consideration of the Govern ment of India and every endeavour should be made to encourage the transit of goods to and from Afghanistan through India, and to develop Indo-Afghan trade. 11. The above are a few examples of opportunities I believe we should grasp of improving our position here. I mention them to illustrate the type of action 1 would recommend. I do not wish to suggest that His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India are not already doing a great deal for their posi tion in this country. But if I am correct in my appreciation the times are abnormal and call for a special effort. 12. There is one other matter I would mention and that is the question of the Air Service. -As Your Lordship is aware it has been decided that should the Soviet Government establish an air service to Kabul the Government of India would perforce have to exercise their right under the option granted to them in 1.930 to run a similar service from India. The reasons for this decision art given in paragraph 5 of despatch ^No. 1 of 1933 from the Government of India to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. The Soviet Government have not established an air service and appear unlikely to do so at present (vide m&gt; telegram of May 11th, Katodon 62). The question remains for considera tion whether the Germans should be held to constitute sufficient menace to make it advisable lor His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India to seek the consent of the Afghan Government to the establishment of an air service from India to Kabul, to counteract the influence of the new German service. 13. On that question I find it very difficult to proffer advice. The German service carries no mails and only four passengers per trip. It cannot possibly pa} and its sole, object must be found in its propaganda value and in the fact that it may someday link up with a Japanese line across North China. So far as German influence m Afghanistan is concerned it is a valuable piece of pro paganda, providing as it does the one direct link between this country and mi rope, and giving the undoubted impression that in Europe Afghans will find their first and warmest welcome in Berlin. h 14. Up to the present no convention has been signed, and it is possible tint none may be signed for some time to come. But the service is running regu- nrl' f an r + ?- Sma gronr l d ? taff ^ as been established on the aerodrome. If the effect of this propaganda is to be counteracted at all it must be done in such manner as not m any way to impair the high reputation of our militarv air craft m this country and it should also be of some practical vahm such as a sj&amp;rssssr ‘sa - K -“ ■' ■a-* &gt;»« 5 lo.

It may perhaps be better there fore to leave the question of an air service alone for the present, in spite of the undoubted advantage the Germans have by being alone in the field. 16.

COPY OF Whitehall, S.W.l. 5th July, 1938 Would you please refer to the official application dated 12th March, 1938, from the German Government for facilities in India and Burma for an air service from Berlin to the Par Bast, with a provisional terminus at Bangkok, a copy of which was enclosed in our air mail letter No. 15 of 9th April last? ^or vanious reasons, including the recent pre-occupation of the Air Ministry with other matters, there has been rather a long delay in replying to the German Government's letter. The whole question was recently referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence and to the Cabinet, who agreed on the 25th May, that in view of the attitude of the Afghan Government (oee Katodon Ho. 53 of 21st April), it was no longer either practicable or politic to attempt to oppose the establishment of the German air service to Kabul. They also agreed that iu would on balance be to our advantage to grant to the Germans the transit facilities for which they were asking on the usual route across India and Burma for an air service to Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, KCIE., CSI., MVO., External Affairs Department, Government of India, Simla. the/the Far l^ast. It was accordingly decided that the Air v^Jinistry should inform the Germans that His Majesty's Government would be prepared to grant these facilities on the understanding that the German Government for their part would be ready to grant reciprocal facilities for British services in other quarters, and to use any influence they might have to assist Imperial Airways in obtaining facilities in the Far East. ihe Air Ministry are still considering the precise form of the reply to be returned to the Germans, but it is expected that it will now issue shortly, and a copy will of course be sent to you as soon as it does. In view of the Government of India's official letter of the 2&lt;^nd September, 19o7, No. F.262-F/37, we did not think you would require to be consulted again on the question of principle but there will no doubt be matters of detail which will have to be taken up with the Communications Department when the reply to the German Government finally issues. Having regard to the recent establishment of the German air service to Kabul in addition to other forms of German penetration of Afghanistan, the question has been raised whether it worud be to our advantage to attempt to counteract German influence/AN influence “by running a British service to Kabul from India. We should be grateful if you could let us have the views of the Government of India on this subject 9 and I enclose a copy of a tentative departmental note which might ? perhaps, be helpful as a basis for your consideration. I am sending a copy of this letter and of its enclosure to Fraser-Tytler and also to Collier. (Sgd.) R. PEEL,P.Z.4192/38 Copy of QUEST I OF OF THE E STAHL I SHMEITT OF AF AIH SERVICE BETWEEF HID IA AFD I01BUL. The question of an air service from India to Kabul has in recent years always been considered with special reference to the danger of the establishment of a regular Soviet service to Kabul from the U.S.S.R. The conclusion reached by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India has been that ’’the Soviet Government would gain greater advantages (political and strategic) from a Soviet air service to Kabul 9 than would we s from a complementary British service 5 and consequently it has not been in our interests to take the initiative in establishing a British service to Kabul ? as this would have made it easier for the Soviet Government to obtain a service on their side.” On the other hand ? in the event of the actual establishment of the Soviet service, it has been recognised by His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India that it would be essential for us to maintain a British service in order to miti ate the effects of the Soviet service. A German weekly air service to Kabul is now in operation, though no definite agreement on the subject has yet been concluded between the German and the Afghan Governments; a separate application to the Afghan Government being required for permission for each flight. We are also on the point of granting the Germans facilities for an air service to the i: ; 'ar East by the normal route used by Imperial Airways across India and Burma. In these circumstances the question has been raised whether it would be to our advantage to run a service from India to Kabul, if permission could be obtained from the Afghan Government,/(vtt] 2 . Government ? in order to counteract German influence in Afghanistan. On a previous occasion in 1932 when the question of a German service in Afghanistan was mooted, H.M.G. and the Government of India were prepared to regard such a service, as far as Kabul at any rate, with goodwill as tending to exclude a Russian service. bincc that date, however, the position has changed considerably. Anglo-German relations have deteriorated and there has recently been a great increase in German economic penetration into Afghanistan. At the beginning of this year there were no fewer than 119 Germans (71 men) in various posts all over Afghanistan and they are at present by far the largest foreign community in the country. On the other hand, there is as yet no evidence of political intrigue by Germans in Afghanistan. Movcover, there is a good deal of hostility among the Afghans themselves against the recent increase in the number of foreigners in the country. It is quite probable, therefore, that the German community has reached its peak and will henceforth tend to decline, though the economic influence which Germany has obtained may nevertheless remain and the maintenance of the German air service would tend to consolidate this influence. Prom the strategic point of view the danger of a German air service seems clearly to be much less than that of a Soviet Service. For the present the German service to Kabul may oe regarded as being on an experimental basis. The original scheme was to extend the service from Kabul across Ginkiang to the Par Past in co-operation with the Japanese. This scheme has been shelved for the present, though/v,'- *&gt; 3. though it does not appear to have 13001'' entircl3 r abandoned hy the Germans. At the same time there is abundant evidence that the Japanese are still hoping to participate in this service and that they are an::ious to negotiate with the Afghan Government on the subject. Before they could participate effectively it would be necessary for the Japanese, apart from the difficulty of obtaining facilities from the Afghan Government which the latter will probably not be eager to grant, to secure a base in China from which to fly across Sinkiang to Kabul. The activities of the Japanese are somewhat obscure, but perhaps the most plausible explanation is that they hope soon to bring the war in China to a successful conclusion and dictate terms to the Chinese. They would then secure permission from the Chinese Central authorities (v/hoever they might be, if any, at the conclusion of the war) to fly across Sinkiang from China to Kabul. In Sinkiang itself Soviet influence is predominant, while the Provincial authorities are virtually independent of the Central Chinese Government and strongly anti-Japanese. It seems improbable therefore that the Japanese would be able to establish landing grounds in Sinkiang, even if granted permission by some Central Chinese authority to fly over that Province. impart from all the other obstacles, the physical difficulties of the route v/ould be very great. At present, therefore, the position is that the German service has reached a dead-end at Kabul and there seems little prospect of it obtaining an outlet beyond Afghanistan in the immediate future. It cannot/cannot 'be a paying proposition and it still scene just possible that in course of time it may die a natural death. if 9 on the other hand 5 a British service were to be established between Kabul and India this would, have the effect of linking up the German service to Kabul v/ith their proposed service across India to the Par East. The establishment of a British service would involve the opening up of a ’'corridor' 1 through the ”prohibited area 1 ' on the North-West Frontier. Under the International ^ir Navigation Convention we should then have to allow occasional flights by foreign civil aircraft in this ’•corridor' but refusal to permit a second regular air service to use it would not be a breach of the Convention. On the other hand; with the Germans already running a service to Kabul and also a service across India it might not in practice be easy to refuse them permission to join up these services by flying the same route as ourselves from Kabul to India, especially if as seems likely; similar reciprocal facilities had to be granted to the -ufghans as ei condition of their granting facilities for the British service. For strategic and political reasons there are of course strong objections to the establishment of any foreign air line in the ^outh or South East of Afghanistan. The present German service to Kabul and Tehran is very fast (the scheduled time between Berlin and Tehran is only 27 - 30 hours) and a through route from Bagdad via Tehran; Kabul and Peshawar to the Far East v/ould be slightly shorter than the route followed by Imperial Airways. Even if it were practicable to exclude the Germans from the Kabul-India route the linl: provided by the British service might still tend to crystallise the5. present experimental German Service to Kabul into a permanent air route. There is also the old danger that the establishment of a British service might make it more difficult for the Afghans to resist a Soviet request for similar facilities. It is true that the Afghan Government have permitted the present German service in spite of Soviet opposition and that the present trend of Soviet policy seems to be against the linking of the U.S.S.B. with other countries oy air services s but Soviet policy is opportunist and circumstances might cause the Russians to revert to their previous attitude and press for a regular Soviet Air Service. If the question could have been considered apart from international complications, there has always been a good case on grounds of prestige for the establishment of a British air line to Kabul though it could not be justified on economic grounds. It is possible that ultimately the general development of foreign air services in Afghanistan may be inevitable in which case we could not afford to be left out of it. But on balance we are likely to lose more by such development than we should gain by our own participation, and it is doubtful if the existing German service is a sufficient argument for taking the initiative in the matter at this stage by pressing the Afghan Government to allow a British service. It might however be worth while asking the Government of India and the Minister at Kabul for their views on the subject. If for reasons of policy His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India considered it desirable to establish a British air line to Kabul, the financial difficulties should not be very great. When the me.Iter was/'1 was last under consideration in 1935 the G-overnacnt of P.Z.9089/35 India calculated that the running of a weekly service hy Indian National airways in Noth directions between Delhi and Kabul via Lahore and Pc she. war would cost rather more than PlS. 3 lakhs per annum. They were prepared to charge approximately half that amount (for the Delhi-Lahore part ¥ about £11 s 540 p ^ ^ V x VsO Vv.i-0 r of the route) to their Civil aviation estimates and to debit the remainder (as bein, entirely uneconomic) to the 3€ Afghan Deserve Fund. An annual drain of upwards of Ds.li lakhs would be certain sooner or later to unbalance the latter fund ? and under our arrangement with the Treasury the Government of India would expect His Majesty’s Government to meet any expenditure which could not be covered out of their own annual contributions of Hs.5 lakhs to the fund. The financial aspect of the scheme may of course have changed considerably since 1935. In particular the Government of India did not find it necessary in 1955 to allow for any initial expenditure on aircraft since they proposed to run the Service with certain machines then available in India. It would probably be necessary in existing circumstances to incur fairly large capital expenditure on this account. 7/6/38QUESTION OP THE ESTABLISHMENT OP AN AIR SERVICE BETWEEN INDIA AND KABUL.
