December 1932 regarding the transfer of the petuol store of the Royal Air Force from Ras-el- Khima to Dubai; erection of moorings for sea planes in the Khor of Dubai and to enquire from the^ verbally whether he accepts the suggestion. I have to inform jfour Excellency that I went to Duhai and approached Shaikh Sa^ed bin Maktoom and discuss ed the matter with him. He said that he would give his reply after two days. In the meantime the Commander of H.M.S. Ormonde asked me to take permission from the Shaikh to erect a tide-gauge and to keep a Jolly boat near it in the Khor, with four Englishmen to work and then to hoist flags in the sea a.nd on land. The Commander asked also for the permission to climb the fort of the Govern ment of Dubai for measurements# On account of all this some confusion was created in Shaikh 1 s mind by his cousins and other associateso After much difficulty I was able to persuade them to accept the request of the Commander. I have already referred the matter to Captain E.HoGastrell, Your Exvellency's Secretary at Bushire by letter No.45 dated the 17th. January i955 in this Vespect. The Commander H.M.S. Ormonde has not finished his measurements yet. When I approached the Shaikh ^gain for his opinion on the subject he replied that he was not in a position to give his opinion until the end of the iionth of Ramadhan. Hewill consult with his cousins and other associates from al Bu Fallasa and then give a definite reply. Meanwhile I am gradually inducing the cousins of Shaikh to agree with the Shaikh on that subject. I hope to he acquainted with the idea of the Shaikh after Ramadhan and then Your Excellency will be informed. Ho /Translation of letter Ho.48 dated the l^tii.

T heg tc state that I have 'been communicating with the Shaikh cf Aodu I3ha ui en the subject since the receipt cf ycur letter. Tc succeed in this matter I interviewed the Drcther cf the Shaikh cf AMu Hiabi named fla^a and another gentleman called shaikh Ahmad Din Muhammad bin Hilal Al-Dhahiri whe is a wise man and the Shaii:h and ethers listen tc his advice. I cen- ferred with them in this respect and asked them tc try and persuade the Shaikh tc accept the Hs*400/-. Beth these Shaikhs assured me that they will try tc per suade the Shaikh tc accept the mcney and tc reinstate the guards. in this cQunectien I sent a relative cf mine with them with a letter tc the Shaikh a cepy cf which I beg tc enclcse herewith fcr ycur infermatien. The man stayed there fcr tjrfen days and then returned with letters frem the Shaikh and Ahmad bin Hilal which I ferward herewith in criginal. The pur- P^i t ol these letters is that they wculd exchange views and then let me have a reply. I have 'been waiting all this time' fcr their reply. 1 further oeg tc state that as the messenger sent tc Abu Dhaoi under steed Shaikh Khalifah 'bin Saidfeaid is opposing Shaikh Shakhmit in accepting the Hs»40o/- unless the Hon'hie the political Resident will fix for them a pay more than Is•100 per mensem. They will accept ^s.300 a month and not less than this sum. This is what he understood from Shaikhs Khalifah and Shalahbut. 1 'beg to points cut that ooth the Shaikhs Khalifah and Shakhhut would not accept the amount unless it is increased. In my humble opinion and subject to your app roval it seems advisable I think to appoint three guards there and pay them mcnthly. xhe people or Ao^u l^iabi are not in favour of Shaikh Shakhbut and his government; they are divided into two parties:- 1. called Al-^abyat - comprised of Shaikh Shakhbut and his brothers maternal unices; * 2. different tribes against ^abyCat namely, the Mahare- bah, Hamthiah, Hawamil, Kumaan, Mazaria and A1 Bu Mahair They are inwardly a gainst the Shaikh and the Qabyat and the Shaikh is always afraid that they might Join hands with Shaikh Khalifah bin Zaid hence he cannot do any thing against the latter*s wish. I am still expecting a letter from the Said Shaikh, Letters in original from Shaikhs Shakhbut and Ahmad Din Khalifah to me are herewith enclosed. My views are as already submitted i.e. to appoint guards if you approve and decision rests with you. TT.E.

Shaikh R.A. Shaikh j - learnt from o ir friend 'Is^- that you agreed to allow a landing ground for the aireraft,for which I wish to thank you very much. Ihis is a matter which requires reconsideration P.A. refers to the matter about which I have spoken to you. Interrupts. Yes they are asking me for a landing ground, a matter which I want to think about before deciding. This I am saying because they asked my views, but if they want to do as they have done in the past at Sirr(Yas Island) then there seems to be no need for them to consult me in the matter. ffrM -6-u* Ahmad bin^ ' TJtaibah, Hazza r (Shaikh* s brother) and But i (Shaikh' uncle) interrupt, saying that if the matter is one for emergency only where no regular aerodrome or building is to be constructed, there is no object ion and the matter can be decided now. Shaikh P.A. Shaikh P.A. Shaikh P .A. Shaikh L T o,no, I have no intention of discussing the matter (means with his people) and I do not agree to allow a landing place. Last time I did not a^ree to allow a tank at Sirr(Yas Island), but the P.A«,Bahrain placed one against my will. If the Government want to have a landing ground they can do it without asking my consent, just as they did at Sirr That is planes &lt; for sea planes and this is for land aero- Yes, but I do not agree. The Government^asking you this in a friendly way and they have no desire to do things by force, although they have the force. You know that air craft requires a landing ground for use at time of emergency, just as we had to take shelter yesterday behind the island where 70 sailing boats were also taking shelter. Yes, this may be so, but xi I do not agree to it. It will be an emergency landing ground now, which later on will be used regularly as the sea planes now frequently visiting Sirr. The Government have taken Sirr and they should be satisfied with it, without asking me for additional thing. The people (Al Arab) know thet the tank was placed there against my wish and if the Govt, want to have a landing ground they can only do it in the manner they did at Sirr. The Govt, are helping the Shaikhs. They are getting passes, their foodstuff comes from India and etc., and in a friendly manner they have asked the Shaikh to help in this simple matter. I know that the Government with the people. I am also their help which they have to time, but I do not do a thing against my desire I would say that I should like to tank removed from Sirr and would not also are just and deal fairly thankful to them for extended to me from time expect they will force me to wish. If am asked about my have the allow a(2) (I landing ground, but if they want to do it without my consent they can do so, ielp n him f i? er is ^ eflt to inspect the ground would Shaikh Would the (joyernment force me to do a thing against my wi&amp;a. The people know that the Sirr question was done against my desire and no hlame lies with me. P.A. Our friend K.B. Isa is now arranging about the pay for the guards^and in a friendly man^er/we have ask ed your consent about the landing ground, from which the people will come to know that it was done with your consent and not by force. Shaikh This may be so, but why should not a reply be sent to the Government that I do not agree to this. question of the aircraft is an important one. They come from Europe to go to India and Australia and they require landing places on their way for use at time of emergency, and because it is import r the Government want to have landing place for use at time of emergency. They would notflise^always, as they have landing station at Bahrain and Shargah. Shaikh Still 1 do not agree to allow one in my country, unless I am forced to do so, in which case the/ Govt, can do what they like without consulting me. (Govt.) Tf they/say thajr it is important and send an Officei to inspect the ground would you help him ? Shaikh. The Govt, can do w^at they like just as they have done at Sirr, but it is not to.be considered that it was with my consent. P.A. I have arranged with the Commander of the ship to return at a certain time and will therefore go to the ship now. As, however, you wanted to reconsider the matter i am leaving K.B. Is-' behind so that he may come later and Inform me of the result. Shaikh I have decided once and for all that I will not agree to e landing ground, in my country and I have no more thing to reconsider. The Govt, may do what they like just as they have done in the past.Translation of - letter dated the LOth June 1933 from the Residency Agent,3harjah,to the Political Agent,Bahrain. -iter Compliment?. Reference your Confidential Letter iTo:176/C dated the 24th May 1933 in which you wanted me to talk with the Ruler of Abu Dhabi ahount a landing ground for aeroplanes at Abu Dhabi. I am to inform you that I cameto Abu Dhabi and had a talk with-the said Ruler about this matter. After doing -my best in order to induce Jahe said Ruler to agree for the landing of aeroplanes at times of emergency he agreed. But when you arrived at Abu Dhabi today and landed you had a talk with him and he refused. When I remained behind I renewed the talk with him and told him,that why did he agree at the beginning and now refuse,that this action on his part was not a good one which can be accepted. The Shaikh replied that if the aeroplane uses this at the time of emergency he has no objection,but that he will not allow anything to be done on such ground. This is what I could get from him. In my opinion it would be better if an aeroplane came and landed so that the Shaikh and his relatives have confidence I (that nothing more is requiredj Decision rests with you j Usual Ending.!• A J oily boat should be provi do d by us Tot p0'ti?ol» rnen the petrol comes from Sharjah to us and we should place it ob the Jolly boat. 2* Crew arid, guards to be appointed by us. 3.

After Compliments* I, most respectfully beg to say that on his arrival at Sharjah on 7th August 1933 by sea-plane,the Political Agent, Bahrain asked me about the question of storage of petrol at _ S. /2o /zt&gt; Dibai. I informed him that the Shaikh of Dibai agreed to Rs.300/- for the pays of guards and rent for the boat in which petrol is to be stored at the harbour. He,however,said that the Shaikh does not agree to the erection of a godown for petrol. I said ft Yes, he does not agree to that ft . Then he said that this monthly allowance is much and that he will discuss thas question with you. 2. After the departure of the Political Agent from Dibai I talked with the Shaikh and explained to him that a godown for petrol shall cause no harm to him. Thereupon he sent for his cousins and the notables of Dibai to be present. A long discussion took place between them and myself but they did not agree to a godown. They, however, agreed to a Jollyboat for petrol. On seer^ig that they do not agree to a godwwn,? asked the Shaikh(of Dibai)to reduce the rent. He agreed to Hs.220/- per mensem same as Ras-el-Khaimah, to be distributed as follows:- Pay of guards who watch the petrol,.Rs.100. Rent for jollyboat... •. .Rs. 120/- This is what has been arrived at with the Shaikh. He should provide a jollyboat for the purpose. He also wishes that out of the terms I submitted to you previously, some items may be omitted and some may stand. 3. The Shaikh of Dibai told me that the Honlble the Political Hesident may, for the time being, agree to the petrol being stored in a boat in the harbour so that his cousins may be Contented and th. notables of hi, p .opie nay ere.« trc , uble2. as the Arabs are ignorant and do not realize the things. They do political intrigues secretly such as what was done by the people of Abu Dhabi tov/ards their shaikhs. 4. It is hoped that they may be contended gradually.

The Air Officer Oomiaanding said that the present situation was satisfactory,that is to say the petrol dhow is actually there and is being used and land machines can land,though he would like to mark out the landing ground for land machines at a future date. It was decidec that the Political Resident should write to the Shaikh and diecuss matter with him (though holding out no hopes for the removal of the - petrol dtow should the Shaikh ask) he would come on board. A letter which the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah wrote to Colonel Looh while acting as Political Resident seemed to offer a suitable opportunity for writing in this sense to the Shaikh.

Command (Air Vice Marshall Burnett) with the Political Agent,Bahrain, (Colonel Loch). The Air Officer Commanding stated that he was in no hurry about the landing ground for land planes at Abu Bhabi but would like to examine the ground in one or two places,which had been selected from the air,one oi the places was^jra or oavon Abu Dhabi. 2. He regarded las Island as essential as it enabled aircraft to refuel with petrol when running short owing to an head wind if coming from the direction of Sharjah. The lock on the tank had already been tampered with on some occasions,though the culprits had not been able to get into it. It was necessary for Rangoons to go there at intervals to see if the tank was alright. Land planes would only use Yas Island in an emergency. 3. It was explained to the Air Officer Commanding that it would be very difficult for the Political Agent,Bahrain to go to Abu Dhabi with a request for a fuel tank at the landing ground for land machines as iie had already told the Shaikh that the ground would be used purely in emergencies,and the Shaikh had himself pointed out that Yas Island had been used considerably and a petrol tank put there without his consent,and how was he to know,if he gave peraission for the establishment of an emergency landing ground for land planes,that it would not lead immediately to a demand for a petrol tank and be used frequently. The Political Agent,Bahrain,said that it would be almost impossible for him to face the Shaikh,if he had to make such a demand.

I, therefore, went to Abu Dhabi to enquire from the Shaikh as to why they {guards) left the store to which the Shaikh replied that the guards wanted expenses. I told him that I proposed to him to pay one hundred rupees a month for the guards. He said that one hundred rupees was not sufficient. In the meantime you with txiC ahaiim arrived on H.M.S.Fowey and from the discussion you had^ou were able to know that he was not willing to post a guard there. From there I accompanied you to Sharjah, Later on when the Shaikh of Abo^habi came to Dibai at the time of your arrival with the battle ships,I talked over the matter with the Shaikh of Abu Uhabi who said that he wanted Rs ,,400/- a month / but 1 told him that this was not possible. He, however, insisted on getting this amount and although i tried to reduce the amount he did not agree stating that Sir Bani Yas is atalong distance from Abu Dhabi and the people whom he may post there require sufficient food namely rice, dates, coffee and money besides a boat hire which has to be given to the boat that takes the supplies every month.

Submitted. 7/ 1 On tne morning of tne 8tn February 1934: I discussed tne question of tne aerodrome Agreements with the Adviser. It was decided tnat we should postpone talcing the matter up with the Shaikh until after we naa approached him on the subject of the land acquisition. The Adviser thought that the terms were, gene rally speaicmg, reasonable but is getting figures of the customs duties recovered from luel and oil from Imperial Airways. It will then be possible to see wnether tne figure of £.500 is reasonable if otner Air Lines fly through Banrain. 2. The matter of policing the ground was discussed. It was decided tnat policing should be done by the Bahrain Government but probably it was not fair to include tne cost of policing m tne £.500 and tnat probably the best tnings would be to augment the police force by a section (10 men) or half a section and lor the cost to be recovered fromI Jo:166' lNo:167 Jo:168. @) those using tne aerodrome in some form or another. 3. The Adviser did not anticipate any ditiicultj in getting a letter of agreement that military aircraft should have priority. 2-1934: , pir? Resident's PftftUa Letter Ho:128-S of 6th February 1934.

Both the Shaikhs were strongly in favour ol a lump sum rent in the same way that a lump sum was paid lor tne Manamah ground,and that petrol and oil should continue to be taxed. They were prepared to let spare parts m iree oift duty.

The principal correspondents in the file are Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch, Political Agent at Bahrain, and Khan Bahadur ‘Īsá bin ‘Abd al-Latif, the British Government’s Native Agent at Sharjah.There are a number of revisions of a list detailing existing and required air facilities in the Gulf throughout the volume (folios 104-06, 134-36, 160-63, 197-98). Facilities are ranked either as vital, important or convenient. A map (folio 194) shows the geographical positions of these facilities, marking out the air route from Basra to Karachi. The facilities specifically referred to in the volume are as follows:1. A petrol depot at Şīr Banī Yās [referred to in the volume variously as Seer Island, Yas Island], which was part of the dominions of Shaikh Shakbut bin Sultan of Abu Dhabi. The RAF set up the depot at Şīr Banī Yās without Shaikh Shakbut’s consent, leading to the Shaikh refusing permission for the facility. Guards employed by Shaikh Shakbut and funded by the RAF to watch the depot later absconded to the pearl fisheries, leaving the depot unattended (folios 9-18, 51).2. An emergency landing strip at Abu Dhabi. Out of principle, and because the British Government had not sought his consent to install a petrol depot at Şīr Banī Yās, Shaikh Shakbut refused outright to grant permission for an emergency landing strip in his domain (folios 32, 53-54).3. A petrol depot (or dhow) for seaplanes at Dubai creek was proposed by RAF officials in December 1932 (folio 2), initially as an alternative, but later in addition to, the existing petrol depot at Ra's al-Khaymah. Negotiations took place throughout the course of 1933 to establish agreement on certain conditions laid down by Shaikh Sa’id bin Maktum before permission to establish the depot could be granted. The conditions are listed on folios 46-47, with a formal British response on folios 72-73. Numerous iterations of the agreement follow on folios 129, 139, 145-46, and 166.Also of interest in the volume is a report written by Loch and sent to Fowle, dated 13 June 1933 (folios 58-69), in which the Bahrain Agent offers his views on British policy with regard to the shaikhs of the Arab littoral. Loch writes that the Arab shaikhs now share a ‘spirit of refusal’ vis-à-vis British policy, and lists a number of incentives and disincentives that could be used to gain leverage with them.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Şīr Banī Yās Island</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003e6#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
