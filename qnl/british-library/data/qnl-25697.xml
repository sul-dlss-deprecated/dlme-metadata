Dear Mr. Clauson, 8395 I I j.9 56 I am informed by the Map Room that the suunly of flat cooies of the map prenared by us to illustrate Bertram Thomas’s paper and afterwards used in his book ’’Arabia Felix' is exhausted, but that there are folded conies in the stock of the Journal. We can, therefore, supply nine additional conies of the map mounted on linen and dissected for folding; but you will understand that they will not be quite so perfect as we supnlied before as they will have been folded differently for the Journal and the old fold will show. This will not, however, do any damage to the use of the man. The cost of the maps will be £/6d each, and I will send them to you when they are completed. Yours very truly, RESO.
