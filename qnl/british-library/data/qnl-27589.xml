CONFIDENTIAL^) 14-6130 13667 ( 2 )(E 6028/1283/25) Major Longrigg, of Petroleum Concesaions Limited (the !•P.0.) called on me yesterday morning for a general talk about his recent negotiations v-ith the Saudi Government* Beyond giving me a good deal of the local background - e*g* the friendly reception he had received at Taif, the agreeableness of the climate of Taif, the general manner in which the negotiations were conducted, some sidelights on the personalities concerned, and rather a gruesome account of M. Biraud*s last illness - Major Longrigg did not tell me -uch that we did not already know. 2. He produced the attached sketch map of the concession, but agreed that it did not go much further than the text, dince s in the north and south the concession is bounded by the northern and southern frontiers of Sauai Arabia, while inland it is bounded generally by a line running 100 miles from the coast; but the precise method of interpreting that definition or drawing the line has been left over for subsequent discussion if and when oil is found in the neighbourhood of the boundary. The sketch ma throws no light on t is point. Major Longrigg siad that the Company intended to do its best to develop the concession, since the payments to the audi Government were steeply graded, and it would not pay the Company merely to put the concession into cold storage. He agreed that oil experts were often unreliable and mistaken, but he thought that there was a distinct probability of oil being found, particularly in the southern area. The Jaudis had apparently been anxious that the Company should take on the 1 adi sirhen as well, but the Company had come to the conclusion that the prospects of oil were too remote in that area to justify them in extending the conce sion to include it. ^ • ... $ up to I.udawara4* Major Longrigg impressed me more favourably than I had expected. It seems also that he speaks rabic fluently and carried on his negotiations exclusively in that language* He said however that he thought that his Company had been enormously helped in their negotiations by the efforts anu intrigues of the Italians, of which Ibn Baud was profoundly suspicious, so that, as the Italian intrigues increased, he had become the more ready to let the concession go to a British concern. 5. Major ongrigg th ;n turned to the question of the Yemen, on which i. am dictating a separate note. (signed; a. REN DEL. 23rd September, 1936.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 5003/1283/25] Mr. Calvert to Mr. August 7, 1936. Section 1. Copy No. Eden.—(Received August 7.) (No. 207. Confidential.) Sir, Jedda, July 13, 1936. WITH reference to my telegrams Nos. 91 and 94 of the 10th and 12th July respectively, in which I reported the sucfESslul conclusion of lliii neguliRtlUlis between the Saudi Arab Government and the representatives of the Petroleum Concessions (Limited) for an oil concession for the Red Sea coasts of this country, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation of the brief announce ment which appeared in the Mecca newspaper Umm-al-Qura of the 10th July. 2. As you are aware, the negotiations took place at Taif, whither Mr. S. H. Longrigg went on the 28th June. He was accompanied by Mr. Mudarris (who was his colleague in the spring of 1933. when the Iraq Petroleum Company were unsuccessful in bidding for the Hasa Oil Concession) and M. Biraud, of the Societe frangaise des Petroles. The Saudi representatives were Sheikh Abdullah Suleyman, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin and Sheikh Khalid Abul Walid. Sheikh Yusuf apparently delayed his arrival at Taif by several days, so that by the time he put in an appearance the financial clauses had been settled. Mr. Longrigg, whom I saw upon his return to Jedda, related amusingly that both the other negotiators appeared anxious to settle as much as possible before their colleague appeared on the scene, as they knew well his talent for obstructiveness. Discussions continued for nearly two weeks, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin returning to Jedda on the evening of the 10th July, followed next day by Mr. Longrigg and his companions with the Minister of Finance, whose guests (with the exception of M. Biraud) they were until they left Jedda on the 12th July. 3. I had a meeting with the Acting Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs on the morning of the 11th July, when he referred to the satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations. He paid a tribute to the helpfulness shown by Mr. Longrigg, and claimed that the Saudis, too, had not been backward in promoting the final agreement. The most important matter, he said, concerned the question of the “ transfer of ownership ” in the company. This was a somewhat vague state ment, but as I was to see Mr. Longrigg the same afternoon I forbore to cross-examine Sheikh Yusuf on the point. He went on to express his thanks for the assistance afforded by His Majesty’s Government, and, generally, he appeared to be eminently satisfied with the agreement. I acknowledged his thanks and expressed my pleasure at the news. 4. Mr. Longrigg, who had telegraphed from Taif on the 10th July to make an appointment for the following day, called later in the day and gave me fuller particulars of the new agreement. He confirmed that the area of the concession was the whole Red Sea coasts of Saudi Arabia, to a depth of 100 kilom., including the Farsan and other islands and territorial waters, with the exception of the stretch between Rabigh and Lith. The exception is probably due to the Saudi Arab Government’s fear of criticism, in their own country and other parts of the Islamic world, that Ibn Saud is throwing the holy territory of the Hejaz open to the penetration and exploitation of foreigners and infidels. Mr. Longrigg felt no difficulty in accepting this exception, as it is fairly certain, he said, that no oil exists in the excluded area. 5. No difficulty arose, apparently, over the question of nationality of the company, except that the Saudis seemed very concerned to safeguard themselves against the possibility of the transfer of the company, or of any of its constituent members, or of any subsidiary eventually formed to exploit this concession, to a company of any other nationality than those of the Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and its present constituents. The object of this would appear to be to prevent control of the company passing into Italian hands. Mr. Longrigg saw no difficulty in entering into an understanding on this subject, which was [781 g-1]2 embodied in letters duly exchanged, which are not to be published. Ihe letters provide that any such change taking place without the prior consent ot the feaut i Arab Government would render the concession null and void. 6. Mr. Longrigg informed me that a copy of the terms of the concession would be supplied to the Foreign Office on his return to London, so I will content myself with a brief reference to other features of the agreement of inteiest.- (a) £30,000 gold is to be paid in a lump sum after ratification. (b) £7,500 gold per annum is to be paid as rent. ' (c) £150,000 gold per annum is to be paid in royalties two years after the discovery of oil in commercial quantities. (c/) Prospecting rights have been secured for four years, with the option of a fifth. (e) The company has the right to drill for ten years, and if oil is not then found new arrangements to be made. (/) Complete exemption from taxation (except municipal), and exemption from customs dues on all materials, cars, &amp;c., imported. (ft) The right to communicate between northern and southern concessionary areas (excluding the holy areas of Mecca and Medina) is to be provided for in a separate exchange of letters, not to be published. These letters, I understand, remain to be exchanged. (h) A separate agreement will have to be reached on the question of the right to employ aircraft, a matter over which the Saudis at first proved unaccommodating, but later modified their attitude. 7. Mr. Longrigg spent several of the few hours of his stay in Jedda, before leaving for Port Sudan, in inspecting a number of houses in the town with a view to selecting suitable premises for the Jedda office of Petroleum Concessions (Limited). He stated that he expected that a manager would be sent out here m the autumn. . . . ^ , , 8. With regard to ratification, I understand that this is to be eliected, as far as the company is concerned, within twenty days of Mr. Longrigg s arrival in London. Telegraphic notice is then to be given of the fact to the Saudi Arab Government, who would thereupon take appropriate measures heie, infoiming the company to that effect by telegram. The £30,000 gold would then be paid over to the Saudi Government. , , , „ , 9 For the sake of completeness, the share taken by the French repre sentative might be briefly described. M. Biraud, who in any case knew no Arabic, was unwell when he accompanied Mr. Longrigg to Taif. There he became seriously even dangerously, ill, and so took no part in the negotiations. He returned to Jedda on tlm 11th July, but was not well enough to leave with yjp Longrigg and Mr. Mudarris, and I much regret lO say that I leain that he died here suddenly this morning. 1 have, &amp;c.

Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receiot of q 3^ your telegrams No. 58 and No. 60 of June 5th and 6th. relative to the position of various interests in regard to the oronosed Red Sea Oil concession. I do not think it necessary to corwrent hy telegraph on those two telegrams hut, as I shall have left Jedda before Mr. Longrigg arrives, it may he useful to record the following observations. 2. I was aware of the freedom of action as regards the Farsan Islands enjoyed hy the individual grouos comoosing the Iraq Petroleum Comoany and Petroleum Concessions Limited. I attributed to this the fact that the representatives of the Soci£te Frsncaise des ^etooles, who are still here, appeared to he confining themselves to efforts to secure a concession for the Farsans. I am glad to know that they are in fact working in conjunction with their fellow-members of the Iraq Petroleum Company consortium and to have had confirmation of this in a short further conversation with heykh Yusuf Yasin on June 9th, when he told me that the French representatives had informed him that they were t o collaborate with Mr. Longrigg. /3. The Right Honourable Anthony Kden, M.C. , M.?., e Lc. , etc. , etc.16 5. It is ouite conceivable that heykh Yusuf Yasin mentioned the oossibility of Italian comoetition on May 30th. onjy to stimulate the annetite of Petroleum Concessions Limited. I have not heard for some time oast of any soecific Italian interest in oil, whether in the Ped Sea area as a whole or in the Parsen Islands. In any case I think that Ibn ;aud would be very slow for oolitical reasons to grant a concession including either Asir or the Parsans to any Italian grouo, even if he were oushed in that direction by some of his advisers, e. g., ooseibly Fuad Bey Hamza. 4. I have at no time had any local reason to believe that the Standard Oil Comoany of California were seriously interested in the Red Sea area, much le s that they had made orooosals and met with a refusal. I may of course be wrong in this, but on April 22nd their local representative, Mr. Lenahan, told me in incidental conversation that Sheykh Yusuf Yasin had sooken to him with the object of enlisting the interest of the Company and gave me to understand that his answer had been non-committal. His comoany, he told me, were not at present interested in the Fed : 'ea area, although he did not know that that would always be the case. He added, as regeras the northern portion of the area, that after their expert, &gt;r. N )mland, had visited it in March-April, 1934, the Company had ruled it out f, one hundred per cent’*. 5. Before receiving your telegrams under reference, I had already spoken to dheykh Yusuf Yasin on the general lines of the first portion of paragraph 6 of your telegram V o. 58 of June 8th and, without positively advocating the grant of a concession to Petroleum Concessions Limited, had /made■ made it clear to him that they were veryfevourably regarded by HIb Wajesty’s Government (See in particular orragrauh 3 of the enclosure in my printed despatch No. 153 of May 22nd). 6. I feel bound to place on record my misgivings as to the effect on future negotiations of the tactics followed so far by Petroleum Concessions Limited. It is to my mind unfortunate that, as a result of the simple faith which they reposed first in Mr. Ydlibi and then in Colonel Etherton, they created a situation here in which two gentlemen, both acting in the Company’s ultimate interest, presented an appearance of competing with each other. The position as between the Company and the French group has now been cleared up, but until a few days ago they had the appearance of being in competition as regards the Farsan Islands, which have been the sole objective of the French but which were to have been included in the concession for which Mr. Ydlibi and Colonel Etherton were negotiating. I fear that, as a result of these preliminaries, the Eaudi Government will approach their negotiations with Mr. Longrigg with an exaggerated idea of the value of what they have to offer and will open their mouths not less wide than they did with Colonel Etherton, who was, so far as I know, the competitor most inclined to concede extravagant demands. 7. I need only add that in my last conversation with Sheykh Yusuf Yasin on June 9th, he gave me brief particulars of further correspondence between Mr. Longrigg and the Minister of Finance. Mr. Longrigg had sent the Minister a copy of a letter to the Saudi Minister in London clearing up the position of his company as regards Mr.Ydlibi and Colonel Etherton and had written him direct about the company’s ideas. He had in a further telegram proposed a basis of discussion and had been given a non committal reply. The Minister of Finance had intimated that most of the proposals appeared satisfactory hut that he would discuss the whole subject on Mr. Longrigg’s arrival.

Communication made yesterday. Yusuf Yasin who thanked His Majesty's Government enquired whether secret and political, as well as commercial, information could he given Longrigg as it must be remembered that he had French associates here. I confined myself to repeating assurance as follows and he left it at that. 2. Yusuf Yasin enquired v/hether Longrigg would communicate from Taif direct with his principals or through me. He asked because he anticipated serious difficulty of a political nature, might arise which might necessitate .ongrigg consulting me. I said that Longrigg would dislike to communicate direct with the company though I would be interested to hear how negotiations may be progressing. 5. Italian Minister had yesterday morning asked for a reply to his question. Yusuf Yasin had told him that Minister of Finance could not give a definite answer until it could be seen v/hether an agreement could be reached with Longrigg with whom there had been previous discussions. 4. Yusuf Yasin would also go to Taif but would return after two or three days. 5. As difficulty alluded.to in paragraph 2 probably related to that described in my telegram No. 84 I have discussed the matter further with Longrigg and shown him Saudi regulations on registrationregistration of companies (see Bird's despatch no. 120 of August Srd 1928 , also my despatch Ao. 246 of August 6th 1954 ). The nature of Orudis' demand remains to he seen. If formality of registration only is intended this might he unoojectionahle, but if Baudis' insistence on comoany adapting Saudi nationality a very different question would arise and one difficult, if not pmpossible, to accent. If Saudis' aesire is to set up s subsidiary to the como&amp;ny, which would disarm criticism it nay be worth considering whether a company could he formed in the Sudan, India or Agypt.

He informed me that Italian Minister had now spoken to him concerning oil, referring to Long’s visit and requesting that 6audi-Arabian Government should defer grant of con cession until Italian interests had had time to come forward. Italian Minister had declared that their main object was concession for E'arsan Islands only and thought Italian terms would be more favourable than others. 2. Yusuf emphasised to me importance of allusion to Farsan and said that his reply which was designed to discourage Italian Minister from pursuing the question was to the effect that Italians were very late in entering the field as negotiations between Long and Minister of Finance had been almost completed having been in progress for some three months. Italian Minister had rejoined that on the contrary he understood that negotiations had not gone very far. 5. Yusuf professed to me to be much embarrassed. He referred to Italian ambitions in the Red 8ea and affirmed that the object of his reply had been to '’’close the door'’ to them. He was aware of His Majesty's Government's general ... 4 .2. general policy of abstaining fron actively identifying then- selves with British commercial concerns but present question was important politically as well as economically. He considered, early agreement with Petroleum Concessions Ltd. was now desirable and hoped that His majesty's Government would promote it. 5. Yusuf stated more categorically than before that daudi-Arabian Government had definitely decided not to give concession to an Italian company but at the sane time they desired to maintain relations of customary courtesy. It was therefore essential for baudis to be able to give Italians reasonable grounds for inability to give them concession. 6. Yusuf further said he was not sure (aj of extent of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. enjoyed support of His majesty's Government and (b) how far Saudis could go in confiding matters of a secret nature to Long. He therefore wished to consult me on these points and also as to pretexts for refusal which I thought Saudis would be best advised to give the Italians. 7. I thanked Yusuf and reminded him that on June 9th Sir a. Ryan informed him that His Majesty's Government were favourably disposed 'cowards the Company. as for other and more difficult questions I could only speak personally but described Long as a responsible person holding a responsible position and hinted that question of degree confidence Saudis should repose in him was for them to decide. as to Yusuf's pretexts to Italian Minister I could not offer any better cgrp. omtd.] on the spur of the moment. 8. Yusuf suggested I should see Long as soon as possible and get him to fall into line in pretending that negotiations were far advanced He also asked me to appeal to . o •5. to Long to make his terms generous as naudis might have secured Letter conditions from Italians. His personal idea was that negotiations should take place at i’aif as heing remoter from the Itali.an Legation. 9„ I was guarded with Yusuf as latter’s move may he manoeuvre to bounce Petroleum Concessions Ltd. at the outset of Long's visit hut my general impression was that Landis are in a genuine difficulty. 1 propose to see Long soon after arrival tomorrow hut would he grateful for early instructions as to reply to Yusuf.■4 INDEXED ,te I** \ A O (, i i'- ^ a In any further communication on this subject, please quote 2 i . / No. address —not to any person b\ Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1 i \ .

OF PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED, WHO WAS ACCOI.IPAj.TIED BY MAJOR LONGRIGG, AND MR. RENDEL. Mr. Skliros briefly recapitulated the arrangements pre viously made by Petroleum Concessions Limited with both Mr. Abdulgani Ydlibi and Colonel Etherton in regard to any concession which either individual might be able to obtain from the Saudi Government for oil on the Saudi Arabian Red Sea coast. 2. He said that despite definite statements made by both persons from time to time that they had actually obtained a concession, nothing had in fact materialised, and finally, while still prepared to take over on terms offered any concession that Colonel Etherton might still have been able to obtain, the Company had decided to send their own representative out to Jedda to negotiate direct, and Major Longrigg was consequently leaving London on Friday next, June 12th, and was due to arrive at Jedda on June 24th. Major Longrigg had so informed the Saudi Minister of Finance. 3. Mr.Skliros then explained that the Compagnie Frangaise des Pdtroles had their representative, M. Biraud, in Jedda now, and that as the French company was a constituent partner in the I.P.C. there was no question of that company acting in competition with P.C.L. As soon as Major Longrigg arrived in Jedda, he would establish contact with M. Biraud and would act in concert with him. The French company had in fact offered to withdraw as regards the negotiations affecting the mainland. 4. As regards the Farsan Islands, which lay outside the Red Line Agreement, the position was, as far as P.C.L. were concerned, that if the Saudis were prepared to include the Islands/Islands in any concession regarding the mainland, well and g^od, hut the company was not prepared to incur additional and separate expenditure or obligations for a separate concession for these Islands, and were quite agreeable to the French company making a separate arrangement as regards those Islands, which, in his opinion, did not offer any prospects of oil, 5. Mr. Rendel mentioned that according to a telegram received from Sir Andrew Ryan (Jedda telegram No.76,E 3147/1283/ 25) the Saudis were apparently under the impression that the French company and P.C.L. were rivals in the field, and were apparently inclined to wish to play one off against the other, anc he suggested that it would be advisable for Major Longrigg to get out to Jedda as soon as he could. He said he would explain the situation to Sir Andrew Ryan and advise him of Major Longrigg ! s probable date of arrival. As Sir Andrew will have left Jedda before Major Longrigg’s arrival, the latter was advised to get in touch on his arrival at Jedda with Mr.Calvert, who would be asked to afford him all proper assistance. 6. Mr.Skliros said that P.C.L. were going to offer good terms to the Saudis, and intended to make a more determined effort to obtain a concession than had been the case in the Hasa negotiations. He did not fear any competition, although he understood that the Standard Oil of California were not dis interested. 7. Mr. Rendel expressed the hope that P.C.L. would be successful, as the presence of a completely non-British concern in that part of the world would unquestionably be inconvenient. 8. He mentioned the fear expressed by Yusuf Yassin to Sir Andrew Ryan about a possible incursion of Italian oil interests into that area, but Mr. Skliros expressed the opinion that/r that this possibility was very remote. The Italians were ,r broke ,, and could not possibly raise the money necessary to compete with the terms which P. C.L. were prepared to offer. He added that the Italians were of course prospecting in the region of Massawa. 9. The rest of the conversation turned on the situation in the Persian Gulf and the Koweit Neutral Zone, and has been recorded separately. (Sgd.) E. Brenan.

For your own information. 1. French group is one of consistuent groups of Iraq Petroleum Company (with which hetroleum Concessions -Limited is identical? except for absence ol Iraqi Director;, and in •view of so-called ,! Red Line” agreement of 1928? it could not acquire concession within Red Line area except on behalf of whole combine. There is therefore according to Petroleum Concessions Limited no rivalry between them and French group, and they are in fact stated to be working in close cooperation. 2. Petroleum Concessions consider serious Italian competition unlikely for financial reasons, but admit possibility of embarrassing competition from standard Uil of California (California-Arabian Oil Company). They understand however that Ibn Baud has already refused latter s proposals. 5. As regards Farsan Islands? which are outside ned Line agreement, so that French group could acquire concessions there for themselves without violating agreement, retroleum Concessions Limited, who are aware of French activities, state that they consider it so unlikely that islands contain oil ir commercial quantities that they do not wish0 ^ Vi 2 , v;ish to compete for concession and are indifferent as to who acquires it* % In these circumst.nices they see no reason /to advance derc.rture of Longrigg, who should accoruing to present arrangements arrive in Jedda on June 24th. He has been adviseu. to keep in touch with Jr. Calvert, who should give him all suitable and proper assistance. a. In view of Red Line agreement and owing to small number of serious British oil concerns it would be imprac ticable ±or purely British group to acquire concession and oest solution irom point of view of his majesty's Government would therefore be that concession should go to Petroleum woncessions Limited, who at least are British Company and contain important British interests.JMivltDIAT —1TT7 - / In any further communioution on this subject, please quote and address —not to any person /J&amp;JJ/zA r “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Oflice, T&gt;ondon, S.W.

Yusuf Yasin spoke to me confidentially yesterday about Red Sea oil concession. He expressed as usual the icing's preference for dealing vvith British companies. He referred particularly to Ydlibi, Htherton and the French group interested in Farsan Island. Representatives of the latter have been here since hay 2nd and were introduced and recommended by the irenoh Minister. 2. Yusuf Yasin seemed to be suggesting that if I could hold out firm prospect of concession being taken up by a British con cern negotiations with the French would not be [gr.undec.]. I said that so far as I knew no exclusively British concern was in terested but that Petroleum Concessions Limited were very much interested. They were a reputable British company representing the same international interests as the Iraq. Petroleum Company and they were favourably regarded by His Majesty’s Government. Both Ydlibi and Htherton were in touch with them and had, I under stood, kept them informed of their negotiations here. I naturally refused to say that the company would necessarily take up the concession. 5. Yusuf Yasin then told me that the Minister of Finance had received only that morning a telegram from Longrigg promising detailed statement by post and proposing to send out a represen tative of the company. It was intended to welcome this proposal and ask that representative should come as soon as possible. French proposal'would be looked into in the meantime.t..J « r~ | 3276 i 19 36 NO DlbTRIBUT ION.

To secure the latter point, we passed to Captain Ftherton a coy of the draft concession prepared for Ydlibi* a use. This was sent to Colonel Atherton who has now received it. 4.

In the meantime, and during the 10 days, he would do nothing to further any activity by M*. Ydlibl. 2.

Saudi Arabian Red Sea Littoral. Mr. Skliroe, of the Iraq Petrolaum Com any* oame to see me this morning to keep me informed, he said, of recent developments regarding hie Company’s attempts to secure an oil concession over the Red Sea area of Saudi /Arabia. 8. It appears that although *{r. Ydlibi had continued to express the utmost confidence in his ability to secure this concession, Mr. Janson had recently given Mr. rkliros reason to believe that Mr. Ydlibi las by no means in bo favourable a position to secure the concession as he had represented. It now seemed, in fact, very doubtful whether *,r. Ydlibi would have any succeed at all, although the I.P.C. were etill prepared to acquire the concession through him if he should after all be able to obtain it. S. Meanwhile Mr. Skliroe had had a visit from a Ca :&gt;tain therton, a brother of the Colonel tnerton who recently went out to Arabia ostensibly in connexion with ,vr. Philby’s plans for a transport monopoly. Captain Ptherton had explained that hie brother had now actually acquired the oil concession in question and was ready and even anxious to sell it to the I. \C. Mr. Skliros had replied that he would be very glad to buy the concession, provided its terms were satisfactory. It had then turned out that no concession existed at all, but that Colonel therton had telegraphed to the effect that he had 'a firm promise** of one from King Ibn Saud. Meanwhile Colonel therton was anxious to come to an arrangement with the I.P.C. by which the Company should bind itself to buy the concession from him, and,and, by implication, not to obtain it through anyone else* As Ml** fklii’os pointed out the effect of thie vould be to give Colonel therton a strong claim for damages if the I.P.C. eventually acquired this concession, not through Ha, but through .vi r « Ydlibi* kr# BJcliros was in any case very doubtful as to Colonel therton's ability to secure the concession, particularly as a report had reached him during the last few days to the effect that Colonel therton had quarrelled with kr. hilby (apparently over the division of the proceeds of their various joint ventures) so that Colonel &gt; therton 1 s position with King Ibn Saud might well orove to have been considerably shaken. 4. &gt;n vie* of all this ir. fkliroe was contemplating sending out a special representative on behalf of the I. .c. themselves and he had induced Major Longrigg, who had previously acted for the Company at the time of the original negotiations with fbn Saud for the grant of the Hasa Coast concession, to rejoin the Company and to undertake the negotiations if required to do so. Mr. Skliros admitted that Major Longrlgg had not been very successful on the last occasion when he conducted negotiations at Jedda, but he considered that this was entirely due to the very severe limitations imposed upon him by the instructions which the Company had - notwithstanding Mr. Skliros* own advice to the contrary - imposed upon him. 6. As I was very pressed for time, I did not discuss these questions further with Mr. Skliros, but it was arranged that he should call again on Monday, April 20th /atat Midday to give &lt;ae any further information. 6. Mr. Bkliroe also raised the question of the possible oil concession in the Koweit Neutral Zone, but I am recording this part of the conversation separately.

Your despatch No. 64. I saw Ydlibi this morning: he expects to leave April 17th. 2 . He speaks with the utmost confidence of obtaining tomorrow concession for the whole of the Red Sea littoral in the shape of four years option with definite promise of concession if the petroleum concessionaires [grp. undec,] wish to take it up. This astonishes me as Colonel Etherton also seems to be after this concession and Fuad told me March 30th that representative of some French group has expected to visit Farsan Island in connexion with oil. On the other hand Ydlibi though always optimistic has never been quite so categorical as he has promised to inform me when concession has been signed. 3 . I do not think any oil concession for whole or part of Red Sea littoral could clash with concession of Saudi Arabia Mining Syndicate which is limited to metals and expressly excludes oil.3./ Saudi Arai)ian(Red Sea Area) Proposed Oil Concession. Mr. Skliros* of Petroleum Concessions Limited (the new subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company) called on me this evening to discuss th,s question. 2. He feegan by explaining that Mr. Jansen /who is well-known to us in connexion with the last moment competition which arose over the Koweit Oil Company’s concession in Koweit7 Mr. tdlibi /who is also well-known to ua in connexion with uad Bey Hauls’s conversations with us in September* 1934* over the Koweit Neutral Zone? had come to Petroleum Concessions Limited and offered to sell them a concession for oil development over the whole Red Lea area of Saudi Arabia from Transjordan to the Yemen. Mr. Skliros had asked whether they actually held this concession, and they had explained that they had a definite promise of it from King Ibn Saud. They alleged that the King had been under an obligation to Mr. Ydlibi in connexion with some previous loan or similar trans action, and that His Majesty had originally proposed to liquidate this obligation by giving Ydlibi a concession, insofar as h s own rights were concerned, over the Koweit Neutral Zone. The King had found, L. 'u^yws.i/V' however, that he was already com*itted^to the standard Oil Company of California, and it had therefore now been proposed that the obligation should be liquidated by the grant to Mr. Ydlibi and his associates of the present concession over the Red Sea area.warn •?i 3. Mr. Jansen had told Mr. Skliros that Xhn Snud had virtually screed to an arrangement hy which the concessionnairee should hold an option tor i'mur years for a payment of five thousand pounds golu per annum. During that period prospecting would he carrieo out. If no oil were found the option would he surrenderee, hut if oil wer^ found, a concession would oe granted corresponding to the concession held by the Standard Oil of California on the Hasa coast, i.e. royalties would he payable at the rate of four shillings gold per ton, the Company would undertake to drill ten thousand feet in the first ten years and twenty thousand feet in the next ten years, and would enjoy exemption from taxation, the right to build harbours etc. Ibn Baud would, however, retain the right to grant other concessions to other companies, who would in turn possess the right to build pipe lines across the territory granted by the present concession. 4. Mr. Skliros, who had, I gathex&gt; been eonct rned in formulating these terms, was prepared to buy the option and concession^ir they corresponded to thee terms^for a cash payment of twenty thousand pounds sterling cash down, and another twenty thousand pounds sterling if and when the definite concession was taken up at the end of four years when the option expired. Re was only prepared to do this, however, if hr. Ydlibi and hie associates really held a promise from Ibn Baud, or were in a specially favourable position to secure the concession. If this was not the case he would much rather deal with Ibn Baud direct and not have to purchase the concession from an intermediary. 5. Mr. Skliros was, in fact, increasingly doubtful whether/7^ 3. whether Mr. Ydlihi and Mr. Jansen were realty in a position to rt deliver the goode% and his douhts had 'been increased fcy their recent 'behaviour*. They had now arranged with the Saudi I’inieter in L ndon for the whole matter to he put h telegraph to the Saudi Minister for Finance, who had in turn promised to refer it immediately to King Ihri oauu, hut no reply had yet arrived. 6. Mr. Jansen hod now told Mr. Skliros that he understood that His Majesty’s Government had obtained an undertaking from the United States Government that no United States oil companies would in future he allowed to compete with British oil companies in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea areas. He had explained to Mr. Skliros that if this could he confirmed and King Ibn Saud could he informed accordingly, it would greatly facilitate the grant of the proposed concession. Mr. Sfcliros found it hard to believe that any such undertaking existed, hut had felt 7, I decided that there was no reason why 1 should hesitate to tell Mr. Skliros quite definitely that no such undertaking existed. Indeed, such an idea would clearly not he practical politics at all. Mr. Skliros agreed, hut^said that he thought that Mr. Ydlibi must have invented the whole suggestion and that this made him more doubtful than ever whether there would he any advantage in his Company trying to deal through these people. 8. Mr. Skliros wns clearly under no misapprehensions as/7 h. as to the attitude of Hie Maje ty^e Gov* rmaent. He realised that we could not influence any foreign government in the direction of granting a concession to any particular company or assume any responsibility towards either the government or the company concerned in connexion with the grant of a concession. He equally realised, however, that we should, in principle, welcome the grant of a concession to a British rather than to a foreign company, and that our attitude t owarde Petroleum Concessions Limited was therefore a benevolent ^ _ one. 9. Finally Mr. Skliros explained that he was placed in a position of considerable difficulty as Mr. Ydlibi now insisted on leaving on March 7th for Arabia and wished to have a definite reply from Petroleum Concessions Limited before that date. Much would there foi* depend on the reply which Sheikh Hafiz Wahba might receive to hie latest telegram, as this would clear up the attitude of the King towards the Ydlibi Jansen group. One further difficulty was that Petroleum Concessions Limited had no suitable men of their own to entrust with these negotiations at this moment, their representa tives already being fully occupied in connexion with the other negotiations they were carrying on in the Persian Gulf. 10. Meanwhile I took the opportunity to suggest to Mr. Skliros that he should make sure that there wna no question of any conflict between any concession which hie company might acquire ana the mining concession already granted by the Saudi Government to the Saudi Arabian/</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002af_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2149</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002af</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2149</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 6/76 'Saudi Arabia: Oil concessions over the Red Sea littoral.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1936/1937</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-05-22T11:30:06</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (77 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 78; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file primarily relates to oil concessions in Saudi Arabia along the Red Sea coast.
