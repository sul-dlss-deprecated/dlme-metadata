I J \ I forward herewith a copy of a letter which I wrote to V.eightman some time ago on the subject of the appointment of Residency Surgeon. I have received no comments on it. fs' possible you may wish to discuss the matter when I come to London.

I am sending a copy of this A, ^ letter without its enclosure to Crichton. /Oh %D .0.;.o.C/3C2. ' Office of the ^'Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain, the 27th June, 1946. Please refer to paragraph 5 of Residency telegram N o.T/291 dated the 22nd June 1946. 2. A considerable time ago.Prior asked me whether I agreed to Greenway’s being given an extension as Residency Surgeon up to the end of February 1947 and I replied in the affirmative. This if I remember rightly was before anything had been said about the transfer of the Residency from Bushlre. I have not got the papers here but I believe that the Government of India sanctioned an extension accordingly. 3. With the transfer of the Residency to Bahrain I consider it most important that we should have a competent I.M.S. officer as Residency Su rgeo n. Communications are good and the Residency Surgeon can tour frequently. There is a great deal to be done especially on the Trucial Coast where the building of a hospital at Dubai has been pending for some years owing to the absence of somebody with sufficient time and technical knowledge to give proper attention to its construction. In Bahrain itself there is ' ample work to keep an I.M.S. officer busy although the State has its own medical staff. The Civil Surgeon at present in addition to looking after the Civil Hospital which is well attended and treating Government employees is Quarantine Medical Officer and is also appointed to attend the very considerable staff of the B.O.A.C. and Cable and Wireless. As Quarantine Medical Officer he isof shipping (principally tanker 9 i)rcalling at Bahrain. v. -' f He is called upon not only to do the technical quarantine work but to attend members of the crews. If therefore an I.f.S. officer is appointed as Residency Surgeon I consider that he should also be Civil Surgeon Bahrain and that he should have a medical officer of the status of Assistant Surgeon to hold the appointment of Quarantine Tvledical Office and assist him generally. 4. If a suitable I.I'.S. officer can be made avail able before the expiry of Greenway's appointment possibly suitable employment could be found for the latter in India. Otherwise I would suggest that Greenway snould remain in Bushire at an} rate until the autumn. He holds the rank of Vice-Consul and his work is mostly local in character especially at this time of the year, l.hen the autumn comes I will see if it is possible to accommodate him at Bahrain. This may be difficult if he still has his wife with him but he might perhaps be persuaded to send his wife to India for a few months before he is due to retire. 5. If an I.M.S. officer is appointed as Residency Surgeon who is either a bachelor or does not wish to bring his family here I think I can fit him in somewhere at Jufair for the time being.. In due course we shall either have to build or rent a separate house for the Residency Surgeon.INDIA cm&lt;3 ^HITiSHAlX, S.W.l. 13th April 1931 ^ould you kindly refer to Acheson 1 8 d.o. letter of 5th February, No.D*89 M/31, about the strength of the Medical Establishment at Bushire, I now enclose a copy of d.o. correspondence with the Foreign Office, frorr which you will see that after consultation with Buahire they agree that the medical staff at Bushire should not be reduced below two.

Z. 1072/51) regarding medical arrangements at Bushire. We agree that the medical staff should not be reduced below two, and the Treasury, whom we have consulted semi-officially, also agree. Yours sincerely, j. G. Laithwaite, Esq.O.Ino. ^2-3 oi' 1921 • britisn .iesiaency, iiusiiire, tue 9 tn January 1921 My dear ilowell, 7/ill you please refer to 7a It on 1 s demi-official letter Ho.P.8520/30, dated the 18th Hecenter 1930 to you, regarding tne medical estatlisniiient at Bushire. At present tnere are here one Residency Surgeon ana two Assistant Surgeons of tne Indian medical Department one of tnese however is employed ty t ie Indo-Buropean Telegraph Department to look after tneir own people and has nothing to do with tne Residency Surgeon or with me. I understood from the representative of tne Imperial and International Communications Company wno visited Bushi^e recently that they had no intention of keeping mm on for tne reduced esta'clisnment wmcn tixey propose to maintain nere and therefore he will presumaciy go on tne 1st march. The Imperial and Int ernational Commuiii cat ions .Company are anxious that tne Residency Surgeon should taxe charge of tne Telegraph establishment that will be maintained for the cables. There will then remain tne Residency Surgeon and one Assistant Surgeon. Tne Residency Surgeon is not merely m charge of tne local work but also in charge of ail medical establishments in tne Gulf, and responsible for tne general supervision of the quarantine arrangements and the charitable dispensaries at Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat. It is desirable that he should visit tne Gulf ports at least once4 once a year, and, owing to the slowness of coimaunicat i ons, this involves considerable absences from Busmre, and during such absences it is, in ny opinion, essential to nave so^e one in nedical cnarge here. Again, it is true tn=*t tne cnaritable ais^ensary has been shut down, but the Residency dispensary has not been shut down and does to all intents and purposes the satue work as was formerly done at tne so-called charitable dispensary. 3ymons tells me that tne attendance last y*ar was acout twenty tnousand. It will tnerefore be seen that tnere is plenty of work cotn for tne Residency 3urgeon ana for one Assistant surgeon. Finally, as Symons points out to me, there is a great deal of sickness at Busnire, ana during tne last year the Assistant Surgeon has had somewhat protracted goes of malaria three times, while ne himself nad been laid up witn malaria twice. lor tne a cove reasons it would, 1 tnink, be very difficult for tiie Residency Surgeon to carry on tne work single handed ana it would mean tnat ne could never visit any of the Gulf ports or supervise the medical ana quarantine arrangements at tnem, and X therefore hope that tne Government of India will agree to tne retention of one assistant Surgeon.

If the draft is approved, I will let the Forei Ice know after it has issue ■gn id th at we are making enouiry of the Government of India. n g b[c19 5 0 S' I enclose copy of a demi- official letter from the Foreign Office about the size of the medical establishment at Bushire. We should be grateful for the advice of the Government of India as to the reply to be given. As we understand the position, there is at present at Bushire one Residency Surgeon and two Assistant Surgeons of the I.M.D. Of the latter, one appears to be employed in connection with the I.E.T.D., and the desirability of retaining his appointment will no doubt come up for consideration in connection with the withdrawal of the Department from Persia. I am sending a copy of this letter and its enclosure to Biscoe Vours sincerely, v WALTQ^(K 13985/1844/2.34) Trickett has, he tells me, spoken to you about our misgivings as to the size ot the medical estaolishment at Bushire. We recognise that there has been a reduction of the staff by one junior assistant surgeon, following on the handing over of the quarantine to Persia and withdrawal from the Charitable Hospital (India Oflice letter p 327l/«3G of May 30th last), but^in view of the reduction of work which must have followed those happenings,it is not evident to us that there is a need for more than one medical officer at Bushire. We should be very grateful, if you see no objection, for your help in bringing this point to the notice of the Government of India, and letting us know their views when received. Yoars sincerely, J.G. laithwaite. Esq.From the Foreign and Political Department List it appears that the medical staff at Bushire is at present - (a) Residency Surgeon (and £x officio Vice-Consul, Bushire) - Major H.J.H. Symons, who receives special allowances as Residency Surgeon, Chief Quarantine Medical Officer, and for medical attendance on the staff of the I.E.T.D. and their families; (b) 1 Military Assistant Surgeon (G. Burning), Military Officer i/c Telegraph Establishment at Bushire; (c) 1 Military Assistant Surgeon (ILL.A. Steele), Medical Officer in sub-charge cf the Residency Dispensary, Bushire. also maintained in connection with the Charitable Hospital in Bushire and the quarantine arrangements. Consequent on the handing over of the latter to Persian doctors and the withdrawal of the Indian Government medical staff from the former, his post was abolished with effect from that date. Military Assistant Surgeon maintained in connection with the staff of that Department will presumably disappear, and, in view of the fact that the handing over of the Charitable Hospital to the Persian Government appears to have thrown a greater burden on the Residency Dispensary, and to have necessitated the re-establishment of what is described in as 'a small hospital in the town', 'in order to meet the needs of the Residency staff and the British community', a staff of one commissioned officer and one Assistant Surgeon will presumably not be considered excessive. But we are not in a position here to assess the case for the present staff or the strength at which it ought in future to be maintained, and as the Treasury are disposed to suggest demi- With the disappearance of the I.E.T.D., the Government of India letter officially/officially that it is on a wholly extravagant scale, it will perhaps be better to ask the Government of India to consider the matter.
