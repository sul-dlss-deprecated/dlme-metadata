ARAB SIDE. General. —In the Review of the Administration Report for 1937 a summary was given of the changes which had recently come about on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf, and this summary may well be repeated :— ' During the comparatively short period of 10 years, from the com munications point of view the Gulf has changed from a cul-de- sac to an highway between East and West; from the resources point of view the discovery of oil in an area under our control is of considerable strategical importance ; while from the inter national point of view the relations of the Arab Shaikhdoms with their neighbours have increased considerably in importance and complexity.' During the year under review the Arab side has continued to increase in importance. Imperial Airways have multiplied their services to five a week ; oil has been found at Kuwait with the prospect of a large oil field there which may in time rival Bahrain ; in Saudi Arabian territory in Hasa, opposite Bahrain, the California Arabian Standard Oil Company have struck oil and are shipping some of it to Bahrain for refining ; and in connection with this oil field the Saudi Arabian Government are developing the port of Ras Tanura. From the international point of view the relations of the Arab Shaikhdoms with their neighbours show no signs of decreasing in importance. Plans for the defence of the Arab States and of British interests there in the event of an emergency have been under consideration. The international crisis in September made a profound impression on the Rulers of the Arab States, and both they and their peoples are only too anxious to co-operate with His Majesty's Government in defence measures. A new and significant development in the Arab States is the growth of a demand from the Rulers by their peoples for more democratic forms of govern ment. At Kuwait and Dibai the final results of this have been the formation of nominated Advisory Councils. At Bahrain there has been some agitation, but of a less serious and widespread character (see under Kuwait, Bahrain and Trucial Coast below). To meet anti-British propaganda from various sources the British Broad casting Corporation commenced daily Arabic broadcasts giving an accurate and objective account of the news of the day as well as cultural items and entertainment, music, etc. Committees were formed by the Political Agents in the Arab States of the Gulf to make suggestions in regard to popularising these broadcasts. Many of these suggestions were adopted by the British Broadcasting Corporation and the service is much appreciated. As there are no newspapers published in the Arab States the supply of accurate news by the broadcasts has been extremely useful, and they fulfil efficiently their purpose of counteracting foreign propaganda. During the crisis of September last the broadcasts had a steadying effect on local public opinion in the States, The number of receiving sets in the States has rapidly increased during the last year and besides private sets they are also installed in the coffee houses. Royal Navy, —The sloops of the Persian Gulf Division continued their useful duties in the Persian Gulf, and frequently transported the Political Resident and Political Officers under him on their tours. Aviation. —The Royal Air Force continued to maintain the air route on the Arab Coast. They made numerous routine Flights, and, on request, carried Political Officers on their duties. The Shaikh of Bahrain gave his consent to the location of a Royal Air Force Flight at Bahrain, 23 (s) ead( a ) In order to increase the facilities on the Aden-Muscat air route, in March a Royal Air Force party accompanied by the Political Agent, Muscat, pro ceeded to a point on it in a sloop provided by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gull Division. The purpose of the visit was successfully carried out and this important route may now be considered to have been established. The Imperial Airways services under the Empire Air Mail Service were increased from four to five a week. Fresh Civil Air Agreements were entered into with the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Dibai. The civil air base in Muscat territory at Gwadur was for techni cal reasons transferred in May to Jiunri in Kalat State, and the Muscat Civil Air Agreement was therefore not renewed. Plans had been made that in the case of internal trouble at Dibai, which appeared not unlikely, for Imperial Airways, in co-operation with the Royal Air Force, to use Ras al Khaimah instead as a refuelling stop. One such occasion arose (see under Trucial Coast below). Oil Interests. —Petroleum Concessions Limited who had in 1937 obtained two concessions covering the territory of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, commenced exploration by air, with their own aeroplane, and on land Aerial surveys were made of various parts of the Sultan's territory, including the province of Dhofar. On land, after considerable negotiations by the Political Authorities with the local Shaikhs concerned. Petroleum Concessions Limited's parties from Muscat and from the Trucial Coast penetrated into Baraimi, a convenient centre for the exploration of possible oil bearing areas in the Trucial Coast hinterland. The parties met with a certain amount of obstruc tion and little actual exploration could be carried out. Nevertheless no untoward incidents occurred, personal contacts were established with the local petty Shaikhs, generally speaking the ice may be said to have been broken, and when the explorations are renewed next winter there is a reason able prospect of their being more successful. Negotiations for an oil concession at Gwadur, in Muscat territory, were begun with the Sultan by rival companies, the Burmah Oil Company and Indian Oil Concessions Limited, the latter representing the Standard Oil Company of California as well as Indian interests. These negotiations were in progress at the end of the year. On the Trucial Coast Petroleum Concessions Limited, who had after prolonged negotiations secured concessions from the Shaikhs of Dibai and Sharjah, continued their negotiations with the remaining Shaikhs and by the end of the year had obtained either concessions or options from the latter.. In view of the interest displayed by the Standard Oil Company of California in the Trucial Coast area, this is satisfactory. In Qatar drilling operations continued but oil had not been struck by tho end of the year. At Bahrain the Bahrain Petroleum Company, who had completed the construction of their refinery in 1937, continued to expand. The production for the last four years is as follows in tons of oil:— 1935 ■ 176,388 1936 . . . 509,600 1937 1,061,347 1938 1,185,428 total personnel of the Company for the last four years is as follows :— 1935. 1936. 1937. 1938. Americans * • 49 153 126 90 European British subjects . 26 157 308 224 Indian British subjects 61 323 214 422 Bahrainis • «. 1,283 3,747 3,304 1,596. ['Iranians. Others ■&lt; Iraqis. ^ . 244 658 688 286 [^Kuwaitis etc, J Total 1,663 5,038 4,640 2,61&amp;( iii ) The increase in the personnel employed in 1936-37 is explained by the fact that during the two former years the refinery and a large construction programme was in progress. During the latter part of the year the Bahrain Petroleum Company carried out the important development of refining in Bahrain oil from Hasa. During the latter half of the year the Bahrain Petroleum Company and their rivals, Petroleum Concessions Limited, resumed negotiations with the Shaikh for the ' Unallotted Area i.e. the area in Bahrain territory not covered by the Bahrain Petroleum Company's present concession. Negotia tions were in progress at the end of the year. At Kuwait early in the year the Kuwait Oil Company found oil in quan tities which indicated the presence of a large field. Later in the year oil was struck in a second well, and though oil has not been found in commercially exploitable quantities there is every hope that this object will shortly be achieved. In Hasa early in the year the California Arabian Standard Oil Company struck oil, and by the end of the year were sending oil to Bahrain for refining. Medical. —Throughout the year excellent work continued to be carried out in the dispensary at Kuwait and the hospitals at Bahrain and Muscat. These institutions are attached to the Political Agencies, are maintained by the Government of India, and are in charge of Assistant Surgeons of the Indian Medical Department, who are also the State Quarantine Medical Officers. In addition to the humanitarian aspect of these institutions they have a valu able political effect in influencing local public opinion in our favour. They are under the administrative control of the Residency Surgeon, Bushire, who, for international purposes, is Chief Quarantine Medical Officer for the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. A new dispensary at Dibai, on the Trucial Coast, under the charge of a Sub-Assistant Surgeon of the Indian Medical Depart ment was sanctioned at the end of the year. Kuwait. —No advance was made during the year towards the settlement of the difficult question of the Shaikh of Kuwait's date gardens in Iraq. One case of incursion by Iraqi police cars into Kuwait territory occurred in June. No satisfaction was forthcoming from the Iraqi Government in reply to the protest made regarding this incident. The Saudi trade blockade of Kuwait continued throughout the year. Towards the end of the year, however, the Saudi Government displayed a more reasonable attitude in the negotiations which were proceeding between them and His Majesty's Government on the subject, and there were distinct hopes that this difficult question might soon be settled. The year under review saw an outbreak of agitation by the people of Kuwait against the Shaikh for a more democratic form of government. The Shaikh, contrary to Arab traditions, and to his promise to his people on his accession that he would have a nominated Advisory Council, as had existed in the days of the great Shaikh Mubarak, had administered the State purely on autocratic lines, without even consulting his own family. In October, after an outbreak of local agitation which the Shaikh succeeded in suppressing temporarily, His Majesty's Government advised the Shaikh that he would be wise to associate his people with himself in the administration of his State by the formation of an Advisory Council. The Shaikh did not take this advice and as the result of a strong popular movement, to which the Shaikh yielded, an Executive Council was elected, which drew up a Constitution for the State depriving the Shaikh of much of his power. A communication was, however, made by His Majesty's Government to the Shaikh and the Council that by virtue of the former's treaties with His Majesty's Government the conduct of foreign affairs of the State would continue to remain in their hands, and that the relations of His Majesty's Government with the State would be conducted with the Shaikh. This the Council accepted without demur. In December the Shaikh, with the aid of certain of his Bedouin tribesmen, but without bloodshed, succeeded in overawing the Council, and in dissolving it. A fresh Council was elected but never met, a dispute between it and the Shaikh having arisen over the Constitution drawn up by the first Council, which the( iv ) Shaikh now refused to accept. To anticipate events, early in 1939, after a further outbreak instigated by Iraqi propaganda, the Shaikh annulled the Constitution and instituted a nominated Advisory Council on the lines His Majesty's Government had advised him to set up nearly a year before. This development can be considered the satisfactory outcome of a troubled year for Kuwait. The market price of pearls continued to be low. Bahrain. —In regard to the Zubara dispute between the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Qatar, account of which was given in last year's Review, the prohibitory measures by the Bahrain Government against Qatar continued in force at the end of 1938. In September an outbreak of agitation occurred in Bahrain amongst the youno-er educated class, who have formed a Youth Movement, and amongst the Bahraini employees of the Bahrain Petroleum Company. The demand of the former was for a more democratic form of government, including the formation of an elected Council and the reform of the Law Courts. The demand of the latter was for better labour conditions. There were some rowdy demonstrations which the Bahrain police had to suppress, without however any casualties on either side. The Shaikh refused to set up a Council but the reform of the Law Courts is under way, and at the request of the Shaikh His Majesty' Government are arranging for two legal experts from Egypt or the Sudan to visit Bahrain and advise on what shape the reforms should take. The pay of Bahraini labour in the Bahrain Oil Company has been raised, and a representative of the Bahrain Government has been appointed to act as Liaison Officer between the Company and their Bahraim employees. In January the Shaikh left for Jedda via Bombay to make the Haj, and returned in March. In the hot weather he fell seriously ill and visited Kashmir for a change. In his absences the State was administered by a Council of Regency comprised of the Shaikh's brother, Abdulla, his son, Salman, and the Adviser, Mr. Belgrave. The pearl season showed a decline in prices and in catch. Trucial Coast.—The subject of Trucial Coast—Saudi Frontiers was under consideration during the year but no settlement was reached. In October a popular agitation started in Dibai for a more democratic form of government in the shape of an elected Executive Council. r ihe Shaikh of Dibai was given the same advice as was given to the Shaikh of Kuwait, i.e., that it would be wise for him to associate his people with himself in his administration by instituting a nominated Advisory Council. This advice, as in the case of the Shaikh of Kuwait, was not taken. The opposi tion party by a show of force then made themselves masters of the situation. There was some confusion in the Town and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, was asked to send a sloop to Dibai to protect British lives and property The sloop stayed at Dibai some days and had a steadying effect on the situation. Finally an elected Executive Council came into being which took much of his power away from the Shaikh. The same warning as to the control of His Majesty's Government over foreign affairs was given to the Council as was given to that at Kuwait, and was accepted without demur. To anticipate the events of early 1939, the Shaikh, with the assistance of his Bedouin followers, succeeded after some fighting of a not very serious nature in dissolving the Council, and a nominated Advisory Council is now m existence. Early in the year under review information was received that an Iranian and a Kuwaiti trading in Dibai were indulging in the smuggling of arms. The consignments were small but it was considered advisable to i equest the Shaikh of Dibai to deport them, which he did. The pearl industry showed a decrease in prices and catch. Muscat. —His Highness the Sultan visited London in March as the guest of His Majesty's Government, and was invested with the K.C.I.E. by His Majesty. His Highness's visit was most successful. He was much gratified by his reception and made a very favourable impression on all whom he met.( V ) Opportunity was taken of His Highness's stay in London to continue the negotiations for a new Treaty with the Muscat State to replace the Treaty of Commerce and Friendship of 1891. These negotiations were conducted bv the India Office with the assistance of the Political Resident, who was put on deputation for this purpose. To anticipate the events of 1939, the new Treaty was finally signed at Muscat on the 5th February by the Sultan and the Political Resident as representing His Majesty's Government. PERSIAN SIDE. Bushire District and Tangistan.—Th.Q disarmament of the tribes and the establishment of law and order by the Iranian Authorities in the more remote districts continued. The condition of the peasantry of these districts and the continued emigration of the people to the Arab side of the Gulf was the subject of an official enquiry by a Committee from the ministry of the Interior. The high prices of foodstuffs were maintained during the year, wheat being sold by the Revenue Authorities at almost double the purchase price. As a result much wheat was smuggled into the town. Persian Navy. —The Persian Navy continued its patrolling of the coast and effected a few captures of sailing craft alleged to be engaged in smuggling. No incidents occurred during the year in regard to the interference with dhows of the Arab Shaikhdoms. Relations with local Iranian Authorities. —These continued to be most friendly. T. C.

On April 26th Aqai Hasan Farzaneh, until lately Governor of Khorram shahr and who had formerly held an appointment in the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived and took over the office of Governor. The jurisdiction of the Governor of Bushire had been curtailed and for administrative purposes Bushire has been placed under the Governor-General of Fars. The Governor's jurisdiction extends from Dilum in the North to Kangan in the South, and only as far as Borasjan in the interior. Assistant Governor. —Aqai Taqi Midhat from 1st January to 21st March. Aqai Muhammad Karim Nawab from 22nd March to the end of the year. Monopolisation of Wheat Supplies. —The Revenue Authorities purchased the year's harvest at Rials 1-20 a Maund (about 8 lbs.). It is believed that the wheat was actually resold at nearly double the purchase price. An endeavour was made to provide for local consumption but unfortunately the supplies ran short towards the end of the year and the Revenue Department were forced to obtain wheat from Kirmanshah. In December the local3 authorities issued wheat at the rate of 3 kilos a person every other day. Un fortunately a large number of people were unable to obtain even this small quantity and as a result a considerable amount of wheat was smuggled into the town. Smuggling of Contraband goods. —Owing to the continued smuggling of Japanese piecegoods the Iranian Government deputed an official from Tehran to take over local stocks from the Bushire Company. These stocks were retailed at a comparatively low price to the local inhabitants. Quantities of piecegoods were also sent to towns in the Bushire hinterland. This action by the Iranian Government had the effect of stopping the smuggling of piecegoods into Bushire, but Japanese artificial silk still continued to be brought in by smuggling. The local Customs Preventive Department have succeeded in seizing various consignments of smuggled goods and they have also arranged for the deportation of some 20 persons who were known to be professional smugglers. These persons have been sent to towns in the interior. Tobacco Monopoly. —The Bushire Tobacco Monopoly continued to make a 100 per cent, profit on their purchases of local stocks. Fisling Industry. —Dr. H. Blegvad, the Danish marine biologist, who has been working for the Iranian Government has completed his enquiries and has submitted a scheme for the construction of two factories, one at Bushire and the other at Bandar Abbas. The Bushire factory is designed to deal with ' fillets ' and the Bandar Abbas Factory langousts, anchovis and the sardines. Dr. Blegvad appeared to be greatly satisfied over the result of his investigation. Roads and Communications. 1. Bushire-Shir ax Road. —In spite of being repaired twice during the year this road was impassable for over a fortnight during the winter. 2. Bushire-Firuzahad Road. —Work on this road has been very slow and by the end of the year the road was still incomplete. Land Registration. The Land Registration Department was opened in June. The registra tion of property in Bushire and the surrounding districts was proceeded with. Presumably, in order to increase revenue property has been valued above market value. Revenue. As it was found impracticable for one Director to administer two depart ments the Revenue Department has been removed from the control of the Director of the Southern Customs. Education. A new Education and Waqf Department, the constitution of which was commenced in 1937 is still incomplete. Bushire Municipality. The Municipality have undertaken a five-year plan and propose during that period to build and maintain a lazaretto, to construct a public park and to improve road communications in the town. They have raised their budget to Rials 30,000 a month and are maintaining a sanitary staff of 70 persons. A small infirmary, with accommodation for 8 inpatients under the supervision of a local doctor, has been maintained and in addition the Municipality have made provision for lunatics and for some twenty lepers. The Municipality's efforts to ensure a regular and sufficient supply of electricity and ice were successful. • 23(s) e \.dSECTION 4. ARMY. The strength of the Bushire Garrison was maintained at 8,000 men. 1. Brigadier General Amidi, Officer in charge of the Fars Division carried out an inspection in May. 2. The Recruiting Bureau which had been amalgamated with the Naval ^ureau was separated and re-constituted with the Governor as President, a Military Officer as Recruiting Officer, and a Military Doctor, the Chief of Jrolice, the Imam-i-Jumah, and two local merchants, as members Thev HnrT. T P^ 10111 ^ strict .and very few exemption papers were issued during the year 1,950 recruits were enrolled. Of these 500 were sent to felnraz and a 180 to Khorramshahr to join the Iranian Navy. The rest of the the r year Were adinittecl to tiie local Militar y Barracks at various times during 3. The Military Barracks, the construction of which was begun in 1936 were practically complete and the local Garrison have occupied them. 4. Major Jalayer was Commander of the Garrison until relieved in July by Lieutenant-Colonel Karimi. DISARMAMENT OF THE TRIBES. a + i as ^ a reSll 1 lt so 1 mewhat repressive measures by the Persian Military Authonties a hundred rifles and two thousand rounds of ammunition were collected m the districts and have been sent to Bushire. It is reported that the Authorities resorted to flogging to induce persons to give information regarding the whereabouts of arms and ammunition. NAVY. Lieutenant-Colonel Ghulam Ali Bayandor was in charge of the Iranian JNavy throughout the year. 2. During the year the sloop ' Palang ' seized five dhows with 800 packages of contraband goods, the gun-boat ' Shahrokh ' two dhows with 500 packages and the tug ' Niru ' four dhows with 350 packages. ti .i 3 ' The 1 flas ^ in g T li g ht s ^stalled by the Iranian Naval Authorities at .Dushire and on Qais Island have not been regularly operated during the year. SECTION 5. AVIATION. British. Ten British aviators passed through Bushire during the year Foreign.—-Air France maintained their weekly service except that in December owmg to heavy rains the landing ground was unserviceable for 20 days. During this period Air mails for and from Bushire wore carried , l t ) i i o - ijaa ixuiu j &gt;usnire were carried between Basrah and Bushire by the British India Steam Navigation Com pany s Fast Mail steamers. ci T r e ^ ma i ntaine( i their direct service between Jask and Basrah Some forty of their machines landed at Bushire to refuel or to take „ ^ passengers. P SECTION 6, POLITICAL SITUATION. i u A C&lt;( J^ mi t tee . of senior officials from the Iranian Ministry of the Interior held an Enquiry into the condition of the peasantry in the hinterland and the causes underiymg the continued emigration of people to the Arab side oi the Oriui. It is understood that a report has been submitted by the Com mittee to the Central Government but no indication is forthcoming of their5 2. The possibility of bringing drinking water for Bushire Town from the rivers Mund and bhahpur and also the possibility of effectively damming these rivers lor irrigation purposes has been investigated by two engineers. It is understood that both the engineers considered that the damming of the rivers for irrigation purposes was practicable. One of them hopes to be able to obtain drinking water for the town from Khaviz or from Halilah. He is said to be surveying the country and sinking experimental borings at Halilah. 3. In spite of the removal of some of the tribal chiefs from their districts to the interior of the country by the Iranian Military Authorities there were still two or three gangs of malcontents at large in the mountains. These gangs were responsible for a number of raids on villages and caravans passing from one village to another. SECTION 7. MANUMISSION. During 1938, the following numbers of slaves were manumitted :— Bahrain Agency ......... n Sharjah Agency 122 Muscat Agency 57 H. D. RUSHTON, Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. SECTION 8. TRADE AND TRADE FACILITIES. 1. General Conditions. —During the year under review there has been no improvement in the trade of Bushire. Apart from one or two merchants who import a small quantity of general goods for sale in the locality most of the merchants have been occupied solely in doing a forwarding business. In fact, this forwarding business is now all that is keeping the port of Bushire alive. All the important merchants have migrated either to Shiraz or 1 ehran, leaving only small establishments here to clear goods from the Customs. The clearance of goods from the Customs, particularly for import, has been very slow, owing to the many restrictions imposed by the Exchange Control Commission which apparently could not redeem bills from the bankers. In January a new Government scheme came into force. Exporters were required to account for only 50 per cent, of the sale proceeds of their goods to the Control Committee and were allowed to import goods against the remain ing 50 per cent. Even that was of little assistance to Bushire trade, since the stample Iranian products are in the hands of the monopolies and other types of goods are in very small demand abroad. In a further attempt to enable merchants to clear their goods from the Customs the Government allowed third-class category goods freedom of export and the sale proceeds of such goods were allowed to be paid against goods already lying in Customs. This to some small extent helped local dealers both to export and to import. Transport services during the year did rather badly but were kept going by carrying monopoly goods such as sugar and tea as well as Anglo-Iranian Oil Company products. During the year the piecegoods monopoly as a private concern was abolished because the monopoly agents were selling monopoly goods above the fixed rate. The Government, therefore, took the business into its own hands and a branch of the Government Monopoly in Piecegoods was opened in Bushire during May. At first the very heavy local demand caused some difficulty but permission was very wisely given to various shopkeepers to buy a limited amount of piecegoods from the Monopoly and retail them, provided the prices asked were those fixed by the Government. The dividend paid by the old Piecegoods Monopoly was 30 per cent, and by the Sugar and Tea6 Monopoly 28 per cent, during the year under review. Since March 1938 the barter agreement with Germany has been cancelled and this of course caused a very great advance in the prices of German goods still arriving to complete orders placed before the cancellation. It will be seen from the foregoing that Bushire has just about held its own during the year. There has been some slight increase in exports. It is said that this is because export via Russia has ceased. Most of the exports, such as dried fruits, gum Arabic, cotton, goat-hair and herbs, have been shipped to Germany. The ever-present fear in Bushire is that its remaining trade will go to Bandar Shahpur. And it seems to be quite obvious that this is bound to take place sooner or later. At the moment however, it is said locally that this will not happen for the next two or three years owing to the lack at Bandar Shahpur of jetty facilities. This seems, however, to be very much a case of the wish being father to the thought. In March 1938, a second large crane was erected in the Customs but did not come into operation until November when an extension to the quay was opened. Unfortunately however, the new quay has proved far from satis factory, since the sea wall has a large number of beam-ends and store-blocks protruding from it, some, it seems, deliberately as part of the design, and some accidentally from faulty construction. In consequence, when the sea is in any way rough, the lighters find themselves unable without damage to lie close to the wall. In fact only a short time ago a lighter smashed its side against one of these stone out-crops and sank. The new Governor who took office in August has to a certain extent tried to improve the town. He has repaired the sea-front and by planting trees on it is trying to make it a pleasant walk. He is also taking some interest in the bazaar and is doing his best to see that the shops are kept clean. The wireless equipment and telephone exchange formerly belonging to His Majesty's Government were handed over during the year to the Iranian authorities. The beacon at the aerodrome which month by month has been reported to be ready for work has, for reasons unknown, still not come into use. In June an office of the Registration Department for lands and bonds was opened. The complaint is general that local property, in view of the present condition of trade, has been grossly over-valued. There appears to be much substance in this complaint, but appeal by the local landlords to higher authorities has had no effect. Industry. —There has been no further development of industry, either by the Government or private individuals since last year. The spinning section of the local mill came into operation in January this year. It produces 10- counts and 20-counts yarn. A master-weaver was engaged from the United Kingdom. He arrived in June and some cloths (unbleached shirtings and coloured prints) were put on the market in September. The prices charged however, were too high for local acceptance. The proprietor of the mill, Mr. Agar, held a meeting of shareholders at Shiraz in September. A managing committee of 7 merchants mostly from Bushire was appointed. The distri bution of the profits agreed upon was 5 per cent, for Mr. Agar as proprietor, 4 per cent, to be divided among the members of the committee and 1 per cent, for the auditor, the remainder of course to the shareholders. The company now goes under the name of' Etimadieh Spinning and Weaving Mill Limited ,r (Sherkate Sehami Risandegi Va Bafandegi Etimad). The question of electric light in the town joins up with that of the mill. In an endeavour to improve the supply for the town the Governor held a meeting of influential merchants and other local people of standing in September. He got the proprietor of the mill to agree to supply 24 hours current as well as ice to the town. For this it was agreed to raise a subscrip tion of Rials 1,000,000, which was to be included in the capital of the mill. The proprietor further asked that foreign exchange to the tune of £5,000 should be sold to him by the Government in order to buy extra parts for the necessary machinery. This £5,000 did not materialise and the proprietor went to Tehran to see if he could get it. He returned having been given the amount not in sterling but in marks.7 Agriculture. —The three crops grown here are;— 1. Wheat, 2. Barley, 3. Dates. Lack of rain in 1937-38 led to a poor harvest. But rainfall at the end of 1938 augurs well for the coming crop. The total rainfall up to the end of December 1938 was 8-44 inches as against only 3-7 inches in 1937. But while the crop should be good the management of the Government monopoly is still most unsatisfactory. As reported before, the cultivator still meets with harsh dealing and delay in payment from the authorities. The tendency became more and more pronounced for the peasant to refuse to bring his produce for sale to the monopoly. Barley and dates, as third-category goods, were allowed free export. There are now two shops in the town for the sale of wheat. They are not allowed to supply anyone with more than 3 kilos and to obtain even this small quantity very often necessitates a whole day's wait. 2. Finance. —With the one exception of a new enterprise, viz., the Etimadieh Spinning and Weaving Factory (which is now producing to full capacity), the financial requirements of the few merchants remaining in Bushire are confined to Customs duties, road tax and forwarding charges on consignments handled by them on behalf of up-country principals. The demand for credit for these purposes fluctuates, of course, with the volume of goods that may be released under Government licence and has varied throughout the period under review between some Rials 500,000 to Rials 1,500,000 per week. Drawings range from T. T. to 61 days' sight. Latterly the Government has been more generous in the issue of import licences cover ing consignments which arrived at this port during 1937 (chiefly of German origin) and, in so far as importers nowadays do not place orders abroad with out securing licences, it is expected that some 8,000 chests of Calcutta tea at present in the Customs-house will be released shortly under licence. Bushire has ceased to be a centre for foreign exchange. An outside market or ' black bourse ' exists within very narrow limits and transactions as high as Rials 180 per £1 have been reported. This rate is based on the official rate of 80J plus a premium of approximately 100 per cent, which importers requiring exchange purchase permits must pay the exporter for exchange certificates at today's market rates. Added to this importers have to pay a premium of 15 per cent, on export certificates to be obtained from the Banque Mellie Iran. As will be seen from the foregoing remarks the economic policy of the Government is responsible for this port ceasing to function as a free exchange or commodity market. The future of such activity as exists in connection with traffic to or from up-country is obscure in the extreme, due to (1) the quite incalculable conse quences of any further official arbitrary measures decided upon and (2) unmistakable signs of the gradual development of the port of Bunder Shahpur and railway traffic from thence to the interior. Interest rates obtained by the Imperial Bank have been slightly more lucrative at 8 per cent, to 12 per cent, per annum while the Banque Melli4 Iran rates have shown little change at 6 per cent, to 7J per cent, per annum. 3. Foreign Trade. —Table ' A ' shows the number of foreign steamers calling at Bushire during 1938, with approximate figures of cargo carried. For easy comparison the number of packages has been converted roughly into tons at 10 packages per ton. The number of ships calling at Bushire has been the same as last year. The amount of trade done however, has been less since although there has been a slight improvement in exports, imports have dropped by almost half. The number of British ships calling at Bushire during the year has decreased considerably. The amount of goods imported by British Ships, however, has increased. And by far the greatest share of imports is still carried in British bottoms. There has, however, been a decrease in exports compared with last year's figures, 23(S) EAD8 German Interests. —Steamers of the Hansa Line have again increased the total tonnage carried by them. A very small decrease in imports, 15,108 tons as against 15,255 tons in 1927, is offset by a considerable increase in exports, 5,095 tons as against 3,094. Imports consisted of motor cars, almost entirely American, iron and ironware, glassware, loaf sugar, and machinery. Exports consisted of cotton, gum Arabic, liquorice, dried fruits of all kinds, goat-hair and other third class category goods. Towards the end of 1938 the Hamburg American Line made a survey of the Gulf to see if it would be worthwhile restarting their prewar service. Rumour has it, however, that the survey was unprofitable. Japanese Interests. —In 1937 there were four services running regularly to the Gulf. Now there are only two, i.e., the Mitsui and Yamashita Lines. During the year 21 of their steamers called at Bushire and landed 1,141 tons of cargo, mostly tea, glassware and piecegoods. They took away, however, only 195 tons of opium. Russian Interests. —The only U. S. S. R. business through Bushire in 1938 consisted of the import of sugar for the Government Monopoly. It came in one Norwegian and two Greek steamers bringing a total of 5,42i tons. Other Interests. —The American Silver Line and other American Lines have ceased to call at Bushire and cargo for Bushire is being landed at Basrah for transhipment by B. I. steamers. One American and one Dutch steamer, however, called during the year. 4. Opium. —The following are the details of opium shipped from Bushire during 1938 : — January ....... 300 cases for Batavia. February . . . . 50 Macao. March ..... 078 5 &gt; 5 &gt; Taku ? March . . . . . 150 Yokohama ? April . . . . . 300 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Marseilles. April ..... 160 Saigon. May ..... 300 &gt;5 Saigon.

September . . . . 200 55 55 Singapore. October ..... • • • • • November . . . . 200 5 5 55 Singapore. December .... 972 5 5 5 5 Macao ? Total . 4,755 cases. Of the above, only 345 cases were shipped to Western markets, the balance going to the Far East. The majority of these shipments were made openly. But two of them, i.e., the 1,128 cases in March and the 972 cases in December were shipped very secretly for the Far East on two Japanese steamers. The port markets and destination were kept secret by the shippers. The Opium Monopoly Department has greatly increased its export of opium during the year, and Japanese trade agents in Tehran have been making every effort to get more exported to be paid for by the import of Japanese goods. 5. Communication.—Sea. —The B. I. Slow mails both up and down still call weekly at Bushire. The Fast Mail service also still calls in alternate weeks. Strick continue their monthly service and Ellerman and Bucknail call occasionally. Ships of the Hansa Line both from Germany and direct from New York call fairly regularly. The only other foreign steamers making regular calls are those of the Yamashita and Nippon Yussen Kaisha Lines (Japanese). Air. —Air France still maintains its weekly service to and from Europe and India. In November and December the aerodrome became water-logged and on several occasions planes were unable to land. They did, however.9 Rials 48i per Kharwar of 655 lbs. I Q'l ,, &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; j» &gt;i 1Q7 55 XC# . • .« , , , , drop mails but were unable to take any up. During these weeks Air Mail letters for Europe were sent to Basrah by mail steamers where an arrange ment was supposed to be made for their re-posting by Imperial Airways. Road. —The Bushire-Shiraz road was passable for lorries and other motor vehicles during the greater part of the year. It was washed out for some days by heavy rain during December. The projected road Shiraz-Firuzabad- Bushire is said to be progressing. Average transport rates during the year have been as follows :— Lorry to Shiraz . Lorry to Isfahan Lorry to Tehran Owners of lorries have not done too well during the year since the amount of goods for transport has decreased while the expenses for maintenance and payment of instalments, etc., remain the same. Usually the only freight they could obtain consisted of monopoly goods and Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's products. 6. Social. —Living conditions in Bushire have in no way improved during the year under review. The local taxes are very heavy. Numbers of shops in the bazaar have been closed owing to the great difficulty of obtaining goods for sale. The few shops still open sell mostly a very inferior class of goods, bought and brought from Tehran. The cost of living varied considerably during the year as will be seen by a reference to the following table :— Commodities. Cost in February 1938 Flour Tea . Meat Ghee Tomatoes . Potatoes . * Shiraz rice Bread (local) Bread loaf Water Rials. 4-00 „ 20-00 „ 8-00 „ 38-00 „ 4-10 „ 4-00 „ 8-25 „ 4-50 „ 2-50 „ 1-25 Cost in June 1938 Rials 3-50 per man of 7-75 lbs „ 22-00 per 500 grammes. ,, 9-60 per man of 7-75 lbs. „ 34-50 „ 4-50 „ 4-00 „ 10-00 „ 3-50 „ 3-00 ,, 1-50 per skin load. It is moreover to be noted that the flour and bread mentioned are of the most inferior quality. All the municipal taxes mentioned last year are still levied and a further tax of 3 per cent, ad-valorem on goods imported into the town was imposed. The system in vogue is that the goods arriving are valued at a Police post about 8 miles above Bushire. One or two packages from the consignment are then taken by the Finance Department agent and held up at the post until the merchant concerned pays the tax levied and sends a lorry again to bring the remaining goods into town. The wages paid to local labourers have improved somewhat since there has been a fairly steady demand both at the Etimadieh Mill and for construc tion work at the Military barracks. The rates paid are as follows :— Customs coolie . Labourer . Cotton operator Skilled builder . Semi-skilled builder Carpenter Builders' Foreman Rials 3-00 4-50 2-50 to 6-00 12-00 to 15-00 7 00 „ 12-00 to 15-00 „ 30-00 The population seems about the same as last year. Smuggling or piecegoods and sugar has greatly decreased since these goods are now being sold at reasonable prices by the Government Monopoly departments. But the smuggling of almost everything else, artificial silks, foot-ware, perfumery, etc., still continues. R. S. T. JOHN, His Majesty's Vice-Consul. 23(S; EAD11 APPENDIX I. NOTES ON THE WORKING OF THE RESIDENCY DISPENSARY, BUSHIRE, FOR THE YEAR 1938. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel J. J. Rooney, I.M.S., was in charge throughout the year. 2. 1st Class Assistant Surgeon R. Easey, I.M.D., was in sub-charge throughout the year. 3. Nothing of note occurred during the year. A mild epidemic of Measles started in December. 4. The hot weather was one of the most trying on record. Twenty-six deaths from Heat-stroke were reported, amongst the local inhabitants. Prior to 1938 deaths from Heat-stroke were extremely rare in spite of the notoriously bad climate. 5. The number of indoor and outdoor patients compared with those of 1937 were as follows :— In- Out- Operations, patients, patients. 1937 . . . . • . . . 6 11,339 207 1938 15 13,969 261 Malaria, as usual, was the most prevalent disease and accounted for more than a quarter of the total admissions and attendances. J. J. l&amp;OONW?, Lieut.-Colonel, I.M.S., Residency Surgeon.15 CHAPTER 11. ( NOTE ON EVENTS IN THE BIKARZ AREA DURING 1938. Work has continued on development of our Southern Area during the year under review. A track is being prepared for the 12' oil pipe-line to be constructed between Gach Saran and our Abadan Refinery. In Gash Saran two oil wells and one gas well were completed, and three wells are now in the process of drilling. Preparations are also in hand to drill a further two locations when work on those drilling at present is completed. Improvements were made to the Ganoweh-Gach Saran Road, major work being carried out between mile 20 and mile 43. The Kumbal- Pokak Road was widened to a 16 ft. carriage way and the alignment was improved and alterations made to bad corners. One bridge of 3-20 ft. spans was constructed over the Kumbal River. The road from Bah Moha- med (Gach Saran) to our new development area at Du Gumbadan was widened to a 20 ft. carriage way as far as the Amniyeh Post, all bad corners being improved and minor diversions made to improve alignment. The Dasht-i-Mirza Road was widened to a 16 ft. carriage way from Ab-i- Shirin to Dasht-i-Mirza. The Khairabad Bridge, mentioned in our last report No. D/O 79/7 of 23rd April 1938, is now completed, except for painting; therefore the road from Behbehan to Gach Saran is now an all weather one. Additional quarters for Staff and Labour have been constructed and others commenced. The existing Cold Store at Gach Saran was removed, and a new cold store consisting of an insulated concrete room was placed in operation in the new Ice Factory. The Gach Saran Staff Club was altered for the installation of Cinema machines. The following British and British Indian subjects were employed in the area :— Wives Staff. nad children. Gach Saran and Ganoweh British ...... 49 15 British Indian .... 34 4 Agha Jari and Pazanun British ...... 28 6 British Indian .... 26 8 Pipe Line Construction British ...... 9 1 British Indian .... 6 Totals . . 152 34 As the tonnage to be handled at Ganoweh during the next few years will be greatly increased owing to the development taking place in Gach Saran, the Ganoweh layout is being reorgajiised. This is taking the form of new transhipment buildings, jetty, roads and cargo handling facilities. Housing is under construction for Artisan and Unskilled staff. A new water line has been laid at Ganoweh, and a pumping plant has been installed at several wells on a location approximately five miles north of the station. New water storage tankes are being erected which will give ade quate supply to the entire Company's area. New Power Generating sets have been installed, and a new dispensary is now under construction to provide additional medical service to the area. 23 (s) ead16 CHAPTER III. SUMMARY OF EVENTS AND CONDITIONS IN EARS DURING THE YEAR 1938. 1. General Situation. —The situation remained undisturbed throughout the year but the rate of progress in the development of this Province which was so marked a feature in previous years slowed down considerably owing largely no doubt to the constant change and transfer of responsible officials. The boycott of foreigners showed no sign of abatement. The cost of living continued to rise, official salaries remained the same and corruption spread ever depper. 2. Tribal Affairs. —The Qashgai and Khamseh tribes have apparently been cowed and the only trouble which occurred was amongst the Boir Ahmadi, whose grievances however were more economic than political. The dispatch of 400 troops from Shiraz in July was sufficient to restore order. Tribesmen disturbed by the prospect of forced settlement in unhealthy districts continued to emigrate to Arabia and it is estimated that 10,000 left in the course of the year. The order that tribal shepherds should substitute white tents for black tents was observed in the neighbourhood of Shiraz by spreading white material over the traditional goats' hair. Tribal settlement, previously under military control, was placed in the hands of a civilian director, Aqa-i-Azam Quds, a former mullah. 3. Security. —Public security continued to be well maintained in spite of reports of the corrupt practices of the road guards. Two isolated cases were reported of lorries being looted on the road but the shooting of the bandits concerned had a salutary affect. A few burglaries occurred on the outskirts of Shiraz but these were almost certainly the work of amateur cracksmen from the barracks. 4. Local Administration. —The new territorial division of the 7th Ustan comprises not only the old province of Ears but also a strip of coast including Bushire and a portion of the Ahwaz Consular District round Behbehan. As a result of the purge which followed the judicial investigation into the scandals of the Dowlatshahi regime all high officials in the administration were replaced. Mohammad Ibrahim Alam (Shoukat-ul-Mulk), who had a reputation for integrity, the successor of Dowlatshahi, remained as Ustandar until October when he left for Tehran and was not replaced before the end of the year. Aqa-i-Ali Naqi Hoshyar, formerly Assistant Governor was appointed Earmandar under the new scheme of administration, and acted for the Us tandar when he left. Aqa-i-Abdul Hussein Shabdiz, who became head of the municipality on the imprisonment of Aqa-i-Ali Asghar, Soheily, left for Tehran in July and did not return. His place was taken by Aqa-i-Nasrullah Sepehri. The Chief of Police Sarhang Raufi, was transferred to Tehran and replaced by Sarhang Shaikh-ul-Islami from Zinjan. 5. Military Affairs. —General Zandieh, the former Officer Commanding of the Ears division, and a colonel Sa'adi were found guilty by a military tri bunal of robbery and conniving at the murder of the Munshi Bashi of the Qawam-ul-Mulk and handed over to the civil authorities for further proceed ings. They are said to have enventually been sentenced to 15 years imprison ment, but this has not been confirmed. Eollowing the enquiries of the same tribunal into the lucrative activities of the former Commanding Officer and the scandals in general of the Dowlat shahi regime, all officers in command of regiments in the Ears division were exchanged and the present Commanding Officer, General Amidi, completed the purge by transferring some seventy others.17 Divisional Headquarters were moved to the new building at the end of the Khiaban-i-Zand the appearance of which is reported with reason to have displeased the Shah. The strength of the division remained at about 6/7,000 men. 6. Communications. —The Mashileh causeway on the road from Shiraz to Bushire was completed, the last ten miles on the Borazjun-Ahmadi section being metalled with boulders which would test the clearance of a T model Ford. The road was closed for several days in the winter and early spring by heavy rain or melting snow but under normal conditions the surface was fair to good. The Kazerun-Bushire-Behbehan road is now fully bridged between Beh- behan and Guch Saran (Qare-Quli) but the section from Basht to Kazerun is still subject to periodical wash-outs. The Shiraz-Firuzabad road (the future road to Bushire was opened in September and improvements were carried out on the Niriz-Sirjan section of the Shiraz-Kerman road and also on the road from Fasa to Estahbanat. Mails from Tehran continued to arrive very irregularly and 5 to 7 days for a letter from Bushire was no exception. 7. Agriculture. —Heavy rain in February amply compensated for a dry December and grain crops in general were good. The bread queues in Shiraz which were a feature of the early part of the year disappeared after the har vest. Fruit crops on the other hand were extensively damaged by the late frosts in May. The area under cotton remained at approximately 26,000 hectars produc ing a crop of 20,000 tons, all ' Falestini Permission was given to grow rice on swampy ground but this is only temporary as villagers will be instructed in future to grow jute. 8. Trade. —The release of such articles as gum tragacanth, skins, carpets* almonds etc. from the stranglehold of the various monopoly companies pro vided a welcome fillip to the export trade. Merchants may now purchase these articles from the companies concerned and export them in accordance with the new regulations, whereby 50 per cent, of the proceeds of exports of all Iranian products may be used against imports. In practice however these arrnagements only cover about 20 per cent, of the export trade as the remainder is with the U. S. S. R. and Germany under the Trade Agreements. In spits of the restriction of credit by the National Bank few bankrupt cies occurred of any importance. The report on progress of the Shiraz branch of the Imperial Bank of Iran for the half year ending September 30th, 1938, showed a profit of Rials 171,721 as against Rials 152,702 for the corresponding period of last year. British trade, apart from a few isolated consignments of machinery, remained nil. 9. Industries. —The cotton mills of the Fars Manufacturing Company and the Fars Electric Company continued to work satisfactorily in spite of difficulties in obtaining their supplies of raw cotton and spare parts for their machinery. The sugar factory at Morv Dasht prepared for expansion next year by purchasing additional plant and encouraging agriculturalists within a 60 km. radius, instead of 30 km. as previously, to grow beet. Production was expec ted to reach 50,000 tons as against 10,000 tons in 1937. The site for the grain silo to be erected at Shiraz by the Kampsax Consor tium was marked out and materials collected but no construction work was commenced. The Shiraz distillery, run by a Jewish company, ' Sherket-i-Kushabeh under the control of the Finance Department obtained a monopoly for the manufacture of araq, which it produced at Rials 7*55 a bottle.18 T he Shiraz Electric Light Station continued to supply light from 4 p.m. to a.m . with reasonable efficiency in spite of the breakdown, through i nexperienced handling, of their new Mirrlees diesel engine. No noticeable effect was made on industrial conditions by the new wage- law, since local wages were not above the new limit. 10. Miscellaneous. —The Church of St. Simon Zealot at Shiraz was con secrated on St. Simon's day, October 28th. The plan of the building is cruciform but the structure and ornamentation are in purely Persian style. The Government Training School for Nurses, directed by an American trained nurse, was established in a house near the C. M. S. hospital, where its pupils attend demonstrations. ^ Ihe Khiaban-i-Zand, the 130 feet wide central avenue of Shiraz, was opened for traffic early in the year and is now being beautified with trees and gardens. The Trantour Hotel in Shiraz was brought near to completion but the only person competent to manage it appears to be the proprietor of its rival, the Hotel Sa'adi. Lhe Church Missionary Society school, under Miss Gerrard, has far out grown its present premises but has failed to obtain possession of the new build ing which it purchased in the Spring and which is occupied by the Depart ment of Justice. The British and missionary connections of the school are not advertized locally. The Shapur river has been dammed near Kazerun for irrigation purposes. The Anglo Iranian Oil Company's policy of forbidding the distribution of petrol in tins in order to stimulate bulk sales caused great inconvenience. The number of filling stations, except on the Bushire road, was quite in ade quate and lorries were constantly being stranded for lack of petrol between Shiraz and Isfahan. A serious outbreak of small-pox occurred at Ardakan and carried off some hundreds of young children. 11. Shiraz Weather Report—- Maximum temperature . . . 98 0 F on. July 23r(l. Minimum temperature . . . 25 0 F on February 13th and 14th. Total rainfall for the season 1937-1938 was 16*18 inches as compared with 10-27 inches for 1936-1937 and 12-27 inches for 1935-1936. Earthquake shocks were felt in January and February. A. H. KING, H. B. M. Consul*CCNFIDENTIAL. 19 CHAPTER IV. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE KERMAN AND BANDAR ABBAS CONSULATES FOR THE YEAR 1938. A.—KERMAN. I. HIS MAJESTY'S CONSULATE. Personnel. —Major G. A. Falconer, I.P.S., held charge throughout the year. Tours. —H. M.'s Consul resided in Bandar Abbas for 8 weeks in January —March. He also proceeded to Tehran in April and to Isfahan in October. His Majesty's Birthday. —The Governor paid a formal call on H. M.'s Consul on the morning of the 9th June, and attended an evening party at the Consulate accompanied by Mde Merat. Consular statistics (1938)— British subjects registered ......... 20 Passports issued . Passport renewals granted Documents legalised or attested Fees levied .... 5 7 96 £119/1 II. VISITORS. H. R. H. Prince Peter of Greece arrived in Kerman on the 12th February and left for Tehran on the 21st February. While in Kerman he stayed with M. Timoyanaki, a Greek subject and Manager of the Iranian Carpet Co., by arrangement with the Governor. Baroness Blixen and Mrs. Bagnall, who were motoring from Calcutta to Europe, stayed in Kerman from the 26th to 28th February. The Czecho-Slovakian Charge d'Affaires at Tehran and Mde Frit visited Kerman from the 5th to 7th May. Lt.-Colonel H. J. Underwood, British Military Attache at Tehran, arrived In Kerman on the^5th May and left for Tehran on the 29th May. The Rt. Revd. W. J. Thompson, Bishop in Iran, visited Kerman in April and from the 2nd to 28th July. Lieut. P. G. B. McNalty, I.A., a language student, arrived on the 7th October and left on the 29th November for Shiraz. III. BRITISH INTERESTS. Trade. —British products enjoy a high reputation among Iranians, but so long as the present f seal policy of the Iranian Government remains it is practically impossible for local merchants to have any direct commercial dealings with the United Kingdom or other parts of the British Empire ; the restrictions on foreign exchange are an effective bar. Notwithstanding these difficulties small quantities of British goods continue to find their way to Kerman from time to time, chiefly through the monopoly companies. There is a boom in bicycles as a form of locomotion. A large number of new machines have appeared in this district during the past year and a fair proportion of these are the British made ' Hercules' costing rials 600 (£7/10/-); the remainder are of German manufacture selling at rials 500 (£6/5/-). There is a risk demand for foreign piecegoods and Horricks' products were on sale at the Government cloth shop, but the majority of imported piece goods are of Japanese and Russian manufacture. Most of the tea consumed is Indian grown. With the exception of carpets to London, which is now the recognised centre for the European markets, exports from this district to the U. K. and India are negligible. 23(SJ EAD20 Anlgo-Iranian Oil Co— A whole-time agent of the Compcany has been retained at Kerman throughout the year. Supplies of petrol and oil for south-east Iran which were formerly sent via Karachi are now landed at Bandar Abbas and conveyed overland to Zahidan via Kerman. The importance of the Kerman agency has correspondingly increased. Church Missionary Society. —(a) Medical. —Both the men's and women's S3ctions of the hospital functioned throughout the year. Dr. R. H. Carpen ter was in charge of the former, and Dr. (Miss) Henriques of the latter, until she proceeded on home leave in the Autumn. Both these instibations render useful service to local inhabitants and the work is much appreciated. Local government officials also make frequent use of this medical service. Both the former Governor's wife and the present acting Governor were in-patients for short periods during the year. Many thousands of out-patients were given medical treatment. (6) Educational. —The Revd. Lord, on transfer to Isfahan in March, was succeeded as Principal of the Boy's School (Dabiristan-i-Jam) by Mr. H. C. Curney an Australian member of the Mission. The year has been one of progress and there is keen competition for vacancies. Students from this school were very successful in the Government examinations. Physical training, games and Boy Scouts are also features of the school programme. Miss J. F. Woodroffe was in charge of the Girl's School throughout the year. This school also is very popular and many applications for admission had to be refused for want of room. The school is at present badly housed,, and although a sum of £3,000 was given by the Bishop of Worcester in 1937 with which to construct new premises, all efforts have so far failed to extract from the Iranian authorities the requisite permission to build. There is a Girl Guide Company attached to this school. (c) Welfare Centre. —Good work is being done among the poorer classes, especially in maternity cases, and is much appreciated. {d) St. Andrews Church. —The new Chaplain, the Revd. A. T. Howden, arrived on the 31st May. There has been no interference in any of the services, but the local detective maintains his vigil at Iranian services. IV. FOREIGN INTERESTS. Representation. —There are no other foreign representatives in this district. Trade. —Direct trade with other foreign countries is practically confined to the export of carpets and pistachio nuts to America, and dried fruits and goat hair to Germany. Nearly all foreign imports are marketed through the monopoly companies, and mainly consist of cotton piece goods (Japan and Russia), machinery and bicycles (Germany), motor vehicles (U. S. A.)„ and sugar (Russia, Belgium and Holland). Carpets are still the principal exports and several New York firms have buying agents in Kerman. Export of carpets during 1938 was up to the average of the past three years, but a large percentage were from stocks on hand and few orders were being placed on the looms at the close of the year. It is estimated that 50 per cent, of the looms are idle. American cars and lorries have a firm hold on the provincial markets. V. LOCAL GOVERNMENT. Governor. —Aqai Ismail Merat relinquished the post of Governor of Ker man in July on appointment as acting Minister of Public Instruction. Aqai Ardalan, the head of the Kerman municipality, officiated as Governor for the remainder of the year. No Ustandar for the 8th (Kerman) Ustan had been appointed by the end of the year and the Governor continued direct contact with the Central Government.21 The district of Bam was separated from Kerman and made an indepen dent Farmandari, but up to the close of the year the central government departments {e.g. Finance, Police, etc.) remained subordinate to their respective departmental heads at Kerman. Aqai Ismail Bahadur was appointed Governor of the new Farmandari. He had been Governor of Bandar Abbas for the previous five years. The relations of this Consulate with the Governorates were very cordial throughout the year. Finance and Revenue. —Aqai Ganjihi was in charge of this department throughout the year. He is an energetic tax-gatherer and his zeal has been praised by the central authorities ; the local inhabitants are not so en thusiastic. An innovation was the despatch to the villages of income tax assessors. New taxes applied during the year are the Inheritance lax and a Tree Tax. It is reported that the revenue value of the Kerman dist rict per head of population stands second only to J ehran. The Auqaf Department has been transferred to the Finance Department from the Education Department. Bank-i-Milli. —Aqai Avansian Alexander retained the managership up to the end of the year. Little business was done, especially as regards foreign exchange. The percentage of foreign exchange allowed to exporters was available to buyers by private sale at prices up to rials 140 to the £ ; the Gov ernment rate being 80. Justice. —Aqai Ghayasi, the Chief Judge of the Appellate Court, was in control of the Judicial department. No important case involving a British subject came before the courts during 1938. PoZice.—Major Yusuf Bahrami succeeded Colonel Ali Qanei in June as Chief of Police. He is a popular officer and has the reputation of not ac cepting bribes. Posts and Telegraphs. —So far as this Consulate is concerned the services of this department were satisfactory. No covers addressed to this Con sulate appeared to have been tampered with and newspaper wrappers very seldom. The same cannot be said, however, of mail matter addressed to others. Towards the end of the year European mails were taking 7-14 days longer in transit than norm; 1. Educaticn. —Aqai Mail Tuwaskani, the local Director of Education, has not a very high reputation as an educationalist and his removal would not be rc g etted, especially by the Principals of the C. M. S. schools. The desire for education is steadily growing among the youth of the country, but few qualified teachers are available in this province. Municipality. —Progress in municipal administration is distressingly slow. In its efforts to impress the activities of the local Committee are con fined mai dy to the appearance of two or three principal avenues. This is indeed something, but the condition of the byways leaves much to be de sired. Nothing has been done to provide a system of surface water drainage, and no steps have been taken to improve the drinking water supply. There was an acute shortage of bread during the winter of 1937-38 and prices soared accordingly. Some relief was effected by importing grain from Kermanshah and Zahidan. Health.—lUhzve was a mild outbreak of typhoid in Rafsinjan ; other wise there were no epidemics in this area during 1938. Agriculture. —There were satisfactory rains in 1938 and good crops resulted. Nevertheless the agriculturist is not very satisfied with the present system by which he is required to sell most of his grain to the Maliyeh Department at prices lower than the bazar rates. Cotton growers were severely hit when their crops were burnt owing to alleged infection of ' red worm '. Poppy cultivation has also been drastically curtailed in this area. This was the most profitable crop of all.r 22 Industry and Developments. —The Minister of Industries with a German mineralogist inspected copper deposits at Bahr Asman (69 miles S. E. of Kerman) in October. Work on this site has since commenced but the results are not yet known. No other new industries were introduced during the year. Carpet weaving is the principal industry in this district but it is not in a very flourishing condition. By the end of the year only about 50 per cent, of the looms were working and foreign agents were not placing orders. The Khorshid Spinning Mill suffered from managerial disputes and was closed for several months. There was also a shortage of raw material. VI. MILITARY. Sartip Ali Akbar Siahpush retained command of the Kerman brigade throughout the year. He was promoted to his prese it rank in March. Troops from the brigade took part in the Bashakird operations early in the year and later in the operations against the Ismail Zais in the Bam and Rudbar areas. No important changes occurred in the composition of the brigade and the discipline and moral of the troops under the present Commander is believed to be good. The visit to Kerman in May of two senior officers from Tehran was asso ciated with the rumoured establishment of the Southern Army Headquarters at Khwash, but nothing further has been heard of this proposal. The new barracks at Sar Aseyab are still uncompleted. 800 conscripts were discharged in October and were replaced by a similar number of new men. Internal security. —The security of the main trade routes has been well maintained. No attacks on motor vehicles have been reported. VII. COMMUNICATIONS. Roads. —No new roads were constructed in this district during 1938, and existing main roads connecting Kerman were maintained in a fair state of re pair. Surrounding villages are to be linked up with Kerman by fair-weather motor roads. ^ Wireless. —The Kerman wireless station, which was erected by the Rus sians in 1926, is not in service but is believed to be subjected to a weekly test. Aviation. —No aeroplane landed at Kerman during the year. An officer of the Iranian Air Force inspected the aerodrome in August. VIII. LOCAL POLITICS. Politics do not play a very important part in the lives of the inhabitants of this district. The present regime exhibits little interest in the welfare of the people of this province and the latter display their enthusiasm for new national occasions under compulsion. Deputies for the 16th Mejliss as nominated by Tehran were duly elected by order. Press. —The ' Bidari nominally a weekly paper, makes fitful appear ances, and like three others—' Istiqamat Sada-i-Kerman ' and the 44 Aenaeh-i-Janub ' which exist only in name, is of little consequence. B.—BANDAR ABBAS. I. HIS MAJESTY'S CONSULATE. Personnel. —H. M.'s Consul, Kerman, held additional charge of Bandar Abbas throughout the year. H. M's Birthday. —The occasion was celebrated by a tea party at the Consulate on the 9th June, which was attended by 90 persons including the acting Governor, the Manager of the National Bank, and a number of Iranian merchants.23 Consular Statistics— British subjects registered Passports issued . Passport renewals granted Visas granted Documents legalised or attested Fees levied .... II. BRITISH INTERESTS. Trade. —The restrictions on trade with the United Kingdom and India as recorded under Kerman, apply equally to Bandar Abbas. Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. —A full-time agent is maintained at this port. Sup plies for south-east Iran are now discharged at Bandar Abbas and imports have increased accordingly. The local price of petrol was lowered from rials 27 • 15 to rials 24-85 per 4 gallon tin. During the year about 560 labourers were recruited in this district for work in Abadan and the Fields, but most of them were sent back because they ap proached the Iranian Naval authorities instead of the Company with a com plaint about their pay. A seismic party of 19 geophysicists, surveyors and observers arrived from Abadan in December to survey an area immediately to the west of Bandar Abbas. Formations suggest a possible oil pocket at this site and extensive tests will be carried out during January. The party will then proceed to Qishm Island. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie cfc Co., Ltd. —This firm retained a representative at this port mainly for their British India Steam Navigation Company agency business. Frank Strick Lines Ltd. —The company, through their local agent, Messrs. Dorabjee &amp; Sons, entered into a new contract with the Iranian Government for the purchase of red odde from Hormuz Island for a period of 3 years. During 1938 8,518 tons of red oxide were shipped by this company. III. FOREIGN INTERESTS. Representation. —There are no other foreign representatives at this port. Trade. —The principal imports via. Bandar Abbas were sugar (Russia, Belgium and Holland), piece goods (Japan), ironware, girders etc. (Germany and 0 Belgium), chemicals (Germany) and glassware (Japan). Exports included cotton (Russia and Germany), wool (Germany and Holland), goat hair and dried fruits (Germany), carpets and pistachio nuts (U. S. A.). IV. LOCAL GOVERNMENT. Governor. —Aqai Ismail Bahadur vacated the appointment on the 9th April on transfer to Bam.. The new Governor, Aqai Muhammad Zandniapur, arrived on the 27th December. There were two acting appointments in the interim. Customs and Finance. —Azizullah Mina was the Director of Customs and Finance throughout the year. Central Government inspectors visited Bandar Abbas and the subordinate posts of Jask and Charbar in March. In May an insurance premium of one rial per 1,000 ad valorem was imposed on all goods passing through the customs house. Bank-i-Milli. —Abul Qasim Saba'ai succeeded Fatahullah Pirmuradi in May as manager of the local branch. In February orders were received from Tehran to withhold 1,000 rial notes from circulation owing to the presence of a number of counterfeit notes believed to have been brought into Iran from India. A sub-branch of the Bank was opened in Minab in July. Justice. —No important case involving British subjects came before the local courts during 1938. 2^(S) EAD . Nil. 9 5 219 13 . £148/19/024 Police. —Yawar Jahan Ara vacated the post of Chief of Police in September on transfer to Bushire. Sarbahr Taj Bakhsh officiated up to the end of the year. Rasadban III Mansuri from the Police Training School at Tehran was appointed Chief of Police at Minab. On arrival at Bandar Abbas in November he was put in charge of the local prison where he shortly afterwards committed suicide for reasons not known. The Chief of Police is also in charge of the local passport department. It is reliably reported that this department provides the Chief and his staff with an appreciable private income. Posts and Telegraphs. —Bashir Farahmund continued as Director through out the year. Foreign mail for private individuals is frequently tampered with, but covers for H. M.'s Consulate are treated with greater respect and no case of interference came to notice. Education. —Efforts are being made to improve and increase educational facilities at Bandar Abbas. Education is free though not compulsory. There is a primary school for boys and one for girls up to the 6th standard. The first standard of a middle school was opened during the year and higher stan dards will be added as the scholars advance. English is being taught as the second language in the middle school. There is also a night-school for grown-ups who have been warned that with effect from the new year (April 1939) business licenses will not be granted to illiterates. Municipality. —The Governor is ex officio President of the Municipality. A grant of rials 90,000 (£1,125) was made by the Ministry of the Interior for construction of a municipal building. The post of Governor was, however, vacant for over 8 months and the new premises had not been commenced by the end of the year. For similar reasons the grant of rials 380,000 (£4,750) made by the Central Government for Town improvements was sparsely uti lised. The new Governor has some good ideas on this subject and it remains to be seen if he retains sufficient energy to carry them out. Health. —There were no epidemics during 1938 and the general health of the town and district was good. Industry. —The conditions of labour at the Khunji Spinning Mill were unfavourably reported on and until improvements in the buildings are made and better ventilation provided, night shifts have been stopped. There was also a shortage of raw cotton towards the end of the year. The Director of Mines visited the Hormuz, Namakdan and Bostaneh (near Lingah) salt mines in January. No salt was exported from these mines during 1938. All mines in this district are now under the control of the local Director of Customs and Finance. During the year 10,485 tons of red oxide were shipped from Hormuz. Developments. —The new power station, with a German plant erected by German engineers from Tehran, commenced to function in December and so far has provided good service. In May Central Government Inspectors toured in Bandar Abbas and in vited local merchants to express their views for the improvement of trade and trading conditions generally. Among other points the merchants recommend ed,— (а) relief from the present restrictions on trade ; (б) reduction of municipal taxes ; (c) provision of a hospital with a qualified doctor at the port ; {d) improved sanitation in the town. Dr. H. Blegvad, the Danish expert, was in Bandar Abbas from the 27th March—3rd April for a final survey in connection with the establishment of the Iranian Fisheries industry. It is understood that a Company has been formed25 with a capital of rials 18,000,000 (£225,000), 52 per cent, of which will be sub scribed by the Iranian Government and the remainder by Dutch interests. In December Dutch agents of the new company visited Bandar Abbas and selected a site for the canning factory. In April a local company with a capital of rials 10,000 (£1,250) acquired the Bandar Abbas agency of the Tobacco Monopoly. Economic conditions. —The cost of living remained at a high level. The local harvest was not good and prices of essential foodstuffs showed a slight increase on the previous year. V. MILITARY AND MARINE. The Bandar Abbas garrison, which is included in the Kerman Brigade, t^ok part in the Bashakird operations in January-February. The threatened insurrec- tion staged by Abdul Hussain Kameran and his followers, who inhabit the Bashakird-Rudbar district a bout 45 miles north-east of Minab, was successfully quelled without a shot being fired. The Iranian sloops ' Babr ' and 14 Shahrukh ' also took part in these operations. About 100 old rifles were handed in by the rebels and, it is said, rials 40,000 were paid to the Brigadier. No other punishment seems to have been inflicted. The Kerman Brigadier inspected the local garrison on the 9th June (with Sar Kashkar Atabaki, Director of Medical Services) and again on the 5th August. Serwan Ali Sarba'z was in command of the local troops up to 2nd April when he was relieved by Sargord Azizi. Conscription. —The Bandar Abbas committee commenced its annual session on the 7th October. 106 discharged conscripts returned from Charbar in October and 159 new men were sent to that station in November. Internal Security. —Security along the Bandar Abbas-Kerman motor road and other principal trade routes was well maintained throughout the year. Iranian Navy. —All units visited this port at intervals during the year. VI. COMMUNICATIONS. Roads. —No new roads from Bandar Abbas to the interior were opened during the year. In April a party of road engineers from Tehran re-surveyed the Bandar Abbas-Minab road, at present a rough road for motors. No improvements have yet been made. The Bandar Abbas-Shiraz road via. Lar was little used during the past year. VII. SHIPPING. 136 steamers with an aggregate of 503,455 tons (gross) entered and clear ed at the port of Bandar Abbas during 1938. The distribution was as follows ;— Nationality Tonnage. British ............ 410,913 German ............ 62,605 Danish ............ 13,476 Japanese ............ 10,490 Greek 5,971 The B. I. S. N. Co.'s subsidiary mail service steamers called at this port weekly throughout the year both on the upward and downward Gulf sailings. G. A. FALCONER, Major, Bandar Abbas ; His Majesty's Consul for Kerman and Bandar Ahhas. 6th February 1939.CONFIDENTIAL. CHAPTER V. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE KUWAIT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1938. I. THE POLITICAL AGENCY. Personnel. —(a) Captain G. S. de Gaury, M.C., held charge of the Agency throughout the year. (6) Assistant Surgeon A. L. Greenway, M.R.C. S., L.R.C.P. (Lond.), I.M.D., was in medical charge of the Charitable Dispensary and performed the duties of the Quarantine Officer throughout the year. II. THE RULING FAMILY. (а) His Highness the Shaikh Sir Ahmad Ibn Jabir as Sabah has continued to be the Ruler of Kuwait, and administered the State during the year under review. (б) Shaikh Abdullah Salim as Sabah, President of the Majliss, proceeded to Basrah and Fao on a short visit during August in connection with the administration of the Sabah Family's date gardens. (c) The obligation of His Majesty's Government towards the Shaikh of Kuwait, contracted in 1914, in guaranteeing freedom from taxation for his date gardens in Iraq still remains undischarged. It is, however, hoped that a satisfactory settlement will be reached before long. The validity of title to a date garden in Iraq belonging to His Highness and his co-heirs was challenged in March by the lawyer of a relative of the man from whom the Shaikh's grand-father bought the Estate in 1909 for 42,000 Turkish Liras by a deed of sale which is not, as far as is known, disputed'. The case was still unsettled at the end of the year. {d) Shaikh Hamad bin Mubarak as Sabah, eldest son of the former Ruler of Kuwait (1896-1915), aged 43, suddenly expired on the 31st May. The funeral was attended by most of the male population including the Political Agent and the Assistant Surgeon. III. THE POLITICAL AGENT'S RELATIONS WITH THE SHAIKH. In spite of evil propaganda from many sources (Iraq, Palestine etc.), relations of the Shaikh and the people of Kuwait with the Agency have remained noticeably excellent. IV. LOCAL INTERESTS. (a) Customs. —A full report on the imports and exports for the year will be found in the Kuwait Trade Report, a non-confidential publication. The customs duty remained at 5 per cent., except for imports by British subjects which stays at 4 per cent. (6) Improvements. —In May, the Ruler has ordered for the building, at his expenses, of stone and cement arched bazaars to replace the booths of the Bedouin market which stood on his property. Work was completed on some 150 shops. (c) Politics. —During the year under review, Kuwait was suffering from an attack of infantile democracy due partly to better communications, the radio and the advent of the Oil Company. The year under review was a troubled one for Kuwait in regard to internal agitation. Though the Shaikh at his accession had promised the people of Kuwait that he would rule with the aid of a Council, as had his ancestor the great Shaikh Mubarak, he did not form one, and, on the contrary, ruled entirely autocratically without even consulting his own family.27 In March a strong agitation against the Shaikh broke out, which, however he succeeded in suppressing without there being actual riots. His Majesty's Government thereupon advised the Shaikh that he would be wise to associate his people more with himself in the Government of his State, according to Arab traditions bv the formation of a nominated advisory Council such as had existed in the days of Shaikh Mubarak. The Shaikh disregarded this advice and in August there was again an outburst of agitation to which the Shaikh completely surrendered and an elected executive Council was form ed by the people of Kuwait which drew up a Constitution for the State depriv ing: the Shaikh of most of his powers. His Majesty's Government informed the Shaikh and the Council that the relations of His Majesty s Government with the State would be conducted with the Shaikh, and that by the virtue of the latter's treaties with His Majesty's Government the conduct of the foreign affairs of the State would continue to remain in the hands of His Majesty s Government. The Council accepted this decision. At the end of the year there was again some trouble over the newly formed Council. On the 17th December the Ruler decided, in view of growing popu lar opposition to the arbitrary use of its power, to dissolve the Council. There was a tense day and a critical situation resulted since the Council had apparently determined to remain in power at all costs. His Highness was equally adamant for dissolution, but eventually agreed to have a new election The Council gave way and fresh elections took place. 20 members instead ol 14 have now been elected, with Shaikh Abdulla as Salim as Subah, C.I.E., as President once again. The Council had not met before the close of the year. (d) Education. —During November the local authorities decided upon free education in the four existing Government Boys' schools and in the one Government Girls' school. The number of trained teachers, from Palestine, was doubled and two Palestinian school-mistresses were brought in for the Girls' school. (e) Hospital. —The Government have, during the period under review, consulted an architect with regard to the building of the Kuwait State Free Hospital. A site has been selected and the cost is estimated to be about £6,000. The work has, however, not been started. (/) Imperial Aivways. —Owing to the inauguration of the All-Cp air mail service by flying boats, operation of the aeroplanes of Imperial Air. ways through Kuwait has been discontinued, but it is expected to recommence in 1939. {a) Commercial.—{i) Boats—A note on the number, tonnage etc. of boats built during the year will be found in the Trade Report for 1937. Ihe famous boat building industry continues to improve and the yards were kept busy throughout the year. (n) Pearls. —The price of pearls is as low as hitherto, with no sign of rise. ( m) Lamb skins.— Buying agents of various firms arrived during the year to purchase black lamb skins, which have fallen in price 4his year ; the finest quafity, equivalent to the Bokhari, being at one time only Rs. 4. {h) Tribal trade with Kuwait.— During the year under report, all the Be douins of Nejd in the vicinity of the frontier have received permission from Ibn Saud to restock at Kuwait. (i) Quarantine. —The Agency Medical Officer continued to be the Kuwait Qurantine Officer. The quarantine buildings were kept in good condition during the year. (j) Loud-speaker radios are now permitted in coffee shops where the Ruler had hitherto forbidden them. V. CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY. Law and order have remained unchanged. Security in the hinterland continued to be good during the year. The lack of early rain in Central Arabia brought unusually large number of Bedoums to Kuwait and North-East Nejd. 23 (S) EAD28 VI. FOREIGN RELATIONS. (а) Saudi Arabia. —King Ibn Saud sent a private invitation to the Ruler of Kuwait to visit him in the new palace at Riyadh. The Ruler replied that if he could, he would visit him about the last week in Ramadhan, but event ually the visit was postponed until the spring of 1939. (б) The Saudi trade blockade of Kuwait continued throughout the year. Towards the close of the year, however, the Saudi Government took up a more reasonable attitude in the negotiations on the subject, and there were hopes of the settlement of this long-standing question. (c) Aftermath of the Ikhwan Revolt, 1928-30. —Shaikh Multaq as Sur of the Mutair received the King Ibn Saud's pardon and invitation to return to him. He left Kuwait for Riyadh on the 23rd May, after some 8 years' exile in Kuwait. Iraq. —One case of incursion by Iraqi police cars into Kuwait territory in the neighbourhood of Qashaniya and Hanibiyah occurred in June. No satis faction was forthcoming from the Iraqi Government in reply to the protest made in regard to it. VII. PRESS. The Iraqi Press contini ed to publish hostile attacks on Kuwait during the year. In this connection the Shaikh of Kuwait having complained especially against the paper A1 Sejil of Basrah, the Iraq Government authorised its postal authorities to refuse to accept it for transmission to Kuwait. VIII. OIL. The difficulty found in boring the well at Burgan, 35 miles south of Kuwait Town, owing to fissures, with consequent loss of mud circulation, has been overcome. On the 13th October, oil was struck in No. 2 well of a similar quali ty and depth (3,750 feet) to that found some-time before in No. 1 well in the same neighbourhood. Pressure is also likely to be about the same and prospects for oil development in Kuwait are now definitely bright. His Highness the Shaikh was invited to witness the Burgan well producing oil. IX. ROYAL NAVY. His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief on board H.M.S. Norfolk visited Kuwait between the 1st and 3rd December. The Ruling family and the notables of the place were invited by His Excellency to visit him and see the ship. These visits to the ship were very much appreciated. Various other visits were paid by His Majesty's ships, sloops of the Per sian Gulf Division, during the year. X. ROYAL AIR FORCE. {a) Aircrafts of the Royal Air Force landed at Kuwait as usual in the course of their ordinary routine duties during the year under review. (6) A bomber-transport aircraft with petrol nearly exhausted landed on the 7th July on the shore ten miles south of Kuwait Town without any damage. The Political Agent went to the spot and rendered assistance. (c) Exercises with Kuwait forces. —During the year under review, an exer cise in co-operation with the Shaikh's forces was carried out near Kuwait by No. 4 Section Armoured cars from Shaiba under Wing Commander T. E. Ivons. Aircraft of No. 84 Squadron was also present for the operation, the value of which was very much appreciated by the Ruling family and the notables of Kuwait.XI. VISITORS. Besides two visits from the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, one from the Residency Surgeon, Bushire, the visitors during the year included :— Abdul Aziz, Abdul M vjid and Mohomad Sa'id sons of the late Shaikh Khaza'al Khan of Mohammerah Lady Cox, D.

Ruler of Bahrain and Al Khalifah Family.—{i) His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin 'Isa al Khalifah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., made the Haj this year. He left Bahrain on the 2nd January 1938 for Bombay with an entourage of 80 persons en route to Jedda. He returned on the 2nd March 1938, and wa j warmly welcomed by the people. During the next few days a series of Arab dinners were given in his honour. In the hot weather the Shaikh became seriously ill and was persuaded to visit Kashmir for some weeks. He left for Kashmir on the 31st July 1938 accompanied by Dr. R. Holmes, the Agency Surgeon, and returned on the 13th September 1938 very much improved in health. During the absence of His Highness on both these occasions the affairs of the State were in charge of a Regency Council consisting of his brother Shaikh Abdullah bin 'Isa, his son Shaikh Salman bin Hamad and the Adviser ^,0 the Bahrain Government. (n) Shaikh Abdullah bin 'Isa became President of the Manama Munici pality, on the retirement of Shaikn Mohammad bin ' Isa ; and Shaikh Salman was appointed as President of the Muharraq Municipality in place of Shaikh Abdullah. {Hi) Shaikh Khalifah bin Muhammad, nephew of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, was under Police training at Nasik during the year. {iv) Shaikh Abdullah bin Hamad visited England during the summer, where he studied English at Oxford. He returned with Mr. C. Dalrymple Belgrave in October. 4. Bahrain Police— Police. Indian Police . Arab Police Followers Strength on 1st January 31st December 1938.

The force is to be raised to 350 Non-Commissioned Officers and men. Three recruit sections are under training. A small permanent garrison is kept on Hawar Island. 5. Local Affairs.—{i) In September and October malcontents, making use of an incipient Nationalist movement manifesting itself (curiously enough) among the semi-educated youth of the Holi community (the Holis are of Persian extraction), succeeded in stirring up some agitation in the State. The agitators were able to make use of a general dissatisfaction in regard to the Bahrain Comts, and the Shia Shera Courts in particular, and an attempt was made to foster public dissatisfaction with the State educational system and with labour conditions in the Bahrain Peti oleum Company's premises. On the ring-leaders being arrested a premature strike took place among the local employees of the Oil Company, and a demonstration was organised in the Manama bazaar. The demonstrators were quickly dispersed and the strike failed. Meanwhile the Shia Shera Courts had been reformed and Shaikh Abdul Husain A1 Halli was appointed as Qadhi of a Shera Appeal Court. Other steps are under contemplation for the improvement of the Bahrain Courts in general, and also of the educational system of the State. The agitation came to an abrupt end with striking demonstrations of loyalty by the leading Arabs of Bahrain and by the Bahama of the villages.

This he undertook to do but certain interested persons in Dubai instigated the notables to prevent their deportation. At the same time con siderable excitement was caused by false stories of the intentions of His Majesty's Government in regard to emancipation of slaves, and a difficult situation arose. On the 2. r )th March the Political Agent and the Residency Agent met the Shaikh of Dubai and the notables in Majlis ; the policy of His Majesty's Government in regard to slaves was explained in detail and on the folly of their at'titude being pointed out the notables at once withdrew their opposition to the expulsion of the two arms smugglers who left Dubai shortly afterwards. (ft) During the sumner, there was considerable agitation in Dubai for reforms of a democratic nature, led by prominent members of the Al Bu Falasah, the Shaikhly family. The first outbreak, during which armed bedouin were called in by the Shaikh to help him against the hostile section of the Al Bu Falasah, ended in a promise by the Shaikh to grant certain concessions. In the next few months, however, during which both he and his brother. Shaikh Juma, visited the Political Agent and strove to obtain armed British intervention, it became clear that the Shaikh did not intend to implement his promises. Finally, open hostilities became imminent, and the Political Agent went to Dubai in H.M.S. Deptlord. By this time the Shaikh had lost all public support, and eventually an agreement was reached, providing for a State Majlis, over which the Shaikh himself would preside, a Municipality and other reforms. The relations of the state with His Majesty's Government remain in the hands of the Shaikh. (c) The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah has written an apology to the Senior Naval Officer for his refusal to call on His Majesty's sloops visiting Ras al Khaimah. {viii) Oil. —(a) On the 15th November a geological party of Petroleum Concessions Limited accompanied by Captain J. B. Howes, Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain left Sharjah for Baraimi. After getting as far as Baraimi through territory of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, they found the hinterland Shaikhs impossible to negotiate with (thanks in large measure to the intrigues of various Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast) ; and after surveying a small area, were obliged to return to the Coast on the 16th December. (ft) On the 9th December Mr. S. H. Longrigg, representing Petroleum Concessions Limited, obtained an exploratory option from the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah covering a maximum period of 3J years. (c) On the 22nd December, he obtained a 75 year concession from Shaikh Khalid, the Regent of Kalba. (d) Negotiations with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi for an oil concession were still in progress at the end of the year. H. WEIGHTMAN, Political Agent, Bahrain.38 CHAPTER VII. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE POLITICAL AGENCY, MUSCAT FOR 1938. Part I. . Major R. P. Watts, I.A., throughout the year with the exception of from 19th May to 12th July during which period he was on leave, and the post remained vacant. Military Assistant Surgeon C. E. Hynes, I.M.D., throughout the year. Mr. Nasirul Haq from 1st January to 19th March. Mr. M. H. Khan from 20th March to the end of the year. 2. {a) Agency Hospital.—'Yhe total number of patients treated during the year was 7,968 of which 7,863 were ' out-patients ' and 105 ' in-patients The daily average attendance being 27 • 5. 103 minor operations were carried out during the year. There were no outbreaks of any epidemics. Malaria, eye, skin and diseases of the digestive system continued to be prevalent. (6) Quarantine. —No Quarantine restrictions were imposed against any port during the year. No cases of notifiable diseases were discovered on any steamer using this port. The Quarantine station is in a bad state of repairs but His Highness the Sultan has promised to have the necessary work put in hand early next year. 3. Political Situation. —The Political Situation remained quiet and without incident throughout the year. The Sultan steadfastly pursued his policy of endeavouring to increase bv peaceful means his influence and authority over tne interior ol the country in general and the Oman in particular. Resumption of the Muscat Gov ernment's control over the Oman is probably the great ambition of the Sultan's life. The method adopted has been to get into touch with various Shaikhs and Leading men of those districts of the State boidering the Oman proper who if not directly under the control of the Imam have hitherto been certainly more influenced by him than by the Sultan. In August Shaikh Mohsin bin Zahran of the Siyabi Tribe, in September Shaikh Hamad bin Mohammad of the Tal Hibi and in October Shaikh Ahmad bin Mohammad al Yahyayi of the Zahra were the more important of the Tribal Sheikhs who visited the Sultan in Muscat and after being sumptuously entertained were sent back laden with substantial presents. The biggest success achieved by the Sultan in this connection was in being able to persuade the Head of the Beni P&gt;u Ali Tribe to come in to Muscat in the first week of October. This notorious tribe, which provides some of the best fighting material to be found anywhere in the State, occupies a peculiar position in that it is subservient neither to the Imam of Oman nor to the Sultan. It has, in fact, for many years enjoyed virtual independence. A portion of Sur, the largest town and port in the State belongs to the Tribe and their position here and on the flank of the main trade route between the Oman and the coast together with the warlike qualities of the tribe make them one of the most formidable and strongest factors in State politics. Sheikh Ah who was accompanied by forty followers stayed some two weeks in Muscat where he was treated as a very honoured guest of the Sultan. The expenses of his visit are believed to be not less than Rs. 14,000 which amount, to a State in the poor financial position oi Muscat, is a not inconsider - able sum. The Sultan has in fact being buying the goodwill of the tribes of the interior and the only means which have enabled him to adopt this policy is the comparatively large sums he received from Petroleum Concessions. Ltd., in 1937 in return for his grant to them of an oil exploratory concession in Muscat and Dhofar. 1. Agency Officials— Political Agent . Medical Officer . Treasury Officer .39 The further success of this plan will in all probability depend on the result of the search for oil in the State. Should this be successful and a steady source of income be assured to the Sultan, provided he continues to eel his way cautiously, as he has hitherto done, it would not be by any means outside the bounds of possibility that Saiyid Said will be the first ot nis dynasty since its famous founder of the same name to be the real ruler ot the whole of his Sultanate. tj . Treat y of Commerce, Friendship, and Navigation between Wis Majesty s Government and the Sultan was renewed for the last time on its due date, i.e. February 11th. Negotiations for the New Treaty, to replace that of 1891, which had been commenced in Muscat and India in 1937 were carried to their closing stages in London during His Highness' visit to England in the autumn of 1938. 1 he few lemaining points requiring amendments and corrections were agreed upon between His Majesty's Government and the Sultan at the end of the year and the r l reaty in its final form was ready in December for signature which is to be carried out early in the new year. 4. Oil Concessions.—{a) Muscat Oil. —Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., who had obtained an oil concession in the Arabian territories of the Sultanate and in the Province of Dhofar commenced explorations in the last quarter of the year. ^ On the 18th October Mr. S. H. Longrigg, General Manager arrived in Muscat to make arrangements for a party of geologists of his Companv to carry out a survey. He had several discussions with His Highness in which details or the journies to be made by land and by air were discussed Mi Longrigg left for Bahrain on the 5th November. Thompson and Mr. Hotcbkiss, geologists of the Company arrived on 1st November. K. S. Hasan Mohammad Saleh of Aden, Interpreter having arrived a week earlier. ^ ie g eo ^gical party left Muscat on 4th November by motor boat for Khabura whence they carried out a journey into the interior visitin^ Yanqul Hafit and Baraimi and returning to Muscat on 4th December. The attitude ot the Sheikhs and tribes of the districts traversed, with minor exceptions was friendly and helpful. 1 ' 1 According to unofficial information received from the Senior Geologist the result ot the explorations of the country towards the west of the Sultanate was disappointing as far as the districts of Yanqul, Hafit and Baraimi were concerned but it was said that the regions between those places and the coast were worthy of further examination. The Geological party left for Rass al Hadd by motor dhow on the 18th De cember where they were met by the Company's aeroplane which had flown out trom Lngland a few days previously. Aerial surveys over a period of tour days were carried out over the interior. They returned on the 25th December having abandoned their original intention of proceeding with the reconnaissances to the south for the reason that the motor dhow hired as a tender vessel was unsuitable for the purpose. It was then decided to arrange for passing Tankers to carry out the work of moving personnel and stores irom one base camp to another. On 26th December the Companv's aero plane arrived in Muscat and on 27th December made a two nours flight over the mterior The same day Mr. Hotchkiss, geologist, Mr. Barnes, Mechanic, and K S. Hasan bin Saleh, Interpreter left for Sharjah by slow mail, and Mr. Thompson, Senior Geologist and Mr. Eden, Photographer followed bv aeroplane the next day for the purpose of consulting the Local General Manager in regard to future plans.

Watts embarked on 9th December reaching Masirah on the 11th. Survey work was carried out between 12th and 19th December, the party landing each day on various parts of the south west coast of the island. The attitude of the local inhabitants met with on the island both at Umm Rasas and other places was friendly. Medical treatment of sick persons by the ship's Surgeon while the ship was in the Masirah Channel helped considerably in maintaining friendly relations with the islanders. The challenger left for India on the 19th December to spend Christmas in Karachi. She will be returning to Masirah Channel early next year to complete the survey. B. Royal Air Force. —The R. A. F. maintained their wireless station at Muscat throughout the year. The staff consists of one Non-Commissioncd Officer and 3 operators from 203 (F. B.)

Aviation General. —Imperial Airways station at Gwadur was moved to Jiwani in Kalat State in the month of May 1938.

The aerodrome at Gwadur is no longer maintained and supplies of fuel are not now available there. 9. Foreign Interest. —(a) The French Consulate remained closed through out the year.

Ruling Family.—[a) His Highness Saiyid Said bin Taimur—During 1938 His Highness carried out a world tour which he had commenced with his official visit to India at the end of 1937. Leaving India in November 1937 the Sultan travelled via Singapore to Japan where he visited his father Saiyid Timur, the late Sultan, who has settled permanently at Kobe. The Sultan's visit to Japan was private and apparently no discussions took place between him and any Japanese officials. After a stay of just over a month in that country the Sultan left in the end of January for the United States disembarking at San Francisco on 15th February. After visiting various places of interest including Hollywood—a most important place in the eyes of the Sultan who is a keen critic of the cinema—His Highness arrived in Washington on 10th March where he was the guest of the United States Government for some days and had an interview with President Roosevelt. On 28th M -rch His Highness arrived in England where he was a guest of His Majesty's Government for the first fortnight of his stay. Ihe Sultan was granted an audience with His Majesty the King who conferred on him the title of K.C.I.E. There seems no doubt that the Sultan thoroughly enjoyed and was appreciative of the varied and comprehensive programme of entertainment arranged for him by the Government Hospitality Board and his visit to England can be described as a distinct success. Since his return to Muscat the Sultan has several times stated how much he enjoyed himself in that country and how sorry he was that his visit could not have been considerably longer. After a short visit of some two weeks to France in April, where he was received by the President of the French Republic, His Highness returned to England on 19th April and left on 1st May via Italy and India for Muscat, which he eventually reached on 13th July 1938. (6) Saiyid Nadir, the senior member of the ruling family, as in the past, did not take any part in State affairs and due to his poor state of health lived practically*a retired life. At the end of the year he was obliged to go to India for medical treatment and after two months stay in Bombay he returned to Muscat at the close of the year. (c) Saiyid Shahab, who is a real uncle of the S^ultan, acted on various occasions during the year as the latter's representative during the Sultan's absence from the State. {d) Saiyid Hamad, remained Wali of Matrah throughout the year. (e) Saiyid Mahmud, who had been unemployed since his dismissal from the post of Wali of Matrah in February last year secretly left for Zanzibar in a sailing boat in the first week of February. He was accompanied by his two brothers Khalid and Said. After being ship-wrecked off Ras-al-Had, the party arranged to make their way to Socotra, where it is believed they are still living. The Sultan received an insolent letter from Saiyid Mahmud written from Socotra in which he declares the reason for he and his brothers leaving the State was the unfair treatment received from the Sultan. This statement has no foundation of truth and the State will not be the loser by the departure of these three individuals. (/) Saiyid Tariq, half brother of the Sultan who arrived at Muscat at the close of last year, accompanied His Highness on his tour as far as Japan in order to visit his father, Saiyid Taimur, the former Sultan whom he had not seen since he was a child. „ 2.
