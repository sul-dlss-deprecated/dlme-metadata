These enquiries reveal thi there was no violation of the Afghan frontier by British aircraft on the 14th December 1943, ll^h or 18th January 1944. If you see no JU^'r objection the Afghan Government may be informed 'l 7 in suitable terms of the result of the enquiries „ by the Air Officer Commanding, 223 Group.

A careful check has also been made of the flying carried out by the Communication Flight at Peshawar. Here again, there is no evidence of any aircraft which could have crossed the Frontier at the times and places under consideration. 7. There is little doubt that, when cases of Frontier violation are reported, aircraft have, in fact, been seen somewhere overhead. At the same time, it will be noticed that, in most cases, the positions have been very close to the Frontier and the aircraft have been repo] 14th Decembc high. aircraft rted as flying For example, on 14th December, 1943, the j was reported as ’’flying at a great height', on 3rd January, 1944, the height was about 9000 feet and on the 11th January, 1944, it was about 6000 feet. *8. I have frequently noticed that, to the uninitiated, a high flying aircraft invariably aopears to be directly cverhesd when, in fact, it may be some miles away. I suggest therefore, that m many of these alleged violations, the aircraft observed may '«&gt;i have crossed the Frontier at all. 9. I am satisfied that Frontier Flying Regulations are adequate and tnat they are constahily brought to the notice of all pilots. At the same time, I would point out how readily an inexperienced pilot can lose his bearings over this rugged country in bad weather, particularly as the Frontier line is unmarked/- •••••••••- 3 - urmarked and very irregular. “ The handling of a high speed aircraft under such conditions calls for a very high standard of flying and an intimte knowledge of the country whici* can only be obtained by experience.

The Afghan Government have now asked for payment of a um of Afghanis 9793.35 in connection with the internment of Flying Officer .Tosher and Sergeant Robinson. They have given the following details:- Expenses of board and lodging in the Jalalabad hotel from 7th to 17th Sartan(30th June to 10th July 1943) Afghanis 1245.12 motor transport fare from Jalalabad to Kabul ' 687.50 Cost of two suits M 137.25 ooard expenses of the Kabul Hotel from 18th dartan to 20th . izan(llth July to 14th October 1943) ' 3854.70 Rent of the residence from 11th July to 14th October 1943 M 3874.78 Total Afghanis 9739.35 3. His Majesty*s minister considers that the charge for board and lodging at Jalalabad (the first item) is high, amounting as it does to about Afghanis 62 per head per diem ana he feels that there would be justification in asking for details of this. Prime facie the claim for transport from Jalalabad to v abul (the second item) is somewhat unreasonable but the I egaticn itself pressed the Afghan Government to bring the airmen up to Kabul as early as possible, and against this claim His Majesty’s hiulster notes that no claim has been made for transport on th^ return journey from habul to Torkham, nor for board' and lodging en route, though it Is not of course impossible that a supplementary claim may be preferred later. The most clearly questionable item is the cost of two suits(the third item) since, so far as this Legation Is aware, all purchases of clothes (were made by the legation - cf. the first item in the enclosure to It }«• 4. As a whole, however, His Majesty’s Tinister finds the claim not really excessive and he suggests that, in spite of what has been st ted above an hearing in mind nara^raeh 2 oil .• to : or. r-nn, the e? inr- s ■ now be ' without rtion except in P cl of th y two suits for which payment should only be made if the Afghan Govern ment can satisfy this I egation that th &lt;j charge is indeed in order. 5.

When Flying Officer Mosher and Sergeant Robinson reached Kabul and were interned here clothes were lent to them and toilet articles, tobacco, cigarettes -ana other necessaries and comforts were given to them by His -MaJ esty 1 s Minister and other members of the Legation. 3. ,vhcn, however, it became evident that their stay would be of some duration, even if they were eventually released before the termination of hostilities, it was decided that they could not be expected to subsist indefinitely on an odd assortment of borrowed clothes. Accordingly, under the orders of His Majesty’s Minister, a minimum of summer cl&amp;thes were made or purchased for them in Kabul. It was also decided that 'there was no reason why they should continue to be supplied throughout their stay with toilet articles, cigarettes and so on as private gifts from members of tbe Legation. Nor would they themselves have wished this, accordingly their requirements were thereafter purchased for them and an account kept of expenditure on their behalf, a statement of account is enclosed in duplicate. It should perhaps oe made clear that whatever was given to them at the outset of their stay is not included in the account, and that they have of course taken away with them the clothes made ox* purchased in Kabul though, in sriew of the shortcomings of Kabul as a supply centre, the clothes are scarcely of a type which could be worn by them in India even if they had occasion there to wear plain clothes. 4. The charge in Afghanis for postage stamps is, it will be seen, large. It is accounted for mainly by the fact that the Afghan postage charges for air mail letters to Canada are exorbitant. The matter was taken up informally with the Afghan Foreign office when 'this charge came to notice. But they have quoted the rates laid down in accordance with which the postage charges were levied and the calculations are correct. In the meanwhile the Afghan Guard in charge of the interned airmen had paid the postage ana the letters had been despatched. There was no course therefore but to re-imburse him. In these circumstances, while it was con sidered appropriate in the first instance for the letters of the interned airmen to be sent through the Afghan post, latterly letters which they wanted to send have been despatched through the Legation post. 5., It is requested that a sum of Bs.820/12/- - i.e. Rs.770/4/-, being the equivalent of Afghanis 2695.90 at the current official rate of exchange of Afghanis 3.50 to the rupee, plus Rs.50/8/- may kindly be sent to this Legation at an early date. If it is proposed to recover any part of this from Flying Officer Mosher / and Sergeant Robinson, it is hoped that so f^r as the clothes are concerned the consideration stated at the end of paragraph 3 above will be borne prominently in mind. Ho attempt has been made to keep a separate account for each and if recovery is to be m&amp;ae in respect of any item it should, it is suggested, be made on an &lt; equal basis unless they wish otherwise. 6. The Afghan Government will no doubt shortly make a claim for the board and lodging of the two airmen and perhaps for otrier _ r/_ rM - , &lt;v» P . X .

The Afghan Government have given some indications recently that they are prepared to release the two British airmen who were interned when a British aircraft force-landed in Afghan territory on 3€&gt;th June, providing that they can justify their action to their tribesmen. It is possible that the Afghan Government wish to retain these two airmen in Kabul until the Independence Celebrations are over, and when their presence in Kabul has been duly registered by tribal visitors, the Afghan Government will be glad to be relieved of their responsibility for accommodating and feeding them.Extract from a letter to Mr. Weight man 16th October 194.5 * f v * Ext # 6071 When I got back I found that the Afghan government had kept their word about the two airmen and they made no bones about allowing them out to come and stay with me for their last two days here. They have just left for Peshawar by the Afghan Mail as the M.F.A. did not want them to remain in the country now they are at liberty# We are now going into the question of the machine.Translation of Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ note no.3386 dated 16th Hizan 1322( lOth October 1943) to His majesty's Legation, &amp;abul. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Royal afghan Government present their compliments to His Britannic Majesty’s Legation, Kabul, and, in reply to that Legation’s note no,244/D, dated the 28th September 1943, and as a result of a number of discussions held between the Foreign Ministry Authorities and His Britannic Majesty’s Legation, have the honour to state that the question of the landing of a British aircraft with two airmen has been under the close examination or the competent authorities of the Royal Afghan Government. The aircraft and its crew had been interned because of the prevailing war conditions, in which His Britannic .jesty’s Government and the Government of India are belligerent powers and the Royal Afghan Government is a neutral one. However, as the British Legation have written in their note no.244/D, dated the 28th September 1943, it has become quite clear from a careful examination of the matter by the Afghan competent authorities, that the aircraft in question was only a training machine whose aviators, being personnel under training, were engaged in a training flight, ( when, having inadvertently crossed the air space into Afghanistan, they were forced to land in Afghan territory, owing to shortage of petrol. Furthermore, as there is no battle-field in this part of the world or contiguous to this country (Afghanis tan), and, again, as ther€ is no probability whatsoever that this aircraft had undertaken its^ flight for the purpose of bombardment or for other warlike operations, nor was it armed for any such purpose, so it can rightly be regarded as a Civil aircraft. Further, the Royal Afghan Government have also considered the attitude of the Swiss Government in regard to a training aircraft of Germany, as well as* the reply, dated the 24th March 1942, made by that Government to His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and as a result*, have decided to permit this training aircraft and its “ a. airmen to return to India.

The Government which interns foreign Service personnel is entitled to recover the cost of their maintenance from the country to which they belong at the end of the period of internment. But this is a minor point and I don’t think we need take it up at this stage. Mr. Beckett. (signed) I.T.M.Pihk. I agree. Surely Sir F.

Latter warning was I thinkMINUTE The attached telegram froia Sir P* TSyiie reports yet another complaint hy the Af ^ia.n Government of aerial violation of their territory* If paragraphs 1 and 2 refer to the snj.ie aircraft it seems that this flight may have been initiated hy a curious pilot anxious to see what had happened to the Vultee Vengeance and it is hoped that he -would he srdtahly admonished. Sir Francis Tfrlie has pointed out that these foster anti-British irritation almost more than aiv other matter. General Molesworth has suggested, in his note to Sir David Monteath,attached 'below, that we might take up the question with the Government of India and it seems that this is a very opportune moment following on the incident of the crashed Vengeance. We have had it in amt mindf in the past to do so and in fact on the occa.sion of the 'bombing incident we asked the Government of India to take all possible steps to ensure against a repetition. K Sir Francis 'Wylie also addressed the Government of India demi-officially s and we were atjfittfto add our own plea to his very strong one when we received the Goverrment of India*s letter of 19th August 1942, ^ and we decided that in view of their remarks in the la.st paragraph regarding instructions to pilots our letter need not go. Since then we have had a copy of the GovemmQnt of India *s letter to Kabul of 13th November 1942 * giving details of the arrangements made to prevent future accidental violation. These cover operational flights, visiting aircraft, and training flights and seem to be pretty comprehensive. Nevertheless since that date there have been several further violations, of which the Afghan Government have complained^as follows (l) 23rd January 1943* Training cross-country flight on which aircraft lost its bearings . 35 (g) One in June of which we have as yet no details (see paragraph 3 of latest telegram).

The Government of India are well aware of the serious need to prevent these incidents but there is little doubt that the R.A.F. do not take their responsibilities so seriously.

It is true that the Swiss have maintained that an unarmed aircraft not engaged on a v/arlike operation which makes a 1 orced landing in their country can be released with its crew, but this is a principle which Y/e, with the full C ? n ?? rre 5 1 ce of Air Ministry, have, consistently refused to acUiiit. throughout the war we have maintained that any military aircraft whatsoever, irrespective of its type and uhe nature ol che flight on which it was engaged, should, under international law, be interned if it makes an entry into neutral territory. ~ Thus we hardly think it is possible or wise to tell the Afghan Government that it would not be inconsistent with their obligations as neutrals to release the air crew in the present case. ^ Go far as our arrangements v/ith Portugal are concerned what happens in practice is that the aircraft is sold to the Portuguese and the crew, after formal internment, are allowed go escape. In this case also it would probably be unwise 00 go into any great detail v/ith the Afghan Government, though we can suggest to Wylie that if the Afghans insist on the letter of the law, the Portuguese example may offer the best solution. ^ ' I attach a revised draft to Kabul, of which I am sending a copy, together with a copy of this letter, to Low at the Air Ministry.

Forced landing in Afghanistan. H.M.G. have throughout the war consistently maintained the attitude that if a military aircraft belonging to a,belligerent makes an entry into neutral territory, both aircraft,and crew should be interned. This principle applies to all types of military aircraft, whether armed or unarmed, and whether on operational or non-operational flights.. H.M.G. have no intention at present of departing from this attitude. ~yv. ... ,2. * Nevertheless, there have been ^ffimy^instances of neutrals (particularly Switzerland, Sweden and Spain) releasing c rews/crews of belligerent military aircraft. The crew of an H.A.P, aircraft which crashed in South Persia in 1939 were allowed to leave by Persian authorities. 3. While'we cannot therefore claim that under international law the Afghans are entitled to release aircraft or crew, you should make what use you can of facts in paragraph 2 above to show that by releasing the crew the Afghan Government would not be the first to stretch a point in such circumstances. k» If Afghan Government insist that their duties'as neutrals-oblige them to intern crew, it would probably be best not to object but to seek to reach understanding' by which' they will first intern the crews and then-allow * them to ♦escape.

The aircraft was evidently on a training flight. Ther&gt; is no indication that it did any damage when it landed. If it did, the Government of India will certainly he ready to pay compensation but we need not raise this point now. Indeed* the only point which requires immediate consideration is that of the release of the air crew of two and the fate of the aircraft itself. We asked the Foreign Office and the Air Ministry for guidance as to international practice on these points. Apparently the normal rule of international practice is against us; t he air crew should be_interned at our expense^, until the end of the war, and the aircraft should also remain in , ., v until the end of the war, ana tne Afghan hands until the end of the war. But the Air Ministry letter of 4th July attached shows that a good many exceptions have been made, particularly by the Swiss and the Portuguese. It seems worth while putting these exceptions to the Afghan Government in the hope of securing the release of our men, the retention of whom cannot but be embarrassing to the Afghan Government in view of their shortage of suitable accomnodatiun. We might indicate to Sir F.Wylie without committing ourselves definitely, that we would be ready to consider handing over the aircraft itself to the Afghan Government as a make weight in his negotiations for the release of the airmen. c* V\a cVw &amp; V'v t v'^’b-e. e.'-. t*.*’*. d. *•'' Cc‘-Ari cf\f&gt; aV%oA otx oOysv &lt;5^ O • to v' 1 - voVvC.2* o^VvleXv^. us O'Cvtvrv ^ w-'* e-o- cs, &lt;1 %j-&lt;mvt,=ox-vt ^ ta«Cv- WvwCic-aVwX cVu CA&gt;Cv,.Draft telegram EXT. 5757/45 Ifroms Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, India Office.

Your letter to Mackenzie of July 3rd concerning the forced landing of a R.A.F. aircraft in Afghan territory 2, There seems to be no hard and fast rule governing the release of aircrews in these cases and the matter sometimes depends on the kind of task on v/hich the . aircraft is engaged v/hen it makes the forced landing. For instance, the Sv/iss have taken the view that an unarmed aircraft engaged on a training flight which makes a x forced landing in their country can be released together with its crew, 3, Both the Americans and ourselves have succeeded in making ad hoc arrangements with the Spaniards and Portuguese regarding the release of forced landed airmen but the flights on v/hich the latter were engaged were both operational and non-operational, e.g. ferrying. In the case of Spain and also of Sweden such releases have, I believe, in all cases been made against a corresponding release of interned Axis personnel though not necessarily of airmen. 4 4, You v/ill see that the matter is one v/hich can only be satisfactorily settled on the spot. No doubt if the Afghans v/ish to buy the aircraft and v/e are willing to sell it this v/ill yjrobably have some effect on the out come of the negotiations regarding the release of the crew.

This crash landing of a British aircraft about 15 miles inside Afghan territory is likely to be rather embarrassing. In view of the recent history of air violations of Afghan territory, and the general neutrality policy of the Afghan Government, they are likely to interpret their rights and obligations as neutrals in this matter rather rigidly. Before attempting to draft instructions to H.M. Minister, Kabul, we would be glad of the advice of the Foreign Office as to the position in international law in regard to the various aspects“of the case; Meanwhile we shall probably get some comments from the Government of India which we can take into account. There have, of course, been previous forced landings. For example in 1928 an Afghan aeroplane containing two Russian airmen crashed in the Kurram. We ?/ere ready to provide spare parts for its repair but it was too badly damaged for local repair, and it was sent back to Afghanistan together with the two Russian airmen. Similarly, in 1930, when a British aeroplane forced landed near Basawal (where the present incident occurred), both the machine and its crew were returned to India. In 1929 &amp; British aeroplane engaged in the evacuation of personnel from Kabul during the Afghan civil war, crashed near Jalalabad. The crew were flown from Jalalabad to India by an R.A.F.machine sent up for the purpose, and their aeroplane was abandoned. These incidents, however, occurred in peace-time and are presumably irrelevant in present circumstances. Oppenheir^s International law is not much use in this case. Chapter II (iv) of Volume II deals with prisoners of war who take refuge in neutral territory, fugitive soldiers and bodies of men who take refuge in order to evade captivity. It does not, however, deal with aircraft and their occupants who arrive in neutral territory by accident when they are not engaged in operations of war. In the present case we can scarcely hope lor the return of the crashed aircraft, at any rate until after the war. In these ^ circumstances we might consider presenting it to the Afghans i- it is repairable. As regards the crew, it will be extremely difficult for the Afghans to keep them under restraint, because they have no suitable /accommodation /accommodation for European inxernees . We should certainly do everything possible to secure their release and for this purpose we would be grateful if the Foreign Office would give us a full note of the circumstances in which the airmen who have forced landed in Portugal have been released. If we cannot secure their release, we might offer to let them take up work as instructors with the Afghan Air Force, the Govern ment of India paying their salaries. The Afghan Air Force already have an officer of the R.A.F. as instructor. It will be seen that H.M.Minister, Kabul, wishes very urgent instructions. yvuv. i - —* -—*V JWmi) TKLBQRAM OPY ^ 0/7 r--. .-i q C) 0 W, SaCB^X 25620 (If in any oase tha communication of the contents of this document- to any person outside Government Service is authorised^ it must be paraphrased)&lt;&gt; Allotted to external Denartment c Gopies Circulated and to Foreign Office^ , CYPHER T E L E G R AM From His Ma 3 es ty 5 s Minis ter ?

I had heard myself that we violated Swiss territory pretty often on our bombing flights to Germany and North Italy and I realise that - putting it mildly - nothing should be done to encourage the Afghans to make a fuss about the not infrequent violations of their territory along the Indian frontier. There seem to me however to be two principal differences between (a) Sweden/switzerland and fb) Afghanistan. In the first place the violations in Europe take place in the course of active operations against the enemy. The Inaian violations of Afghan territory take place on the other hand in an area remote - so far - from a 1^1 ^ active operation s. K secondly, I have a feeling that the adverse repercussions on the Government here are more serious than in the case of either Switzerland or Sweden. However much the Swiss or the Swedes may hate the air above their national territory being violated by belligerent machines they must realise well enough that there is nothing that their Governments can do aDout it i and they are probably in their heart of hearts glad that the war &gt; has so far not touched them more closely.* Here violations oi Aighan territory are liable to lead to all sorts of rumours and murmurings e.g. t/w **'* r '*' * I (a) that the Prime Minister is only a creature of the British anyway and (b) that the Government is so weak that it dare not protest etc. etc * % . t ttijJ •-'•h* Arf as far as 1 am concerned myself if I have let an occasional note of impatience appear in my telegrams you should 1 think remember the local facts. When one of these things happens I have to traipse along to the Foreign Office sometimes at the end of a very preemptory ft telephone message there to take a sort of pompous rating from aH ^Moliammaci Khan on the subject. 1 have often to tell the same Ali Mohammad Khan the truth about certain other matters in no uncertain terms, ne is therefore in his element when an aerial violation comes along and thoroughly enjoys himself at my expense. I cannot of course answer back because although no enquiries will have yet taken place in inaia 1 know already in my bones that the Royal Air Force must have been at it again, as I have suggested earlier in this letter if the K.a.F. were coming and going from thousand bomber raids when the violations occur 1 could defend them with a very light heart indeed 1 When the violations occur just in practice l| flights or what not it is not as X think you will agree quite so 1 easy. However i will do my best to discourage the Afghans from faking these violations over seriously. 1 have done it in the past in fact and will continue my efforts without of course mentioning anything about either Switzerland or Sweden. 2 . uaroe 1 am sending copies of this letter to Peel and Yours sincerely, Sd/~ F.V.Wylie.

It seems that an aircraft on a cross country training flight lost its bearings and finally came down at Miranshah. In spite of the Government of India’s recent instructions set out in Ext.6597/42, violations by training crews are bound to happen from time to time alUjoughwarnings given to pilots and the corridor rules should reduce them to a minimum. The Government of India state that adequate disciplinary action has been taken. This statement is probably made more to satisfy the Afghan Government who asked, as usual;that the pilot be punished.

I would not be surprised if some such thought was in their heads and in the heads of the Afghan Government as well. I had a go at Ali Mohd. about the inclusion of a mosque in the reported damage. I told him straight that he never mentioned this to me in the beginning and that I thought that it was gravely unwise to have put it in the communique. He said that when he was talking to me he had forgotten about the mosque and that of course the Afghan Government had no desire whatsoever to aggravate the incident or anything like that. I said nothing but did my best to register incredulity. Actually we think that the communique was drafted by Najibullah Khan a little twirp in the Foreign Office whom I heartily distrust. It was he who broadcast on I was very interested to see the remark further down in the review that the behalf/ Abehalf of the Afghan Government after we got the Axis nationals out last October c and he. succeeded in making a not ve^y im proper paper sound very bellicose indeed. •f. j v V ♦Copy of Demi-Official letter No.244/V dated 12th December 1941, from His Majesty's Minister, Kabul, to O.K.Caroe Esquire,CSI., CIE., Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, ' T ew De3Jhi. My dear Caroe, j I have had some talk with eightman^ about alleged violations of the Afghan frontier by R.A.F.planes. I attach a list of complaints received from the Afghan Government since June last. Ahe number of these complaints seems to me to suggest that possibly the Afghan frontier has been occasionally trans gressed. Do you think that it would be possible to give me rather more detailed material for a reply when these complaints are referred to you ? In one case recently the fghan Government went so far as to suggest that the pilot was lying in order to save himself from disciplinary action when he denied that he had crossed the frontier ! I am letting this pass for the moment but if they try again I shall have to retort, it would help me however in dealing with these complaints if you could give me rather more details e.g. about the nature of the enquiry held, circumstances if any which made a violation of the'frontier on the particular date stated impossible and so on. On general grounds we should obviously not take complaints of this nature too lightly and in this connection you may wish to refer to Maconaehie's memorandum No.244 dated 6th November 1930 and connected correspondence.

These are strictly controlled as to routes and targets. All aircraft at present located in Waziristan are of old types (i.e. types whipse speed itself is unlikely to lead to unintentional violation of the Frontier) and are manned by air-crews which know the Frontier well. 2) ¥isiting aircraft. These may be aircraft carrying inspecting officers or aircraft being ferried for storage or replacement. Corridor lines of entry to Peshawar, Kohat, Miranshah and Quetta have been laid down as in the attached instruct!on. 3) Training flights. Modern aircraft are at present based at Hi sal pur and will be based at Peshawar in order to train new crews in operational methods.^ Strict instructions have been issued that these aircraft are not to pass beyond the hills bordering the Peshawar valley except towards the East. 2.

It is requested that if His Majesty’s Minister sees no objection, the above may idndly be explained to the Afghan Government.\ We have been conrsidering whether we could give you any \ material based on our experience 'in dealing with other neutral countries, which v/ould help you in replying to the Afghan Government’s complaints about our air violations of their territory. Unfortunately, most of the information on this subject is of a kind which cannot be communicated to the Afghan Government, and in any case we can hardly tell one foreign Government how badly we treat another’ The following details about Switzerland and Sweden are therefore for your confidential information and guidance only, and should not in any circumstances be passed on to the Afghans. S witz e rland . R.A.F. aircraft from time to time violate Swiss territory on flights to Germany and North Italy. Hitherto the policy of the Air Ministry has not X been/ to route aircraft over neutral territory, but in case of bad weather the aircraft often fly over Swiss territory. The Swiss Government protest and we give assurances stating that the violations of Swiss territory are unintentional and due to errors of navigation on account of bad weather, etc. It is not often that British aircraft violate Swedish neutrality, though in the course of sea-mining operations in the Baltic (particularly in the narrow channels between Ben* ark and Sweden) it has happened from time to time that mines have been laid in error in Swedish territorial waters. Though air crews are instructed, if possible, to avoid violating Swedish waters or territory, it is extremely difficult to make absolutely certain of not doing so. The Air Ministry have repeatedly pointed out to us the importance attached to keeping these Baltic channels mined and have more than once expressed their anxiety 'that, while carrying out mining operations in n the Baltic in the difficult conditions which so often prevail 'there, our air crews should remain unhampered as far as 'possible by restrictive orders.' ’ e therefore do our best to soothe the Swedes whenever necessary, and offer suitable apologies. From this you will see that air violations of neutral territory have come to be a fairly regular feature of the v/ar; but they have not so far resulted in any serious complications in our relations with the countries concerned. We hope therefore that you may be able to find ways of inducing the Afghan Government to refrain from playing up such incidents. At the same time we fully sympathise with your difficulties, and. are sorry not to be able to give you some ammunition which you could put to direct use. Sweden.

This plane was flying at a *Kunar» area, at a low altitude at Jalalabad altitude in the *Rodat* area. . . It is regretted that today I have received further information saying tiiat on the 5th Mizan 1321 (27.9.42) another British plane violated Afghan territory from the air in *Banshi* and flying over the M.algam Pass* and thence *Asmar», *Sholtan , , ‘Marur* and *Chagha Serai*, then crossing the river over *Sarkani* carried on its transgressive flight to*Dev Gul Pass* and thence to *Bavil Pass*. Then continuing its flight over ’Shewah *, *Dasht Gambiri*, *Laghman River*, * Pul-i-Darauntah * and the‘Kabul River* near Jalalabad, made for *Lalpurah* and then eventually flew out of Afghan territory near *^halman*, at 10—i0(A.M* ?) • This plane was a three engined machine. Through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, trie Royal Afghan Government have made repeated representations about tire illegal flights of British planes. They have also asked by means of discussions end v ritten communications for these flights to be stopped, but it is regretted that instead of putting an end to this illegality, which is also inconsistent with the friendly relations and respect of Afghan territory on a basis of “Bon Yoisinage**, the British pilots have become more bold and dauntless in their flights. I have been instructed by my Government to tender a strong protest to Your Excellency’s Government. The transgression of the British aircraft has created misunderstandings among the inhabitants. It has also resulted in their feelings being aroused and in causing indignation. I anticipate that Your Excellency will ask your Government to furnish details of these aerial transgressions as well as the object underlying them. The Afghan Government can no longer restrict this question of ’attfe^Lal transgression* to mere discussions taking, place between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Kis Majesty’s Legation, the other hand ’they will be powerless to stop the Afghan newspapers and all other means of communication (from giving publicity to these facts). The .Afghan Government regret that contrary to their wishes they have not succeeded in stopping these violations by British planes. I hope that the above explanations will make Your Excellency’s Government devote more attention to the gravity of the situation ’ e unbecoming conduct of the British pilots and will induce serious attention, on the analogy of the Afghan Government, Cn Pay the them to so that Britain ^ will not^ become, obscure (hits will remain clear) and having done this they will ensure a permanent and positive discontinuance the present state of affairs. friendly relations obtaining between Afghanistan and Great of v ith respects etc./3 D* u * Mo • 244/V' British Legation, i^abul n - r‘. 12th December P1tv Bay dear Caroe X have had some talk with weightmah about alleged violations of the Afghan frontier by h.a.

Sir Reginald Maxwell, Home Member, rising in the Assembly today to move that the House take into consideration the very grave situation that has arisen in the country since the passing of the All-India Congress Committee's resolution of August's, dwelt on extent of the damage caused and the extreme seriousness at one uiak. of the position in the areas most affected. He said: 'I must explain that our knowledge is not yet complete The disturbances are very recent; they are not-yet at an end, and at any rate in the areas most affected, the Provincial Governments and their officers are still closely engaged in restoring or preser ving order and taking precautions against fresh acts of violence.

One violation on 22nd. September at about 1 p.m is admitted, whereas the Afghans allege two violations of which one was at about 7 a*m* and the other at a time not specified. No violation can be traced on 27th September despite the very circumstantial account given of it in Katodon 196 and the fact that H.M. Consul at Jalalabad saw an aircraft over the city on that day. Nevertheless I can see nothing for it but for Sir F. tylie to answer the Afghans on the lines of the Government of India*s telegram.

(E 5509/1256/97) U-W Foreipcn Office Minutes on Kabul Kabul telegram No. 167 in E 5248 shows that the bombs which the R.A.F. accidentally dropped on an Afghan village had a devastating effect. Apart from the people they killed, two Afghans are said to be insane as a result of the bombing, while another is described as ’’heavily shell shocked, but not quite crazy”.* The Afghan Government's claims, whatever the Government of India may say about them, are obviously inflated and represent a ’’try on”. But it is the Government of India who will pay the bill, and if they are prepared to pay unreasonable rates in the hope that by so doing they will dispose of the incident, it is difficult for us to object. We might argue that the rates paid in this case should be similar to those paid in other cases (e.g. Turkey and Sweden), but Afghanistan is rather a law unto itself in such matters and rates paid to the Afghan Government by the Government of India could scarcely be brought up as a precedent against us. I therefore think we should agree with the Government of India and the India Office about the payment of compensation Kabul telegram No. 168 (in this jacket) deals with the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs’ request for a letter explaining His Majesty’s Government’s attitude. It is a little difficult to see just why the Afghans want a letter on these lines or what they will do with it if it is not to be published (see paragraph 4 (a)).

This letter, which would not be l‘or _.piihlication but merely in order to satisfy certain elements inside the Afghan Government, would not go beyond what Sir F, %iie was authorised in our telegram No. 157 of 14th August 8 ^^® th® Afghans in writing, except in regard to the words at ^ ^ the end 'and fix responsibility'^' On this point we did not authorise Sir F. Wylie to give the Afghans anything in writing &lt;*~4**L^ but told him he could tell them orally that it stands to reason p that the British authorities will take all possible measures, including such disciplinary action which may be found on investigation to be called for, to prevent a recurrence. It wculd be face* preferable to omit these words, but on the whole I think that we should not raise the point. To do so may further delay the final settlement of the incident and the words do not actually promise punishment and do not materially increase the danger of the Afghans pressing for information regarding the results of our enquiry, v/hich v/e should certainly have to refuse them. -x. a\4#^v*v.\: The Afghan Government* s bill for compensation seems very inflated. The rates used in the Khurram-Khost Joint Comoissions are 2,000 Afghani for a death, 1,000 Afghani for the loss of two limbs, 500 Afghani for the loss of 1 limb, 250 Afghani for a wound, 15 Afghani for a sheep or goat. These rates no doubt reflect the local customary rates. They are much lower than those asked by the Afghans which work out at 7 &gt;000 Afghani for a death (or an insanity) of an adult, 5000 Afghani for the death of a boy, 2,000 or 1,000 for wounds and the slaughter at customary rates of 255 sheep or goats. The 1923 case referred to by the Government of India was a long time ago and is not a very good precedent for this reason*' Nevertheless I think that Sir F. Wylie and the Government of India are right in urging that the Afghan claims should be paid without question in* order to get this rather dangerous affair disposed of. We might, however, give Sir F, Wylie discretion to make a lump sum payment to the Afghan Government without relating it specifically to the detailed items in their bill.

Wylie 167 September 4 &gt; c4 / - vm^ : -v Military S x Clr^OeeV As Sir F, Wylie points out it is extremely important that there should be no repetition of the recent incident on the frontier in which our aircraft bombed some Afghan villages by mistake, I am however not certain in view of the tone of paragraph 4 of the Government of India's telegram No, 6384 of 13 th August that the undesirability of this will really be brought home to the officers of the R.A.F. concerned and OOU&gt; it is, I suppose, possible that a good many of those;employed have not got the high standard of navigational training which we normally look for from the R.A.F, Subject to your views, therefore, I think it might be useful for us to write to the Government of India as in the attached draft in order to keep them iip to the mark.With reference to Sir P. Wylie* s letter no one will dispute c«. the extreme importance of avoiding such incidents and I am sure that this will have been strongly impressed on the Air Forces in India. It is probably true that the R.A.F. personnel are nowadays less experienced in Frontier conditions than formerly^ but it must be remembered that identification of targets in frontier tribal country is very difficult at all times largely owing to the inaccuracy of the maps and of the information on which the selection of targets is based. The importance of not bombing wrong targets is I think fully realised. It is also -true that once combined operations have stared it is extremely difficult to postpone action at short notice. There are already very detailed instructions for air action on the Frontier and personally I doubt whether any letter from us is necessary. If, however, it is felt that some comment is desirable I suggest an alternative draft embodying such specific references as Mr. Rumbold has suggested. oo\Xr l J^Ci ' U &amp;C\£»«V .BY FAST AIR MAIL.

Tney came down to their regular bombing height and dropped five 2oG lb and two 600 lb bombs. One aircraft doubting the correctness of the target did not drop tnree of nis bombs'. The underlining is of course mine. 6. If you will Kindly further refer to Korwef's Express letter no.1223- jTB dated the 2ath of July, 1042, you will find details of toe air action sanctioned in these operations. The Express letter closes with the following sentence :- 'ilie limits described above will mean that no proscriptive action is taken within six to eight miles of the Afghan border except at the mouth of the bhawal Algad where the distance is about four miles'. ^**'*)&amp; # ' 01&lt;V ^ ail ‘ ki ‘ yrse ^^ tthe opinion that with modern aircraft speeds a aistance oi four, six or even eight miles is no sort of insurance against violation 01 foreign territory, in the present case however such insurance as this short distance affords must in my view have been rendered almost entirely nugatory by the presence of cloud. The pilots apparently 'saw a village which t hey b e lieved to be the tar get through a gap in the clouds' and they bombed it. The underlining again is mine. \ 5. Now in these days I have no desire to make difficulties but for my whole work here incidents such as the present one are just shattering, ixie Axis Legations will make 10O 'j capital out of it and more. The people,who are strung up with tension already on account of the war news and wnat not, will react strongly against us and altogether the whole business is exceedingly unfortunate* 6. I am neither a soldier nor an airman and I offer the following suggestion with some diffidence for that reason. Would it not be possiole in tne case of purely punitive operations right on the top of the Afghan border to wait for a fine day? I am anxious not to appear ridiculous. I remember before the last war a comment in punch on a refusal by 'Territorial soldiers to parade in toe rain. The comment was 'It would be just like the Germans to come on a wet day', x don't want to lay myself open to that sort of jibe. But surely purely puni tive operations can always wait for a clear sky. cloudy days in ^, Wa2iri8tan aje n ° t ‘ excessivel y numerous and I understand that in gurope -i iS tori waiting for the bomb that does more damage - to morale - l L*' A &lt;5 ^ _ ~ J. r | ' toan the weight of toe actual bombs themselves. V. we have had a number of aerial violations of Afghan territory during the last months and I will be quite frank with you and say straight out that I do not think that on all these occasions those primarily concerned were adequately seized of the seriousness of the trespass involved in flying over alien territory. The Afghans get awfully sore about these violations principally I think because they feel that the authoriUes concerned just don't care. This soreness - whatever its principal root - damages our relations with trie Afghan Government very gravely and at the present time we simply cannot afford it. 8. Reverting to the sentence quoted in paragraph 1 of this letter, if you do not mind I would much prefer not to mention the weather at all in discussing the present case with the Afghan Government.

Personal letter No.67-P, dated 26th July, 1942, from His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, to His Excellency the Minister for Foreign Affairs,Kabul After compliments, Your Excellency will remember that just before I left Kabul on my recent visit to India you informed me that you had had an expression of regret from the United Etates Government through the American Charge d’ Affaires here for the fact that an American aeroplane had accidently flown over Afghan territory. You asked me at the same time what I thought you ought to do in the matter. I replied that I was leaving for India the next dap and would discuss the matter with the authorities in Delhi and let you know the result on my return to Kabul. 2. I have now not only aiscussed the subject with the Government of India but have taken the instructions of His Majesty’s Government. These instructions are to the effect that in so far as the legal position is concerned the fact that the aircraft in question was based on British territory does not in itself necessarily entail that any responsibility accrues to the British Government in the matter. As the Government of the1 United States of America has tendered an apology for the occurrence to the itoyal Afghan Government the latter will no doubt, -in view of the above interpretation of the legal position, agree that the proper requirements of the situation have been fully and adequately met. i Usual ending.

Ext.. ....5.225... SECRET CS.15583/S.6. Dear Rumbold, AIR MINISTRY, King Charles Street, Whitehall, S.W.l. Ibtt August, 1942. This is to confirm our concurrence in your Draft Telegram to His Majesty's Minister, Kabul, which was enclosed in your letter today. As I mentioned on the telephone, the only point which causes us uneasiness is the reference to possible disciplinary action. It does not look, prima facie, as if the circumstances were such as to justify disciplinary action; and even if such action were taken, it would,for a variety of reasons, clearly be undesirable to inform the Afghan G-overnment that this had been done. The form of words in draft appears, hov/ever, to safeguard this point quite adequately, and we take it that the Afghan Government will be firmly discouraged from pressing the point further. Yours sincerely. H.A.F. Rumbold, Esq., India Office, London, S.W.l.V. The iifghan Government have reacted badly to Sir F. Wylie ’ s full apology and offer of compensation for the bombing of Afghan villages and have put forward demands That an enquiry will he held, that disciplinary action will he taken against those responsible and that every possible precaution will he taken to prevent a recurrence. The Foreign Office me that they would probably prefer not to improve upon the statement already made to the Afghan Government as this would mean going further to meet the Afghans than they have gone to meet the Swiss and the Turks. I doubt whether there is anything very much in this point because conditions in Afghanistan are quite special and neither the Swiss nor the Turks are likely to quote an Afghan precedent against us. From tb Afghan and Frontier point of view there is something to be said for improving our case for the eventuality of public controversy regarding the incident, by giving the Afghans such further assurances as they could legitimately expect, such as an assurance that every possible precaution will be taken to prevent a recurrence and that an enquiry will/will be held into the present one. On the other hand it is not easy to make any further concession to the Afghans so long as they talk about tf demands”, and even if they consented to discuss the matter with us on a friendly basis rather than on a basis of demands, it seems undesirable to give them any assurances about disciplinary action* The crux of the matter is the public statement which the Afghans are going to put out in Kabul, It is most unlikely that we shall be able to control the terms of what they say and they will no doubt elaborate on any concessions we make to them. If we are too forthcoming they will make us look as humiliated as possible and if we decline to give them what would seem to be reasonable to the ordinary man on the frontier, we run the danger of being pilloried for unreasonableness. In either event the Axis legations would make the greatest possible amount of capital out of the Afghans' statement. It is suggested that the best line is that taken in the two draft telegrams attached.m « £4 4/B X cjn writing to thsJte you very coita.aj.xy r,or your jirjwr of June 2otii wltL wjiluh. you enclosed a copy of your letter of the same date to the Mini alar of Foreign Affaire about the violation of ;if^haxx territory by an A^rxcaxi plane IVom the inoian aauu of tae Anglo* - Afghan frontier# Xhe 1/i.inster has ntioned ?his natoox to -o ^ and I .gatiiered that he hm amloua to know to what extent, if tlas Legation was intereated* 1 told hist that I was ^bout to ^u*rt for indie .^nd that I wool! discuss the matter with the in ox an. do vein..;, nt* Beyond that X avoided ccsunitting ?ys elf in. n ry way* On my re turn riam India we iui/div# if you agree, have a talk about tae incident when i shall, 1 hope, oe in a position xpM&amp;&amp; t» you how this matter is viewed in tew x&gt;felhi# Yours sincerely si.f.v.

It doesn't seem to me to matter either way, hut we might as well give Sir P. Wylie a ruling, if any parallel cases have occurred before. It may depend on whether the United States aircraft are under an independent United States command functioning in India or whether they are ultimately under the orders of the R.A.P. or Indian Army. (Signed). I.T.M. PINK. 15 July. Mr. Beckett for .observations please. This is in a way a silly little point, but it may be worth exploring it properly because it is quite possible that it will arise not merely in connexion with Afghanistan but also elsewhere. There are now American air forces in this country and they may in the course of operations fly over Switzerland or Spain etc. I do not know whether in the . past, when Allied aircraft have flown over Switzerland and almost apologies have been made, any of the aircraft have been certainly I Dominion aircraft or those of the Polish, Czech, etc. should say. squadrons. I suppose that in any case the apologies which (Initialled) have been made have always been made by H.M.G., but of course J.G.W.. the Allied and Dominion air forces in the United Kingdom arp .very closely integrated into the R.A.P. I think it is clear that if neutral territory is violated by American military ( aircraft flying from British territory, there is no British responsibility merely because the flight has taken place from British territory. * If there is any responsibility it must arise from the fact that the American aircraft are operating under British command and control, and I presume it depends upon the arrangements in force with regard to the command and control. (Signed). W.E. BECKETT. 16th July, 1942 . No separate Allied or Dominion apology has ever been contem plated in respect of operations from this country. (Initialled) Sir W. Malkin. I agree. It is quite possible that there may have been cases of Allied aircraft under the control of the R.A.P. being concerned in violations of neutral territory, and if so I imagine that any apology we made would cover them and that there would have been no idea of bringing in the Allied Government concerned. General Department may have some information. But it does not necessarily follow that the^ position is the same as regards American air forces in India. j q. ¥ (Initialled). H.W.M. 16/7. The Dominion and Allied Air Forces are under (U.K.) British command in this country and bear ordinary R.A.F._ markings. I think U.S. have now their own air command in India and their machines- will--^ert^4nly have U.S. markings? ' - (Sighed). J.G. WARD. JUU942 16/VII Ati - A*#?- ■ OFFICE m N.A.Dept ./N.A.

If, on the other hand, a British higher command is responsible, Sir F. Wylie, after consulting his U.S. colleague, should, I think, answer the Afghan complaint. (Signed). N.

These complaints concern allegations of violations of Afghan territory by aircraft of the Royal Air Force (RAF), and occasionally the United States Air Force, based along the North West Frontier. These complaints are then either upheld or rejected by the Government of India – as a result of internal investigation – and a response issued via the British Legation. In a few cases copies of statements taken as a result of the investigation can be found alongside the correspondence. Officials of the Air Ministry, the Foreign Office, and the India Office, are often referred to for advice on matters of policy.Two particular incidents covered in greater detail are the accidental bombing of Narezai by RAF aircraft on 30 July 1942, and a crash landing of an RAF plane in Afghanistan on 1 July 1943. Despite the title of the file, it contains no material related to violations of British Indian territory by Afghan aircraft.The French content consists of a single letter on folios 84-87, dated 28 March 1943, from the Government of Switzerland to the British Government outlining Swiss policy towards military aircraft – from Allied or Axis forces – that land or crash land in its territory. Extracts from this letter are quoted in related items of correspondence.A Second World War propaganda poster regarding the Allied bombing of Germany has been reused due to wartime paper shortages; see folios 185v and 191v. A sketch map of Waziristan may be found on folio 258.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Afghanistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Air Force</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Afghanistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>North-West Frontier Province</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Internment</topic></subject><subject><topic>Aerial navigation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Airspace (law)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001f2#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
