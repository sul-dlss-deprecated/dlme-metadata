Lear jr Muhammed Ihsan visited me this morning, and said there were three points he would like cleared up. The first was on training of observers. He did not appreciate the fact that it had been agreed to train four observers, and said that if they could'not be taken at Karachi in addition to the pilots and mechanics, he would be prepared to reduce the number of mechanics by two or three, and send observers instead. He also said that if this was agreed he would send a wire to Kabul telling his staff to send all the pupils forthwith to Karachi. He seemed most agreeably surprised when I told him his party of 10 pilots, 10 mechanics. 4 observers, 2 W/T operators, a camp commandant and an interpreter had arrived at Karachi on July 15th. His second point was about the maps. He definitely turned down the suggestion that the 16 miles to 1 inch type would be suitable for his purpose, and wants the Survey of India ^ inch to one mile. I pointed out that these were not available at the moment, and he asks that they might be supplied if possible and be available for him in India when he passes through on his way home. As you suggested, I think the Government of India might be asked to reconsider their decision in this matter. Muhammed Ihsan then asked that all thenecessary instruction books for the aircraft, engines, oomrTcreb, etc., should be supplied. I suggested he should ask Hawkers for these.and he agreed. H.A.J 1 . Rumbold, Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l.m Finally he said he was leaving England tomorrow en route to Kabul. He proposes cabling at Karachi on the way back to see how his people are progressing in their training. He held forth at great length on the kindness shown to him during his visits to this country by everyone with whom he has come in contact. He said he was particularly impressed with what he had seen of aviation over here, and although his visit was partly concerned with the purchase of aircraft, it was primarily in the hope of fostering better relations between England and Afghanistan and between our Air Force and his own. He asked particularly that all concerned should be thanked for their many kindnesses and help.

The aircraft now being; manufactured m Germany were required for their own use, and his Government were not prepared to sell on easy terms. He thought the Afghan Government would eventually purchase aircraft from various countries, and suggested that a proportion would probably be obtained from each of the following countries, England, Germany and Italy.

As the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are aware, the question of the purchase by the Afghan Government of military aircraft in this country has been the subject of negotiation between H.M.G. and the Afghan Government The Government of India agreed to make available from their Afghan Reserve ■^und during the financial year 1937/38 the sum of Rs .6 lakhs (£45,000) for the to purchase of these aircraft, /which oua- \ will be repaid by the Afghan Government in six equal annual instalments. The equipment which the Afghan Government desires to purchase is of considerably greater value than £45,000, but, owing to the r charges a\C€a(L impeood upon their Afghan Reserve Fund, the Government of India were reluctant to undertake now to make available any further sums for this purpose either in 1937/38 or 1938/39.3. As it was considered desirable to avoid the risk of the Afghan Government seeking their requirements abroad, a telegram was sent to the Government of India on 13th March, after demi-official consultation with the Treasury, informing them that if the CruJjL Government of India &lt;can now undertake (provided that Afghan repayments of previous advances are punctually made meanwhile) to make Rs.4 lakhs (£30,000) available at the beginning of the financial year 1938/39 for the purchase by the Afghan Government of aircraft *in the United Kingdom, then in addition to the general undertaking in para.3 of Treasury letter of 21st May, 1936, H.M.G. w±±i now give an undertaking to seek Parliamentary sanction for payments to the Afghan Reserve Fund up to a maximum of Rs.4 lakhs, or such part of that sum as is from time to time unrepaid, if, before the last instalment of these Rs.4 lakhs is repaid, (a) the Government; of India decide that some expenditure from the Fund is urgently necessary and the resources of the Fund are insufficient for the purpose, or (b) there is a default in any Afghan repayments to the Government of India, o on account of any transactions in respect of which the Government of India have undertaken a liability which falls upon the Afghan Reserve Fund.Draft Paper.

The Treasury undertook to seek Parliamentary sanction for payments to the Afghan Reserve Fund up to a maximum of Rs.4 lakhs, or such part of that sum as is from time to time unrepaid, if before the last instalment of these Rs.4 lakhs is repaid (a) the Government of India decide that some expenditure from the Fund is urgently necessary and the resources of the Fund are insufficient, or (b) there is a default in any Afghan repayments to the Government of India, or on account of any transactions in respect of which the Government of India have undertaken a liability which falls upon the Afghan Reserve Fund. India agreed in their telegram of 17th March to make £30,000 available in April 1938, in addition to the £45,000 which they are making available now. informed of the further credit which the Government of India were now ready to make available.

A telegram was also sent to the Government of India and to Colonel Fraser- Tytler on 25th March informing them of what had passed. We are now waiting to see the draft contract which the Air Ministry are preparing between Messrs. Hawkers and a * British Authority for the delivery of the aircraft.

I understand from Mr. Hale that the Treasury are agreeable to this procedure, and a draft letter to them is submitted. A informed us . 1 A Note was sent by the Foreign Office to Ali Muhanmad on Meanwhile, it seems desirable to confirm , by an-BX)R]SIGN OFFICE, S.W.l ■h March, 1937 (N 1573/2/97) Dear Walton Thank you for your letter P.2. 1823/37 of the 19th March about Afghan aircraft purchases. I now enclose a copy of the record of our conversation with the Afghan Minister on this subject on the 23rd March; and we are sending you officially a copy of a note to Ali Mohammad confirming the whole arrangement. We agree with what you say in the second and third paragraphs of your letter about the third paragraph of the Government of India’s telegram No. 729. As regards the fifth paragraph of your letter we felt at first that if, as seemed probable. Hawkers would charge interest on the second instalment of the money due to them, the Government of India ought to pay the whole £45,000 now, in order to save the Afghans extra expense; but we learned from Darvall on the 23rd March that Hawkers did not intend to charge any interest at all. This being so, I think we can agree with you that the Government of India should only be asked to make/ -v J.C. Walton, Esq., C.B., M.Cmake available the minimum amount necessary to make up, together with the Afghan cash contribution, the first instalment required by Hawkers. We understood from the Afghan Minister on the 23rd March that the price for what Ihsan now required would be a little over £80,000. If this is so the Afghan cash payment will presumably be about £5 - 10,000 and the Government of India f s contribution this year will have to be £32 - 35,000. The Afghan cash payment must, in any case, be made this year, since Hawkers will only take payment in two instalments if payment is guaranteed by the Government of India, and the Government of India can clearly not guarantee a future Afghan cash payment. We have no objection to an exchange of letters taking place to confirm the undertaking given by the Treasury. They would presumably be between you and the Treasury (as were those confirming the setting up of the Afghan Reserve Fund). I am sending copies of this letter to Hale and Darvall.f % Gopj' (N 1637/2/97) The Afghan Minister and the Commandant of the Afghan Air Force, Muhammad Ihsan Khan, called yesterday afternoon and had a conversation with Mr. Collier, Mr. Rumbold of the India Office, Squadron Leader Darvell of the Air Ministry and Mr. Burrows also being present. Mr. Collier explained to the Afghan Minister what His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India were now able to offer in the way of credit facilities for the purchase of aircraft, training of Afghan pilots and mechanics in India, and the supply of British instructors etc., for the Afghan Air Force as set out in the attached draft note, and said that he understood from previous conversation with the Afghan Minister that the Afghan Government would be prepared to pay in cash now a sufficient sum to make up the total price of Hawkers’ contract. The Afghan Minister added that he deeply appreciated everything that had been done for Muhammad Ihsan by the Air Ministry and the trouble which had been taken to make the present offer possible. His Government would accept the offer with pleasure. As regards the cash payment, he thought that Mmhammad Ihsan had reduced the amount of equipment which he intended to buy here to such an extent that the final price would probably be not much more than £80,000 instead of £ 100,000 and there would thus be little for the Afghan Government to make up. His only stipulation was that the Air Miinistry should make some statement to the effect that the aircraft etc., were in good condition. Mir. Collier and Squadron Leader Darvell agreed that it would be easy to say that the material had been inspected in the same way as material for the Royal Air Force and that it could probably be arranged for Hawkers to undertake liability in the/■■■■■ ©(g) the event of faulty material similar to that which they undertook when supplying the Royal Air Force. It v/as, however, clearly impossible for the Air Ministry to guarantee to make good any material which proved unsatisfactory. The Afghan Minister appeared to be satisfied with this proposal. It was agreed that the Air Ministry should draft a contract between them and Hawkers and submit it to Muhammad Ihsan before signature. As soon as the main lines of this contract were clear, another contract would be drafted between His Majesty’s Government, and the Government of India on the one side, and the Afghan Government on the other, providing for the payment in cash of whatever sum was necessary beyond the £75,000 advanced by the Government of India and for the repayment of this £75,000 in six annual instalments. The Minister urged that the documents should be drawn up as quickly as possible. (3gd.) B.A.B.

I understand that, while the price quoted by 1 essrs. Hawkers for the material which the Afghan Government originally intended to acquire amounted to nearly £100,000, the contract at present contemplated is not likely to amount to much more than £30,000, and that your Government are prepared to pay in cash, as part of the first instalment whatever sum is required to make up the difference bef een the total credit of £75,000 offered by the Government of Inuia and the total contract price eventually agreed.

Military aircraft for Afghanistan. »e have replied officially agreeing to make additional 4 lakhs available in April 1938. Z agree that undertaking now given by Treasury is satisfactory so far as it goes and constitutes a considerable advance on anything H.M.G. have consented to hithorto, since it guarantees repayment in certain circumstances of a definite sum instead of merely giving an abstract promise to consider making a contribution from imperil Funds, we do not however properly appreciate why, in view of importance which H.M.G. obviously and rightly attach to this matter, they cannot accept direct liability themselves. £30,000 is a very small sisd compared with H.M.G.'s other proposed outlay for Defence purposes, and we wonder why' It could not be met from Secret Service .Mnds. | I I I I— vi ■' i A i M b *In connection with oar telegram of 13th arch, flagged B, please see I r. Collier’s note of an interview with the Afghan Minister on 16th larch and the G. of I.'s telegram of 17th March below. The position now i s, I think, as stated in the attached draft letter to hr. Collier, which might issae if yoa approve. 'f J. 3 7Draft Paper. Him Department. L. Collier, Esn., C.M.G., F.O. The G. of I.’s telegram of 17th March, No. 729, about Afghan aircraft purchases appears satisfactory, as they accept the Treasury undertaking, and enables us, I think, to proceed with the matter. z. There seems no difficulty about para. 3 of the telegram, m which the G. of I. ask that it should be understood that they can accept no further liability before April 1939, except to a strictly limited extent. Since the Afghan j Reserve Fund is primarily their concern, we could hardly object to their declining, until it is built up again, to make any payment to meet some unforeseen need arising in the interval; and the question whether in such an event H.M.G. would undertake to do so would be a matter for discussion would presumably largely depend on H.M.G.’s view of the urgency of the need. On the other hand, if, notwithstanding their present caveat, the G. of 1. should decide that it was necessary to use the fund and its resources were insufficient, the Treasury under condition (a) of their present undertaking would supply the ideficiency to the extent of 4 lakhs when the time came, and the decision 5667 5000 2.37 (less any instalments which had been repaid/repaid), and anything beyond this would, as in the other case, be a matter for discussion. A The ^reference in the Gr. of I.’s telegram to ’statutory difficulty’ is based on misunderstanding of a reference which we made to the fact that the E.C.G.D. are debarred by statute from giving credit facilities in respect of war material. This is a different question, which has nothing to do with the fund (see para. 4 of the Treasury letter of 21st lay, 1936). it If you are satisfied that there is a firm understanding with Hawkers about taking payment in two instalments (para, of our telegram to India of 13th ! arch), there now seems no reason why you should i not inform the Afghan Minister that it hds proved possible to make an arrangement on the lines which you indicated to him on 16th March, but that the earmarking of the additional sum of £30,000 for April 1938 means that it will be impossible to consider any question of a further credit for the purchase of war material before April 1939^ d ~y /l ^' f Since the Afghan Govt, are able to provide £25,000 in cash this year, there are presumably good grounds for hoping that this sum will be available towards the first instalment of the payment to Hawkers/Department. Hawkers, and that the sum of £45,000 which the G. of I. would be able to provide can be reduced accordingly so far as the 1957-8 payments are concerned. No doubt you will go into this point, to which Burrov/s drew rry attention recently, m your conversation with the Afghan Minister. It would, of course, be desirable to secure that so much as possible of the first instalment to Hawkers is paid out of Afghan cash. 6 Perhaps it would be desirable to have an exchange of official letters with the Treasury confirming the undertaking stated in para. 5 of our telegram to India of 13th March. 7 , Matters now seem to have reached a stage at which the Afghans can be told to go ahead with their order of eight aeroplanes in this country (and thus be diverted from enquiries abroad, so far as these eight aeroplanes are concerned). The details of the transaction still have to be worked out. The general idea of the modus operandi which has so far emerged from our consideration of the matter with the Air Ministry is, 1 think, that indicated in my letter to Metcalfe of 24th December, 1936, P.Z. 9099/36, i.e., that there should be a contract between the Air Ministry and Hawkers for the delivery/■ERMMr delivery of the aircraft and the payment of Hawkers’ instalments (which might actually be naid through the H.C. for I.)j and a second contract between the Afghan Govt, and H.M.G. for repayment in instalments of the sums advanced by the G. of I. «v. The first instalment oInpayment from the Afghans for purchases financed by the G. of I. will fall due at the date of shipment in respect of each shipment (as stipulated by the G. of I. in their telegram of 24th July, 1936, No. 1666, and stated in your note to Ali Muhammad of 1st February, N 413/2/97). ^ I am sending a copy of this letter j/ (/ to Hale and Harvall.

Wto. ML tttPr. 18 MAR 1937 , 5MD3A OFFICECOPY. The Afghan Minister called to-day and asked whether we had yet had a reply from the Government of India to the enquiry addressed to tnem on the question of providing further credit facilities for the purchase of aeroplanes by the Afghan Government, as the latter were anxious to come to an early decision about purchasing the aeroplanes they required in this country or abroad. I told the Minister that our first enquiry of the Government oi India had elicited a reply which made further discussion necessary. As a result of that discussion we had now telegraphed again suggesting an arrangement which, if it were approved, would enable us to offer a credit of some ebbu,000 next year, in addition to the A4o,000 already offered for this year. Sven in that event, however, the Afghan Government woula nave to make up by a cash payment this year the difference between the total of these two sums - some £75,000 - and Hawker’s price, which was understood to be about £100,000; and I must warn him that it would be no good pursuing the matter further unless the Afghan Government could at least undertake to do that. Alter a short interval lor reflection, the Minister replied that he thought he could guarantee that if a credit of £75,000 in all could be supplied on this basis the Afghan Government could make up the remaining £25,000 in cash this year; and when I asked whether we could inform the Government of India accordingly, as the news might assist them to return a favourable reply to our proposal to them, he agreed that this could be done. I accordingly rang up Mr. Walton at the India Office; and he agreed to recommend a telegram to Delhi in this sense, in which we could also press for an early reply. The/2 . The Minister then left, saying that he would be ^lad to hear as soon as possible whether the Government of India agreed to this arrangement in principle, as he wanted to discuss with me the details of the arrangements necessary to carry it into oacK iiere to ao this). He asked in this connexion who would sign the contract with Hawkers; and I told him that I thought it would be the Air Ministry, acting on behalf of his uovernment - which he seemed to regard as a very satisfactory arrangement.

The Treasury have decided to give the specific undertaking sought from them in the form of para. 5 of the draft telegram there submitted (subject to some verbal alterations which, with further verbal modifications suggested by us, have been agreed with them). The undertaking therefore stands as in para. 5 of the telegram below. This was sent on Saturday, since it is desirable to let the Afghans know as soon as possible, in order to achieve our object of getting them to buy all the eight aircraft here instead of some or all of them in Italy or elsewhere. The fact that the Treasury have been able to go so far is satisfactory. The undertaking is definite and covers all contingencies in which, so far as we can see, the G. of I. might be out of pocket by agreeing to— earmark an additional sum of 4 lakhs tn hn nrovideo m April 1938. Perhaps the Secretary of State would be disposed to send a P. and P. telegram referring to the prev 10 us/previous private correspondence and supporting the official telegram.

Mven in latter event our proposed training of Afghan aviators and despatch of air mission to Afghanistan (see correspondence ending with note to Afghan Minister of February 1st sent by mail of February 4th under P.3.783/37) would be liable to meet with very serious difficulties. country supplying half or all aircraft would almost certainly require to have experts in Aighamstan, thus securing important position there and reducing our influence both m Afghan Air Force and generally. 4. it is of course possible that Afghan representatives are 'bluffing', but it seems desirable to avoid or at any rate reduce the risk of Afghans turning wholly or mainly to Italy or Germany for their aircraft. His/2. His Majesty's Government do not therefore consider it desirable to taice the risk that Afghan representatives are not 'bluffing' and consequently wish to make one further effort to meet them. 5. In the hope that this may ease position of Government of India Treasury have consented to following arrangement. If Government of India can undertake (pi ovided that Aighan repayments of previous advances are punctually made meanwhile) to make 4 lakhs available at beginning oi financial year 1938-9 for Afghan purchase of aircraft in United kingdom, then, in addition to general undertaking in paragraph 3 of Treasury letter to India Office of May 21, 1936, His Majesty's Government will now give undertaking to s eek Parliamentary sanction for payments to Afghan Reserve Fund up to a maximum of Rs.4 lakhs or such part of that sum as is from time to cime unrepaid, if before the last instalment of these Rs. 4 lakhs is repaid (a) Government of India decide that some expenditure from fund is urgently necessary and resources of fund are insuificient, or (b) there is aefaurt m any Afghan repayments to Government of India or on account of any transactions in respect of which the Government of India have undertaken a liability which falls upon Afghan Reserve Fund. 6. As regards (a) Afghan Government would of course be informed now that no further credit for war material can be given in financial year 1938-9. 7.

I think we can accept the amendment suggested by the Treasury in their letter of 11th March, S.40511, to the formula in paragraph 5 of the draft telegram to India regarding aircraft for Afghanistan, subject to the following small nodification, which i think is purely a verbal one: Substitute 'if before the last instalment of these 4 lakhs is repaid' for 'if before these i-s.4 lakhs are due for repayment'. This is suggested because, as you know, the method of renayment by the kfghan Government to the ( ovemment of India of the money advanced to them for the purchase of aircraft will be by means of six annual instalments.

Dear Collier, This is in reply to your letter of the 8th March (N 1229/2/97) about Afghan purchases of aircraft. In all the circumstances we are prepared to give an undertaking such as you propose, but we should be glad if its terms could be amended to read as foilows:- to seek Parliamentary sanction for payments to Afghan Reserve Fund within a maximum of Rs.4 lakhs or such part of that sum as is from time to time unrepaid, if before these Rs.4 lakhs are due for repayment (a) Government of India decide that some expenditure from fund is urgently necessary and resources of fund are insufficient or (b) there is default in any Afghan repayments to Government of India or on account of any transactions in respect of which Government of India have undertaken a liability which falls upon Afghan reserve fund.' We hope that this amended version will be acceptable to you and the India Office.

The attached me iorandu^i, representing the Foreign Office point of view, had been circulated to those present. Mr. .alton pointed out that there was an inaccuracy in the third paragraph of this memorandum, as the Governmentof India had In fact taken account In their calculations of the repayments to be made by t* Afghans up to the beginning of the financial year 1958-9, and the further credit required b} the Afghans would have to be made available at the beginning of that year and thus before the receipt of Afghan repayments falling due in th€ year. 5. Mr* Walton opened the discussion by saying that his authorities were beginning to doubt the expediency of giving the Afghans any further credit, even if some means could be found to do so. ihey felt that the political risks involved in this case, if we did not allow the Afghans to squeese more money out of us, were less serious than the financial risk of Afghan default: any further British credit either made default more probable or, if it was conceded that the Afghans would obtain the credit somewhere else if we refused it them, would at least increase our share of the consequent loss* The obligations which the Afghans were continually incurring were beginning to amount to large sums and it was doubtful/doubtful whether their revenue would meet the service of the credits. * hat exactly were the political risks involved in a refusal to offer more credit to the Afghans? 4. Mr. Collier replied that although the Afghan Minister had stated that Ms Government might place half their order in this country, it seemed isore likely that they would avoid so inconvenient an arrangement and buy their whole requirements abroad if we could not meet them. Squadron Leader Marvell added that, even if we did get half the order, the training of Afghan pilots in India would be extremely difficult and the other country concerned would probably send experts and mechanics to Kabul, which would cause serious friction with our experts. The Air Ministry thought it was definitely valuable for us to have at least the predominant share in the creation of an Afghan Air Force. Mr.Collier 3 then pointed out the dan ers of allowing another country, particularly Germany or Italy, to acquire &amp; footing In Afghanistan in this way. Mr. Walton objected that we had never hoped to supply/supply more than a part of the Afghan aircraft requirements; but Squadron Leader Darvell said that as the aircraft construction programs in this country developed, it vrould almost certainly be possible to make twelve or fifteen Hinds available for the Afghans in future years. 5. Mr. Walton then enquired whether we could accept the Afghani' statement that they could not make any cash payment. Mr* Collier replied that Mr. Nixon of the Export Credits Guarantee Department had been much impressed with the way Abdul Majid had worked out exactly how much he could afford out of this year*s revenue and undertaken obligations accordingly. It was true that these obligations were increas ing, and both for this reason and because it was, he agreed, desirable not to accept the ot er party's view altogether in an oriental bargain, the Foreign Office looped that if the Government of India would put up an extra 4 lakhs, which would raise the credit offer to £75,000, the Afghans could be persuaded to make up the remaining £25,000 on Hawker’s estimate in cash. What he wanted was to make some contribution towards closing/'closing the gap between the two figures, to show goodwill to the Afghans. An extra obligation of about ^50*000 would not make much difference to the chances of Afghan default. 6 . Mr. Dalton then recalled that the Government of India had already raised their offer of credit from £42,000 this year, with the possibility of more later, to £4o,000. Squadron Leader Darvell pointed out that the original offer had been made when it was thought that the sum offered would more or less suffice for the Afghan requirement of eight aeroplanes. The difficulty had arisen when the Afghans came here and found that the price of eight aeroplanes with accessories and spares (which it was reasonable for them to want, in their particular circumstances) w-l s very much greater than had been contemplated. Hr. Collier suggested that the difference between the positions of the Government of India and the Afghan Government was not so great as a pearedat first sight. The Government of India wanted the Afghans to buy eight aeroplanes. The Afghans said that they would only ao so if spares etcetera were included. The Government of India offered ^45,000 this year and did not close the door to a consideration of more later. The Afghan Government felt that if they were to clinch the contract now they must know how they stood in respect of the whole sum involved. te hoped to enable the Government of India to mcke some more precise statement about future possibilities by offering them SOi2ie Quid ro QUO. 7# dr. T.alton questioned whether it could even be stated that the Government of India had not closed the door. In any case, the object of the Afghan Reserve Fund appeared sometimes to be misunderstood. It was meant to be built up to kU&amp;rd against an emergency, and should therefore not be denuded, except against compensation/ 7coBipcnsation which took the form of actual payment into the Fund. 8 . Mr. Collier then asked Squadron Leader Darvell whether he thought Hawkers would take payment in two instalments. Squadron Leader Darvell reolied that the contract was not of very great importance to Hawkers, particular^ because for many of tne purchases they were acting only as agents. He would, however, sound the Company on tnis point. 9. Squadron Leader Darvell suggested that the whole basis of the Fund had been altered by the changed circumstances of the present day when tne tempo of rearmament had so rauch increased. Mr. aiton replied that the origin of the Fund was to be found, partly at least, ir Afghan requests for the supply of armaments, which had been made some years ago and had not been materially changed. 10. Mr. A&amp;lton then enquired whether any other co sntry could produce aeroplanes in time for/for the J&amp;sh&amp;n celebrations in Afghanistan in August, since the Afghans probably wanted them to show off on that occasion, Squadron- Leader D&amp;rvell replied that he thought no other country could actually manufacture them, though it was always possible for a dictatorial Government to hand over a squadron from its own stock, 11, Mr, Dalton then asked whether it was agreed that a direct advance of - say - .£30,000 to the Government of India was out of the question, Mr, ardley and Mr, Collier feared that theP^rli&amp;mentary difficulty would be very great, even If the advance was made to the Government of India and not to Afghanistan, The discussion then turned to alternative (3) in the attached memorandum, i.e, the possibility of guaranteeing the Government of India against loss on the extra advance, Mr, alton and Mr, Collier agreed that to make it possible to approach/'approach the Government of India a^ain, the Treasury would have to £ ive a guarantee covering cases of an emergency requiring expenditure for the purposes of the Fund of more money than was in the Fund, or secondly of default in any Afghan repayments up to the sum o; four lakhs which we were to encourage the Government of India to advance. Mr. Sardley at first suggested that the general urdertaking already given by the Treasury (in paragraph 5 of their letter to the India Office of May 21st 1956) ou &amp; ht to cover the case because we were only asking the Government of India to maice an ordinary and proper use of money which was actually in the land* If &amp;n emergency arose a new situation was in any case created. Mr. f &gt;&amp;lton replied that the Government of India would certainly require an unaertaKing to reimburse them the sum involved if tney thought any expenditure necessary, i.e. they would not be content in this case/case with a promise of discussion between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India about contributions from Imperial Funds, which was all that was promised in the Treasury letter. 12. Mr. Variley further questioned the necessity for the stipulation aoout Afghan default, saying that in the event of deiault the Fund would presumably cease to exist and payment from His Majesty's Government would not be required, since the Government of India would no longer need to put aside any money for the Fund; but Mr. altor maintained that the Government of India would require to be put back In the position in which they would have been if they had given only £ 46,000 creuit. If the Fund ceased to exist, they would still be four lakhs to the bad, compared wita the position they would have been in if they had not aavanced this particular sum, and, as it was/^5 was not at their wish that this money would be paid out, they would raaintain that the loss ought not to fall on them. Agreement was finally reached in this sense. 13. It was decided taat the Air Ministry should immediately approach Hawkers to see if they would accept payment in two instalments, and that the Foreign Office and India Office should draft an undertaking to be given by the Treasury on tne basis of which the Government of India could be asked to reconsider the views expressed in their last telegram.IN T D 1 A OFFICE, vVHITKfiALL, S.f-/. 1 * 5th Larch, 193V. / Dear Collier, I return the draft telegram which harrows gave me yesterday* ve concur in it, subject to the alterations noted in mnuscript. hese fire the same as 1 suggested in my discuBeion with Burrows, except that m the fourth line at the top of the second page ‘now* might be nut before ’give' instead of before to neek“ ifcr greater clarity), and lower down after 'repayments 1 say 'to Government of India or on account . . . ^ instead of ’to fund on account . . • ilhe point about this amendlftent is that the Afghans have contracted certain debts to the Govern;-ent of inCia direct and another to the :ar Office whicii the Government of India have underwritten.) if the Treasury agree to the undertaking as stated in paragraph j of the telegram as amended, we are preoared to send this telegram to the Covem^ent of India.

I ' Secretary of State, Please see the notes at P.Z. 13U9/37 about the question of increasing the credit to the Afghans for the purchase of military aircraft beyond the £45,000 offered by the G. of I. A meeting was held yesterday at the F.O. with representatives of the Treasury and Air Ministry. I said that the 1.0. definitely preferred the course proposed in the drafts (to which, however, the F.O* are x opposed), and that we felt that we could not importune the G. of I. further, unless, at any rate, we could put our request on an entirely new basis, viz .. that if they promise Rs.4 lakhs more in 1938-9, the Treasury give a firm guarantee to recoup them for any resulting loss. I also drew attention to the increasing number of the Afghan Govt.’s commitments and the consequent financial risk of giving them further credit, which has to be weighed against the political risk of turning them away. In the subsequent discussion I said that in order to get the G. of I. to agree to the new proposal, it would probably be necessary for the Treasury to give a guarantee (which would be in addition to the general agreement about the They cress strongly for the alternative suggestion that we should go back to the G. of I. with some sort of Treasury guarantee. Afghan Reserve Fund) to refund to the G. of I. up to 4 lakhs in either of the following cont mgencies:- (1) if the G. of I. alone (instead of the G. of I. and H.M.G. in agreement) decided that some other expenditure from the fund was urgently necessary which they could not undertake owing to its depletion; (2) if the Afghan Govt, defaulted, totally or partially, on any of their obligations in which the G. of I. are financially interested (i.e., not only the 5319B 5000 10 30 ^ aircraft/Minute Paper. Department. *}■ aircraft, fcatthe rifles and amnonition supplied by the G. of I. and the rifles supplied by the War Office, in respect of which the G. of I. have undertaken a liability). The Treasury representative demurred a good deal to (2), but it seems to me that this would be required, since by paying out another 4 lakhs the G. of I. would be this additional amount out of pocket m the event of an Afghan default on any of these transactions. So far as the meeting was concerned, it was agreed that these proposals should be put up to the Treasury, and that the F.O. and 1.0. should draft a formula for the purpose. It was also agreed that the Air Ministry should sound Hawkers as to their willingness to take part of the payments due to them in April 1958, when the 4 lakhs would be available. I hear that the Air Ministry have done this and say that Hawkers will be prepared to agree to such an arrangement. The F.O. have drafted a telegram embodying in para. 5 the draft formula for which Treasury agreement is required. I have suggested some amendments of the formula and of the rest of the telegram in the margin. It is now proposed, if the F.O. agree to amendments in this sense, to send the draft to the Treasury, and it is submitted that if they give the proposed undertaking, we might telegraph to the G. of I. on these lines; but the matter will be submitted again when we hear from the Treasury. It will be seen that the suggested guarantee from the Treasury is definite and specific - unlike the general agreement with them regarding the Afghan Reserve 4424 5000 1.36 Fund/Minute Paper. Department. Fund, which committed them only to discussion of the question of incidence of the cost of mecasures agreed to be desirable and exceeding the capacity of the fund. The specific guarantee now suggested is that H.M.G. would go to Parliament for the money when the time came; the G. of I. would no doubt requirefirm promise that they would do so (especially as we have explained that it is impracticable, on account of special circumstances, to ask Parliament to vote money for aircraft for the Afghans at present); the question how an estimate for the purpose of repaying the G. of I. would be described might present some difficulty, since the G. of I.’s Afghan Reserve Fund is concealed in the Indian estimates. J Pluti(yt- iulbi^oL It is of course possible that the Treasury may decline to give the definite guarantee suggested, and it is also possible that, even with this guarantee, the G. of I. may see difficulties in agreeing to request.

As regards reference in paragraph 3 of your telegram to statement about parliamentary position made to Luharamad Hashim reported in my telegram No. 534 of 15th February, the difficulty of approaching Parliament is caused by temporary political circumstances; namely firstly that Parliament is being asked tms Session to give Government power to borrow up to £400 millions for defence and secondly that public discussion of sale of aircraft abroad might increase criticism to which Government is being subjected regarding the pace of the R.A.F. expansion programme.

Request of the Afghan Government for an increase in the sum of £45,000 in respect of which the Government of India have offered credit facilities. to FOR USE BY DEPARTMENTS ONLY. 1. Draft Note to the Afghan Minister refusing the request of his Government 2. Draft telegram to the Government of India informing.Minute Paper political Department In the Foreign Office Mote of 1st February (P.Z.^84/37) the offer contained in the Government of India’s telegram of 23rd January (P.Z.526/37) to give credit to the Afghan Government in respect of the purchase of aviation equipment in the United Kingdom to the value of £45,000 between now and 1st April, 1938, was communicated to the Afghan Minister. On 12th February Abdul Majid called at the Foreign Office in order to say that the Afghans wish to buy aviation equipment to the value of about £100,000, and if a credit of more than £45,000 could not be provided the Afghan Government would have to look abroad for their requirements. He was informed that the possibility of the Government of India being able to provide more than £45,000 in 1937/38 was very slight, but that the door was not closed on a further credit in 1938/39. Abdul Majid subsequently raised the question with the Secretary of State on 19th February, mentioning France as the country to which the Afghans would turn if we did not give them greater credit facilities. 2. Abdul Majid’s representations were communicated to the Government of India and their views requested. Their reply has now been received (Government of India telegram of 24th February). They are not prepared to increase their offer for 1937/38 and consider that it would be a mistaken policy to mortgage a large portion of their Afghan Reserve Fund for allocation to aviation equipment in 1938/39. Meanwhile on 24th February the Afghan Minister called at the Foreign Office in order to enquire when the Government of India’s answer might be expected. He said that if the answer was 'No' the 531UB 5000 10/36 Afghan/Afghan Government might content themselves by buying four machines in the United Kingdom? It is very possible that the Afghans are bluffing as Muhammad Ihsan has not had time to conduct anything like as detailed investigations in Germany, France or Italy (where we know that the Afghans have made enquiries) as he has in the United Kingdom and the Air Ministry believe that consequently the Afghans could get aircraft to Kabul in time for their Independence celebrations in August only from the United Kingdom. On the other hand, we cannot be certain that the Afghans are bluffing and the Germans are taking an interest in Afghan aviation. Another German aeroplane is on its way to Kabul and it may be intended to employ Herr Hempel, who arrived in Kabul early in January, with the Afghan Air Force as well as in civil aviation. 3. It seems hopeless to ask the Treasury to supplement the Government of India’s £45,000^as it is very doubtful whether the circumstances in which they undertook to consider making a contribution to Afghan expenditure have yet arisen.’ They could with plausibility argue that an offer of the amount remaining in the fund might, and a promise of a credit of Rs.4 lakhs in 1938/39 probably would, meet the Afghan Government, and that therefore the present problem is not beyond the resources of the fund. In any case the difficulty remains of asking Parliament to vote money to provide a foreign Power with aircraft in the same session in which they are being l-uoo asked to give power to the Government to raise £4 millior and in which there is some criticism regarding the progress of the R.A.F. expansion programme. This was, no doubt, in Mr. Eden’s mind when he told Muhammad Hashim that he feared the would not approve, nor sanction, a credit for war material, which statement/Minute Paper Department • * statement was repeated to Abdul Majid by Mr. Collier on 12th February. This difficulty is presumably not a permanent one as the Government of India fear (paragraph 3 of their telegram No.519), and in any case our agreement with the Treasury is unaffected^as it was implicit in that agreement that if the question of a charge on Imperial Revenues arose, it would have to be X ft jpt^t fiyi IL UsvuA) ke**- L L* obj-ctt' f*\ U/lt+U. &amp;■ t-JA*4 a/&lt;k&gt; Jo )c y i^+U- ^ If considered in the light of all the circumstances then At existing, including the Parliamentary situation. 4. Mr. Collier asked me to go over to the Foreign Office to discuss this question yesterday. He is /HaA J~ i, /Ch) ^ ^kA4j U~J apprehensive of the consequences of an Afghan Air Force under the influence of an unfriendly Power. He suggests that we should go back to the Government of India, explain that the difficulty of approaching Parliament applies only in present circumstances, that the agreement with the Treasury is unaffected, and urge the desirability of promising the Afghans Rs.4 lakhs in 1938/39^^provided that they meanwhile meet all their obligations, and with the warning that further assistance of this sort to the Afghan Government would not be easy . This sum would probably be sufficient to achieve agreement with the Afghans, and, taking ‘ -,k~ c, ,U f &lt;t/- 4 /iJ/v Afghan repayments into account, would leave a reasonable K balance in the fund. Mr. Collier also suggested that we should tell the Government of India that if they pay out these Rs.4 lakhs at the request of H.M.G., this would . . ' , * [ ' \ &lt; ’ ’ be a material consideration which the Treasury would bear in mind in considering the question of a contribution y in the event of a call on the fund subsequently arising which is beyond its capacity. Treasury concurrence in this course would be required. 53U!b 5000 10/36 5./5. It seems, however, unlikely that an offer on these lines would bend the Government of India, and there is reason in their view that it is wise to husband the fund. The fund can perhaps more usefully be applied to the provision of expert assistance to the Afghan Government in the sphere of economics as well as in that of aviatior, which is cheaper than the grant of credits for war material and is of great political value. Further discussion of the question with the Government of India or the Treasury would involve delay, and is not very likely to enable us to give a more encouraging reply to the Afghan Minister than we cbuld ^T^e’ now. Delay followed by a 'No' might well irritate the Afghans, and on the whole it seems best to reply to Ali Mohamed and to the Government of India on the lines of the attached While it would be desinble to go even farther than we have done to meet the Afghans, if possible, it seems oo me that the last telegram from the G* of I. (to whom we have put our request more than once) should be accepted as final so far as they are concerned. squeeze and bluff; and it is quite on the cards that they are bluffing on this occasion^if they say that, failing a larger credit from us, they will take the oraer abroad. Probably they require the aircraft to make a show at the Jashan celebrations in August; their negotiations with Hawkers have reached a stage at which it should be possible for them to get a squadron^of eight aircraft) by that date, bat the Air Ministry believe that they could not do so by starting negotiations now in France, Italy or Germany. drafts. I agree with Mr. Rumbold’s conclusion. The Afghans are, of coarse, experts in bothMinute Paper. Department. 5319b 5000 10 3(5 The most obvious coarse for the Afghans is to pay cash for the balance of the aircraft they require, or, if they really have not got the cash, to content themselves, as suggested by the Afghan Minister, with four machines, for which the G. of I.'s credit ought amply to suffice. The Afghans’ plea that they have no resources to pay cash only raises further doubts as to the expediency of granting them further credit. In this connection we ought to bear in mind the increasing number of the Afghan Govt. ’s^liabilities. They are rojighly as follows:- £40,000 still outstanding for rifles supplied by the G. of I. Nearly £80,000 for War Office rifles £54,000 for ammunition supplied by the G. of I. VttAA. £500,000 over a series of T years for machinery through the Export Credits Dept. The Export Credits Dept, also obtained information that Afghanistan has a consolidated credit from Germany of 25,000,000 Reichsmarks, repayable by instalments in kind over seven years, and a credit from Czechoslovakia of the equivalent of £600,000. It is admittedly desirable politically that the Afghan Govt, should so far as possible buy their aircraft here rather than abroad. But we should not let the political advantage of this weigh out of all proportion to the financial risk of financing the purchases. It would be very doubtful financial policy for the G. of I. to mortgage their fund in advance more than they have already d„„e. and I think that „ ^ ^ ^ their/their view in regard to this, especially as every further credit decreases the security of those already granted. As suggested above, it is by no means certain that the Afghans will now go to France, Italy or Germany for^aircraft^; it is only a risk, and perhaps not a great one. Moreover, if they went to France, as suggested by Abdul Majid, it would matter less than in the other cases. The best course accordingly seems to be to take the action suggested in the attached drafts. If, however, the F.O. feel that the risk (such as it is) of a successful approach to Italy or Germany ought at all costs to be avoided, the only alternative seems to be to persuade the Treasury to supply the balance of £55,000 which the Afghans say they require. We might join with the F.O. in asking the Treasury whether they would do this, unless it is thought that, since a Parliamentary vote would be required, the answer is a foregone conclusion. The pi^aller has Jen I' jy been suggested of asking the Treasury to give sorne^guarantee to the G. of I. which would enable the latter to make a firm promise of a further Rs.4 lakhs in 1938-9. It does not seei to me that this has much to commend it, sjua^ it would noU^'-* ^ 1 ’ ^ &lt;WV/ ' ^ give the Afghans what they want - viz ., credit for a purchase y in 1937-8; we should have to get a pretty firm guarantee from the Treasury before we approached the G. of 1. on these lines,' and, in view of the relative weight of the political and financial considerations, I doubt whether we C &lt;C 7 # could make a good case|. In short, it is really bad policy to mortgage the Afghan Reserve Fund in the manner suggested whether it is the G. of I. or the Treasury that is asked to hear the risk. ~ i . yDraft Paper.

We trust ? therefore, that your statement does not represent the la.st word of His Majesty J s Government on this subject, and that they can overcome this difficulty in tnis and in other similar oases if they arise in future.Vh* Afghan lilnister oallofl this afternoon to say that Abdul Majid Khan was leaving to-day ae previously arranged since the negotiations for the coraraeroial credit were concluded as far as he was concerned and since there seemed no immediate prospect of m answer froa the India office on the question of the credit for aircraft which he had discussed first at the Foreign Office and afterwards with that Depart ment* In that connexion the Minister asked me whether I thought the answer from the Government of India to the enquiry which the India Office had addressed to them on the possibility of guaranteeing further credit next year if this year’s credit of £4a t 000 could not be increased, would arrive in the course of the next few days as, in that cose, Mohammed -4ii£^Ln. might svay on to await it, though he mu'*t leave very soon for the continent and for home and could not return hei*e once he had left. *.f er consulting the w India Office by telephone, th e^jirn- &lt;that I could not Rive any definite oroaise on that point, but could tell 1 * 4*131 that, if Mohammed it-an- were staying on the India Office would send a further telegram to Delhi explaining the position and asking the Government of India to expedite their reply. The Minister said that, in these circumstances, J^-o&lt;Vvx_ he would advise Muham ed to stay here for a further three or four days; but he emphasised that the Afghan Government simply had not the cash to pay for any pu rt of the order this year out of their own resources and that, as the order was for £100,000, they would be obliged/obliged if we could not help them over this difficulty either to place the whole order abroad on the credit terias which they had been offered in other countries or to place say half of it (an order for four aeroplanes 6nly) here and the other half abroad. If only they ~b k could have a credit for next year as well as this year, however, they might perhaps arrange with the Hawser Company to pay them half the price now and half when the further credit became available. I said that, in that case. Hawkers would presumably increase their price to compensate them for the delay in payment; but he did not seem to mind that uueh. I hive now heard from the India Office that the Viceroy has replied to the private telegram which Abdul Majid bo anything next year. This is very um’o tunate ^ I fear the Government of India may spoil the ship for a ha'p’orth of tar; but if they cnn really produce good reasons for their refusal, I think we should consider whetl™ vvc / con do anything to overcome the difficulty • either by trying to make some ur anreaent of our own with Hawkers or even, if no other method seems available,by advancing the Goveramont of India the necessary £5L,0QQ or so. This, no doubt, would require a supplementary estimate here; but since we have just avoided a vote of £150,000 for Afghanistan which should bo a great relief to the Cabinet, they might perhaps be induced to sanction a transaction on there lines, rven if the Afghans were to buy four aeroplanes from us, the position would not be at all satisfactory if, as is likely, they bought the remainder from the Gem.no or ans i,ard Eetlani Abdul Majid after seeing particularly/particularly in riew of our recent information about the activities of Herr Hempel (see N ); and it seems doubtful whether,in that case, the Government of India would thinic it worth while to proceed with the scheme for training Afghan pilots at Karachi to which they have only agreed on the understanding that the present ^fghun order goes through. 24th Febr uary, 19,57 «491 3 60 6 36 India Office, London, 18th June 1936.

ENCLOSURE No. 1:— India Ojjice to Treasury. P.Z. 2376/36. ' India Office, Sir, 29th April 1936. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that the Government of India have raised the question of the incidence between Imperial and Indian revenues of expenditure incidental to the execution of the policy of His Majestv’s Government in regard to Afghanistan. They desire that some limitation should Ibe placed on their future liabilities under this head. 2. The Government of India are read} 7 to continue to bear the annual expenditure on His Majesty’s Legation at Kabul and the Consular establishments in Afghanistan, which amounts approximately to Rs. 4,45 lakhs a year. They also propose to set aside from Indian revenues a fixed annual sum for expenditure on material assistance rendered to Afghanistan to maintain her friendship and stability. They propose to fix this annual appropriation at Rs. 5 lakhs a year (i.e. more than the average of the expenditure during the past 13 years for 'this purpose), and they have provisionally transferred a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs in their accounts for the year 1935-36. The balance of this annual appropriation over the actual expenditure in any one year would be taken to reserve, where it would accumulate up to a maximum of Rs. 25 lakhs, this high maximum of the proposed reserve being allowed for the purpose of providing against emergencies such as that of 1930-31, when 10,000 rifles with ammunition and the sum of about £175,000 were given to the Afghan Government. As a corollary of the establishment of this special fund the Government of India would naturally expect that in future, if expenditure which could not be met from the fund were required on some object of policy in relation to Afghanistan which both His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India agreed was desirable, its incidence would form the subject of discussion between the two Governments, which would proceed on the presumption that India had already, by the voluntary establishment of the special fund, fulfilled her own obligations in respect of additional expenditure of an ordinary kind ; and the Government of India would, therefore, trust that, in the event of further expenditure (beyond the capacity of their fund) being required, the case for its being borne or shared by His Majesty’s Government would be favourably considered, especially if its object was primarily to counter some specific danger of Russian penetration in Afghanistan. 3. I am to enquire whether the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury are prepared to give the general undertaking which the Government, of India desire to have before establishing the proposed fund. 4. In this connection the Government of India have given an assurance that endeavours would be made to draw gradually on the fund during the first few years of its existence and thus to give time for a reserve to accumulate. They would, moreover, furnish annual statements for submission to the Lords Com missioners, showing the expenditure incurred, the general position of the fund and probable future commitments. I am also to explain that if it were decided to incur any expenditure on the subsidising of industry in Afghanistan or the grant of a credit to the London branch of the Afghan National Bank, it is not contemplated that such expenditure would fall upon the fund. 5.

Squadron-Leader Darvall's letter is very much to the point. We are being offered a wonderful opportunity for establishing an air force under our influence in Afghanistan: we can take some advantage of the determin ation of the Prime Minister and Ihsan that the air force should be British. But if, as is always possible, the Afghans really cannot pay cash for the remainder of their purchases above £45,000, we must be ready to make a further effort. We are now awaiting the answer of the Government of India to the telegram in N 897/2/97 and to Lord Zetland’s private telegram to the Viceroy. I feel that the question of the training of a few extra Afghans in India can easily be settled once the main question of the purchase of aircraft has been disposed of. For this reason I think we should not be too discouraging to Ihsan on the minor point now, and I would suggest a small addition to Mr. Rumbold’s draft to Squadron-Leader Darvall, as indicated. (Sgd.)

It is not thought that he has possibly had the time to carry out such extensive investigations in any J' other country, and it appears as if his intimately bound up in the acceptance of the contract by the Afghan Government on his return to Kabul. For our part, it does not seem that we can limit the assistance we are giving to the Afghan Governmentsto the few specific engagements we entered into before^ull scope of the Afghan wishes was appreciated.

Hawkers at orooklands with the Afghan Delegation on the 2nd and 3rd of February. With regard to the outstanding matter regarding the supplying of flying clothing etc., which reply had not yet been given through the India Office to the Afghan Legation, the question of the supply of flying clothing etc. , h&amp;S been referred to Messrs. Hawkers who were undertaking to supply estimates and to supply the equipment required from the firms concerned. written to General Mohammed Ihsan covering the ooints discussed during the meeting on the 10th February. It is hoped that all outstanding matters have now been settled and that on his return to Afghanistan an order for the equipment that the Afghans require, will materialise. The General emphasized that so far as he was concerned, he wished to buy British ,but that the financial details of course, were’not his immediate concern. I also attach a copy of a letter which was Mr. H.A.F.

The General opened the discussion toy asking the air Minis try to do all they could to nasten the completion of the estimates for the aircraft and equipment which the Afghans were considering uuying through the British Government. The chief outstanding matters were, wireless equipment, ammunition, bombs, and lachine guns* He also asked aoout the provision of maps on the scale of 4' to the mile for the whole of Afghanistan, for which 50 complete sets will oe required* The General said he was leaving on Saturday for Afghanistan and would like all the outstanding items cleared up by Thursday evening, if possible* It was agreed that the air Ministry would do all that they could to hasten the outstanding estimates and the latter was promised by Thursday evening, clearing up those details for which the Air ministry themselves were responsible, l*e* estimates for guns, 0 Vickers and 8 Lewis, with necessary magazines and clips and spare parts f 400 112 lb* bombs, 400 20 lb* bombs, and 400 canisters of baoy incendiaries* emphasized that the only bombs that could be supplied at once would be the existing types in the R.A.I., as the new bomba which have been produced were still in the dxperimcntal stage and no stocks were available for is Slid* out that the only existing maps of Afghanistan on that scale would be mm based on very old surveys and very incomplete and inaccurate* Steps would oe taken to discover if such maps were available in England, but it was suggested that *M§ on the scale of 10si\«to the would be much more valuable for their purposes* The General then asked how soon these articles would be supplied and it was pointed out that the date would depend upon the date when the financial arrangements had been settled with the oritish Government, but that once those had been settled, there would not be much delay and it was thought that the whole order, incMing aircraft, ammunition, etc*, could be supplied to Afghanistan between 4 and 5 months after the order had been placed* that so far as he was concerned, there was no question of the order not being pl&amp;ceu.

ENCLOSURE T' V’ &lt;3I\ Visit.ta Squadron Leader Parval l (F.0.4) to iJeasrs. iiawkere .'1th Atrhan Delepatlon, on 2nd and 3rd February, 1957 * I visited Messrs. Hawkers at Brooklanda In company with Mohammed Thsan and the Secretary or the Afghan Legation on Tuesday and Wednesday 9 2nd and 3rd February. During these two days the principal task carried out was the translation of the detailed list of Messrs. Hawkers products Into Persian. It was found to be extremely laborious as the Afghan Secretary of the Legation spoke only a little English, except his native Persian, and knew nothing about aircraft or motors; the Afghan General spoke no English but only a little French yet knew quite a lot about aircraft and motors; Messrs. Hawkers* representative knew a lot about aircraft and motors but spoke no I-’rench. In consequence moat of the detailed technical explanations had to be carried on in bad French between myself and the Afghan General. At that time it was obvious that he was extremely anxious to complete the deal as soon as pOBsiDle. He was not particularly anxious that the price of anything should be cut down, was most meticulous that supplies of spares of all kinds should be provided, and included a final request for particulars of a complete workshop with all woodworking and metal working materials for the maintenance of a small air force. •‘■he machines were to be of the latest types and all electric. 2. He also asked for the R.A.F. to supply course setting bomb sights aid instructional books and diagrams of all kinds, including flying training manuals, operations manuals, arraament training manuals, etc. It was made clear to him that provision of such publications would follow any contract made with Afghan Government for the supply of aircraft etc. H o. ui a 3. Regarding the question of extra tanks to give more range to the Hind aircraft, Muhainmed Isiian informed me most confidentially that the principal reason they required an extra range of 150 miles was because they foresaw some difficulty in the country north of the Hindu-Kush, particularly in the Mazar-i-8harif area. He explained with considerable lienee that even the great British Government occasionally had some minor troubles on their frontiers, and unfortunately the Afglians suffered also from these local disturbances. I gathered that there were two possibilities of trouble there, one dynastic and the other owing to infiltration from Russian Turkestan. It will be remembered that about ten years ago a ^very large number of tribesmen and sheep moved over into Afghanistan: the population south of Oxus now largely consists z of these tribesmen whose direct relations live Just across the river. CO 4. Messrs. Hawkers have been able to produce a design for fitting a long range tank which will give an extra range fof 150 miles and will still allow the Hind to carry 2 x 112 and 4 x 20 lb. bombs at a cost of £100 per set. 5. On Thursday the 4th February, Muhammed lahan visited Rolls Royce Limited at Derby where he was able to complete his translation of the Rolls ^oyce spares from Jinglish to Persian via a French speaking Rolls engineer.6. On Friday evening the Secretary of the Legation telephoned and asked that an Air Ministry Signals Officer might be sent over to the Afghan Legation on Saturday afternoon at 4 o’clock to advise on the question of wireless equipment, as a representative from Messrs. Marconi would be there to see Muhammed Thaqn at that time. 7. In the meantime reports had been received that - (i) it was unlikely that any order would be received from the Afghan Governinent until the return of Muhammed (ii) that two German officers were proceeding to Kabul via Egypt and Teheran with a Junkers Ju.86 civil type for demonstration purposes. 8. A representative of Air Ministry Signals visited the Afghan Legation on Saturday afternoon, but found that the meeting had been cancelled and little if any interest was evinced in the purchase of aircraft materials from ua. No information had been received from the Afghan negation that the meeting was off, though at 6 p.ra. the night before considerable interest was evinced in this meeting and it was said that an Air Ministry representative was essential. 9. An inference may be drawn perhaps from these two factors that a promising offer has been made to the Afghans from Germany. F.0.4 . /g/a? . _V 10th i^otoruary, 1^37.

Mohammed Ihsan, accompanied hy an interpreter from the Afghan Legation, visited D.C.A. 8 . this morning. Present et the interview were - Air Vice-Marshal Courtney, Air Vice-Marshal Peirse, Squadron Leader Darvall and Squadron Leader Boyle. The conversation was open hy an enquiry from the Afghans as to whether it was possible to say how the instalments for the ’Hind T aircraft could he paid, and Air Vice-Marshal Courtney replied that as the India Office and the Foreign Office were arranging this matter the Air Ministry was not in a position to say anything. He would, however, arrange a discussion with the Foreign Office and make an appointment for Mohammed Ihsan. Mohammed Ihsan then stated that he wanted to fix the date when the 10 Afghan pilots and 10 other ranks could arrive in India, and Air Vice—Marshal Countney stated that he would mention that matter also to the Foreign Office. With regard to the suggested increase hy the Afghans of the above numbers, Air Vice-Marshal Courtney stated that in his opinion it was probable that any additional pilots and other ranks would have to go subsequent to the first batch. He said that the matter was really one of finance, and since the additional numbers had been mentioned for the first time today he could not give a definite answer. The Afghan interpreter thereupon said that Mohammed Ihaan would accept the original quota of 10 officers and 10 other ranks, and would like to know when ! u ; UJ Zc ui _i N- ~*t. U- K) o &gt;* G) *—■ fcr 1 &gt; Ix LC CN &lt; cu Ui as CD o 1 1 o jo ‘4f &amp;JP they would be able to be received. The discussion then changed to the subject of the T Hind’ aircraft, and Mohammed Ihsan stated that though he liked this type of aircraft he did not like a machine which had such small endurance and would like to have extra tanks. Air Vice- Marshal Courtney pointed out that extra tankage could only be provided at the expense of bomb load, and it was for the Afghan Authorities to say what they wanted to Messrs. Hawkers. In his opinion it was quite feasible that extra tankage could be provided but that it would probably be external, and he thought that an extra hour’s flying could be assured by the sacrifice of say 250 lbs. of bombs. He thought that the matter must be discussed by Mohammed Ihsen with the Hawker Company and, obviously any alteration would mean a slight increase in the price of the aircraft. He would, however, tell Messrs. Hawkers, and the matter could be discussed tomorrow, when a visit to the firm would be paid. To a statement that the Afghan Government could not recognise the validity of the price as quoted by Messrs. Hawkers unless the Air Ministry certified the prices, Air Vice-Marshal Courtney stated that this was a matter in which the Air Ministry could not intervene, since the contract between theAfghan Government and the Hawker firm was a very complicated document. The delivery of two aircraft per month starting from February, then became the subject for discussion, and the Afghan Delegation made it clear that they would prefer that all machines could be delivered together. To this Air Vice-Marshal Courtney O /repliedf s - 2 - replied that there would he no objection so far as he could see to the delivery of eight in May, though delivery of two per month as from February was what had been agreed to between the respective Governments, Alternatively, he saw no objection to the delivery of four in March and four in May if the Afghans preferred it. It seemed to him that it was a matter for discussion between Mohammed Ihsan and his Prime Minister. The discussion then veered to Lewis Guns, Ammunition and Spare Parts for the Lewis and Vickers Guns, and Mohammed Ihsan was told that there was unlikely to be any difficulty with regard to the supply of guns or ammunition, and with regard to spare parts for the guns, it was believed that they would be a natural and integral part of the contract. Air Vice-Marshal Courtney then told Mohammed Ihsan, in reply to his query, that he would gladly put him into touch with firms responsible for instruments for the measurement of the strength and direction of wind, which were required for Kabul Aerodrome. He would also arrange for the address of the firm making oil filtration plant to be communicated to the Afghan Legation, while with regard to flying clothing, he would ask Messrs. Hawkers to get into touch with the firm and quote for the clothing required. A discussion then ensued regarding the delivery of the , Hind t aircraft to Kabul. Messrs. Hawker had quoted for delivery in Karachi, and Air Vice-Marshal Courtney stated that though it was unlikely that this problem would be difficult of solution, he would have to refer the matter to the firm, and suggested that Mohammed Ihsan should also discuss it when he saw the firm tomorrow. The question of the supply of bombs presented a good many difficulties, though he felt that it might be possible to supply some of the older types. Of the newer types the Royal Air Force had all too few, and such a scarcity complicated the release to the Afghan Government, who wanted 1,200 bombs in all. He suggested that the matter should be deferred until a later date. To this the Afghans agreed somewhat reluntantly. NOTE: Messrs. Hawkers informed of points raised affecting them 1.2.37.

The head of the Afghan 1 ational Bank had another interview with the Foreign Office on February 12th. There were present Mr. Collier and Mr. Burrows of the Foreign Office and Mr. Ruiubold of the India Office, and Mr. Grove interpreted in Russian. 2. Abdul Majid Khan began by saying that his economic negotiations were going well and that he h&amp;a now come to speak about credits for tne supply of war material. Could we not do any more to help in this line? If we could not, Muhammad Ihsan Khan was wasting the time which he was spending in conversations with the Air Ministry and aircraft manufacturers, since it was absolutely necessary for the Afghan authorities to buy a complete squadron of, say, 9 aeroplanes from one country, and these, with the necessary accessories, *ouid cost about £100,000. Could we make this amount of credit available?s. Mr. Collier replied thet, as the Secretary of State nad plainly told liis Royal Highnes* the Irirae Minister of Af &amp; hanistan, it would be i® osslble to secure Rarllamertary sanction for the grant of a 'military' credit by His Majesty's Coverraient, particulariy in flew of what the Government of Indio were already doitg for the Afghan Government in this connexion. He recal.ed that the sum made available to finance Afghan purchases of rifles and ammunition amounted to .5180,000, and that the Government of India had row agreed to make a turther £4b,00Q available to assist the Afghans In purchasing British aeroplanes. The Government of India had not the same difficulties about Parliamentary sanction as we had, nut their financial position, and especially the prospect of the establishment of new provincial constitutions in the near future, made it almost impossible for them to make larger sums available/available at present, though it was by no means available later on.

Abdul Aajid replied that he fully recognised that His Majesty’s Government were being as helpful as they could. They were now in a position to help the Afghan Government, but it mi fe ht be tnat the time would come when the positions would be reversed; and if that wen so the Afghan Government would repay in full measure ary help which we gave them now. After twenty hours’ conversation with Ur.

This Judgment by competent business men should surely give us confidence to extei d slightly our 'political* credit for the supply of *ar material in order to round off the whole transaction# 6 . *lr# Collier replied that the decisions of the Export Credits Guarantee Department, based on purely commercial grounds, were entirely separate from ary credit that might be offerer by jfis Majesty’s Government, since the latter aould only be given if a good I arlianertary case could be made out for it on political as well as, or instead of, commercial grounds# he went on to say that the course of the negotiations between the Export (reuits Guarantee Department and Abdul *'ajid was a great tribute to the latter's negotiating powers# he understood that Mr. Eixon had finally offered Abdul Majid the same rate of interestthe/ as th&amp;t specified in the recent Soviet credits agreement, and he hoped that Abdul Majid would be able to accept this. iibdul Majid replied that he would certainly do so if the length of the credit offered him was also the same. Actually, however, the Soviet authorities had secured a full five years' credit, since they did not have to start repayment until 5 years after their orders were ,.iver.; he, on the other hand, had been offered a scheme which involved the advance by the Export Credits Guarantee Department of ^400,000, spread over 4 years, each sum advanced being repaid in 6 annual instalments, starting from the date on which the order for that amourt was given. The average or effective length of the period was therefore 5 years. After Mr. Fixon had been consulted by telephone, Mr. Collier told Abdul Majid that Mr. Fixon did not agree thatthe effective ler%th of the Afghan credit would be only 5 years, since from our point of view we should be involved in Afghanistan for r;o less than 10 years. Moreover, the Soviet authorities had only secured our agreement to their making no repayment for 5 years by undertaxing to placfe all their orders at once. 0* When Abdul *aji&lt;l referred once more to offers of credit at 4 j&amp;ade to him by Kussia, Germany and Czechoslovakia, Mr. Collier suggested that those countries could do this because they tied up tneir offer with conditions for the Darter of goods, whereas our offer *&amp;s unconditional, and also because in the cases of Russia and Germany at least, their motives were not entirely commercial. Abdul Majid doubted whether Germany could have any but commercial reasons for granting thi* ere it, but Mr. Collier explained that our experience of German policy made/the/ raade it quite clear to us that political considerations had entered into their action. /. Abdul Majla finally said that, since his last conversation with Mr. Nixon, the rnine Minister of Afghanistan, to whom he had reported, had telegraphed urgently to Kabul, aid that he, Abdul Majid, would ask for another interview with Hr. Collier and Mr. Nixon when a reply nad beer received* 8. Abdul Majid then said that there were a lew questions about trade between Af hanistan and India which he wanted to discuss. Could he do this at the India Office or must he wait till he reached India? Mr. Rumbold said that the India Office would be delighted to discuss such questions with him, but could only uo so in a preliminary and general way, since actual negotiations would have to be carried on in In.aia. tie enquired what questions Abdul Majid wished to discuss; the latter replied thatthe aain ^uestiona were free transit, the Khyber toils, freight charges on ;he Indian railways and, it was understood, &gt;oiae question it connexion with the position of India traders in Kabul and their antagonism to the Asaaai Conpany* It was agreed that Abaul ilajid should s&amp;aite an appointment at the Inuia Office by telephone*, ^ TEr v .

[N 732/222/97] Co Py No * ^ ^ Viscount Halifax to Lieutenant-Colonel Fraser-Tytler (Kabul). (No 21.) Foreign Office, February 10, 193/. the Prime Minister of Afghanistan called again on the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the 5th February to continue the conversation begun on the 3rd February, as recorded in my despatch No. 18 of the 9th February. As before, he was accompanied bv the Afghan Minister. 2. His Royal Highness said that Mr FMen was doubtless aware that, as arranged on the previous occasion, he had sent Abdul Majid Khan to discuss credit proposals with representatives of His Majesty s Government. (1 he discussion had, in fact, taken place that morning, as recorded in my despatch No. 19 of the 9th February.) Owing, however, to a slight misunderstanding on Abdul Majid's part, the necessary documents had not then been communicated. He had therefore brought these with him now; and he then handed to Mr. Eden the two documents enclosed herein, which, it will be seen, propose credits of €600,000 and €400,000 for industrial machinery and for war material respectively. . .. 3. Mr. Eden, after examining these documents, said that he must tell His Royal Highness frankly that, as he had explained to the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs last year! the legal and constitutional position of His Majesty s Government was such that it was very difficult for them to make large advances to any foreign Government in times of peace. He had told His Royal Highness two days ago that €100.000 could be made available for export credits to Afghanistan by a charge on the Foreign Office Vote; and he could now add that this total could be exceeded, though not to any very great extent. As he had also explained, however, this vote would be open to public discussion in Parliament, and he himself, as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, would have to give the reasons for it. He thought he could convince the House of Commons that there were good reasons for the grant of a credit for purchases of machinery, &amp;c.; but he feared that the House of Commons would not approve, nor the Cabinet sanction, any credit for war material. For that purpose the Government of India were already granting a credit of €45.000, as His Royal Highness was aware; and any war material required by the Afghan Government (which His Majesty’s Government would always do their best to make available), would have to be purchased either through that credit or for cash. Perhaps indeed, the Afghan Government could consider a combination of the two methoijs. (Here His Royal Highness interposed a remark that his Government's cash resources were already fully employed.) As regards the credit for machinery, &amp;c., he thought, though he had no technical knowledge of these matters that it ought not to be impossible for Abdul Majid Khan to do business on the basis of the credit which His Majesty's Government could now make available; and he promised that the document containing the Afghan proposals on this subject should be examined by the appropriate experts here with a view to further negotiations between them and Abdul Majid. 4. His Royal Highness said that this would be a satisfactory procedure: and he went on to declare with emphasis and with every appearance of sincerity that while he would be grateful for any help of this nature which His Majesty's Government could afford, he would not take it amiss if they felt themselves unable to meet his Government's requirements in full, nor would he allow any divergence of views on these matters to affect his determination to pursue a policy of political friendship and collaboration with His Majesty's Government—a policy which, he added with a laugh, he was pursuing not for any sentimental reasons. [927 k—1]9 but solely because experience had convinced him that it was in the inteiests of his country. At the same time, and for the same motives of self-interest and self-preservation, Afghanistan must push on with her economic developments seeking help in this wherever she could; and in justification of this policy, he referred again to the general political situation and the danger for Afghanistair which might arise from the rapid development of countries such as Persia and Soviet Central Asia, repeating several arguments used by Adbul Majid Khan in his interview at this department (see my above-mentioned despatch No. 19 of the 9th February). 5. Mr. Eden said that he appreciated the necessity of this policy from the Afghan point of view; and he asked if there was any other way in which His Majesty's Government could assist it, as well as by the grant of credits. His Royal Highness replied that he thought there was a good deal which could be done for the improvement of Afghan commercial relations with India, for example; and he proposed that Abdul Majid should discuss these matters, too, in the course of next week. Mr. Eden suggested that they could best be discussed at the India Office; and His Royal Highness agreed that Abdul Majid could be put in touch with that department. 6. Finally, His Royal Highness said that there was one political matter in which the Government of India could be helpful to Afghanistan; he referred to the situation on the Indo-Afghan frontier' He then expounded the views of his Government on the necessity of caution and conciliation in dealing with the frontier tribes, on the lines which you have already reported—to which Mr. Eden replied in the sense of the statement of British policy in this matter made last year to the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs, adding that recent events, such as the forbearing treatment of the Afridis, should have convinced the Afghan Government that their views and their interests were still being taken into account in putting that policy into practice. If, however. His Royal Highness wished to discuss the matter in greater detail. Lord Zetland was always at his disposal for an interview. To this the Prime Minister replied that, to speak frankly, he might be pleased to talk to Lord Zetland about it if the latter were in the Foreign Office, but that in the present state of Afghan public opinion, he could not risk the consequences of its becoming known in Afghanistan that he had had a conversation alone with the Secretary of State for India. The Secretary of State said that he quite understood the position and would not press the suggestion. 7. The interview then closed with expressions of mutual satisfaction that His Royal Highness and the Secretary of State had had the opportunity of becoming acquainted, and it was arranged that Abdul Majid Khan should call at this department on the 9th February for the further discussion of the credit question. I am, &amp;c. HALIFAX Enclosure 1. The Plan for an Industrial Credit. THE suggestion is made that foi* this purpose His Britannic Majesty’s Government in Great Britain may be pleased to sanction a credit for the period of eight years in favour of the National Bank of Afghanistan on the guarantee accorded by the Royal Afghan Government. The above-mentioned credit is to be utilised as follows :— (a) The amount allotted for this aforesaid credit may not be less than the sum of £600.000 sterling. {h) The Afghan National Bank is to utilise this credit from the present date onwards for a period of five years in the following manner :— From the present date up till the year 1939 the sum of £300,000 is to be spent by the way of placing orders with British factories, while the remaining £300,000 worth of orders are likewise to be placed during the year 1940-41./ :3 The Method of Executing the above Orders. 1. I he British Government, through the Department of Overseas Trade, may kindly arrange that the Afghan National Bank he brought in contact with ^British firms like Messrs. Platt Brothers, .and a few similar British concerns, engaged in making British textile machinery, electric plant, and machinery and also boat and motor-boat constructors. It may further be agreed that the Department of Overseas Trade will be good enough to render all possible assistance in bringing the two parties (i.e., the Afghan National Bank and the British firms) together to reach a general under standing and to materialise this by agreeing on a plan of three or five years on the basis of which a contract is to be made by mutual arrangements of the parties concerned. In it the procedure is to be outlined as to the method and manner of undertakings agreed by the British party, whereby it would be explained as to the kind of machinery, the terms, and prices according to which the purchases are to be made by Afghanistan. It will also embody the nature of undertakings agreed by the Afghan Bank with regard to the above-mentioned purchases. 2. The Afghan National Bank will undertake to take over each lot of merchandise thus purchased on the basis of the plan and contract referred above, against which the Afghan Bank will issue eight separate Bills of Exchange in this manner. The first Bill of Exchange is to be as the first instalment of the first year, and the last bill as to be the instalment of the eighth year in accordance with the schedule of payments appended herewith. The Department of Overseas Trade would be also kind enough to be the guarantors for these Bills of Exchange, while it is requested that the Bank of England would accept these bills against making payments to the British makers from whom the machinery is purchased. The Bank of England, of course, debit the amount of interest incurred on these bills to the account of the Afghan National Bank, and, on its part the Afghan Bank agrees to meet these bills when they fall due, and to settle payments with the Bank of England.

The .4 rrangements of Credit for the purpose of Purchasing Military Equipments*. r* THE above-mentioned credit may not be less than the sum of £400,000. The method of drawing and payment of this credit may briefly be outlined as follows :— The Royal Afghan Government would agree to effect purchases of military equipments and its accessories from the beginning of the year 1937 up till the end of the year 1940. and for each year the above purchases will be made for the sum of £100,000 from the British factories. The payments for which would be made during the period of ten years from the day of the delivery of the goods thus purchased, by ten annual instalments on the basis of 10 per cent, of the total sum in each year. The official who is to be appointed by the British Government for arranging these purchases would be charged with the duty to carry out the orders for the mentioned purchases with the help and constant assistance of the British Govern ment, and he would further attend to the execution of the programme through the departments of the British Governments to enable him to carry out these orders completely from the British factories. The British Government will also be kind enough to show a friendly interest in the matter by devoting constant attention and by exercising a control over the orders, and, by that, enabling the Royal Afghan Government to carry out the orders of the purchases in such a manner that the military equipments and materials required by the Royal War Ministry of Afghanistan when supplied should prove without any fault whatsoever, and also, from the point of modern technical aspect, the supplies should be of the very best quality and should be complete in all respects. f(N 468/2/97).

There, as far as we were concerned, Field f s duties ended* Rumbold of the India Office rang up Williams in my department a few days ago to ask if we knew Muhammad Ihsan’s whereabouts, and was informed that Muhammed Ihsan had left the country.

Sir I have the honour to refer to your conversation at this department on the 7th December last, when you ashed for the elucidation of certain points in my note of the 5th December, regarding the proposed sale of military aircraft and mechanics in India. I regret that it has not been possible to reply to your questions before now, owing to the necessity of consultation with the Government of India, at whose expense the credit facilities desired for the purchase of aircraft on an instalment basis would be furnished. 2. As regards the terms of payment I am happy to say that the Government of India have been able to revise the terms of the offer communicated to you in paragraph 3 of the Foreign Office note of the 5th December. In lieu of arranging for the purchase (on a basis of repayment in six annual instalments) of five Hinds or similar aircraft, the cost of which had been estimated at about £32,000, they are now prepared to finance purchases made through the Air Ministry between now and the 1st April 1938, up to a maximum total figure which they have fixed at £45,000. This sum would be repayable by the Afghan Government in six equal annual instalments, the first instalment falling due on the shipment of the material bought. to the Afghan Government and the grant of training to pilots Ali Mohammad Khan, It would be for/for the Afghan Government to decide how to utilise these credit facilities for .the purchase of British aircraft material. 3. If the Afghan Government should wish to purchase hind aircraft, eight machines could be made available this year (subject to agreement regarding the terms of payment) two being ready for shipment in January, two in February, two in March and two in April next. 4. With reference to your enquiry regarding the meaning of the fifth paragraph of my note of the 5th December last, I am glad to be able to inform you that the Government of India’s offer to train pilots and mechanics is not conditional on any undertaking on the part of the Afghan Government to buy more than eight Minds. That offer was connected with the proportion of their requirements which the Afghan Government purchased from British sources rather than with the purchase of any particular number of British machines; and His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India agree that the intentions of the Afghan Government as explained by you on 7th December would make the training offered wortr while. In this connexion the Government of India assume that the Afghan Government would bear the cost of the food, accommodation and transportation of the personnel under training. 5. You also enquired whether wireless telegraphy equipment similar to that now installed in Hinds in the Royal Air Force could be made available. I understand that this particular equipment is still in an experimental stage and/and cannot be supplied* Any other wireless telegraphy equipment could, however, be obtained by the Afghan Government either direct from the firms concerned or through the Air Ministry. 6. As regards your comment on the high price of British machines, the Afghan Government may be ixiterested to know that the Air Ministry have available for sale up to ten or twelve Wapiti aircraft, which might be useful to the Afghan Air Force for training purposes. These machines could be sold to the Afghan Government for £500 each in full flying trim complete with engines, equipment and a small range of spares which is at present available. They are part-worn, but are in the same condition as Wapitis used by the Royal Air Force, and have a substantial life remaining; and they are of a type now in service in India. 7.

The Afghan Consul at Karachi could presumably find a contractor who would undertake to provide all that is required.

Your letter of the 8 th January to Williams is under consideration hut I should explain that there appear to he serious objections to your proposal that Afghanistan should have the advantage of special prices negotiated for British Government orders. The matter has heen put to higher authority and you will receive a further communication on this point. if the Air Ministry act on your behalf the negotiations will he on the basis of foreign order prices and not on the basis of special British Government concessions. You will readily realise that firms will not be willing to give us special prices if we use them to undercut the foreign market. This point is of great importance both as affecting India’s future orders and our own. For the present, however, it must be assumed that I hope this letter will give you the information you require Yours sincerelyINDIA OFFICE, © P^. 158/37. 8 th January, 1937 • Will you please refer to the correspondence regarding the proposed sale of military aircraft to the Afghan Government? This has hitherto proceeded on the assumption that the Air Ministry would not he prepared to agree to the sale of material for Afghanistan to the Government of India on terms similar to those on which the Government of India obtain aircraft for their ov^tl puip&gt;oses. We would, however, he grateful if the Air Ministry would consider whether it would not he possible to treat the proposed sale as a transaction between the Air Ministry and the Government of India, whereby the latter would obtain the aircraft at the special Government price and v/ould be free to dispose of them subsequently to the Afghan Government. We appreciate the desirability - in the normal run of cases - of permitting aircraft manufacturers in the United Kingdom to make a larger Squadron Air Ministry, W.C.2.2 . profit on material sold to foreign Governments than that which they make on material sold for use Toy the R.A.F. But in the present instance the aircraft would he bought in any case by the Government of India in the first place and there is the possibility that much of the purchase price wil.i. not be recoverable from the Afghan Government, moreover, while it is extremely unlikely that the Government of India would be able to finance purchases up to anything like the figure of £ 80 , 000 , which is believed to be the .value of the goods desired by the Afghan / Go/erument, it is of course desirable that whatever sum they can afford should cover as much material as possible. For this reason the reduction in price which would follow j. rom tne treatment of the transaction as an ordinary sale to mho Government of India would be most useful. In fact in substance the transaction is really one between the Air Ministry and the Government of India the purpose of which is to promote British political and strategical interests in Afghanistan. Possibly the decision already taken that, in respect or material lor which the Government of India are providing credit the Afghan Government would negotiate with the Air/d Jp* T ~'*T r~ y “/aCfeSKMfr-- Air Ministry and not direct with the nanufacturers, makes it easier for you to agree to the suggestion made in this letter.

If you v/ill refer to my D.O. letter of the 9th December to Rumbold, you will see that I stated there that if the proposed procedure proved acceptable, it would be necessary for the Government of India (or the Secretary of State) to advise us that the aeroplanes may be paid for from Indian funds and of the 'Head of Service' to which the payment to the firm and to the Air Ministry for inspection, should be debited. I notice, however, that in your letter of the 24th December to Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, you asked the Government of India to 'send the necessary instructions' to the India Store Department. I understand from Rumbold that if the Government of India accept the procedure, all the negotiations with the Air Ministry and the firm for the supply of the aircraft will be carried on by the India Office and that we should only be called upon to make the necessary payments and to ship the stores. If this is so, it is essential that the instructions of the Government of India to us should make it clear that the necessary funds for making these payments are provided in the High Commissioner’s Budget. V/ill this be clear to the Government of India from your previous correspondence with them? If not, it seems desirable that it should be made clear as soon as possible. J.C.

Collier, Bea., C. li. 0. , Foreign ^ifice# X - •18th December concerning the proposed Afghan purchases, I found that the Treasury were very desirous of helping but that the proposal to waive departmental expenses gave rise to so many potential difficulties that they were unable to agree to drop them altogether. The main difficulty was in regard to inspection. The Treasury view was that this is an important safeguard both for the Afghans and ourselves, and that if it is carried out there are no grounds on which the charge can be dropped. As you know, we always charge India and the Dominions for inspection. It would be difficult to give better treatment to the Afghan Government. I am afraid, therefore, that the normal charge of 2/o on complete airframes and engines ; and 3% on other equipment, if inspected, must be enforced. No doubt some of the inspection has already been done. The Treasury were, however, agreeable to the waiver of the charge for administration. ^ The above applies to the purchases made from Hawkers. Should any equipment be required from the Air Ministry, it would be necessary to charge the full departmental expenses of 9% but this need not show up. An inclusive charge could be made either to Hawkers or direct to the India Store Department for this equipment. ^• As regards the Wapitis, the Treasury are willing that these should be sold at £500 each in full flying trim complete with engines, equipment and a small range of spares H.

As you knov/, the Afghan Government have decided to re-establish on modern lines their Air Force, which at present consists of three or four old and practically useless machines. The existence of an efficient Afghan Air Force would be of political value to His Majesty's Government as tending to strengthen the present friendly regime. From the strategic point of view it is desirable that this nevz Force should be equipped and organised on the same lines as the hoyal Air Force and that a liaison should be established between the officers of the two Forces. This would facilitate, in the event of hostilities in which Afghanistan is our ally, co-operation between the two Air Forces ana the supply of spare equipment to the Afghan Air Force. In the contrary event we would be able to cut off the Afghan supply of spares, he believe that the preference of the Afghan Government is to rely on us in the establishment of their Air Force. We know, however, that the Germans are ready to give them substantial credits for the purchase of armaments, and the fact that many of the existing pilots In the Afghan Air Force were trained/3. trained in Italy, may incline them to regard sympathetically any offer which they may receive from the Italian Government. 17e also know that the Afghans are finding British equipment extremely expensive. 3. The Government of India have agreed to give the Afghan Government extended credit facilities for the purchase of a limited number of aircraft ana to give free training in India to Afghan pilots and mechanics. These facilities will be financed out of the Afghan Reserve Fund which, after discussion with the Treasury, the Government of India set up this year to meet expenditure connected with the maintenance of the stability of the Afghan Government. It is desirable not to place too great a strain upon the fund and we have promised the Treasury to draw upon it gradually at the outset in order to allow it to accumulate. The total sum which the fund can afford in respect of aircraft and ancillary equipment is now under consideration, but we are anxious that, whatever this sum is it will cover as much material as possible, and we therefore hope that the Air Ministry's departmental charges/&lt;81 DEC 1936 4. charges may be waived and that any other possiole reduction in jjricos may he efiected. 4. As regards the Wapitis, v; T e believe that the intentions of the Afghan Government are to buy a certain amount of equipment in the United Kingdom, provided the]/ can afford Tlessrs. Hawkers 1 prices, and to look aoroad for cheaper aircraft to meet their remaining requirements. If they are willing to take Wapitis it may oe possiole to prevent them purchasing many or indeed any cheap aircraft abroad. We therefore hope that you will be able to quote the lowest possible price for them. When the Afghan Minister next calls at the Foreign Office, it is proposed to tell him that Wapitis are available at low prices and to offer to give him a quotation. It is therefore urgent that His Majesty’s Government should be in a position to quote a definite figure to the Afghans. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Foreign Office. L Xfcmm ainoerote.

Dear Mr. Rendel, Captain Bayendor returned from Paris this morning. He . . . witnessed demonstrations of French aircraft at Villacoublay. Whilst there they had an opportunity of conversing with the gentleman from Afghanistan. According to Bayendor this gentleman is the prospective chief of the Afghan Air Force and he informed them that he had been to Germany and Great Britain where he had seen several factories. After his visit to France he was returning to latest products. At the lunch at Villacoublay this gentleman was given the seat of honour next to Mons. Pierre Cot. They gathered that it was intended to eventually acquire a considerable Air Force but that apparently there was financial difficulty. It was stated that the Soviet Authorities were prepared to supply on very favourable terms but it was not possible to obtain any idea as to whether this proposal was viewed with favour. (Sd.) H.K.

'T- - fuJ AFGHANISTAN Negotiations with the Afghan Government for the sale of aircraft on credit terms and the grant of free training in India to Afghan pilots and mechanics. Under Secretary / Secretary of State.... Previous papers :— Copy of to I FOR INFORMATION. The Secretary of State has not seen these papers since April (P.Z.9175/35). There have recently been a number of developments but the file has been in constant use in connection with the disposal of points of detail. 2. The negotiations are extremely complicated, partly because the Afghan Government have been characteristically vague regarding their intentions, and partly because there are two limitations on our ability to supply their requirements. In the first place, the R.A.F. re-equipment programme enables us to supply aircraft to the Afghans only at the expense of slowing down to that extent our own programme. The Air Ministry have, however, agreed to release six Hinds in the current financial year and at least/ 3330 1000 12.34HI * least two more next year (Air Ministry letters of 12th October and 20th October, Nos. P. Z. 7375/36 and P. Z. 7539/3 6). t^*ao uy\\.V '^cSVitx'o'U^Aac CiOc^WoVs. d.u.v\^. The second limitation is imposed by the difficulty of making available more than a certain amount of money from the Afghan Reserve Fund in order to give the Afghan Government credit facilities, without which they have expressed their inability to buy aircraft from this country. The Government of India have, however, offered to make available during the current financial year funds which were calculated to suffice for five machines (about £32,000) to be paid for in six equal annual instalments, or^provided the Afghans agreed to make a more substantial initial payment or to shorter credit terms, to facilitate the purchase of eight machines. They have also held out hopes of further funds being available in future financial years (vide Government of India telegram of 9th October, P.Z.7288/36). 3. A further complication has been introduced in connection with the training of Afghan pilots and mechanics in India. It is, of course, most important that these students should come to us for their training (vide India Office telegram of 1st October, No. P. Z.6692/36), and it is understood that the Afghan Government have decided definitely in favour of India. The Government of India, however, at first asked that in return for the training of ten pilots and ten mechanics the Afghan Government should give an assurance that they intend to build up their air force mainly from British sources (vide P.Z.7288/36). The Afghan Government have taken strong exception to this suggestion, and any such assurance would be contrary to their traditional policy of not allowing either Great Britain or Russia to obtain any special position in their country (Kabul telegram of 3rd November, P. Z. 7885/3 6) . We then toned down our stipulation to a request for information regarding the intentions of/Minute Paper. &lt;?2 «8oTjlt //w ^ ^ * / *S' JUu, %+S -ttn fr*U Ca^C u.tt 3C fa* ft, ^ fac^% KyJj ^ /C | A-*/' Avyv/^^t tC-^v, 4» /v*^&lt; ^ ^ 47!;5 5000 5.36 ^ /^ / ‘t of the Afghan Govermient and a statement that the offer of training was based on the anticipation that the Afghan GoYernment would come to us for a substantial proportion of their requirements. If this anticipation is not fulfilled, that would be a new factor to be taken into consideration in connection with the question of training. o©\£. Wevaa*\&amp; aV* KaWl The offer made to the Afghan Government is conveniently stated in the Foreign Office note of 5th December to the Afghan Minister in London (P.Z.8759/36). Shah Mahmud has promised Colonel Fraser-Tytler at Kabul to furnish us with *r the information desired. 4. Muhammad Ihsan, the Commandant of the Afghan Air Force, has been sent by his Government to Europe in order to advise them what machines to buy. He has been in France and Germany and is now in the United Kingdom. As he was himself trained in Italy, there is some fear that he may be prejudiced in favour of Italian material. The Air Ministry have attached a senior officer to him during his stay and are arranging that he should see different types of aircraft, aircraft works and training centres, etc. He appears to have been instructed to purchase eight aircraft from this country and to look abroad for cheaper machines to fulfil his Government's remaining requirements (Kabul telegram of 2nd September , P. Z. 6371/36). 5. The Afghan Minister has asked two questions regarding the Foreign Office Note of 5th December (P.Z.8759/36); first, whether our offer means that it is out of the question for eight Hinds to be sold on the terms of payment contemplated for five, namely, six equal annual instalments. If Hawkers are ready to give the Government of India credit, the Government of India will no doubt be K ready to meet the Afghans on this point. The Afghan Minister/Minister has also asked^ whether^in order to obtain free training of pilots and mechanics in India, it is necessary for the Afghan Government to buy more than eight machines in this country. This is a difficult point. One answer would be that as our offer of training is dependent upon the proportion of their requirements which the Afghans get from us, we cannot answer until we know how many machines they intend to buy abroad. But there is really an illogicality in the Government of India’s attitude in desiring that the Afghans should rely on us for the bulk of their requirements, because it seems likely that the Afghan requirements are too large to be covered by such credit facilities as ^fhe •Government of India’s Afghan Reserve + s * Fund can afford. 6. For example, Mhd.Ihsan has asked Messrs.Hawkers for a quotation for eight Hinds with ancillary equipment, the value of which altogether is likely to be about £80,000, or £10,000 per aircraft. The Government of India’s offer of five aircraft this year was based on the assumption that each would cost about £6,420. On the other hand the Air Ministry advise us that Messrs.Hawkers will probably be ready to give the Government of India credit. 7. The Air Ministry have been asked what is the price of each machine with essential equipment. When we have this information we shall be able to consult the Government of India regarding a revised offer to the Afghans which could cover what we can do in 1937-38 as we as in 1936-37. This offer might be expressed in the form of a sum of money in respect of which we are able to give the Afghans credit. We could leave it to the Afghans to purchase what aviation equipnent they like with/Minute Paper Department. — with this money; anything over this sum which they wish to spend being provided by themselves in cash. 8. The Air Ministry have available some obsolescent Wapitis which could probably be sold for between £600-1,000 each, and if the Afghans are ready to take old machines this would help to solve both our financial problem and theirs as well as enabling them to fulfil the Government of India's desiderata regarding training. But it may be desirable to urge the Government of India to agree that if the Afghans buy eight Hinds in this country they should get their v * training. \ vS 9. The Afghans have refused to negotiate direct with British firms and the Air Ministry have agreed to act as a post office between them. reserve fund to finance purchases. Muhanmad Ihsan has value of which is said to be in the neighbourhood of ^80,000, which is far beyond the capacity of the fund this year, and perhaps for some years to come. We suggested to the F.O. (minutes on P.Z. 8807/36 below this submission) that it would be advisable at once to give the Afghan Minister an indication (in figures) of the extent of credit facilities availablej hitherto the Afghans have been told that these extend to the purchase of five Hinds this year; this offer was based on advice given us by the Air Ministry as to the.cost of each Hind with armament, but it seems possible that they might think that/ The major consideration which we must bear in mind is the limitation of the capacity of the G. of I.’s asked the manufacturers for a quotation for materiel thethat the offer covers much more ancillary equipment than in fact it can do, Mr. Collier, however, does not wi^i to coirmonicate a comprehensive figure to the Afghan Minister just yet, and apparently does not think that there is much danger of misunderstanding and subsequent disillusionment. We have sent the letter of 14th December below to the A.M. regarding the cost of the Hinds and equipment, and as soon as we get the additional information asked for we will telegraph to the G. of I. to inform them of the latest developments and to ascertain to what extent in the near future the fund can meet the Afghan requirements. We should then give the Afghans a figure up to which they can purchase on credit. As regards the minor point about the G. of I.'s desire to make the training of personnel dependent in some way on the extent of the purchase of materiel from British sources, this is not quite logical, because the latter obviously itself deoends on the G. of I.’s power to finance credits; this is the prior question. The Afghans have already given us as much information as we seem likely to get, or can reasonably expect in the circumstances, about the British materiel which they intend to buy (see Ali Mohamed* s statement in the second paragraph of Mr. Collier's note of 7th December - P.Z. 3800/36). In telegraphing to the G. of I. we can inform them of this and suggest that it goes as far as we can expect. /?.47U5 5000 5.86 supplied/ Minute Paper. p.z. 8807 / 36 . POLITICAL Department. Mr. Walton, At a meeting at the Air Ministry on the 10th Decemher it transpired that Muhammad Ihsan has asked Hawkers to quote for 8 Hinds with ancillary equipment, and that Hawkers quotation is likely to he about £80,000. We have (+ ifi** hitherto assumed that each Hind would cost about £6,220 at Karachi. If the Afghans are given all the equipment they want it now appears that the price will work out at about £10,000 each. Part of the additional equipment desired by the Afghans is reasonable, and essential, and consists of such things as spare engines. On the other hand some of it is aerodrome equipment, for which it does not seem necessary, from the point of biew of policy, to give the Afghans credit facilities. It will probably be possible to beat down Hawkers’ quotation a bit. The Air Ministry also hold the view that Hawkers would probably be ready to give the Government of India credit so that in the event of 8 aircraft being delivered this financial year, the Government of India’s payments could be extended over the years 1936-37, 1937-38 and 1938-39* It would be for the Government of India to put up a proposition on these lines, through the Air Ministry, to Hawkers. As regards procedure, I think the best coursers to get the Air Ministry’s advice regarding how much of the ancillary equipment is reasonable, then to put the case before the Government of India and in the light of their reply to make an offer to Hawkers. Until we get ^awkers^ answer it will not be possible to give a firm reply to Ali Mohamed’s request of 7th December whether 8 Hinds can be2. ^ . . . supplied in return six equal annual instalments. This is going to involve some delay? and an interim reply to Ali Mohamed seems necessary. A draft letter is suggested on the lines of which Mr. Collier may wish to write or talk to Ali Moharned. We have told the Afghans that we can finance the purchase of a certain number of Hinds (on the basis of figures of cost given us by the Air Ministry)* It seems now essential to inform them of the total amount of money that can be provided for these purchases, since it seems that they may have conceived the notion that they have carte blanche to purchase any amount of equipment with each machine. If we do not inform them of the limits of the credit facilities available, there will be a bad let-down for them later. To avoid this we ought, i think, to tell Ifohamed (Ali at once the amount which the G. of I. have up to date indicated that they can spend. The next thing will be to inform the G. of !• by telegraph of the latest developments in the situation; for this purpose the Air Ministry should tell us whether they adhere to the figure of the cost of each Hind previously given, and if not, what is the amount and value of the equipment which they regard as essential to each machine.

I also understood that the A.M. are asking Hawkers to let them have a list of the material for which the Afghans have sought a quotation, and also for a copy of the quotation. Our estimates of the liability which would fall upon the Govt.’s Afghan reserve fund in respect of 5 Hinds, have been based upon the information contained m A.M. official letters No. S.35888/S.6 of 6th June and 10th June, i.e., the figures of £5500 for each Hind including iinspection on a certificate of airworthiness standard, and £120 for shipment to India, with the addition of £700-800 for armament (the figure given us by Darvall), making a total of about £6420 for each aircraft. This figure for five ninds would not greatly exceed the sum of £30,000 which the G. of I. mentioned in their telegram of 9th May as the amount which they could make available at once from their fund. We niist also^assume^that any credit 5319c 5000 10.36 facilities/* - facilities which the G. of I. coaid finance for the purchase of three more Hinds after the end of the present financial year would be similarly limited to the figure stated above for each aircraft.

For this purpose, could you tell us^whether the figure previously given for the cost of a Hind with armament still stands, and, if not, what is the amount and value of equipment which is considered to be essential equipment for each machine. It may perhaps become desirable to tell the Afghans that our offer of credit terns to them is limited to purchases for such-and-i such a total figure, which would be arrived at after consultation with the G. of I. and after taking account of whatever credit terms Hawkers may be ready to give to the G. of I. In the meantime, in order to prevent a big misunderstanding later on which might have unfortunate consequences, we are suggesting to the F.0. that the Afghan Minister should be informed at once of the pecuniary limit of the G• of I.’s offer (as it stands at present) of credit facilities/Draft Paper.

D*Qj s* explained that the foreign Offioe had been in consultation with the AFGHAN Minister in LONBJ^ t and it would appear there were three points on which the Minister wanted information. The first point was whether the AFGHANS could nave immediate delivery of eight Hind aircraft. 2# B. C.a.3. said t e original intention was to supply six in the present financial year and a further two in 19 37. He thought the time was now very short before the next financial year, and he would endeavour to get A.M.S.O. to provide eight aircraft at once. At any rate delivery should be complete by April 1937. 3. Mr. Kumbold explained that tne Government of INBIk held what is called an AFGHAN fund and it was from this fund that payment for the aircraft would be nade in the first place. He would like to know the approximate cost of the aircraft. 4. Group Captain field said trial the total cost would be in the region of £80,000. The cost per aircraft was £6,250, but the spares and equipment the AFGHANS required brought the price up to apr roxi aately £10,000 each. 5. Mr. Kumbold explained that the Government of India had n&lt; committed themselves to give credit for sums beyond about £35,000, and that there was insufficient money in the Afghan Keserve Fund to pay £8Q f 0o0 this year. It would not, however, be impossible to make payments to this total over a period of two or more financial years. 6. B.O.A.S. said he felt essrs. Hawkers would accept payment spread over a period of years in this case, as the payments were guaranteed by the Government of INBIa.

After some discussion it was decided:- (i) Messrs. Hawkers should be asked to quote a price for eight aircraft, with the spares required. (ii) That Messrs. Hawkers s lould deal with the Air Ministry, acting on behalf of the Government of IKD1A, and not with the AkGHAft Government. (iii) That the INbXa Office should put to the air Ministry for trans mission to the firm a proposition regarding payment, in terms of financial years, after consultation with the Government of INDIA. 8. D.D.Qps* stated the second point on which information was required was whether the Government of DsDIu's offer to train pilots and mechanics was conditional on any undertaking to buy more than eight aircraft. 9. Mr. Kumbold explained that the Afghan Government were) informed t irourh the British Minister in Kabul that the offer of the Government of India to train ten pilots and ten ob ohanics was dependent upon an undertaking by the Afghan Government that they would rely mainly on us for the development of their air Force so far as we could meet their requirements. The Afghans had jibbed at this and the demand for an undertaking had been toned down to a request for information regarding the intentions of the Afghan Government, and a statement that the offer was based on the anticipation that the Afghans would purchase a substantial proportion of their requirements from British sources. In the event of this anticipation not being fulfilled, the matter would require to be re-examined. Information regarding the Afghan Intentions is still awaited. 10* Arising out of a suggestion by the AFGHAN Government that the prices for British aircraft were higher than they could afford, A.1.1. stated that we had available a number of reconditioned WaPIT; aircraft which could be sold at a very small price, probably in the region of £1,000 each.-2^ 11 • !)»J. explained that this type is still in use in the K,A # P. in IftDlA, and is in nany ways fsn ideal type for advanced training* 12* Mr* Collier said he would place this information before the AFGHAN Minister* It would probably be acceptable as 'OHAMMED XiiSAM had obviously been given instructions to buy eight Hinds from us, and to look around for cheaper aircraft* D*C*^.«S* said our own policy in training of foreign pilots was that the training was given quite unconditionally in the hope that it would Induce the countries concerned to buy our aircraft. His advice was that the Foreign Office and India Office should not attach too onerous conditions to the question of training* 14. The final point was that the AFGHAN Government had asked whether they could have similar W/T equipment to that now installed in Hinds in the Koyal Air Force* F«0«4* stated he had spoken to Signals on this matter, and the answer was that this particular equipment was still experimental and on the Secret List, and could not be supplied outside the Royal Air Force. E*C*ii*S* pointed out that the AJGcutN GGV&amp;BiiMKLJ could obtain any other ^/T equipment either from the firms concerned or through the Air Ministry* 14.12.1936.r . 8807 / 56. 14th Dec«isb#r 1^36.

Rumbold, Esq., Political Department India Office, S.W.1Copy. (N 6086/593/97). 1^3 v J ^oo hL The Afghan Minister called to-day to ask for the elucidation of certain points in our Note to him of December 5th, about the supply of British aircraft for his Government (see N 5972/593/97). He said that Mohammad Ihsan f s present intention was to advise the purchase of eight ’’Hinds” and that it had been understood from the conversations betv/een Colonel Fraser Tytler and the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Kabul that eight machines could be made available. Now, however, it was stated, in our Note that no more than six were available with certainty and that eight machines could only be supplied if the terms of payment at present proposed were modified. Even as it was, the Afghan Government found British machines very expensive, compared to those which were being offered them from other countries, and they could only contemplate buying the eight machines on the present terms of payment. He therefore wished to knov/ whether our Note was to be interpreted as meaning that this v/as out of the question. The second point on which the Minister wished for elucidation was the meaning of the fifth paragraph of our Note. As he had already said, the question of price was a very serious one for the Afghan Government - so serious, indeed, that, though they would like to buy even up to thirty British machines, if possible, they were, to speak frankly, very doubtful whether they could buy more than the eight ’’Kinds” without some special financial accommodation. This being so, it was vital to them to know whether the Government of India’s offer to train pilots and mechanics was conditional on any undertaking to buy more than these eight machines.To this I replied that, while I was sure there was no intention to present the Afghan Government with anything in the nature of a 'take it or leave it' ultimatum on the point, I did not myself know how far the Air ministry and the Government of India were, or v/ere not, prepared to go, either in this matter or in the other which he had mentioned; and I added that, as I was informed that Group- Captain Field had already suggested to Mohammad Ihsan that any points needing elucidation should he discussed at a meetiig on Thursday next and had been told that this suggestion would he referred to the Minister, I wondered whether a meeting would not he desirable. The Minister, hov/ever, did not seem to want a meeting, saying that all he needed was a reply on these two points and on one more, v/hich he was about to mention, though it did not arise out of the Note; so I did not press the suggestion. The other point in question concerned the supply of wireless to the aircraft to he bought. Mohammad Ihsan, it appeared, had arranged with the Air Ministry that they should inform him what spare parts etc. were needed for the machines and should help him to place orders for these; hut they seemed unwilling to arrange for fitting wireless to the planes and had referred him to the wireless firms such as Marconi’s, whereas he wanted them to arrange for the machines to he fitted with the same wireless sets as j they used themselves. I said I would see what could he done in this matter. It looks as if we had better have an interdepartmental meeting on Thursday, without the Afghans, to discuss what reply to return to these enquiries. (Signed) L. COLLIIiiR. Zth December. 1956mmmm Please see India Office minutes v/ithin. The only point which seems to call for comment is the desire of the India Office that the conversations on the supply of aircraft and the training of pilots should be concentrated at Kabul. It might certainly cause confusion if negotiations were to be carried on in two places at once; but the Afghan Minister has definitely said that Ihsan wanted to discuss here ''various important matters affecting the whole future of 'the Afghan Air Force'. (N.5592/595/97). Moreover the Minister in his note in N.5852/593/97 says that Ihsan has already tried to pursue the matter here with Group-Captain Field, who referred him to the Foreign Office. For us now to refer him back to Kabul might surely try his patience unduly. It is true that Ihsan is not a very important person in Afghanistan, compared say with Shah Mahmud, but the fact that the Afghan Government have sent him alone on this mission shows that they have considerable confidence in him. I understand that the India Office do not at all object to a meeting with Ihsan at which Air Ministry, India Offk^andForeign Office would be represented, but that they feel that on all but technical questions of material etc. we should only listen to what Ihsan says and reply that we must consider our attitude[and will communicate it to the Afghan Government at Kabul^j Clearly we must first hear what Ihsan has to say but I submit that we should not make up our minds now that we can give him no answer here. If/If this view prevails we should have to modify the 2nd paragraph of the telegram to Kabul, for which I have suggested an amendment, ana the draft to the Afghan Minister would also have to be amended: it is in fact questionable whether we should not add to it a sentence saying that if Ihsan would like a meeting we shall be very glad to see him. [And we might in any case say that we hope soon to be able to reply to his other note - N.5851]. The concurrence of the Air Ministry is required in both drafts. They will give their views to Inaia Office - see attached copy of letter from Mr. Rumbold to Wing-Commander Pirie. (There has been a rather doubtful indication that the Afghans contemplate buying aeroplanes from us not by instalments). (Signed) B.A.B.BURROWS 4.12. I agree with Mr. Burrows in principle; but I now understand that Ihsan is leaving on Tuesday next. If so, we shall probably be enabled automatically to continue the negotiations at Kabul, and it may not be necessary to decide what to say to the Afghan Minister on that point. In the circumstances, I should prefer to end the telegram to Kabul at the word '’instructions'* and see what happens when we have our last meeting with Ihsan. If Ihsan v/ere to say, at that meeting, that the Afghan Minister here had full powers to negotiate an agreement, then I think we should deal with the Minister. If, as is more likely, he does not, then we have a good excuse for transferring the rest of the discussions to Kabul. (Intd. ) L. C. December 4th. The/The India Office have now informed us that Ihsan is not necessarily leaving next week.

Sir, In reply to your note No.1162 of 24th November regarding the training of Afghan aviation students in India, I have the honour to inform you that the attitude of His majesty’s Government on this Question and on the connected questions of the number of aircraft which they are prex^ared to sell to the mfghan Government and of the terms on which they are to be sold, is as set out below; and His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul has been instructed to approach the Afghan Grvernment on these lines. 2. As regards the supply of aircraft which can be made available (subject to satisfactory terms of payment being || arranged; six ’Audax f or 'Hinds' can with certainty be made available during the present financial year. As regards possible further supplies, His majesty's Government are earnestly desirous of meeting the Afghan Government’s requirements to the greatest practicable extent and, subject to the arrangement of satisfactory terms of payment, it is hoped that it may be possible to make available in 1937 and 1938 sufficient aircraft to meet their further requests, provided definite information is given soon oi the exact types and the number of machines required and the date on which delivery is desired or the period over which it can be spread. The practicability of meeting the requirements of the Afghan Government largely depends on this information being given as much in advance as possible. 3. As regards the terms of payment for any aircraft supplied during the present financial year, there are two alternatives ohammad Khan,alternatives. They are either that payment for five aircraft delivered in the present financial year should he made in six equal annual instalments, the first of v/hich would he due on delivery, or that aircraft up to eight could he supplied on credit during the present financial year provided they are available and provided the Afghan Government can agree to shorter credit terms or make a more substantial payment on delivery. The terms of payment for further possible supplies would have to he negotiated after His Majesty’s Government have been informed of the requirements of the Afghan Government. 4. As regards the training of pilots and mechanics the Government of India are willing, subject to what is said in the following paragraph, to offer free training at Karachi for ten pilots and ten mechanics on the scale suggested by muhammad Ihsan Khan while in India. The question of training further students could be considered after experience has been obtained in connexion with the training of the first batch of Afghan pilots and mechanics and of the expense and risk involved, 5. The question of training is connected with that of the proportion of their new machines which the Afghan Government wish to obtain from British sources. The Government of India's scheme for training contemplates that it would be carried out mainly on the Afghan Government’s own new machines. Moreover, the cost of training ten pilots and ten meohanics to the Government of India would be Hs.l lakh (£7,500], and if the Government of India incur this expense, they wish that it should confer the maximum benefit to the Afghan Government. The value of the training will be enhanced if a substantial proportion of the machines which the pilots will subsequently fly and the mechanics maintain are similar to those on which they have been trained.trained. The offer regarding training is therefore based on the anticipation that in their own interests the ,fghan Government will purchase a substantial proportion of their machines from British sources, so far as His Majesty’s Government can supply their requirements. They recognise, hov/ever, that their ability to supply the Afghan requirements depends on the extent of the latter and that, if the Afghan Government wish for cheap machines, British sources may not be able to supply them, although of course His Majesty's Government will do their best when they know the Afghan requirements. If His Majesty's Government's anticipation that a substantial proportion of the new Afghan aircraft will be British is not fulfilled, this would be a new factor v/hich would have to be taken into consideration in connexion with the question of training. 6. I hope to be able to reply shortly to the further enquiry contained in your note Ho.1161 of the 24th November.

This would be the most convenient procedure to us^provided of course that it does not raise the price of the material by more than the equivalent of reasonable interest on the cash price. If the Companies are not willing to adopt this procedure, it seems necessary that there should be a contract between the Companies and a British authority, whereby the material is bought for cash. There would then be ano-bh or-contract between H.M.G. and the Afghan Government providing for the repayment to us in instalments of the amount paid by us to the Companie.s^j} ^Tt seems unnecessary for the purpose of enabling the Companies to give quotations to reach a decision regarding what British authority would contract with them.

C. £• I I.Z.8564/36Muhammad Ihsan that th© views of uis Majesty’s Government on the matters dealt with in the draft note to the Afghan Minister would he communioat ed to him orally at a meeting. It seems, however, heat to communicate these views on paper, and if Ali Mohammad and Muhammad Ihsan still wish for a meeting after they get our note, one could then he arranged. I am sending tp^dopy of this letter to Burrows at the Fc^sign Office. I © &lt;T~^ v ‘ a si,Minute Paper. 4. POLITICAL 47U5 5000 5.36 Mry^alton, The Government of India’s telegram No.2850 rather obscures the issue for Colonel Fraser-Tytler, because, while it agrees that he should approach the Afghan Government on the lines of Forminka No.74, it suggests that he should repeat the request already made for an undertaking from which Forminka 74 was designed to enable us to withdraw as gracefully as possible. A draft telegram to Kabul is suggested dealing with this point. We are now in a position to answer the Afghan Minister’s note of 24th November regarding the training of aviation students in India. He has increased the Afghan demand from 10 pilots, 10 mechanics and 6 observers to 23-27 pilots, 6-7 observers, 8-11 mechanics and 2 radio mechanics; but I do not think this should affect our reply, as more Afghano , he is probably asking for much more than he hopes to get. It would be useful at the same time to inform Ali Muhammad of the offer which Colonel Fraser-Tytler has made to the Afghans regarding the sale of aircraft. I understand that owing to its complicated nature and language difficulties Group Captain Field has thought it best not to communicate orally to Muhammad Ihsan the contents of the note which we prepared for that purpose. (Flag a). He contemplated a meeting for this purpose at the Air Ministry at which Ali Muhammad could be present and the Afghans^ask for such a meeting. It seems however best to communicate our offer in writing to begin with, and as I understand from Group Captain Field that Muhammad Ihsan is pressing for information regarding our attitude and has already been here almost a week on his second visit, it is urgent to issue a reply to Ali Muhammad’s note. If Muhammad Ihsan tries to bargain at a meeting, it will be necessary to tell him that negotiations had/ wr2, had 'better 'be concentrated at Kabul, but we are glad to listen to anything he has to say.

The passage marked X on page 6 of the first report (paragraph 3(a)) in N.5740/595/97 (P.Z.7601/36) suggests that successive batches of 10 were contemplated. But I do not think that the Government of India have realized that this is what the Afghans really want - see e.g. the attached summary of what the Afghan Government have been offered. Mohammad Ihsan originally said that he hoped to have some general discussions with His Majesty*s Govern ment and this question will presumably arise in the course of them. It might be useful first to have a small meeting between Foreign Office, India Office and Air Ministry.

He wanted to discuss various important matters affecting the whole future of the Afghan Air Force; and as these were of more than technical interest, the Minister proposed to be with him at the discussions and would like to know where they were to take place. I said that I had assumed that the discussions would take place at the Air Ministry; and even if they involved political considerations, I thought it wo Id still probably be more convenient to hold them there, though a Foreign Office representative, like myself, and perhaps representatives of other Departments as well (I was thinking of the India Office, though I did not mention any name) might be present. I would get into touch with the Air Ministry, however, and find out their views. The Minister then said that Mohammed Ihsenwanted to see various types of machines here, and that he presumed he would be taken to several factories. (I am not quite clear what he meant by this; but I suppose Moharnned Ihsan wants to see more tha i the two types of machines which have been offered to the Aighan A r Force, so as to compare these with other types). To this I replied that I fcnew the Air Ministry had already been working out a programme of visits for Mohammed Ihsan and that the latter could raise the point with the Air Force Officer who had been detailed for attendance on him and would meet him at Croydon tomorrow.

My dear Collier, I have seen your letter of the 3rd Noveraber No. N. 5334/593/97 addressed to Boyle, who has told me that since you wrote your Department has ascertained that in all probability the Government Hospitality Fund will be able to pay railway fares for Mohammed Ihsan and his colleagues when they visit our Units. I wish to suggest, however, that if the visit is to have the results we hope for, it will be necessary, in my opinion, to go somewhat further than payment of railway fares and the provision of an official luncheon. I feel sure that in Italy, France and Germany, the Afghans will have been given hospitality far in advance of that proposed by ourselves, and I think that for part of his visit he should be entertained as a Government guest in the same way that we entertained Baron Munnerheim when he was here. We are prepared to give him all the necessary facilities in respect of visits, and I have arranged that a senior officer - Group Captain Field - should be at Mohammed Ihsan T s disposal during the time of his visit, but it seems clear that we must scale up our degree of hospitality if we wish to compete with other countries and to impress the Afghans. We have heard no more of the date of Mohammed Ihsan f s/ Laurence Collier, Esq., C.M.G Foreign Office,Ihsan^ visit, and I wonder whether you could find out from Berlin, where I believe he now is, when he is to be expected. Yours sincerely. (Signed) C.L. Courtney/ AIR MINISTRY. ADASTRAL HOUSE. KINGSWAY. W.C.2. S.39099 12th November, 19 36 Dear I have discussed your draft telegram with the Deputy Director of Operations. T 'e agree generally with the draft and the line you have taken, but feel we are perhaps trying to retract too much from our original intention of encouraging the Afghans to lean generally on us for building up their air force. Your paragraph 3 in the draft rather infers that pilots and mechanics could adapt themselves to any type of aircraft, British or foreign. This was not quite' what I intended to convey to you, and we suggest paragraph 3 might be amended to read:- '3. It seems preferable foreign country. Air Ministry advises me that pilots trained on one type of aircraft can normally, after a short conversion course, adapt themselves to another type. Mechanics, however, even after a thorough general training in engine maintenance and repair work, would require a further, although possibly shorter, course of instruction on the particular type of engine the;/ were required to maintain. Should the Afghan Air Borce be equipped with more than one type of aircraft this would not be a serious matter, although in the interests of economy and efficiency standardization of types within units is highly desirable.” I am sending a copy of this letter to Burrows at India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. copy to:- B.A.B.

I think Afghan Government have interpreted too rigidly assurance requested, but in any case it seems necessary, in view of their reaction, to modify our request. You should therefore, if Government of India agree, inform Afghan Government in following sense. 2. In requesting assurance H.M.G. had in mind that Government of India’s scheme for training contemplates that it would b carried out mainly on Afghan Government’s own new machines, and that value of training to Afghan Government will be enhanced if substantial proportion of machines which pilots subsequently fly and mechanics maintain are similar to those they have been trained on. But H.M.G. recognise that their ability to supply Afghan requirements depends on extent of latter, and that if Afghan Government wish for cheap machines British sources may not be able to supply them, although of course we will dc our best when we know Afghan requirements. H.M.G. have no intention of asking Afghan Government to surrender their freedom to buy in open market but would-^exp^bt dLhamy^TliaiTTiy; in their own interests parPt-iy/ 50 50 5000 7 36Draft Paper Department, 2 . y •~Tm«L n g.ra± i tiL dA^. to buy substantial * proportion of their machines from British sources provided other consiuerations are equal.

Thsyh. They had asked in former daye for similar help from Italy and Rueeiaj, who had readily aooeded to their requests and had asked for no assurances* In the present case they believe that small efficient air force was best guarantee for internal stability of Afghanistan, arid that such stability was of seme importance to Hie Majesty ? s Government., He asked me to look on question not as one for bargaining but from point of view that any reasonable help we could give the Afghan Government to build up internal security would be of as much value to ourselves as to them* Afghan Government did not wish to buy their aircraft from any particular country. They must buy to suit their purse* 4 C I said my Government looked on the matter from a practical, point of view* Training of twenty pilots and meohanio® would cost one lakh and would be largely wasted if they were then to use entirely different type of aircraft, we were most anxious to help to build up efficient air force in Afghanistan, value of which we fully recognised, but nothing was less likely to be efficient than an air force composed of aircraft supplied by three or four different countries. 5. Prime Minister admitted the force of these arguments but asked that further discussion should be deferred till the return in about a fortnight’s time of Shah Mahmud., whose recent experiences in Europe would enable him to advise on th© question* S 6 it is not easy to predict line the Afghan Government will take* They undoubtedly went to get as much as they can out of us for nothing, but I am doubtful whether they will think it worth while to surrender freedom to buy in the open free market in exchange for/training* Practical point of view givenmmgiven in paragraph No* 4 above will count with them but against that are (a) their unwillingness to let any {? omission) with any foreign influence predominate in any sphere ^b) their fear off oontro react ions (o) their genuine belief that British aircraft are too expensive and (d) their desire to build up an air force as quickly as possible* Much will depend on attitude of Shah Mahmud and on how far Mahammad Ihsan has been impressed by what ha has seen in England* Fraser Tytler IQl, 3rd Ifovember &amp;Copy Air Ministry, (N 5334/593/97) •672904/36/A.I.1.

On Sunuay September 20th I commenced with li hours conversation with the Comandaiit who indicated that he would like as many British aircraft (up to 24), as he could obtain at once in hngland. He would like to organise thesw into Squa^vrons witn Uiree flights on British lines maintained by an Aircr £t Repair Section, Engine Repair Section and ancillary trades. ^ requested therefore, that his visit to Drigh Road should consist of s- (I) Doeing organisation and equi^vnent for a Flight&gt; &amp; Squadron A.R.S. and E.R.S. etc., (II) Obtaining detailed lists of the tools and equipment necessary for (1). (III) Discussing the training of pilots and aimen. I left with the British Military Attacne' a co r y of Wing Comaander Thomas’s Scheme for the training of Pilots and Airmen, for translation to the Coniaandant. 2. 1st DAY MQhaAY 21flt. j\ Xhe period from 0900 until 1200 hours was devoted to the Programme outlined in the report of O.C.Depot(Appendix f A). From 1200 to 1550 I was closeted with the Com andant, British Military Attache* and the Consul. The last uwo interpreted, as the Coumndant understood no English and only a little French, In which I am not very fluent. F/0 Awan of the Indian Air Force assisted in interpreting during' the tour of shops and was extremely good with the technical -—detail—detail but the Comandant was very uneasy lest this Officer should be present during any discussions, tfe did not discuss any particular types of aircraft and he would give no indication of his likely choice except that he seemed to have taken it for granted that he would obtain at once on arrival in England upto 8 British aircraft. He seemed extremely satis fied with our maintenance and repair scheme and haJd formed a good idea how to organise his new Air Force on our lines. Having indicated to me the detailed list of Equipment etc., which he wanted prepared for him to take away he devoted the rest of the conversation to the Training Schemed 1 On this point he was very difficult# as he had it firmly rooted in his mind either from the interpretation placed on the Signals between Grovernments or from what he had been told at Peshawar that at Karachi he would be able to make definite and final arrangement for the training of his pilots and inechanics including the dates, (about January),when they should start. He was quite satisfied that we have facilities at Depot for both air and ground training and he could not unuerstand why, in such a vast place, we could not take on the utmost of his requirements without noticing any interruption or financial implications. «e devoted a long time to discussing the training scheme because he disagreed with Wing Comaander Thoma^s Scheme on the following points5- (i) All the pilots and the Mechanics are of Officer status. / i \ (n) On no account did he wish them to be accommodated in Karachi town owing to certain factious influences there by which they might be affected. (iii) His total of about 27 pilots had been trained —in— „ /in Russia, Italy or France- They each flew about once a week or fortnight from 10 minutes to half an hour, in fine weather only, and then did no flying during about three months of their winter. (iv) He could not accept only 5 pilots being trained at once and insisted upon 10. He said his Prime Minister had instructed him to get these terms and he expressed his intention of reo^iining at Karachi • Instead of leaving as scheduled on Thursday the ^4th, until he and his Government pressed further for the 10 pilots. (v) He hinted that he wanted us to train some Officer Observers upto 6 in number in elementary practical reconnaissance bombing etc., and with them two Officeio with Wireless experience. (vi) He also said that his visit to Peshawar had made him realise the necessity for more really good personnel for the maintenance and running of flights of present day aircraft. He therefore hoped that we should be able to take on at sine time 30 raw airmen mechanics and give them a thorough training. I explained to him that he had put such an entirely new aspect on the j help that he expected from us that I must refer it/to H.Q. I also pointed oux» how very much more expensive the training would become. This was the first and the only discussion of cost. He smiled and said he would like it d ne for nothing in such a big concern/and pointed out that his pilots and mechanics had been trained before in other countries with free return fares, clothes accommodation, amusement and 5 to 6 months free train- ing on aircraft belonging to their hosts. At this the conversation ended till next dayl PAY THE 22nd. A period from 0800 to 1200 hours was again devoted to a —furtherfurther Workshops tour in the Depot, a visit to &lt;61 Squadron to see their portable hangars, and, at Coirinand&amp;nt 1 s request, a visit to the Civil Air Port. Commander Watt very kindly escorted them over all the buildings and entertained them to cool drinks at his bungalow. On return to Depot the Commandant was then handed the following papers for which he had made special request ■ Vj ^ (1) A list of Equipment for the maintenance of one aircraft, and the ground equipment for one fli^it. ( ii) A list of Equipment for the overhaul of a Kestrel engine in addition to items shown in the Schedule of spare parts for that engine. Durizig his tour he was able to study one of these Schedules in detail, (iii) A list of Equipment required for the Aeroplane Repair Section with that of Auxilliary Shops, fiiv) A Blue print of a Hangar. (v) From 760 Record of Overhaul of an Aero-Engine in the E .R. S. \ From 1200 to 1330 the conversations already begun the day before were continued. The Commandant opened the conversa tion by indicating that he wished us to make a really good job of his pilots and crews including the sii Observers and the two Officers conversant with wireless. He was afraid that our scheme was too short and sharp and would result in a hurried turn out of personnel of varyixg efficiency according to their ability. He implied that he would like us to allow a longer period in which to complete the training so that when the personnel returned to Kabul they would be fit to carry on with their work. He then sprang a surprise upon me by saying that he did not anticipate that we should put his pilots straight on to his new and up-to-date aircraft, but that we could, out of our vast resources, start them off on our Wapitis and Harts graduating them up to the standard of their own aircraft. For———R .A*F • ——— ■■ this purpose he entertained hopes that the pilots and mecha nics could come to Drigji Road this winter a month or so before the date given him for shipment of his own aircraft. I pointed out that it is our firm policy to carry out training in the air Efficient GrouM Instructors and that in forming the course for four weeks for 5 pilots 7 /e had worked on wide experience of refreshing pilots on a new type. I pointed out that his anxiety led xxMwxtygKxxxjbc|iBxiLt:gst&gt;: to txtkxixxhiarxamxxRtyx one to imagine that his pilots must be very rusty or that he did not appreciate the individual awention we give to pupils during Air Training. He then pointed out that he did not want merit five pilots to pass through our hands and return to Kabul to get rusty while the other five are passing ihrough. He also felt that when his pilots knew the speed at which they would be put through they would be rather staggered in compa rison with their original training and their flying since. I learned that for about three months in the year in Kabul they did not fly at all and it was for this period January to March approximately that he was so anxious to get as many pupils as possible to Karachi on active flying and ground training. The British Military Attache* (aside) pointed out to me that it was necessary to make the Commandant feel assured that we understood his requirements and that we would give favourable consideration to those requirements, or he would not leave Karachi for a week or two. This delay of departure would cause no end of political difficulties and he urged me to give the Commandant as much satisfaction as I could. Accordingly I went so far as to tell him that I anticipated that with serious interruption to our own work (which would have to be examined), and with very much greater expense than was anticipated in the original scheme, arrangements could be made possible in the or on the gnound only b expert Flying Instructors andR.A.F. for the following, provided of course the Govern ment of India gave their approval:- (a) To train 10 pilots at a time and possibly to begin on Wapitis one month before the actual date that his own atrcraft were due at Karachi. (b) To train somewhere, at some time(not necessarily at Karachi nor at the same time as the pilots), six Officer Observers and two Officers with Wireless experience, the fomer to have a short coufk in Elementary Practical Reconnaissance, Bombing, Photograph.; etc., the latter a short practical course in Wireless methods asing their own set. (c) To arrange accomnodation at Drigh Road, most likely under canvas, in a Mess auxilliary to the Officers Mess, for the 20 Officer pilots and Mechanics. I ascertained that the Afghan air Force personnel were all of Officers status in order to attract enough people to take up the Force as a career. I said that the new aspect of the case shorn in (a), (b) and (c) abowe would now be included by the R.A.F. in t) eir Scheme for the Government of India’s Information. I pointed out to him \ emphatically that I was not an agent of the Government of India but an R.A.F. technical officer here to show him our facilities for —air—air and ground training, to present to him our scheme for training his 10 pilots and 10 mechanics ancj/to obtain his views on the subject. I also pointed out that a final decision must be made between the respective G-ovemments. He understood that I was about to return to R.A.F. H.Q. with a full understanding of his r equirements and how they differed from the scheme which we had based on our assumptions of his requirements, and he took his leave satisfied tint we would do the best we could for him. 4. CQNGIUSiQNa. I proceeded to the Depot prepared to discuss our aircraft, their maintenance and the training of a nucleous of pilots and mechanics in their flying and maintenance. I immediately found that the Comiandant had fully appreciated our aircraft and orgainsation. He did not wish to discuss the former either as re ( &gt;rds performance or price but he confined himself solely to ground organi sation and the training of pilots and ground personnel. All throu h his conversations he led me to understand that we could take it that h.s first eight aircraft would be British, and in fact, so would the remainder of his require raents in aircraft. On this basis he showed that he wanted our help to convert his present Air Force to our methods from its present state of being practically only a glori fied Flyxng u lub wiih a few old machines, some pilots, mechanics and scattered in different workshops. His ideal organisation was primarily a Squadron at Kabul with 3 flights and a miniature Depot or Squadron Workshop. Later he hoped to add more flights or make another Squadron to be located at other aerodromes as they were built. —tfkingTaking the points raised in Wing Commander Tho las’s Scheme for training I consider a new scheme should be dr~wn up on the following basist- (l) T* 16 object of the scheme is (a) To refresh 10 Officer Pilots in flying and to train them to fly modern aircraft for normal purposes • (b) To train 10 Officer Mechanics to maintain the moAern aircraft. (c) To give a short practical course to 6 Officer Observers and 2 Officer Mirelesa Operators. (ii ) ^SSU^'HOMS. (a) The pilots are called fully qualified a* no doubt they were when they left Ruesla, France or Italy. Since then they have only been flying 10 minutes to half an hour per week, and only under good flying conditions. They obviously have not been accustomed to the regular and intensive flying practice of our own pilots. (b) The pilots will only be able to interpret instruc tions given in Persian and(in most oases) French. (o) The Fitters have maintained the Liberty engines in yt their D.H.9AS since 1926 out of lashings of spares which they reveived with their aircraft through Rusaia. All the viewing, dial testing, fitt ing and so forthe seen in the B.R.3. at the Depot, the oom andant said they were quite capable of aorng and, in fact, had done. Therefore I feel they really are Fitters and can be put through to main tain Kestrels efficiently and to have quite • g°®&lt;i idea of the overhaul principles, by the scheme we have laid dowrie (d) The Riggers are comparable t® the Fitters. They will need some understading of, and practice in Metal Rigging and repair. I gather that they would quite easily absorb this- 10 - (e) The airmen will need one interpreter in Persian for Fitters and one for Riggers t both interpreters requiring aircraft technical knowledge. (f) The refresher part of the pilots course should be done first on Wapitis then on Harts. The second part of the course would be done on their own aircraft. This is not likely to be a D.H.89. (iii) SGQPB OP TRAININQ . (aj^ The Afghan presumably does not like parachutes as the Commandant refused to w ear one on any of his flights. (b) It would be as well to start the flying instruction while their own aircraft are on the sea in order to have them ready to go on to their aircraft as soon as erected. (c) 10 pilots are required to be trained at one time and I do not think it can be got through in 4 weeks per pilot. This is because I don’t think they are in sufficiently good flying practice, hey are not used to our intensive training methods, and they have difficulty with the language and a certain amount of reticence in the hands of strangers. (d) The scheme for the Fitter and Rigger stands, except that they are Officers and the 8 weeks will not coincide with the period of Pilots training. (e) The pilots will require two dual and two solo aircraft of their own type to finish off their training. I tried to impress this on the Commandant but it did not appear to sink in as he still hopes for us to do the main training on our own \ aircraft in order that his own may be kept in glass cases as long as possible. (iv) He would not agree at all to the personnel being accomodated in Karachi. They would accept our mess food of -Westera-Western type, they having already spent some time in Russia, Italy and Eraneh. It appears necessary to consider their sleeping under canvas and messing either in the Officers Mess or in a cangas auxilliary mess. Sd/- J.Ch Thomson, 1-10-36. Wing Oommander.gpamig 'a* .

CO^MNDFH TH0;J30N DURING . CONVSf^AXION. 1. The Afghan pilots and mechanics, who are officers, do not want to he mixed up with Indian personnel of equivalent status or treated as Indians in any way. In addition to their own language ox Persian, they appear to he able to speak both French and Russian. The Commandant was very fluent in French. 2. The Commandant was very susoieious of every Indian and would discuss nothing unless closeted out of Indian ear-shot. 3. He and his Government aopear to think that in dealing with the Government of India they are in reality dealing direct with the British Government. One of the objects of his visit to Lord on therefore is to get into touch with the head of affairs. 4. The Commandant is very astute, has flown from most aerodromes in Italy and appreciated at once the finer points with regard to the use of our jigs, tools, gauges, etc., connected with aero engine repairs. 5. The Afghan appears to have westernised himself by sending students to European countries, particularly Russia, France and Italy. As a result, there was a general tendency to lean on these countries for advancement. The Prime Minister/-Minister however, who appears to he a very strong and almost feared leader, is averse to the various factions, such as Bolshevism, etc., in these countries and is therefore very much inclined to lean on Britain as an educational ground for his students. By students is meant professional, commercial and even military and air force learners. It was this fear of the effect of factions in some European countries, and the effect of sanctions on Italy, that really made the Prime Minister send the Commandant so quickly to see what we had. 6. It seems that in Kabul there are 10 Germans to every one other foreigner. The effect of this appears in their present endeavour to foster organised games. At the house of the Afghan Consul in Karachi I was shown many photographs of Kabul and State ceremonies, and one in particular the Commandant, a very big man, repeatedly showed me with almost childish glee. This was a photograph of the procession at a sports meeting; recently held in Kabul. The leader wore a blue Blazer, white trousers and a beret, he was followed by the strapping Commandant in white sweater, white trousers and beret, carrying a large banner, immediately behind him were seven more, clothed as the leader. The Commandant pointed himself out to me as the champion at pushball. The leader was the Prime Minister and amongst the seven others were the Minister for War; Minister for the Interior; Foreign Minister, etc. It aopears that the heads of the Government have to give a practical lead in all their new ventures.7. The Commandant expects to take 8 air craft from his visit to the United Kingdom, i.e. 5 in the financial year 1936/37 and 3 in the following year, hoping that the whole 8 will become available from January 1937 to May 1937. The public of Afghanistan seem to have suddenly realised the necessity for an up-to-date air force organised on some sound European principles. The production of this air force is being made a special need and public subscriptions have been opened. The response so far is far in excess of the Afghan Government's expectations. 8. The present aerodrome at Kabul is being turned over to civil and a new one for military purposes is being made some three miles away from the old one and it will be in the vicinity of 12u0 yards by 1090 yards. 9. The D.H.39 does not seem to be favoured by the Commandant and he is aiming at a general purpose type capable of fighting. 10. He talks of forming an air group rather in the light of two squadrons of three flights, or six flights only, with a workshop repair and maintenance organisation at Kabul. Until the first squadron is complete, the main air force will be located,at Kabul. As one or two more aerodromes are made and his force is increased flights from the central force at Kabul will go out to these new stations. 11. Our system of maintenance of aircraft, air and ground organisation at aerodromes, and air and ground training of personnel, appears to meet with the entire approval of the Commandant/-Commandant. He wants his maintenance and reserves to be on our lines, although he has been rather mis-guided in the past, having' received his D.H.9As. in 1926C?) from Russia complete with lashings of spares, in fact, they have kept their engines serviceable since that year without any additional spares. 12. Two of the Afghan pilots were trained in Russia, married Russian Ladles, and have since deserted to Russia and ere now believed to be acting as agents against Afghanistan. This is why they are so particular to avoid a country where there are factions, on no account today will they send students to Lahore, for instance.5036 5000 7.36 Draft Paper. POLITICAL Department.

I have the honour to submit herewith for your information a report on the tour of Ghund Mishar Muhammad Ihsan Khan, 'Commandant oi the Atghan Air Force in India between 15th and 24th September 1936. Report on the tour of Ghund Mishar Muhammad Ihsan Khan, Commandant of the Afghan Air Force, to Royal Air Force Units at Peshawar and Risalpur, and the Royal Air Force Depot at Karachi, during the period 15th—24th September, 1936. 1. Ghund Mishar Muhammad Ihsan Khan arrived at Peshawar from Kabul on 15th September and was accommodated in Dean’s HoteL A car was placed at his disposal by the Government of the North-West Frontier Province. Shortly after his arrival Group Captain N. H. Bottomley A. h. C. and M mg Commander J. C. Slessor, M.C., called on him, and details for his visit to Royal Air Force units at Peshawar and Risalpur were communicated to him. The Commandant speaks Persian and Italian and knows a little French. Appendix ‘ A ’ of this report gives the details of the tour in India of the Commandant, Afghan Air Force. 2 The Commandant was very pleased with his reception, and the arrange ments made for him at Peshawar and Risalpur by the Royal Air Force. He proved to be particularly easy to deal with, was always punctual, and for an Afghan exceptionally considerate regarding arrangements for demonstrations, etc., all of-which he seemed to realise would interfere with normal work. He appreciated the social events arranged in his honour, and was very impressed with the fraiik and friendly way with which his numerous questions were answered by officers of the Royal Air Force. Relations were cordial throughout and the Commandant stated that if the same friendly spirit was established when Afghan pilots and mechanics came to India for training he had no doubt that their stay in India would be a happy one. 3 Before leaving Peshawar the Commandant particularly asked to be accommodated in a hotel at Karachi, and arrangements were made for him to stav at the Killamey Hotel. A hired car was placed at his disposal while m Karachi. 'T) He dined in the Royal Air Force Mess at #righ Road, and after his health had been proposed and drunk made a brief speech in reply thanking the Royal Air Force in India for their hospitality, and the sympathetic way in which they had shown him something of their organisation. He expressed the hope that the cordial relations established during his visit would lead to further friendly contacts in the future, and a strengthening of the present good relations between India and Afghanistan. He was grateful to Wing Commanders T. C. Thompson and R. E. G. Fulljames, M.C., for the very thorough tour of the Workshops, Stores, etc., they had given him and the manner in which they had met his requirements regarding statistics and lists of equipment, etc. The size of the Royal Air Force Depot at Drigh Road undoubtedly impressed him ,and perhaps led to the increased demands he made for the training of Afghan Air Force personnel in India. LS559FD3 he gave for his request for facilities for training 30 new mechanics in India. (g) He stated that his pilots did not at present receive sufficient train ing in flying, and were in many cases out of practice as since they ► returned from Italy, France or Russia, the condition of the few Afghan aircraft did not allow of frequent flights. For this reason he would like his pilots to receive as much training as possible in India. In winter in Kabul weather conditions precluded regula-r training in flying and the pilots would be better employed in India than sitting about in Kabul. 5. Regarding the training of Afghan pilots, observers, mechanics and wire less personnel in India the Commandant brought up the following points :— (a) The desirability of commencing the training at the earliest possible moment. (b) That the Afghan Government would prefer the training to take place at Drigh Road, and not at Lahore where the Afghan per sonnel might get into touch with subversive elements possibly hostile to the present Afghan Government. He would like the pilots, etc., to be accommodated at Drigh Road, and not in Karachi City or Cantonment where control of their movements would not be easy. (c) That if there was not sufficient room to accommodate their officers in the Mess, a camp be formed, and messing arranged separately for the bulk of the officers, but one or two of the more senior of their officers to feed in the Royal Air Force Mess. (d) That he would like the pilots and mechanics to have as much train ing as possible before the arrival of their own aircraft from England. (e) That he preferred that the training of his 10 pilots be carried out in one batch, and not in two or more batches. (/) That some training be given in flying Wapiti or other aircraft before his own aircraft arrived. (g) That he did not mind how long the course in flying lasted (up to a maximum of 3 or 4 months) provided the training was thorough. (h) That the pilots and mechanics knew only French or Persian and interpreters would be necessary. The Afghan Government could probably supply some English interpreters, but the Royal Air Force would possibly be able to provide others if necessary. (i) He mentioned that Afghan pilots, etc., trained in France, Italy and Russia h*d been given their training free of all charges and rations, equipment, overalls, etc., had also been supplied free. He obviously hoped that training in India would be free, but was informed that this was a matter for the two Governments con- cernel »&lt;• decide. He further slated that some of his personnel weire in favour of going to * ' the above countries for training as they had been treated very generously when there, but the Afghan Government had decided on India. (j) He appeared to be satisfied with the outline of the syllabus of train ing for pilots and mechanics prepared by the Royal Air Force, and explained to him, but w T ould like his various suggestions ^ included. (k) He asked for arrangements to be made for the training of 6 observers and 2 men in wireless telegraphy for Army co-operation work. (l) He asked if it was possible to send 30 mechanic or fitter recruits to India for training. 6. In connection with the queries in paragraph 5 above the Commandant was informed that subject to the approval of the Government of India' :— (a) It would be possible to train 10 pilots at one time, the training to commence approximately one month before the Afghan aircraft arrived in Karachi or from the date the aircraft were notified as shipped to Karachi. (b) It would be possible to train at some station in India at a con venient time 6 observers and 2 men in wireless telegraphy forArmy co-operation work. The instruction to include elementary practical co-operation work, bombing, photography, etc. (c) That accommodation for 20 Afghan pilot and mechanic' officers would be arranged at Drigh iioad, Karachi. \d) That Headquarters, Koyal Air Force, would try to iiicorpdrate the special requirements of the Commandant in their training scheme, and submit this to the Government of India for final approval. (e) That the question of the training of 30 recruit mechanics and fitters was a big question, and would require further consideration if the Afghan Government wished to pursue the matter. (/) That the financial aspect of the training of the Afghan Air Force personnel in India was a matter for the two Governments to decide, and quite outside the scope of the present discussions. 7. The Commandant, Afghan Air Force, was supplied with detailed lists of flight and squadron equipment, maintenance equipment for 6 aircraft, equipment supplied with aircraft, fighting equipment, etc., supplied separately from the aircraft, and air frame and engine spares for workshops. He was also given a suggested syllabus of training for pilots, mechanics and fitters, plans for a small and a large hangar, and the oiganisation ot a squadron. All these he forwarded to the Afghan Government with his report. 8 Regarding the type of aircraft he wishes to purchase the Commandant seemed to be in favour of the “ Hind ” type, but said he intended to have a careful inspection of the various types in England before coming to a decision. He wished to buy the best available, and he said he had no desire to puichase Second hand aircraft. The Audax and Hart he considered wmild not be suit able for Kabul as owing to the height the take off would be difficult with a lull load. The “ Hind ” type with its superior engine would he thought have the required performance. 9 Generally the Commandant appeared to be very satisfied with his tour in India and left Karachi for Europe with many expressions of gratitude for Hie facilities given to him in India for the inspection of aircraft, stores, and workshops, etc., also for the hospitality accorded to him by the Government of India. From remarks made casually during conversations with the Commandant there appears to be little doubt that other countries like Italy and Russia have offered similar facilities for the inspection of their aircraft and the training of Afghan Air Force personnel, and the Commandant seemed to think that the training of the pilots, etc,, in these countries would be free of all charges. It would also appear that Afghan pilots trained in Italy and Russia are biased in favour of purchases of aircraft and facilities for training from the particular countries in which they received their former training. # The Afghan Government have apparently ruled that the training of their Air Force per sonal be carried out in India, and the visit of the Commandant to India has I consider done much to dispel any suspicions he may have had about obtaining •1 souare deal in regard to the training of his Air Force personnel. He was also 4ibly impressed with the efficiency of Royal Air Force units, and work- shops, etc., in India. The Commandant stated that after landing at Marseilles he would proceed to Paris and stay with the family of S. Shah Wall Khan, Acting Minister of Defence for a few days. He would meet Faiz Muhammad Khan, Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs, while in Paris, but as he had no business to transact he then hoped to proceed to London and arrange for the inspection and selection of aircraft. He anticipated that he would be in England for one or two months, after that his movements were uncertain, but he might visit one or two other countries before he returned to Kabul. (Sd.) A. S.

Minute Paper. Department. 1 r. Walton, The Air Ministry letter of the 12th October has crossed ours of the 13th October, and appears to have been drafted without the Government of India’s telegram of 9th October being taken into consideration. The Air Ministry letter of the 12th October makes an expansion of our draft telegram to Kabul necessary. For this reason, and in order to make it clear to the Air Ministry that we expect them to think again in the light of our letter of 13th October, it is suggested that we should write to them again on the lines suggested below. I have suggested in the drafts that we should instruct Colonel Fraser Tytler to offer the Afghans 6 aircraft in 1936-37, but that we should also authorise vn mb'7 him to offer a further 2 machines^if he finds this essential in order to clinch an agreement. I have little doubt that he will in fact find it essential to do this. I might tell the Air Ministry by telephone to expect a further letter from us. Northern Department, Foreign Office .p.

Sir, I am commanded fry [ the 1 t tounoli 1 to refer 4 letter No. S.35888/S.6. dated the 6th June, 1936, relative to the supply of aircraft to the Afghan Government, and in particular to the statement therein that six Audax or Hind aircraft could he made available for sale to that Government. 2. It is understood that since that date the requirement of the Afghan Government in Hinds has risen to 8. This additional requirement places the Air Council in some difficulty as during the last three months the situation in regard to the supply of aircraft has changed materially for the worse, and it will now be more difficult, although not impossible, to guarantee the supply even of the six Audax or Hind aircraft originally promised for delivery during this financial year. 3. The Air Council nevertheless recognise it to be desiraule that Afghan requirements should be met (if at all possible) from this country rather than from other foreign countries, and that some delay and dislocation even in the urgent requirements for our own air expansion programme would have to be tolerated rather than that the Afghan Government should seek other sources of supply* 4. As regards the present financial year the delivery of 6 Audax or Hind aircra^ t is the utmost that can be undertaken, but it may be possible to arrange for a further supply of aircraft to the Afghan Government during 1937.

On this point the draft follows the lines of the offer agreed between H.M.G. and the Government of India (Government of India telegram No.1666 of 24th July), which was communicated to the Afghan Government. As regards the availability of aircraft in addition to the five machines already definitely offered to the Afghans, the Air Ministry told us in their letter of 6th June (P.Z.3955/36) that they could make available six for delivery at once (which of course includes our five) and advised us to make an offer of 4 in 1936-37, 6 in 1937-38 and possibly 6 more in 1938-39.

Since Afghan Government have stated intention to purchase up to eight aircraft offer to train only two or three pilots may not be acceptable to them and you will no doubt consider possibility of training pilots in successive batches or use of aeronautical training centre of India vide Department of Industries Labour's letter number V32 dated 10 August. I fear that if Afghan pilots are not trained under our auspices not only may part of our object in assisting the development of Afghan air force i.e. establishment of link with its officers be lost, but that the Afghan Government may turn completely to some other country to foster the development of its air force including supply of aircraft and equipment. Even if Italian or other foreign Government restricted its help to the training of pilots they may be trusted to exploit the nuisance value of such influence as they may thus obtain. H.M.G. would view with some concern deflection of Afghan interest in aviation into foreign and particularly Italian hands and trust that it will be found possible to overcome the training difficulties you now foresee. /Your- 2 - Your inability to discuss with Muhammad Ihsan questions of number of pilots to be trained and of who will pay may have caused him to leave India discouraged and to enter prematurely into commitments with other Powers. It therefore seems desirable that our decision on these questions should be communicated to the Afghan Government and to Muhammad Ihsan before the latter leaves Great Britain and that Afghan Government should be informed immediately that we hope to do this. If you agree please request His Majesty^ Minister at Kabul to act accordingly. 1 ) ■■To Under Secretary / Secretary of State... Committee Under Secretary Secretary of State.... Date. n Initials.

Previous papers :— The offer of aircraft proposed by the Government of India in their telegram of the 24th July and approved by His Uajesty’s Government on P.Z.5370/36 has been communicated to the Afghan Government and its reception has, on the whole, been favourable. The Afghan Government are anxious to do business and they made no difficulty in accepting the proposed terms of payment of six annual instalments, the first to be paid on delivery. Arrangements have now been made for a visit by the Commandant of the Afghan Air Force to Peshawar. He is due to arrive there on September l^th and will * \ 4136b 1000 10.35inspect the different types of aeroplane and discuss the question of the training of Afghan pilots and mechanics. He will then proceed to England where he will have the opportunity of seeing types of aeroplane not available in India. As the Government of India’s offer of five 'planes with a possibility of a further supply in subsequent years does not satisfy the immediate recuirements of the Afghan Government, the Afghan ^ /C Air Commandant will explore the possibility of obtaining aeroplanes from other sources, and in particular Italy. There appears to be no action required here, at any rate until the results of the Peshawar visit are known. v- yS O&amp;x CLso- Wcoe. co r 0 or -oo ^ b^-e^avC^. xG^e cosv~ ad.tJeco^U A -^v\.6r$» cavja.e.r ^cCcvcm^ v's to t-Gvcx- VCcOrif^o^ &lt;2e u5vV\.

Mr.Collier pointed out that if the Afghan pilots are not trained under our auspices, part of our objective in assisting the development oi the Afghan Air Force, i.e. establishment of a link with the officers of that Force, might be lost. He also emphasised that we may expect the Italian Government to exploit the nuisance value of any influence in Afghanistan which they might obtain as a result of Afghan pilots being trained in Italy where the Commandant of the Afghan Air Force received his own training. The result of the Government of India's inability to discuss with Muhammad Ihsan the question of who is to pay for the training and the number of pilots to be trained, may lead him to leave India* in a discouraged frame of mind and to enter wit-hout proper consideration into commitments with Italy or Germany. 1 think that there is a good deal in this, and I agreed to prepare a draft telegram to the Government of India on the lines of that attached. A draft telegram to Kabul enquiring regarding Muhammad Ihsan's itinerary in Europe is also submitted. It will be necessary to get Foreign Office and Air Ministry concurrence in them. I understand from Squadron Leader Darvall that the difficulties regarding the training of pilots indicated by the Government of India are real. The only R.A.F.school ! is at Karachi: it is solely engaged in training the Indian Air Force and/Two or three Afghan pilots would probably be the limit of its capacity. On the other hand, the Air is quite small. Ministry/i Ministry consider rather hazardous the Government of India’s intention that, after the completion of their training, which would probably last a year, the handful of pilots they contemplate training should then instruct the other Afghan pilots. In this connection the Air Ministry have drawn attention to the existence of a Civil Training School at New Delhi, which is described in a report of 10th August from the Department of Industries and Labour (copy attached), and which they think might be suitable for the Afghan pilots.

Roy, Beq., C.I.B., I.G.S., Joint Secretary to the Government of India, His Majesty 1 s Under Secretary of State for India, Economic and Overseas Department, India Office, Whitehall, London. Sir, In continuation of this Department’s letter No. V32, dated the 25th June 1936, I am directed to submit the following information in regard to civil aviation in India 2. A formal agreement has been drawn up for the lease of two plots of land to a private company called the Aeronautical -^raining centre of India, Ltd., at the civil aerodrome at New Delhi, for a period oi thirty years in the first instance, for the purpose of accommodating an institution for training candidates in aeronautics, aviation and engineering. One of the conditions on which this lease is to be concluded, is that the Company should reserve, annually not less than half the vacancies in their training centre for candidates to be nominated by the Director of Civil Aviation in India. The Company has been in occupation of the land at the aerodrome since September of last year, and the first batch of students started their training in November last. It does not receive any subsidy from Government. 3. As regards civil aviation works programme, the statement showing the progress made during the quarter ending the 30th June 1936, is under preparation, and will be forwarded when completed.

OiJtS-P Will you please refer to the Government of India’s telegram No.2035 of 9th September,regarding the sale of munitions to the Afghan Government ? We have not been able to follow some of the calculations in that telegram of the effect on the Afghan Reserve Fund of the various transactions now under negotiation. We have made a calculation ourselves and I enclose for what it is worth a rough note showing our results. Admittedly it is based on the assumptions that the Afghan Government will accept the offers which have been made to them and that no default will occur; the credit side of the Balance sheet must accordingly be treated with reserve, 7/e must also, of course, bear in mind the Government of India’s pledge to draw gradually on the Fund during the first few years. But even taking these considerations/ 0. iC. Caroe msQ.• j CIS., _lCS., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign &amp; Political Department, Simla.considerations into account, the calculation suggests that there may be more money available for use in 1937-8 than the Government of India’s telegram seems to imply, and this point may be of importance in connection with the training of pilots or if the Afghan Government want to buy aircraft in 1937-8 in addition to the five machines which we have offered them m 1936-37. It seems possible from Katodon 76 of 8nd September that they will want up to three more. I am sending a coj^y of this letter and its enclosure to Kabul. Yours sincerely. (Sd.) H. A. F.

I —rP.Z.5598/36 Extract from Peshawar Intelligence Summary No. 26 dated 29th June, 1936. 4 . The Afghan Government proposes to purchase 24 aeroplanes from Europe. It is reported that the pilots and mechanics employed will be Russians. At present there are only two efficient Afghan pilots in the Air Force.i A/y 7 y~ u. * • 7 ^ ^ © I sent a draft telegram to the Government of India to Squadron Leader Darvall* under cover of a letter putting to him the points regarding price etc., which we found obscure in the official Air Ministry letters. After he had been able to consult the Contracts Department of the Air Ministry I discussed this draft telegram with him, and he concurs in it subject to amendments which have been incorporated in the copy attached. The position/regardsHarts is that the Air Ministry have placed contracts which will provide them with sufficient Harts to maintain all the R.A.F. Hart Squadrons in the United Kingdom, India or elsewhere for such period as Harts may be expected to remain in service. It would not be possible to obtain any Hafts over and above those provided for in these contracts. As regards the price at which the Government of India 1 s Harts might be sold to the Afghans, the Air Ministry are not able to say what this would be. It would, hov/ever, probably be greater than the price at which Harts are sold to the Government of India, as the Air Ministry are bound in their contracts with the makers of Harts not to sell this type to Foreign Governments at less than the price at which the manufacturers would sell them direct to the Foreign Government. The Air Ministry strongly dislike the suggestion that the Government of India should sacrifice their Harts, which are 5&gt; not 6 as stated by the Government of India, and replacing them by another type, as this seems to involve the conversion of one of the Government of India’s Hart Squadrons into a mixed Squadron containing some Harts and some of another type. as in/ ^In the correspondence Dragon type aircraft are referred to in different ways. The original Dragon was called the D.H.86 (the military version uf 'utiTLlf being D.H.86 M.) The estimated price of a Dragon contained in Squadron-Leader Darvall f s letter of 28th November was for a D.H.86 (standard type). In the last year or so the Dragon Rapide has been produced, the standard type being called the D.H .89 and the military version the D.H. 89 M. I understand that the Dragon Rapides are unlikely to go out of production, and if we did not sell them to the Afghans this year we could almost certainly get them next year. The cost of armament amounts to about £600 in the case of the D.H. 89 M, and from £700-£800 in the case of Audax or Hinds.DRAFT TELEGRAM. P.Z. 3955/3 6 . n ; .

We should be grateful if you would look in particular at para. 2 of the draft. Your official letter quotes prices for aircraft excluding armament, but we shall presumably have to sell the machines to the Afghans with armament and we would like to be able tc gauge the probable total sum which would have to be paid out of the Govt, of India's Afghan Eeserve Fund in order to deliver each type complete to the Afghan Govt., in order that we may know how many of each type we can afford to offer. Would it be possible to quote prices inclusive of armament ? We notice that the estimate given in the official Air Ministry letter for the military version of the Dragon Rapide 1% D.H. 89.M excluding armament differs from that given in your letter of 28th November 1935, to Walton as the advertised price of De Havilland Dragon type aircraft complete with engines and equipmentWe are also not clear about the difference between the 'Standard D.H.89', of the Dragon Rapide D.H.89.M'. We should be grateful if you could give us an estimate of the cost to the I Afghans of the Harts which the Govt, of India have on order. Could you also say when they will be ready to be shipped? Perhaps when you have been able to collect the answers to these questions we might discuss them.

The cost of the aircraft would be an immediate debit to the Afghan reserve fund, as the manufacturers would have to be paid on delivery, and instalments paid by the Afghan Government would be credited to the fund. It is suggested that we should now ask the Air Ministry officially whether they could arrange for 4 Dragons to be made available in 1936-37; 4 Harts or Foxes in 1937-38 and a further 4 Harts or Foxes in 1938-39, and what the prices of these aircraft would be delivered at Kabul. We might also enquire what alternative types would be supplied if Harts and Foxes cannot be made available. 4424 5000 1/36 A/2 ■ V I ! A draft letter to the Government of India is also put up seeking their views (which they have hitherto withhe from us) on the Afghan request for pilots to he trained in India and on Sir R.Maconachie’s suggestion that after His Majesty’s Government had taken a decision to supply oi|w4v aircraft, hut before details are settled, an R.A.P. 1 should go to Kabul to advise the Afghan Government.

ORT.\HT , 27 APR W56 I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the correspondence resting with Kabul telegram No. 128 of 28th October, 1035, a copy o^ which was forwarded to the Air FJinistry under India Office printed letter No.P.Z.7795/35 of 30th October, regarding the renuest of the Afghan Governnent for the sale to them of aircraft on credit terms. The Government of India have accepted as accurate the estimate of His Majesty's Minister, Kabul, as to the number of military aircraft necessary to the &gt; fghan Gover ment and agree that 12 is the minimum number which could be regarded as effective. They also consider that there ore strong practical arguments for the supply of military aircraft from British rather than other sources, since in the event of war with Afghanistan, hov/ever improbable that contingency at present may be, they would be able to control the supply of machines and spare parts and so render the enemy's air arm at least temporarily innocuous. At the same time in another situation the possession of British machines by the Afghan /ir Force would be in theopinion of the Government of Inaia a material factor in aiding the collaboration of the Afghan Air Force with our own. Conaiheration of this ^ueation has been postponed pending discussion with the Treasury of the incidence of extraordinary expenditure.in connection with Afghanistan. A settlement has now been reached on this subject and the Government of India propose to establish a fund to cover expenditure of this nature. They will make an annual payment of Rs.5 lakhs into this Hind and allow the fund to accumulate up to a maximum of Rs.26 lakhs* It is calculated that in addition to the other liabilities, contingent or actual, which it may be necessary to place upon the fund, it should be possible to meet from it the coat of supplying to the AfghanGovernment four aircraft in each of the years 1936-37, 1937-38 and 1938-39. Payments by the Afghan Government in respect of the aircraft, which could be spread over a period of 6 years, would be credited to the fund. 3. I am to enquire the views of the Air Council regarding the sale of aircraft to the Afghan Government and in particular to ask whether they could arrange for 4 De Havilland Dragons to be mace available for sale to the Afghan Go vernment/Department V-~ r ' Government during the year 1936-37 and whether 4 Hawker Harte or Pairey Foxes could similarly be m«de available in the years 1937-38 and 1938-39 and what sums it would be necessary to pay for the manufacture of these aircraft and their delivery to the Afghan Government. If it seems likely that any of these types could not be made available, I am to enquire whether other suitable types could be made available instead and at what price. 4. A copy of a letter which has been sent to the Government of India consulting them regarding the training of Afghan pilots in India and the possibility of sending an officer of the R.A.F. to Kabul to discuss the question with the Afghan Government is enclosed. It is contemplated on receipt of their reply and that of the Air Council to this letter to instruct His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, to discuss the question with the Afghan Government. 5. A copy of this letter is being sent to the Foreign Office, who have concurred in its terms, and to the Director of Military Intelligence.

Their army, however, must be built up quickly and could not wait indefinitely for the necessary equipment. 4. l replied that l would look into these matters as soon as possible and with every desire to help the Afghan Government. These requests, however, came at a time when we were engaged in building up our own defences and when we were inundated with similar requests for help from other countries - particularly in the matter of aeroplanes.(COPIES CIBCULATED) From Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India 0 Dated New Delhi, 2Bnd December, 1935 0 Received l o 30 Pom,, 22nd December, 1935 XXX 1^' 3406 o Foreign and Political Departmento Your telegram of the 10th instant, 3915 Military aircraft for .Afghan Government 0 2 0 Question (4) is dealt with in Caroe T s particularly, paragraph No 0 3 (d) of covering letter, and paragraph No„3 (f), 5 and 8 (?

I am afraid that you must have thought ua very dilatory and unsatisfactory over the question of the supply of rifles etcetera to Afghanistan. We in this Department have been trying with some support from the General Staff to send you our views on the policy side of the question which, as you have rightly said, should be decided before the question of incidence of cost is tackled. My idea was that the more attractive we could make the 'promised land' which would come into being with the equalization fund, the more chance there was of His Majesty’s Government accepting our conditions. Grigg however thought otherwise and would not agree to an&gt; views on policy being sent home at all until the principle we are fighting for was accepted by His Majesty’s Government, his argument being that we should only weaken our position by admitting the desirability of giving the Afghans anything. It is difficult to say which view is correct and I cannot claim greater knowledge than Grigg of the psychology of the Treasury. However we have, I think, now placed before you a full conspectus of the whole case in our demi-official letter No.D.6095/F/35, dated the 29 th/29th November 1935, despatched last week with a long Memorandum prepared by the Finance Department dealing with all the items now under discussion. This together with our telegram No. 3239, dated the 2nd December 1935, giving the answers to the questions in paragraph 4 of your Express Letter, should we hope enable you to make the whole case clear to the Treasury. It was interesting to find that the preparation of the Memorandum by the Finance Department showed Grigg that the contingent charges likely to fall on the fund were very much smaller than he had anticipated and that unless the Afghans default altogether the fund will easily be able to bear not only rifles and ammunition and of course half of the civil air service, but also a number of Military aeroplanes provided they are not all given at once. Another satisfactory feature is that, provided the Afghans pay *t all regularly, there is very little if any chance of His Majesty’s Government being called on to contribute at all except in the event of some large and wholly unexpected emergency arising.Extract from P. and P. letter to Mr. Metcalfe dated 22nd November, 1935. xxx So far, unless everything turns out as badly as possible - i.e., unless the Afghans default immediately on all their obligations - the five lakhs a year fund would seem to be ample to cover the cost of the civil air service (itself a contingent charge which, if it materialises at all, may not arise for some time in future). But then there is also the question of supplying military aeroplanes to the Afghan 'tovemment on credit, and from the rough estimates hitherto made (e.g., by Lockhart in the enclosure to Kabul express letter of 24th August), the cost of each aeroplane seems to be nearly a lakh. This introduces a big complication. It is really difficult to discuss the question of incidence until that of policy has been decided, and on this we are still awaiting the Government of India's views resulting from your discussion with Fraser-Tytler at Delhi. It seems to me that on many of these questions we have really been putting the cart before the horse, the prior question being usually that of the policy of a particular project of exoenditure. Thus, in the case of the aeroplanes, if it/it were decided that the advantage of supplying machines of British manufacture is outweighed by the possible friction resulting from making Afghanistan our debtor for the large amount involved, it v/ould of course be unnecessary to pursue the financial aspect any further.f mmrz ?,7. ^ s^ys.

It seemed to the Government of India to be undesirable to discuss tne individual Afghan demands piecemeal. An attempt has therefore been made to review the effects on the proposed Equalisation Fund of the supply of (a) the 10,000 rifles with 6 million rounds ammunition at the rate of 600 rounds per rifle; (b) the further instalment of 15,000 rifles with 9 million rounds ammunition at the rate above; (c) military aircraft, and the establish ment of (d) a civil air service between Delhi and Kabul, 2, The result is the enclosed memorandum drafted in the Finance Department with the conclusions of which we in this Department are in general agreement We six all be addressing to you separately a detailed letter setting forth the proposals for the civil air servi ce • • •,- 2 - service, and I need not enlarge further on this subject except to say that the estiioate works out at a little over 3 lakhs per annum, of which the suggestion is that a little more than should be borne by the Government of India from their civil air budget, and about ^ should fail on the Jfund, provided of course that as a result of this corre spondence, His Majesty’s Government take a decision which enables us to establish that Amd. 3. As to the other items it is only necessary to say here - (a) that our military advisers think that a further supply of 15&gt;000 rifles is reasonable for the efficient rearmament of the Afghan army; (b) that it is assumed that the 2nd and 3rd instalments of 10,000 and i5,000 rifles respectively will be supplied by His Majesty’s Government from their stock of 1914 rifles; (c) that we fully realise that once the supply of 10,000 rifles is made, it may be necessary at a later stage to taxe a decision to continue the annual instalments of ammunition connected with this i t em...item, even should the Afghan Government default in repayment, and in this event the memorandum shows that the cnarge could he met from the provision of 1 lakh per annum proposed to meet unforeseen charges or from its unspent balances; (d) that we accept as accurate the Ministers estimate in the enclosure to Kabul despatch 93 of the 24th August as to the necessary number of military aircraft, and agree that 12 i s the minimum number wni ch could be regarded as effective. We also consider that there are strong practical arguments for supply of military aircraft from British rather than other sources, since in the event of war with Afghanistan, however improbable that contingency at present may be, we should be able to control supply of machines and spare parts and so render the enemy* s air arm at least temporarily innocuous* At the same time in another situation the possession of British macnines by the Afghan Air force would be a material factor in aiding the collaboration of the Afghan air force with our own* 4. We feel that analysis of the financial position disclosed in the finance Department's memorandum.- 4 - mftnioranduin enclosed with this letter should assist His iiajesty’s Ctovernment to accept the general proposals for the establishment of Ah Equalisation Eund as set forth in our telegram Ho«2475 f dated the 14th September 19 25, as further explained in our telegram No. 2049, dated the 8th November 1935, 5. ^raser-Tytler, who has recently been in Delhi, has impressed on us the difficulty with which he is faced in being unable to discuss any of these proposals with the Afghan Gavernment on their merits, or to indicate to them the probable attitude of His Majesty* s Government and the Government of India to any of their requests. We hope therefore that on receipt of this letter and our official letter on the Civil Air Service scheme, you will be in a position to communicate to us without further delay the acceptance by His Majesty’s Government of our proposals for the establishment of tnis i\ind, and for the assumption by His Majesty’s Government of responsibility for meeting demands beyond the resources of the Fund. Yours sincerely, 3d, 0. K. Caroe. To J.C. Walton,Esquire, C.B. ,M. C*, India Office, London. —The position is that probably not one of the current proposals to give aid to Afghanistan is in the view of the Government of India so imperative as to override all financial considerations, nor except at a time of war or if war were imminent do the Government of India contemplate any future necessity to aid Afghanistan irrespective of the cost* 2* But the Government of India do recognise that there must be a balance between political expediency and financial necessity. For the reasons 3 set out particularly in paragraph IS* of their telegram No. 2475, dated the 14th September the Government of India consider that a sum of ks.5 lakhs annually is the maximum wnich in the light of past, present and prospective financial conditions and of internal politics in India they can be expected or can afford to devote to Afghanistan affairs. According to the existing relationships with the Afghan Government the Government of India are thus offering to devote fe* 5 lakhs of Indian revenues to expenditure purposes which are substantially within the control of His Majesty’s Government and up to this limit they do not ask His majesty* s Government to undertake any corresponding financial liability at all. But as a condition of their rendering this first reserve for the purpose they ask to be ordinarily exonerated from further demands. They ask that in consideration of their more or less automatically bearing the first portion of Afghan expenditure, His Majesty’s Government should undertake to shoulder expenditure beyond that limit. The Government of India would go so far asnot to regard even tnis condition as an irrevocable one in all circux£istances. They would agree that, if on any special occasion the extra burden thrown on His iSajesty^ Government exceeded all reason, then a case might arise for the Government of India* s undertaking a particular liability even beyond the balance of the ?und, 3. The Government of India therefore measure the merits of each and all of the current Afghan expenditure proposals in the light of this financial setting and they must take into account their cumulative effect. The varous items under consideration at th v moment are t- (a) 5,000 rifles and 3 million rounds amiaunition already supplied - about as. 8 lakhs. These have been supplied from Indian Army stocks which will be replaced only gradually. The Government of India are prepared to assume that this transaction will not impose any liability on the fund. (b) 10,000 rifles 1914 pattern - about &amp;, 4£ lakhs. - to be supplied by Hi s Majecty*8 Government, dany defaults to fall on the Government of In oia. (This presupposes a decision in a particular way of the recent provisional decision taken by His liajesty’s Government in telegram Ho. 3720 of 19th November 1935, wni oh should not be taxen as prejudging this issue.) ^c) 6 million rounds of ammunition in connection with (b) but to be supplied by India. it is assumed..,- 3 assumed that tills would be supplied at 1 million rounds (say, ks. 1 lakh a year) a year and that in default of payment further supply would cease. But it cannot be ignored that circumstances might necessitate a continued free supply at the cost of the fund. (d) further 15,000 rifles 1914 pattern - about J&amp;.6-g lakhs. As under (b), the expenditure is to be defrayed by His Majesty’s Government, any default to fall on the Government of India, (e) 9 million rounds of ammunition in connection lith (d) but supplied by India at If million rounds (say iu&gt;. l,j lakhs) a year# The remarks against (c) apply to this item, (f) Aircraft - A sum of £s» 12 lakhs is assumed for the present purpose, (g) The Belhi-Lahore-Pesiiawar-Kabul air service. Por the purpose of the following paragraphs it is assumed that the Lahore-Kabul section would be regularly chargeable to the fund - about Es. l£ lakhs per annum, 4. In the light of the above it is possible to estimate the likely calls on the fund. The total sum repayable by Afghanistan under items (a) to (f) above would be, say, Es. 45 lakhs. Over a period of six years this amount would not be an impossible burden for 12 Harts Es. iOf lakhs Es, 15^ * Ks. 16i * or, 12 more expensive or, 16 -do AfghanistanAf^ianistan to bear, 0n the other hand, in the present unsatisfactory economic conditions of the country defaults in payment must be regarded as i not unlikely.

It is understood that four Dragons would be available for supply at once, but that, in view of the Air Ministry programme, it is unlikely that Harts or Foxes would be available in numbers till 1937.

November, 1935 We spoke yesterday about the supply of aircraft to the Afghan Government, and I promised to let you know the approximate cost of ti) a nart type of aircraft; and (ii) a ue Havilland Dragon type of aircraft. Regarding De navi Hand Dragon type aircraft the advertised price/is as follows:- and that is the ability of Germany, japan and xtussia to supply the Afghan uovernment if we do not do so, 1 am informed that there would be no difficulty in any of these countries supplying aircraft at the present moment, and that probably nussia and japan would even ‘cut 1 the price in order to get in on this market. So I am afraid we should be on weak ground if we suggested that the Afghans would have difficulty in obtaining aircraft from other sources than ourselves. 1 have ascertained that the declared value of some aircraft which were recently sold to the Persian Government were as follows:- nawker type aircraft complete with engines.•.. and Equipment 4- bomb racks etc. £5,000 each ox uxoeu £&gt;x j.o cfcfc&gt; iO±XUWS»“ D.H.

We were strorgly disposed at first to decline to consider any further concession to Afghanistan until the general principle was decided, and this ?iew was reinforced by recent erents on Mohmand frontier which suggest that both talue of Afghan Government’s friendship and its instability have perhaps been over-estimated.

Risks of involved are as follows:- In complying with request, His Majesty's Government and the Government of India might lose their money. Risk is apparent and requires no emphasis. Against it must be placed the fact that the Afghan Government is showing increased stability and has every intention of paying. I believe that if the present Government remains in power and does not go bankrupt obligations will be met in full. il ° ln refusin 6 the request, there is the risk that the Afghan Government may fail through lack of munitions.

Proposals in your telegram No.2475 ol 14tii September are und^r examination out it is inevitable that choir discussion must take a considerable time. Meanwhile it appears essential to give very early reply to Afghan requests lor munitions. It is especially necessary at a time when reactions of Mohmand campaign may place a strain on Afghan co-operation with us on irentier matters that v/e di ould not now alter long discussions appeal reluctant to provide Afghan Government v/ith munitions. There is also the danger that they may turn elsewhere. They have expressed v/ish to accept our oiler of 10,000 rifles and only question of method oi payment remains lor settlement. They have already waited without a reply regarding aeroplanes for over seven months. It is desirable also to give a reply soon to their request for 6,000,000 rounds of ammunition. •3. I observe however that proposals in paragraph 6 oi your telegram No.2475 are conditional on His Majesty’s Government undertaking liability defined in paragraph 5. I dm afraid mac chis would make it impossible to give any replies to the Afghan requests lor some time. I hopehowever that in circumstances set out in paragraph 2 you will a^ree to give in respect oi 10,000 rifles indemnity suggested in paragraph 4 of my telegram 2364 without prior settlement or large issues raised in your telegram 2475. 1 suggest that question of ultimate liability for Afghan default in respect of any aeroplanes and additional ammunition provided by Government of India should similarly be reserved lor decision as part o± settlement of general question oi division of responsibility as between His Majesty 1 s Government and Goverrmient of India for extraordinary expenditure in Aighanistan. 4. Could you supply the additional ammunition requested in ICatodon 96 if His majesty T s Government gave guarantee Similar to th*.t given in paragraph 5 oi my telegram 2190 of 13th July? What price would you ash? 5. Please see forminha No.104 on which 1 should like your views. As regards request in Katodon 92 War Office could supply 15,000 additional 1914 pattern rifles if Government of India would give in respect of them indemnity suggested in paragraph 4 of my telegram No.2364. 6. As regards Hatodon 93 I would like your views regarding type of aircraft to be supplied, training of pilots in India and suggestion that R.A.I. officer should visit Kabul. 'Ihere is a good deal to be said for selling the Aighans as far as possible the type of aircraft they ash for and not scekm 0 unduly to innuence them in their choice. Air Ministry regret that it is unlikely that either Harts or fcisc .vein be available m numbers unail 1937, but scats that Dragons would be available at once. 7. If you accept proposal in paragraph 3 please telegraph your recommendations regarding offer which has now to/■go be made bo the Ai&amp;han Goverriinent. I am inclined to cutest ihat it might be on the lines that we are willing to supply (a) 10,000 rifles at once to be paid for in six e qua 1 a nnu a 1 i ns t a Irn ents; (b) two aeroplanes iio be delivered as scon as possible and paid lor in six equal annual instalments. There may be some delay in elfacting delivery owing to British aircraft works being occupied with R.A.F. expansion programme, (c) additional aeroplanes at any time for cash, (d) as regards 15,000 further rifles and 6 million rounds ammunition see Form ini: a ho. 104. 8. If you reel it impossible to undertake contingent liability in respect of 5(d), we might try to postpone definite ieply to Afghan Government on this point until general question is settled. It seems however essential to dispose at once of question of 10,000 rifles and open negotiations regarding aeroplanes. If you lind it convenient you will no doubt telegraph separately in advance regarding 5(a) and reserve other heads for further examination.British Le^fition, KAhuX, ^ Private &amp; Personal* 10th septenbor, 19ii5* Pear Aeheson, Two years at Binla and Delhi have lei't me with no illusions as to the difficulties with which the Government of India are faced in arriving at decisions on any question.

The decision on question of financial responsibility for transaction is not likely to be arrived at for some time. Meantime without prejudice Government of India’s attitude in that question suggest you should consider carefully the minimum number of aircraft which would suffice to meet the real requirements of the Afghan Goverment. From rough estimate made here it appears that cost of 24 bare machines without armaments or accessories would be not less than 15 lakhs. Additional expenditure on this scale over and above cost of rifles seems incompatible with serious intention to repay or with desire of Afghan Government to effect economic rehabilitation of country. I need not remind you of the necessity for not committing the Government of India in any way in case you think it necessary to discuss matter again at present stage with Afghan authorities. We have no idea of the extent, if any, to which His Majesty’s Government may be willing to help and, if they won’t, I doubt very much whether the Government of India will be able to do anything appreciable in the way of aeroplanes, apart altogether from their willingness to do so. i I INDIA p ^ The issue of the above has been authorised.

'./ALTON DATED 12TH ArRIL, 1935. Your letter of the 11th April. My apologies for leaving you in the air about the arms and aircraft. Just before I left Kabul - a day or two I think - I got a chance of mentioning the subject - not to the prime Minister but to the War Minister - and said as regards aircraft that there seemed to me little likelihood of H.M.G. agreeing on the terms suggested to the supply of 24 aircraft en bloc, even if they were prepared to consider the proposal for supply on credit at all. Had he got hangars for 24? and the maintenance staff? 24 aircraft as we had'already agreed would be of no practical value whatever in event of hostilities with either Russia or India (N.B. this was a joke I) so would it not be better to get if possible a very few specimens of the most likely type first - see if this was suited to local requirements and expand later if necessary? The War Minister at once suggested the supply of 12 aircraft now and more in a year or two. At this point the conversation was interrupted but the War Minister’s retreat at the first touch from 24 to 12 tends I think to confirm my vie?/ expressed in para. 3 of my memo. No. 824 of the 27th February that the figures 24 and 30000 were maxima which were not intended very seriously as is indeed suggested by the fact that 24 aircraft could not be housed at Kabul and 30000 rifles could not be put on parade for the Independence Celebrations. It seems to me another instance - such as I think I mentioned to you the other day - of the necessity of avoiding the mistake on the one hand of taking Afghan requests quite literally and2 . on the other hand of concluding that because - being Orientals - they do not mean what they say they therefore mean nothing at all. Our job is - it seems to me - having got a request which is exaggerated and impracticable onthe face of it then to take charge of the case ourselves and decide what the core of reality in it is, and deal with that, merely telling the Afghans what we are or are not prepared to do. For instance it might be decided to supply the Afghans with 4 aircraft and 5000 rifles on credit at once, figures which I myself think would be sufficient for the purpose immediately in view viz. propaganda on the occasion of the Independence Celebrations. But here I came up against the difficulty that 1 was just handing over and any definite recommendations by myself which I would not be in a position to handle might prove embarrassing to my successor. I therefore left a note of my conversation with the War Minister with the G.of I. and talked informally on the above lines on the understanding that they would be in a position to reach a definite conclusion after discussing the whole thing with F.T.INDIA OFFICE, /HITEHALL. S.-V. 1. tfith April, 1935. You will be interested to see the enclosed telegram from the Government of India of 8th &lt;vprii, which was received after 1 saw yoa on Jfonday. Paragraph 3 (A)(i) contains a recantation of the curioas attitude of detachment in regard to revolutions in Afghanistan put forward 'provisionally* in their earlier telegram of 19th February* But what they go on to say about financial responsibility still shows a profoundly inadeouate appreciation of India*a interest in the maintenance of stability in Afghanistan. hat 1 really want to write to you about at the moment, however, is the questions of the supply of 30,000 rifles and 24 aeroplanes and the training of Afghan pilots in India, which were discussed by you with Afghan inisters on 21st February.

I enclose a rough note of a discussion held on 21st February in which the Prime Minister, the Minister of War, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Military Attache of this Legation and I took part. 3. 1 propose to suggest to the Prime Minister before I leave here that it would not be useful for a Royal Air Force officer to visit Kabul, until the main features of the programme have been considered by His Majesty f s Government and the Government of India, and discussed with the latter by me at Delhi. I shall also give him a hint that there is little likelihood of this programme being accepted in full. My own impression is that the figures mentioned by the Ministers are maxima which they hardly expect to be actually reached.4 # Before this interview I expressed to Colonel Lockhart my belief that the Afghan request for arms and aircraft was partly due to a recently developed fear of Persian aggression, but that Afghan amour propre would never allow the Ministers to admit this. The fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs did admit t-.is fear, suggests that it is actually more acute than I realised. 5. A copy of the memorandum is being sent to the General Staff. (Sd.) R.R.Maconaohie. His Majesty*s Minister, KabulNOTE 1* Aircraft . (i) The Minister of War stated that his Government wished to purchase from His Majesty*s Government 24 aircraft. He had studied the details of specifications and performance of various types of British aircraft supplied to him hy the Hoyal Air Force, India, through His Majesty*s Legation, and had come to the conclusion that what he needed was - 20 Hawker Harts or Fairey ^oxes 4 D,H.Dragons, (He made no mention of the advice given to the Afghan air force officers by the Royal Air Force through the Military Attache to the effect that other machines than these were better suited to Afghan requirements), (ii) I said that although I knew nothing about the subject the Military Attache” and I had discussed it with the Royal Air Force India, and as a result of these discussions would suggest that the Afghan Government should not be carried away by the idea of possessing high performance machines built for special purposes, which were difficult to fly and unsuited to their own particular requirements. Would it not be better to see first what those requirements really were, and then go for the simplest and cheapest type of machine which would meet them? (iii) The Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs entirely agreed that this was the right method of approaching the question. tm The/ iThe Minister for War then stated that he required machines for reconnaissance, light bombing, and carrying small parties of officers - (hence the Dragons) - with a ceiling of 18,000* so as to cross the Hindu Kush, and a ran^e of 500 miles continuous flight so as to reach Herat from Kabul in one hop. He asked for prices of various accessories, arimament etc. most of which had in fact already been communicated to the Afghan air force, (iv) He stated that the Afghan air force had 28 pilots, but these had received no uniform training, having learnt to fly in di ferent countries France, Italy, Russia, etc. He wished to send them to India, or other suitable locality, for training on the machines which the Afghan Government might decide to buy from us. (v) I suggested that before any decision on the point was reached it might be desirable for a Royal Air Force expert to come to Kabul and advise the Minister of War. This was agreed to, and it was proposed that this officer should be asked to come to Kabul before I left, but I said that this was impracticable. 2. Small arms . (i) Minister of /ar confirmed that 30,000 short .303 rifles in first class condition were required. In A answer to my enquiry, he said that the idea of rearmament with rifles of a different bore had been abandoned, as the disadvantages involved (via. danger of confusion in regard/regard to anmnmition supply in time of war) outweighed advantages (viz* prevention of leakage of ammunition in time of peace). (ii) he also asked for a sample of the Vickers Bertliier light automatic gun which the Afghan officers had seen durin^ their recent visit to the Delhi manoeuvres. 3. General . (i)Asked as regards their proposal for payment the Ministers suggested instalments spread over six years. (ii) They expressed a desire that the pilots should he trained, and the aircraft and rifles delivered in time to impress the populace at the independence celebrations of August 1935. (iii) l pointed out that I would probably have to give the authorities considering thear proposals answers to certain questions, which I would now put to the Ministers. (a) For what purpose were these additional aircraft and rifles required? I had seen in a recent publication that the present strength of the Afghan regular army was 70,000, and I suggested that this seemed unnecessarily large for internal security purposes and of little practical use for external defence, since the real military strength of Afghanistan, as history had shown, lay in its irregular, not in it regular forces. King Nadir Shah had told me that, as soon as roads had been constructed/constructed to the necessary mobility, the army would be kept at a permanent strength of some 35,000. The present size of the army seemed to involve a severe drain on the economic resources of the country. If the array were reduced it seemed possible that the money thus set free could be employed in economic development, in regard to which the Ministers had already asked for assistance. The Prime Minister said that the present army was much smaller than that of Habibullah^ time, when they also had a guarantee of British protection. The roads were not really reads at ail, and at times, (arch as now between ITabul and Kandahar) were completely impassable. The army was required at its present strength to overawe the tribes, and maintain internal peace. It had also to watch an enormous extent of frontier, and the P.ussian border was now held in a strength of only s even men to every six miles. The duties of these detachments were to stop smuggling and petty raids, and even these duties were beyond them. It was of course absurd to suppose that the Afghan array could effectively oppose an invasion from Russia. This would have been impossiole even when he himself was in Moscow and the military strength of the Soviet Union had he understood increased ten times since then. No question of hostilities with/with India oi' course arose* hut for argument’s sake it could he stated that an Afghan army of 300,000 would he unahle if only through lack of equipment, artillery, aircraft, etc. to meet the Indian Army in the field. The Minister of War pointed out that although a large standing army was expensive, its reduction below the safety line, as Amanullah had proved, was really more expensive, since it led to disturbances, such as the Khost rebellion of 1924, which leaving out of account the loss of life, had coat Afghanistan millions of rupees. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that there was another possibility which if not imminent was real and important. Persia was becoming comparatively wealthy, ana developing a powerful army. Fahrettin Pasha during his recent visit to Kabul had said that these developments were a real menace to Turkey, but even more so to Afghanistan. Afghanistan, Faiz Muhammad went on, sincerely desired peace with Persia, and had no idea whatever of aggression in that direction any more than in any other. But Persia's attitude was not at all satisfactory. He quoted the Persian communiques in regard to the Zurabad affair, and saia that although it had been agreed between the Persian ana Afghan Governments that the status quo/quo should he maintained in the Musahad sector pending the annoiineement of the Turkish Commission’s award, the Amir-i-lashkar-i-sharq (the Persian military commander in Khorasban) had recently visited the frontier with troops, expelled tribesmen, and given orders for the construction of an aerodrome at Persian Karez, 8 (sic) miles West of Islam Kila* Paiz Muhammad then took a copy of the 'Iran* out of his pocket, and said that the official explanation of the change of name from 'Persia* to 'Iran', although ridiculous, was at the same time important, particularly the second reason given in an article in the 'Iran' which he read out, referring to the old Iranian empire. This empire, he said, had included Afghanistan, Bokhara Baluchistan, etc. and it wouldbe a mistake to disregard froth of this kind as altogether ridiculous. It was that, but it was also very significant* The aircraft and the rifles were therefore required (a) to maintain internal peace by impressing the tribes (pax*ticularly at the Independence celebrations which were attended by people from all parts of Afghanistan) and (b) for possible defence against Persia, (b)/(Td) I said there was another difficulty to which I had referred at my interview of the 22nd January. This was that if the present Afghan Government fell their armament would, as in 1929, come into the hands of the tribes on the frontier of India and so greatly increase our problem of maintaining peace in that area# The Ministers said that so long as Great Britain and Afghanistan stood together the Afghan Government could not fall. I pointed out that any such relations did not obviate the danger of assassination and that the sudden removal of the three Ministers present might mean the collapse of their Government. They replied that this would be an act of God, and that risks were always involved in any course of action# The Prime Minister pointed out that ii the Afghan Government were weak, rifles might quite possibly be distributed among their tribes by Soviet agents in far larger quantities than those held by the Afghan Government, so that any weakness of the Afghan Government through lack of arms also involved a real danger of an increase of armaments in the trioal belt# (b) I asked what the attitude of the Afghan Government was in regard to the present hiament of the frontier tribes, which seemed to me to be a menace to the peace of both India and Afghanistan# The/The Minister of Foreign Affairs said that -with a strong regular army they would he able to proceed with disarmament which they already had in view. Provided the Afghan tribes were sufficiently impressed by the military strength of the Central Government such disarmament could be effected without any fighting. The rifles now required would help to achieve this object. The Minister of War said that they had in fact already recovered some 25,000 rifles. The Prime Minister remarked that these were all useless and in disrepair. If they were shown to Colonel Lockhart the latter would certainly say ^elt them all down’; but it was quite true that, even if the Afghan Government had hitherto been unsuccessful in disarming their tribes, they could expect success in this direction if they improved the armament of their regular army as now proposed.

The purpose of the negotiations was to facilitate the financing and purchase of military aircraft – and related equipment, weapons and ammunition – from British sources for the Afghan Air Force, and to provide for the provision of training for Afghan pilots and mechanics in India. The file also outlines the establishment of the Afghan reserve fund by the Government of India for the purpose of funding expenditure related to Afghanistan.A tour (1936-37) by the Afghan Air Commandant, Ghund Mishar Muhammad Ihdan Khan, of India (Peshwar, Risalpur, and Karachi) and the United Kingdom is also documented in the file; the tour was undertaken at the invitation of the Government of India in order to demonstrate British aircraft and Royal Air Force ground operations. The file therefore includes a number of reports from British officers on the progress of the tour.The main correspondents in the file are as follows: HM Minister in Kabul (Richard Roy Maconachie and William Kerr Fraser Tyler), officials of the Air Ministry, officials of the Foreign Office, officials of the India Office, and representatives of the Foreign and Political Department (Department of External Affairs from 1937) of the Government of India. The file also contains a limited amount of correspondence with the Afghan Legation and representatives of Hawker Aircraft Limited, as the company chosen to supply the aircraft.A sketch map of Afghanistan can be found on folio 490 illustrating the effective action of the Westland Wapiti from Kabul, Kandahar, Herat, and Farah.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
