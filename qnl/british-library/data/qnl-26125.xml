As it has been proposed that l should go to England this summer to discuss details connected with the transfer with the India Ofiice and the Colonial Office, I have prepared a note reviewing the fourteen points that were then discussed, and adding remarks on further questions that appear to me to require consideration and decision before the transfer takes place. I enclose a copy of this note. 1 also enclose a copy of a draft estimate for Aden (as disuinct from the Aden Protectorate) showing probable revenue and expenditure after its separation from India. I am sending a copy of the note and of the draft estimate to the Colonial Office and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Yours sincerely, (SD.) B.E.Reilly. V/alton, Esq., C. B. ,M.

It was agreed at the meeting held in 1933 that the India Office should ascertain whether mail steamers must call at Aden under the terms of their contract with the Government of India, and it was proposed that the existing arrangement should, if the Government of India agree, remain uncharged, at any rate for the balance of the period, of the Government of Indian present mail contract, I do not know what has been done with regard to this matter since the 1933 meeting, but I hope that an arrangement can be made as proposed.

A My dear Walton, Will you kindly refer to your demi-official letter No.P.Z.5673/35, dated the 29th August, 1936, to Mr. Acheson, Foreign Secretary, I have been asked to reply direct to you / so far as the Posts and Telegraphs Department is concerned. The total receipts and expenditure of the Aden head post office and of the five sub post offices under it during the years 1933-34 and 1934-35 are shown in detail in the accompanying statements. As noted therein the expenditure on staff is based on actual payments made after deducting the emergency cut in pay which was 5;j of pay in the years 1933-34 and 1934-35. No allowance is m^de for leave and pension charges. As regards the telephone system in Aden, I would request a reference to/Clow^ letter No.P-228/33 dated the 9th January 1936 to the address of the Under Secretary of State for India, a profit and it has been proposed to give some relief to the subscribers by reducing the rate of rental for direct connections. The existing contract for the conveyance of mails between England and India by the P. &amp; 0. S. N. Company's ships is between His Imperial Majesty's Government and the Company and contract was executed in 1908 for a period of seven years subject to determination at or after the expiry of that period on giving in force and as at present arranged is not terminable before the 31st January, 1938. In accordance with the terms of the contract, the mail steamers between England and India must call Department, India Office.

My dear Acheson, As you know, Reilly will have completed five years as Resident at Aden next February, and in March 1937 he will be 55 years of age. lou will no doubt agree that it is very desirable that Reilly should continue at Aden to see through the transier irom the control of the Government of India to that oi the Colonial Office. He himself is not only willing but quite anxious to do so. I have mentioned the matter to Metcalfe, who personally agrees, and have discussed it iniormally with the Colonial Office. They are very aesirous of retaining Reilly’s services for the transitional period before and after transfer. The Colonial Office, 'therefore, would not only not object, but would be extremely pleasedii Reilly, a s an Indian service officer, could continue to hold his present post beyond the expiry of his / live years, and until such time as transfer takes place. It is expecued, I understand, that provincial autonomy will come into being about April 1937, and this would seem to be the most convenient date also for the transier oi Aden. You will remember that Sir Samuel Hoare stated in the House of Commons on 9th April 1935 that 'it is oui intention to bring the change into operation at or about the same time as provincial autonomy'. if for any reason the date of provincial autonomy, and consequently of transfer, ./ere retarded lor a brief period beyond the end of March 1937, it might oe necessary to relax the 55-year rule for a month or two in Reilly’s favour, but presumably this does not J.G.Acheson, Esq., C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign &amp; Political Department.2. constitute a serious obstacle* On transfer taking place the Colonial Office would appoint Reilly as the first Governor. He would thus be in charge both before and immediately after transfer to supervise the manifold practical arrangements, small and great, which iiave to be made to ensure a smooth transition. Could you veryjkindly let me know as soon as possible whether you agree, so far as the Government of India are concerned, to Reilly remaining at Aden until the date of transfer? With reference to Metcalfe*s letter of 11th May and to the Government of India's express letter of 9th August, there will apparently be plenty of time to consider the practical details of the administrative change, if it does not take place till the date of provincial autonomy. The Colonial Office, 1 understand, contemplate consideration of these details, perhaps by a small committee, when Reilly is at home next summer- arid this would appear to be the best procedure. Meanwhile we can go on preparing the material for such consideration. in a letter to Fraser-Tytler of 25th August 1933 1 enclosed a note of an earlier tentative discussion. Perhaps you could let me have in due course the information which will be required from the Government of India on two points (Nos.2 and 4) in that note. Yours sincerely, (SD.) J. C. V/ALTON•I Financial Secretary, Please see the papers helow. I should he grateful if you would confirm that under the terms of the mail contract nail steamers between England and India must at present call at Aden. Have you any observations on the question generally, and do you anticipate that the Government of India are likely to see objection to a continuation of existing arrangements either (a) for the period of the present nail contract (the date of expiry of which we should be glad to learn), or (b) as a more permanent measure? •vVl y &amp; It - If C*&gt; ^ e J O, l 7 J oL U' 1 c4 / -3- 1 /net r ^f ^3 A-*^» XJ*-^ &lt;jyLlc to erf ■ g/ ^.Ck^c5./ Letter from Colonel R e illy to Mr«Lai thy/ait e LuLiS99/33. Tel: Lymn^ Dear Laithwaite, In conversation in London some weeks ago it was suggested that I should enumerate some of the points that will require consideration if Aden is separated from India. Those that occur to me are:- 4. Mail contract . The mail steamers between England and India must at present call at Aden under the terns of their contract with the G-ovemment of India. If Aden is separated from India an arrangement for its mail service will presumably be made by the Imperial Government.13 r / (The references in the. .note below ? are to the points raised in Colonel Reilly 1 s demi-official letter of 10th August 1933). Colonel Reilly’s d.o. letter of 10th August 1933 was discussed at the India Office on 15th August. In addition to Colonel Reilly there were present Mr. Cowell of the Colonial Office, Mr. Walton and Mr. Laithwaite of the India Office. 4. Mall contract * It was agreed that the India Office should ascertain whether Colonel Reilly*s statement that under the terms of their contract with the Governnent of India the mall steamers between England and Inuia must at present call at Aden was correct. It was also generally agreed that the simplest course would be to allow existing arrangements, if the Government of India agree, to remain unchanged, at any rate for the balance of the period of the Government of India’s present mail contract.mm</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00000a_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1474</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00000a</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1474</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 1/38 'Aden.
