Cairo No. 406 (repeating to the Minister of State as my telegram No. 26). Your telegram No. 832, paragraph 11. I fear that I may have failed to make my views clear. My telegram No. 798 referred to a proposal 'to raise something in the nature of a military force from Kurdistan in Northern Iraq, who (as you pointed out), once trained, might subsequently use their power against Bagdad'. (Telegram No. 609) I took this to involve recruiting throughout the North, and proper training. The Iraqi Government would certainly object [grp. undec],[?grp. omitted: be] also opposed to it owing to the probable [sic: ? probability] of political repercussion. My telegram No. 389 refers to what I imagine to be an entirely different scheme, namely the employment of Kurdish tribe for defence of certain frontier passes in the North. (See Cairo telegram No. 45 LIMIT). For this, only tribes living on the spot could be employed and it would be useless to give them regular training. The Iraqi Government would be kept fully informed and as I pointed out might want, if they approved of the scheme, to co-operate. The same political objections to it do not exist, but I now think that I may have been too optimistic in thinking that it would appeal to the Iraqi Government though I had not sounded any of the Ministers. I have already expressed ray opinion to General Officer Commanding that the employment of tribes in such a manner must be supplementary to regular defence of the passes since they cannot be expected to stand up against modern forces even if directed by British ofilcers. As you will see, I have not revised my views though I may have misunderstood the proposed scheme. [ Note by Communications Department.

Careful consideration has been given to your telegram under reference by all the Departments concerned. 4. I will now deal with points in your telegram under reference in order . 5. Paragraph 1 of your telegram. I should lil:e to .be represented on sub-committee and suggest that member of staff of His Majesty’s Erfbsssy at Cairo should sit on it for consultation on political aspects of any.problems discussed. He could refer to me for instructions or guidance where necessary,* j^ou will no doubt be able in consultation with Mis majesty 1 s Ambassador to devise some machinery for this purpose. 6 . Paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5 of your.telegram. I.have seen correspondence in question and outgoing telegrams from Mar Office were drafted in consultation with Foreign Office. 3. In the first place we rugt explain that Soviet Government, although now our Allies, have not abandoned in their relations with us suspicion of i.iotives of foreign governments which has always been characteristic of them and they are not receptive of our advice in matters which concern their internal affairs. Your proposal, therefore, that we should suggest that they should make some.: concessions to Caucasian Republics and Armenians presents insuperable difficulty.• Any suspicion that we are dealing with the Dashnaks (and goviet Government are very likely to hear of it since their intelligence system is good, would have worst possible effect. Turkish Government for their part, in spite of recent joint Anglo- Soviet assurances to them, remain extremely suspicious of Russians, whom they regard as hereditary enemies, and of our alliance with them. It is, I fear, out of the question to hope .that-they can be induced to tage any action in matter under discussion for sake of helping Russians against Germans, more especially since they would be terrified of German.reactions. In general we feel that results which can be expected from your proposals are unlikely to outweigh grave political and military .objection to irrita-ting Russians and alienating Turks. 7 *, ^ aratira ? ils 6 ’ , 7 an(i ^ and paragraph 10 (b) of your telegram ueal with questions oi Dashna.xs and attitude of ourselves and Soviet and Turkish Governments towards them. His Majesty’s Ambassador Moscow emphatically endorses view already held here and makes it clear that «n,v r'nTvhan'hs wi-hT-i r\Qo'h-n_ . .. . ^ . . r co-onera R£Co. POt.1bfcPr tion in various areas which he l Though we appreciate that hopes will later extend to contact with Gashnaxts would be • mtp 941 j in/ 1 m n, A O 1•V pr&gt; X Sir in connexion witi. operations.wnicli would taice place after loss of control by LIoscow Governj.ient raere fact of conversations with Dashnaks would, if known to Russians,. have, eciually serious effect. This risk is clearly not worth taking in absence of evidence. (i) that Dashnaks who, according to our information are somewhat scattered emigr£ organisation of pronounced anti-Soviet and anti-Turkish tendencies, are possessed of organisation and influence in Armenia which would enable them at the appropriate moment, either to co-operate v/ith or to replace local leaders afid administration in Soviet Armenia; to inspire in Armenia widespread resistance to Germans; and to organise guerilla warfare on effective scale; (ii) that Dashnak leader with whom you are in contact is able to commit movement and sufficiently to command allegiance of Dashnaks (I note that Commander-in-Chief Riddle East says in his telegram No. 8 3805 of 20th July to ; Var Office that the Dashnak organisation suffers from lack of cohesion and is only one apparently of several similar Armenian bodies); (iii) that better chance of securing local resistance to the Germans would not lie, when eventuality arises, in co-operation with present local authorities in Armenia; for it is clearly unlikely that it would be practicable . for us to co-operate both with them and with Dashnaks; (iv) that Dashnaks are not merely insuring themselves with both sidea; for in that case in situation presupposed, namely successful German invasion of Caucasus area,-they would surely be likely to back the Germans. Paragraph 4 of War Office te leg ram Ho. 81146 to Commander- in-Chief kiddle East, to Which no answer has been received, v/as designed to elucidate such questions. » 8 . There has been no development in relations betv/een His Majesty’s Government and Soviet Government which in our view would make it possible to revise decision contained in paragraph 8 of*War Office, telegra 5 k_No• 79456 to Commander-in-Chief Middle East (see paragraph 3 abo ve). ^ ~ 9. There are practically no Armenians in Turkey except a comparatively small community in Istanbul (Constantinople) and the past history of Turco-Armenian relations and the present attitude of Turkish Government towards Soviet Government, as explained in paragraph 3 above, makes it impossible-in our opinion to raise this question with the Turkish Government either (see also A n G' ora telegrams to you Nos. 586.and 691). &lt; &lt; ‘ 10. In circumstances we are clear therefore that all contacts with Dashnaks should cease forthwith. Unless His Majesty’s Ambassador at Moscow sees objection you may, if you wish, advise Dashnaks to make their own approach to Soviet Government. If this course were adopted, it would, I consider, be necessary to inform the Soviet Government that the Dashnaks had approached us and that so far from dealing v/ith them behind the back of the Soviet Government, we had advised a direct approach. This would leave • our/ ti A 1 5443 IS 41 our hands free to co-operate with local Soviet authorities in Caucasus either through L'oscow authorities or (in event of their losing control or contact with Caucasus) direct. It was principally to prepare for this eventuality that we approached Soviet Government with view to establishment of British Consulate at Baku. Unfortunately they have hitherto declined our proposal, v/hich in itself is evidence of their suspicion of anything tending tov/ards interference in their internal affairs. We still hope it may prove possible to secure Soviet Government’s agreement to this or some analogous proposal. 11. paragraph 9 and paragraph 10 (c) of your telegram. I now observe from Sir K. Cornwallis’ telegram to you No. 389 that he has revised the viev/s expressed in his telegram No. 96 to CoiTikander-in-Chief kiddle East and sees no objection to £&gt;P 0 P°sal in question. I consider, however, that we should proceed with great caution in this matter especially as regards reactions of Turkish Government, since Soviet Ambassador is recommending to his Government that they should give assurances to Turkish Government that they have no intentioh of tampering v/ith Kurds. In'any case approach should not be made to Kurds in Turkey. 12. Paragraph 10 (a) of your telegram. Jar Cabinet has decided that liaison mission should consist only of officers for liaison between Russian and British forces operating in Persia and must not include experts on other questions. This decision rules out suggestion for using- officers of G.R. Mission for contact with Caucasian Republics, v/hich in unlikely event of such contacts being possible would certainljr cause trouble with the Soviet Government. Possibility of officers of G.R. kiss ion accompanying 131 Mission (Berthoud’s follow-up party) is being examined. War Office will keep Coramander-in-Chief Middle East informed. Question of inclusion in liaison mission of a naval officer and an air force officer has been dealt v/ith by Service Departments. 13. Paragraph 10 (d) of your telegram. In view of Mr. Greenway’s presence in Tehran and contact maintained through him with Soviet Embassy there, it would seem unnecessary for Mid-Asia Bureau to sena special representative to Tehran. In any case developments in Anglo-Soviet policy towards Persia in near future are likely to render unnecessary special arrangements to deal v/ith problem in question. 14. Paragraph 10 (e) of your telegram. I fear that attitude of Turkish Government, as explained in paragraph 3 of this telegram, renders sue!, action impossible, and His Majesty’s Ambassador at Moscow, endorses our view that Soviet Government would very much*resent such an approach by Turkish Government. 15.

Following from minister of state. Most Secret. I have arranged for the setting up of a sub-coiriiiittee of the Middle Last War Council to co-ordinate sabotage, subversive and other secret operations in the Middle East. The committee of which I am chairman consists of representatives of the Commanders-in-chief and of S.u.E., j.(RJ, . 1.6 and other organizations affected. 2. You will doubtless have seen recent telegrams between the War Office and General Headquarters Middle East about possibilities of making contact with Armenia and other Caucasian Republics in order to organize guerilla activities against the German lines of communication if Russia oollapsest and to destroy oil stocks and refineries. It was suggested that the Soviet Government should be approached to make some concessions to the Caucasian Republics and to the Armenians in order to rally them to the side of the Allies since the Caucasian Republics are by no means firm in their support of the Soviet Government. It was further su gested that the ''urk.ish Government should be approached to use their influence which is considerable, on the IviOhammedan Caucasian States to support Russia against Germany. 3. The War Office have agreed to the formation of a *id-Asiatic Bureau at C^iro to deal with Caucasia and Trans—Caucasia including territory between the Black Sea and the Caspian lying to the north of the frontier of Turkey, Iraq end Iran (Persia). 4. The ,ar Office have also agreed to the collection at once of a G (R) iiusfii^n mission to be held in readiness at the most convenient place for a rapid move on receipt of orders from London. b. Ihey have however rejected the suggestion of approaching the covlet Government to make concessions to Armenia ana the Caucasian Republics on the ground th^t the Soviet Government would not be likelyI to aonuiesee. - * I 6 . Of the importance of the establishing of some form of instructions/JLu 1 5317 1941 instructions accordingly to his party in Telriran and Iraq. He urged that we should ask the Soviet Government for some gesture in favour of the Armenians such as a promise of increased autonomy and release of Armenian prisoners in Siberia. If this was forthcoming the head of the Dashnaks offered to go to Armenia and organize resistance. Brigadier Clayton is satisfied of his sincerity. No hopes have been held out to the Dashnaks but they have been told that their proposals which are entirely spontaneous have been submitted to His iiaje 8 ty *3 Government. 7. I understand that you have hitherto refused to consider any approach to the Soviet Government on this subject, I hope that you will now be prepared to reverse this decision. The Soviet Government have made approaches to the Dashnaks in the past and it now seems reasonable to suppose that they would be glad of their co-operation. 8. The effect on Turkey may be bad but the Dashnaks have undertaken to commit no act of hostility against the Turks as long as they do not co-operate with the Germans. In any case the position is that unless we are prepared to use the Armenians ourselves they will turn to the Germans. I consider we should use them. I would go further and suggest that unless His Majesty’s jnbassador at ^gora sees insuperable objections* an approach should be made to the Turkish Government, to obtain their consent to the above course. 9. The position in the Caucasus is closely linked up with the defence of Iraq and this again is bound up with the Kurdish problem. There are serious dangers in tampering with Kurdish nationalism in Iraq since this might provoke a rising against the Iraqi Government which we ourselves might be called upon to repress. While therefore we should avoid any movement calculated to raise Kurdish political hopes it should be possible to organize Kurdish tribesmen to hold the passes on the frontier without doing so.E i r—i '1 « 5317 19 4 1 10. Above raattere were considered at a meeting™ of the sub-Commlttee of the Middle East Tar Council this morning and the following recommendations made: 0 va) Military Mission is standing by in India to go to Caucasia for contact with Russian military authorities in connexion with possible Anglo-Soviet military action in Iran. It is suggested that the mission could also be used as a vehicle for contact withthe Caucasian Republics and that special officers should be attached to it for this purpose. This might pave the way to the establishment oi Middle ^ast G.R.mission for Caucasia already sanctioned by the War Office Commander in Chief Mediterranean suggests that as he has been unable to get in contact with the Soviet naval authorities at Baku a naval officer should be attached to the mission. Air Officer Commanding in Chief would also like to attach an officer to the mission. If this proposal is approved the matter might be taken up direct between the Commanders in Chief Middle East with the Commander in Chief India. (b) His Majesty’s Ambassadors at Moscow and Angora should be consulted in regard to organisation by the Dashnak of Armenians in the Soviet Union and Turkey. If they l eel that it is undesirable for us to approach those governments the Dashnaks miglit be told to approach them themselves. (c) His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad should be asked whether the Iraqi Government is likely to consent to tritish officers and non-commissioned officers organising the Kurdish tribesmen for defence of certain Iranian frontier passes. (d) I understand that large quantities of goods from Germany to Iran and Iran to Germany are being conveyed daily by motor transport along the Erzeroum-Tabriz road. It is reported that the Soviet Embassy at Tehran are anxious to put a stop to this traffic. It is suggested that a senior officer of the Mid-Asia Bureau should proceed to Tehran to make contact with the Soviet Embassy there through His Majesty s Legation. He should try to persuade the Soviet authorities to send a joint Anglo-Soviet mission to carry out sabotage through Soviet territory in the Nakhichevan area against the Iranian portion of the road. (d) Turkish Government should be approached with a view to enlisting their influence with Caucasian Muslims.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000120_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/570</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x000120</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/570</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Ext 5317/41(S) 'Co-ordination of sabotage + subversive activities in the Middle East'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1941/1941</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-02-16T23:51:10</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (31 folios)</extent><extent>Arranged by chronological order from back to front</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 33; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence in the form of telegrams, many of which are annotated by hand, between the Foreign Office and the Ministers of States stationed in Cairo, Ankara, Baghdad, Moscow, Tehran, and the Government of India.
