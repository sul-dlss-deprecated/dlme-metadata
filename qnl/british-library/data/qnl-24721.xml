Dear Sir: I em today in receipt of a summons from the Indian Assistant to H.B.M’s political Agent, Bahrein, directing me to present myself in the Court on April 20, 1939 to answer the protest you have lodged against me with regard to a sum of Rs.100/- in payment of Hand Note I had given to one Mr. Khaduri seleh. In this connection, I have to draw your attention to your notice of advice to me dated the 3rd inst. From this it was not quite clear whether the notice was just a formal one or whether it was subject to my acknowledging it. Under the circumstances, I was under the impression that the said amount would be paid to Mr. Khaduir Saleh end debited to my account. Inasmuch as this was not done, I presume at the moment, that acknowledgment from me would have enabled you to realise the money from my account. This was due to the fact that I am not aoquanited with your Bank procedure. It will be therefore in order for you to debit this amount to my account end would in the present instance request you to please confirm this to the Court thereby withdrawing the case against me. I am, Thanking you for all unnecessary trouble cc H.B.M*s Indian Assistant. FOR INFORMATION only, please.IN THE COURT OF Res. P. G.-40. tlie Political Agent, Bahrain. va&amp;irst To S.K.S.
