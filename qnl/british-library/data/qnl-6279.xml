This allowance was sanctioned to Assistant Surgeon Daood-ur-Rahman m Poreign Department letter No. 1575-E.A., dated the 13th May 1904, when it was proposed to send him to Koweit on deputation and when the appointment of Captain Knox as Political Agent, Koweit, was not yet sanctioned. But on his arrival here the Assistant Surgeon was detained pending further orders, and he was subsequently employed on quarantine duty. He left for Koweit on the 26th October 1904, and arrived there on the 27th idem. 3. The appointment of the Political Agent at Koweit, no doubt, alters the case for a grant of sumptuary allowance to the Assistant Surgeon, but I con sider that the reasons for allowing it, put forward by Captain Knox, are sufficient to warrant its being granted, although the Assistant Surgeon will not usually be^ our representative at Koweit. Under recent orders, however, it seems possible that the Assistant Surgeon may occasionally represent our interests; I therefore beg to support Captain Knox’s application and trust that the Government of India will be pleased to consider it favourably. No. 151, dated 11th January 1905. From— Captain S. G. Knox, LA., Political Agent, Koweit, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to forward, for favour of favourable consideration, the accompanying letter from Dr. Daood-ur-Rahman, with regard to his sumptuary allowance. I 2. Apart from the question as to whether it was originally promised to him or not at Calcutta, I have the honour to state that, in my opinion, Dr. Daood-ur-Rahman, a Sunni Muhammadan, should be able in time, to get closer to the Arab than an Englishman can hope to do, and that it is desirable that he should entertain to the best of his ability and that the expense should not fall on him. No. 10, dated 10th January 1905. From—Assistant Surgeon Daood-ur-Rahman, Koweit, To— Captain S. G. Knox, I.A., Political Agent, Koweit. I beg most respectfully to bring to your notice that when I was sent out from India for service at Koweit I was promised in audition to my grade pay a local allowance of Rs. 100, sumptuary allowance of Rs. 30 and house-rent Rs. 12 per mensem (as per Foreign Department No. 1575-E. A dated the' 13th May 1904). When I arrived at Bushire and was detained there, I requested the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to grant me the allowances of my post from the date of my arrival there. He was kind euongh to recom mend me for the local allowance and the house-rent but not the sumptuary allowance, and the Government of India accordingly sanctioned these from that date. I was in hopes, however, that on assuming charge of my duties at Koweit I would be permitted to draw all the allowances sanctioned in the abovemen- tioned letter of the Foreign Department, but now I am told by the Treasury Officer of Bushire that the sumptuary allowance is inadmissible. I beg to say that I generally receive visits from the respectable people of the place and also from some of the members of the Sheikh’s family and have to treat them with tea, coffee, etc., in return for similar treatment that I receivefrom them when I happen to call over at their place, and also because it is con sidered unbecoming in this place to let a visitor go without treating him with some such thing, and am therefore put to some expense on this account. I beg most respectfully to request, therefore, that you will be kind enough to recommend me to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to grant me the sumptuary allowance sanctioned by the Foreign Department from the date of my arrival at Koweit.Copy cf\a letter ?T c 4S2-F/ dated 3rd v ebruary 1905,from the Assistant Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta, to the Offg: Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf . p (Vf'A In reply to your letter Po 314, dated the 16th Peptember 1904, recommending Assistant Purgeons D'Pcuza and ^audar Rahman Khan for allowances similar to those drawn y the subordinate medical officers on sanitary duty at other Gulf ports, I am directed to convey the sanction of the Government of India to the grant of a local allowance at the rate of one f ifth of salary to Assistant Surgeon D f Souza while employed on sanitary duty in connection with the prevention of plague at Bushire , 2. „ . is different % Pe was permitted, vide letter Fo 3597-F B ric? rn he case of Assistant Surgeon ^audar Rahman Khan ^ dated 25th October 1904, from the Government of India in the Foreign Department, to draw the full allowances of his * « substantive appointment whilst awaiting deputation to Koweit during which time he had no ordinary duties to perj orm % The Government of Inaia are accordingly unable, in his case, to sanction an allowance for plague work in addition to his ordinary duties % rV&gt; ‘’rfdcfrfrA'dPKcf AH -C. of 1905.

It is now getting on for nine months and in that time you seem to have won the confidence of the people and managed tactfully a number of small commissions that 1 have entrusted you with. 1 have also to thank you for your attendance on me in one or two light attacks of sickness. You have had considerable hardships to put up with and borne them cheerfully when others might have grumbled. It has been a matter of sincere regret to me that 1 have not been able to house you comfortably’ but I think jou know what the situation is in tnat res pect. I hope you will get your quarters built this summer and that they will be all the more solid and comfortable because people have taken such a long time to think about their building. I shall always be glad to hear of your welfare, I have forgot to note the satisfaction with which I observed you take so kindly to the Arabic.

After having served in that post for nearly ^ years I applied for privilege leave to go to India to see my family and it was graciously granted to me. thought that the privilege leave of 2 months and 17 clays thus sanctioned to me would be considered as such and that I would get full leave allowance for * the period I was on leave. It was only under this impression that I availed myself of the. privilege leave sanctioned to me. I have been* however, infomi- -ed to my surprise b^ the Political Resident tnat my service comes under the category of an officer serving under a contract and that, therefore, I am not en- -titled to any leave allowance unless I am confirmed in Government service. If this be so I beg most res- -pectfully to request the favour of ^ our confirming me in Government service from the date of my' appoint- -mentappointment, I beg to add that the Government has not been put to any extra expenditure for getting a locum te- -nans in itiy place for the time I was absent on leave so / the Government will lose nothing by granting me my leave allowance, I beg further to add that almost all private in- -dividuals or companies who engage men for being sent out to foreign countries for long periods do grant their servants leave with good allowances to go home and see their families at certain fixed intervals. Government treats its servants with more indulgence and kindness than private companies; so, I do not see why I should be a ,9 harshly dealt with as not to get any leave allowance.

I would request you to kindly give orders to the Corporal in charge of the four •'Wireless’* men, to keep boiled water for drink- -ing purposes, preferably ’’Sirrah' water, as there have been se- -veral oases of Diarrhoea among men and children lately and Pte. Cornish has been suffering from it for the past four days, He has been removed to my quarters dor supervision and treatment and is progressing favourably. I would also ask that the following medical comforts may be requisitioned from the Base Hospital, Busreh for the use oft. the men when detained for treatment, as.there is a scarcity of milk, % etc., in the town. The articles can be kept with you and requi sitioned for when necessary, and the expenditure shown on a Diet sheet. i4 tins. 1 botthe 1 2 tins 2 tins Bradds essence of Beff or mutton, one dozen Diet sheets twelve.

Director ^edical Service I.E.F.'D', Basra for orders. Milk in Koweit is scarce and of very poor qua- -lity Tinned milk is therefore preferable. I venture to suggest that A.S. ''elly should be permitted to indent direct on a hospital in Dasra for medical srores and com forts required for detachments in Koweit. There are usually one or two xhh Military Officers in Koweit, 5 men of the Wireless tfept, and a few details of the S &amp; T, who are stationed here in connection with the purchase of camels. As it would not. be practicable to have a Medical Officer in charge of 1 such a small party, I would suggest that Asst.Surgeon C.C.Kelly, attached to this Agency should be put in charge, officially of all Military details in Koweit. His duties in this connection commenc* -ed with the arrival of the Wireless section on the 30th August 1916 and I would recommend that his appointment, if approved, may j have effect from that date. 1 Sd/ R.E.A. Hamilton, Major, Political Agent, Kuwait.110.^2-' of 1916. Politioil Agenoy, Kuwait. The 27th November 1916. To The Chief Political Officer, Basrah. Memorandum. I attach copies of correspondence wnich has passed between me and the Director Medical Service, I.E.F.‘'D” regarding the appointment of Assijwanu urgeon C.C. Kelly to hold medical cliarge of military details stationed at Kowei^ from time to time. The Director has referred me to Simla, but I think he may possi -ly have overlooked the fact that Koweit ij now included in the aree administered by Force 'D' and as such the appointment is one which would be made by the Army Co mander. In either event, i.e. whetner the appointment sh&gt;uld be made ii Simla or Basrah, I would request that the application may with your approval be forwarded to the proper authority. Assistant Surgeon Kelly has, as a matter of course, attended all oases of sickness among military details here and his duties in this connection began with the arrival of the Wireless Section on August 30th. Cases have been few but bad, and there being no hos- -pital or ambulance in Koweit, Assistant Surgeon Kelly has had per sonally to nurse, as well as prescribe for the patients. He also has carge of sanitary arrangements connected with camp and quarters of these details. Major,LINES OF COMMUNICATION ORDERS by Major-General G. F. Maomunn, C.B., D.S.O.

HHHHI HBHHI 1 y vCopy of Circular Memorandum No. E/5/292, dated the 18th Angust 1917, from the D. M. S., : esopotamian Ex: Force, to the Deputy Chief Political Officer, Basrah. It has come to notice that a number of Medical Officers are doing a considerable practice amon^ the Civil population in the way of dispensaries and are using for this purpose valuable compressed drugs and dressings from Grovemment stores. It should be made clear to Officers that their primary duty is towards the troops and that the treatment of the Civil population should be kept well within bounds. Where a number of local Dispensaries exist and private practitioners are available it is not correct to set up Military Dispensaries in opposition giving advice and treatment free and using up the valuable portable military stores of Croven&gt;ment. Whenever it is found necessary to use ' ilitrry stores for the civil population the drugs and dressingd should not be of the comoressed variety as they are very exnensive and difficult to obtain. I oderate demands on the Advanced Depot Medical Stores may be made for drugs and dressings for civil use on separate indents. These stores will not be of the cprapreased variety and it should be stated definitely on the indent that they are for civil use. All indents for Civil will be shown in a separate book by the Advance or Base Depot kedical btores and the dost of drugs and dressings issued should be stated, as the cost will later be mxdts met from Oivil Revenues. The Depot Medical Stores at Basra should indent for sufficient drugs and dressing for civil use^' as portability is not an urgent tiiOtiftiity the usual loose forms must be indented for II 1 . • i I \•t- • J l ’ - : • ' &gt; V 2 ^.
