The telegrams, &amp;c., reprinted below give the views of Lieut.-Col. Barrett, as Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, on the advantages and disadvantages of Koweit, and the relative merits of Koweit and Bahrein, as a site for the Persian Gulf Residency in the event of a decision to move from Bushire. India Office, J. G. L. 10th January 1930. I.—Arguments for and against KOWEIT. Express Message No. 293 S. of 1929 from the Hon. Lieut.-Col. C. C. J. Barrett, C.S.I. r C.L.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Pmshire, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. Your telegram No. 2243 C. of the 17th July 1929.Transfer of Residency * Not printed. headquarters to Kuwait. Arguments for:— 1. Brinos Resident definitely on Arab side, and in close personal touch with Gulf Arabs and their special problems. 2. Location of Residency will enhance the prestige of Kuwait and will support Kuwait independence against aggression of Iraq and Najd. 3. Resident will be brought into closer touch with the High Commissioner for Iraq and with Arab politics. 4. Resident will be in closer touch with the Navy, who now definitely avoid Persian ports as much as possible owing to Persian attitude. He will also be in touch with the Royal Air Force, which tinds it difficult to visit Bnsbire owing to Persian regulations. 5. Harbour is probably best in Gulf. 6. Motor-cars have brought Kuwait within four hours of Basrah and its sea and air communications. In favourable weather Baghdad could be reached by air in three and a half hours. 7. Kuwait offers excellent harbour for flying boats, which will in future become more and more useful as means of rapid transportation for inspection visits of short duration. 8. Resident will be freed from Persian bureaucratic control and at his own headquarters will assume position of high British representative instead of mere Consul-General. 9. Taken throughout the year best climate in the Gulf. Of the above, 1 and 7 apply with greater force in favour of Bahrain, while 8 could apply to both. Arguments against:— (a) Climate, though best in Gulf, is very bad in summer, and Resident would have to recess for three months each year. {b) Residency would have to be built as no suitable building available, (c) Complete lack of society. Although there is a handful of American missionaries there are no Europeans in Kuwait. {d) Bin Sand's polic} 7, has killed trade of Kuwait and few conveniences are procurable in its bazaars, which are much worse than those of Bahrain, (e) No facilities for recreation. (/) No conveniences such as electric power and ice. These are available in Bahrain and Bushire. (g) Lack of water. This is brought in dhows from the Euphrates. (7?) Depressing scenery owing to sand and absence of trees. In this respect it is much worse than Bushire or Bahrain. 4234 25 3.30 A2 (i) Although natural harbour is probably best in Gulf, it is undeveloped, and embarkation and disembarkation from steamers involve considerable difficulty at low tide. {j) Present sea communication, which is by slow Gulf mail calling weekly on journey to Basrah, but only fortnightly on journey from Basrah, is unsatisfactory. The nnpunctuality of this service is the cause of endless complaint. (k) Situation at extreme northern limit of Resident's charge makes headquarters unnecessarily far from India and from Muscat and the Trucial Coast, which requires more of the Resident's personal attention than it has received in the past. (Z) Lack of security owing to liability to raids from desert. (m) Absence of wireless and ease with which land line can be cut by raiders. Of these defects the following can be remedied :— (6) by building suitable Residency on suitable site which is available ; (cZ) by coming to an understanding with Bin Saud. This would probably be facilitated by transfer of Residency to Kuwait as this should kill Bin Saud's hope of forcing Shaikh to submit to absorption by Najd State; (e) by making tennis courts and playing fields for staff and clerks who would accompany Resident; (/) Government would presumably supply Resident and his stalf with these necessities in the climate of the Gulf ; (g) Government might consider question of condensing plant; {i) building of a Residency pier would meet this drawback ; (j) arrangements could probably be made for fast mail to call weekly. Owing to proximity of Basrah, this, though great convenience which would make move popular with inhabitants, is not such a vital necessity as it would be in the case of Bahrain ; (l) although raids have been conducted up to walls of Kuwait no attempt has been made to attack the town. The Kesidency would be safer than the Sabzabad Residency in time of tribal trouble. Shaikh of Kuwait, who looks upon himself as bone between the two dogs Iraq and Bin Saud, would welcome location of Residency in his territory as he would consider it as Government guarantee to preserve his independence. He anticipates move would settle his quarrel with Bin Saud and bring increased trade. In my opinion the greatest objection to Kuwait is its isolation at one extremity of the Gulf and the consequent difficulty of keeping adequate touch with Oman. Close liaison with Consular authorities in Khuzistan would be possible, but the move will decrease touch with the Persian coast south of Bushire. C. C. J. Barrett , Lieut-Colonel, Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf. II.—Relative merits of KOWEIT and BAHREIN. Telegram P. No. 2481 8., dated the ]4th August 1929, jrom the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla, to the Political Piesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. What are relative merits of Koweit and Bahrein ? Enquiry at this stage is only hypothetical, of course. This is with reference to your express message No. 293 S. Letter No. 354 S. of 1929 from the Hon. lAeut.-Col. C. C. J. Barrett, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persiaii Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. Relative merits of Kuwait and Bahrain as Headquarters of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Sir, I have the honour to reply as follows to the inquiry in your telegram No. 2481 S., dated the 14th August 1929.Kuwait. Baiikain. 1. Political. (1) The location of the Residency at Kuwait will enhance the prestige oi the Principality, showing that ilia Majesty's Government intend to support the inde pendence of Kuwait against both Iraq and ibn Saud, whose policy is to acquire it as it is the natural port of northern Najd. Owing to the constant corning and going oi' Kajd Bedouin to and from the town, Kuwait is in closer touch with Najd politics than Bahrain, whose insular position renders it more unapproachable for the desert dweller. (2) Kuwait's proximity to Iraq facilitates relations with the High Com missioner for Iraq and joint discussion of Arab problems. In Kuwait the Resident would also be in close touch with the situation in Najd and in proximity to the Royal Air Force, on whom he has to lely for the defence of the town. This is a distinct advantage in times of stress though of much less value in normal times. 1 have myself found it difficult recently to control affairs from Bushire, and have twice visited Kuwait for consultations. (3) Close liaison with British authorities in Khuzistan, but decrease of touch with Persian coast south of Bushire. (1) On tiie other hand, although the interest of I lis Majesty's Government at Bahrain is already clearly shown, it will be absolutely necessary for His Majesty's (Government to be represented by an official of the highest rank in the Gulf if American oil interests obtain a footing in the Gulf and are possessed of the powers granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate iu their Concession of 1925. (2) Bahrain attracts at intervals all the rulers of the Gulf, who come either to receive hospitality from the rich Shaikhs of Bahrain or to receive medical attention at its famous American hospital, which is better known and closer to their homes than that of Kuwait. The presence of these rulers affords opportunities for the establishment and maintenance by the Political Resident of personal relations with them. I ^y great stress on the accessibility of the Resident, who should know the Shaikhs personally. It is for this reason that I recommend frequent tours by him along the Trucial Coast and to Muscat. I his is one of the chief reasons for preferring Bahrain to Kuwait. (3) Owing to their visits to Bahrain, maintenance of touch with Shaikhs of Persian coast south of Bushire, which is mainly peopled by men of Arab blood. 2. Commercial. Kuwait is a large Bedouin town and Bahrain is the commercial capital of the natural port of northern Najd. the Gulf and the centre of the pearl trade, on which the Arabs of the Gulf live. Ir! is the entrepot for Hasa and southern Najd. 3. Situation. Kuwait is at the extreme northern end Bahrain is in the centre of the Gulf, of the Gulf, at one extremity of the which saves 24 hours' steaming when Resident's charge. visiting the Trucial Coast and Oman. (See 1 above.) 4. Communications. (1) Owing to the proximity of Basrah, communication w r ith the outer world by sea, air, and motor-car is easier than at Bahrain, but if the Residency were in Kuwait the fast Gulf mail should call weekly both on the inward and outward voyage. (1) Visits by the fast Gulf mail both on the inward and outward voyage would be essential if the Residency were in Bahrain until the perfection of the Air Mail rendered this unnecessary.Kuwait. Bahrain. (2) Telegraphic communication, how ever, is only by a single land line to Basrah, which is liable to be cut at any time bv raiders. (2) Bahrain has the best flying boat harbour in the Gulf, more protected than that at Kuwait. Its aerodrome has probably a better surface than that at Kuwait and is secure from hostile attack, whereas that at Kuwait, which is outside the town wall, is more open to attack. With the development of air communi cation, Bahrain and not Kuwait w r ill be the Gulf centre of airways. The present superiority of Kuwait in the matter of communications with the outside world will then vanish. (.H) Telegraphic communication, through the Indo-European Telegraph Department Wireless Telegraph Station, is less liable to wilful interruption. If the Wireless Telegraph Station at Bushire is handed over, Bahrain can work Basrah direct, but the danger of jamming and atmos pherics has to be considered. 5. Climate. Provided a really suitable Residency is built the climate is preferable to that of Bahrain. C. Accommodation House rent for the staff would probably be a little cheaper than that at Bahrain. No temporary accommodation available for ilie Resident. As at Kuwait, a permanent building would have to be erected, but Shaikh Hamad would probably lease or sell temporary quarters for the Residency. 7. Water Snpphj. Drinking water is brought by boat from Fao. Well water for washing, &lt;?i'c., is scarce and very brackish, and consequently no gardens are possible. The water of Bahrain is not drunk by Europeans although the American missionaries use it. It is probably whole some, but it has a bad taste. Ample water for washing and gardening. 8. Amenities. (1) No European society, a few American missionaries, a conservative type of Arab. power plant and another (2) Except for a small possessed by the Shaikh worked by the American missionaries for their own use, there is no electric power plant nor ice factory in Kuwait. (3) Depressing scenery owing to the absence of trees or verdure. (4) No roads, nor can they beconstructed owing to the loose, sandy nature of the soil, though it is possible for motor-cars to pass over certain areas. (5) European stores and similar con veniences not available locally. (O) No facilities for recreation. (1) More progressive people and con sequently more of the amenities of civilisation, including a small European society, likely to increase with the advent of Oil Company's employes. (2) Facilities for electric power and plant exist and will be more satisfactory next year when the State scheme is in operation. (3) Ample trees and verdure owing to good soil in the vicinity and the abundance of water. A good garden can be made even in the Agency compound on the sea shore. (-1) Good roads, though of short length. and conveniences (5) Most stores available locally. (0) Some facilities for recreation exist.2. I am not afraid of Bahrain being swamped by a Western flood if the Resident goes there. For reasons which I am giving in a separate report that 1 will send you shortly, I am of opinion that we should not recede from onr present position in Bahrain, especially if American oil interests obtain what may, if not properly controlled, be a strangle-hold on the island. 3. To sum up, Bahrain is preferable as the headquarters of the purely Gulf Residency, but Kuwait commands a wider outlook into general Arab politics. I recommend headquarters at Bahrain, but would reserve accommodation at Kuwait, which the Political Resident could use for considerable periods in time of stress. At present the cramped and dilapidated Agency renders it impossible for the Resident to visit Kuwait for more than a day or two for a hurried consultation, as it is only at extreme inconvenience to himself that the Political Agent can find him room. 1 hope it will be possible to remedy this state of affairs in the new Agency that is being built, although it would be preferable in every way that there should be a Circuit House that the Resident could occupy independent of the Agency. 4. I have discussed the subject from the point of view of to-day. I do not think, however, that the development of aircraft will modify my observations to any considerable extent. I have, &amp;c., C. C.
