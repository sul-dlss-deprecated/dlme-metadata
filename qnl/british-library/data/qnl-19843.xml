There are continual com plaints of delays and many suits are dropped out of sheer despair of any result. His Highness the Sultan has been repeatedly urged to expedite Justice. A considerable improvement is ex pected when the English adviser arrives. If it was not for the unremitting efforts of the Agency Dragoman it is doubtful if any cases would ever be finished. I^future it will be advisable to hear certain special cases in iiuttrah to avoid the delay and expence caused by bringing over lar^e numbers of witnesses to Muscat. The services of an Arabic clerk, as has been urged in my 2082 of let November 1919 are absolutely necessary to enable the Dragoman not only to cope with the Judicial work but to attend to his Political work which is infinitely more important. At present he is immobilised by a mass of petitions, registeringend copying documents, attending the kahkumah for hours on end etc#, I hope thip assiBtance will 'be available shortlyo The amount of fees recovered was Rs.2162-10-0^ As far es possible cases are settled without litigation under Article 10 of the Order and as previously reported a considerable amount of time of the Court is taken ud with cases which do not appear in the above lists. 1051 petitions in connection with legal cases were received during the year, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

Sir, I have the honour to submit hereunder the report required under Article 85 of the Muscat Order in Council on the working of the Order in the year &gt;921. The 'igures are given in a different for. to that former ly employed which gave a somewhat misleading impression of the working of the order# The practice is for all civil proceedings to be initiated by petition stamped with a Court fee stamp of one anna or of eight annas according as it relates to matter of less than H s»30 value or more* in cases between British subjects or protegees the par ses to the dispute are brought before the Political Agent -ho proceeds under Art..o of the Order in Council to try to secure agreement by consent, if the petitioner appears to have no case he is told so. and it is left to him to bring a regular Civil Suit or not as he pleases, xf h e app ears to have a good case which the defendant win not admit he is ad- visedadvised to bring a regC^ar ClvU Suit. In the majority of InatanoeB however cases are settied In this way. These oases I have as iiiisc©Han6oufl civil proc06d.lngs l^QtweQn tish subjects. Claims by Arab subjects against British subjects or pro tegees are dealt with In general accord with the provisions o the Code of Civil Procedure. No fees are charged as the iiuscat Courts charge no fees. These proceedings I have des cribed as Arab Suits against British subjects. British claims against Arab subjects are described as such. These claims do not cause much work to the Political Agent but take up a good deal of the time of the Dragoman. iigur-ss relating to the various proceedings are ae follows CRlmlnal Actinna- Pending from previous year N1]L Instituted djirlng the year 1 5 Nil - V. v ^ ^ o 2nded in conviction , Withdrawn Pending at close of year Resuiar Civil S.^t-a .

It will 'be noticed that the heading Hiscellaneous Civil Proceedings 'between British subjects has disappeared,such cases being merged under the general heading of British subjects versus British subjects* These Miscella neous Civil Proceedings v/ere apparently cases put before the Political Agent, and referred by him to a Punchayat» If parties like to settle their cases out of Court by private arbitration or other means without involving the aid of the Court, that is their own affair. But if the aid of the Court is involved, whether the Political Agent chooses to try these cases entirely himself, or with the aid of a Punchayat (iruscat Order in Council Section 37), it seems only in order that such cases should be treated as regular suits. 3. This does not mean that punchayats have in any way been eliminated. On the contrary their work has been systematized. increased and nd - their status raised. It had been the custom for a new punchayat to be formed for every case#. This led to delay in the disposal of cases. In the latter half of the year, with the approval of the Hon'ble the Political Resident* a British Standing Punchayat composed of 6 members chosen by the ^ritish Indian communities of I'uscat, (Hindus, Ithna-asharis (Shias), Agha Khanis and Sunni T^slims), was instituted by the Political Agent. This Punchayat^of which 4 form a quorum, meets regularly twice a month, in the Agency, and considerable activity in the settlement of Punchayat cases has been effected. Its members in the first instance are chosen for 6 months, at the end of which period fresh members can be elected. 4. Tith the approval of the Political Resident and with the collaboration of the Council of Ministers a TTixed Standing punchayat, meeting twice a month, composed of 6 members - 3 Kuscati and 3 British subjects - 5 to form a quorum - was also established to assist the rahkamah (Muscat State Court) in the disposal of4 ^ _ British versus 1'uscati caees».-Th.e British rnenibers 'v^ere chosen by the Political Ajent *. their tenure^ 'beingr - three months#. The T ;r ahlccLriia.h. had heen in the haljit o- re - rin^ certain cases to Punchayats, but by foriring a nev^ Punchayat for each case# The establishment of a Standing punchayat meeting at regular intervals has - as in the case of the British Punchayat - le^a to more expedition in the settlement of c.ases» To this Punchayat the Political Ajent can also refer for in opinion cases of I'uscati versus British subjects 5» In order to expedite further the settlement of British versus 7'Uscati cases, in which ^reat delay v»as being experienced, the Council was asked by the Political Agent, with the approval of the Political Resident, to appoint an Assistant Judge to help the Minister of Justice, who single- handed had had to deal with all the work of the Fahksmah in addition to many other vzaxk duties^ The Assistant Judge was duly appointed, deals with minor civil cases up to Hs»50/- - as far es British versus Tuscatis are concerned, and has been instrumental in helping to reduce the long list of unsettled cases for which British Indian subjects were waiting decision* 6» It may be as well to explain the fact that the extension and systematizing of the Punchayc-t system in no way meens that the Political Agent shifts his responsibi lities on the shoulders of the Punchoyats*- T n the : irst place, thou, h under the Tuscat Order in Council, section 37, the Political Agent is at liberty in coamercicl cises C o m, jt ^' Y €. (7 /hich u on i i ' pbi about nine-tenth of the local litigation), to ask the Punchayat for a decision , in practice all that he fsks for is an opinion , which he can over-rule or. not as he thinks fit* In the second jlc-ce, in order to ensure that the Punchayat should know exactly on what points their opinion is required, end that the parties should know on what points they h^ve to produce evidence, thethe Politicei A^ent firet exa .inee the parties to r &gt;arrow down- the e:-act iesjues on which they c.re at variance, and it is these issues which are put to the Punchx -yat for the parties concerned to ar^ue^ finally the parties are called before the Political A^ent to give their arguments - if any - a, ainst the opinion of the Funchayats, and it is not until their arguments are he^rd that the Political A^ent ^ ives his Jua ^nient*. 7. The formation of these Standing puncheyats, simple as it may appear, was something in the nature of an innovation, and innovations in a conservative piece like Muscat are not to 'be lightly undertaken* By the time various details connected v .ith their establishment^ had been settled, and they themselves were fairly under wei^h, the year was well advanced# Thus the result of their establishment is not as apparent in the year under review as would otherwise had been the case, and the conclusion of 1931 must be awaited before the full results of this experiment can be Judged# 8» That the Punchaya'6s/filQ. a very useful role cannot be denied -iSaxacfc-. ^irst,,^ and most important, they- - under the control of the Political Agent - help to administer the law for British Indian subjects in a way that is indigenous to the country India, from which these subjects come - the very word punchayat is of course of Indian origin* Afc every community is represented no party^ in the unfortunate position of receiving an adverse .opinion^ can say he was not represented on the 'bench* pronouncing this opinion, and moreover he can always adduce what arguments he likes against this opinion in the final hearing before-the Political Agent- The proviso that the members of the Punchay; ts can be changed at certain intervals is likewise a useful one* As fsr as a, can be judged indeed the Punchayats are^popular institu tion*!s&gt; institution^ Only one complaint was received, an anonymous— petition to the effect that cases were settled too quickly, and thus debtors-a^inst whom decisions were given - were with h^rd put isyubt to keep their heods above water! complaints that the law moves too quickly are not common, and this petition may be taken as a somewhat naive tribute -o the extra activity which the new Funchayat system has introduced into the Tr uEcat Courts.. 9» T n point of fact it is in^temporing the wind to the shorn la-ib w , and protecting; the honeet debtor/ fallen on evil days that the Punchiyats do a useful work. Trade conditions are very bad, and much poverty exists, 'Kany merchants, shopkeepers, etc. are forced into the Court through no fault of their own, and to insist upon uj-1 pay ment of their debts immediately y /ould be to drive the majority into bankruptcy, which would of course bring benefits to no one. The Punchayats^arej of course, better informed as to the status pf local traders than the Political Agent, ^nd one of the questions frequently put by the latter is in whit instalments can the debtor pay off his debt? 10. Another useful function performed by the Punchayats is in the examination of the lon^ and often complicated, eeries of accounts - frequently written in Gujarati or Ehojki - which litigants produce to prove, or rebut, claims. It would be quite impo^Bible for the Political A^ent;who has many other cl&amp;ims upon his attention, to spare the uime for elucidating these documents himself without assistance. 11. The Punchayats also act as a board of conciliation, thus carrying out the wise advice given in section 10 of the Tliscat Or^er in Council, A number of cases referred to V / them by the Political Agent come back with the welcome remark that an amicable sett/lement has been aranged between the parties.Criinlna l 12. Of criminal matters Happily there is little to sty. Though the carrying of rifles is not fortidden, and a dagger is worn as a matter of course hy any Muscati subject who o»n afford to Uuy one, violent crime is very rare and in this respect Tiuscst can show an example to &lt;Sny other , una^.'lea , towns in other countries, lone of the criminal oases, either of British versus British, British versus Muscat1, or luscati versus British, were of a serious nature. The severest sentence given was three months imprisonment and Hs.20C/- fine In cj - bc of mistppropriation. Gvtf adur. 13.

The composition and duties of these Punchayats and the advantages gained by this institution, were fully dealt with in the last Report. It was remarked that 'The ioriaation of these Standing Punchayats, simple as it way appear, w^.s scmtthing in th.e nauure oi an innovation, and innovations in a conservative place lijce Muscat are not to be lightly unaertaken. By the time various details connected with their establishment had been settled, and they themselves were fairly under wei^h, the year was v. ell advanced. Thus the result of their establishment is not as apparent in the year under review as would otherwise have been the case, and the conclusion of x93i must be awaited before the full results of this experiment can be judged' 1 . 4. It is satisfactory to note that judging by results the Punchayats have been a success. Their woricing is particularly noticeable in the improvement in the disposal of British versus Muscat! Suits which have suifered from inordinate delays, deplored by various Political iigents. Part of the Court's increased efficiency shown by the Muscat State Courts is also due to the reforms lately instituted in them, vide para 5 of last year's Report. The number of British versus4.

Remarks, h( (3&gt; 4. There is little thot calls for comment in this year's report. The working of the regular Panchoyats continued to be most satisfactory# The number of cases Kuscati versus British pending at the end of the year would appear to 'be somewhat high but the majority of these have since been finally disposed of. Estate proceedings also show a high percentage of pending cases. Owing to the wide distribution of ***** persons connected with many of these cases considerable cs. diff iculty^^xperienced in bringing them to a more rapid termination. In spite of the critical financial and trade conditions ^ prevailing throughout the year the number of petitions for insolvency is not as high as might have been expected. '^hese adverse conditions have had however a very marked effect in the recovery of decree money, but amenability on the part of decree holders, combined with firm but gentle pressure and persuaSion, has generally effected settleiicnt without inordinate delay. In conclusion it may be stated that the willingness with which litigants approach the Court for the settlement of divers kinds of disputes, is an indication of the confidence that both British and Muscat subjects repose in the Political Agent's Court where they find that they can obtain early redress at little cost, and justice tempered with mercy.

Remarks. The working of the regular panchayats was satisfactory although several cases had to be returned to them to re-study issues that were put to them. in accordance with the stipulation of the Order in council that litigation should be discouraged as far as possible, the personal influence of the Political ^igent has been directed to prevailing on parties to compose their quarrels out of Courts. Although this has in no way lessened the demand on the time and patience of the Political itgent, the results have been eminently satisfactory. The chaotic conditions prevailing in the local Courts, where Babel rei-ns and settlements are rarely achieved, have driven many non-British subjects to seek the redress in the Court of the rolitical iigent on false pretences, ouch applications have necessarily been refused. Certainly neither justice nor speedy settlements can be expected at the nanus of the Miscat magistracy. The work of the oourt Dragoman in dealing with several chestfuls of ancient Court files that were accidentally brought to light in a dilapidated godov/n merits considerable praise, entailing as it did hours of extra work wading through unrecorded cases, in some instances fifty years old. These old records have now been successfully dealt with and a fresh system of satisfactory filing is shortly to be instituted. I have the honour to be, air.

Remarlcs. Civil litigation during the year showed a considerable decrease from the previous year in all three categories^ i.e., .British versus -oritish, British versus muscatis and nuscatis versus British. The greatest number of cases instituted were by British subjects against Muscatis, but in the majority of these cases the amounts involved were very trifling sums and speedy settlement was thus easy of attainment. Criminal cases show a slight increase ^of three) over the previous year, but although these occupied a considerable amount of the Courtis time, the cases were of a nature normally to be expected and no cases remained pending at the close of the year. Estate proceedings and insolvency proceedings presented some difficulty, chiefly owing to the wide dispersion of jroperty and parties over both Kiuscat territory cind xndia. m certain cases which are still pending, consideraole was taken progress has been made and lull opportunitythe ^ourt s recess in India to prosecute enquiry into the claims of parties now resident in india. The working of the regular Panchayat has continued to be satisfactory although from time to time they are inclined to shirk issues and to procrastinate. The abnormal climatic conditions prevailing during the yaacx hot weather was undoubtedly a contributory cause to this defect. The energies of the Jfolitical Agent have been largely directed towards persuading parties to compose their quarrels and disputes out of Court. These efforts have met with a gre^ measure of success, but, none the less, they have occupiea a considerable portion of his time and patience - 'Solutions' thus arrived at however appear to have excellent results and much of the bitterness accruing from litigation has been happily eliminated.The large increase in Court fees is attributable to the elimination of various stratagems whereby, in the past, parties have sought to avoid the payment of correct dues. Great credit is due to the ^ourt Dragoman, to whose meticulous scrutiny and untiring efforts this profitable result is largely due. The large increase of registrations this year (and consequent doubling of fees) is the outcome of a 'Mrive' to ensure that as far as possible no British subject or British Protected Person avoided registration. The measures taken entailed much extra labour but were fully justified by results. /\gain, great credit is due to the ©ragoman, who in his capacity as registration clerk, showed unflagging zeal and patience in dealing with would-be defaulters. i have the honour to be.

Tiiere was a aiignt increase during the year in CiTii jbitigation in the category of British versus British and a considerable increase in the categories of British versus Muscatis and Muscatis versus British compared with iy35. m all three categories the great majority of the cases were of a petty nature and were speedily disposed of/. Most of the 25 cases which remained pending were instituted during the close of the year when the Political Agent was absent from headquarters on special duty. There was a slight increase during the year in criminal cases in the categories of British versus Muscatis and Muscatis versus British, but none of these were for serious crimes, in these categories four cases remained unsettled, as they were instituted late in the year and could not be dealt with owing to the political Agent's sicJmess. instate Proceedings . These proceedings owing to the peculiar conditions prevailing in Muscat are generally difficult to deal with. i'our fresh proceedings were instituted during the year and two pending from 1^35 were settled. insolvency Proceedings . One new proceeding was instituted during the year, une pending from 1^35 was settled and progress made with the remainder. Panchayats . The two ranchayats- both British and Mixed- continued to be of considerable assistance in Civil cases. i have the honour to be, Sir, ^our most obedient servant. iV GHD. ^■aj or, Political Agent &amp; H.B.ll's Consul,Muscat.From To No. 234/125 of l9l'38. v' Major H.i-,Watts, i.A. , Political Agent and H.
