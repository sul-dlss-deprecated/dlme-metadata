I * Sy ‘ U- ^ ^ ^ Aden Besideney, -7th danuary 1911&gt;. I lia\(‘ the honour to forward, with reference to my telegram Xo. ibT * &gt;,r ^ January 19Id, an interesting report of Lieutenant-Colonel H. K Jacob, first Assistant Resident, on his visit, as my representative, to tin* Idrisi. I have forwarded copies of the report and of this letter direct to foreign Department, l)elhi, Mis Britannic Majesty’s High Commissioner, * airo, and His Majesty s Secn'tary of State ior India. The Idrisi welcomed Lieutenant-t olonel Jacob and the officers who accompanied him most cordially, and I am confident that the mission and the reciprocation of views will bear good results. The clauses of our 'Trade Policy were fully discussed seriatim. 1 am glad to say that the idrisi is in accord with the terms of the policy, which are given in the accompanying Schedule. I trust they will meet with approval. '■&gt;. I was desirous of the question of trade between Idrisi ports and Jeddah being discussed, in which connection the Southern Red Sea Patrol has experienced some difficulty in controlling dhow traffic. The reasons being that while our Policy prohibits dhows plying between ports in this Administration and ports on the Southern Red Sea coast line, and while control has been assured over such traffic from Somaliland, French, and Italian ports, yet it does not interfere with dhows from ports in the Northern Red Sea area, including Jeddah, trading with Idrisi ports, and under which pretence there is little doubt they run their goods into enemy ports. It was known, also, that the Idrisi was embarrassed by this exemption, as facilities were afforded to his own dhows to smuggle goods into enemy ports lying towards Jeddah. This question was discussed, therefore, and it is noticed that the Idrisi appreciates the advantages, generally, of prohibiting this trade, ft would seem that his apparent objection to its cessation is based on material grounds, affecting tin* interests of Ids people in depriving them of a source of cheaper grain. In the circumstances it is advisable to drop the matter. 1. The export of kerosine oil to Medi has been engaging my attention for some time. We have reduced consignments from Aden to within reasonable limits. The French and Italian authorities have met my representations and requests on this matter in a cordial spirit. I have addressed, also, the High Commissioner, Egypt, in connection with this export trade from ports in the Northern Red Sea area. 5. I am not in favour, at present, of exempting any of the enemy ports from the restrictions imposed by the trade Policy. We have experienced some disappointment already in this respect. From all information I have received the Arabs lay all the blame for their troubles upon the Turks andnot upon the British. It is well to foster this feeling. It is fairly certain also, that the Turks will reap the benefit of such exemptions especially at Hodeida. Moreover, by exempting certain ports, blockade-running activities would start afresh, and as a natural consequence the labours of the Southern Patrol would increase south of the Idrisi coast line where dhow trad in o- k now well under control. G. The Idrisi’s request to assist one Saiyid Ahmed al Bahr of Huseniva will receive consideration. It should have a good effect to accede to it. His desire for the presence of Saiyid Mustafa lias been cabled to the High Commissioner, Egypt. 7. Lieutenant-Colonel Jacob recommends a decoration of Knighthood to be bestowed by Government on the Idrisi. Personally I think the honour now would be premature. 8. The Idrisi’s favourable comments on Commander (Taufurd R.X.. will be communicated to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, Egypt, through the Senior Naval Ollicer, Aden. 9. 1 am indebted to Lieutenant-Colonel Jacob for the ability and tact with which he has conducted the Mission. He is a Political Officer of wide knowledge and experience of this country and a talented Arabic scholar. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, (Signed) 0. II. U.

As represfiiitative cl' tlie Political Uesident, Aden. I arrived in HALS. Mmto. (’oinmander Craidurd, U.S., at dezan, at 12.M0 noon on Oth Jnslant. 1 was accompanied by Colonel Wanhope, C.B., CAhC., 0.1.IC, ILL., who sought topographical infonnation, and Major Bradshaw, Oeneral S^tall Ctfieer, who came to discover the iniliiary situation The Political Lesidf'ut s letter ol introduction was taken ashore, and later m the dav Muhammad bin Saliva Ba Sain, the Idrisi s Wa/.ir, came aboard to give us welcome and to tender sheep and fowls as a present from the Idrisi. lie smd his master would see us after dark and on shore. I found that this manceuvie was due to the Idrisi s desire to disarm Ids people s prepidiee against the ioreigner. 1 remarked that the whole countrvside knew of the treaty between the Idrisi and British Covernment and the elose nexus and friendship existing and proved by the monopoly given to the Idrisi qua opening of Ids ports alone to tralhc from Aden, Djibouti, Massawa, and Asab. It is a commonplace that this preferential treatment has greatly enhanced the Idrisi s prestige and importance in the Arab world. Karlier in the war certain of the Idrisi s tribesmen, it is said, were averse to his lighting the lurks, and although now the l urk has fallen in Arab estima tion, the Idrisi thought it better not to deal too openly with non-Moslems lost the old feeling lor the lurks should be re-awakened. Again, the role of the Idrisi is a priestly one and too great a familiarity with us might lie misinterpreted. To tell the truth, the Idrisi feared loss of caste. It is a fact, however, that during his pact with Italy, no Italian officers were allowed to land on Idrisi sod, and before our arrival at Jezan, the only privileged person to land had been Commander Craufurd of HALS. Minlo on two occasions. For the same reasons the Idrisi would not board the Minto. \\ e got ashore after (i.-T) p.m., when two or three officials met us and conducted us to a house hard by, where upstairs in an anteroom the Idrisi met us standing, and after salutations conducted us to an inner room where, himself seated on a couch, he gave us places on chairs each side. (The party included Commander Craufurd, R.N., who was there to watch naval interests). His Wazir, Ba Said, w'as in attendance. This Minister will not allow his master to discuss matters except in his presence. 1 have known Ba Sahi for several years, and have met him often in Aden. My impression is that the Idrisi depends on his advice and judgment. The Idrisi himself told me that all maritime and shipping affairs were in Ba Sabi's hands; that he himself managed affairs inland. All through the interview, which lasted three hours, the Idrisi constantly turned to his Minister to seek corroboration of his views, and on many a subject broached he would say “ For this, please deal with Ba Sahi.” 1 had an opportunity after the interview to talk a few minutes alone with the Idrisi. I asked him if Ba Sahi were not serving his own interests rather than his master’s, lie replied rather dubiously and asked if I had any suspicion. He assorted that Ba Sahi was a good man. I quoted the tradition “A1 Mustashar Mu’taman,” i.c., “It is incumbent to trust one whose advice you seek.” The Idrisi felt relieved and said these were his sentiments. I shall touch on Ba Sahi again later. Soul Ur ni lied Sea Patrol Policy .—I discussed the revised Red Sea patrol policy of 7th December 1014. The Idrisi asked that Khor al Birik (and not Ras Turfa) be regarded as the northern limit of his coastal area for trade and Habl as the southerly point, though he claims that his territory extends from I lab Point to Buhes, a little south of Habl. The trade between ports in this area lie considers a most valuable asset to secure the goodwill of his maritime subjects. He was confident that no supplies could reachthe Turks from any of his ports, though he recognist-d the possihiiity of smuggling goods to places on shore between his ports and asked lor a closer naval patrol to check it. As for the possibility of the Furasan group being a hiding ground for Turkish dhows and specie-running, the idrisi said this was not likely. 'These islands were frequented by his pearl fishing boats only. I'radc with Jeddah.- \ touched on Jeddah trade and pointed out how easv it was for enemv dhows to run the blockade 1 and pul in eti ionic at such dangerous places as Kontidha and lath. This lie replied was the role of naval vigilance to detect, lie said he did not send dhows to deddah, lor he himself feared his men might improve the occasion to trade with enemy ports. As for trade from deddah, it certainly took place. 'These dhows brought grain. I said that we would supply him from Aden to a greater extent than at present, which in accordance with his request was up to 1,000 bags per mensem, lie said he could not stop this trade liom Jethkin, but thought we might do so if we could: at the same time such rest riot ions would be unpalatable to his people since deddah grain sold cheaper in his ports than that supplied from Aden ! N.B.—Personally 1 think it impolitic to stop this Jeddah trade because— (1) It is highlv politic not to break tin 1 link between Jeddah and Idrisi ports which has an important and a potentially political value. 2) Jeddah is open to India, Soudan, Ac., and to close 1 it to Idrisi would very properly engender suspicion. 13 ) deddah is sacrosanct and a so-called neutral port. 4) Jeddah is pre-eminently Arab and our policy has been to exclude Arabs as the butt of our hostilities. ■ o) Such policy will enhance prices and this will be unpopular to our friPiuls The one object achieved by detaching Jeddah would be the extra facility given to the naval patrols who are watching the coast. This advantage can be discounted in view of the many disadvantages of closing Jeddah to the Idrisi. Idrisi and l^orcKjn Trade .—Trade from Djibouti, Alassawa and Asab Comes now in dhows via Kamaran to Meidi. I he question of return trade to these ports was touched upon at the interview. Such trade is inevitable, though not broached in the revised policy. The Idrisi, in a recent letter to his Aden Agent, said he would ask the Political Pesident of Aden to reconsider the question of reopening the dhow traflic between his ports and Aden. He did not touch on this subject before me and 1 thought it unwise to mention it. The Idrisi clearly saw at the interview that the less trade there was by dhows passing along an enemy coast the better, and I do not think he will bring up the question of dhow trade with Aden unless forced by Ba Said A Co. In this circumstance, I think it wise to acquiesce in the return trade by these dhows from Meidi to the three above-mentioned foreign ports of the African coast more especially that the Idrisi remarked that many of tin 1 Arab importers of Meidi and Jezan were Italian subjects of Massawa and Asab. This trade from the foreign parts of African side largely increases our naval patrol’s vigilance. We cannot, however, stop it without offending our French and Italian friends, who already have met the Resident s wishes by con siderably cutting down the How of kerosine oil and also by limiting the number of dhows plying per mensem. In my opinion, if I may digress a moment, this question ol restricted food supplies, while it has enhanced enormously the Idrisi s reputation—a no inconsiderable asset to us—has by this very fact of an acquired monopoly added to the Idrisi s embarrassment and responsi bility. I am sure he values the distinction conferred on his ports, but he must at times feel that he is suspected of passing on supplies, which, though destined 1 believe lor Arab Iriends, must find their way partiv into Turkish camps. It is only, however, partly so, for, as the Idrisi told me, the vast supplies that are going to Meidi, and have raised Meidi to the status of a large town.I a ai\i used by him to conciliate both his own outlying tribesmen, with manv of whom the Imam lias Ion' been tampering, and also tribes of reputed neutrality outside the province of Asir. Kcroslnc Oil. — This applies in a large measure to the supplies of kerosiue oil, a commodity which, if meant solely for the Idrisi tribesmen’s particular use, is being shipped to Meidi far in excess of local requirements. It has been said that Arabs do not use this oil, but this is quite erroneous. Kven if the supplies imported into Meidi do in part find a Turkish military market the 1 urks are not in Mich great numbers to derive a marked advantage. I he Imam’s country supplies a large quota of supplies to the Turkish Arabs arrayed against the Idrisi forces in the neighbourhood of Lohaiya. To carry out our original policy of favouring the Arab to wean him from the I urk, it might not be unsound to allow the supply of goods to many a port, which though styled enemy is really peopled by Arabs who loathe the 1 urks. Ilodeida especially is in a very bad way and many Arabs have died then 4 of starvation. In this way trade would be stimulated, Arabia pleased, the British name popularised, as it was when Jeddah and Mecca were freely supplied, in spite of Turkish forces present in the llejaz. Again, the work of the Southern Naval patrol would be made lighter and the ships would pay attention rather to the shipping of arms, ammunition, and specie. Relative to tin 4 importance of separating Arab from Turk the Idrisi asked if we wotdd allow an occasional dhow to go from Aden or from Meidi to Al Taif (a Zcranik port) with supplies from one Saiyid Ahmed al Bahr, an influential man living inland at Iluseniya. The Zeranik, he said, wen 4 largely pro-Turk but favour shown to so prominent a Saiyid would be far- reaching. “ What you sow to-day, you will to-morrow reap,’’ he said. This is another instance of tin 4 Idrisi’s plan of reconciling the Arabs. Port Clearances to Idrisi Choirs. With regard to tin 4 issue by him of Port Clearances to his dhows the Idrisi was in full agreement. 1 explained to him the details these papers should show and emphasized the importance of a flag-paper to be carried by every dhow flying his flag. He has given me a drawing and wants a seal made for him. Supplies to Turks.- The Idrisi assured me that no supplies were sent through his country to the Turks. Kunfidha, he admitted, was the port selected by the enemy, and from there they went to Abha, the capital of Asir, where the Turks were stationed. Kuntidha, Lohaiya and Khoba were tin 4 ports the Naval patrols should especially watch. Firinij on ll.M.S. lAinka's Jioals. I spoke to him of the two affairs a little south of Jezan where the Lanka chased dhows carrying specie, the crew landing and firing on the warship’s beats. 'The Idrisi referred me to Ba Sahi, but remarked that the coast line between his ports was not safe, and a good deal of smuggling was done there by enemy craft. The Idrisi had arrested Said Musa’id the Sheikh of Al Habl, on suspicion of corre sponding with the enemy at Hodeidah, but after a time released him as nothing could bo proved. Idrisi's animus against Turks. —I was very much impressed with Idrisi’s animosity against tin 4 'Turks which I am sure is genuine. He acknowledged a mission from Enver Pasha before the war, but he could no longer trust Turkish promises or Turkish faith. At the beginning of the war, when the Turks were brought into the arena, the Idrisi said that public .opinion in Asir was in sympathy with them as Moslems, but now the aspect was changing. He, the Idrisi, was glad the Turks had espoused the (lerman cause, for tin’s had weakened Arab respect for Turkey, since the Germans were distrusted as fighting for purposes of self-aggrandisement; they were faithless and unscrupulous, and 'Turkey was blamed for throwing in her lot with them. He was confident the Allies would win in the long run, but seemed apprehensive lest a peace be concluded which would leave the 'Turks in possession of their present territories in Arabia. He asked about the Dardanelles especially, but recognised the strength opposite us there. S. 29N. Itc Idrisi Mililaru Movement*. —J asked him what ht‘ was actually doing with the enemy in his immediate frontier. As regards Lohaiya he said he lacked guns to cope with the Turks and Arabs there, if. he took Lohaiya—and the opposition of the Bani dami tribe was a neglible quantity—he would become the target of a strong advance movement of Turks and Arabs aided by imam Yahya. who he declared was actually aiding tile Turks with stippiies and men. lie uro-ed me to get him ammunition for his guns and he gave .Major Bradshaw some specimen shells which perhaps can be had from captures made in Egypt and Mesopotamia. The Idrisi was very pleased with Government’s generosity in presenting him so much rifle ammunition, but his inactivity on this front is due to lack of gun ammunition. The Turkish positions on this front are strongly fortified. The Idrisi remarked he was holding up the enemy here who otherwise would be at Lahej. Turkish I)eserfers. —Vnny Turkish deserters had come in from Asir and from Sanaa, and were loafing about de/an and Meidi. Two of them a Turk and an Arab—he handed over to us for conduct to Aden. He showed us a box of dynamite, which he allirmed had been brought down to Jezan to destroy his house there, fdrisi’s treatment of deserters seemed lenient. I gathered this was due to Arab sentiment towards Moslems. Idnsi s ] J olilteal Movements. — I he Idrisi seemed politically very active in conciliating the tribesmen. He had just received a deputation of 200 Asir tribesmen in Jezan. He was treating with the people of Ghamid also. Hash id II a lUtkil.—'\ he 1,000 rifles he requires from Djibouti lie intends to give to his tribesmen Hijal al Ma, who inhabit his northern limit He was coquetting with the powerful tribes of Hashid wa Bakil, who I ‘hear from other reliable sources are dissatisfied with the Imam's meanness.

Ho was particularly Iriendly to us and spoke l.'ighly of the British ( Jovern- nient and their attitude to the Moslem world. He struck me as markedly intelligent, as is natural, looking to his upbringing and education at A1 Azhar. He is, as befitting his position as head of the Ahmediya tarika, an intenseh leligious man, and spends much of his time in religious exercises. He moves about but little m the daytime and conducts most of his business at night. S/k i/Ji nj '/ezdD.-- 1 he Sheikh of *Jezan, one Hin Xanun, is a most agree- able old man and very friendly to our warships when they call. S/wildt Muhammad Yehiya P,a Said.-A have already said that all maritime and commercial matters are left to Ba Sahi. This is mentioned by Military Intelligence, Cairo, in his Secret telegram E.B. .‘127, dated 29th December If)lb. His partner, Ba Zubeir, lives at Meidi, and these two control the How of supplies in various directions. Ba Sahi is no lover of the Turks. I think his unique position and the estimation in which he is held by the Idrisi makes him a natural butt for the criticisms of the envious. M e have long suspected Ba Sahi to be working for his own private ends, and he is doubtless a wealthy mar.. It is not feasible to contrive his removal. Nothing has so far been proved of Ba Sabi's nefarious acts. Honours lo Idrisi. -l will sum up this already lengthy report by pressing the importance of assisting the Idrisi by every means possible, with guns and by largesse, to impress the tribesmen. I believe it to be a sound investment. I would further suggest he be decorated by Government with a Knighthood. This honour would encourage him and elicit better work. A religious title might, however, be more greatly esteemed. Commander Cranfurd, P.\. —Finally, I would eulogise the excellent work, great tact and affability towards the Arabs displayed by Commander Oraufurd, B.X., who is very popular in those parts, and who with the Officers of his Ship has been for so long a time in a trying climate and very difficult waters. The Idrisi spoke highly of this Officer, the first one privileged to land on Idrisi soil. II. 17th January 1910. II. F. Jacoh, Tdcutenant-Colonel. First Assistant Resident, Aden.8 No. C. S3.

All Southern Red Sea Arabian ports are closed for trade with the following exception, viz. : — (i) All goods carried from Aden, Rerim, and Ivaniaran to Modi and vice versa which will be taken by Cowasjee, Dinshaw, and 1 brothers’ steamers and by no other means. (ii Goods from Djibouti, Massowah. and Assab in French and Italian dhows respectively will be carried between tiiose ports and Medi and to none other Idrisi port. These dhows, however, will report to Port Otlicer, Kamaran, en route both ways to obtain special clearances. Any dhow found transgressing this order will be detained by naval patrols. (iii) Inter-trade between Idrisi ports lying between and including Khor al Rirk and llabl will be permitted in the Idrisi’s own dhows alone, and his Nakhudas will be furnished by Idrisi port oilicials with praper port clearances, flag, ]&gt;apers, and manifests. Failing this measure they will become liable to seizure. (iv) All ports lying between and inclusive of Khor al Dirk and llabl will be open to dhow trade from the Northern Red Sea Patrol area inclusive of Jeddah. All such Idrisi ports will be allowed to trade by dhows with ports in the Northern Red Sea Patrol inclusive of Jeddah, but such dhows must be furnished in the same manner as in clause (iii), with proper port clearances, flag papers, and manifests. Failure to comply with this measure will entail seizure. (v) Goods will be allowed to pass by dhows from Aden to Djibouti and Obock, but only under special guarantee. C. H. U.
