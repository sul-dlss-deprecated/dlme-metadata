Captain Seager recently spent a month in the Yemen and this Report contains the results of his observations. There is nothing spectacular in the Report but much of general interest. i He reports (para.2) that the Crown Prince’s stock is rising and he is beginning to have very little doubt that this Prince will succeed his father in the first instance^ ^ ^ In para.6 he states that the King is fit enough but looks tired; that he is in full possession of his faculties and still attends to the minutest affairs of State. Paras. 8-11 deal with Italian activities in the Yemen. Captain Seager does not appear to have found much outward evidence of Italian intrigue, and the Yemenis themselves appear to be singularly/singularly indifferent in the matter. In para.14 Captain Seager states that the King is rumoured to he endeavouring to introduce a system of conscription, and that in this connection he has engaged the services of one Hassan Tahsin Pasha, who claims to have been the G.O.C. of the He^azi troops in Saudi Arabia during the Saudi-Hejazi wars.

Cross currents of hatred and jealousy between the leading personalities; Abdulla al Amri, the virtual dictator of the country^awd his colleague, Raghib Bey, the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; the presumptive Crown Prince; and the powerful Wazir family, are perhaps a normal feature of any Oriental despotism and might lead to a series of Palace revolutions which would not have much effect on the world at large. However, the possibility that the civil servants are in the pay of Italy and the efforts of the Wazir Family to enlist British support remove these quarrels from the entirely domestic sphere/sphere and may give rise to international complications.

Sir, I have the honour to forward a I einorandum on certain personalities In the Central Yemeni Government and connected matter, prepared by Captain B.W, Seager, the Frontier Officer. I have, etc., (SGD.) B.R. RFJLLY. Resident etc. His Majesty 1 s Secretary of State for the Colonies, London .* ^ i C0r2L ( A SKETCH OP CERTAIN PERSONALITIES IN THE CENTRAL ,1EI4ENI OOVKKIT I-'iJ-iTT AIIP CONNECTED I TRODUCTQEX • It is ncr aim in this Memorandum to throw son* light on certain personalities in the Yemeni Govemnent. I have had some opportunity of sttidying the domestic side of the Yemeni administration, but, it is to be remembered, that the strictest secrecy which is maintained in the very restricted official and fanatical Zeldl element in Ban * 1 a and elsewhere in the Kingdom, make it the more difficult for me to present an adequate and accurate picture* 2* However critical I may be further on, it should be said that the Yemeni Government- whatever its defects - since its creation 16 years ago has done wonders for the country under its King (the Imam) who has, over a period of years, steadily, and in spite of severe reverses, brought peace and security into a country which has never known it before* This is a tremendous achievement and it is undoubtedly due to the determined and whole-hearted support given to the Imam by the fanatical and stubborn Eeidi element which has been the backbone of the ruling administration* The Imam is grealy respected, revered and venerated by this element, which, instinctively and almost in spite of itself looks upon him as the erbodiment of all that is holy on earth* Enough to say here, however, that the Imam has created an administration out of poor material, and, in its crude way, it Is efficient, if its methods cannot bear too close s scrutiny. GENERAL * 3. The Central Government in San 1 a is the Imam who rules with the sole assistance of two advisers, or clerks as he likes to call them, when in on evil humour* r hese&gt;s&gt; two clerkB are immensely powerful, partieularlj^ the first, in their respective spheres of influence* 4* These advisers are (1) Qadhi Ahdullah .1 mrl , 'clerk', 'chief clerk', 'chief wazir' or 'Prime Minister” who could he more properly styled TTn&amp;er Secretary of State to every Ministry except that of Foreign Affairs and (2) adhl Muhammad Kaghlh P ey, a Turk, 'clerk' or 'chief clerk' to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, who could he styled Under recretary of State for Foreign Affairs* 5* 1 will describe these Qadhis in turn:- qadhi Abdullah A1 Amri is the dominating personality in the Yemen today and I am safe in stating that chaotic conditions would rule in the Kingdom if he left the Imam’s palace for a fortnight. Every detail of the Yemeni administration is in his head because not a word is spoken or a line written without his imowledge - and generally only hin and the Imam’s knowledge. In Foreign Affaire he is intimately posted, and, whereas i*adhi Paghib sees and deals with papers connected with Foreign Affairs only, Arnrl sees and has a big say in every matter connected with the Administration - interior and exterior* 6* Qadhi Abdullah is a man of lowly origin and has attained his present position by long services to the Imam, or, as the Imam would think, long and devoted services* Ills life long policy has been one of self advancement and self enrichment by any means but this is not a very unique characteristic* I have it on good authority that in the time of the Turks he followed the fortunes of the Imam but this apparently didn’t deter him in acting as a well paid spy of the Turks at the same time* He has the happy fortune to be the only person in the Yemen who has earned a measure of the Inam’s confidence while his dominating position today is said / to&lt;3) I to be due to the fact that he alone of all Yemenis knows the working of the Imam’s mind* 't’his in Itself is no mean achievement* but, coupled as it is to his unique official position and to that measure of confidence he envoys at the Imam’s hands, his complete supremacy is easily understood* He was described a few years ago as being w d©cldedly clever, certainly very cunning and decidedly untrustwort y” and 'though the Imam holds the reins he deputes a great deal of work to Qadhi Abdullah who appears to have a finger in every pie; he is an enemy of RaghiV s against whom he is constantly intriguing”* This description is as true today hut in the interim he has gone from strength to strength, and, at the moment of writing, is probably at the height of his power under the are sent Imam. As the years have gone by the Imam has deputed more and iiore to him with the inevitable result that he (Amri) alone of all Yemenis has every intimate detail of the Kingdom at his finger tips* ?. It is said in 8an f a that Amri is in Italian pay* Two informants, one of whom has been the Imam’s private physician for the past two years, affirm that he receives a monthly salary - emanating from official sour es in Asmara - through an Italian coffee group in San’a. During the Sa’udi-Yemeni war last year our Political Clerk in Hodeidah reported that a small case containing gold specie, addressed to Qadhi Abdullah from Asmara through the Italian doctor in Hodeidah, was intercepted in the Customs but that the resulting g| scandal was quickly hfcshed up* In any event and whatever ra the circumstances, I will take it' that the reports of his ^ Italian attaches are true and from this standpoint will |J endeavour to trace any benefits which may accrue by any secret arrangement. I must confess that I am building on a very slender fabric but that the circumstances justify the experiment*g) a. The Qadhi’s future Is most uncertain and he would be the first to realise this* He is universally feared, loathed and detested by all the Imam’s sons and all important Yemenis; he is at loggerheads with the powerful Wazir family who, together with their satellites, govern more than a third of the Yemen* The 'Crown Prince” who is, incidentally, also anti- Wazir has sworn to reiK&gt;ve and disgrace the Qadhi if and when he has the power, though I will add in parenthesis that he ( Amri) may prove too able for him to crush for the reasons stated in paragraph 3 above. In any event Qadhi Abdullah must be astute enough to know that his future is not only insecure but highly dangerous as well, so what is he to do? He is up against everybody In the Yemen; all of his lines of retreat seem to end in blind alleys unless he can placate the future Imam, but, as it is impossible to forecast the Imandc Succession, what can he hope for? (I think incidentally that he has been trying to flirt with the Wasirs through Qadhi Hussein ; 1 Balali - Governor of Huieria in the district subordinate to Seiyid All ibn Al Wasir, who is Governor- General and Commander-in-Chief of the Ta'iz Liwa - a Son* a evidence in support of this)* In the circumstances I am compelled to think that he hat? decided the Italians are hie only salvation if they have ulterior motives in the Yemen* 9. I am sure in all fairness to him that the thought of Intimate collaboration with the Italians is distasteful to him but it is equally certain that he is engaged in polemics which concern his life and future. As a pious and fanatical Moslem he would think nothing of spending the Italian 11 res which came hie way and as a politician I think he has earned his pay in small ways, e*g* passing on tit bits of information (I am reliably informed for instance that he cltiaen, who is a personal friend of his but I have no recentlyrecently passed on a copy of the boundary description between the Yemen and the Men Protectorate to Captain Dubbioei t the Italian doctor in San*a); fending off any persons or business concerns inimical to Italian interests and watching over the interests of such Italians (particularly the doctors) who are living in the Yemenj but, he may have been recently faced with the question of major Italian interests if they have any In the Yemen. There is no doubt at all that the Imam ■ »«»&gt;■ XS'tfrlWNM. agitated in recent months with the march of events in Abyssinia and it is clear that he has envisaged measures to strengthen the Yemeni military am and defences. As Amri would be hie right hand man in any contemplated action it can be fully- appreciated what a powerful ally he could be to the furtherance of that Italian policy which schemes for territorial expansion in the Red Sea. It is said playfully in the Yemen that Amri’s power with the Inara is due to his ability in playing up so skilfully to his ruler 1 s avarice and there may be some truth in the jest, but, if it means that he can persuade the Imam not to spend money on fortifications when the peril is real then one can describe him as a valuable Italian tool. (I realise perfectly well that the Yemeni rnilitary arm is a puny affair whatever its state of efficiency in comparison to the strength of a modem European power but this is beside the point | as my concern here is a study of .adhi Abdullah’s policy). 10. In the last month the rnnam instructed Major Sureya Tarbagatay, a Turk (late of the Turkish General staff) who has been acting as ’ Chief of the Yemeni General Staff’’ for the past few months, to inspect the Hodeidah defences. The latter advised the Imam to buy modem guns and material whereupon he was asked what was wrong with the existing artillery, Bureya told me that he only just succeeded in restraining hie laughter as 90$ of the present Yemeni artilleryartillery consists 'of guns at least 40 years old, which, In Turkey today are sunk Into the quaysides and used as moorings for ships'! He told the Imam so hut still no fresh orders for the purchase of artillery appear to have been made. 11• If the Italians have any designs on the Yemen it is my opinion that if they are going to strike they must strike soon as the chances seem to he propitious. The Imam has hut to die in the near future to bring about a situation which would lend itself to intervention. The whole Yemeni administration is rotten to the core even if it is not inefficient, while there is no cohesion among the Fhafei tribes in the Tihama and elsewhere. The Wftxir family have as good a control as any over them but I have heard more than once that the tribesmen are going to have a bid for the overthrow of Zeidi domination when the present Imam dies. The Wasirs, though they are Zeldls themselves, might encourage this move if things worked out badly for them, with the result that the disintegration of the Yemeni Kingdom appears likely whatever the Italian policy. 12. And now as to (2) adhi ruh&amp;rrpiad Raghlb Bey . Qadhi kuhammad is a Cypriot by extraction and served for some years in the Ottoman Diplomatic Service and later had a long and distinguished career as an Ottoman official in the Yemen. He is about 53 years of age but is well preserved even if he suffers from a universal but distressing complaint. He returned to the Yemen in 1924-5 mainly because he was ruffled by Mustafa Eeraal aeha who offered him the Vilayets of Samsoun and ? Antalia only to cancel the appointments in favour of other persons. This piqued Raghib, who, had he waited, might well hava been given an Entoassy or Legation. In any event since 1924-5 he has been acting as Yemeni Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He is all powerful(3&gt; powerful in that department as 'both the Imam and /mri f neither of whom, for instance, have seen the shores of the I^ed Sea, have an inferiority cor^plex in raettere which concern the great world# 13# Qadhi Mtahaimied is a typical ^urk of the old school# He is &amp; most entertaining r aconteur and is a ver:' fascinating personality* He is greatly disliked hy all Yemenis mainly because he is u Ihxrk# The Imam general^ takes his advice on foreign affairs, hut, when in an evil humour, censures him and damns him in the most fluent and indelicate Arabic# Htghib is also reported to he in Italian pay* His ©on aged about 19 ic being educated in Italy troe of charge and It is to be presumed that under this head alone the Italian authorities expect a ©rnall return for their outlay# I sghib’s house in Ban’s is full of Italian cigarettes, drinks, tinned foods, fruit, confectionery, mineral w&amp;ters and brie s brae, and I very mu h wonder whether he has paid &amp; bill for them in his lifei He is rather a forlorn fi ure in Yemeni politics# His future le far fro i bright# The ' Crown Prince’ recently divorced or© of hi© (HeghiVa) daughters and ic said to have marked out hi® cx-fatherein-!aw for frightfulnese if and when he gets the chance.

Beiyid Ali ibn Al Wa^ir, OoB«nander-in-»Chief of the Ta'iz Liv/a asked me when I was last in Ta*iz v/hat His Majesty’s Government’s attitude would be if the Imam died and emphasised that he and his relatives feared the Italian menace# (This last may have been added purposely to lend force to the motive underlying his question which was an assurance of our support in the event of the Imam’s death). I repbecl cautiously and said His Majesty’s Government had not considered the matter as, inshallah, the Imam would live to a good old age. He pressed me again and again and though I fended him off by pointing out that we would naturally support our treaty with the King of the Yemen he would not break off the interview until I finally said that I would report the tenor of our conversa tion to the Residency on my return. The tf&amp;slrs are fearful of the ’’Crown Prince 11 being elected to the Imamate as he has 1 also marked them out for trouble and they too are considering ways and means for the future. In any event, it is significant that I should have been asked such a question by a leading personality in the Yemen*&amp; 15* An thie TT^rnorandiiTn is already too long* I will conclude it with an expression of hope that the man v/ill live long and in the interim be ably treated by his sole medical adviser, Captain Dubbiosi.
