It is also outlined what should be done should the Khan request assistance against the Meer [Mīr Muhanna]. It reports that two schooners anchored at Basra cannot be spared and won't be sent to Bushire. There is a response to the accusations Bowyear made against the conduct of Benjamin Jervis during his time as Resident, enclosing a copy of a letter from Jervis to the President and Council in which he defends himself.The enclosed letter, dated 3 November 1766, argues his case against the accusations that he made promises to Karim Khan that the English would assist him against Mīr Muhanna and that he tried to get the Governor of Bushire replaced.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024189854.0x0001a2#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
