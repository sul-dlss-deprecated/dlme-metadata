Dear Sir, We have been consulted by a Client who is resident in Baghdad, and who is interested in Mr. Naoum Abfco of Basra. Mr. Abbo was in the employ of the British Consul at Basra as chief dragoman for approximately fourteen years, up to the outbreak of War, and For four _ years thereafter in the Political Department of the Government of India, at Irak, until shortly before the Armistice in 1918. We have in our possession various copies of documents * Maekrell, Ward &amp; Knight, :c 35 I S3, Wa lb rook, London, E*C.4. 29th January, 1935 0 ircm which it appears that in 1919 sanction was accorded to the grant of a pension of Rs. 75 per month to Mr. Abbo with effect from the 1st June 1918, This sanction was signed by a Mr. L.M. Swann who at that time was a Secretary of the Financial Depart ment, and at present is adviser to the Irak Finance Ministry. He signed this sanction for and on behalf of the Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia under a Memorandum No. 4639/133/181/11 which was directed to the Military Governor and Political Adviser, Basra. On the 22nd January 1923 a Memorandum No. 2962 was issued to the Divisional Adviser at Basra to the effect that the payment of the allowance to Mr. Abbo should be discontinued. We understand that a great deal of correspondence has passed between Mr. Abbo and the British Government with regard to this discontinuance of the pension, and ultimately an appeal was The Secretary, The India Office, Whitehall, S.W.lwa^, addressed by him to The Rt. Hon. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, The matter received consideration but His Majesty's Government could not see any reason to modify the decision conveyed to Mr. Abbo oy His Majesty's representatives in Irak concerning his requests for a continuance of the pension. We also understand that the Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia at the time of the grant of the pension, namely June 1918, was subject to the authority of the Government of India hence our writing you in regard to this matter* Before placing the whole of the facts before you respecting Mr. Abbo f s services to the British Government and the history thereof which led to the granting of the pension, we shall be glad if you will let us hear from you confirming that the sanction granted by Mr. Swann was authorised by your Office* you please let us hear at your early convenience so that we may place the whole matter before you in order that the decision of the British Government concerning Mr. Abbo’s ' request for a continuance of the pension may be reviewed* We are, etc., (Sgd.)

His Majesty's Secretary of State not having seen his way to accept liability for any pension for him Sir A.T.Wilson then Acting Civil 1 Commissioner sanctioned tne payment; to him of a monthly I allowance of Rs.75/- per mensem debitable to the Civil S' Revenues. The 'Iraq Government in the course of retrenchment have necessarily been reviewing their pension list and having regard to the fact that Mr. Naoum Abbo's services comprised 13^ years under His Majesty's Foreign Office and only 3^ years under the Civil Administration during the British regime, they demur to the acceptance of further liability His Grace the Duke of Devonshire, for/ K. G. , P. C. , G. C.M.G. , G.C.V.O. , Secretary of State for the Colonies, Downing Street, London, S.W.l.n for his pension. fai as the Iraq Government is concerned the case is one in regard to which it is clearly difficult for the High Commissioner to insist on their giving him a pension for life but in view of Mr. Abbo's good services in the Entisn Consulate, I venture to ask that His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs may be moved at any rate to grant him a compassionate gratuity of Rs.5000/- in liquidation of any obligations to him which we may be considered to have. Consul Crow under whom he spent nearly all of his British service wrote of him in July 1919 in a letter to Sir A.T.Wilson:- I have just received a long wail from my old Dragoman Naoum Abbo who seems down on his luck and out of work. I believe he rendered good service after the occupation and I understood that Cox thought well of him. Can you do anything towards setting him on his legs again? I should not like to feel that an old and well tried servant as he has proved himself to be had been turned adrift”. Hoping very much that Your Grace will see your way to move in the matter in the direction suggested, I have, etc., (Signed) P.Z. Cox. High Commissioner for Iraq.COPY No« 19227 13371817” Office of the Civil Commissioner Dated Baghdad, 14th September 1918. From- Bt.Lieut-Colonel A.T.Wilson, C.M.G., C.I.E., D.S.O. , Officiating Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. To The Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla. Sir, I have the honour to recommend for consideration the grant of a pension to Mr.Naoum Abbo, who before the out break of war, was employed at His Britannic Majesty*s Consulate in Basrah. He served in the capacity of Consular Dragoman for ten years and then as Chief Dragoman for four years. Mr.Naoum Abbo's pay as Chief Dragoman was at the rate of £15/10- per month, allowances included, besides attendance fees which averaged £2/10- p.m. As Chief Dragoman he had very confidential duties to perform and his position was one of trust and dignity. It was part of his task to sit in the Capitulation Courts in cases in which the interests of British subjects were involved. A copy of a memorandum on the way in which Mr.Naoum Abbo performed his duties as Consular Dragoman and Chief Dragoman, which was recorded in 1915 by Mr.R*W.Bullard, is attached: a copy of a testimonial by Mr.F.E.Crow, C.M.G., is also submitted. At/j At the time of the British Occupation of Basrah when there was much disorder, Mr.Naoum Abbo, who had been at j irot imprisoned by the Turks, was instrumental in preserving, at some risk to himself, a number of official documents which were of much use to the British officers in their task of setting up a new administration. For these services Mr.Naoum Abbo received the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal of the second class in 1915. Mr.Naoum Abbo after the British occupation continued to be employed by the Political Department at a salary of Rs.300/- per mensem plus Rs•50/— per mensem conveyance allowance. He drew pay at this rate until the 31st May 1918, when his services were dispensed with owing to the state of his health, he having then been on the sick list since 15th June 1917. He has now been pronounced by the Civil Surgeon Basrah, as unfit for further service. His age is 55 years and he has rendered 17 years’ service to Government. Mr.Naoum Abbo’s service was of course non-pensienable and he has no service book. But the main facts are on record in Mr.Bullard’s memorandum and there is no doubt about them. In the circumstances I think that the grant of a pension to Mr.Naoum Abbo would be an act of justice as well as of political expediency, and I therefore recommend that he be granted one, at the rate of Rs.75/- which is about equivalent here to Rs.25/- in India. I have, etc., (Signed) A.T. Wilson. Lieut-Col., I.A. Copy to:- P.0. BasrahCOPT Memorandimi on Ifao'um Abbo» late First Dragoman to His Britannic Majesty* s Consulate at Basrah. Haoum Abbo was employed as First Dragoman to Eis Britannic Majesty*s Consulate at Basrah, for about 13 years, previous to the outbreak: of the Anglo-Turkish War in 1914. I have searched among the Consular archives subsequent to his appointment, and though I have discovered no confidential report on his character, I have found proofs that his services were appreciated highly and that he was frequently employed on confidential work. In 1907 Mr.Crow applied for and obtained for him a considerable increase of salary, describing him in the application as ”A good dragoman, very conscientious and most painstaking and persevering in getting information.' On several occasions His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople sanctioned grants to Haoum Abbo for particular services connected with political affairs, and in 1914 Mr.Crow when passing through Constantinople on his way hone from Basrah obtained from Sir Louis Mallet a promise to support in principle Naoum* s application for a further increase of salary. Apart from the evidence afforded by the archives I know that both Mr.Monahan and Mr.Crow entrusted Eaoum with confidential missions, and the fact that he remained so long at the Consulate and that Mr.Crow so anxious to retain his services would appear to show that they had no reason to regard him as unworthy of their confidence. (Sd.) R.W.Bullard, Late Acting British Consul, Basrah. Dated the 23rd March, 1915. mmI have much pleasure in stating that I have known Mr.^aOW Ahbo, formerly Chief Dragoman to the British Consulate at Basrah, for the past 12 years during my tenure of office as His Majesty’s Consul there. I found him a most able and active assistant and very competent as an Adviser in all matters relating to (Turkish Administration and Turkish Legal procedure. He is energetic, assidious, and a most painstaking and conscientious worker and his intimate knowledge of the country, people, and language proved invaluable during my residence at the Consulate. His tact and discretion in difficult circumstances are beyond all praise and I can testify to his scrupulous honesty in all respects. {Signe d) f.B.Crow, His Majesty’s Consul.

Gentlemen, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to refer to your letter HE/EAC of January 29th to the India Office and to Foreign Office letter of March ^22nd regarding the claim of Mr. Naoum Abbo, an Iraqi national, for the continuance of a pension at the rate of 75 rupees a month which was paid to him from 1918 to 1923 in respect of services which he had rendered in Iraq. 2. I am to state that the facts mentioned in your letter^ under reply appear to be generally correct and that, as the full circumstances of the case have in the past been communicated to His Majesty^ Government by Mr. Abbo and have been carefully considered by them, there would seem to be no need for you now to submit the matter in any greater . Q detail to this department. 3. The payment of the pension, with effect from... . .«*•••)**«• ;Jti• s *;.•:!]J from June 1st , 1918, to Mr. At&gt;bo, who was described as the late Chief Dragoman of the Deputy Civil Commissioner’s Office at Basra, was sanctioned in 1919 by the Civil Com missioner in Mesopotamia, who at that time was acting under the authority of the Government of India and His Majesty s Govern ment in the United Kingdom. The pension was \ granted solely in respect of Mr. Abbo s valuable services, during a period of about 5^ years, in the Political Department of the Civil Administration in Mesopotamia and not in respect of his previous service as dragoman at His Majesty’s Consulate at Basra, this latter service not having carried pension rights. It was decided, moreover, that Mr. Abbo’s pension should be payable entirely from2 ? s payment of Ivir. Atbo’s pension from local revenues. In 1923, however, having in the course of retrenchment submitted their pension list to review, the Iraqi Government demurred to the acceptance of further liability in respect of Mr, Abbo, and decided to discontinue / J. /'■? payment of the pension. In view of the fact o : . L&gt; . vv r . that the original grant had been made as an act of grace, and did not involve any obligation to continue the payment of the pension His Majesty f s High Commissioner at Bagdad felt unable in the circumstances to urge the Iraqi Government to reconsider their decision. 5. As has been shown, Mr. Abbo T s pension was throughout paid from the revenues of Mesopotamia, or Iraq, in respect of services to that country. The question of its con tinuance must therefore be solely one for the Iraqi Government; and His Majesty’s Government who were not in a position to intervene on Mr. Abbo’s IMr. Abbo’s behalf even in 1925, could not use their good offices in his favour now that the mandatory regime in Iraq has terminated.P.1.1713/35.

We shall be glad to have a reply to our letter to you of the 29th ultimo, as we wish to report to our Client in Baghdad by this week’s Air Mail. Yours faithfully, KACKBDLL WARD &amp; KNIGHT The Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India, Office, S.W.l.HE/SAC. P.Z. 701/35. Dear Sir, 33, Walbrook, London, E.C.4. 29th January, 1935. We have been consulted by a Client who is resident m Baghdad, and who is interested in Mr. Haoum Abbo of Basra. Mr. Abbo was in the employ of the British Consul at Basra as chief dragoman for approximately fourteen ^ears, up to the outbreak of War, and for four years thereafter in the Political Department of the Government of India, at Irak, until shortly before the Armistice in 1918. We have in our possession various copies of documents from which it appears that in 1919 sanction was accorded to the grant of a pension of Rs.75 per month to Mr.Abbo with effect from the 1st June 1918. This sanction was signed by a Mr. L. M. Swann who at that time was a Secretary of the Financial Department, and at present is adviser to the Irak Finance Ministry. He signed this sanction for and on behalf of the Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia under a Memorandum Ho. 4639/133/181/11, which was directed to the Military Governor and Political Adviser/2. Adviser, Basra, On the 22nd January 1923 a Memorandum Ho.2962 was issued to the Divisional Adviser at Basra to uhe effect that the payment of the allowance to Mr.AhbQ should be discontinued. We understandthat a great deal of correspondence has passed between Mr.Abbo andjthe British Government with regard to this discontinuance of the pension, and ultimately an appeal was addressed by him to the Bt.Hon. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald. The matter received consideration but His Majesty’s Government could not see any reason to modify the decision conveyed to Mr.Abbo by His Majesty’s representatives in Irak concerning his requests for a continuance of the pension. We also understandthat the Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia at the time of the grant of the pension, namely June 1918, was subject to the authority of the Government of India hence our writing you in regard to this matter. Before placing the whole of the facts before you respecting Mr. Abbo f s services to the British Government and the history thereof which led to the granting of the pension, we shall be glad if you will let us hear from you confirming that the sanction granted by Mr.Swann was authorised by your Office. Will/'H 3» Will you please let us hear at your early convenience so that we may place the whole matter before you in order that the decision of the British Government concerning Mr, Abbo f s request for a continuance of the pension may be reviewed. We are, etc., MACKRELL WARD &amp; KNIGHT The Secretary, India Office, S.W.l.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000192_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/127</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x000192</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/127</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>PZ 701/1935 Question of Continuance of Pension of Naoum Abbo of Basra</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1935/1935</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-11-09T09:07:50</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (42 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the first folio with 1 and terminates at the last folio with 42; these numbers are written in pencil, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence relating to the issue of whether a pension paid from 1918 to 1923 to Mr Naoum Abbo of Basra, an Iraqi national, should be continued.The correspondence includes:Letters and copies of letters between the India Office and Mackrell, Ward and Knight, including a copy of a letter to the Secretary, India Office, dated 29 January 1935 (folio 13), stating that their client, resident in Baghdad, is interested the request of Abbo - who the letter states was employed by the British Consul at Basra as Chief Dragoman for approximately fourteen years up to the outbreak of the First World War, and four years thereafter in the Political Department of the Government of India – for continuance of a pension paid to him from 1918.Correspondence between the India Office and the Foreign Office regarding Abbo’s case, including letters from the India Office to the Foreign Office enclosing copies of correspondence between the India Office and Mackrell, Ward and Knight, and correspondence from the Foreign Office to the India Office enclosing copies of correspondence between the Foreign Office and Mackrell, Ward and Knight.
