The constitution of the mixed tribunals in the T'rkish Empire has no resemblance to that of the mixed tribunals in Egypt. Ihe constitution Ottoman mixed tribunals was as follows: At Constantinople a special Chamber of the Commercial Court dealt with mixed commercial cases, other than maritime cases, and mixed civil cases other than those coming within the jurisdiction of the Nizamieh Court. 1 he Chamber was composed of an Ottoman President and two Ottoman judges, and was assisted by two assessors ol the nationalities interested in the case. Mixed maritime cases were tried by the Maritime Chamber of the Commercial Court, such Chamber consisting of an Ottoman f resident and two Ottoman judges, assisted in mixed maritime cases by two assessors ot the nationalities interested. • i n &lt;- In the Provinces, mixed cases were tried by the ordinary Commercial Court where one existed, or by the ordinary Civil Court, where there was no Commercial Court. These courts were assisted by two assessors of the ^ nationalities interested. If no one of the nationality of either of the parties to the suit was available to act as assessor, an assessor might be chosen of another nationality. An appeal lay from the decisions of these Provincial Courts in mixed cases to the Mixed Chamber of Commerce at Constantinople. 4. By Imperial Iradeh, dated the 26 Eylul 1330 (8th September 1914), a trans lation of which is contained in the first appendix to this Memorandum, the Capitulations were abolished. 5. Since the occupation, the British Administration has assumed that consular extra-territorial jurisdiction was at least in abeyance, and that the ordinary Civil and Criminal Courts were vested with the extra-territorial jurisdiction formerly vested m Consular Courts. In accordance with this assumption. Civil and Criminal Courts have dealt with a certain number of cases in which Uritish and Persian subjects were concerned, and which, according to the Capitulations, would have been dealt with by British or Persian Consular Courts. Apart from British and Persian subjects, there are few foreigners in Mesopotamia. Ihe courts at Baghdad have, however, dealt with at least two cases which under the Capitulations were within the jurisdiction of the .French Consular Court. It is probable that the courts at Basrah have dealt with similar cases concerning other foreign nationals. Recently the Persian Consul has shown a tendency to claim to exercise jurisdiction as regards cases concerning the personal status of Persian subjects. And the British authorities, while careful not to express concurrence in the exercise of such juris diction, have not thought it necessary to object to it. 6. The only two Powers who have any considerable number of subjects in Mesopotamia are Great Britain and Persia. x\ccording to a recent estimate of the population of Mesopotamia by nationalities, it was estimated that, apart from members of the Army of Occupation and of the Civil Administration, there were resident in Mesopotamia some 300 European subjects, of whom the majority would be British subjects, some 3,000 Indians, of whom nearly all would be British subjects or British protected subjects, and some 70,000 Persians. In addition to its rights of protection over its own subjects, France claims a right of protection over the Latin Church. The rights of the Persian representatives and of Persian subjects in Ottoman territories were somewhat different from those of other foreign Powers. Translations of documents defining Persian rights are set out in the second appendix. 7. It would not be wise either for Great Britain or other foreign Powers to consent to the abolition of the existing judicial privileges which foreigners possess under the capitulations, unless safeguards are made both as regards the courts by w T hich the rights of foreigners will be tried and the law under which they are to be tried. As regards the courts, Ottoman Courts have for many reasons never enjoyed the confidence even of Ottoman subjects, much less of foreigners. Few Ottoman judges possess the educational or technical qualifications expected of judges in Europe. The best of the judges were Turks, and the standard of knowledge amongst nativejudges in Mesopotamia is in general below that arnon^t in . • , Ottoman Courts have always possessed an unenviable renuta'inn 0nS ntlll0 P' e - As regards the law, both the Ottoman Penal Code fnd the Ott Corru P tlon - Codes were issued many years ago, and were based on'the French'wd'es Tf rClal they follow French law there is no valid reason against their use for th*?' i f ^ in which foreigners are concerned • but thpv i ! ! trial of cases and requirements, and are in urgent i dea8 which is better known as the MpiVllph ia q ^^ tt Ottoman Civil Law, A great many of its pro^si^irare ven' 0f Ilanafi ^ammedan Law. trial of cases between foreieneis T)', , J.

But it is to be noted that the capitulXns in Egypt are than those m other parts of the Ottoman Empire. In Egypt for instance everv W^ proceeding in which a foreigner is interested is withdrawn'from the Native Courts Conditions in Egypt also are very different from those existing in Mesopotamia The organisation of the courts is different, Egypt possessing in its mixed tribunals an existing judiciary of standing, which has been accustomed to deal with civil suits in foie i^rTh? 1 are Jn ; ereSted r and with certain minor offences committed by - e gneis Phe kws m force m Egypt are in general much more in agreement with ^ lopean ideas than those in force m the Turkish Empire. Egyptian officials are as a class much better educated than native officials in Mesopotamia. In Egvpt also spread 8 a ^ 0I)ean ^ ;)ar arl( ^ tlle knowle( Jge of European languages is widely . ^ en ce a solution of the various questions involved in the abolition of the capitulations which may be suitable for Egypt will not necessarily be suitable for Mesopotamia. 9. If the existing judicial privileges which foreigners possess under the capitula tions are abolished, it becomes necessary to decide what courts shall in future have jurisdiction in cases which formerly came under the capitulations. Speaking broadly, there are two possible schemes :—Either (1) the ordinary local courts may deal with such cases subject to safeguards, or (2) special courts may be created to deal with such cases. These special courts may either, like the mixed tribunals in Egypt, be composed of judges of various nationalities, or they may be composed, as at Zanzibar, solely of British judges, or of British judges and Mesopo- tamian judges. These various schemes are developed in. detail and compared in the following paragraphs. But it is obvious that the practical working of these various schemes and the effects likely to be produced by them are dependent on the nature of the Government which will be established in Mesopotamia, and especially on the extent of the control of the administration which Great Britain is to exercise under the mandate, and the willingness or unwillingness of the future Mesopotamia!! Govern ment to accept reforms in the organisation and procedure of the local courts and in the law applied by them. Hence it is not possible, until the relations between Great Britain and this country are more definitely settled than at present, to come to a final conclusion on the most suitable organisation of the courts for dealing with cases in which foreigners are interested, and the following discussion on this subject is necessarily provisional. 10. Scheme to vest in the ordinary Courts jurisdiction to hear all eases in which Foreigners are interested. —It will be seen from para. 2 that if one classes the Mixed Courts as Ottoman Courts—and one may rightly do so since all the judges were Ottoman subjects—even under the capitulations the Ottoman Courts, subject to safe- o aards dealt with the majority of cases in which foreigners were interested. On the other hand, Consular Courts heard cases, whether criminal, civil or commercial, in diich both parties were foreigners, and cases of personal status where the defendant W a foreicmer. Cases of personal status included bankruptcy as well as the usual u 1 ^ na ture. From the point of view of the future Mesopotamian Government of Mesopotamians, this scheme, namely, to vest in the ordinary courts jurisdiction + Lnr all cases in which foreigners are interested, is the best. It puts the local r rni ls on the same footing as those of foreign independent Powers. It avoids theinconveniences and difficulties wlrich necessarily arise from conflicts of jurisdiction where two sets of courts are functioning in the same country. It does not involve any considerable additional expense, and as foreign Poweis will not consent to the scheme unless they are satisfied that justice will be reasonably well administered, it ensuies a higher standard of efficiency for the courts than they are likely to attain if cases between foreigners are excluded from them. It does not, however, follow that the scheme would be popular with Mesopotamians or would be accepted by a native Mesopotamian Government, for the scheuJe will involve safeguards which may not be acceptable. The interests of Great Britain as mandatory Power may conflict with the interests of her nationals resident in Mesopotamia. Regarded from the standpoint of her position as mandatory Power, the scheme now under discussion seems the best, since it will strengthen her hand in introducing necessary reforms in the local courts and in maintaining their efficiency. But her duty towards her own nationals will only permit of her accepting the scheme subject to adequate safeguards. The object of the safeguards is to ensure that the courts will be administered with reasonable efficiency and honesty, and that the law applied by them will be suitable for foreigners. The Turkish courts were neither efficient nor honest, but undoubtedly the Judges of Turkish nationality were, as a rule, better qualified than those of Mesopotamian nationality ; and it would not be possible to form courts of sufficient strength solely of the existing Mesopotamian judges. Under existing conditions there is little probability of the courts being either efficient or honest unless some control is exercised over them by the mandatory Power. That would seem to be an essential condition of Great Britain or foreign Powers agreeing to the local courts being vested with general jurisdiction over cases in which foreigners are interested. Other safeguards will require fuller consideration than I have been able to give to them and might usefully be referred to a Committee for discussion, but provisionally I put forward the following ; — (а) Under the capitulations cases of a less value than £T. 10 and cases relating to leases of immovable property were triable by the Nizamieh courts (i.e., the ordinary Ottoman courts). It is suggested that it would be for the general convenience to extend the cases which may be tried by the ordinary Ottoman courts so as to coincide with the jurisdiction of a Peace Court, and to permit all suits in which a foreigner is interested, which would be within the jurisdiction of a Peace Court if a foreigner were not so interested, to be tried by a Peace Court. For the jurisdiction of a Peace Court see Appendix III. (б) Except for cases within the jurisdiction of a Peace Court {see Appendix HI.) cases in which foreigners are interested must be tried by a court comprising at least one British judge out of the usual total of three; if the case is triable by a single judge, the judge must be British. The British judge being in a minority, it is probable that cases may occasionally occur between British or foreign subjects and natives in which the majority of the court will be prejudiced in favour of the native. If it is thought necessary to provide an absolute safeguard against this possibility, it will be necessary to provide that the majority of the Court of First Instance, or at least of the Court of Appeal, are British. But it is to be remembered that under the capitulations both the mixed tribunals and the Ottoman Criminal Courts which had jurisdiction over foreigners Avere composed entirely of Ottoman subjects. I do not consider, therefore, that a demand for a British majority on the court is justified. (c) Appeals and applications for revision of judgments in which foreigners are interested, including judgments of Peace Courts, must be tried by a court on which there is at least one British judge if the court consists of three, and at least two British judges if the court consists of four or five, and so on in proportion. (r/) The trial of commercial cases shall be heard with assessors, as under the capitulations, in places where there are sufficient foreigners to supply satisfactory assessors. (e) The existing law in general must be revised and approved by the mandatory Power. In particular revision is necessary of the Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Regulations ; also of the Commercial Code, and especially the sections relating to bankruptcy. The Mejelleh is quite unsuited for application to foreigners ; but, being based on the Religious Law, the people of Mesopotamia are attached to it, and it is doubtful whether they would agree to an extensive revision of its provisions. If an adequate revision is not feasible, possibly an arrangement can be made excludingcertain of its provisions from cases in wlnV.^ -f cases relating to immovable property and suh tif 0 . lei ^ , ]. ers are interested other thpn rn accordance with Europearf ideas y ' d Substltut «g for foreigners provisiot This nrf,v; 0 7A''™' ^r , - rll - aulc - 1116 same privileo-e ,n,X 1, ' may be conducted us provision would, it is true, cause some .I'b? i g ■ be tended to French strongly opposed to this.

' 12. Scheme to vest in British Judges or in Special Courts composed of British and Mesopotamiau Judges jurisdiction to hear all cases in which foreigners are interested If the proposal to vest in the Ordinary Courts jurisdiction to hear all cases in which, foreigners are interested is rejected, this seems the best alternative. It would be advisable, in my opinion, that the courts should comprise Mesopo- tamian judges as well as British judges. As has already been pointed out, under the capitulations the majority of cases in which foreign subjects were interested were dealt with by courts composed of Ottoman subjects, so that it would be likely to cause dissatisfaction if Mescpotamians was not represented on the courts. Besides, as in in most cases which came before the courts natives would be interested as well as foreigners, it is just that the courts should comprise Mesopotamian judges, and their presence would strengthen the courts. As most of the judges could also hold appointments as members of the local courts, the plan would not involve any great expense. 2524 b6 If the Special Courts comprise native judges as well asEnghsli, they in constitution grently differ from the ordinary local courts. Tne chiel diftere ce between the present proposal and that described in para. 10 is that the courts under the present proposals would be separate courts from the ordinary local courts. He ce it would be easier for the mandatory Power to control their constitution procedure and law ; if thought necessary, special Codes of Procedure and Law could be piepaied for their use. 13. Although not directly within the scope of this memorandum, I may be permitted to draw attention to two inconveniences in connection with the law ot succession to immovable property to which British nationals in Mesopotamia are subject. ^ . . ' According to Ottoman law, or at least according to Ottoman practice, succession to the immovable property of a deceased foreigner is determined by the law of his nationality. It was accordingly the practice in Mesopotamia on the death ol a Hntisli subject to treat any land he possessed as passing under his will. By a recent decision of the Privy Council it has been decided that succession to the immovable property situated in'Egypt of a deceased British subject is governed by the lex loci, i.e., Mohammedan Hanafi Law. No doubt the same ruling would apply to Mesopotamia. The Mohammedan Law of Succession is unsuitable to be applied to Europeans, and m some respects is extremely unfair, llns would be of loss impoitance it' it were not that it does not permit of gift by will, except of one-third of the estate. The other inconvenience to which I would draw attention is that under Ottoman law no person who abandons his Ottoman nationality and becomes nationalised in a foreign country can inherit from an Ottoman subject. Oases ha\e been bi ought to mv attention of Mesopotamian Jews who have settled in Manchester, and been naturalised as British subjects, being excluded from the inheritance of their relatives who have remained Ottoman subjects. The abolition of the capitulations may provide an opportunity for these inconvenient rulings being remedied. 14. In the preceding paragraphs it has been assumed that cases of personal status in which foreigners are interested would be removed from the Consular Courts, and iurisdiction over them vested in the ordinary local courts or in specially created courts for mixed interests. This, of course, is in accordance with the practice q £ countries where no consular jurisdiction exists, and is logical and has the advantage of simplicity and of avoiding conflicts of jurisdiction. But there would be certain advantages in leaving cases of personal status, if limited to questions of marriage, divorce, dowry, maintenance, guardianship of infants, and succession to movable property, to the Consular Courts. The law to be applied in such cases is the personal law of the foreigner concerned ; that is to say, as a rule the law of the Consular Court on which he is dependent. It is not easy for a local court to ascertain and correctlv apply such law. And Consular Courts are more likely to give decisions which are satisfactory to the parties in cases concerning the family relations of their own nationals than local courts. To leave such cases to Consular Courts would not be contraiy to the general system in force. For cases relating to personal status of M^ohammedans aie now, and are likely to continue to be, dealt with by the Mohammedan law courts and not by the ordinary civil courts. And the Ottoman, Christian, and Jewish communities have hitherto exercised a limited jurisdiction in cases relating to the personal status of their members. I am inclined to think that the plan of leaving cases of personal status m which foreigners are interested to be decided by Consular Courts will work more satisfactorily than to vest this jurisdiction in the ordinary local courts or in specially created courts for mixed interests. 15. As regards the privilege possessed by foreigners of immunity from domi ciliary- search by the local authorities, I think sufficient protection would be afforded to foreigners in the chief towns if their houses might not be entered or searched except on a warrant issued by a British judge of the court having jurisdiction in mixed cases. In towns and places where there is no British judge, I suggest that the privilege ought to be waived and domiciliary search permitted on the warrant of a local judge. 16. I understand that it is proposed to obtain the consent of the Powers to the abolition of the capitulations. Negotiations for this purpose will necessarily take7 time, and there is likely tberefnrp ^ i cation of the Peace Treaty w^h T i a consid erab]e intervil Iw abolition of the capitulations 4 j . and l tbe consent 'of the Pm 16 ratifi - coming under the capitulations are to be dealt 8 ' ' e ~y a^'^ to th « So long as the country remains ™ lth » this interval cases Government is established I thinl- f ™ &gt; ary Goverilm ent and nnfT continue to be tried as at present Th , which foreigners are 't 3 ? tlVe possibly be raised are cases wWK ' le . cases m which serious .^rested can parties are foreigners In all 1 01 ' criminal, or oonnnerpil? ? bjec , t ! 0Q may opinion the existing local con. ts shn iT® 8 ' • but es Pccially in crim.nl/' 1 Ch botl1 however be inclintl 11 sh ould continue to 'J''! 1 cases, m my &lt; aused by the absence of Consuls, Present time considerable inconvenience fs 1st September 1920. ^ onham C arter, Judicial Secretary.

It may be summarised as follows (a) Suits for debts and claims for a sum or property not exceeding £T. 50, or for a right of way, a 'water way or right of drainage; claims for damages, costs and piofits arising out ot a principal claim may be heard regardless of their amount provided the oiiginal claim is under fT. 50. fM Counterclaims without limit as to value. ) c { Claims to the restoration of possession of immovable property or to a right to use water without limit as to value.
