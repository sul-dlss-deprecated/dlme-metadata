These tables have the following headings:total imports;total exports;import of principal articles by steamers;import of principal articles by sailing craft;export of principal articles by steamers;export of principal articles by sailing craft;return of shipping of all nationalities that entered and cleared in the foreign trade of the port during 1921-1922;return of British shipping that entered and cleared in the foreign trade of the port during 1921-1922.Included in the tables of imports and exports is the corresponding data (i.e. quantities and values of goods) for the two preceding financial years, as well as the countries from/to which the principal articles were imported/exported.None of the material in the file is dated, but it is likely to have been created and compiled either during or at the end of the financial year of 1921-1922.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000016#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
