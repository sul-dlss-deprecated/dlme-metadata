My dear Sir Geoffrey, 'Hi, COP y C0FPID5NTIAL. itT Politic al agency, Bahrain, 26th Ootqber 194 3* During a recent interview with, hia attention to what I looked upon as the inconsiderate and ill-advised policy of the Bahrain Government in regard to their police force. 2. The Bahrain police are in receipt of no war allowance and have had no increase in p^ since hostilities commenced. It is true that they receive free rations ani therefore as individuals have probably not felt the increased cost of living as much as persons who have had to feed them selves. As family men, and mar^r of them are, they have been as badly hit by rising prices as their neighbours the majority of whom have either had their ps^y increased or are in receipt of a war allowance. 3. The police are still a loyal and reasonably efficient body but it has already come to my notice that they are beginning to show signs of dissatisfaction. I informed Belgrave that in my opinion the Bahrain Government should consider at once the grant of a war allowance and not allow the position to deteriorate to such an extent that they are forced by a police strike to remedy the men’s very real grievances. Yours sincerely, Sd. T.HICKINBOTHAM. The Hon’ble Lieutenant Golonel &gt; oir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.B., D.O. I^o . 8 09-5 . The Residency, Bushire, the 30th October 194 3.

In view of the reasons given by Colonel Loch, I recommend the proposal and request that the GoverniMent of India will be pleased to make necessary arrangements for a detachment of four or, if possible, six members of the Bahrain Police Force to receive practical training with the Training Battalion of the 10th Baluch Regiment at Karachi. \ceTJ lU t. 2). tj b I® ibhtk-hi uid /,/. 0 / .

TRAINING OF IffiMBSRS OF THE BAHRAIN POLICE FORCE WITH AN INDIAN INFANTRY UNIT AT KARACHI. I have the honour to refer to a letter No. 35130/1/M.T.1 • G.S. dated the 28th April 1933 from the Assistant Secretary to the Government of India, Army Department, to the Chief of the General Staff (a copy of which was forwarded to Bahrain with your printed letter No. 1123 dated the 30th Lay 1933) and to inform you that the Bahrain Government state that the experiment of training members of the Bahrain Police Force with an Indian Infantry Unit at Karachi has proved extremely successful from their point of view. 2. The Bahrain Government now request that arrangements may be made for them to send four, or if possible, six, more Non commissioned officers and other ranks from the Bahrain Police Force for similar training with the 10th Baluch Regiment at Karachi. 3. The Bahrain Government are particularly anxious that the men selected should receive their training from the Training Battalion of the 10th Baluch Regiment both on account of the hajpy relations which have already been established with the unit and to reduce the expenses in connection with their travelling. 4. The Bahrain Government will meet all charges in connection with the training of the Non-commissioned officers and men as they did in 1933. 5. I think that the proposal is an admirable one, both because of the training which the men receive and because of their coming in this way under good British influence, which is valu able now that there are so many Americans in Bahrain, and I, therefore, request that if the Honourable the Political Resident Via a • •ha,&amp; no objection, the request of the Bahrain Government may be recommended to the Government of India.Kegr.

ENCLOSURE !N FOREIGN SECTARY'S ' r Mn B 6Z i t O' O.Copy of a letter dated the 26 th October 1932, rrom tne Political AgentT'Bahrain, Bushire, to the Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to state that during my recent visit to Karachi, the Bahrain Government expressed a wish to send three or four men of the Stated Police Force to India for training in Indian Units. After discovering that both units of the Baluch Regiment in Karachi were willing to accept such men, I approached the General Officer Commanding , Sind Independent Brigade Area, who, however, informed me that he had no authority for the training of military personnel of countries situated outside the boundaries of India and advised me to take up the matter through the Government of India. 2. The Bahrain Government have now formally applied to be allowed to send three or four picked men, N.C.C&amp;s, or other ranks to an Indian unit for six to nine months* training and wish to be allowed to do so as early as possible. Ihe Adviser, who is at present carrying out the duties of Commandant of Police, consider^ that the local men show promise, but that there are none among C who have sufficient training or *hii«igwa»gyiiwiiaT experince to act as instructors, and it is proposed to utilise the men who are to be trained in India for this purpose upon their return*. 3. Ihe Aiviser states that he understands that the nine ordinary recruits* training which lasts for^tkx** months will be the most suitable course for them to take as it covers all the requirements of the Bahrain police: training in signalling or special physical training or bayonet fighting courses are not required by them, but in the matter of training the Jtate will be guided entirelyby the advice of the Commanding Officer of the unit to which the men are attached. What the State is aiming at is roughly the standard of training which obtains in armed police in India* 4. The State will meet all charges in connection with the men and would either provide them with ration allowance or obtain rations on payment for them by regimental arrangement. They will be supplied with uniforms from Bahrain, unless for any reason it is desired that they should wear uniform of the unit to which they are attached, in which case the Bahrain Government would pay for such uniforms, and in fact, as I have said above, all necessary payments incurred on behalf of the men would be refunded by the State. 5. I request, therefore, that you will be good enough to inform the Hobble the Political Resident of the Bahrain Governments desire and request him to forward it to the Government of India as early as possible. It is preferred that the men should be sent to Karachi for training as the units there are willing to receive them, and their travelling expenses will be reduced by going to the nearest station in India. I would be glad therefore if the General Officer Commanding, Sind Independent Brigade Area, could be approached as early as possible so that the men may be sent for training with the least possible delay.&gt;\teW •V cm. a.

The organisation of the Bahrain Police force on a purely local basis is however regarded as something in the nature of an experiment to which the Government of India trust that in view of the risks involved and of the importance of avoiding any incident at Bahrain which could give any foreign power ground for complaint against the administration, you will give your close personal attention and impress the same duty upon the Political agent.

BAHRAIN POLICB, y l With reference to your letter No. C.t of 19 31 , dated the 22nd January 1932 , I jur. directed to 8 *y that the Government of India hare carefully considered the proposal for the replacement of the Indian .Police at Bahrain by local elements in the light of what occurred at Aden in connection with the reorganization of the police there. At Aden it was decided in 1928 that the armed section of the police should consist of 200 locally recruited men, and that for the period required to recruit and tram the new force, a section of armed Indians should be engaged for temporal/ service, a section of 100 armeu Indians was organized accordingly. The recruitment of Arabs for the permanent lores began in September 1930. the time for the diebandment of the temporary Indian force was approaching however it was pointed out by the local authorities that the Arab as an armed policeman is an unknown quantity and that difficulties were experienced in securing efficient Arab officers. The Resident accordingly proposed for reasons of security that one third of the «. r INDIA FOREIGN 3 ECRETA*P£ al armed force should be recruited in India, and that ! [ Lftltar No 37 U. j : i, i ftd 10 MAR 193? ^R&lt;X;dv(the compoeition of the force should be re-exaiained after a period of 3 years. The Government of India recommended these proposals to Mis Majesty 1 s Government by whom they have been accepted. 2. In view of the above I am to request that you will consider whether it would not be safer to observe the same principle regarding the retention of the Indian element in the Bahrain police. Your views may kindly be communicated to the Government of India at an early date. I have the honour to be» Sir, Tour most obedient servant, Sd/- F.V. Wylie, Beput&gt; secretary to tne Government of India#OOPY OF P.Z.1332/32. CONFIiiEHTIAL. Copy of a letter No. C-7 of 1931, Camp, Bahrain, dated the 22nd January 1932, from the Hon’hle Lieutenant- Colonel H.V.Biscoe, I.A., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, New Delhi. I have the honour to invite a reference to Major Fowle 1 s letter No. 1449, dated 11 th July,1931, re arcling the finances of the Bahrain State. Unfortunately Captain Prior’s anticipation tnat the current year would see a further deficit has been realised, and it is essential that further measures of economy should be adopted. 2. During my recent visit to Bahrain I had a long discussion with the Political &gt;».gent and the Adviser re arding the financial situation of the Principality. Mr. Belgrave informed me t.*at the expenditure was now exceeding the revenues by about Rs. 8 , 000 /- a month and the situation was deteriorating and that the time had now come when, in his opinion, it was essential to tabe further steps to reduce expenditure and increase revenue. At the beginning of the present financial year (the Arabic year starts in I4sy at present) the State had a balance in the Bank of Rs. 1,13,856, in addition to its reserve of Bs.3,00,000. This sum is now exhausted, partly on current expenditure and partly on capital expenditure, namely the extension of electric light to Muharraq, which it is hoped will ultimately produce revenue, and it will be necessary to draw on the reserve. 3. Finally four measur# were proposed, which it was hoped would meet the immediate necessities of tne situation and Mr. Belgrave said he would submit them for consideration to the Deputy Ruler. These measures were as follows:&lt; 3 &gt; ® (a) That on the expiration of his present contract in September next, the services of Captain Parke should not be renewed and that the Adviser should hold charge of the police in addition to his own duties for a year at any rate as he has done when Captain Parke has been on leave. (b) That the Indian Police should be replaced by local men as their contracts expire. (c) That application should be made to the Government of India for permission to increase the customs dues by a small extent, and (d) That a small land tax (Zakat) should be levied on agricultural produce. 4. I suggested to Mr. Belgrave that if Shaikh Hamad approved of these proposals he should submit them to the Political Agent, who in turn would address me on the subject, in order that I might refer them to the Government of India. I have now received an official communication Ho.C»9 from the Political Agent, of which I enclose a copy for the 17.1•32. information of the Government of India. 5. As regards the reduction of the appointment of Commandant of Police, I would invite a reference to the correspondence ending with Foreign and Political Department letter No. F.164-N/29, dated the 19th January 1931, in which the approval of the Government of India was accorded to the retention of Captain Parke for a further period of at least one year. Captain Parke has, I know, been looking about for an appointment outside Bahrain for some time past but informed me that he would, in any event, stay over the summer, when he was acting for Mr. Belgrave, who was on leave. He himself is proceeding on leave in the spring and his contract expires in September, and having regard to the need for economy I agree with the Political Agent’s proposal that it should notnot be renewed and that the post should, for the time being, be left vacant. Mr. Belgrave has twice for a period of six months on each occasion, held charge of the Police in addition to his own work and inform* me that he can do so in future, though possibly there may be some slight loss of efficiency. In view of the necessity for economy, however, this must be faced. The difficulty will arise two years hence when Mr. Belgrave goes on leave. It has been customary in the past for Captain Parke to act for him and it is essential to have someone in Bahrain who can perform the duties of the Adviser during Mr. Belgrave f s absence. In any case, however, I think the post of Commandant of Police may be left vacant for a year and a half and the question of appointing some other officer to it can be reconsidered in the autumn of 1933. 6 . As mentioned in my telegram Ko. T-21 dated the 21st January 1932, the Bahrain Government have already inf rmed Captain Parke that it is not their intention to extend his contract. It was explained to me that they had dene this, as after the question had been discussed with Shaikh Hamad, they thought it better to let Captain Parke know without delay, as the matter would certainly have got round to him from private sources. 7. The Bahrain police force at present consists of 48 Indians, 57 Arabs and 121 nathreNi. The latter are local men who areunarmed and merely do watch and ward duties in the bazaar. The regular police form what would be termed in India anil armed reserve. The Indians are undoubtedly costly since a sepoy draws 35/- pay, plus rations, which formerly cost Hs.lo/- but now cost about Hs.lo/-}, plus uniform* and passages to their homes every two years. The Arabs draw Rs.25/- plus i rations and uniforms while the native^et Hs.25 and no extras. VThe object of having Indians in the police force was to preserve the peace among the heterogeneous elements which comprise the poltilation of these Islands in the event of riOuS. The number of Indians, however, has been gradually reduced to 48 and the Araos increased to 57, and I am informed that the latter are now proving satisfactory and it is believed that they could be relied upon in an emergency. However, the various elements of the Bahrain community have for some years nww lived together in peace and amity ana the danger of intercommunal rioting has certainly diminished though it has probably not entirely disappeared. The risk therefore of having a force composed entirely of Araos is not a great one ana the financial situation justifies, or rather necessitates, running a slight risk. As the Political Agent points out, the substitution of Arabs for the remaining Indians would effect a saving of about xis. 6,000 - in addition to the cost of passages and leave pay. 8 . Under Article 4 of the Bahrain Treaty of 1861 the State is precluded from increasing its customs duties above 5$. As pointed out by the Political Agent, such a restriction is hardly in keeping with modern views in such matters and I support his proposal that the otate should be freed from this restriction and be granted tariff autonomy. As ^aptain Prior points out, the risk of abu e of this concession is slight since the mercantile community wields much influence and I think we could ensure that any advice which we tendered regarding the tariff would be accepted. It is the intention of the State only to raise the duty on such articles as silks, perfumes, motor cars, etc., and to refrain from additional taxes on the necessaries of life. 9. As regards the advisability of imposing *zakat f I have not at present arrived at a definite conclusion. In principle the tax is legitimate and a recognised levy in Muhammedan countries. Whether, when the details are worked®) out^ It will be found to be advisable to impose it in Bahrai where special conditions prevail, I am not yet certain, and should therefore like to reserve my opinion re^ardin^; the imposition of zakat until the matter has been gone into in greater detail. 10. The great difficulty in balancing the Bahrain budget is the question of the allowances drawn by the ruling family. Till recently these allowances amount to 50$ of the total revenues of the State, namely 5 lakhs out of a revenue or 10 lakhs. A cut of 10 c /o has already been effected inch© family allowances with the full concurrence of Shaikh Hamad. This has effected a saving of as.50,000/- but even so, owing to the fall in revenue, the family allowances amount no# to 57$ of the total income ol the State. A further cut is not feasible at present but it may be possible to effect some reduction on the demise of some of the pre sent holders. A cut in the pay of all Government officials and a further cut in the A1 Khalifa allowances may be found necessary if the situation continues to deteriorate. 11. It is anticipated that these proposals in a full year would produce about as.43,000 made up as follows Temporary abolition of the post of Hs. Commandant of Police. 14,000 Substitution of Arabs for Indians. 6,000 Increase of customs dues 8,000 Zakat, if imposed, about 15,000 Total 43,000 Thio will not enable the otate to balance its budget and it will be necessary for them to draw on their reserve, vfoich was created to enable them to meet such a crisis as the present. Having regard to the present financial difficulties cf all classes of the community increased taxation would not at the present juncture bring in much, and would be greatly resented so long as substantial reserves were known to exist.these matters so that the State may he enabled to reorganise iti t finances without further delay,CONFIDENTIAL. Copy of a letter No C/9 of 1932, dated Political agency, Bahrain, the 17th January 1932, from the Political Agent, Bahrein, to the Hon*ble the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to say that the Bahrain Governin' nt have not found it possible to meet current expenditure by revenue despite drastic economies, the figures for the first six months of the Arabic year showing a deficit of Hs.31,625/- on the budget estimates and a deficit of Hs.110,420/- upon the figures of the first half years of 1349 2. No further economy appears possible in the administration and building and similar non-productive expenditure has been reduced to a minimum. His Excellency Shaikh Hamad has reviewed the situation and decided upon two economies and two sources of additional revenue. Three of these will require the concurrence of the Government of India, the fourth being a matter the Shaikh is competent to decide without further reference. 3. The ,wo measures of economy are the reduction of the appointment of Captain Parhe and the substitution of local men for the fifty remaining Indian Police. Captain Parke costs the State some Hs.14,000/- per annum and local men could be secured for Hs.25/- per mensem and compared with the x^s.35/- now paid to the Indian Police thereby resulting in an annual saving of Hs. 6 , 000 /- apart from a considerable sum now expended on passages and leave pay. 4. The two additional sources of revenue are increased Customs 1 dues on luxuries and the levy of zakat upon the date gardens. If the Customs 1 dues upon the former v ere raised from 5 /&amp; to 7^&gt; an approximate additional revenue of Hs. 8 , 000 /- may be expected and a large impost wouldnot be likely to increase the figure. The yield of the zakat has not yet been calculated and it will be very difficult to form an estimate for a Revenue Department as the terra is understood in India does not exist in Bahrain. 5. Another economy that was considered was a cut in salaries over a certain amount, but, since a cut would only produce a saving of some Rs.500/- a month this is not being put into force at the moment, though it will be necessary later if conditions do not improve. 6. I consider that the proposals are practical and I recommend their adoption. Captain Parke has little to do save during the six months in every third year that he acts for Mr. Belgrave, and he does not seem able to give Air. Belgrave as much assistance as one might have expected during the remainder of t ie time. His contract expires after the conclusion of his leave in September this year and it is proposed that his contract should simply not be renewed. His administration of the Indian Police has not impressed me and I consider that the State can do very well without his services until Mr. $elgrave goes on leave in 1934 By that time the recreation ornretention of the post of Assi tant Adviser could be recon’idered and the answer would probably be found in the state of the pearl market,which is the real ruler of Bahrain. 7. I heartily recommend the early disbandment of the Indian Police whose contract expire during the summer of this year. The climate does not suit them or their wives, several of whom have died, and their duties which consist of a ceaseless and wearisome tour of guard duties do little to retain their interest. They are growing steadily slacker and are by no means a credit to the Indian Army in which all at one time or another, receivedreceived their training. The danger from the Dowasir, a coneideration which led to their formation, no longer exists, and local men, who are now available in sufficient numbers owing to the local depression, could be trained without difficulty to carry out their duties. These men would be simpler in every way to deal with and would have the inestimable advantage of speaking Arabic, the ignorance of which has been a great drawback to the Punjabis. 8 . As regards the increase in Customs dues, 1 feel that the time has come when the State, subject to the advice of the ioliuii_-'.AL Resident, should be allowed to fix such rates as it pleased. At a time when the Government of India, and for that matter, almost every country in the world, are doubling anu trebling duties that are already higfc, I feel that it is inequitable to bind a State like Bahrain that depends on its customs for nine-tenths of its revenue to a five per cent duty. The merchant community are extremely vocal in Bahrain and would'' not hesitate to express themselves freely if the duties were greatly increased, and this wholesome check, coupled with the ao.vicc o: the Political Resident should ensure that this new privilege was not abused. Nevertheless, when returning roseerily again increased the ’ustoms dues to the high figures of past years it would benecessiry to see that the Ruling Family, who already receive 57% of the current revenue, did not appropriate the lion’s share of the enhanced taxation. lhe zaica “ infallibly be passed on by the owners of date gardens to their unfortunate tenantry, who already live near the starvation line but sakat is the only tax which is really lawful in the eyes of the strict iiuslim and a very high -ate is collected by Bin Sa’ud in the Qatif and Hofuf oases. His Excellency proposes at present to levy ’ashur’, i.e., a tenth of the produce,andthou^i this may be difficult to collect it will be infinitely preferable to a fixed rate expressed in rupees which bears hardly when dates fetch a low price as they do at the moment. Since His Excellency is/is convinced of the usefulness of this tax and since no form of land tax exists I surest that you should inform him that the proposal may be acted upon. 10* One point requires mention. So immediate economy will result from the reduction of Captain Parke*s post or the substitution of local men for Indians since the former will receive full nay till September and there will be a time when both local men and Indians will have to be paid since the recruits will take time to train. The ultimate economy, however, is obvious. I request, therefore, that these two proposals and the request for permission to levy enhanced customs dues be referred to toe Government of India, with your approval for an early decision. The levy of zakat reouires no reference, but His Excellency will probably expect a word from you before nutting it into force.A PUT AWM Wilti , o Copy of a letter No.6173/2:-D, dated Bombay Castle, the 13th NoYember 1929, from the Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Home Department, to the Secretary to the Government \f India in the foreign and Political Department. -k 4 \ D eput at ion .
