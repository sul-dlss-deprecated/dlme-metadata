His oral history (which complements a financial history of AUC he wrote), offers a detailed view of the university’s financial condition and administrative operations, which he connects to world events, developments in the Egyptian economy (such as Sadat’s Open Door Economic Policy), and relations with Egypt’s government in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. British by birth, Snaith came to AUC in the mid-1970s to work with its endowment operations, and he details the multi-decade evolution of AUC’s investment management as well as its funding sources, including U.S. government support. Snaith covers major developments during each of the presidents under whom he served (in particular AUC’s expansion of campus, enrollment, and academic programs and restoration to financial health under President Richard Pedersen), as well as their styles of leadership and the role played by the Board of Trustees. The relationship between finances and developments in the academic sphere is addressed, and major issues concerning student tuition and faculty compensation emerge including resistance to tuition hikes, moves to address discrepancies in salary and benefits between foreign and local hires, and the controversy over attempts under President Donald McDonald to mandate a retirement age for Egyptian faculty in the 1990s. The practices of AUC’s financial units are covered in detail, including structural changes, computerization and the adoption of new systems (like the major SAP implementation), and challenges related to operating in two currencies. He mentions the contributions of important individuals in the Controller’s Office, Purchasing, and other units, and touches on personnel practices and office dynamics including religion and gender diversity issues. Snaith speaks at length about the motivations for, planning, funding, and financial operations and implications of AUC’s relocation to a new campus in New Cairo in the first decade of the 21st century, detailing the key decisions and individuals and entities (such as contractors) involved. Research units supported in large parts by external grants, like the Desert Development Center and Social Research Center, and auxiliary enterprises (like the AUC Press, student housing, and food services) are also covered in detail.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
