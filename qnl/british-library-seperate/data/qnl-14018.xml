Parts of the city due south of the mosque are visible in the middle ground. (Compare, for example, X463/1.)In the left of the image on the horizon, the fortified structure known as ‘Jiyad Castle’ is visible. The large building on the right is identified in the title as the ‘Hamidiyah’, a two-storey building which is described in the title of a photograph in Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje’s earlier publication of 1888,
                           Bilder-Atlas zu Mekka(1781.b.6/4) as a government building built by Governor General Othman Pascha. This was likely constructed during the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Abdulhamid II (1876–1909) and was therefore relatively new.The two-storey pale-coloured building to the left of this is identified as the ‘printing house’ (cf. X463/6).Derelict or semi-derelict structures make up the foreground while hills rise in the background.This is the first of four photographs taken from the same vantage point, which form a panoramic view over the city of Mecca. The second, third and fourth are X463/3, X463/4 and X463/5 respectively.InscriptionsAbove image, on the right, in ink: ‘II’Lower centre and upper centre: Illegible, partially erased Arabic script</abstract><typeOfResource>still image</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Photograph</genre><subject><topic>Landscape photography</topic></subject><subject><topic>Historic buildings</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023514790.0x000002#share">Public Domain</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
