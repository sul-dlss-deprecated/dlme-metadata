MaM. 1. Although the SheriP did not issue his Proclamation to the world until some days later, the Arab Revolt in the Hej.tz mav be said to have begun on the 5th June, 1916, when a cordon of Arabs under the command of two of the Sherif s sons, Feisal and Ali, was drawn up round Medina. The Hejaz railway line was at once attacked at several points, but the Arabs, inexpert in demolition work, were unable to e$e&lt;-t serious damage before being driven off by parties of Turks with machine guns. Traffic was, therefore, not seriously interrupted and the Turkish line of communication to Damascus remained intact. Nor could the Arabs, who were short of arms and supplies and who had but few guns, do more than invest Medina from a distance. They, however, attacked Jeddah on the 9th June, and the garrison, cut otf from Mecca by the loss of the blockhouses on the road, and exposed to naval guns and aeroplanes, yielded to the demands of the civil population and surrendered about a week later. About three weeks later the weak garrison remaining in Mecca, after the summer move of thw Governor-General to Taif,al8o surrendered. This latter place held out until the 23rd September after having been blockaded about three and a half months by Sherif Abdulla, the Sherif of Mecca s second son, with a mixed force of Bedouins and Meccan townsfolk. Though regularly bombarded it had never really been assaulted. Smaller places such as Lith and Yambo had surrendered as soon as they were - seriously attacked, and by the end of September, 1916 , the greater part of the Hejaz was clear of troops, though the railway still remained intact. 2. Meanwhile Turkish reinforcements had been rapidly sent from the north, and the situation at Medina was radically changed, t The Turkish forces, which had been strengthened, re-armed, re-victualled and re-assured by successful sorties during these past four months, were able in September to march out and, driving the Arabs before them, to make Medina secure by establishing a cordon of fortified posts at a distance of about 30 miles from the town along the roads leading to Mecca. They time (the end of October) threatened to occupy Rabegh and Yambo, but, with a ration strength of about 14,000, they appear not to have felt capable of holding such distant posts together with their long lines of communication ; and considerable Arab forces having moved up from the south and south-west they withdrew again towards the end of 1916 to behind the line of fortified outposts and to the town itself. (6144 19) * See Appendix a. j Sec Appendix 0* In addition to this force at Medina, known as the Hejaz Expeditionary iorce, a Comp&lt;ieite Force under Jemal III* of which the strength « January, 1U!. • s so.ue 5.000 rations, was establish^ with headquarters at Tebuk, and another loreet ( -oneist'iu' in June. 1917, of four battalions) had its headquarters at Maan. To these forces were Slpporti^ed tbied sections of the line, each having small garrisons posted at the various stations in its area. 4 The Arab forces, though numerically strong, lacked guns and supplies. They were deficient in small arms, equipment and organization, client JheisaI, who at the outbreak of the revolt commanded the Sheritial iorces in the .Ltxlina area, i;u uit.T camos of some 10,000 men each, but no single camp had as many as 2,000 rifles ; contingents of men joined or feft at will, and his troops were quite inexperienced m the art of modern warfare. Steps were taken to organize, arm and equip the Arabs, and towards the end of 1916 they were formed into three independent groups, one under Sherif Ali, about 8,000 strong, facing Medina on the south, another under Shenf Abdulla, numbering some 4,000 men, encirclinij Medina on the east and north-east,^whii*' Sherif Feisal, with some 8,000 to 9,000 men, the pick of the force, was based on Yamb^ and operated against the railway. Such supreme command as was exercised appears to have been vested in Sherii Hussein personally with Aziz l&gt;o\ &lt;4 Masn as uuaslt i of War. 5. By this time it had become clear that little was to be hoped from an Arab siege of Medina, and even less from any assaults the Arabs might be induced to make on its works. The operations which suggested themselves as likely to produce the most fruitful results were systematic raids on the Hejaz railway, which, from Medina to Damascus, consists of some 800 miles of single track. But, to enable these to be carried out and also to extend the revolt to the north towards Syria, it was necessary to have more northerly bases. With this object in view Sherif Feisal with his northern army installed himself at Wejh, already occupied by landing parties, in Januarys 1917, and proceeded to extend his hold further to the north towards Dhaba and Moweilah on the Red Sea coast. His brother Sherif Abdulla had meanwhile moved with his force to Wadi A is, north-west of Medina; while his other brother, Sherif Ali, remained in his old place south and south-west of that town. The raiding carried out during the following six]; months, with British and French assistance, lowered the strength and spirit of the Turkish forces at Medina, and attracted many fresh Arab elements, but it did not isolate that town. The railway line proved harder to wreck permanently, and the enemy better prepared to effect repairs, than had been expected. Demolition work without hope of loot and any dogged occupation of points on the broken track did not appeal to the Bedouins, and it was not till the autumn of 1917 that a different policy, that of mining trains, with the attraction of consequent plunder, was acted upon. This immediately produced more satisfactory results, but the Arabs could not be induced to complete the destruction oi a train or of the permanent way before starting to search for plunder. 6. Meanwhile, Akaba had been captured on the 6th July by a Sherifial force, accompanied by Lawrence,§ and Sherif Feisal moved there in July, 1917, thus enabling operations and propaganda to be extended much farther to the north. The railway • See Appendix D. t See A p pendix ( , .v + fell on the 11th March. This event does not seem to have reacted on the Hejaz situation to - L ' / l ^ ei1 possibly owing to the lack of cohesion which was still apparent m August, 1918, between different factions in Arabia. • + § ' &lt;4 tvn Law rente left ^ ejh on the 9th May, 1917, with a few men and Sherif Naair, with the bLTfor the Arab^orces 16 ^ Nurthern ^ejaz tribes, and, if possible, to open Akaba for use as a supply O-f ^. ur i Staalan, but on hearing he was north Lawrence proceeded to Nebk, near Md*Howeitat the P?™** SheSf Nasir remained in Qaf to enrol Rualla, Sherarat Ba'tlix^k where he blew\ ^ w ^' e Lawrence proceeded north to near Tadmur and thence west to ^Salk^'a^n the^)ru^ /'f Wa ' ,r *-| ,r and t ^ ence sout ^ to within o miles of Damascus; thence \bout the end of June law aIK om t ^ re . 1,0 Azrak, where he saw Nuri Shaalan and his son, Nawwai. tKm ¥ on ^ 30th they moved to El defer, east of Maan, Maan-Ak»baroad\ where the eendamp\» 8 fhld^^ r o v r?

Despite the British set-back at Gaza in March, 1917, Maan itself was threatened by the Arab forces, as w^s also the forests district ol Hishe to the north-west, whence the Turks were drawing-Hheir fuel supply tor the railway.* The effect on Medina was soon evident, and had the Turks been able to evacuate the whole or part of the garrison and the force Immediatelv to its north by means of the railway it is probable that they would have done so. A programme was drawn up in November, 1917, in anticipation of the fall of Jerusalem for the evacuation of part of the Medina garrison, after which the Tebuk force was to be evacuated. 1 he British victory at Bir Saba and Gaza occurred in September, 1917, and with the development of the British threat on Jerusalem, the situation of the Turkish forces on the railway was recognized by their leaders to be serious. The staff officer left in charge at Maau during the temporary absence of Jemal Ill.t reported to him on the 7th November his view on the situation. He appositely compared the attitude of ths Arabs to a gangrene which had begun in the finger (Medina), which, if not cut off would spread to the hand (Maan) and finally to the arm (Syria). Fakhri Pasha at Medina replied to Jemal I. on the 12th November , regarding the proposed evacuation of Medina, that the movement might prove the dawn of the ' Fourth Age.' No autiioritative explanation of the expression is forth coming, but it is believed that according to Mahommedan tradition when the '' Third Age comes to an end the Turkish Empire will cease to hold the predominant position in fslatn. ♦ V? The evacuation of Medina was to be completed within 75 days, but the Turks were, and have remained, unable to carry it out owing to lack of rolling stock, want of fuel, the impossibility of accumulating sufficient supplies, and constant interruptions of the railway. 7. By the end of 1917 Felsal had secured the adhesion or neutrality of all the Arabs as far up as Maan and had come to an agreement with others in the north,! and could thus contemplate an advance further north into the Trans-Jordan country. He had collected mere partly trained troops and Bedouins. He w r as also much better equipped with guns, sm ill arms und auxiliary services than hitherto. The Turks in Maan and in the Hishe Forest area made attempts to dislodge him from the Petra region in October and November, 1917, but they were too weak to press home any advantage they gained. On the other hand, the cold experienced in this mountainous region militated against a strong offensive by the Arabs, 8. The situation therefore at the end of 1917 was, briefly, as follows ; — The Turks had been completely driven from the Hejaz except from the actual railway ; the Hejaz Expeditionary Force at Medina, now reduced to some 11,000 rations, was reduced in efficiency and suffering considerable privation and sickness; the Composite Porce at Tebuk, reduced to some 1,500 rations was in a similar state, and traffic between these places was being constantly interrupted owing to the efiorts of Sherif All in the area south-west of Medina, and Abdulla in the area between Medina and El Ula. Further north Sherif Feisal was operating against the railway in the Maan area and had seriously interfered with the fuel supply in the liishe forest. I he Turks found it necessary to establish a post at Tadmur to prevent the^ Arab movement spreading to the Euphrates, and to establish line of communication posts on the bTermuk Valley and Deraa—Maan railways. During the period under review the Arabs had engaged the Turks on some 54 occasions, inflicting casualties§ (according to Arab reports) amounting to 3,400 killed, 757 wounded, while the captures amounted to 6,7G6 prisoners, 44 guns, 11 machine guns and 2,417 rifles, [j Arab reports also recorded 42 attacks on the railway, during which 7 engines. 3 wagons, 7,770 rails, 34 bridges and 16 culverts had been destroyed.^ * A light railway ran from Aneiza (second station north of Maan) into the lliahe iorest, 'ittd was ustid to transport wood fuel for the use of the engines on the Uejaz Railway. ihis line was pulled up at thf beginning of 1918. t See Appendix D. * See Appendix L. § Appendix &gt;s ' 11 This information cannot he taken as strictly reliable, but Sir R.

(0144,-19) A 2Q |Vfore doslixr the summnrv of this pt-rioil mention should be made of t!ie TnrkUh -.ilv Ibn Hashid* Emir of'flail, who, after a profitless journey to the LoO district in June, 1916, had returned to Ilail.t In Anril. 19!?, he w iu( defeated near Hanakiyah; (see note to paragraph 24) bv a ShenfiaT h.rce, aud, losing H k -(nvaier part of h^strength, fled to the Turks at Medain Saleh, where he amW Witb about 1.000 men on the 17t.]&gt; August, while Teima, his most westerly possession. fVll to Shprlti.-d forces. His presence at Medain Saleh at once became a source of :i nnova n ee to the Turkish commander at Medina, owing to Ibn Rashid's exorbitant irequent remonstrances to headquarters, Fakhri Fasha at Medina was instructed that Ibn Knsiiid was to be looked on as a trusted Ally and should be treated in all respects an honoured tr U ,vst ; and at the end of 1^17 he was stdl in his camp east of the railway, 'near Medain Saleh. Though thev were unable to make any real headway against the Arab movement the Turks^at German instigation were not altogether idle in their efforts to deal with i I k 1 situation politically during the above period. The ex-Khedive returned from Switzerland to Turkey in October, 1917, and proceeded to Syria. About the same time Maurice§ visited Berlin and Syria before emerging at Akaba. He gave information indicating that the Germans were endeavouring to reconcile the Turks with the Arabs {see Appendices E. and F). The Germans also formed an ' Arab Bureau' under Yelder em at Damascus and there were signs that their efforts were not entirely devoid of success {see Appendix A). Period Isi January, 1918, to date. 10. January. —As above stated, the cold weather in December, 1917, had interfered with active operations in the northern area, but in January, 1918 , Feisal s Arabs based on Akaba were able to begin an advance towards the country south-east of the Dead Sea. On the 1st January, 1918 , armoured cars raided Tel s Shahm station (6 stations south of Maan) damaging buildings and destroying several trucks. On the 3rd, Feisal s troops occupied the Turkish position of Aba Lissan (15 miles south-west of Maan), and, about the same date, Sherif Nasir, with Abu Tavyljj and Belli Sakhr,^ tribesmen, occupied Shobek in the Hlshe area, while Arabs also occupied railway bridges south of Maan near Ghadir el Haj. Between the 3rd and the 7th, Sherif Nasir s force occupied Jurul ed Derwish station (3 stations north of Maan), remaining in occupation for 3 days during which rolling stock and a bridge were damaged. Some 80 Turks were killed, while -00 with a gun and machine gun were captured. A separate attack between Juruf ed Derwish and K1 llasa (4 stations north of Maan) resulted in 25 Turks being killed and manv wounded, and a further 50 prisoners were taken in a raid on Kalaat Aneiza (2 stations north of Maan). On the 14th, the Arabs occupied Tafilah (20 miles north of Shobek), capturing 150 prisoners, including the Kaiinakam, Negib Bey. On the 15th January, 14 Turks were killed near Kalaat es Zerka, and on the 22nd an Arab force, in conjunction with .) Hntish aeroplanes and a motor 10-pr. gun section attacked the line south o* Maan near Mudowere (8 stations south of Maan) capturing or killing 20 'lurks. On the. wMii Jannarv an attempt by the Turks to recapture Tatilah failed, their force, numbering some 800 men, 27 machine guns and 2 guns, being severely defeated in the Seil el Hesa. *' S V« Vjtpendix C. . wh en Turkish prestige jn Mesopotamia was hi^h after the capture of the British garrison a i n ^ WRS near Zubair ■with a small followiDjr; His Wazir, Saleh Ibn Subhan had alreach TntT 0 ' /''f' u J 0 !''' 1 ^ le '^'ish camp m Mesopotamia.

In the southern area Sherif Ali raided Hafira (2 stations north of Medina) on ■ 13th January, killing / 1 urks and destroying 1 kilometre of railway and a bridge, and on the 18th his forces attacked a large Turkish convoy about 8 miles east of Medina, capturing prisoners and much booty, including 17,000/. in specie. On the 20tli ^ her it Abdullah, in an attack on the line near Hedieh (9 stations north of Medina), destroyed some 1,500 rails, 19 culverts and 6 kilometres of telegraph line, the Turks having about (&gt;0 casualties ; and on the 23rd he took 17 prisoners in an attack on a Turkish post between Wadi Ethil and Dar el Haj (just south of Tebuk). 12. During the month of February the Arabs brought down an enemy aeroplane east of Aneiza station in the northern area, while to the south Sherif Abdulla attacked the railway south of Hedieh, killing 20 Turks, capturing 30, and claiming to have destroyed 3,000 rails and 7 culverts. In another attack between Bir Jedid and Toweira (10 stations north ot Medina) he destroyed 7 miles of railway and 12 culverts, while south of Wadi Ethil an engine and 2 trucks were derailed, 3 men being killed and 20 captured. Sherif Ali, in an operation south-west of Medina, killed 15 Turks, captured 12,.some animals and manv rities. Thus, during the first two months of the year 1918, Sherif Feisal's forces had occupied Shobek, in the Hishs fuel area, and Tafilah, some 20 miles to the north, and had successfully resisted a strong attempt by the Turks to recapture the latter place, inflicting severe casualties on them. In the Southern Hejaz, Sherifs Ali and Abdulla had carried out operations with considerable success. About this month King Hussein wrote two friendly but very depressed letters to Sir R. Wingate, in which he hinted at suicide. He was evidently much upset by the Allies pro-Zionist (see Appendix G) declarations regarding Syria, and feared political bankruptcy in the event of his inability to vindicate his revolt before the Moslem world. A reassuring message was communicated to him by His Majesty's Government. (See bottom of paragraph 13.) 13. By the beginning;, of March a marked change became noticeable in the handling of the situation east (&gt;f the Jordan bv the enemy. This was probably due to German direction and realisation of the intimacy between the Arab operations and British opera tions in Palestine. Further reorganization had taken place and German troops had been sent to the scene of action, while N iedermayer,* the German tribal agent, appeared at Am ma*,. This resulted in the concentration at Juruf ed Derwish and Kutrani of a striking force of sufficient strength to push back Feisal's Arabs, while the nucleus of a reserve was maintained at Amman, presumably to ensure the holding ot the .lericho road #hile the Arabs were being dealt with. On the 2nd March the Turks from Jurut ed Derwish and Kutrani advanced in two converging columns in an endeavour to reoccupy Tafilah On the 7th Sherif Zeid evacuated the town and fell back towards Shobek. During the Turkish concentration their camps were heavily bombod by British aircraft. Bv the 8th the Arabs were occupying a line running roughly east and west through Shobek, Tafilah being occupied by the Turks on the 12th. In March King Hussein was again showing sign of anxiety. The enemy known to be now spending large sums of money and increasing their propaganda* jt the tribesmen. This, coupled with the difficult situation of Sherif Abdulla, who considerable difficulties over his payments to his own forces, increased the Ivings anxiety. 14 However, General A llenby 's advance towards Amman, ^ hi i w is m j l ' the 21st March, caused the withdrawal of this Turkish mobile column towards Amman and Es Salt, and on the 18th March the Arabs reoccupied Tafilah and pushed on towards the Sell el Hesa, there b.-ing every indication that the Turks, having for th^ time being attained their object of interposing a sufficient force between the British and the Arabs, did not intend to leave .any troops south of a line from the bed el Hosa to Kutrani. though a detachment was left by them at this latter place to defend t .ie iai \\a\ line to Amman. As a result of the redistribution of their forces^ the Maan gainson numbered at this time about 2,800 rifles. 15. Meanwhile, though subjected to frequent attacks, the railway south of Maan to Medina had not been permanently damaged, although tralhc had been very «^' 1(nis &gt; interfered with. On an average there was one through train from Damascus to Uet ma * See Ap^&gt;endix F. there can be little doubt that its end in Paris. f See Appendix II. I See Appendix 0. It must be remembered that this w.n oo the eve of the -eat German offensive ami hat the Turks fostered, with some success, the idea that the Arab revolt would liu ■I npr week each way. The line was divided into five sections one day being required to traverse each section or a total of five days for the whole d,stance as again. . pre-war timing of 11 hours. Although the programme tor the evacuation of Medina had been so mterfered with that it had been impossible to carry it through iiaraeraph G), the early evacuation of the Hejaz from Medina to Maan was again under conslrleration, and arrangements were made tor the rapid removed northwards ol Xcnments. money and telegraph instruments, &amp;C., from Medina, Medam Saleh, El Ula and Tebuk. 16 In April, Sherif Feisal's armv, divided into three columns, was operating in the Maan are- 1 as follows :-Iiis soiitlu 'rn column captured and blew up Ghadir el Haj station on the 11th, destroying 1,000 rails and 40 Dridges and cuherts, but the lurks recaptured the remains of the station on the 12th. Bir es Shedia station was also attacked, and the line south of Maan received damage which the enemy estimated would take at least a month to repair.^ In these operations the I urkish casualties amounted to five officers and 220 other ranks Feisals northern column destroyed 200 rails just north of Maan, and on the 13th captured and burnt Jerdun station, taking 200 prisoners and two machine guns, while the ondge over Wadi Jerdun and 159 rails were destroyed. On the 13th the central column stormed the Semna position, 5,000 yards south-west of Maan, and captured a machine gun and 30 prisoners. 1 he attack was continued on the 14th and 15th ; on the 16th Maan was surrounded, while on the 1/ th the station was temporarily occupied by the Arabs who, however, subsequenilv withdrew and occupied th© outer defences. Two more machine guns and 70 prisoneis were captured during these operations. _ , About the 20th April, the stations o^ Batn el Ghul, AN adi Kethem, tel es Shahm and Ramleh, south of Maan, were captured and burnt by a detachment of the Egyptian Camel Corps and British armoured cars, and important bridges and telegraph lines were destroyed. Tel es Shahm station surrendered with 52 prisoners, 450 boxes of bombs, and 280,000 rounds of small-arm ammunition ; a quantity of food-stuns was also captured. Minor attacks by tribesmen resulted in the capture o: prison* ro and a machine gun near Mudowere. ' ^. In the southern Hejaz, 700 rails and two culverts were destroyed between l^huk and El Ula, another 100 rails and three culverts between Matali and Abi^'l aka, 8 Turks being killed and 1 captured about the same period. South of hi ^ 1^ an Arab demolition party destroyed 560 rails, killing 7 Turks, while a force ^f Sherif Ali's attacked the line iust north of Medina, and destroyed a bridge apd 200 rails. 17. In spite of all Turkish attacks, Sherif Feisal's central column continued to hold the Semna position, and had thus succeeded in completely isolating Maan irom the south, and practically so from the north. About 1,000 casualties were inflicted on the Turkish forces in this area during April and May. 18. Owing to General Allenby's operations east of Jordan the Turks had been unable to send a strong force to the assistance of their Hejaz garrisons, but a small force sent from Kutrani managed to recapture the station at Jerdun, though it failed to get through to Maan. On the 12th May extensive demolitions were carried out by the Arabs at Batn el Ghul (south of Maau), 1,500 rails were destroyed as well as a large cutting. The enemy estimated this damage would take 500 men a month to repair, but as this demolition was carried out over very sharp winding curves, in what was originally the most difficult section to build on the whole Hejaz Hail way, it was probably irreparable owing to lack of material.* Meantime, the Arabs had continued operations further north capturing Ferifreand Hasa stations (45 and 35 miles respectively north of Maan), where extensive demolitions were carried out between the 2.dh and - s th May, which the enemy estimated would take 500 men 15 days to repair. Ihese stations were again occupied by the Arabs on the 30th. 19. Ihe Maan garrison was thus in difficulties, being cut off from the north with no prospect of supplies reaching them and with but 11 day's rations in hand. Medina now appeared to be really running short of supplies, for, on the i8th Apiil 1 akhri Pasha had reported that but I tt month's rations remained, and the extensive demolitions of the line south of Maan, which had rendered some 60 miles ot f 0 ^ 0 at V n1 ?!' l la T 7 et J )een ma( i e to mend the break in the line south of Maan by the end of Augrusl, nueud the^reak north'of ii erem or ^ ere( l the sector south of Maan to Ghadir el Ilaj to be pulled up to■ 4 m I i f i ■j i I •it •#: . «?

Southern Hejaz considerable demolitions were carried out by Sherifs Abdulla and Ali. On the Ist May at Bowat and Hafira, on the 10th at Abu Nairn, where the bridges over the Wadi Hamdh were attacked, on the 14th at Bir Jedid and Tovveira, where 800 rails were destroyed. At Mudurij on the same day 1,500 rails were destroyed. On the 19th the Bowat bridges were bombarded for four hours and a French demolition party destroyed 5 kilometres of railway, and in the same sector on the 22nd, French and Bedouin demolition parties destroyed 6 kilometres of railway and five culverts. 20. ! ! &gt;n Kasbid (see paragraph 9), who had remained in his camp near Medain Saleh, except for one minor raid from Jedaha during February, was suspected by the Turks of intrigue and had been kept practically a prisoner, while many of his followers had deserted him. About the end ot April or early in May he left his camp for Hail, but was intercepted by Sherif Abdulla's Bedouins near Teima, and in the engagement which ensued his entire transport was captured, 30 of his men killed and 31 taken prisoner, he himself escaping to Hail. 21. In .lune the railway was still and crafhc south of Maan had been at a st/inHst,!]! sinr»p the 11th April. t throughout the Maan to Mudowere sector and tratfic south of Maan had been at a standstill since North of Maan the railway was still cut as far as Juruf ed Derwish, but on 'the 12 th June a small Turkish concentration commenced at Kutrani with the object of reopening it. On the 16th a column with supplies left Kutrani. reoccupied Ferifre, and on the 18th entered Juruf ed Derwish, after having found EI Hasa unoccupied'. On the 19th the column, which had met with considerable Arab resistance, returned to Ferifre. Meanwhile, Maan remained invested, and between the 15th and 23rd was bombed three times by the Royal Air Force, in addition to which raids on a large scale were carried out on Kutrani. Three Turkish aeroplanes were seriously damaged. 22 . On the 22nd June, Sherif Nasir was attacked near Hasa by two battalions of Turks with machine guns and a battery of field artillery, who were driven back bv the Arabs to Ferifre after severe fighting in which they lost 20 killed and 15 prisoners. On the 24th the station and, camp at Amman were bombed. On the 27th, Feisals southern column destroyed a bridge south of Maan, and on the day following attacked and captured the station at Kalaat el Ahmar, the garrison surrendering. Following the capture of this station, Mudowere (next station to the north) was evacuated bv its garrison who attempted to reach Maan, but were practically all captured bv the Arabs. In Southern ilejaz, on the 21st June, Sherif Abdulla destroyed 200 rails, a bridge and 2 kilometres of telegraph line between Seil Matara and Meshed, while another 500 rails and three bridges were destroyed between Istabl Antar and Abu Naam. On the 29th , June a further 210 rails and two bridijes were destroyed in this O %/ neighbourhood. Dy^ntery was now reported to be rife in the Hejaz Expeditionary Force, and the food conditions were extremely bad, while scurvy had broken out at Tebuk ami Mudowere. 23. About the middle of June King Hussein's attitude again became difficult. He wired to his agent in Cairo expressing his disgust at the Anglo-French intentious regarding Syria, as alleged by Jemal Pasha in his farewell speech made at Beirut prior to his departure from Syria. King Hussein stated that this speech (made in November and widely quoted) had only just been brought to his notice. Though it was not known at the time, the Sherit's attitude was almost certainly influenced by uneasiness regarding a situation which had arisen at Khurma, about 80 miles east of Taif. This town, though undoubtedly in the Sherifial sphere of administration, had become contaminated by the spread of Wahabite influence through the Akhwan Society! * In this connection, ample evidence had been forthcoming to show that considerable convoys of supplies from Koweit were reaching' enemy destinations, both in the Uejaz and in Palestine. A proposal to establish a blockade cordon with the assistance of troops was found to be impracticable, and other measures were adapted. The Sheikh of Koweit, whose actions in the matter had not been above suspicion, waa cautioned, and gave assurances that he would make suitable arrangements and hold himself responsible that no such traffic should be carried on, and that all export of goods from Koweit to the interior should be carefully supervised and regulated. During March, April and May. 191i3, Gve couvoys airgregating 1,500 camels were captured east of Medina by detachments of Sherif Ali's Army. See Appendix K. t The Akhwan organization is centred in Riadh. It is a Bedouin society which exists to promote the spread of pure religion in the Wahabi sense among the different tribes of Arabia. The abolition of ail inter-tribal warfare is one of its cardinal doctrines. Three hundred and more of these Akhwan are being educated in Riadh to be the religious teachers of the different tribes. The society, entry into which appears to be easy, numbers many thousands in many different tribes, and enthusiastically supports the present ruling house in Riadh.which is centred in Riadh, with the result that the Governor of Khurma had defected to the W:iliabis. Hussein, at the instigation of Abdulla, despatched a punitive fen to Khunna which was ignorainousJy defeated. Though it is not clearly established that Ibn Saud, the Emir of Nejd, was directly responsible for the situation at Khurma, Hussein's instinctive fear of his rival was sufficient to suggest Wahabi designs against M.voa, HSssein feeling particularly vulnerable on account of the commitment of the most efficient part of his forces to the north under Feisal. There is no doubt that at this period the mind of King Hussein was in a thoroughly unsettled state, and that the long, simmering trouble between him and Ibn Saud was on the point of boiling over. 24. Letters from Ibn Rashid, interceinted by bedouins, showed that, although he had reached Hail paragraph 20), |i© was unable, owing to British preeauti^nsj to o!)tain supplies from Koweit. He complained bitterly of his treatment by the Turkish otiicers. particularly by Fakhri Pasha. In reply to a letter sent to him by Sh^riT At &gt; l 1 ulla offering him good t reagent if he threw over the Turks, he expressed his willingness to join the Sheritians, but asked for delay, probably with a view to consulting the Turkish political agent, Abdul Hamid, who was en route to join him, and to whom reference is made later, and in expectation of the arrival of his own agent; Rashid Ibn Leilah, * from Damascus, with two guns and two machine guns,f presents iVom the Turks. (His acrent was still m Damascus, July, 1918.) In the light of the .ibove-mentioned situation at Khurma the motive underlying Abdulla's overtures seenis rtrmarent. 25. On the 1st and 3rd July , Maan was bombed. On the 4th the Arabs attacked Jeriun and the railway, damaging the latter, and took 13 prisoners, exclusive of a Turkish picquet. On the 5tli, report® fr^tn Maan showed that there was no money to purchasa supplies, the garrison had lived on indifferent rations for two months, desertions, even among officers, had been frequent and animals were dying daily from starvation. On the 6th, the town was again bombed, and Jerdun was bombed on the Hth. On the 12th July it was reported that the railwav from the north had apparently been repaired as far as liasa. and on the 14th orders were issued that repairs to the north of Maan were to be effected bv removing rails from the line south of that place (see note to paragraph 18), but it was not anticipated that it would be completed through to Maan before the end of July. 26. On the 17th July a Turkish force, composed of two columns, concentrated at Kutrani and Samra respectively, with the object of operating against an Arab detach ment north-west of Kutrani. The Turks claimed to have encountered this force and to have driven it southwards in disorder, but this was not confirmed. On this date the food question at Maah was again reported to he critical ; rations and forage consumed daily amounted to three tons, while the weekly convoys from Juruf rarely carried more than nine tons. Ihe population had created disturbances and demanded to be allowed to proceed to Damascus if food was unobtainable at Maan; the Sheikhs hai held a meeting and passed a resolution deciding to co-operate w^th Feisal in the event of his attacking the town. On the 21st the Arabs attacked the line between Jerdun and Maan and held the line and its water supply up to the evening of the 23rd. The enem} s loss was considerable. Their relief column advancing towards Jerdun was engaged by the Arabs and forced to retire, though the Turks claimed to have inflicted ieavy casualties on the Arabs (our official reports say 70), and themselves admitted to 11 killed and 20 wounded. The Maan transport animals which were at Jerdun at the tone earrjing water and supplies, were all killed by shell fire, Maan thus being deprived o trauspoft. On the 20th and 23rd Maan was again bombed. 27. In the southern Hejaz the Arabs destroved 250 rails, some bridges and i Kftr ^- a L ^ orem ^ er ' 191 ^ when, as Ibn Rasbid's ag-ent, he visited Ajaimi es Saadun, l-f' ' ' . 0 ' m&gt; ' in'^ish soldiers, and in December. 1910, purchased certain stores in Nejf, for winch made l S a sa ^ e back to Hail through the tribes which lay on his road.

The whole party were killed or captured, Abdel Hamid el Masri being among the former. On the 17th, Fakhri Pasha represented die situation of his forces as serious and critical; he complained'bitterly of the way m which they had been neglected. He thought that Medina might be able to hold out till the beginning of Septem ber, when the new date harvest, which promised well (li,000 000 kilos), was due. hut douhted if the '2nd Composite force at Tehuk would he able to hold out so long. On the 3 1st, Sherif Ali made a successful raid against one of his posts south-west of Medina, killing about 50 Turks. 28. On the 1st August it was reported that Arab activity against the railway north of Milan continued and arrangements were being made for an extension ijoi thuaids^ of operations in the autumn. With this object in view, two companies of Imperial Camel Corps were en route to Akab :i. On the 5th August the enemy's |®Oficent ration at Kutrani was still proceeding. A small Turkish column with machine .runs and a convoy of 50 animals had succeeded in reaching Maan towards the end of -July. Repairs to the damaged line between Juruf ed Derwish and Jerdun continued. A proposal by the Commander at Jerdun to make an attack from that place against • Jafilali with the object of collecting the considerable quantities of grein in this area and ejecting the Arabs was discountenanced by the Officer Commanding Ilnd Army .Corpus, who condemned anv offensive at present far from the railway as premature, and considered it more important to clear the Arabs away from the line in the section Maan ||| to Aneiza. ISo attempt had as yet been made to repair the railway south of Mann {see note to paragraph 16). An aerodrome had been established by the Turks at Tebuk ith the object oi sending drugs and money to the Hejaz Expeditionary Force by air. ihe supply situation at jMaan had been temporarily improved by the arrival of a convov from Jerdun, and, on the 29th Ju ly, six days supplies were said to be available. The euccessful defence of Jerdun by the I urks had had a restraining influence on the Maan sheikhs, but a plot, in which Armenians and Arab officers were involved had been discovered by the i urks, who made several arrests. On the 8th August the Imperial Camel Corps detachment captured Mudowere station (5^ also paragraph 22) and killed 35 Turks and captured 120 with 2 guns and ^3 machine guns. Following on the capture of Mudowere, Haret el Amara, the next station to the south, was evacuated on the 9th. On the same day the Ilnd Army Corps decided to assume the offensive in the Maan area and gave orders for 15 days' food and foraire for 3,000 men and 500 animals to be collected at Hasa and Juruf ed Derwish. The attack column was to consist of the 2/73rd, 3/73rd, 1/75th, 2/75th, and a mule volunteer regiment, while another battalion, the l/l2th, reinforced the Maan garrison. On the 10th Fakhri Pasha* despatched a message of farewell as, in view of the fall of Mudowere, he considered Medina doomed, and on the llth the purchasing officer of the Hejaz Expeditionary Force at Damascus received orders to close his accounts and make no further purchases. ( ^n the 12th August Sherif Abdulla severely damaged the railway between Toweira and Bir .ledid and destroyed 2,000 rails, and captured 17 prisoners. On the same date Fakhri Pasha sent a further despondent message. He considered that \elderem were mainly responsible for his predicament, and stated he preferred to surrender or starve rather than be defeated by the Aral&gt;s at Medina, Enver Pasha yxpressed his appreciation of Fakhri s difficulties and considered that the onus of opening the railway developed not on the H.E F. but on Yelderem. The enemy were reported to be showing considerable interest in the Akhwant movement centred at Ritawia, 5 days east of Aneize, in Qasim. The Nejd men, in the service ot 11 ussein, were said to be regarded as infidels by the Akhwan, who attributed to Hussein the delay over the 1918 Haj. * 29. I he situation on the Hejaz railway about the end of August can be summed up as follows :— North of Maan railway communication with the north was temporarily cut. The enemy were endeavouring to restore this communication with the troops and material locally available, and it was probable that in course of time would effect this object. Sec Appendix M. f See paragraph 23 and note.10 Thev had been able to improve their situation by running transport convoys across the break in the railway from Juruf ed Derwish to Maun . South of Maan railway communication was probably detmitely severed* with tne north for a very considerable period, if not permanently. This, however, did not necessarily justify anticipation of the actual fall of Medina, whose garrisonf had by now usurped the functions of the local inhabitants who had practically all been evicted from the district, and could probably support itself on local production of gram and dates for an indefinite period. The Arabs would not attack Medina itself, but it was possible that all outlying Turkish posts and garrisons would fall into Arab hands. As regards the political situation, the tension produced by the Khurma affair had been aggravated by news from Philly who was with Ibn Saud, dated 25th June, that a large raiding party of Akhwan under Turki, Ibn Sand's son, had left Nejd for Jebel Shammar at the end of Ramadan. The dispute between the Quraish} ajid Wahabite factions is historical, and Hussein naturally regarded Saud as the chief opponent to his personal ascendency and to his scheme of unification of Arabia. His Majesty's Government saw the necessity for intervention, and a strong message was sent to both chiefs urging forbearance and conveying His Majesty's Government's policy of friendship to both parties. This message appears to have succeeded in temporarily allaying the King's fears, and he . gave assurances that his policy in the Khurma area would be restricted to the restoration of order locally, and that no hostile action against Ibn Saud was contemplated, but at the end of July, 1918, he suddenly asked to be allowed to abdicate and retire with his family from the sphere of Arabian politics. A reassuring message was sent him by His Majesty s Government and he withdrew Ins application to abdicate. He promised to write to Ibn Saud in favourable terms, and as evidence of his good faith offered to pay him a visit and personally discuss the points at variance. On the 22nd August it was reported that letters, dated 13th July, had been written by Sherif Abdullah to two Ateibab chiefs. These letters were unfriendly to Ibn Saud and proposed a concentration of Ateiba and other tribesmen at Shudhub wells a day s journey east of Khurma. These letters were written without reference to King Hussein, who has been urgently requested to instruct Sherif Shakir to commit no act of aggression east of Khurma, and Abdulla to confine his energy to fighting Turks. A report, dated the 8th August, from Mr. Philby, political officer with Ibn Saud, stated that the intervention of His Majesty's Government had had an excellent effect on Ibn Saud, who, in a written reply, which covered much recent history, expressed cordial agreement with the sentiment of His Majesty's Government. He left the settlement ol all disputed questions to the discretion of the British Government whether now or hereafter, pending which neither side was to provoke the other by any hostile act. * See | aragraph 18 and note. t Despite the dilliculty of their position the Turks appear to hare maintained their moral and discipline to some extent. Ihia is chielly owing^ to the energy and capability of their commander in Medina, i' ukhn asha, a lurk of the old school. In March li)18 when Atif Bey, commander of the 2nd (Jomposite i 1 orc^aL post for ihe north under somewhat peculiar circumstauces, Kakhri did his best to get him tried by court raaitial for cowardice. On the occasion of the Mudowere garrison deserting their post paragraph 22) l akhri had them tried by court martial and heavy sentences were promulgated on the olncers concerned. In August 1918 a plot was discovered at Maan in* which several officers were implicated m au en eavour to communicate with Sherif Feisal's forces and the ringleaders have been arrested and sent o tnai to Damascus. Nor do the Turks appear to have abandoned the idea of re -establishing communication with A.sir where the 21st Division is isolated. In March 1918 orders appear to have been issued that tba. dmsum which consists of some 6 battalions with 20 guns should be formed into the XXIII Army Corps 1 here has beyn a good deal of evidence to show that messengers have from time to time been despatches ? lr ; ni - ne ? { the most important of the .-e messengers, Ashraf Bey, was captured by bhen Abdulla m January 1917, with £T20 ,00U u hile en ronU to the South Uail. I oee note to Appendix A.grandson of the first Abadilah Emir (.died in 1858) and of the Quraiah • Emirate of Mecca by the Turkish An&lt;rlophil Grand Visjier, Kiamii Pasha, in Constantinople. Hussein was appointed as a man uf pacific character. Sherif Hussein ibn Ali, tribe, was nominated to the 1908 after a long residence likely both to serve the Porte 's purposes aad also to keep on good'terms with oursulves. In 1910 he took up arms for the Turks against the Asiri revolt under Jdrisi, and succeeded in relieving Kbha and seriously reduced Idrisi's power. In the same year he sent an expedition to Qasim to assert the rights of tiU Ateibah ; and though, through the detection of Ibn Kashid, he had to retire content with an arrangement with Ibn Saud under which the Ateibah were to remain free of the letter's taxes, and the Meccan Treasury merely asserted its right to a considerable contribution from Qasim, his influence had been extended to Central Arabia. Hussein, however, under the stimulus of his second sofat and reputed successor-designate. Abdullah, had cherished from the first the design of emancipating the Meccan Emirate from its dependence on the Porte; though he himself does not seem to have desired the Khalifat, Abdullah has been accredited with i hat amhifion. His early pro-Ottoman expeditions bad afforded the opportunity of organizing a bedouin 1 force which he could use at need. From 191^ Shenf Hussein began to follow an anti-Ottoman policy, opposing the extension of the Hejaz Kail way. and supporting the Harb tribesmen in their resistance to this and other Turkish projects. From U&gt;e outbreak of the present war he steadily refused to help the Turks to recruit in the Hejaz, but had to give way so far as to allow his son Ali to raise an irregular regiment of bedouins at Medina for service in Sinai; he continued to organize such of the Hejaz tribes as acknowledged his authority, with a view to insurrection at the proper moment, and reconciled iiimself witli IdrisiJ trying to unite him and the Imam Yahya of Yemen in a common anti-Ottoman aim. His third son, Feisal. was despatched to Constantinople early in 1915, and on his returrt to Syria got into communication with the Pan-Arabists. Though Feisal's policy and actions at that time are not clear it seems that he secretly furthered his father's designs by promoting disaffection, and though obliged to accompany Enver Pasha to Medina in February 1916 he returned to Syria to continue the same work. In 1915 Abdullah, the second son. was sent to Central Arabia to make peace with the Emirs of Hail and Riadh and to enforce the rlaims of the Meccan treasury on Qasim and Sedeir. This peace, however, was not observed on either side for long. {See Appendix B.) By the Spring of 1916 Hussein had Income the de fucto power in Hejaz, with wide influence outside, extending in Asir to Wadi Hi*hah and northward to the Southern Anazah tribes. Both in Mecca and Medina (in which last city he kept his eldest son, Ali. as his representative) he had reduced Turkish authority to a low ebb. and even in Jeddah his agents wielded most influence. But the Porte maintained its garrisons in spite of temporary interruptions of railway conuminication, and under their protection the Ottoman officials held b?i to their posts. In May 1916 a strict naval patrol of the Ilejaz coasts was enforced by the British authorities in order to support the Emir by demonstrating to the Arabs the inevitable results of further submission to Ottoman occupp.tion, and early in June an iniiurrection of tribes from the Juheinah in the north to the borders of Asir in the south, including both Harb and Ateibah, broke out under the leadership of the Knair and his sons. On the 2nd Muharrem (29th October, 1916) Colonel Wilson, Chief Pilgrimage Officer, received at Jeddah a telegram, sent by Sherif Abdullah, as Foreign Secretary, notifying Ilis Majesty's Government that Sherif Hussein Ibn Ali had on that day been recognized by the Assembly of the Ulema at Mecca and ' according to the wish of the public' as King oj the Arab nation, an&lt;i religious Chief 'until the Moslems are of one opinion concerning the Islamic Khalifat,' Colonel Bremond, head of the French Mission in Jeddah received an identical telegmm. Both he and our representative (Colonel Wilson) contented themselves with acknowledging receipt, and proceeded forthwith to ask instructions from their respective Governments. It was learnt later that the French Moslem Mission at Mecca had been summoned to the Assembly at which the acclamation had taken place, but without being forewarned of the object of that assembly. Though in conversation with Mr. Storrs in October Sherif Abdullah had broached tentatively the question of his father assumihg some higher title than Emir, the above definite announcement somewhat startled those immediately concerned with Uejaz affairs, and Colonel Wilson was asked to sound Sherit' Abdullah regarding the motives for this step. Meanwhile, His Majesty's Government were informed ttiai the Allied (iovernmcuts and some neutrals had been directly notified ot the above proceeding by telegram (in which only the title of King was mentioned, and no allusion was made to religious chiefship) and were informed that the u coronation ' would take place on the 4th or 5th November, 1916. The reasons given by Abdullah and the Emir were, briefly, these, that;— 1. Recognition of the new title by His Majesty's Government would clear us, in the minds of the Arabs, from any suspicion of designs on the Holy Places, and thus free our hands to send troops to the King's assistance. * The Arabian tribe from which Mahommed was descended. The Sherif of Mecca is always of the Quraish tribe, but ever since the extinction of the Abbaside Khalifahs, the Sultans of Turkey have held the office of Khalifah, who aie not of this tribe. f The sons of King Hussein in order of birth are Ali, Abdullah, Feisal and Zeid. X IdrifU —After much pressure and assistance in munitions and money, Idrisi began operations against the Turks early in 1918 and in February had succeeded in capturing Loheiya and Atn. In April the Turks, having collected men from all directions, advanced on his position east of the above towns and defeated his forces, but weie, at the time, unable to follow up their success. On the 7th June, they however again attacked, and on the hth captured various outlying villages. On the 10th they occupied Atn, an important village containing the main water supply for Loheiya, which Idrissi's forces evacuated without firing a shot. As a result of the loss of his water supply, Idrissi was compelled to evacuate Loheiya a few days later, and this he accomplished with the loss of a few guns, some of which were rendered unserviceable by British Naval landiri^ party. Idrisi, when last heard of, had retired to Habl, SO miles north of Loheiya, and it was considered unlikely that he would be able to undertake any further offensive operations tor some time. (61U-19) B ZN 2. All Hejaz wished it as a proof of independence, and as sncti it would help the Arab ranqp o. It was desirable to distinguish the new repine it Mecca from the old state of don/l Turks, and emphasize the return to the prior state of Sheridal independence. The E'nir did nMr ( ' nCe | 0 ' ' title to imply any lordship over, or interference with, other Arabian Princes, and he lov'dlv'? agreements with Great Britain. If the latter ha.d any doubts of his good faith, he would' lemon^ n u J not pressing his request. u by There were obyious objections to His Majesty's Government recoffnizinir a '• Kine* of H . a a —. u „ „ While that nation was still m pw only, and tin- prince who claimed ich recXtion wl? ? from bemg m a position to substantiate his pretension. Sot only were our actual treaties and a^WnJt- with other Arab pnnces a bar, but we could hardly have been expected to P ive what amounted to h blank ch^cpie on thie political organization of Arabia in the future. Feeling that this title was a matter about which consultation with our Allies (and especially the French Government) had to take place before anv lormal recognition in explicit terms could be given, and also that our relations to other Moslem princes and peoples had to be considered carefully. His Majesty's Government instructed Colonel Wilson merely to send a congratulatory telegram to Sherif Uussein. Finally the title recognized by His Majesty's (iovernmeut after discussion with their Allies was King of Hejaz, and Hussein was not to be addresaed as '• His Majesty ' but as ' His Lordship.' i ' In January, 1^18, King Hussein again raised the question of his title and sought the recognition of His Majesty's Government to the title of King of the Arabs, -stating such recognition would benefit his cause and help to refu+e enemy propaganda about the annexationist aims of the Entente Powers in Arab countries. Rarly in February, His Majesty's Governmect replied to this request by stating they were much touclied at the readiness and frankness with which King Husaein had caused to'be forwarded to the High ('om- missioners in Egypt a message from .lemal Pasha 1. to Sherif F-isal and Gaafar Pasha {fee Appendix D.i. and that the polit y of His Majesty's Government and their AJlies was to stand for the cause of the liberation of the oppressed nations and that they tvere determined to stand by the Arab peoples in their struggle for the reconstruction of an Arab world in which law should once again replace Ottoman violence. But tie actual question at issue was waived. W ith reierence to the letters of Jemal I. to King Hussein there appears to be no doubt that practically since the outbreak of the Arab revolt the Turks had been despatching messages to Hussein and his sons. VV hether all these messages duly arrived at their destination or not is unknown, but the first iuformation received by British authorities of such correspondence was in January, 1918, when Hussein forwaided to the High Commissioner in Cairo the letters from Jemal Pa-sha I. aoove mentioned. Hussein left the answer to the High Commissioner, but informed his son Feisal that the official answer to the Turks should be that the sword must be the sole arbiter between the Arabs and the Turks. In .'une. ]l)18, Hussein informed the High Commissioner that an emissary bearing a letter froni Jemal II. had arrived at Feisal's headquarters stating that the writer was instructed by his Government to communicate with the Arabs and accept just demands from them. King Hussein had telegraphed to Feisfil instructing* him to reply in the same sense as on the occasion of the previous peace overtures, i.e.. that the sword must decide.' I here is. however, irrefutable evidence that Sherif Feisal replied at once to this letter ana was prepared to enter into 'conversation' with Jemal II. This may merely have indicated » desire to temporise. In Jun*. r.)]6. the Porte issued a proclamation deposing Sherif Hussein from the Emirate of Mecca and on tne 1st July, 11)16, appointed in his place fc herif Ali Haidar(of the family of Abd el Mutailib, Emir. i85i-.'t). an* 881-82, and of the Dhuwwi Zeid clan, hostile to Hussein's clan of the Abaddah. Ali Haidar proceeded to amascus where he interested himself chiefly in propaganda work, he then proceeded to Medina where lie arme on the .ibth July, 1016, and on the 9th August issued a long diatribe against Hussein for having: ■ rown off the i urkish yoke, and on the 13th August wrote to Ibn Saud inciting him to take measures against the bhenf Hussein. ■ In No\otcber, 1916, a literary deputation from Constantinople visited Medina. Damascu^ ^ c ^' Ali Haidar left Medina with his three sous and made good his return to l 1918, information was received that a special mission to King Hussein was contemplated J the lurks, its leader to be either the late or the present Sheikh el Islam.

However in 1817 Ibrahim overran Qasim, and in 18!1« tho Wahabi Emir, Abdullah bin Sand, wat sent a prisoner to Constantinople, where be was beheaded. Wahabi authority was established at Riadb in 1848, but in 1871 Turkish troops reoccupied Hasa, and Abdullah bin Feisal Ibn Sand accepted the title of Kaimakam of Nejd. The basis of the Nejdean Emir's power is both religions and socniar. Hf? is the recognized champion of Wahabism and he commands the population of the most thickly inhabitpo settled districts in Central Arabiu For the past century the history of the interior of the Arabian Peninsula has centred round the nvalrv between the Emirs of Northern and Southern Nejd, Ibn Rashid and Ibji Sand. When Abdul Aziz, the present representative of the house of Saud was a boy of lo, the power of the Rashid touched its zenith; the great Emir, Mohammed {see Appendix C), drove the Saud into exile and occupied their capital. Kiadh. .For 11 years Ibn Saud wandered in exile, seeking refuge for a time in the Syrian desert, in the tents of the great Anazah tribe, with whom he claimed kinship, but in 1902 the Sheikh of Koweit gave the yonng Emir hia chance of recovering his capital. With a force of some 80 camel riders supplied by Ko'weit, Ibn Saud surprised the Rashid garrison of Riadh and proclaimed his own accession from the recaptured city. In a contest renewed year after year Ibn Saud recovered the territories of his fathers, and in 1:913 seized the Turkish province of Hasa, formerly an appanage of Riadh. ejected the Ottoman garrisons and estabTished himself on the seaboard of the Persian Gulf, but in May. I'.'i-l, accepted the title of Vali of Nejd. He wus already on terms of personal friendship with Captain Shakespear, British Political Agent at Koweit. In the winter of 1914-15 Captain Shakespear made his way for the second time into Nejd and joined Ibn Saod, who was marching north to repel the attack of Ibn Uashid engineered and backed by the Turks. The two forces met towards the end of January m an indecisive engagement in which Captain Shakespear. though he was present as a non-combatant, was killed. On the 2r)th December, 1915, Ibn Saud entered into a treaty with the Indian Govemntent, which was ratified on the IHth July, 1916. At the outl reak of the Sht rifs revolt in the summer of 1916, Ibn Saud wrote that he considered Ibn Rashid should be obliterated and his name effaced. In September, 191G, Ibn Saud was either unable or perhaps unwilling to attack Hail without assistance, and possibly was mindful of his treaty with the Tirks of May, 1914. On the lith November, 1916, Sir P. Cot met Ibn aiaud at Uqair. Saud pointed out the impossibility of co-operating with the Sherif on a large scale, but was prepared to send one of his sons with a few men as a token of his identification with the Sherif's cause; with certain assistance he would demonstrate against Ibn Rashid. Ibn vSaud accompanied Sir P. Cox to Bahrein and Koweit, where he was decorated with the K.C.l.E. on the 2uch December and made an animated pro-British and anti-Turk speech, eulogising the action of the Sherif. He then accomp.-tnied Sir P. Cox to Basra, where he detailed the assistance necessary to commence operations against Ibn Rashid. viz., 3.0U0 rities ami some machine £ruus and the necessary ammunition; the question of •ub.-idy Was also raised, \fter his return to Riadh, he forwarded to Sir P. Cox about th' end of the year a letter ail Iressed to his father on the loth November, lyiG, by the Sherif, who signed as King of Ai-a'ian Countries Ibn Sand considered this a clear justilication of sugf-icions regarding the Sherif which he had previously expressed. On the 24th January Ibn Saud left Riadh for Qasim and commenced operate ns apraiust Ibn Rashid and claimed to have killed 40 men and captured 20o hordes about the end of February or the beginning of March. Ou the ^th May he reported to Sir P. Cox that Ibn Rashid had asked for peace, but staled he had replifd he could uot comply without ascertaining our wishes. About June, 1917, Mr. R. was about To htart from Koweit on hi? way to the Hejaz and to report on the situation in Central Arabia. I'nforiuuatelv, Mr. Storm got sunstroke ami could not continue his mission. On the 14th June, lull, Sherif Abdulla reported that Ibn Saud had written him a friendly lett'fr statin^ he w»sauti-lurk, pro-Arab and pro-iherif, at the same time sending him a valuable mare. On the 18th June it was reliably reported that Fakhn Pasha, at Medina, was endeavouring to communicate with Ibn Saud without result, and had stated that Saud had sometime previously commuuicaicd direct svitn ConatatiTinqple to request money and arms. On the 12th June General Clayton forwarded a statement of the Sherif that he had received information that Ibn Saud was preparing to take action against him, had been aiaking pro- l urk speeches, and was distributing the arms received from His Majesty's Government among 'the Wahabis whom iie was stirring up against the Sherif. and also that Ibn Saud had connived at the pu&amp;sa^e through his country of £T40,000-50,ooO for the Turkish troops in Asir and Yemen. On the 28th September Sir P. Cox reported at length on Ibn Saud. The main points were that, it Turkish gold had passed through his territory to tho Yemen, it was owing, to the slackness iof Ibu Sa.id's people, and not by connivance of the Emir himself; that Dr. Harrison, who ha^ just returned from .Riadh, reported that the continued strain of the war on the people of &gt;«ejd, and the severe redtrictiona placed upon their trade, caused public opinion to be hostile to us, although, owing to the. loyal attit udc of the Emir himself, there was no overt talk against us: that the money lavished on the Heja/. tribes had spoilt the market for Ibn Saud, and that, finally, his military value had never been over-estimated, and although he had been given two guns and three machine guns, their value was doubtful, owing to lack of trained pers nnel. At the Haj of r.'17 Abd er .Rahman, Ibn Sand's father, attempted the journey across Arabia, but had to give up owing to infirmity, leaving the Haj to be performed ou his behalf by bis son, the Emit Mohammed, v. ho was entertained by the Sherif of Mecca. On the oOth October, 1917, Sir P, Cox reported that he had detailed Mr. H. St. J. Fhilby, l.C.S., and Lieut.-Colonel Cunliffe Owen as a special mission to Ibn Saud, accompanied by Colonel Hamilton to represent the views and interests of the Sheikh of Koweit. This mission appears to have accepted an exaggerated estimate of the Rashid power ani importance from Ibn Saud. It was hoped that a British oHicer and a n pt e- sentative of the bherif would come to Boreidahand the whole question of the inter;.al politics of Arab a would be discussed. Mr. Storrs was suggested to King Hussein as the oflicer who wo.uld represent his interests at the proposed conference. After considerable dilliculty the consent of the Sher.f was obrtjained to Mr. Storrs proposed jonrney, but the Slierif finally revoked his approval and nothing would make hi-p change his mind. In the meanwhde the mission from Mesopotamia had reached Riadh and Philby reported on the 2nd D&amp;cotober that Ibn Saud displayed consuming jealousy of the Sherifs assumption of the title King of the Aval&gt;( • UBtrie-?. and suspected that the Sherif's attitude in this connection was based on some secret understanding with ns. Owing to the Sherifs refusal to allow Mr. Storrs to make the journey, Mr. ffeilby crossed Arabia and to the undisguised annoyance of Hussein arrived at Jeddah via Taif at the beginning ot January, r.'i.-. Commander Hogarth was sent to Jeddah from Cairo, where several conferences with i'hilby and King' Hussein took place. MThe Km&lt;r rofused to be reassured about Ibn Saud's attitude. He both feared him as a centre of a religious ( Wahabi) movement dangerous to the llejaz, and hated him as irreconcilable to his own pretenr' to bo King of the Arabs. The confereupes were successful in other ways, but failed to solve the Ibu .4 ouostiou. i ! i ? i - 5 , i Kuio- Hussein finally refused to allow Mr. Phil by to return by land to Ibn baud and he went back by sea. At the t*iul of Itecemter, 1017, Major (JomwHllis, who was in Shrrif Abdul la's cump in iho Wadi Ais, was informed by the Sherif that he had written to .ibn Saud in March, 1»17 ? g-uaranteein^ his future iniiei«'nd&lt;'uce and that of his desrendants, , Ibn'Sand is reported to have read this inrter to his council at Kiadh and to have sent a suitable acknowledgment. Later, when Ibn llashid come to Medaiii Saleh, Abdullah wrot# anullvr letter to Ibn baud prapK»«ing. co-operarit)u against Hail; Ibu baud briefly &amp;i'knowle(!a\-'i receipt of this letter but made no allusion to its contents. At the 1 •-ihui!)- of April, I'Jbs. reliable iofonjiation was received that Ibn baud was in communication with Fakhri PksTia at Medina to the effect'that' U.Germany would guarantee his claims to certain districts he wan prepared to assist Turkey, but nothing came of this. However, ofi the acc ttsion ol the new bultan of Turkey in July, Fakhri was ordered to inform Ibn .baud of his accession. The next move was the Khurma affair {see paragraph 23), but whether this was instigated by Ibn 8aud or not has never been clearly proved- The immediate outcome, however, was a message from His Majesty's Government to Ibu Saud on the same lines as the message to Hussein (see paragraph 2in. King Hussein offered in August, 1918, to visit Ibn baud with a view to settling their differences once ami for all paragraph :£9). — &amp; ^ appendix c. IBN RASIIID, EMIR OF HAIL. Tbn Rashid, Saud ibn Abd el Aziz, has been Emir of Hail and Jebel Shammar since I ?08. This principality was founded by an Abdah Shammar Sheikh, Abdullah ibn Rashid, who in 1835 was made Governor of Hail by the Emir Feisal of Riadh. Since the last years of the 18th century, ail Jebel Shammar was under Nejd, and most recently under Egyptian overlordship. Abdullah did not, however, throw off his dependence at once, but greatly increased his power during Feisal's detention for five years in Cairo, and, dying in 1847, left his successor, Telal, virtually free of Nejd. The latter's successor, Mohammed, the strongest native ruler seen in Arabia iii the 19th century, consolidated his principality, and not only maintained complete independence, but formed the greatest confederacy of tribes ever collected, and in 1892 conqtiered all the dominions of Nejd and ruled as sole Emir of Central Arabia till his death in 1897. {See Appendix B.) Since that time, Jauf el Amr has been lost to Nuri Shaalan, and despite active Turkish support in 1904-05 no territory has been permanently added to the bhammar domains. The Emirate, therefore, was at the outbreak of war in 1914. confined to Jebel Shammar. The Ibn Rashids always maiutained closer relations with the Ottoman Government than any other independent Arabian princes, and until the Ilejaz revolt in 1910 were consistently friendly with the bherifate of Mecca. The Rashid house is accounted infamous, even in such a land of violence as Arabia, for its record of domestic muiders. Another noble Shammar family, the Subhans, is Very intimately connected with it and shares its notoriety. The present Emir is a son of Abd el \ziz, who reigned from 1897-1906, when he was icilled in battle against Ibn Saud. Emir of Nejd. Abd el Aziz was succeeded bv his son. Mitab, who, before he had reigned a year, was murdered by a cousin, Sultan Ibn Hamud er Rashid. Sultan was then killed by his brother, Saud ibn Ilamud, but the latter in his turn was murdered in 1908 at the instigation of Hamud ibn Subhau, Who brought back his nephew, Saud Ibn Abd el Aziz, from Mecca, where he had been sent for satety, and set him up as Emir. He is said to be an irresponsible boy of boorish manners and violent and ungovernable pass.ons, verging on madness. He has a reputation for cruelty, and even in Arabia is accounted fthitty and fa.thless. His friendship with the Ottoman Sultan was rewarded with large presents of arms and by a considerable sum of money sent up with Ashraf Bey early in 1915, and with the title of Pasha. there are ert.mate, yarying from 20,000 to 800 of ihe numbers of flgbting men he can put into the field, and a reasonable estimate is something under 1(J,U00 and over 5 QUO See also paragraphs 9 (and note), 20, and 27.

Dota hles in an endeavour to sUtuin out any (taNHMb anti-German in Ids r „| lcy | ' „„ Enver I 'asha. where it was obviously bis ambition to maintain a rii o regarinde ^ndeuce ermaflS wbo wore ^The failure of the Stotzin^en Mission to Arabia in 1916 was attributed to him, and he displayed remarkable selCshness in his refusal to assist Khalil Pasha in Mesopotamia during the British threat'on ! lad, 1916/17. Jemal's hostility and failure to co-operate with Falkenhajn, whom he held morally and materially responsible for the loss of Jerusalem, resulted in his recall to Constantinople, whence he visited Berlin about Aug-ust, 1917. In September, he returned to Syria with the title of General Officer Oom man ding - , Syria and Western Arabia.- In November, before his final recall from Palestine, he was responsible for a somewhat striking speech in Beirut, in which he explained his Syrian policy and emphasized the necessity for Turkey keeping a watchful eye on her hereditary enemy Bulgaria. He also went into some detail regarding his attempts to recall the Sherif to his Turkish allegiance. He had written to both Sherif Feisal and Gaafar Pasha* (commanding the Sherif's regular troops) inviting them to a conference. ! 3 Feisal he pointed out the result to Islam of the ultimate fate of the Arab countries, Palestine and Syria, as disclosed by the revelations in the Russian Press; to Gaafar he reminded him of his heroic past when he was aiding Islam to conquer Egypt. Jemal's position on his recall to Turkey in November was a curious illustration of how greatly a man may fail without suffering the common lot of failures. He had displayed no military capacity and his scheme had led to a whole series of disasters. He provoked and had been powerless to check the Arab revolt and made no practical response to the appeals of Pakhri cut off by his agency at Medina; he bad embittered Syria agains tthe Turks; he had embittered the Turks against their all-powerful Allies, ^ et he was still Minister of Marine, and the most conspicuous Turk in Syria. He had quarrelled with the most powerful ministers and generals and had again been summoned from his Syrian stronghold to giv^ account at Constantinople, where, not so long ago, the bowstring or the Bosphorous would infallibly have awaited him. He obeyed, even went to Berlin, and had been everywhere more courted than castigated, and had returned in power to Syria. On the other hand, his achievements consisted of compelling us to spend millions on the defence of Egypt, and to divert our armies sorely needed elsewhere, lie had combed out Syria until it had not a head and hardly a hand to make rebellion. His strength lay in his championship of Islam, sincere enough as he made this his line in public life, and he was false to everything else but his own interest. Among prominent Turkish ministers he was the only one wno stood for that, and greatly as the Turanians would have liked to have had him and all other pro-Islamic Turks out of the way, they dared not put him out. Therefore Jemal I. remained in power in spite of German opposition and Enver Pasha's scheming. On his return to Constantinople in December, 1917, he took up his old post of Minister of Marine. Later he was reported at Batum on the Black Sea, and in August, 1918, at Vienna. In 1917, Kuchuk Jernal 11. commanded the Vlllth Army Corps. On the 11th November, 1917, he was travelling, in a train which was mined by the Arabs near Khirbet-es-Sumra north of Amman and narrowly escaped beiig killed. His aide-de-camp and some 20 others lost their lives. About the beginning of 1918 he was given command of the IVth Army, and on the 25th January, 1918, was appointed Governor-General of Syria. On the formation of the Composite Force at Tebuk at the beginning of 1917, Jemal III. was given . command. On reorganixation of areas he took over command at Maan in September, iyi7, until he went sick in Decemoer, 1917, and returned to Damascus, thence to Constantinople. appendix e. MAURICE'S REPORT. About the beginning of January, 1918, Maurice, who was at one time employed as a British Agent in Egypt and Switzerland, arrived at Akaba and was sent to Cairo where he was interrogated, lie left Switzerland on the 22nd September, 1917, arrived Berlin the 23rd land travelled via Sofia to Constantinople, where he arrived on the 5th October. In Berlin be was questioned closely at the War Oftice as to what he knew of British intentions in Syria and Mesopotamia, and asked if he considered it possible to buy over Ibn Saud, as well as various other questions concerning the Arab revolt. Maurice stated that the Germans had expressed to him their disappointment at the failure of the Turkish alliance to bring the whole Moslem world on to the side of the Central Powers. He was also interviewed by Von Kuhlmann. in the presence of llakki Pasha, the Turkish Ambassador, and claimed to have impressed the former with his reasons tor the dislike to Turkish rule of the Arab Ottoman subjects ; his reasons chiefly being the atrocities committed by Jemal Pasha I. and Khalil Pasha in Syria and MesoDotamia respectively. On his arrival at Constantinople, Maurice stated he was at once interviewed by Talaat Pasha regarding the Arab question. Talaat stated that both th« Sultan himself and Said Halim, the Grand Vizier, had written to the Sherit proposing peace, but the replies they had had were very vague regarding conditions. He stated he was also taken to see Enver, with whom the Sherif s revolt was discussed. Maurice stated he was informed that £T2OO,'0ttO in gold had already been despatched to Damascus for propaganda purposes among the Arabs. Later Talaat told him that there had been an offer of peace from the Sherif in the spring of 1917, but it had not been entertained, as one of the conditions was for the Shenf to become Khalif. Talaat, according to Maurice, threw all the blame for the continuance of the Arab revolt on Sherif Abdullah, and said that Turkey might consent to the independence of the Sherif. and might possibly arrange matters iu Syria for him, but would never permit him to become Khalif. Before leaving Constantinople Maurice stated he had had a farther interview with Enver, who asked Maurice to explain to the great Bedouin families and the Druses, when he arrived in Damascus, Enver • attachment to them and consideration of their interests. Enver stated that Tahsin Bey, formerly Vali of Erzerum, had been entrusted with the handling of the Arab propaganda at Damascus. About the beginning of 1917, Maurice reached Damascus and again saw Jemal Pasha I., who showed him two large envelopes which were to be sent to the Sherif via Kerak, and stated he had repeatedly written * A Baghdadi Arab, with a considerable European experience of modern warfare. Commanded th« Turkish forces operating with the Senussi in Tripoli, 1915-1 , .)16. He was captured in I'JIG and interned in the Ciiadel, Cairo. After an abortive attempt to escape, in the course of which he broke a leg, volunteered to fight for the Sherif and was appointed to his preseut post in May, 1917.16 to both the Sherif and Feisal, but had not received a reply. The Sherif is known to have received these letters. Maurice then saw the Vali of Damascus. Tahsin Bey, who stated he had been authorized to spend up to fT500,()00 in gold, of which £T200,000 had already arrived, on propag-anda. Tahsin showed Maurice a letter to Nuri Shaalan (see Appendix L), who had left the Turks and gone to Qaf with his tribe, as his son Nawwfif had been arrested at Damascus in Julv and confined at Zahle. The letter stated that Nuri must return to Damascus with 500 camel men, when he would be p^iven £T 10,000, food for his bedouins and ritles, as well as the title of Emir of Qaf, and a first-class Usmauieh. Maurice stated he at once wrote to Nuri warning him that the above was a trap and the fact remains that Nuri Shaalan did not return to Damascus. During all this time Maurice's pose was that of i Turkish agent working to induce the Arabs to return to their Turkish allegiance. He stated that Jemal Pasha i refused to allow him to go among the bedouin, but informed him he was to work with the Vali and the' sum of £T400,000 (?) would be put at his disposal to raise a bedouin army of some 15,0&lt;&gt;0 men. The Valis of Damascus, Adana. Aleppo and Beirut, with the Governor of the Lebanon appear to have formed a committee for this purpose. While at Damascus two Sheikhs of the Metawalli tribe asked Maurice whv the support which he had promised them on his previous visit to Syria in UH 6 had not been forthcoming. Maurice stated that he had told the authorities concerued (British? Arab ?), bni nothing had been done, but if would be different this time. Maurice had no authority for thus pledging the British authorities. About the 7th December Maurice left Damascus in disguise and went to the Hammad, among the bedouins, whom he invited to revolt against the 'Turkish Government. Towards the end of December he staled he accompanied a bedouin party with the object of raiding Tadmur, but apparently the raiding pftrty thought better of it when some 6 hours journey from that place. About this time Maurice stated he received a letter from Nuri Shaalan the gist of which was that he was on the Sherif's side but could not join him as he was too far off and had many enemies. Ibn Kashid, the Sherarat and the Anazah (?), but if the Sherif s forces came nearer {i.e. further north) he would join him at once as long as he was given sufficient arms and ammunition and with the whole of the Beni Muslim (300.000 -400.000 ? men) would attack floras, llama, or anywhere else? {See Appendix L. The Rualla Nuri Shaaian's tribe have now, August, 1918, detinitely declared for the Sherif). He also stated he had received a similar message from tr-e Druse Sheikhs through Selim el A trash, that, when the Sherif s forc es came nearer, they would join him and attack Deraa. Maurice arrived at Akaba ab&lt; 'Ut the beginning of January, 1918, He is said not to have been received favourably by Feisal. APPENDIX F.

All reports received show his return was brought about by German intiuence, and the object of his return was his employment to undermine British influence in Arabia and Egypt. 2,000,000 francs are reported to have been put at his disposal for this object. A report stated his mission was to act as intermediary between the Porte and the Sheiif, and he has had a considerable staff placed at his disposal.

Tin's first took concrete shape upon the British occupation of Jerusaieni, when a Zionist Commission, under the presidency of Dr. Weizmann was formed and left for Palestine in March, 1918. Its avowed objects were; — (u.) To assist the Zionist CokVuies in Palestine in material and educational matters. {b.) To plan future developments. (c.) To create harmonious relations with the nou-Jewish population of Palestine. It was at first hoped that both Russian an 1 American Zionists would be represented on the Commission, but this was found to be impracticable, thMu^h a Fren.-h representative was included. On arrival in Palestine the commission took over the work of the previously established Zionist Relief Gommisyion. Thouyh, not unnaturally, some anxiety was caused amon^ the Syrian and Mohammedan population, by his tactful handling ot the situatiim l)r. Weizniann went far t&lt;&gt; dispel the atmosphere of distrust due to fear that the Jews intonded to expropriate or buy during the war lar -e tracts of land owned by Moslems ainj otliers, ami gratlnaily to force them from the country. H« explained it was his ambition to see Palestine governed by some stable Government like that of Great Britain, that a Jewish Government would be fcwaj to us plans and that it was simply his wish to provide a home for the Jews in the Holy Land Where thev could live their own natural life, sharing equal rights with the other inhabitants. TherJ is no doubt thai t ns frank avowal o: Zionist aims produced a considerable revulsion of feeling among the Palestinians, who 'or the tirst time came into contact with European Jews of good standing Thev had the conviction forced upon them that Ziom.-m had come to stay, that it was far more moderate in its aims than had been. the'Vumre H ^ ^ * collc ^ a ^ or y they would be more likely to reap substantial benofns iu At the beginning of June Dr. Weizmann visited Sherif Feisal in his camp at Gueira (between Akaba and aan^ w ere -lomsui, as it affected the Arabs, was discussed. Weizmann and Feisal established ex-cellent persona, re.ations, and l eisal expressed his opinion of the necessity for close co -operation between Jews and Arabs, espeaally at that moment, but stated he himself was unable to ex res ^ deliuite opinions .m pohtical questions, as he was only his fathers agent in such matters.

Jema! XL Cpramsnder of the 4th Army, who had no^r arrived at Amman and taken over the direction of operatiou'g from All Kiza Pasha (appointed Commander East Jordan Group as lately as the 2Srd March), was very anxious about the situation.! lie issued orders for certain^ troops, whjch had arrived at Kalaaf pz Zerk i from the north, to take up the position behind the Wadi el Hamman and reconnoitre the British, who were west and south of Zerka. He decided to withdraw the Amman Group and to hold the line of the adi Zierka, for which purpose he considered at least two strong infantry and two cavalry divisions were necessary.S On the 29th, the enemy had ascertained from prisoners that the whole Anzac Mounted Division had crossed the Jordan, and that there were in front of Amman at least two British cavalry brigades and probabiy one infantry brigade of the (iOth I'ivision. as well as camelry farther to the south. Althongn Jemal II. reported that violent attacks by the whole Anzac Division, and at least one brigade of the HOth Division, had been repulsed with great loss during the last two days, he was sensible of artillery inferiority, and was certain that British reinforcements were arriving from the rear and that their attacks would be redoubled. He realized the importance of Amman both as regards the tribal situation as far north as Deraa, and as regards the safety of Damascus itself. He still considered an immediate conoen(ration at Zerka was ncccssarv to save ' a terrible disaster.' Jemal's report appears to have created an impression in Constantinople, for on tire 30th, Enver. who had on the 27th March expressed his anticipation that the end would be attained shortly on the other frvntt, and that then the irreatest assistance would be given to the Hejaz front, now informed Fakhri Pasha at Medina that the situation at Amman had become critical. He advised him to withdraw, if necessary, the largest possible number of men from his district into Medina, while those who could not reach Medina luiist resist to t he last man. Iiaihvay material should also be brought into Medina. On the 31 st March, l 1 uad reponed that the British had commenced to retire in a westerly direction on the night of March and that the Turkish pursuit from Amman would comuieoce on the morning of the 31st. Concentration of rroopa from the south of Jize was to continue as rapidly as possible. The latter order was endorsed by Enver at Constantinople, who considered that all troops th;it could possibly be spared from the Hejaz Expeditionary Force should be sent northwards, since, if the Turkish troops at Amman were reinforced as soon as possible, the defeat of the British troops there was very probable. On the 1st April, Jemal II. reported that 300 British dead had so far been buried at Amman and a few others still remained to be buned. The Circassiuns reported that the British had withdrawn in disorder towards Salt and towards Wadi Sir,}] while a convoy of wounded had mo \ed from Wadi Sir to Salihie. Natives had taken a successful part in an advance guard action near Sir, in which 8 Circassians were killed and 30 wounded, while at Kerak about GOO loyal Bedouins had promised to serve with the Turks. On the 3 (tth March, on hearing &lt;if the British repulse, Fakhri congratulnted Fuad at Amman —I have kissed the threshold of the Prophet's Tomb, and am praying on behalf of you and your gallant troops. 1 kiss your eyes.' T'ie subsequent operations in the Es Salt area at the beginning of May gave further proof of the Turkish determination to pre^ent the British actually joining hands with the Arabs and establishing an uuiied front from the Mediterranean to the liejaz railway. APPENDIX K. KOWEIT BLOCKADE. Owing to reports having been received that large quantities of supplies were reaching the enemy from Koweit, the General Officer Commanding, Mesopotamia, in consultatiun with Sir Percy Cox, proposed m October, 1917. that this port should be blockaded. In December, 1917. the Viceroy poin&lt;ed out that the institution of a blockade might alienate the SheikhT and simplv divert illicit dhow traffic, and considered it preferable to offer inducements to the sheikh to take adequate measures himself. This course was eventually adopted, and early in 1918 the Sheikh undertook to control the inlrmd caravan traffic. Owing to the strong pressure put upon him by Koweit merchants considerable difficulty was experienced in getting the Sheikh to consent to our superintending his blockade, but after some straight talking he accepted our proposals, and from that moment met all suggestions of our blockade officer without demur. In consequence of his friendly attitude it w|8 decide i thai the Sheikh should be given the C.3.I., and that we should forego the repayment of one lakh and 87,0U0 rufteea advanced to his father for the installation of a water plant. In Ap;il. Kgypt reported that about 5,000 camels had arrived at Damascus with &lt;roods from Koweit. and at the beginning of May, Baghdad reported that it was impossible to enforce a strict blockade locally (although two of His Majesty's ships had been sent), and considered that it should either be enforced by the Government or allowed to fall in a; eyance. • 7th Cavalry Regiment, 3/152nd Regiment. 1/I48th? ^I4&lt;ith) uegiment.

The Turkish force in Amman, consisting of i,tW&gt; ritles. was heavily outnumbered by the British attacking troops, who were able to be reinforced. Turkish artillerv was inferior to the British and ammunition was short. There was only a few days supply of food.

In 101.'), Sherif Feisal wan in communication with Nuri Shaalan, and at the l^ginning of the revolt there were many rumours of Nuri Shaalans descending- on the Damascus Vilayet with l3,(Kk» Rualla at his l)ack. As Ins marketaj both east and west, were controlled by the Turks in I'Jlt'*, it was imiiossible far Nuri Shaalan to co-operate with the Sherif, but there was complete understanding between them. A meeting; between Nuri. his son Nawwaf, and Pawa/. Ibn Faiz, of (lie Beni Sakhr, took place at Jauf in December, r.Mfi, at which it was decided to break off at once all relations with the Turkish Government, but active co-operation with the Sherifal forces was pronounced impossible until Feis:U should have reached El (Jla, and thereny opened up a means for getting supplies through to the Ruathi. Audah Abu 'lay&gt;i. of the Howeitat, about this time joined Nuri Shaalan, and subscribed to King Hussein's cause and in April. 11(17, came with five members of the Shalaau family to see Fcisal at Wejh, where arrangements weie made for the future. Audah Abu Tayyi wis the leader of the force which captured -Vkabt in .lulv, 1917, and had some of the Uualla tribe fighting under him, although unaccompinied by any of the Shaalan family. In June, I 'J 17, Captain Lawrence met Nuri and his son Nawwaf at Azrak, andwas the bearer of a request from Nuri that half of the Rualla should be allowed to supply itself frcm the Meso otamian market controlled by us. In September, 1917, Nuri was near Jebel Druse and a strong letter was dispatched by Sherif Foisal to Nawwaf asking him to define clearly his attitude towards the Sherifiau movement. Nawwaf had at this time either been oi- narrowly escaped being imprisoned by the Turks at DarrtaM iis, v.hile his fatiier was warned not to fall into a trap the Turks had laid for him under cover of an invitation to Damascus.

Trad, visited Sherif Abdullah in 'the Hejaz, and in November. 1917, Nnri sent his brother Mohammed and also his nephews Khalid Ibn Sattam and Ferhan Ihn I'.did to Mecca on a mission to King Hussein. During the early part of 1918 the Shaalan family, although maintaining their frieudly attitude .towards the Arab movement, occupied themselves with furthering tl.e coniraband iratlic from Koweit to Damascus. Nawwaf at Janf levying toll on the caravans which passed through his capital, and taking his shaiv i.i the petroleum carried by these caravans, while his adUerenls acted as escort irom Jaar northwards. In June (?) Nawwaf was, at Sherif Feisal's instance, dispatched to Ziza, where he placid himseli with a small armed following at the disposal of the Turks., in order to deceive them regarding his i'Kcutions. In July, however, as the result of a rupture, the cause of which is at present unknown, N'at^ vaf leit Ziza and rejoined his father at Hazim near Azrak, whilst Nnri apparently definitely renoumcd iiis allegiance to the Turks by an offer of acti ve co-operation with Feisal. He came into Feisafs headquarters and from there dispatched a telegram to King Hussein at Mecca avowing his allegiance. This declaiation is considered premature as it hud been Feisal's policy to postpone, an open expression of their loyalty by the Rualla, in order to add surprise to the value of their co-opersfction When the time tame to employ them for the extension of the Arab movement to the Hauran, and, secondly, to transier from himself to the Turks the heavy burden of their maintenance in the meantime. 3, The, Druse*. — In 19 Hi, the attitude of the Druses towards the Shcnf's revolt was one of apathy. The Druses have always kept apart from thcr ueighbouis, and although their sympathies were proUiliiy with the Shenf, the prompt action of Jemal I. in taking child hostages, making many arrests and leinforcurg Deraa, was sulficient to intimidate the Druses from taking any action. About dune, 1917, Jefhal I seems to have made an effort to win them over. Their chiefs were entertained for two mouths at ItamaseUS, being tcted and made much dF. In August, 1917, the Druses were reported to have never been in such a flourishing state. They had sold their crops at high pric -s for hard ca^h, arid even when the^ bad oeen requisitioned by the Turkish Goyernment, had managed to retain 60 per cent. As long as the good treatment lasted the Druses were not going to revolt but would only rise when they felt they could do so without fear of retaliation. According to information from various sources the enemy contiTtually feared a rising oi the Druses in conjunction with the Arab movement, and in .Inuc, 1918, &lt; olonel Lawrence received a letter, written in Kngiish, from one of the Atrash family, the fight ng Druse Sheikhs of Salkhad ui the Haurau, containing expressions of friendship and loyalty, while on the 31st August the enemy anticipated an attack by the Rualla and Druses in the neighbourhood of Deraa.- gMEniNA. The following summary of messages shows a ponslsteiit attitnde of despondency on the port of I'akhri Ta^lta crtmjMAftdifig at Medina since ihe autumn of liHZ. It is pro Liable that he has sometimes exag&lt;vwaU$ his troubles, as th.- vilality of liis garrison lias proved, but it is obvious that he can have little hope of relieved in the absi -in -e. of some ^jr^tic riian^e in the siliiaiio;i. 1. Ou the 1th Octnber, 1017., Kakhri jnfurined tiie (ieneral Officer Commanding: Syria and VYeatcra Arabia that Ins wheal and food supplies were all but eXmmsled. Applications to the lines of communicaUon hau not been replied to and he state.l he eouhi not rely on the lleja/ railway. Owing 1 tp.the approach of w inter he considered his situation serious, and uuh-ss considerable quantities of stores were sent him forth with would become dangvrous. In i;e[&gt;ly I 1 ' was told he was responsible for the fuel in his area and in case of necessity authorised to demolish the buildinus in Medina, with the exception of the lloly buildings. On tbe 2')rh October Fakhri re,peMed he had unlv one mouth's food left in Medina, and that the date crop, on which his hopes for supplier wfcre basen, had been destroyed by a storm. 2. About the same time Kaknri despatched a message to the Line Commissaire General at Damascus pointing out how the arrang-emenis for feeding Medina had broken down ; and that the reserve of bread at de .ima timshed on the 2'cth October. He despaired of ever receiving enough supplies at Medina, and put tiie whole moral respgnsibiliry tor the fall ot Medina (if it did fall) on the lines of communication and the Une ('ommissaiie Ueueral. . &amp; About the b.-rinniiig of. November Fakhri pointed out to the Turkish Higher Command the futility of sending him anything by rail and declared himseit besieged. 4. On the Mkh N'ovo;= ber .b tnal I. informefl I'akhiiof the Turkish deieat on the Gaz%—Hir Saba line and that in the event, of the fall Of Jerusa,lem it waA intended to evacuate the liejaz Expeditionary Force from Aluvium. On the lith a further messaue was sent him asking how long lie could hold out should the Me !ina force be aUin.loued. Fnkhri rephed somewhat acridly, asking whetner the decision for evacuating Medina rested with him or the Khalif. 4. At this time there was a good, deal of bit terness in the correspondence betwedto Fakhri. and Jemal I. About the end ot Octolier takhri inlormed Jemal that it was no good sending food to Medina unless the Aiaba were k'pt otf i lie line; demai later refilled that FakHfi was responsible for ttds, to which Fakhri replied bitterly, that it he had suflicieni force left, to keep the line clear he would not have sent his original message. About the niiddle of November Fakhri was informed that the decision had been taken to evacuate the f!e a/, Kxp 'di:a n oy 1 orce with the exception of a small garrison in jMedina, and shortly afterwards he was intormed ot the i rogt mime for cewjyin ; out the evacuation. 7. In a message oait-d the 25th Nov«iidn-r Fakhri protested his inability to comply with orders issued frOm Damascus foi the withdrawal of ids mom.ted troops, lb-piaved that Jemal I. 'will not deprive him ol bis n.eaUS 01 defence, as he has already deprived lum of his.power to take the offensive, and so let the Medina garrison be trampled under the feet of the enemy.' S In the raiddie ot December, 10r /,the heavy troop movements from Damascus to Deraa dislocated the llejaz piogrannoae. On the -Uib December Colonel t &gt; faneustfHl, director of railways, arrived at Medina, ^akhn deeply impressed with the sympathetic liearing he received from his gu-st, who •'unlike the lui s and losem. listened to my worries with great attention.' Damascus resented this message, and replied th.t 1L was due to the ' Turks and Mo^ms' that Ctancnsteil was sent to Medina 'for the sole pur| o.-e of enquinng into t;;e n' e&gt;is of the llejaz Expeditionary Force in his capacity as highest authoriiy in matters of railwav i:aioporT. r * e, j 9. tii January, lU^.'according'to information obtained from the French Mission in the Heiaa, peace '»*****'&amp; Composite Fo.ce. and addressed to Sherd' !

At the beginning'of Juuo, Fakhri reported that the supplies of the 2nd Composite Force and the P 17. Expi'diti.jtiary B^orce would be exhausted, at the end of June and dtdy respectively, while tin- .Ni .ma dare crop (known to Bo a built 2,000,000 kilos) would not he available until September^ 1«. At the l&gt;e&lt;i-inniug- of July, when reporting the evacnation of Mudowcre to Damascus, Fakhri explaifijpd that, in his opinion, the low morale of the troops, which could alone account for such infainou .s conduct, was du^ primarily to ilie non-arrival of rcinfoi^-i-nicnts and to the iailure of the Turkish Higher Command\o reopen railway communication between the Hejaz fixfjedifcionary Force and the north, iy. A hi ':i r tlie samw datw, Fakhri reported that it was hi.s opinion that the Medina foroe might just bold out to ilit- Iteginning of September (new date harvest), but he feared that the I'nd Composite ifotc# would be ■ wablo to da^so. He complaineil bitKn-ly of the fact that no attempt had yet been made to reopen his &lt; Miumimications with the north, and oouM only look forward to the future with the gravest anxietv. At f,lie middle of duly, Fakhri was ordered to 'take over with bis mounted troops the Maan— Mudowere section of the railway, but refused on the grounds that no further reduction could be made with safety, in the Medina garrison where his moijnted troops were his only, mobile reserve; that until the railway was repaired mobile trciops could uot be maintained in the Maan—Mudowere area where, was neither water nor grazing, and, lastly, that the anini;il&gt; of these troops were earmarked as,Medina's last reserve of food. 2U On the 17th July, Fakhri made a strong appeal to Liman von Sanders, Oeneral Officer Commanding, Yelderem, in the course of which he asked that the ilnd Army Corj)s should be temporarily put under his | command, and that the Damascus line of communication railway transport, department and the Hejaz railway administration shhiild be placed definitely and directly Under his orders, lie considered that only by the prompt addpti-m of tfiese measures could the present very critical situation be saved, and was of the opinion thai his force iiad baeq. disgracefully neglected. 22* At the beginning of August, Fakhri reported that the IJejaz Expeditionary Force were so short of fuel that even if the railway was repaired it was doubtful if trains would get through to Medina. 23. On the l^th August. Kakhri despatched a message of farewell, as in view of the fall of Mudowere (captured by two companits Imperial Camel Corps on tne 8tb August), he considered Medina doomed, 21. On the 11th August, the pmchasing officer of the Hejaz Expeditionary Force in Damascus received orders (from Fakliri r) t&lt;» close his accounts and make no farther purchases. On the same day, Pakiiri wag very despondent of the situation of the Hejaz Expeditionary Force, and considered disaster was pending. This he attributed to shortage of fuel, slowness in repairing the railway north of Maan, lack of decision regarding the Maan—Mudowere section, the fact that \elderem had omitted to send reinforcements arid had not placed the llnd Army Corps under his orders, lack of barley, wheat and money, and his inability to reinforce any of his garrisons to the north owing to shortage of troops in Medina. He considered that in the next few months no improvement was likely. The only mobile troops at his disposal were a camel mounted regiment and machine-gun company (310 combatants and 292 camels) and a mule mounted regiment ajud machine-gun company (195 coml&gt;atants, 29 mules, 78 camels). J hese could not be spared for duty north of Tel nk. as they were the only reserve leit for the Medina area. He preferred to surrender or starve rather than be defeated by the Arabs at Medina. The above message was apparently despatched to Enver Fa^ha, who replied sharing Fakhri's views on the difficulty of the fleja? Expeditionary, Force undertaking active operations, and considered that the onus of responsibility of reopening the railway was on Yelderem, and not the Hejaz Expeditionary Force, and owing to the comparative calm on the Faiestiue fiont this should not be impossible. &amp; ■ ' ammmm Gknkkal S TAFF, 31.^ August, 1918. appendix n.
