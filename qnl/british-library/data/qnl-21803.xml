Subject, Report on Tour of Middle East publicity Centres by Mr. Bertram )i ThomasConfidential♦ Report on Tour of Middle East publicity Centre* « mile tour was undertaken by direction of the Han*ble the Political Resident In the Persian Gulf in order that I should acquire first-hand knowledge of publicity activities throughout the Middle East, and make personal contacts with directing officers with v/hom we are in constant communication. It also opened up possibilities of recruiting staff locally unobtainable# 2# Cairo (13-25 January), Jerusalem (23 January - 30 January), Baghdad (30 January-5 February), were the principal centres visited# At Cairo I v*as able to inter view Sir Walter Monckton, the Ministry of Information Director-General in the Middle East, on his return to Cairo (the eve of my departure) from a tour of Iraq. With Mr. Owen Tweedy or one of his associates at the Directorate I was able to confer daily. Elsewhere the principal officers were:Jerusalemi Mr.Christopher Holme Hon, Steven Runciman Baghdad i Mr. Stewart Perowne Mr. Robert Mason. Ihe Arabic-speaking countries, wide-scattered and differing in degree of cultural, political, and eco nomic development, present propaganda problems that call for variety In treatment. Ihe difficulty of evolving a common formula on every topic Is suggested by the questions prominent in publicity circles at the time viz. (a) the best means of appealing to the Arabs* self Interest? (b) how best to capitalise the sympathies of pro-British Arabs? (c) as the Arab leaders in the Axis camp - Kajji Amin, MUfti of Jerusalem; Rashid All al Cilani of Baghdad; and the Druze- 2 - Amir Shakib Arslan were being exploited by Berlin and Bari, the question of counter attacks* 2k© mechanics of publicity have a common basis* A major function of Cairo headquarters office is to produce and distribute to publicity centres Arabic material of all kinds - films, articles, talks, photographs, posters, etc, there is a specialised department for each, staffed by experienced Kuropean newspapermen* I visited each depart ment to explain the Persian Gulf milieu and advise on the suitable appeal and the quantities of material we need. F*om Cairo offices* reserves of metal cliches I selected models with a view to starting an illustrated supplement to ”A1 Bahrain w newspaper. Our first experiment is in the press at the time of writing. The Arab News Agency (Mr. Donald Mallett) offered to send the A.N.A. news service in transliterated Arabic as supplied to Aden, and this is now reaching Bahrain weekly. ^ At the Baghdad office mechanical monitoring w'as demonstrated to me - a machine that records automatically on gramaphone cylinders whatever broadcast is coming over the air of which a verbatim account is wanted* the records are removed by a typist, played over at the tempo that suits his purpose, and the typescript is then sped off to the printer. Bahrain, a pioneer among publicity centres in the possession of its own broadcasting station, has had to rely up till now on a fragmentary 1 taking-down 1 in longhand ol the B.B.C. news bulletin for rebroadcasting. Improvement is necessary. The expense of a mechanical monitor is, however, not at present suggested, if it is found possible to recruit a telegraphist (radio-operator)3 \v to listen and *take down 1 the news bulletins sent out in morse several times a day by Reuters or B.O.W. This in combination with an adequate radio unit, such as was used by The Bahrain Petroleum Company at one time for similar work, would enable a daily cyclostyled bulletin to be made and distributed in Bahrain. 5* An important medium of propaganda in the out- districts of Iraq and Palestine is the cinema van, a mobile unit going from village to village. The visual appeal has high propaganda value, especially in places where illiteracy makes void the value of the printed word, and antipathy can switch the radio off. In the Persian Gulf there is no cinema van. In Bahrain we have a 35mm projector with separate engine and separate transformer capable of being transported by launch or car. The Gulf ports of Kuwait and Muscat are respec tively 325 and 717 miles distant from the island of Bahrain and are accessible by launch: the mainland road to Kuwait lies through Sa^di Arabian territory, and there Is no road to Muscat: along the Trucial Coast car or launch transport Is usually feasible. To serve Kuwait and Muscat without deprivation of each other or of Bahrain, a second 35mm cinema projector Is needed in the Persian Gulf. If areas outside the big towns ere to be served, as in Iraq and Palestine, e.g. the Batinah, a 16mm projector is appropriate. It can be worked off a dry battery and so has the advantage of lightness and mobility. I urged, when in Cairo (Film Section), that 16mm silent propaganda films should be made for village work. Not only/the projector type eost but a small fraction of the sound projector type(and can be bought In the market-placeJ but the voice would be that of a local commentator, a slow live readily-understood voice using the local dialect of Arabic-and therefore preferable, by local standards, to the machine- gun tempo of an unfamiliar accent. 6. In all publicity centres visited, the dispensing of hospitality as a means of cultivating friendly public relations was a regular and popular Institution. In Cairo, at Miss Freya Stark’s house, I attended a coclrtail-party at which a hundred or more guests, mostly Egyptians,were invited to listen to a lecture on ’Pre-Islamic Arabian Poetry* by a professor of the University (an Egyptian). In the Persian Gulf, parallel activities, less elaborate and suitably modified - e.g. ’tea-parties with film-showing’,would be a useful innovation, especially if youth can be attracted: for it Is the rising generation that seems generally to be regarded as illdlsposed to the British cause: and, in a long term view, merits our interest now. Post instruments of propaganda are in one way or other of foreign design &gt; and values as between Middle East countries vary. There Is one instrument which Is Indigenous to Arabia - the Majlis. It is perfectly adapted^ for propaganda purposes,and has a disproportionate importance in societies such as ours with roots in a patriarchal culture, and where opinion is fashioned by the few . In the development of the Majlis there Is wide scope. Inadequ ate offices in Bahrain would alone heve made It impossible for my predecessor to set aside a Majlis room - a carpetted room furnished with coffee appurtenances to provide welcome reception in the time honoured Arabian manner. Adequate office premises should also have a sizable public room on the street level, where Arabic posters, magazines, newspapers, and the latest news-bulletin In Arabic would be displayed - the last-named subject to the agencies of monitoring being available, (vide para 4)A 0 7. Jerusalem and Baghdad provided opportunities of interviewing Arab candidates for staff vacancies. Candidates were few: their quality poor. The market is exhausted from abnormal British army demands on the spot, and soaring rates of pay: the Persian Gulf, with unpleasant summers and lacking amenitites, suffers further as a competitor. Only a pupil translator - a young Palestinian Moslem - was recruited. experience, Iraq and Transjordan, afforded opportunities of talking with the man in the street and so of gauging opinion. Educated Arab opinion, I gleaned in conversation with old Arab friends - notably with the Amir Abdullah in Transjoi dan, with Kuri Pasha as Sa’id Prime Minister of Iraq, and his two predecessors, Ali Jaudat Beg and Jamil Pasha al Madfa'i, severally, among others in Baghdad. H.B«M 9 s Minister of State at Cairo, the Government of India 1 a member on the Middle East War Council, the High Commissioner of Palestine, and H.B.I^s Ambassador at Baghdad. The Rular of Kuwait, while moat friendlily disposed expressed disappointment that Kuwait reception of Bahrain broadcasts was not always satisfactory, particularly at certain times of the year. I was at pains to explain to G. cf Th# countries visited/which X had had previous I also enjoyed the privilege of inteAews with 9 . 9. On my return Journey I visited Kuwait and reported to the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. him the inexorable twin-nature of 1 short-wave transmission 1 and * skip-distance 9 • Telephonic Wireless transmission in Bahrain is a crystal-controlled system (input Ik KW: in aerial fKV*:) limited to two wave-lengths-23 metres and 43 metres. Ine- order to try to meet Kuwaiti difficulties, the 25 metre wavelength will be given a test on 2Cth Marchj but our 43 metre wavelength, the one at present in use, had most general support throughout the Persian Gulf when, on a former occasion, tests of the two were made. According to reports coming in, Bahrain, on the 43 metre wave length, is clearly heard in Muscat, on the Trucial Coast, in Karachi, in Baghdad, and over a large part of Iraq and Arabiai there have been reports of reception from Syria, Malabar and Riyadh. In this connexion it may be of interest to recall that during the Baghdad troubles last year a disturbed Iraq (it has its own station and its own skip-distance problem) was an eager listener to Bahrain broadcasts: and it is thought that if that country should become more actively involved In the present war, the Bahrain station would again acquire this added Importance.

The public say that the lull in military operations in Egypt during the week is due to the fact that the ^ermans are reorganising their forces and preparing for another large scale attack towards the east as their lines of communications have become long. They believe that danger to the other Arab countries will be imminent if they succeed in their next advance, but on the other hand if the jJ ritish bring large enforsements to the front in time the danger to Egypt and other Arab countries will diminsh. There has been no particular interest in the ^erman successes in Russia after the fall of Sevastopol but they think that if the Germans continue to secuG^such successes they might be able to cut off Caucasia from Moscow Sector and thus overrun Caucasia without undue sacrifices.mm1 They underline the huge job that Hitler has in front of him if he is to avoid a stalemate in Russia this year. And as a stalemate will ultimately lead to his total defeat such temporary local German successes as may lie ahead, must be measured against it. Russia 1 s war production last month had again reached the figure it stood at a year ago, before the German invasion of the Ukraine • This comes about as a result of a farseeing stratagic policy which Stalin inaugurated in 1S30 when l^e decided that Russia must have a second-to-none coal and metallugical base beyond the Urals. Three successive five-years-plans were launched, with results we now see: for the war factories of KIEV, KHARKOV and LENINGRAD, when those cities were menaced by the enemy, could all be shifted back to this prepared war Industrial heart of Russia in the Urals. It is no secret that Russia’s aeroplane, tank and artillery production today is greater than that of the British Empire. The main centres of this huge production are Chelyabinsk, Sverdlovsk, Magnitogorsk, Orsk, Nizhnitagal, Berezniki, Perm, Novosibirsk, Stalinsk, Kemerovo and Kurnetski, cities all cither in or beyond the Urals. Some idea of the growth of this great Russian War Industrial area can be gained Magnitogorsk did not exist in 1931: today Sverdlovsk in 1920 had 92,000 inhabitants: a million. Chelyabinsk 1920 had 57,000 people: today three-quarters of a million, and so on. These cities have no light or luxury industries but were planned and exist entirely as a war base. Here Is the heart of the Soviet Union's war strength. It is therefore an area which Hitler must break through to,and conquer. If he does not ,even though he should be able to advance ^a few hundred miles during these next few months, Russia will oe able to return to the fight in 1943 equally as strong as in 1942. from the fact that it has 800,000 people today it has just on What depth must the Germans advance into Russia this year to achieve victory? The nearest point on the present German front to this war heart of Russia is OREL. Prom Orel to Magitogorsk and Sverdolovsk is 1000 miles. From Kharkov to Magnitogorsk Is slightly over 1000 miles. Compare these figures with the total German advances in their big offensive in 1941 during the blitzkrieg hey day. Their push from the Latvian frontier to Moscow was a matter of 350 miles. From Roumania to Kharkov 400 miles. But now to reach Russia's industrial heart in the Urals the German panzers must travel twice as fast and as far as in 1941. Russia's cities of the MIDDLE VOLGA - Kuibyshev, Ulcanovsk, Kazan, Gorki are no more than extreme western out posts of the Ural industrial area, yet even Kuibyshev is 550 miles from Orel the nearest point of the present front, Gorki is 250 miles due east of Moscow, so Moscow would have to be conquered first.2 - Thcsc facts and figures undoubtedly show tho grave seriousness to Hitler of his delay in launching his offensive against the Russians this year. That mid-June has come and tho offensive still not staged, worries the Germans in Germany who have little stomach for more winter campaigns* At the end of last winter. Hitler speaking in the Sportpalast in Berlin promised 'in a few weeks (sic) winter will break in the South* The hour approaches when we shall beat the enemy”* Already those few weeks have lengthened into four and a half months, and according to German propaganda the offensive hasn’t started yet. In February at Munich, Hitler said 'now that in Southern Russia the snows are beginning to melt I cannot leave my post at which preparations arc being made for a final settling of accounts with this conspiracy etc.' By the German people these urgent words were taken to mean the start of an offensive in at most tv to three weeks; but that was four months ago. During those four months the Russians actually have gained more territory from Hitler than ho from them. The fact is that the Russians have been ablo to force this delay on him , at a time when he has a thousand cr cs to go. This in itself is an important Russian success. and it r.ay not much longer be delayed, - will probably try to take the mind-of-the-world off tho fact that Russia cannot be conquered until her industrial bases arc conquered. They will try to paint a picture that BAKU tho Caspian Oil port will soon fall, and with it Russia’s armies must inevitably collapse from lack of fuel. This statement would be quite untrue even if BAKU fell in the antumn of 1942. Actually there is oil in the Urals. In fact the petrol supply thcro in Russia’s industrial area is adequate for a Russian 1943 campaign, as big as the 1941 and 1942 campaigns. Thi^s it comes about that it is the Urals that Hitler must reach this year to win the war against Russia. tries in the Urals he foresaw tho possible necessity of his armies retreating, and he v/asn’t so foolish as to build a vast war machine there without oil supply. Since 1937 one great task for defence purposes said Molotoff has been 'the creation in the Urals of a second BAKU.” In 1940 the combined VOLGA-JRALS oil fields alone produced over 5 million tons of oil. In 1941-42 an increase in production was stimulated by war, so that today altogether apart from tho GAUCASIAN fields, Russia has an independent supply of seven, probably eight million tons annually. Incidentally this figure is greater than tho present total production of the Roumanian oil fields at Hitler’s disposal for the German war machine. It moreover docs not take into account the supplies v/hich Stalin has be^n getting from Baku since the war began and storing in the Urals, nor the ability of Russia to produce synthetic oil from her coal deposits at Ausnetz. Those facts lay the ghost of the belief started by German propaganda that if the German armies reach Baku, Russia is defeated. from Taganrog on the German Southern front, and rather more from Kerch. Also the Caucasus obstacle is a mountain barrier higher than the Alps with narrow passes that lend themselves to defence. Baku lies 50 miles beyond the Caucasus. it is only a limited objective - involves crossing Alps in a 600 mile advance. The comparison of the maximum advance made by the flower of the German army in 1941, - the 450 miles from Bessarabia to Taganrqg - affords fair grounds for Russia’s Sober, long-term, confidence; The Germans when their offensive starts in the south - When Stalin decided in 1930 to put his main war indus- Even so Baku is a far c.iy. It is 600 miles distant Thus the German army’s objective - as has been shown Yours sincerely.The Public Relations Officer, Persian Gulf, presents his compliments to Hhm Hon 1 bio the Political Resident in the Persian Culf, Bushire.

We realise, of course, that 1&lt; eal conditions vary, but we believe certain common principles exist and Justify an exchange of information on repaying practices# We should therefore welcome mn account of your past experience and future plans on the points set out below: 1# Many Arabs know that a German victory would mean an end to all Aral national aspirations, and they are undoubtedly eager that Britain should not be beaten - at least too badly# They are probably acquainted with Germany's record of racial discrimination, religious persecution and aggr«s«ion# So far, however, even the pro-Britiah Arabs have on the whole been passive sympathisers# Gan more active collaboration be sourht with advantage ? 2# Pro-British sympathies vary in different Arab com tries and ' muni ties, and consequently different approaches are required# Common prin ciples, however, exist* Do you therefore agree that a common policy to pro mote Arab collaboration, as above, by an appeal to their self-interest # should be pursued* What are the essontial points in this policyf 5* It follows that the exposure of German racial philosophy, designs upon the Arab world and 'new order' must continue* How can the scope of this work be enlarged and more definitely related to the guidance of Arab syznpath- | leers towards our own objectives? 4* Broadcasting, British or Axis, is probably the moat effective single propaganda Instrument* Y&amp;at part should it play or what general messages should it carry in order to gain this more active Arab support? Similarly, how can we further increase our own broadcasting prestige and decrease that of the Axis? (a) What inducements could be devised to lead Arabs to concentrate more on listening to our broadcasts? Cen 1 cal advertisement be pushed? Can Arab sympathisers got cafes to switch on to London or Cairo? (b) Can the reliability and truthfulness of our broadcasts be hammered in more effectively and if so how? (c) Do you consider that the true spirit behind Axis broadcasts could be illustrated more fully and that the Gulf between their hatred, untruth and hypocrisy and the Arab mind could be exposed more convincingly? (d) Having made listeners more conscious of the insulting spirit of , s broadcasts, should we not large them to treat those with contempt or with general derision, noise and laughter? 5* Cen our Arab sympathisers be induced to refrain from reading Axis publications or to treat them with contempt; to destroy Axis publications, while passing on British, Allied and American publications to others? 6* Can we induce pro-British Arabs to resist ths temptation of spreading anti-British rumours while giving widest publicity to pro-British statements? 7* Should we not appeal more strongly to the religious aentiments of those of our Arab friends who realise that the issues which we tefend ere * skin to the spirit of Islam, while those represented by the Axle are incom patible with it? Should not such Arabs be enjoined to mobilise their spiri tual resources and pray for a British victory? 8* Should a special pamphlet be prepared on some such lines as 'How can , I help the cause of righteousness to win the war?' and distributed among our Arab friends? It might deal with: (a) How to react to broadcasts# (b) How to deal with those who are spreading false rumours* (o) How to treat the present war in conversation, in the family clrclf at school, in the b&amp;gfor, in business conversation#' I 2.

IQNISTHr OF INFOBMATION MAULT 3TSEET, LONDON, W.C.l Dear Bertram Thomas, For oar own guidance in producing publicity material, as well as for the mutual 'benefit of posts, we should be glad of your views as to the best ways of capitalising the sympathies of pro-British Arabs. We realise, of course, t hat local conditions vary, but we believe certain common principles exist and justify an exchange of information on repaying practices. We should therefore welcome an account of your past experience and future plans on the points set out below: 1. Many Arabs know that a G-erman victory would 4 mean an end to all Arab national aspirations, and they a|»e undoubtedly eager that Britain should not be beaten - at least too badly. They are probably acquainted with Germany’s record of racial discrimination, religious persecution and aggression. So far however, even the pro-British Arabs have on the whole been passive sympathisers. Gan more active collaboration be sought with advantage? 2. Pro-British sympathies vary in different Arab countries and communities, and consequently different approach es are required. Oommon principles, however, as above, by an appeal to their self-interest &gt; should be pursued. What are the essential points in this policy? 3. It follows that the exposure of German racial philosophy, designs upon the Arab world and T, new order' 1 must continue. How can the scope of this work be enlarged and more definitely related to the guidance of Arab sympathisers towards our own objectives? 4. Broadcasting, British or Axis, is probably the most effective single propaganda instrument. What part should it play or whatgeneral messages should it carry in order to gain this more active Arab support? Similarly, how can we further increase our own broadcasting prestige and decrease that of the Axis? a) What inducements could be devised to lead Arabs to concentrate more on listening to our broadcasts? Gan local advertisement be pushed? Gan Arab sympathisers get cafes to switch on to London or Cairo? b) Can the reliability and truthfulness of our broadcasts be hammered in more effectively and if so how? c) Do you consider that the true spirit behind Axis broadcasts could be illustrated more fully and that the gulf between their hatred, untruth and hypocrisy and the Arab mind could be exposed more convincingly? N d) Having ^ade listeners more conscious of the insulting spirit of Axis broadcasts, should we not urge them to treat those with contempt or with general derision, noise and laughter? 5. Gan our Arab sympathisers be induced to refrain from reading Axis publications or to treat them with contempt: to destroy Axis publications while passing on British, Allied and American publications to others? 6. Gan we induce pro-British Arabs to resist the tempta tion of spreading anti-British rumours while giving widest publicity to pro-British statements?- ^ - 7. Should we not appeal more strongly to the religious sentiments of those of our Arab friends who realise that the issues which we defend are akin to the spirit of Islam, while those represented hy the Axis are incompatible with it? Should not such Arabs be enjoined to mobilise their spiritual resources and pray for a British victory? 8 Should a special pamphlet be prepared on some such lines as r, How can I help the cause of righteousness to win the war? and distributed among our Arab friends? It might deal with (a) How to react to broadcasts. (b) How to deal with those who are spreading false (c) How to treat the present war in conversation, in the family circle, at school, in the bazaar, in business conversation. 9. Some of the above suggestions will already have been adopted by posts. We should welcome therefore any account of past experiences and possible future plans, and, in particular', we should like to ascertain your attitude to the general principle involved in the above observations. 10. This letter is being addressed to the Ministry representatives at Cairo, Jerusalem, Baghdad, Aden and Bahrain, H.M. Legation at Jeddah, and also to Mr. Tweedy and Miss Freya Stark for their observations. Sd.Public Relations Office, Persian Gulf, Bahrain. Dated the 31st May, 1942. A NOTE ON THE HURST QUESTIONNAIRE. The objects of the ciuestionnaire - (i ) 'Guidance in producing publicity material' aimed at (ii) 'Capitalising the sympathies of pro-British Arabs everywhere' do not I fear, open up a very promising field in this part of the Arab world at this time* Before answering the questions it would perhaps be helpful to you if i made one or two broad generalisations about the Gulf Arab and his psychological outlook. or academic circles of the Dig cities of the Middle East, Arabs may be met with who a o r | al . ^^erstandlng of the Issues at stake as we'see them, and with whom moral outweigh other considerations. But taere is a less advanced social culture in the Gulf v/herp A^«-h ern ideDlo f ies t&gt;ut dimly comprehended: and pro-British ^sualises 1 ^ 1 ^^ gQur® which the o uesti onnai re ^ nni nfl-nrori re ^ r .^ e ^cst part are unlettered and ^nl^a uei Their outlook is materialistic and opportunist. In the Gulf ports there is, of course, a mercantile class, as well as ^schoolmasters, mistresses, students and the like* a ? (1 rr 1 0 ^ P r i n ted publicity material reaches all adult reading elements; but it is not the literate town class that generally produces pro-British sympathisers. T^e ruling chiefs of the Gulf whose families have long been in treaty relations with us are, like their counter- parts in India, quite openly pro-British. So too the sailors and working class in the towns are generally well wishers of ours. But, in large, the Gulf Arab*s attitude is one of neutrality, sometimes of the benevolent kind, unloss he belongs to a new lettered class or is of foreign origin, in ca00 &gt; as with youth, it is in the fashion to be critical or an old order of things and be attracted by a new world in reverse as it were. But even where our Arab is genuinelv in sympathy, his attitude, active or passive, is determined more by considerations of how our victory or defeat will affect him personally than by belief in a righteous cause for its own sake. Psychologically the Arab has a GU¥A complex (GUWA Ar.* strength) — I mean that dominating his mentality is an instinctive respect for might, militancy, power, action. Hence, during the past few years, his admiration for Germany: ■ his scorn of Italy. That their avowed ideological aims are identical illustrates the point. This is not to suggest that Gulf Arabs are not affected by^propaganda. They are. But propaganda approaches of an idealistic kind, congenial to our shape of mind, are not so effective here as more realistic approaches. Individualism is another strongly marked characteristic Hence the assumption of »a common idealism*, or of *an ascertainable basis of self-interest common to our Arab supporters everywhere*, finds small support, I fear, in bac^ard areas such as ours, and scarcely forwards the hope i 1 ’ sympathies 21611 ^ &amp; oommon formula for capitalising their- 2 - ANSTOB3 TO OTTHSTIONNAIEE 1. The passiveness of pro-British sympathisers is directly related with the indecisive phase of the war. Active collaboration will he stimulated by Allied victories. 2. I cannot think of any self-interest common to all the Arab countries which we are not already exploiting. (See 9). 3 # While we frequently expose the real designs of the Germans and their conseq.uences for the Arabs, the local Arabs have not shown any particular interest in German political philosophy, or indeed in ours. The best medium for focussing attention is by having talks with them. 4. Broadcasting is definitely a most vital organ of propaganda in the towns; indeed, in this area, it is the only one open to the enemy. Here in Bahrain a great many ♦locals* listen i more regularly and attentively to broadcasts than the average European. Their favourite Arabic stations are London, Berlin, Ankara, Cairo and Bahrain. They balance the propaganda heard from Berlin with that from London, but it is Ankara that they think 100% credible becuase it is believed to be impartial. At the same time there is a general concensus of opinion that the B.B.C. give as good Arabic broadcast pro grammes &gt;as any in the world. London, they say, has two announcers without peer (SABUB - SABAGH); London’s non-political talks ere held to be of the first order: London’s prestige stands high in Persian Gulf estimation (educated). 5. (a) They do listen. The cafes never switch off so long as London, Cairo, or Bahrain is on the air. In the two principal market squares of Bahrain broadcasts in Arabic from London (morning and evening) and from Bahrain (evening) are bellowed from loud speakers. A feature in local broadcasts is local news which always acts as a draw. (b) They believe in the reliability and truthfulness of our ’news* bulletins. Our ’talks’ on the other hand they regard as tendentious. (c) Not wholly. Experience shows that it is profitable to rub in Axis untruthfulness . But assertions of Axis ha tred and hypocrisy* coming from us, are less convincingThe un-^ truthruiness of Axis broadcasting was beautifully illustrated in Bahrain last year following an abortive Italian air riad here, and this has cooked the BABI goose for all time. The Italian account of the damage to the local oil field was a travesty of the truth, -- the bombs fell wide, while the ships alleged’ to have been sunk in the harbour were known to the local Arab seafarers to have had no existence. These claims provided the Arebs wi th a yard stick for measuring Axis news elsewhere and at other times. (d) No. The local Arabs are contemptuous only of facist Italy. They seldom listen in to an Italian station and then usually for the fun of the braggadocio. Axis printed publications do not reach this part of the world. It is forbidden to listen to Axis broadcasts in the coffee shops and public places of Bahrain. 6.3 b 6 Spreading of anti-British rumours is best discouraged hy * personal contacts. One way of assuring wide publicity for a rumour is to have it whispered in confidence into the ear of an Arahi In case this sounds facetious, it might be recalled that in illiterate societies the spreading of news is foremost among subjects of conversation. The Majlis, an indigenous institution, is thus perfectly adapted for propaganda ends. 7. It must not be forgotten that here in the dulf slavery has the sanction of Islam; and the Grerman ambition to enslave others does not therefore shock the local Arab’s sense of religious proprieties. The Anglo-Saxon attitude towards the war, and the way the friendly Arab views it, have rarely the spiritual bond suggested in the Question, so that the idea of the Arab praying for a British victory would not, at least J in this area and at this time, suggest itself. As regards the conflict of ideas between Nazism and Islam the most effective pamphlet for this area would be in the form of a table of short pithy sentences set down side by side in antithesis viz. Hitler says The Nazis tell us but Allah in the Koran says but Allah in the Koran says 8. The present would not be a propitious moment in the Persian Qulf for the issue of such a circular* 9 After long experience - some twenty years lived in close association with the peoples across the Islamic world in Morocco, Trans-Jordan, Iraq, the Persian CJulf and Arabia - it would seem to me (a) that our present Arabic propaganda material provides all the scope necessary for local adapta tion everywhere, but that (b) despite the common religion and common tongue, the difficulties of devision the •common formula* applicable everywhere are sometimes very real, on account of divergences in the cultural development, regional politics and economic life of the component parts. In close-knit urbanised societies elsewhere a spate of newspapers using the jargon of 20th century international politics might well be the criterion of effective propaganda. This emphasis of course is out of place and ineffectual in the wide sweeps of our Middle East where, as here, potential war zones are inhabited by backward semi -patriarchal people. Economic self-interest has regional implications. One example: the Persian G-ulf derives the greater pcr^ Ox - s livelihood from the production and sale of natural pearls: the natural enemy of the GS-ulf Arab is thus his Japanese nv 1, who has almost ruined him by flooding the world’s markets with cultured pearls. This is an item of anti -Axis propaganda of immense local self-interest: here it cannot be plugged too often: elsewhere one can see that it might. taokgroant! 0n irmo?e U aaTancer^ai m count?ies moiern education^ fuljl cassia i n Iraq, for instance, have of late years openly . « •professed free-thinkers. On the other hand the ruling chiefs of the Persian Gulf, who, like Ihn Sa'ud, are uneducated in the academic sense, are, like him, Moslems of a stricoly traditional school. The resent introduction of schools wi t European curricula may in time lead here, as elsewhere, to a change4 change from a stable and resigned outlook on life rooted in traditionalism to one that is secular, rationalistic, politico volatile. Our best propaganda approach is the one shaped by local existing realities. Any propaganda successes the G-ermans have scored locally are thought to have been due less to German propaganda technique than to German military successes. With the turn in the tide of our military fortunes our pro-British Arabs will grow in number and enthusiasm. Meanwhile, in the Gulf - it is one of the great potential oilfields of the East, and is besides, a major Russian supply route, so that it may well attract Axis attentions - the propaganda aim that seems of pre-eminent value at this moment is the one that is best calculated to promote a friendly countryside. To this end, one tours and film-showing gain wide and friendly contacts; the distribution of our excellent publicity material best achieves its ends if it is aided by friendly personal intercourse: we are always able to strike a right note for our Persian Gulf listeners through the means of local broadcasting. The Gulf area is one of wide expanses. Scattered hereditary oligarchies, friendly to us, are centres of influence but seldom of learning or moral exaltation. War partisanship is not primarily a matter of intellectual persuasion. Our field of action is where we meet our friends on common ground. Notably, one subject of abiding interest to the Gulf Arab - shipowner and trader as he often is - is sea-warfare and what is germane to it, blockade, shipping, overseas markets, the means of supplying his wants. This, of course, can contain the seed of noxious as well as of healthy propaganda: peradventure it is what lies at the roots of his war sympathies. I am sorry to have to draw so unattractive and primitive a picture but it would be wrong to disguise the truth of the matter which is, that the Arabs of these parts are less susceptible to the lofty appeals of our altruism than to the attractions of our band-waggon. Of course they will learn. Meanwhile, they are reached by the simplest representation of items that have a definite meaning within their experience, such, for instance, as the thesis that British seapower is the mainspring of their security without which they could not trade with an outside world. Then, too, a valuable propaganda aid in a centre such as the Gulf, where the population is thin-spread and every body of importance is knowable, lies in the cultivation of ftiendly personal contacts. Bertram Thomas Public Relations Officer in the Persian Gulf.Weekly report about public opinion in Bahrain, There has been no change in public opinion in respect of the North African battle. As regards the fighting in Russia, the public say that the Germans are making quick and successful advances in the Caucasus region and in some circles it is thought that the Germans will reach the Russo-Iranian frontier in a few days. This German advance caused some alarm amongst the local jews who think that it is not opportune now to proceed to or do any business transaction with Iraq as they think Iraq will be in danger once the Germans reach the Iranian frontier. The people are following events in India with great interest as all the local merchants depend on India for their trade but they do not think that conditions will go from bad to worse as long as the Government has the situation v/ell in hand. The public do not seem to be having any sympathy with the Congress movement as they think the step taken by Ghandi and % his colleagues at this particular time is quite unwise.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Department.

The Broadcasting Stations of the Allies, Turkey and the enemy were speaking last week of the danger and imminent fall of Stalingrade, which have made the people to be stronger in their belief that the danger to the fear Bast is very near. This belief has been emphasised 1 by the arrival of the Sugar to Bahrain. They say that this sugar was shipped to Iran enroute for Russia, but when the Allies saw the danger, they ordered its storage here. There is no comment on the lull in Egypt this week. The public have again turned their attention to the small successes of the Japanese forces in New Guinea. They say that the Japanese have built a railway from Burma to Singapore within the last four months, v/hich will be used for the transport of troops and war materials to Burma lev'their preparation to attack India.Telegram Q.

The Public Relations Officer, Bahrain. Memorandum . I have been informed that it is the popular belief in Bahrain that the large consignments of sugar which have recently arrived for storage here were originally intended for Russia via Iran, but have been diverted here because the situation in Russia was thought to be too precarious to warrant their being sent there. Will you kindly give such publicity as you think desirable to the true facts, which are that the Middle East Supply Centre are building up a reserve of sugar for eventual use in Iran and Iraq^ and have chosen Bahrain as the most suitable place for storing it.Weekly report on the public opinion on the war. This week the people have changed their opinion and say that the German forces have got tired in their drive on Stalingrad, which has not surrendered in spite of the incessant fire from land and air. All the people are expressing their admiration for the Russians, who have^fighting back their enemy with such unprecedented bravery. If the Germans succeed to dapture Sthlingrad, their land forces will not go farther, neither to the Near East nor to the North of Russia, during winter but consolidate their positions and prepare for the coming spring. They say that Rommell has not sufficient forces to break through the strong Allies defence lines on the Egyptian frontier. As the Pacific battle is in favour of the Japanese they say that Port Mozbey is threatened, which if captured in the near future, Darv/in will be in danger.- Telegram Q From Political Agent, Ba hrain, To Political Resident, Bushire No. 6&lt;J4 Dated 19th September 194&amp; Public Opinion.

They say that the Germans have become weak. Have they had the same strength when they attacked the other European states they would have easily crushed down the Russian resistance in Stalingrad and other fronts in Russia. As regards the Egyptian front, there is no comment this week.

Some of them, who heard Hitler's speech, say that the Germans after occupying the whole area of the Caucasian oil , fields, concentrate their air forces to raid the British Isles in revenge of the numerous raids made by the R.A.F. on Germany and the occupied countries, to v/hich many damages have been made. V/hile others are still of the opinion that the Germans will take advantage of the winter and come down to the Hear East. About the battle in Egypt. Those who are of the opinion that the Germans concentrate their air forces on the British Isles say that Rommell has overwhelming forces to drive on Egypt, but he is holding his ground only to induce the British to bring more forces and material to this front.

During last week Ankara (turkey) once broadcasted that the Germans dropped railway lines on Stalingrad from a height of 2500 feet to frighten the Russian troops which made a horrible noise in the sky. This has caused the general public to suspect that the Germans have not supplies of bombs to continue their bombardment on Stalingrad, but they strongly believe that the Germans will sooner or later conquer the Russians in Stalingrad and the Caucasian region. As the lull is still continuing in Egypt it has not been brought into their usual gossip.

This week the public turned their attention to the battle in Egypt. They describe it as football playing ground. Each time one force drived the ball to the viqnity of the other f s goal. They say it is now the turn of the British to advance with the ball against the Germans. As regards this advance, the public are divergent in their opinion. Some of them say that the British have large forces in this front and if they do not stop their attack on the Axis forces they will succeed to turn them out. V/hile others say that the Germans are deceiving the Briti^i in their withdrawal and that such withdrawals with some sacrifies were made in the past, which gave the British ground to advance and then returned on their backs. Russia - The public still comment on the bravery of the Russian defenders in Stalingrad, which has become a slaughter-house for them and the Germans.

PoliticalWeekly report on the public opinion about the war. The public are giving much interest to the North African battle. From the contineous withdrawal of the Axis forces there, they have begun to lose their belief of the German might and to praise the British for their forebearance all this time. They say that the Americans have not yet completed their war resources, otherwise the Axis will be defeated very quickly. They undervalue the Japanese power as they did in the past for the Italians. They say that Spain and Turkey are now in danger of invasion by the Allies, who will attempt to reach the Balkan through Turkey or France through Spain, so Turkey and the latter reinforced their borders against sudden attacks.i * % Local reactions to the war news and situation have continued to be wholly favourable. German propaganda has suffered considerable discredit because the usual formula of resounding oX German victories has suddenly and for the first time been dropped. Yesterday morning’s Berlin Arabic broadcast, for instance, was not the usual bulletin but little more than a catalogue of food and fuel shortages in Britain - this not impressive material for Arab auditors. Stimulated confidence in money is thought to be favourable to merchants’ interests and there are signs of optimism about the war in general. B. T. 22.11.»42. 'Pa.

In 1940 Britain not merely ade the decision to continue lighting alone hut actually laid dean a. great s t r a. tegic pi an o f v icto ip-. Ti i s s t r a t c g i c p 1 an wa r&gt; to put a ring of encirclement around Hitier and hole that ring until'the United Hations had tine to gather their forces. This ring of encirclement laid iown by Britain extends tfirough forth for ray via Iceland, Gibraltar, 1 alta, Egypt and Iraq. The determination to hold this ring was, in fact, offensive strategy since if the ring could be held until the United fations grew in strength and had time to gather their forces an offensive could be launched from, the mediter ranean area right at the heart of the Axis. Two places v/ieie Hitler tried hardest to break out of this strategic ring with which Britain had encircled him were t (1) the Mediter ranean, (2) by lard, via Russia. How is the time to repeat all over the world the full story of how Britain with utterly inferior numerical forces on the sea, on the land and in the air, held the ring tight for two years in the • • e citerraneon alone and thus made possible the events of today. The following da ta concern those sea and air operations in the Mediterranean which at the time seemed merely defensive but were in fact a part of the great offensive strategy Ur.Churchill laid down in 1940 for the ulti’ ate collapse of the Axis. Let us take first our sea operations in the Mediterranean from 1940 to 1942. In June 1940 when Italy entered the war .she had in the Mediterranean six battle ships, seven 8-inch gun cruisers, fourteen 6-inch gun cruisers, one hundred and thirty-one destroyers and torpedo- boats and one hundred and four submarines. On the 26th May, 1942, Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham who commanded the British Fleet in the Mediterranean in 19 40-1941 •, and who directs the Anglo-American naval operations in the Mediterranean, revealed: 'In June 1940 Britain had in the Mediterranean a little more than a token force. ’hen Italy entered the war, our Fleet there consisted of a few cruisers and destroyers and nothing else ft In-joint Anglo-French strategy the holding of the Mediter ranean was mainly to have been the task of the French Fleet. Thus when France collapsed complete sea control of the Mediterranean by the Axis seemed assured. Then t ake sir pcwer. At t hi s s a me tire Ax i s numerical and qualitative superiority in the Mediterranean was overwhelming. Mere are the figures; The frontline Italian air the British between two force available lor the purpose of smashing ring around the Axis in the Uec.iterranean was thousand and two thousand five hundred aircraft.whereby the strategic ring was held. And in this connection it is interesting to note that curing the whole three years of the war in the l editerranean the British Navy has not lost a single ship by enemy surface action. First action: Calabria, Cth July, 1940. The Italians tried to draw the British Mediterranean Fleet close to the Italian coasts m order to destroy it by sea and air power. F.h.S. 'Warspite” damaged the Italian flag ship at twenty-six thousand yards and chased the Italian fleet to within sight of the Calabrian coast. Heavy bor ting attacks were made on the British fleet by the greater part of the Italian Metropolitan air forces but were completely unsuccessful although the 'barspite” alone had five hundred bombs dropped around her. We had no fighters at sea to Intercept these attacks. For months after this, the Italian fleet avoided cruising into the open Mediterranean. The next great action was Taranto - since the Italians wouldn’t come out, Britain went in. At Taranto on the night of 11/12 November, 1940, three Italian battle ships were heavily damaged, two actually partly submerged after an attack by our Fleet air arm. Two cruisers and two Fleet auxiliaries were also badly damaged. Italy’s effective battleship strength was thus halved at least for many months. Y/hat is worth stressing is the great courage and audacity of the utterly outnumbered British naval forces which brought attacking aircraft to within one hundred and fifty miles of the enemy’s main naval base. But between the battles of Calabria and Taranto, memorable Fleet actions occurred. In the first place again and again convoys were passed during this period right through the entire length of the Mediterranean including the Narrows in spite of enormous Axis air superiority of land-based aircraft along the whole length of the Narrov/s. Also on the 19th July, 1940, the cruiser 'Sydney” engaged two Italian cruisers each more powerful and faster than herself, and yet sank 'Bartholomeo Colleoni” and put the other to flight. Also our cruiser 'Ajax” on the 2nd October, 1942, in a single- handed action against an Italian heavy cruiser and seven destroyers, sank three destroyers and put the cruiser to flight. After Taranto the Italian fleet was reduced almost to impotence arid the locking of the British strstegic ring via the Mediterranean became an accomplished fact. Now comes phase 2. Germans saw in the spring of 1941 that Italy was nearly out of the war. So they ran reinforcements to fill the gap. Here then we get a great diversion of German air forces and later a considerable diversion of German land forces in an attempt to break the British strategic ring in the Mediterranean. Over four hundred German firstline craft, long-range divebombers, fighters and reconnaissance machines were based on Sicily in the spring of 1941. In spite of this, large British convoys continued to pas ., right through the Mediterranean including British convoys going to Greece with whole divisions of men; added to this the British offensive in Libya was supported from the sea. But heavy losses were sustained. The first attack on the 'illustrious” was made on the 10th January, 1941. In all ten attacks within twenty-four hours were made on this aircraft-carrier at sea and in Malta. In a second attack forty German divebornbers were concentrated on the 'Illustrious” alone. Several heavy bombs hit her and fires broke out fore and aft - the ship steering out of action with a heavy list. Yet the 'Illustrious” steered by engines continued to beat off all subsequent attacks with her ack ack guns and was saved. Next, on the 27th March, 1941, emboldened by the German air forces the Mediterranean Italian fleet again put to sea with the purpose of cutting British convoy routes toGreece. In the battle of Matapan, the forces en^a^ea vrerej on the Italian c ;id.e three battleships and eleven cruisers; on the British side three battleships, one air craft carrier, four cruisers. The result; three Italian heavy cruisers, one Italian light cruiser and tv/o Italian destroyers were sunk. Also a new battleship of the '’Vittorio” class was dan aged. Fo damage or casualties were sustained by any British ship although part of the action took place at night at pointblank range, next, m Fovember 1941, tv/o Axis convoys v/ere annihilated attempting to cross the Central Mediterranean at night. After the entry of Japan into the war in December 1941, British forces in the Mediterranean were gravely depleted, yet still the strategic ring held. Hitler that winter with seven hundred aircraft in Sicily attempted the complete destruction of Malta and the final breaking of the British strategic barrier to his penetration all over Africa. But the British Mediterranean Fleet now hopelessly outnumbered and with little more than light craft yet kept Malta supplied, and destroyed over one third of all the Axis shipping attempting to reach Africa, e,g., on the 22nd March, 1942, Admiral Vian escorting convoy from Bgypt to Malta with nothing more than a light cruiser force met and defeated an enemy intercepting force consisting of a battle ship, two heavy cruisers, four other cruisers and a great number of destroyers. The British destroyers went to within three miles of the Italian battleships and scored hits with torpedoes. The Italian force withdrew and our convoy got through. Again the famous convoy of August 1242 was attacked for three nights and two days in the Mediterranean Narrows by U-boats and E-boats plus all the aircraft the Axis could muster and with enemy minefields laid in its path. Yet the convoy got through although with the loss of E.M.S. 'Eagle', two cruisers, and one destroyer. So Malta was saved. Here we see in brief a picture of those naval actions from June 1940 up to the opening of the Anglo-American offensive in North Africa of November 1942 which kept tight that strategic ring which Churchill had laid down in 1940 around Hitler, and which has made everything else possible. Perhaps the greatest point of all to notice regarding British naval and air achievements in the Mediterranean in this war is the Elizabethan quality of courage and daring displayed throughout. It is this youthful Elizabethan quality of attacking because one is utterly outnumbered that has distinguished the whole of these past two years, and which answers better than any words Hitler's snd Mussolini’s pre-war accusations of 'British decadence'. Yours sincerely, \ /EPA. To: E. B. Wakefield, Esq., I.C.S., Political Agent, BAHRAIN.Allied war successes during the past week have continued to have a very good effect on local opinion.

Significance of Russian offensive fully realised and this, combined with continued Allied successes in Africa, has had excellent effect on local sentiment. Political Agent, Bahrein,4 which, if carried out, will not be resisted by the French there, as the other colonies did, Spain - They say that Spain will take the Axis side, because the present Government and its leader, General Franco, are fascist.I Weekly report on public opinion about the war. Russia - They say that though the German troops are tired in this front they will do their best to hold on during winter season d&gt;f which the Russians are taking advantage and making counter attacks on German defences. North Africa - The conquest of Tunis, they say, is the conquest of North Africa. If the Axis • are driven out of this field, the danger to the Near East will be very far and especially to Egypt and Syria. Far East - No comments this week. Italy - They say that Italy has been given a small part of the lesson the R.A.F. is going to teach her. From now on as a result of the continued R.A.F. raids on the important and strategic places in Italy, the latter will deal with the evacuation of the civil population only. Mr.Churchill*s speech - Last week Mr.Chuchill made a speech in London in which he gave the facts of the war whether in favour of the British or against them. They say that the British, in war or peace, declare the facts as they had happenedll ! ’ and that they are straight in their work. But When Mussollini made his speech, he said 'No use of speeches long as the guns are firing', they agreed with his view and say that advances and retreats of either side has no effect until the war is ended.hXPRLbS Iik'JTkR From - Political Agent, Bahrain. To - Political Resident, at Bahrain* Mo.C/1631. Dated the 5th Decemoer 1942. Public opinion. Interest has been excited primarily by two items (!) Russian orfensive (2) Mr. Churchill*s speech. Regarding (1), Russian prestige has reached a new peak in local Arab estimation. Uerman propaganda which last year featured total annihilation of Russian armies and exhaustion of Russian resources has been seriously discredited. Regarding (2), Arabs lwho have special antipathy to Italians) welcomed with feelings of pleasur able anticipation Churchill , s warnings of what will happen to Italian towns in next phase of war. Political Agent, Bahrain.(W) /V** Weekly report on the public opinion about the war. Russia - They say that the Russians will re-capture many strategic points and gain ground in Central as well as in Stalingrad by taking advantage of both the winter and the continuous flow of supplies from the Allies. North Africa - In this field they say that Romel had played his part on the Allies and kept them in the dark about his forces, which caused the Allies to consentrate forces and bring more materials before his Withdrawal to Triploian borders, but the public here are still considering that the Tunisian battle will be the decisive one for either party. Far East - They say that the Japanese are retreating from New Guinea because fof the distant line of communications between their forces and the Supply Bases and also because of the possible-attack on Burma by the Allies they have re-inforcing their defences in Burma. ' ^ France - They say^/though France has been defeated and the populations have been supressed by the Germans the French people never co-operate with them at all,“Til ' \ but play their part in favour of the Allies. They say that the French leaders can not leave France together but one by one. New proposition. The British and their Allies will do good to the Chinese if an attack enlarge scale is carried out on Burma to re-open the Supply ute to China, becausejthe latter lacks only supplies.EXFRhSS ijETTKE I VX To From Politicti Agent, Bahrain. political Resident in tne Persian liuif. at Bahrain.

C.G.Prior, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf who was accompanied by Major T. Hick in- bo than, O.B* Political Agent, Kuwait, attended the meeting* 1. The B.B.C* Arabic transmission (1700-1815 G.M.T.) was discussed around a criticism of the lateness of the hour at which the News Bulletin item of it is received in Bahrain in winter* This lateness by local standards arises from the fact that the Arab clock is regulated by sunsets sunset being 12 ©•clock so that whereas G.II*T* reckoned from midday is a constant by our standards, it is variable by theirs, the difference increas ing with B* longitude. Thus in summer the Arabic Hews Bulletin from London is heard one hour after sunset whereas at this time of the year it has to be waited for till nearly three hrurs after sunset, i.e.* at a time when some well-to-do people (possessors of radios) are thinking of going to bed, and the coffee shops, which cater for the non-radio-possessing class, are about to close. It was not thought desirable to request any change in the time of the London Arabic programme (i.e., G.M.T. 1700-1815), but it was felt that a change in the order of the items of the programme so that the News Bulletin (a main feature) be broadcast early on in the programme instead of late as at present (an advance of, say, half an hour) would, if possible to arrange, be locally advantageous. 2. The supercession an Tuesday evenings of the 'Hews Heel' item was regretted, though it is too early to make comparisons with 'Howla al Alam', the new feature. The first reactions to 'Nedwat al Mustamin'' feature were favourable. 3* It was said that no local interest had been aroused by any Axis broadcast that may have been made promising safe conduct to pilgrim ships. A similar Axis declaration last year was recalled and a view expressed that it achieved no credit in local eyes because of the condfclons attaching to it such as the requirement of the name of the ship, the port she was lying at and when she was putting to sea, etc. 4. A suggestion was made that another series of talks from London by Dr. Taha Husain would be welcomed. His last series seem now to be held in high estimation. 5. The following suggestions were raised In connexion with local Bahrain broadcasts- 2 - (a) the advance of transmission hour by half an hour to 0700 p.m* local time, subject to (i) this not clashing with a popular Arabic statical or (ii) leaving the field open at 0800 p,». to an enemy station* (b) the use of a proper formula by the announcer following the news bulletin and before the playing of gramaphone records*Political Agent, Bahrain.

The Axis forces are continuing their withdrawal in the Russian and North African fields. The public express their admiration for the forebearance of the British who have stubbornly and boldly withheld the aggression of the Axis, when the latter were very powerful. They also speak of the Russian bravery in driving back their enemies, who are now retreating on a 2000 mile front. They say that the Russians have not been able to hold their lines if not for the British and American help. All the people have turned the table of stories on the Axis and speak of their inability to win this war. Still there are some who say that they cannot judge the Axis withdrawl on both front without resistance, but they think that if the Germans have not advanced in the coming spring, it means that they will not advance at all and loss the w n r.' TALKI1IG POINTS CIRCULAR Ho.C/5. Dear KIDDLE. EAST: Public Relations Office, Persian Gulf, Bahrain, In 1942, the fighter, fighter-bomber and light bomber squadrons in the Kiddle East have flown 30,000 opera tional sorties. In the hardest days 1 fighting at EL AL ALE I IT they flew as many as 1000 sorties a day. In raids on enemy landing-grounds, they have destroyed between 500 and 600 hostile aircraft. In their bombing and strafing attacks on enemy concentrations and columns, they put out of action more than 100 enemy tanks and armoured cars, and v/recked, at a con servative estimate, some 5,000 enemy transport vehicles - petrol and water bowsers, troop carriers, guns and supply lorries. The number of enemy aircraft shot down in the Middle East during 1942 was 1,784. During the year Malta fighters destroyed 773 enemy aircraft, with nearly 300 others listed as ,f probables'. R.A.F. losses in aircraft in this time v/ere 195, but from these 89 pilots were saved. Malta AA gunners shot down 182 Axis aircraft. The total number of enemy aircraft destroyed by anti-aircraft defences over Britain is 738. The R.A.F. from Malta attacked 46 convoys, six single vessels and five naval forces, with the result that 46 ships were either sunk, severely damaged, or left in flames. About 40 other ships were attacked and damaged. Naval aircraft backed up these attacks with 37 ships hit with bombs or tor pedoes, including four cruisers and two destroyers. The grand total of Malta shipping strikes is thus 83 ships hit, with 52 'probables”. Allowing for the fact that a medium-sized supply ship carries the equivalent of six long goods trains of muni tions or stores Malt a has in the year sent to the bottom something like 500 goods trains. During the enemy's attempt to neutralise the island he dropped 12,000 tons of bombs on Malta. Now' Malta is strik ing back. So far, with its limited resources, its aircraft have dropped 1500 tons of bombs on the enemy in North Africa and Sicily. These aircraft are now flying three times as many operational hours as in the most active week in the summer. 513 enemy aircraft v/ere found abandoned on 120 landing-grounds in Egypt and Libya after the Battle of Egypt. 404 of these were German, 106 v/ere Italian and three were French. 51$ of the total were fighters, 33$ bombers, 13$ trans port aircraft and 3$ gliders. BOMBS: A 2,000-lb. bomb can destroy 25,000 square ft. and severely damage 75,000 sq. ft. by blast. 300 tons of bombs can completely destroy a square mile and damage by blast proportionetely.2 U. S.A, The American Air Force numbers one million men, of whom tens of thousands are pilots. This is sexteen times as big as it was in July 1940. Aircraft production in U.S.A. has passed 5GCC nlanes oer month. it is expected that this figure will be doubled' in 1943. 3| times as many aircraft were produced m 1942 as in 1941. The total produced was 49,000 aircraft. In the Winter of 1941 President Roosevelt anticipated a pro duction of 135,000 aircraft in U.S.A. during 1942 and 1943. 1,000,000 workers are employed building them. GENERAL: The Royal Air Force is now stronger than the Luftwaffe and the Italian Air Force combined. It has undergone an increase in size during the past twelve months of 33-g per cent. It is still growing. 5,000 aircraft have been destroyed by Fighter Command since the start of the war. The Germans are using the service of 1,500,000 full-time adult v/orkers in their system of Air Raid Defences. About half of these are uniformed and highly skilled members of the armed forces.

North Africa - The people say that the Allied forces in this sector will shortly drive out the Axis from North Africa, so Mr.Churchill paid a visit to .

When the Allies have completed th ^^ yi0t0ry in ■ lorth Africa, they want to help Russia aEfl forces and materials, which have to be taken there by the shorter way through the Black Sea. The object of Ur Churchill's visit to Turkey was to ask the Turks to give free passage to the Allied transport of troops and materials through the Straits. The Turks have agreed because they have become confident of the Allied final victory. Georing, in one of his speeches, said that 'we were deceived by the Finnis-Russo war'.

As regards Tunisia, they t say that the Axis want only a defencive line to /busy the Allies in this field in order to prevent them not to divert*their attacks to Italy and its Islands. They also prbphes^ed that the Turks will enter the war on the side of the Allios, which if it has taken place, it would prolong the war.

Now the people have become more confident of Turkey to enter this war on the side of the British and their Allies. The present fortification of Bulgaria by the Germans have led them to believe this.

The main ast week was whether the Germans will carry out an attack on Russia this summer. They say that the Germans have found it useless to occupy during summer and leave/winter, so they are now transferring their armies from that sector to other parts of Europe and Italy to ore^re their defences against any possible attack. They are giving importance to the heavy raids made by the R.A.E. and the American Air Arms on the important and strategic places in Germany and other parts of the occupied Europe, which they say that this action has crippled the Germans in supplying their armies to fight. They also give much importance to the speeches of Mr. Churchill and his movements. inTele gram Q Political Agent, Bahrain. To Political Resident, Bushirc.

Dated the 5th June, 194-3. / i I ASPECTS OF GLOBAL STR ATEGY Casablanca ! s apparently categorical 'Hitler First' strategy has been modified at Washington in this sense, that the United Nations are to conduct their operations to the fullest possible extent concurr ently in both hemispheres, in fact, of course, there was never any question of abandoning any front in favour of another. Equally there will remain until the final victory complicated questions of priority in various supplies. But I4r.Churchill*s statements to the American Press, while leaving Hitler guessing as to when and where the next blow will fall, have reiterated the first principle of aid and relief to Russia and have served to reassure China, India and Australia that they will not be left in jeopardy. None of the three aggressor nations can any longer hope to evade retribution at the expense of their partners. European Outlo ok: (a) German Defence System; It is worth recording that the Germans have devised two systems of defence - an outer and an inner. The outer system corresponds to the ancient Germanic system of 'marks', or defended buffer states, which take the shock of external attacks. Nazi Germany is ensconced within a ring of such territories each with coastal defences - Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, France, Italy and the Balkans. It had been intended to extend that ring by conquering the Caucasus, Egypt and the Middle East. The defences of the inner fortress are along the Rhine, the Black Forest, the Alps and Dinaric Alps, the Balkans, the Carpathians and a series of fortified positions in depth behind the Russian front. No doubt plans for invading Europe were concerted far ahead at the Casablanca conference, but great changes have taken place since then. Demoralisation in Italy, growing resistence in the occupied and satellite countries, and increasing pressure on Germany herself as. regards manpower and weakening of her war production by the tremendous Anglo-American air offensive which is still far from its peak, might cause Allied leaders to decide to strike with all their power at the inner fortress. In that case the shortest approaches to the inner fortress are through Holland and some part of the Balkans. (b) Holland. P ros a nd Consf Holland offers the most direct access to German soil. Other advantages would be the short sea route from Britain to the Allied base in Europe and a population which is seething with anger against the Germans and is ripe for action as the result of recent attempts to reintern all members of the Dutch armed forces and to deport Dutch students to Germany en masse. Drawbacks are that the Germans have built exceptionally strong coastal defences here and have demolished houses and evacuated residents along the coastline to strengthen the defence. A landing here would be extremely costly, but success would open the way to the Ruhr, the heart of industrial Germany, which has already been devastated by fire and flood. (c) Greece and t he Balkans: If, on the other hand, the Balkans are selected as the point of entry, Greece would offer many advantages. Despite appalling privations, morale is high and resistance to the enemy is practically universal while pro-British feeling is ardent. The country is divided into three areas of occupation, German, Italian and Bulgarian. The • • • Italians•c • • • the - 2 - _V 9 Italians hold with certain exceptions the mainland 5 Ionian islands and the islands of the Aegean. The Germans have reserved for thenselv vital areas including the Piraeus, Salamis and Salonika and an around it, the islands of Mytelena, Lemnos and Chios, and most of ur:,;. Bulgarians occupy eastern Macedonia and most of Greek Thrace. An Allied invasion of eastern Macedonia and Greek Thrace, v/here Bulgarian atrocities have earned the loathing of the Greek popu lation, would be a direct challenge to Bulgaria, v/hich is in a state of extreme political tension as the result of a series of assassinations of pro-Nazi officials. There is a good deal of evidence that a vigorous underground movement against the German alliance and its supporters is being developed by the Agrarians, Democrats and Communists 0 A direct Allied threat to Bulgaria might well precipitate a revolution. f, If K , writes the Turkish paper 'Vatan 1 , 'Bulgaria does not panic, she will be the first country in Europe to be smashed. It is hard to believe that Bulgarians will fight against the Allies'. Such a move would certainly be the signal for widespread revolt by guerillas throughout Yugoslavia and Greece and political tension is hardly less acute in Rumania than in Bulgaria. For such an enterprise a very strong Allied army could no doubt be assembled in the Levant or Alexandria, including the Britis&gt; Ninth and Tenth Armies of the Middle East. The chief impediment woiixa be that the entrances to the Aegean are guarded by Crete and the Dodecanese, and its enclosed waters would be very dangerous for large convoys until the numerous German and Italian airfields on the islands and the Greek mainland are rendered unusable and Allied air supremacy has been established. It may be that reconquest of Crete would be a necessary preliminary, but modern air and sea power combined might make it possible to neutralize an island outpost vdthout even attacking it at all with ground forces. (d) Northern possibilities; Release of shipping and escort vessels resulting-' from the command of the short Mediterranean route and the rapid growth of Allied air power now make it possible to build up Iceland and/or northern Scotland from defensive bastions into springboards for attack on northern Norway. Advantages would be; the support of the population, which is on its toes ready for the word 'go' from its liberators; the cutting of the important iron ore supply route from Narvik to Germany, and direct contact with the Finns, who, if assured of Anglo-American food supply, might well decide to abandon the war, with important results for the Leningrad sector of the Russian front. If such an attack induced the German fleet to come out, the British Navy would welcome the event with an enthusiasm similar to that with which they would greet a fleet action with the Italians in the Mediterranean. The chief points against the project are the length of a sealine of supply of over 400 miles and the fact that the invading troops could not at first be given fighter c /er except from aircraft-carriers. (e) Fra nce an d I taly; Another possible form of attack is on the outer defences of Germany and would be a simultaneous invasion of France from Britain in the north and Bizerta in the south. The Germans have been making feverish efforts since last November to fortify the Riviera and the north coast of France from Calais to Brest, the most heavily defended section of the West Wall. On the other hand, the Allies could bring overwhelming sea and air power to bear, and dual thrusts of this sort would compel the Germans to weaken their whole position by a wide dispersion of troops and transport. Finally, there is Italy. Although occupation of Sicily and Sardinia might appear to be an obvious preliminary, possession of these islands is not essential for an attack on the Italian mainland. If they can be temporarily neutralized by overwhelming air and sea power while the invasion of Italy is taking place, they, like Crete, would automatically fall in our hands. The extremely powerful air force under Air Marshal Tedder has already plastered the ports and airfields of these two islands, and it may not be long before the Luftwaffe and) / - 3 - the Regia Aeronautica are pushed back into Italy itself. Moreover the successful attacks on Italian shipping by British submarines around their coasts is an indication that naval blockade is beginning to grip the islands. It seems possible, therefore, that direct blows may be directed against the heart of Italy across the Tyrhennian Sea and also up the Adriatic. Anything may happen in Italy at any time; but it should not be forgotten that the Italian soldier usually fights most resolutely on his own soil. 'Viva II DuceJ', it is reported, is being rapidly superseded by the cry 'Vive II Re’' and there is no question that the prestige of Mussolini and the Fascist Party has sunk to zero. Criticism of present corruption and inefficiency and of the German alliance is now quite open. What will Germany do ? (a) The I talian Li ability: There are at present no signs of German divisions being sent to Italy’s aid. Italy, with her heavy demands on German coal and other -v raw materials for factories, is a German liability, whereas the Balkans, , with their oil, minerals and foodstuffs, are an important asset. If Hitler decides to leave his ally to shift for herself and retires behind the Brenner, he will conserve manpower and resources; but he will deal a staggering blow to German prestige in the satellite countries; he will be faced with the necessity of replacing some 10 to 12 Italian divisions who have hitherto been doing police duty for him in the Balkans; and German people in a hostile world will lose the moral support of an 'Axis'. (b) Su mmer Campaign in Russia : There is abundant evidence that the Germans are concentrating very formidable forces, especially as regards heavy tanks, in the Byelgorod sector of the Russian front, to north of Kharkov and against Leningrad. The impending offensive will be extremely dangerous, for it will be a desperate all-out effort to break through and cripnle the Soviet army before major operations begin in the west. This*offensive must have been planned several months ago when the Tunisian shield in the south seemed reliable and when it seemed a reasonable assumption that the German garrison in western Europe, some 50 divisions with limited aid from a strategic reserve, could contain any Allied bridgehead until the Russian front had been 'neutralised'. C onclusion : The speed and magnitude of the Tunisian debacle has fundamentally ^altered the situation. Whether the Allies decide to break into the outer ; defences of the German fortress or strike at his inner ramparts, the enemy’s strength on the ground and in the air is going to be stretched to the limit this summer to meet diverse and multiplying dangers. The more the Allied forces succeed, the more desperate will German resistance be. There is a hard road before us, but we have an initiative and flexibility v/hich seemed scarcely possible a few weeks ago. To: E. B.

Reception is clear* Everyone listens in to London, especially to the Arabic news bulletins. The two announcers, Kamal Sarur and Isa Sabagh,well maintain their old popularity. 2. Several members remarked on the change which has come over the listening public in regard to Axis stations since the turn in the tide of our military fortunes in North Africa. There has been a very marked decline in the popularity of Arabic broadcasts from Axis countries. The fundamental reason is to be found in Axis reverses. The Arab is not interested in what the losing side has to shout about. Berlin further suffers, it was said, from the lack of impressive announcers of the calibre of Kamal Sarur, ‘Isa Sabagh and Muhammad iahmud Juma. 3. Satisfaction was expressed over the! courtesy of the B.B.C. in putting over the air this past week the play 'Yom al Qadisiya' for the second time at Bahrain*s request. The B.B.C. leature 'Madha Qelu' was spoken well off. It is too early to assess the appeal value of the material. The point that weighs most at the outset of any series is the popularity of the presentation. The reputable announcer (the quality of the material apart) attracts listeners. 4. One member regretted the discontinuance of the recorded talks by distinguished Egyptians, notably Taha Husain, Ahmed Amin, Dr.Suhair al Qalamawi which he preferred to the current series of literary talks. REACTIONS TO QBR LOCAL PERSIAN GULF STATION 1. The present humorous fortnightly JUHA (GohaV) feature was considered popular and should not be discontinued. 2. The recent innovation of the fortnightly children*s talk given by a lady announcer was also approved of and its continuance considered desirable, if possible, while the present announcer is away on summer leave. 3. The plays given by local clubs and schools (some half dozen during the past four months) were held to be deserving of encouragement. 4. It was suggested that the local Bahrain station broadcast be retarded by half an hour as at this time of the year the hour of transmission conflicts with the evening meal hour. As^ however this would overlap London Arabic transmission it is not tnought practicable.(g) w Weekly report on the public opinion about the war. Russia - Inspite o£ the Arabic broadcasts from different Arabic Stations that the German have been concentrating large numbers of troops on the Russian front for their simmer attack on a large scale, the people are still of the opinion that the Germans will not dare to carry out such invasion, because they are fearing an attack by the Allies eitner through Turkey or Western Eurcbpe, for which the latter are preparing, but they want to be (bn the defensive on this sector.

IlhiLY - The public are of the opinion that the fighting \ in Italy will be- long and fierce and both sides will suffer heavy sacrifices in men and material, but the air force will play its part in it. They say that it is difficult for the Allies to drive back the Germans in Italy, because jr they will throw huge forces in this battle and try to send away the Allied forces from Italy. Some of them say that when the Germans have been driven to the north of . Italy, the Allies will consolidate their defences and then make another landing on Greece, where the inhabitahts are against the Germans. MUSSOLINI - The removal of Mussolini from his guarded prison aroused the interest of the people here, who commented on the bravery of the Germans rio risitf4t}u ir own lives for Mussolini’s sake. They say that if he‘has been totally yM removed by the Allies to a distant place, the latter would have greatly benefitted in their propaganda. ITLiMCE - Laval spoke last week to the French asking every one who knows artillery to help the Germans, but the Erenco replied him that they will help the Germans in France only. The public here are strongly of the opinion that if the ^ Allies land on France, the French people will turn their backs against the Germans, who are maintaining peace in the Occupied Europe by threat. RUGGIA - They say that the Germans are themselves quittjgp^. the Russian land, because of their need for them in Italy is more urgent. The last defence line of the Germans will % ^ be Dnieper River, where they have strong defences. FAR EAST - The people here are keenly looking forward to th« coming large drive of the Allies against the Japanese in Burma. They say that the one who takes the initiative will- w win the battle. NEAR EAST - They say that there is no danger on the Near East, so the troops in Iran and Iraq will be shifted toother active battle zones.

As an example for such an opinion, they say that when the Germans decided to occupy the Dodecanese Island, they attacked the Allies in that island and captured it from their hands. The people believe that the troops sent to defend the island toere British and not as broadcasted /_they were Italians. LEBANON - The people also believe that the crisis will not be calmed down until the British take it 'in their hands and remove the French from that country.

The people have been giving much interest to the new front which the Allies are going to open on Europe, but they say the quicker it is opened the better for them. The new front will alleviate the burden on the Russians and the Allies in Italy. So far excellent successes have been made by the Russians in their front and the Allies in Italy. If the Americans and the British carry out their intended invasion quickly, the Germans have to draw forces from their fields in Russia and Italy, then the Germans will be weaker and the Allies will make further successes in Italy. Ho interest has been given to the Far east, as the Japanese are considered not to be so important as the Germans.fcfe If PUBLIC OPINION 3^ A Italy . The Allied advance in Italy during the week has been very satisfactory. Russia There has been a rumour in the town that the continued advance of the Russians into Poland is not welcome to the British and that they are going to have a separate peace with Germany. The rumour started from a broadcast from Ankara which was later denied by the same station. Russia is silent about the rumour and that is considered as suspicious.

During the v/eek there was a strong runour that peace is being negotiated between the Allies and the Germans, but later it was found that this rumour had been framed by the Bahrain people only, and it was based on a broadcast made a long time ago by Ankara radio. Some of them did not believe that such peace will take place between the Allies and their enemies at a time when the former:; are making big advances on all fronts.

To Political Agent, Bahrain. No.3164 Dated the 7th received the 8th February, 1944. IMPORTANT . Following is Annex D of telegram No.3 Empax to you from Cairo sent to us for transmission regarding the Anglo French financial agreement to be signed on the 8th February and probably for same day. Remainder of telegram contains texts for publicat ion, which for security reasons cannot be repeated in cyphers held by you. Begins: Annex D. Points for guidance in handling publicity relating to agreement. (a) Points to emphasise are: (1) Syrian pound is not being (group undecypherable ?devalued) (2) Value of Syrian pound in terms of sterling is unchangeable. ( 3 ) There is no change in value of arrangement allowing freedom of purchase of sterling. (4) In addition to above provision in financial agreement and French (group undecypherable) guarantee requirement of currency against loss in the event of future devaluation of the franc. (b) It is important that fact that arrangements regarding Levant States were freely negotiated with the States Government themselves should be stressed. (c) It is also important that in all publicity to Arab ? States as much emphasis should be laid on those aspects of the agreement which effects States as upon Anglo French financial agreement itself. (d) The more ? easily special arrangements made regarding states can be dissociated in publicity from financial agreement itself ? the better. It is essential that impression should not be given that States are being dragged along at the Anglo French chariot wheels. As in fact great public value can be obtained from actual facts if properly presented it would be most unfortunate if fact that special interests of the States (? mute) fully be taken in account were insufficiently stressed. (e) Obviously ( group undecypherable) the good example of Anglo French co-operation with States should be exploited to the full. (f) It would be ? lustifl^able to emphasise that States of course realise that great care has been taken to safe guard their interests. (g) As little mention as possible should be made of• ■■-r - 2 - fact of presant arrangements as far as States are concerned arose out of fact they were in sterling area owing to Churchill/Degaulle financial agreement. They were never informed of this at the time and only knew of our pledge that they would be in sterling area. (h) As little emphasis as possible should be laid on link between record of pound and franc bloc. (i) Levant States will foe at least as free under new arrangements as they were previously. Certain financial controls are necessary in. all countries in war time but there is nothing ? mute arrangements ( two groups corrupt) post war financial freedom of States nor do they put any obstacle in the way of closer union between States and neighbouring Arab countries. It is because they understand that this is to be the case that States have freely accepted arrangements. Ends.
