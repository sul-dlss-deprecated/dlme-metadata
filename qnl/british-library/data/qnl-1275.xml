I considered the question and I think that the Agency here can do the work for Qatar and ohat there is no need to take up the question of appointing an Assistant Political Agent there. This would not help with the Trucial Coast, where, as you are aware, a relief is needed. \ Yours sincerely, His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.I 0 POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, Dated 24th June, 1948. S' i Dear Sir Rupert, Since I wrote my D.0.No.C/R-70, dated the 15th June, 1948, it has occurred to me that what we want in Qatar is a 'Rest House' on the same lines as that at Gwadur, where the Political Agent could stay when he visits the place. At present,as you are aware, he has either to put up with the Oil Company or with Sala A1 Mana* and I am sure you will agree that neither of t.iese is satisfactory. The Rest House should be at Dohah and furnished with camp crockery and furniture. It should also have a car with it suitable for desert travel. Under these conditions and with the launch of his own I see no reason why the Political Agent should not visit Qatar once a month when he really will be able to keep in touch with things there and also to supplement the gaps in our knowledge about the place which are considerable at present. 2. If you ag'ree with this idea, I think the first step is to try to get a house out of the Qatar people. There are plenty of them, but they may create difficulties about the scheme for other reasons. However if these are overcome I would prepare an estimate of the cost involved which would include the rent of the house, cost of the car a watchman, furniture, etc. It would, at any rate, be less expensive than an Assistant Political Agent. Yours sincerely,mm CONFIDENTIAL No.B/197 (9/55) Zl • ■(f' ‘ - f !(» PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY BAHRAIN the 26th June 1948 U I '' ^ li — At first sight I am inclined to agree with your /£ ? • Please refer to your demi-official letter No.C/R.87 of the 24th June in which you propose that a Rest House should be established at Dohah. , 2 . proposal as a temporary expedient and should be grateful if you would take up the matter with the Shaikh and let me know the result. I do not think that the proposal will involve the bring- ^ 7- £ ^ r / ' ing into force of article 8 of the Treaty of 1916 which as you know is held in abeyance under Sir Percy Cox's letter of the 3rd November 1916. If the Shaikh agrees to it in principle, would you kindly endeavour to obtain a suitable house and let me have an estimate of the expenditure involved so that I can obtain the necessary sanction. 3. As stated above I regard your proposal as only a temporary expedient. When the Oil Company goes into production I think we shall almost certainly require a permanent Assistant Political Agent in the peninsula, though to begin with, we might try to carry on with an officer having his headquarters in Bahrain £ and paying regular visits to Qatar.

When I was in Qatar before Christmas I asked the Shaikh if he would let ire have a house to stay in during visits and he said he would have to think about it. I again brought uo the sutject during our recent visit. The old man was very frank and said that he welcomed the move as evidence of 'Government's' coming near to him but, he added,.that if the Political Agent was going to stay 4 or 6 days or a week at a time 4 in Dohah (which was my idea) every slave in the place would be at his door clamouring to leave his master; and this would he very difficult for the Shaikh's people. He suggested, but not very hopefully, that perhaps we could give a guarantee not to interfere for a definite period. I said that I was sure that His Majesty's Government could not give up the principle it held in respect of slavery nor did I think that His Majesty's Government wished to bring about, of a sudden, grave social disturbance. At the same time present developments made it essential for us to devote more attention to Qatar and it would be to the Shaikh’s advantage to have his needs and conditions in his State better known to His Majesty's Government etc. Shaikh Abdullah His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN.© 2 Abdullah ended the discussion, when I said I would consult you, by remarking that it was a question not to be settled immediately. important tbt we make a beginning really to get in to Qatar. I think as a next move I might assure the Shaikh that his decision in the matter of the house will not involve the abrogation of the assurance given in the penultimate paragraph of Sir Percy Cox’s letter of November 3rd, 1916. I should be glad if you could agree to this. 3 I am sure you will agree that it is highly Yours sincerely1 2. I see no objection to your assuring the Shaikh of Qatar that his decision in the matter of the house will not involve the abroga tion of the assurance given in the penultimate paragraph of Sir Percy Cox's letter of the 3rd November, 1916, provided you make it clear that this assurance relates to 'slaves from of old time' and their descendants and that we shall continue to take every action in our power to secure the release of newly captured slaves. Under Article 1 of the 1916 Treaty the Shaikh is bound to cooperate with His Majesty’s Government in the suppression of the slave trade and Sir Percy Cox's assurance is not to be taken as abrogating that undertaking.

Dear Sir Rupert, I again took up with Shaikh Abdullah on the 15th March the matter of a house for an Agent of His Majesty's Government to stay in while working in Qatar. This was last mentioned in your semi-official letter No.(132/14/49), dated the 19th February, 1949.^^ b b • 2. I asked the Shaikh whether, if we give him a re assurance as to the substance of the penultimate para graph of Sir Percy Cox's letter, he would be satisfied (it now strikes me that this may have been somewhat more than you intended in your instructions). He said, realistically enough, that the slaves referred to therein .vere all dead and gone, and what he wanted was an assurance of non-interference in the matter of existing slaves; he added, without prompting, that he himself was fiercely opposed to enslavement (which incidentally I believe to be true as regards the Shaikh personally). 3., Do you think it would be possible to give the Shaikh a written re-assurance of the substance of Sir Percy Cox's last paragraph ; framed in such a way as to guarantee non-interference with existing slaves? If so I would draft such a letter adding something to the ef fect that 'it is understood that in return for this re assurance Your Excellency has no objection to the setting up and if necessary will provide on rent a house for an Agent of His Majesty's Government in Qatar'. The letter would His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE, CSI, Political Resident, Persian Gulf. BAHRAIN.0 1 - 2 - would probably need fairly careful drafting: I would try to get one ready for your approval if you agree. 4. May I at this juncture point out that it is use less to proceed with the politics of this matter unless the mechanics of it are put on a proper footing 7 . At a rough estimate even to hire a house in Qatar will cost / not less than £200/- a year, to make it habitable will probably require about £1000/-, a suitable car will cost another £1000/- — an officer there without a car will lose atleast half his value and about as much of his prestige. I share your dislike of the latter term, but I need hardly point out to you that in a primitive place like Qatar -- perhaps one of the most primitive places left in the modern world -- this quality is very im portant. I hope you will agree with me that the first act of an officer residing there should be to hoist the Union Flag -- and to hoist it on a high mast — with which he will have to be provided presumably by the Ministry of A’orks. After all it still stands for in Qatar what it stood for in the Gulf 100 years ago. 5. Even if the house, etc. were provided,the question of who is going to live in it does not seem to be easy, particularly when, as you informed me, even the question of a permanent Assistant Political Agent for this Agency is causing difficulty. If we have the house etc., I would like to occupy it myself for about a week in the first place and shortly afterwards to send someone there for a fortnight or so; but as we are placed for staff at present this is impossible.

You will see from my semi-official letter to Burrows 18/12/49 of the 24th March, a copy of which has been forwarded to you that I have proposed that Shaikh Abdullah should be asked to agree to the bringing into force of Articles 7, 8 and 9 of the 1916 Treaty in return for our recognition of Ali as heir-apparent. If this proposal is accepted, there will I think be no point in continuing separate negotiations for the opening of a rest-house and I would suggest that no further action should be taken until we receive a reply from the Foreign Office. 3. Meanwhile, I should be grateful if as you suggest, you would draft a letter about slaves as the Shaikh, even if he agrees to the bringing into force of the three Articles will obviously continue to demand an assurance on this point. Under Article 1 of the Treaty the Ruler has only agreed to co-operate in the suppression of the slave trade and has given no undertaking to put a stop to slavery as such. I am of the opinion that there should be no difficulty in giving the Shaikh a promise that we will not exercise the right of manumission of established slaves, but we must insist that he will co-operate fully in obtaining the release of persons who have been recently abducted or may be abducted in the future. I would suggest that you study the existing instruc tions on the subject of manumission. It is not a right that we enforce automatically in the Gulf States and 1 do not think His Majesty's Government will insist on it in the case of Qatar provided the Shaikh fulfills his obligation to co-operate in the suppression of the traffic in slaves. 4. I agree with what you say in paragraph 4 of your letter about the mechanics of the case and I propose to take this matter up when I have received a reply to my letter to Burrows. C.J.

After Compliments, In discussing the proposal for the admission of an agent on behalf of Government to Your Excellency^ country you mentioned that you feared that the presence of such an agent would encourage slaves in Qatar to seek manumission and that this would cause a disturbance amongst your people. I can assure that such an agent will not grant manumission to slaves existing at this time except in cases where definite cruelty of the master towards a slave seeking manumission has been proved 5 and then only after consultation with Your Excellency or Your Excellency’s successor. It is, of course, under stood that Your Excellency and your successors will fully co-operate with the Government in obtaining the release of persons who have been recently abducted or may be abducted in the future.

The Foreign Office have also asked whether it is possible to obtain an assurance from the Shaikh that he will take effective steps to prevent slave trading in or through his territory. We have already this question in mind and if you can obtain any assurance in writing from him on the subject as a result of the negotiations so much the better. 4. If you see no objection, would you now kindly initiate negotiations with the Shaikh as soon as you conveniently can on the lines proposed?

I am not entirely clear as to the intention of the orders in paragraph 4 of your semi-official letter No.18/14/49, dated the 14th April 1949. In paragraph 3 of the enclosure to your C.S. No.18/12/49, dated the 24th March 1949, you say that we might recognise Shaikh Ali as the successor to Shaikh Abdullah and seize the occasion to endeavour to persuade the Shaikh to give his written consent to bringing into force Articles 7, 8 and 9 of the 1916 treaty, but t^ this is not a _g_lne qua non for the recognition of Ali. This is clear enough but as you state yourself in para graph 3 of your semi-official letter No.213/2/49, dated *, * t'. the 26th March 1949, even if the Shaikh agrees to the bringing into force of the three articles he will demand an assurance of non-interference at least with existing slaves. You do not, however, advert to this in paragraph 3 of your letter No.18/14/49, dated the 14th April which by contrast, suggests that I obtain an assurance in writing from the Shaikh that he will take steps to prevent slave trading in or through his territory. I mentioned to Burrows yesterday that the Shaikh will require a letter from us on the lines of the draft enclosed with my semi official letter No.C/R-147,\.dated the 14th April 1949 before he agrees to the bringing into force of the three articles, and I am afraid there will be little use in my attempting negotiations unless I am authorised to give him such a letter.

I have discussed Hie'question with Burrows and he is not very much in favour of the draft forwarded with your letter No.C/R-147 of the 14th April, and suggests that if we are compelled to adopt it something 6n the lines of 'until further agreement is reached with Your Excellency on the subject' should be inserted between 'I can assure you that' and 'such an Agent' at the beginning of the second sentence. 3. I enclose two alternative drafts prepared on lines I have discussed with Burrows. I think the draft referring to Sir Percy Cox's letter is probably the better one. 4. I must leave it to you to negotiate the best terms possi ble. If you reach an agreement with the Shaikh, the draft of it will have to be forwarded to the Foreign Office for scrutiny before it is finally signed. Our main object is to bring into force the Articles of the 1916 Treaty which are in abeyance and I think it will be accepted that, if necessary in order to achieve this, we may give an undertaking not to interfere with existing slaves. It is necessary however that this undertaking should be so worded as to give the least handle for criticism should its contents become known. .J. Pelly, Esq., O.B.E., Political Agent, Bahrain.H.E.

It is now not possible for him to go there before his departure on leave, and I do not consider it proper for me to initiate the negotiations myself.

If negotiations are successful it is intended to appoint a Political Officer to Qatar, and Burrows has already taken up the question of obtaining sanction for this and has suggested that we should put in our proposals about accommodation at the earliest possible moment. Would you kindly let me have your views on this subject as soon as you are in a position to do so. I think myself we shall probably require a combined house and office something after the style of the Bahrain Agency only smaller, plus accommodation for two or three clerks and also for servants and guards.

With the imminent expansion of oil production and, as it appears to me, the unfitness of the Ruler to handle the changing situation the need for us tc have someone permanently on the spot grows daily more imperative. 3. So far as housing is concerned I entirely agree that a first essential is that the Political Officer should be away from the oil company’s camps and best, perhaps, at Doha. I also agree that the post calls for a combined office and residence and additional ac commodation for two or three clerks, servants and guards. 4. I suggest that the house should be air-conditioned throughout and have four bedrooms each with separate bath.

Letter No.C/S-110 of August 11, 1949/ from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to H.E. the Ruler of Qatar. Subject . Distrubed internal situation in Qatar.Mr. Wilton. 1• 3 Articles of the 1916 Treaty with Qatar were not brought Into force when the Treaty was originally signed. These were: Article 7 giving British subjects the right to trade in Qatar, Article 8 giving H.M.G. permission for the appoint ment of a Political Officer there, and Article 9 referring to the establishment of a British Posts and Telegraphs service. These three articles were brought into force on the 21st. 2. . The former Shaikh tried to maintain that he v/as net responsible for the maintenance of order in matters concerning the oil company and he quoted a letter sent him by Sir Trenchrrd Fowle in support of this. We did net admit this contention and quoted to him another letter by fir Trenchard Fowle. You should get copies of these letters. 3. There are three aerodromes in ^atar, all made and maintained hy the oil company. We have to arrange an air agreement with the Shaikh. 4. There seem tc be two rival factions in Qatar, one headed by Saleh al Mani*, the secretary to the former Shaikh and the Darwish who are contractors for the oil company. Both the parties seem to be very rich. You should ob-» viously avoid associating yourself closely with either of them and report fully on their activities. 6. Sea-bed oil. The P.D.(Q) Ltd. consider thnt their concession covers the sea-bed area, but an Anglo- American oil company jepresented by Sir Hugh Weightman, a retired Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, A — jLerpptJy took-tke concession over the sea-bed. The / mattermatter will now go to arbitration. While the final negotiations were in progress with Sir Hugh Weightman the Drawish family brought in a Syrian or a Lebanese called Fauzi el Hiss who attempted to secure the sea- bed concession for other American interests, presumably for some of those interested in Kuwait. Fauzi el Hiss is now apparently running an air service making arrange ments for air services to Doha. 6. The A1 Tbani family is numerous. There seems to he no reason why some of them should net also work for their living. One of the family Sau'd who claims to be the 'Shaikh” of Wakrah, a claim which is not ad mitted, gave some trouble recently over the erection of a navigational beacon at Jehel Wakrah. He now appears to be quiet. But other members of the family have arrived in Bahrein vMth the ostensible object of calling on the p .A, presumably to press their claim. They will not be encouraged. The Eastern Bank pro poses to open a branch in Jatar aM should be given all reasonable assistance, similarly to Gray Mackenzie if they apply, 7. One of the most troublesome points is the question of slaves. As in Bahrain this t uestion is likely to solve itself in course of tim?, i.e., the oil company will absorb all surplus labour and the existing slaves will die out. The AX Then! .family want to withhold the right of manumission b»i Slaves- While are to give this- they ^den* t want to forego their ri rht of manumission. ¥au_ w4rl-l-doubtless dismiss the ty sj.ave»&gt; The line adopted by the Political Agent was that this was not s pressing mrtter and you would do well so far ?s is possible to avoid taking action. The foregoing / refers-3- refers to slaves already in existence. On the other hand you will act with the greatest vigour and determina tion to stop any fresh abductions into slavery and take the firmest line in this r aspect reporting fullest details, (8) Workmen's Compensation, The Indian Workmen's Compensation Act is generally accepted through out the Gulf as a basis on which compensation is awarded for local employees who are injured while on duty. The company does not exactly follow the act so as to # avoid it being quoted against them. But in general they are guided by its provisions. It is very desirable that in Qatar some policy should be followed in regard to compensation for injuries. Recently two cases one of came to light in/which the former Shaikh fixed a large sum of money as compensation for the death of a workman. In another case he himself pocketed the greater part of the award made by P.D (Q)Ltd. Obviously this sort of thing should stop and payment of compensation on the lines of Indian Workmen's Compensation Act should be paid to and retained by the proper person. (9) It is very desirable that Shaikh Abdullah should not stay in Qatar for one thing ±x his son is too sub servient to him and may defer unduly to his opinion and for another thing he may become a centre of opposition to Shaikh Ali. It is therefore in the common interest that Shaikh Abdullah should leave the country. He appears to have date gardens in Qatif which he might visit but it is perhaps not particularly desirable that he should establish himself in Saudi territory. He has goittgP to the Lebanon and it is a long way off. The latest suggestion is that he should do a pilgrimage. / He.He has already once been to Mecca but that is no reason why he should not go again. As the appropriate season has now started he should be induced to perform the pilgrimage by stages, i.e., he should go overland and not by air. That means he should absent himself from Qatar at the present moment and allow Ali to establish himself securely, 10. The first essential is the assuring of local security. Shaikh Abdullah seems to have a number of guards and it is desirable that it should be reduced to a negligible number. If he leaves the country tills can be done early. What must be done Is to es tablish a trained disciplinary police force under the orders of Shaikh Ali. This is a matter which is more proper for the adviser to arrange. But as he is not likely to arrive for another two months the P.K. considers that you should take steps for this for your personal security and for the withdrawal of the Naval landing party. Shaikh Ali has asked us * to provide him with ammunition and we are going ke Into the question. Under the Treaty the Shaikh is entitled to 500 rifles and you may well go into this matter at a very early date and get the rifles which are obviously with Shaikh Abdullah’s men. If they do not total 500 we might well supply the balance immediately. This ques tion you should go into immediately after your arrival. It is understood that Jalawi, the Amir of Hassa, has recently given the Darwish family a motor car. Tankers are expected to start loading oil at the end of the year.fto. 1 (2/1/49). 2ord. t August 1949.

About accommodation charges however, he said that it had not been the Company’s practice in the past to charge for accommodation, that he did not know what to charge, etc. and suggested that you should approach Lermitte with a view to having a nominal rate fixed. 4. He agreed to advance me money as I reauired it, but asked that you should write him a letter which would serve as an authority for the Accountant. I spoke to the Accountant, who said that he would like the letter to say either that you wished facilities to be granted to me to draw on Imprest up to a certain sum each month, the amount to be recovered sub sequently through you. or tnat an account had been opened with such and such a Bank in the name of the Political Officer Qatar, and would he cash cheques on it up to a certain amount each month. He wants an estimate so that he can make his own cash requisition for an adequate amount. I said that I had no idea what I would eventually need, but would give him as much warning as possible. I suggest that you make the authority cover a prudently large sum, so that you do not have to tell him continually to raise the ceiling, and T will notify him of my actual requirements as T discover what they will be. So far T am committed to 75 rupees a month for a farresh, and 300 rupees a month for a car and driver. Tn the foreseeable future are the interpreter’s wages, if one is found, and the w r ages of an Agency farrash if you decide to send one , and if they differ significantly from the above figure. I am writing about the farrash separalely. 5. I asked Langham if the Corapnay could hire me a car and driver, but they are so short of transport that this is not possible. I therefore propose, if you see no objection, to hire e car £&amp; and driver from Salih al i^iani’ for the sum of 10 rupees a day. This sum may appear low at first sight, but there are days when I make little or no use of the car, and/ H.G. Jakins Esq., H.M. Political Agent, Bahrain. X'.’. s.sr?.»«and on average it ought to balance out. The business of t trying to calculate costs on a basis of mileage would, I think, have been less satisfactory owing to the difficulty ot calculating dead mileage on a car which is housed elsewhere and only used part time. m. ,, 6 * I discussed w r ith Langham the position here when iirbutt goes on leave, which he is due to do in the third week of next month, he said that he thought that it would be possible to dispense with a full-time Company reoresen- tatiye in Jpha in future, and I gathered than he contemplated leaving me m full possession here provided that the Company continued to enjoy certain facilities such as the maintenance 91 their w r ireless postfwhich we should wish to see maintained in any case) and a smell staff for certain of their admin istrative requirements connected with the movement cf stores and personnel. I am pursuing the question with Langham to jino °ut exactly vrhat the Company’s reouirements would be. if the company are happy with such an arrangement, it is by far the best from our point of view, as the only other avails able accommodation fit to live in belongs either to Selih al Mani* or the Darwish family, in neither of whose camps we wish to appear to dwell. .

Political Agency, Bahrain, October 15, 1949. Dear Residency, We have hitherto referred to Wilton as Political Officer, Qatar, but according to the definitions in Part I, paragraph 4 of the Qatar Order in Council, 1949, he should be referred to as Political Agent. 2. Unless you see any objection we propose to make the correction immediately. Yours ever, Agency. The Political Residency, Jufair.A A. 213/39/49 The Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain. 27th October, 1949. Please refer to your Agency letter No. C/B-479 of the 15 th October about the status of the Political Officer at Qatar. Tne Political Agent, Bahrain, remains the Political Agent as far as Qatar is concerned in the same way as he does for the Trucial Coast, and Wilton should continue to be referred to as Political Officer. The definition of Political Agent in the Qatar Order-in-Council is identical with that (mutatis mutandis) in the Trucial States Order- u in-Council. Hitherto it has been held that the Political Officer, Trucial States, or in his absence . ^ '0 the Residency Agent, is the representative of the \ Political Agent, Bahrain, and as such entitled to x' exercise the judicial powers of the Political ^geht. Beckett has objected to this vide my letter 85/^6/49 of the 8th July and if you wish Wilton to be granted judicial powers you should apply through me for his appointment as a judge of the Political Agent*s Court. 3. I understand from Gethin that you wish the question oi a salute ior Wilton to be considered The Political Officer, Trucial Coast has never been granted a salute, and as the Qatar and Trucial Coast posts so far as I am aware are graded as a 8 posts for which no salute is provided in the Foreign Office Regulations, I do not propose to take the matter up.

We are concerned only with the manumission instruct- 3- ions for the manumission of slaves of loner domicile as it would affect the established slave population of Qatar - the Shaikh is bound by Article I of the 1916 Treaty (vide page 180 of 10/3-II) to suppress the trade in newly captured slaves. necessary to ascertain whether an €ip^licant is (a) a debtor, (b) a criminal, (c) a person whose release is likely to cause political repercussions, or (d) belongs to the area of another Agency; but to be a debtor or a criminal does not render a slave] ineligible for a manumission certificate (to claim manumission as a slave is sometimes the trick of a free person who hopes in i this way to escape from his debts or punishment for his crimes),) and the general instructions regarding manumission - vide page 12 seq of A. 30/4 - are now so human£&amp;faVntniWtfr interpreted - vide noting at pages 21 - 24 ibid - that, in practice, if a slave has the energy to run away and present himself at Bahrain claim-j ing cruel treatment by his master or his impending sale to a new and worse master he has little difficulty in securing a manumission certificate. That more slaves do not seek manumiss ion is because they are often better off economically than free men and the fact that the manumission facilities we offer to the disgruntled make for the general amelioration of the slaves’! lot, vide page 88 of 20/1-1. however, has come about slowly and in regard to Qatar P.A. ^ay be interested to see the older manumission instructions at page 1 seq of A.30/4, with their different procedures for Kuwait, Bahrain, Muscat, and the T.C. Presumably the procedure for Qatar is to follow^the procedures for Kuwait, the T.C., and Bahrain, in that order, the ’'Kuwait” procedure to obtain during \ the % period for which the Shaikh of Qatar would like a guarantee of non-intervention, cf. s. 5 of 3/21. It is true that manumission certificates are not Lj- granted automatically to all applicants because some enquiry is The liberalization of our manumissiom policy. 5~ • 4. 4. 49.
