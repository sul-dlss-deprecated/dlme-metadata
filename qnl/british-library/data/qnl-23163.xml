Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohamed al-Kha- lifah desires to take with him a shot gun to India, and asks whether you can give him a letter authorising him to take it R.Z.D*0*No The 22nd Novonber 1937# Sear Belgrave, ^ill you please refer to your memorandum No* 1361/1 dated the 16th November 1937. 2* I spoke to Shaikh Xhalifah bin Mohammad al Khalifah myself about the matter of his shot gun and ^ suggested that his best plan would be first to obtain the approval of the School Commandant to his having a gun at 2'tasik and then to apply locally for an import licence in order to get it into India. If he does this there will be no difficulty made at the Bombay Customs, but if I merely give him a letter at this end, the Bom bay Customs people may very likely refuse to accept it as equivalent to an import licence. It is of course true that Shaikh Mohammad once succeeded in taking a 12-bore shot gun into India on a casual letter from the Political Agent, Bahrain, but that was ten years ago and things have tightened up a good deal since then.
