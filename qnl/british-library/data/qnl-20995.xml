He has some justification for his argument that a chain of fortresses in this locality is not con veniently sited for the purpose of Intercepting mihaxa raiding parties crossing from Syria to Hajd, and for his suspicion that the ’Iraq Government had some other motive for the creation of these posts. 5# In the first place it seems advisable to explain to King Ibn Ba'ud that the list of posts south west of Masiriyah and Liwaniyah contained in iJr.B ourailion 1 s letter to him of 17th August 1927, were, with the single exception of ^usaiy&amp;h, old posts which had been established some time before. It is therefore not the fact that the •Iraq Government seized the opportunity of erecting a chain of posts in the assert. I enclose a statement show ing tile locality and strength of the police posts which existed in this region at the time of the att&amp;cx on Busaiyah, acid the aates on which they were established. The statement induces tne Abu Ghar post which has since been2 © ‘c • flyuM i been abajadoned and also the Salman post which was/establish* ed in October 1927* The latter post was in an exposeu p position and h&amp;a no defences of any kind) it was therefore abandoned after having been occupied for a few days# (It i$» as you are aware f now being reestablished and fortified It was intended that a copy of this statement together with a map should be communicated to King I bn Sa'ud in re» ply to Ms letter dated the 21 st of September 1927 f but the attack on Busaiy&amp;h intervened ana the correspondence was broken off# j , , ' „ » ‘ .1 •./ , 7 ... t ' X H • 4# Secondly it may aomitted that 9 although these desert posts as intelligence centres would undoubtedly facilitate the interception of any raiding parties from Syria wMch might take the rout^ to the east of the impassable bahana desert (which lies close to the neutral ^one) f this was not the only consideration which prompted the ’Ira^ Government to establish them# As you are avvare f the ’Iraq shepherd tribes, who graze their flocks in the desert south west of Kasiriyah, have in the past years been terrorised by Faisal al bawish into paying blackmail to his agents in return for immunity from his raids. The establishment of small desert police posts gave the tribe© as,an confidence in the ability of the ’Iraq Government to protect them from Faisal al bawish# It was therefore with the perfectly legitimate object of protecting their own * . - ! J » . tribes from Faisal al bawish as well as preventing raids into b&amp;jd territory that the ’Iraq Government established ‘ * t ... ■ . • ' ' these posts, ana it is for that very reason that their establishment was so strongly resenieu by Faisal al bawish and his following# 5# I suggest that, in the course of the conversation to be held with King Ibn Ua’ud, the facts to wMch I have referred in the preceding paragraph© should be laid frank ly before him# IT5 6# I am Bonding copios of 1 Mb aenpatoh and ito on- oloBures to the Political Ke&amp;ident* Busiuret the Political Agent, inwait, the High Commissioner, Jerusalem, and the British Agent and Consul, Jidd&amp;h* ! -R« pli&gt;s to arguments usea Argument , i # Ihe f Iraq Govermaeiit have constructed 'military posts on the frontier and in localities close to the frontiert' 1 in particular at husaiyah 'which is very close to the hajd front!er f 11 where they have con structed 'fortifications t strongholds and barracks** This constitutes a breach of Article 3 of the First Uqair Protocol wheeeby 'The two Governments mutually agx*ee not to use the watering places and wells situated ixi the vicinity of the border ( *ala atraf al hudud) for any military purpose such as building forts oxx them and not to concentrate troops In their vicinity#* Furthermore the *lra^ Government spread rumours that they intended to lay a railway line to * Busaiyah and to undertake other military activities i on the frontier 9 *ud i fi ..^Jg^l ters # Keply # 1# Busaiyah is 50 miles from the nearest point of X the neutral sone and 75 miles from tiu* Ivajd frontier# Ho other post haa been established by 'Iraq within m 100 juilvu of the B&amp;jd frontier, 'either juusaiyah nor 4- any other ’Iraq post cun therefore possibly be Gbsiuccx described as near the frontier and consequently Article 3 of the First Uqair protocol cannot apply to them# A garrison of 10 camel police was placed at Busaiyah in December 1926 and a small post (to hold 15) was in course of erection for their accommodation when the attack on Busaiyah took place# The 'Iraq Government have never suggested laying a railway line to Busaiyah ana the rumours of their intended activities were not spread by them and are absolutely baseless#-w ■ Oil 1(1! WH.I Argument * 2 * The arguiu«nt ttout iiuaai^ah is so max^y miles from the frontier is irrelevant. Tile Uqair Protocol says nothing about distance in miles. Either the #r otocai stands and husaiyeh must go or, if the Busaiy&amp;h post remains, the Protocol must be cancelled. 2. On the distance of ^usaiyah from the frouticr depends the answetj^ to the question whether it cioi properly be described as near the frontier ( f ai&amp; atraf al Hudud; K.B. I bn Saud is under no mi ^ appr eh an si on as to the meaning of the phrase for lie also uses •q&amp;rib&amp;t m:a al Hudud ,f as a ^ynoiiym}. It seems that iba Sa f ud is disconoerted at the discovery that Busoiyah is so far from the frontier and is therefore impelled to describe the fact, .vhich upsets his whole argument, as irrelevant. It may be noted that Ibn Sa f ud f s foreign Minister considered the question of distance to be of some importance as ho claimed that Bus&amp;iyah was 55 miles from Hajd frontier, not 75. He has since been shown the latest maps and has admitted his error i ^ It is conceivable that Ibn Sa^d might argue that the nearest well to the frontier or any recogaiaod route must be considered 'ala atraf al Hudud.' But eveqthis arguiaent falls to the ground in the case of Bus* iyah* as there are permanent wells at Tuqalyid, Jahaiaah# and Jubraim, all of which lie between Busuiyah and the frontier•Argument » 5* The building of these frontier poets can only have been intended to cause dissension among the hajd tribes and was prompted by the hostility of the f Iraq Government to hajd* The reason given fcy the High Cozaniiseioner that the posts were designed to prevent raiding parties from Syria traversing 'Iraq territory to Kajd cannot be sustained as they are far from the road that the raiders would use* X * 5 * Kajd So far from intending to embarrass the Government f the f Iraq Government in establishing the Busaiyah and other desert posts were attempting to take all possible measures to stop raiding into Sajd f as Ibn Sa f ud had himself asked them to do* The extension of Government control and the consequent prevention of raiding in the desert south of liasiriyah can only have caused resentment among those who were opposed to the establishment of peace and order in the desert and to the curtailment of their own lawless activities* the establishment of a post of 10 police in the desert 7b miles from the hajd frontier cannot possibly be inter** preted as an offensive action against the Bajd Government Xhe Busciyah post was inted intended to be primarily an intelligence centre* Raiding parties from byria seeking to enter Bajd throughjthe desert west and south of the Euphrates must pass east of the Bahana* and news of their approach would be transmitted by the Busaiyah post to headquarters» whereupon action would be taken to intercep- '‘^y ♦ .isaB. 4 • I bn Sa’ud complains of the delay that occurred in answering Ms letters* He sent many protests and warnings and received no reply* This silence Made him doubt the sincerity of the ♦Irati Government and greatly aggravated the crisis* He makes the following complaints in detail*- i # In 1926 on receipt of a warning from the High Commissioner that bhaiamar tribes then in Syria contemplated raiding into Imja f he haa written protests ing against the ’Iraq Government for allowing this and asking that steps may be ta^en to prevent such raids* He received no reply for 10 months when the iiigii Commissioner informed him of th^ establishment of posts on the frontier* ) intercept the raiders before tiiey entered tojd territory* I bn Sa’ud suggests that the posts are useless to intercept such raiding parties, but it is significant that with two doubtful exceptions no raids into llajd from ’Iraq have taken place since the posts were establis **' ed« 4* Ibn Sa f ud forgets that the transmission of letters to and from the interior of hajd is a slow business more particularly when his whereabouts and future movements are not known* Moreover his letters deal with important matters which it is often necessary not only for the departments of the ’Iraq Government but also for the departments of His Britannic majesty’s Goverdnent in London to examine and discuss before replies can be sent* To reply to ills com plaints seriatim*- i# On receipt of the High Commissioner’s warning. Ibn Sa’ud wrote to the British Consul, Jiddah, on 2£nd October 1 926, &amp;nd again on 13th November 1926, stating ixis point of view namely that ’Iraq must baar re 3poj;isit,i lity 0Argument , i responsibility for raids iron ^reu^ territoiy into Bajd* even thougii the raiaers came from Syria# and urging that steps should at once be taken to prevent such raids* The first oi these letters was# we know# acknowledged by the British Oonsu] and no doubt the second was too* ho reply seeiaea to be immediately called for by the High Commissionex* to whom the letters were not addressed* Action was however taken to carry out I bn Sard’s wishes by the strengthening of existing police posts and by the establishment of an additional small post at Busaiy&amp;h where news of the movements of the raiding parties could be obtained so that action could be taken to t intercept them. In consequence of these measures the bhamniar tribes in Syria abandoned their intention of raiding into Hajd and except for a minor raid which occur red in October 1927 no such raids eventuated so far as is known. This was in the circumstances the most effective reply possible to Ibn band’s requests* The Secretary $o' State who had throughout been kept informed of the measures taken by the ’Iraq Govern* ment approved them and suggested in July I927^1bn Saud shouldArgument « ii• Ibn Sa'ud protested a^ains^ the iiuaaiyaii Post but received no reply for tliree Laoatiis# more over tne reply* when it did arrive* was datea October doth (4th J&amp;mad al Awwal) 'but it was des patched to us on 17th November {Z2 Jamad al Awwal}•** Tius was^a coincidence which attracts our attention*' should be informed of what had been done in order that he might realise that the f Iraq Government was sixicerely a attempting to meet his wishes.

On arrival at Kiyadh he sent It is difficult to see how a reply could h^ve been sent more promptly. Unfortunately ibn Sa’ud ha.d in the mean time left the Hijaz for Riyadh. As soon as this was dis covered, the message was telegraphed to Bushire (on October 29th) for transmission that route to Riyadh in order that Ibn 8a*ud might receive it with the least possible delay. Ibn Sa , ud f s statement that the message was dated October 30th (4th Jamah al Awv/alj but was des patched to Mm on November 17th (22nd Jamah al Awwal) may be explained by the fact that the message was forward ed from Bushire to Bahrain for onward transmission and that mails to Bahrain are very infrequent. The letter was despatched from Bahrain on Hovember 17th* m any' case Ibn 8a f ud should have received the message frciu Ms own foreign Office at Mecca. ***♦ 5a f ud f s second protest (dated 21st Septambet 1927) reached Baghdad on 22nd October 1927.

This is an old controversy and Ibn S&amp; f ud had previously been fully informed of the views of the # Iraq Government on the matter* His letter was however referred to toe Uraq Government and a draft reply restating the ’Iraq case was prepared* On 30th September 1927* &amp; further letter dated 30 th August 1927 was receive a from Ibn ^a’ud on the sameArguments ♦ u‘ 5* Ibn Sa # ud protests that 'aeroplanes from *Iraq fly over the boraers of our terri tories and over our tribes, some of them landing in the miast of our lands; also motor cc^rs run through the neutral zone and the extremities of the border#' He says that these visits of aeroplanes and motor oars to the hajd frontier were ct^lioeratively provocative# same subject# The reply to tht: first letter was therefore held up in order that a reply to the second letter could be incorporated in it# This was done and the reply to both letters was finally despatched on 7th November i927.

Ibn ba’ua that, whereas he has predated all raids froxa ^ajd f “raids ota us have never been discontinued either bny »Iraq or by Trans-Joroauia. M It is fcorth rioting that when Ibn Sa'ud wrote this protest on November 5th f no koyal Air Force aeroplarxes or cars from ’Iraq had been nearer to the Is&amp;jb frontier or the neutral &amp;Qn® than Busaiyuii since the previous April* ^11 seexn© pob^iblo in the circumstance that Ibn ba’ua is referring to flights down the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf. Whether Imperial Airways have always respected the 3 mile limit we can ? t say. In any case this is nothing what®vex* to do with the 'Iraq Government. 6 0 pt is entirely untrue that raids from ’Iraq on Aajd iu^ve never been discontinued. In 1925 the 'Iraq Government moved the N*ijri refugees from the neighbourhood of the cl frontisrt whore they had in previous years made I'afus into haj d territory # to Uac nor them Jazirah. This extremely difficult operation* which was carried out solely with the object of preventing raius on Hajd f was successfully accomplished and achieved its object for since then raids have virtual ly ceased. The stringent measures ta&amp;en by the 'Iraq Government to prevent raiding however resulted in some of the Ghammar sections cross ing into Gyriu where the 'Iraq Government coula not control them. It was repor^eu that they intended from there to raid kajd and the High Coimisaiotiar waraeu Iba Sa. u a according^ order tmt be 0r ■: r T - &lt; r&gt; Albumen iiSSiL* might realise that the triheb in question had passed out of the control of the f Iraq Government# Ibn £a T ud dcmandou. that further steps should be taken lay the 'Irat; Government to prevent theae threatened raids from Biaterialising, and the f lraq Government accordingly established a small post at Busaiyah and tigiitaned up the system of small police posts al ready established as nearly as possible on the routes that such raiding parties would follow in traversing ’Iraq territory. In order that informa* tion of their movements could be ootainea ana steps taken to intercept them# These measures were entirely successful, s/ith two doubtful exceptions there have bean no raia^ on hajd irom ’Iraq or nyria since beptember jl 926# hven this raid was from Syria, ana the last /raid lay an •Iraq tribe was in Bovomoer j. 925, when b men of the bhafir carried out a very small raia across the frontier# in the circumstances Ibn aa’ud’s have statements that raids teet never boon discontinued by ’Iraq is entirely contrary to facts and reveals a singular lacic of appreciation of the energetic ana successful efforts made by the ’Iraq Government to prevent such raids# The first doubtful exception was a retaliatory raid by the and took Suqur (Ararat) on Muhammad Ibn Turk! of tho Dahamshah (Ararat) place in iabruary 1927.

The litter crossed ;ain into ♦Iraq. -Adwan ibh Eaxacial followed across the frontier and attacked him in ’Iraq territory capturing 150-200 aniaals. The exchange of | .iels with the Suqur is now being arranged. This is not an ordinary case of raiding between f Iraq and lug a tribes because the DahamsheJh are an f Iraq tribe (though Ibn ha’ud aisputes this). Moreover the first raid (by the hah&amp;mshah on the Buqur) was from Hajd into ’Iraq. Adw&amp;n ibn iisimtiial 1 ^ raid on the haheoshah on T lraq territory was also an irregularity against which T Iraq has protested* though the motive of the raid was good. This buqur-bahaashah incident is being satis factorily settled and there is no neeu for the matter to be raised with Ibn ba f uu f but it is possible? that he will cite the ,uqur raidArgument * 7# Ibn ka’ud protests against the interference of the 'Iraq Government with his tribes and cites the action raid as an 'Iraq raid against 2*ajd, when it can be pointed out that it was preceded and followed by raids from 11 aj d into 'Iraq* The second exception occurred at the end of October 1827* The Kutbah post telegraphed on November 2nd that a party of Shamm&amp;r and Fid'an passed through Ga'ar&amp;h when returning to Syria with bO camels looted from the Pajd Euwallaii at Jauf• The ctiinels had be n Beized 1^5 a 2ba' chief in 'Iraq and sent by him to his Kais who handea over the camels to uuri Sha'lan* The said Haiu was subsequently reprimanded by &amp; the 'Iraq Commandant of Police for not having brought the camels to the Muhaiwir post* The Mutasarrif* Dttlaim f subsequently raceiv d a letter from the Amif of Hail claiming the return of the camels to which ho re plies. that the raid was carried out by Syrian tribes* that he could not do any thing and that the claim should be addressed to the Syrian Govern* zaent* Ibn Sa'ud has never protested against this raid and may be ignorant of it; on the other hand he may bring it up in justification of his statement about raids from 'Iraq* 7* This raises u longstanding controversy which is still being pursued* Ibn ba'ud. claims that ^Crtiele 1 of the Second Uqair Irotoeol was expressly intended to cover ^uhammaa bin lurid arid Jassa ibn Hi j lad.q^uiBQnt * action of the kutasarriff hiwani^ahf in aaureasing *iUhanMad iba furKi ana Jazza ibn .ijlad direct* 8* ion Sa’ud complains that ’Iraq newspapers! ^especially those connecteu with the high Govern- meat officials** have attached ana insulted xmjd and to tiiis he attributes in part the resentment of SSEiSL. kijlaa and their tribe, the bahamshah* This is disputed sy ’Iraq which claims that the ^ahamshah, being a section of the iuaarat, are an ’Iraq tribe under Article 1 (a) of the Auhommer&amp;h Treaty* I bn Sa’ud forwarded a copy of a letter addressed by the x*iutasarrif, biwaniyah, to Jazsa’ ibn Aijlad, but when the letter was written Jazza’ ibn AijlacL was in ’Iraq territory and Ibn ba’ud has therefore no grounds for complaint* Qn the other hand the ’Iraq Government have had cause to complain of thy giving of presents by Ibn ba’ud to cex^tain bhafir dhaiisdis namely, ^aimi al Suwait, Hazza’ ibn ’Agab, Hamdan Xtm bawaihis, dhamis al As lab and others with the result that many of them have settled in Baja territory* The ’Iraq Government find it difficult to reconcile Ibn Sa’ud’s action with the terms of Article 4 of the Baiira Agreement* There lias been correspondence with Ibn Sa’ud on this subject* 8* The local press for the period July to becembcr 19^7 has been examined and a note is attached showing the result.

Deports regarding events in nejd are very confueed: one from ’.uwait pointing to practical abandonment of Tbn Baud’s efforts against Banish and others to preparations for encircling him and starving him out. iieanwhile Air : 'orce operations have been strikingly successful in so far as immediate object of X&gt;rotecting ’Iraq tribes from Kutuir raids is concerned, but they have not yet inflicted much damage on Mutair, who are still able to graze io South in ARTAWIYAH neighbourhood. it appears to iae appearance of aeropilanes over AR’” AWT YAH and dropping warnings to the effect that any further incuroion by Tawiah will be followed by bombing of that place might now have i menae effect upon fsejd tribes and make them think that it will be unsafe for them to raid ’Iraq in future. whether flight of aeroplanes aB far south as AHTAWIYAH would increase Ibn Laud’s indignation at violation it is of his frontier, or his difficulties with his people, ifcfcXK difficult to say. My own view is that when we have once risked his indignation by crossing frontier we should now take full- -est possible advantage of it and that since we cannot indef- -initely prolong operations we ought to see that they do not close without some striking demonstration of our i-ower. 1 shall be glad to know whether you concur with the foregoing views.

It appears to me, as I have already said in my telegrams Hos. 4 and 17, that Ibn Gaud and not local tribes is the matter and the only matter to be considered. 1 hold the opinion that tribes are a side issue and at that affecting local rather than Imperial policy. Disgruntling Ibn Gaud is likely to affect us very considerably on every face of Arabia and to effect this for the sake of punishing an Arab tribe for raiding appears to me an act of bombing our own main policy for a point of little permanent import- -anee. 'the destruction of the Rusal,yah post was a serious matter for which the ultimate responsibility had to come home to Ibn Gaud and until we found he could do nothing I think we should have kept to our sice of the frontier* us neglecting the fact that local tribes think absurd to i consider frontiers. How that Ibn Gaud has disbanded the troops he was raising for punishing the Mutair the question' assume?a a new phase and I personally consider we should, while taking every precaution for defence against raids, wait till we see what line Ibn Gaud proposes to take. I see no object in taking aggressive action until we do know. Our object is to come to a permanent settlement and I hope that Ibn Gaud will xkkx still keep his engagement for2 for a meeting. Our desire is to maintain our friendship «ith him as long as he Icceps his side of hi© agreements and it is to our advantage to do so. If no satisfactory result is achieved we can then tell Xton Baud that unless he can prevent raids and punish raiders we have no option but to adopt aggressive methods in self defence, and we can then adopt them. As regards Kuwait 1 do not thinh that bombing tribes will help us in the general economic question. ^his matter rests upon our relations with Ibn Baud and bomb- / -ing is likely to make him stiffen his embargo not to relax it. Evidence suggests that' this embargo is hitting local tribes as rauch as Kuwait and this needs further enquiry as effecting future policy we could bring to bear on quest-S 1 ^el©gram P © From olitical Agent, Kuwait. *o Aviation, Baghdad.

It is also, when not contrary to Kuwait Interests, presumably desirable to further British policy against the i'utalr. The first two objects can be beat served by obtaining the earliest possible nova regarding any con templated attack. vlth this object in view, I recomend most strongly that you ende vour to obtain immediate sanction for aeroplanes to cross the frontier, the near est point of which is only 42 miles away, as otherwise thay will be of comparatively little use against suoh an extraordinarily mobile foe. I ..ould moreover point our that they habitually cross the frontier from Iraq, neutral zone, and it is in best interests that they shot-la do so from hero also, so that it appears that they are part of our ordinary plans and not special help for the Ohaikh of Kuwait.

After compliments. . We beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 54-C.., dated the 16th Sha f ban 1^46 (8-2-88) which contained the telegram you received from the Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persia Gulf. We request you to send the following to his honour for | conveyance to the Central British Government by the , quickest route. It was our desire to get a reply similar to that of His Excellency the High Commissioner regarding tli» refusal of^ orininale, bafora tha daepatch of tli# aaroplanne, with iils Exc^llancy’G ordars which wars an I against our independence arid despise^ll&gt;Q, our national authority within our country, thereby they trampled over the treaties upon which we with tlxe British and /Iraq Governments consented to observe them(See Article ?! of Bahra Treaty and % of Jiddah Treaty) His Excellency after he had ordered and permitted all these aggressions and after breaching those under* taking, he informs us that the •Iraq Government will not » give shelter to Dawish and his followers. Tile •Iraq Government as well as the officials % in •Iraq stated that they intend to punish the ^awish within our country# They have no rule or law that gives such right to them within our countiy • They ventured to break the written treaties while Dawish and his followers live in a special zom in our country which is well known. What Is the fault of Sharanar, Anazah aid Karb tribes, who are living in the north west of our country, that the aeroplanes visit theraA*-,a \a in the early morning every day and maltreat them* Why were these visits not paid to the Dawish when he was in f Iraq land for many days doing just as he liked, while the British forces looked at him but not a single bullet was fired against hira* We can only explain the recent action of the officials in f Iraq as an aggression by which it is intended that hurt should be done to'Hajd and new troubles created. After the action of the aeroplanes and the despising of the treaties between us, all the Hajd people have become like Dawish in hie.opinion, vehemence and venture. They now do not respect the undertakings with f Iraq for the reason that from the Muhamraarah Treaty uptil now six articles have b^en deliberately broken, for which pleaae refer to the following:- lw The second paragraph of the first Article of Muhamraarah Treaty 2 . Article III of Uqair Protocol# 3. Article I of Bali rah Treaty 4. Article V of Bahrah Treaty, 5. Article IV of Bahrah Treaty, 8 . Article VI of Bahrah Treaty* When a reference is made to these articles of j agreement and compared with the f Iraq Goveriiraent actions towards iiajd, it will be seen that these Articles were de- deliberately infringed by t&amp;n certain incidents against whichi we protested to the British Government(against them allj and S did not get any result from any of our protests, and the j •Iraq Government did not carry out one of these articles, nor stopped doing what (the agreements) prohibited. The N belief that existed and still exists is that the Government who permitted for its ownself the breach of six undertakings will be able to add to then some other articles and go against them and will accept the Dawish and his followers* if we were to punish them at the present time for their sake and will not hesitate to breach their undertaking*3 ' p We were angry at the Dawish’s actiom and diEapproved it f and we gave liin partial puniolurjent and promised to give him complete punishment on a conditio* * to which were added- two other onea* We made matter* e quit/^ at the frontier and awaited the discussion about the undertakings that were broken for putting an end tc everything but the action of the f Iraq Government destroyedUll the hope©) what we had built and we had no excuse to put before our nation and people and nothing remained for us to say to them* Thus they became fo sucl&gt;4 condition and state that we can hardly estimate the result, after they have seen that their ; agreements are broken and their country is despised* in addition to which t^** humanity suffered by the hands ol civilised men, while we notice with an eye of regret and broken heart what destiny brings. We can see no arrangement for the present situation which may settle it but a prudent one that the Central British Government may take to enquire about the person responsible who caused these actions in f Iraq and to put the responsibility on him and will from their side restore the confidence of the I people so that the undertakings made have a value and respect. Then they should take such actio* as may restore the old confidence between the two countr’es. We, in spite of all that happened, still do c our best to quite* the agitated state, as we, till the last hour, believe that the British Government which has been' c*Ur friend for a long time will not agree that th* relations between U&amp;jd and Britain should be threatened by some self interested agitators, whose Interests are against the treaties. Should the British Government not take st*ps with all possible speed to remedy affairs in the manner we have suggested, we cannot estimate the results and4 we cannot accept responsibility tor tlieia.

I cii acucsed the situation in with Shai kh Abdulla bin jaa Q.x.r*.&gt; last Monday and reported the result under my telegram Bo.0-8?• Xhe next day Bhai&amp;h Mohaned bin joa came to sec ne to talk about Arab tribes* Be knew ouch less about then than i had boon led to suppose* The following observations are derived from these two Bhaikha and others* It is Bin Baud’s settled policy to hold Arabia by moans of Akhw&amp;n wholly dependent on himself, ror this reason as tribes and individuals become infected with the peculiar religious microbe which spread through Arabia some years back, he sent them his own teachers. Thao© ren in structed the tribesman whose capital hitherto had been invested en weapons, herds of camels and flocks of sheep to sell th©ir possessions and settle down in villages. Bere their sole occupation was to perform the stipulated prayers at the proper times. As they had no other work of any sort many of the Akim an practically lived in the nosques. For their livelihood they had to trust to the generalty of Bin Baud who hoped in this way to keep them wholly dependent on himself, and have an army at his beck and call armed and rationed by himself* The policy was very successful with the rank and file of the Akhwan who sold all that they had, but certain tribal chiefs did not sec the wisdom of beggaring themselves and forced \ thereby being fjftfcft&amp;k to submit to the cap **ic©s&gt;f the ruler of uajd. The kept their property though they occasionally dissembled in bo far as they sent their flocks and herds v/ellwell out into th© desert# where they could not bo seen daily by th© Akhwon, what Th© policy of Bin Baud is th© reaeon for has so often been described as hie outstanding generosity. Dr. Dan© in the * Uaaon Memorial Hospital w report for 19&amp;4 has recorded. * Han from all parts of Hajd con© and vieft their ruler. Each petty Shaikh or Beadnan of a division of a tribe takes with him several of hi a*subject^* when he calls at the capital. Each caller has hi a name registered by a secretary# who keeps a daily register with names of visitors# and each day the nan© is read by the 'Mudh&amp;ifaS or caretaker of guests# to the Sultan. One day th© , Jaudhaifa 1 showed ne a list of a day and a half with a total of 79? visitors# and every one of thee© is fed from th© royal kitchen# and ^overy one upon leaving receives a change of raiment# 30 m© Pieces of silver and- supplies for the journey 1 * • Th© above description is that of a fine patriarchal s&amp;at© of society# but Bin Saud has to be generous otherwise his starving subjects would soon deprive him of both kingdom and life# as th© Akhwans# who have lost their flocks cannot live on prayer alone. in addition to reducing his tribesmen to a state which in Europe would bo styled ' pauperism** Bin Gaud appears to have monopolised the trad© of the country in a manner which must make th© Bolshevists ©nvious. It is well known that contrary to th© wishes of the powerful kutair tribe whoa© port of entry the town is# he has practically killed the trade of Euw&amp;it# in order to further hie own policy. He has enforced this policy# hitherto without by means of the armed riders of Bin Jilawi in such a thorough manner that snuggling is practically unkown. I recently had a letter from Bin Gaud through his local agenta^ant asking Tor uy aaoistance in obtaining opeedy claarance through the Bahrein Cue tone ol* 10*000 bags of rice for him self. He keeps ctyvery olose eye on the sale of kerosine oil by the Aifiglo-i J ersian oil Company and oooe time back object ed to the activities of Haji Williamson, Be controls trade in fact as well as in name in a manner most unusual in such a large area as that i under his rule. Be grants concessions to his favourites for so long as they enjoy his favour, ^usaibi^a many services to Bin Baud are rewarded not by cash but by trade concessions, 7;hich give him a sucker^ grip on the whole of the trade of Ujair, Qatlf and Jubail. His influence with Bin Baud and the consequent pressure ho can bring to hoar on ii&amp;jdie, enable him to purchase even pearls at a price below that of hi a competitors, in the political sphere it keeps all Najdia in Bahrein absolutely subservient to ^usaibi, as was shown in the Per- Hajdi uion/riots of 1923. At the present time the Hajdi will not impart information, ' Do you wish to out my neck'? he asks if questioned. When Bin Baud conquered the Hejaz he was advised to raise a standing army both to garrison the country and as a counter-poise to the Akhwan, it was explained to him that a policy which night suit the deserts would not suit the holy oities of islam. Moreover a reserve on whom he could himself fall back v.as necessary if for any reason the Akhwan should be antagonised. Bin Baud, it is said, would not accept this advice, which on first sight would seem to have been sound. To keep the obedience of the Akhwan Bin Baud must have unlimited supplies, if for any reason he should fall temporarily short of supplies, the Akhwan, who have not much sense and moreover a#i£Araba whose brain is in thei rthoir oyeo, would aay &lt;■. 'we have fallen into di afavour and Bin Baud intends to destroy us* Yesterday he gave us ric© but today he refuses us w . The n&amp;in v?©a]£n©as of Bin Baud * &amp; policy however is the power of the big tribal chiefs which he undermined k U t j- iaB been unable to destroy. The leading Shaikhs of the kutair* Atai^iah and Ajman have always been jealous of hio power. Bin Baud is afraid of a combination of these three tribes following their tribal ;heacl8 but Bhaikh Abdulla considers that he would in time be able to destroy them* all oven if united, as disunion there is \n all the tribes, Moreover h© could bring the other 12 Akhwan tribes against them. Sultan bin Bijad known as Bin Hunaid, Shaikh of the Ataihah has a rival named Shaiboni, who although not as powerful as Bin Humaid could give him serious trouble, in the sane way rivals could bo set up against Bin Bawish and Bin Hathlain, Faisal bin Sultan al Dawish often called ibn Aehqali ( the grey camel) after hio mother as there is doubt about his paternity, is the head Shaikh of the Mutair, He is said to have been born just after Shaikh Rakhan of the Ajuun was led away captive. Sultan al Dawish married Bokhan*a wife without waiting for the death of her husband. He belongs to the Aiwa i-C- section of the idutatr, the other section being the Buraih of which ibn Busayis ibn Ash wan is the leader. Faisal jbn Dawish sub section is named Al DoahonijlSjjWother sub sections are Al JiblanBunder I bn I»aai and Al ^aghana under Jui*ran ibn Fugham ^Shaikli Abdulla bin Isa al Khalifa considers that Bin Baud must b© secretly inetgating the Akkwan in their raids on Iraq, He points out that the Akhwan are depend ent on him for their arms, ammunition and even food itself. He has only to cut off supplies and the Akhwan are helpless. * Without&gt; -S- Without aaiaunition they oamiot even raid. Th© head Shaikhs IsVV have certain reserves but these ar© linifced^Quantity* While agreeing with shaikh Abdulla that the first raid was probably nade with the cor^ivcjic© — of Bin Saud. i think it should be renenbored that lawlessness grows with what it feeds on. Successful raids supply both th© incentive and the neons of carrying out others. For this reason it is outt© probable that the subsequent raids were mad© against the wishes of Bin Baud* although his inforna£ho kept him informed of tribal intentions. I not© that in each case Bin Baud has sent a warning to the British government of the w uncontrolabl© excitement of the A tribes” . I have not yet been able to get any confirmation of th© Kuwait report that the Akhwon have boon coercing Bin Baud to join them in declaring a Jihad against all non Akhwans• Bhaikh Abdulla who sent a special Bedouin messenger to Hasa on Monday 27th February to verify the report# very x*ightly pointed out that a matter of such major importance would certainly become known in Bahrein. Since Monday Bahrein has been visited by a northerly gale# which is still ( Saturday) be1owlng wjth vigour# so that ordinary communication wit^ymainland by jolly-boat is cut off and consequently no news has cone through.

U • B. jn converoation with me uusaibi said he could not understand the action of the Mutair who war© out of hand but there was no chance of their bringing any -mmy pressure to bear on Bin Baud. Sharif Al W&amp;i who took Taif for Bin Baud is said to have deserted his cause for that of the joan lahiya of the I amen. The people of Mecca have complained very bitterly to Paridoon Bay the Turkish rapreeentativ© about the oppression of Bin Baud. Pahad bin Suwailain^ a relation of the Governor of ^atif and a leading merchant of Bahrein, has received a letter from ibn Musaad Governor of Hail stating that Bin Baud has become much disturbed and called on the Headmen Bar&amp;id&amp;h of ^aoio, Shaqrah and Hiadii to advi se hi n as to the moans of dealing with the Akhwan trouble. Bom© advised him to fig^it th© Akhwan while others comsolled the reverse. Bin Baud had ©xpreased groat fear of Bin guaaid joining Bin D&amp;vush. The letter states that the Akhw&amp;n are bent on Jihad against Iraq and Kuwait now and Qatar and Oman later. The Akhwan have protested against Bin Baud’s recognition of H&amp;tar arid Oman which they consider to be infidel state*© only fit to be conquered. The reason for the breaking up of Fahad bin Jalawi^ force was the protest of his followers regarding fight ing against Bin Bawlsh. Th© Ulanm advised Bin Baud that itIt is illegal to force j&amp;hw&amp;n to fight each other. A nan who arrived in Bahrein from Juhail on 27th February stated that the Ajnan were cent©opiating a move north towards jr&amp;q and iiuwait. Br. Dune has several jells ±n hie hospital but as they had left their homes m Qasim etc 30 to 40 days ago their information is of no value. Bin Baud’s letters are not sent by one messenger. he sends them to Bin Jilawi at Hasa, who arranges for their despt&amp;ch to Bahrein. Xhe last messenger did not breathe a word about conditions on the mainland. Il&amp;jor Holmes, representative of the Eastern and General Syndicate has been ±n communication with Bin Baud with a view to entering Bajd. jn reply to a letter written on 12th Bocember, Bin Baud replied by a letter dated 22nd January saying he would arrange for major Holmes to go to see him at an early date. A few days back, apparently on the same day as i got Bin Baud’s last con- muni cation and shortly afterwards Major Holmes got a not© saying that owing to internal trouble Bin Baud had much to do and could not make it conveni©?it to meet him at precant but would let him know when and where to moat him after hi a business had been completed. quaaibi mentioned casually to Major Holmes that h© would probably be invited to go to Jeddah# but not until 3 or 4 months had passed . This information confirms my opinion that Bin Baud is not in a position to meet any Europeans at present.

Memorandum from the High Commissioner for Baghdad, to the Poli tical Resideft, Bushire, No. S. 0.-2740, dated the 28th November By direction of His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq, a copy of correspondence as marked below is lor warded with compliments. Enclo. VII to Serial No. 67. Letter from the High Commissioner for Iraq, to Colonial Office, DATED THE 26th NOVEMBER 1927. (SECRET.) I have the honour to refer to my telegram No. 569 (No. 629 to Resident, Bushire, and Political, Kuwait), dated the 25th of November 1927, regarding the letters addressed to me by His Majesty the King of the Hejaz and to transmit for your information translations of the letters in question (2 letters dated the 6th November 1927). 2. I would invite your attention to the fact that the letters were written on the very day of the attack on the Busaiyah post and their wording sug gests that King Ibn Saud was aware of the impending attack and was attempt ing, if not to justify it, at least to excuse it in advance and to charge the Iraq Government with the blame. and neutral zones and against the flights of aeroplanes over Nejd territory is somewhat singular in view of the fact that, as reported by Sir Edward Ellington in his telegram No. 558 (No. 617, to Resident, Bushire, and Political, Kuwait) (Enclo. 3 to Serial No. 62), dated the 18th of November 1927, no aeroplane or armoured car had up to the date of the attack on Busaiyah been near the Nejd-Iraq frontier or the neutral zone since last April. His Majesty’s letter on the subject is not very definite and it occurs ro me that he may have had in mind the proposed Arabian air route from Basrah to Karachi, his objection to which as you are aware he has already based on the alleged military activities of the Iraq Government on the Nejd frontier. 4. Provided you agree, I do not propose to reply to either of these letters until a reply is received from King Ibn Saud to the communication referred to in your telegram No. 409, dated the 14th of November 1927. 5. I would invite your attention in this connection to Sir Edward Ellington’s secret despatch, dated the 21st of October 1927, forwarding a translation of an earlier letter from King Ibn Saud on the subject of the Busaiyah post. Materials for a full reply to this letter have been collected, but the attack on the Busaiyah post occurred before the reply could be des patched, and consequently it has not been sent. 6.

VIII to Serial No. 67* Translation. Letter from Abdul Aziz Bin Abdul Rahman al Faisal al Sard, to His Excellency the British High Commissioner for Iraq, No. 2/3- M./3/27, dated 10th Jamadi Al-Awwal, 1346 (6th November 1927). We have already addressed to Your Excellency two letters when we were in the Hijaz, the first dated 9th Rabi Al-Awwal, 1346 (5th September 1927) and the secmd dated 24th Rabi Al-Awwal, 1316 (21st September 1927)^ No. 2/3-M./3/27, in which we explained to Your Excellency the effect upon the souls of the contravening of Articles of the Uqair Protocol concluded on 12th Rabi Al-Awwal 1341, by the construction of forts at Busaiyah and Nabah (or Niah), and told you of the commotion this action will cause in Nejd and the troubles it will create. On arrival at the capital of our Nejd territory there was submitted to us from all directions in Nejd protests against the con struction of these forts deeming the same to be in contravention of the treaties between ourself and Iraq. The rumours which have reached the tribes as a result of the work of construction have been very effective in the causing of commotion. It has reached them, as I have informed you in my previous letter, that the Iraq Government had constructed these military posts in order to threaten Nejd with them and that they were going to build a railway to Busaiyah and Nabah with a view to strengthening these military posts against J Nejd. Although I myself do not believe in the truth of these rumours, I however interpret this daring action of certain Iraq officials, in their con struction of this fort only as a means ti bring about misunderstanding and difference between us and Britain. But our desire not to leave any -way open for difference to arise between us has induced us frankly to explain to you the facts about the situation in Nejd in order that you may do your best—which we have no doubt you will do—for the solving of this problem and the closing up of the avenue of difference. As you are aware, most of the inhabitants of Nejd are desert-men and that the greater part of their winter abode in winter and spring is in the northern and eastern regions of our country, close to the Iraq frontier and far away from our headquarters. Aware as I am of the evil effect on their minds of the threat of this fort, i am, fearful of some sort of aggression on it being taken by them, though it may spell the destruction and extermination of their lives. We are afraid of such result which is loathsome to us. That is w r hy we have addressed to you two letters from the Hijaz for the purpose of averting such things before serious developments set in. It is however regretted that w r e have had no answer from you to our two letters. Out of the desire on our part to expedite the removal of the cause of difference we have written this to Your Excellency, hoping that you wall order the removal of these forts which are contrary to Article 3 of the above mentioned Protocol and the retention of which is fraught with evil possibilities of a nature that I cannot bear. Responsibility for any incident that may occur will fall on the shoulder of him who has been the cause of the contravention of the text of the Protocol. * As you are aware, I am doing my very best to prevent causes of difference and am striking with an iron rod on the arms of any one wishful of disturbing the peace of the relations between us in the present circumstances. But, as it is not hid from you, our headquarters are remote and our people are on the borders of Iraq, with the argument in their hands; while vile intriguing comes their way from the direction of Iraq. In the circumstances I am unable to guarantee the safety of the frontiers so long as this new post, contrary to agreements, stands between us. I am strongly confident of Your Excellency’s assistance towards the removal of this post in order that tranquillity may be preserved. Please accept my profound respect. (Seal of Ibn Saud.)

I also described the bad effect which this action had produced in Nejd, and how it had perturbed the minds of the people—a natural result, of which I have been afraid ever since the construc- tion of these forts—in spite of there being high responsible authorities at Baghdad and ’Amman, as you are well aware. The desert people on my fron tier frequently receive provocations..I 6 T wrote to Your Excellency the day before yesterday, after I had * at Riyadh and described the increasing spirit of disquietude prevalent frontier, the ill consequences of which I feared and still fear, as I do not U ^ anything of the sort, which certainly does not please me. ’ Want As soon as I realised the vehpmence of the people’s feelings, I issued sf * orders for any movement on the frontier to be suppressed, as f am all for i ings, the question amicably in accordance with the law. S ° V ' Since writing you my letter No. 3/M -27—2/M., dated the 10th Jarna^ al-Ula, 1346 (^.e., 5th November 1927) a report has reached me that som desert people have decided to go out, or have actually gone out from som 6 unknown place, to oppose the construction of the fort. I have not yet obtained any confirmation of this, but I immediately ordered the forces resposible fn the safety of the frontier to follow them and investigate the report that the*^ have crossed my frontier, and if possible, prevent them from doing so. I to/ to hear that they have been stopped, but I have ordered their arrest and punishment if the story about them be true. U I want you to know that this news has reached me so that you may realise the extent of the disquietude caused by the construction of the forts, which in fact, is contrary to our previous agreements, as also the difficulties which the Government of this country is experiencing in preventing these incidents that have dimmed the whole atmosphere of the relations between the British Gov ernment and myself—merely for the sake of erecting these ill-omened forts. It is my earnest hope that I received timely help from His Excellency the High Commissioner in having the building demolished, so as to enable me to pacify the hearts of the people in this country, and prevent the occurrence of untoward happenings throughout the length of the frontier lying between me and those countries, which lies at a full month’s journey away and itself extends for a similar length.

Answer from Bin Saud to my letter has now been^ received. I authorised Political Agent to open, and he telegraphs following Begins. We regret action of Mesopotamian Government in these davs as it is breach of agreement between us for preservation of peace. We see in each incident proof of lack of good faith of Mesopotamian Government and we give a few recent happenings from which you can understand situation. The refugee Shamar tribe used to raid Nejd territory, and we protested to Hio-h Commissioner. About November last year High Commissioner warned us that party of Shamar having left Mesopotamia were gathering m Syrian desert with intention of attacking our tribes. As attacking tribes cannot enter our territory without previously brawling in territory of Irans-Jordan or Mesopotamia we protested against Mesopotamian Government, w e received no reply from High Commissioner to our protest. Ten months later Mesopo tamian Government began to build military posts at wells near frontier, and spread rumour that those places would be joined up by rails, and become strono- fortresses on week frontier. Also action had worst effect among Ne]d tribes” and as it was contrary to article 3 Uqair Agreement of 12th Eabi-us-Sam 1842 we sent protest to High Commissioner on 9th Rabi-al-Awal. High Commissioner omitted to reply to this protest but replied only to^ our hrst protest regarding movement of Shamar from Mesopotamia to Syria, .tie said as it was the intention of Mesopotamian Government prevent movement of sueh raiders they had established posts near Nejd frontier. The number of fortresses is mentioned in his letter No. 9663, which we received m August 1927 You can see that these fortress posts are far from the road by which refugees had gone to Syria. The Nejd Army saw that posts are erected only as a provocaton. We again protested to High Commissioner on 24th Eabi-al-awal 1346. No answer was received. On reaching Eiyadh we saw clea.ily the raiding amongst our frontier tribes and that it was difficult to keep order on excited frontier. We wrote from Eiyadh to High Commissioner on 10th Jamad-al-awal informing him of the state of affairs and followed this with an other letter dated 12th Jamad-al-awal but still no answer came. We could see no (rood reason for his silence. The longer the silence lasted more critical became situation and finally it became impossible to preserve peace on the frontier We request you to communicate to the British Government our strong protest against Mesopotamian Government. We wish to preserve peace and mendly relations with British Government. Mesopotamian Government will be res ponsible for anything that occurs. Ends. Original will be sent to Bushire.

He says dispute not about distance in miles but about breach of Uqair agreement forbidding use of frontier wells for military purpose either Article 3 is in force and Mesopotamian Government should remove buildings especially Busaiyah posts or alternatively Article is not in force and treaty with Mesopotamian Government is cancelled. He protests at breach of agreement and asks for immediate removal of buildings. I have also received another long letter dated 12th, Jamadathumusni in reply to my despatch No. 128 which I will telegraph fuller particulars to morrow in which Ibn Saud regrets the attack on Busaiyah and states that he has issued orders for punishment of perpretators and prevention of further action while correspondence about ill-omened affair (?) is progressing.

Letter summarized in my 148, dated oOth Jamadalawal is apparently pro test against delay of receipt of replies from Baghdad and not reply to message sent in accordance with your telegram of November 26th. Reply to latter is dated 12th Jamadathaniand which I summarized as follows. Ibn Saud astonished at Busaiyah incident requested me to telegraph you his regret. For any issued orders for inquiry and punishment of offenders and strict watch on frontier and prevention of further incident while correspond ence regarding fort is proceeding. Compensation is a triple, but before discussing it he invited attention to question of resposibility which falls on Mesopotamia. Secondly ; this case should he compared with others like it which have taken place between Meso potamia, Trans-Jordan and Nejd and Hedjaz. He warned Mesopotamia of bad results which their conduct entailed, but received no answer. He invites your attention to his letter of 30th Jamadalawal describing iniquities of Mesopo tamia their attempt to cause trouble between him and His Majesty s Govern ment. Ibn Saud stresses High Commissioner’s long silence and his subse quent strainge way of replying by making protest a means of breaking again ss protocal ” by building number of posts of Ibn Baud’s protection.2 Nejd would be pleased if Mesopotamia raided them regret but will not submit building on land at places and wells visited by them and others where they have prohibited.) (This will he repeated). Ibn Saud also protests at Mesopotamian breach of treaty of Uqair and of Basrah caused by firstly Biwaniyah writing direct to Mohamedan at Tinki and Jaza Mijlad regarding claims for plundered property. He protested to HH Commissioner, but received no answer. Thirdly; he protests at visits to frontier by motors of Mesopotamian officials and by aeroplanes. He says this is done either to provoke collision with his tribes, or some unjustifiable reason. Fourthly ; everybody objects to attacks in some of the Mesopotamian news papers connected with Government. Ibn Saud claims to have prevented his people from raiding since treaty with Mesopotamia (has not done so ?). The Nejdis finally got out of hand when they saw buildings being erected contrary to treaty, when they themselves had been prevented from building posts in similar situations within their own territory. He begs His Majesty’s Government to look with justice on his case. Ends. There is now doubt whether Ibn Saud will come to Hasa after this inci dent, but your letter has already gone. Enclo.

Before however such action is taken a message should he addressed to Ibn Saud in the sense of the last two sentences of your telegram No. 596. Ibn Saud should also be informed from us that since the action of tne raideis as in direct defiance of his authority permission has as a temporary measure and awaiting the reestablishment of his control over the recalcitrant tribes been given that British aircraft if necessary in order that effective punishment may be administered may pursue raiders across the frontier. i 869(C) F&amp;PD mrnmm ~ i ii. mmtgmmEndorsement erqm the Political Resident in the Persian Gulp, No. 411-S., dated the 17th December 1927.

Translation of letter No. — 27, dated the 30th Jamadi (30th Novem ber 1927), from U. M. King Abdul Aziz, to the Hon ble the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf. We regret the action of the Iraq Government in these days which * is a breach of the agreements entered into between us and them for the preserva tion of peace and order between the two countries. We see in each incident that takes place between us and them a proof that it was not done with good intention by the Iraqp Government and I give in detail a number of recent incidents from which you can understand the real situation between us both. The Shammar tribes who took refuge in Iraq used to raid on the Nejd frontier and we have protested against such raids at that time. I do not want to repeat in full the details of what happened. After some time the High Commissioner for Iraq warned us that a party of Shammar had left Iraq and were gathering in the Syrian desert with the intention of raiding our tribes in our country Nejd. This was about the month of November last year. We took this action to be contrary to the agreements for the prevention of raids as the raiding tribe cannot enter our territory without entering either the boundaries of Trans-Jordania or Iraq. We protested against the Iraq Govern ment for allowing this and asked for the prevention of such incidents. But the High Commissioner for Iraq kept quiet and did not reply to our protest at all. However, after ten months of our protest the Iraq Government began to build military stations near the wells and places near the frontier and spread a rumour that they were going to join up those places by railway lines and will then make them strong military fortresses on our bound aries, whereas Article III of Uqair protocol of 12th Rabi II, 1341, does not allow any building at the wells and stations near the fron tier. We protested against this action which had the worst effect among the Nejd tribes and caused undescribable excitement and rage. We .sent our above mentioned protest to the High Commissioner for Iraq on 9th Rabi I, 1346, but the High Commissioner neglected to reply to this protest of ours and replied only to our first protest against the egress of the Shammar from Iraq to Syria with the intention of raiding our country. He said that as it is the intention of the Iraq Government to take precautions for the prevention of the going out of such raiders they have established them (i.e. posts) on the frontier adjoining Nejd territory which, as you can see, are far from the road from which the runaway have come to Syria and has no relation with that (road). The number of fortresses has been mentioned in his letter which we received in August 1927, No. 9963, while the erection of such fortresses is forbidden in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. All the Nejd people have seen that they were erected for the purpose of causing discord and2 harm. Again we wrote to the High Commissioner repeating our protest against the action of the Iraq Government on the 21th Rabi I, 1346, and explained to His Excellency in that letter the degree in which the erection of such buildings and stations is contrary to the previous agreement and the excite- merit and disturbance which this action caused at Nejd but we did not receive a reply to our letter. But on reaching our Tsejd capital (Riyadh) we saw clearly the extreme agitation and rage among our^ tribes living near the frontier, on account of tnat action. I found that the situation has become very critical so that it was very difficult to keep order on the excited frontier. Again we wrote to His Excellency the High Commissioner for Iraq from Riyadh on 10th Jamad 1346 informing him of the state of affairs, and I followed this with another letter on 12th Jamad I 1346, but although we did this no reply came from the High Commissianer to all our repeated protests and we could not see any good reason for this keeping quiet. The longer the silence lasted the more critical became the situation and the more the°disquietude increased and it became more difficult to deal with it or rather it became impossible to preserve peace and order on the frontier between us, and them. I have written this to you on account of your proximity to us, with the request that you will communicate to the British Government our strongest protest against the action of the Iraq Government, as we w r ant to preserve peace and friendly relations between us and the British Government. The Iraq Gov* ernment w:ill be responsible for anything which occurs.. Enclo. 2 of Serial No. (80).

It was coincidence that attracts a man s attention. We sent out protest about an important and ■ critical matter the reply for which was written after two months and more than this we get it after three months. His Excellency the High Commis- sioner stated in his reply that he was surprised at our protest about the I building of the fort and other similar ones at the frontier and that the first was miles aw r ay from the boundary. ,, We do not want to argue with His Excellency about the miles whether* they be tar or near as we had no agreement about fixed miles and the agree ment between us winch is accepted and considered is as follows— (Article three. Both Governments on the part of each of them under take not to use the water and wells existing at the borders of the boundary tor any military purposes such as the building of forts at them or the mobilisa- tion ot troops at their borders). This is the wording of the article three of U]air Protocal dated 12th Rabi-al-Awal 1341. o d tPen , Busaiyah, the places belonging to it, the waters near by it and other places at the border come under this article w 7 hich had forbidden building at them Was there any mention in the article about the miles or the distance ? And is that building a breach of this article or not ? If they-(Iraq) pretend that this breach was in our interest for prevent ing raiders from raiding us the Najdis consider such sort of a building as a breach of their treaties and precisely the road that leads trouble to them therefore I can see only two clear methods of meeting the situation, either the abovementioned article is considered in force in which case the buildings erected should he removed and Busaiyah should be the first of them as they are contrary to the proyisions of the said article or this article is not to be carried out and the forts built are not removed in which case the treaties with the raq Government will all be considered cancelled, for which we shall feel verv sorry for the obstinacy which the Iraq Government displav. We still reneat our protest against the breach of that article and ask for the removal of the bmldings which have been erected at the earliest date in compliance with the undertakings m the interests of order and as a precaution against troubles w ich arise on account of letting matters lapse and become critical at the frontier as we have explained in our previous letters to His Excellencv the Hign Lommissioner on the subject* J Usual ending.6 Enclosure XIII of Serial No. (98). Translation or letter erom H. M. King Abdul Aziz bin Saud, to the Political Agent, Bahrain, No. M-3-M.-3—27, dated 12th Jamal al Thani 1346, le. 3 7th December 1927. After compliments. We are in receipt of your letter No. 128-0. of 22nd Jamad al Awal 1346 conveying a message sent by the Hon’ble the Political Besident to us, in which he states that H. B. M.’s Government were astonished at the recent incident at Busaiyah. We request you to telegraph to him (the Political Besident) that we were more astonished and regret very much its occurrence. We have issued orders for enquiries about the people who had done it and for their punishment. At the same time we have issued orders for a stricter watch on the frontier and have taken all the necessary steps to prevent any further action until the end of the correspondence regarding this evil omened fort which has been erected only for purposes of intrigue and for causing troubles. As regards the compensation referred to in the letter it is a trifling thing which is not 'worthy of causing a dispute between us and the British Government. But before discussing this matter w r e w r ant to invite the attention of the just British Government to the matter of the responsibility and on whom it falls iu this case, whether on us or the Iraq Government ? A second thing'—This case should be compared w ith the others like it wdrich have taken place between Iraq, Trans-Jordina and Nejd and Hejaz. Por wdien the responsibility is faced and the matter is compared with the previous incidents the compensation can he fixed. We—and we believe that the justice of the British Government will support us—see that the responsibility falls on the Iraq Government as they alone had caused this incident. We have already warned the Iraq Govern ment of the bad results w 1 * * * * * 7 hich may fallow 7 on their behaviour towards us. But the only reply was silence or procrastination or lame explanations. , The Hon’hie the Political Besident on referring to our letter of 30tli Jamad-al-Aw 7 al 13 i6 —25th November 1927 will observe the difficulties and troubles w T hich the Iraq Government have caused and are causing to give rise to a dispute between us and themselves and in addition to that to cause trouble betw'een us and the British Gevernment. When one looks at all the actions of the Iraqi Government towards us one w r ill not see that they are the actions of a friendly neighbour to one in treaty w T ith them but the spirit of an enemy wall he seen and rather yon can say that they are a breach of the spirit of peace. I give in detail a chain of actions done by them (Iraq) in these days from w 7 hich you can understand their real situation and it wdll make clearer to H. B. M’s. Government the responsibility for ohe recent incidents. 1. The High Commissioner for Iraq w 7 arned us that a raiding party of Shammar were collecting in Syria to raid our country and that the Iraq Government w r ere not responsible for their action. I protested as the raiders w r ere bound to pass on their way to our country either through the territory of Trans-Jordania or Iraq and asked that the responsibility of the same may he borne either by the Iraq Government or Trans-Jordania but the reply w T as as I have informed the Hon’ble the Political Besident in my abovementioned letter—a silence for about 10 months without a reply. Then came a reply but in a very strange w r ay as he made our protest a means of breaking the pro tocol entered into at Ujair wuth the Iraq by building a number of forts for our protection and for preventing raiders from raiding us. The Nejd people would be pleased if the Iraqis raided them every morning and evening hut they do not agree to the building of one metre on the w r aters and the places on which building has been prohibited by an official document. These places are visited by them ard are their watering places as well as places of visit and watering for others than them. Trouble broke out in Nejd on account of this building in the manner I described to the Hon’ble the political Besident.2 The Iraq Government were not satisfied with this sort of breach but began’to interfere with the chiefs of our tribes and called them to attend its meetings (conferences). This is totally prohibited by the provisions of t treaties entered into at Ujair and Bahrah. An example of this is a letter fiom the Mntassarrif of Divaniyah to Mahammed-al-Turki bin Mijlad and aza in Miilad asking them to look into the claims relating to the piuad - tribes. We have protested against this action in a letter which we send to the Hi'-h Commissioner for Iraq, dated the 1st Rabi-al-Awal 1346 u no reply has been received from the High Commissioner up to this hour and we cannot ‘iindcrstand tlio cause for this neglect. 8 The motor cars of the Iraq Government officials and also some aero- planes are always going as far the frontier and mix with °ur Arabs- This is dune with the intention of having an effect on our tribesmen either^ op suade them to commit an act which will cause dissension between neighbours or for some other reason of which we cannot see the justification. 4. Those who study some of the Iraq newspapers ^ connected with the High officials of the Iraq Goverment vill see tiom the connected wit t e i» Government show- indications of the attacks and insult against us and o thig vcu will see that the amount of hatred and hidden (^oaoj ict hi t, 3l1 ‘ • o, officials to Iraq Government have broken our treaty first by allcmm| her offic^ls to communicate with our subjects and by allowing their officials to .visit our communicate witn oui suuj •' tribes to cause sedition and have country with their motor cars among oui 1 ''‘ u , ,,,, f ..np.v. no t broken their promise by building these P os s that leads to the ess st:: rtrsrrc* rrt “ wKh«° t&gt;, S„, P LiUe .» all thi, fool;. s' those people *hose feelings have been ^ thei / n ei g hhour waiting for respect dishonoured, their treaties b the coi]sent Qf the his chance inside those building &gt; , totally from raiding from Government.

I consider that it would be useless to press them to send delegates to Kuwmit till atmostphere clears. Immediate action neces sary seems to be (i) to protest against raid on Ghalidh (ii) to clear up once and for all question of Iraq’s right to erect fortified posts at substantial distance from frontier. I am advised Arabic expression “ Ala atraf al hudud ” means immediate surroundings of frontier. I therefore suggest message containpd in my telegram immediately follow ing should be^despatched to Ibn Saud at once by Besident in the Persian Gulf. As Ibn Saud in his messages referred to in Bushire telegram T.-144 (T.-114 ?), constantly complains iniquities of Iraq Government I suggest an addition to this message to efPect that His IVIajesty s Government do not consider Govern* ment of Iraq have shown any tendency to evade their treaty obligations and that recent actions of Mesopotamia vis a vis Nejd Government and Akhwan tribes have full approval and support of His Majesty’s Government.

Polio wing is opinion regarding situation of affairs in desert country. Dawish is acting contrary to Ibn Sand’s wishes and the latter is just as anxious for peace on the border at the present time as we are. He is in a very difficult position however as he is hated in Hedjaz and has enemies in Nejd even among his own family (his brother and nephew were almost certainly at the bottom of the plot to murder his son and Ibn Jilawi last summer), and the people whom he has to rely on most to keep him on his throne are the Ikhwan tribes. Consequently, although he is extremely annoyed with them, he will not dare to try to punish the Mutair, particularly in vie^v of the oath taken by Dawish, Sultan bin Humaid, Ibn Hithlain in 1926 mutually to support each other in such a case. On the other hand it is probable he will re-establish his authority by persuasion and peaceful means and will then be in a position to keep tribes quiet, at any rate for some time. This is what is hoped will happen as anything would be better than the appaling chaos which wpuld follow revo lution in Nejd even if it did remove ban on trade with Kuwait. Meanwhile recent events and success in raid which Dawish has up to the present enjoyed are having a very prejudicial effect on our prestige in Arabia (Iraq Government has no prestige and is looked on as a negligible quantity). It is argued our aeroplanes cannot protect the frontier or harm raiders. Our respect for treaties and frontiers is not understood : our reason for not retalia ting and punishing Mutair by bombing them or their villages is that ice cannot? or dare not. Were we to take such a course and go right into Nejd to punish them Ibn Sand might possibly protest but really he would be very pleased. Unless our aircraft have good fortune to get an opportunity to teach them a severe lesson soon not only will all desert tribes inevitably become Akkwan soon but the movement would probably spread to the Jezireh. Such is opinion here among intelligent people. Enclo IV of Serial No. (99). Telegram from the Political Agent, Kuwait, to the High Commis sioner, Baghdad, No. 269, dated the 31st December 1927.

New Shaikh of Anezeh tribe has come in to see me to beg immediate action he taken. He says that owing to want of water at Anezeh headquarters whole tribe are clamouring to go to neighbourhood of Birlussuf south-west of Najaf but fear to do so because of Ikhwan threat. He urges confidence he restored by immediate air attacks on Mutair headquarters which he believes Ibn Saud would welcome. Railing this he asks me to send aeroplanes and armoured cars to be with him for some time and restrain his tribe from panic. If something is not done immediately he fears half his tribe will become Ikhwan and join Eaisal al Dawish and remainder will flee to Syria to ask protection of French authorities. I am considering his request for support of aeroplanes and armoured cars but it is plain that all opinion now favours air attacks on Mutair.

(Repeated High Commissioner, Baghdad, No. 7.) I would stress point in Kuwait telegram No. 268 that even if Ibn Saud could punish Mutair, which is doubtful, he probably could not do so for political reasons since if he offends Ikhwan susceptibilities his main and hereditary support is gone. In arguing against po^t at Busaiyah he is more than probably merely voicing frontier tribal opinion not because he wants to, but because he has to do so and his statement that this post and others projected have caused excite ment amongst frontier tribes is correct. My own information corroborates political Agent, Kuwait, that Ibn Saud would not be sorry to seo Eaisal al Dawish disappear but he cannot take action to this effect himself, I have to-day received telegram from Bahrain saying letter has come from Ibn Saud in answer to my letter seat under sanction of your telegram 438, dated 9th December, saying that he is detained by pressure of work at Riadh but hopes to meet me later. I think there is little doubt that he is post poning meeting until situation clears and until he has taken such steps as he can.

(Repeated Political Resident, Bushire.) ,im!i 18 , cofi« : yd My telegram of 30th December. Akhwan raids. Whole question has now been further considered. His Majesty’s Govern ment are convinced that whatever may be the personal attitude of Ibn Saud towards raids, as to which results of Haworth’s conversation with Ibn Saud must be awaited, it is essential that early steps should be taken to make raiders understand that further aggression on their part will not be tolerated. In view of the difficulty of catching raiders red-handed, which would clearly be best and most effective method, only practicable course appears to be to attack their headquarters from the air. Selection of particular villages etc., most suited for such attack must be left to your decision in consultation with Air Officer Commanding. Air Ministry suggest following objectives as possibly suitable for purpose :—Hafar al Batin, Jariyah Al Ilyah, Jariyah as Siflah. Would no doubt consider what advanced bases it would be necessary to establish in order to facilitate attack. Question of bombing main tribal headquarters at Artawiyah has also been raised but the place could presumably be reached only from bases in Kuwait and political objections to using Kuwait territory for such a purpose are obvious. I shall be glad to have your views on this point. You should send immediate message to Ibn Saud informing him of latest raid and stating that we regard it as absolutely essential to take punitive action against raiders who, by his own admission, are acting in direct defiance of his authority. He will understand these measures indicate no hostilities towards himself but are temporary expedients forced upon us by conditions arising out of his loss of control over his own tribesmen. It should be made clear to him that our action will take the form of bombing villages of guilty tribes. i)After a lapse of a reasonable interval, during which warnings would h dropped, punitive action would be taken accordingly. Every care should h exercised that no action is taken against any place which has been occupied Ibn Saud’s regular troops or where his authority has been re-established^ As to this you will no doubt confirm rumour mentioned in your tele»r a No. 622 that Artawiyah has been occupied by Ibn Saud’s forces. You will doubtless do all that is possible by show of force or such other means at your disposal to restore confidence of wavering Iraqi tribesmen. Enclo. XV of Serial No (99).

If letter comes from High Commissioner, Iraq, it will possibly, notwith standing fact that he will be acting for you, tend to increase Ibn Saud’s irritation with Iraq and produce further letters from him irritating Iraq Government.

Euclo. XX of Serial No. (93). Telegram from the [High Commissioner, Baghdad, to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, London, No. 9, dated the 4th Jan- uary 1928. (Repeated Political Resident, Bushire, Political Agent, Kuwait, No. 4-S.) Your telegram No. 1. Question of attacking tribal headquarters has been discussed with Meso- potamiao Ministers and Air Officer Commanding Unanimous opmion is. that such attacks are impracticable. Except at Artawiyah, u Inch is too remote buildings are not known to exist-other places are merely wells or small oases where tents are pitched and occupants would presumably scatter on rece nt of warnin- and render subsequent useful operations impossible. Ex- S maps are very inaccurate and there is no British officer in Mesopotamia with snfficient locafknowledge to insure machines reaching their objectives. Whatever ouerations are undertaken they must fulfil two equally im- “m. (i) to put immediate .top to mid., (ii) to P»»»h a“ SE ly as possible. These objectives can, m my opinion and that of the Air Officer Commandino' be obtained by exercising air control over as large an area ot Neidterritmv as possible. Two air bases under armoured car protection will State itablLied immediately. B»» will &gt;* teSSn frontier at first but will be gradually moved as far south ; a f°“ S ’f oth ends snnnlies etc renders practicible, being finally located if possible at both ends of ^neutral zone. Warning will be dropped on P wt ies camped^ or territory where Mutair usually graze, telling * e Moving bodies south of frontier. If they do not do so they will p ^2 ed will M pJ“f t a C k ed unaccompanied by flocks and herds can on y e ra d th t Ib Saud &gt; s force &amp; whenever met without warning, there is no uan^ei ium j-uijr | 8 will be in area controlled. These measures will, in our opinion, be the best method of (i) checking frontier raids, (ii) inflicting punishment on Mutair, (ijn proving to Akhwan that if they can prevent Mesopotamian tribes from g raz ing peacefully in Mesopotamia we are equally capable of preventing them f rora grazing peacefully in their usual pastures, (iv) forcing Mutair to submit tn Ibn Saud. These measures will make it impossible to meet Anezeh Chiefs request for presence of aeroplanes and cars with his tribe but they should effectively reassure Anezeh. It is also intended with immediate object of reassuring Mesopotomian tribes, and probably as permanent measure, to establish small posts equipped with Lewis guns and wireless at Salman and Shabichah. Bedouin opinion is strong that blocade of Hasa ports is best weapon against Akhwan. It would not however be as rapid and effective as attacks on Mutair and is open to objection that it would appear to be*directed against Ibn Sand himself and not only against his rebellious tribes. I am however still of opinion that this measure should be adopted if those proposed in this telegram do not prove effective. Latest news from Nejd very conflicting but indicates that Ibn Sand’s measures against Dawish have been checked by threatening attitude of Ataiba tribe. If latter combine with Mutair expert opinion holds that Ibn Saud will be powerless to reduce them by force. Adoption of measures indicated above will necessitate amendment of message outlined in your telegram No. 1. Presume you will instruct Bushire accordingly. Enclo. XXI of Serial No. (99).

Ibn Saud’s letters should reach home almost immediately and will show whether I am raising a negligible point. I fully realise High Commissioner is His Majesty’s Representative, my only point is that Ibn Saud appears throughout to identify him with Iraq in all his complaints and for Iraq as well as for air route it is essential to obtain as calm an atmosphere as possible.

His Majesty’s Government have instructed me to write to Your Majesty to inform you that they regret to state that about December 22nd Paisal al Dawish, the Shaikh of the Mutair, crossed Mesopotamian frontier in considerable force near Jokah and raided Mesopotamian shepherd tribes and some Shammar of Nejd com mitting* heavy slaughter. He then moved north-west to attack Dahamshah outlying portion of Anezah tribe, who fled before him. Your Majesty will understand that this action has caused great alarm among the Mesopotamian desert tribes. On December 9th he had already attacked the Mesopotamian tribes in the neutral zone killing 59 men and raiding 7,500 animals. In consideration of this latest raid on the 22nd December His Majesty’s Government desire me to inform Your Majesty that they regard it as absolutely essential that they should take pnnitive action against the raiders while Your Majesty has already admitted to us that they are acting in direct defiance ol Your Majesty’s authority. Your Majesty will of course understand that these measures are taken in no hostility towards Your Majesty, indeed the contrary is the case, but they are temporary expedients forced upon us by the fact that the Mutair have go out of the control of Your Majesty. The tribes can only be reached by air methods and it will thus be necessary for us to attack the guilty tribes from the air within their own tribal areas. I trust that this undesirable episode will soon he brought to a satisfactory conclusion and that I shall have the honour to meet Your Majesty and by discussion, which is so much better than writing, prevent the repetition of sue acts as those committed by the tribes, which must be as unpleasant to Your Majesty as they are to us.

As it appears that the King of the Hijaz and Najd in his recent letters to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf refers in some detail to corre spondence exchanged between himself and this High Commission during the past year, it may be of use to you to have for reference the enclosed copy of a summary of this correspondence copies of which have been communicated to you at various times.

Summary of correspondence with Ibn Sd’ud, etc. No. j Description. * Reference to correspondence. 1 Correspondence was initiated by the High Commissioner in July 1926, with the object of warning Ibn Sa'ud that certain Shammar tribes who had mig rated from Traq to Syria were believed to be contemplating raids on Najd. In reply to a request from Ibn Sa’ud that more effective measures should be taken by the “'Iraq Government to prevent raid ing, the High Commissioner informed him through the British Consul, Jiddah, of the measures taken to this end and also sent a list of the Shammar tribes believed to be in Syria. The High Commis sioner added that while the Traq Government could not accept responsibility for raids carried out by such tribes against Najd, they would do their best to prevent raiding parties from crossing Traq territory.Summary of correspondence with Ibn Sa 7 dd etc. —contd. 9 Ibn Sa^ud replying to the British Consul said that he must protest to Syria ; if the raids continued however and if the raiders were allowed to traverse the '’Iraq corridor he could not be held responsible for reprisals taken by his tribes. He enclosed at the same time a list of raids to show what his tribes had suffered. The British Consul in acknowledging receipt pointed out that some of the raids mentioned had already been dealt with and that the remainder were receiving attention but that he was forwarding the list to Baghdad. No further reply was sent to Ibn Sahid by the High Commissioner. In November Ibn Sa’ud wrote a further letter to the British Consul drawing attention to the importance of checking raids from Hraq and emphasising the fact that though the raiders may have come from Syria, none the less they had to pass through 'Iraq territory and consequently the 'Iraq Govern ment must bear the responsibility. He urged that this matter should be settled at the earliest date possible. No reply was sent to this letter.. The Secretary of State commenting on Ibn Sa'ud's letter (see 2) considered that some responsibility rested on ’Iraq in respect of raiding parties traversing the 'Iraq corridor and asked for pro posals for preventing such raids. The High Commissioner replied in February 1927 giving' details of the different 'Ir^q Police posts designed to intercept raiding parties. (Busaiyah w r as not included.) The Secretarv of State replied in July 1927 that he considered these measures adequate and suggested their communication to Ibn Sa'ud. • This was done in August 1927. The list of posts was amended by the Ministry of Interior^ and Busaiyah was included. Reference to correspondence Ibn Sa'ud's letter No. 166 dated 22nd October, 19^!

It was the building of this post which enraged Faisal al Dawish and the Akhwan.. In September 1927,. Ibn Sa'ud addressed to ’'the High Commissioner a protest against the building of barracks and forts at Busaiyah on the ground that it, constituted an infringement of Article 3 of the IJqair Protocol.

Description. 10 A draft reply (not referred to the ' Iraq Government) was at once telegraphed to the Colonial Office, repeat ed Jiddah (An aerial photograph of Busaiyah was also sent to Ibu Sa'ud by mail via Jiddah). 11 The Colonial Office, after 16 days'delay, telegraphed that Jiddah has been authorised to communicate reply to Ibn Sa'ud ; suggested that the message should also be sent through Bus hire, as Ibn Sa'ud was reported to have left for Hasa. This was done, (though it turned cut that Ibn Sa'ud was still at Riyadh). Note .—An acknowledgment of this message was received by Consul Jiddah from the Hizaj Ministry of Foreign Affairs who disputed the location of Busaiyah. No acknowledgment however was received from Ibn Sa’ud until the middle of December when the Poli tical Eesident in the Pursian Gulf receivtd two letters from Ihn Sa’ud of which copies have not yet rea hed the High Commission wide telegram No. T.-114. dated 15th December, 1927, from Politi cal Eesident to Secretary of State'. 13 In the meantime a further letter was received from Ibn SaTid acknowledging receipt of the High Com missioners Utter of August 17th (See No. 8) point- incr out that the High Commissioner had taken nearly a year to answer his letter and that erection of “ frontier ' posts by the 'Iraq Government, even though intended to check raiding into Najd, were contrary to the Uqair Protocol. He must therefore insist on the removal of these fortifications which w 7 ore causing alarm and commotion among his tribe?. Deference to correspondence.

Ibn Sa'ud's letter No. 273, dated 2jst September. 1927. bote .—This letter was referred to the ’Iraq Government and it was proposed to supply Tbn Sa ud with detailed information of the position and strength of the posts. The ’Iraq Government agreed and supplied the information, but the attack on Busaiyah inteivened and the letter was not sent. 14 On November 5th, the day of the Busaiyah attack, Ibn Sa'ud wrote to the High Commissioner that on arrival at Riyadh he found that the tribes_ were filled with resentment on account of the military activities of the ‘ Iraq Government ; he ^ added that the tribes were on the ' Iraq frontier fax from Headquarters and he could not guarantee the safety of the frontier unless the frontier forts were dis mantled. In a second letter written on the same day he referred to the resentment aroused among the tribes by the flights of British aeroplanes over their territory and the visits of cars to the frontier and neutral zone. Ibn Sa'ud's letter No.2/3 and No. 3/1003, dated 5th November 1927. 15 On November 7th, Ibn Sa'ud wrote a further letter to the High Commissioner stating that information had just reached him that certain desert tribes had actually gone out to oppose the construction of the Busaiyah Post. He had sent forces m pursuit to stop them and to effect their arrest and punishment if the report proved true. He again urged the immediate demolition of the Post. Ibn Sa'ud's letter No. 3/Mb — 27/3/M., dated 7 th November, 1927.Summary of correspondence with Ibn Sa’ud, etc .— concld. No. Description. On November 14th, the Secretary of State instructed the Political Resident, Bushire, to transmit a message to Ibn Sa^ud protesting against the attack on the Busaiyah Post and asking that the offenders should be punished, compensation paid for killed and wounded and measures taken to prevent further raids ; Kuwait Conference also to be postponed. On 8th December, 1927, a telegram was received from the Political Agent, Kuwait, saying that Shaikh Hafidh (Ibn Sa'ud^s representative, who had been sent to Kuwait to attend the conference) had been instructed by Ibn Sahid to warn the High Com missioner that serious trouble had broken out in Nejd and that a force was marching north contrary to his orders. 18 The Secretary of State authorised the Political Besident, Bushire, to despatch to Ibn Sa'ud a message acknowleding the warning referred to in para. 16 and informing him of the conflict between British aeroplanes and an Akhwan force in the neutral zone on December 9th and adding that as a temporary expedient and until Ibn Sa'ud had re-established control of the frontier areas, British aeroplanes would pursue Akhwan raiding parties across the Nejd frontier where necessary to inflict a lasting and salutary lesson. 19 On November 30th Ibn Sa'ud wrote to the Political Besident, Bushire, referring to past correspondence between himself and the High Commissioner claim ing that his protests against raids from 'Iraq had been ignored and then answered by the crea tion of frontier posts in defiance of the Uqair Protocol. He had protested again and again against the creation of these posts without effect. The re sponsibility for subsequent events rests with the 1 Iraq Government. Reference to correspondence.

In March 192 m tne camel corps was attached and almost annihilated by the Akhv^an. It was realised by tile , Irat£ Govern- mexit that Yusuf al Sa^un had made use of his position to further his own interests and had given provocation to the iUchwan, and he was accordingly removed from his position. Subsequently in February 1925 he visited Ibn Sa’ud at Hiyadh. Ibn Sa^at as he admitted in a letter to Sir Percy Cox, welcomed him with honour and hospitality; he was also reported to have given him a large sum of money. Yusuf then returned &lt;SvJU to ’Iraq ana gave^th&amp;t he had been appointed by Ibn Sa’ud as Ms Agent to collect zikat from the ’Iraq tribes and to build a fort and mosque at Abu Ghar etc. (Ibn Sa’ud denied the truth of tMs.} iy virtue of his supposed appointment Yusuf induced the Akhwan tribes to assist him in raiding Ms rival hsumd ibn buwait ana to defy the ’Iraq Government, ana was prevented from causing further trouble.

Reference Bushire telegrams ending with Ho. 32 to you dated February 20th and Delhi telegram no. 384-8 of February 21st. 1 need not remind His Majesty*s Government that we are dealing not with problem of petty frontier raids but with critical situation certain to affect decision upon what is perhaps most weighty project now under consideration within British Umpire and its dependencies, namely combined pipe line and railway from Baghdad to Mediterranean. f ;’his probably XA transcends in importance not only questions of arranging aeroplane flights from Basra along the southern shores of the Gulf to India but even possibility of temporary effervescence among Indian Khilafatists. If some means cannot be devised of conti'olling or checking incursions of Bejd tribe Mutair, whose last raid beginning on February 20th is reported by Hoyal Air Force still engaged in attacking raiders, as 1200 strong, whole desert at least as far north as line from RUTBAH to DAMASCUS vdll become untenable, and pipe line and railway must take northern route through Syrian territory. '.'his will probab^ mean great loss to British basic trades, ruin of Haifa and blow at prosperity of Palestine besides p re v en t,ing British Mediterranean fleet from using the oil in the event of any future hostilities in which France is neutral. Flans of oil companies and capitalists are almost matured and decision as to route must probably be taken within the next few months. Comparatively'17 2 Comparatively minor problem but one of con -siderable importance is discharge of our obligations to defend Iraq and Kuwait and Transjordania and to guard against possibility, which with these very strong bodies of raiders may at any time become serious, of holy cities llajaf and Karbala being laid waste by Wahabis, as occurred in early 19th Sentury. \=; He cent seriets of completely unprovoked raids heyan early in November and have continued nvith unprecedented ferocity and cruelty up to the present. I'tern protest by His Majesty's Government reached Ibn Gaud at the beginning of December and it was only after nearly two months delay, after it. became evident that the Mutair tribe was out of ibn Gaud’s control and after declaration by paramount Shaikh of Iraq Ajiezeh that unless emergent action were taken his tribe, dominating deserts between Mesopotamia and Mediteeeanean, must either become Akhwan or take refuge in Gyria, that liis Majesty’s Government decided on air operations against rebel tribe in Hejd territory. 1 had myself suggested warning to Ibn Gaud that if he did not regain control within a fixed period Gulf ^orts would be jtas blockaded but His Majesty’s Government preferred alternative which they took. Beeult of operations has been that raiders have had their favourite and least vulnerable line of access to Iraq denied to them and have been forced to attack, as in t the last raid, along route which has exposed them to reprisals in which they h&amp;x are believed to have suffered heavily. Meanwhile loss of control by Ibn Gaud has become more patent than ever. lie has been obliged to disband mixed force which he had raised against Mutair and to abandon combination against them which he had hoped to bring about. He has covered his failure by violent protests against His Maj sty’s Government’s policy of attacking the rebel tribe within Hejd territory, a policy similar to that years several times adopted in recent by the Government of India towards Persia when Persian Maluchistan tribes have raided9(X&gt; 3 raided British territory and Persian Government has been and Iraq forces should be able to preserve peace of desert by defensive measures within Mesopotamia, but with vast line of desert open like ocean to pirates who can pick and choose lines of attack and retreat, only remedy is as with pirates in China or Algiers, to rout them out in their jhsxxx bases, if they think their bases secure nothing will prevent con- -tinuance of raiding. against the raiders ( and there appears no other p&gt;rospectj and if His Majesty^ Government were to reverse the policy of aerial attacks within hejd territory the only alternatives would be either to declare blockade against JNejd ports and thus bring pressure to bear on whole Uejd Government without penetration into Jazirat-al-Arab or to permit and instigate Mesopotamian tribes to revert to (bid habit oc ouunier-raids into Hejd and so deprive Hejd raiders of security within thei: own territory. ''his would throw whole desert into con- -fusion and would in view of ill-regulated nature of tribal warfare rapidly involve other flejd tribes which had hitherto been friendly to Great Britain and Mesopotamia. Baud might do some good in so far as it might convince him of the reasonableness of His Majesty 1 s Government*s attitude but it is not likely to increase his power of controlling Akhwan tribes and this is the essence of the whole question. powerless to punish them.

In normal times there is no need for an Intelligence Officer here. Kven now I think the only things he could do which I do not (1) having no other work he could go round himself more and so get news quicker and (2) he could employ secret service agents. But I think he would be worth having for (2) alone at a time like the present. I have no funds for secret service nor do I consider it desirable that I should employ spies, yet they are undeniably useful and Kuwait would be best place to recruit them for the sort of tribal work required. I do/ not advocate Jetting a man from India as it would take too long and also because he would be quite useless unless he knew Arabic really well.

But X would submit our policy also turns upon one other point: can aeroplane action finally deal with tribes engaged in raids ? is it not true as suggested in Baghdad telegram© has. 93 and 104 that to get effective action they must attack bases except in such rare Cases as they can find tribes in close formation and is it not natural instinct of tribe© to ©cutter at sight of aeroplanes ? If this is true and punitive action other than defeating a raid always entails the envisaging of raids on base© in ftejd will this not entail the accidental killing of women and children? If so it might defeat its object and should be used only a© a final necessity. indignation at action of Mutair tribe in killing chixdren will be useful argument with 1 bn Baud but not if we accidentally but inevitably repeat it ourselves. On these premises it would appear that only present course is action as expressed in your telegram Bo. 02•^o6 2 and in Ui€ wean time fox Kuwait, with which l am concerned, gtnci also Iraq, if 1 nay say so. to take neceanary defensive measures, which naturally includes maintenance of defence posts and armoured cars and offenaive defence but only going beyond the frontier in actually rex^ulsing a raid.

Dbtat Iraq should hold her/ regular troops in preparation to meet situation I realise to be necessary but if tribes prepare for counter-raids can High Commissioner control situation ? Further if private emissaries from 'aisai go to Hejd tribes will it not be the end of all hope for a solution of present difficulties ? I feel assured that the crux of the present trouble is the private enmity between Ibn Baud and Faisal. Chat will Ibn Baud do if he finds out, as he is bound to find out, about these messengers ? Will he not even suspect U8 ? If Ibn Baud is still in effective control, as I am tempted to believe, the arrival of private emissaries from Faisal will set the blaze on fire, while if he is not in effective control it will ratike him go the whole way with his tribes.

Whatever may be the cause of the delay some cause exists and I think uir Bepys Bray’s suggestion is the only solution. I have confidence in the ability and tact of my Agent at Thargah and he is a man of very good position. ? would send him with instructions to go to Hofuf and see the Governor, Ibn Jiluwi, and then that if possible he should go to Piadh to see Ibn f&gt;aud and tell him that things are reach** ~ing a hopeless condition and one which is totally unnecess- ~ ar y» that we are ready to do all in our power to put matter r ight but that unless he meets us half-way the present sit- -uation must go from bad to worse, that Bueaiyah is eighty ftiles irom frontier ana has three permanent wells between it and frontier and that further raids will make situation irn- -passible. 1 Cfin explain things to my Agent and we shall)&amp;x£± at any rate know what Ibn Baud says and as much as the Agent can see. 1 propose going to Bahrain next mail about 5th March and if the above is approved of I will call Agent there and despatch him to Hofuf and will in the meantime ask Political Agent, Bahrain, to arrange with Governor, Hofuf, for his visit.

What worries one is not coping with the sit- -uation hut my continual disagreement with everything Iraq says or does. You will see that I have seized on your duggest- -ion of an Arab being sent. It was difficult to suggest going myself till we knew the situation in Arabia. s I agree that we must go nap on Ibn Baud. If he then lails us/the position is what Iraq is now making it but if we can get him to meet us halfway we may save the situation and I still hope it can be saved. If it cannot i do not know vhat the result will be. Yaisal at Baghdad is only waiting his chance to get back to Kedjaz. We know he formerly did intrigue with the liejd tribes and if he does so now with his emissaries it appears to me the finish of things and the end of ibn Baud’s confidence in us and then total chaos in Arabia.

Bated 1st received 2nd torch 1928. Your telegram ho. 116 of 28th February. I am entirely opposed to counter raids of Iraq tribes, objections to which were clearly set out in part two of your telegram No. 104 of 22nd February. Further object- •ions to such a course are (l) that it would finally remove any graf prospect there may be of Ibn Baud succeeding in re- -establishing control and stopping raiding and (2) that it would definitely convince Ibn Baud that our air action was designed not as means of punishing raiders but as instrument of Faisal’s personal hostility towards him. Objections appear to me to apply equally to preliminary steps which Faisal wishes to take. Once the idea of counter raids is mooted amongst tribesmen and preparations are authorised it seems almost certain that action by tribesmen will be precip- -itated, particularly as the Government of Iraq cannot be relied upon to exercise effective restraining influence. You will understand that there is no intention of ruling out employment of tribal levies to assist in defence of Iraq under the control of Air Officer Commanding as was done at the time of the Turkish menace, but if Air Officer Commanding considers he can usefully organise and co-ordinate trlbes-men for this purpose and if he desires to do so it should be clearly understood that they must be wholly under his control. So long as Air Officer Commanding is respon- •siole for defensive operations His Majesty’s Government could not countenance in any circumstances unorganised tribal cation.■2 S£f- I doubt tlic wisdoni of J&amp;i, fsul*s proposal t#o sond. ^Tivuxt' messengers to I«ejd Chiefs.

Thus while he 1ms to ride/ the wave he is apparently not sorry to have the excuse that he cannot control a movement which will show his strength on the frontiers of Trans-Jordania and Iraq ana which will demonstrate the danger of a rising which he can use as a political argument. Chus his move to Pocea is possibly to get a meeting with someone front London to whom amongst other points he will reiterate his complaints that the whole trouble has been brought about by what he maintains is the incorrect attitude of Iraq. our attack across the frontier has enabled him in his letters to shelve the quest* -ion of the attack on Jusaiyah and to drag a rea herring of our action against the treaties. it may even be said that he has gone to Mecca sonner than he intended to avoid the constant press- -ura of his tribes to join openly with them. He desires to kaep in with Great Britain but he must keep in with his tribes* To do both is at the moment a difficult pro- -position but one which in the long run he can probably con 1 -trol since Bedouin warfare unless held together from out- -side is apt to peter out. In the meantime wo cannot relax our defence measures for we are in greater danger of raids than we were but we can hope the danger will not be maintained since without ammunition from I bn Baud the tribes cannot continue attacks for long on a big scale. ,v.d:IrBNT.'V&gt;S Telegram From Secretary or state for the Colonies, To Political Resiaent Bushire and high Commissioner, Baghdad.

With reference to Bushire telegram Ho. r 290 of March 3rd to me reporting the despatch zx of note to Ibn Baud on February 26th from Bahrain, Hafiz ahbah aays mere suspension of operations will not be enough for Ibn Gaud to restrain tribes. Nejd tribesmen have, accostding to Hafiz ?;ahbah, accused Bin Baud of inciting I the British offensive against Hejd. He earnestly reiterates his previous suggestion viz. that His Majesty’s Government should give Bin f.iauu a written assurance that if peace is restored and punishment inflicted by him the fort of Buoaiyah will be demolished. An assurance would also be necessary that if Ibn Gaud takes punitive action against tribesmen and any of them fly to Iraq, or Kuwait we will surrender the fugitives to him. With these two written assurances Hafiz V’ahba thinks Bin Gaud could get tribesmen under control and chastise Faisdl al Bawlah and his followers. I Hafiz Wahbah lays stress on urgency of action in the above sense. If they delay it may become impractioible. I have no sufficient local uata to judge whether the two above mentioned assurances would inaeed enable ibn Gaud to nscovar control over the tribes- •raen/ and punish the guilty. 1 can only estimate the situ tion2 1,01 situation as viewed from Cairo. But if there is a fair chance that such would ha the result imssse of these assur- -ances 1 think they should ha considered.

Can we make it app~ ••ear not as a weakness or if as a weakness as one done out of our strength and as a concession to our friend I bn Baud ? The question is largely one for Iraq to consider with an open mind. The object of the Busaiyah fort and the other forts projected is to maintain peace on the frontier. If Ibn Gaud will give his \¥ord that he will be responsible for all raids, will punish all offenders and will pay com- -pensation for all injuries we in return could agree that no forts should be built. If this succeeds it strength- saved -ens ibn Baud ana the despatch of one regiment/would pay ^ould pay for a permanent^of one officer from the British Government and one from Ibn Baud to sit on the frontier for ten years to see the agreement carried out. It may be argued that Ibn Baud h is not at present the strength to carry out his agreement.

M0 e 40 Dated IStli March 1928* Tour telsgram Mo* 124 and Baghdad telegram &gt;- No. 144. Tith imminence ol* raids and present general position it is doubtrul whether Ihn Baud can do anything to alter matters for the moment hut it stands out that he is still the ruler of Nejd and local Arabs refuse to ■believe that the Akhwan can stand without him. King Faisal said to me at Baghdad that the difficulty of Ibn Baud’s position lay in his attempting at the same time to rule a people by means of fanaticism and to maintain tkx relations with civilised peoples on his frontiers. This difficulty has at the moment forced his hand. » The necessity of an emissary to him is greater than it ever was. It Is clear that 1bn Baud i Las no desire for this raid as such and that ha*wishes to maintain relations with the British Government. In % support of this it is confirmed from several sources that he had definitely collected men to punish Faisal hin Bawish and I also have information that when the Shaikhs of . Shargah and of Has al Khalaah sent and went respectively to him with complaints he replied that these matters con- - corned the British Government. It appears to me still as always that the taels of all argument with I to saud and of all our action onon our part as long as Ms treaties exist is that tfce Ruler of 'ojd must prevent raids and 'b« resjonsi'ble for all losses incurred, if raids occur. 'i’he result of present anti- -cipated raid will show if the above argument is t«mable. I think it will he so notwithstanding his apparent itiabilltj to prevent this raid. If however this is incorrect the treaties in arc in this respect useless and new ones ®uat he made per - -Bitting defensive forts on frontiers. By the time that Clayton reaches Ibn Gaud the present crisis will be over and thus no concessions to meet present troubles but a permanent adjustment will bo required. ' As regards Article III of the tjqair treaty I do not think any mileage can be stated but the nearest wells to frontier would be those Indicated. Ibn Gaud refers to wells used by his people: these would have to be determined and defined and equally those used and required by Iraq. If tribes suffer heavily in this present raid task of readjustment will be easier. iTelegram ?• From Political Hssidcnt, at Bahrain.

Letter from Ibn Baud received in which he expresses regret for what has happened, recapitulates events and states that while the Futair acted in a way of which he could not approve at no time were they beyond his power in his own country, that he had got Dawish ringed and boycotted and with his food supplies stopped so that ultimately he had to try and get food at Kuwait but that the conduct of the Traci people in invading his country and bombing the innocent and guilty alike had forced his hand and had made it imposs* -iblo for him to finish the punishment he was ready to in- -flict. He regretted that impatient ones had got out of his control and were proceeding somewhere out of his ken. r hat he had now less information about what was happening there as he had had to remove his troops for fear they should be included in the bombing. That the only way he could see out of the difficulty was (1) the maintenance of the Uciair protocol and the destruction of the ill-omened Busaiyah fort* (2) the mutual refusal to shelter criminals. (5) prevention of officials mixing with tribes and causing sedition. (4) the British Government to hold responsible those who had caused the happenings on the Iraq, frontier and to punish them. That he agrees that a settlement could bette© be reached by conversations with the Resident than by correspondence and that if the Resident saw no objection to the meeting even at a time when he was unable to arrest the rebels, who are headstrong, he was ready to fix a time and place for a meeting to resolve the present difficulties.

This has fully and repeatedly been dealt with in correspondence ending with my letter to Ibn Saud No. 3.0.279 of 3rd February 1923, copy forwarded with my despatch Secret A of 3rd February. (4) The demand is of course absurd as the bombing in in Nejd territory was suggested by H.L's. Government themselves. I fear therefore that whoever meets Ibn Saua will find himself confronted by deadlock as he can only repeat arguments already repeated for years. The principal result to be hoped for from jLs the meeting sitlxtsx that Ibn Gaud will be convinced that K.V's.

His continued objection to fort ana the provocation it gave his tribes is his boot, defence against his responsibility for attack on it, which is otherwise indefensible. (3) His desire to prevent shelter of political criminals is understandable if impossible and point can only be mot by conversation. (3) He px-obably refers to Faisal's.intrigues, which we know have taken place. If wo can satisfy him that these do not have the countenance of British officials in Iraq without actually admitting that they have taken place we shall probably satisfy him. Both sides intrlg- -ue. Oriental diplomacy without intrigue is a contra- -diction in terras. (4) H- knows urfectly well that bombing could not have taken place without the sanction of his Majesty's Government. His object is fairly obviously to have a bolt hole.

He receive^ food from Bin Baud who also gave Bin Humai^ hollars 16000/- and ammunition. Mabhoot had not heard that Bin Sand had dissuaded Bin Humaid from making his pro jected raid so I am ascertaining the date on which he left Riadh.

In any case he protests against the pursuit of criminals into his territory, as an action to which he cannot agree. He considers that H.M.

He requests that his complaint may be in vestigated . He says that he has already warned Govt.that owing to aeroplandaction bands were out against Iraq and states that he ordered bin Humaid to follow the raiders and persuade them to return. Later he sent his relation Saud bin Abdul Aziz bin Saud (usually known as Saud al Arafah and not to be confounded with Bin Gaud’s son) for the same purr&gt;ose. Owing to the criti cal condition of the frontier he now pro poses to go north himself after a few days to persuade the Nejdis to suspend hosti lities until the questions in dispute are settled.settled by negotiation with H.M.Govt. ivin oaud assures H.M.Govt# that apart from his promise that the four just de mands mentioned in his letter of 16th Rama- dhan will be granted he has nothing to offer his people.
