Volume III comprises that portion of south-western Persia; which is bounded on the west by the Turco-Persian frontier : on the north and east by a line drawn through the towns of Khaniqin, Isfahan, -Yazd, Kirman, and Bandar Abbas : and on the south by the Persian Gulf.L IiABEHRl (SHtJU-I-) oe SHOE AB— A river of some size in western Bakhtiari land. It has its origin from? several streams, all of brackish water, in the hills about Jaru and the plain of Tuleh (2,000 feet). This feature becomes more strongly developed as the river pursues its course in a north-west direction, and the air in its vicinity, even, becomes redolent of naphtha. Its deep, sluggish pools are swarming with fish, which run up to 14 inches in length. It is nearly always fordable unless swollen by rain, when it becomes an impetuous and dangerous torrent. It waters the fine pasture table-lands, extending from the plain of Tuleh to the banks of the Karun river. In its final stretch it runs through a gorge on the north side of the Kuh-i-Fidalak and empties itself into the Karun, about 8 miles north of Shushtar. The river is known by many different names, besides the two given above, such as ^Ab-i-Shur, Darreh, Murdeh-i-Fil, 7&amp;n-\Mm&amp;(i\x.—(Layard—-Avbuthnot ) 1905.J. LAB-I-RUDKHANEII (?&gt;— Lat.

A village on the river Shatait (q.v.)&gt; LAR— Lat. 27° 43' N.; Long. 54° 24' E.; Elev. 2,975'. The capital of the district of Lar, 153 miles from Shiraz, and 127 from Bandar 'Abbas, situated at the west end of a valley running east and west and nestling at the foot of low, limestone hills, which block the west extremity of the valley ] it is not visible from any great distance on the roads leading thereto. It is an unwalled city, covering about \ square mile, dominated by two steep, -limestone hills, about 400 feet above the level of the city. The north hill is known as Kadamagah, and contains one or two huts and the ruins of an old fort, said to have been utilized as a prison for Baluch marauders in past times. There are traces of old building, and the remains of a large cistern, dug in the solid limestone rock, said to have been made by a colony of Gabrs who lived on the hill in past times. The northern slope of the hill was descended by a large ditch with bastions, the remains of which are still visible. This hill is crowned by the ruins of an old mud fort now entirely dilapi dated, and commanded from the top of the northern hill, which is about 1,200 yards distant. On the hillside below the fort stands a small square stone building with a dome, said to be the dome of Nadir Shah's mother; near this are two Persian baths excavated in the rock, and well sunk about 200 feet through the limestone. Lar has a population which it is difficult to estimate, but which would seem to be about 8,000. It has no local manufactures of any importance, the size of the city being due to its importance as a centre of trade, and a halting-place of large caravans. The bazar, which is in good repair, is very ancient, and is built in the same manner as that of Shiraz, being cross- shaped, the 4 arms, each 60 yards long and 14 feet broad, radiating from a central tank, which has a domed roof about 30 feet high, now (1907) the only portion remaining of the original roof. All the arms are covered with vaulted roofing about 30 feet high. On each side of each arm is a row of shops, on a plinth raised some 4 feet above the roadway. Each shop has a depth of about 6 feet, a small room behind serving as a storeroom. Round the central dome runs a legible inscription. Close to the west and east arms of the bazar are two very large roofed cisterns, some 35 feet deep, containing a large supply of good water. There are two mosques in the city, each with a large blue dome 60 feet high, visible from a considerable distance. There are 6 broken-down muzzle-loading guns close to the Sarbdz- Kkdne/t —deserted barracks on the north-east side of the town.The present (1907) Governor, Hajl Azuk •’All Khan, has been Governor for 8 years, and has a personal force of some 200 tufangchis, who icceive pay from him, and not from Imperial funds. They are armed with Mar tinis, of the usual cheap kind found in Persia; the Governor also possesses some Mauser rifles, but these were not seen. The roads leading to Lar are not entirely free from robbers ; depredations take place occasionally, though the danger from its source is usually much exaggerated by mule-drivers and others. The brother of the present Khan was killed by robbers on the Lingeh road some years ago. The transit road to Shiraz, from Lingeh and Bandar ■’Abbas is, however, of considerable dimensions. There are no Hindu merchants here, but about 30 families of Persian Jews. The houses of the town are usually commodious and well-built, with a central courtyard. There are numerous cisterns, in which rain-water is collected, and a number of large wells about 70 feet deep, which give brackish water. There is also a large qanat, giving a large supply of water for cul tivation and for the baths, drinking troughs for the cattle, etc. Supplies of grain, food-stuffs of the country, and fodder, are very abundant, as Lar serves as a distributing, as well as a collecting, centre for these articles. Camels, donkeys and mules constantly pass through the lown en route to the seaports and inland towns, but do not appear to remain for any length of time in or near Lar. The residence of the Governor is in the middle of the city, and is surrounded by a strong wall flanked with towers. The whole town presents an exterior of mud, and, when looked at from the hills above, appears low and grey. In the centre of the city, close to the bazar, are two large serais, about 80 feet square, surrounded by small rooms, and all caravans discharge their loads here. Many horses are bred, but not many mules.— [Craufurd, 1911, from native information^ The revenue of the Khan of Lar is reported to be greater than that of P&gt;andar ’Abbas, which was 13,900 tumdns in 1906. Through a narrow gap between the limestone hills west of the city the road to Jehrum, Darab and Furg—an alternative route to Ahwaz—passes the road to Bandar ’Abbas, runs east up the valley, and also a road to Furg which diverges at ’Aliabad. The latter is reported to be preferred by camel-drivers to the route by Fadumi. The present Khan has (1907) two brothers; the older, Hap Itustam Khan lives at Husainabad, the younger, Hajl Shaikh-ul-Haza Khan, has a good house at Lar, close to that of the Governor. Haji Azuk ’Ali Khan is a middle aged man, about 5 feet 10 inches in height, stout, and with a dignified bearing, and appears particularly affable in his dealings with Europeans. He seems to be much liked and respected by his subjects, whose patriotism does not extend beyond the boundaries of the province, and who express their dislike and contempt for the methods iff the central Government of Tehran with no uncertain voice.631 LAH—LaE His younger brother, Haji Azuk ’AH Khan, though well-disposed in his bearings towards Europeans, is a somewhat morose and sodden individual* The Khan possesses a son about 5 years of age. The lather of the present Khan, Fath 'Ali Shah, is responsible for the creditable state of the public buildings in Ear : he rebuilt the bazar and kirkeks, renovated the mosques, built the large serais, poor house, Sarbaz- Khdneh and several houses. On his death, the central Government is said to have extorted tumdns 100,000 from the present Khan, on the ground that the buildings that he erected were a sign that he had not remitted a proper proportion of the revenue. A plentiful supply of poles for roofing purposes is obtainable in Lar from the tamarisk groves in the neighbourhood. The limestone hills in the rear yield building and carving stons.—(Wilson and Cruickshan/c, 1907.) AKA KUH— Lat. Long. Elev.

A village in Kirman, to which a road branches off from that by Ahmadi from Bandar •'Abbas to Saidabad, at the 159th mile from Bandar 'Abbas.— (Gill.) LARISTAN— Geography .—A province of Persia extending along the northern shore of the Persian Gulf opposite to the Pirate Coast, and comprised roughly between Lat. 26° 30' and 28° 25 , and Long. 52° 30' and 56°. It has Pars to the north-west and north, Kirman to the north-east, and the district of Shamil on the east, while on the south lies the Gulf. The actual boundary line on the land side is, like that of most of the provinces of Persia, vague and ill-defined, but it may be said to start on the west, at the little sea village of Parak, which lies to the east of Tailin', and from there to take a semi-circular sweep in a north-easterly direction to Bid- shahr, passing just to the south of that village; from here it runs north-east to a point about midway between Furg and Rnstaq, and then taking a curve to the south continues to Kabku and Guhra, from the latter of which villages it runs md Latidan to the sea near Khamir. The above may be taken as approximately the geographical limits of the province, but, for administrative purposes, the entire coast-line, with the exception of the Shibkuh ports (p.) and the country extending back from it for a distance of some 20 miles inland on an average, forms part of the territory administered by the Governor of the Persian Gulf Ports, whose jurisdiction extends along the coast from Bandar Dilam on the north-west to Jask on the south-east. The surface of the country is diversified with plains and mountains, the general trend of the latter being from north-north-west to south-south- east, but the ranges in this province are not on the whole so extensive as in other parts of Southern Persia, nor do they attain the same elevation, seldom indeed exceeding 6,000 feet. Mountains rise along the whole extent of the coast, giving it a bold appearance, while many of the peaks seive^ as important landmarks to navigators of the Gulf. A great water-parting begins in the hills north of Lar, and extends up to Hajiabad m the Darab district of Pars, the rivers east of this flowing in the direction of Bandar 'Abbas, while those to the west of it drain into the sea between Charak and Bushire. The rivers are unimportant, the largest being, perhaps, the Shur, which flows into the Clarence Straits near Khamir, but this, like many ot the smaller streams, is salt, and therefore not of much value for purposes ot irrigation. Climate .—climate is trying to Europeans. In the belt which lies between the shores of the Gulf and the higher ranges inland the heat m summer is very great, and is increased by the sandy and barren plains with which this track abounds. During the first two months of summei a strong north-westerly wind prevails over the whole of the district, which at times blows with such force that it brings with it clouds of a highly impalpable sand, from the opposite coast of Arabia, a distance of moie than 2 . n autumn the heat is more oppressive than in summer, but m winter and spring the climate is pleasant. It is never very cold and snow seldom falls. The rains, which are not heavy, fall in the winter oi eaily spiing and are almost always accompanied by a south-easterly wind, whic i, though often very violent, hardly ever continues for more than three or four days at a time. History .—During 1910 and 1911 lawlessness was very prevalent in Laristan, although Saiyid 'Abdul Husain, Lari, did not take a piommen part in public affairs. The continuance of smuggling and the insecurity of roads prevented British trade from making any progress. The whole country from Bandar 'Abbas to Lar has been so devastated during the past 2 years by the Bahar Lu that many of the villages are on y half inhabited, anybody with anything to lose has left, and came s, e c., have been taken elsewhere.—( Cravfurd, 1911, from native information.) History and Administration .-—Laristan was conquered by a Tmkish Chief about 800 years ago and remained an independent kingdom untilLAR—lar the last of its sovereigns was dethroned and put to death by Shah *Abb3s the Great. It is now subject to the Governor-General of Fars, appointed by the Shah; and having his head-quarters at Shiraz. The province is i divided into the following districts :— 1. Gallehdar, chief town Gallehdar. 2. Lar Lar. 3. Bastak Bastak. 4. Hoi-muz &gt;&gt; Hormuz:. 5. Furg &gt;5 99 Furg. 6. Tarum 99 formerly Tarum, now Kahku. In addition to these the coast district mentioned above as being now under the jurisdiction of the Governor of the Gulf Ports, together with the islands adjacent to it, belong geographically to Laristan. This coast district includes the Shibkuh ports (q.v.), as well as the district of Lingeh, which for generations was governed by an hereditary Shaikh whose tribe— a branch of the Kuwasim Juwasim Arabs—had come across from the opposite coast, until in 1889 the Persians seized the then ruler by a coup de main, and having deported him to Tehran installed in his place a Deputy of the Governor of Bushire. In 1898 his son, Shaikh Muhammad bin Khalifeh, descended from the hills with a large following and seized the town. He was attacked by the Governor of the Gulf ports, supported by the Persian gunboat Persepolis, and driven out after a feeble resistance, in which the losses on both sides amounted to about 40 killed and wounded. A party of bluejackets was landed by H. M. S. Sphinx for the protection of British subjects. On the adjacent island of Qais we had a military station during the pirate wars of the last century. On the north-east corner of Qiskm island, which is separated from the mainland by the Clarence Straits, an important military and naval station was established by us in 182b, but this, as well as a station tried at the neighbouring islet of Hanjam, being found unhealthy, a move was made to Kasidu at the extreme north-west -corner of the island. This became the head-quarters of the Indian Naval squadron, and a detachment of Indian troops was regularly maintained there until 1879, when it was removed to Jask, where it remained until 1887. Basidu is still a British possession, but now consists of only a small coal dep 6 t. Ethnography .—The province is but sparsely populated. According to Vaughan the Bastak district alone contains 15,000 inhabitants, and assum ing that the other five districts have on the average a similar number, the total population of Laristan would amount to about 90,000. Such a calculation is, however, highly hypothetical. The inhabitants are partly Arabs an d partly Persians, the maritime population belonging principally to the former race, while the agriculturists are chiefly Persians or a mixture of both- I n addition to these two classes there are a large number of nomad Arabs, whose predatory habits and lawless ways are a terror to the more pe ac ‘eable portion of the community. The following are the principalgBgHBE35S3£9fiHHflH9H GS5 LAR—LAR A considerable proportion of the inhabitants is Sunnis, whose antipathy to their‘Shfah fellow-countrymen might possibly_ he^ turned to account in the event of our undertaking military operations in this part ot leisia. Resources .—Laristan is one of the poorest and least productive of the Persian provinces, ranking in this respect probably only se ^nd o e Bashakard district. This is due in part to the lawlessness which prevails, hut still more to the character of the country itself. Much of it is an and desert, diversified by rocky hills and valleys of sand and salt, ihe inhabit ants depend for their water-supply to a large extent upon cisterns and reservoirs, built with great labour, to collect the scanty rainfall, and upon wells. Irrigation on anything approaching an extensive scale is impossible under these conditions. By far the most important product is the date tree, which flourishes throughout almost the entire province. Some wheat and barley is also cultivated, especially in the Lar and Bastak districts, while minor products include indigo, gum ammoniac, galbanum and sagapenum. Good graz ing is found in many parts of the province, which supports immense flocks of sheep and goats, besides smaller numbers of cattle, camels and donkeys. The swamps opposite Qishm island can provide large quantities of fuel a scarce commodity in this, as in other, provinces of Persia, and a consider able supply is also said to be obtainable from the Kuh-i-Gavbus lange near Minerals are not known to exist in any quantity in Laristan, but sulphur and ironstone, with traces of ancient mine workings, are found in the moun tains to the north-east of the village of Hormuz (^.y.), while many tons of salt are annually exported from Qishm, where there is a cliff, 200 feet to 300 feet high, of pure rock salt. ^ _ r The latter is found in combination with iron ochre, which is also exported in considerable quantities. A coarse naphtha is also produced at some springs on the south coast of Qishm opposite Hangam island. Industries can hardly be said to exist, with the exception perhaps of ship-building, which is carried on to a limited extent at Lingeh. This port also sends its quota of boats to the Bahrain pearl fisheries, which are open to the whole maritime population of the Gulf. Military .—In 1910 it was reported that '972 arms, including Mauser pistols, had been landed in the Lingeh district, and in 1911 about 2,760 rifles were landed. There is a ready sale for good arms among the Arab tribes of Laristan, though some of the rifles imported by Laris and Ivazis find their way to Yazd into the hands of Afghans trading with that place. Many Afghans also come to Lingeh, but more of them go to Lar, where the market of arms appears to be situated. Harbours .—The principal harbours and anchorages of Laristan, begin ning at the east, are :—Qishm, Hanjam, Basidu, Jazirat Tunb, Jazirat Abu Musa Kung (the site of the old Dutch establishment), Lingeh, Mughu, Charak bay, Qais, Jizzeh, Qalat-ul-MIbaid, Chiru, Hindarabl island, Bandar Basitin, Shaikh Shu’aib island and Shitvar islet, Shiyu, and Bandar Bidkhun, details regarding each of which will be found under their respective headings.LA R—LAS 636 The chief sea-port of ^Laristan is Lingeh, the value of the exports and imports at this port amounting in 1904 to £248 ; 956 and £307,690, respec tively, but the greater part of the goods represented by these figures is consigned from, or to, places beyond the limits of the province, or is tran shipped here to other ports. Much of the sea-borne trade of the province is, however, carried on through Bandar ^ Abb as, owing to the superiority of the roads from that port to the interior. Communications. —The three main lines of communication from the coast to the north are from Lingeh to Yazd via Lar and Darab ; from Lingeh to Yazd Furg ; and from Mughu bay to Shiraz via Lar .; but there is no great caravan traffic over any of these routes. The principal road running east and west is that from Bandar 'Abbas to Bushire, which passes through the oentre of the province. Further particulars will be found in “ Routes in Persia—Yol. III.' Camels and donkeys are, as usual in Persia, the chief means of transport. There is no telegraphic communication throughout Laristan.— (Kinneir — Butcher, 1888 — Vaughan, 18 ( )0 — Curzon, 1892 — Napier, 1900 — Chirol, 1903.) LARYARI (?)— Lat. Long. Elev.

They number about 300 families (1911). During the summer months they live in tents, but remain near their houses, which they inhabit In winter. Their chief villages are Abadeh-i-Tashk, and Kushkak (latitude 29° 43', longitude 53° 50'). The latter village has 70 families of Lashanis. They are notorious brigands and their depredations extend to Murghab, Yazd and Kirman as well as to the Bushire-Shiraz road They are tenants of Mushir-ud-Dauleh. Their halantars are Nasrullah Khan and Akbar Khan both living at Abadeh-i-Tashk.— (Wilson, 1906) LASIIKAR (Ab-i) vide CHASMEH-I-RAUGIIANI.LAS—LAV 637 LASHTAGHAN— Lat.

It lies about f mile south of the track in a green, grassy plain, and consists of about half a dozen huts. The inhabitants, who number about 30 and are Sunnis, cultivate dates for a livelihood. Close to the road is a caravanserai with two wells and two cisterns full of water, and south of this are date-groves which extend for at least 2 miles along’the eastern bank of the Shur river, and which are surrounded by high earth bands, forming redoubt-like enclosures. No supplies are procurable, but camel-grazing is plentiful and fuel is obtained from the date-trees. Drinkable water is said to be found 25 feet below the surface.— [Butcher, April 1888 — Shakespea'r, 1905.) LATlFl— Lat. Long. Elev.

A village in the Dashti district of Ears 12 miles south of Khurmuj town. It contains a fort, about 10 mat huts scattered round the fort, «i water mill and a garden of fruit-trees producing limes, pomegranates and dates. The fort is merely a stone wall, 12 feet high, enclosing a square courtyard, and has turrets at two of the corners. Supplies are very limited. Good and plentiful water is available, being led by open conduits from the hills on the east. A considerable quantity of kundr bush in the valley 1^ miles to the south, furnishes a supply of fuel. There is good grazing and a good camping-ground, but the latter is commanded by the hills on either side of the valley. Lavar is the 4th stage on the route from Bushire to Bandar 'Abbas.

LINGENH on LINJEH (District) — A district of the Persian coast the southernmost within the Persian Gulf, interposed between the Shibkuh district on the west and the Kkamn poition of the Bastak district on the east.i» 630 LIN—LIN Limits. —On the east and south the Lingeh district is bounded by the sea; on the west by a line which runs inland in a northerly direction from the coast between Ruvvan and Mughu. The northern border is constituted by the great maritime range, described in the article on the Shibkcdr district, which, after passing behind Lingeh, terminates in the sea a few .miles north of the eastern end of Qishm Island. Lingeh district has thus a length from west to east of about 40 miles, and its maximum breadth between the mountains and the sea, a little to the west of Lingeh town, is about 25 miles. The island of Siri is attached for administrative purposes to the Lingeh district. The bulk of the district is a plain, slightly elevated about sea-level, of which the centre is occupied by a great salt-marsh called Mnhrakun, 20 miles long from west to east and 10 miles in breadth. The plain has, as it were, a raised rim along the sea coast; this rim falls somewhat steeply to the marsh, but on the outer side it declines to the seashore as a barren, sloping glacis. The ordinary height of this barrier between coast and interior is only 200 to 400 feet, but 10 miles north-east of Lingeh town, and in Jabal Bustaneh, 10 miles west of the same place, it rises in hills havirg the respectable elevation of 1,017 and 1,800 feet, respectively. With the exception of the highest part of the former, which is of light colour and jagged outline, these two hills present a generally dark and volcanic appear ance. The rainfall in the Lingeh district is slight and the climate is cooler, healthier, and pleasanter than that of Bandar ^Abbas. Population. —The .people of the district are principally Persians and of various tribes, and trace their origin to Lar, Gallehdar and other places in the interior; Arab tribes, however, occur, such as the A1 ’Ali and Marzuqi, who are noticed in the article oh the Shlbkuh district. Outside the town's of Lingeh and Kung and Ruvvan, which are the principal places in the district and are separately described, the population is almost entirely Sunnis of the ShafiT school. The total population of the Lingeh district, including Lingeh town and Siri island, is probably about 20,000 souls. On the coast pearl-diving, sea-fishing and the carrying trade are the chief occupations, except in Lingeh town where the inhabitants depend mainly on foreign trade. Away from the sea the population is agricultural and pastoral. Dates are the chief crop, and the palms in the Lingeh district are estimated at about 180,000. Agriculture and trade and shipping. —Trade is concentrated in Lingeh town, vide the article in which it is described. This district possesses about 143 vessels of sea-going types and about 222 of smaller size ; of the former 57 are pearl boats which cross the Gulf in the season to work on the Arabian side. Supplies and transport. —Supplies, except at the larger places, are not abundant. A\ ater is obtained from reservoirs and wells; the latter are ordinarily from 5 to 8 fathoms in depth. Transport. —Very large numbers of donkeys available. They are ex tremely handy, and would be useful for mounted infantry. They do greatI LIN—LIN 610 distances without trouble. Camels also are used, but they are not seen in large numbers and are of inferior quality. Occasional coolies are difficult to obtain, except at absurd prices, though many are in regular employment in connection with merchandise and shipping. Routes .—Lingeh town is connected with Mughu by a coast route passable for all arms, and with Bastak (and so with Lar) by a route which up to the border of the Lingeh district is described as passable for all arms, although its course lies across the salt marsh. The Muhrakun salt marsh, which lies on the latter route, is traversable by animals in summer, but in winter must be either ridden or crossed in boats. There is also a coast route to Khamir but its character beyond Kung is uncertain and at Pulghar, between 25 and 60 miles from Lingeh town, it certainly becomes impassable at high tide in consequence of the sea rising against the side of the hill. Administration .—The Lingeh district is subject to the Governor of the Gulf Ports who has his headquarters at Bushire town; his local represent ative is a Deputy Governor, very frequently changed, who is responsible for the payment at Bushire of about 150,000 krdns annually as revenue. This, revenue is assessed throughout the district upon date-groves and other cultivation—-on the coast upon boats also; and in Lingeh town warehouses and other places of business are taxed, and men and animals entering the place are laid under contribution by means of tolls. The general administration and collection of land-revenue are conducted by the Deputy Governor through the Kalantar, or headman of Lingeh town, and the Katkhudas of villages. Criminal justice there is none, and the only form of civil justice is that dispensed by the ecclesiastical authorities. The power of the Deputy Governor is supported by a military detachment of 14 infantry and of 6 artillerymen only, with 2 old muzzle-loading smooth-bore guns; but there are about 200 armed citizens of Lingeh town, who can be called together for the defence of the place in an emergency. The Imperial Persian Customs have an important station in charge of a European at Lingeh, and others of less importance at Bustaneh, Kung, Band Mffiallim and Birkeh Sillin. Their annual receipts are distinct from the general revenue of 130,000 krdns, for which the sub-governor is liable, and amount tb about 500,000 hdns. t . .p . * ~t 'i* Name. P osition.

Good lime and mortar are prepared and exported to Lingeh town and to Trucial ’Oman. There is a post of the Persian Imperial Cus toms at Sirlin.

LINGEH (Town)—Lat. 26° 33' 5'; Long. 54° 53' 47'; Elev. A well-built and prosperous town of some 15,000 inhabitants, prosses- sing a fairly well-sheltered roadstead in which ships can anchor compara tively close to the shore. Derives its commercial importance from being a pearl market; a port which supplies to a great extent the markets of the province of Lar, and being a distributing centre for the Arab coast. Smuggling is notoriously more prevalent in the vicinity of Lar than in that of Bandar ’Abbas. It is situated about 96 miles west-south-west of Bandar ’Abbas, 88 miles north-north-west of Sharjah and a little over 300 miles south-east of Bushire town; the British station of Basidu on Qishm island lies about 25 miles to the east-north-east of it.647 LIN—LIN Lingeh is a well-built town, better built than Bandar ’Abbas. The to'WTi extends about a mile along the shore ; behind it are some date-plantations, and to the north-east is a detached grove about half-way on the road to Kung. The surroundings are extraordinarily arid, and the back-ground consists of an absolute desert rising gradually behind the town to a water shed, of which the somewhat prominent hills form the eastern and western extremities. There is an eastern suburb on the sea-face called Gharieh and one of the western quarters of the town is called Lingleh. One of the chief features of the place is a number of birkehs, or domed cisterns, which are scattered through the environs; these are circular reservoirs, 20 or 30 feet deep, for the storage of the water which in rainy weather 'comes down from the desert behind. Roadstead. usually anchor ^ to f miles from the landing-place and are able to do so in all weathers, no wind being so dangerous as to necessitate thair clearing out. An unlimited number of steamers of the British India type could anchor in the roadstead at one time and there are no fixed moorings for such vessels. Coast. —The coast is of a shelving nature and the beach sandy and un backed by cliffs. All ground in the vicinity of the sea is low-lying and sandy, with a gentle rise inland. Tides and currents. —The rise and fall of the tide is 10 feet and the dis tance between high-and low-water mark on the beach at spring-and neap- tides is 150 and r 90 yards, respectively. The tides do not in any way inter fere with landing from small boats and there are no dangerous currents. Entrance to harbour. —Here, as at Bandar ’Abbas, there is no harbour properly so called, but rather a huge roadstead, the entrance to which is quite unimpeded. Rilots. —There are a few Arab pilots who take charge of British India and Persian steamers proceeding to Bahrain, but they are not diplomaed. The British India Steamship Company retains for its own use exclusively the services of four such pilots. The local boatmen are not competent to act as pilots. Landing-places for troops. —Should it be deemed to be inexpedient to land troops opposite the town, they could be landed with almost equal facility at any point on the coast 5 miles west or 10 miles east of the town, as the shore is everywhere sandy and shelving and transports could approach to within 1 mile. Under normal conditions, the surf is a negligible quantity, and, only when a south-east gale is blowing, is it so heavy as to render landing from small boats really dangerous. Supplies would have to be carried from small boats through the surf. Some 20 and 30 buggalows of from 25 to 35 tons’ burthen are always available for the landing of cargo, etc., from steamers and there are also large numbers of smaller craft. Added to these, there are, in the non-pearling season, some 50 to 66 boats drawn up on the beach and these could, doubtless, be made available at a month’s notice. Landing by boats. —The length of shore available for landing troops and equipment is about 15 miles, and within this limit a sandy, shelving shore648 LIN—LIN 648 is everywhere to be met with. There is no periodical wind at any time of the year which would interrupt landing operations for certain hours of the day. In Lingeh itself there is always a large amount of timber which is used m the building of buggalows ami this could be employed m the constraet.on of temporary landing-stages, but there is no material suitable for the construction of light tramways. XT •r;/- c ImuIivq —There is one small wharf alongside to which large huS^cShigh tide. It is about 80 yards long and encloses what can be turned into a small dock m which to effect repairs to buggalows, otc Stones and materials from which to make cement are at all times available There are no lights on the wharf. Vessels approach to within i m iie of the landing-place. Goods arriving by steamer are tallied by Customs House tally-clerks at the time when they are delivered to the landing-contractor alongside the steamer and they are again checked when the Tandin^contraetor hands them over to the Hamal Basin of Customs at the laiidmg-place. There are no special arrangements for landing cattle, at the mnmgp usually left in a buggalow, placed as clos^to th^shore^s* possible at high tide, so 'that at low water, when the buo-galow is high and dry, they can walk ashoie. un Snnrl linhter-men —The coolies employed in unloading vessels are m„S Mnatfa Cd^Abbasi,, K»dbari s , LLhis, Baluchis and Khuns, Td in the 'old season number about 200, but in the hot weather labour and m tne com sc CO olies go to Mmab, and m this season 4 ToL ” S c„ ntsTs n a y df/stoAlnd fhours at night as a nighCs worln nours or ovei cuui j . t&gt; i f i av f r0 m sunrise to sunset, with The usual wage for a coolie is ite. 1 per nay 110 m suxm , food from the s ‘^“ er | 5 '^'food from the stTmer!'’ When there Fs e k d a eUndf a or a cIoi esLh wages fluctuate from annas 8 to annas 12 pd^; The coolies are not —eed ^ tnwhom theyworhwrth. ^The principal knding-contr^or^mph T d 1 ^ ^ ls0 { 10 i ds the Company's Steamship Company, « M-rhamumilTbran ^ to the i anding . tally-clerks and am again contractor alongsi . i, „ +he landing-contractor to the checked when landed _ and hanaed ^ J Customs a ud Hamal Bashi (the receiving agent, acting on behair the consignees). ‘ Store depots .—^There are a number of godowns J V tarpaulins should, tiiere- fore, be provided for.

There is no grazing for flocks in the immediate vicinity of Lingeh; in a year of good rain camels bring in grass from distances varying from 3 to 9 miles. Climate. —The climate of the port is comparatively good and certainly better than that of any other Persian port in the Gulf. Extremes of heat and cold are rarely experienced, and the days are few in winter or summer, on which the cold or heat is unpleasant. Normally, rain falls in the period from November to February, but the rainfall varies considerably and it is impossible to say on how many days of the year rain will occur. There are no prevailing winds. Grazing and fodder.—\s no gr&amp;vAnv ground in the vicinity of the landing-place and in the whole district it is very scarce. Grass, kah (the local name for chopped straw), etc., is stored by the local people in godowns as a reserve against bad times. In a good year 150,QUO maunds of kah and about 30,000 rolls (1 roll= 2 lbs. approx.) of grass are obtainable, which amount is about sufficient for the needs of the local animals. In bad years kah and grass are imported from Bandar Dilam, Bandar Big and other up- Gulf Ports, Fuel .—There are no coal stores and in the absence of local steamers the want of coal is not felt. Firewood is always scarce in the town and is brought from Qishm Island, the Batineh Coast of 'Oman and the mangrove swamps in the Clarence Straits; the latter is sold at a rate varying from Bs. 4^ to Bs. 6 per 100 maunds, while that brought from the mountains is sold at a rate from Bs. 7 to Bs. 8 per 100 maunds. Transport resources. — Donkeys are the usual transport animals, but there are also a few camels; mules are only seen at rare intervals. Cara vans come to the town very rarely, and transport animals are not exposed for sale. Some 30 or 40 camels are imported annually from 'Oman or Katr to meet local requirements. Donkeys are imported from Bahrain, Katr and the Batineh, but those present are never sufficient for the needs of the local community, and owners will not sell their animals except at exorbi- tant rates. A camel-load varies from 30 to 50 maunds, and that of a donkey from 20 to 24 maunds. There is a skin disease common among camels known as geri from which all their fur comes off. Caravans start at 3 hours before sunset. Animals are watered in the hot season in the early morning and again at midday and camels once a day in the hot season and once every other day in the cold weather. The cold is not sufficiently intense to make clothing for the animals a necessity, but higher up, in Fars, jhools are used. The transport-drivers do not give much care to their animals. One driver has from 10 to 25 animals in his charge, but there is no fixed custom in this respect. There are no regular transport agents in Lingeh. Camping-ground for troops .—The best site on which to encamp troops is situated £ mile east of the landing-place and on the outskirts of the town. It is reached by proceeding along the sea-front or by way of the narrow little streets common to Persian towns. This site has an area of aboutLIN—LIN 650 4 square miles and on it are situated the large water brikehs from which the drinking water is obtained. The ground consists for the most part of hard sand, but in wet weather it would become somewhat of a quagmire. The population at present amounts to 12,000 souls and is of a highly •composite character. The basis is Arab and is supposed to consist chiefly of immigrants from Trucial •’Oman, but Bahrain has contributed a quota of Al Bu Samait, 'Utub and Dawasir, and there are also immigrants from Kangan. The remainder are mostly Persians from the neighbourhoods of Bastak and Lar. The medley is completed by a considerable Negro admixture. The majority of the inhabitants is Sunnis or Vahhabis : less than £ are Shiahs The following table will give an idea of the compos ition of the town souls. Arabs . . 5,000 Persians .......... 5,000 Africans . . . . . . . . . . 1,500 Khwajas ........... 24 Hindus .......... 16 Europeans ......... 3 Though the town is large its defensive strength is small. It has a very irregular outline though on the north-north-west and north-east there are some straight faces and walls useful for defence. The small round mud forts are mostly well placed, but much of the immediate front is broken up by nullahs deep enough to conceal attackers. Two broad, sandy nullahs mark the eastern and western limits of the the town proper. The outskirts of the town to the east are screened by palm-trees. There is an extremely good line of observation and resistance from about two miles north-west of the town to one mile north-east. Only about one per cent of the fighting men is credited with the possession of arms, and most of these, it is to be feared, are in undesirable hands. As a rule arms are not produced except on the incitement of Mullas, and then not without the existence of personal interests to be served, or the issue of injunctions by the Governor. Trade. —Lingeh was until recently a trade emporium serving a large and important area. As a general centre for the collection and export of pearls it rivalled even Bahrain. As a point for the distribution of foreign goods not only the adjacent districts of Persia, but also the ports of Trucial ^Oman and Qatr, and even, to some extent, those of the Batinoh coast of ^Oman and of Bahrain were numbered among its clients. But the rigorous regime of the reformed Persian Customs has set a term, at least for the present, to its prosperity; and the towns of Trucial '’Oman, formerly among its leading constituents, are now turning to Dibai, which the establishment of direct steam communication with India and the absencettttO Wm tttj**”*” ' ’ | 651 LIN—LIN of official harassment have at length enabled to compete with Lingeh Upon favourable terms. It is estimated that goods imported direct at Dibai can be sold there 10 per cent cheaper than similar goods imported through Lingeh. To save themselves from utter ruin most of the leading merchants of Lingeh have established agencies in Trucial 'Oman by means of which they hope to retain a part of their former business. It seems probable that unless the Persian Grovernment takes steps to remove the causes of this decline Lingeh will shortly be reduced to the position of a merely local port. The tract of which the trade is naturally dependent on Lingeh lies to the north-west of it, including Bastak and Lar, and not extending beyond Jehrum, a distance of little over 150 miles. The actual number of shops in Lingeh is 445 and of other business premises 28; about 250 of the shops sell cloth and 250 provisions. Exports from Lingeh by sea consist of carpets, rose-buds, flax-seed, tobacco, gum-tragacanth, gum-arabic, asafoetida and a little diied fruit from Jehrum, Ishkanan, Taraikmeh arid Gallelidar ; they are shipped chiefly to Indian and Turkish ports, but some of the asafcetida, gum-tragacanth and gum-arabic goes direct to the United Kingdom. Mother-of-peai 1 shells are despatched to London and Hamburg, as well as to India. Imports, except a certain quantity of piece-goods which is received direct from England and Germany, are all from India; the principal are rice, wheat, barley, gli, sugar, loaf-sugar, sugar-candy, spices, linen, silk and cloth of all sorts- It is not generally realised how large a proportion of the trade of Lingeh is taken by India. From the last consular report it appears that India supplied 75 per cent of the imports, phis 13 per cent shown as emanating from 'Oman, and took 48 per cent of the exports, though the latter con sisted almost entirely of pearls and specie. The report in question deals with the year 1911-12, and the effect of the prevailing anarchy in Southern Persia may be traced in the almost complete stagnation of trade with the interior. Trade is now practically confined to Lingeh itself and outlying villages on the coast, Dibai on the Arab coast and 'Oman. Lingeh is for tunate in having these outlets where the robber and the almost equally extortionate road guard cannot pursue their nefarious trade, and the result is seen in a small improvement in the trade figures for the year, imports having- increased by nearly £40,000 since the preceding year. The merchants of Lingeh, however, do not view the situation with equanimity, and many of these are taking to illicit traffic in rifles, coffee and tea, and the British Consul (Mr. R. H. New) suggests that they devote some of the profits of this smuggling to ordinary trade for the sake of appearances and prestige thereby helping to increase the volume of imports. The Customs officers appear quite powerless to check smuggling. They maintain a steam launch for patrolling purposes, but this one vessel cannot pretend to main tain an efficient guard over 250 miles of coast. Coffee offers a very favour able field for the smugglers' operations. The consumption among the Arab section of the population is considerable, amounting to 18 or 20 tons per annum, and practically the whole of this amount must be smug gled into the country. The only import of coffee recorded in the CustomsLIN—LIN 652 returns is one consignment of two bags (five cwts.) which represents a snc- ■cessful haul by the Customs’ launch. The total consumption of tea is estimated at about 10 tons, and this is likewise mainly imported by illicit means, as both tea and coifee carry a prohibitive duty. Extensive smug gling also goes on in connection with the export of pearls, which are the principal product of the district. As they are so easy to conceal it is not surprising that large quantities of pearls are secretly exported without paying the I per cent export duty or the ^ per cent freight to India. The result is that the exports of pearls for the year are officially valued at £40,390, about half that of the former year, while the actual value of the exports is estimated by the Consul at £350,000. The carrying trade of Lingeh, in the past considerable, is not unlikely to fall off in the future in sympathy with the general export and import business. At the present time 2 sailing barques, 19 baghlahs and 14 .ghunchahs and sambuqs belong to the port, besides 22 lighters; the last are sambuqs, baqdreqs and jolly-boats. This local shipping affords employment to about 740 persons. Occupations other than trade. —The principal resource of Lingeh, apart from “commerce and navigation, is the pearl-fishery: there are about 30 pearl-boats of sizes (sambuqs, latils and baqdrehs). The sea-fisheries are of some value and employ 10 baqdrehs, 17 shu’ais and 20 haris and varjis. Date-culture is of some importance, but other cultivation is insignificant in consequence of the paucity of the means of irrigation. There are some mechanics and artisans and Lingeh is said to be the best place in the Gulf to have ironwork made or necessary repairs to ships executed though the workmanship is rude. The standard of weight is a local man, equal to 9 lbs. English, and the standard of length a zar’ of 38 English inches. The currency is that of Persia, but the Indian rupee, Maria Theresa dollar, Turkish lira, and English .sovereign also circulate. Communications, transport and supplies. —Land communications and land transport are dealt with in the article on Lingeh district, and the nature of the sea communications may be gauged by the remarks on shipping above. The water of Lingeh is generally abundant, and -cattle, poultry, vegetables, rice, flour and firewood are available in some quantity. Atta and ghi are also procurable locally. Water is scarce, •as rain sometimes fails. The usual source of supply is birkehs, namely, broad wells about 20—40 feet deep ‘covered by domed roofs. These abound in the town and outskirts, but in April 1912 they were nearly all dry. One about 2 miles south-wert of the town and others ll miles in the same direction still contained water at that time. In addition to birkehs there are narrow deep wells without covering, usually in groups of 5 or 6 , 'dotted about the town. Admiiiistration.^lAngeh, as one of the Gulf Ports, is subject to the Governor of that division, but is administered by a local Deputy Governor. That nature of his administration is described in the article on Lingeh district. The Imperial Persian Customs have a post here, and there is a small Persian garrison, as already mentioned in the article on653 LIN—LIR Lingeh district; besides these about 200 armed citizens can be mustered by order of the Deputy Governor, for the defence of the town.— (Craufnrd, 1010 .) A British Vice-Consul was appointed to Lingeh in 1910. The Consulate is a Persian house on the outskirts of the town, and is practically inde fensible against any organised attack.— {Lorimer, 1906.) LINJAN— One of the nine buluks of the province of Isfahan; it extends on both sides of the Zindeh Rud as far as the frontier of Chehar Mahal, 50 miles west of Isfahan. It is 7 miles long and 40 miles in width, and is well- watered by the river or canals from it. It is divided into upper and lower Linjan by the Gav Piseh pass. There are computed to be 300 to 400 villages in the district, which, for Persia, is fairly populous. Villages situated on the rivers are called Cham. The district is fertile, growing melons celebrated throughout Persia; it supplies the whole of Central Persia with rice. It is sub-divided into the following 5 parishes, Linjalanj, Gargan, Ushturjan, Ashian and Ai Diighmish.— {Schindler.)

From the sea it extends about 16 miles to the top of the mountain range which separates it from the Dareh-Shuri section of the Qashqai tribe on the east, and from the Zaidan district, and the Agha Jari tribe about the Tang-i-Astaki on the- west. As much of the land as is not salt is entirely given over to culti vation. Two ports : Khur Imam Husain or Khur Sini and Bandar Dllam. — {Clack, 1910.)

Liravi extends along the Persian Gulf from a point about 7 miles north of Bandar Dilam to Sabz Pushan 31 miles south-south-east of that place, and is bounded inland by a low, maritime range which, at the northern end of the district, is about 6 , and at the south end about 18, miles from the sea; this range rises, behind Bandar Dilam, to a height of about 1,000 feet. P hysicab characteristics. —The principal points on the coast are Ras-ut- Tanb, or lanub, 8 miles south of Bandar Dilam, a low, sandy point; Khur Lailatain, a small creek 1 mile south-east of Ras-ut-Tanb; Khur Sini, an other small creek with deep water inside, 8 miles south-south-east of khur Lailatain, linally Sabz Pufhan, a slighly projecting, rocky point which has a small water-course on the south of it, and is itself 18 miles south-south-easto? Khur Sini. The most striking object in the interior of the district is Jabal Bang, or Kuh-i-Bang, an isolated group of hills rising to a point 1,000 feet high, at a distance of 24 miles south-south-east from Bandar Dilam and 3 miles from the coast; these hills stretch for 12 miles parallel to the coast, are precipitous on the seaward -side and contain salt and gypsum. Apart from Jabal Bang and the hills which form the inland boundary, the whole district is low and consists of plains, sometimes grassy, with occasional exposures of light-grey sandstone. The heat of summer is, it is said, not excessive; and the winter resembles that of Bushire. Water everywhere is from wells. The Liravi coast south of Ras-ut-Tanb can ordinarily be approached to within 1 mile by vessels of moderate size. Population .—The fixed inhabitants of Liravi are of mixed Lur and Arab blood, and do not fall under any well-known tribal denominations. Their number is probably about 6,000 souls, inclusive of the inhabitants of Bandar Dilam {q.v.) and its dependent villages. The people are all Shi'ahs unless, as is reported, there are a few Babis at Shahr Yiran. They are qmiet and free from fanaticism and engaged for the most part in agriculture or sea faring occupations. Martini rifles are numerous, there being, it is said, three rifles on the average to every two houses. Dwellings outside of Bandar Dilam are nearly all huts. During the six winter months the district is visited by the Daleh Shuli and Kashkuli, Iliat nomadic hill tribes whose summer quarters are in the mountainous locality, Blbi Ilekimeh, 30 or 40 miles inland from the coast. Tribally, the Khans of Liravi are of the same family as the Khans of Haiat Daud and Rudhilleh, whose districts extend up to Bushire. Haydar Khan of Haiat Daud (Bandar Rig) is in charge of their political affairs. In fact, all these districts are ruled as one entity (and ruled remarkably well—Europeans can travel, day or night, in security everywhere in these districts). Dilam, the port of Liravi, is as much a dependency of Bushire as Bandar Rig. Agriculture and trade. —Wheat, barley, dates and tobacco are the chief products, and of the first two a certain surplus is ordinarily available for export. Cattle, sheep and goats are fairly numerous. The exports and imports are those described in the article on Bandar Dilam. There is no internal trade. Currency, weights and measures are the same as those of Bandar Dilam, except the gaz, or yard, which is 2 inches less than that of Bushire. Transport and communications .—Liravi is believed to possess about 200 horses, 100 camels and 2,000 donkeys. The best known route is one which traverses the districts longitudinally from Shahr Viran to Kunai ku, at some distance from the coast; the marching by this is easy and there are numerous convenient halting-places. Administratively, its position is an anomaly. Originally governed from Bushire under a Deputy of the Arab Shaikhs of Bushire, Shaikhs Nasr and Abdur Rasul, and appertaining, like Haiat Daud, to the Government of Bushire, it was overrun and captured by a progenitor of the present Kalantar of Behbehan about 1840, as were also the other coastal districts right up to Bushire. Bushire itself would have shared the same fate if it had not been for the death of Muhammad Shah.G55 LTR-LlR From that time, Liravi remained nominally annexed to Behbehan, itself a sub-Government of Pars, and tribute was exacted by the Prince Governor of Pars in his yearly tours along the coast about 1870. In 1887, however, Bandar Dilam, the port of Liravi, and the lands around, were placed under the Government of the Gulf Ports just created, and handed over to the Khans of Haiat Daud. Before or about 1900 the district itself was granted by the Shah as a fief to Haji Saiyid Said-us- Sultaneh, who became Governor of the Gulf Ports for a short time in 1907. He farms the district to the Khans of Liravi for 8,750 tomans annually. During all these years of disorder, when districts around have paid no “ Maliyat ”, the Khans of Liravi have, on the advice of their near relatives, the Khans of Haiat Daud, paid their revenue regularly, through the Imperial Bank of Persia at Bushire, in order to keep on the right side of Govern ment, and give no cause for Government interference in their tribal matters. Prom the time of the district becoming a private fief till Amir Mujahid’s advent no Governor of Behbehan had had right or reason to interfere in the affairs of the district. The owner of Liravi, Haji Saiyid Said-us-Sultaneh, after his Government of the Gulf Ports in 1907, was requested by the Khans of Liravi to have the district placed under the Government of the Gulf Ports and is under stood to have begun negotiations iu Tehran with that object. This is indeed the logical solution and the one best calculated to serve Persian and British Government interests; and prevent further Bakhtiari aggres sions. British interests demand it, because it would be a source of constant friction and inconvenience to have a district, uniform with and between ^Arabistan on the north, and the Gulf Ports districts on the south, subject neither to the one Government nor to the other.

LUR-I-BUZURG— This term, like Lur-i-Kuchak, (q.v.) is now almost extinct. It was for merly used to denote the country inhabited by Lurs beyond the boundaries of Luristan, and includes in consequence the Bakhtiari country, and the whole of Ears. It was never an administrative province, the Bakhtiari Haft Lang in 1841 being under Burujird, the Kuhgalu under Behbehan, and the Qashqai under the Governor General of Ears at Shiraz, who is now in charge of both the last-named tribes, as Behbehan is within Ears.— (Wilson, 1911.) LUR-I-KOCHAK— ' This term, now obsolete, denotes the province of Luristan. It was for merly divided into Gulak, which included 'Amleh and Bala Gariweh, and Selewerzi, which included Dilfan and Silsileh, but these divisions are now unknown.— (Wilson, 1911.) LURISTAN— Eorming one of its western boundaries with Turkish Arabia, it shares with Ardalan the distinction of being the most mountainous province of Persia. Locally, the term Luristan has not the wide significance attached to it by some geographers; and its use is restricted to indicate the territory nominally under the administration of the Governor of Luristan. But as such a description would place the region of Pusht-i-Kuh outside of its limits, for the sake of convenience, as well as for the close ties which knit that district to the Pish Kuh, it is preferable to consider the two regions as a whole. Boundaries.' —In this sense, therefore, its boundaries may be read as fol lows :—On the north it marches with the province of Kirmanshah from a point some 35 miles south of Khaniqln, more or less identical with the 34° of latitude, until it makes a bend south-eastwards to Hulilan and crosses the Kara Su river. Thence it strikes north-eastwards along the left bank of that river until its junction with the Gam Aslab, and works up the left bank of the latter stream, until it strikes the rugged mountain range which divides the district of Khava from the valley of Nihavand and later- thatLUR—LUR 658 of Sllakhur. On the east its boundary is the latter valley, the district of Farklan and the Bakhtiari country. On the south it is again the Bakh- tlarl country, the Ab-i-Diz, and the plains of Northern ’Arabistan. Finally, on the west its boundary from MazraM-Salihabad, 10 miles north-west of Dizful, is conterminous with the undemarcated Turco-Persian frontier; which may be said to run along the foot of the Hamrin mountains, flanking the plain on which are found the tents of the Ban! Lam, and beyond the great waterway of the Tigris, as far as Mandall, and thence northward to meet the 34° of latitude once more. Physical Geography .—'By this definition of its boundaries^ it is observed that the territory ruled over by the Bakhtiari Khan is considered outside the limits of this province : and warrants the discarding of such distinctions as Lur-i-Buzurg (Bakhtiari) and Lur-i-Kuchak (Luristan), which still, however, have their local significance. Luristan, as above defined, is divided into two districts. That portion to the south and west of the lofty range of the Kabir Kuh is known as Pusht-i-Kuh : while the regions to the north and east of this range, which, as far as it is affected by the jurisdiction of the Persian Governor may be taken to represent Luristan proper, is known as Pish Kuh. Mountains and valleys. —Both districts are a mass of, for the most part, lofty and rugged mountain ranges running in parallel lines in a south-east erly direction: with a superficial area of some 19,500 square miles, the ancient title of Zagros was, it would seem, applicable to at least the whole of this mountainous tract, rather than to any particular one of its ranges : and may even have included the length and breadth of the mountainous country between Urumieh and ^Arabistan. The mountain ranges of this province, the highest peaks of which are perpetually snowclad, reaching to an elevation of some 15,000 feet above sea-level, are interspersed with fertile valleys, which are well watered and possess a generous soil. In them considerable crops of wheat and barley are raised, and they afford excellent pasture lands for sheep and cattle. Pasture lands and plains .—To the south-west, on the lower slopes of the mountains, are found the principal grazing-grounds merging with the plains of Northern ’Arabistan to the west of the Ab-i-Diz; while the only plains of any extent within the true boundaries of Luristan are those of Silakhur, Alishtar and Khurramabad. The first named, which is a broad valley lather than a plain, extends from the town of Burujird in a south-easterly direction for some 35 miles and has a breadth varying from 5 to 10 miles: that of Alishtar has a length and depth of some 12 miles : while the plain of Khurramabad is some 16 miles in length, with a depth of about 8 miles. Woodlands and vegetation .—Speaking comparatively, the province of Luristan is extremely well-wooded, more particularly on the east, in the country of the tribes of the Bala Girieh. Oak trees, and in certain tracts its evergreen species, abound; these Us well as other species, grow to a good size on the eastern border, and become more stunted and dwarfed towards the west. Other kinds of trees are the ash, plane, elm, poplar, willow, beech and the walnut, found in profusion to the north and north-east; as well as all kinds of fruit trees, such as apple, peach, apricot, cherry, the pome- 3 A650 LUR—LUR eranate and the vine. But timber is little respected by the Lurs, who cut it down remorselessly and without any regard for the future. One ot tne principal sources of livelihood of the nomad tribesmen is from the buimng of charcoal for which they require the wood, as well as for fuel. 1 hen- woodlands also furnish them with considerable quantities of the Astraiagus species, from which they obtain a large amount of the valuable gum-traga- canth. Rivers. —Through the deep valleys formed by the often precipitous cliffs of the great mountain masses of limestone, and frequently cutting throug them at right angles, numerous rivers and streams force their way. the only two of any real importance are the Karkheh and the Ab-i-Biz; as they absorb most of the larger streams, which otherwise might claim some distinctive description of their own. The Karkheh has its earliest origin in the waters of the Kara Su and the Gam Asiab, both of which streams rise without the limits of Luristan itself. It chief tributaries, in order from the north, are the Ab-i-Dinavar to the Gam_ Aslab before its ^ junction with the Kara Su; and afterwards the Sar-i-Ab Niaz, the Ab-i-Chanareh, the Kashgan or Mudi&amp;n Rud, and the Ab-i-Zal. For a_considerable part of its course, and up to the point of its j’unction with the Ab-i-Zal, it is known as the Saimarreh river, and only after that point does it become the Km- kheh. For a full description of this river, vide this Gazetteer. The earliest source of the Ab-i-Diz is not far removed from the Gam Asiab branch of the Karkheh; this is the Ab-i-Darreh, which rises in the neighbourhood of Nihavand. Its principal tributaries are the Kamand Ab in the Silakhur valley, the Q.Ir Ab or Bala Rud, and the Ab-i-Sabz. By the time it reaches Dizfftl it has become a fine river, with a breadth in flood time of a quarter of a mile, and still carrying a fair volume of water in the dry season. But neither the Diz nor the Karkheh is navigable by the smallest boats_, at any part within the limits of Luristan. For a full description of the Ab-i- Diz, vide this Gazetteer. Towns and villages .—Khurramabad is the only place within the true limits of Luristan which has any pretensions to be called a town: and it is the residence of the Governor of Luristan. It has a fixed population of some thing under 10,000 souls. The town is situated in almost the centie of the Pish Kuh district, and commands the passes by which the^ principal tribes of Luristan are obliged to cross w^hen moving between their summer and wfinter quarters. The two important passes are the flang-i-Zagheh (to the east) and the Tang-i-Robat (to the north); and were not the towm situated as it is, it would be very difficult to retain any control on these tribes. In order to protect the town and surrounding villages, the Persian Government establishes a military camp every year at the foot of these passes at the time of the passage of the tribes. For a full description of Khurramabed, vide this Gazetteer. Burujird, which is situated at the head of the Silakhur valley, and is the chief town of the district of the same name, supplies Luristan with the greater portion of its dry goods, such as cotton and woollen materials, glassware, lamps, cutlery, footwear, leather, etc.; and should not be left entirely out of notice in a description of this province. And, in the same connection, mention must be made of Dizful; which would doubtlessLUR—LUR 660 supply the wants of the province to a much greater extent and on far better terms than does Burujird at the present time, but for the unfortunate state of the country towards its southern limits, which precludes the entry of any caravans from that direction. In regard to the villages of Luristan, beyond the few hamlets in the immediate neighbourhood of Khurramabad and those mentioned in the detailed notices of the various tribes below, they are hardly worthy of con sideration. There is practically no settled population in Luristan : nearly the whole of it living in their black goatVhair tents, with which they wander unceasingly over their recognised tribal grazing-grounds. Climate .—The climate of Luristan, owing to the great differences in elevation, varies considerably; and, as in the adjoining Bakhtiari country, its inhabitants can accommodate themselves almost according to their inclination. During most months of the year the climate is one generally of a temperate zone, tempered by a somewhat excessive cold in the higher altitudes in midwinter and severe heat in the lower valleys in mid-summer. But the latter are practically deserted at this period; while the greater number of the Illats (nomads) abandon in the winter time the higher ground (their ydlldqs or summer quarters), for the plains of Silakhur or Dizful, which constitute their qishldq or winter quarters. Language .—In general terms the language of Luristan may be said to be Persian, tempered by the Lur, dialect. This is a mixture of Persian and Arabic, the result of the close connection with the many Arab tribes that overlap or encroach upon this region. The most notable divergences from modern Persian are found in the Lakl dialects spoken by some of the Dilfan tribes. Rawlinson says that the language of the Lurs is from the old Farsi, which was coeval with, but distinct from, the Pehlvi tongue in the time of the Sassanian kings. Ethnology and History .—Who are the Lurs and whence they came is one of the unsolved riddles of history. They appear to belong to the same ethnical group as the Kurds, their neighbours to the north : tjiough they consider it an insult to be confounded with them, and call them Leks. Most writers agree that they are of aboriginal, old Aryan, or Iranian stock, who preceded Arabs, Turks and Tartars in the land : and that they have lived for centuries in their present habitat. The expression Lur is used by modern Persians as a synonym for a rude or depredatory person, while the word ‘ Fail! ’ means a rebel. The Lurs may be conveniently classified under four heads, thus :— (r) Fail! Lurs, indicating the servants or followers of the Vali of Pusht-i- Kuh, the first of whom rebelled against his master, as noted below. (ii) The Lurs of Pish Kuh. (Hi) The Bakhtiari, vide this Gazetteer. (iv) Other sections of Lurs, who have wandered farther afield, such as the Mamassani and Kuhgalu tribes. 3 a 266l LUR—LUR Between the twelfth and seventeenth centuries the province of Luristarf was ruled by a race of independent princes, who were called Atabegs. d'he last prince of this race was Shah Vardi Khan, who rebelled against Shah Abbas, early in the seventeenth century : and, on the arrival of the latter at Khurramabad to punish him, fled to the Pushtd-Kuh. Later, when Shah 'Abbas pushed forward to Saimarreh, Shah Vardi Khan retreated to Jangileh, the qishluq of the present A all, and there later lost his lire after much fighting. On his return to Khurramabad, Shah 'Abbas appointed one Hussain Khan, a servant of the dead Vali and a traitor to him, as Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh; but retained the Pish Kuh district under the direct management of a Persian Governor, with the seat of government at Khur- ramabad. This arrangement has obtained ever since with a varying degree of authority as far as the latter is concerned. This division of the eoi n'ry was the occasion for the importation into the province of a foreign tribe of some distinction. This was the Silsileh or Saisalih (Saiyid Salih). On his appointment as Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh, Husain Khan pointed out to his royal benefactor that, owing to the many enemies against whom he would have to contend, it would be impossible for him to preserve order without the assistance of foreign mercenaries. To aid him, there fore, the Silsileh tribe was drafted from the Mahi I)asht district of the Kirmanshah province into Luristan, and it was arranged that they, in con junction with the Dilfan tribe, should supply Husain Khan yearly with one hundred horsemen. Up to the end of the reign of Nadir Shah, these two tribes remained the dependents of the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh; but, with the upheaval which followed on the death of that monarch, they appropriated those lands on which they were located and became semi-independent like their neighbours, or at least only responsible thereafter to the authority of the Persian Governor. Tribal Divisions: Pish Kuh .—The district of Pish Kuh, or the province of Luristan proper, is divided up into four principal tribes, with numerous sub-divisions. They are the Silsileh, the Dilfan, the Bala Girieh and the Tihran. These divisions have no single chief like the Bakhtiari; and more often than not they are engaged in hostilities against one another. They are notorious for their plundering propensities, particularly the Silsileh and the Dilfan. Silsileh .—The habitat of this tribe is to the north of Khurramabad. ^Tliey are of Aiab origin and the circumstances under which they became incorporated with the Lurs are explained above. They occupy the plain of Alishtar whose ancient name was Alishakar, and the adjoining country. The plain itself is highly cultivated and productive of rice and opium in considerable quantities: it has a superficial area of some 150 square miles. The Silsileh have three important sub-divisions: the Hasanwand, the Yusuf wand and the Ouliwand, with a fourth, since become merged into the two former, known as the Amirwand. The Hasanwand are settled to the east of the Alishtar plain; and their lands are irrigated by the waters of the Sar-i-Ab-i-Khaman, and Sar-i-Ab- i-Narm or Zag, and Sar-i-Ab-i-Amarat. The two first named streams also water the country of the Bairanawand later on in their courses. Some families of the Ilasanwand are located within 12 miles of Khurramabad %LUR—LUR 662 near Saileh Burjeh and Sar-i-Ab-i-Talkh ; and even come into the town itself in the winter months. Various estimates are given of their numbers, as of their fighting strength, which may be taken to be some 4,200 tents of about 16,000 souls, with perhaps 3,000 men capable of bearing arms. They are divided into three sections or families, each under a chief as follows For their qishldq, or winter quarters, vide tabulated statement below. this district, being irrigated by the Sar-i-Ab-i-Khaman, the Sar-i-Ab-i- Chanareh, the Sar-i-Ab-i-Varmazmar and the Sar-i-Ab-i-Mumin. Formerly there were many fruit gardens on the banks of these streams, but these are now mostly out of cultivation. Most of the trees in the locality are walnut. This tribe formerly were reckoned at 2,000 tents, but many of them have emigrated to the Alvand of, Hamadan and to the villages of Malair, north of Burujird, and their numbers are now computed to be some 1,500 tents or 5,000 souls. Their principal chief (1905) is Riza Khan. For the qishldq of this tribe, vide tabulated statement below. The Quliwand occupy the country contiguous to the Alishtar plain on three sides, the north, west and south ; their lands being irrigated by the Sar-i-Ab-i-Sakki Samarteh, the Sar-i-Ab-i-Kalamkabad, the Sar-i-Ab-i- Mibu, the Tamartuz-i-Zindeh Rud. The Quliwand are sub-divided into three considerable branches, called the Murshid, the Falak-ud-Din and the Karim ^Ali. The Murshid are located in the country south of the Alishtar plain ; the Falak-ud-Din inhabit Khava and the higher regions north of the Alishtar plain ; while the Karim 'Ali are located on the mountain slopes dom troubling themselves to move to their qishldqs or winter quarters. These are in the Samarreh valley wliich is between 80 and 100 miles distant to the Family— Malik ’Ali Khan. Ju Sultan Khuda Yab. Farhajan. Malik ’AH Khan. Haji Khairullah. ’Abdul ’AH. Musa Khan.

The Yusufwand occupy the centre of the Alishtar plain between the Hasan wand and Qulivand ; their lands which are the most luxuriant in between the two. For some years past they have lived a quiet and comparatively sedentary life in the villages and gardens which they have built and have laid out; sel- south-west and to reach which they have to traverse the territory of theTihran. The Quliwand are credited with a total of some 3,700 tents or 15,000 souls amongst their several branches. _ They are also accounted to be the fools of Luristan and many amusing stories are told of their simj^icity and stupidity. Their principal chiefs are Husain Q,uli Khan, Mai Khan, Manushi Khan and Jani Khan. Dilfan .—Like the Silsileh, the Dilfan are of Arab origin. They are the descendants of the Abu Half, who, being near neighbours, encroached by degrees into Persian territory and became merged mto its people, and they have now become the most powerful confederacy in Luristan Then habita tions march with and overlap the lands of the Silsileh to an extent not easily determinable, though they may be generally described as lying within the Khava district. This district has a pleasanter and more temperate climate than that of Alishtar, and is watered by many good streams and springs. Thus the Sar-i- Ab-i-Niaz, which later waters the fields of the talak-ud- Din, flows through the Tang-i-Badavar by a westerly course. It is joined before entering this gorge by the Tirud, a stream coming from the direc tion of Harsin ; their joint waters later flowing into the Samarreh near Zardalal. Every spring in Khava has a plantation of willows about it. There are three important tribes among the Dilfan ; the Kakawand, the Itiawand, and the Mumianwand, which are in turn sub-divided into many branches. The general character of these tribes is nomadic, but their territory is more or less continuous, so that their migrations are a different affair to those of a tribe like the Sagwand. They are at present united under the strong and capable rule of the Fath-i-Sultan, Nazar ’AB Khan, of the Amrai tribe. The following family tree may be of interest in this connection :— Nusir. Barkhuda KhSn. Habibullah Khan. Fathubah Khan. Naziz 'All Khan Ja’afar Quli KhSn, Qasim. Bahar Khan. Fath-us-Sultan Sartip. {Died.) A eon. The Fath-us-Sultan fought for six or seven years for the supremacy with Q-asim Khan, the struggle only being terminated by the death of the latter, and the acceptance of the supremacy of the Fath-us-Sultan by his dead rival relatives. Various and widely different estimates (1904) have been made of the fighting strength of this tribe, and it has been put as highLUR—LUR 664 as 18,000 to 28,000 men ; while it is also stated on equally good authority to be 1,500 sowars and 1,500 tufangchis. It may be taken that the first estimate is excessive, and the more probably correct numbers are 2,000 tents or 10,000 souls. The Kakawand occupy the mountain ranges flanking the valley of Niha- vand, while their lands run westward and northwards towards Harsin and Sehura and southwards with certain interruptions as far as Hulilan, on the Kara Su river, where they have their qishlaqs. They obtain their livelihood from culfivation and their considerable flocks. Their number have been estimated at 2,000 tents or 10,000 souls in all. They are sub-divided into a number of small divisions, the principal of which are the Tajiwand or Aulad-i-Taj, 'Ali 'Ali or Aulad-i-’Ali, Ghaib Ghulam or Aulad-i-Ghulam, Zaid-Bahlramwand, Valadvand, Mikailvand, Faizivand, Jauzivand, Tari- kehvand and Muradvand, Jirgeh-i-Ahmadvand, Burburvand, Gashurivand, Mahaki, Pulivand, Muzaffarvand. The Itldwand are the neighbours of the Kakawand still farther to the south-east, and inhabit the localities known as Duliskan, Kangavari and Sarkashti ; the last-named being a spur of - the Safid Kuh. Owing to the high elevation upon which their habitations are fixed, they enjoy a most temperate climate, even in midsummer ; as well as all the fruits of such a climate, and which are, further, of excellent quality. Their lands are also well-wooded and afford luxuriant pasturage for their flocks. Their qishldq or winter quarters, near Hulilan, run into what is now reckoned to be within the jurisdiction of the province of Kirmanshah. The estimated number of this tribe was 4,000 tents, but of these only some 1,500 remain at the present day, the remainder having become merged with inhabitants of Kirmanshah or migrated to Kangavar or Khazal. The Itiawand are sub divided into numerous branches, formerly reckoned at 18 ; but of these there only remain at the present time (1905) the Aulad Qubad, the Dastna- wand, the Aulad Salih, the Aulad Murad, the Taliwand and the Khalawand. The most important by far of these divisions is the Aulad Qubad, who number some 4,000 souls and furnish a company for the Amrai regiment. The Mnmdwand inhabit the lands between and to the east of the Itiawand and Kakawand, extending as far east as the Silakhur valley. Their country consists of lofty mountains with elevated valleys, well watered by many streams from which they reap a plentiful harvest of wheat and barley. The mountain slopes are well-wooded and from these they obtain consider able quantities of charcoal besides collecting gum-tragacanth, for which they find a ready sale. In their kishldqs or winter quarters in the neighbour hood of the Madian Rud, distant some 55 miles to the south, they also grow a certain amount of opium. Their numbers are estimated at some 3,700 tents or about 15,000 souls. They are sub-divided into two branches, known as the Kaitul Nur 'Ali and the MirabegT. The prefix Kaitul signifies in the Lur dialect a servant. Half their tribe enjoys this privilege, namely, that of being considered servants' of the Khans, which exempts them from paying taxes other than those presumably drawn by the Khans themselves.«65 LUR—LUR The Kaitul Nur 'All have their tents in the high mountains south of Nihawand and bordering on that valley, while the Mirabegi are further east towards the Sllakhar plain. For the qishlaq of this tribe see the tabulated statement below. Other divisions of the Dilfan, which are not shown in the state ment, are the Razawand and Bijinawand. These tribes are mentioned by Layard and Rawlinson as having their tents respectively in Khava and Harassan : but they have either ceased to exist or have dwindled in import ance to an extent to make them hardly worthy of mention in the present day. The Ainehwand are mentioned by general Schindler, as being a branch of the Dilfan and as consisting of some 80 families inhabiting the iakht-i-Parl. Bcild Girteh .—This confederation, consisting of at least eight important tribes, which are in turn split up into many sub-divisions, inhabit the track known as Bala Girdnud, to the east of Khurramabad, stretching from the Silakhur valley as far as the southern limits of the province to the north of Dizful. Numerically the strongest of the four principal divi sions of the Lurs, if united in common cause, they would undoubtedly obtain a supremacy over the rest without much difficulty. But their general policy is not of a very advanced type, and its striking features are a more or less unremitting feud on the part of some of its branches with the Persian Government, general acts of hostility against each other, and strained relations with the Yali of Pusht-i-Kuh. They are united under no one ruling chief, neither have their own particular chiefs effective control over the tribsmen in some of its branches. The principal tribes of the Bala Girieh are the Kaid Rahmat, the Dalwand, the Bairanawand, the Sagwand, the Tulabi, the Papi, the Judaki, the Dirakwand ; while other independent but smaller branches are the Gurz Gurzi, the Gallandar, the RumlanI and the Ruh Ruk. The Raid Uahmat inhabit a tract to the south and east of Burujird, stretching across the Silakhur valley and including spurs of the Shahrab -and Gurin mountains ; their limit on the east being the Sazar which forms in part the boundary of the Bakhtiari country. They have rich lands which are well cultivated and watered by the Ab-i-Huru, a tribu tary of the Kashgan river, which separates their country to the south from the Dalwand. They own many flourishing villages, so that a great part of their population may be counted as Beh Nishins, or those who do not migrate to winter quarters. Besides cultivation, they rely on the collection of gum-tragacanth and charcoal burning as sources of liveli hood. They were formerly estimated at 1,500 families which in later years have become much dispersed amongst the villages of Silakhur, so that now their numbers are not reckoned at over 300 families of some 1,000 souls. For their yailaqs, vide tabulated statement below. The Dalwand occupy Zagheh, about 25 miles due east of Khurramabad, and its neighbourhood : their northern t limits being conterminous with the southern boundaries of the Kaid Rahmat. They own good lands with ample water on which they have every kind of cultivation except rice. Apart from the produce of their fields, they derive a good incomeLUR-LUR 606 from the'sale of gum-tragacanth and charcoal. They are in great part Deh Nishins who do not migrate to winter quarters. The village of .Zagheh is on the main caravan route and is of some size and importance. This tribe is reckoned at 1,000 families with a total of 5,000 souls. For their qishldqs, vide tabulated statement below. The Bairanawand inhabit the country to the west of the two last-named tribes, between them and the plain of Alishtar. The superficial area of their ydttdq, or summer quarter, is reckoned at some thing over 3,000 square miles. They own rich lands and many good villages besides being well armed. They are numerically the strongest tribe of Luristan : their numbers being estimated at some 6,000 families or 25,000 souls. While many families have joined them from other tribes, they have in turn lost others who have settled in Burujird or Silakhur. They have the reputa tion of being amongst the most turbulent and unruly of the tribes of Luris tan. The tribe generally has a very bad name and their chiefs are spoken of as uncivilised even in Luristan. In the time of Nadir Shah they were removed en bloc to Shiraz : but escaped and returned to Luristan. The qishlaq of this tribe is at Kilab or in the Pusht-i-Kuh district: the latter, which are on the borders of the Turkish frontier, they only visit after obtaining assurances of safety from the intervening tribesmen. The Bairanawand are divided into fifteen sub-divisions, vide tabulated statement below. The two principal chiefs of the tribe are Ma Rahim Khan and Quli Khan, between whom enmity exists. The former is on good terms with the Fath-us-Sultan (head of the Dilfan) who has endeavoured to reconcile the two. The Sagwand occupy the country to the south-east of and in the near neighbourhood of Khurramabad, and contiguous to the lands of the Dal- wand to the north. Their most important and productive tract is ^Abistar. The climate of this region is temperate, except for a few months in the winter. In the spring they pour into the plains of Dizful advancing as far south as Shush. In doing this they usually give a wide berth to the Dirakwand ; in whom they have but scant trust. If the Governor at Khur ramabad is hostile, they not infrequently remain in the low hill country of eastern Pusht-i-Kuh for the summer. Besides cultivated lands they own large herds and flocks. The Sagwand are of Arab extraction and. came into Luristan some 150 years ago. Karim Khan Zand endeavoured to transfer them to Shiraz, but after a short stay in that place they escaped and returned to Luristan. The tribe itself at that time was insignificant and was without lands: but in course of time they murdered the chiefs of the Saki Makan ftli and Tulabi tribes and annexed their properties. Thus the land taxes they now pay are those of the tribes they overpowered. They have been joined by many families from the Papi, Luri, Mumianwand, Quliwand, Hasanwand and Tirhan tribes and now number 3,000 families or about 10,000 souls. They are sub-divided into many branches, vide tabulated statement below. A small and distinct branch, known as Gal- lehdar is permanently settled on the plains to the west of the Ab-i-Diz. Their fighting strength is reckoned to be greater than that of any other Lur tribe and is said to be 20,000 sowars, of whom half are armed withrifles. Their Khans and chiefs are influential. In this connection the following table will be of interest:— Kahim Khan. *Ali Khan. (Married sister of Muzaffar-ul-Mulk.) ’Aziz Ullah. (Died.) Gidan Khan. (Bled.)

Daughter betrothed to son of Saiyid Muhammed Husain, Chief Mujtahid of Dizful. Mehr ’ Ali Khan. 1 Daughter. (Married to son of Muzaf far-ul-Mulk.) The two important sub-divisions of the Sagwand were formerly the Rahim Khan and ’All Khan, but these divisions are now beginning to lose their application. Over one section of the former Fazil Khan, when present, presides : and in his absence the leadership devolves on his nephews Hasan Gidau and Khanjan Khan. Over the second section, Agha Riza presides, with whom is associated Karim or Khazal Khan. This section is certainly inferior to, and possibly half that of, the other. The ^Ali Khan are comparatively few in numbers, and since the overthrow of their leader Mihr ' Ali Khan by Hasan and Khanjan Khans their followers have joined Rahim Khan. The Tidabl occupy the villages to the south of and in the plain on Khurramabad. They are chiefly located on a mountain called SamakhLUR—LUR 668 which is close to the Chigini and near the Ab-i-Kashgan. It is abundantly covered with sumach trees and is the haunt of much horned game, especially the maral deer. This tribe is reckoned at some 300 families, or 1,000 souls in all: and they supply 100 men for the Amrai regiment. The Pam occupy lands bordering on those of the Sagwand to the south east of Khurramabad, as far as the Sazar river. They have very little land under cultivation and subsist chiefly by their flocks and herds. vVithin their limits is a notable imamzddeh, that of Shahzadeh Ahmad, son of imam Musa Kazim and brother of Imam Riza, to which the Lurs pay great respect and which makes them the recipients of many gifts and endow ments. About 200 families are attached to this imdmzddeh with the privilege of immunity from all taxation and freedom from oppression. They for merly numbered some 4,000 families, most of which, with their lands, had accrued to them by their overthrow of the Rashnu tribe, but m course of years they have become scattered and the present estimate given is ~ 00 families, or about 1,000 souls. The Judall occupy the country to the south of Khurramabad and of the road to Dizful, commencing from the Shurab, 12 miles south of khurrama bad as far as the Ka Gilan Pass, a distance of some 55 miles. Although their lands are situated in the garmslrs, the climate is still pleasant m the hot months owing to the considerable forests which cover it. they cul tivate a sufficiency of ground for their wants, though the poorer members of the tribe live on acorn bread. They are practically little more than a section of Dirakwand, the northerly part of whose land they occupy in a somewhat uncertain tenure. No love is lost between them and the Dirakwand and they would gladly sever the connection were they ever strong enough to avert their neighbours' resentment. They were formerly reckoned at 2,000 families, but they have diminished of late years and are now said to have 800 families, or a total of 3,500 souls. Iheir Chiefs, Path Ullah khan and 'Abbas Khan appear to be on good terms with Hasan and Khanjan Khan of the Sagwand. The Dirakwand are located to the south-east of the Judaki, their limits on the north being the plain of Khurramabad, about 20 miles south of t ie town, on the east the Papi tribe interposes between them and the Ab-i-Diz; on the south they are conterminous with the hills between Kaleh Gasim and the Pul-i-Zal, and on the west they are bounded by the J udaki. they inhabit a mountainous, tract difficult of access, the principal mountains or peaks in it being those of Takmani, Chuani, Kulrud, Kurreh Kharpush , Kuzkaveh, GurgI, Mangareh and Gialan. The mountains of Kuzkaveh form the spot from which legend says Faraidun and the blacksmith kliav, started on the expedition against Zuhak. The V ali, Ah Mardan Khana had some buildings and also a windmill erected on the summit of the moun tains At GurgI and Mangareh there are many gardens with tanks ot various strange shapes. On the mountains of Gurgi there are remains of domes built of stone and plaster, which denote that the district was once inhabited. In the valleys between the lofty mountains are found strips of good, cultivable soil, on which they are able to grow sufficient609 LUR—LUR grass for their requirements, supplemented by acorns out of which bread is commonly made in many parts of Persia. Many of these valleys afford good pasture grounds and are watered by running streams of excellent water. The climate of this region is very healthy and its inhabitants live to a great age. The Dlrakwand have the worst reputation of any tribe in Luristdn for turbulence, unruliness, and general depredations on caravans and travellers, as well as on their neighbours. Their ravages have extended on occasions across the plains to the west of Dizful and have reached even beyond the Karkheh. They have many times in their history been the recipients of condign punishment for their misdeeds, notably when, after attacking the camp of Timur, he caused Luristan to be devastated and a portion of the tribe to be massacred, and again quite lately, in 1902, when for raiding Kahunak and Julvand they drew down upon them the wrath of the Bakhtiari Khans, who claim to have taught them a severe lesson. This tribe, like many others in Luristan, claims to be of Arab extraction from the Koreish, and their Khans all have the title of Mir, as do those of the Sadat Bam Abbas. They were in foimerjtimes piobably altogether domiciled in the Pusht-i-Kuh ; since, before the appointment of Husain Khan, the ancestor of the present ali, that chief was always chosen from this tribe. The Dlrakwand are now divided into two chief branches— the Baharwand and the Qalawand—and these in turn are sub-divided into numerous clans, vide tabulated statement below. Besides the divisions included under those two heads two others should he mentioned which formerly were of some importance. The first, the Rashnu, still belong to the Dlrakwand, but have become merged in the Baharwand and lost their identity ; one branch of them live in Khurrama- bad and are well known as giveh (shoemakers).. The second, the Zainawand, separated from the Baharwand some twenty years ago, and have become associated rather with the Sagwand and Bairanwand. Their numbers are said to vary between 30U and 500 tents : and their chiefs are the sons of Mir Karuni. The numbers of the true Dirakwand are reckoned at 1,000 families or some 5,000 souls j but these figures are increased by a strong foreign element of refugees from other tribes, chiefly the Bairanawand and Hasanwand, which would account for a latter day estimate of 4,000 fighting men. The following is a table of the ruling chiefs of this tribe : — Mib Tamar. {Died.) Mir Samahad Mir ’Abbas (Chief Mirz§. Mir Qasim- Saiyid Muhana- of Baharwand). (mad) Khan. Mir ’ Ali. (Died.) Mir Luff. ’ An mt. 20 Mir Darvish, set. 20. (Chief of Qalawand).LUR—LUR 67a Under existing circumstances their chiefs have no effective control over the tribesmen, whose independence and love of plunder often override the friendly agreements which they have made with the chiefs of other tribes. The Gurz Gurzl are. an essentially nomad tribe, owning no lands of their own, but settled mostly amongst the Bairanawand, the Sagwand, the Dal- wand and Kaid Rahmat. Others of the tribe have wandered farther afield into the neighbourhoods of Silakhur and Razan, where they are occupied in agriculture. They originally belonged to the Pusht-i-Ktih, but were made over as servants to one of his followers by the Yali, and were thus transplanted into their present haunts. They are said to number in all some 100 families. The GalleJidar is a small tribe owning certain lands of its own in the neigh bourhood of MaMan-i-Namak to the east of Khurramabad; some of the tribe live, all the year round, in Khurramabad itself, while others of them follow the Bairanawand and Sagwand to theyamsm. The late Muhammad J Ali Mb •za, Daulat Shah, appointed this tribe to be servants of the late Ilaji Mulla Nur •’All, a Mujtahid from Mazandaran, and exempted the tribesmen from taxation. The tribe now belongs to HajI Agha, grandson of the above-mentioned Mujtahid. Their numbers are reckoned at 80 families or 400 souls. The Rumidnl occupy lands, some 20 miles north of Khurramabad, be tween those of the Bairanawand and asanwand. These are situated in a well-watered, mountainous district known as Rabileh, much of which is forest land and contains many fruit gardens. In the winter they move down to within a few miles of Khurramabad. They supply a contingent of 100 men for the Amrai regiment. They are reckoned at 300 families or a total of 1,000 souls. The Uuk JRuk have their tents some 10 to 12 miles to the east of Khurram abad, between the Bairanawand and Sagwand. They own no lands of their own in their summer quarters, but work for hire in the fields of MaMan- i-Namak as well as in the mines. In their winter quarters, near the Chigini Tahmasp Khaneh river, they own some property at a place called Dalbar. This is a finely wooded district, and the lands near the river abound with francolin. Their numbers are said to be 100 families or some 500 souls. Tihrdn .—The last of the four great divisions of the Lurs, known as the Tihran, inhabit the country to the west of Khurramabad and southwards as far as the Saimarreh valley. Much of the land within the limits of these tribes in crown property, which they cultivate to their own advantage after paying malldt fixed on them. They are very productive and are well-watered by the Saimarreh river and its numerous tributaries. Saimarreh is an import ant district and formerly paid a malidt td the Persian Government all told of 600,000 lbs. of grain yearly. It is the winter quarters of most of the tribes of Luristan, with a sedentary population formerly of some 300 or 400 families possessing influential Kaldntdrs. But since the sale of this tract by the Governmen't to Husain Q,uli Khan, Yali of Pusht-i-Kuh, who collected his mdliat in cash, the district has been deserted by the sedentary families. The Tihran have their qiiilaq and kishldk mostly contiguous; and they are allied by marriage and other reciprocal arrangements with the Dilfan.671 LUR—1AJR They are, both numerically and in other respects, inferior to the other three branches of the Lurs. They are divided up into a number of small clans, none of which have the individual importance of some of the div i~ sions of the other branches. Those that have any claim to special notice are the ChiginT, the Amrai and the Surl; while the remainder will be found noted in the tabulated statement below. They have no supreme chief of their own and more or less acknowledge the authority of the 1 ath-us- Sultan, of the Dilfan. The Chiginl are located in the country to the north-west of and up to with in 12 miles of Khurramabad, extending as far west as the Kashgan river. They own excellent lands which are well watered by several good streams, such as the Naika&lt;h and the Sar-i-Ab-i-Darreh and numerous other smaller ones. Included in their lands are the following properties :—Milleh Shaban, Naikash, Darreh, Kuh Safrd, Gakleh, Sulmishgar, Haian, Mamulan, Ganda- beh, Nasardaleh and Yalrsian. Some of the valleys are well wooded, though speaking generally the forests are thinner here than in other parts of Luris- tan. Their mountain slopes contain game of all kinds in abundance. Most of the above description applies to the lands of the Tahmasp Khanr who are the more important of two branches into which this tribe is divided. The other branch is the Khatrm Kharri, situated to the north of the Tahmasp Khanr, but whose lands are contiguous. Notwithstanding the favourable description which is given to their country, the Chiginr are described by one traveller at least as &lt;( a miserable tribe, destitute of pluck and spirit and only successful as night thieves/' Their numbers are somewhat vaguely estimated, but it may be taken that they have some 400 families, or 2,000 souls in all. The Amrai inhabit the country about Rumishkhan, which is about 45 miles to the west and slightly south of Khurramabad. Their district is on the slopes of the Tarkhan range which affords a very pleasant climate, especially in winter and spring, while the summer is very hot. Besides the cultivated lands which they hold in this part, they further till the lands on the banks of the Saimarreh, near Ramawand, which form their qishlaq. They are reckoned at some 200 families, or 1,000 souls in all. For remarks on the Amrai regiment see below. The Sun occupy lands adjacent to those of the Amrai on the slopes of the Tarkhan and the Slab range; while their qishlaq are also in the vicinity of Ramavand on the Saimarreh river. This tribe is sub-divided into three divisions known as the Suri KuhdashtI, the Suri Kuraliwand, and the Suri Kushmawand. Their numbers are estimated at some 220 families, or 1,200 souls. Among the remaining numerous branches or divisions of the Tihran who are all located to the west of Khurramabad, with the Kara Su river for their western and the Saimarreh river for their southern limit, may be cited as follows :—the Sharawand, the Sadat Haiat Ghaibi, the Bazwand, Ramiani, the Ramawand, the Adinehwand, the Kushki, the Beg Muhammad Khanl,the Mahmud Khani, the Garrawand, the ZarutI, and the Rika. These are all small clans with families running from 20 to 150 in number, and are variously noted in the tabulated statement below.LUR-LUR 672 Besides those noted therein, three other small and comparatively un important tribes require special mention owing to their having migrated somewhat far afield. The Chavarl are located on the southern slopes of the Kuh-i-Gurrin between the Falak-ud-Din and the Mumianwand. They have built them selves villages on their lands, which are highly cultivated and productive. Although the winter is very severe and fuel is very restricted in this region, this tribe does not migrate to the warmer climes of the south. They are divided into two branches, the Safid and the Kilas; and they are said to be ’All Ilahls. Their numbers are estimated at 300 families, or some 1,000 souls; and they supply a company for the Amrdi regiment. The Bavail are another branch of the Tihran who have also become some what estranged from the parent tribe by change of locality. They are found to the south of the Alishtar plain between Mumianwand and Quhwand. They pay mdlidt to the chief of the Tihran, and consequently are included amongst that tribe. They own well-watered lands, which are also well- wooded and productive of all sorts of fruit, besides gum-tragacanth and gaz, of manna from the tamarisk shrub, and cereals. Their cultivation is limited Owing to the inaccessibility and wildness of their country, they h ave a b ad • reputation as robbers, though not wanting in personal bravery. They enjoy an excellent climate, and it is said that amongst them are found centenarians still capable of doing work. Their numbers are estimated as some 200 families or 800 souls. The SinjM are a small and, in later days, a much reduced, branch of the Tihran, who have wandered far afield and are found to the north of the Alishtar plain, between the Mumianwand and Itiawand, though they migrate to qishldqs at Kuh-i-Dasht and Tihran. The chiefs of this tribe are baiyids and in former days were important personages having followers m places as far distant as Tabriz. But of later years they have become poor and dispersed and are now said to number not more than 70 or 80 families. PvsU-i-Kith —The tribes of this district of Luristan are entirely nomadic in character and as mentioned above they are distinguished from the Lurs of Pish Kuh by the prefix “ Faili.” They occupy a remote and almost inaccessible country, a succession of arduous mountain ranges extending from the Saimarreh river to the Turkish frontier. It is not, therefore surprising that their chieftain occupies a position almost independent of the Central Government. The present A ah is a direct descendant of Hus i Khan the first Vali of Luristan. The last A ah to hold sway over both p. , B h an( i p U sht-i-Kuh was Hasan Khan. Of the three sons of Hasan Khan mentioned by Layard as having divided the tribes amongst them onte death of the^pretensions 11 of Haidar Khan, the third son, to inherit the title of his _ I Uairi Kit- flip Persian Governor of Luristan, whereupon the Xad Khan, took refuge with the Assyrian elder biothe , f (DeBode.) Eventually, two or three years Arabs on the 0 f all things Lur, Sartip Haidar Khan of the Sinwfnd was put to death by the Governor of the district, after havrng673 LUR—LUR been invited to Khumimnbad to receive favours of the Sbah; his sons follow in the wake of J Ali Khan, but are in no way attached to him, and con sider that their misfortunes have been his opportunity. Of these young men the elder is by no means a prepossessing youth; the younger, quite a boy, has a face which attracts by reason of its look of quiet melancholy and resignation. They frequently visited Major Bell and related to him their misfortunes, under the idea that he was a Sartip in the service of the Shah, whose good offices at Tehran might have served to bring them again into favour. At the time when the party were treated with little consi deration by Haji ’Ali, they offered tent room and hospitality. The Agent of the Zill-us-Sultan with the tribe, not much liked by Haji 'All, advocated their rights, so it is quite possible that a turn of the wheel of fortune may yet bring these lads into prominence. Ahmad Khan, the second son, has a considerable following, and is at enmity with his brother for like reasons, and in rebellion against the government. The chief of the Lurs about Kirmanshah is Husain Quli Khan, a lawless chief. This Husain Quli Khan (whose fathe* was Haidar Khan, but whether the above-mentioned Haidar Khan Sartip or not is not quite sure) is the famous Abu-Graddareh. The summer quarters of the Vali are at Deh-i-Bala, a secluded valley, very difficult of access at the foot of a lofty mountain known as the Manisht Kuh. If the \ all and his people move from their quarters, it is in the direction of Turkey rather than of Persia that they shift their tents. Their chief qishlaq is at Husainieh, at the foot of the Pusht-i-Kuh and just within the Turkish border; it is with Baghdad and Kut-al-^Amarah that the Vali trades : it is upon Turkish territory that he makes his raids, constant dis putes arising about the occupation by the Lurs of Ottoman soil; and his Sworn and inveterate enemies are the BanI Lam, who are Turkish subjects. He R probably the best living representative of the old border chieftain, and is said to be able to call out 30,000 lighting men. The present Vali is Riza Ouli Khan, the former Saham-us-Saltaneh. His family tree reads as follows :— Husain Quli Khan .—(died 1900.) Ghulam Riza Khan, V all. Ali Riza Khan. No issue. Aman Ullah Khan. Saham-us-Saltaneh. Ghulam Shah Khftn. Isfandiar Khan. Daughter mar ried to Salar- ud-Dauleh, son of Muzaffar- ud-Din-Shah. In 1904 Aman Ullah Khan rebelled against his father who had to retire to Aivan; but matters are now arranged, and Ghulam Riza Khan^s rule is supreme in Pusht-i-Kuh. 1 Th U ail ‘&gt;:'Vr, ber , 10 ’ 0 , 00 l amilies which are divided into four blanches . Kuid, Mahaki, dependencies, and J Arab.LIT11—LUE 674 The Kurd have 4 ; 000 families sub-divided into &lt;13 divisions. They reside in summer in Kabir Kuh and sometimes at Saimareh. In winter they go to Abdan, Deh Luran, the hills above Badrai and the foot of the Kabir Kuh. Included in their lands are the following properties : Balusna, Khushawul, Haileh, Banmurian, Tuhna, Cham-Nargis ; Bisheh- daraz, Zardek ; Kuitu ; Kakali, Zarrinabad, Warmoan, Kanishulu, Darband- i-Kayeh. The Mahaki have 5,000 families, 13 divisions. In winter they are found to the'north-west of Kabir Kuh, and in summer at the foot of the mountains of this range. The Mahaki are sub-divided into 1&amp; divisions, (1) the Malek- skahi, residing, at Kalekjani, Kalekdusaga, Tang-Siab, Arkawaz, Kaurani, Zamarah, Vaireh, Kanikuzan and Kakehjuk ; (2) the Badrei Jor Bairei re siding at Sarab-Kulm, Kakehjabur, Cheshmeh Pineh, Tueh Hal, Banparvaf, Tueh-ganjab, Zarrinjub, Pa-i-Kavirkuh ; (3) Mishkhas residing at Sar-tueh- Milleh, SarbisHeh, Dargenab, Milleh-Yaku, Milleh-Gujeh, Tueh-Nargis, Kani-Mariam, Mingeh Kabud, Milleh Panjab, Kaleh Malek, Chai-Mamali ; (4) Arkawazi residing at Bansul, Mir-Mingeh, Kal 6 h Malek, Sarchefteh, Gallal-Malekshah, Banirzeh ; (5) the Khizil who frequent Chardaur ; ( 6 ); the Rizavand found at Chardaur, Ganjavar, Saravi, Zulmat, Balaveh, Kharmand-Sukhteh, Chinar, KaHh-Kattar ; (7) the Kalabadi, at Shirvan ; • ( 8 —10) Panjsutun, Deh Balai and Ali Begi, at Dehbala ; (11—13) Bauli or Baba Ali, Gurz Gurzi and Gaumar. The dependencies of the Kurd branch are (1) the Dinarvand who for merly numbered 200 families have diminished of late years, and many of them have settled at Bunvar near Dizful, (2) Kaiurdeh or Kaid Khurdeh, (3) Shuhan, (4) Babahai Sayid Nasr-ed-Din with six branches : Sayid Mansur-Bahhasana, Sayid Ibrahim, Sayid Ibrahim Kattal, Sayid Nasred Din, Sayid Salih-ed-Din, and Sayid Fakhr-ed-Din. They live around the various Imamzadehs of Pusht-i-Kuh, such as Imamzadeh Nasr-ud-Din, Imamzadeh Ibrahim and others. They are said to have from 20U to 300 families. The Arab are three small tribes, the Saifi, the Malkhatawi and Gawi which, although living on the Turkish border are under the authority of the Vail of Pusht-i-Kuh. The dependencies of the Kurd branch and the Arab together number some 1,000 families. The numerous clans of Faili Lurs, or families of Pusht-i-Kuh are shown in the tabulated statement below. It does not differ very greatly from the obsolete statements of Layard. In addition to those given therein, a note may be here made of a tribe of a somewhat doubtful connection and domicile, as to whether belonging to Luristan or Persian ’ Arabistan. 1 his tribe is— The ’Amaleh-i-Karim Khan .—A small isolated clan of Pusht-i-Kuh origin occupying a few walled villages about 6 or 7 miles to the west of Dizful They are often raided by the Chigim and others, but, though only credited with being able to muster *omc 80 to 100 \w/w.v, they are 3 b675 LUR—LUR still able to hold their own. (See also Amaleh Karim Khan in this Gazetteer.) Their claims to consideration^ as also indeed the explanation of their con tinued existence^, is the relationship which binds them to the Yall of Pusht-i- Kuh and secures to them in some measure his protection. The following tabie will explain this point ; great weight being attached to the marriage of Karim Khan's daughter :— Gurgi Khan, brother of Haidari-Khan, father of late Yali.

The Persian Administration and the Chiefs .—Reference has already been ma e ° ie act that the administration of Pish Kuh, or Luristan proper, was taken out of the hands of the Vail by Shah 'Abbas in the early pari v century ; and it has so remained ever since, being now directly administered by a Deputy Governor, with residence at Khurram- abad imder the orders of the Governor-General of Kirmanshah and, further, m the detailed notes above on each of the more important tribes, the chief- ains up o eac has been more or less thoroughly discussed. It remains, thuefore to notice generally the relations of the different chiefs with the fnS 6ach other as wel1 as the extent of their sub-dT^nnl 1 ^ 1 ^ , their tribe ' The # es of Luristan, and even the Strict \ ‘G °G Cm a 1 , - Cj L’ on j a very practical point of view, autonomous connection n ^ he ^f^^at sevei ' a l oi them have no strong territorial r^ri nd i m ° Ve ab0U the C0Untry ' if not absblu tely at will, at any rate am howeve and without restrictions as to seasons.

The chiefs of different tribes are constantly meeting in conference or communicating with each other by letters, to settle the mutual relations obtaining between their respective tribes ; and each acts in the character of a sovereign. There are no bonds of union or common action between them, except such as are created by the temporary pacts and agreements of their chiefs made under pressure of the dangers and requirements of the hour. The chief places his superior mental equipment at the service of the tribe. He schemes against the enemies of the tribe and forms aRianees against them, with regaid to its safety and the chief necessity of its existence, e.g., grazing. The tribesmen on their part hand over all questions of internal discipline to their chiefs and back his. arrangements by force of arms. The chiefs collectively are styled either Kha»dmn (plural of Khan) or Hazarat (plural of Huzur) ; while in the singular the term Bats or Buzurg is in use. The Lur word Baf is sometimes heard ; while the prefix Mir or Mia indi cates a connection, with a chief’s family. Below the chief’s come the heads of a family or village called Kadkhudi,. Tjpon these men, under the authority of their chiefs, devolves the duty of collecting the taxes, both local and imperial, and they are further responsible to their chiefs for the good order and loyalty of those under them, rhey may resort to any means they think proper in raising the tribute, and may imprison 01 maltreat those under them: but they are accountable for its collection as well as for the services in war time to the chief of their people, fihe chief himself accounts with the Government and is left to raise the tribute through his Kadkhudds. There are, however, notable exceptions, which are more of less recurring, of a disregard of these obligations ; such as in the cases of several of the Bala Girieh tribes. The most pro minent offenders of this section of late years, and at the present time, are the Dirakwand, who appear to have broken away altogether from their allegiance to the central authority ; and who have distinguished themselves by the committal of many outrages on travellers, even of high position. The most recent case is that of Colonel Douglas, Military Attache at fehian, who, when, travelling in November 1901- with Captain Lorimer, the British Vice-Consul at Ahwaz under the direct escort of the Dirakwand chiefs, had their camp rushed and their tents looted. Both officers were badly wounded in the meUe which ensued ; and in this condition, and stripped of all then- effects, they were turned adrift to find their way back as best they could to Khurramabad. The powerlessness of the Persian Government aga&gt;r.«t those lawless tribes is well-instanced by the fact that no efficient steps, beyond a parade of a dummy army, were undertaken for their punishment. It may be assumed, therefore, that the authority of the Persian Govern'.r outside the narrowest limits is merely nominal, and entirely dependent on the good will of the chiefs. The only attempt at any local militaiy foice was centred in what is called the Amarai regiment. In earlier times the Tihran and Dilfan tribes each supplied a regiment, but some 40 or oO years ago they were amalgamated and the Amrai regiment was formed composed as follows :— 400 men from the Tihrnn tribe. 300 men from the Dilfan tribe. 100 men from the Tulabi tribe. 3 B 2677 LUR—LUR This regiment served in I)uristan and once went to Tehran ; bnt in the present day it exists merely in name. When the regiment was mobilized its command was vested in the Governor of Tihran. Life, Habits arm Religion of the 'Tribesmen —From the several allusions made to their life and habits in the detailed description of the more impor tant tribes, it may have been gathered that the life of the tribesmen is one of general insecurity and anxiety. That they would be happy, if it Were otherwise, is questionable but the effect on their temperament is distinctly apparent. The chiefs in particular have an anxious and worn appearance, and are constantly busied with the maturing of agreements, the pursuit of intrigues and the excitement of hostilities, which are necessary for the maintenance of the independence, not to say existence, of their tribes. The tribesmen themselves, while absolved from the burden of the arrangement of these schemes, are the means by which they are carried into effect ; and their life is, therefore, in the case of some of the tribes, a constant repetition of forays and raids, thieving and broken bonds. No better general description of a Lur can be given than that he is an adroit and incurable thief. Another unpleasant characteristic of the Lur is the utter absence of clean liness. This is one of the chief complaints of the Persian officials who have to dwell amongst them. For instance, it is said that in the whole district of Alishtar there is only one hammam ; and that one is built by a chief for his own private use. A fat or stout man or woman is rarely seen, while their figures are wiry and well knit to endure fatigue. The prevailing diseases appear to be indigestion, rheumatism, malaria,, liver and spleen, due to scanty clothing, sleeping on the ground and exposure. The women wear loose, shapeless dresses, affording no warmth, with little or no underclothing. The clothing of the children is of like character, affording no protection against the cold to the chief internal organ. Most of the offices of labour are performed by the women ; they tend the flocks, till the fields, store the grain, and tread nut that which is required for use. The men content themselves with sow ing and reaping, cutting wood for charcoal, and defending their property against the attacks of others. The religion of the Lurs is that which is common to most parts of Persia, namely, Shfah Muhammadanism ; the sect known as 'Ali Illahi is confined to certain branches of the Dilfan, though it numbers followers in places as far distant as Hamadan, as well as in Kirmanshah. With the exception of the chiefs, however, and their relations, the tribesmen pay very little heed to religious observances ; but the chiefs (even the Dfrakwand) always carry rosaries and say their prayers at the stated times. The Koran is in daily use for completing agreements and alliances : and its tenets and teachings are kept sufficiently in evidence at the rauzeh khanehs, which are a feature among religious ceremonies throughout Persia generally. In regard to AH 1 llaln-ism it can only be said that its existence is kept very quiet, and in towns, like Hamadan, this is especially the case : and it is further very doubtful whether they keep up any of the extravagances attributed to them by old travellers. Schindler states that the 'total assessment of Pusht-i-Kuh and Pish Kuh is 14,000 tnmans. Apart from the usual taxa-LUK—LUIi G78 tion in both money and kind there are also indirect means of raising revenue by systems of fees ; and fine for robberies, murders, and such like offences. The amount at which a Lur district is assessed being fixed, it is duly distributed over the tribes and their sub-divisions; in a general council and to the satisfaction of all, each sub-division determines the quota to be paid by its lesser sub-divisions, camps and villages, and then the Kad- Khuda, Rish-Safid, or Tushmal of each collects from the different families under his rule according to his knowledge of their individual ability to contribute. Produce and Commerce. —Like their neighbours, the Bukhtiarl, it may be said of the Lurs that their chief occupation is pasture : though they are cultivators to a far greater degree than the other. It is impossible to give a useful computation of the numbers of their flocks and herds at the present time ; but as a general statement they may be taken to be very extensive. Although the mountainous nature of the country precludes any extensive tracts being brought under cultivation, except in a very limited number of localities, the soil of most of the intervening valleys is extremely fertile and productive of more than a sufficiency of grain for the wants of its inhabitants. Any excess cultivation has been discouraged of late years owing to the unsettled state of the country, and the insecurity of the roads by which such excess would be exported. Other produce of the country is gum-tiagaeanth (Asiralgus herabensis), of which considerable quantities are collected, more particularly in the Khava District, and which is a very valuable source of income. Of a similar nature, but of comparatively small importance, is the collection of manna, or (jaz (Astralgusmi acanthus ). Lastly, the making of charcoal and the production of butter, cheese and ghi complete the tale of local industry. Mules. —But probably one, if not the chief, of the sources of the wealth of this region is their mule production. Luristan is undoubtedly the great mule-producing district of Persia, and in this connection Major Arbuthnot in his somewhat exhaustive reports (1905) writes : “ The mule-breeders of Western Persia are the Lurs, of whom there are several important tribes, notably the Sagwand, the Bairanawand and Dirakwand, who in turn are broken up into numerous taifehs, or divisions. Lur I Hats .— (a) Sagwand. The Sagwand arc the largest breeders among the southern Lurs, and the dealings of a purchasing officer would be limited at present to them. The present head of this tribe is Fuzil Khan, who is represented in the neighbourhood of Dizful by his two nephews, Khanjan Khan and Hasan Khan. These two chiefs, the former especially, are intelligent men of some business capacity, and seem anxious to assist an Englishman in any possible way. The Taifeh-i-Sa'adat (Saiyids), one of the divisions of the Sagwand, especially devote themselves to the breeding of mules, and are said to own young stock to a number of over 2,0U0 at the commencement of their selling season, viz., December. They come down into Dizful yearly from the mountains to dispose of their stock to buyers from all parts, notably the Bakhtiari, who find their market later on in the neighbourhood of Isfahan, while the Behbehanls purchase for the Shiraz market. (6) Bairanawand and Dirakwand. —With these tribes there is for the present difficulty in having any dealings : nor is it prudent for a European679 LUR—LUR to enter Luristan from the south for the time being. This state of affairs is not likely to improve in the near future, unless some energetic action is taken by the British Government, in reference to the arrangements lately entered into for the opening up of a road from Dizful to Kirmanshah by the new British Road Company. (For further details, vide this Gazetteer, 'Arabistan—Northern.) Naphtha .—While the streams in all the highlands of Persia are of sweet and pure water, the sandstone and gypsum ridges, which intervene between the alluvial plains on the west and the mountain ranges leading on to the elevated plateau land, produce streams, with few exceptions, of a brack ish or sulphurous nature : and in these streams are found pools of naphtha or petroleum. There are indications of this in the Beawut and Tumtumeh districts. Between Kaleh Qasim and the Diz river, there is a short, isolated ridge, with broken ground intervening between it and the main ridge. The latter tract is known as Qir Ah, and has an outcrop of naphtha and bitumen which is reputed to be large. It is evident that the naphtha belt runs the whole way along the foot of the western ranges of Persia, extending from at least as far north as Qasr-i-Shirin to a point east of Ahwaz. Nothing has been done within the limits of this province to exploit this possible source of wealth : and it must await its turn with the other possibilities connected with the recrudescence of the prosperity of Persia. Communications. —No communications other than by road exist through Luristan; the rivers such as the Ab-i-Diz and the Karkheh partaking too much of the character of torrents, at least within the limits of the province, to be of any utility as a means of communication. The use of the term f ‘ road ” is also merely used in its general sense, as they may be said not to exist and should rightly be called “ tracks.” Even as such they are mostly execrable, as in other parts of Persia. The English Road Company has obtained a concession for the construc tion of a road through from Dizf ul to Tehran; and work upon it had reached as far as Sultanabad (’Iraq) in 1905. The improvement of the existing track from that place southwards, with the development of the Karun river, would afford an efficient oiitlet for the trade to the north; but for the present (1905) it is entirely close owing to the depredations of the tribes, nor is there any early prospect of the restoration of order. The objection raised against the Shushtar-Khurramabad route is that it passes through the district of Lur-i-Kuchak, and that the Lur robbers would, as heretofore, plunder the caravans, destroy the caravanserais and bridges built along it, and even the road itself. The manner in which robbery has been put down in the Kuhgalu hills shows how such can be put down. The lawlessness that now reigns throughout Lur-i-Kuchak is due to a succession of weak and rapacious governors. A just and firm governor, aidded by a small body of troops to enforce his authority, would, within a few months, pacify the district. As a means to this end, the construction of the road and caravanserais, and the safe-conduct of caravans along it are required. As the road is now quite passable, the first desiderata are— the construction of caravanserais, storing them with provisions, guarding them, and the stationing a sufficient number of troops in each to ensureLUft—LUR 680 the safe-conduct of a caravan from one serai to the other. From Khur- ramabad to the Bala-Rud is 147 miles, or seven stages. Consequently seven caravanserais will have to be constructed and guarded. Stationing in each 100 infantry and 10 cavalrymen to guard the caravan serais and to furnish guards for the road, and keeping in hand a mobile force of 100 infantry and 100 cavalry to move on any required point within a few months, it may be confidently assumed that this small force of 800 infantry and 170 cavalry will have completely pacified the sinall district, and the scandal of a people in the very centre of Persia refusing to acknow ledge the authority of the Shah will be done away with. The Bakhtiari smile at the state of affairs in Lur-i-Kuchak, and the IlkhanI if allowed, would soon reduce it to order. It is very doubtful, however, whether this anarchy is not connived at for political reasons. To open the Karun to navigation, and the roads through Luristan to commerce, is, to the mind of the Shah to give the foreigner a footing in Shushtar and Dizful, to enrich the Lurs and Arabs, and to strengthen a part of the country still unsubdued, and occupied by alien races and but scantily by Persians.Other branches of tlgjgEHEMBKEKKKtHMMRtKBHKBEi 603 LUR—MAD LURT— Lat.

A village of 20 houses of Ka'b of the Dris division, situated on the left bank of the Bahmanshir about a mile above Shakhat Haji Is-haq on the opposite side .—[Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) MALAM1R— Lat. 31° 51' N.; Long. 49° 58' E.; Elev. 2,950'. An extensive plain in the heart of the Bakhtiari country. It is a, remark able feature in so rugged a country in that it is perfectly flat. It is oval in shape, being about 15 miles by 8, and surrounded on all sides by mountains rising to a normal height of 1,500 feet above the plain. Those on the west side are low and those to the north and east lofty and falling as a ride, pre cipitously to the plain. A spur of limestone hills, called the Kuh-I-Fshgal, an offshoot from the great Mangasht range, runs into the plain from the east and so forms a secondary plain of considerable extent. The valley is covered with rushes and grass and is stony and bare of trees. It is little cultivated owing to its being irregularly irrigated by a few springs, which rise at the foot of the hills and drain away from the plain along its edges. Besides these, a sluggish stream of brackish water converts the noithem poition of the plain into an extensive marsh, and often, after the winter rains, inundates the whole of it. The drainage of the southern exit is through the gorge of Halaigan. That of the north is mainly retained, foiming the lake above mentioned. Cultivation is scanty and only in the immediate vicinity of the several hamlets which are situated near the foot of the hills. It is principally used as grazing-ground. In this respect it is much spoilt by the great amount of camel-thorn, and nettles which overgrow it, but in^ the northern half, where exposed to inundation, it grows grass to some height. The centre of the valley rises to a low mound, on which is the Jcaleh of the Khans. Burton, in 1903, describes the latter as the ruins of a fort, of round stones strongly cemented, the whole almost covered with earth and debris, but showing the walls and arches of the lower rooms. In 1905 it was in process of rebuilding. Surrounding the kaleh, is the village sometimes known as Ijasa, but more commonly as Malamir. South of the mound, the valley becomes less level, and is traversed by spurs and a well-defined ravine running south-east towards the HalaTgan gorge. A sluggish stream runs from the south-west side of the valley to the central mound. About 1 mile due south stands the caravanserai, which marks the 11th stage from Isfahan (191 miles) on the Bakhtiari caravan road. The serai was built in 1903 by Isfandiar Khan of burnt brick, 70 yards square, with walls 10 feet high and a well in the centre, the water of which is 20 feet from the surface. In the vicinity of the mound is a Lur graveyard with theMAL—MAL 702 Usual stone lions in some number. West of the mound is a square fort With four flanking towers, only the towers, being in good repair, while about ^ a mile north can be seen the traces of a fort’s circumference, with earth ramparts and a corner of a central bastion, and ruins of buildings of round stones and mortar in the centre. The plain of Malamlr has been identified as Apirti and was inhabited by the Apharsites mentioned by Ezra. Apirti was a province of Elam, whose inhabitants formed part of the colonists placed in Samaria by Assur Bani Ba to fill the places of the Captive Jews. Towards the eastern end are mounds covering the remains of the Sassanian city of Idej. In a narrow valley, known as the Tarig-i-Nashalil leading from the plain near its southern extremity through which the caravan route runs, are found some interesting antiquities. These are hidden away high up in a cave with a cliff, known as Shikaftd-Sulaiman, on the left side of the road leading to Kaleh-i-Tul. The cave contains a number of sculptures and bas-reliefs either of Susian or Achsemenian origin, dating back to 800 or 900 B. C. There are remains of cuneiform inscriptions on the panels. In 1330 A. D. Ibn Batutah, the Moorish traveller, visited Malamir and describes it as being the city of Sultan Atabeg Afrasiab. It was then apparently in a good state. It is supposed to have even a greater antiquity than the Sassanian Epoch. The village of Malamir contains 150 houses with a population of some 600 souls. 32,500 lbs. of grain are sown annually as well as 1,300 lbs. of rice. The taxes amount to 2,000 krdns per annum, 5 krdns per head of families. The Samsam-us-Saltaneh has lately opened a good qandt ; under the usual circumstances, supplies are available for 100 men and 500 animals for one day. The water has to be brought from springs from 1^ to 2 miles distant. The water of the stream is brackish but not badly so. It is said to contain leeches. The caravanserai supplies approximately 6,000 mans of barley per annum. The retail selling price per Shahi man of 13 lbs. in October and November 1906 was barley—1 krdn, bhusd —20 krdns. Tem perature, 5th August, in a room of the serai and out of doors, 88°—100°. The population of the Malamir valley is nomadic. Lur camps are pitched there throughout the winter, the tribes beginning to arrive in the middle of September. Except for the village of Malamir itself, such few built habita tions as there are, are vacated in summer. Two roads lead from Malamir to Kaleh-i-Tul, the first via Tang-i-Nashalil (16 miles), the second via Halaigsn, 2 or 3 miles longer and more to the west. The first is not always considered safe, in which case caravans follow the second.— [Layard- — Burton, 1903 — Beport of a Journey through the Bakhiidrl country to Shushtar — Arbuthnot, 1905 — Lorimer, 1906.)

The Bakhtiari caravan route crosses the Kuh-i-Malvari, immediately after its passage over the Bazuft river by the Pul-i-Wmarat, on its 9th stage from Isfahan, between miles 140 and 145. The ascent from the Bazuft valley is exceedingly steep though the track is fairly good. The descent to the col on the farther side is very slight.— (Arbuthnot, 1905.)

Mirza Mansam Khan. Non-nomad. MAMASSANI— Most authorities concur in placing the Dushman Ziari {q.v.) and the Bavx (q.v.) sub-tribes under the Kuhgalu (q.v.). It would appear that formerly there was a fifth nomad division, e.g., Mahmud Salih (or Muhammad Salihi) presumably the Allam Salih of Baring and the Muhammad Salihi) mentioned by DeBode as a sub-division of Rus tam, which about 1885 broke away and joined the Qashqais. The tribe is celebrated as one of the most lawless of Persia. They claim descent from Rustam, having emigrated, they say, from Sistan. They have always given a great deal of trouble, and after the death of Path 'Ali Shah, the communi cation between Bushire and Shiraz was almost cut off by one of their chiefs, Yali Khan Bakish. They were, however, reduced by a detachment of re gular troops from Azarbaijan. It is said that on this occasion their women, 100 in number, rather than fall into the hands of these troops, threw them selves over the precipice with their children, and were dashed to pieces. There is a permanent feud between the Mamassanis and the Qashqais. The tribal chiefs Dushman Ziari, Bakish and Bavi, being related by inter marriage, feuds between these divisions are not frequent; but there is con siderable enmity and constant petty warfare between these three divisions and the Rustam. Their principal stronghold in former years was that of Kaleh Safid in the Bavi division, a considerable Diz, or hill fort, situated about 1,500 feet above the plain and said to have been 4 miles in circumference. They were5IAM—MAM 708 formerly inclined to be friendly to the British, and were accustomed to look to them for protection against the Persian Government. They are a fine race with features of the ancient Iranian type. They are considered to be Lurs, and speak the Lur dialect with local modifications. The Mamas- sani do not owe allegiance or pay tribute to the Governor-General of Pars. About 1902, the major part, being a fief of the crown, was sold to a rich merchant of Bushire, the Mufin-ut-Tujjar. This transaction was arranged by the Atabeg-i-A J zam, the then Vazir. The farmdn of the Mufin-ut-Tujjar gives him rights of haute et basse justice ” over the lands and tribes pur chased by him; and over which the Governor-General of Pars has no right of jurisdiction or taxation.— (DeBode. — Baring — Bell — Grahame, 1905 — ArbtUhnot, 1905.) MAMASANI TBJBE. 4 r Vaughan says that the Mamassani Lurs are said to be divided into four principal divisions, as follows :— 1. Bakish. The Bakish are sub-divided into the following divisions :— 2 .

The Mamassani Lurs pay 12,000 Inmans mdlldt to the Governor of Shi raz, and 20,000 tumdns besides. These tribes, judging from the retinue of their Khans (whom one would naturally suppose to be the best equipped), are principally armed with smooth-bore muzzle-loaders and a few with Martini carbines, chiefly of the sporting pattern. They are all marked “ Allport London.” They also possess some smooth-bore, double-barrelled muzzle-loading guns, pistols and knives; they seem a simple, ignorant, pri mitive lot of people, with a very high opinion of themselves and their fight ing powers, and are said to be devoted to their chiefs. They would probably be troublesome to the unaccredited traveller. The Dushman Ziari are said to be most warlike of the tribe.— [Vaughan, 1890.) MAMATAIN— Lat. 31° 20' N.; Long. 49° 50' E.; Elev.

MARBARA (I)— A river rising in the Zard Kuh mountains, and flowing into the Karan river, in a narrow valley below Kar Kunan ($ml). Stack saw this river about 100 yards above its junction with the Karun, and at this point it flows with a smooth, silent stream, very swift, hip-deep, and very cold and clear; the breadth is about 30 yards. The bank is clothed with willows, and immediately above them rises a steep slope of 100 feet covered with quarried stones and splinters. At the junction of the rivers stand the remains of the dam which was to throw the Karun water into the cleft; the Persian monarchs were hewing for it through Kar Kunan. There is an island midway between the two streams and this; and at the mouth of the ravine down which the Karun flows, are the ruins of two piers, built of unhewn stone, compacted some 30 feet thick, and 8 feet to 10 feet in height. The dam does not seem to have ever been completed. The meeting of the waters looks well when viewed from the stone-strewn slope. So deep and narrow is the channel that even the summits of the Zard Kuh are lost to sight, and the spectator finds himself alone with three river vistas,—up the Marhara on his right, up the Karun in the direction he faces, and down the combined stream on his left. The dark, high sides of the river channels contrast strongly with the bright blue-green of the waters, and the deep blue of the sky. The swiftness and silence of the current enhance the strange effect. The combined stream rushes along unfordable, but the Marbai a can be crossed 50 yards above the point of junction. It is unfordable in the after noon, when it has received its day’s contingent of melted snow. It is called the Marbara because its waters are so cold that a snake dies if plunged in. them.— (Slack.)

MARUN (River)—• A river in Southern ^Arabistan, also called sometimes the Kurdistan or Behbehan river. It unites with the river Bulawas in the Ramuz district, 10 or 11 miles below Ramuz town, and the two together then form the river Jarrahi. Sultanabad and Jaizan in the Ramuz district lie respectively 13 and 28 miles up from its junction with the Bulawas. The valley of the Marun in the Ramuz district is 1 to 2 miles wide, flat and enclosed bv cliffs, 50 to 100 feet high. The stream is 50 to 100 yards broad, 3 to 6 feet deep, and has a strong current. The banks are bordered with thick willow jungle. About 5 miles above Sultanabad the Marun receives on its right bank a tributary of fresh water called Mamuhleh, 10 yards wide and 3 feet deep, fringed with willows and oleanders. On the north side of the Marun in places are grassy plains with thorn trees. The river has also been called, the Rud-i-Marun or Rumarun. Colonel Bell, on his route from Isfahan to Behbehan, reached the banks of the Rumarun river (Kurdistan river) on the 12 th June, 1884; barometer 27'95' / (1,400 feet); thermometer 102°. The artificial horizon became too hot to be lifted after it had been for 7 minutes exposed to the sun at 3 r.M. The river is from 60 to 80 yards wide, with a bouldery bottom and swift current; its banks are here low and well-wooded. There is good pasture on the hill-sides, in the vicinity, i.e., a dried up grass, 6 inches to 9 inches high. At 3-30 a.m., barometer 28T'; thermometer 70°. Wells writes about this river :— “ December 8th. —Last night our tent was pitched near the village of Kuriseh of about 15 inhabitants. A white frost and cold fog cover the land this morning. A stream from the direction of the north has first to be crossed, and 3 miles from camp river Jarrahi [i.e., the Marun river) at this point itself forms a formidable obstacle. From bank to bank it is 70 yards wide, and in flood would be at least 6 feet deep. It is a rapid stream, and even now, when only 45 yards wide, is only fordable by strong men, being up to the horses^ girths. In spring it would be a nasty flood to pass. Fine cover of tamarisk and oleander marks it course, whilst beyond, palm groves, villages, and cultivated ground present an unwonted scene of prosperity and security for this part of Persia. Wild cabbage is the ordinary weed of the plain.”—(ReW— Wells—Fersian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) MARUZEH— Lat. 31° 2' N.; Long. 55° 57' E.

The hills to the south of the river command the Band Amir and Pul-i-Khan crossings, and offer a good position to oppose a force advancing from the north. In wet weather the portion of the plain south of the Band Amir river becomes marshy, and impassable for wheeled traffic except by the causeways of the road. In dry weather troops could move across the plain, but north of the Band Amir river the numerous irrigation channels would necessitate artillery and wheeled transport moving by the road— {Howe, 1906.) MARVDASHT— Elev. A district of Ears and a plain about 22 miles north of Shiraz crossed on the road to Isfahan. The plain is a flat expanse about 15 miles in width from north to south, while its south-easterly extension is said to stretch for 40 miles. It is bounded on the east by the district of Arsinjan, on the north by Kamin and Main, on the west by Ramjird and on the south by the dis trict of Shiraz and Kurbal. Qandts and irrigation channels dug from the Band Amir river intersect it in every direction, and have always rendered it a fertile spot. Nothing, however, illustrates more pertinently the de cline of modern Persia than the fact that, though this plain in Le Bran's day, not two centuries ago, contained 880 villages, this total has so dwindled that Curzon numbers them at 50 and other writers as low as 17. So inade quate is the control of the water-supply that the plain often lies half under water, and is converted into stagnant pools and swamps. The soil of the plain is alluvial. It is chiefly composed of marl and is in general less stony than that of Shiraz. In many parts, and particularly to the south-west, it is a decided clay. It is higher than Shiraz and possesses every requisite except good government to become populous. The productions of the dis trict from the winter sowings are wheat, barley, bran and a little opium; from the summer sowings, rice, grain, til, castor and cotton. Sesame and melons are also cultivated in April, the plain is green and fertile. Num bers of I Hat $ feed their flocks on the wide expanse of the plain, and, if not kept in order, are apt to turn their hands to robbery.

It is a picturesque looking spot, and contains 550 houses. Water is plentiful and the grazing is abundant. Where Masha ends, Gusheh (q.v.) begins, and a little farther down the valley is Hurra (q.v.)* The cultivation extends down the valley for 3 miles and at its widest is 1 mile in width. The valley is highly cultivated, chiefly with fruit and vegetables, and is crowded with trees. The road down the valley is a fair track and passable for laden mules, though steep and winding in places. It passes down through a succession of cultivated terraces and crosses, by rough wooden bridges, rushing torrents of water. The whole valley is delightfully cool and forms a charming summer resort. Two-thirds of the inhabitants of the valley are Babis. They are a mild and peaceably disposed people. The live-stock of the valley comprises 100 cows, 2,500 sheep, 1,000 goats, 400 donkeys and a few mules. The valley, like that of Deh Bala, is a very strong position and the three passes—one north, one south and one north-east—could easily be held against vastly larger numbers. The elevation of the upper} end is 8,291 feet.— (Vaugkan, IS90.) MASHAL— Lat. Long Elev. A village near the river Shatait (q.v.). MASHGAKL— Lat. Long. j Elev.-2,S0O'.

It forms the 4th caravan and post stage of the road. The village itself is built on the mound in a luxuriant plain, with a plantation of chlndr trees and watered by a fine stream. It contains houses of a superior type and gardens, and has a good caravanserai and a post house. The inhabitants number 2,000. The district is said to have been in the hands of a family of Arabian origin for over 700 years. The KhanMAS—MAS 716 lives in a picturesque kaleh overlooking the village, but commanded at close range by hills to the north. The water here is good, but supplies are scanty and fuel is scarce. The well cultivated valley in which the village lies is a favourite camping-ground of the Turk and Arab Qitshqai ILlats, w ose black, goatVhair tents cover it at certain seasons of the year. I he climate here is more bracing than that of Shiraz. In the hot season, it is veiy o in the middle of the day, but even at this time the nights are cool. In winter the cold is severe, snow often lying on the ground for months to gether. Intermittent fever occurs only occasionally. The most common diseases are diarrhoea, dyspepsia and ophthalmia. There are lead mines in the neighbourhood. , Wilson who visited the place in 1907 describes it as a collection ot villages as under, owned by Sanf-ud-Dauleh, situated in a broad, fertile valley, about 50 miles north-west of Shiraz.

It lines 41 miles south-west of Kirman city, on the road to Bandar 'Abbas via, Saidahad in the centre of a fertile valley containing many prosperous vil lages. It consists of some 200 houses, with an estimated population of 1,000 persons, which are built round the ruins of a mud fort standing on a mound. There is a considerable amount of cultivation in the neighbour hood. Ordinary supplies are procurable in abundance, as well as excel lent drinking water from a spring. A mile short of the town are extensive ruins of the ancient city, once held by the Azrakites, with an interesting octagonal-domed shrine, called Plr-i-J asus. The modern town is the head-quarters of the Kirman Regiment. Mashiz-i-Kuhneh lies about half a mile to the north, and not to the east, as shown on the Survey of India map (1897 edition).

Iron ore near Mashtz in Bardsir. —About 17 miles from Mashiz in a range called Dum-i-Gav, and consisting mainly of limestone, ’gypsum and marl slate, I found a stratum of grey limestone lodged between strata of marl, alternating with gypsum. This stratum of limestone carried • hematite in very thin veins, not thicker than I inch, and in small lumps of the size of a walnut. The outcrop of the stratum -could be traced along a line of 800 feet length, but nowhere did the iron ore occur in such quantities as to be of any value. Some crystals of pyrite of iron were also found, but no value could be attached to this occurrence. Old copper mines near Mashiz. —Near the old Imamzadeh of Mashiz, slag was scattered cover the ground where copper ore had been melted. At the foot of the Kuh-Bagh-Basm, about 7 miles from the village of Mashiz and near a garden called Bagh Basm, on the left bank of a small stream, several heaps of slag may be seen. They are light and contain but little 'copper. About 1 ^ miles west of the Bagh-Basm there are traces of mining work, which, judging from the weathering of the rock laid open by the work, must have been carried on a few centuries ago. A trench 64 feet long and 6 to 8 feet wide had been run to extract the ore. The depth could not be ascer tained, as the trench was entirely filled up with rubbish and rocks, but it was scarcely more than 15 or 20 feet. Heaps of rubbish were lying near this old open mine. They consisted of pieces of basalt, the surface of which was partially covered with a thin crust of c rbonate of copper. As there was no calcite or quartzite mixed with the rubbish, it was concluded that tine copper ore was not found as a vein but as impregnation, filling the fissures intersecting the basalt. It may, however, be that a \^in was •extracted and that the output of ore, together with the gang, was carried to a place where there was enough water for dressing. This opinion wasMAS-MAS 718 strengthened by the fact that about miles from this old mine several veins of calcite 2 or 3 inches thick were discovered, and these veins carried red c pper ore in very thin veins, not thicker than T | inch and interrupted for long intervals when the veins of calcite are entirely barren. The situation of the old mine is not very favourable, in so far as the district has but little vegetation and fuel is scarce.— (Uinklehmer, 1892.) MASHRIKAN— A name used, sometimes for the one branch, sometimes for another of • the Gargar river in Khuzistan. Schindler says that one Idurisi, after saying that the Mashrikan was to the westward of Shushtar, speaks of a Mashrikan district, with many date palms, being passed before getting to J Askar-i-Mukram, Mashrikan being a large and populous district, lying between, and on, both branches ■ it is natural to suppose that the rivers would be called the Ab-i-Mashrikan simply because they came from MaShrikan, or because Mashrikan was situated on both of them, just as at the present day the Gargar and Shatait are indiscriminately called the Ab-i-Shushtar because they come from a pass by that town.— [Schindler.)

The hills enclose it on west, north and east ; on the south it lies open to the flat districts of Dashtistan and Zira. Mazarab is itself a plain and suffers ex tremes of heat in summer. The inhabitants are Persian-speaking Shl'ahs of mixed tribes, numbering about 3,000 souls ; they cultivate wheat, barley and dates, and export some wool and dates and a considerable quantity of gum, collected in the hills, to Bushire. The imports and the details of trade generally do not differ from those of the other small districts near Bushire. The local Hashim man is equal to 20 Tabriz mans of Bushire. MazaraT possesses about 700 donkeys, besides a few mules and horses. The Salar-i-Mu'azzam manages the affairs of the districts through an agent.

There are a post-house and a fine camvansemi here, built by the mother of Shah ^Abbas. It is a very ex tensive building, consisting of one front court, on the right and left of which, under lofty arches, are rooms and stables for the convenience of travellers.

An island in Northern ’Arabistan, enclosed by the Shatait and Gargar branches of the Karun river. The town of Shushtar stands at the north apex, and the village of Band-i-Qlr at the south apex of the island. TheMIA—MIA 724 inhabitants are ’Anafijeh Arabs towards the southern end, and elsewhere Bakhtiari, Lurs, and mixed Persian and Arab tribes peculiar to the Mianab. In spring the island is covered with vegetation, the grass sometimes leaching to a horse's belly; but in winter there is no verdure except in the neighbour hood of the villages, where the people cultivate the ground with wooden- shared ploughs drawn by horses, mules, buffaloes and even donkeys. The northern end of the island was once highly cultivated and irrigated by the Minau canal from Shushtar town, and about I of it at the northern end is still so served. The area of the Mianab is only about 270 square miles, and the whole of it could be watered from the existing canal if it were improved and worked. Within a radius of 3 miles of Shushtar there are m^uj kunar and date trees; farther south the only. trees are date trees belonging to villages. The game of the Mianab comprises mallard, teal, snipe, plover, and francolin, sand-grouse and pigeons; there are also jackals and pigs, and there were formerly lions. Three tracks lead from Band-i-Qir to Shushtar. The westernmost, 32 miles in length, runs to an encampment of the Bani Hasan about 12 miles from Band-i-Qir&gt; where it strikes the left bank of the Shatait; after con tinuing along the Shatait for 3 or 4 miles, it leaves it at a second Arab village and makes direct for Shushtar. The middle track, running through 'Arab Hasan land, is shorter but becomes impassable after ram. The easterly track strikes the right bank of the Gargar at Daulatabad, 11 miles from Band-i-Qir, and follows it more or less closely for 21 miles to Shushtar. The most easterly and westerly tracks are scarcely ever used.— {Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) MIAN CHUGHAN— Lat. Long. Elev. A village in Northern 'Arabistan, 6 miles south-west of Dizful.

A caravanserai in Ears, 49 miles west of Shiraz by road, and 21 miles east of Kazarun. There is a considerable spring of excellent water here, which gushed out in streams springing from the face of a precipitous cliif, about 600 yards above the serai and, flowing across the plains, caused, at some 2 or 3 miles distance, a marshy lake. In summer, however, the volume is not great. The serai is a good one, situated in a commanding position on a natural terrace, some 200 to 300 yards square. Behind the serai are the ruins of an old one the roofs of which are more or less intact. Pelly thinks Mian Kutal is the first point on the road from Bushire, where the climate can be considered such as would suit the European constitution during the hot season. There is no village near this, nor are any supplies obtainable except a little straw, but the caravanserai would accommodate 500 men, and there is camping-ground for 500 or more on the plateau. The arrangements for watering animals need improvement. The surround ing hills are covered with open forest, so fuel would be procurable.— [Taylor — St. John — Clark — Hardy—Pelly — Newcomen, 1905 — Gibbon, 1908.) MIAN TAQ, or SURADZA— Lat. Long. Elev.

A village in the Ramuz district, about 11 miles west by south of Ramuz town, on the main track from that place to Nasiri. Mirbacheh stands on a mound about 80 feet high, ascended by steep, narrow paths and crowned at the summit by a, fort-like enclosure. On the north-east, east and south east sides the village spreads downwards to the plain, and on the north west and south it is surrounded by plantations of young date palms, while to the south-west there is a detached date-grove, and on that side a garden extends to a distance of about half a mile from the mound. In winter the surrounding plains are grassy. The salt Muwailheh stream (vide article on Ramuz) passes about 2 miles to the west of the village, and at a mile on the east side of Mirbacheh a stream of fresh water, 2 yards wide and 2 or 3 deep, is encountered, besides other smaller channels flowing to the north-westward. The ground on this side is boggy and treacherous, but the channels are now bridged by logs. These streams of fresh water on the east of Mirbacheh are said to have their origin in a perennial spring some 10 or 12 miles south or south-east of the village, of which the discharge is sometimes conducted by a channel, known as the Ab-i-Ju ^Abdullah, to the lands between Mirbacheh and the Muwilheh stream. It is possible also that they are connected with the Zarnini stream of the Ramuz district. The place consists of rather over 100 houses, of which 2 or 3 belong to Lurs and the remainder to Bani Lam Arabs of the Kinaneh section. The inhabitants possess about 70 rifles. The irrigated lands are estimated at 90 khish or ploughs, the unirrigated at 80 khish. The annual yield of the same in grain, which here includes rice, is placed at 5,000 Ramuz mans. Date palms number about 6,000, on the average about 15 years old, and are the property of the villagers.

It is a noble bay, secure against the prevailing winds of the Gulf. It is formed by Cape Bustaneh to the eastwards, and Cape Certes (?), which in Heather’s chart is improperly called Bestian, to the westward ; the ex tremes, which lie north-west by west and south-east by east of each other, are about 10 miles as under. The bay is of a good depth, and is capable of holding the largest fleets ; the ground is to\igh clay, from which you with difficulty heave up the anchors : the soundings without the bay are irregular ; and between Mughu and Farur is a rocky shoal, on which is less than three fathoms. This shoal lies nearer to the main than to Farur, and is an objection against run ning from the bay in the night, but in the day-time the marks are so good that you may easily avoid it. By keeping a remarkable round and lofty hill, named Charak hill, north west, a ship will be led into Mughu Bay. The Chiffonne’s marks for anchorage in Mughu Bay are as follows : Against a north-west wind.—Extremes of the land west by north to jsouth-east; the town of Mughu north by east, off shore 2 miles, in 5£ fathoms, tough clay ; the points which form the bay south-east by east quarter east to west by north.

These bear from south-west to north east and from a small group of hills about G miles in length and 4 miles in Width, with a mean height of 1,000 to 1,200 feet. Apart from sulphur de posits and traces of copper which are not to be found here the formation of these hills is the same as that of those of Has Bustanah. Small pieces of iron glance and crystals of iron pyrite are also found here. W ater is from a dozen wells, sunk about 15 feet in a clay soil, and is sweet. There are several towers for defence and in 1899 a fort was built to ward off the attacks of the people of Charak. There are 150 houses, some unoccupied ; and the inhabitants are mostly Marazig, or Marzugi Arabs, who are Wahhabies. Grazing near village, good. No shops, but 5 business warehouses. Wheat, barley and dates are export ed. A few of the inhabitants are traders, the remainder are sailors, pearl divers and cultivators. To Mughu belong 8 sambuqs trading to the Coast of Arabia, 8 sambqus which cross the Gulf to the Arabian Pearl banks, and 4 ’amilals and 12 shu’ais which are used both for fishing and for pearl-diving on the Persian side at Bustaneh and Farur Island.

The tribal head quarters are in Persian territory, but less than half of the ti ibe ai e Pei sian subjects j the majority inhabit the right bank of the Shatt-al- Arab and are under Turkish jurisdiction. Those belonging to Persia are found in the northern part of ’Abbadan island, occupy the whole of the Shatt-aUArab district of Southern' Arabistan to the north of the Karun, and extend up both banks of the Karun into the Ahwaz district. All are cultivators of dates, and some in addition grow wheat and barley upon both banks of the Karun from Muran downwards ; they own many sheep and goats, some cattle, and a few buffaloes. The custom of the Muhaisin is to leave the Muhammareh neighbourhood for their grain lands on the Karun in Novem ber ; in February, after sowing these, they return to Muhammareh to fertilise their dates ; in May they revisit the Karun to reap their wheat and barley ; in June or July they re-appear about Muhammareh in expectation of the date-harvest which begins at the middle of July. The Muhaisin ih733 MUH-MUH Persian territory number about 0,000 fighting men, of whom aljout two- thirds are armed with rifles and 1,000 are mounted on horses.

Tliese individuals, according to tradition, belong to a tribe ot the Muhammareh district which was compelled to emigrate by the encroachments of the Ka'b and settled on the Tigris under the name of Al Husain Pasha. Muhaisin and KAsid with some followers, having purchased land in the neighbourhood of the modern Muhammareh from the Ka J b eventually returned to settle near the original seat of the tribe, and the headship of the tribe which they founded remained in the family of Kasib Ilaji I usuf-bin-Mardau, a descendant of Kasib, ultimately become Gov ernor of Muhammareh on behalf of the KaT Saikh and his son Haii Jabir was Shaikh of Muhammareh when it was occupied by British troop in IS 57 • his usual residence before that date had been at Daijf in Turkish territory A .ev the peace between Britain and Persia, Ha ji Jabir was made independent of the Ka b Shaikh by a Persian prince, the Ihtisham-ud-Dauleh who •governed the province; and after the Ka'b Shaikh had been captured and sent to Tehran, the Failahiyeh district was added to Haji JabWdominions Constant fighting ensued between the Muhaisin and thj KaT in which flip Muhai^n 10n ° f th6 Ka b inhabitin £ ^Abbadan island sided with the Hi iSGO Zia-ul-Mulk, the Persian Governor of ^Arabistan, countenanced the Ka b party and the result was the seizure and temporary removal of Haji Jabir to Tehran ; t\yo years later, however, having been released he was reinstated with the title of Nusrat-ul-Mulk by Prince Farhad Mirza the new 1 ersian Governor. From this time onwards the KaT&gt; Shaikhs have never been entirely free of Muhaisin control. Haii Jabir died in 1881 his successes were largely due to the fighting qualities of his son Hsa whn predeceased him. •’ wno Hajf Jabir was succeeded by his son Mizal who bv nla vino, pff -l i to the Shaikhship of Pallahieh aga'nst another/aii/by niittiim i„ g 1 /,/' 1 61 rival and then another as ShaikhT succeeded in becomhr^lmount chtef735 MUH—MUH of the Muhaisin and Ka 5 }) tribes. The hereditary Vail of Hawizeh, who formerly ruled the whole country between the Karun and the Tigris rivers, also fell under the power of Mizal; his authority, exercised subject to control from Muhammareh, is now hardly felt outside the town of Howizeh. Mizal received from the Persian Government the title of MuiTzz-ul-Seltanah. He fell a victim in 1897 to a conspiracy organised by his cousin Salman-bin- Mansur, to which most of the tribal Shaikhs was privy. Khaz'al, the youngest and only surviving son of Haji Jabir, succeeded his brother. The title of Mu'izz-ul-Saltaneh was continued in his favour, and to it was sub sequently added the military title of Sardar Ara\ By him the two hereditary Shaikhs of Fallahieh were deported and detained near Muham mareh, and the Fallahieh district has ever since then been under his direct administration through local headmen. He is now recognised by the Persian Government as ruler of all Southern 'Arabistan. The heir- apparent to the Shaikhship of Muhammareh is Chasib, the eldest son of Khaz’al by an Arab wife, who has already been invested by the Persian Gov ernment with the old title of Nasrat-ul-Mulk. Shaikh Khaz'al married in 1902 a grand-niece of the ’Ain-ud-Dauleh, the present (1905) Grand Yazir of Pers'a.— [Foreign Department Gazetteer&gt; 1905.)

Situated about 60 miles from the bar off the mouth of the Shatt-al- J Arab and 40 miles from Eao at its mouth, Muhammerah is the capital and most important town of the province of Arabistan and lies at the junction of the present main exit of the Karun and Shatt-al-’Arab rivers. Thiscxit known as the Haffar Canal (haffar-dig) is supposed to have been built by Alexander the Great to avoid sailing down the Karun and incidentally to open up direct communication with the Shatt-al-'Arab. Whether this be true or not, Alexander—according to Lord Curzon—founded one of his Alexandrias on or near the site of the present town. After destruction by flood it was successively known as Antiochia and Charax. Ardeshir Babehan rebuilt the town in A. D. 235 and changed its name to Astrabad; when it received its present name is unknown. Some centuries ago when Dizful, Shuster and Ahwaz were important cities, Muhammerah was a port of some renown. With the decline of these cities, however, it fell into disuse, for early in the present century it was rebuilt by one of the Sheikhs of the Muhaisen tribe of Arabs with the object of resisting Turkish encroachments. Opened a few years later as a free port by one of his suc cessors, the new port so greatly interfered with the trade of Basrah that the Turks sent an expedition and captui’ed it in 1837. It was during the wars737 MUH—MUH that ensued that the then ruling Arab chief called to his aid the Persians, who were not then the negligible military quantity that they have since become. The Persians in return made the Arab chief governor and remained in occupation of the town, the possession of which was a fruitful cause of dispute between them and the Turks until 1847 when, thanks to the diplo matic support afforded Persia by Russia and Britain, ^ Muhammerah was finally ceded to Persia by the treaty of Erzerum, and with them it has since remained. During the Persian war of 1887 Muhammerah was the scene of some fighting Batteries were erected on the north and south banks of the Haffar canal and the British war vessels and transport were subjected to a heavy fire as they proceeded up the river, though with little or no result. A shell from one of the warships fortunately exploded the chief Persian magazine about midday of the 26th March, shortly after the disembarkation of the British commenced, which so greatly demoralised them that no sooner had the troops formed up to attack them they disappeared Retreating —or rather flying-along the right bank of the river they took up another position in the vicinity of Ahwaz, from which a few days later in a bloodless encounter 10,000 Persians were driven by some 300 men of the 64th and 78th Regiments. Signs of the British bombardment are still to be seen in the deep furrows on a few of the date palms in the neighbourhood, while some of the shell picked up after the bombardment are to this day used as weights in the main caravanserai. An island opposite Muhammerah where a battery was posted, is also known as Am-ul-Rasas (Mother of Shell). General John Jacob, who accompanied the Persian expedition, in command of the cavalry, strongly urged that Muhammerah, which had become British by right of conquest, should be retained together with the province of Khuzistan, or Arabistan as it is now called, which he considered were or tremendous strategical importance. After a lapse of nearly 60 years it is interesting to consider what ad vantages Britain would have derived had his advice been followed and how supreme would have been her influence by the present time in this neighbourhood which is rapidly becoming of great world interest. It is very many years now since the attention of the British was fiist attracted to the value and possibilities of the Karun trade route, but not withstanding the repeated efforts of British merchants in conjunction with two Bakhtiari chiefs to obtain concession for trade on the Karim—the latter unfortunates were either imprisoned or put to death by the Persian Gov ernment—no concessions were granted until 1888. In that year the Kanin was declared opened as far as Bander Nasiri, situated at the rapids some two miles below the town of Ahwaz, whither merchandise after arrival at the former place is now conveyed by horse-drawn trams.

Lynch Bros, accordingly inaugurated their steamboat serv ' ice - Their steamer the Malamir —named after a well-know i plain in the heart ot the Bhakhtiari country—does the journey to Nasiri, about 110 miles, in 36—48 hours, depending on the time of year and amount of water in the river, with two iron barges loaded with cargo lashed to either side. Owing to the numerous shoals that are encountered, the steamer a ichors for some hours during the night: running aground is frequent and itsays much toiMUH—MUH 738 the Captain’s skill and knowledge of the river that the delays are no longer, Following the opening of the trade route, a British Vice-Consul was appointed in 1890, to be raised to the status of Consul a few years later as trade developed and the number of British subjects in creased. As might be expected from the name Arabistan, the population of Moham- merah, numbering some 4,000—5,000 excluding the oil refineries of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Abadan, is mainly composed of Arabs. The remainder is made up of natives of Dizful and Shuster, a few merchants from other parts of Persia, Baghdadi Jews and Christians. Mention must also be made of the community of Sabians, some 20 families of whom occupy a small and entirely distinct village outside the main town. Many and conflicting reports have been written of this interesting people who style themselves followers of St. John (Mandai Yaheiya). According to Curzon, they recognise St. John the Baptist as their chief prophet, although acknow T - Jedging the divinity of God. They have no churches and running water plays an important part in their ritual. The visitor if he is fortunate, may, as he passes the village in his ff belum,” see one of their baptisms. These baptisms are frequently renewed ; marriage and prayer also require running water. In appearance and dress, the Sabians cannot be distinguished from the local Arabs : they intermarry only among themselves, are smiths by trade and usually in a state of poverty. The Sheikh of Muhammerah though flying the Persian flag and nominal ly a Persian subject, is virtually independent. He is the chief of the already anentioned Muhaisen Arabs, the majority of whom living on the right bank of the Shatt-al-’Arab are of course Turkish subjects. His palace at Feilieh on the same river, four to five miles above Muhammerah and quite close to the Perso-Turkish frontier, is an imposing two-storied structure fitted with electric light. Here on the King’s birthday and the Id he entertains most of the European community at dinner : he also keeps an English speaking doctor. The town itself is governed by an official styled the Naib-ul-Hukumeh who pays the Sheikh a yearly stipend for this privilege. He derives his income from the fines he can extract from malefactors, various rentals and other privileges which are in his giving. Even more important than the above is the Rais-ul-Tujar (chief of the merchants). Himself an enterprising and most successful merchant, he is the^ Prime Minister and chief adviser to the Sheikh on all matters relating to trade and other affairs. Nor must mention of the Kar Guzar (Akram-ul-Mulk) or Foreign Office Agent be omitted. Appointed by the Central Government, his duties are to r su perintendent merchantile operations and represent the Persian Foreign Office. Lord Curzon in his Persia mentions having been put to grave inconvenience during his travels in this part of Persia from one of these officials, but at the present time, the position of the Kar Guzar is to all intents and pur poses a sinecure. The present holder of the office is a most charming man, who regards his sojourn among the Arabs as little short of exile. Like many Persians he is devoted to gardening and always welcomes Europeans with that charm of manner for which the better class Persians are so justly re nowned. \739 MUH—MUH As regards the relations between the Arabs and Persians^ it is recorded that during the Persian war of 1857 all the fugitives and wounded Persians that fell into the hands of the Arabs were massacred, British troops alone prevented the camp being looted after the Persians^ flight. Relations, though greatly improved since then, cannot even now be termed cordial ; the Arabs refer to the Persians as “ Apim ” or Barbarian and regard them as effeminate, while the Persians regard the Arabs as plotters. Muhammerah may best be reached by B. L S. N. Company, of which there is a bi-weekly service—fast and slow mail. The former touches only at Muscat and Bushire to pick up mails and passengers, the journey taking five days from Karachi : the latter touches at all the ports on the Gulf, the journey from Karachi taking anything from ten to fourteen days. Rarely a week passes without two or more tramp steamers passing Muhammerah, but their arrival and departure is uncertain. The steamer arrives at the mouth of the Shatt-al-'Arab about 12 hours after leaving Bushire. Here it is usually necessary to anchor, for the bar can only be crossed at full tide when there is 18 feet of water. Fao, on the Turkish side ©f the river, where the cable end of the Gulf section of the Indo-European Telegraph Company comes up, is passed a few miles higher up. Here there has been erected a fort which only diplomatic pressure at Constantinople and the presence of a British warship at Eao prevented being mounted with guns, to beeome a menace to the shipping. There are no hotels or caravanserais in Muhammerah where travellers may put up, so if a stay is intended previous arrangements should be made.. The steamers anchor opposite the junction of the Haffar Canal, which is. here about 600 yards wide and 20 to 30 feet deep. After a medical inspection, the visitor will be taken ashore in a a belum as the local boats are called, numbers of which come to meet every steamer on arrival. These are long, narrow craft something like a racing punt and are sailed by a mast and sail or poled or paddled. Most of the European residents have “belums” of their own, hiring local Arabs as “ belumchies ” to pole or paddle the craft. From frequent working together these acquire great dexterity and are only too keen to bet or gamble with the crew of a rival a belum ” on the result of a race—which latter sometimes culminates in a free fight when the most violent language is used and knives are drawn but seldom any blood. Proceeding up stream are passed the Customs House, in the hands of Belgian officials, the warehouses and offices of the various business firms apd the Consulate, which is shortly to be rebuilt. Both in Muhammerah and Ahwaz, the British Consulates are unimposinS looking buildings and quite unbefitting the dignity of a great power lik e Britain. It is believed that during Lord Curzon’s Yieeroyalty plans and estimates for more fitting Consulate were prepared to be pigeoni-holed on his departure from India. Considering what British interests are in this neighbourhood and the Eastern respect for pomp and show, it is surely to her interest to provide suitable residences for her Consuls. It is to be hoped the new Consulate will be on a larger and grander scale. Almost,- all the firms have adopted and altered to their requirements Persian houses^ the Anglo-Persian Oil Company alone having built a fresh building. ThisMUH—MUH 740 is a fine two storeyed building lighted by electric light as is the “ English” Club which lies adjacent to it. Muhammerah at the utmost cannot boast more thau thirty-five European residents, and it speaks much for the enterprise of these that they have completed a club with tennis and badminton courts and billiard room which can bear comparison with the average up-country Indian one. Passing the club, the next building of any note is the residence of Haji Rais-ul-Tujar already mentioned. The town of Muhammerah is next reached. With a river front of half a mile, it stretches back into the desert for some three-quarters of a mile. Eor almost its entire length the river front is lined which coffee shops, where in the early morning and again towards sunset the male inhabitants wend their way and, squatting crosswise on the wooden benches, sip a cup of tea or coffee, discuss the local news and doubtless criticise the passers-by. The most conspicuous of these coffee shops, and they are quite the feature of Muhammerah, is that frequented by the Jews : supported on piles it is built out into the river. The bazaar itself lies behind these. Like most bazaars in Persia it is roofed in and is closed for several hours in the middle of the day. Beyond the making of copper vessels and trays Muhammerah has no special industry like Shiraz, Ispahan or Kirman and the shops are consequently indifferent and uninteresting. A straggling Sabian village is next passed and a little later the “ Arsenal ” with the Kar GuzaPs house next to it. The Arsenal consists of five muzzle loading guns and limbers, with some barracks in rear, an air of blight and decay over the whole. What might have formed a quite picturesque picture is spoiled by the wooden structure which has been erected directly in front of the guns: its use may be best left to the imagination. Beyond this lie the residences of the officials of the Imperial Bank of Persia, by far the best built and most comfortable of the European houses. All the above lie on the right bank, with the exception of the quarantine station and one small village. The left bank is lined with date groves, in the cultivation of which the entire Arab population find employment. These date gardens, with an occasional crop of wheat or barley grown beneath the palms, extend about eight miles up the river. The banks of the Shatt-al-'Arab are also lined with them from its mouth to some considerable distance above Basrah. They form a restful and pleasing contrast to the rest of the surrounding country, which is dead flat, bare and monotonous in the extreme. The traveller who in other parts of the world has seen the value that is made of all available water cannot fail to notice how little use is made of this, the largest and most important of Persian rivers. The already men tioned date groves rarely extend more than a quarter pf a mile inland and are irrigated by water channels dug at right angles to the banks of the river which are filled and emptied at each rise and fall of the tide. Were the most primitive methods of raising water to be introduced, large areas of fertile soil now neglected could easily be brought under cultivation. Re mains of abandoned cultivation prove that a much larger area was formerly under cultivation, but Government oppression and the enormous percentage of revenue demanded (sometimes as high as sixty per cent, of the crop) have had their natural effect. In any other hands but those of the Persians741 MUH—MUH the district with its vast natural resources would have been a very different place to what it is at the present day. Muhammerah is also the headquarters of the Persian Navy or more cor rectly Customs Preventive Service, which consists of two steamers and two small yachts fitted with one or two guns each. The largest of these, the Persepolis, is the flagship of the squadron. Tradition says that it wa*s bought from a German firm, who fitted it with a ram to please the Shah and charged for it accordingly. It is extremely doubtful whether it could put to sea in safety, though the others are more serviceable. A Belgian naval officer is in charge of the squadlxm and the crew are almost entirely composed of Arabs who make far better seamen than Persians which is hardly to be wondered when their former traditions are considered. Much has been written of the climate of the Persian Gulf. Its horrors are a bye-word amongst officers of the East Indies Squadron and British India. Bad it undoubtedly is, but Muhammerah enjoys, and deservedly, the reputation of having the best climate of these parts. Until the end of July when the south wind commences the climate compares very favourably with that of the average Indian plains stations. During August and until the middle of September the climate is excessively damp and trying, while the thermometer records a temperature several degrees higher than that of Bombay at its worst. Without this wind, however, the district would not have gained the reputation it has of producing the finest dates in the world, for the ripening of the date crop and the arrival of Indian dhows which come for their annual cargo of date entirely depend upon it. Incidentally, most excellent soles are to be obtained during these months and form a welcome addition to the rather indifferent local supplies. No description of Muhammareh would be complete without mention of Abadan, a few miles below it on the left bank of Shatt-aUArab. Here are situated the oil refineries of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company whither the crude oil is conveyed in iron pipes from the wells at Masjid-i-Suleiman, some sixty or seventy miles north-west of Ahwaz. This company has obtained from the Persian Government the right to work all oil that may be found in this part of Persia, and though founded some years ago it has only recently extended its export trade outside the Gulf. A visit to the works will well repay the time spent. The European personnel are without exception Scotsmen, the natives, who number over three thousand, include Chinese, Japanese, Arabs, Luris, Bakhtiaris and nearly every class of Indian. , One more item deserves notice, namely, the fact that from Muhammareh will start the Commission which is to demarcate the actual frontier line between Turkey and Persia. It is to be composed of delegates from Britain, Russia, Turkey and Persia, though it is understood that the Russian delegates will not join the Commission until it has proceeded some distance along the frontier. Several portions of the frontier require exact delimitation but it is in the vicinity of Lake Urumiah that the chief difficulty of the Com missioners will lie. Both Turkey and Persia claim the district under dis pute, which was quite recently the scene of a skirmish between the Turkish and Persian troops. It is to be hoped that the Commission will prove more successful in their efforts than the previous one which met over a decade ago.MUH—MUH 742 Such is Muhammerah at present. And the future Surveys of the Moham- Hierah-Klmrmabad Railway have already been made as far as Shuster—• two years at the utmost should see work started on this section. Railways on the North-West Frontier of India have, it is almost needless to relate, had a very civilising effect on the inhabitants of those parts. It is not unnatural therefore to hope that the building and ultimate opening of this Railway will have the same effect on the unruly Luris and Bakhtiaris, who are at present so great a thorn in the side of the Teheran Government. The Railway will tap an enormous area, naturally rich, which only needs law and order and an assured market for its products to develop into its former prosperity. The trade of this district should increase enormously. A few more years may possibly see the Baghdad Railway at Busrah, which should likewise develop, though there is little likelihood of Busrah and Muhammerah interfering with one another’’s trade : a glance at the map will prove how entirely distinct are the districts that these Railways will feed. It is, however, quite possible that a branch line will be built between the two ports : the distance is only 19 miles and a line across the desert should present no engineering difficulties. Muhammerah has the natural conditions requisite for developing into a great port with two defects neither of which are insuperable. Firstly. The bar at the mouth of the river which, as has already been mentioned, can only be crossed at high tide and now that Turkey has formal ly handed over to Britain the-lighting and policing of the Gulf, there can be little doubt that dredging operations will be undertaken in the near future and this defect removed. Secondly .—It must be remembered that Turkey owns one and Persia the other bank of the Shatt-al-'Arab and in the event of hostilities between Turkey and Persia, shipping could be subjected to fire from one or other of the banks. The contingency is a remote one, it is granted, but is worthy of notice notwithstanding the fact that the free navigation of the river has been secured by the Anglo-Turkish Convention of July of this year. In any case, an alternative route to the Gulf exists in the channel of the Karim River itself, both banks of which are in Persian territory. During the war of 1857 one of H.M/s warships actually used this channel, but it was of very light draught as is proved by the fact that it was able to get over the rapids of Nasiri and reach Ahwaz. Dredging operations on a large scale would therefore be necessary to make this route practicable. The water at Muhammareh is, of course, plentiful and very good from the rivers, but is not to be obtained from wells, as the water found in them is salt and brackish. A well was dug by our Sappers in 1850 at about a mile inland, and no water was procured till the well had attained a depth of 28 feet, when a very little was found, and that was undrinkable and brackish. Water is also to be obtained from the various cuts and nalas, but doubts are entertained as to its wholesomeness, owing to its llowing through the date-groves, where vegetable matter grows thickly on the banks. The water from the Bahmanshir, or Haffar, should be always procured, if possible, for drinking, being supposed to be much moie wholesome than that of the Shatt-al-’Arab ; while the creek or irrigation water should be avoided, being impregnated with the foul vegetable matter through which, it passes. 3 &amp;743 MUH—MUH History .—On or near the side of the modern Muhammareh, Alexander the Great founded one of his numerous Alexandrias. This city having been destroyed by flood; it was rebuilt by Antiochus and called Antichia. Again washed away, it was again rebuilt and called Charax ; and having been captured by an Arab chief named Spasines, received his name bpansin Charax. Ardashir Babakan ; when rebuilding the town about 235 A. D v changed its name from Kerkh Misan (Charax of Mesene) to Astarahad. In the old days, some six centuries ago, when Ahwaz, Shushtar; and Diz- ful were large cities, and the centres of popular districts and an extensive commerce, Muhammareh was a port of some renown. In 1812 it was rebuilt by a Shaikh of the Muhaisin tribe to resist the encroachments of Turkey. In 1820 it was for a short time the head-quarters of the British Besideney, which was moved thither from Basrah in consequence of the disturbances between the Turks and the Arabs at the latter place, and the prevalence of piracy on the river above. Soon after this Shaikh Thamir opened Muhammareh as a free port, thereby bringing down upon himself the vengeance of the Vali of Baghdad, who found the trade of Basrah suffered severely from the competition of such a rival. The town was plundered by the Turks in 1837, and during the course of the subsequent troubles the Persians were first admitted into the town by the Muhaisin in 1841. Their subequent right of possession was strongly disputed by the Turks, but by the treaty of Erzerum (1847), owing mostly to the support of England and Russia, Muhammareh was left, and has ever remained, in Persians hands. Much had feeling has been induced between the Persians and Turks in these parts, on this account, for the latter have shown themselves jealous of the intrusion of any other power upon the Shatt-al-'Arab, and still more so of the rising fortunes of Muhammareh town. At a later date Muhammareh cut a somewhat inglorious figure in the Anglo-Persian M ar of 1857, when it was hastily fortified by the Per sians and was incontinently shelled from the river by 6 British men-of-war. The Persians, whose army consisted of 13,000 men under prince Khanlar, had erected 4 batteries on the mainland, and 5 on the opposite side of the river on 'Abbadan island, with casemated batteries exceedingly well placed. The north fort on the point west of Muhammareh was one of the best, and this was the one with which our men-of-war were principally engaged. It consisted (as did all the others) of a well con structed parapet, made of layers of date leaves and clay, well rammed and bound together. This battery had nine embrasures ; the others had from five to three each. These embrasures were constructed at then- mouths, of date-tree trunks, fastened together. Most of the batteries were open at the gorge, the ground in the interior being covered with pits dug as shell traps. With the exception of these, there are no other defences near Muhammareh. The British force was composed of 5,000 men with 12 guns, 4 armed steamers, and two sloops of war. At daybreak on 26th March 1857 the British guns opened fire upon the Persian batteries, which were silenced in less than an hour. The troopships then advanced passed the batteries am,id musketry fire, and landed the troops under Sir II. Havelock. These drove the Persians out of the batteries (where alone any of the enemy showed fight), and advanced through the palm-grove to wards the camp where the main Persian army was entrenched. The latterMUH—MUII 744 fled precipitately, abandoning their tents, stores, ammunition, and 16 guns. For this the Persian officers were afterwards publicly disgraced by order of the Shah, being dragged along the ranks by rings through their noses, beaten, and cast into prison. Their leader, Khanlar Mirza, however, having made a present of £8,000 to the Prime Minister, received a sword and a robe of honour. The camp of the second division of the British-Persian Expeditionary Force was pitched in 1857 on the open ground, at a distance of about 1,300 yards south of the Haffar, facing the north, the prevailing winds being east and west. In 1870 the Shah ordered the construction of fortifications round the town, and a mud wall, 12 feet in height and 2 feet in thickness, was built, but soon succumbed to the action of the wind and rain. The only sort of defence which Muhammareh now possesses (1905), be sides the miserable battery already mentioned of 5 miscellaneous brass field- pieces, overlooking the river towards the eastern end of the town, is a ruinous mud wall upon the landward side, which was built by the Persians in 1858 and suffered severely in the floods of 1896 : it runs at an unnecessary distance from the town, and its perimeter is so great in proportion to any force which the Persian Government could place at Muhammareh, as to render it value less even should it be repaired. The only representatives of the Persian army at Muhammareh are two artillery officers, with a dozen privates under them, who are in charge of the guns and of arsenal that exists, at least in name. The Sheikh of Muhammareh is constantly at feud with his Bakhtiari neighbours. In November 1910 he collected an army of 10,000 against Farhan Asadj Bakhtiari. He has been permitted to import rifles, etc., by the Indian Government and in January 1913 possessed 8,000 rifles—a number which has been recently increased—and also some machine guns. It is estimated that he could raise a force of 30,000 men if provoked to fight by the Bakhtiari. TnJiabitants.—l^he: inhabitants of Muhammareh are chiefly local Arabs belonging to the Hilalat, Bait Kansan and Mutur divisions of the Muhaisin tribe ; but there are also numerous Arabs descended from Bahraini refugees, some natives of Dizful and Shushtar, a few merchants froirr other parts of Persia, about 40 families of Sabians, and a handful of Jews and oriental Christians. The total population is computed at 12,000. Selby found the Arabs of Muhammareh to be more active and less bigoted than the Turks. Accommodation for travellers is afforded by seven Husainlehs. These are buildings primarily set apart for the readings and lamentations which are obligatory on ShFahs at the Muharram, and as refuges for destitute strangers and pilgrims, but also serving as inns ; in one of them superior rooms can be had on payment. There are some Khans in Muhammareh, but these, instead of being hostelries, as in Turkish Arabia, are merely places of business, or warehouses where merchants store their go'ods. Trade and Industries .—Of the varied ingredients that form the population of Muhammareh, the Bahrainis are mostly sma ll shop-keepers and mechanics ; the Sabians are silver-smiths ; the Jews deal in Manchester goods ; and the Christians are clerks or lightermen. There are also two or three gunsmiths who repair rifles and revolvers. 3 g 29Hi^BHI^B0 745 MUH—MUII Muhammareh can now boast of five large bazars containing over 300 shops and of a grain-market^ and large stoc ks of riceand dates are generally available. But more important than the local trade or industries of Muhaim march are its foreign commerce and its functions as a port. Of the foreign trade nominally belonging to Muhammareh, by far the greater part really depends on places upon the Karun and up-country. The town is accessible to ocean-going steamers ; but, owing to the narrowness of the Karun and the consequent difficulty of swinging, they discharge their cargoes without leaving the Shatt-al-'Arab, opposite the village of Ma’muri. Cargoes, etc., are transhipped at Muhammareh to the river steamer of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, and conveyed thus to Bandar Nasiri. The steamers of the British India Company call weekly at Muhammareh from Bombay, and those of the Bombay and Persia Company occasionally, and in 1903 the town was visited, in addition to those, by 35 British and 4 Russian steamefs from Europe. In 1904, 19 steamers with cargo direct from Europe called, and of these 5 took cargo for Europe. The total number of English boats which entered by sea in 1904 was 87, of which 63 cleared; and of other nationalities 3 entered and 1 cleared. One river-steamer runs fortnightly to Bandar Nasiri (Ahwaz) in connection with the Ahwaz- Shushtar steamer. The freight from Muhammareh to Bandar Nasiri is 40 krans (Rs. 10) per ton. The freight to London is from £1 to £1-7-0 per ton. The rate of exchange varies from about 56 krans to 59 krans to £1, or an average value of 4d. per kran. The following is a table of the chief articles of import and export at Muhammareh :— Branch of Imperial Bank of Persia opened, 1909. Expobts. IMPORTS; Exported to Description.

He exercises control over the once powerful tribe of Ka'b Arabs {vide this Gazetteer), whose headquarters are at Fallahieh. His position was, however, considerably weakened when in 1902, the control of the customs of the port was transferred to that of the new Belgian administrators, in exchange for a subsidy. The administrative arrangements and political interests of Muhammareh, being part of those of Southern 'Arabistan of which it is the capital, are described in the article on that province {vide this Gazetteer—'Arabistan, Southern). The town is nominally governed by a deputy of the Shaikh called the Naib-ul-Hukumeh, but in reality the Kais-ut-Tujjar wields greater powers ; all commercial cases are settled by him. Among private citizens, three Bahraini and two Shushtari Mujtahids are prominent. Climate .—Regarding the climate of Muhammareh writers have given widely varying descriptions. General Williams, in his report to Govern ment, dated 2-h'd October 1856, says : c&lt; The climate of Muhammareh from June to October is very deadly to Europeans, but during the remainder of the year it is well adapted to the operations of war/' Sir Henry Rawlinson agrees in this estimate, saying the climate is so pestilential, that the mortality among those who are obliged from any cause to reside in it during the hot season amounts to about 50 per cent. The cause of this unhealthi ness is the marsh malaria produced by the decomposition of vegetable matters under a burning sun, added to the great humidity of the atmosphere in the immediate vicinity of the sea.' L/aptain Holland remarks on the salubrity of Muhammareh as follows :— Accounts seem so contradictory as to the salubrity or otherwise of the c imate during the hot season, that it would be impossible to form an opinion without personal experience. During the period the army have been encamped here, viz., the month of April 1857, it was very healthy, the sick of the force averaging only from 2 to 3 per cent. The thermometer during the heat of the day ranged from 75° to 93°. The soil seems to retain moisture from the continued decomposition of both animal and vegetable matter, as m the Indus and Nile, and in all deltas formed by deposits from rivers. _ The miasma arising from such a soil in the hot season alone would be sufficient cause for fever. All accounts seem to coincide as regards the salubrity of the place during the cold season, viz., from the beginning of October to the end of March.' Captain Selby, however, entertains a different opinion from the rest of our authorities regarding the salubrity of this place. “ Besides,' he says, the advantages which Muhammareh, considered either as a military post or commercial city, possesses, its great salubrity is of vast importance in a country so low and flat as the delta of the Euphrates ; and I am enabled, Irom a personal knowledgeof it for some years, to bear witness to its superior- ity m this respect oyer any other part of the adjacent country ; so much so that when, durmg the hot months, duty called.me from Baghdad to the own ot Basrah or its vicinity, I invariably remained at or near Mu- hammareh ; to which, in a great measure, I attribute the entire absence of that deadly fever which committed such havoc in the second expedition undei ( aptain Lynch, at its outset, and which can only be ascribed to itsMUH—MUH 7 50' havb een compelled to remain so long at Basrah. I may further adduce a* a pi oof that, during the fifteen months I commanded the steamers Euph- • ateS and Ass 2/ na &gt; 1 on ly ost two men—one from an accident, the other in consequence of a chronic disease of seven years standing.- Curzon mentions a report that 40 per cent, of the then 2,000 inhabitants were swept away by cholera in 1889; and in June and July 1904 this disease was epidemic in Muhammareh, so much so that many of the meichants left the town and business was at a standstill; the disease spread through the province, which was not clear of it until the end of November T he insanitary state of the town no doubt accounts for much sickness which is attributed to “climate.” l lv nes.s There was another bad outbreak ot cholera in 1911.

Cattle could be obtained during the latter period. ^ Salt, which is recovered from pits near the Karun River, but which con tains a* certain amount of saltpetre, is obtainable in Muhanjmareh. There is only one flour mill in Muhammareh, it is said to be capable of turning out 480 lbs. daily, but has not yet been working; all other flour is produced by hand mills. There are good water mills at Shushtar whence plentiful supplies of flour could be obtained with notice. The water of the Karun is excellent for drinking purposes; it is apt to be thick during the high season, i.e., from January to May, but it quickly settles, and is at all times quite wholesome. Drinking water should always be taken from the Karun River, and not from the canals leading inland off it. Labour and Material Available. 1. (a) Carpenters .—There are about 50 carpenters, of whom 20 are efficient and 30 are under-carpenters called “ shagirds.” There is also a head carpenter who undertakes to supply carpenters and estimates and takes wood work on contract. (b) Smiths. —There are ten iron smiths. Their work is however very indifferent. • j (c) Brickmakers. —About 20 brickmakers. There are 10 kilns in and around | \ uhammareh each of which turns out about 40,000 bricks at a time. Each kiln is conducted by 2 brickmakers and 10 assistants. (d) Bricklayers. —About 40 bricklayers. Good. (e) Masons. —About 15 masons. Good. 2. Contractors are entirely unreliable. . , 3. 300—500 coolies could be obtained at any time, except during the date-picking season from September to November. They are slow and can not work for long hours. Women coolies however can be obtained from Basrah in good numbers, who carry more weights, put in more hours and claim less wages. # , 4. (a) Timber. —There is an Armenian who imports Russian wood (Deal). About 1,000 kurjis (20 planks equal 1 kurji) can always be obtain ed. Teak wood and Java wood can be obtained from a Baghdadi merchant, named Rafuli, who is himself at Basrah but keeps an agent here. (6) Bricks. —Must be ordered beforehand. In June, July and August about 20,000 bricks can be obtained at a time. But at Abdul Khassif bricks can be obtained in large quantities during, all months except in winter.MUII—MTJH 752 (c) Mope .-—Not made ‘locally. Imported from India.

J land. (5) Roofing. —First poles (chandals), then mats, over which reed and a plaster made of mud and chopped straw. Many years ago Lieutenant Selby, after a careful examination of the river, pointed out that the advantages of the situation of Muhammareh are that the Karim lies to its north-east; the Shatt-al-'Arab to its south-west; its inhabitants (Arabs) are more active and less bigoted than the Turks; its situation is more salubrious than that of Basrah; and its water (Karun), cool and invigorating. In our hands he considered that it would become the emporium of trade between Armenia, Arabia, Persia, and India. Communication.- —Three main routes leave Muhammareh. (1) Muhammareh-Ahwaz-Isfahan through the Bakhtiari hills, 374 miles^ 24 stages. There is a saving of time in this route compared with that from Bushire. Should sufficient caravans pass to keep the snow beaten down, ' there is no reason why this road should be closed in winter as it now is. (2) Muhammareh-Dizful-Khurramabad, 330 miles, 25 stages. The post runs by this route, but it is often unsafe for merchandise on account of the lawlessness of the tribes between Dizful and Khurramabad. In 1904 the post courier was frequently stopped and relieved of part of his mails. The Shushtar-Dizful road is also sometimes unsafe, especially in the summer months, when the Bakhtiari are in the mountains.

A shallow pond lies close by, with numerous springs bubbling up through the gravelly bottom.— (Maunsell, August 1888.) (?;) The course of the Mud River, known in its upper reaches successively as the Waz and Kara Aghach, was for long unmapped, but surveys by Lieutenant Crookshank, R.E., in 1900-02 and by Lieutenant M ilson in 1911, covering practically the whole of its course, now enable it to be des cribed with accuracy. The existence of up-to-date degree sheets of this part of the country renders any detailed narrative of its course superfluous. It is sufficient to say that it rises in ths mountains north of Khan-I-Zmian at a place called Bun Rud, it then flows south-south-east past Aiur to Kavar, its waters being utilized for irrigation at many points from Khan-i-Zinian to Pas-i-Rudak in the Dizgah plain. It enters the Kavar plain by a defile, in which an ancient stone dam built for irrigation purposes exists, thence it flows down the Kavar-Khafr valley to Taduan, where it cuts through the end of the Kuh-i-Safid by a remarkable gorge and, after a circuitous course amongst the mountains of the Simakan district, emerges to the desolate Manyun valley (20 miles west of Jahrum) where it is joined by the lasa stream (practically dry in summer), by the Maimand stream, and, a little further down, by a fresh water river rising west of the deserted hill fort of Galat-i-Zangibar, and flowing past the walled village of Madkhun in a narrow gorge. It obtains access to the Qlr-o-Karzin plain, which it waters very completely, by a very narrow and precipitous gorge through the moun tains, part of which is quite impassable even on foot. For some way after this it can be followed on horse or foot, through the plains of Afzar and Laghar-o-Maku, through the Tang-i-Shahriyaii to Kupkab, near Gird Bisheh, where the valley is about 3 miles broad. Its course now becomes impassable for some miles until it emerges on to the Dizgah plain, where it is joined by—ysr mum—mum (2) the * Alamarvdasht and Fidah stream, one branch rising a few miles south of Lar, another branch, shown in Lieutenant Crook- shank’s maps as running through the Tang-i-Khur, appearing to drain the neighbourhood of Khunj, Bukhard and Binaru, though this is doubtful, local report stating that the surplus waters of these places accumulate in a marsh, dry in summer, south-west of Khunj ; (3) the Shur river, a salt stream, rising in the Khwajai district, north of Firuzabad ; this tributary greatly exceeds the main stream in volume and is for the greater part of the year quite unfordable ; below the junction the waters of the Mund, by which name the stream then becomes known, are too salt to be of use for irriga tion ; ^ (4) the Jam and Riz stream, fresh, but dry for 8 months in the year. It will be seen from the above survey of the river and its tributaries that it drains a very wide area ; the comparatively small volume of its waters is due to the fact that its basin embraces no lofty ranges, except perhaps the Kuh-i-Safid. It is also eloquent of the small rainfall of Laris- tan that the 'Alamarvdasht tributary, though 200 miles long, and with a basin as large as that of many an English river, is quite dry for 8 months in the year. 16. The Kara Aghach river is or was bridged at the following points (1) . Khan-i-Zinlan. (2) Ravar (bridge in ruins). (3) Qir-o-Karzin plain. The Pul-i-Arus, a two-storied bridge, the road way being in the upper storey : this was seen by Abbott in 1873, but not by Wilson in 1911. (4) Near Baghan. Remains of an ancient bridge. The river is useless for navigation, it is fordable except in flood time even at its mouth, where the depth at low water does not usually exceed It can be ascended by native craft of 40 tons burden almost as far as Kaki. Khur Ziarat, which forms its mouth, is a small creek with low banks which can be entered at high water, but the entrance is exposed and does not form a good harbour for native craft. For a short distance to the north of it, and for some miles southward, the coast of the mainland is swampy. This river, the Kara Aghach in its upper reaches, and the Mund in the lower part of its course, was known to the ancients as the Sitakus or Sition- agus ; the earliest mention of it is made by Arrian (in his “Indica,” chapter 38), who quotes from Alexander's admiral, Nearchos, who made the voyage from the Indus to the Euphrates. Next comes Ptolemy (second century A.D.), whose knowdedge of the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf w T as evidently based on log-books from the time of the Ptolemean dynasty in Egypt and the first Roman Emperors. The Arabic Geographers knew the river well and described its course with great accuracy, as is exemplified by Ishta- khris ‘‘Kitdb-ul Matkdlik Wal Masalik.” It was Colonel Ross, however, who ; in his report on the administration of the Persian Gulf ResidencyMUN—MUQ 758 for 1877-1878^ placed beyond all doubt the identity of the Kara Aghach with the Mund river.— (Ross — Crooksliank, 1902 — Wilson, 1911.)

The south ^ide of the bay is low and rocky, is fringed with date plantations, and has hills behind it rising to a height of some hundreds of feet. The east end is low and sandy with patches of swamp, and forms the mouth of the great valley which composes the Garbandi district. On the north side are an anchorage and fishing-ground off Bidkhun village, which are protected by a sandy point with a reef extending off it. The only pearl banks of any value on the Persian coast are about It as Naband, the southern entrance point ot the bay; diving is carried on but is not remunerative.

A village in northern ^Arabistan on the Shushtar-Dizful road, 16 miles north-west of Shushtar. The land in its neighbourhood is the property of Muhammad Javad Khan, Muntazam-ud-Dauleh, a Bakhtiari Khan. It is composed of 60 mud huts of Haft Lang Bakhtiarls. There is a small fort, and 200 yards to the north are a few knar trees, while 6.00 yards to the south, on the road, is a built-over well of fresh water. In the hot weather Arabs under Shaikh Farhan Asad of the Kathir come here for pasturage, and sink shallow wells in a dry water-course beside the village. PERSEPOLIS or TAKHT-I-JAMSHlD— Lat. 29 d 58' N.; Long. 52° 54' E.; Elev. 5,500'. Situated on the plain of Marvdasht, some 40 miles north-east of Shiraz, and not far from where the river Pulvar flows into the Kur. The central structure is a large terrace with its east side resting on the Kuh-i-Rahmat. The other three sides are formed by a retaining wall, varying in height from 14 to 41 feet ; and on the west side a magnificent double stair leads to the top. On this terrace stand and lie the ruins of a number of colossal buildingsPER—PER 784 all constructed of calcareous limestone, resembling marble, hewn from the neighbouring mountain. These ruins, for which the name Chehil Minar can be traced back to the 13th century, are now known as the Takht-i-Jam- x- 11 th e y represent the Istakhr or Persepolis, captured and par tially destroyed by Alexander the Great, is beyond dispute. It has been ascertained from the inscriptions that some of the edifices are the work of D / n ^ I ^ XerXeS l an ^ rtexerxes IIL The ruins on the P^tform consist of—(!) The porch of Xerxes; ( 2 ) Hall of Xerxes; ( 3 ) Palace of Darius; ( 4 ) ^ w f T S III; i, 5) Palace of Xer *es; ( 6 ) South-east edifice . (7) Hall of 100 columns. Behind the Takht-i-Jamshid are three tombs •lT n of ^6 rock in the hillside, the faCades being rifchly ornamented lh 7 are . Probably those of Artaxerxes II, B.C. 361, Artaxerxes III B.C. 338 and Darius III, B.C. 330. Beneath the ruins are a large number of underground passages, which, it is conjectured were oriffinally used as water-channels. J About 2 miles distant from the Takht-i-Jamshld, near the north-eastern extremity of the plain and close to the post-house of Piizeh-i-Takht-i- Jamshid, m a small natural recess in the base of the cliff, are situated the sculptures of the Naksh-i-Rajab. They were mutilated by order of the bhah Safi I to discourage European visitors. The tablets consist of (11 and ( 2 ) Ormuz and Ardeshir, (3) Shapur and body-guard. On the opposite side of the Pulvar and at the western extremity of the Husmn Kun rises a perpendicular wall of rock, called by the Persians the - iNaksh-i-Rustam. The sculptures can be seen from the post-house of Puzeh, which is about 1± miles distant. There are seven bas-reliefs at the ?o a n kS ^ RU S I Sr (1) Ver 1 a t ian and queen; (2) and (3) Equestrian combats, 390 A.R; ( 4 ) Shapur and Valerian, 260 A.D.; (5) Equestrian combat; ( 6 ) Verahan II ami his courtiers; (7) Ormuz and Ardeshir. Hewn out of the rock of the cliff are four tombs. From the inscription it is known that the second from the east is that of the Great Darius, B.C. 485. The others are probably the tombs of Xerxes, B.C. 465, Artaxerxes I, B.C. 424 and Darius II, B.C. 405. Opposite the third and fourth tombs,’ on a slight elevation, rises a square building called at various times the Naqqareh Jkhaneh and the Kaa beh-i-Zardusht. Its origin is problematical. The surviving, ruins of Istakhr, in which were the bazars, etc., fall into two groups—those on the banks of the Pulvar, a little before it emerges into the plam of Marvdasht between Persepolis and the Naksh-i-Rustam, and those of the hill fortress on the central, pointed hill of the Seh Gumbadan situated some 7-8 miles north-west of the Takht-i-Jamshld, on the adjoining plain of Khafrak. The former consist of a great gateway, and the remains li a i Vl 6 6 ^ Hajiabad, which was used in later times as a mosque • the lattCT of the rums of the citadel, a gateway, and three reservoirs. In tlm 10 th century Istakhr had become an utterly insignificant place and during the following centuries it gradually declined until, as a city it leased to exist. J ’ One mile north of Hajiabad the cliff is pierced by several natural ca verns. In the entrance of one of these, known as the Tang-i-Shah-Sar-van are five tablets, two of which bear inscriptions, containing the celebrated bi-hngual epigraph of Shapur I.— ( (-urzon—Ar but knot, 1905)f 785 PIA—PIR Pi AD E H R1H—L at.

The village consists ofPIR—PIS 786 iCT) 40 houses terraced on the hillside, the roof of one tier forming the open space in front of the tier above. It belongs to the Taifeh-i-Talmur of the Chehar Lang Bakhtiari, who are, however, under the administration of the Ilkhanl. The village is on the main track to the garmslrs round about Bizful. Sar Sahid is occupied summer and winter, and dates its birth from about 1883. Snow is said to lie deep in winter. The stream upon which it stands flows into the Baba, and later, being joined by the Gukun, it finally flows into the Diz river. The inhabitants live chiefly on excellent bread made from acorns. They are poorly clad, but are good-looking, able- bodied men and women. From two different and fairly trustworthy sources the stages to Dizful from here are given as below.

One of the three main divisions of Luristan {q.v). It is bounded on the south by the Saidmarreh river; on the west by the districts of Harsin, Hulailan and Kangawar, comprised in the province of Kir- manshah; on the east by the Kashgan river and the lands occupied by the Bairanwand north of Khurramabad; and on the north by the Kuh-i-Garru, which forms the boundary between Luristan, and the districts of Kangawar,•787 pis-^pul Nihawand and Shakhdr Pain. On the Khurramabad-Kirmartshah road (route 18) the Gashur pass, 7 miles east of Harsin, is the boundary. Tlsh-i-Kuh has been, from time immemorial, the abode of the Silsileh and Dilfan divisions (so named, it is said, from two brothers). They are mostly Lakks, but there is a considerable number of Pairs in the Eastern part of the district, speaking a distinct dialect, though differing in no other way from their Lakk neighbours. In Pisk-i-Kuh the sandstones and gypsums disappear, being seldom met with north of the Saidmarreh valley; gaunt limestone ranges, almost devoid of wood, south and east of a line drawn from Tarhan to Madian Kud take their place: these ranges run uniformly north-west and south-east, separated by broad grassy valleys: they attain about 6 , 000 ' in height. A feature of the district is the extent and fertility of the intervening plains, such as Kuh-i-Dasht, Rumisgan, Hulailan and Tarhan, which could support a large population. •* V ' (JVilson, 1911.)

PUL-I-KALHUR— A ruined bridge over the Kashgan river in Lurrstan. It is thus de scribed by Wilson (1913). Three hours across shale hummocks and rocky foothills, mostly on foot, brought us to the ruins of Pul-i-Kalhur. This bridge has never, I believe, been visited by European before : De Morgan's brief reference to it looks as if he had only heard of it from native information j had he visited it personally he would scarcely have missed the inscription. The bridge stands in a narrow precipitous gorge scarcely 100 ' wide : it consisted origi- nally of a simple central span 60 f wide, with several subsidiary arches : the piers of the main span are still intact and are over 30' high ; they closely resemble in construction the piers of the ruined bridges at Pul-i-Kashgan and Pul-i-Khirsdar or Kurr-o-Dukhtar ; the Pul-i-Kalhur is, however, unique m one respect: at the top of the southern bridge head placed some 12 ' high above a causeway cut into the rock, is an inscription in cufic charac ters, consisting of some 8 lines, forming a tablet about 2 ' square : it doubtless records some details as to the construction of the bridge. A photograph was taken of it by Douglas who scrambled up the rock opposite till he was evel with and only 15 feet away from it : the date of construction of these ndge&amp; is at present quite unknown and this inscription, if decipherable, may be of considerable archaeological interest. w Tlie n Ce ” er ^ roun(i Pul-i-Kalhur surpasses anything I have seen in South- West Persia : fine trees, abundant vegetation, cliffs rising up 1,000 to 1,500' vertically on either side of the gorge (which is only 100 yards through), whilst in the centre stand the ruins of the bridge.

The conjoint streams form a deep wide pool below the bridge. It is a bridge whereby the Shiraz and Isfahan road crosses the Ranjird river, 26 miles north of Shiraz; made of stone and cement with brick super structure, now partially ruined. Spans are 26' above normal floor and 13' wide; there is also a third small span, 10' high and 9' wide.— (Morier — MacGregor — Curzon, 1889 — Wilson, 1907.) PUL-I-KUL— Lat.

There is an old ruined caravanserai here and a few huts with a little cultivation. The Pul-i-Murd is named after the extraordinarily fine myrtle that flour ishes in groves near at hand. Oleander and wild almond too flourish in this narrow valley, shut in and protected as it is from winter blasts. Ihe people of this side of Behbehan are totally different in appearance from the Bakh- tiari, the fine-drawn Arab, or the flat-faced Kuhgalu Lurs one is accustomed to see.

It rises to the north-west of Deh Bid, and flows with many remarkable changes of direction in a course generally south and south-west. The caravan route from Shiraz to Isfahan crosses it by a broad masonry bridge of 5 arches, near the old serai of Khan i-Kargian between Deh Bid and Mashed-i-Murghab. The river on its way waters the plains of Murghab, Marvdasht and Haji- abad. Turning south-south-west of river the road coincides through the Tang-i-Bulakai {q.v.). It is crossed again by the road between Qiivvamabad and Savand, 64 miles from Shiraz. An old masonry bridge, which formerly spanned the river here, is now in ruins, and a ford, barely passable by infan try, replaces it. Newcomen reports the river as running strong and reach ing to his saddle. flaps when he crossed. The Pulvar finally falls into the Band Amir at Pul-i-Khan about 30 miles north of Siraz.

The Vardalan Pass is impracticable for wheeled traffic or held artillery. From Charduvur a track ascends a fairly considerable ridge; at a distance of one geographical mile from the defile of Nianun it descends into the valley Passing the defile it ascends the slopes of the Mamsht Mountain, the summit of which towers above some 2,000-3,000 feet, and eventually again descends into the valley, where a building has been constructed m the form of a caravanserai named Kakh or more generally Deh Fala. the Khan spends the winter here in tents, the locality being known as Amaleh. From here an easy road or rather pathway leads to Khurramabad and meets a road from Khurramabad to Dizful, whence an enemy could execute a flank movement and attack with the co-operation of the Lurs of Pusht-i-Kuh, operating on the flank of an army moving south along the main line of communication. ^ . Hence this region acquires a certain importance. Ihe locality genera y is practicable for operations of a detachment of infantry, cavalry and moun tain artillery with pack transport. Supplies and forage are obtainable locally, but not in any great quantity. From an adjacent peak a general view of the Pusht-i-Kuh region is obtained. Lower down to the south-west, there is an important pass, the ‘ Ban-i-Sir over which runs the road from Deh Bala to the lowlands on the Turkish frontier. , , Both in character and mode of life the inhabitants resemble the other tribes of Luristan. PUSHT-I-KUH (2) — One of the two main divisions of the Kuhgalu Lurs. For a description see the article Kuhgalu. PUSHT-I-KUH (3)— One of the three divisions of the province of Luristan. It is bounded on the south by the Turko-Persian frontier, and extends as far west as'Mandah) and the Ab-i-Kangir; on the north it extends to the Saidmarreh river, on the west to the Kalhur country, and on the east the Karkheh. In Pusht-i-Kuh, the hills, which rise in tier upon tier, parallel to each other, are lower and less steep than elsewhere in Luristan; gypsums an sandstones predominate : the limestone hills are isolated folds only, the intervening country being filled with shapeless masses of gypsum, grey m colour, contrasting strongly with the red tint of the sandstones. Its rivers are for the most part almost unpotable in summer, and its drainage is to wards the Mesopotamian plain. It is not well-wooded, and the giazing i’ not so good as in Luristan.

QAIS ISLAND— Lat. 26° 32' 44' N. ; Long. 53° 54' 25' E. An island in the Persian Gulf ; still of considerable and in former times of great importance ; it is situated 11 miles off the coast of the Shibkuh dis trict, slightly nearer to Chlru than to Charak, .being divided from the main land by a fine channel from 20 to 30 fathoms deep. Qais, in its conforma tion resembles an oval, and slightly convex stud : it measures about 10 miles in length from west to east by 4| in breadth, and rises from the coast to a plateau in the interior which is 120 feet above sea-level. The shores of the island are low and the beach sandy with rocky points; eastwards and westwards Qais ends in very low cliffs. The island is encompassed .by a reef which is nowhere more than a mile broad and has deep water immediately outside it. The general colour of the island is a light brown and is bare of vegetation, except a few scattered date-groves and someQAI-QAI 796 stunted herbs. The water-level is high, and near the beach, in the locality called Sar Masheh, sweet water can be obtained by digging to a depth of between 1 and 4 feet. The island contains the following villages :— Name. P osition. Houses and inhabitants. Remaeks.

There is a water cistern here. Animals are: 8 donkeys, 2 cattle, 10 sheep and goats. Date-palms number 40. There are 10 donkeys, 10 cattle, 30 sheep and goats, 1,700 date trees and 5 fish ing boats. , There are thus in all about 450 houses and the total population may be estimated at 2,250 souls, chiefly of the Al ’Ali tribe They possess only a score of modern rifles among them. Some cultivation of dates, wheat and barley is carried on by means of irrigation from wells; onions, cu cumbers 'water-melons and musk-melons are also grown ; but the principal resources are fishing and pearling. In summer the population is consider ably increased by an influx from the Arabian and Persian coasts generally. There are 26 large pearl-boats which go to the pearl-banks on the Arabian side in the season, and 67 small baqarehs and sku’ais which are used for fishing in water, and in summer for pearling off the coast of the island itself ; there is also some general trade. To th 6 island belong 3 trading baqhlahs which make voyages to Basrah, Bahrain, India and even Uman. The bazar at Masheh contains about 50 shops and 9 commercial ware houses. About 20 Hindus, British subjects, are settled here as shop-keepers and pearl merchants, while about 10 more sojourn temporarily in the island during the pearl season. Pearl-boats working in the vicinity call at Masheh twice or thrice during the diving-season, to dispose of their takings and replenish their stock of provision and water, dais island was till lately understood to belong to the Shaikh of Chai ak, who is locallv represented by an agent or deputy, at the present time, his nephew. The residence of the deputy is a fort built about 1900 A.D. at Sar Masheh. The com parative wealth of the Shaikh of Charak is attributed to his possession ot dais. Towards the end of 1906, however, it became known that the Quv- vam-ul-Mulk of Shiraz and his family claim absolute ownership over the island. . , From the antiquarian standpoint dais is interesting on account of its ruins, probably those of ancient Muhammadan town of Harireh, which lines the northern coast for about half a mile midway between the villages of Deh and Safih These ruins are of less extent than the supposed nuns of Siraf at Tahiri, and consist now merely of mounds of stone and fragments of masonry. A mosque, however, which was of well-cut stone, had one minaret standing until about 50 years ago; the pillars of this mosque were octagonal in section, and the blocks of which they were composed were mortised together by central tenons. There are remains of several hugeQAI—QAR 798 oblong water-reservoirs formerly vaulted over, two of which measured 150 feet by 40 feet and in 1857 were still 24 feet deep. Near these began a fine qanat nearly half a mile in length, cut in the solid rock and running at its deeper end 20 feet beneath the surface : it had about 40 shafts at intervals of 15 to 20 yards apart, and the bottom of the shaft was acces sible in four instances by a stairway of shallow steps cut in the rock. Qais suffered severely from the depredations of Arab pirates at the beginning of the nineteenth century, and a British military station for a time existed here.— [Persian Gulf Gazeetter, 1908.)

QASABAT-UN-NASSAR—QASABAT. QASHQAl— IJISTORY. This tribe springs from the great Turkish Khalaj tribe, which settled in Asia Minor during the Middle Ages. At the end of the fourteenth century, when Timur removed the Khalaj from Asia to Central and Eastern Persia, many of them fled and settled in Ears, and were [called Qach-qaz^.e., those who ran away” (from qachmak — WzG) . Another tradition has i a Ilulagu Kh an brought them from Kashgar. .... i. v In course of time the original band became divided into two parts, because a large section retained the habit of migration. One part kept the Im m- man appellation of f Khalach/ the other was called Qashqai. I he bhis buluki and Earsimadan are the only clans now stated to be Khalach ’ in There are few records of the history of the Qashqals from the time of then settlement in Ears, after the invasion of Jenghiz Khan, to the enc o eighteenth century, when the a Turks” were, according to ia i , number of nomad units without central organisation. Sasan Khan and his brother Isma'il Khan of the Shahdou (ShamM branch are said to have been “ confidential advisers of the gieat Ka Khan, Zend, monarch of Southern Persia in 1760 ^ ^ a ii Jani Khan, son of Ismafil Khan, is credited with having consolidated a clans of the Qashqai, and he acquired the title of andlatet o ’ besides inheriting the leadership of the Qashqais, while his mfluence have been considerable with the Qajar Prince Governors ot 1 ais.QAS—QAS 800 second son, Mnhammad 'Ali Khan, second lUJtani, m&amp;rriedi the daughter of Prince Firman Firma, son of Fath 'Ali Shah in 1824, and evidently was a power in Fars. After a quarrel with his father-in-law in 1829 (?) he took the whole II (tribe) away with him to the province of Kirman. Minuchehr Khan, Wazir of Fars, sent him to Tehran in 1832, whence he returned only in 1874. His eldest son, who became Ilbegl, married a daughter of His Ala jest y Muhammad Shah, and was given high command; and his brother- in-law, Prince Mutamid-ud-Dauleh protected the tribal chiefs. Various members of the ruling family have at different periods been up in armskgainst the Government: the third son of the first IWidnl was in rebel lion in Qir and Karzin in 1831, and died in imprisonment at Shiraz the same year. Though the fourth son of the first IWiahi, and grand-father of the present generation of Ilkhdnls, died fighting for His ftoyal Highness Fir man Firma at Kirman, Suhrab Khan, his son, got into trouble with the Government towards the end of his life, was taken to Tehran, and executed about 1873. Muhammad Quli Khan, third with a large body of tribesmen appeared on the plains of Dashtistan, to fight the British army in 1856, but according to Qashqai accounts scorned to serve under a Nuri commander- in-chief and deserted. He was known as “ The Great Ilkhdnl ”, and under him the Qashqai were a powerful and united tribe. He died in 1885. Sultan Muhammad Khan, fourth Ilkhdnl, was a weak ruler, without control: many of the smaller clans were ruined and absorbed by larger branches, and much of the Ilkhani’s power passed to the Ilbegi. Haji Nasrullah Khan, fifth Ilkhdnl, who had restored the power to the Ilkhdnl, and secured a firm hold over the tribe, left one son, whose defici encies and failings made him unfit to succeed his father, and the succession passed to the sons of Darab Khan, brother of Suhrah Khan. Haji Nasrul- laKs daughter was married to the present (1912) Quvvam-ul-Muik—a fact that has given rise to much of the hc/stility between the Ilkhdnl, Saulat-ud- Dauleh and the Quvvam^s adherents. In 1898 the eldest son of Darab Khan, Zergham-ud-Dauleh, succeeded as sixth Ilkhdnv. he was a man of fine stature and presence, and popular with the tribesmen, largely because of his leniency and indifference to the pay ment of revenue. His early death in 1905 may be attributed to ovel-indul- gence. During his life-time his full brother, Saulat-ud-Dauleh, had several times acted as ilbegi, and for a short period in 1902 replaced him as Ilkhdnl. About this period the late Quvvam-ul-Mulk had powerful influence in Fars: Prince ShuV-us-Sultaneh had humiliated him, and patronized Saulat-ud-Dauleh. No sooner had the prince vacated the Governor-Geperal- ship (in 1906) than Quvvam-ul-Mulk, left as Acting Governor-General, conferred the Ilkhdnl-ship of the Qashqals on Zaigham-ud-Dauleh, son of Darab Khan by a peasant wife. Saulat-ud-DauleKs supporters included Muhammad 'Ali Khan Kashkuli, his brothers, and Ayyaz Kiha Khan, Dara- shuri : with Zaigham were Muhammad Hasan Khan, Kashkuli, an enemy of SaulaFs, Agha Kiha Khan, Darashuri and Karim Khan of the Buir Ahmadi. A fight took place near Kudian. ZaighanFs force was routed and he had to flee from Fars. The bitter enmity between the Quvvam and a section of the Qashqais may be largely ascribed to this incident. Zaigham-ud-SOI QAS—QAS Daulelr’s full brother, All Khan is allied by marriage to the Bakhtmii Khans, and Zaigham and Quvvam found protection and support with them,. From 1907-10 Saulat-ud-Dauleh made good his position of authority in the // with remarkable force and success. He acted as his own Ilbegl, and proceeded to acquire by purchase or seizure, rich properties at 1 iruzabad, Farrashband, Jam, Qir and Karzin, etc. He became the richest magnate in Fars, and attached the large body of ’Amaleh to his own person. His in sistence on full payment of ( maliyat ’ by the tribes, alienated the sympathies of many chiefs of f Titshs k and his dismissal of K.cilufita,is } who inclined his displeasure, also did him harm. He completely crushed Ahmad Khan, ShishbulukT, father-in-law of Zaigham, who had become a man of importance. By 1910 he had fallen out with a chief supporter—Muhammad J Ali Khan, Kashkuli—and with the powerful Kaldntar of the Darashiiri. The II, how' ever, recovered its former cohesion and unity under his rule, and, much as he was disliked, he was undoubtedly greatly feared among the Qashqai for the advantages conferred on him by his wealth. The institution of so-called “ Constitutional Government ” had, by 1909, brought chaos into Fars affairs, and nullified the authority of the Governor- General, a situation of which the Qashqais and Saulat-ud-Hauleh were not slow to take advantage. They soon realized that their strength lay in their numbers, and in the opportunities for general arming provided by the arms traffic to Tangistan and Shibkuh ports. In 1909 Saulat-ud-Dauleh with a large force menaced Shiraz, partly on the ground that his enemies, the Qnv- vamis, were reactionaries, and himself desirous of setting up constitutional regime in Shiraz, but more particularly because he refused to allow ; Ala-ii(l- Dauleh to be sent as Governor-General. The same year he caused the caravan road to Bushire to be diverted to the Firuzabad route, which passes through Qashqai country, and undertook, for heavy remuneration from merchants, to protect caravans from robbery. In 1910 fresh trouble arose owing to the turbulence of the tribes and of Saulat, and to the fact that his Bakhtiari enemies were in power in Tehran, Zaigham-ud-Dauleh was sent back to Shiraz to reassume the lead of the tribe, but met with a cold reception from the Qashqais, and had to retire when the Governor-General espoused the cause of Saulat-ud-Dauleh. The Ilkhdni had in the spring declined orders to undertake responsibility for the “ Imperial ” caravan route via Kazarun, unless certain governorships, i.e., Kazarun and Behbehan, were given to him as appanages. He novy in the autumn returned to power, guaranteed the safety of the road, and his nomi nees were posted in Kazarun and Behbehan. The Farsimadan, however, broke loose from restraint on the downward migration, and created great destruction and havoc along a portion of the telegraph wires near Dasht-i- Arjin. The appointment of Nizam-us-Sultaneh as Governor-General of Fars was welcomed by Saulat-ud-Dauleh, whose interests and policy were in many respects similar to those of Nizam. In January 1911, together with Saula - us-Sultaneh, his younger brother, he took the unusual step of coming n BusKire with several hundred tribesmen to greet the new Governor- Genera . He had obliged the Khans of Borazjun, Ahmadi, and other places on ie main caravan route to pay him large monetary tribute. Kamarij s.ooQAS- QAS 802' in his way; and this place was coveted by the Kashkuli Khans also, whose winter-quarters march with the Kamarij district. After despatching a force of Qashqais to assist in Nizam's punishment of Tangistan, the Ilkhdnl turned some of his tribesmen on Kamarij, but gained little success. At the end of 1910 he had again undertaken responsibility for the security of the caravan route via Kazarun, and he sent Muhammad 'Ali Khan, Kashkuli, against the Mamassani tribes, authors of extensive robberies on the road. His relations with this Kaldntar were, however, far from cordial. In 1911, realizing that he had many enemies among his chiefs and relatives, Saulat-ud-Dauleh skilfully appointed Saulat-us-Sultaneh, his brother, as Ilbegi, with charge over the internal affairs of theQashqai: this was to keep his brother from intriguing against himself. At the end of April 1911 occurred the attack on the duvvam brothers by Nizam-us-Sultaneh, and the murder of the younger, in which the tribesmen were implicated, prob ably with the llkhani’s approval. It is undeniable that Saulat-ud-Dauleh had the power, when his pocket was properly compensated, and no intrigues were on foot against him, of maintaining order and security on the caravan route, for, apart from his successful guarantees of the Firuzabad and Jirreh routes, he substantially alleviated the position of merchants in Shiraz and Isfahan during the summer of 1911, by undertaking the protection of •caravans which passed up by the “Sarhad ' road through his tribal country to Qumisheh and Isfahan. When, however, the tribes returned to their downward migration in September 1911, Saulat-ud-Dauleh supplied a large force of riflemen to carry on Nizam's faction fight with Q,uvvam-ul-Mulk's adherents: but the successful irruption of the Khamseh II on behalf of the Quvvam party dealt a severe blow to Saulat-ud-Dauleh's prestige, and he retired to his property at Chah-i-Kazimeh in Qir and Karzin, taking with him the large Darashuri clan, instead of allowing them to proceed in the direction of Behbehan as usual. Saulat was removed from the llkhani- ship at the same time as Nizam was dismissed from the Governorship of Firs (November 1911), and the Government sent Zaigham-ud-Dauleh, with the title of Sardar Ihtisham, to take over the Ilkhani-shiip of the Qa- shqai. After the autumn migration of 1911 the executive power over the clans was wielded by the Ilbegi, Saulat-ud-Sultaneh (now Amir 'Ashair), who gathered together a number of the more important chiefs of clans at Farashband. In December 1911 occurred the attack on Mr. Smart and his escort of the 39th Central India Horse near Kazarun by the Kashkuli under Muhammad 'Ali Khan. The Ilkhdni was too weak to exact reparation, and disruption of the Qashqai tribes became almost complete. Robberies were very frequent. However, early in 1912, Zaigham-ud-Dauleh arrived at Kazarun with a non descript following, was joined by the Kashkuli Khans, hostile to Saulat- ud-Dauleh, and after a little hesitation most of the chief Kaldntars went •over to Zaigham. On April 23rd Zaigham, with a following of about 1,000 tribesmen marched against Saulat, and though he was joined by the Rasiri Arab tribe and a few Government troops with a mountain gun, nothing decisive resulted, as both sides were too careful not to come to blows. Saulat's following, however, among which was the Darashuri tribe, dispersed, and Sau’at fled to Firuzabad. On May 15th all the headmen of the Qashqai803 QAS-QAS tribe came into Shiraz to do homage to the Deputy Governor (Quvvam-ul- Mulk), an unprecedented occurrence. On August bth^ 1912, some adherents of Saulat blocked the road near Shiraz, and severely defeated a detachment the new Gendarmerie, which was sent against them. r l here was no force to send against Saulat and the situation deteriorated. In December Zai- gham, who had proved quite incapable of controlling the Qashqai, was re placed again by Saulat, on the recommendation of the new Governor-General, Mukhbii-us-Sultaneh. On December 12th, occurred the attack on a party of the 39th Central India Horse near Khan-i-Zinian, in which Captain Eckford was killed. The Kashkuli, especially Muhammad 'Ali Khan him self, was said to be implicated in this attack, in addition to Ijuii Ahmadi and Mamassani. It is noteworthy that there has been a general disposition for territorial aggrandisement on the part of the c Tirehs living near the caravan route. The Kashkulis in 1909 invaded the coast plain near Daliki to take forcible possession of the Mazara'eh district, and the Kashkuli Khans became Gover nors of Kazarun and the Shapur plain. They were watching every oppor tunity of seizing Kamarij from its present possessor, and their latest move (1912) has been to claim the sub-Government of Khisht, and encroach on the Khisht and Kunar Takhteh plain from the Mulla Anar pass and Mehlatun hills. They have allied to them the Dushman Ziari branch of the Kiihgala tribe, and have brought them as guards on to the upper part of the route near Shiraz : they are also in touch with leaders of the Buir Ahmadm The Farsimadan, whose camping-grounds lie to the east of the Kamarij plain, during the autumns of 1910 and 1911, showed themselves wantonly and intentionally destructive of telegraph property, between Khan-i-Zinian and Pul-i-Abgineh. Their Kaldntars were also trying to seize as personal property villages on the Kazarun plain. ETHNqGRArHT. Numbers .—Before the great famine of 1871 the Qashqai were said to number 50,000 tents, but in this year they suffered heavily both by actual famine, and by the dispersion it necessitated. In 1892 their numbers were estimated at 10,000 tents. Wilson says that in 1911, on very good author ity, they numbered 25,000 to 26,000. To this number must be added some 15.000 families of peasants, some of whom were once Qashqai nomads, but are now sedentary, and inhabit various districts mainly or wholly under Qashqai control. Chick in 1912 said that the actual numbers of the nomad units are about 40.000 tents, or families : their proteges (Bulvardi, etc.), allies, tenantry and cultivators of their lands may make an additional 10,000 families. If we reckon 5 persons to each family or tent, this makes a total of 300,000 tribespeople. The present Ilbegl (1912) estimated that the II numbered at least 500,000, while Saulat-ud-Dauleh stated to Mr. Chick that no one knew the exact numbers, and it was not to his interest to find out, on account of the Government poll-tax. (For numbers of fighting men see under Military.) Habitat .—No nomad tribe in Persia travels so far in their migrations as do the Qashqai, whose winter-quarters [Garnisir) extend to the immediate neighbourhood of Biz, Jam, and Galehdar in the south, their summer-size as jei*QAS-QAS 804 i quarters (Sardsir or Sarhad) being in the neighbourhood of Asupas ; Arsin- jan ; Ardakan and the Chehar and Shish Dangeh districts, parallel with, but west of, Yazdikhast, where they come into contact with the Arab tribes. Their most northerly summer camping-grounds are in the last two named districts. To the west they extend to within a few miles of Behbehan, this district being visited by the Darrehshuri section (who thus come into con tact with the Kuhgalu), whilst the Kashkuli come down to within a few miles of the sea on the borders of the Dashtistan district. They will not be found east of Afzar or the Qir-o-KarzIn plain, nor in the neighbourhood of Muba- rakabad or Jahrum, nor in the Kara Aghach valley from Kavar to Tadun, and never south of the mountains bordering the sea coast. In many cases the ‘ tireh 1 in its winter-quarters is divided and settled in distinct portions, far apart from one another. Thus the main body of the Kashkuli are settled in the Mehlatun hills, from Khishfc to Mishun, but another branch of the Kashkuli still proceeds each year to the f Bulak ’ of Qir-o-Karzin. There are Gelleh Zan Namadi between FaiTashband and Jirreh : there is another part of this clan in Hangam and Qlr. Ja’afarbegl are on the eastern border of the ‘ Buluk ’ of DashtI near Shunbeh, and also with the Ilkhdnl in Q,ir-o-Karzin. The following f Buluk 3 are occupied and overrun by the tribe during the winter months :— Khairabad (near Beh behan). Mishun and Bldkarz. The Mehlatun (Mailatun). Sbapip-. J irreh. TangarSm. Sar-mashad and Husain abad. Dehrud. FaiTashband. Famur. Kuh Marreh. Dehram. Hangam. Simakan. Qir-o-Karzin. Laghar and Makhgan. Duzdgah. Khunj. Afzar. Galchdar. ’ Alamarvdasht. dabftl Anaruyeh. Bidshahr. During their summer migration and residence the following ‘Buluk 3 are occupied by the tribe :— 'Siakh. Asupas. Hanna. Baiza. Diz-kurd. Simaran. Bamjird. Khusru Shinn. Nukhudan. Kam Firuz. Chehar Dungeh. Pa Hanna. Qumeir (Kuh Mihr) and Shish Nahlyeh. Kakan. A very large portion of Pars is therefore in the hands of, or connected with, the O&amp;shqals ; and the fettled population of those distridts, with the men left in charge of land under cultivation by the tribe, form a large addition to the numbers of the actual tribesmen. In many bases the settled villagers detest the tribesmen for plunder of the village flocks, oppression, destruction of their crops, and highway robbery. Migration .—The nomadic migration takes place twice a year, once up- country and once down, and varies to the extent of very few days. About the vernal equinox, or Nau Buz (middle of March), they commence to move slowly north: and they leave their northern pastures rather before the middle of September, and come back to their old camping-grounds in the south.805 QAS-QAS The migrations of the Qashqai differ little from those of other nomad tribes: mules are more used for transport purposes than is the case else- wherej and cattle are not extensively employed. The Qashqai are probably the nly tribe in South Persia, except the Arabs, who use camels for the pur pose. The principal route is that adopted by the Darreh Shuri, Kashkull, Farsimadan, and others, who, coming from Pehbehan, and the Mahur-i- Milati district, strike the Bushire-Shiraz post-road in the neighbourhood of Kazarun, and follow the general trend of this route as far as Dasht-i-Arjin and Khan-i-Zinian, whence they either proceed via Chanar-i-Rahdar, and cross the Shiraz plain to Guyum and Baiza, or move direct to Ardakan. From the latter point they disperse by various routes to their summer quarters. On their way down to the plains they follow the same routes, A few tribes use the Tang-i-Allahu Akbar north of Shiraz, but the majority prefer to keep well to the west of the town. Tribes coming from Galehdar, 'Ala Marvdasht, Afzal, etc., e.g., Shish-Buluki and the Ilkharin' &gt; followers, generally pass through Chanar-i-Rahdar on their way up-country. Any deviation from the customary lines of migration is most difficult for the larger tribes, and to block their upward path is not only the easiest, but the most effective way of putting pressure upon any particular tribe, or on the tribe as a whole. (The lines of migration of each tribe are given in the table.) Customs .—The Qashqai resemble generally the Lur nomads of South- West Persia. Their language is Turkish, though most tribesmen understand Persian fairly well. In appearance they compare favourably with their Lur compatriots : they seem on the whole to be taller and fairer than Bakhtiaris and certainly more so than Lurs. In religion they seem more orthodox and less superstitious than their Lur neighbours ; 'Ali Illahis will not be found among them, and Imamzadehs, Qadamgahs and Pirs are as noticeable by their rarity in Fars, as by their frequency in the Luristan and the Bakh- tiari countries. The Qashqai, in their winter quarters ta any rate, do not camp in the open valleys. Their custom is to select secluded valleys and ravines on the hill side, which are to some extent protected from the winter weather, and also near water, and in such spots four, ten, twenty tents may be seen together. The Qashqals are nomadic not only from traditional custom. Their tribal wealth and food-supply depends so largely on their flocks and herds that the necessity of leaving the ‘ hot regions' before the grazing in the valleys has been dried up, and of seeking fresh pastures is imperative, while the climate of the “ Sarhad ” is too bitter during the winter months, and more firewood can be obtained in the hills of the “ Garmslr. ” Their sheep and goats not only provide milk, meat, and clarified fat, which are staple items of their food, but the wool and hair is used by the tribes for weaving their own tents, coverings and carpets for sale in the towns, from which source each tent derives a portion of its yearly income. In some “ tirehs' the poorest tribesmen are said to own 300 animals. Sheep too find a large sale among the settled inhabitants of the south during the winter season. Sub-divisions .—It is a well-known tradition that the Qashqai were from the beginning 44 f tirehs ' (branches or clans). Some of these have almost disappeared, and others have dwindled to a few tents. Some ‘ tirehs-’QAS—QAS 806' Rave been merged into larger branches : in times of stress large bodies of the Qashqal have gone over to the Bakhtiari country, o^ in a less* degree, to the Khamseh tribes, and become identified with those tribes. Severity on the part of the llkhdnis, or partisan jealousies in the ‘tireh* itself, are often the cause of secessions. On the other hand' many of the &lt; ‘tirehs r are to-day composed of elements, in which little of the original Qashqa! stock can be traced, and much new blood has been imported. Thus the present leading family of the Kashkuli clan came from the Zend tribe, originating, from near Kirmanshah. The Pars tribe called Bulvardi, “ Ai'ab ” tribes like the Nafr, and Kuhgalu Lurs are to be found scattered amongst and incorporated in the Oashqai. Peasantry from a certain district will attach themselves to the clan frequenting the district, and small sedentary tribes are taken under the patronage of the Clashqai. The original 44 f tirehs ^ have therefore increased, but it is difficult to get an accurate list of all. A list of 57 clans is given by the Fdrsndmeh (His tory or Pars) written over 30 years ago. In J anuary 1911 Saulat-ud-Dauleh, Ilkhdni, gave Mr. Chick at list of 47 nomad, or partly nomad clans. The lists compiled in 1875 under Colonel Boss, and mentioned in 1890 by Lord Curzon, in his book, give comparatively few names, and there is much diversity of spelling. Sedentary Tribes.—T \xq whole tribe is not migratory ; many sections such as the Abulvardi (partially nomadic), Surkhi, Ikdir and Kurdshuli, are villagers, moving sometimes into tents in the summer, but never leaving the vicinity of their lands. The non-nomads have largely lost their tribal organization, and are simply known as “ tajik ” or peasantry. But some, such as the Surkhi and Kuhmarreh tribes, maintain a vigorous existence, and rival the nomadic tribes in the art of brigandage. The principal se dentary tribes are as follows :— Name. Habitat. Headman, etc. Families. ’AliBeganlu . Mubarakabad and Qir in Firuzabad district. Kochik Beg 250 Abulvardi In villages east of Shiraz, Abulwardi and others.

Kadkhuda Muhammad Sa- diq Khan and Haji Masih KhSn : with Kashkuli. 100 Surkhi In villages south of Shiraz Have only been included amongst the Qashqai in the last few years, but are now an integral part of the tribe. 500 Nomadic Tribes .—Of the nomadic tribes, the Darreh Shuri, (^. ?;.) Kashkuli (^. v.) ShishBuluki (q. v.) and Farsimadan (q.v.j are the most important, and their support or opposition to an likhdnl, is an important factor in Ears politics. Of secondary importance are such tribes as the Gallehzan, Safikhani, and J Amleh Ilkhani, the last named being, as the name denotes, the hereditary following of the llkhani, but in practice, split up into several sections following the principal chiefs. The following list only includes the better known tribes, who are included in most of the lists compiled by various authorities. It is based chiefly on*Messrs. Wilson's and Chick's lists :— Name.

Military. . Estimates of the fighting strength of the Qashqai differ widely, not only in the matter of numbers, but also in regard to other matters. For instance in 1912 Mr. C hick said that “ The enormous extent of country occupied y the Qashqais and their distribution in sparse units, widely scattered over extremely^ mountainous country, not only prevent the tribes from accumulating in any one place in more than a small fraction of their real stiength, but also would seem to make any operations against the tribe, oi certain sections of it, an extremely difficult matter/^ The same year, however, Lieutenant Wilson reported as follows For many years the Qashqai have been more or less united under the guidance of a single family : but they have not until the last few years attained political strength, and are easily divided into hostile camps by the dissensions of ieii chiefs. ^ dhey are more prosperous than perhaps any other large nomad 1 j .| an&lt; ^ tLi® very fact would make their subjugation by any Government, w nch exhibited the elementary qualities of purpose and determination, a matter of no great difficulty. Their extensive lands in the high and low country, theii large flocks, and the narrow limits within which their lines &lt;&gt; nugiation necessarily run, make them peculiarly vulnerable. Their country is mountainous in places, but not to the same extent as the Bakh- liaii oi vuhgullu country. It is traversed in every direction by roads fit forQAS—QAS 810 large bodies of troops, who could be supported without difficulty, on sup plies drawn from the sedentary population, which will be found all over Pars. They have no vast tracts of country abandoned solely to nomads, as have all the other nomadic tribes of South-West Persia. They must perforce live amongst a sedentary population, which greatly exceeds that of the tribesmen in point of numbers. ” Numbers.—In 1910 Chick estimated that Saulat-ud-Dauleh had 2 , 000,000 men under his command : but in 1912 he reckoned the number at 50,000 families (300,000 tribespeople) with 75,000 men capable of bearing arms. This does not represent the number likely to combine in opposition either to a tribal enemy or to an invader. Wilson in 1912 estimated that “ There should be, in theory, about 30,000 fighting men at thedisposal, and there are as a matter of fact probably not less than 15,000 modern rifles in possession of his tribes, and half as many obsolete ones. But no Ilkhdm has ever been able to collect and keep together more than 3,000 men at most. Sault-ud-Dauleh, acting with the approval and at the request of the Governor-General, was unable to keep more than 2,000 men in the field in support of the Nizam, in spite of the attractive prospect of the loot of Shiraz, that he dangled before his men .* the season was moreover con venient, and supplies from pillaged villages abundant. The maximum number of men that an influential Ilkhdnl could hope to collect and keep together at a favourable moment, such as, for instance, the month im mediately preceding the migration to or from the plains, is 4,000 men. Such a force could only be retained for a few weeks, and only when plen tiful supplies were available locally. ” Fighting qualities .—The men are of medium height, light, active, and hardy. They are warlike in their traditions and tastes, good riders and accustomed to firearms. The tribe could furnish good infantry men inured to hard work over rough country, and requiring but little transport for their few simple wants. General Gordon describes the horsemen encountered by him in 1892 as a tough and rough irregulars mounted on small, wiry horses. ” The Qashqal are probably superior to the Bakhtiari as fighting men. The mere fact that their losses in Shiraz during the autumn of 1911 3 amounted to over 400 killed and a proportionate number wounded, proves that they are not deficient in courage of a sort; but their failure to make an impression on the defences of the part of the town which they were attacking, indicates that they are deficient in other qualities, which are essential to a fighting man. It was noticeable that almost all Qashqai losses were incurred during night attacks; and the fact that both sides, Qashqal and Arabs, had recourse to mining and countermining is worthy of record. In any military operations against tbe QashqaTs the main factor to be considered is that they are as a whole a migratory tribe, that their wealth mainly depends on their flocks and herds and that any interruption or stoppage of their annual migration would result in their losing much of their live-stock owing to want of means of feeding them. They also own a considerable number of villages in the lower ground, including a good many belonging to the Qashhuli section in the vicinit of the Bushire-Shiraz road. The districts occupied by them during they winter months extendfrom the neighbourhood of Behbehan in the west to that of Firuzahad in the east. They commence their annual migration northwards soon after the Nauruz (21st March—). Many of the routes by which the different sections are accustomed to move pass within 30 miles of Kazerun, they all converge to the west of Shiraz. In the spring the tribes pass close to Shiraz usually about the end of April and early in May, on their return southwards they reach the vicinity of Shiraz in October and are mostly back in their winter quarters soon after the beginning of November. When on the move they travel very slowly, grazing as they go and often staying a few days in a place where the grass is better than elsewhere. Cattle, sheep and goats move over the hill-sides, men, women and children with the baggage animals carrying their belogings keep along the tracks.. It will be understood how extremely vulnerable they are during these migrations. They are obliged to keep to their regular routes within certain narrow limits, as othei wise they encroach on the rights of other sections or tribes and consequently provoke their hostility. In addition to the fact that all their moveable property is practically at the mercy of organised raiding parties, troops in occupation of Shiraz and the Kazerun valley in October and November, could, by blocking their routes, keep them up in the high ground where their cattle and sheep would all perish for want of grazing during the winter. Similary troops at these places in the spring could prevent their moving to their summer grazing ground with a like result. For this reason they would probably hesitate to engage in open hostilities with a fairly strong force moving up to the Shiraz valley during the winter months, though they might resist a smaller force if they thought they could block its advance. If they did offer any resistance it should not be difficult to bring them to terms. Armament .—The Qashqai are well armed, practically every able-bodied man being in possession of a magazine or Martini rifle, and, in 1911, fairly well supplied with ammunition. Saulat-ud-Dauleh was permitted by the Persian Government to import some 200,000 rounds, early in 1911, for the use of his tribesmen in protecting the roads; all this and a good deal more besides, were expended during the autumn of 1911 at Shiraz. During 1912 there was more fighting among the Qashqai, and about the same time the blockade of the Fars coast was undertaken by the navy, thus curtailing the supply. Though the tribe is rich, and during winter live close to the coast, they must now ( 1912 ) find it difficult to maintain an adequate supply of ammunition. In the year 1900 the Qashqai tribe did not possess more than 200 rifles, but in 1912 they had 15,000 magazine rifles, and perhaps 8,000 of older pattern. In 1910 Saulat-ud-Dauleh was presented with a 7 centimetre gun by the I ersian Government; but its weight would prevent it being used for any thing but an attack on Shiraz. Administration. The province of bars is administratively divided into a number of Gov ernorship (Hukumat), Sub-Governorships (Naib-ul-Hukumeh) and districts (Buluk), of which the last-named arc very ill-defined. A large number ofQAS—QAS 812 these Buluk and a few Governorships are in the possession of the Qash- qal tribe, and whatever settled population there may be in the towns or villages of those districts is under the control of, and entirely at the mercy of, the Qashqai II and its chiefs. During the past few years, under Saulat- ud-Dauleh particularly, there has been a considerable extension of power of the llkhani and tribes in this direction. In the Garmslr or Southern Ears, the Qashqai possess the governmental district of Firuzabfd : during 1909, 1910 and 1911 the government of Kazarun was either in the hands of an underling of the llkhani, or, as in 1911, with the Kalantars of the Kashkuli section, Mahammad 'All Khan, Kashkuli, and others. In 1912 the Kashkulis were turned out of Kazarun. The Qashqai returned one deputy to the Majlis in 1909. Tribal Rule. —The supreme chief or llkhani of the whole Tl' or collec tive tribe of the Qashqai, has in the past been appointed as such by the Central and Provincial Governments, and not by the common consent of the tribesmen. He is assisted by an “ Ilbegi.” At the present day there is little doubt that no appointment could be made effectual unless it were supported by the principal sections of the “ II,' and their leaders, let, on the other hand, these officials, derive their authority with the tribes, mainly from the fact that, as they are responsible for the tribal revenue, they kre in a position to bring pressure to bear on all sections of the tribe, with the support when necessary of the Persian Government. Once deprived of the title of llkhani or Ilbegi no chief can hope to retain his hold on more than a small proportion of the tribes. The llkhani and Ilbegi must come of the descent of the Khans of the Shahilou ( Shamlou) clan. For every rtireh' of the “ II' there is a KaluntaR, to whom that clan owes obedience, and who are themselves subject to none save the llkhani and Ilbegi. The appointment of the Kalantars, their dismissal and re instatement is at the will of the llkha ni and Ilbegi but in the case of the largest clans the Kalantars are often so powerful as to be able to defy the llkhani and to remain aloof in a sort of sullen hostility. In practice, even when dismissed, they maintain their influence in a large measure, though of course they are unable to collect revenue. Revenue. —The “ ll ' is assessed in the original f malidt ' at 27,000 tnmdns : 30,000 tumdns ( f farh') were added by Farhad Mirza. The sums actually exacted from the Kaldntars of the clans by the Tlkhdni and Ilbegi as revenue are, of course, much greater. About 125.000 tnmdns was an estimate given. The ' Amaleh are exempted from ' mdlidt ’ in return for their feudal service at all times. Until the year 1907 the Qashqai revenue was paid fairly regularly. In 1911, how r ever, it was estimated that Saulat- ud-Dauleh owed the Central Government 250,000 tumdns on account of revenue. The amount of revenue demanded from the Qashqai is high as compared with other nomad tribes. Taxes paid by the Qashqai chiefs amount to 70,822 tnmdns, some of the particulars are:— * Tumdns.

The hills on its eastern side are lofty, one espe cially so, viz., Tang Chal. Resources. Agriculture. —Although their chief wealth lies in the possession of flocks, the Qashqai are of agricultural as well as of pastoral habit. They sow wheat and barley on the summer lands, rice in the low country. They allow the summer lands to lie fallow for one year. In the spring they plough and break up the fallow land, which they again run over with the plough in autumn, and then put in the seed just before the first fall of snow and their migration south. Immediately on arrival at their winter quarters they lay down rice in cer tain places, which they gather before they leave. On their return to the high lands, they find their winter crops well above ground, and as the weather warms, they attend to the irrigation of these. They reap in July and August. In the highlands in the vicinity of Main, fine walnut trees occurs; and excel lent vineyards, carefully tended by Persian (Tajik) peasants, who pay rent to the Qashqai, are a noticeable feature of the Asupas valley. Rasins arp largely made and the grapes are also exported. Horses. —The breed of horses, though strong and serviceable, shows no i-emarkable quality. They average 14 hands 1 inch in height and are active, hardy, enduring and surefooted. The colts are sold when about three years old, the fillies only being kept. Bell places the price of a good horse at from 200 to 400 rupees. Valuable horses are only bred by the Ilkhani and his well-protected relations; for with others, immediately a very good colt is heard of, it is demanded by or for, some one in authority, and a colt or filly is not infrequently fired for some fictitious unsoundness in order to prevent its being claimed. The numbers owned by the tribe were in 1892 estimated at between 6,000 and 7,000, mostly mares. Transport. —Mules and donkeys are also owned and used for transport in the periodical migrations. Camels are not owned in large quantities. Cattle. —The fine breed of Qashqai cattle are proverbial, and a hardy breed owned by the Tajiks, generally black in colour, is used both for the plough and transport. Sheep. —Very large flocks of sheep and goats are owned. The former are of remarkable size, sometimes weighing as much as 140 lbs. The goats are chiefly black and red in colour. The wool of the sheep and goats is all required for the use of the tribe, who work it up into articles of clothing, camp equipage, horse coverings, hand carpets. {See also under ETHNO GRAPHY— Customs) {Authorities : Bell — Curzon — Gordon — Vaughan — Wilson, 1912 — Chick, 1909 and 1912.) ■mm ranoanBnnnraHnmOTHnMmnmHHRHHIHH^ 815 QAT—OEH The lower ground of the Qatru valley is occupied by low, marshy ground, a salt lake after rain and a salt desert in dry seasons. This valley is famous for its herds of wild asses. It is estimated that there are 2,0UO heads iu the neighbourhood. Owing to the failure of some q^cinat^ &gt; the wealth and population of the vil lage has much decreased : but though at present a miserable wreck, it con tains several fine old forts and buildings and two wind-towers, which form capital landmarks. From Qatru there are two roads leading to Saidabad, the chief town of the next valley to the east, called Sirjan. Between Qatru and Niriz the Luiriz range is crossed by the Qatru pass, 18 miles long, attaining at the watershed, an elevation of 5,640 feet.— [Lovett) QATRt}—(K 0 h-i-) — rule KUH-I-QATRU.

The chief village in the Chehar Mahal district of the Bakhtiari country, the first village reached within Bakhtiari jurisdiction from Isfahan (53 miles by the Bakhtiari caravan road, and the 3rd stage on that route). The word Qehf is the same as Kaf or Kuf, Bakhtiari and old Persian for Kuh, a moun tain. It is called by older travellers Geriva-i-Rukh, meaning the same. The road enters the* Chehar Mahal from the north by the Gardan-i-Rukh about 10 miles north of the village. The village stands o*i a broad, stony plain in the middle of a large area of cultivated and irrigated land. It is a large and populous place, with many wide streets with fine streams of water running through them. It contains about 500 houses with a popu lation of some 2,500, and has several square, loopholed towers and a small serai. A mill is near the village and another on the road, 3 miles to the norih- east. On its north-eastern extremity is situated the Kalek of Muhammad Juvad Khan, the Muntazam-ud-Dauleh, the son of a former, and nephew of the present (1905) Sardar of the Bakhtiari. It is evidently of two periods, the old part of sun-dried bricks, the new part of kiln-dried bricks. There is extensive cultivation of wheat and barley belonging to the village. A large stream of water, rising from 2 qandts, 3 and 6 miles distant res pectively, in the same direction, flows past the village. There are some gardens and a number of fruit trees as well as a certain number of willows, planes and poplars; 53,000 lbs. of grain are sown yearly; 10,000 krdns are paid annually in taxes. Supplies of all kinds in fair quantity and water are obtainable.

It forms part of the Tihran Karuan districts.— {Schindler.) QILAB— General. —The Dirtrict of Qilab is about 20 miles long east and west, ami 15 miles broad north and south, and is practically the basin of the Bala Bud, after its component streams, the Ab-i-Mungerrah and Ab-i-Anaraki leave the main range of limestone hills. It is inhalitxl by the Qalawands (Dirakwand) in the cold weather, and this tribe cultivates a considerable area of land in the district: a few families of the Mirs of the Dirakwand, who constitute practically a third sub-tribe (the second being the Baharwand) live in the district all the year round, and claim a share in the lands. For practical purposes no taxation has ever been paid by the Dirakwand on these lands, or in any other shape. The “ Oil springs ” in the district are at two points, both of them at the very foot of the main limestone range of mountains, which are the eastern continuation of Kiyalan Kuh. They are described in detail below. Communications. —From Dizful to the oil springs, which lie in the tract known as Doru Zanab, is about 30 miles; from Qaleh-i-Bandar, the limit of navigation on the Diz Biver, about 50 miles. For the first 12 miles from Dizful {i.e.&gt; some way beyond Do Kuh) the tract passes over a level gravelly plain rising gently to the north, no expense would be incurred in making a cart road along this section. Thence to Karharr, 8 miles, the best tract runs midway between Kuh-i-Tangiwan and the Balakad over low gravel hills crossing numerous small ravines. This section could probably be fitted for a cart road at a cost of about Bs. 600 a mile, being in gravel, once made the cost of upkeep would be small. The best testimony to this is the fact that portions of the ancient paved Shah Abbas route are still intact on this section. The next twelve miles to Qilab arid to the springs, would cost a good deal to fit for wheels, perhaps half as much as was spent on the Batwand-Maidan Minaftun cart road. 1 . Position of oil springs—Tang-i-Alwand springs. —These springs lie at the very foot of the main limestone range, and issue, it would appear, from the limestone itself in the bed of a small nald draining the Tang-i-Alwand, a deep ravine which runs back for a short distance into the main range. They extend for some 200 yards. No oil is exuded, as at Maidan Manaftun, but u qil ” pitch, of the consistency of butter comes up mixed with gas, apparently sulphuretted hydrogen: sulphur springs are numerous lower down the stream, for another 400 yards. The amount exuded is quite insignificant, only a few pounds per diem, I should say, not enough to make it commercially valuable even to the tribes. 2 . Poruzanab spring. —This is at the foot of a hillock likewise at the foot of the main limestone range, lying in the cultivated plain of Doruzanab, 1 mile east of the above springs. Pitch, but hard as asphalte almost, occurs here, it is known as u muminai.” North of both springs rise the limestone mountains, to the east are low gach hills, to the east gravelly slopes at the foot of the mountains, to the south a low range of gach hills less than a mile broad.817 Q1L—QIL mmmw* Within these limits lies the plain of Doruzanab, about two miles long by one mile broad. Water .—A permanent water-supply of the highest quality is assured by the Ab-i-Mungerrah ; which issued straight from the limestone and is entire ly free from gach. Wood .—Is plentiful on the limestone hills in the vicinity. Climate .—The height of Qilab above sea-level is about 1^500 feet, but the heat in summer is probably much less than at Masjid-i-Sulaiman, owing to the proximity of the high mountain ranges, on which the snow lies till June or July. A height of 6,000 feet could be reached by a 15 miles march up the Tang-i-Zardawar to the north. Ice could always be obtained from the hills. Geological .—Whilst in no way qualified to offer any remarks on this subject, I will endeavour to indicate what appeared to me from a cursory examination to be the main geological features, they are illustrated by the following rough sketch ;— The conglomerate cap is precisely similar in composition, I should say, to that found, in the neighbourhood of Maidan Manaftun, above Imamz Saiyid Saleh, and on the top of Kuh-i-Landar. The sandstones resemble closely those north of Maidan Manaftun. The gypsum hills are lower and less straited than those at Maidan Manaftun; there seems to be a fault about one mile of the springs, but I had no time to ascertain whether this was really the case. Political. M hilst dealings with the Dirakwand would be a matter of some difficulty, owing to the fact that they are practically a republic, with no recognised Khan or Khans, but a number of petty chief or Kadkhodas, I do not think that the difficulties would be insuperable, nor that the expense would be so heavy as that involved by dealing with the Bakhtiari Khans. It would be possible to bring strong pressure to bear on the Dirakwand through the hag wand, or Bakhtiari, and should at any future time Luristan be reduced to order, I do not think that political difficulties need deter the Oil Company from examining this field with a view to its development. On the contrary, our position in dealing with the Dirakwand would be stronger than with the Bakhtiari. I speak with hesitation as to the Dirakwand’s character, having seen but little of them as yet; but as far as I can see they differ little if at all from the ordinary type of Bakhtiari or Lur, and are susceptible of ths same treatment. They are undoubtedly anxious from the Oil Company to operate in their lands, and it should not be impossible, should it at any time become necessary, to conclude an agreement with them enabling the Oil Company to commence operations there on advantageous terms.— (Wilson, 1911.)QIN—QUA 818 QINDAQl— Lat.

A village in Ears, situated in the plain of the same name, about half way between Shiraz and Lar. It is a large village, a good deal in ruins, with three or four poor shops and a caravanserai. It is watered by a small stream from the hills and an ancient qandt. The plain of Qir is about 25 miles long and lies nearly east and west. It is said to contain thirty villages. Most of it is watered from the Kara Aghach. It usually has a pleasant appearance, owing to the turf with which it is clothed and its numerous palm groves. When the water is in sufficient quantity, it is very fertile and the corn stands over 5 feet high. Besides this the plain produces barley, rice, tobacco, sasame seed, opium, and ex cellent dates and fruits. Near the village of Qir it juts out into the lake in the form of a promontory. In the summer the Qir plain is intensely warm, and is then forsaken by the tribes, though its other inhabitants remain in the village, suffering, however, greatly from the swarms of flies which infest the country, and from sore eyes. Above the village Qir stands an earthen fort, which in the reign of Mir Muhammad Shah was held by 200 men against the Ilkhani of Firuzabad, who is said to have besieged it with 10,000 horses and 2 guns. It was afterwards dismantled, the garrison having made terms. The ad ministration of this district was entrusted in 1882 to Mirza Ahmad Khan, Muffn-ul-Mulk, son-in-law and nephew of the Sahib-i-Divan.— {Kinneir — Abbott Stack.) QIR (BAND-I-)— vide BAND-I-QlR.

The district consists of a plain about 80 miles long and 20 miles broad, lies roughly east and west, and receives on the north the drainage of the Kuh-i-Badaman mountains and on the south that of the ranges situated to the north of Pariz and Saidabad. The plain is a bare expanse of hard clay, and rises gradually from the east from about 4,700 to 5,500 feet. There are about 90 villages in the district, with an aggregate population of about 60,000. Some 3,000 kharwdrs of cotton are produced, which (after deducting Export. about 500 kharwdrs for home consumption) is . . exported to Russia via Shahrud, and to India via Bandar 'Abbas in the proportion of about 9 to 1 . Almost all transport is done by camels and donkeys, the former doing the journey from Rafsinjan to Bandar 'Abbas in 40 days, the latter in 25 days. The cost of carriage from Rafsinjan-to Shahrud is 13 to 20 tumdns per kjmrwdr, as campared with to 12 from Rafslnjan to Bandar Abbas. This difference in the cost of carriage is due, apart from the greater length of the Shahrud journey, to the fact that camels going to Shahrud have mostly to return empty, whilst those going to Bandar'Abbas can always hnd loads to bring back. The cotton is short-stapled. Attempts have been made to introduce a long-stapled cotton, but these (up to 1905) have met with no success, owing it is thought, to the summer beine- too snort. A considerable quantity of wool is produced by .the nomad tribes but is all used locally in the manufacture of carpets. The other chief products are:— * - • ■ - Gum Tragacanth. —100,000 maunds produced. All sent to London. Price, first quality, krdns 8 to 10 per maund. Opium. 500 to 600 maunds. All used locally.

All sheep-skins are retained mostly for turning into pushtins y etc. Goat-skins to the number of between 5,000 to 6,000 are sent down to Bandar ’Abbas, whence they find their way to the Arab coast. Imports. The chief imports of Rafsinjan are :— Cotton fabrics and prints. —The imports of grey goods and shirtings average, as far as could be ascertained, 20,000 pieces. —Almost entirely Lamsars. 15,000 to 20,000 lbs. annually. Sugar. —Loaf, some 50,000 batmans yearly, at to krdns per bat man. Crystal, about 40,000 batmans yearly, at to 4 kr'ans per batman. Kerosene oil. —500 to 600 cases, at 35 krdns per case. Candles. —About the same amount, at 35 krdns per box of 30 lbs. Silks (Persian), glassware (Austrian), china (Persian and English), enamelled ware (Russian), spices (Indian), iron, copper, and tin sheets (English), cutlery (English and Belgian), umbrellas (Indian), and cheap, flash ornaments (mostly Austrian and German) are imported also in quantity to fill the stalls of a fairly large bazar. Some 15 miles north of Bahramabad there is an opening into an under ground river, the Chah-i-Daria, the waters of which, if tapped, Would be available to largely increase the area under cultivation. A customs house has been established for the prevention of “ gun-run ning The district is not without interest from an antiquarian point of view, as iron spear-heads, a foot long, with a broad point, are often picked up. Twenty-eight degrees (Fahr.) of frost were registered about Christmas 1905.— {Stack — Preece, 1892 — Sykes, 1903 — Nowcomen, 1905.)

RAMUZ— Lat. 31° 10' N.; Long. 49° 48' E.; Elev. Also called Ram Hormuz and Suq Ram Hormuz, is the chief town of the district of the same name. It stands 2 or 3 miles from the right bank of the Ramuz river about 12 miles above its junction with the Kurdistan river and is situated about 48 miles due east of, and 60'miles by road from, Ahwaz. The hills of the Bakhtiari country begin about 2 or 3 miles north of the place. Ramuz is a thriving place, its position, at a point where several rivers meet and at the foot of a gorge leading through the mountains to Shiraz, making it naturally a place of importance. It consists of about 600 houses; most of these are of mud, but a few are of brick and plaster, the latter being the property of the Bakhtiari Khans who reside at Ramuz in winter. 4 he population is about 8,000 souls, and consists entirely of a class of mixedriver is» | from seraiRAM—RAM 828 origin who are described as Ahl-i-Ramuz. There are about 100 indifferently supplied shops, partly collected in a vaulted bazar, 100 yards in length, and partly scattered through the town. There are also two water-mills. M ood, fuel, and charcoal are cheap. The plain to the south-east is cultivated and irrigated. Two miles to the south is a fine house of the Sipahdars built in 1900. Several good gardens already exist on the south side of the town and others are being laid out on the north side. The trees are dates, oranges, pomegranates, figs, lemons, and vines. Irrigation is from a canal which takes out of the Ramuz river near its exit from the hills, and about 5 miles east of the town. The water is fresh and good, and is used for drinking. There are also wells, said to be about 50 feet deep, but they are little used. Ramuz town is the chief centre of trade in the district and here the produce of the adjacent hills finds a market. Messrs. Lynch Bros, have an agency at Ramuz in charge of a native. There is a Persian Government Telegraph to Nasiri on the one side and to Behbehan on the other. There is no post office. The town appears to have covered at one time an area much greater than that which it occupies to-day. It possesses two shrines; one, the Haft Tanan, in the north-east corner of the town among some date palms; the other, the 'Alamdar, with a tapering dome, in the outskirts, north of the centre of the town. The bulk of the exports from Ramuz is corn, rice, etc. Messrs. Lynch Bros, sell only iron and sugar. Merchants bring tea, English cloth, etc., from Shushtar and Wais. Ramuz in the 10th century A.D. was a prosperous place, famous for its raw silk. There were excellent markets and a fine Jama'’ mosque built by the Buyids. It possessed also a celebrated library. The name Ram Hormuz, received from King Hormuz, grandson of Ardashir Babakan, was already in the 14th century A.D. generally shortened to Ramuz.* (Fars-nameh — Burton, 190S—Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) RAMUZ, or RAM HORMUZ (District). The easternmost district of 'Arabistan ; it is attached for fiscal purposes to the northern division of that province, and may, therefore, be reckoned, though administered separately from the rest, to belong to Northern 'Arab- istan. Boundaries .—The Ramuz district is bounded along its north-eastern side, beginning at some naphtha springs known as Naft-i-Safid, at its northern .corner, by the Kuh-i-Gach range, which reaches to the Ramuz river; its south-eastern corner is on the Marun river, above Jaizan, which is included in the district. From Jaizan the boundary runs at a short distance from the left bank of the Marun to a point Cham Mani, on the Jarrahi, 3 miles below the confluence of the Ramuz and Marun rivers. From CLam Mani thence it is continued to the low mud and rock hills through which the Jarrahi breaks above Cham Sabi, crosses that river and, following the same hills, arrives at a point on the Ramuz-Nasiri route on the eastern verge of the Bu'airish plain, and about 9 miles east of the village of * Vidt Le Strange.■ 11 ■ 829 RAM—RAM Mirbacheh. The remainder of the boundary is a line connecting Bu’airish Avith the naphtha springs mentioned above; this line crosses the Gupal stream about 4 miles above the barrage on the same. Physical Characteristics .—The district is a fertile plain, about one-half of which is said to be watered by various streams and springs. The most important of the streams are the Ramuz river (or upper course of the J arrahi) between its exit from the hills and its junction with the Marun, and a short section of the Jarrahi proper between that junction and its exit from the district, also the Marun river, which is the principal feature of the south eastern portion of the district. The Gupal stream, which traverses a part of the district north of the Ramuz-Nasiri road, the Jarrahi and Marun rivers are described under separate articles. It remains to mention the Zarnini and Muwailheh streams* which are features of some importance in the neigh bourhood of Mirbacheh. The Zarnini, or Zarini, is crossed about 4 miles from Ramuz on the way to Mirbacheh. At that point it is (in winter) a swiftly flowing stream of fresh Avater, 1 to 2 yards broad and 2 to 3 feet deep, with perpendicular banks 4 to 5 feet high except at the crossing place and its course east to west-south-west. The subsequent course of the Zarnini is uncertain; a good deal of it is probably expended in irrigation, but it has been identified conjecturally with the fresh-water stream of the same size, . which passes a mile to the east of Mirbacheh village flowing in a north westerly direction ; possibly, however, it goes southward to the Jarrahi river. The Muwailheh is a salt stream, crossed about 2 miles west of Mir bacheh on the way to Nasiri. At that place it is running to the north- Avest, its bed is 200 to 300 yards across, and on the left bank, which is scarped, there are stony hillocks rising as much as 80 feet above the level of the water. The stream here resembles a canal and hugs the left bank of its channel; its average breadth is 10 yards, but even in winter a place Avas observed where its breadth was only 4 yards, and its depth, neverthe less, did not exceed feet. About 5 miles from the crossing place the Muwailheh falls into the Gupal. Besides these two streams in the neigh bourhood of Mirbacheh springs of fresh water are said to exist 10 or 12 miles to the south or south-east of that village. People. —The inhabitants of the Ramuz district are chiefly Ahl-i-Ramiiz&gt; a local breed of mixed Arab, Lur, BehbehanI, and Qanavati blood, who are related to the surrounding population much as Dizfulls and Shushtaris are ' to the tribes in the districts of Dizful and Shushtar. The Lurs, who are the next most numerous are chiefly Chehar Lang Bakhtiari, including Shir 'Alls and Galavaris, or Kuhgalu of the Bagdali, Bahmai, Bair Ahmadi, Agha Jari, and Taibi section. The balance of the population is Arabs or Saiyids. The Arabs belong chiefly to the Hamid, Al Khamis, and Bani Lam tribes, and are mostly settled or semi-settled cultivators. It is cal culated that among the Lurs one-half of the fighting men are armed Avith rifles and one-fifth mounted. Ramuz town is the principal place in the district: a conspectus of the villages is given at the end of this article. The total population of the district is probably about 12,000 souls, and inclusive of the A1 Khamis, only a feAv of whom, though the tribe is now semi-settled, appear in the table of villages below.RAM—RAM 830 Agriculture. —Rice, sesame, cotton, wheat, barley, beans, linseed, and tobacco are produced, and the fruits grown include dates, oranges, sweet and bitter limes, pomegranates, plums, grapes, apples, figs, quinces, citrons, apricots, pears, and almonds; the fruits, except grapes, are mostly of recent introduction. The district, under its present judicious managers, the Bakh- tiari Khans, promises to improve in every respect and is attracting settlers from every direction, especially from the Jarrahi region and farther east. There are 20 flour mills driven by water power in the district. The ordinary unit of land measurement in the district is the khish, or area which requires 5 Ramuz mans of wheat or 3 of barley to sow it. As the thickness of the sowing varies with the nature of the soil the khish can not be expressed in terms of acreage. Trade. —Ramuz town is the only commercial centre. Exports are wheat, barley, sesame, rice, beans, linseed, ghd, wool, and hides, which are the pro duce of the district, and wool, zidu, or gum-arabic, a kind of log-wood called runieh, and various nuts, which are brought from the hills. Exportation takes place direct to Nasiri and Muhammareh, but nearly all imports— viz., piece-goods, metals, sugar, tea, coffee, spices, crockery, and candles—are received through Nasiri ; the more highly taxed of these commodities, however, as also prohibited articles such as firearms and ammunition, are brought by muleteers from ports such as Fallahieh, Ma'shur, Hindian, and pilam, into which they are smuggled from abroad. The man of Ramuz is equal to 106 lbs. English. Administration. —The district is subject to the rule of the Bakhtiari Khans, who also enjoy its revenues subject to a yearly payment of 15,000 tumdns into the Persian treasury at Shushtar. The agricultural taxes are generally collected in kind at the rate of one-fourth of the gross produce in the case of wheat, barley, linseed, cotton, beans, and tobacco, and at the rate of one-third in the case of rice and sesame. Unirrigated crops gene rally pay revenue in cash at the rate of 33 krdns \)QY faddcin*. In 1904 the revenue collections in kind consisted of 2,000 Ramuz mans of wheat, 12,000 of barley, 100 of beans, 1,500 of linseed, 70 of tobacco, 12,000 of rice, and 1,000 of sesame, and their total value was estimated at 55,000 tumdns. In the same year the area cultivated by rainfall was 2,000 fadddns and yielded 6,500 tumdns in cash. The re venue-paying cultivation of the district at the present time is esti mated as below by a reliable authority. Unirrigated Land. Area in Khish. Proprietors. 600 Samsam-us-Saltaneh and the Muntaz'am-ud-Dauleh. 600 Shahab-us-Saltaneh and others. * One good authority, however, states that the annual payment to the Persian Govern-831 RAM—RAM Irrigated Land.

The remarkable differences in the rates of these rents is said to be justi fied by the corresponding differences in the productiveness of the estates. The people are generally contented under the present regime, and the land- owners all busy improving their property by extending the irrigation canals. The Khans pay one krdn per ?nan of their rents into a common fund, which is maintained by them for the internal government of the Bakhtiari tribe.

Their general bearing is south-west to north-east; they are 14 miles in length and 6 miles in width. The south-west spurs reach to within 2 miles of the sea and are known as-Cape Ras-Bustaneh. The peaks of this range do not rise higher than 1,200 to 1,500 feet. The plain round the hills is level and slightly inclined towards the sea. There are many cuts due to erosion running from the entrance of the vallev towards the coast. The valleys have wide open entrances but when nearing the middle of the hills they become narrow gorges with steep sides. After heavy rains impetuous torrents run down these valleys, but in the beginning of March there was not a drop of water in their dry dusty beds and, apart833) RAS r fro in sl few -thorns, there is no vegetation m these hills. ^ ith the exception of a few birds no animals were seen. In the lower spurs salt and sulphur are found. Some of these salt deposits are of pretty large extent but the quality Is bad, the salt being highly mixed with gravel and earth ; only small de posits contain pure and clear salt. The sulphur deposits occur near Kuh-i-Kibrit. Two hills to the south western extremity of the range, distant 1 mile from each other and facing the sea, consist of a soft rock of white or yellow colour winch appears to be a mixture of lime with gypsum and silica similar to the sinter deposits of the sulphur springs of Dashtistan, and this rock contains sulphur to the extent of 10 to 15 per cent of the whole mass. At some places a large number of small veins of pure sulphur and crystalline lace the sulphuric rock, hut these are generally not more than 2 or 3 inches thick. I only found two veins of about 6 to 8 inches in thickness. These sulphur deposits are worked by the natives in a very primitive manner. They obtain the sulphur on the surface of the hills, and only a few entries, or rather holes, are made to follow the best veins. As for the commercial value of these deposits it should be noted that /l) the deposits are small and, if extensively worked, would be exhausted within a few years ; ( 2 ) they are poor in sulphur ; the percentage of sul phur might increase if shafts were sunk and work undertaken at a lower depth, but this would probably not pay ; (3) the smelting as at present carried on, is very wasteful, but can only be improved by the use of fuel— - -an expensive item, as firewood is very scarce here; and (4) the mine can only be worked part of the year, the temperature during July, August, and Sep tember being too high even for native workmen. The Governor of Lmgah, Mirza Ismail, claims the ownership of these sulphur deposits. At some places the sulphur deposits are slightly impregnated with alum ; at others vapours of S0 3 issue from the ground. In the hills of Ras-Bustaneh a stratum of iron ore, striking _ south to north and dipping 50 degrees to west, was seen. It crops out in a small cut at an elevation of 880 feet. Roof and floor of this stratum consist of limestone-schist. The thickness is not more than 2 to 3 feet, and the quality varies greatly ; this reduces the total thickness of the pure ore to about 8 inches to 1 foot. Some parts of the stratum consist of good iron glance, dense and heavy, while other layers show a large percentage of lime, ine small extent of this stratum and the unequal quality of the mineral deprive 'it of all commercial value. Traces of copper were also found in these mountains, but the quantity is much too small to be of any value. ( }f r inklehiM£? } 18Jl.) HAS CHIRU— Lat. 26° 41' 31' ; Long. 53° 3fi' 38'.

A course now south by east will take you fairly down to the line of 10 fathoms on the Bardistan bank, which should be crossed in this depth. “If a beating wind, you should not stand off into more than 28 fathoms and in shore, at night, into less than 8 fathoms, unless above the Asses* Ears, in which case you may stand into 5 or 6 fathoms; in the day-time you may approach the shore to 4 fathoms, being to the southward'of the Asses Ears. Iwenty-eight fathoms off shore, to 5 or 6 fathoms in short in the day-time, and 7 or 8 fathoms in the night, will be safe working, until you reach Jabrin Island/*— (Brucks.)

A village near the west coast of the Bushire Peninsula, 6 miles south of Bushire, Ind | mile south of the Rishahr telegraph buildings belonging to the Indo-European Telegraph Company. It contains 15 houses of Bah rainis forming a block called Bahrainian, 10 of Saiyids, and others. Shaikh Husain, a Bahraini, who was chief Mulla of Bushire 40 or 50 years ago, used to live here in the summer, as did also his two immediate succes sors, Shaikh Khalaf and Shaikh Abdul All. On the coast, | mile west of the village, are the ruins of the old fort, called by the natives of Kaleh-i-Behman Shah. It is of Portuguese origin, having been built by them in the 16th century when they established a trading station here. They were expelled by the Persians after the capture of Hormuz in 1622. The fort was repaired in 1856 and occupied by Persian troops who made a gallant, but ineffectual, resistance against the British, the latter losing 4 officers in the attack. It is in the form of a square, with sides 300 yards long, and the ramparts still rise about 80 feet about sea-level. The site belongs to the Persian Government, and is surrounded by a ditch 70 to 100 feet wide, which is cultivated by forced labour, under the orders of the Governor of the Gulf Ports.—(CW^cm, 1889- -Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)

RIZ (1)— Lat. 28° 3' N. ; Long. 52° 6 ' E. ; Elev. 1,493'. A village in the Dashti district of Ears, 119 miles south-east from Bushire and the eighth stage on the road thence to Bandar 'Abbas. It contains a small mud and stone fort, and about 150 houses of mud stone or mats. The inhabitants muster 500, of whom 100 are fit for service ; they cultivate wheat and barley and own extensive date-groves, besides some small nocks of sheep and goats. The country is irrigated by streams and affords good grazing. Firewood is pentiful on this plateau, where there is more vegeta tion than in the plains of Khormudj and Shumbah. The village, which is situated in a grassy valley, about 3 miles broad, stands on the river Biz which furnishes it with a plentiful supply of good water. On the south sic e3 n 2 RlZ—RlZ 840 of the valley is the rocky Kuh Bahrain Shah which presents, for the most part, a cliff-like section with a lower range of gravelly hills, 500 feet high, at its foot. One mile north of the village are some low, rounded, sandstone hills. A good road fram Riz enters the hills east-north-east, and leads vta Kuh Baraftab to Pas-i-Kiidak, 15 miles distant. Another road enters the hills slightly east of south-east by east and leads to Dad-ul-Mizan, 18 miles distant, the seaport of Daiyir lies about 23 miles south-south-west over hilly country.— {Boss—Butcher, 1888.) RlZ (2) (River) — This river appears to commence under the name of Riz from a very shallow and pebble-covered basin about 500 yards broad, to the north-east of Kuh Puzeh Badri near Jam. Its course is nearly identical with the Bandar 'Abbas-Bushire road between Jam and Baghan, a distance by road of some 45 miles. The south bank of the river touches the road some 6 miles from Jam, and here forms a cliff from 50 to 100 feet in height. It receives many rivulets on its course, but all are of inconsiderable depth. A little more than 10 miles from Jam the river is crossed by the main road, and here, in March and April 1888, had only a depth of 6 inches and a breadth of 25 feet. The basin is very shallow and wide, and the southern side is covered with a dense jungle of tamarisk. Farther on at 15 miles from Jam the west bank is perpendicular and some 20 feet high. The main road crosses here, as it does again 2^ miles farther. At both these crossings, in the months mentioned, the river-bed was dry ; it has at the last-named crossing a breadth of 50 to 60 yards, and the west bank has increased in height to between 30 and 40 feet. Outside Riz village the road again crosses the river by a ford, the depth of water being 6 inches, breadth 20 feet, and general direc tion east to west. Just beyond Riz the river is 2 to 3 feet deep and flow ing from south to north. The road again crosses here by a ford. The bed of the river, being gravelly and stony, is always firm, and the depth, which is usually only a few inches, is stated to never exceed 3 feet. At 2 ^ miles from Baghan the road again crosses the river by a ford, the banks here being shelv ing. Pinally, Baghan is reached, standing on a narrow spit of land of which the west face is washed by the river Riz. The cliff here is 36 feet high, and the river, which runs north-west, is about 20 yards broad and of its normal depth. The river here is sometimes called the Baghan. The river is folded once more, for the last time, some 1^ mile? beyond Baghan and short ly after runs into the Mund river, and loses its identity as a separate stream —{Ross—Butcher, 1888) RIZ (3), or RlZ-I-GHULAM— Lat. 32° 45' N.

Bettween this and the next stage to the west, Kabutar Khan, there is a tract of country which is liable to inundation. This is shown on the survey of India maps as a swamp, but it was quite dry when Wood passed in the month of October, and he gathered from the inhabitants that it was only after very exceptionally heavy rain that any water col lected here. The plain is perfectly flat and stretches from hill to hill some 8 miles, and acts as a short of basin : it is not a marsh. The Central Persian telegraph line skirts its southern edge. IVhen under w r ater, the going is very sticky aivd trying. There is no necessity to pass through this ground, which is known as the Daqq-i-Kabutar Khan, as by hugging the hills on the north and passing through Bakilabad and Oasimabad, firm and secure ground would be traversed.ROB—ROD 842 The village, which has a good caravanserai and a large and well-built fih-dmbar, consists of about 300 houses, with a population of 700, and be longs to Saiyids.

RED HILLEH (Distuict)— A small district of Ears subordinate to the Governor of the Gulf Ports; it is wedged in between the district of Haiat Daud on the north, the sea on the west and south, and the districts of Angali and Shabankareh on the east. Limits and physical characteristics. —The Rud Hilleh district comprises only the banks of the river of the same name for a distance of 15 miles in land, together with the uncultivated mud-flats which extend from the river to the north shore of the Bushire harbour; including the latter.it measures about 15 miles in each direction. The coast of the district opposite Bushire town is swampy, but at its extreme southern point, called Tehima, there is a rocky patch ; throughout its length the coast is only a few feet above high-water-level. The district is flat and its only important feature is the Rud Hilleh stream. The winter is said to be colder than in Bushire, while in summer the day breezes are less scorching than those of Angali and Shabankareh and the nights are fairly cool. Bopulation. —The inhabitants of the district number somewhat over 4,000 souls. The majority are Arabs who speak both Persian and Arabic and are Sunnis by religion. Some of them claim to be the descendants of KaT immigrants from the Fallahieh district in Southern ’Arabistan, and the remainder represent themselves as Bani PIajir and Bani Tamim from the mainland of Arabia ; both classes say their ancestors came to the country two centuries ago and that they were refugees from Turkish oppression. The Bani Tamim claim to have been the earlier settlers. The villages consists of huts and are generally defended by small towers. Agriculture. —Wheat and barley are the ordinary staples; musk and water-melons also grow, and there are dates, but not many. There are some cattle and perhaps 1,000 sheep. Trade. —Trade is insignificant. Exports are a little wool and some wheat, barley, and melons, which go to Bushire, Muhammareh, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Lingeh. Imports are piece-goods, rice, tea, coffee, and sugar from Bushire. The Persian krdn is the medium of exchange; the local Hashim man is equal to 20 Tabriz mans of Bushire, and the local gaz to 40| inches. Communications and transport. —The Rud Hilleh river is a considerable obstacle to movement, especially in summer. There is a ferry over it atRfJD—RUD 844 Mahmadl, and a fort at ^Askari^ where it is crossed by a land ronte from Hushire to Muhammareh. A ferry is also reported at MahrizI. The district can produce about 250 horses, 1,300 donkeys, and, according to the state ment of the Khan, 200 mules. The inhabitants own about 50 boats and maintain communication with Kuwait, and even Basrah. Colonel Pelly says :—“This district rears a good half-bred description of horse—half-Persian, half-Arab—they pass currently under the general name of the Arab Ka’b horse. The principal defects of this half-breed are found in a small arm and a falling-oiT in the hind quarter. They are better road sters than the pure Arab, but they lack his quietness, intelligence, and endurance. By recrossing the Bud Hilleh KaT with a pure Arab it is found that a good-looking, serviceable horse, of large bone and height, is obtained, but he is never as serviceable as the pure Arab Administration —The district is subject to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. About 60 years ago it came under the Khan of Angali, with whom it remained until its transfer, 6 years ago, to the Khan of Haiat Baud, who manages it through a brother of his own stationed at Mahmadi. Justice is dispensed as in the KhaiPs own district of Haiat Baud (g'.f.). The taxes are 60 krdns on every 6 Hashim mans of seed sown or area of 13 acres culti vated ; also ^th of the produce of the date-palms, or, in a bad year, 2 or 3 drdns in cash on account of each tree. The district is at present farmed for an annual sum of 3,560 tumdns. The feud resulting from the transfer of this district from the Khan of Angali to the Khan of Haiat Baud is noticed in the article on Bushire, vide this Gazetteer. An official of the Persian Imperial Customs at Mahmadi is the only direct agent of the Persian Govern ment in the district. Armed forces .—Bud Hilleh can muster some 700 tufangckis.

The name Bud Hilleh, however, also appears to be used indiscriminately for either, or both, of the two streams which go to form the main river. Bell says that it is also called the Shatt Bani Lamini. There is a ford across the river at Angali, or Meh- madshahi, as it is usually called At Mahmadi it can be crossed in boats. At Mahmadi the inundations from the river reach for miles round from Basri to Muhrazi. The overflow from the Bidu Sur nearly reaches the overflow of the Bud Hilleh below Majnun and Kaieh Sirhan.845 HUD—RUD A thick layer of mud covers the countryside. At Mahmadi the river rises un to 24 feet. Bell says that the river is fordable at Kaleh birhan.

He also says that it flows parallel to the Pul-i-Duzakh stream. There is a tufangchi tower situated above, and on the east of, the village. It is built of masonry, and, before the days of long-range fire arms, was a hard place to take. It is, however, looked ftvto, and command ed by, hills on both sides. Rudian is a picturesque-looking and pleasant spot with a large number of fine walnut trees and grassy banks. r lhe air is cool. Firewood here is plentiful and there is a small camping-ground.

SABIANS, ok, SUBBA, or SABI— A remarkable people dispersed in small communities over parts of Turkish Arabia and Persian 'Arabistan, but united everywhere by the possession of a common religion. In dress and appearance they are indistinguishable from their Arab neighbours, with whom they possibly share a common de scent, though their speech is different and their Arabic broken. Their present headquarters (1905) are at Suq-ush-Shiilukh on the Euphrates where they number 700 souls ; they are also found at 'Amarah ( 1,000 souls), Nasiriyeh (300), Kaleh Salih, and Shatrat-ul-Muntahk in Turkish Arabia. In J Arabi- stan they are found at Muhammareh (40 families) ; at Hawizeh, which 60 years ago was one of their important places ; and at Aminieh on the Karun river (10 or 12 families.) There are none now at Ahwaz, Dizful, or Shushtar. Their religious head, known as the Clan, resides at Suq-ush-Shuiukh. The Sabians display a special aptitude for working in gold and silver, and this probably is the trade followed by the majority; in Turkish Arabia, how ever, many of them are canoe builders and carpenters ; few’ or none are agriculturists. The numbers of the Sabians have greatly declined in recent years, and are still dwindling. The exact nature of their religion and its affinities with star-worship, Judaism, Christianity, and Muhammadanism have not been ascertained accurately. The use also of the term “ Sabian ” by different authorities at various times has not been consistent, and it is doubtful whether the modern Subba are identical with the Sabtyana of the Quran. The modern Sabians possess scriptures of their ow r n and a book of ritual ; baptism is one of their principal rites, and water enters into all their import ant ceremonies; they respect Yahia, or John the Baptist, as a prophet, regarding him as a reincarnation of Seth, but they consider both Moses and Christ to have been false teachers; their paradise is located in the North Star. They are an uncircumcised race and not monogamous. In 'Arabistan they claim a Syrian origin, and say that their ancestors once owned most of Shushtar.— (Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)

The tribe is divided into two sections, the Rahim Khani and 'All Khani. The latter have for the last 10 years remained in the high country. The former section is divided again into two groups, controlled respectively Agha Riza and Qazim and by Fazil and Hasan. The former group separated some 10 years ago from the two main sections of the tribe, and found comparative peace and quiet under the oegis of the Wall. They are said to number about 500 families. Agha Riza is a sensible man, whom Captain Lorimer found friendly to Europeans.— ( WiUon, 1911.) SAHABABAD —Lat. Long. Elev.

The capital of the Sirjan district of Kirman. This is a busy and pros perous place of some 600 houses, a bazar of about 180 shops, and 2 cara vanserais, and contains about 9,000 inhabitants. The town, encircled by a high wall, lies near the southern end of the great kavir, in a fertile plain studded with magnificent trees. It is said to have been built bySAI—SAI 85S one Mlrza Saiyid ; to replace the ancient city of Beumidi ; on the destruc tion of the latter by the Afghans. The town lies on the post-route between Bandar 'Abbas and Kirman and 1 azd, and has a post office under a Rais-i-Pusht. Caravan routes radiate in all directions, the most important being those to Kirman (115 miles) ; to Bandar 'Abbas by the Tang-i-Zagh (217 miles) ; to Yazd (214 miles); to Shiraz (27 farsakhs) ; and to Darab (28 farsakhs). The chief manufactures are nomad rugs, and a coarse kind of cotton cloth, of which about 100,000 metres are produced yearly. The surround ing oasis produces rice, cereals, and cotton, gum tragacanth, almonds, and pistachios, of which the first two are largely exported to Yazd. The water is from qandts and is of fair quality. Grazing is scarce.— {Napier, 1899 — Sykes, 1902 — Newcomen, 1905.) SAIDABAD (2)-—Lat, Long. Elev. A village in the Anar district [q.v.) of Kirman. SA'lDAN —vide MUHAMMAREH District. SAIDMARREH, on SAIDMARA— A name given to that part of the Karkheh river in Luristan from the junction of the Garm Aslab and Kara Su rivers to its junction with the Ab-i-Zal, some 80 miles north-north-west of Dizful. The Saidmarreh river is second only to the Karun amongst the rivers of Persia, and the area drained by it is probably larger than that of the Karun. It rises in three branches, all springing considerably east of Kirmanshah, the first, and smallest, 25 miles west of Hamadan; the second has three springs on the slopes of Kuh-i-Alwand, 6 or 8 miles south of that town. The latter runs south-west till it meets the former in the plain of Maran about 10 miles south-west of Kangawar, and at a spot nearly 10 miles south of that place it is joined by the third and chief branch, coming from the Guran hills by a north-west course of about 40 miles. The trunk of the three united streams, under the name of the Ab-i-Gama- slab (of which the second above mentioned may, from its northern and central position, be considered as the main branch), winds nearly for 30 miles along the Guran mountains. At this celebrated spot, i.e., Bistun, the GamasT&amp;b receives the Ab-i-Dinavar coming from the north, and again, after a course of about 12 miles nearly south-west, another stream called the Qarasu (passing through the Kirmanshah plain), at about 20 miles north- north-west of that place. The direction of the main trunk is nearly south, until it receives, at a few miles from thence, a tributary coming from the Gurran mountains by a westerly course, and passing by the tomb of Baba Buzurg. Below this junction, under the name of Qarasu, it runs south by west for nearly 60 miles, traversing the Kuh Turdulan and the district of Pish-i-Kuh; and, finally, through the great chain of the Zagros to the ruins of Shahr-i-Rudbar, which are situated at its confluence with the river of Karind. This is a very considerable stream which rises close to the gates of Zagros, and has a tortuous course of nearly 100 miles in a general south-east direction. In the latter part of its course it forces its way through the Zagros, by a tremendous impassable gorge, into the plain of Zangawan,■■■ ■mmmMMMBMMMMMBD—HW iSi 859 SAI-SAI being then at a distance of about 12 miles east of the ruins of Shirwan. From thence it takes the name of Ab-i-Shirwan as it passes in a south- south-east direction through the valley Kudbar, being increased almost at the junction by the Zangawan, the Ab-i-Shirwan, and two other streams, all of which come from the west {vide Birinjan Gorge). The united waters of Qarasu and Ab-i-Shirwan, now called the Saidmarreh, follow the Zagros in a south-south-east direction for about 30 miles, through the plains of Lurt and Saidmarreh; one mile above the Gamishan bridge the Saidmarreh is joined on the north-east side by the Kashgan, a large stream which rises in two branches in the Kuh-i-Chihil Nabalighan, at some distance beyond Khurramabad, and after being joined by the united streams . of Khurramabad, Kabgan, and Tayin the main trunk runs south-west into the plain of Jaidar through a series of deep gorges. At about_ 22 miles south-east of the Pul-i-Gamlshan, the Saidmarreh receives the Ab-i-Garm, a smaller stream coming from the north, through the Fam gorge; a day's march south-east from thence is Pul-i-Tang, a very remarkable bridge over a chasm, here 50' deep and so narrow that a Kurd actually leaped across it in the presence of Major Rawlinson. Having overcome the obstacle the river resumes its ordinary size ; and 8 miles lower it is joined by the Ab-i-Zal, which enters it, after a course of about 50 miles from its source in the fastnesses of the Kal-i-Ispid and Anarch Rud. The Saidmarreh leaves the mountains west of Dizful, within 12 miles of that town, and is hereafter known as the Karkheh (^. v.) . At this spot it is a rapid mount ain stream and its entrance into the plain was formerly crossed by a bridge, the remains of which are known as Pa-i-Pul. Immediately below this bridge the river is fordable during the summer ; this ford is generally used by horsemen, caravans crossing lower down. It then traverses ' Arabi- stan and falls into the Shatt-al-'Arab above Basreh.— {Wilson, 1911.) SAlDUN— 150 houses; the inhabitants are mostly Saiyids ; 5 Martinis.

It is well-watered and has excellent grazing during the summer months. Its elevation is about 4,700 feet. It forms the summer quarters of a portion of the Qasim Khanai Kalhur Kurd's Chief, Namdar Khan.

SARAB-I-SlAH (1) (River) — Lat. Long. Elev. A sluggish, muddy river draining the eastern arm of the Chal-i-Mureh plain in the Shulistan district of Ears. It falls into the main stream (pro bably the Zuhreh), 2 miles from the Ganjagan lidge. The water is good. On its banks is the Tul-i-Surneh ( q.v.) near to which the river is forde , apparently with a certain amount of difficulty at all times. It flows in a stream, 20 yards broad and 4 feet deep, in a wide bed, the banks of which are covered with thick jungle. In winter it must be quite impassable, the river was evidently formerly led round the east side of the Tul-i-Surneh moan , as well as on the west side, thus securing for the mound a wet ditch. INow, however, there is water on the west side only .—[Veils — McGowan, 1890 — Hopkins, 1803.) SARAB-I-SlAH (2) (Valley)—Lat. Long. Elev. A valley of Ears, entered on the road from Fehlian to Basht, north-west of Shiraz. It lies between two parallel chains of hills.

There are roads on either side of the valley along the base of the hills. The Shish Plr waters are said to flow to the Sarab-i-Siah of Shulistan through Rudbal, so that the stream flowing through the valley is also known as the Sarab- i-Siah. Baring speaks of a spring called the Sarab-i-Slah, from which a stream flows, met with after crossing the Chal-i-Mureh. The Sarab-i-Siah ford is easy, just above where a remarkable mound, evidently artificial, is now crowned by a ruined mosque. The mound is circular in shape, has 40 feet of steep scarp, and 70 feet diameter. The Sarab-i-Siah evidently was formerly led round the east side of the mound, as well as the west, and a wet ditch was thus secured, but now there is only water on the west. The river is said to rise at one burst from a huge spring half-way up the valley, which has been likened to an arm' of the sea.— (deBode — Durand—Barina — Wells—Jones.) J SARAB NAlKASH— Lat.

This island, it is said, had once nearly a thousand inhabitants, but was depopulated by the pirates. There is anchorage nearly all round the island, but the ground is rocky and bad for holding; the best is to the southward.

Water is obtained from wells.— (Galindo 1888— Napier, 1889.) 3 SATABAD ( 1 )— Lat. 29° 18' N.; Long. 54° 30' E. ; Elev. A small village of Ears in the Hasanabad valley, some 10 miles north-east ot JNiriz.— (Dobbs.) SATABAD— (2) Lat. 30° 16' N.; Long. 56° 54' E.; Elev. A village in Kirman, 9 miles west of the city of that name, on the road to lazd. In the vicinity of this village Newcomen noticed that the sandy soil of the Kirman valley changed to the stone-strewn clay, which is chai- actenstic of the Kafsinjan valley. The water is fair, but supplies are only procurable in small quantities.— (Newcomen, 1905.) J SAUKHIBD— Lat. Long. Elev. A village near Nigar (q.v.) in the Kirman district. SAUMAK—Tvan. The plain of Saumar extends from Dabrullah in Persian territory to the Kumasang hills, which are said .to be the frontier between Persia and Tur- key. The plain has the shape of an oval. The road from Dabrullah to Mandali passes through the plain. The pass over the Kumasano- hills is filed Tang-i-Kumasang. The Turkish village i farsaU further on the left is also called Kumasang. From Dabrullah to Kumasang the distance is 2 farsakh. From Kumasang to Mandali the distance is f farsakh The hills bordering Saumar are only 50 metres high. The Turks still lay claim to this small district, and in 1903 when Persia wanted to establish a Custom Control Office, the Yali sent word that recourse would be had to force if necessary, in order to prevent any building being erected on this disputed bit of land. 1 The Turks lay claim to the plain of Saumar, and one can easily under stand why. The river of Gangir which descends from Tvan has just enough water for the date tree fields of Mandali. Were the plain of Saumar brought under cultivation no water would remain for Mandali and this would soon cause the ruin of that town. Four years ago when nomads sowed some fields in the Saumar plain the Turks sent a small military expedition to destroy the crops. On hearing of this Daud Zhan Kalhur gathered his horsemen and besieged Mandali. He was recalled by the Persian Govern ment, but only left after having caused serious damage to the town and villages of Mandali. Since that date Saumar has been uncultivated. In summer when the nomads ascend to cooler localities the plain of Sau mar is overrun by neighbouring robbers, Kurds or Arabs. Muleteers haveto wait at Mandali till they are sufficiently numerous to defend themselves. Since about 1903 they are accompanied across the plain of Saumar up to Dabrullah by ZapUehs from Mandali, the Yali of Baghdad thus main taining the claim of his Government on this territory.—(C^art, February 1904.) In the spring of 1904 the Turks once more invaded the plain of Saumar. The Persian Government sent a protest to the various Legations in Tehran and then instructed the customs authorities in Kirmanshah to investigate the means of safeguarding the rights of Persia to Saumar. In the report that was sent to Tehran the following facts were noted. The only place where the waters of the river of Tvan, formed by the junc tion of the Ab-i-Gangir and the Ab-i-Khuram, could be diverted is at a place called Saddeh near Du Bararan, before that it runs between cliffs of solid rock or through narrow valleys. To divert the river, either a large dam, costing from 5 to 7 thousand tumans would need to be made here, or else the bed of a former canal would have to be deepened, to bring it down to the level of the river. The hill of Saumar is easily defended, and would protect the work. Por further details see Rabino's “Gazetteer of Kirmanshah 1907.”—' (Rabino, 1907.) SAWAILlT— A section of the Ka J b tribe (q.v.). SAVON AT (? I STEH BAN AT)— L at. 29° 8' N.; Long. 54° 2' E.; Elev. A village in Ears, about 16 miles south of the south-east corner of the lake Nir.z. It is a flourishing place, situated in fine plain in the midst of many gardens and cultivation, and is surrounded by a mud wall. Linen cloth, called karbas, is manufactured here, and the place is celebrated for its earthenware, which is made to great perfection, the materials being obtained from the neighbouring mountains. Here also are made excellent wooden spoons of box and pear wood. The population is numerous, and the whole place wears an appearance of industry and comfort.— {Ouseley — Lovett.) SAZA-BlN (Gouge) — Is pierced by the Saimarreh river between the ends of the Charmin and Lara Mountains, as it enters the Rudbar valley of Luristan from the direc tion of Hulilan. The gorge is winding, and of rugged cliffs to either hand of the stream : it is traversed merely by a difficult foothpath and is imprac ticable for animals.—(2?.) M EHKUNAR— Lat. Long. Elev. A village in the Shabankareh district of Ears, south of Deh Kuhneh. It contains 30 houses inhabited by original Persians, who cultivate wheat and barley.

SHAPANKAREH (Distbict)— An inland district of the Ears Province, separated from the sea by the Gulf I orts District of Haiat Daud, and meeting on the south the Gulf Ports districts of Dashtistan, Angall and Rud Hilleh. Shabankareh is bounded on the west by the Rud Shar, which divides it from Haiat Daud ; on the north and east by the outer range of the Persian hills, in this neighbourhood called Taviseh ; and on the south by the Rud Hilleh river. Its length from north-west to south-east is thus about 20 miles and its breadth 12 miles. Physical characteristics. Except for the seaward slopes of the Taviseh hills, which are included in the district, Shabankareh appears to consist entirely of flat, open country. It is crossed by various water-courses from the hills, but there are none of importance between the Rud Shur on the east, and the Rud ^hur or Rudkhaneh-i-Shur on the west. Water is gener ally obtained from wells, but the villages on the Rud Hilleh river procure their supply from that stream. In summer, hot winds blow for three months from June to August but the temperature falls considerably at night. Inhabitants. The inhabitants mostly belong to Persian-speaking tribes who have been settled here from time immemorial ', but there are a few villages of immigrants from neighbouring Persian districts, and of Arab settlers. Most of the people belong to small or obscure tribes; the in habitants of Deh Kuhneh, the principal village of the district, are described as Haijab and Khajahvan. With few exceptions the people profess the faith of the Shi ah sect of the Muhammadan religion. They are neither fanatical nor turbulent, but they are well-armed, and Martini rifles are said to be as numerous as households. The dwellings in most places are huts, but about ^ are houses of sun-dried brick. A list of the principal villages is given below under the head of topography; a description of each is given separately in this Gazetteer. Most of the villages of the district have one or two small towers for purposes of defence. The total population of the district amounts to about 10,000 souls. Agriculture.--Vihe&amp;t and barley are the staples of cultivation, but there are date-plantations in some of the villages, and in particular places tobacco and water-melons are grown. Cotton has recently been introduced on a small scale. Live-stock includes a fair number of cattle and several thousands of sheep and goats.■■■■iiiiiiiimi—W—WMMHBI 879 SHA-SHA Trade.- There is a small export of wheat, barley, tobacco, straw and wool and a corresponding importation of piece-goods nee, tea, coffee, sugar and snices Business is chiefly with Bushire, the more northern villages dealing w P ith that place through the port of Bandar Big, and the more southern tbroue'h Shif The standard of length is a gaz, about 2 inches longer than the English yard, and of weight a Hashim man, which varies from 18 to 24 Tabriz mans of Bushire. Persian krdns make up the bulk of the currency. Communications and transport. Deh Kuhneh the principal place in Shabankareh, lies upon the route from Borazjun to Bandar Dilam or Zaidan, and from Deh Kuhneh there is a track to the sea at Bandar Rig. Shif, on the coast opposite Bushire town, is easily accessible across country from the southern villages of Shabankareh the distance being about 15 miles The transport resources are roughly estimated at 200 horses, 100 mules and 3 000 donkeys. In most villages where there are horses, mules also are found to about \ the number of horses. There are some camels. Administration .—Shabankareh is ruled by a hereditary Khan who is sub- iect to the Governor of Ears; the present incumbent is Isma il Khan (Wilson 1913), the family are said to have come from Easa near Shiraz in the Eiruzabad district and to have been first placed m charge of Shabankareh in the reign of Karim Khan Zand.--( Wilson s 4Wo ) The Khan at present pays 5,500 tumans a year for the farm of the district he manages it through the Kadkhudas or headmen of the villages There are no arrangements for the administration of justice, and private retaliation of injuries is the rule, though to a certain extent disputes are, adjusted by the Khan by village-headmen and local Kazis and Mullas. Land-revenue is collected at the rate of 60 krdns per 6 Hashim man of seed sown ; this works out at about 5 krdns per acre. There is also a cash tax on dates, equal to £ of the value of the produce, and an annual poll-tax of one per man is collected in addition. The districts of Mazara i [q.v.], Zna ?.?. •) and Behbera are also administered by members of the ruling family. ( Wilson’s ‘ Fdrs ’ 1913.) There is no official directly representing the Persian Government in the district. Supplementary information regarding the method of Government and local factions is given in the article on Bushire, vide this Gazetteer.

There is an imamzadeh with a few kunar trees. Near here are traces of ancient habitations, supposed to mark the site of the Sassanian university town of Jund-i-Shapur. Schindler, however, argues that the latter place must have been some what south-west of Shahabad on account of the scanty water-supply, and Jund-i-Shapur must have had water for its extensive date gardens. There are no date gardens at Shahabad. The ruins near Shahabad have, however, been identified with Shahr-i-Diagonus.— {Ratvlinson—Re Bode — Schindler — Baring—Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905.)

It is the most easterly village on the coast of the Hindian district of South 'Arabistan : and 8 miles north-north-west of Bandar Dilam. It is situated on a sand ridge, surrounded by mud flats. On the sand-dunes to the north west are the remains of some considerable place, judging by the amount of broken pottery and debris scattered about. High tides still reach the village on its western sides, and it has a small coasting trade. The inhabit- artts are often at feud with the people of Bandar Dilam. There is a white- domed tomb which gives its name to the place. T-he mullds in charge of it are hospitable and have even lodged a European traveller iathe gateway.— [Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1905.) SHAH 'ALAM (Shoal)—Lat.

Wheat and barley are grown, and a few horses and 50 donkeys are owned in the village.— [Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) SHAHPUR (Rivee) bettee SHAPlJR. A river in Ears which rises to the north-west of Shiraz, and flows in a direction rather west of south past Shahpur. Here the river, says Vaughan, is fordable, in the month of June, in many places. The current is swift and the water fresh and clear. The number of fish lying in the water is astonishing, the river being packed with them. The people have no nets and no lines or hooks, and can only take them by shooting them. It is cool in the vicinity of the river, but mosquitoes are troublesome at night. Another parent branch leaves the Daria-i-Parishan in a north-westerly direction, being crossed near the lake by the Pul-i-Abglneh. It flows round the north of Shahpur and joins the other stream west of that place. Near Shahpur the river rushes through a gorge called the Tang-i-Chakan, which is cut right through the cliff and is only slightly over a hundred yards in width. As the river approaches Kunar Takhteh it turns to the west, and, finding its way through the hills near Buraki, turns again south-south-east until joined by the Dalaki river in the Dashtistan. Thence the courae of the united river, now generally known as the Rud Hilleh or Rud-i-Shahpur, is south-east until it falls into the sea north of Bushire. The place of the same name consists of numerous camps of Lurs, who live in booths formed of pieces of wood and bushes. There are about 100 families in the place. A few supplies, water and firewood in abundance. Camping-ground good, vide Rud Hilleh river.— [Curzon, 1889 — Vaughan, 1890 — Newcomen, 1905.)

Borate Deposits of Shahr-i-Babate District. TLe borate deposits of this district are two in number, the larger and more important being that lying to the south-west of the villages called collectively Deh-i-Shutoran. This is U-shaped in outline bearing north-west and south-east, having a total area of a little over 2| square miles and lying in a flat area called by the Persians “ Kaffeh,” or Kavir, permeated everywhere by sodium chloride and calcium sulphate, as well as other alkaline or bitter salts and only locally by borates of sodium or calcium. This local occurrence of the borax compounds and the strange contour of the deposit lead us to the opinion that it owes its origin to springs coming .up from the volcanic rocks below bearing this salts in solution. If this be not the case it is difficult to explain why, over this almost perfectly flat area in which the water-level is never much over 3 feet deep, and usually much less, borates do not occur885 SHA—SHA everywhere. The fact is that in the vicinity of places where borates occur tamarisks are found in abundance as well as some smaller herbaceous plants. This proves that it is in such places that w r ater is most abundant. At the middle of the deposit on both sides its limits are well defined and in variably the ulexite is formed in abundance arouud the tamarisk clumps, but not within. The fact of bomte being found thus, where best always with tamarisks has led previous engineers into the erroneous idea that where tamarisks are the mineral is invariably present. At the south-east extremity or at the bottom of the U borates are found in very small quantity, and yet here the tamarisks are most abundant; the place of the ulexite seems to have been taken by gypsum which here exists in enormous quantity. Again good borate free from gypsum is found in abundanee on the projecting part on the right side of the U and in this place no tamarisks are found nor indeed vegetation of any kind whatever. There is a small green plant with fleshy leaves which seems often to accom pany the borates, but it is found in abundance on both sides of the sand hills at the right extremity of the U and between that place and lezdabad where no payable borate occurs. The surface of the very best borate bearing ground is usually wet, even when the sun temperature is 150° to 160° Fahr. and in other places the surface is quite dry and white with efflo resced sodium chloride, the wet ground being then an almost certain indica tion that gypsum is below. Mode of occurrence of ulexite .—The tamarisks usually occur in clumps round about which by the action of the wind, sand and dust has collected so as to form mounds often over 3 feet high. Below these mounds no ulexite whatever is found, but gypsum (sandy, flaky and compact) abounds. Round the edges of these mounds at the general level borates are found, and where abundant, usually completely encircle the clumps. Similarly, but on a small scale, all other plants are situated in the centre of diminutive mounds, usually 3 to 9 inches high, and below these borates are never found. In short, where vegetation exists, as it usually does, on the borate-bearing grounds, it is in the spaces between the plants that the mineral is found, but all such spaces do not contain ulexite. At the bottom of the U nothing is to be obtained, whilst at the protuber ance on the left side and at both extremities the mineral is of very poor quality. There seems but little doubt that the borates come up from below in aqueous solution and are deposited near the surface along with common salt gypsum, glauberite and other compounds in smaller quantity. There is not the slightest ground for doubting that the deposit is gradually increasing in quantity, but such increase must be very slow. The Kavir has been used from time immemorial as a source of borax by the natives who use the latter for soldering gold and silver and in the welding of steel. Ulexite never occurs here like gypsum, salt or glauberite in flakes or isolated crystals, but invariably in nodules more or less approximately spherical, which vary up to the size of a large apple. When slowly formed they are snow-white in colour and radio-crystalline in structure, the crystal being very light, fine and flexible, like silk.SHA—SHA 886 In cases where the mineral has been more rapidly produced and the centres of segregation numerous and close to one another, the resulting nodules soon impinge on one another, unite and include in their interstices as much as 50 or 60 per cent, of foreign matter. In some few cases lumps of pure borate have been formed weighing as much as 30 to 40 lbs. when dry and containing only a few per cent, of sand or earth. Considerable areas are covered with firm gypsum, above which ulexite has been deposited, but it is useless on account of the extreme difficulty attending the separation of the flaky gypsum crystals. Ulexite is never found at a greater depth than 1 foot and very rarely does it exceed 8 inches. Much of the corroded mineral appears on the surface and continues to a depth of 1 to 6 inches. The best mineral, however, is always found beneath a layer of moist gypseous sand 3 to 4 inches in thick ness and seldom reaches over 6 inches below. This 2 to 6 inches of ulexite is never a solid mass but it is in reality a stratum of moist sandy material containing the white nodules in larger or smaller quantity just like potatoes. The Sohrab borate deposits .—A group of low hills lie between these deposits and those of Deh-i-Shutoran. In a hollow between the spurs of these hills is a branch of the main Kavir and in this the borate is found. The total extent of the mineral-bearing area is about 700 yards by 250 yards. The mineral is much more sparsely distributed than at Deh-i-Shutoran. Collecting the mineral. —Shovels and bags are the only tools necessary for the work. Several men go ahead to find the good spots and others follow and collect the lumps and nodules of borax. Three workmen are able to oollect from 1 to kharver of borate a day (650 to 975 lbs.). Drying. —The mineral is emptied on the ground by the people who bring it. It is thus in a layer 2 to 3 inches thick, exposed to the sun for four or five days, being turned once, when it is gathered and heaped against the walls for dressing. The dressing is done by small boys and old men. The borate contains about 30 per cent, water. Refining as conducted by natives. —A quantity of crude soda, say 5 bat mans (3'25 lbs. avoir.), is boiled three or four hours, after which the boiling is discontinued to allow the mud to settle at the bottom of the boiler, from which it is taken out with flat spoons. Then some 5 batmans of the mineral slightly crushed is put in with the solution of soda and boiled. An hour later the water is let off. When the boiling is stopped the mud settles and leaves a clear solution of soda and borax in the boiler. This is put into clay pots to rest 6 to 10 hours. A crust of soda forms at the top whilst some forms a deposit at the bottom of the pots. The upper crust of soda is removed and the solution is boiled again to evaporate the water. What remains in the boiler is then taken out, made into round cakes and left to dry. This refined borate is then ready for transport. The great disadvantage of this system is the quantity of soda which still remains in the refined product. Furthermore, the boiler, being made of common thin copper sheets and occasionally only being thick wrought copper boilers, the metal gets corroded and the refined borax becomes of a greenish or brownish colour. The refined product also contains a small admixture of mud or earthy substances. 3qaanmnioauu 1 , 5g7 SHA—SHA Fuel supply-— fuel to be obtained here is of three different kinds.'— (1) a small aromatic scrubby plant called by the Persians “ botteh (2) large scrubby plants which grow like the former in salt places such as the tamarisk and similar plants growing on the dry plains; (8) firewood of good quality derived from trees got on the hills in the vicinity of Marmana and Pai-Ghalleh. The first is very light and burns like straw, but has been found unsuitable for any purpose except that of lighting the heavy wood. The second is heavier but has been found too light to roast the borate alone j it does well mixed with heavier wood. The third or heavy firewood is very abundant from the slopes of the very summits of the mountains lying to the north-east. Soda. “ Kilia/' or crude soda, is obtained by the natives from a small plant growing abundantly on some parts of the plain. The sappy twigs of this”plant, which the Persians call “ ehshlun,” are collected and placed together with a little firewood in pits dug into the ground. By setting the whole on fire crude soda is produced which deposits at the bottom of the pit in large blocks of a greyish colour and of considerable hardness.—(/. Morrow Campbell, July 27th, 1893.)

It is situated in a well cultivated valley, at the foot of the Pasbandi pass to the north and the Zirreh range to the south, and the main pass (8,700') on that range leading to Naghan. It contains 200 houses and a large fort-like enclosure with corner towers. The population is said to number about 500. A small stream known as the Ab-i-Shalamzar, flows westwards past the southern end of the village joining the Ab-i-Jehan-bin some 8 miles lower down. The bridge at Shalamzar was said in 1906 to have a very bad surface of boulders, but in October of that year the stream was only 18' deep; it has a sand bottom and level banks. The valley and mountain around are bare of trees. Wheat and barley are grown in considerable quantities in the valley and the adjacent slopes, and are exported to Isfahan for sale.

The caravanserai stands 40U feet above the Ab-i-Bazuft. It is built of rubble masonry and there are about 40 square yards of rooms, walls and stables, lo feet high, roofed with heavy chinar beams. On the hill-sides are limestone rocks which are burnt for lime at the caravanserai. The accommodation in the serai is very restricted, but there are several good camping-grounds between it and the bridge at Pul-i-'Amarat, the nearest being a narrow strip on the left bank of the stream from the serai to 400 yards and upwards.

The caravanserai, which overlooks it on the right bank of the river, is the 10th stage on the Bakhtiari caravan road from Isfahan (167 miles). The specifications of the bridge, which was one of two laid on this route by Messrs. Lynch Brothers in 1898-1900 for the Bakhtiari Khans, is as follows:—Wire rope suspension, with piers of solid masonry and a lattice girder. Steel roadway and concrete flooring ; length 120 feet. Clear width of roadway, 10 feet. Adapted to bear an ordinary working load of 2 £ cwt. per spuare foot, or a live load uniformly distributed of 80 tons. It is laid about 80 feet above the level of the river at a point where its banks rise as perpendicular cliffs on both sides to that height. Before the bridge was built the ford here was known as the Gudar-i-Balutak (“ the ford where the oak-trees abound ”). The river running between these high cliffs has a current sometimes in the early spring of 13 feet a second and is liable to sudden rises of many feet within a few hours. The caravanserai was built at the same time as the bridge and has a fair amount of accommodation, but is kept in the most unsanitary and filthy condition. There is no village or other buildings in the neighbourhood.

The halting-place consists of several camps of Lurs, situated at the point where the Shapur river issues from the hills on to the plain of Kazarun. The habitations consist of pieces of wood and bushes, and there are about 100 families in the place belonging to the Taiteh Dushman Ziarl of the Mammasanis. Firewood is very plentiful here. On a low hill commanding the entrance to the Tang-i-Chakan through which the river flows, stand the ruins of an old fort. The villages round Shapur are in the hands and control of the Kashuli Khans, who encamp on the banks above the Shapur river spring and autumn. Similary the caravanserai Khwaja Ibrahim, of the end of the Tang-i-Turkan, is occupied by Kashkull tribesmen and others. The follow ing villages are included in the district of Shapur :— Busbakan.

In coming from the south, Kamarij is the best place from which to make the excursion. To see the ruins of Shapur. Following the telegraph poles along the Kamarij road for a little over 5 miles, and then striking across the plain in the direction of the north-westerly cliff wall, the track becomes involved in a wilderness of tumuli, consisting of loose stones and broken down struc tures, filling a circuit of several miles, at the base of the mountains. These mounds rise to a height of 50 to 60 feet above the surrounding plain. These are the ruins of the city of Shapur. Through the northern cliff cuts the gorge of the Shahpur river, known as the Tang-i-Chakan, its sides being a sheer rock face, in many parts of several hundred feet high. In the wilderness of ruins that marks the site of the ancient city, few remains are now capable of identification. The only ruin of any moment is that of a building 50 feet square, one wall of which is still standing, though half buried in the soil. In the very jaws of the gorge, on a spur of the south east cliff, are the remains of an old castle. There is no doubt that this, which is called the Kaleh-i-Dukhtar, is the remains of the ancient citadel.SHA—SHA 898 In the gorge on both sides are cut bas-reliefs in the rock, two on the left, and four on the right bank of the river.

SHARIFAT (Tribe) — An Arab tribe, represented in Southern 'Arabistan in the Jarrahi district by two sections, the Rajaibat and the Bani Rashid, who inhabit the left bank of the Jarrahi near Khalafabad. In former days the tribe was very powerful, and, according to Felly and Layard, inhabited the vicinity of the Hindian river, and the Zadan hills, and had Deh Mulla and Hindian as their principal towns. The tribe, says Layard, used to consider itself more under the protection of the Ka'b Shaikh than under his absolute authority. It numbered a fighting strength of about 2,000 foot and 700 horsemen, and frequently opposed the Ka'b Shaikh, sometimes siding with the Persian against him. Pelly called them a section of the Ka'b tribe and gave the number of their adult males as 10,000. Ross gives them as a principal Ka ; b tribe numbering about 900 males, living in huts near Hawizeh and tributary to Fallahieh. Whatever amount of accuracy there may be in these varying accounts, the fact remains that the tribe has diminished greatly both in power and numbers in ■ Arabistan, and, as regards that pro vince, is now only found near Khalafabad as stated above. The Raaibat section has 20 fighting men and 30 horses, while the Bam Rashid number 30 fighting men, and possess 35 horses. Each section possesses also about 100 camels, besides some donkeys, cattle and sheep. The Sharif at are also found on the Turkish side of the Shatt-al-^Arab in the neighbourhood of Ahu\-K.hm^h.— (Jjfigard—Pellg-^Poss—Foreign Department!

A village on the west shore of 'Abbadan island about 3 miles below Bawalr- deh. It consists of 30 mud huts of Mutur (Muhaisin) —(Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.) SHATAIT (AB-I-)— The right branch of the Karun river after its bifurcation above Shushtar, and until it reunites at Band-i-Qir with that portion of its waters which runs through the alternative channel of the Gargar. The course of the Shatait is much more crooked than that of the Gargar and the stream is much wider, attaining a maximum breadth of 260 yards at a point about 16 miles above Band-i-Qir, where a rocky spur comes down to the stream on the left side. The steep banks are covered with scrub. At its junction with the Gargar and Diz the Shatait is 150 yards wide. Its colour when in flood is a greyish-green, and it is slower to show discolouration than either the Gargar or Diz. It carries less silt than the Gargar, the Diz, or the Lower Karun. When stream navigation was introduced on the Karun, the Shushan, still in use, a stern-wheeler 100 feet long with a beam of 23 and an ordinarv draft of 3 feet, ran for more than a year upon the Shatait, instead of upon the Gargar as at present, it being at that time believed that in the low season the channel of the Gargar might become impassable. It was found that the river could not be navigated with safety, by avessel of the Shushan’s dimensions above Cheh&amp;r Dingeh, a point 10 miles distant by land from Shtishtar town, on account of the intricacy and number of the channels and of the shingly nature of the bed, which prevented the use of anchors from getting off when aground. Below Chehar Dingeh which from the end of 1890 to the beginning of 1892 was the Shushan’s regular terminus, the only serious obstacle was a double reef of rocks with a narrow channel through which the water raced violently : the difficulty of the reef was at times increased by the formation of sandbanks below it. It was found that, owing to want of water, the passage of the reef was uncertain in August and September, dangerous in October, and impassable in November ; but the level of the river did not valy regularly with the season. Once the Shushan crossed the reef when there was only 2f feet of water on it : in this case she was slacked over with lines, sheering about very much in the strong water, and took the ground twice in the operation. Native craft prefer the Gargar to the Shatait. At Shushtar town a canal called the Minau, described in the article on Shushtar town, has its head. About 500 yards below the kaleh the Shatait is crossed by a gigantic dam, supporting a bridge which is known as thePul-i-Shahi or Dizful. The bridge winds irregularly, and when complete had 41 arches and was 570 yards long, with a cobble-paved road-way, 21 feet wide. At the present time (1905) 28 arches are still standing on the left bank and 8 upon the right, but these are divided by a breach about 170 feet long through which the main stream of the river passes, the weir at this point having given way as well as the bridge. The materials and construction of the weir are superior to those of the bridge. The stream in the spring floods has a current running up to 6 feet a second, and is dangerous to animals which have to cross it by swimming. The Shatait is not applied to irrigation except on a petty scale near villages. The principal tribe in the neigbourhood of the Shatait are the 'Anafijeh who live upon its lower reaches.

SHALE (Rivee) —vide SHABUR (River). SHAYUR (or SHAUR) (River), originally SHAPUR (River) — A river of 'Arabistan, which rises from springs in the plain between the j-ivers Karkheh and Diz at Aivan-i-Kasra or Asiran-i-Karkheh. 0? Morgan is of opinion that it was originally a canal, and that its waters aie now derived from the Karkheh river by a subterranean channel, his opinion being fortined by the fact of the river passing through a range, or ridge, of low hills by a manifestly artificial cutting on its course to the river Diz. Some 12 miles below its source, flowing nearly south and parallel to the river Karkheh, from which it is never many miles distant, it washes the western foot of the ruins of Shush or Susa. At this _ point it is milts east of the river Karkheh and 6^ miles west of the Ab-i-Diz. Continuing southward Kut-ul-Mlhdi is passed on the left bank at 20 miles. licit the Shavur bends south-south-east towards the Diz river, passing Khair- abad at 55 miles and Deh-i-Saiyid Musa at 60 miles, both on the right bank. Thenceforward the river curves more and more to the east towards the river Diz, and ’begins to leave the river Karkheh which soon afterwards bends south-west towards Hawizeh. Passing within 2 miles of Deh-i-Pir Muhammad on the right bank at about 64 miles, the Shavur joins the river Diz by two branches above Band-i-Qir after a course of about 75 miles by water, or of 60 miles neglecting bends. These two branches separate at Hawizeh and enter the larger river 38 and 26 miles respectively by water above Band-i-Qir. The former of these branches is named the Sharish and the latter the Kharur..; both contain water at all seasons of the year, but the Kharur is the more impprtRnt. Originally the Shavur flowed into the river Karun from the north-west a Httle ' below Wais a,hd, at a, later period, near Ahwaz. After deserting . this bed it adopted a moj-e southerly channel, joining the main river near Ahwaz. Later again it .struck northwards, and at the time of LayardV and Selby's explorations in 1842 was found entering the Ab-i-Diz at a point 12 miles above BUnd-i-Qir. This channel appears to have been more or less maintained until the present day (1905). The history of this river, whose various channels .can ,be distinctly traced, * is typical of all the rivers of this district, including the Karun itself. The Shavur is. of canal-like appearance, its course is winding, and its width of 25 to 30 yards is fairly uniformly maintained. At least in some of the upper reaches, the banks are high (6 to 12 feet above the water)and the river in some places is unfordable ; but taking it throughout its length, the stteam is sluggish, its banks and bed soft and of alluvial soil, and it can be forded at frequent intervals, the fords being generally girth- deep. the banks are lined almost throughout with low tamarisk jungle and, in its higher reaches, with thorn trees, and abound with wild boar, hyaenas and small game. The lands upon the Shavur, especially those of the Ajairib tract, are fertile, and the banks are clothed in springs with luxuriant herbage. Throughout its course a number of. canals diverge from the river, some of ancient and some of modern construction, and the river is largely drawn on for irrigation, at the low season its waters being practically exhausted for this purpose. The principal canals which leave the Shavur on its left bank are, in descending order, the following—-the Khairabad, the Taraifi, the Qumat, the Ishareh (near Jajls on the Diz) and the Hawasiyeh ; of these the Taraifi and llawasiyeh benefit the 'Anafijeh tribe, and the remainder water the lands of the Bait Sahd. In some places it forms marshes, which are tenanted by pastoral Arabs and cultivated with rice. There are several Arab settlements upon it, of which the most important appear to be Qumat and Khairabad, both now in the possession of Shaikh Haidar of the A1 Kathir tribe. Qumat was called after one Saiyid Qumat, who is now represented by his grandson, Saiyid Taghir Qumati, but the name of the settlement, which consists of four camps, is said to have been changed, and Qumat is probably the present Kut-ul-Mahdi. The 'Anafijeh formerly occupied both banks of the Shavur, as the Bait Sa'ad and Al Kathir still do, and until 1905 the Ban! Lam extended up to its right bank below Khairab&amp;d. In Layardhs day the Shavur at Qumat divided in winter into two branches, of which the northern retained the name of Shavur, the other being call the Kharur.—— Curzon, 1889 — Burton, 1897— Bersian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908.)

The name “ Shibkuh ” means “ below the hills/ - ’ The islands of Shaikh Shu^aib, Hindarabi, Qais and Farm - are attached for administra tive purposes to the Shibkuh district. Physical Geography. —The disposition of the ranges composing this hilly, littoral tract has been made clear by recent surveys; previously it was not well understood. The dominant feature of the whole district is the great maritime range of Southern Persia, which, forming a tangent to the sea near Kangan runs thence south-south-eastwards without interruption and almost without change of direction, until it falls into the sea on the coast between Lingeh and Khamlr at a point immediately north of Basldu: the distance from Kangan to this place is about 210 miles. The range throughout is composed of masses of limestones which have a quaquaversal dip, and rise in places to as much as 5,0#0 feet above sea- level. The principal summits are Kuh Marakishti (in the Admiralty chart called Jabal Siri, ^Ayanat or Barn Hill) 4 miles inland from Mlanlu, height 4,660 feet; Sir-i-Yafal (in the Admiralty chart called Sin Yafal or J Asalu Notch) 6 miles inland from Nakhl Taqi and 4,870 feet high; and Jabal Taranjeh 20 miles inland from Gurzeh, elevation 5,150 feet. We may here notice that a great trough, co-extensive with the portion of the maritime range just described, adjoins the range on its inland side, and is divided into two parts by a watershed which is behind Tahir! on the coast. Portions of this great valley are still unsurveyed, but the part of it to the north-west of the watershed seems to drain to the upper course of the Mund river, while the major or south-western part apparently runs straight in the opposite direction to Clarence Strait, the channel between Qishm island and the main. The valley contains 3 places of some im portance, whose trade with the outer world is conducted through Shibkuh Ports; they are Gallehdar, 8 miles from the sea at a point rather nearer to J Asalil than to Tahirl; Tarakameh, 20 miles inland from Shry u ; and IshkanI, 22 miles from the coast at Maqam. It remains to describe the sub-features of the Shibkuh tract between the main range and the Persian Qulf. From Kangan as far as ' Asalu, a little over 40 miles, the main range immediately adjoins the coast and presents to it a face apparently precipitous, on which, however, the fires of charcoal burners are seen to twdnkle at night. Immediately below ’Asalu isNaband bay, and from there to another but less pronounced bay at Maqam—a distance of about 60 miles—--the coast lies parallel to the foot of the main range at about 20 miles from it, the intervening space being occupied by the Gabandi valley which rises immediately inland of Shiyu, and, skirting the foot of the main range, reaches the sea at the foot of Naband bay. The Gabandi valley is separated from the coast by a sandstone ridge, called Shahln Kuh, which is nowhere more than a mile or two from the shore, and in the neighbourhood of Shiyu attains its maximum' height of 1,100 feet. This ridge continues along the coast till Maqam, when the littoral making a fresh echelon seawards, it is left at some distance inland, and almost immediately terminates about 16 miles due east of Maqam. Between Shiyu and Maqam, rather nearer to the latter, is a gap in the sandstoneT?n»t.? | 007 SHI—SHI ridge through which ft small valley oalled Darveh Asuh comes down to the sea in a direction perpendicular to the coast: this valley has two branches in the interior which unite at about 10 miles from the sea,, one of them coming from the west from a point near the head of the Gabandi valley and the other from the east, from the watershed on the other side of which a valley called Hamxru has its origin. The Hamiru valley from its source at first runs eastwards, then bends southwards round the end of the sand stone ridge to the east of Maqam and finally goes westwards reaching the sea at Maqam in an opening between two parallel ranges similar to that of the Gabandi valley at Naband. The southern range in this case is another ridge of sandstone which extends from Has N a hand for 50 miles to Charak, where it ends, closely adjoining the shore throughout its length; between Chiru and Charak it has an elevation of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The greater part of the interval to the north of this ridge between it and the great mari time range is occupied by the turn of the Hamiiu valley already described, and by a tributary which it receives from the east, but the remainder consists of the basin of the Gulshan valley, which has its mouth on the coast less than a mile to the east of Charak. Beyond Charak a gap about 5 miles in width occurs in the coast ridge, and a plain extends from the edge of the sea to the main range, here 15 miles inland, broken only by some dark-coloured, detached hills between 1,000 and 2,000 feet high. Between the gap and Mughu,the last of the Shibkuh ports in this direction, the detached hill Kuh INamaki (in the Admiralty chart called Jabal land) rises close to the sea to an elevation of 1,200 feet. The strata of the sandstone ridges which skirt the sea below Bas Naband dip toward the coast, and it appears not improbable that the ridges them- sefves have been formed by the gradual elevation of the greater inner limestone range through a bed of superincumbent, light-coloured sand stone. It is worthy of remark that, while the limestone range gives biith to many fresh springs and streams and is clad, though sparsely, with almond, dwarf- oak, hawthorn, rose and terebinth, the sandstone ridges produce hardly a shrub or a grass, and the streams that spring from them are generally bjacbish. j &gt;: The actual coast of the Shibkuh ports district possesses no remarkable feature, unless we reckon the islands of Shaikh Shibaib, Hindaiabi, Qais, Farur and Nab in. Farur. Bangers of navigation, apart from these con spicuous islands, are few T ; and north of Shiyu the tide-stream is either faint or imperceptible. The number of Ijouses in the Shibkuh district—the valleys of Gabandi, Barveh Asuh and Gulshan in the interior being excluded—-appears to be about 3,500; bub at the present time (1906), in consequence of recent emigrations, there is at most places a considerable proportion of unoccupied houses and the actual total population cannot be estimated at more than 13,000 souls; Persians of unmixed descent are few in the district, and such as are found am mostly settlers from Bar and other Persian districts; the bulk of the people are of mingled Persian and Arab blood, and the tribesSHI—SHI to tvhidh they heltmg are of no consequence.

Piece-goods are the principal import, and tobacco from the interior is the chief article of export. Trade relations are with Lingeh town, Trucial 'Oman and Bahrain. The unit of weight is a man equal to 9 lbs. English and that of length a gaz or double tad of 38 inches. Routes and transport. —A route presenting no special difficulties follows the sea-coast from Kangan to Naband bay, from the foot of which it runs up the Gabandi valley, traverses the upper basins of the Asuh and Gulshan valleys, and passes across the swampy plain of the Lingeh district to Lingeh town* ; there is a land route along the coast from Charak rid Mughu to Lingeh ) town ; one from Charak inland to Bastak and so to Lar, and a third, crossing the last, from Mughu, to Lar.t The coast route is fit for all arms. The following table explains the present organisation, for administrative and revenue purposes, of the Shibkuh district:— Groups of vil- . lages and total annual revenue. Province to which at tached.

Administration .'—From this table it will be apparent that the Shibkuh district is for the most part subject to the Governor-General of Fars. The third of J Asalu and Naband group villages constitutes a curious exception, and its transference to the jurisdiction of the Gulf ports, represented locally by the Tamlmi Shaikh Saghar bin Mubarak, is not yet an accomplished fact, though it has been ordered by the Persian Government; the hereditary Harami Shaikh of '’Asalu is still i*esolutely resisting the change. The prime movers in the innovation xtere the Customs Department, who have more influence with the Governor of the Gulf ports than with the Governor-General of Fars, and are consequentlySHI—SHI 912 desirous that the principal Shibhuh ports should be brought under the authority of the former. The two groups of villages to the north of '’Asalu are, it will be seen, managed by the Khan of Dashti whose hereditary dominions they adjoin. The remainder of the coast with its islands is parcelled out among various Arab Shaikhs, namely, the Nasuri Shaikh of Gabandi, the Hamadi Shaikh of Maqam, the ’Ubaidli Shaikh of Chiru, the Al'AU Shaikh of Charak, and the Marzuqi Shaikh of Mughu. Hitherto the Pej-sian Govei nment have exercised little authority over the semi independent chiefs, but should their experiment at ^Asalu prove successful, it is not improbable that, impelled by the Customs Department, they may proceed to destroy the power of the remaining hereditary Shaikhs in the southern part of the district. Up to the present time the local influence of the Shaikhs has generally been sufficient to deter outsiders from attempt ing to farm the revenues of their villages, which the Persian Government would otherwise have no hesitation in handing over to the highest bidders. i he Shaikhs exercise considerable^ powers in their own districts, they settle all civil matters except such as are of a semi-religious character (e.y., matrimonial cases) according to their own ideas of what is right and proper, they dispose of all criminal cases, inflicting at their discretion imprisonment and the bastinado, but not the penalty of death ; and without their per mission no stranger dare engage in pearl-fishing in their territorial waters. The executive and administrative powers of a revenue farmer, as for instance of the Khan of Dashti in this district, are similar to those of the local hereditary authorities, and would clash with the latter if introduced into the same place. At present the southern Shibkuh Shaikhs are the revenue farmers of their own districts.

There are no inhabitants^ but the point forms the landing-place on the mainland at the north-east end of Eushire harbour for all goods and travellers going up country. Goods landed from boats are either dropped by mules at Shif or lie exposed at the edge of the sea; those passing between Bushire and the interior are transferred fiom boat to caravan or vice vevsd at this spot. The route via Shif to Eorazjun is 10 miles shorter than the overland route via Ahmadi. Shif is visible from the high part of the Bushire peninsula; at the former there is nothing but a sand spit on which stands a ruined serai, which affords shelter for two road guards, who run a qaliveh khdneh or coffee shop. The post at Shif is faimed out by the Persian authorities to the Tufangchi Bash! or chief of the road guards who is reported to have paid 5,000 tumdns in 1903 for the place. Ihe road guards do not elect to live at this desolate spot for chaiity s sake and the Tufangchi Bashi recovers more than he paid on the post by blackmail and road-cess levied on charvaddrs and travellers. Approach. —From Bushire to inner anchorage in harbour due west for 11 to 2 miles, then turn north parallel with quarantine island for about 7 miles, at a distance of 1^ to 2 miles from the island, then turn east past Shif island to within about 400 yards from shore. Water shallow all the way and only available for boats of light draught, and then up to half water. At low water only the smallest boats can approach. Landing place. —About 100 yards in extent, at the point of the Shif peninsula; the remainder of the coast is composed of deep mud and coral reefs. Bottom of landing place firm sand; water shallow, small dhows can approach within 30 yards of shore at high water. Camping ground .—Shif is composed of a sandy promontory with small stones, rising to a small hill at its south-west extremity, on which a few huts and a small stone tower are built; greatest length of promontory 800 yards, width at north-east end about 600 yards, on north of village about 400 yards. All this ground would be available for a camp. This promontory is ■connected with the mainland of Dashistan by a strip of mud and sandy flats nailed the Mashileh, at this place about 2^ miles across. This is covered by the sea at spring and neap tides, otherwise it is dry, and would be suitable to camp transport animals on. Water. —No local water; a small rain-water tank holding a few g' a lfl |n ^ &gt; all other water is imported. The nearest water-supply is Hasan Nadu (Hamandani), 8 miles to north-north-east, where there is a tank of rain water and some brackish wells. Mules coming from the interior, ^ ® r dropping their loads, are hurried back 20 miles or so to water at Khushab, or other villages on the higher plain. Supplies. —No supplies available; a certain amount of barley and wheat is brought to this place for shipment in native dhows, but this is an uncer am supply, and would not be available at all seasons. Note. —-The place is quite unsuitable as a landing place for any body of troops, as it does not completely avoid the serious obstacle of the Mashile , as no water, and is only approachable at high tide.— (P eljy Stack Cui zon &gt; ^. —Foreign Department Gazetteer, 1D05—Newcomen, 1904 — Hewlett, rJlz.)SHI—SHI 92'2 SHIJAIRAT— A division of the Bani Hai'dan tribe (g-v.).

The priest here is similar to those in Kal Fara in every respect. There were remains of cuneiform characters about in each of these groups. In front of the cave, some 300 yards distant, are some long mounds extending for about two hundred yards and about 30 feet high; these may cover some ruins, and they certainly would be worth investigation.— {Report of a Journey through the Rakhtlarl Country to Shushtar.)

It is situated on the right bank of a stream in a fertile and well-watered plain about 7 miles wide, surrounded by mountains. Rich gardens and vineyards exist in its vicinity. The stream, which sometimes has a certain volume of water from December to April, is usually dry for the rest of the year, the water being used for irrigation purposes. It empties itself into the salt lake, the upper, margin of which is perhaps 12 miles from Shiraz in a south-easterly direc tion. Five miles south of Shiraz, the valley is separated from an extensive marsh by a low range of hills. The city, quarters and population.— city is irregularly circular in shape, flanked by semi-circular towers, rising some feet above the parapet which is bounded by a dry ditch. Both towers and wall are m bad repair; the latter, in some instances, having fallen and filled up the ditch, so that it is quite easy to ride through the gaps. The southern wall is in tolerable repair. The circumference of the wall is about 4 miles, but in more recent and peaceful times the suburbs have become enlarged, so that the original outline is no longer clearly traceable. Shiraz, like all other Persian towns, has a certain number of deserted houses, which are allowed to fall into ruins, though it compares favourably with most of them in this respect. More than half of the enclosed area of the city is taken up with bazars, maidans, the Governor’s place, gardens, stables and other public buildings, leaving the remaining space for occupa tion by the inhabitants.SHI—SHI 924 The city has six gates, viz., 1, Isfahan; 2, Bagh-i-Shah; 3, Kazarun; 4, Shah Dah; 5, Qassab Khaneh; 6, Sahd : and is divided into 11 quarters. A writer in the Farsnameh-i-Nasirl, published in 1895, quoting a census stated to have been taken in 1883, gives the total population of Shiraz, at the latter date, as males 25,284 and females 28,323; total 53,6(17.

Assuming that the whole population has been increasing, even slowly, during the past twelve years, it is estimated that, allowing for an extraordinary mortality of 5,00,0 during the cholera epidemic of 1904, the numbers at the present time (1905) cannot be less than 60,000 persons of aid classes. In former days the first five quarters of the city, as above, and forming its eastern portion, were known as Haidar Khaneh, from the devotion of their inhabitants to Sultan Haidar, ancestor and spiritual head of the Safavi dynasty; the remaining five, or western quarter were called the Ni’mat Khaneh from Shah ISfi’mat Ullah, founder of the Darvish order, bearing his name. These distinctions, often leading to conflicts of a sanguinary nature between two factions, have almost disappeared in the last sixty or seventy years. The Shirazi is of a less mixed Iranian type than is encountered elsewhere, as is evident from the darker complexions and clear-cut features, the brown hair and blue or grey eyes of the northern provinces being rarely met with. The cheerful temperament attributed by early travellers to the inhabitants has been somewhat exaggerated. They are easily excited and sometimes prone to outbursts of intolerance. The BabI movement started in Shiraz and has always claimed a large number of disciples, while the population includes a certain proportion of Armenians. The Mullas of Shiraz bear an unenviable reputation for intolerance and fanaticism, and may be regarded as the greatest obstacles to education and civilisation.SHI—SHI 026 length by 120 yards in breadth, made of yellow burnt brick With a vaulted roof, 22 feet high, and a central dome at the inter section of its arms. It has numerous skylights, which, with its doors and windows, always admit sufficient light and air, whilst the sun and rain are completely excluded. This bazar is allotted to the different traders of the city, all of whom have their assigned quarters, which they possess under strict regulations, and it is well supplied with goods imported from India, Constantinople and Russia. The shops display good specimens of work in gold and silver, as well as of copper and brass work, cotton-goods, tobacco, spices and dried fruits, and European tinned and other goods. Local provisions of excellent quality of butchers' meat (mutton), bread, vegetables and fruit—the last of most luscious appearance and quality—are found in abundance. The Ark, or citadel, in which the Governor-General of Pars resides, is a rectangular building about 80 yards square, with large open spaces on three sides. The palace within is far from being an elegant structure; the pillars of the Divan Khaneh, its greatest ornament, having been removed by Agha Muhammad Khan to adorn his palace at Tehran. Frequent earthquake shocks have caused much damage to several of the principal buildings. The parishes of Shiraz have been celebrated by many different persons, and notably by Hafiz (the Anacreon of the East) who was a native of this city and is buried in a small garden, about half a mile north-west of the town. The tomb of the poet was erected by Karim Khan, and is a plain block of white marble in the form of a coffin, on which are inscribed two of his poems and the date of his death. His works are not, as has been stated, chained to his tomb; but a splendid copy of them is always kept in an adjoining house. The simple dignity of the great poet's resting-place has, however, been sadly marred by the erec tion over it in 1701, by Prince Shu'a-us-Saltaneh, Governor-General of Ears, of a tawdry, painted, iron structure surmounted by tin flags. Not far from the tomb of Hafiz is the garden of Jehan Numa, known in the time of Karim as the Vakil's garden. It was formerly reputed to be the most beautiful in the neighbourhood of Shiraz, but is now almost entirely shorn of its former charms. Other gardens are the Bagh-i-Takht, the property of the Shu'a-us-Saltaneh; the Bagh-i-Nau, the property of the Imperial Bank of Persia and the residence of their European officials; the Bagh-i-Iran, Dilkusha and Gulshan. The last, the property of the Quvvam-ul-Mulk's younger son, Nasr-ud-Dauleh, is now the finest garden of Shiraz. In a gorge behind the garden of Dilkusha, and about a mile and a half north of the town, in a little walled garden, is the resting-place of the immortal Sa'adi. At one end of the garden, is a building containing some small rooms in the centre and an arched divan on either side, in one of which with plain, white washed, unpretentious walls, behind a tall brass lattice or screen, reposes the sarcophagus of the poet. This is an oblong chest of stone, open at the top, and covered with inscriptions in Arabic. Stack considers the most remark able relics of antiquity near Shiraz to be three wells on a rocky hill 2 miles north-east of the city, the origin of which is unknown. They are probably older than the Muhammadan conquest. The hill is about 500 feet high, and very steep, seemingly composed of sandstone and limestone. Two of the deepest of these wells are on the side facing the city, the mouthm SHI—SHI of the larger being about 7 feet by 5, and its depth nearly 500 feet. The shaft evidently sinks through the whole depth of the hill, and is hewn in the solid limestone and smoothly cut; the side being perfectly plumb. The third well at the back of the hill has seats, or ledges, cut in the rock above it. Remains of old fortifications encompass the summit of the hill, while from the topmost peak the whole plain of Shiraz can be seen, as well as the salt lake of Meharlu, £0 miles to the east. The city itself is a compact area in the landscape, overhung with smoke, and adorned by three blue domes. History and Adyiiyiistratio w.-r-Most historians have agreed that the city of Shiraz was founded in or about the year A.D. 694 by Muhammad, sou of Yusuf Zaki; but Curzon dissents from this version and ascribes its more probable and original foundation to the Achemenian or Sassanian kings. The city was much improved and beautified by the Dilami rulers, of whom the Samsam-ud-Dauleh, son of the famous Asad-ud-Dauleh, was the first to surround it with a wall 1£ miles in circuit. The various dynasties of the Atabaks, who governed Fars with Shiraz as their capital, still further adorned it. The city continued during the 15th century to grow in prosperity till, with the disappearance of local dynas ties and the centralisation of Persia that followed on the accession of the Safavi line, it lost much : of its importance. With various vicissitudes, the decline of Shiraz continued till 1751, when Karim Khap Zand, ruling on behalf of a Safavi puppet, rebuilt the walls of stone which had disappeared, and further adorned the city with many beautiful buildings. A\ ith the fall of Lutf 'Ali Khan and the triumph of the Kajars, the stone walls were levelled to the ground and replaced by the present mean erections of mud, and Shiraz was degraded from the rank and appearance of a capital to that of a provincial town. Its government, however, remained an appanage of royalty, and has usually been held by a member of the ruling family. Path 'All Shah was Governor-General of Fars in his uncle's lifetime, and, when Shah himself, deputed more than one of his sons to the post. In the reign of the late Shah^ Nasr-ud-Din, the office was filled by several of his relatives. The most conspicuous of these was an uncle, Farhad Mirza, who earned a widespread reputation for bad government and piti less severity. Fars was one of the many governments united in the person of the Zill-us-Sultan in the early eighties. A succession of weak but rapa cious governors has resulted in later years in riots in Shiraz itself, and in the unsettled condition of the whole province of Fars. The Quvvam-ul- Mulk, the hereditary mayor or Beglar-begi of Shiraz, was largely responsible for the most serious disturbances, brought about by a system of raising money which not infrequently commends itself to Persian Governors, but less so to the people. It consists in buying up all the available grain and reselling it at greatly enhanced prices. This proceeding caused a riot in 1886 which was suppressed by force by the Quivvam. In doing so he inci- dently shot down some of the populace in the mosque of Shah Chiragh. This act of sacrilege caused him to be held in the greatest detestation by the people. In 1891 occurred the tobacco riots in which the leader was a fanatical Mulla HajI Saiyid 'All Akbar. Seized and banished for his share in the disturbances, he was nevertheless permitted to return in the ensuing year, when he was greeted with frantic enthusiasm by theSHI—SHI 928 populace ai}d henceforward.became a power in Shiraz. In 1892, on the assumption of the Governorship by the late I£ukn-ud-Dauleh, a relation of Nasr-ud-din Shah, the Quvvam was degraded, imprisoned, and forced to leave the city, but, on the Rukn-ud-Dauleh himself falling into disgrace with the central authority, he re-entered the city with the incoming Governor in 1893 and returned to his old tactics of “cornering” the grain. The Quvvam-ul-Mulk, in addition to his office in Shiraz, is also the nominal Ilkhani of the •’Arab and Baharlu tribes, and by quartering a number of these in the city, and dispossessing the townspeople from their dwellings to accommodate them, as well as by degrading the copper coinage in value, he still further increased his unpopularity. A riot of a serious nature in which Saiyid 'AH Akbar was a copspicuous leader was the result, and in the suppression of it the most lamentable weakness and incapacity was displayed both by the provincial Governor and by the Shah himself. The disturbance was only quelled by the Quvvam being again forced to leave the city, and by the demands of the populace being granted. Although the riot was in no sense directed against the English, the lives of the Indo- European Telegraph staff and of the British Agent in Shiraz, an Indian by name Nawab Haidar 'Ali Khan, were for some days in jeopardy. One of the most recent Governors, the Shu’a-us-Saltaneh, a younger son of the present ]Vfuzuffar-ud-Din Shah, who succeeded to the Governorship in 1901, incurred considerable odium by his harsh government and by again “ cornering ” grain; and a somewhat serious riot resulted, during which the Persian telegraph offices were wrecked. During the disturbances the Quvvam-ul-Mulk was appointed Acting Governor, but he did little to satisfy the people, and the prince was eventually reinstated. This Prince is reported to have greatly broken the power of the Mullas during his tour of office. Governors since 1904 .—This same Prince was reappointed Governor- General of Ears in 1904; but his rapacity and bad government led to further serious disturbances, and his removal after a second period of some 18 months of office. The consulate buildings at Shiraz belong to the Government of India, though that consulate is now under the Foreign Office, London. January 1906 Vazir-i-Makhsus arrived for the purpose of enquiring into local grievances. His powers, however, were not definitely stated or known, and it was clear that Shu'a-us-Saltaneh still hoped to return to Shiraz. The leaders of the popular movement were with great difficulty restrained from taking bast in His Majesty's Consulate and would have done so, had not news been received that Iqbal-ud-Dauleh had been appointed Governor-General, a result which was ascribed to representations by His Majesty's Legation. Vazir-i-Makhsus “busied in dislodging the Shu'a-us-Saltaneh's family and the Sardar Akram, and in attempting to arrive at a settlement of the burning question at issue between Shu'a-us- Saltaneh and the people of Pars regarding certain crown lands, including, as was contended, the main bazar of Shiraz purchased by the Prince in 1905 from the Shah. He was not successful, however, and in June the question had reached white-heat. A crowd of 300 or 400 notables and merchants took bast in929 SHI—SHI the Residency gardens, and remained for nearly a fortnight, until they were partially reassured by the announcement through His Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, that 'Ala-ud-Dauleh had been appointed Governor-General with full powers to deal with the question. He arrived early in June 1906 and was partially successful in dealing with this matter, and in restoring order on the Bushire-Shlraz road. A Persian of the old school, with, at heart, a distrust and dislike for all foreigners, he displayed at the outset strong personal hostility to His Majesty's Consul, but subsequently assumed a very friendly attitude. He was recalled in November at the instigation of Shu'a-us-Saltaneh, much to the disappointment of the populace, who even attempted, at the bidding of the clergy and notables, to prevent his departure. The latter part of his administration was marked by a recrudescence of road robberies. 1907.—He was succeeded temporarily by Prince Mu'aiyid-ud-Dauleh who pending his arrival, appointed Hablbullah Khan (now Qawam-ul- Mulk) and Khabir-ud-Dauleh (of the Persian Telegraphs) as his deputies; the latter was afterwards superseded by Nasr-ud-Dauleh, the Qawam’s younger son. Exactions on the Bushire road continued, though a greater degree of security was maintained. In February 1907 the news of the appointment of Prince Mu'aiyid-ud-Dauleh, with Qawam-ul-Mulk as his Vazir, became publicly known; the latter, who jointly with his kinsman Nasir-ul-Mulk had been retained in Tehran since the autumn of 1905, arrived in Shiraz in March and was well received. Nasr-ud-Dauleh was shortly afterwards appointed “ Rals-i-Qushun' of Pars. The Qawam’s party seemed firmly established in power, but discontent and disaffection, the product m the main, it would seem, of the Constitutional agitations, which were then rife in Tehran, threatened to attain serious dimensions before long. The condition of the Bushire-Shiraz road remained deplorable; robberies were frequent; the posts were regularly robbed and in no case was redress obtained; an abnormal amount of wilful damage was perpetrated on the telegraph lines. 'Ala-ud-Dauleh practically closed the Church Missionary Society school in Shiraz by threatening to flog severely any boy attending it; on the other hand he facilitated in a large measure the settlement of numerous outstanding claims by special official deputed by the Persian Government for the purpose. Mu'aiyid-ud-Dauleh arrived in April 1907 only to leave two months later. He was succeeded by the aged Husain Qull Khan, Nizam-us-Sultaneh, a man of some distinction and great wealth, with a reputation for firmness and capacity. The hopes .raised by his appointment were, however, doomed to disappointment ; his failure was scarcely less complete than that of his predecessor, owing in the main to the political uncertainty, which arose out of the constitutional disturbances at Tehran. He left in Novem ber 1907, Khabir-ud-Dauleh, Telegraph Master, acting in his stead. The departure to Tehran of the Shiraz deputies in April 1907 was made the occasion for a great popular demonstration directed against the QawamI faction, and, for the first time, Saulat-ud-Dauleh entered the town at the head of a large body of Qashqai tribesmen in support of the Constitutional-SHI-SHI • 930 ists; the disorders which followed lasted until the beginning of June; when popular demands were satisfied by the departure of Qawam-ul-Mulk for Tehran. Disorders recommenced for a short time in August, but it was not until October that they attained serious dimensions, consequent on the arrival of Saiyid 'Abdul Husain, Lari (or Shushtari) ; fighting continued steadily, uninterrupted by the arrival of the sons of the Qawam or Saulat's departure in November, until January 7th, when a truce was patched up. Two months later, however, the town was thrown into the widest disorder by the murder of Qawam-ul-Mulk by a man who was said to be a servant of Mu'tamid-ud-Di-wan; the outrage was followed by the attempted murder of the Qawam's eldest son, when attending his fathers's obsequies. The Qawamis were not slow in wreaking vengeance on those alleged to be res ponsible for those outrages; one man, Saiyid Ahmad, DashtakI, who was accused of the attempt on Salar-us-Sultan, was killed on the spot, his body burnt and his bones thrown into a well; the other principal victim was a Mujtahid of some repute, by name Shaikh Muhammad Baqir. Shortly after this, His Royal Highness Zill-us-Sultan arrived and succeeded in restoring order in a large measure in the province generally by arranging for the departure of the Qawam's sons to Europe, while the anger of the shiraz populace was appeased by the execution of the two principal roughs of the Qawami faction. 1908.—During the interregnum of Khabir-ud-Dauleh, a modus vivendi was established between the two parties, the Qawam-ul-Mulk on the one side, and the religious leaders weaving a mast of Constitutionalism on the other. In February 1908 the Wazir-I-Makhsus, under the new title of Sahib Ikhtiyar, was appointed Governor-General, only to be superseded by His Royal Highness Zill-us-Sultan, whose appointment was notified in March; Sahib Ikhtiyar, however, continued to hold office until the end of 1907. In May 1908 the Zill-us-Sultan arrived; the awe inspired by his name sufficed to keep the trade routes in excellent order even before he arrived. He failed to impose any effective control upon such tribes as the Kuhgalu and Lashani, nor did he do much to settle British claims; it must be re membered, however, that he found the province in a state of complete •disorganization and that he was actually in Shiraz for only two months. He was dismissed after the Shah's coup d’etat in July, and with his departure vanished all hope of a stable government. Asaf-ud-Dauleh, who had previously occupied the post in 1902, was appointed in his stead; the news of his appointment was received with derision and on his arrival in September 1908 his orders were treated with contempt. His Deputy, Sardar Flruz, arrived on July 16th and continued to administer affairs with a single eye to his own profit until the arrival of his chief. The Arab tribes were placed by the Zill-us-Sultan under the control of his son Akbar Mlrza, the Mu'tamid-ud-Dlvan, an old enemy of the Qawamis, being pishkar: the principal result of this was the latter's murder by Muhammad Gull Khan, brother of 'Askar Khan, though the victim was at the head of 800 men and two guns. This murder coincided with the dismissal of the Zill-us-Sultan and the appointment of Asaf-ud-Dauleh,931 Sill—SHI who arrived in Shiraz about the same time as the Qawami brothers; the latter’s services were at once requisitioned by the Governor-General. The elder brother^ Salar-us-Sultan, was despatched against Saiyid * Abdul Husain, Lari, who had raised the standard of revolt against the Shah; Nasr-ud- Dauleh was entrusted with the task of restoring order amongst the Arabs. They were also called upon to pay large sun&gt;s of money in aid of the local treasury ; both brothers met with very indifferent success in their respect ive missions, a fact which induced some merchants to endeavour to provoke an agitation against the Governor-General. The movement, however, being &amp; unaided by cash subsidies, collapsed, as also did an attempt on the part of the Mullas to start a movement against Muhammad ’Ali Shah after his cou/? d’etat. All evidence points to the conclusion that the Constitutional movement was never a genuine one in Shiraz. Saiyid ’Abdul Husain was at the end of 1908 strongly established at Lar, having inflicted a severe defeat on a force of Arabs sent against him under ’Askar Khan. 1909, —Asaf-ud-Dauleh was dismissed in July and the Zill-us-Sultan nominated, but the Bakhtiari coup d’etat in Tehran was fatal to his appoint ment and he was replaced in the same month by ’Ala-ud-Dauleh. The event brought Saulat-ud-Dauleh to fighting point and he declared cate gorically that ’Ala-ud-Dauleh should not enter Fars as Governor-General. He also showed himself disposed to maintain his puppet Asaf-ud-Dauleh in power, but was prevented by pressure brought to bear by the British Consulate; he secured, however, the appointment of the ’Ain-ud-Dauleh, who, however, had to make room only four days later for Sahham-ud- Dauleh. Sahham-ud-Dauleh showed himself without delay to be a most remarkable type of Persian ; he arrived on September 20th entirely without guards and, when a force of 120 Persian Cossacks arrived, his authority seemed secured. His extremely independent attitude commended itself, however, neither to the religious fenders nor to Saulat, whose dismissal he attempted to secure, but without success. The end of his regime was consequently imminent and he was dismissed in January 1910. His rule was an excellent blend of ancient principles with modern practice; he kept administration in his own very capable hands, uniting an extraordinary personal energy with an equally unusual administrative capacity, thus the new Constitutional experiment is Shiraz was in hands which were hot only strong but clean. Its failure in such hands must be regarded as definitive. His gravest error of judgment was the nomination of the Nasr-ud-Dauleh as Deputy Governor in December 1909, an appointment which was no enhancement of the latter’s dignity ; while it gave gratuitous offence to Saulat-ud-Dauleh. 1910. —During the following years the situation continued to go from bad to worse. The local authorities had failed to take any punitive action in connection with the attack on the Russian Consul-General’s party and lawlessness was at a premium. His Majestys’s Consul at Shiraz was of opinion that the only remedy would be a British punitive expedition; but this view did not commend itself to higher authority. In February a league was formed between the Shaikh of Muhammarch, the Wall of Pusht-i-Kuh and Saulat-ud-Dauleh, of the Qashqai, underSHI-SHI 082 the name, of “ League of the South.” While professing high Constitutional aims ; this League was really directed against the growing power of the Bakhtlari under Sardar Assad and as such acted as a useful warning, if accomplishing nothing more. The Razarun route remained closed throughout the year, the Saulat- ud-Dauleh having been successful in forcing traffic on to the Jirreh route, in spite of the objections of the whole commercial community. Zafar-us-Saltaneh succeeded Sahham-ud-Dauleh in February, but after showing his incompetence for 5 months, he was dismissed in July. During the interregnum which followed, Qawam-uI-Mulk acted as Governor-General, an appointment much resented by the Saulat-ud-Daulah. In April Mr. J. H. Bill, I.C.S., having made overcharge of the Consulate at Shiraz to Mr. Smart, proceeded on leave via the north. He was attacked between Abadeh and Shulgistan by robbers and lost two sowars, though not before his escort had killed two of their assailants. During September the situation in Fars became worse. Finally, on October 14th, the patience of His Majesty^s Government having been ex hausted, His Majesty's Minister was authorised to present a Note to the Persian Government to the effect that, if order were not restored on the Bushire-Shlraz-Ispahan road within three months, we should insist on the formation of a force of road guards under British officers. This step roused the Persian Government momentarily, and Nizam-us- Saltaneh was appointed Govern or-General. The Persian Government at the same time undertook to supply him with ample funds for the creation of a special Corps of Road Guards. 1911.- Nizam-us-Saltaneh arrived at Bushire in January and was met by the Saulat-ud-Dauleh at the head of several hundred Qashqai tribesmen. Ihe Nizam-us-Saltaneh was an able but unscrupulous man with large interests in South-IVest Persia, which, it was hoped, would enable him to keep the balance between the contending factions. His calculations were upset, however, by the Saulat's action in coming to meet him in Bushire, and on his arrival in Shiraz in April he was already committed to hostility to the QawamI faction, against whom he w 7 as further prejudiced by old family grievances. He had the QawamT brothers arrested on April 15th and announced his intention of trying them on various criminal charges, some punishable with death. An appeal to the Government in Tehran, strongly backed by the Bakhtlari faction, resulted in an order for their release on condition that they left Fars for Europe. On May 7th they left Shiraz with an escort of 50 sowars and were ambushed the same day near Khan-i-Zinian on the first stage out. Nasr- ud-Dauleh, who was ahead and mounted on a mule, was killed, but Qawam- ul-Mulk, who w T as riding on a horse some distance behind, escaped and, galloping off, managed to reach the British Consulate by circuitous routes next day. There is little doubt that Nizam-us-Saltaneh and the Saulat were both concerned in this murder. The latter a man of boundless ambition, was bent on profiting by the disorders feigning in the province and forcingSill-SHI 933 himself into the same predominant position, as a tribal Chief, as that held by the Shaikh of Muhammareh and the Bakhtiari Khans in their respective limits. By the middle of July hostilities had broken out between the Nizam's adherents in Shiraz and those of the Qawam headed by his wife and only son. During August and September contingents of Ghshqais and Arab and Baharlu tribesmen began to arrive in support of their separate factions and by the middle of September some 1,200 Qashqals were engaged in con tinual desultory fighting entrenched in the commercial quarter of the town against an equal number of Arabs outside. The Nizam had been dismissed in July, but did not finally leave the town till October 4th, when the Saulat-ud-Dauleh withdrew his forces prior to moving into winter quarters. The casualties sustained by the rival factions during these three months' hostilities are estimated by reliable authorities at not less than 460 killed and many more wounded. Not only was great damage to property com mitted but tribal enmities have been aroused, which will be remembered a generation or more, while the prestige of the Central Government has received a blow from which it will be difficult to recover. Until April the condition of the Bushire-Shiraz road was fairly satisfactory though occasionally closed by the Nizam's operations at Kamarij. Fre quent robberies, however, occurred between Shiraz and Ispahan. During the summer, the situation momentarily improved, but by October the Bushire-Shiraz road was again completely closed, and on the Shiraz- Ispahan road robberies on a large scale were of frequent occurrence. On October 12th a large caravan with over £2,000 of British goods was robbed near Abadeh by Kuhgalu tribesmen and Miss Boss, medical practi tioner, maltreated. ^ , A few days later a body of 300 Persian soldiers was attacked near Yazdikhast, losing 10 killed and 20 wounded. On October 30th Miss Ross, when attempting to continue her journey to Shiraz, was again attacked, stripped and maltreated. She was ultimately brought in from Abadeh by a squadron of the 39th Central India Horse, who had been sent to escort her. Owing to the appointment of the Nizam-us-Saltaneh and tlm announce ment of Persia's intention to establish an effective Road Gendarmerie under Swedish officers, a further respite had been allowed to the Persian Government regarding the formation of a local force serving under British officers for the policing of the Bushire-Shiraz-lsfahan route, as foreshadowed in the British note of October 1910. . The recent constant robberies on the road, however, led to a reconsidera tion of the outlook. On October 10th the Persian Government were informed that owing to the insecurity at Shiraz and elsewhere, His Majesty s Government were compelled to strengthen the Consular Guards at Shiraz, Isfahan and Hushire. The Persian Government were, however, assured that the Consular escorts would only be utilised for the protection of British lives and property and the Consulates at Bushire, Shiraz and Isfahan, and that, if the Persian Government could devise a scheme for the effective protection of the trade routes, the troops would not patio 1 the roads.SHI—SHI 934- Two squadrons of the 39th (King; George's Own) Central India Horse, under Lieutenant-Colonel J. A. Douglas, arrived at Bushire on October 27th and reached Shiraz without further incident on November 12th. The third and fourth squadrons disembarked at Bushire on November 11th and one full squadron proceeded on to Shiraz. On • November 18th the squadron for Isfahan left for that place ac companied by an additional 100 men as far as Abadeh for the escort to Miss Ross. Both parties arrived at their respective destinations on December 5th. While Miss Ross's escort met with no incidents on their return journey, the Isfahan squadron fell in with a party of robbers beyond Yazdikhast with the result that Risaldar-Major Ghulam Muhammad was severely wounded in the leg, two of the robbers being also wounded. A party of 30 men of the 79ht Carnatic Infantry, who left Shiraz on Nov ember 28th for Bushire, arrived without mishap at their destination, but a caravan a short distance ahead of them was attacked and looted between Khan-i-Zinian and Dashtarjan. On December 19th a third and last detachment of 50 men of the Central India Horse left Bushire for Shiraz with Mr. Smart, who was rejoining his post as Consul at Shiraz from leave. A similar party left Shiraz at the same time under Major Birdwood to join hands at Kazarun. This party was fired on from the Kutal-i-Dukhtar pass and one sowar killed. This outrage was organised by Muhammad 'Ali Khan of the Kashkuli section of Qashqais and Deputy Governor of Kazarun. Colonel Douglas at once despatched a second party of 50 men to hold the top of the pass for the return journey. On December 26th Major Bird wood's party left Kazarun to effect a juno tion with the party under Lieutenant Fraser from Bushire. The junction was effected without mishap, but, on returning to Kazarun together, the party was treacherously fired on from a caravansarai. This was a signal for a general attack by about 800 tribesmen, mostly inhabitants of the villages in the Kazarun plain. Two followers were killed and seven sowars wounded, while a hospital assistant and one follower were missing. Mr. Smart, who was riding some way behind, was slightly wounded, and, falling from his horse, was captured and taken into Muhammad 'Ali Khan's camp. He was well treated and sent in on December 9th. The squadron fought their way into Kazarun, where they were no further molested. The force left Kazarun on January' 2nd, joining up with Colonel Douglas, who had moved out to the Kutal-i-Dukhtar to meet them, and reached Shiraz without further mishap on January 5th. This outbreak may be largely attributed to the cupidity of the nomad chiefs, who feared that the restoration of order along the roads by our troops would involve the loss of blackmail, which the various Khans along the road had come to regard as a permanent source of income. It was, however, unfortunate that the Consulate in Shiraz, by being compelled to give (( bast ' to the Qawam, had become in the eyes of the Qashqai tribesmen pledged to his support*. There was consequently a widespread belief that the ulterior object of the arrival of British troops Pt. II 3 T.935 SHI—SHI was to attack the Qashqai and curb the licence they had enjoyed for some years. The landing also synchronized with a general feeling in Islam of antagonism to Christendom in general, and in Persia of violent resentment against Russian action in Northern Persia and in a less degree against us in the South on account of our apparent concurrence in her doings and a suspicion of our own designs in regard to the South. This feeling had been considerably augmented by the Mullas and local press. Subsequent events have proved that the excitement caused by the despatch of British troops to Shiraz was but of a temporary nature. 1912.—After the departure of the Nizam-us-Saltaneh from Shiraz in October of the preceding year the post of Governor-General was held by the Q.awam-ul-Mulk pending any fresh appointment being made from Tehran. Early in November 'Ala-ud-Dauleh, who had previously twice held the post with some success, was appointed. He was, however, assassinated at Tehran in December before he had started to take up the position. Early in 1912 Mukhbir-us-Saltaneh was appointed, but he did not reach Shiraz till October 16th. He was a man with but little experience of the administration of so backward and turbulent a province as Ears, but he showed himself anxious to hold aloof from local factions. His attitude of impartiality was facilitated by the resignation of Zaigham-ud-Dauleh, half brother of the Saulat, of the Ilkhaniship of the Qashqais, to which post he had been appointed by 'Ala-ud-Dauleh and the Qawam under the title of Sardar Ihtisham. The Saulat was reinstated as llkJianl, hut solely as a tribal chief and without any invitation to take part in the administration of the province. The Daria Begi, late Governor of the Gulf Ports, accompanied Mukhbir- us-Saltaneh as Commander of his Military Forces. On account of the attack on Mr. Smart’s escort, the headquarters of the 79th Carnatic Infantry, then about to return to India from Makran and consisting of 260 men under Lieutenant-Colonel Andrews, were landed at -Bushire in the last days of December. They were relieved in the following November by a wing of the 2nd Queen Victorians Own Rajput Light Infantry under Major Dunsford. During the year various measures were discussed by His Majesty’s Gov ernment for the despatch of a punitive force to Ears to exact reparation for the numerous outrages of the preceding year and to secure the security of the Southern routes. On October 5th the squadron at Isfahan was withdrawn to Shiraz, where it arrived without incident on 22nd October. On the 11th December a party of 26 sowars of the Central India Horse with 17 followers and 17 baggage mules under Major Kettlewell, accompanied by Captain Eckford, had proceeded for some days’ shooting to the Dashtarjan Lake, 40 miles from Shiraz. The party left with the consent of the Governor-General, who considered the district safe, as it was supposed to be under the protection of the Swedish Gendarmerie. The party was, however, ambushed between Khan-i-Zinir.n and Dashtarjan by a largeSHI—SHI 936 body 6f tribesmen, estimated at between 200 and 300 men. ambuscade Captain Eckford Was shot through the heart. Early in the Unlike previous attacks on British officers during the year, robbery seems to have been the sole motive and the ambuscade formed part of operations against a large caravan, which had left Khan-i-Zinian in front of the party. The robbers, of whom two were killed and three wounded, appeared to have been composed of a mixed band of Boir Ahmadls, Mamassanls and Kashkulis, the raid being undertaken with the cognizance of Muhammad 'AH Khan Kashkuli. The party returned to Shiraz without further molestation, but of a party of Gendarmes in the neighbourhood four were wounded. As previously narrated, the Persian Government had intimated their intentionin 1911 of forming a Gendarmerie under Swedish officers for the protection of the trade routes. The Swedish officers engaged arrived in Tehran in the autumn of 1911. By February 1912 one officer had been sent to Shiraz, to be followed a month or so later by two more. It was not, however, till August that any attempt was made by the Swedish officers to put the force they were engaged in raising to any practical test. In August, however, Major Siefvert and Captain Nystrom with 80 mount ed, 180 foot Gendarmes and one mountain gun marched towards Dirigun, about 20 miles south-south-west of Shiraz, where they encountered a force said to be acting under the instructions of the Saulat-ud-I)auleh. The greater part of the infantry Gendarmerie fled without firing a shot and were captured with their arms. The remainder stayed rather reluctantly with the Swedish officers and fought for some time, but ineffectually. The breeeh block of the gun blew up and the gun was soOn Out of action. Major Siefvert was wounded in the thigh and the tribesmen eventually with drew. On December 18th two Swedish officers, Major Brandel and Captain NystrOto, arrived at Bushire from Shiraz for the purpose of enlisting recruits for the Gendarmerie. These they hoped to utilise on the Bushire-Shiraz road in the spring of 1913. British and other Foreign officials .—The British Political Resident in the Peman Gulf, who is directly under the Indian Foreign Department, also holds the office of Consul-General of Fars under the Foreign Office in London. Whilst his residence for most of the year is at Bushire, he usually spends some of the summer months at Shiraz. His residence here is in a fine, extensive garden, about half a mile outside and to the north-west of the city, immediately adjoining the Bagh-i-Shaikh, in which are located the office and houses of the staff of the Indo-European Telegraph Company, who have a qualified doctor. In July 1903, a British Consul was appointed with a permanent residence at Shiraz; while a few months later the British Agent referred to above was retired. Other Foreign Powers directly repre- aeiited here are Russia and France. In the case of the former country, the arrangement approximates with that made by Great Britain; their repre sentative Being Consul-General for the Province of Ears, with residence 3 T. 2937 SHI—SHI for most months of the year at Bushire. The Russian Consulate is also situated to the north-west of the city, but on its immediate outskirts. A French Consular Agent has been appointed for the first time and as lately as 1905. The Indo-European Telegraph Company have one of their most important branches located, as mentioned above, in the Bagh-i-Shaikh. The admin istration of the line, from Shiraz southwards to Bushire and northwards as far as Abadeh, is invested in the Superintendent in charge. Telephone communication is kept up southwards with Dasht-i-Arjan and northwards with Sivand. The Imperial Bank of Persia also has one of its chief branches established here, in charge of a manager with several European assistants. This Bank was established in 1889 under a British Royal Charter, a concession for its formation having been granted by the Shah to Baron Julius de Ruyter. It is for all practical purposes the State Bank of Persia and enjoys the monopoly of issuing a paper currency. The notes thus issued are only guaranteed negotiable with the branch of issue ; but to a reasonable amount, by arrangement, they are practically negotiable at all branches. The offices are located in the western portion of the city ; while the residences of its European officials are in the Bagh-i-Nau, situated in the fine avenue leading through the suburb of Deh-i-Buzurg, about half-way between the archway through the Quran Hivdeh Man and the Isfahan gate of the city. Climate and Sanitation .—The plain of Shiraz, dotted with gardens and small villages, well watered and highly cultivated, is girt about with barren mountains, snow-capped during the winter months; but with the exception of the Kuh-i-Barfi to the west, seldom retaining any vestige of snow after May. The climate is, on the whole, dry, though heavy dew falls in the spring, and during the cold weather there is a moderate rainfall. The winter, lasting from the beginning of December to the middle of February, is usually not severe, though it generally freezes at night, with occasional heavy falls of snow. On the plain this seldom remains for more than a few days at a time, though the sur rounding mountains are snow-capped for some months. The weather in spring is very genial and pleasant, but the sun begins to be hot in the middle of the day in April. July and August are the hotest months, but fortunately the nights are comparatively cool, especially in the open. All travelling from May to September is usually done in the early morning or evening, and this holds good throughout the interior of Persia. The direct rays of the sun are felt through the day rarifying the atmosphere out of all proportion to the general temperature. The temperature seldom remains at a high degree for more than three or four days at a time; but a south-west wind during the summer months is often unpleasantly warm and relaxing. In spite of the praises lavished on the climate by former travellers, there seems little doubt that it is often trying to Europeans, and there is a consensus of opinion amongst residents that the climate is less good than at first sight appears; though excellent in winter and spring, it is spoilt in the summer and autumn by the prevalence of malarial fever. There was a severe cholera epidemic in 1904.i SHI—SHI 938 General Climatic Conditions. Rain may be excepted between 21st November and 15th April ; occasional showers from the latter date to 31st May. Rain rarely falls more than three days in succession. Snow may be expected at any time between 15th December and 1st April, rarely later than than date. On the Shlraj plain it seldom lies for more than a day, but on the passes between Shiraj and Kazarun (Kutal-i- Dukhtar, Kutal-i-Pir Zan, etc.), it may lie from three to eight days or even longer. A like remark applies to the higher portion of the road from Shiraz to Yazd-i-Khast (Isfahan). Cold .—During the cold season, which may be taken to extend from 1st January to the middle or even end of March, the nights are often intensely cold. Thus on 28th January 1905 at 7-30 a.m., the thermometer stood at 17° Fahr. and on January 10th 1907, at 5-30 a.m., at 18° Fahr. Such excessive cold, however, would appear to be rare from the fact that orange and lemon trees grow unprotected in and round Shiraz. Heat begins about the end of June or beginning of July lasting till about the 26th of August, when (to judge from the experience of three summers) there would appear to be always a marked fall in the temperature. Hot days occur after this date, but a succession of hot days is rare. (This fact is known to, and noted by, the Persians, who ascribe this change to the rising of “ Satareh-i-Khunuk ”—cool star.) Even during the hottest weather the nights are generally cool. Occasionally when the warm wind blows from the south or south-west the nights are unpleasantly warm. It is both possible and beneficial to sleep in the open air from May to October or even later. No shelter is required. Up to the end of September there is prac tically no dew and only occasionally after that date. There is sometimes a recrudescence of heat in October. W'ind .—The prevailing wind would appear to be from south-west—often in summer hot and enervating. No facilities for gauging winds. Marching seasons .—The best are from 1st April to middle or end of May, and from 21st September to 15th November or even later in the year. There is an utter absence of sanitation or any organised system of drain age, each house having its own badly constructed cesspool, cleared out at the will of the individual, thus rendering the whole sub-soil saturated with refuse matter. The water itself is good, but, owing to a bad system of transporta tion into the town by means of qantits, which are in some sections open, it is easily infected and during an epidemic practically out of control within the city walls. Considering the unsanitary condition of the town with its badly planned and crowded houses, dirty, narrow streets, uncontrolled water- supply and absence of any system of drainage, Shiraz is singularly free from epidemics of specific diseases ; and the reason why the more or less periodic (usually annual) epidemics of diphtheria, small-pox, enteric, chicken- pox and measles do not cause a larger mortality is inconceivable. These epidemics usually occur either in spring or autumn, with dysentery some what severe during height of summer. Epidemics of cholera occur at intervals of a decade or more ; the disease being imported either from the Gulf or from the western frontier. The last epidemic of 1904 was, in comparison with that of former years, very severe, the mortality beingSHI—SHI 939 probably not less than 5,000. The specific infectious diseases—typhus, rubella, intermittent, scarlet, dengue and yellow fever, beri beri, plague, hydrophobia, and actinous cases—are practically unknown, at least during the five years ending 1905. Cases of anthrax, tetanus and leprosy are occasionally, though rarely, seen. The only striking points about the health conditions (5 Shiraz are the marked number of cases of diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva, dyspepsia, ascites and venereal diseases. AgricMlture—The vicinity of Shiraz has been mentioned as exceedingly fertile. Cereals, vines, melons, vegetables of all kinds, opium, cotton and tobacco are extensively cultivated. Fir, cypress and orange trees also thrive, though the last named are not found farther north. The vineyards have been much extended of late years, and particular attention is paid to oultivation of the Khullar grape as making the best wine. This grape takes its name from Khullar, a village lying a short distance from Shiraz. Sir Thomas Gordon in his remarks on Shiraz writes that the climate is here so temperate and equable as to bring together the fruits and birds of the east and west, north and south. For here the Indian f bulbul/ and' hoopoe J meet the European nightingale, the magpie, and the cuckoo, and the fruits range from apples to dates. Locusts cause much damage to crops in certain years, and the failure of the grain harvest is the not infrequent Consequence. In 1893, two-thirds of the opium and the greater part of the cotton crop were destroyed by these pests, while the wheat crop in the neighbourhood of Shiraz also suffered considerably. In the ensuing year, it was calculated that taking a circle of 60 miles round Shiraz as the district from which in normal years the town derives its supply of wheat, it might fairly be assumed that out of the crop of 20,000,000 maunds (of 6^ lbs.) five-sixths were eaten by locusts. Industries .—The chief local manufactures carried on in Shiraz are— Gilims, or rough carpets without pile. These are made of wool or goats* hair. Some are exported to Aden and Jiddah, but the majority are for local use. The finer kind of carpets of wool or of camels* hair known as Shiraz, are made chiefly by the Iliats, by whom they are brought into Shiraz, for sale. These carpets have a good reputation both in regard to their texture and their patterns. Saddle-bags are also made of the same material as carpets waft, gilims and are exported in fair quantity. Hamad, or felt, used for rugs, coats for men and clothing for horses. Tents and curtains—HL&amp;dLQ of a rough cotton cloth called “ Karbds,” similar to the Indian dunguree. The tents are in great local demand, but are also exported to '’Arabistan. The curtains are used for screening the sides of houses from the sun and, in winter, to promote warmth. “ Karlas ” the cloth above mentioned. “ Hassdji ” are native coloured cloths, used as sheets, towels, etc. “ Tirimeh ” shawls, an imitation of the Cashmere shawl, but of an inferior class and only used locally. Inlaid work, an industry for which Shiraz has long been famous. All sorts of articles, such as picture-frames, boxes, etc., are made for export, but as the demand increases, the workmanship deteriorates, and the very fine work of the past is almost a lost art. Wages have not increased in proportion to the cost of living.SHI—SHI 940 Silver work is a specialty, and the productions much sought after by Europeans. Qalidns, the hukah of Persia, some of which are very beautifully worked in the precious metals. The bowls are generally formed of a cocoanut, the more costly description mounted with silver and gold. The prices vary from Is. to £30. Rough brown paper made from rags of an inferior kind. Country soap made from fat, ashes, and lime. It is used for washing clothes and in the public baths. Soap is not an article in great demand in Persia. Small arms. —Guns, pistols, and even revolvers are made by hand. The action of the Martini-Henry has been copied and really good weapons are turned out, the best being valued at £25. Shot guns and matchlocks are the most usually made and are sold to villegers and tribesmen, but the makers are unable to compete with the imported article and the trade is deteriorating. Gunsmiths in Persia are quite capable of replacing a broken gunstock. Swords, daggers and cutlery .—The manufactures of Shiraz were once famous and there is even now a demand for their wares in Turkish Arabia and Turkey. This industry has much declined since the introduction of firearms, but there is still a fairly large local demand. As cutlers the Shlrazis are expert workmen, but they find it hard to compete with machine- made goods. Combs made of ebony, sandalwood, etc., find a considerable local demand and are largely exported to India and Jiddah. Matting of a better quality for prayer and sleeping mats, and also a common quality of reed mats. Papier Mache. —This was once a considerable industry and included the making and painting of fancy articles such as pen-cases. It has now declined and inferior articles only are manufactured. ^ Silk. —Formerly an extensive industry, which has now been lost sight of owing to the disease among the silkworms. Glassware.- —Imported goods have stunted and almost ruined this manu facture. It is now restricted to the making of bottles for the export of wine, rosewater, and lime-juice. Earthenware. —This manufacture gives employment to a large number* of people. It includes the making of kiln-baked jars for wine and vinegar making, sun-dried jars for storing grain, lamps and pottery for various household purposes, and bricks both plain and ornamental. Lime. —Of fair quality for local requirements, and a good quality of cement is made. , ' Tanning skins- —Provides employment to a number of people. Print making. —Though insignificant as compared with the same industry in Isfahan, it is not inconsiderable. Starch-making. —Starch made from wheat is largely used in the manu facture of sweet-meats. An inferior quality is made for sizing cloth. Henna .—Is in great demand as a dye and there is scarcely a street with out its henna shop. «i 941 SHI—SHI fl ats Both of felt and Astrakan are largely manufactured. The latter are chiefly used by the townspeople, the better classes using real lambskin and the poorer, imitation Astrakhan. A large trade in felt hats is done with the tribesmen. ^ ^ . , . . , Oil, —Is made from linseed and sesame. The latter is used for food as well as for burning. - • Foot-wear, in the shape of malikl, a shoe of which the upper part is woven of cotton, and the soles made of rags beaten into hard rolls, and strung together on several strips of leather laid lengthwise, is a specahty of bhiraz manufacture. They are exported to all parts of Persia as well as supplying a large local demand. Wine and Arrack.—The wine of Shiraz is freely made and sold publicly by Jews and Armenians. Tavernier in 1666 gave the annual produce of Shiraz as 4,125 tons of 600 pints each. It is of two kinds, red and white. The former has the appearance of, and tastes like, dark sherry, and the latter like a moist, thin Chablis. It is ridiculously cheap, being sold at about bd. a bottle. It is kept in large jars and sold in glass bottles of varous sizes, holding from a quart to two or three gallons. The manufacture of these bottles gives employment to a large number of people. Vinegar. —Made from the juice of the grape with a quantity of salt added. ^ a ^___Obtained from the mountains and the salt lake : very cheap. I)ary produce.—Aho forms an industry, especially the making of e raughan &gt; or clarified butter. Wool, raw, and woollen textiles.—Whilst a considerable quantity of raw wool, both work and pasham, and goats' hair is produced m Pars and exported through Bushire, mainly to England, very little is handled in ohhaz itself. The clipping season is on just before the nomad tribes move from the yaild([ or warm country, where they spend the winter, to the sard sir or upland region, and the clip is collected either by nomad chiefs or by traders and sent down to Bushire. All export business is done from the ports. The wool produced in the interior is all used for carpets and blan kets. There is a large export trade in carpets with Egypt, Jiddah and Baghdad. The value of this trade in 1904 is stated to have been tumdns 500,000 (£83,330). Kirman carpets are sold in grades at a certain price per carpet zar ’. Qashqal and Arab carpets produced in Ears are, however, sold by the piece and not by measure. oolen goods are im ported in limited quantity by the European firms here, from whom the few shop-keepers, who handle this class of merchandise in the bdzdts, aie replenished. The retail dealers are known as Simsdzes or Stmsdrs. Cotton. —The trade in raw cotton is now almost entirely with Russia. It has been seriously checked by the Russo-Japanese war, but, even so, Persian growers and dealers find the Russian market offers them better prices t an does Bombay. Some cotton is still, however, sent to Bombay, where it is used for mixing with better qualities. The cotton passes in pure ase from producers to middlemen and thence to shippers. Some 4,000 bales o cotton are used locally in the manufacture of a coarse cloth of narrow w i &gt; resembling the Indian garreh and known as karbds. The prices in^ E 0 the raw cotton ranged from 3| brans to 6j brans per Tabrizi man o 6^ lb's./ SHI—SHI 942 Cotton fabrics. —Till very recently the British manufacturers and shippers had the market entirely in their own hands, and Russian stuff was rarely seen on the market. Now, however, Russia has begun sending her fabrics, and especially her prints, down south, and the bazars are full of Russian pro duce. The rush is an artificial one entirely, and every sale entails heavy loss to the Russian manufacturer and Government. The average loss by the varying exchange is great, and to this must be added drawbacks and other accommodations and assisted freights. The Russian prints are copies of English designs, lacking somewhat in finish, but the cloth, though narrow of width, is universally described as good, though more coarse than English, unloaded and dyed in fast colours. Since Russia began to work in Shiraz it is said British imports have fallen off by about 4,0U0 bales per annum. Madder. —No madder is produced in the vicinity of Shiraz, but about 1,000 cwts. of root are handled on the Shiraz market. Shiraz imports this from Isfahan, Yazd and Abrqub. About 300 cwts. are exported again, going mostly to Bombay. The rest is used in Ears. Price per kharwdr (650 lbs.) tumans 8$ to Opium. —Three thousand chests (of 27 tumdn Tabrizi) are exported to Hong-Kong and to England, and 500 chests used locally. The heavy ex port duty placed on opium, lately increased from 5 to 14 per cent, ad valorem, and the fact that it used to be very largely adulterated with gum ganjideh (O F) hit the export opium trade very hard. There are many grades of opium. Prices range at present according to quality from 20 tumdns to 34 tumdns per Shiraz man of 7'25 lbs. Gum, tragacanth. —Shiraz is the great collecting, sorting and distributing centre for the gum, some of the stuff, about 30,000 mans Tabrizi, coming from as far away as Rafsinjanand Hamadan. Some of the best and purest gum, though this is not equal to the best that finds the sea at Ahwaz, is produced near Bajgah, not far from the town. The United Kingdom and India take about half of what Persia produces, and Russia about a quarter. The gum is sorted into five main classes. In sorting, the waste averages 4 per cent.

Ganjideh. —This is tasteless and odourless gum, which looks not unlike gum arabic. A few years ago the gum was almost valueless. Then its use as an adulterant for opium was discovered.

Opium is still adulterated with ganjideh, but mostly for the home market, and, though enquiries have been made from China, where men would not mind getting hold of such an excellent adulter ant, ganjideh quotations have now dropped to 10 krdns and 4 krdns.SHI—SHIThe Shir Kuh bounds the valley of Deh Bala on the north-west side.

SHISH DANGER—(or Sarhadd-i-Shish Nahach), The most northerly district of Fars: the summer quarters of the Qashqai and possibly also of a few Kuhgalu tribes. The sedentary population is estimated at 3,000. It is bounded on the N. by Chehar Mahal, on the W. by the Kuhgalu and Bakhtiari country, on the E by Chehar Mahal, Isfahan and Abadeh-i- Iqlld, on the S. by Chehar Dangeh. SHISH DEH— Lat. 28° 55' N.; Long. 54° 2'E.; Elev. 4,670'. A village in the Fasa district of Fars, lying rather north of east from Fasa town and 25 miles from that town on the road to Darab. It lies in a plain of the same name, and contains 200 houses. The inhabitants number 700, and are of a somewhat forbidding cast of countenance and inclined to be rude and uncivil. They own 60 oxen, 1,500 sheep, and 50 donkeys, but no mules. 6,000 mans of barley and wheat and 80 mans of poppy seed are sown here annually. The plain is shut in by high hills and mountains. It extends from the west to east and south-east and is of inconsiderable breadth. The plain has numerous water-courses, some dry, some with running water, and a number of wells about the Kaleh Kara Bulagh por tions. The soil is exceptionally good and rich, nearly approaching that of the black earth zone of Southern Russia.— {Abbott — Preece, 1884.) SHISH PlR (River) — A river in Fars which rises between Dilkhan and Ardakan, west of the Gardaueh Yuzgird, at an elevation of 7,800 feet. The river issues in a stream 20 feet broad and 2 feet in depth, from underneath a rock in the hills. The water is intensely cold and flows rapidly down the valley in a south-westerly direction. It is crossed 8£ miles from Ardakan on the road to Bakum by a small bridge, with 2 main arches and 4 smaller ones. The parapet is of stone and is one foot high; the roadway is 8 feet, and is paved and clear. At this point the river comes from a cleft in the hills to the east. In January it is easily fordable on both sides of the bridge. One mile from here it is joined by the Ardakan stream. At 161^ miles south of Bakum the river is crossed by the road from that village to R'idian. It is here PtII 3 w951 SHI—SHI a fine clear stream, 50 feet broad and 18 inches deep, and very swift. From here it runs between precipitous cliffs and disappears, emerging again at lludian. At Kudian it is crossed by a wooden bridge made of trunks of trees and mud and stones. The bridge is very shaky and is quite impassable for guns. It is joined here by another considerable stream, both of the rivers being unfordable in -most places. The river then flows west towards Kaleh Safid which is perched on a cliff on its left bank. The river is bright, deep and clear, with bright green water. It is said that Shiraz was in former days supplied with water from the Shish Pir valley.— (Durand — Vaughan, 1890.) SHITALlYEH— A canal in the Fallahieh district of Southern ^Arabistan on the right bank of the Jarrahi river, with which it is connected.

It is a sandy and has no trees. Petween this island and Pu Shu'aib is a channel less than a mile broad, which is not less than 3 fathoms, and between it and the mainland there is a channel, 5 miles broad, with rocky bottom and irregular soundings, which is dangerous. The channel between Pu Shifiaib and Shitvar is not considered safe, unless to persons acquainted with it, as the reef does not always show, and the soundings have little or no change until you are upon it. Shitvar is politically dependent on Maqam, but it is unin habited and visited only by the inhabitants of Pu Shwaib for fishing, and for pearling on some banks which adjoin it.— (Taylor — Bruchs—Persian Gulf Pilot, 1906, — Lorimer, 1906.)

SIIIYAKHlN— A section of the Ka'b tribe (q.v.). SHI YU— Lat. 27° 4' 22' N.; Long. 52° 8' 50' E. One of the Shibkuh ports of the Persian coast; it is situated about 39 miles east-south-east of Naband and 773 miles west-north-west of Charak. Half a mile south-east of the village is a peaked hill about 250 feet high, and a hill about 120 feet in height, behind the village, carries a tower; there is also a fort in the place itself. A large flat, black rock, projecting into the sea in front of the village, forms a small boat-harbour and is the best landing-place. The anchorage at Shiyu is said to be tolerably well sheltered, close in, from the shamal; but there must be a considerable swell. A moderate amount of good water is contained in wells close to the beach. Shiyu consists of about 150 stone houses and huts, partly of Arabs and partly of Persians from Lar, etc., the people are mostly SunnisSHU—SHU 952 and are engaged in trade, navigation and pearl-diving, but have also culti vation and date gardens. Shiyu is the port of the Gabandi district, and carries on a considerable trade with the ports of the Persian Gulf generally, and also with ’Oman. Here are owned 15 trading-vessels, 9 sailing-boats used for pearl-fishing oil the west side of the Gulf, and 24 small baqdrehs which are used for fishing and pearling upon the coast under the Gabandi Shaikh. Shiyu is subject to the Gabandi Shaikh, and the annual revenue of the place, amounting to 70,000 krdns, which till lately was payable to the Khans of Lftr, is now payable to the Governor of Bastak : not half the nominal revenue of the place, however, is realized, and coercive measures are avoided on account of the expense they would entail. Shiyu has recently received a considerable accession to its population through immigration from Kangan and Tahiri. The immigrants were sympathisers with Sulai- man, the Nasuri Shaikh of Tahiri, whom the Khan of Dashti expelled by force of arms in 1904 A.D., in consequence of a quarrel fomented, it is said, by the Salar-i-Mu’azzam during his Governorship of the Gulf ports.— {Loruher, 1906.) SHU’AIB, 15f miles on a bearing 8 degrees north of west from Hawizeh, is a settled village of the Bani Salih containing about 150 adult men, and between o00 and 600 souls living in permanent dwellings built and thatched with stout reeds from the adjacent marsh. Apart from the produce of the bultivation of the ground in the immediate vicinity, the inhabitants also go m extensively for spearing and netting fish. Ihe village is prettily situated on both banks of a small stream at the point where it enters the marsh. This stream, entering from the north, receives the waters of the Hawizeh stream^ when flowing, but is also joined by other feeders from the north, and is said by the inhabitants never to become entirely dry. They are thus able to maintain communication with Amarah throughout the year, and the village possesses 12 or 15 bellums which ply for hire and convey passengers and merchandise to and from that place. They have also water communication with the Shatt-el-Arab at Swaib opposite Qurneh, but seem seldom to use that channel.— (Cox 19l ( ) ) SHU’AIBIYEH-Lat. Long. Elev.

SHUR (River) (1)— A river in Luristan, which is crossed by the road from Bandar Abbas to liar, 3U miles from the former place. Its bed, which at this point is ot considerable width, is composed partly of a limy, yellowish clay covered with an efflorescence of salt, and partly of firm sand, the former predomi nating on the right bank, the latter on the left. At the crossing the water which is salt, is some 60 yards in breadth and about 3 feet in depth. The river empties itself into the Clarence Straits which lie between the island of Qishm and the mainland, and from a few miles north of Latidan down to its mouth it flows nearly due south. Above this point its course is not known with any certainty. The survey map shows it as rising o the east of Lar and following a semi-circular course through unexp oie country down to Latidan, while according to Curzonbs map it rises neai Eurg and, after flowing east-south-east for some 45 miles, turns nearly due south, which direction it maintains until it reaches the sea. Opposite to Latidan the river is spanned by two bridges, said to have been built by Haji Khulassia, an Isfahan Khan, some 150 or 20U yeais ago. One of these was described by Butcher at the time of his \isi m 1888 as a substantial stone erection with 33 piers and semi-circular arches, but both are now (1905) in bad repair and useless.

The original city covered the whole between the Shavur and Karkheh rivers, some IJ miles, and extended even beyond the latter. The mounds on the left bank of the Shavur cover a space of over 6 miles in circumference and are in three concentric tiers. The uppermost tier or citadel, still known as the Keleh Shush', is 120 feet high with a perimeter of 1,100 yards at the base and 850 yards at the summit. The second tier, representing the old palace, is some 70 feet high with a perimeter of some 2£ miles. The French Government have obtained a concession from the Sh ih for the excavation of antiquities throughout his dominions ; and a party under M. de Morgan have been occupied in this work here since 1898. They have built them selves a spacious kaleh in which they live for some seven months of the year : while the treasures which they have unearthed, and which in part are of extreme value, are despatched to the Louvre to enrich the incom parable treasures already collected in it. Close to the river’s edge is the reputed tomb of Daniel the custody of which is in the hands of a Saiyid. The shrine itself is admittedly empty, the legend running that the coffin, which was of grass and contained the body as well as the record of the pro phet, is buried beneath the waters of the river which were diverted for the purpose and then brought back into its present and original course. The shrine is the resort not only of Jewish, but of Mussalman, pilgrims from Shusbtar and Dizful, who alike hold it in great veneration.— [Foreign Department Gazetteer, IVOb — Arbuthnot, 1905.) SHOSHTAR (City)— Lat. 23° 3' (H N.; Long. 48° 53' O' E.; Elev. 400'. General description. —The official capital of Northern 'Arabistan is situated at the northern extremity of the Mianab in the angle formed by the division of the Karun into its branches of the Shatait and Gargar. The city stands on somewhat elevated ground, in part of the ordinary alluvial soil of the country, and in part of the ruins and rubbish heaps of ages : though over hanging the Shatait, where its course bends due south, the ground runs up to a sandstone cliff 100 feet high, on which stands the citadel. Except at this point, the left bank of the Shatait near the town is low and usually has a long, shelving beach of shingle. The Gargar, on the other hand, runs between steep banks some 20 to 30 feet above the water's level. Besides the engineering works on these two branches of the Karun— vide articles on each in this Gazetteer—mention must be made of the Minau canal which traverses part of the town and waters a considerable portion of the Mianab. This channel leaves the Shatait by a tunnel through the citadel rock, and, running for some distance underground, emerges near the head of the Pul-i-Qaisiri, or Pul-i-Dizful : thence it passes through a deep cutting to the south of the town and under the Pul-i-Lashkar into the open country. The discharge of this canal, measured in March when running 5 feet below its maximum level, was 970 cubic feet per second. Its width was 60 feet, depth 6 feet, and surface velocity 5 feet per second. There were formerly hree exits from the town. The first to the west over the Pul-i-Dizful is interrupted owing to the bridge being' broken downSHU-SHU 958 in the middle, and its place has been taken by a ferry: the second is by the Pul-i-Lashkar into the Mianab : the third over the dam by the Pul-i-Bulaitt to the east and connecting with a village of the same name, which is virtually a suburb of the city. The houses of Shushtar, though of some height and architectural pre tensions, are mostly old and in bad repair, while some parts of the town are in ruins and deserted. The majority of the houses are provided with subterranean chambers, lighted by vertical shafts, called shavvdddns or sardabs, which run down to a depth of some &lt; 0 feet and are designed to mitigate the heat of summer (reaching to 120° Fahr. on occasions) and with flat, parapetted roofs about 30 feet from the ground. The sanitary condition of the town, chiefly due to the public streets being made the re ceptacle of domestic sewage, is indescribably foul: but as the ground has a natural fall matters are improved by rain, instead of becoming aggra vated as at Dizful. The daily bazar is carried on a narrow, open space, on which sheds or lean-Ws against ruined walls have been erected. The permanent shops are mostly located in the street leading through the centre of the town on to the Pul-i-Bulaitl. The chief architectural features of the town are a large Jama* mosque standing on an eminence near its southern end, a lofty, leaning minaret, about 20 other mosques, some with blue tiled domes, and some 15 imdmzddehs and kadam,galis. A camping-ground of some 6 acres is available, when not under cultivation, on the south side of the arsenal. For any larger ground it would be necessary to go across the river Shatait on to its right bank. Inhabitants. —The present population of Shushtar is about 12,000 souls, but the place seems to be declining. The great bulk of the inhabitants are of an indigenous type, commonly supposed to be Assyrian, but of mixed breed: and they are generally called Shushtaris. They speak a Persian patois resembling, but distinguishable from, that of the Dizfulis. They are Shl^ah Muhammadans: their most prominent sections being the Saiyids, the Khawanin, and the Mashaikh, numbering respectively, 1,000, 500, and 500 persons. The town itself contains no Arabs and but a few Bakh- tiaris. The opinions expressed by travellers on the ShushtariV temperament, disposition and morals are various and very conflicting. LayaixFs was that they were bigots in religion, while he describes their women as noted more for their beauty than their morals. Other travellers have described them as tolerant and on the whole moral. A latter day opinion on them is that, in comparison to the more northern Persians of Isfahan and Tehran, they are more narrow-minded and less adapted to European manners and inter course generally. In this respect they have exhibited on several occasions acts of fanaticism towards Europeans from which the latter have been free in other localities. The town is divided into four chief mahallehs, each under the direction of a rais. These mahallehs are constantly fighting with each other, and with the no uncommon result of the city becoming as it were in a state of siege, the shops all being shut, and no intercourse possible between the rival factions for weeks at a time. Trade and Industries. —A number of local industries are carried on in Shushtar. Among manufactured articles are coarse woollen carpets called959 SHU—SHU qilims or hardmls : woollen cloths for ’aids (cloaks) : light cotton stuffs for clothing ; turbans and waist-cloths ; coarse canvas givehs (cotton shoes) : coats^ hats and rugs of felt, iron, copper, brass utensils, and Ger man silverware : silverwork : glazed earthenware (kashi) : pack and riding saddles and mule gear. Other occupations are brick and lime making, manufacture of opium, tanning of leather and dyeing of cloth. Such of the inhabitants as are not engaged in these manufactures and other occupations live for the most part by wholesale or retail trade, by agricul ture or by religion ; the residents are builders, carpenters, muleteers and raftsmen. Shushtar is the river port of Dizful, through which all its im ports and exports pass : all Dizful merchants therefore have agents or correspondents at Shushtar. Ihe principal merchants in. either place are Messrs. Lynch Brothers, whose representative here was formerly an Eng lishman, but latterly, and in 1905, an Aimenian. Tiade methods aie similar to those at Dizful. The Shushtar man is equal to 15-487 lbs. avoir dupois. Water and other supplies. —The water-supply is naturally unlimited. Supplies, except fuel which comes from 'Aqili and the jungles on the Diz, are drawn chiefly from the Mianab. Eood-stuffs and forage cannot be called abundant, but in good years there are considerable stocks of both in the town. There are 20 flour-mills in working order on the Gargar, but there is only sufficient water to run 10 of them in the dry season. About 800 mules are said to be owned by Shushtaris, the greater number of which are always absent, grazing or on caravan. In this respect Major G. H. Arbuthnot in his report (1905) on the mule-pi-oducing districts of Persia II — Shushtar and Dizful {vide also this Gazetteer—Northern 'Arabistan) writes :— “ There is no market for mules in the town of Shushtar itself, neither can it be said to be a ‘district ’ from which such a supply is obtainable. There are a limited number of mules in use for agricultural and such pur poses, while an equally limited number, locally owned, are engaged in the carrying trade wuth Dizful and Isfahan.” Administration. —Shushtar, though inferior to Dizful in size and pros perity, is the head-quarters of the Persian Administration in Northern •’Arabistan. This distinction it no doubt owes to its strategic importance with regard both to its situation geographically and its accessibility from the Karim river [vide this Gazetteer—Gargar (Ab-i-) ]. The citadel or kaleh, formerly known as the Kaleh-i-Salasal, but now generally styled simply Kaleh-i-Hukumati, is situated on the rocky bluff where the Shatait branches off and contains the palace of the Governor-General ; while on the lower ground to its west stands the arsenal, with a considerable open space between it and the town. The kaleh, which is constructed in several tiers, might well have withstood a siege in former days, but is now commanded at short range by part of the town, and at longer ranges from the hills on the west bank of the Shatait. A small garrison is in evidence when the Governor-General is in residence ; but is withdrawn to Dizful or elsewhere when he leaves the place. There are at Shushtar a Persian Post office, telegi aph office and customs house.SHU—SHU 960 The revenue levied is a part of that levied on the district though collected separately. This ; assessed in lump sums upon the different trade guilds, is collected by the head of each guild, and paid by him to the Mustaufi. The following are some of the principal heads under which revenue is collected :— Per annum. Turn ins. Baqqdls, or general dealers 300 Bazzdzes, or cloth merchants 200 'Attars, or grocers and druggists 120 Hardmbdfs, or carpet-weavers 150 Coppersmiths ..... 140 Millers ...... . . from 600 to The ferry on the Shatait (a monopoly held by the Governor-General) — 600 tumans per annum. The revenue of the flour mills is collected by a curious double method. The mill-owner first takes for himself one chehdrak for every man ground, and the Government farrash at the same time takes 2 siah pul in cash from the owner of the flour for every man ; afterwards the money received from the persons patronising a particular mill having been totalled at the end of every week, the owner of the mill is required to deliver to Government one man of flour for every krdn which has been collected by his customers. The administration of public charity and of education is in the hands of Mujtahids, who, before the advent of the present strong Governor in 1905, virtually ruled the town as regards internal matters, though the more im portant of the Khawanin had a voice in public matters. The chief Mujta- hid of Shushtar (in 1905) is Haji Saiyid Abdul Samad, who is a large land* owner and professes friendship for the British. Of his two sons, Haji Agha Muhammad Ja’afar and Haji Ahmad, the former is middle-aged and has a considerable part in the management of his father’s affairs, and, though he does not seek intercourse with Europeans, is civil to those whom he meets. The second Mujtahid family in importance is that of which Shaikh Muham mad ’Ali was the head until his death in 1904 : and of the three sons surviv ing him the most influential is Muhammad Javad. There is an Imam Jumeh at Shushtar as at Dizful. Shushtar is not now a natural political centre, and if the Persian Governor and Mujtahids were to be withdrawn it would probably fall into obscurity.

SHUSHTAR (District) — One of the two districts into which Northern ’Arabistan {tide this Gazet teer) is divided; the other being Dizful. The boundary between the two is a line passing between Pavindeh and Kahunak in the noith through a point east of kut ’Abd-ush-Shah in the south.961 SHU-SHU Produce avd trade .—The winter crops are wheat, barley, poppies, and vegetables: while the summer crops are rice, linseed, gram, millet, maize, cotton and other vegetables, including melons, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Other products are wool, ghi, sheep-skins, hides, and reeds (for pens). Petro leum or naphtha is found at Darreh-i-Nafth, about 20 miles south-east of Shushtar city, and bitumen on the Ab-i-Diz. Shushtar was considered by Sir H. Rawlinson to be one of the best supplied districts in Asia, and, admitting this to be a somewhat exaggerated estimate, it may still be said of it that it compares favourably with the best. Thus the rice or barley after the harvest runs at about krdn 1 per Shushtar maund or roughly about 60 lbs. for the rupee. A sheep weighing 30 lbs. is obtainable from Rs. 2-8 to Rs. 3. The plains about Shushtar become covered with grass from early February increasing until May, after which it disappears as rapidly as it has sprung up, and the whole country once more becomes a parched and barren desert. Opium is largely grown and its cultivation is yearly in creasing and superseding, in value at least, that of cereals. The production of, and trade in, the latter, e.g., barley and wheat, is much interfered with by the senseless imposition of an embargo placed upon its exportation at the will of the Governor-General, which is said to be exercised entirely, or usually, to his personal gain or advantage. As a general statement it may be said that all attempts in trading on any large scale are checked by the chilling influence of Persian rule. With proper encouragement the district might hold its own commercially and agriculturally with less favoured centres now far ahead of it in prosperity. N. B .—The value of the tumin {krdns 10) fluctuates between Rs. 2-8 and Rs. 3. Imports .—Shushtar city is the sole trade-centre. Its imported goods may be tabulated as follows:— Obtained from Description of article. Abroad, through Muhan- mareh and the Karun. Piece-goods, sugar, tea, matches, candles, iron, copper, lead, German silver, stationery, liquors, leather footwear, glass ware and henna. Arabs .... Wool, ghi, curds, skins, hides and sheep. BakhtiSri . . Wool, ghi, gum tragacanth and other kinds, charcoal, goats’ hair, and sheep. Also from the ’Aqili plain come rice, linseed, firewood, honey, vegetables, salt, hides, donkeys and a local cement. BizfQl .... Cotton, indigo, rice, beans and fruits. Isfahan .... Dried fruits, almonds, walnuts, tobacco stamped cloths, givehs (cotton shoes), and samovars after the Russian pattern.SHU—SIA 962 Hr ports. —The exports, inland and abroad, are— Exported to Description of article.

Finally rifles, gunpowder and lead. Bakhtiari , Same as above, substituting felt kulahs (hats) for chajiyehs and larger supply of barley and wheat. Dizful .... Dates, pottery and petroleum. The revenue of the Shushtar district is assessed at 20,000 tvmdns a year (between Rs. 50,000 and Rs. 60,000), but rather less than half can be counted on being collected.

(south-east point) 25° 56' N.; Long. 54° 38' 40'' E. $ An island in the middle of the Persian Gulf, 40 miles south by west of Bustaneh which is the nearest point upon the Persian coast. In shape the island is a truncated wedge, 3| miles in length from east to west, 2^ miles broad at the eastern end, and 1 mile at its western extremity ; it is low, sandy, and bare of natural vegetation, with many small detached hills of dark colour, none of which exceed 50 feet in height. The island is sur-, rounded by a reef extending two-thirds of a mile from shore. On all sides the sea is deep at more than | mile off shore, and on the east and south east deep water comes close in; the anchorages are all indifferent; the best is to the southward. There are two permanent villages on the island : Bilad Zara’ieh and Bilad Ghavavis. The former is situated towards the north-east corner of the island, and consists of 12 mud huts tenanted by Abu Dastur Arabs; the Abu Dastur are one of the divisions of the Arabs of the Persian coast, who are known under the general name of A1 Paris; in religion, those of Sir! are Sunnis of the Hamball School. The village possesses a date-grove of about 550 trees, and the inhabitants cultivate a little wheat and barley and some melons and onions for their consumption. Irrigation is from a group of 12 wells called Tui Na’amih, about 6 fathoms deep, which provide a fair supply of good water ; but it seems that at some previous time water was more plentiful than it is now, and the cultivation of the village more exten sive. Livestock at Bilad Zara’Ieh are 20 donkeys, 12 well bullocks, 12 milch- cows and 400 sheep and goats. There are no boats. Bilad Ghavavis is situated on the south-eastern coast of Sin, opposite the anchorage marked in the Admiralty chart. It is occupied by forty families of Sudan and 30 of Huwalah all originally from the coast of Trucial ’Oman; they are Hambali Sunnis, and as the name of the village implies, they subsist chiefly by pearl diving. At this village there are no animals and no cultivation, but the people own 15 sambuqs for pearling on the Arabian banks and 30 small baqdrehs which are used for pearl-diving and fishing round the island. Their drinking water is from a single well called Bu Sur, about 600 yards north-west of the village, which yields an abundant supply, but it is inferior in quality to tbe water of Tui Na’amieh. There has been a Persian flagstaff on Siri since 1887, and since 1899 it has been located at Bilad Ghavavis. In 1904 two Tufangchw of the Imperial Persian Customs were stationed at Bilad Ghavavis, where they are now in charge of the Persian flag and collect duty on all import reaching the Island not covered by exemption passes from Lingeh. From 1887 until recently, tithes used to be collected on Sin after each harvest by an emissary of the Deputy Governor of Lingeh, and the island is apparently regarded by theSIR-SIR 968 Persian Government as belonging to their Lingeh district; but the title of Persia to Shi is not admitted by the British Government, and the Shaikh of Sharjeh has certain hereditary claims to the island.— ( Bruch—Lonmer, 1906.)

The village lies in a broad elevated valley between two ranges of hills and on both banks of a broad and gravellv dry water-course. Owing to its situation it is not so cool as its elevation TT.nn, °. ne to . su PP° se - South of the town rise the Shir Kul hills some 11,600 feet m height; the town is some 1,000 feet higher than Yazd and is the summer resort of the rich inhabitants of Yazd. It is a very long and straggling village, embosomed in gardens, and half in rums. In summer it has a population of 4,000 to 5,000 inhabitants but in winter only some 800. The houses are said to number 1,400 to 1 500* about a quarter of which belong to Parsis. There is a small mud fort perched upon a rock overlooking the north end of the town, and a celebrated fire temple. Ihe town contains a bazar with about 50 shops, and the gardens extend round it for about 1 £ square miles. Yegetables, forage and firewood are obtainable here, and there is a copious supply of water from numerous977 TAG—TAH streams. There is a good camping-ground to the east of the town, about U miles from the bazar. The transport m the village amounts (1890) to 300 mules and 500 donkeys. The town also possessed in the same year 100 cows and 3,000 sheep. The old dome of the fire temple rises above the trees; it is empty and the doors have gone, but the roof and walls still show beautiful work in blue and sold, with flowered tiles and fresco painting. Over the door, carved m wood is the Arabic date corresponding to the Christian year 1268. Hard by stand the ruins of a shrine built by Shah Niamat Abdul Allah, before he fixed his abode in Mahun.

The handsomest is quite plain, but for the Kalimeh of creed of Islam, cut in the polished yellow stone. Taft is or was, a great place for the manufacture of felt carpets; and it was reported some years ago that there were no less than 30 factories in the town but these are not mentioned in the latest (1905) reports of the place.

One of the Shibkuh ports on the Persian coast; it is situated about 20 miles south-east of Kangan, and 25 miles north-west of Naband. a is situated in a small open bay formed by low points 2 miles apai w u project from the shore on either side of it and carry date-groves. e a y deepens regularly from the coast to 8 fathoms at off-shore.TAH-TAH D78 village built partly on the shore and partly up the side of the coast range behind it, which is here 700 feet high. A square fort stands on a hill at the west end, about 100 feet above sea-level. There are about 150 stone houses inhabited by Arabs and Persians of various tribes; the Arabs are in the majority, and are ShaFi Sunnis; the Persians supply a ShFah element. Estimated population about 1,000. Water is from wells 3 fathoms deep, and there are about 350 date-palms besides cultivation of wheat and barley. Tahiri is the port of the Pallehdar and Jam districts, immediately behind the maritime range, with which it is connected by passes practicable for camels and donkeys. Livestock comprises 10 horses, 50 donkeys, 500 cattle and 100 sheep. The chief exports are tobacco and charcoal from Gallehdar, and salt-fish collected from the neighbouring coast villages. The people of Tahiri are merchants, sailors, fishermen, pearl-divers, cultivators and date-gardeners : they own about 6 trading sambuqs. The fort lies on the extreme right of the village about 150 yards from the houses. Good^ preservation, built about 1885. In the middle of the town is a partially ruined round tower. A similar tower on the extreme left of the town, which runs to 'Oman and Basrah as well as to Gulf Ports, and 4 fishing ’amilehs. In the neighbourhood is a small cape, called Bas Majnun, off which is a pearl bank. Tahiri is farmed by the Khan of Dashti. In 1904 friction occurred between the Khan and Sulaiman, the local Nasuri Shaikh; the result was the flight of the Shaikh, and the emigration of many of the inhabitants and their families to Shiyu and Chiru. There is here a post of the Persian Imperial Customs. The hills inland of Tahiri, at a distance of from 3 to 6 miles from the place, ai e said to be occupied by a Baluchi tribe, who possess a quantity of livestock, chiefly sheep and goats, also a few date-palms; they cultivate wheat, barley and maize. The only claim of Tahiri to distinction is the possession of prehistoric remains and early Muhammadan ruins. The sides of the ravines which come down from the hills to the north-west of the village are pierced with numerous chambers, most of which are inaccessible except by ladders; and in one place the hillside over a space of half a mile square has been worked into tiers of remarkable troughs. This portion is intersectedby ravines, to which a flight of broad shallow steps, cut in the rough conglo merate rock, descends on either side. Here and there pillars of nature rock have been left standing, and the largest of these has been hollowed out to form a chamber. There are many wells in the hillside, one of which is 204 feet deep and contains 36 feet of good water; some of these wells are circular, some oblong, and the diameter is usually 2 or 3 feet; those further up the hill are the deepest. These remains are apparently pre- Islamic; the chambers appear to have been sepulchral, and some of them in 1857 still contained crumbling human bones. On the coast plain immediately west of Tahiri are the ruins of an early Muhammadan town, perhaps Siraf, extending for a mile or more along the coast, and for some distance up the slope of the foothills. These are now mere heaps of rough masonry, but foundations of houses, wells and the remains of water-cisterns of the pattern still common on this coast oblong979 TAII—TAI excavations lined with gypsum-cement and vaulted over—are still traceable. The whole extent of the ruins is strewn with broken pottery including many fragments of Chinese porcelain. The only building in a state of moderate preservation is a mosque of well-cut stone and elegant design with pointed doors and windows. One traveller believes it to have been originally a Christian building, subsequently adapted to Muhammadan uses; some of the decorative carving appears from his account to have been of a floral character. There are many ornamental monolithic tomb stones bearing cufic inscriptions: one of these, now in the British Museum, bears a date equivalent to 991 A.D.— (Constable—Stiffe—Persian Gulf Pilot—Persian Gulf Gazetteer, 1908 — Wilson, 1911.)

It is a narrow corkscrew pass about 4 miles long amidst crumbling hills of argillaceous slate and marl and has the reputation of being a favourite haunt of bandits. In wet weather it is liable to be flooded and rendered impassable, but it can be turned by the open river valley to the west.— (Newcomen, 1905.) TANG-I-DUARNAN— Lat. Long. Elev. 4,700'. A narrow gorge in one of the lower ridges of the Gacha Kuh range in the Pusht-i-Kuh district of Luristan. The track between Charduvar and Deh Bala passes through it at 15 miles from the former, before ascending the Daluva pass. The gorge is 30 to 40 feet wide, and the road only a passage 3 to 4 feet wide between the boulders. The track is well frequented for purposes of local trade by numerous mule and donkey caravans carrying wheat, rice aud dried fruits to Charduvar. No through traffic is said to exist between Kirmanshah and the Tigris valley by this track.— (Maunsell, August 1888.)991 TAN-TAN TANG-I-DUKHTAR-I-PARI— A rocky ndgs 111 tli 6 feliulistEin. district of Puis^ o\tr \\ 1 11 cli tlic ro 8 ,d between Pul-i-Murd and Tang-i-Rudian rises and descends abruptly, over very bad ground strewn with boulders.

TANG-I-GAU SIIUMAR— A long defile through the Kuh-i-Safid, whereby the Kashgan [formed by the confluence of the Ab-i-Alishtar (Khaman) and the Laghn streamj obtains access to the Chigini plateau (a continuation to the west of the Khurramabad plain). It is an important defile, all roads for many miles east and west being very steep and almost impracticable for laden animals. There are, as is usual in most important gorges in South-West Persia, relics of a Sassanian road through the gorge : the track however is now bad and several mules had to be unloaded.— [Wilson, 1913.) TANG-I-G AY ZARDEH— A pass in Luristan in the valley of the Kashgan river some 5 miles distant from Tang-i-Kalhur ; this gorge is impassable for animals, the JAastigan here turns west by north following the general run of the strata f«r abcm 2 miles the gorge being very narrow with steep slopes on either side, me right bank being almost impassable even on foot. It then turns soutnthrough the hill, the path becoming even more difficult, until after another 2 miles of picturesque twisting and turning it emerges into the Chul-i-Hul valley and is joined by the Ab-i-Afrineh, some 9 miles below the Pul-i-Kal- hur,— (Wilson, 1913.) TANG-I-GAZ— Lat. Long. Elev. 7,400'. A gorge in the Bakhtiari country through which the Zindeh Rud flows. It is a wide gorge 3 miles long and passable on either bank of the river, and separatee the Gurgunaki and the Zangra ranges. The extremities of these ranges forming the tang on either side having sloping spurs, over which about 300 feet above the river on its left bank, goes the main track. The flanking spurs are about 1,000 feet above the road and fully command the entrances and approaches.— (Sawyer, 1890.) TANG-I-GHAZI— Lat. Long. Elev. 7,100'. A gorge between the Kuh-i-Khisti and Kuh-i-Chuhi through which the Zindeh Rud forces its way northwards, not far from its sources. The vil lage of Sudaigan lies on the north side of the Tang on the river Duna; a fine grassy plateau lies on the south side. There is good pasture in the valley, and, where growing, the cereals are good.— (Bell, 1884.) TANG-I-GIACH (? GACH)-Lat. Long. Elev. A pass in Ears leading from the Kamarij plain to Kazarun.

TANG-I-HALEH {Oil springs). Such prospective importance as these springs may have for the Oil Com pany would appear to arise from the fact that they are close to the alignment which, I believe, any cart road or railway through Luristan would follow. They are distant about 45 miles from Khurramabad. The springs are five in number at present: one of these I did not see, but heard of later. One is of quite recent origin, the other three are almost choked by accretions of pitch and the liquid brown crude oil can be obtained only by digging a small hole in the centre of the pitch, and then in very small quantity. The newly found spring is a small pool of sulphurous water; gas, not in flammable (apparently partly H2S), is perpetually bubbling up, bringing with it a little crude oil, of brown colour similar to that seen at Masjid-i- Sulaiman. All four springs are close together in the bed of a water-course, amongst cultivation. Geologically they seem to be situated in the centre of a denuded limestone saddle-back, but the strata are very complicated and much con cealed by low hills of alluvium. There is no gypsum near by, though the alluvial soil contains a proportion of decomposed gypsum. The springs yield no revenue to any one. The land in which they lie is said to be “Khaliseh-” (Crown property), but it has never yielded any revenue; the actual owner is Sardar Akram, Nazar Ali Khan, and the actual reveners are his tribesmen.— (Wilson, 1913.)TANG-I-HANASIIK— A defile in Fars, 12 miles north-northeast of Deh Bid through which the winter road from Deh Bid to Yazd passes. The gradients are easy, but ex cept for flanking parties, the movements of troops would be confined to the defile. [Howe, 1906.) TANG-I-HAZAK-YAK (TANG HAZAR CIR)— Lat. Long. Elev.

A pass in Kirmanshah on the road from Kirmanshah city to Baghdad via Mandali. Its elevation is about 5,300 feet. A small stream flows through it from the valley to its north, to the Guar valley south of it. It is about 200 yards in width at the narrowest point to the north, where there are traces of an ancient wall. The ground descends gently through it in a southerly direction for £ of a mile, shortly before which the width of the defile reaches 400 yards; the pass then terminates in the Guar Valley. The hills on both sides are well-wooded, that on the west being the highest, and its topmost peak the most dfficult of access. It is possibly turnable from the west within 2 or 3 miles. It is passable to field guns.— {Vaughan.) TANG-I-KA'B— Lat. Long. Elev. A pass ascended by the Isfahan-’Arabistan trade road above the bridge of Gudar-i-Balutak in a north-east direction for 5 miles: for 3 miles of this distance the old paved road is still largely extant. The ascent is steep, and, in parts, rough and difficult for laden animals : the gorge is wooded throughout, and from 4^ to 10 miles from the bridge the ravine holds water throughout the year.— {Burton, 1903.) TANG-I-KAMAN— Lat. Long. Elev. A defile on the road from Bavanat to Shiraz, 34 miles south-west of the former; at its entrance from the north, the road turns to the west, and for the first half mile the defile is very narrow with precipitous sides; the road is very winding crossing and re-crossing the stream several times after which the defile becomes a trifle more open; still farther on there are a great number of qandts, until, outside the pass, the water is completely drained off. In the pass are the kalehs of Sadatabad, Angahan, and Chah Surkh. The stream of the same name rises under the hills on the north side of the Sar Pariran plain, and flows through the defile.— {Blackman.) TANG-I-KARlM—L at. Long. Elev.

TANG-I-KISH— A george in Luristan near the junction of the Madain Rud and Kashgan rivers. This is a long and difficult gorge, divided into two paths. The first section is about £ mile long and gives access to a narrow valley with some flat terraced slopes on the left bank. At 5^ miles some oil springs were passed which form the subject of a sparate report. At 5f miles the second section of the Tang-i-Kish is entered by a difficult track; • and old ruined fort surmounts a precipitous ridge on the left bank. At 6^ miles the river turns west by north and the caravan track diverges south over the Kuh Kamar Si which is a continuation of the Dalich range.— (Wilson, 1913.)

A break in Luristan in the Kheolah (Glalan) range of hills, which is pierced by the Lailum stream, 7 0 miles from Dizful on the road to Khurramabad. It is passable with difficulty by pack animals. This stream is an affluent of the Ab-i-Saidmarreh, which, traversing the valley between the Kuh-i-Kabir and Kheolah hills, falls into the Karkheh. The hills forming the Saidmarreh valley, the Kabir and Kheolah ranges, are here 2 miles apart; the former, in one long incline sloping upwards to the south, are much cut up by ravines and marked by striae ; the latter rise in almost perpendicular slopes ; the tops of the former are still white with snow in places. This fine gently sloping valley, covering 1,000 yards, by 1,000 yards, is surrounded by low undulations, and is easy of defence, except from the north, where the Kheolah range is steep and accessible only with difficulty by means of the steep ledges of rock, formed by denudation; pasture good.995 TAN—TAN The Lailum stream, here shallow and 20 feet broad, flows in a bed of conglomerate 30 feet deep. By a narrow gorge it here forces its way through the Kheolah range; it is possible to get to the northern side of the range by passing through the gorge. The rocks here are full of nummulites. The river is forded with difficulty after rain. Thermometer, 10th April 1884, 80° at 3 p.m. The passage of the Lailum is difficult owing to large boulders covering its bed.— [Bell.)

It then passes up a dry torrent-bed between two hills of gravelly limestone, after which the ascent continues over rocky ground and is fairly easy. The descent down the northern side which is called the Gardan-i- Khudu, is rather steep and in parts nigged and narrow. Precipitous, and frequently perpendicular, rocks rise on either side of the road, which, though practicable enough for infantry or pack transport, would be very difficult it not impassable, to field artillery.— April 1888.)

The road from Harunabad to Kirmanshah passes between the villages which stand about l mile apart. Below is a small area of walled vineyards fringed with poplars, and some orchards. A fair stream issues from the pass and there are also a number of springs. The plain is cultivated and contains good grazing : many thousands of goats and sheep pasturing on it in summer. The mountain range of Kurkur, which bounds the plain immediately behind Tang-i-Shuvan, contains much oak scrub, the remnants of former forest. The village to the south of the road is the property of the Vakil-ud-Dauleh, Haji- ‘Abdur-Rahim of Kirmanshah, and contains 50 houses : that to the north, of 40 houses, is partly owned by him. The inhabitants are Kalhur Kurds : they own large numbers of sheep and goats and some herds of cattle, also a fair area of cultivated land.—(Burton.) TANG-I-SHUVAN (Pass op) — Lat. Long.

The bed of the pass is 50 yards wide, and through it flows the stream draining the valley to the north-east. The stony hills rise steeply to either hand, to points l mile apart and 500 feet above the stream. The road through the pass is good : the gradient easy and the length traversed 300 yards. In the valley beyond the north-east exit is room for camping ; wood, water and good grazing : a footpath to the Mahi Dasht plain crosses the Kurkur main ridge; to the south-east runs the path, practicable for laden animals, which crosses the same ridge as the Mil path to the Mahi Hasht plain. The Tang-i-Shuvan path cannot be turned in the immediate vicinity, but the Kurkur range is crossed a few miles to the north and south by various passes practicable for laden animals, notably the 'Aliavar, 4 miles south east, which is the road by which the Persian artillery marches to the main road (Kirmanshah-Baghdad) at Harunabad.— (Burton.)

Its maximum length from north to south is about 40 miles ; and the north ern half has a breadth inland of about 20 miles ; but the southern half is merely a narrow strip upon the coast. It includes localities formerly separate entities^ such as Samal and Ahram, and the Khaviz valley. The last named is the only portion in the mountains ; and outside the coast plain. History. At the time of the British war of 1856, when the Tangistams put up a brief resistance, their district was in the undivided control of Baghir Khan. For much longer, however, they had been notorious for their inroads into Bushire. After Baghir Khan’s death the district got gradually out of the control of its own chiefs. For a time the famous Muhammad Khan of Dashti ruled it, subsequently Hasan Khan, son of Baghir Khan. Haidar Khan, a nephew of the above, w T as kept a prisoner at Shiraz for many years previous to 1890. After his return he and his cousin ’Ali Khan ruled alternately, but weakly and badly: and several kadkhudds made themselves practically independent, including a certain kadkhudd of Baghak, Haji Muhammad ’Ali. Mdlidt was not paid, and the Khans, in bad odour with the people, were finally driven out through the Daria Begi’s champion ship of Zair Khidar, son of the above-named kadkhudd of Baghak. This man originally agreed to act as Kaldntar of the district under the Khans, and got together the ; but finally dispossessed the Khans. Fiom 1905 onwards Zair Khidar and the various kadkhudds remained each supreme in his own village or surroundings, the 'most notable being Hasan Bakshu in Ambarak, Ghulam Husain Haji Khidar in Shuraki, Rais ’Ali in Dilvar. The Khaviz valley and Ahram were farmed by Zair Khidar, who amassed money, but was very lenient. In 1911 Niz rm-us-Sultaneh rejected Zair Khidar’s overtures, having with him in his suite some of the younger Tangistani Khans. Zair Khidar was attacked by a force of the Nizam, beaten back to the hills, and his village Shamshiri destroyed. Sharp fighting ensued, in which some of the kadkhudds like Hasan Bakshu, took the part of the Khans. Baghir Khan, Bahadur-us-Sultaneh was killed, but old Haidar Khan went back to Ahram with the other Khans on Nizam-us-Sultaneh’s behalf. They remained in power as long as Nizam was Governor-General, but in October Zair Khidar attacked them in the fort of Qalat, and, as their supporters melted away, they were forced to fly the district. Muvaqqar-ud-Dauleh, the new Governor, put Zair Khidar in charge of all Tangistan, in 1912. The other kadkhudds are by no means subordinate to Zair Khidar, though Zair Khidar can raise the most men. Rais ’Ali of Dilvar has become rich, and there fore of some importance, through successfill smuggling. In October 1911 the crew of a Tangistan boat committed a piracy near Dibai. The Tangistanis refused to hand over the culprits, or afford repar ation, and the Persian Government failed to compel them to do so. Ac cordingly, in June 1913, a couple of His Majesty’s ships blockaded the fangistan coast, and confiscated the boats belonging to the villages im plicated. In these operations one seaman was killed and five wounded.TAN—TAN 1000 Geography. The present boundaries of the district are :— West, the Mashileh from near the caravan route to its end, then along the sea-coast to Karri. South, from this point to the hills behind (which separate it from inland Dashti) and northwards along the crest of these hills to a gulley flowing out past Kullul, a little to the north : south of Kagh-i-Abui to the mountains north of the Kuh-i-Barami. North, from the Mashileh, south of the caravan road, south of Chaghadak, north of 'Alichangi, then east of Chahkutah, and north-westwards till it meets the Borazjun border: west of Bulfariz and Gandumriz : then turning eastwards north of Gulungun, along a low range of hills till it reaches the Tang-i-Haft Mulla. East, southwards along the range of coast mountains, past the Kuh-i-Dukhtar to the entrance of the Tang-i-Vahush, then along the range east of the Khaviz valley, south of Muhadu and Ashi. A low range of hills separates the villages on the sea-coast from the rest of Tangistan. The great maritime range, where it adjoins Tangistan, is of no great ele vation, the highest point being Kuh-i-Kaleh-i-Dukhtar, 3,938 feet, a few miles to the north-east of the Tangistan capital of Ahram. A spring of extremely hot water is said to issue from the western face of Kuh-i- Dukhtar, and to be adjoined by deposits of sulphur. An important feature of the district proper is the Ahram stream, which has its exit from the hills on the south side of Kuh-i-Dukhtar, and, leaving the town of Ahr&amp;m on its right bank, runs north-west and joins the Chah Kutah stream of the Dashtistan district, a few miles above the point where the latter empties itself into the swamps near Bushire town. A short way below Ahram town this stream has a channel of 100 yards, the right bank being 20 feet high, of a tenacious white clay, while the left bank is lower and more shelving, but the breadth of the actual stream is ordinarily about 30 feet, and its depth I foot only: it is believed, how ever, to be liable to sudden floods after rain in the hills. The surface of the Tangistan district would be flat and open through out, as it is in its northern part, were it not for the accident of a consider able sandstone range, which, running parallel to the sea at the distance of a mile or two inland, divides the southern portion of the district into an inland valley and a littoral tract. These three features, the inland valley, the coastal range, and the maritime strip, are all prolonged south wards into the Dashti district. The inland valley is cultivated under the hills, and a chain of small villages depending on cultivation extends down each side of it. The coastal range has a length of over 50 miles, and belongs as much to the Dashti district as it does to Tangistan ; its most general name appears to be that of Kuh-i-Mund, derived from the Mund river, on which its southern extremity abuts, but it is also called Kuh-i-Kar. The most northern point of Kuh-i-Mund, called Ching Kauntar, is only 467 feet high, but at the middle of its length, behind the coast-line village of BuT-Khair, the range attains a height of 2,682 feet aud is here called Bu Raiyal. It is crossed in one or two places by passes leading from the coast to the Tangistan and Khur-muj valley. 3 z 21001 TAN—TAN Where the district is flat the surface is generally an alluvial clay, often covered with good natural grazing and sometimes cultivated with cereals. Travelling is rendered difficult by mud in wet weather. The water of the Ahram stream is almost undrinkable, and the district water- supply depends everywhere upon wells. The climate and seasons of Tangistan resemble those of Dashti. The Tangistan coast possesses no remarkable features : off: the coast the tidal stream is so weak as to be often imperceptible. Population. The population of Tangistan may be roughly estimated at 10,000 souls. The people belong to various tribes of which little is known. Among these are the Darhiru, Darshamal, Jamali, Khazaru, Kutu, and Zandabud, but they are generally mentioned in the aggregate as Tangistanis. The in habitants of Samal and Abad are said to be immigrants of ancient times called Zanganeh, from the interior of Persia, and those of Tal Slab are said to be Aghayan from ^Iraq-i-^Ajam. In religion they are Shfahs and they speak the Persian tongue. Notwithstanding their proximity to Bushire town, they live in a rude and uncivilized state; blood feuds flourish among them and their name continues to be, in Bushire town, a synonym for law lessness, brutality, and ignorance. The houses in the villages are mostly huts of date-leaves plastered with mud, but some are built of stone. The former Khan (Haidar Khan) who was driven out by Zair Khidar in 1911 was of Arab origin, belonging to a tribe called Fulad. The follow ing is a genealogical table of his family. AHMAD SHAH KHAN. (Ages shown in 1912).TAN—TAN 1002 Resoukces. The district is entirely agricultural and is reckoned highly fertile. The ■chief crops are wheat, barley, and dates, to which may be added water-melons and cucumbers. There is no internal or external trade, unless we reckon a small uncertain export of dates and of other fruits from the hills, such as pomegiunates, grapes, lemons, oranges, and citrons, and a more regular export of locally manufactured gach. No calculation has been made of the transport of the Tangistan district nor any estimate of the livestock. The water-supply is from wells. Militaiiy. The number of tufangchls in Tangistan is altogether perhaps 1,000, but there are so many blood feuds and enmities that it is improbable that more than 300 could be collected together. At the time of Saiyid Murtaza’s introduction of the Tangistanis into Bushire in 1909, 1,000 men were said to have collected, but the number was really much less, and then they were attracted by the prospect of loot. Zair Khidar has a residence at Sham- shiri, and a fort at Qalat near Ahram. There is a large amount of ai ms smuggling carried on by the local head men along the Tangistani coast and occasionally Tangistani dhows indulge in piracies. During the last 3 months of 1912 over 1,000 rifles were landed on the Tangistan coast. Administration. Tangistan belongs properly to the Government of Fars, but it is now nominally under the Governor of the Gulf Ports, and he, in his turn, has apparently sub-let it to the local Khan who is the de facto ruler. The annual payment due from the Khan is said to be 8,500 tumdns a year. For 40 years at least the ordinary residence of the ruling family has been at Ahram, but it was originally at a village called Tangistan, whence the name of the district. Tangistan village is said to have lain about 5 miles south of ; Ali Changi and the remains of it were swept away by a llood in 1905. The town of Ahram is described as a comparatively recent acqui sition of the Khan's family, so also Khaviz on the Ahram river within the mountains, also Abad and Samal in the district of Dashtistan; these were all formerly in the hands of the Mashalkh-ul-Mazkur, whose power fell into decay some years ago. Ahram, the Khaviz Valley, and Samal are properties of Nizam-us-Sultaneh (beingfarmed for about 6,400 tumdns in 1911) ; but the grant was made by the Government in Tehran, irrespective of the rights of ownership possessed by the Khans of Tangistan themselves in the date-gardens of Ahram. In Tangistan there is no pretence of government, and even the rudimentary civil justice, which in other districts is dispensed by the religious authorities, does not exist—a deficiency which is attributed to the backward condition of the people and their intractable character. The Khan, however, by leasing the villages of the district to their headmen, manages to realize a considerable revenue. The incidence of the land tax is nominally 20 to 60 krdns per harvest on the gdu of cultivation j on each date-tree an annual1003 TAN—TAN. impost of 33 cents is levied; and a poll-tax also is payable by each male adult at the rate of 20 to 40 krdns. The currency consists of ordinary Persian krdns, and the unit of weight throughout the district is Hashim man which is equal to 17 or 18 Tabriz mam of Bush ire, and is consequently somewhat heavier than the Hashim man of Bushire town. Communications. The only routes traversing the district are one from Bishire via Ahram to Jahrum and Fasa, and the coast-route from Bushire to Bandar 'Abbns; neither is of much importance, and the latter is of course unable to com pete with sea-carriage. The journey from Ahram to Borazjun presents no difficulties.— {Ross—Foreign Department Gazetteer, 190o — Chick, 1912.) TANGIST4N (Village)— L at. 28° 53' N. ; Long. 51° 5' E.; Elev.

Lieutensflnt-Colonel Bell writes— Entering the flakab pass on the north, pass over the slippery stone revetment, 3 to 4 feet wide, and equally slippery naked rock most dangerous to horses and mules; the pass is 200 feet wide, with perpen dicular cliffs, 300 to 400 feet high, on either hand; it narrows in places to 50 feet; the river flows with a swift current down the pass; it is unford- able and, should the revetment or rock ledge which carries the road he cut away, the passage of the tang would be impassable. In places the revet ment is 6 feet wide, with an outer parapet 2 feet high; it is generally carried at a height of from 50 to 100 feet above the river. At its southern mouth is a dripping fountain, and an inscription relating the history of the construction of this most useful work. A path leads up the hillside to the village of Pushkar, perched upon an elevated ledge amidst a few palm-trees ; the road leads down the valley, and is difficult and stony, and in parts steep; in many places huge boulders narrow it to a mere track.

A pass in Ears, about 80 miles from Bushire on the Bushire-Shiraz road. The pass begins 34 miles from Kamarij, rises to 4^ miles, and ends at 6^ miles, or 3^ miles from Rahdar. The ascent, though not steep, is among rugged boulders, and over rough stones, and constitutes one of the worst bits on this road. The descent, who is made down the bed of a torrent, is even worse. Pack animals can only move in single file, and, owing to the rocks, it would require much blasting to improve the pathway sufficiently for use by camels. It could also be made practicable for field artillery. The road is oommanded throughout by rocky and precipitous hills rising about 600 feet on the west, and slightly less on the east, but these are acces sible from the south, and would not be difficult to clear and hold. There is reported to be a path across the Kuh-i-Mahas direct to Kazarun, which is said to be fit for horses, though steep in places; but there is no definite information about this path.

Elev. about 3,800k A pass in the north-east corner of Laristan, near the borders of Ears and Kirman, through which runs the main caravan track from Bandar J Abbas to Yazd, about 86 miles from the former place. It is a much frequented pass, and thus described by Galindo, who traversed it in November 1888, entering it from the north or Sa^adatabad side : “At 91 miles (from Sa'adatabad) the track descends into the bed of the stream, which is here very narrow and difficult, among slippery boulders and masses of rock. This is the commencement of the Tang-i-Zagh, f TheRaven's Defile'. It is of course utterly impassable for anything on wheels, is difficult and bad even for pack animals, and serious operations would have to be undertaken to make even a decent path of it. “ Having passed this narrow portion, the track continues in the river-bed' but encounters no other serious obstacles for some distance. The stream is generally enclosed between perpendicular walls of conglomerate rock, some 200 to 300 feet high. The general appearance of the scene reminded me somewhat of some of the narrowest portions of the Bolan pass. “ At 11 miles a narrow rift opens in the bank to right, down which comes a branch water-course, and the track turns up this. The left branch looks tempting, as a bit of open ground is visible beyond, but it leads into utterly impassable difficulties, as I found on exploring it, and had to retrace my steps. We then pursued our way up the right hand branch, which is ex tremely narrow for some distance, and about 3 furlongs from its mouth is completely blocked by rocks and boulders, to avoid which the path turns up on the left bank, by a very difficult track over rocks. As we advanced the cliffs became higher and more striking in appearance, in some cases towering up to a height of 500 or 600 feet above the torrent-bed, rising in suc cessive perpendicular steps of whitish coloured rock. There was not much water in the stream, though sufficient to keep out animals constantly fet lock deep in it, but when it is swollen by heavy rain, I should think this road must be entirely closed, as there is no alternative track by which the tiaveller can avoid keeping in the actual channel; and the current must at times be very powerful, as the rocky walls are in many places scooped and hollowed out into large caves by the action of the water. At about 14 miles the actual ‘ tang' may be said to be passed. The ravine opens out to a width of 70 or 80 yards, and the b^tks become low and insignificant; in fact this is nearly the head of the water-course, and we are approaching the watershed. Just beyond here the track leaves the main channel, and turns to the right up a branch ravine, dry and stony.' Galindo noticed that in the great traffic which is carried on by this route donkeys were almost exclusively employed.—( Galindo, November 1888) TANG-I-ZANGU— Lat. Long. Elev. 3,079'. A pass in Laristan over the Kuh-i-IIava range, between Burna and Zangu-Mamelay, on the road between Lar and Bushire. Entering the pass fiom the south side the road for the first 3 furlongs is fairly good, but for the remainder it is a mere track, at times scarcely” traceable. Half a mile fiom the entrance a small rivulet of good fresh water, flowing west, is ciossed, and 1 mile further on a second and similar stream. At this point the ascent becomes steep and rocky, and though not difficult, continues stony and rough to the summit. The descent down the northern slope is generally steeper, more rugged and difficult, the last third of it especi ally being very rough and almost unrideable.— 1888) T ANG-I-ZAN JI RAN —Lat. Long.

A ruined town in Laristan, formerly the head quarters of a district of the some name, 62 miles south-east of Gakum, and 132 miles north-west of Sa'adatabad. It consists of a rectangular fort, some 500 or 600 yards square, the faces turned to the four cardinal points of the compass, and is surrounded by a wide, deep, dry ditch. The latter is crossed at the entrance, which is in the east face, by a solid causeway. Within are some rather fine buildings, but at the time of Galindo^s visit in 1888 they were completely deserted and were falling to ruin, as likewise were the walls of the fort. Galindo gathered from an old man of Sa^adatabad the following brief history of its decline:—Forty years previously {.ie. r prior to 1888) it was a flourishing town, one Nasir Khan being then Governor. On his death he was succeeded by his son, Ali Khan, who commenced the old tale of oppression and extortion, with the result that many left the town during his Governorship. He was surpassed, however, in tyranny and rapacity by his son and successor, Nazir Ullah Khan, and the place became entirely depopulated and has since remained so, while Nazir Ullah Khan himself having omitted to remit part of his plunder to the Shah, ended his days in prison at Tehran. To the south and east of Tarum is a vast salt marsh, but not of the usual barren description, being covered, on the contrary, in most parts with grass and small salsolaceous plants, and intersected by a stream, fringed with date-groves, which flows from north to south in a wide shallow channel.— {Galindo, November 1888.)

Tashan is the site of extensive remains of what, probably in the time of the Atabegs, was a large town. It extends for about 2 miles along the skirts of the range, in the vicinity of Tang-i Band, with an average breadth of about 1^ miles. Few of the houses have any roofs on, such as have are inhabited by the Sa'adat-i-Tashan. They are mostly square in ground plan, with domed roofs and pointed arches, built of undressed stones mortared together with a substance closely resembling gach (gypsum). No inscriptions are to be found either in the remains of the town itself or in the vicinity nearer than the Tang-i-Band and the Tang-i-Sarvak (Tang -i-Saulak of de Bode). The Tashan lands belong to Haji Khusrfi Khan, Sardar-uz-Zafar, and Yusuf Khan, Amir-i-Mujahid, by whom they were let to^AliNaki Khan for an annual rental of 3,000 twhdns. These lands are well watered and inhabited by some 200 families, some of whom are Bahmai. The rest go by the name of Sa’adat-i Tashan. The district is capable of supplying 150 fighting men, of whom, however, only §rds would be aimed with rifles, and even those with weapons of rather antiquated pattern. Resources. —The Tashan lands contain bitumen springs. Two dungs (£rd of total area) of this oil-bearing land belongs to Ali Naki Khan, while the rest viz. 4 dungs belongs to Haji Khusru Khan, Sardar-uz-Zafar, who leased, his share of the property to '’Ali Naki Khan for an annual rental of 500 lumans. Large quantities of bitumen are dug up 'annually and sold in Behbehan, fetching 30 to 40 Icrans per maund.

Zaidan is hounded to the south by another range of sandstone hills, the west faces of which are exceedingly steep ; to the east, however, they are very little above the level of the plain of Zaidan. Zaidan is bounded to the north by another range equally precipitous; to the west, however, they unite almost insensibly with the plain of Behbehan. These are the Zaidan hills. Their sides are furrowed by a thousand torrents, and the roads across them are on the west side very difficult. ZAIDAN (Plain) sometimes “ ZAITUN ”— The ownership of the Zaidan land is divided between the Sardar Arfa', Shaikh of Muhammerah, and Haji Khusru Khan, Sardar-uz-Zafar, and Yusuf Khan, Amir-i-Mujahid, the former owning 2 dungs (| of the total property) while the two latter own the rest in equal proportions, the whole of which (| of the total property) was mortgaged 3 years ago to the Sardar Arfa ; for a sum of 25,000 tirndns.

ZlRA (District) — A small district of Pars, subject to the Governor of the Gulf Ports and situated between the Rud-i-Shirin and DalakI streams immediately above their junction where the Rud Hilleh river is formed; the district extends also a little to the west of the Rud-i-Shlrin. Zlra is^ enclosed between the Shabankareh district on the west, the Mazara^i district on the north, and the Dashtistan district on the east and south. The district lies close under the hills, and the heat in summer is great. Dates and some cotton are grown, but the principal crops, as in the neighbouring districts, are wheat and barley. The inhabitants are a medley of Persian-speaking tribes, all of whom are ShPahs; their number is estimated at 4,000 souls. The men are well-armed with rifles and knives, and revolvers are worn. Agri cultural produce is the only export, and imports are the same as in the other small districts near Bushire. The Hashim man of Zira is equal to 20 Hashim mans of Bushire. The transport available in the district amounts to about 50 horses and 1,500 mules. The district is managed by the Khan of Shabankareh, who has a representative at Daurudgah ,* but the revenue of part of it is farmed by the Salar-i-MiPazzam. Arable land is assessed at 100 krdns gdu of cultivation, and the tax on dates is half its produce value in cash. Administrative arrangements are the same as in Shabankareh.

It is ascended from the north from the vil lage of Shalamzar, the southern descent being to the village of Naghan, the gradients from both approaches being steep and the track rough. When impassable, the alternative route is by the Tang-i-Darkash Warkash.— {Ar but knot, 1905.) The rise from Shalamzar on the north side of the pass is just over 2,000' and is a gradual zigzag; at this time—April—of the year in a bad state. The hills on both sides, however, permit of any desired gradient being laid out with little difficulty. Nor would there be any difficulty for the align ment of a good cart-road should this pass be required for the alignment. This lutal separates the Chehar Mahal from the Bakhtiari country proper, that is, that part of Persia wherein the Bakhtiari have their permanently appointed summer pastures and their few permanent villages.
