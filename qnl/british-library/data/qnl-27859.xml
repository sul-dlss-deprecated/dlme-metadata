Sir, I have the honour to forward copy of a letter dated 13th January 1936 from the Manager, Kuwait Oil Company to my address, on the subject of buoying the channel to the Kadhama anchorage at the western end of the Bay of Kuwait. 2. Mr. Scotty letter speaks for itself, and it would appear from paragraph 3 of his letter that he has already explained his exact requirements in person to Commander Garston of your Directorate. 3. The Kuwait Government have no objection to the work being done by the Persian Gulf Lights and Buoys Ship Nearchus which I understand is under your direct control* 4. As requested in paragraph 4 of Mr. Scott f a letter under reference, I should be grateful if you could let me know at a very early date (a) Whether your Directorate would be willing to hire the necessary buoys to the Kuwait Oil Company; (b) Whether your Directorate would be willing to place the said buoys in position for the Oil Company. (c) Whether you could let me have an estimate of the cost of the work for the information of the Oil Company’s representative. (d) /(d) What is the earliest date when the work could be carried out, on the assumption that you could under take it. 5# From paragraph 6 of the Kuwait Oil Company’s letter it will be seen that only the cheapest form of temporary demarca tion is for the present required, as it is impossible to fores to what extent the Has Kadharaa anchorage will be required after the completion of the shipments mentioned* I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant sd* H.R.P.

Temporary buoying of the channel to the Kadhama anchorage in Kuwait Bay. Sir, We have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No,C-2 of the 2nd January 1936, dealing with the above quoted matt er. During the next three months we shall be receiving from ocean going steamers about 1600 tons of oil well drilling material which we wish to land at Has Kadhama. It will be advantageous to us if these steamers proceed into the inner portion of Kuwait Bay and anchor in the deep water within 4 miles of Has Kadhama, but the masters of the ships will not do this unless the channel and anchorage are demarcated by buoys. We therefore wish to obtain an estimate for the suitable temporary buoying of this channel and anchorage. We have now had an interview with Commander Gars ton. Port Officer of the Basrah Port Directorate and we have explained the position to him. We understand that Kuwait Bay does not come under the direct jurisdiction of the Basra Port Authorities and that it is therefore necessary for the local authorities here to approach the Port Directorate at Basra on our behalf. We take it that there would be no objection to such work being done and therefore request you to approach the Basra Port Directorate on our behalf firstly as to their willingness to hire the necessary buoys and place them forue and secondly for an estimate of the cost of the work and when it could be carried out. We understand that one of their vessels visits Kuwait periodically in connection with the maintenance of the buoys and lights at the Kuwait anchorage and that the work could be undertaken on one of these trips. #e would emphasise that for the present we only require the cheapest form of temporary demarcation as it is impossible for us to foresee at present to what extent we shall require to use the Ras Kadhama landing point after the completion of the shipments mentioned. As we are expecting our first eonsignment of material on or about the 25th instant we should be grateful if you would take up this matter for us immediately. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servants, sd. L.D.Scott, for Kuwait Oil Company,Ltd.Kuwait i Oil Company,Ltd. r/.

The 2nd January 1936* To The General Fields Superintendent, Kuwait Oil Company, Ltd., Kuwait. Kuwait Harbour. Sir, Reference your letter of 1st January 1936, regarding buoying approaches to the inner anchorage of Ras KadhanEt. 2. As the placing of the 2 beacons and buoy mentioned is purely a Kuwait Oil Co. concern, seeing that no one willuse the inner anchorage but yourselves, I see no objection to your getting to work and doing the job direct. This would avoid delay if you are in a hurry. You should however let me know by letter (in triplicate) exactly what you propose doing, so that I can pass your letter on to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, and Port Director, Basra, for information. The latter is responsible for the lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf. 3. On the other hand it would safeguard yourselves with shipping companies and with Captains of freight steamers, requiring to enter the Ras Kadhama anchorage on your behalf, if you addressed the Port Director, Basra, direct, and asked if it woild be possible for the lights and buoys ship 'Nearchus M to fix the said two beacons and buoy you required, and in the position you wanted, at the Kuwait Oil Company’s expense • 4. The second course to my mind is the correct and best one to follow, a s the Nearchus has all necessary gear at hand, and is always attending to such work. I have the honour to be.
