Bucroh,March 10th 1909. 2°LA 7 -* Sir &gt; 1 • A Telegrams were received here on the 3rd instant frsin Canstantinople stating that the Vali of Basrah had i r been superge^ded and Seyyed Arif Bey appointed in his steai- , ^ The disturbances reported in my telegrams of February 13th ,25th,26th and March 2nd ceased on receipt of this news. The connection is interesting and instructive and ,in view of the Grand Vizier's replies to your Excel lency of February 24th and March 1st which seem to mo dis ingenuous and are certainly misleading ,1 think it as well to place on record the probable cause of these sporadic outbreaks ,which occur here at stated intervals, whenever the Vali of Baerah is unfortunate or tactless enough to annoy his influential neighbours and incur their resentment. However much the Arabs in these districts fight between themselves there is always sufficient solidarity among them to join in harrassing their common enemy the Turks if necessity arises and the opportunity is favourable. We have too many instances of this to admit of denial,but it may be sufficient to note that some years ago,before . | f% • Mubarak murdered his brothers and seized Koweit,and Khazal of Muhammarah did the same,it watf a well established Cus tom for the Sheikha of Koweit and Muharamarah and the Rakib of Basrah to combine in organising armed attacks on the in habitants of the Shat-ul-Arab and the neighbourhood,or in undertaking piratical interprises at the bar or in the river.Eyewitnesses still relate that it was no uncoivimon sight to see a* many as thirty boat loads of armed men To leaving His Excellency the Right Honourable Sir Gerard Lowther,G.C.M.G, K.C.B. His Majesty's Ambassador,V' •i leaving Muhainr.iarah. after the t ii/ie of evening prayer to ^ carry out the hostile designs of this powerful triunviratf, who employed their own servants and retainers for the pur pose and shared the spoil among thorn, I think wo should he incorrect in presuming that this custom has entirely died out. For the past six years while I have 'been hero crime has 'been very frequent in Basrah,while disturbances , s imi- lar to those which occur in the districts administered by Turkey,are unknown in Muhammarah and Koweit.lt is not ne cessary to recapitulate events,those of unoual gravity have been reported as they occurred to His Majesty*s Embassy and are on record already. I have always understood that the present Sheikh of Koweit is no longer a party to the system. He indulges in Arab forays and razzias instead and 1 tc has perhaps a wider felld of activity,and his position, moreover,has no doubt been modified by recent circumstances But,as regards the Sheikh of Muhammarah and the Nakib of Basrah,who are still surrounded by followers of the most ruffianly description, I believe this not to be the case. It is at least noticeable that, on each occasion,when dis turbances break out in the neighbourhood of Basrah they have been invariably preceded by some quarrel or disagree ment between the Vali of Basrah and his powerful neighbours on points closely affecting the interest of the latter.And when arguments have failed the Turkish districts are har ried by armed gangs,who plunder,murder and commit all man ner of excesses with impunity until the object of the in jured party is achieved and the unpopular Governor discre dited and removed. The attitude adopted by the ex-Vali in regard to the registration of land transfers has affected the Sheikhs of Muhammarah and Koweit very closely. The former owns a great deal of land and house property in Basrah and draws considerable revenues therefrom. The Vali,I am informed raised the same objection to his acquiring new property,as he did in the registration of Fedaghia and the land pur chased, (!&gt; purchased from Sheikh SaduB of Muntafik in the name of the Sheikh of Koweit. It is a well established fact that some, if not all of the l&gt;and who committed the outrage reported in my telegram NO: 10 of 13th February last came from and returned to Muhammarah* \ \ WXX/V'&amp;L The same A occurred in 1906,in the Maaghil case* Several of the culprits were traced to Muhammarah and when pressure wa** ultimately brought to bear on the Sheikh to hand them over,we had reason to doubt whether the persons delivered were those concerned in the murder of Mr Glanvil&amp;e* There were others,pf course caught on Turkish territory, but,as regards those known to be at Muhammarah,the Sheikhbd attitude was evasive and unsatisfactory. It is to be hoped that the new Vali will prove himself to be a stronger man than his predecessor. We had remarkable proof of what a strong Governor could do when Fahkri Pasha was sent here in 1904,after disturbances had- reached a climax in the time of Mustapha Nouri Pasna,Vali of Basrah. If extended powers are given to the new Vali much can no doubt be done to mitigate the evil. But,as long as action is confined to mere perfunctory police en- quirAes,and reference is made to a socallod Criminal Cojrt where no justice is obtainable,while local authorities are allowed to throw dust in our eyes by arresting innocent persons and sentencing them to expiate the oilencos ol ✓ guilty defaulters,the lawless condition of Basrahjwill not improve.

On the sane day three Turkish steamers with about 600 soldiers and field guns proceeaed to Mejir neoir, where Areybi and hie friendly Arabs crossed the river to assist them. A desul- -tory fire, directed against the Alou Mohammed under Audul Kerim eo Swyhood who were some distance off, was kept up foi four days. On May 1 Abdul Kerim attacked Areyui and the friendly Arabs and a hand to hand encounter ensued, in which it is said Areyoi lost 300 men.

It was decided that a punitive expedition should be got up immediate^ against the desert offenders. The names of the particular offenders against whom the., were to fight, have been kept a secret, but the rumour sa„s that the w are either Sheikh Sa’adun of Muntafich, in revenge for the recent raid com- -mitted b^ his Bedouins on the Rashaida and the Uuatha, vide entry under date 8th in this office Diary Ho.6 for week ending 9th February 1910, or the Ajman who have of late given much trouble to the Koweit Araibdars. At the council it was also decided that evei-y one should contribute, according to his means, towards the expense of the expedition. Persian and Hejdi merchants, carpenters and all Pett u shop-keepers being included. 2000 men from Koweit town were to be got read^ . To this number the Araibdars are to add 2000 men and the dfatair, it is said, from 3 to 4000 men. The Sheikh would provide rifles etc to those not possessing them. It is said the well-to-do merchants have offered from 160 to 200 'khabras' (tents). Bq,ch ,, khabra M consists of 5 cs^ls and 7 men. The Sheikh takes 60 H khabras 11 foi the accommodation of his own men. The expedi— —tionaiy force, it is said, will be accompanied b^, Sheikh Mobarak himself and all the male members of the Aubah family including Sheikh Salim bin Mobarak, xkx except Sheikh Nasir bin Mobarak, the blind boy and Sheikh Hamad. Sheikh Jabir bin Mobarak is already in camp. V4\I- agir barl Becffer, Ibrahim bin Manhaf and Abdulla bin Hajri, uhe Sheikh's factotum, v&lt;ere accordingly on foot^ t»o enlist men in Koweit. x x Theie is a great demand for rifles and camels in consequence of the arrangement for an expedition, 13th February . The news of the expedition was heiaided to—da.y in the bazaar. It warned eveit one that the expedition would leave Koweit on the morning of the 17th February and all should there fore get read, before that da,, x x x 15th February, Four messengers arrived this morn- -ing from Ibn Rashid with a present of a horse for Sheikh Mobarak. Sheikh Mobarak left for Fao in his launch all of a sudden this morning in the midst of his arrangements for the expedition. It is said that H• E• the 1. ali of Basra has come to Fao and the Sheikh has been called there, 16th February. With reference to the expedition, xx it is said, that the Sheikh is ver 0 serious and wants all arrangements to be perfect. It is said that some people entertain fear as the result of this venture ma, not prove fatal to Koweit like that at Sarif in 1899(?). It is reported that Abdul Aziz ibn Saud has arrived at Js Sirrar about 3 hours distance from Anta'a, It is also reported that Muhammad ibn Saud, , ounger brother of Abdul Aziz ibn Saud, is expected in Koweit in a da^ or two with the heads of the Ajman tribe probably to tit s^-d compromise matters with Sheikh Mobarak. News has reached Koweit that Sheikh Sa’adun of Muntafich has refused to ask his Bedouins to return the looted camels to the Koweit Araibdars. It is said Sa, id Khalaf, Nakib of Basra, had volun- -teered to intercede Sheikh Sa’adun but the latter© (J^ OM- refused \jO press his Bedouins, Sheikh Mobarak, in is said, will proceed no Failiyah from Fao no confer with Sheikh Khazal and return, no Koweit on Saturday or Sunda^ nhe 19nh B’ebruar^ . j \ A%tlYtL£-C ; h r VlA~- SG'bh ^ebruarj. Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman bin Saud, uhe Amir of Nejd, and usually described as 'Bin Saud',arrived in Koweiu uhis morning wiuh his ^ounger brother, Abdulla, aged about 16 ^ears old suid Turki, his ovm. son, aged about 13 jears, T’ith them came also Abdul Aziz bin Missa’ad al Jaloi and Abdul Aziz bin Turki relatives of Bin Saud, The party were met b„ Sheikh Mobarak himself at Shamil ah about half an hour’s distsuice from Kovreit and brought in in his own Motor car. The Amir of Nejd and his partj were accompanied b^ a follow ing of ISO men all mounted on fine thaluls. It is said Mahomed bin Abdur Rahman, brother of Abdul Aziz, will arrive at Subaihiyah to-morrow (27th February) with 1200 men with their camels. These will be followed almost immediately by two more parties numbering about 850 camels and 300 horses. After these, it is said, the entix^e Ajman tribe is moving onwards from \ afra to Subaihiya. These are aasampaKisd composed of the following sections of the Ajman:- (1) Al Murra (2) Bani Hajir (3) Jd Dwasir (4) S’bia (5) 'Sful (6) Chahtan (7) Al Arja and (3) Bani Khalid. All this goes to show the great influence Sheikh Maxtork Mobarak has over the Bedouin tribes. The news of Sheikh Mobarak’s projected 'Ghazu' has simply terrified the entire Ajman tribe with the result that they have earnestly sought the Sheikh's fogiveness for all the offences they have committed on his men and have offered to make good all the property looted from the Koweit Araibdars. It is said that Sheikh Mobarak is notwell disposed -cowards Mahomed bin HiUilain and ^ said plainly -uo Man a 1 bin Juma 'thab he considered “che Ajman -cribe had no Sheikh ober bhem since bo-uh (Mahomed bin Hibhlain and Mana* bin J i juna) could not, control their Bedouins/ . He praised Faisal ud Dawish, Sheikh of uhe Jmtair, and said that he considered Faisal a veit powerful Sheikh who could summon all his Bedouins at a moment's notice. x x 28th February • The expedition moved out oi Koweit this morning to Shamiyeh where the war flag was pitched. Towards midda,, the whole force moved to Jahara where Sheikh Mobarak and Bin Saud will join them in a da„ or two. It is again doubt ful as to what enem^ is to be fought. The Political Agent returned from tour and in the evening visited Sheikh Mobarak where Abdul Aziz bin Saud was introduced to him together with some of his relatives. 1st March. Muhamad ibn Saud,„ ounger brother of Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman bin Saud arrived to- da„ in Koweit with a following of 20 men all mount- -ed on borses. It- is reported that Sheikh Mobarak has given Bin Saud a present in cash of ^7000/- 150 bags rice, 150 maunds dates, 30 mds. flour, 20 ghi(clariiied butter) 5 bags coffee, 4 bags sugar, 4 of the best riding thaluls valued at ^400 each, 70 baggage camels, 2 fine horses valued at |600 »ach - one for Turk! bin Abdul Aziz and one for Abdulla brother of Abdul Aziz. Be- —sides the above, the Sheikh has given presents in wearing apparels to the household of Abdul Aziz at ITejd valued at at least $3000. Sheikh Mobarak informed the Political AgentR that his expedition is intended against the Thaffir, but it is more probable that the Thaffir will onl„ be a veit small incident in what is undoubtedly a big campaign. The latest news is that Sheikh Mobarak’s force is to be joined by Bin Saud’s, the whole of the Ajman tribe andcertain sections of nne and 'uhe raid is no be in a Homh west direction. If this is correct it is extremely probable that the campaign is reallj aimed at the Shammar tribe and Bin ‘Rashid. Sheikh Mobarak v;ill not go out himself, his son Jabir leading the Bin Subah contingent. Bin Saud is to leave Koweit on the 3rd or 4th March, and % the majority of the Ajman have already left. l( 1 1 1 i0 JExtracts Agenc^ fo from Diar w No. 10 of the Koweit Poli'Lical r -uhe week ending 9th March 1910.

Sand and Sa’ad, the next two brothers in point of age, are about 25, the former being Abdul Aziz’s full brother, very fair for an Arab and of pleasant address. Abdulla, the youngest, is only about 15 years of age. 6. All struck me as particularly intelligent, and Abdul Aziz as a broad-minded, ai straight ” man, who could probably be trusted further than most Arabs. His reputation amongst Arabs is that of a noble, generous and just man who does not descend to mean actions. The deference paid by him to Shaikh Mubarak was remarkable and though partly due by Arab etiquette to the latter’s age and position as host may also have been induced by the many proofs of his wealth and lavish generosity. 7. Abdul Aziz did not discuss politics with me beyond remarking that he thanked God there were no Turks nearer to his capital than those in El Hasa, and that the English as the friends and brothers of Mubarak-as-Subah were thereby his friends and brothers. He had often heard Colonel Felly’s visit to Riadh spoken of, but had never seen a white man in the place nor in fact ever in his life before the present occasion. He offered me a welcome should I ever contemplate a tour so far afield as Riadh. 8. Previous to Bin Saud's departure the Ajman Shaikhs against whom the pre sent expedition was originally planned by Shaikh Mubarak as retribution for a series of raids on Kuwait camels, made their submission and it is said that through Abdul Aziz’s good offices Shaikh Mubarak has forgiven the Ajman their depre dations, and in their turn they have now placed their fighting men at his disposal for the impending campaign. 9. The Wahabi princes left Kuwait on the 4th March to rejoin their camp which was to have moved on the 7th March from a day south of Kuwait to join forces with Shaikh Mubarak’s Contingent preparatory to a combined campaign. 10. Shaikh Mubarak informed me that his force was intended to punish one of the Thaffir Shaikhs who joined Shaikh Sadunofthe Muntifich in a recent small raid. Another rumour from the bazar has it that the present expedition is be ing made at the suggestion of the Wali of Basra, who recently met the Shaikh at Fao, and, if there is any truth in this, which I doubt, it would appear that the Turkish authorities having realized their inability either to collect revenue from the Munti fich or to punish their contumacy, have resorted to the expedient of setting a Bedouin to catch a Bedouin. Neither of these objects would require more than 2,000 or 3,000 men for its effective conclusion. It is exceedingly difficult to estimate the numbers now gathered at Jahra, but I may mention that Shaikh Mubarak said to me in conversation that he had some 6,000 to 8,000 men collected and Bin Saud as many more. I believe these numbers to be greatly exaggerated though it is a fact that the combined forces contain very strong contingents from the following tribes:—Ajman, Umtair, Awazim, Bani Hajir, Bani Khalid, A1 Morrah, Ateyba, Sbi’a, Kahtan, at-Towata, the whole of the Kuwait Araibdar and the personal follow ers of the Bin Saud and Bin Subah families. The estimates of the various tribal Shaikhs who have lately visited me, though notoriously unreliable, all put the num ber of horsemen at between 2,500 and 3,500, with the thaluls (riding-camels) “ without number as grains of sand.” It is probable that the camelry number quite 8,000 to 9,000 . The demand for equipment has been such that the price of an average thalul has risen by quite 25 per cent., that there is hardly a single article of camel-equipment or clothing to be had in the usually well-stocked bazars, and the prices of arms, ammunition, rice, coffee and other commodities have all advanced. All merchants, boat-owners, shopkeepers, etc., have been laid under heavy contributions in money or goods, and it is said that the desert from A1 Hasa northwards is destitute of fighting men, whilst numbers continue to come in from the more distant grazing grounds further west. 11. Nothing on the scale of the present expedition has been planned since that which ended in the disaster of Sarif in 1901. Gossip is now coming to the con clusion that though the expedition may exact retribution from the Thaffir Shaikhs and Shaikh Sadun for their small raids, it is probably intended against the Shammar and Ibn Rashid. This opinion is surmise founded on the good ground that no force approaching the present in strength has been raised either by Mubarak or Bin * ISaailto r years, and as Abdul Aziz will be virtual Commander-in-Chief in the field, it is unlikely that he will forego the opportunity of trying conclusions with his rival when circumstances have given him so good a chance of success. 12. Shaikh Mubarak is at Jahra and will return in a day or two after the com bined forces leave. He will not accompany them himself, it is said, because Abdul Aziz dissuaded him on account of his age and health and because the Shaikh has a degree of confidence in Abdul Aziz's military and political ability, which he cer tainly does not repose in his son Jabir or the Kuwait leaders Commanding the Bin Subah Contingent. a M« Pr*M, Simla.—No. 0828 F.

The report goes that Sa'adun besides his Muntafich Bedouin had with him 500 horsemen of the Shammar, nearly all the Thaffir sections and the ’Bbadur, Ziad, ’Sinait. As Safa, El Majarid, 20th March.

The force under his command contained nearly 4000 horsemen and large number of dismounted men and no thaluls, whilst the Bin Subah and Bin Saud combined force was largely composed of thalul-riders with onl^ about 1000 horsemen. It is said if Bin Saud had not been present the Bin Sub ah forces would have been completely destroyed. Onl^ a few casualties so far are re ported on the Bin Subah side, none of the bigger Sheikhs having been killed. It is said Sheikh Sa’adun ordered that none of the enemy should be put to death, that only their arms should be taken and the men allowed to go unmolested. The force is returning to Jahara and awaits Sheikh Mobarak*s orders, though it is considered cert- -ain fresh efforts will be made at once and a second attempt launched at Sa’adun as soon as re-inforcements have been collected. The above report was given to the Political Agent b„ a small Ajman Sheikh who was present in the fighting. 21st. March.

You will see that the Government of India direct r J that a warning should be conveyed to the Sheikh in terms of the previous warning, not to enter into any operations calculated to involve him in difficulties in Nejd or with the Turks. The previous warning to which the Government of India refer was conveyed to Sheikh Mobarak personally by Lieutenant Colonel Kemball, C.I.E., the then Resident, in October 1901, when the Sheikh was contemplating an ex pedition in fdjpe against Ibn Rashid. The former warning was disregarded by the Sheikh. t 3. On that occasion Lieutenant Colonel Kemball was instructed to “visit Ko w eit and ascertain the state of aP fairsaffairs regarding tension between the Amir of Nejd and ¥o- barak and counsel the Sheikh to avoid by all means in his power any display of activity which might afford Turkey ex cuse for greater interference in Kcweit affairs• ,, 4. I would suggest that at an interview with Sheikh Mobarak^ you should make an opportunity of referring to the recent expedition and warn the Sheikh against engaging in any expedition which is calculated to bring him into col lision with the Turks. Sheikh hobarak will, no doubt, in sist that the expedition is against the Muntafich and ag reeable to the Turks, but it will be as well to let him understand that a policy of adventure in the interior does not commend itself to Government. Perhaps the Resident whojis due on Friday next may take an opportunity of visit ing the Sheikh, but it seems advisable to deliver the warn ing at once.

In continuation of my letter No. 759, dated 27th March 1910, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the marginally noted despatch regarding recent fighting in the Euphrates valley near the diary of the Political Agent, Kuwait, dealing with the latter’s engagement. 2. It would appear that, to begin with at any rate, Bin Saud and Shaikh Jabir marched against the Muntafikin accordance with their intentions and that they found Sadun Pasha with a much stronger force than they expected, and suffered defeat at his hands. “ Senajir a secuon or me /\oouaa tribe with the followers attacked the town of Shattara at night and pillaged the bazaars. A sharp engagement ensued between the Arabs and the Turkish troops stationed there with the result that the Turks suffered considerably, losing a Major, two officers and 23 soldiers killed and about 30 men wounded. On the Arab side several men were killed and some wounded. Further details about the affairs have not reached Basra, The inha bitants of Shattara are of the Abouda tribe which is divided into two sections of which “ As-Senajir ” oppose the Turks and “ Ash-Shamkhi ” support them. I understand in the recent fighting the “ Ash-Shamkhi ” section helped the Turkish troops against their fellow townsmen. The growing enmity which arose last year between Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait and Sadu Pasha out of some disagreement in commercial matters, has recently culminated in open hostilities. Bin Saud has been visiting Kuwait and accompanied by Shaikh Jabir, Mubarak's eldest son, and a large number of Arabs proceeded a short time ago to a place in the desert, of which I have not yet learnt the name about three days march north-west of Zobair, They were met there by Sadun and his followers and severe fighting is said to have occurred, in which Bin Saud and Jabir suffered considerable loss in camels, horses and defeat and were pursued by a large number of Arabs from the Montafik tribes who sallied across the Euphrates to support Sadun. A further engagement is expected shortly. It is said that Shaikh Mubarak remained at Jahra near Kuwait during the expedition and on hearing the result immediately returned to Kuweit. A telegram from a Turkish officer in Montafik to his father at Basra says the route from Nasriyah to Shattara is very dangerous. I ajji informed that the presence of the Arabs of Bin Saud in the neigh- the township of Shattara, and the fight bet- bined forces of Bin Saud and Shaikh Mubarak.

A copy of the Political Agent’s note on Shaikh Mubarak’s military arrangements is being sent separately to the Chief of the Staff's Division.

' 2. For facility of reference I aUach extracts from my diary which give in sufficient detail the accounts, as they were received, of the reverse inflicted by Shaikh Sadun upon the Bin Subah and Bin Saud forces. 3* a contrast to these accounts the following description of this ** regret- able incident ” as furnished to me by Shaikh Mubarak himself is interesting, if fallacious. The Shaikh said that the attack by the combined forces was in the first place badly planned : in spite of this fact, however, it was successful and broke up Shaikh Sadun’s cavalry who fled leaving a number of dead on the field. Unfortunately the attack took place over the dried-up bed of a large rain-pool, from which a very heavy cloud of dust rose ; owing to the natural confusion of the attack and the subsequent impenetrable dust the combined horsemen who made the first attack lost-their bearings whilst their supporting “ thalul ” riders (camelry) remained in ignorance as to what had resulted from the charge. Sadun, as he galloped put of the melee, apparently at once grasped the situation and with rare geneial-ship seems to have rallied his broken cavalry and led them round under cover of the dust to attack the bewildered camelry. The camelry naturally assum ing an attack upon them could not be possible without their horsemen having been already defeated, broke at once and fled to save their skins and “ thaluls ”. Sadun having disposed of the camelry turned his attention to the horsemen who already confused by their first attack were wondering what had become of their supporting camelry. Receiving no support and being again attacked they also fled leaving Sadun master of the field. Shaikh Mubarak averred that his men lost very few of their camels and even succeeded in securing some of Sadun’s mares in their first attack. He gave the casualties as only 3 men of his own Reshaida and some 120 of Sadun’s men killed. Sadun’s son, Thamir, had his mare killed under him, himself being shot through the thigh, whilst 5 of the smaller Dhaffir Shaikhs were amongst the dead on Sadun’s side. The Shaikh denied that Sadun was supported by any Shammar, as reported in my diary ; he said that Sadun had asked Ibn Sebhan (Ibn Rashid’s guardian and regent) for assist ance but the latter had refused it. 4. The few casualties on the Kuwait side show that the affair, in spite of Shaikh Mubarak’s somewhat ingenious explanation, was undoubtedly a disgrace • No. C.-I4, dated the 30th March 1910. honour to enclose a ^report from the Poli- tlCrll Appnf.

I have a’so heard since that Shaikh Jabir and Bin Sand did not have that singleness of purpose or plan which is essential to any military operation. It is apparently admitted that in point of numbers the combined Bin Saud and Bin Subah force was superior, though Sadun, who had no camelry at all, had a preponderance in horsemen. I am afraid that Shaikh Mubarak’s tale of the losses is fictitious as from other sources I learn that among the killed (reported at anything up to 150) is a small Umtair Shaikh ; that the refugees have been returning to Jahra without clothes riding 5 and 6 to a camel, and promising Bedou’m exhorbitant sums for transport to Kuwait. 5. As soon as news of the defeat reached the Shaikh he began fresh and energetic measures for the raising of another and larger force, and to this end minute details have been collected of the population, each man’s wealth, number of able-bodied men ; etc. The entire stock of arms and ammunition has been commandeered by the Shaikh from the arms-dealers, who are to receive bonds for their value drawn on the Customs receipts. There is much grumbling (though through fear of the Shaikh it is expressed in hushed whispers) at the amount of money contributions demanded, especially from foreigners such as the richer Persian merchants. 6. I have been fortunate in obtaining secretly some interesting details as to the Shaikh’s organization for military purposes with an estimate of the numbers being collected for this second expedition, which 1 submit in a separate note attached hereto, as it may be of use to the Intelligence Branch at Army Head quarters. It will be seen that a force of some 15,000 men (including Kuwait levies, Bedouins and Bin Saud’s contingent) is contemplated. The expedition is unpopular in the town chiefly on the score of the heavy expenses it entails on all and the fear that the Shaikh will resort to it as a pretext for further increasing taxation. However, there is no one who would dare to venture to suggest to the Shaikh that the game is not worth the candle, though it is a fact that the origin of these retributory steps against Shaikh Sadun was his successfu l raid (combined with the Dhaffir) of some 300 Kuwait sheep and a few camels. 7. On receiving your First Assistant’s instructions to convey a warning to the Shaikh I took the first opportunity of riding out to his camp at Sirra and bringing forward the subject. As vas to be anticipated the Shaikh assured me that the Turkish authorities were well pleased at his action against Sadun and that the Wali during his last visit to Fao had commended him and wished him success. Sadun was for some time a refugee from the Turkish authorities, but I hear that the Turks found him a still greater nuisance as an outlaw and so re instated him in some honorary post, though whether this is a fact 1 have no cer tain information. The Shaikh w'ent on to explain that he intended nothing which could possibly involve him in conflict with them or with others, but that his honour as an Arab Shaikh was concerned, for his people had been robbed and Sadun had made no restitution of the property as Shaikh Mubarak is generally successful in securing after such raids. His sole object was to punish Sadun and according to Arab ideas a counter-raid is certainly justified in default of re stitution. I recalled Colonel Kemball’s warning to the Shaikh and explained that one could never tell to what result expeditions of this nature would lead even tually and for that reason such adventures did not commend themselves to Gov ernment. The Shaikh replied that he always bore Colonel Kemball’s w’armng in mind but that in the present case he was practically forced to assert his authority to secure his people from molestation. 8. My previous impression (stated in my letter No. C-12 dated the 9th March 1910) that the expedition might possibly be used for an excursion against Ibn Rashid has proved incorrect; and therefore 1 was not able to suggest defi nitely the abandonment of the proposed second attempt, such a suggestion being an unwarrantable incursion into the Shaikh s own internal politics. 1 endeavoured to show him hosv utterly incommensurate the best possible success would be with the cost of fitting cut his force and alter reiterating Government’s disapprovalcame away with the impression that the Shaikh has no intention of changing his n ^ j —Sin T ce , the above lv ' as dra fted I have heard that the entire force will be collected near Jahra within the next three or four days and that the Kuwait leaders are to receive their final instructions from Shaikh Mubarak on Friday (the i st April). ^ Extracts from Kuwait Political Diary. 20th March. Report reached Kuwait to-day of the defeat of the Bin Subah and Bin baud fighting forces by Shaikh Sadun of the Muntafik on the 16th March between Ar Rakhaimiya, Waguba and Zaraibiat. It appears that on that date the combined force early m the morning attacked first and defeated the Muntahk who retnred without any great loss. Shortly afterwards, Shaikh Sadun delivered a vigorous counter-attack from a flank against the right wing composed of Kuwait Araibadar and Umtair Bedouins and apparently the Kuwait men made no attempt at a stand, Shaikh Jabir and his followers fleeing almost at once, leaving the Bin Subah war-flag and half their “ thaluls ” in the hands of the enemy. Meanwhile Bin Saud and his brothers supported by the Ajman on the left wing were engaged with others of Shaikh Sadun’s force and appear to have made gallant efforts to save the day. In retreating, which they seem to have carried out methodically, they made three stands, but owing to the flight of the Kuwait men were powe less to turn a defeat into victory. In the first suc cessful attack, the Ajman secured about 50 horses from the Dhaffir who directly opposed them. , * s sa 'd to have been due partly to the surprise and vigour of Sadun s counter-attack, and mainly to Sadun’s force being far larger than was anticipated especially in horsemen The report goes that Sadun^ besides his Muntafik Bedouin had with him 500 horsemen of the Shammar, nearly all l h , e D , h f a ?, r sect,ons and the ’Lbadur, Ziad, ’Smait, As Safa, El Maiarids Mam Malik, Ash Shraifat, Bani Husseini, Ar Rafaiat, A 1 hathool, A 1 Khaza’ale Bam Hawaikim, Bam Lami, Bani Khagan, Bani ’Said and others. The force under his command contained nearly 4,000 horsemen and Iar^ e number of dismounted men and no thaluls. while the Bin Subah and Bin Saud combined force was largely composed of thalul-riders with only about 1 000 horsemen. * It is said if Bin Saud had not been present the Bin Subah forces would have been completely destroyed.

The force is returning to Jahra and awaits Shaikh Mubarak’s orders, though it is considered certain fresh efforts will be made at once and a second attempt launched at Sadun as soon as re-inforcements have been collected. The above report was given to the Political Agent by a small Ajman Shaikh who was present in the fighting. 21st March .—Shaikh Mubarak has proclaimed in the bazaar that no firearms should be sold to any foreigners. He has collected, it is said, a large number of rifles from all the firearms dealers last night. He has also ordered lists to be made of all the townsmen from which to choose men for his second expedition against the Muntafik Shaikh. It is rumoured the Shaikh has bought 1,000 camels from a Syrian. He is undoubtedly 4 making arrangements on a much bigger scale than before and, it is said, has asked help from Shaikh Khazal ; whilst Bin Saud has summoned his Nejada to join in the new raid.

Ar 3umeih is about 6 hours North of Zubair and is said to have a good water-supply.

Sir, I nave the hmour to invite a reference to iTi^ niar,, for the we at ending 6th Jul^ 1910 relating to a raid, Koweit Arabs on Zobeir , wrich I under stand. &gt; i as attracted the attention of the 'Parkish of: icials nr Basra. 2 . I called Sneikh Mubarak's attention to the incident telling him thst I tad heard the Turkish auth— —orities were inclined to Y/ regard i v j seriously and would be certain to resent suen. lawlessness close to ^ Basra and that if the raiders wore really his men it # would be well to punish the offenders so as to prevent further complications in his own affairs in the Basrah Vilayet. The Sheikh inforraed me that the tali fad al- -read, written to him on the subject demanding restitu- -tion of the raided animals and calling upon him to \aklL over the offenders. Ho had ^pli.ed that the raid was^ not committed by his men, but tnat from enpui riey/ic had f ound that a part;, of some 30 Arabs , Roshalna and Umtair , who were on their wa^ to rain the Tha^fir, \'&amp;,cL halted for water at the Bargasija wells , just outside Zobeir, that the;* had been fired upon by men near, bcing Bedouin the^ naturally retaliated b^ seizing rme donkeys, and that nobody had been killed . To do nis best for the Wall he had made the offenders give up the74 Cne donkey raided and thej had h-jen nent into Zo-— -boir. The Sheikh explained hhat thjii^h he had // influence with the Bedouin, ho wan // n^r, the SheL/cU. of all the tribes rr.mc Basra an.d Kov/eit. S. The Sheikh added tnat he had also writ- -hen to the tali giving it an bis impression than the incident had born engineered b„ Sa^ id Talib , the son of the Nakib, and one of the Basra repres entatives in the Turkish Parliament for the express purp )se j4 getting Mubarak into trouble an.d so extorting from him the mono} for his ex- -travaganc js which he was finable to extract from his own father. It appears , according to the #/ Sheikh , that Sa*id Talib who is always short of funds , has been persistent in presBvn^ on Mubarak offers no use nis influence in Basra and Constantinople in his- favour with a view to acquiring a position which will enable him to use the Sheikh qs his banker, and the Sheikh know- -ing Sa^ id Talib's proclivities is unwilling to jL allow himself to be dragged into an^ such alliance —hence the present incident, 4. other information leaver yer w little doubt that the raid was carried out Resbaida and Tuata , who ma*, be described as Koweit Arabs, tho’igh probably without the Sheikh* s knowlevigeand I think it is unlikely that thee set out $elibera -atelc to attack Zobeir or that the^ actually did so without some provocation, 5. The Sheikh thoroughly understands that irritating the Turkish authorities is far more X# likely to damage bis own interests them benefit them and we know that for nearly a year now his attitude towards the present Tali has been if ane -thing more friend: than. i&lt;r altogether desirable I .have the honour to be.

A.C., Af-ter offering you my best respect I beg to state that I had the honour to receive your communication dated 2nd Moh- arrum 1339 ho 37 In which you suggested all what was good and advisable. I thank you for your good wishes and wise sugges tions. You had stated that a reply has been received from Saadoon that he has not moved from his place and has not madb the least preparation. It is incumbent on him to tell you the truth. As to What h© has stated to you that he Is in his place Mayaah and in the palace In the bush at Abughar; (I would stkte that) he Is not in his place but that he has told a lie. I gret that he who belongs to a noble family tells a lie, but I say that it is his characteristic which he developed. May (iod guide him to improve himself. It is necesscary for him to a- vaid himself of this happy time and of the honest Government officials who endeavour in the interests of the Ration and tne Government. May God help us in giving full satisfaction to the officials of our Government. I, your sincere friend, will, God willing, follow a line % truthful of conduct which may be most peaceful,/maintain justice and will rot,inshallah.deal with the people except according to ^ whether truth, justice and coufctesy. The family^of/Saadoon himself or all the sons of Hashed are dear to me up to now and will remain so afterwards, tnshallah, because we were or the most cordial terms with them since ancient times, from the days of Hashed till that of his sons Mansoor Pasha and Naser Pasha M. arc o.ii©ir oons who are now alive. And Saadoon does not deny thisthis and vrill also not deny my kindness to himself particular ly. This his dealing with us does not hurt us but will hurt his name and Honour, The causes which created this ill-feel ing will be represented to Your .‘ionour according to justice and with proofs. In the first instance Osman-el-Rashed,ix a mercliant of TToweit sent his employees to the tribesmen with $ rice, clothes and coffee to be sold to the tribesmen who are on the side of Nejd-from Snammur to Umtheir; and Osman’s em ployees sold their goods and purchased camels and sheep and £ proceeded to our side. All the tribesmen, both Zhofeir and ste others were our friends; and Saadoon was like a son of mine in my estimation and was particularly good with me while he was not good to all the forld. Ibn-1-Hallaf, the Sneikh of the Saeed tribesmen seized from the employees of the said Osman Rashed the camels send sheep which they had bought together with the furnitures of their houses as well as the sheep belonrriner to the people of Jahrah They informed that these belonged to the people of Toweit and explained this fact to him. He asked them to bring him a letter from me as was the ordinary procedure with him and the otner headmen of the or ibesmen; when ever there is any plunder ed property belonging to my subjects with them I write to tnem and they return the same. Ibn lallaf md nis tribesmen, the Saeed, all took refuge with Saadoon because the Sheikh of the Zofheir, lamood-es-Soweitii had banished them and gave Saa doon a share of the camels and sheep belonging to the psople of ^oweit. I wrote to Ibn lallaf to return them; but both he and Saadoon were Inspired with covetousness. At uhe s’me time Syed ^Oialaf Kaqibzadah happened to be with Saadoon on a visit because he is a great friend of his; -and Saadoon starter to ^ the proceed on a Journey with/Saeed s^and a party of the Mumtaf ik herdsmen and halted near my tribesmen. My son Jaber happened to be with the tribesmen on an excursion to pass the spring and Saadoon warned the tribesmen who were with him saying that they have reached near toe Yb we it tribesmen and as they were thieves and would rob the furniture of the houses, he wianed to prevent them from doing so.

No. C.—1, dated Kuwait, the 18th January 1911 (Confidential). From— Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 1 have the honour to invite a reference to the various extracts in my last few weekly diaries reporting the movements of the raiders of Shaikh Saadoon of the Muntafik and Shaikh Mubarak, and in this connection to forward Arabic copies of certain correspondence with which the Shaikh of Kuwait has furnished me, and which I regret I am unable to have translated before the closing of the post. 2 The fighting foreshadowed in my^ diaries is a continuation of the quarrel which formed the subject of the reports noted in the margin. Shaikh Mubarak for his part has not done much beyond keeping up a small mobile force near Jahara as a safeguard, vhilst during my recent short tour northwards I learned that Shaikh Saadoon vas seriously contemplating an expedition which even included a possible ittack on Kuwait itself. My authority for this is a conversation which I had m the 12th January with one of Saadoon’s near relatives at Zubair who asked ne very pointedly whether the British Government would interfere to support Mubarak in the event of the Muntifik actually attacking Jahara or Kuwait, though Saadoon was prepared to guarantee that no harm would result to the British representative or British life and property. I contented myself with an wasive answer to the effect that until the event occurred I was not in a Knwait letter No. C.—12, dated the 9th March 1910. „ „ » C.—14, „ 30th „ „ „ „ „ C.— 30, „ 25 th May „ „ „ „ C.- 42, „ 12th July „ Kuwait diary, paragraph 137, of week ending 28th September 191*0.2 K position to guess what action His Majesty’s Government might or might not take, but I ventured to remind my questioner that it was not so very many years ago that the near approach to Kuwait of Ibn Kashid’s forces and the reported presence of large bodies of Turkish troops near Safwan had brought British men-of-war into the harbour of Kuwait. I also explained that the British Government was largely concerned with Kuwait as a port to which much British trade found its way and therefore I failed to see how they could disregard entirely a deliberate attempt on the town which must certainly affect those commercial interests. At the time I was not at all certain that these questions were not prompted by Turkish intrigue, and consequuntly only recalled past history leaving my interrogator to draw Bis own inferences. At the same time I counselled overtures of peace as being less damaging to both parties and the general ad van rages of a return to the friendly relations which up to a year ago always existed between Saadoon and Mubarak. 3. I saw the Shaikh yesterday and he informed me that the Yali of Basrah had addressed him on the subject of making peace with Saadoon and had offered himself as an intermediary. I enclose copies of the Vali’s letter to the Shaikh and the Shaikh’s reply. The latter purports to contain a history of the quarrel and though correct in the main facts is to some extent coloured as might be expected in an account given by one only of the parties. After the despatch of his reply the Shaikh received further news from his spies of Saadoon’s advance with a large force to within striking distance of Jahara and he then despatched his telegram to the Vali of which also I have the honour to enclose a copy. It will be seen from these two papers that the Shaikh’s attitude is correct and leaves no room for a plea that he is the aggressor. 4. This morning while I was drafting this letter the Shaikh came to see me and said that, though he suspected it before, he received last ni^ht reliable evidence from Baghdad that the whole of the present aggression°by Saddoon had the countenance of His Excellency Nazim Easha and is directed towards worrying Mubarak into a request for the intervention of the Turkish authorities in the quarrel and so forcing an acknowledgment of their right to settle his differences with others. After much pressing the Shaikh gave me the name of his informant, begging me to keep it secret. It will suffice here to note that this information came from a member of Nazim Pasha’s Council in whom he reposes considerable trust, and who I know to be an old and valued friend of Shaikh Mubarak. ^ The suggestion is supported by the fact that though the Turkish authorities have no cause to love the Muntafik tribes* from whom they have been unable for more than the last twenty years to extract any revenue either by force or by guile, Saadoon was for some time in the summer or autumn an honoured guest in Nazim Pasha’s palace at Baghdad ; and further, his own relative told me in Zubair that Saadoon had settled his differences with the Turks during his visit to Baghdad, though at what price he did not say. 5. Eventually the Shaikh, who was undoubtedly anxious at the turn affairs have assumed, requested me to explain the position to you and if possible, endeavour to secure the presence of one of His Majesty’s ships in*the harbour for a short time. The Shaikh w^ent on to say that he would not have made such a request but for the information just received from Baghdad He was quite prepared to meet Saadoon and his people in the usual Arab wav and felt confident of defeating him signally, but it was evident now that Saadoon’s boldness and the Basrah Yali’s efforts to act as a mediator were ali a part of the unending Turkish intrigue to induce him by pressure of one kind or another to open a door to Turkish intervention. He argues that the presence of a British warship in Kathama Bay would ensure the safety of Jahara and so of Kuwait by showing unmistakably that the British Government were aware of the intrigue and did not intend to permit Bedouin desert raids to form of assaults on coast towns. Ke tUe 6. Though the Shaikh affects confidence in his own men, I doubt whether he really feels it, and I am certain from outside information that they will be no match for even an inferior number of the resolute Muntafik Arabs. Shaikh Mubarak’s force consists of Nejada and townsmen who have no objections to3 the part of soldiers so long as that service means rations and a steady monthly wage without work, but for actual fighting they have no stomach. These are reinforced by large bands of Bedouin whose sole creed in fighting is plunder with safety and a whole skin and should they again encounter the Muntafik they will probably either desert in a bodv to the other side or leave the field at the earliest opportunity on their mounts. On military grounds, therefore, I think the presence of a ship-of-war would certainly check Saadoon’s aspirations to a raid on Jahara or Kuwait, and as soon as her arrival is reported to him it is probable Saadoon’s tribesmen would be dismissed or betake themselves to raid ing further inland. 7. If the Shaikh’s information regarding Turkish connivance in the raid is correct, and my own opinion is that it is so, the presence of a man-of-war will have a most salutary effect, and it is possible may even cause the Turkish Government to show its hand by a protest at her presence in Kathama Bay. 8. I need scarcely repeat bow nearly every one of Shaikh Mubarak’s diffi culties has its origin in Turkish intrigue or how incidents trivial in themselves and even unconnected with him are utilised to provoke and worry him, whilst at the same time a panacea for all these ills is offered in his acknowledgment of Turkish sovereignty either by inscribing himself or bis sons as Turkish subjects or by accepting a Turkish subsidy. The whole course of his relations with Turkish officials during the last few years shows that these intrigues will not cease until the Turkish Government is made to realise in the plainest manner that His Majesty’s Government are aware of its aims and will not permit them as disturbing their own relations with the Shaikh of Kuwait. On this ground alone I would solicit your support to the despatch of one of His Majesty’s ships to Kuwait for a short time (if one can be spared), even if the possibility of a raid on the town did not exist, but such being the case the Shaikh’s request becomes even more urgent, and I would beg that it may be considered as favourably as possible. Dated the 2nd Muharram 1329 (4th January 1911). From—The Vali of the Province of Basrah, To—The Hon'ble Kaim Makam of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubarak Pasha Al Subah. After presenting compliments let it not be hidden from you in view of the pi’eparation made for the execution of a military engagement between you and Saadoon Pasha, I wrote to the latter to prevent the occurrence of such an inci dent and I have now received a reply in which he says that there is absolutely no truth in what has been rumoured about the preparation made by him and that he has not moved from his place up to now, but that when he proceeded to Baghdad to see His Excellency Nazim Pasha you despatched your son Jaber with your tribesmen who plundered from him about 4,000 camels and that he prays for their restoration and will, at all times, be pre pared for a reconciliation. In consideration of this his writing, it is under stood that he has a desire for peace and for the removal of difficulties. Now it is left to you to say if you have an idea and if you will agree to that, please let me know and I will endeavour in what is necessary or you may nominate a person in whom you have confidence to be on your behalf and let me know his name. As to Saadoon Pasha I will write to him also to choose a man on his behalf, and when the two men appear before me, I shall, God willing, understand the object of both the parties and endeavour to bring about peace and to remove these differences according to the usages of the tribesmen. I am waiting ^to bear) the result from you. And Salaams to you with God’s peace and blessing. Translation of a telegram from Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait to His Honour the Vali of Basrah, dated the 16th January 1911. After compliments .—Saadoon had advised Your Honour that he had made no preparation and not moved Irom his place. I represented to you what was4 necessary in writing, and explained his falsehood. Now he has reached th° south-west of Safwan, which is within my territory and approached my tribesmen. The state of the tribesmen is known to Your Honour; when antagonists approach (each other) it is inevitable that a collision will take place between them. When I heard of his coming near, I did, in obedience to Your Honour’s orders, prevent my tribesmen from taking action against him and stopped them from approaching him, so that nothing whatever may take place before intimation reaches Your Honour and a reply is received. Now I have represented the circumstance to you, so that you may devise the necessary schemes for his returning to his own place. And if he remained in this place and anything took place I shall not he responssible. Dated the 15th Muharrura 1329 (17th January 1911). From —Shaikh Mubarak Al Subah, Ruler of Kuwait, To—His Honour Husain Jelal Bey, Vali of Basrah. After compliments .—After offering you my best respect I beg to state that I had the honour to receive your communication, dated 2nd Muharrum 1329, No. 27, in which you suggested all what was good and advisable. I thank you for your good w^ishes and wise suggestions. You had stated that a reply has been received from Saadoon that he has not moved from his place and has not made the least preparation. It is incumbent on him to tell you the truth. As to what he has stated to you that he is in his place, Mayaah, and in the palace in the bush at Abughar ; (1 would state that) he is not in his place, but that he has told a lie. I regret that he who belongs to a noble family tells a lie, but I say that it is his characteristic which he developed. May God guide him to improve himself. It is necessary for him to avail himself of this happy time and of the honest Government officials who endeavour in the interests of the Nation and the Government. May God help us in giving full satis faction to the officials of our Government. I, your sincere friend, will, God willing, follow a line of conduct which may be most peaceful and truthful, maintain justice and will not, inshallah, deal with the people except according to truth, justice and courtesy. The family of whether Saadoon himself or all the sons of Rashid are dear to me up to now and will remain so afterwards, inshallah, because w r e were on the most cordial terms with them since ancient times, from the days of Rashid till that of his sons Mansoor Pasha and Nasir Pasha and their sons who are now alive. And Saadoon does not deny this and will also not deny my kindness to himself particularly. This his dealing with us does not hurt us, but will hurt his name and honour. The causes which created this ill-feeling will be represented to Your Honour according to justice and with proofs. In the first instance Osman-al-Rashid, a merchant of Kuwait, sent his employes to the tribesmen wdth rice, clothes and coffee to be sold to the tribesmen who are on the side of Nejd—from Shammur to Umtheir—and Osman’s employes sold their goods and purchased camels and sheep and proceeded to our side. All the tribesmen, both Dhafir and others, were our friends; and Saadoon was like a son of mine in my estimation and was particularly good with me while he was not good to all the world. Ibn-i-Hallaf, the Shaikh of the Saeed tribesmen, seized from the employes of the said Osman Rashid the camels and sheep wffiich they had bought together with the furnitures of their houses as well as the sheep belonging to the people of Jaharah. They informed that these belonged to the people of Kuwait and explained this fact to him. He asked them to bring him a letter from me as was the ordinary procedure with him and the other headmen of the tribesmen ; whenever there is any plundered property belonging to my subjects with them I write to them and they return the same. Ibn Hallaf and his tribesmen, the Saeed, all took refuge with Saadoon, because the Shaikh of the Dhafir, Hamoodas-Soweith had banished them and gave Saadoon a share of the camels and sheep belong ing to the people of Kuwnit. I wrote to Ibn Hallaf to return them; but both he and Saadoon were inspired with covetousness. At tbe| sametime Saiyid Khalaf Naqibzadah happened to be with Saadoon on a visit because be is a great friend of his; and Saadoon started to proceed on a journey with the Saeeds and a party of the Muntafik herdsmen, and halted near my tribes men. My son Jaber happened to be with the tribesmen on an excursion to pass the spring and Saadoon warned the tribesmen who were with him saying that they have reached near the Kuwait tribesmen, and as they were thieves and would rob the furniture ot the bouses, he wished to prevent them from doing so. Saiyid Khalaf left Saadoon and came to my son Jaber, whom he in formed of tlie statement of Saadoon. He (Jaber) thanked him, and be also received a letter from Saadoon containing expressions of friendship and kind regards. A day after some one came to my son Jaber from tribesmen who were at a distance of 8 hours’ journey, informing him that they were attacked by Saadoon and plundered. On learning this Jaber told Saiyid Khalaf—“ How is this were these messages from Saadoon a trick by which we were duped through you? We will have to go to him and recover the loot from him ”. Saiyid Khalaf assured him that he himself would return and demand the plundered property from him. When Saiyid Khalaf met Saadoon he (the Saiyid) told him that he (Saadoon) acted very badly and that he (Saadoon) had both deceived him and them, that he should now return the loot otherwise it would be recovered forcibly. He replied—“ It does not matter, the plundered persons should come to me and I will return them (their property;”. My son Jaber sent the plundered persons and they received something which is not worth mentioning in comparison to what had been robbed. Friendly correspondence continued between me and Saadoon for the restoration of our plundered pro perty which remained with him, and the banishment of the Saeeds or the return of the plundered property which was with them. Saadoon was inspired with the baseness which is a characteristic of his and we were waiting for the Saeeds to separate from Saadoon; otherwise as regards Saadoon and all Saadoon’s tribesmen we shall, God willing, not agree that the least thing should be done by us against them and we will not oppose them purposely at present and in future. My son Jaber and Abdul Aziz-al-Saood learnt that on his return Saadoon was plun dered by the Ibn Hazzall and his tribesmen of Anezah when he attacked them and that he returned and went to his palace at Abugharand that the Saeeds separated from him. They, Jaber and Abdul Aziz Saood, availed themselves of this opportunity and when they reached near the Arabs they were met at daybreak by their own spies who informed them (hat the Arabs w r ere Bedouin herdsmen and that there was a tent with them, which, as they had understood, belonged to Saadoon. The spies also stated that according to what they saw there was Saadoon with the Arabs. They (Jaber and Abdul Aziz) abstained from attacking the Arabs in the morning owing to the fact that Siadoon was with them and waited till sunrise. They sent off certain horsemen to fire at the Arabs in order that they may attract a horseman from Saadoon’s party and they may warn him. They pitched their tents and left their camels and horses to graze and they did not take the offensive by way of evincing some politeness. Seeing this negligence on their part Saadoon collected the horsemen of Adh Dhatir who were with him as well as the mounted herdsmen of Muntafik, attacked their animals and plundered them in the pastures. This is the fact of this case, and I have truthfully represented to you what has happened. Now, God willing, I will take no action against Saadoon but against the tribesmen who adopted the path of villainy and who are not from amongst his dependents the Muntafik. Whenever we find any opportunity we will punish him for the sake of the security of the roads and of the persons who carry on business from Khamisiyah to Zubair, Kuwait and A1 Hasa. Now in compliance with your command, I will make no preparation against Saadoon, and so long as he is remaining with the bandits, 1 will avoid them until he succeeds in se parating from them. It is incumbent on him to abide by Your Honour’s commands and deal with you honestly. According to what he had mentioned to Your Honour he had not left his place, but he has now halted in our territories and awaits an opportunity to attack my tribesmen. His place is A1 Mayaah in the district of Muntafik, and his palace is in the bush at Abughar.6 He should return to his place in the same way as he advised Your Honour M that he was in his place and has not moved therefrom”. The Mudtafik tribeamen, who are herdsmen and who leave Gharraf, Hartha and Basrah itself for Shamiyah with the purpose of 'razing their animals have been deceived by him and have been forcibly collected by him in order that he may support himself by them. He has deceived them that they would be plundered if they separate. They have been safe all these years and we are guarding them and they were not the victims of the tribesmen from the first. A month and a half ago, I wrote to Nasir-al-Aseimi, who is a resident of Zubair and to whom the herdsmen refer for the satisfaction of their requirments, that he should inform them that they are safe to go to their former habitats and disperse for the purpose of feeding their animals and that I shall have nothing with Saadoon except what is good ; but that what he did to us did not hurt us but injure himself and his name. As to Saadoon’s situation and what he does there is no need for me to represent them to you as Your Honour will learn (them) from official archives With regard to Saadoon’s claim for the camels of the Dhafir tribesmen which were plundered by the Shaikh of the Umtheir tribesmen and his companions, this is a false argument. Firstly, the Umtheir and Dhafir were on these terms from ancient time and so were the other tribes* men. Further the Dhafir and Umtheir are united tribesmen and under their Amirs and are not connected with us or with Saadoon. Now as regards above-mentioned plundered property which he undertook to restore in a friendly w r ay he should, according to the usage of the Arabs, give it up if he wishes to efface his disgrace and be free from this shame and he should remain with me on the old terms. But if he is actuated by meanness, we are able to do without the property and this fact will remain in the memory of the Arabs and he will be isolated from us. As to Your Honour’s order that I should nominate some one on my behalf, I have (now) represented t &gt; you the facts and choose your own justice so that Saadoon may not cause mischief in this side. I have addressed you in order to explain the circumstances and hope that your kind attention will continue. In any case, order and decision will rest with Your Honour.

When Captain Shakespear’s letter of 18th January reached me, H. M. S. “ Philomel ” was at my disposal in connection with the presence of a large force of Kashgai and other armed tribesmen in Bushire, and His Excel lency the Nizam-es-Sultaneh and the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh having just departed, I was in a position to ask Captain Gurner to proceed to Kuwait, both in order that I might be kept in wireless touch and that the presence of His Majesty’s ship might help to influence the situation in the direction of peace. 3. When sending my telegram No. 88 on 28th instant, I had in my mind the parallel situ°tion which existed in lyOl when Kuwait was apprehending an attack by “ Ibu Rashid ”; on which occasion the Government of India gave my predecessor discretion, if the situation indicated it, to have a warning intimation sent to the Shammar Chief (vide Foreign Department telegram of 12th April 1901). 4. As Captain Shakespear’s report took some days in transit, I thought it advisable to aw r ait a message from H. M. S. “ Philomel ” after reaching Kuwait, before troubling the Government of India by telegram, and now the reassuring communication received this morning enables me to deal with the subject by post, for the present at all events. N 0i C.—1, dated Kuwait, the 18th January 1911 (Confidential). From —Captain W. H. I. Shakespear, Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to invite a reference to the various extracts in my last few weekly diaries reporting the movements of the raiders of Shaikh Saadoon of the Muntafik and Shaikh Mubarak, and in this connection to forward Arabic copies of certain correspondence with which the Shaikh of Kuwait has furnished me, and which I regret I am unable to have translated before the closing of the post. 2. The fighting foreshadowed in my diaries is a continuation of the 12 , dated the 9 th March 1910 . quarrel winch formed the subject of the reports noted m the margin. Shaikh Mubarak for his part has not done much beyond keeping up a small mobile force near Jahara as a safeguard, whilst during my recent short tour northwards I learned that Shaikh Saadoon was seriously contemplating an expedition which even included a possible attack on Kuwait itself* My authority for this is a conversation which I had on the 12th January with one of Saadoon’s near relatives at Zubair who asked me very pointedly whether the B.-itish Government would interfere to support Mubarak in the event of the Muntifik actually attacking Jahara or Kuwait, though Saadoon was prepared to guarantee that no harm would result to the British representative or British life and property. I contented myself with an evasive answer to the effect that until the event occurred I was not in a Kuwait letter No. C. „ ,, ,» C.—14, „ 30th ,, „ „ „ „ C.—30, „ 25 th May „ „ „ „ C.- 42, ,, 12th July „ Kuwait diary, paragraph 137, of week ending 28th September 1910.2 position to guess what action His Majesty’s Government might or might not take, but I ventured to remind my questioner that it was not so very many years ago that the near approach to Kuwait of Ibn Rashid’s forces and the reported presence of large bodies of Turkish troops near Safwan had brought British men-of-war into the harbour of Kuwait. I also explained that the British Government w'as largely concerned with Kuwait as a port to which much British trade found its w r ay and therefore I failed to see how they could disregard entirely a deliberate attempt on the town which must certainly affect those commercial interests. At the time I was not at all certain that these questions were not prompted by Turkish intrigue, and consequuntly only recalled past history leaving my interrogator to draw his own inferences. At the same time I counselled overtures of peace as ^ being less damaging to both parties and the general advantages of a return to the friendly relations which up to a year ago always existed between Saadoon and Mubarak. 3. I saw the Shaikh yesterday and he informed me that the Vali of Basrah had addressed him on the subject of making peace with Saadoon and had offered himself as an intermediary. I enclose copies of the Vali’s letter to the Shaikh and the Shaikh’s reply. The latter purports to contain a history of the quarrel and though correct in the main facts is to some extent coloured as might be expected in an account given by one only of the parties. After the despatch of his reply the Shaikh received further news from his spies of Saadoon’s advance with a large force to within striking distance of Jahara and he then despatched his telegram to the Yali of which also I have the honour to enclose a copy. It will be seen from these two papers that the Shaikh’s attitude is correct and leaves no room for a plea that he is the aggressor. 4. This morning while I was drafting this letter the Shaikh came to see me and said that, though he suspected it before, he received last night reliable evidence from Baghdad that the whole of the present aggression by Saddoon had the countenance of His Excellency Kazim Basha and is directed towards worrying Mubarak into a request for the intervention of the Turkish authorities in the quarrel and so forcing an acknowledgment of their right to settle his differences with others. After much pressing the Shaikh gave me the name of his informant, begging me to keep it secret. It will suffice here to note that this information came from a member of Nazim Pasha’s Council in whom he reposes considerable trust, and who I know to be an old and valued friend of Shaikh Mubarak. The suggestion is supported by the fact that, though the Turkish authorities have no cause to love the Muntafik tribes, from whom they have been unable for more than the last twenty years to extract any revenue either by force or by guile, Saadoon was for some time in the summer or autumn an honoured guest in Nazim Pasha’s palace at Baghdad ; and further, his own relative told me in Zubair that Saadoon had settled his differences with the Turks during his visit to Baghdad, though at what price he did not say. 5. Eventually the Shaikh, who was undoubtedly anxious at the turn affairs have assumed, requested me to explain the position to you and, if possible, endeavour to secure the presence of one of His Majesty’s ships in the harbour for a short time. The Shaikh went on to say that he would not have made such a request but for the information just received from Baghdad. He was quite prepared to meet Saadoon and his people in the usual Arab way, and felt confident of defeating him signally, but it was evident now that Saadoon’s boldness and the Basrah Vali’s efforts to act as a mediator were all a part of the unending Turkish intrigue to induce him by pressure of one kind or another to open a door to Turkish intervention. He argues that the presence of a British warship in Kathama Bay would ensure the safety of Jahara and so of Kuwait by showing unmistakably that the British Government were aware of the intrigue and did not intend to permit Bedouin desert raids to take the form of assaults on coast towns. 6. Though the Shaikh affects confidence in his own men, I doubt whether he really feels it, and I am certain from outside information that they will be no match for even an inferior number of the resolute Muntafik Arabs. Shaikh Mubarak’s force consists of Nejada and townsmen who have no objections to3 the part of soldiers so long as that service means rations and a steady monthly wage without work, but for actual fighting they have no stomach. These are reinforced by large bands of Bedouin whose sole creed in fighting is plunder with safety and a whole skin and should they again encounter the Muntafik they will probably either desert in a bodv to the other side or leave the field at the earliest opportunity on their mounts. On military grounds, therefore, I think the presence of a ship-of-war would certainly check Saadoon’s aspirations to a raid on Jahara or Kuwait, and as soon as her arrival is reported to him it is probable Saadoon’s tribesmen would be dismissed or betake themselves to raid ing further inland. 7. If the Shaikh’s information regarding Turkish connivance in the ^ raid is correct, and my own opinion is that it is so, the presence of a man-of-war will have a most salutary effect, and it is possible may even cause the Turkish Government to show its hand by a protest at her presence in Kathama Bay. 8. I need scarcely repeat how nearly every one of Shaikh Mubarak’s diffi culties has its origin in Turkish intrigue or how incidents trivial in themselves and even unconnected with him are utilised to provoke and worry him, whilst at the same time a panacea for all these ills is offered in his acknowledgment of Turkish sovereignty either by inscribing himself or bis sons as Turkish subjects or by accepting a Turkish subsidy. The whole course of his relations with Turkish officials during the last few years shows that ^ these intrigues will not cease until the Turkish Government is made to realise in the plainest manner that His Majesty’s Government are aware of its aims and will not permit them as disturbing their own relations with the Shaikh of Kuwait. On this ground alone I would solicit your support to the despatch of one of His Majesty’s ships to Kuwait for a short time (if one can be spared), even if the possibility of a raid on the town did not exist, but such being the case the Shaikh’s request becomes even more urgent, and I would beg that it may be considered as favourably as possible. Dated the 2 nd Muharrum 1329 (4th January 1911). From—The Vali of the Province of Basrah, To—The Hon’ble Kaim Makah of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubarak Pasha Al Subah. After presenting compliments let it not be hidden from you in view of the preparation made for the execution of a military engagement between you and Saadoon Pasha, I wrote to tbe latter to prevent the occurrence of such an inci dent and I have now received a reply in which he says that there is absolutely no truth in what has been rumoured about the preparation made by him and that he has not moved from his place up to now, but that when he proceeded to Baghdad to see His Excellency Nazim Pasha you despatched your son Jaber with your tribesmen who plundered from him about 4,000 camels and that he prays for their restoration and will, at all times, be pre pared for a reconciliation. In consideration of this his writing, it is under stood that he has a desire for peace and for the removal of difficulties. Now it is left to you to say if you have an idea and if you will agree to that, please let me know and I will endeavour in what is necessary or you may nominate a person in whom you have confidence to be on your behalf and let me know his name. As to Saadoon Pasha I will write to him also to choose a man on his behalf, and when the two men appear before me, I shall, God willing, understand the object of both the parties and endeavour to biing about peace and to remove these differences according to the usages of the tribesmen. I am waiting ^to bear) the result from you. And Salaams to you with God’s peace and blessing. Translation of a telegram from Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait to His Honour the 'Vali of Basrah, dated the 16th January 1911. After compliments .—Saadoon had advised Your Honour that he had made no preparation and not moved from his place. I represented to you what was4 necessary in writing, and explained his falsehood. Now he has reached th' south-west of Safwan, which is within my territory and approached my tribesmen. The state of the tribesmen is known to Your Honour; when antagonists approach (each other) it is inevitable that a collision will take place between them. When I heard of his coming near, I did, in obedience to Your Honour’s orders, prevent my tribesmen from taking action against him and stopped them from approaching him, so that nothing whatever may take place bet ore intimation reaches Your Honour and a reply is received. Now I have represented the circumstance to you, so that you may devise the necessary schemes for his returning to his ow r n place. And if he remained in this place and anything took place I shall not be responssible. Dated the 15th Muharrum 1329 (17th January 1911). From— Shaikh Mubarak Al Subah, Ruler of Kuwait, To —His Honour Husain Jelal Bey, Vali of Basrah. After compliments .—After offering you my best respect I beg to state that I had the honour to receive your communication, dated 2nd Muharrum’ 1329, No. 27, in which you suggested all what was good and advisable. I thank you for your good wishes and wise suggestions. You had stated that a reply has been received from Saadoon that he has not moved from his place and has not made the least preparation. It is incumbent on him to tell you the truth. As to what he has stated to you that he is in his place, Mayaah,and in the palace in the bush at Abughar ; (1 w ould state that) he is not in his place, but that he has told a lie. I regret that he who belongs to a noble family tells a lie, but I say that it is his characteristic which he developed. May God guide him to improve himself. It is necessary for him to avail himself of this happy time and of the honest Government officials w 7 ho endeavour in the interests of the Nation and the Government. May God help us in ffivinff full satis faction to the officials of our Government. I, your sincere friend, will, God willing, follow a line of conduct which may be most peaceful and truthful, maintain justice and will not, inshallah deal with the people except according to truth, justice and courtesy The family of whether Saadoon himself or all the sons of Rashid are dear to me up to now and will remain so afterwards, inshallah, because w'e were on the most cordial terms with them since ancient times, from the days of Rashid till that of his sons Mansoor Pasha and Nasir Pasha and their sons who are now alive And Saadoon does not deny this and will also not deny my kindness to himself particularly. This his dealing wdth us does not hurt us, but will hurt his name and honour. The causes which created this ill-feeling will be represented to Your Honour according to justice and with proofs In the first instance Osman-al-Rashid, a merchant of Kuwait, sent his employes to the tribesmen with rice, clothes and coffee to be sold to the tribesmen who are on the side of Nejd—from Shammur to Umtheir—and Osman’s employes sold their goods and purchased camels and sheep and proceeded to our side. All the tribesmen, both Dhafir and others, were our friends; and Saadoon was like a son of mine in my estimation and was particularly good with me while he was not good to all the world. Ibn-i-Hallaf, the Shaikh of the Saeed tribesmen, seized from the employes of the said Osman Rashid the camels and sheep wiiich they had bought together with the furnitures of their houses as well as the sheep belono-Tn^ to the people of Jaharah. They informed that these belonged to°the people of Kuwait and explained this fact to him. He asked them to bring him a letter from me as was the ordinary procedure with him and the other headmen of the tribesmen ; whenever there is any plundered property belonging to my subjects with them I write to them and thev return the same. Ibn Hallaf and 'his tribesmen, the Saeed, all took refu«e with Saadoon, because the Shaikh of the Dhafir, Hamoodas-Soweith had' banished them and gave Saadoon a share of the camels and sheep belong ing to the people of Kuwait. I w^rote to Ibn Hallaf to return them- hut both he and Saadoon were inspired with covetousness. At the| same5 time Saiyid Khalaf Naqihzadah happened to he with Saadoon on a visit because he is a great friend of his; and Saadoon started to proceed on a journey with the Saeeds and a party of the Muntafik herdsmen, and halted near my tribes men. My son Jaber happened to he with the tribesmen on an excursion to pass the spring and Saadoon warned the tribesmen who were with him sayin^ that they have reached near the Kuwait tribesmen, and as they were thieves and would rob the furniture ot the houses, he wished to prevent them from doing so. Saiyid Khalaf left Saadoon and came to my son Jaber, whom he in formed of the statement of Saadoon. He (Jaber)*thanked him, and he also received a letter from Saadoon containing expressions of friendship and kind regards. A day after some one came to my son Jaber from tribesmen who were at a distance of 8 hours’ journey, informing him that thev were attacked by Saadoon and plundered. On learning this Jaber told Saiyid Khalaf—' How is this were these messages from Saadoon a trick by which we were duped through you? We will have to go to him and recover the loot from him”. Saivid Khalaf assured him that he himself would return and demand the plundered property from him. When Saiyid Khalaf met Saadoon he (the Saiyid) told him that he (Saadoon) acted very badly and that he (Saadoon) had both deceived him and them, that he should now return the loot otherwise it would be recovered forcibly. He replied-' It does not matter, the plundered persons should come to me and I will return them (their property;”. My son Jaber sent the plundered persons and they received something which is not worth mentioning m comparison to what had been robbed. Friendly correspondence continued between me and Saadoon for the restoration of our plundered pro- perty which remained with him, and the banishment of the Saeeds or the return ot the plundered property which was with them. Saadoon was inspired with the baseness which is a characteristic of his and we were waiting for the Saeeds to separate from Saadoon; otherwise as regards Saadoon and all Saadoon’s tribesmen we shall, God willing, not agree that the least thing should be done by us against them and we will not oppose them purposely at present and in future Mv son Jaber and Abdul Aziz-al-Saood learnt that on his return Saadoon was blun dered by the Ibn Hazzall and his tribesmen of Anezah when he atiacked them and that he returned and went to his palace at Abughar and that the Saeeds separated from him. They, Jaber and Abdul Aziz Saood, availed themselves ot this opportunity and when they reached near the Arabs they were met at daybreak by their own spies who informed them that the Arabs were Bedouin herdsmen and that there was a tent with them, which, as they had understood belonged to Saadoon. The spies also stated that according to what thev saw there was Saadoon with the Arabs. # They (Jaber and Abdul Aziz) abstained from attacking the Arabs in the morning owing to the fact that Siadoon was with them and waited till sunrise. They sent off certain horsemen to fire at the Arabs in order that they may attract a horseman from Saadoon’s partv and they may warn him They pitched their tents and left their camels and horses to graze and they did not take the offensive by way of evincing some politeness Seeing this negligence on their part Saadoon collected the horsemen of Adh Dhatir who were with him as well as the mounted herdsmen of Muntafik attacked their animals and plundered them in the pastures. This is the fact of this case, and I have truthfully represented to you what has happened. Now God willing,! will take no action against Saadoon but against the tribesmen who adopted the path of villainy and who are not from amongst his dependents the Muntafik Whenever we find any opportunity we will punish him for the sake of the security of the roads and of the persons who carry on business from Khamisiyah to Zubair, Kuwait and A1 Hasa. Now in compliance with your command, I will make no preparation against Saadoon, and so Ion* as he is remaining with the bandits, 1 will avoid them until he succeeds in Se parating from them. It is incumbent on him to abide by Your Honour’s commands and deal with you honestly. According to what he had mentioned to Your Honour he had not left his place, but he has now halted in our territories and awaits an opportunity to attack my tribesmen. His place is A1 Mayaah in the district of Muntafik, and his palace is in the bush at Abughar.6 'n 'ill He should return to his place in the same way as he advised Your Honour “ that he was in his place and has not moved therefrom . ihe Mudtafik tribeamen, who are herdsmen and who leave Gharraf, Hartha and Basrah itself for Sh a m i yah with the purpose of grazing their animals ha\e been deceived by him and have been forcibly collected by him in order that he may support himself bv them.

Some 460 minor Sheikh^and their adherents of the same tribe are represented by the Sheikh and his brother. Sheikh says that two months ago they killed their uncle who was the Turkish Government representative in the matter of the land contracts, and that they seized nine large tracts of land belonging to Government on the Tigris. They still hold these tracts of which I have received the names. They seem to be determined that they will not pay tazes on these lands unless the Governmzubt agree to give them on lease to the present owners for 15 years. The Sheikh informed me that any one who interfered with them would be killed, so that if the Turkish troops try to evict them, there will be bloodshed generally. . Money is wanted by the Turkish Government and they may be disposed to temporise, but in this matter I should not rely on promises made by either party. Crow. i/3S Telegram. From - Consul, Busreh. To - Embassy, Constantinople, Repeated Resident. No. 14. Dated and received 21st Uarch 1913. With reference to your Secret telegram No.9. On receipt of the message from Sir E. Grey the Sheikh expressed his pleasure and gratitude. As I was previously unacquainted with the Sheikh^ and in view of the secret nature of his application^ I have requested him to produce a satisfactory proof of his identity before the action which is proposed is taken on his behalf. He has promised to furnish this proof, and on receipt of it, I will send a further report. CrowCONFIDENTIAL. cnp, V wu No. 27 / 3 , dated Bushire, the f 4 th (received 22 nd) September 1913 . From—L ieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.L, Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, Officiating Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Depart ment, Simla. In case the Shaikh of Kuwait or his interests may be brought into the dispute, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a Memorandum kindly communicated to me by His Majesty’s Consul, Basrah, regarding certain disturbances which have recently taken place at Ma amir on the Shatt-al-Arab above Fao, between Shaikh Naghaimish, the headman of the settlement on behalf of certain Muntafik Chiefs, and the Basrah authorities in conjunction with some of the said Chiefs. (For details of the locality vide Gulf Gazetteer page 114.) 2. From Fan comes the report that local sympathies are with Naghaimish who is considered to have been unjustly treated by the Turks. It is not ex pected that Naghaimish will stay quiet, and further disturbances seem to be anticipated. MEMORANDUM. % Naghaimish at Ma’amir. Naghaimish is agent of the late Miziad Pasha and of Abdullah Bey son of Falih Pasha and of Ibrahim Bey son of Mizal Pasha. He is employed at Ma’amir to collect the revenue of his principals’ date gardens and to manage the farmers. His salary is 200 small karas of dates per annum. . Ajaimi bin Sadun, who is at enmity with Abdullah Bey, incited Naghaimish against his masters and promised him help Naghaimish is said to have been encouraged by Ajaimi’s action In regard to Miziad Pasha, uncle of Abdullah Bey (he robbed him of several thousands of pounds last year) and set to work to make money for hims If too. Accordingly when the dates were ripe this year he began to cut them and sell them at his own price before the general meeting of dategrowers to fix the year'y price had been held. Abdullah complained to the Vilayet and steps were taken to restrain Naghaimish. 80 soldiers were sent to Ma’amir in August to protect Abdullah Bey’s interests. The Marmaris also visited Ma amir in August for the same purpose. In view of Naghaimish’s reports to the Vilayet the Vali on August 27th decided to send 90 soldiers to Ma’amir and they took provisions for 7 days. The Marmaris left again for Ma amir on September 1st to stop Naghaimish from doing more harm. There was a little fighting with the result th^t 14 of Naghaimish’s men were killed and 6 men belonging to Ibrahim Bey killed and 4 wounded. Two soldiers were slightly wounded. Naghaimish seems to have fled and the soldiers returned to Basrah this week. Naghaimish is merely an Agent appointed at a fixed salary but he appears to have claimed cultivating rights (Ta’abe) to which he is said not to be entitled. Government advised him in the first instance to take steps in the courts to enforce his claim, if he had one, and warned h m that he would otherwise be restrained from exercising these rights. Naghaimish is said to have defied the orders of the Government and to have opposed the soldiers sent to restrain him and to have used armed force against them. The incident disturbed the date farmers bom h ao to Abul Khassib but matters calmed down owing to the Government’s action against Naghaimish. Shaikh Mubarak is said to be interested in the dispute as he is afleged to have claims on a portion of the Ma’amir propertv The Shaikh is reported to have told Abdullah Bey that Naghaimish would be arrested if found, but it is currently believed that Shaikh Mubarak took Naghai mish away with him and that he is protecting him. C70F.&gt;-41—26 9-13-GCBP Simla/^o A copy of a demi-official letter dated the 20th April, 1914, from A.E. Grant, Esquire, C.I.E., I.C.S., Deputy Secretary, Foreign and Political Department, Simla, to Major S.G.Knox, C.I*E*, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I am desired to enclose herewith an extract from a letter from Sir L. Mallet to Sir Edward Grey, No, 117, dated the 24th February 1914, from which you will observe that it is reported that the Arab nationalist element at Basrah have secured the sympathy of the Shaikh of Kuwait and have established communications with him and other various local notabilities in their intrigues against the Turkish Government. Shaikh Mubarak might be relied upon not to let himself be drawn into such intrigues; agitators no doubt find his name a convenient one to juggle with however, and it would be as well to keep the Shaikh himself informed of what is being said. I am accordingly to request you to instruct Grey to acquaint the Shaikh verbally with the manner in which his name is being dragged in and to ask him if he knows who the mischiefmaker is./«/ Extract from a letter from Sir L« Mallet to Sir Edward Grey, No, 117, dated Constattinople, the 24th February 1914. The Grand Vazier gave me to understand that ♦Aziz^li Boy 1 s arrest was due to his attitude towards the Government aince his return to Constantinople, and tt is clear from what I have since learned from other sources that the matter is really a political one, for there is no doubt that ^ziz’Ali Bpy has been one of the leading spirits in a group of young Arabs, officers, and others, who are dissatisfied with the present Turkish Government. It is difficult to gauge the im portance of this group, but it has come to my knowledge that some at least of them are identified with more or less definite schemes for organising a movement which would aim at releasing v the whole region from Mosul to the Persian Gulf from Turkish domination. They claim to have established communications with various local notabilities, including the Shaikh of Kuwait, whose sympathy they say they have secured, and one of their plans would appear to be to attach the tract of country in which they are interested to the Shaikh^ dominions. They profess to be in a position to organise an insurrectionary movement on such a scale as would enable them to cope with the strong re pressive measures which the Turkish Government would, they realise, take to repress it. Schemes of this kind are of course not new, and I have no reason to believe that the originators of this one are powerful or competent. As, however, a definite role is attributed to the Shaikh of Kuwait, and in view of the unrest which undoubtedly prevails at Basrah, I think it my duty to bring it to your notice. If the plan of creating an insurrection in Mesopotamia should take shape, one of the aims of its promoters would be to compel British intervention. I have caused it to be known to some of the persons concerned that His Majesty’s Government would- © 1 INDIA OFFICE RECORDS MICROFILM INDIA OFFICE RECORDS J.y MICROFILM</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003b5_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/5/26</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003b5</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/5/26</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File X/3 Disorders &amp; Raids near Basra &amp; in Koweit [Kuwait] Hinterland'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1909/1917</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-07-07T22:53:44</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (150 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 152; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
