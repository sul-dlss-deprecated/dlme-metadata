In June, 1949» he graduated from the University of Wales* Last fall Mr. Asfour began his graduate work at the U.5.A.C. in the field of Agronomy. At this time he is well known anong his tecchere and his fellow students for his industry and high scholastic attainments.

In the official capacity of my office, I have had many opportunities to evaluate the work and character of Ur 9 Asfour during the past school year.

Dear Consulate, We have received your telegram No. 1227 of the 18th July regarding travel arrangements for Ammouna. 2 . We were in fact awaiting your instructions about Ammouna 1 s journey when he turned up here and asked us to try to arrange for him to leave for Bahrein at once. After the despatch of our telegram No. 52 Misc., proposing to send Ammouna by air on the 20th, we learned that he had no entry visa to Egypt. Palestinians entering Egypt from Gaza have to deposit £. E. 20 as a guarantee of bona fides and this is refunded to them when they leave the country. Ammouna says he has not got £. E. 20 and cannot borrow it, which is hardly surprising after several years in a refugee camp. 3 . As we do not wish to be party to any irregularities we advised Ammouna to return to Gaza and we have told him that he must be in possession of an entry visa to Egypt when he comes here en route for Muscat. Do you think that the Muscat Government would authorise us to advance £. E. 20 to Ammouna when you send us his travel instructions? This would, of course, be recoverable and, as he is on the pay roll since 12th May, it should not present any serious difficulty. We should be grateful if you could arrange this as it is very doubtful if Ammouna will be able to produce the requisite sum without which he cannot enter Egypt officially. Yours ever, H.M.

This letter, I hope, will give the necessary details, which, to my respect, I did not mention fully before lest it would been too monotonous for an application. I am 23 years old. I was born in Halhul village, Hebron, Palestine. I was sent to school at the village at the age of eight and finished from th^re at the ago of 13 . Then I was top of the class and it was for that reason rather than any of the many other methods usually employed that I was accepted at the Secondary School c.t Hebron. Thor© i ctnyod four years, walking daiU r^ om the village to the twon, ' most vivid i'ocol .1 ot.i oni Somehow I was '.gain the top in that school Qi the District with Distinction in English and Arabic.’ 2 ven then I was not accepted at the two high colljmes in Jerusalem and the high handed authority of my uncle, a Sheikh Mulhim in the District, thr.atenod to expose the Sducationa Department and so on until the village lad got his f ir ch nee. So in 1943 1 was at Rashidiya College - Jerusalem. There I took my Palestine Matriculation, second in Latin, Distiction in Arabic and high credit in the rest in 1945. I came back to the same College in the following year to train, as usual, as a te chor. There I prepared for London Matriculation and its Intermediate. I got the former and v. .s saved the trouble of the latter by a scholarship from the Mandatory Government. By the terms of that Scholarship I was to study law in England and work wish the Government for 5 years later.

His work as a teacher was satisfactory he has, I believe, a good knowledge of English, but his behaviour was not satisfactory. When he resigned he intimated that he wished to stay on in Bahrain but he was dissuaded from doing so. The American Mission is very interested in him and I believe the Mission authorities in Kuwait are considering his employment as an Arabic teacher. I am not prepared to recommend him owing to the trouble which the school authorities had with him in Bahrain.^ The Political Agency Muscat.No.(106/11/32/50) British Consulate, MUSCAT August 5t 1950 Sir, j I have the honour to refer to the correspondence resting with my endorsement No.102/ 11/32/50 dated 23 rd July, 1950. 2 , I enclose x herewith a copy of a telegram No.54 dated 3/8/50 received from the Br.

In recent weeics we have been reeeivittg large numbers of applications from refugees in the Gaza area and it was felt that we should establish an agreed method of handling these applications, A meeting v/as, therefore, held at this Office on June 9 th to discuss this matter and I enclose a note summarising the procedure which was agreed upon. 2, I trust that you will be willing to accept from us notifications which we receive of offers^of employment likely to bo suitable for refugees and if possible have them brought to the notice of prospective candidates. It is not anticipated tnat^ there will be any large scale demand for workers and I should particularly like to stress that, if the United Nations Relief &amp; Works Agency has already established or in the future should establish machinery for dealing with the placing in employment of the refugees, we shall be glad to relinquish the small part we are playing in this work. On the other hand, if you consider that 3 ur present efforts are useful I should be grateful if you could lefc us know your views on the manner in which v/e propose to deal with notifications of vacancies and applications for employment.

In attendance were: Mr. M. T. Audsley, Labour Counsellor, British Embassy. Mr. E. Milon, British Consulate. Mr* P*B. Johnson, Chief District Officer for the Gaza area United Nations Relief and V/orks Agency. Mr. Jamal Haram&amp;d, Chairman of the Coinrr.it tee for the Relief of ex-Palestine Government officials in Cairo. Miss M. Sullivan, B.M.E.q. The meeting was called in an edeavour to co-ordinate the efforts which arc being made to assist refugees to find employment. It was made clear that only certain small numbers of Palestinians were being assisted by the B.M.E.O. at present and that such assistance must not be considered as in any way pretending to deal with the immense problem of rehabilitation and resettlement of refugees which will no QDubt be dealt with by the U.N.R.W. Agency. It was agreed that notifications of all offers of employment likely to be suitable for refugees received at the B.M.E.O. through official channels should continue to be dealt with by Miss Sullivan. It will be Miss Sullivan 1 s duty to ensure that notifications of vacancies give fullest possible details regarding the nature of the employment and the qualifications required. Mr. Audsley (or his office in his absence) will examine vacancies for skilled (and in some cases unskilled) workers and provide a questionnaire suitable for each occupation involved to enable those under talcing the recruiting to ensure (as far as is reasonably possible for the layman) that applicants selected arc in fact suitable for the vacancies. After examination , 7 notifications of vacancies together with the questionnaires will be sent by Miss Sullivan to the Deputy Director of the U.N. Relief and works Agency at Beirut, copying to the Consulate General at Cairo and to Mr. Jamal Hammad for refugees in Cpiro. It is assumed that Beirut will notify the U*N.R.M.a. District Officers through Agency channels. Mr. Johnson offered to explore the opportunities in the Gaza area for trade testing in cases where this is required by the nature of the vacancies. Mr. Milon indicated ttm.tthe Consulate is willing to continue to transmit all applications for vacancies in Tripolitania, Cyrenaica and Eritrea but suggested Tripoli and Benghazi might now be asked to send notifications of vacancies for refugees direct to B.M.E.O. for Miss Sullivan. / Applications for/ * 2 - Applications for employment from refugees should also be channelled through Miss Sullivan who will send those for F* 0.A*A, Territories to Mr. I.Iilon and others to the British posts from which noti fication of vacancies was received.

Ref: E. 1742/10 Dear Miss Waterlow. Thank you for your letter dated 14th inst. ref. quoted above. As regards teachers certificate I have got one from the Government Arab College in Jerusalem in 1944 after two years of training as a teacher. Moreover I had practical experience as a teacher in Palestine Government schools in 1944-46. From what I have noticed from mixing with many trainee or experienced teachers in this country, I can*t see any real difference between my Palestine teaching diploma and the diplomas they get here. Unfortunately, however, I have not got my diploma here but I left it in Palestine at my home. As regards my qualifications they are as follows: 1. Palestine Matriculation in 1942. 2. London Matric External “Arts” passed in June 1945. 5. Palestine Intermediate Arts passed in July 1944. 4. Government Arab College, Jerusalem, Diploma in Education obtained in 1944. 5. M.A. with 'upper' second class Honours in History from Glasgow University (Finals passed in May 1950). Like every other person with these qualifications, naturally I look to the remuneration, security, prospects and responsibility of any job X apply for. Moreover, owing to my peculiar family responsibilities in Palestine (Jordan), I would rather work in a place as near to my family as possible. To put the matter candidly, Muscat is not my first choice especially because I do not ioiow of the details of the job suggested for me there. Meantime, because I have not got any offers of work elsewhere yet, I cannot wisely give a categorical refusal to work in Muscat. After my graduation in Glasgow at the end of this month I am coming down to London to discuss and look for possibilities of work in the concerned agencies in London. I am sorry for this undecided attitude that I have adopted in this letter, but it is the only one possible under the present circumstances. Meantime, klli 1 come to London I should be very grateful if you would kindly keep me informed of any new suggestions for worn. Yours sincerely, (sgd.) S.

Dear Sir, I wish to thank you very much for your letter dated 2nd of August, for it seemed to brighten up a future which looked very gloomy. I am glad to accept the offer of the Foreign Office for employment in the Middle East where work should be more congenial for me. I was born at Rama, Acre, Palestine. Later I was sent to the Reshioliya College, Jerusalem, where I took the Palestine Matriculation in 1943. Then I was transferred to the Government. Arab College, Jerusalem. In December of 1943 I took the Lonaon Matriculation on my own. In the Arab College I took a Teachers' Training Cour se, and I obtained a diploma for that purpose. I stayed two years at the Arab College, during which I studied Greek, Latin Logic, Philosophy, English, Arabic, etc., and in August 1945 I passed the Palestine Intermediate, with distinction in English and Logic. In the summer of 1945 I was awarded a scholarship by a Selection Board appointed by the Secretaries of the pre vious Palestine Government. So I arrived in this country on the 12th of August 1945 and started studying law at the Univ ersity College London. In August 1948 I obtained the London LL.B with Second Class Honours. In October of the same year I was admitted to the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies where I embarked upon some research work for the LL.M. degree. Early this year, however, it came to my knowledge that my scholarship would come to an end on the 30th of Septem ber. So I suddenly stopped my work for the LL.M. ahd started workingfor the Bar Examination. I sat for the latter last in May and consequently I was called to the Bar about the end of lest June. My scholarship was discontinued last July, and I am now in a very serious financial position. I tried to get a temporary job of some kind, but all my attemots met wit^ no success. Hoping that you will give kindly attentions to my position, I remain, Sir, Tours faithfully, (Sgd.)

He was very depressed and said that the Sultan never gave him an interview or visited the school and he does not know if he approves of his work. A year ago he had 250 pupils and teachers. Owing to lack of staff he has had to close the kindergarten class and has rejected many pupils. 2. He gave me the names of two old friends of his in Palestine whose whereabouts he does not at present know and whom he would be glad to have in Muscat as teachers. I am enquiring from the B.M.E.O. whether they can be traced. 3. I suggested to Ghalib that the Muscat Government might be asked to consider the possibility of sending a few promising students to Bahrain for training as teachers, though I do not know yet whether the Bahrain Government would be willing to accept them. If you see no objection, would you kindly pursue this proposal with the Muscat Government and let me know the result? 4.
