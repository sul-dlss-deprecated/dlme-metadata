OOHROEHTiAL RE0QR5S Lt.-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.E., I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait; To Tlie Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, 3 U S E I H ^ Intelligence Summary for month ending 30th June 1933. s r ]/y\ Sir, In continuation of my Confidential Summary No.81, dated the 26th April, I have the honour to forward the follow ing items of news dealing with local^hinterland and Nejd mat ters. One copy is being sent direct to Jedda by Secret Bag via Baghdad and 6 copies to you for distribution. I regret that owing to great pressure of work, I was unable to submit a 'Summary' of news for the month of May. I.IRAQ SH j UPHSRD THIB1S&gt; The end of May saw the last of the Iraq shepherd tribes return to their homes on the Euph^rates. This follows normal procedure. The shepherds fared very well whilst in Kuwait ter- ntory, and sold their wool and ghee in Kuwait at prices which they had not realized for some years. This may be put down to the exceptionally good grazing which the Winter of 1932-33 .in brought/its train. II.SURVEY OF KUvVAIT imTTRAL 20115, (a) Captain Papworth, R.E., attached to R.A.f, Headquarters ^ ^ 1 IHeadquarters Baghdad, who has been engaged on the survey of Kuwait Principality, including the Kuwait Neutral Zone during the Unter and Spring of 1932 -SS, closed down all survey operations on the 19th May 1953, owing to the advent of the hot weather. (h) Captain Papworth in a final report to the Politi cal Agent, before leaving, stated that the only portions remaining to be surveyed were (a) A small strip on the north side of the Bay of Kuwait; (b) The north eastern section of the Neutral Zone. (c) Captain PapY/orth,stated that he hoped to return again in October of 1935, to complete these two portioiB . (d) It may not be out of place here to mention that Captain Papworth worked throughout in two parties, one party under himself dealing with the preliminary work of fixing points etc. etc., Yhile the second party under an assistant followed behind and made the detailed survey. (e) Both parties were equipped with field wireless sets, and were provided with permanent escorts and glides by the Shaikh of Kuwait. (f) Throughout the period of the survey operations no incidents occurred worthy of mention, except on 8th May 1933, when Captain Papworth, who vms camped at Wafrah in the Neutral Zone, received a report from a Kuwait tribesman {who had been maltreated by a Saudiyeh Blockade patrol, south of Arak) that a Saudian raid was contemplated on his camp, from across the border. Nothing, however, eventuated and the report, as indeed the writer thought at the time, turned out to be a canard. (g) Captain Papworth and the members of his staff made themselves extremely popular with the Shaikh of Kuwait and the Bedouin, with whom they came in contact,- 3 - i contact, and earned golden opinions and praise for the tact and good will which they displayed, wherever they went,. (h) The Shaikh generously expressed his appreciation to the waiter of the way the survey operations had been carried out and especially pr^aised Captain Papworttu The writer in reply addressed the Shaikh by letter and thanked him for the valuable assistance which had at all times been forthcoming from him and his officials^ III»POLITICAL AG-IllTS TOUR TO THE SOTJTHIilRN BORDER OF THE NBUTRAL ZOI-lfT (a) During May, the writer visited Captain Papworth at Wafrah, and proceeded in a single car to the southern border of the Neutral Zone, visiting the hills of Hamma, Mutayi, Hafafat, and the wells of Shathaf and Arak on route. He got within a short distance of AIM. al Abd, but owing to the bad going and the lack ^of time iras unable to reach that very interesting spot. (b) According to Capiain Papworth, Ain al Abd, con sisted of an evil smelling spring of water rising in a circular basin 15 miles from the sea, and some 10 miles hxSpv- | due east of Arak. 1 The water consisted of H.2{Sulphurated Hydrogen) with very little buoyancy, and flowed in a stream to the sea at the rate of approximately 1000 gallons a minute. (c) As a result of Captain Papworth's observations it was ascertained that Arak lay just inside the Neutral Zone border, whilst Ain al Abd lay exactly on the border line. This demolishes the oft made claim of the Nejd authorities that Arak is in Nejd territory. (d) Another interesting discovery made as a result of the survey was that the lower end of the ^hagg^ depres sion lay 4 to 5 miles further west than as shown on the existing million sheet.'f : -4- IY.BIIT SAUD AND TK3 PHIAKL BAIIKS 0? HASSA ] Towards tlie end of May and early in June persis tent rumours were received in Kuwait to the effect that H.M. King Abdul Aziz al Saud was preparing to launch a final economic attack on Kuwait* The method to be employed being as follows:- (a) A definite offer would be made to the Shaikh of Kuwait asking that the latter should fall in with certain proposals, to be made by the King for settling the Blockade impasse. The proposal would greatly benefit Hejd and Saudiyeh generally but not Kuwait. The King counted on the active and moral support of several thousands of Nejdis do miciled in Kuwait, who were to bring the necessary pressure on the Shaikh of Kuwait, at the right moment. GOIMSNT. (a) could not properly be termed anything but rumours, so were not reported at the time by the writer, who preferred to await developments. (b) The arrival on the 15th June of the King 1 s let ter to the Shaikh, making the startling proposal that he (the Shaikh) should raise hissea customs tariff to that ruling in the Kings dominions, and in return that the King should allow trade with the interior, tribal tribute (b) Should the Shaikh of Kuwait reject the King's offer then the Blockade was to be tightened up by the strengthening of the frontier patrols to double and even treble their present strengths, and a wireless station Y/as to be established at Hafar al Bat in and perhaps a fitted set at Jarriya al Ilya also, expressly with a view to assist ing the Blockade staff in their duties. At the same time the King would notify His Majesty's Government and the Shaikh of Kuwait that the Kuwait pearling fleet was to be forbidden to operate on the Hassa Coast within the three mile limit - a ban that would gravely disorganize the Kuwait pearl industry, whose boats from time immemorial had been accustomed to operate on certain banks close in shore in the vicinity of Mishaab and Abu Ali. The above stories, although very persistent. only being taken, would now seem to give definite supportll I - 5 - support to the stories mentioned above. V.BLQGKkm. (a) There have been no incidents worth reporting during May and June except for the persistent rumours men tioned in the preceding paragraph. (b) Bin Sauds latest Blockade proposal, which arrived in the form of a very obscurely Y/orded letter to the Shaikh on 15th June, and which is mentioned in comment (b) of paragraph XV above, is interesting. It is certainly the reverse of helpful. If studiei, the offer resolves itself into the following:- n I have blockaded Kuwait for 10 years, hoping to bring it to its kneels: Kuwait is still alive though very sick. I propose making a last offer to the Shaikh, which if accepted, will mean giving Kuwait either its 'coup de grace' or forcing it finally to come under my Politi cal control'. (c) Two points appear not to have been taken into consideration by the King in putting forward the proposal;- (a) He ignores the fact that the Shaikh and the mercantile community of Kuwait are very shrewd business men and can be counted to see through the trap: (b) He forgets {or pretends to forget) that Kuwait came into being, and has existed for the last hundred or so years solely bv virtue of the fact tha t she, like. Bahrain , is a 'distributing centre' . That she exi-sts , and has existed, by her 'transit' trade alone .ith North Sast Nejd and Qassim, and a that to encourage this trade to come in by |j the Kuwait door she has of set policy main tained her sea customs tariff at the low figure of 4 fo (just as Bahrain has). !| (d) Clearly if the Shaikh of Kuwait were to raise his sea customs to that of Bin Sauds Kassa Ports (incident- 1 ally his treaty with us forbids this), then Kuwait would at once lose her present advantage over the Saudian ports of Jubail, Q,atif and Ojair, where a duty of 70 ^ to 100 c /o- 6 - a { ^y 100 fo ad valorem is now imposed on imports (apart from the 2% fo transit dues paid to the G-overnment of Bahrain)- (d) Siea It should not be forgotten that Kuwait possesses no other means of trade, except this rf transit n trade, and her pearl trade♦ She has no manufactories, no agricultural community and no exports. (f) To any one residing in Kuwait and knowing local conditions, a continuance of the existing trade blockade would be far more to the advantage of the Kuwaiti merchant than to fall in with Bin Sauds offer.. The merchant under the blockade can at least do some business by running contraband goods into Nejd and Qassim: under Bin Sauds scheme he would simply die» YI.TRIBA.L. There is little to report under this head.. All tribal groups have,at the time of writing, camped ! on water, where they will summer. Peace also reigns every-l where• (a) The Ijitair are on the wells of Hafay, Safa, Haba, Qaraa, Wabra, Jarriya.. NOTE. Eamud al Ba^aawi , the Kings Blockade Officer has his camp at Jarriya. (b) The Shammar , those nearest to Kuwait, are scat tered round about the Iraq Neutral Zone as follows Um al Huthumah — Al Tuwala , under Mishal ibn Twala and Shakhaiyir ibn Tawala. U^uba — Al Timiat. Dulaimiyeh —- Mixed camp. Al Masari. — ^bda under ibn Shuralm.1 8 would die soon, and then he (Ivhalid) would come into his own, for shall become Shaikh of all the Ajman, and lead them against the A1 Saud and war with them till they or I shall be dead' (his words). He, however, expressed affection for Saud al Arafa who was half an AJman tribes man (his mother being an Ajmiyeh) . He was the only one of the house of Al Saud, who was worth anything, he said. We shall invite him to join us and help us in the fight. IQialid returned to his camp with Anaza in the Wadian on 20th June 1952. VI.VISIT 0Y SHAIKH 0? KXT/AIT TO BAERiltf i The Shaikh of Kuwait accompanied by his cousin Salman al Hamud and three leading merchants of Kuwait proceeded by private yacht to Bahrain on 18th June 1932. He is expected back on 2nd July^ The visit is probably connected with oil, and the Concession, which Bin Saud recently gave to the Standard Oil G-roup. The Shaikh before his departure said to the writer that when the King died he (the Shaikh ) would certainly lay claim to the whole of North East Hassa as far as the line Balbul (i.e. the Mutair and Awazim country A ruled over by Shaikh Mubarak). If Bin Saud put any Americans in that area now, he added, he (the Shaikh) wouH h certainly turn them out later. The writer merely reminded the Shaikh about the mistake of counting chickens before they hatched. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant.

I am, as usual, sending one copy direct to Jedda. I. Tribal Concentration ^ (a) Ajman | Llutair 1 No change. Awazim i Harb. I (b) Dahamsha (Anaze) A group of some 50 tents were reported to be at Chuebda, North West of Kuwait in Iraq territory at the end of July. It is unj^al to find the Dahamsha so far south, but one gathers that grazing diffi culties are behind the move. (c) Dhafir - Bani Hussain section are camped in stren^th at Safwan. Ibn Hallaf (Shaikh Abdul Razzak) at Chabda. A1 Samidda (Shaikh Lazzam al Badrah) is reported to be camped at 'Al Sharia' on the south of the Hamar Lake. Al Aslib are reported to be camped at Chuebda.As Suwait (Shaikh Ajenlr) is reported to be camped at TAWIL (Kuwait territory) As Suwait (Shaikh Jadaan) -ditto-at Urn Niga, South 3ast of Safwan in Kuwait territory, Note^ There is also a large camp of mixed Shammn-p (Aslam, Abda, etc.) at Safwan. II. Blockade . The Saudi Govermnent early in July started enforcing their latest Customs Tariff as approved by the King in the Persian Gulf region. This works out from 80$ ad valorem to S0C$ according to the nature of goods. .The unwisdom of this move with unrest in Najd and every where on the increase, ought to have been patent to a child, but the King apparently is determined to take the advice of his amateur financial and customs advisers, such as Abdullah bin Sulaiman and Mohomed al Tawil, etc. The worst feature of these new customs duties is that it taxes out of all reason the peoples food and necessities of life. For instance duty on sugar is now 119$, on rice 40$, and on matches which is as important as actual food to the Najdi and Bedouin, 200$. The Immediate result of these ferocious duties has been to greatly increase the already deep hatred and resentment which certainly all over Kajd and Hassa and North East Arabia is felt for Bin Saud, and which will certainly be taken advantage of by his Northern neighbourso The Bedouin everywhere and openly pray for the day when the King will either die, or will smash himself against Yemen or Asir. Bin Saud does not appear to realise that his people who grow nothing and produce nothing (I refer in particular to the Bedouin tribes) are starving: They will not be able to stand the strain much longer. They must either revolt on a large scale or start fighting each bther to get food. Bin Saud's subsidies which hitherto have, kept the tribes quiet, have either been stopped or been greatly reduced. The secondary result of✓ J* -(3)- of the new duties has been to give great impetus to the contraband trade into Najd from Kuwait. The same I understand applies in the case of Bahrain also# In spite of the activities of Ibn Jaloui*s frontier patrols, ever increasing numbers of Najd tribes men, are secretly finding their way into Kuwait, with the deliberate intention of trying to run rice, sugar, tea and other foodstuffs into the interior. They are desperate men, driven on by the haunting knowledge that their families are on the verge of starvation. These blockade breakers tell me (I often have talks with them), that if they lose four contraband cargoes, either through i capture, or destruction by their own hand, and get av/ay with a fifth caravan, it will still pay them. Such are the high prices that rule in Bin Saud^ dominions® The follov/ing incident which occurred on the 14th July is an example of the desperation to which the Bedouins are being driven, and I fear we have not heard the end of the incident, for Bin Saud's arm is still long, and he seems to delight in revenging himself on his poor subjects these days. Two small caravans numbering 22 and 21 camels respectively, consisting of Braih tribesmen (Mutair) whose main camp is at Hafar al Batin, left Kuwait on the 11th July. By prearrangement they travelled separately their plan being to meet somewhere in the Dahana and then make for Qasim, after getting through the Blockade ring. The first party reached Shaib al Fao 20 miles south west of Hafar when were pursued and challenged by one of Hamud al Bagaawi's patrols. It being dark a fight ensued, and the caravan guards drove off the patrol by rifle fire. There were no casualties, but the contra bandists knowing the patrol would return with reinforce ments and feeling that with their laden camels they could not escape, deliberately unloaded theto mercahndise piledpiled it up in a heap and set it on fire. They them selves scattered and have not been found yet. The second party unfortunately and quite accidently ran into the reinforced patrol, a piece of real bad luck, as they were some 25 miles away from the scene of the first incident. Again a fight took place. This time A1 Sharaafi al Dausiri, the Commander of Bin Saud's men was killed, and also one of Bin Jalou^s 'Murra'-'trackers', who are employed by the Blockade authorities to 'run down' suspected contraband runners. The patrol again beat a retreat and again the merchandise was heaped up and burnt bybthe owners. The contrabandists suffered no loss and dispersed. It sobn became known,however, from spies located in Kuwait that the two parties lelonged to the Braih, and Al Bagaawi was not slow to strike. He seized 200 camels of the tribe, and threatened Bin Saud's vengence, unless the names of the culprits were given him. This has not been done as yet but a Shamari residing with the tribe has been handed over and made a scape goat of. On the 18th July Ibn Ashwan, Ali al Shuwairibat and Ibn Jarbua, all leading Shaikhs of the tribe, decided to go to Riath and lay their case before the King, Ali al Shuwaribat and Ibn Jarbua returned after they reached the Dahana, their hearts failing them, and Ibn Ashwan proceeded alone. Although the incident in our eyes appsars small it is of first class importance among the Mutair. Should Braih get no change out of Bin Saud, and fail,to recover their camels, it is on the cards that they will attempt a mass entry into Iraq via Dulaimiyeh, etc. The above incidents have in no way deterred the many other sportsmen engaged in running the Blockade, and-(5)- and the game goes merrily on. III. Visit of Prominent tribal Personalities to Kuwait. During the month the following Shaikhs visited the Political Agent, (a) Shaaifan Abu Shujara (Ajman) on 12th July 1933, (b) Lafi ibn Maalath (Mutair) on 9th July 1933 # (®) Mutluq as Sur (Mutair) on 25th July 1953. All three are refugees in Iraq and receive allowances froiji King Faisal like Khalid ibn Hathlain (Zeb Sahman), (a) resides with the Dhafir (in Iraq territory) at present (b) ' with Ibn Hathlain and Naif ibn Humaid,etc and more or less accompany the Amarab (Anaze) in their various movements. ( c ) ' on the KinG's personal estates in Baghdad. All three Shaikhs are personal friends of mine, and their movements and news are always a source of interest Lest it be reported in London by Shaikh Hafidh Wahba, Bin Saud f s clever representative there, that the presence of these men in Kuwait, pressages something evil, such as a filibustering expedition Isdnto Najd or Hassa, or a rising of the Ajman, etc., as decently was the cage when Khalid ibn Hathlain visited Kuwait, I give helow a short sketch of the recent doings of each Shaikh. Shaaifan abu Shu.iara . as stated lives with the Dhafir at present. He went north in June to the vici nity of Aleppo to visit his 3 sons who are in the trench Syrian Camel Corps Service (a rather remarkable thing incidentally for members of the Ajman tribe of Hassa to do). His visit to Kuwait was to get a present from the Shaikh (an annual affair n aada Tr ) and to see me and other Ajman relations resifling in this town, and of course to gather news for his present master. When I asked why he did not go back to his tribe, he said beacuse of Bin Saud. To use his own words as nearlyi8vly -(6)- nearly as possible he said that Bin Saud's word was no longer of any value and even If he swore by God and the Koran no Bedouin would ever trust him again, so black was his treachery during the Akhwan rebelllto and after. Bin Jeloul he said was his one friend among the A1 Saud, though a hard and stern man, but even Bin Jaloul would not be able to save him from the King these days. He repeated what the whole Bedo&amp;lnnworld Is apparently saying today, that Bin Saud had got Into the hands of certain non Arabians like FOAD Hamza and Jussuf Yassln who were adventurers pure and tlmple, and that these men had taught the King every deception, deceit and unworthy conduct In dealing with his subjects ana In particular had taught him that It was no sin to break your wora with a Bedouin. He laughingly and amusingly summed up the King's charac ter as his tribe saw It today, In the following words. 'Bin Saud Is the greatest present giver, and most wonderful person In the whole world to win a man's confidence, If It suited him. At the same time, In treachery, cunning, cruelty and revengefulness he had no equal In all the world. Lastly In playing with foreign nations and their representatives, and especially in making the English nation dance to his tune, he was entirely first class, and unmatcha/lble in all the world'. Shaikh Shaalfan leftbKuwalt for the Dhaflr in Irag on the 20th July, (b) Laafi ibn Maalath came to Kuwait to see if his tribe had been able to fix up something with the King whereby he could safely return to Najd. His case is rather a sad one and exemplifies the hard methods of Bin Saud with those who have the misfortune to cross him inno cently. Six months ago Shaikh Laafi, who at one time was one of Bin Saud's most stalwart and trusty warriors, was'1V was camped in the 'Summan' with his family. His brother came into Kuwait to see friends, and on his return was given a bag of rice value Es # 9/-. by Hillal al Mutairi the Pearl Merchant for Shaikh ^aafi. On the journey he was caught by a blockade patrol who confiscated the rice. The patrol who had been told tried for whom the bag of rice was intended next/to arrest Laafi. They arrived at his camp and ordered him to accompany them to Bin Jaloui in Hassa. iiaaf^s own retainers some 27 in number, thought otherwise and quietly told the patrol to depart in peace,ilse they would kill them all. The patrol nothing loath did so and reported events to Hamud al Bagaawi vrtio passed it on to the King. Shaikh Laafi realising that the game was up saddled his camel and all alone sped north and joined the Najd refugees at King Failsal f s Cpurt. His family, goods and all he possessed in the world he left behind. Such are the methods whereby good men are turned into outlaws and refugees in the good Kingdom of Saudiyah. His return would of course mean his undoing. Shaikh Laafi returned to Iraq on the 27th July. ( c ) Mutliq al Sur . Came to Kuwait to get money out of Hilal al Mutairi his protege and incidentally to give him news of his Trans Jordan visit. He had been sent by King Faisal from Baghdad to Amman with the 4 valuable camels which were bought in Kuwait last April (see para VI of Summary No.81 of 26th April 1953) and which the King decided to present to his brother Abdulla. Mutluq t s description of the journey across the desert (he took 25 days), and of the things he saw and heard at Amman were amusing and interesting. He incidentally brought various very cordial messages turn for the Shaikh and myself from Amir Abdulla which might have been true or inventions of the wiljr Mutluq. They werewere all verbal* Quite possibly he also brought a secret letter for the Shaikh from the Amir. Shaikh Mutluq returned to Baghdad on the 28th July. Note. It might not be out of place here to mention for the benefit of those who do not know, that there is little that goes on among the North East tribes of Najd and Hassa which does not come to my ears, I spend many hours weekly talking to Bedouin Shaikhs, both high and l&amp;w, and visiting their tents. Shaikhs, ordinary tribesmen and even the poorest of tribal women know they will find a welcome in my house, and more often than not go away with some small present or other - the ladies usually nth § a bag of rice or dates. Should there be any trouble brewing over the border I should be the first to know about it, for my visitors keep nothing back. As the cold weather approaches I return the compliment and go and camp with my Bedouin friends of all classes and sometimes for days at a time, not as an Englishman but as one of them. IV. Najd, Yemen and Asir News . News from Riath has been obscure and somewhat disturb ing during July, Rumours have been persistent that the King intends with the advent of the autumn to undertake some major operation in the direction of Asir and Yemen. From Bedouin sources it is reported that Bin Saud has again started collecting arms, camels and horses in Riath, and on a considerable scale and has instructed Ibn Jaloui in Hassa to 'tap' the Awazim tribe for camels. The Awazim supplied nothing during the winter and spring campaign of 1952-1933. It is even said that the tribe as a whole has been ordered to hold itself in readiness to send a large quota of its young men to Asir. A ceruain Kuwait merchant writing from Hodeida to the&gt;1 -(9)- the Shaildi on the Stli July said that there were indi cations everywhere , that fighting would commenoe with the cold weather between Bin Saud and the Imam Yahya, he and that/the ynrw+.mir writer had felt it his duty to warn other Kuwait merchants further North to be ready to close down their business at a moment's notice. The same Kuwait subject in a letter written to the Shaikh dated Hodeida the 27th July which arrived by air mail from Karachi gave the following more definite news. (a) Na.iran. Saif al Islam Ahmad with 2,000 Yemen troops recently attempted to enter Saudi territory $o the north west of Najran with the intention of cutting off the steady supply of arms and munitions which were coming to them from Saudi tribes notably the Q,ahtan. The latter had refused to allow the Imam's troops to cross the border without the express orders of Bin Saud. Saif al Islam Ahmad had explained that he would accept all responsibilitybut the Q^ahtan were adamant. The'tribes of Najran, the writer added, were largely in possession of Saudi rifles bearing the King's name, and which had made the Yemen authorities suspicious. (b) Muiadini J The Al Adrisi has sent a fresh and I deputation to Sana'a for what Jizan i purpose was not known. The Jizan authorities (Saudi) were busy repairing the old forts ?7hich are scatter ed over the country and were building many new ones. Work was going on hurriedly and much military activity v/as evident. (c) Some 5,600 men with guns had reached Jizn between 8th and 27th of July. These had been sent down by the Hijaz Governmait by land and sea. (d) Munitions and foodstuffs were being collected in large quantities at Jizan. (e) The Saudi Government was everywhere reported to be supporting the tribes of Najran openly with arms and amrmnition, which had caused deep resentment among the people of Yemen. Heavy fighting was going on there between the Yemen Troops and the Bani Yam tribe (f) The Imam had issued orders for reinforce ments of troops to be sent to the Al Mahmiat country. (g) The stricjftest censorship was being maintained by the Saudi authorities in Asir and all along the coast. The-(10)- j-he Sliaikh of Kuwait while very cautious about giving an opinion is inclined to think that the King possibly intends as soon as the weather turns cold to strike down the Tihama al*Hodeida, while keeping the Yemen armies occupied in the direction of Najran, where Bin Saud seems to have managed to start a aide conflagra tion. This seems rather a far fetched view seeing that a hostile Asir would be left in the army's rear. On the other hand Bin Saud may be tempted to risk a soubhern campaign if only for the sake of diverting the minds of his great tribes from their moody and su sullen hostility to himself. The King knows that there is nothing like a war with promise of loot to remove dissatisfaction. He would do well, however, not to ask his northhrn tribesmen to go as far south as Asir again. They simply would not go. They had such a miserable time when they went last winter, what with disease and privation that nothing short of force will make than, undertake the long drawn Journey again, A curious rumour reached Kuwait on 51st July that Bin Saud had suddenly gone blind in his secbnd eye and that Dr. Dame from Bahrain had not really gone to attend one of his wives but the King himself. Obviously this is a canard spread by those who have no liking for His Majesty. A certain respectable Buraida merchant whose name need not be given arrived in Kuwait at the end of July. Among other things he told the Shaikh that one of the bad Jttatax signs of the times and a thing which was offending the Najd world grievously was the growing immorality that was to be observed at the King's Court. He quoted the following two instances which he swore to be true:- (a)-(ID- ^ (a) That one of the King's sons had misbehaved himself recently with one of his father's own wives. (b) That another son had done the same thing with the King's sister (his aunt). This cheerful personage also told harrowing tales of how with the introduction of motor convoys from Mecca to Riath, and the wiping away of distances, 'Syphilis' had got right among the Central Arabian Bedouins, and was making terrible havoc among them. How far the story is anti-Bin Saud propaganda, I cannot say. There is evidence to show however from the number of cases that come in for treatment that ^ venereal disease is on the increase among the tribes |pW' of Kajd. I have this on the authority of the Mission Hospital doctors. V. OIL, The writer travelled down from Baghdad to Kuwait (on 3rd August) with Major F. Holmes. The latter said that the giving of the Hassa Concession to the Y L 1 Standard Oil Company of California created a serious situation all round. He accused the American Company of having 'double-crossed' his firm the Eastern and ) V* | General Syndicate and the American Mellon group who m ^ were trying to get into Kuwait. He implied that j ; Mr. Lombardi was the chief culprit, •.w He said that Bin Saud had received from the Standard Oil a sum of £35,000/- in gold down, and that the I ^ | latter had promised a large xam loan as soon as oil was found. He gave it as his opinion (but was not certain about this) that Bin Saud had not inifcluded the Kuwait Neutral Zone in the Hassa Concession. He admitted that the object of his going to Jedda in the spring Y /as to warn the King not to include the Neutral Zone in any Concession, as his principals had prior claims and-(12)- and were prepared to approach him the King in that connection. Major Holmes added that as far as he could find out the Standard Oil Company's New Hassa Concession carried a much wider area than the one he had obtained in 1923. It was considerably wider and extended much further south towards Oman.

In *i f In continuation of my Confidential letter No#182 dated the 10th August 1932, I have the honour to forward herewith my Intelligence Summary of Kuwait, Najd and Hinter land news for the month of August, together with 5 spare copies. As the situation in Najd is becoming interesting with the daily talk of an impending war between Sau'diyeh and Yemen, I am sending this report a little earlier than usual, I am sending one copy of this direct to Jedda. I. Tribal Concentration , 1 * Except for the excitement caused among the Northern tribes and in Kuwait, by the frequent reports of an impenfiing war with Yemen, which aloiost daily come in from Riath and Qasim, and which will be discussed below, there have been no material changes in the Sianmer Concentrations on water by the various tribes in North-East Arabia# An exception to this has been as under:- Bhafir# Ajemi as Suwait who at the end of July was camped at TAWIL in the southern portion of Kuwait territory, received ordersk t - (2) - orders from Ibn Jaloui to move out of Kuwait, so that, Zikat could be taken from him by the Saudi Tax gatherers# He accordingly moved on the 8th August south to the wells of Maragha in the Kuwait Neutral Zone with some 40 tents and there paid Zikat to ibn Mansur who met him. Jadaan al Suwait the leading Shaikh of the Dhafir who has been peacefully camped all the summer near Safwan in the North of Kuwait State appears to have also received a similar warning from ibn Jaloui as he also suddenly moved South with some of his people and joined Ajemi at Maragha and like the latter was also 'zakied^. After paying their Zikat Ajemi is repprted to have gone to Riath to complain at his treatment, while Jadaan returned with Ajemis and his own people and camped at the wells of Subaihiyeh, 10 miles inside Kuwait territory # Note (a) Maragha lies east of Shathaf in the Neutral Zibne and is a little to the south of the Huzaim region. Note (b) , Tftiile it was rather to be expected that Ajemi would be called upon to pay the annual tax to Bin Saud, seeing that for several years he has thrown in his lot with the King, the move south of Jadaan and his compla cently paying Zikat to ibn Mansur is rather surprising, for as far as one is aware, he still is an Iraq subject, and owes allegiance to that State. Unfortunately Jadaan was always a person who liked to I V play hide and seek with both Iraq and Bin Saud, and as I told him last year, such tactics would eventually lead him into trouble, for they would deceive no^one. II. BLOCKADE . (a) On page 4 of my Summary for July and 3rd paragraph, I stated that Ibn Ashwan alone proceeded to Riath to explain the case of the killing of the King's Officer Al Sharaafi al Dausiri in the fight between the caravan convoy and the Blockade Patrol on the 14th July. It appears from later evidence that Ali al Shuwairibat and Ibn-(3)- Ibn &lt;Jarbua did not turn back as reported, but went with Ibn Ash wan to see the King* Ik 1 ' (b) I mentioned in the last para but dne (page 4) of Note II on the Blockade, (July Summary) that the shooting of al Sharaafi was of first class importance in the eyes of the Mutair, and might easily result in the moving en masse of the Braih tribe into Iraq if a flase step were made f Apparently the King's Blockade Officer al Bagaawi and the King himself thought likewise, as may be seen from the following sequel to the incident# Ibn J'aloui on hearing the news of the contra band affair and the resulting engagement, at once sent a party of 36 men under Fulaiyih al Attaibi to reinforce Al Bagaawits Blockade Contingent, with orders that Al Bagaawi should punish the Braih without delay, Al Bagaawi refused to carry out the orders, onliie plea that the Braih were excited and in a bad mood and any undue pressure would send them hot foot over the frontier into Iraq. Hamud al Bagaawi wrote to Ibn ^ i Jaloui and explained his reasons for not taking action and put the matter clearljr before him. Bin Jaloui agreed that he Al Bagaawi need not accompany the punitive expe dition but ordered that Fulaiyih the Attaibi should act alone. The latter accordingly moved to Hafar, but before reaching that place, he received peremptory orders from Al Shuwaish the King's Official in Charge ^ of the Royal Camel Herds at Hafar al Atz to hold his hand; this was followed immediately by a letter from Bin oaud himself ordering no action T , as Ibn Ashwan, jA.li al Shuwairibat ano. Ibn Jarbuh, the Braih leading Shaikhs, were in Riath and had explained everytiiing satisfactorily# Comment. From the above it is clear that the King thought the time inopportune for punishing the Braih, as this would upset the Mujrair generally, just when he was about to launch a campaign in the South. The BedouinitlsS j. /r 4 | Jr f -(4)- Bedouin world round about Kuwait have certainly inter preted the incident in this way. (c) S large number of Shammar tribesmen operating in eights and tens came up to Kuwait from the Iraq Neutral Zone (Dulaimiyeh,etc) between the 12th and 20th August and bought up considerable supplies. Clearly this was for contraband purposes into Najd, and indicated a general relaxation of authority (perhaps of set purpose) on the frontier, west of Hafar al Batin and on the routes leading from the Neutral Sone to Qasim. The men wwre from the Abda and Asi am sections and their operations seemed to indicate an attempt on the part of Bin Baud's officials to keep these northern border tribes in good humour by winking the official eye at their contraband operations. III. Collection of Zikat . (a) The taking of this annual camel and sheep tax by Bin Jaloui from the Hassa tribes including the Mutair, was as usual entrusted to Abdullah al Mansur. (b) During July this official slowly moved north and took the tax from the Ajman, Bani Hajir, Bani Khalid and other tribes of Hassa. (c) Early in August he arrived at Ark in the Kuwait Neutral Zone, and 'Zakied' the Awazim who were onmped on the Wafra and Ark wells. (d) On the 18th August he proceeded to Hafar al Batin and collected the tax from the Braih section of Mutair while a second party of his collected the tax from Mutair Ilwa, camped over the Summan region. (e) The collection of this tax as far as Hassa and the Summan tribes were concerned was carried out tactfully and without any trouble. (f) The taking of Zikat by Abdullah al Mansur fromm Ajemi al Suwait and Jadaan al Suwait, heads of the Dhafir (an Iraq tribe) has been desctibed in para I above.-(5)~ above. Shaikh Hantush al Suwait, who is camped near Safwan (north Kuwait) apparently refused to go South and pay the tax, and according to his statement made to me on the 19th August, he had retained in his hand the major portion of the Dhafir and prevented them accompanying Jaddan. None of the Al Samidda nor the Bani Hussain, both sections of the Dhafir camped on the Hamar Lake and Sagwan respectively made any attempt to pay Zikat to Bin Saud nor as far as I know have any of the other sections of the Dhafir further West done so, (g) The Shaikh of Kuwait completed the taking of Zakit from his own tribal people al Jahara, Tawil, Subaihiyeh and Wara before the 15th August„ IY. Anti Assyrian Pamphlets &gt; (a) On the 14th August, anti-Assyrian pamphlets appeared in the Kuwait bazaars which obviously emanated from Iraq, These pamphlets were anti-English in character, and accused His Majesty's Government of stirring up the Assyrians to defy the Iraq Government, and generally behave as they had done, with the object of maintaining a sort of behind the scenes control over Iraq. Part of the pamphlet was also in the nature of anti-Christian propaganda, and clearly was intended to inflame the minds of Moslems against Christians. The Assyrians were n made out to have tortured, maimed and cut of sundry limbs of wounded Iraq soldiers, (b) The pamphlet was I believe widely read but had little effect on the stolid Kuwaiti who with his long contact with India, can be trusted tg&gt; size up a situation sensibly and calmly. (c) There was a mysterious withdrawal of the offending sheets almost as soon as they came out and I suspected the Shaikh's hand in this, although I made no mention of the matter to him, (d)i* -.e)- 3) (d) The Shaikh with his well known pro-British sympathies oan always be counted to act vigorously and sensibly in such matters and controls his people well, where such effusions are concerned# Y. Riath News and War Rumour s, (a) Throughout August there have been continuous rumours of impending operations on the part of Bin Saud in the direction of Nejran or Asir. (See also para IV of my summary for July). Most of these have been brought in by tribesmen, and must of course be taken at their proper worth # From the mass of evidence that has come to hand, one thing stands out fairly clearly. It is that the tribes every where especially in the North have no stomach at all for such distant operations as Nejran and Asir, andwill largely refuse to obey any call to arms, where they think they can safely do so^ This especially applies to the great tribe of Ataiba, and to the Mutair, Ajman and Awazim in the North East. It is also clear that there have already been many such calls, but only refusals and excuses have resulted. The Braih and Bani Abdulla (Mutair) and the Ataiba generally suffered greatly in the Asir operations of last year, and it will take more than the King* s silver tongue to persuade them 'to follow his standrad in any distant operation. The Ajrnan tribe might be persuaded to send large contingents to Nejran as both they and the Murra are related to the Beni Yam tribe, and will always go to their help. Against this is the Amman's permanent distrust of Bin Sa&amp;d, and the hope they have that operations in the far South will be the downfall of their 'Great King'. (b) The following news was given to the writer by an important Shaikh of the Mutair, who arrived in Kuwait from Riath on the 10th August. He is one of the most 'Loyal' of Bin Saud's Shaikhs, and as his having met me and imparted the information would get him into trouble jsnhvOTRT* wHF-y-r v-(7)- trouble at once I prefer tiie.p^'fore to keep Ms name dark # (i) There had been a little trouble at Tabuk, and the local Amir had asked Bin Saud for reinforce ments or to accept his resignation. The infor mant did not know the nature of the trouble, but believed that the G-overno^s resignation had been accepted, and another Governor appointed# Asir t There were 26 forts garrisoned by Sau T di troops, built or nearing completion in Asir. Ten of these had garrsons of 100 men each and 16 had only 50 men each# Turki al Sudairi, new Governor of Sbha had asked for 800 men to bring up the strength of the 16 forts to 100 men each. The King through Amir Faisal had agreed and ordered ^abtan to supply 250 men, Ataiba 200, Total 450 - the balance of 350 being provided from Town Le^vies. All had been sent to Sbha and onwards in lorries etc. (iii) No operations were contemplated in the direc tion of Asir as far as the informant knew. (iv) Hamad bin Shuwaiyir had been appointed Governor of Jizan and Sabiya under Ebha 1 s jurisdiction. The whole Wadi al Nejran was in the hands of Yemen troops except the town of Badr, but as the King was maintaining a close censorship he the informer could give no further news. | (vi) Hassa. Bin Saud had forbidden the export of dates from Hassa and Qatif. (vii) All Najd tribal Shaikhs who had been forbidden ' to come to Riath till the end of August, had been ordered to attend by the 15th August. (viii) Except for temporary^excitement in Mutair country over the caravan incident and the killing of Bin Saud^ official, and the taking of Zikat everywhere, things were quiet in Hassa and in the Mutair country. (ix) He the informant had heard after leaving Riath that Bin Saud had ordered Naif bin Hathlain, Ibn Humaid, and Ibn Lamir to be sent to Hoffuf. This at Ibn Jaloui's request. He did not how- ^ ever believe the news to be true. Comment. It should not be forgotten that the informant is a staunch pro Bin Saud supporter. Hence his guarded '4 r information. (c) The following news was supplied to me by the Shaikh of ii.uwait on the 16th August. It came from AJman sources to L, Napfar al Mutalaqim a chieftain in Kuwait employ and was confirmed from Mutair sources in Artawiyeh. (i) Phe rijWs that the Riath prisoners had been sent to Hoffuf was untrue.-(8)- (ii) Bin Saud had sent one Saaiyid ibn to Nejran to tell the Beni Yam to stiffen their resistance till he should send help to thenu The latter had sent reply that without a large army from Bin Saud the end was in sight, as Yemen was a great kingdom and had sent a great army to fight theiru (iii) Bin Saud had ordered Bin Jaloui to mobilise the Murra and southern Ajman tribes prepa ratory to being sent to Wadi Nejran - Commander to be Saud son of Ibn Jaloui* (iv) Awazim JJad been ordered to prepare to folio?/ this force, but they had excused themselves on the grounds that three fourths of thetr men were at sea pearl divl ng, Mutair . Ibn Shuqair had been ordered to send 200 men from the Summan area to Pdatiu These had not gone yet, and their chief was making excuses* Ibn Musaiyis had been ordered to send 1000 men from Artawiyeh district, but had replied that he could only muster 200• Ataiba . Ibn Rabaian had been ordered to to send a force (numbers not known) but had excused himself saying his tribe had suffer ed too many losses in the Asir operations of last year# (d) The following further news was supplied by the Shaikh of Kuwait on the 20th August 1935# (i) The Imam Yahya had broken off negotiations with Bin Saud and was holding as hostages Bin Saud * s 'Wafds^. (ii) Badr in Nejran had fallen to the Yemen forces* (iii) Bin Saud had sent a force of 2000 men down the Wadi Duwasir to assist Nejra^but these had been recalled when 5 marches out* (iv) There was general unrest among northern tribes especially Ataiba. Ibn Rabaiian had been sent for but had refused to come. Mashari ibn Musaiyis (Mutair) and A1 Firm (Harb) had gone to try and persuade him to see reason. It appears that Ibn Rabaiian had deserted from Asir last year with his force, and since then had been afBdd to come near the King* Note . Later news said that he had set out to see Bin Saud, after having sent presents of horses to appease him* (v) Ibn Jaloui had sent 26 'Raiyehs' of camels to Riath (approximately 800) A1 Shuwaish had himself taken 18 'Raiyehs^ of Royal camels and repaired to Riath (approximately 600) (vii) War dancing and 'Arthas' Horse Parades with much firing and galloping were the order in Riath, and Bin Saud was trying his best toto rouse liis people to some form of enthusia sm for war, but with little success. The Shaikh of Kuwait's views were that Bin Saud would like to fight Yemen if he could ; but that ovdlng to wide spread discontent and unrest among his tribes especially those along his northern frontiers, he dare not risk a campaign. That Bin Saud by his stupid policy of the last 5 years, had thoroughly estranged the Mutair, Ajman and Ataiba (he especially referred to the long imprisonment of their chieftains in Riath). That! the prevention of his starving North-Sastern tribes from buying supplies from Kuwait, had long ago turned what loyalty they originally felt for the King into bitter hatred: that King Faisal and the Amir Abdullah in the last two years had not been slow to take advantage of the estrangement of these northern tribes and had got them more or less to promise to revolt, by means of Agents and / spies who had long been sowing the seeds of disloyalty among them, should Bin Saud get entangled in distant operations to the South. That it was significant that several great chieftains from Najd, notably Naif ibn Humaid (Ataiba) Khalid bin Hathlain 5 A1 Damir { Ajman I Ibn Uthain 1 Laafi ibn Muallath \ Mutluq as Sur 1 Mutair were all on King Ixjdbs Faisal's side and in receipt of subsidies. These men were never idle. VI. GSNSRAL . (a) Shaikh Hautush as Suwait (Dha^ir) called on me on the 19th August 1932, and presented me with a riding camel which was returned. He had been to see Captain Glubb at A1 Asraq and brought back interesting news from those parts. He was given a suitable present and sent to his people near Safwan,(10)- (b) Mansur al Saud (Ajman) in the service of King Faisal and till 5 months ago (according to him) working under Captain Glubb in Transjordania arrived in Kuwait on the 24th August 1933 and called on me f He insisted that he had come to marry a wife and return to his chief Ibn Hathlain, Doubtless he was sent to spy out the land, and bring news of Bin Saud's contemplated 'War', I gave him an 'Abbah tf as present and sent him away. (c) Anaizan ibn Munaikhir , who came to Kuwait with Ibn Hathlain, and remained behind at Jahara to marry a wife (the divorced/lady of the Shaikh of^Cuwait) is still honey mooning at Jahraa, He is a nice boy, and though his father is high in Bin Saud's favour in Riath, he the son dare not return to Najd. Another instance of the Bedouin keeping a foot in both camps, no doubt.

(b) The King would appear to have purposely left his great tribes 'guessing' as to his real intentions and ul-r timate objective, for even now no one really can say where he intends to attack, though the most commonly accepted sdjory is that it will be Mejran,if indeed he takes up the Imam Yahya's challenge at all, as many doubt, ( (c) Certain it is that the great tribes who have no stomach at all for operations to the distant south and have been making every effort to get out of supplying contingents | as they were ordered to do, have during September and after i many/ i- 2 - many meetings came to the conclusion tliat it were better to obey the King's and Ibn Jalaoui t s orders than to hang back and risk the King's displeasure and punishment 0 (d ) Their line of argument has been typical and curious to follow and has taken the following line:- n Either (i) the King intended to fall upon and punish some big tribe like Ataiba which haa not been too loyal during the last year, or (ii) he desired to make a test mobilization of his forces to find out who were really loyal among subjects, or (iii) he planned to go to the assistance of Nejran which had been overrun by the Imam Yahya's armies' They saw money and loot in (i) and (ii) and disaster in (iii) It were better, however to risk disaster than the King's anger, for his arm was long and he never forgot• So con tingents must be sent» (e)In other words a mixture of curiosity, cupidity and fear decided them to obey the call to n ghazzi tT and send their contingents, to the places of concentration decided upon* (f) These have been fixed as follows:- (a) A1 Juda and Nejbiyeh (45 miles N»W of Hofuf) for the Hassa tribes including Mutair (Ilwa and Wasil). (b) Riath and Khar.1 district (30 miles S»E. of Hiath) for the Qassim, Arid .la sham town con tingents, as well as the tribal groups of Harb, Sbei, Sahool Mutair (3ani Abdilla) and others. (g) The 11th September (al Nus) was, as far as one can gather, fixed upon as the date when all contingents should be ready concentrated at the above two rendezvous. The 26th September (New Moon) was given out by the King as the date on irhich his armies would march. (h) The following Hassa tribes have definitely been ascertained'' l&amp;J uo - 3 - ascertained to have sent oontingents to A1 Juda and Hejbiyeli inspite of having, throughout August, tried their utmost to get out of doing so, on one excuse or another* In -©very case almost, contingents were not up to the strength demanded l t Awazim, 2. Ajman, Mutair,(Ilwa and /asil)• 4 »Bani Ehalid, 5* Bani Hajir, 6• Manasir, 7» Murra. (i) Of the above the Awazim and I^Aitair were those who tried hardest and longest to avoid obeying the King's orders• (j) In every case non-combatants etc., have remained camped on the various wells where they have been throughout the summer except the Awazim who show a tendency to close up to and concentrate in the Kuwait Neutral Zone* Ck) DHAITEt. 14 In paragraph I of Kuwait Suimnary No •EOS of 26 th August, I mentioned that Ajemi as-Suwait was reported to havep gone to Riath to see the King, and that Jadaan as-Su?/ait after being Tt zakied n returned from Maragha and camped at m: Subaihiyeh. Actually (a) Ajemi ©s-Suwait left for Riath on 19th September and is still there; (b) Jadaan as-Suwait left for Riath on 4th September with his nephew llirwi al Suwait and was seen there as late as 15th Sep- tember. b f Before he left Jadaan moved his camp (-f dozen tents only) to Tawil and joined up with Ajemi 1 s people* | IiAKTUSH AS-SU^AIT % was reported on the loth September to have moved North West into 'Iraq from Um Niga (Kuwait territory) because of the contraband activities of some of his people, which he feared would get him into trouble with | the Iraq/ii./ the 'Iraq authorities* ( 1) ATAIBA. This great tribe appears definitely to haire been excused from furnishing any war contingent probably because Bin Saud felt it would be unwise to try and compel it to do so. Ibn Rabaiyan, their leader, after holding out for a considerable period against the King's order to go to Riath and see him, eventually was persuaded to repair to the capital through^ he Agency of certain friendly Shaikhs* fcJK.C'.MjX, I He took care to send 11 mares asjsed of him to appease the jF | wrath of the King as well as three ladies of his family to act hs spokesmen for him. The King to his surprise, no doubt, received him well, loaded him with presents and informed him that both he and his Ataiba, as well as others who had taken part in the Asir operations last year need not j provide any war contingents for his coming campaign. See paragraph V(dl v iv of Summary for August. ( m) HARB. ^ L A1 Firm, the paramount Shaikh of this tribe, after having assisted in bringing the sulking Ibn Rabaiyan of the Ataiba to his senses and persuading him to go to Riath, Yfhen he appeared likely to refuse to do so, himself started giving trouble. He pleaded by letter, that it was neces sary to guard the Northern marches of Saudiyeh for the King, and that he was too old a man to be asked to go and. ^ fight Nejran or Asir way. The King was firm and replied that his day of need had come, when every loyal man must stand by him. He insisted on his sending the necessary f war contingent, seeing that his tribe had not gone to Asir in 1952. As regards guarding his northern frontier, the King explained k that Ibn Muspod of Hail was quite capable of doing this and had been allotted the task. The tribe has complied with the King's call.(iv)/ II.RIATH K^V/S AIslD xiULIOURS ♦ n (a) These have been so may and frequent throughout September, that I have decided to give a summary of the news as given me by the more reliable of my informants, rather than attempt, in any way to sift the immense volume of rumour and gossip, that has come in almost daily from Riath, Qassim and Bedouin sources. (b) The following was supplied by His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait on 6th September 1933: (i) Kuwait bazaar rumour had it that Bin Saud had ordered 50,000 bags of rice from India to go direct to Has Tanura near Qatif, and tenders were already being asked for from dhow owners for the transportation of this _ —-consignment from Ras Tanura to Ojair. Rs*25/- per 100 bags had already been offered. QOMivISHTS. No doubt the Political Agent, Bahrain is in possession of the correct facts, (ii) He confirmed the news that the export of dates from Hassa had been forbidden by the King. (iii) The 2000 men sent by Ibn Saud down the Tadi Dawasir in August which he (the Shaikh)had said, had been recalled, had merely been ordered to hold fast, they had not been withdrawn. (See para Y(d)(iii) of my August Summary)«, (c) The following news was supplied on 10th Septem ber by a minor Shaikh of the Mahfuth section of the Ajman, who resides in Kuwait territoiy. He had left Hiath on 24th August. (i) The Hassa tribes were concentrating their fighting forces in the A1 Juda area at Nejbiyeh under the direction of Ibn Jaloui. Both places were north west of Hoffuf and water and grazing were plentiful. (ii) The force so collected was to be under the command of Saud, Ibn Jaloui's son. (iii) The place for the concentration had been selected for its proximity to Hoffuf, whence dates, rice and supplies generally could be easily transported to them.~ 6 - ifip} I Riath gossip was that Nejran was to be the ICing's objective. He had heard the King in open Mejliss say that Yemen forces had overrun the whole of Nejran and were in complete occu pation of the valley. Several Nejran Shaikhs had arrived at Bin Sauds court, notably Ibn liana, to beg for help against the Imam Yahya. He had heard in Hiath that Ibn Rabaiyan (Ataiba) , A1 Firm (Harb) and Mashari ibn Musaiyis (Mutair) were all trying to get out of sending war contingents to the capi tal, and that the King was anxious lest thejX chiefs should suddenly defy him, and make his task of mobilization difficult. He had returned from Riath via Hoffuf and the coast, and ^ saw contingents of Ajman Bani Hajir, and Awazim every?7here moving south to Al Juda. He noticed that Awazim non-combatants with women and children were moving into the Kuwait neutral Zone. These, he thought, were planning to come up to Kuwait for sup- i' plies, taking advantage of the partial disorganization that had occurred in the Blockade arrangements as a result of war rumours. (d) The following was given me by a reliable Shaikh f of the Jiblan section of the Mutair on 15th September:- (i) Faisal bin Aun of Medina had sent to Riath SO herds (Assas) of 30 camels each. (ii) Faisal bin Sulaiman of Taif had sent to Riath 15 Assas of 50 camels each. (iii) He confirmed story that ibn Rabaiyan had arrived at Riath with eleven mares and two ladies, and that the King had forgiven him publicly for having refused to attend when first summoned and had further excused I Ataiba from sending a war contingent. * (iv) Al Firm, Shaikh of Harb had written in to say that he was prepared to go and fight to wards the north, east or west, but could k not go south as he was no longer a young '{ man, but that the King had refused to excusef him. (v) Ibn Musaad, G-overnoB of Hail, had been in formed by the King that Hail and Shammar need not supply any contingents. Their role was to watch the north and west.

He reached xOiwait on 24th September from Riath after visiting Buraida, Anaiza, Zilfi, Majmaa, Artawiyeh. (a) All towns of passim including all 'hayars' i»e # Akhwan settlements, had sent their contingents; to Riath* (b) All persons who had gone on 'ghazzu' to Asir 1 last year were by Hoyal decree excused this year# (c) Among those excused were Ibn Musaad, Gover nor of Hail, Ibn Rabaiyan and whole of Ataiba, and Mashari ibmMusaiyis, Shaikh of Artawlyetu (d) A1 Mutair (Ilwa and Wasil) including the following well known Shaikhs: Ibn Shuqair, al Fuqum, Ibn Lanir, Ibn Shiblan, Ibn Jarbuh, Ibn Shuwairibat and Ibn Ashwan, had after much waver ing moved to Al Juda y /ith their respective fight ing men # (e) Al Harb had also marched inspite of many lamentations on the part of their chief, Al ITiriu (f) The Al Juda force was under orders of Ibn Jaloui's son, while the Riath concentration was under orders of Saud bin Abdul Aziz» (g) The King had intimated that he would himself i 1 take supreme command. (h) The King 1 s objective was definitely now Nejran. not xisir, and the route would be via f Solaiyil Dam, Bisha and Tathlittu (i) The Imam Yahya had sent a formal declaration of war 'Rad al Niga' to Bin Saud saying, 'Beware, my son, Saif al Islam is proceeding to invade your country'. Bin Saud is said to have replied ?/ith the laconic message. 'He is welcome, I have also a son, who will me ex: him, and give him his deserts'. (f)i # On 27th September His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuvfait informed me that one of his trusty Ajman I messengers had just returned from Riath (25.9.33). He had actually dined with ibn Mana, Shaikh of the Nejran tribes (Yam) , who was a refugee with Bin Saud. Ibn Mana m had told him that he had recently sent back to Nejran 4 of his men by the King*s orders to bring news of the strength of the Yemen forces. That they had been captured and made to confess their errand; upon which Saif al Islam i had ordered them to be taken round and shown everything possible, and then sent back to Bin Saud to tell the latter what/8 - what they had seen. (ii) The same informant brought the report that the King had given out that he would hi: iself shortly motor down to A1 Juda and inspect the force concentrated there♦ (iii) The Shaikh opined that Bin Saud would not go to war even yet, as such would be too dangerous for hinu All the talk of war etc» etc» was so much bluff he thought , and the King would leave himself a loophole as a^face saver'. CCMIIEKT. I am inclined to agree with thisfview. I III» BLOCKADE. (a) Nothing of importance to report under this head. (b) Apparently as a result of the caravan incident near Hafar al Batin of 14th July, where A1 Sharaafi al Dausiri, Bin Sand's official was killed by blockade run ners, (see para II of my Summary for July last, N0.I8E, dated 10th August), news reached the King early in September that 16 small convoys had got through to Anaiza, from Kuwait L f He occordingly sent an armed party from Hiath to demand . of Ibn Sulain, the headman of Anaiza, the actual 16 caravans. The story was of course denied whereupon the King ordered the arrest of 16 leading citizens, who were later made to pay a fine of Rials 200 each. The story has not been con firmed, so it must be taken for what it is worth. IY. OIL. % (a) On one or two occasions lately His Excellency when discussing the Hassa Oil Concession recently given to the Standard Oil Company, has been strangely definite in his assertion that the King had not included the Kuwait Neutral Zone in the concession. (b) In referring to the Shaikh of Qatar's visit to Riath on S5th August, the Shaikh gave it as his opinion that the Shaikh of Qatar, who was under the thumb of Bin Saud, might easily be persuaded to try and cancel his- 9 - his agreement with the Anglo Persian Oil Company, at the behest of the King» He further gave it as his opinion that actually the journey to Hiath was not connected with Oil, hut with the loan of £10,000, which the Shaikh of Qatar had made to Bin Saud sometime back- He had heard that the Shaikh of Qatar had stupidly reminded the King about repayment and this had greatly angered that monarch® Abdulla ibn Jaloui, his friend, had then secretly instructed the Shaikh of Qatar to come and make his peace , promising hi aself to act as go-between- Cui^xvi' » No doubt the Political Agent, Bahrain has full details of the matter- &amp; T-D^IDI: IIICIDJI::- VISIT CF BRITISH JLOTILI^.

(a) The news that His Majesty's Government had decided to make a Naval demonstration in the Gulf was received with the greatest rejoicing and relief not only in Kuwait but, I am told, in Basra, and all down the Arab Goast- (b) Every one at once appreciated that the Bassidu incident was the cause, and great has been the gossip since. (c) While some regret was expressed to the writer, by both Shaikh and leading citizens of Kuwait that His Majesty's Government had not insisted on (i) the dismissal of the Persian Captain who had hauled dpwn the British flag (ii) the formal hoisting again of the Union jack by the Persians in presence of Persian and British Naval guards of honour- The general attitude of His Majesty's Government has been most favourably commented on- (d) The hope is now generally expressed that the10 - that the flotilla will not be withdrawn too soon, and that once for all the Persian Navy will be given to understand that it must behave itself (especially in the matter of searching dhows on the high seas) as decent and sensible nations behave.

Nor do the wonderful stories of the arma- msnts possessed by the Imam Tahya tend to encourage the northern Bedouin. What every one dreads aboTe everything, according to my Bedouin informants, are the Temen army's ^chickens' (DajaJ), which come 'running along the ground, bouncing and jumping and then explode when tha,reach their objective'. These 'chidcens' were, it is said, used with deadly effect on the ram tribe of Nejran and the tales that are told of these infernal machines have caused widespread despondency and alarm. (CCMME NT. Obviously Mills Bombs, or something similar). Already the news is filtering through to Kuwait of many secret desertions from the Army as it moved down the Wadi Duwasir. So great is the unpopularity of the King's impending war tJiat in the view of many experienced tribal leaders. Bin Saud will be very ill advised if he risks a pitched battle Willi the Yemen forces anywhere. The idea being that his army will melt away like chaff before wind, if fortune in any way goes against it. The Shaikh of Kuwat as well as the writer, for the above and other obvious reasons, more than ever, hold the view that the King, who must be given full credit of knowing what his people are thinking about, and how unpopular is his little war, has no intention of fighting, let alone invading Yemen; and that the whole business of mobilizing and sending a large force to Asir, is a manoeuvre pure and simple to make the Imam Yahya believe that the Kingdom of 'Saudiyeh' is in earnest and intends mischfef. At the last moment, no doubt, the King will ask the Imam Yahya to agree to some simple and very easy solution of the difficulties that exist. Honour/ „ ■ \ 15)3 Honour will be declared to have been satisfied, and Bin Saud will gire out to his people that he has forced Yemen to coiae to terms and will march home a conqueror♦ No doubt there will be a eertain amount of petty skirmishing, but not, it is belieTed, a big battle. The Shaikh of Kuwaiti appreciation at the situa tion given to the writer on 19th October 1935, is quoted below in as far as possible his own words. It is interesting and shows considerable shrewdness. (i) Tahya always was and is like a hedgehog (gunfith). He can kill and eat mot danger ous things as poisonous snakes and scorpions if he finds them alone, but if supported by a bigger animal or a*man*, he will roll into a ball and act on the defensive, showing only a tt spiky w and awkward front: (iij Bin Saud on the other hand is like the proverbial wolf (dhib). It will only attack sheep nihen results are certain, but if it sees that object of its greed is well defended (by good watchidogs) and ready to attack back, he will snarl, make a great fuss, and pretend to be ready to fight, but will mowt assuredly give ground and eventually bolt always pro vided the dogs are bold and rush in. (iii) Bin Saud for the moment far from wanting to fight Yemen, fears an invasion of Asir, he will definitely try and defend that country if he feels he can successfully do so, but if he feels he cannot, he will make peace at once, and on any terms. (iv) No general war with Yemen will take place^ Peace talks are already going on be— •••&gt;-' - Mad the scenes for both wolf and hedgehogyv » 4 •• hedgehog knew how to play the game of to perfection# (b) AJMA.N MUTAIR * AWAZIM Tribes# HARB ATTAIBA !' Nothing to report, but see notes under para II ^Riath and War Rumour s** (o) DHAFIR. Jada^an as Suwait is reported to have returned from Riath (E4#10#33.) but this has yet to be confirmed# (See para I(fc) of last Summary for September)# On S5th iJ. / October the rather disquieting news readied the writer from a personal friend and reliable person just back from Riath that Bin Saud in dismissing Jada^n allotted him the task of assisting his frontier officials in the Blockade of Kuwait by preventing persons going in or out of the Town# Jada^an was once given this secret task before in 1931, and steps were thai taken to get the ^raq Government to recall him together with his followers to , Iraq# At present Jada f an is camped in Kuwait territory, 30 miles south of the Town at Tawil wells, but will shortly move into the ,t Gara t a ,t region (Saudi territory) west of the Shaqq depression# Even then he will probably continue to send his camels to Tawil and Subaihiyeh to drink# Both the Shaikh of Kuwait and the writer are watching this sportsman t s activities carefully# HANTUSH AS SUWAIT was recently wrongly reported by the writer to have moved north into •Iraq (See para I{k) of Summary for September)# It Jiappears that he moved south instead and camped in the unfrequented region knom as ALBAHRA on the north side of the Bey of Kuwait. He re mained there till about SOth October more or less hiddenh-idden since when he has been gradually edging west to the Kraa al Mara ridge west of the Jahara - Safwan - Basra road where grazing is reported good. With him are the Bani Hussain seotion of the Dhafir who throughout the Summer were camped at Safwan ('Iraq) and who hare made themselves rather notorious orer their -smuggling'' activities lately. (d) iJMAZB, During October a few snail parties both from the Amwyot and Dahamsha visited Kuwait and bought up supplies, which they said they were going to take to Syria - a rather tall story in the opinion of the writer. rt (e) RAINS, With the advent of the rainy season, tribal concentrations on wells are erery^ere breaking up and tribes are generally moving off to winter grazing grounds• TT JRIAT5 NEWS AND WAR RUMOURS &gt; 1 # During October news from Riath has come in more regularly, and wilfc. greater frequency than before, and in spite of the King*s very strict censorship the veil may be said to have largely lifted from happenings at the Capital#, 2^ On 10th October a Ford car belonging to the King arrived at Kuwait from Riath, me driver having in structions to convey some ladies (who had cane from Zubair) &gt; back to Riath# The driver who is well know in the Town brou^tit the following information, which has since been | amply confirmed from several other sources: (a) The final concentration of Bin Jaloul 1 s force and the Riath force | took place early in October, and the combined army proceeded south in sue- ! cessive echelons via the DawasirDawasir valley, from the 5tli October to the 7th 6f October* (b) The total strength of the concentra^ tion was some 9,000 fi^iting: men, (4,000 from Hassa and 5,000 from the Riath district)« (o) The combined force which moved from Riath was under the nominal command of Faisal bin Sa t ad, the King^ nephew, a not particularly striking youngman of about %% years of age - known to the writer# (d) The King t s orders to Faisal bin Sa^d j were that he should proceed to Bisha and Raniya at the soutlaem end of the Wadi Dawasir, where he would meet the King t s second son Faisal, Yiceroy of the Hejaz, who would take over the supreme l command from him# (e) Up to the time when the Army moved off no one knew Mi ether from Bisha the destination of the force would be Najran via Tathlith eto / or Ebha# (f) The Riath force before it marched suffered greatly from sickness due, it ^ was said, to dirt and lack of the most elementary sanitary precautions on the part of the King' s Government • The various large Bedouin contingents, which had arrived daily throughout the month of , September, and had greatly congested the already overcrowded capital, had obviously contaminated the water supply, with the result reported# COMMEOT •GOMMMT » From the symptoms reported jue, a 31 day-sickness, the probabilities are tbat the outbreak was of an enteric nature# (g) Many secret desertions took place before the force moved off# (h) The Imam Yahya was reported to have written to the King in September and beg ged him not to go to war in T»hich many Muslims would unnecessarily perish# He, the Imam, was ready to fall in with all thi King's wishes, but his difficulty lay in the fact that his son Saif ul Islam Ahmad had got out of hand# Bin Saud replied in similar vein 'fiiat he too was averse to war, but that he had four hot-headed sons none of idiom oould he control# These were marching on Yemen against his (Bin Saud's) will# (3) The following news was supplied by the Shaikh of Kuwait on 19th October; (a) On the 18th October an Ajman tribesman in Kuwait service arrived from Riath confirmiag the motor drivers report in detail# (b) The man also brou^it the news that it was pretty certain that the now famous Riath prisoners Naif bin Hithlain Ibn LamL^ and Ibn Humaid % had been murdered by Bin Saud r s orders# They had apparently been sent in 3 lorries osten sibly to Hoffuf, in response to the long made demand of Ibn Jaloui, that the prisoners should be dealt with by him. The lorries had, it seems, never reached Hoffuf, but returned empty to Riath the next day# It was everywhere in Riath whispered that the prisoners had been diot and burled in the Dahana sands by a party sent by Ibn Jaloui to take them over# In this connection see para V»b # (ix) and V#c # (i) ofof this office SunmLary for August 1933# COMMBICT* The story of the murder of these unfortunate wretches has reached Kuwait from so many sources during September and October that I cannot but come to the regret ful conclusion that the incident is true» The Ajman and Mutair tribes hoping against hope that Ibn Hath la in and Ibn Laod^, their chieftains were still alive, have refused so far to believe that Ibn Saud would lend himself to such a dastardly deed, but even they have resigned themselves to what they believe to be the truth at last#. It is said that no one but members of Bin Saud^ slave bodyguard accompanied the prisoners when they set out in the lorriesi and that even the lorry drivers were slaves# Hence there were no Arab eye witnesses of the deed, for slaves donot ever talk# Three things however are certain and have been amply corroborated by AJman and Mutair tribal report: (a) The prisoners actually set out for Hoffuf and were seen# (b) The old Ajman woman who cooked the prisoners* food and sent it to their prison daily, was told she need no longer cook their food as the prisoners had left the previous day for Hassa# (c) The prisoners never reached Hoffuf. GOMMSKTT* Ibn Jaloui had many times and publicly vowed that he would take the life of Naif ibn Hathlain for the part he took in the killing of his son Fahad bin Jaloui in 1929 as well as execute Ibn Lanrli and Ibn Humaid if they ever fell into his hands* The Kings leniency where these men were concerned had for long caused a ^coolness** between the Governor of Hassa and his Master.r? ] (C) In view of the King's written assurance to His Majesty's Government, given through the late Sir Hu^i Biscoe at Khabari Wadtha after the Akhwaa rebellion of 19S9/30 that Ibn Hath la in and Ibn Lami would not be put to death t but wilii Faisal al Duwish i»ould only be kept in prison for a reasonable period, if they were handed over by His Majesty's Goverracent, it is hoped that Jedda will cause careful and exhaustive enquiries to be made into the truth of the above story♦ The incident is of the highest | importanee in Bedouin eyes for all know of the promise given by the King to His Majesty^ Government, and England will be accused of a greivous breach of faith if these men have indeed been ^ut away*# 4# The following news was supplied by the Shaikh of Kuwait to the writer on E5th October: (a) The report was widely current in Riath and Kuwait that His Majesty^ Government was financing Bin Saud for his coming war with Yemen and had given him two loans• Note» The Shaikh enquired if I had heard anything to . this effect# (b) Bin Jaloui had executed 2 Mutair tribesmen!Jiblan) | 2 Mutair ditto (Braih): 1 Nejdi townsman; for having been caught with merchandise on Iheir persons #i;ilst crossing from Kuwait into Nejd» (c) He, the Shaikh, had received a letter from one of his subjects in Aden (by Air Mail from Karachi), dated 12th October to the effect -Qiat Nejran had been evacuated by the Imam Yahya except for 3 strong forts (which had been erected) , and all Yemen troops had proceeded to the Sabiya front# (d) Al Shuwaish hitherto one of Bin Saud's most popular and trusty friends and counsellors, and for long entrusted/17, entrusted with the royal camel herds, was suddenly arrested in Riath about 19th October and thrown into prison. All his tents, property etc* etc., had been confiscated and his womenfolk brou^it to Riath by a certain A1 Ribai, another of the King* s most trusty henchmen. COMMENT. The above news has caused much concern among the Mutair (Jiblan Section), among wliom A1 Shuwaish was an out standing and respected figure. No charge has, as far as one can make out, been preferred against the man. III. BLOCKADE &gt; (a) Nothing of importance to report under this head, except the saTage beheading by Ibn Jalou^s orders of the 5 men caught snuggling (See the immediately preceding para (b).) A (b) Reference para 111(b) of September Summary. Letters have reached the sons (in Kuwait) of %i9te one of the iinaiza merchants recently arrested by the King for trading with Kuwait to the effect that before their father* s release the King held a Durbar of tribesmen and Townsmen in Riath and swore publicly that if he caught anyone of his subjects trading with or being in possession of goods emanating from Kuwait, he would not only confis cate his camels ai*i the goods but would have the man exe cuted on the spot. He, Uie King, had called upon God, all those present, and all who could not be present, to bear witness that he had given this solemn warning so that no one should have cause to complain afterwards, if he slew regardless of mercy. The King added that he had already sent orders to his frontier officials near Kuwait to carry out these instructions to the letter. The sons were warned by their father to be extra careful.( a ) on 13th October one Saeed bin Abdulla Asiri arrived from Trans Jordan ostensibly to buy^Abbahs'* He left again on 15th October• (b) On a4th Khan Sahib Shaikh Farhan al Raima of Basra, a personal friend of the writer and one well known to the Royal Air Force Intelligence Department, returned from Riath via Bahrain (by up slow mail)# He had repaired there last August* He sent a letter ashore describing his journey and confirming all Riath news as given above, including the mur der of the unfortunate w Riath prisoners 1 *# Shaikh Farhan mentioned Ibat he had met Mr.Twitchell of the Standard Oil Co#, Ltd# and that the latter had seemed most enthusiastic regarding Oil all over the Hassa Province# 0 I L ♦ (a) K#S#Shaikh Farhan (mentioned in the previous para, ♦b*) informed the writer that Riath gossip had it that Bin Saud had insisted tiiat the Shaikh of Qatar went to Riath in connection with Oil and that Bin Saud had insisted that he, 'Bie Shaikh, should break with the A#P»0#C#, and give the final Qatar Concession to the Standard Oil# (b) In a subsequent conversation on the same subject which the writer had with the Shaikh of Kuwait on 26th October 19S3, the latter gave for what it was worth, the following piece of Riath Palace gossip, ^shich had reached Kuwait by trustworthy^^-—^ (i) The inan who had got the Shaikh of Kt^wtfit to go to Riath, had been Mahomed al Mana (a very pro Bin Saud individual) acting under King* s th e/instru cti ons # (ii) At a secret interview with the King the latter had asked his guest what he meant by giving/giving an exploration concession to the A # F # 0»G # Did he wish Qatar to become like Bahrain, a complete dependency of the English? If so he was going Hie right way about it» If he gave the A»P # 0 # C # the final Oil Conces sion, had he asked himself, what would happen? The English would assuredly expect safety and protection for the Company f s Engineers etc^, from him, the Shaikh of Qatar, and fail ing effective protection, they would as assured -ly land troops or bring aeroplanes to do it for him. If the Shaikh was unreasonable he, Bin Saud, would certainly see that this came about, insplte of anything that he, the Shaikh, could say; for Nejd tribesmen had an awkward way of getting out of hand and attack ing where they were least expected to attack. The first to be hurt would be the A.P # 0 # C # refineries (at his instigation of course). The English would then be forced to act and take over Qatar, or at least the protection of the A.P.O.C. community. If on the other hand he,the Shaikh, was sensible and gave the concession to the King's proteges, the Standard Gil Co., of America, why, then everything would be 'couleur de rose' for him, and the British would get no chance at all of getting a footing in his State as all Nejd Bedouins would know how to behave themselves. COMMffllT. No doubt the Political Agent, Bahraiii, has also heard the above story, and can say what the true facts are. The tale however rings true, for his threat of Nejd Bedouinsm IZ m Bedouins getting out of hand, is a favourite dodge of the King, when Judicious pressure is required to be brought to bear on a person who does not quite see eye to eye with him# It has been tried against Kuwait before now, and indeed may again be attempted before long# A reliable Bedouin, who looks after the writer's camp arrangements in Kuwait, and who was in Riath during the Shaikh of Qatar*s whole visit there, reported that the first story that went around was that the Shaikh of Qatar's country had been seized by the British and the Shaikh, and party had come to appeal to Bin Saud for help# Later this was denied and it was said the visit was purely a friendly one# Before he returned home. Shaikh Abdulla ibn Thani was given a present of 5 new Ford motor cars by the King, and 4 mares and 1 stallion by Ibn Jaloui# 71* FIRINGr ON KUWAIT IHOW BY 'IRAQ. CUSTOMS LAUNCH, On the night of ISth October, a small dhow, crew of five, owned in Kuwait, by two domiciled Persian^, subject^ of the Shaikh, was returning empty from Bandar DILAM, a port in Persia, ?tien it was attacked by an armed Customs launch belonging to the Fao (•Iraq) Customs service# The Officer in charge of the launch apparently hailed the dhow in the early morning (1 o* Clock Arabic), and ordered it to heave to. As the crew did not hear the hail, they did nothing, #iereupon the launch opened a sharp fire on the dhow, killing the Nakhuda and wounding two of her crew# The Customs officer one Hussain Effendi then boarded the dhow, but found no cargo on board# He next proceeded to take the dhow in tow and conveyed her to Fao, where the Police apparently took the case in hand. The incident is said to have taken place close to Has Bubiyan, (i#e. near the old Turkish Fort, which is situated on the Island oten - 14 - Island of that name) and the survivors protested to the Police that thejr had been shot up outside t Iraq waters, and generally brutally treated in the manner described, in spite of the fact that their craft was entirely empty and they were in nocently returning to Kuwait from a voyage to Persia• The Police, who from various accounts received in Kuwait, took the part of the dhow, asked Hussain Sffendi to show them the exact spot where the incident took place# This Hussain Effendi made out to be West of the Fao peninsula opposite the date gardens known as A1 Duwasir, althougji the two survivors very strongly protested that this was not so# At the Shaikh f s request a telegraphic protest was at once made to the Hon'ble the Political Resident at Bushire for onward transmission to the *Iraq Grovernment, and a full report is being made of the incident which from the Kuwait point of view is a serious one# This is the second occasion when a Kuwait dhow has been 'shot up 1 * with loss in killed and wounded because the Nakhuda did not heave towhen told to do so on the high seas,. Vll .AGrRARIAK TROUBLES IN SHAIKH of kuwaits fa6 i &gt;R0feskTr» The serious agrarian troubles which broke out in the Shaikh of Kuwait f s Fao Estate on the Shatt al Arab early in the Summer, and which lasted laarou^iout July, August and September were brought to a successful conclusion on ing 8th October f The end coincided with the departure of the Mutasarrif of Basra to another part of ^raq# The origin of the trouble was dirouded in mystery, and outwardly showed itself in the form of an appeal to the Mutasarrif, Basra by certain fellahs for protection against the Shaikh, who was made out to have usurped the pioperty from themselves, the real owners of the soil# The Mutasarrif from the first took the side of the fellaheen, and nearly succeeded in bringingbringing about a most ugly and serious situation* Fortunately the Shaikh ably supported by his Basra lawyer and Agent| suceesslUlly countered the various moves of the fellaheen and the Mutasarrif and by tactful and diplo matic methods, tenainated the dispute in the satisfactory manner recorded# The Shaikh suggests that the whole incident was an attack against himself and was inspired frcni Baghdad, but it is difficult to prove this# The curious part of the business is that the property has been in the Shaikhs family for close on 100 years, and never before have the tenants given the sli^itest trouble, or ever expressed dis satisfaction against their landlords Yiru ASSYRIAN TROUBLES» A prominent Basra notable (name need not be divulged) visited Kuwait early in the month and in con versation with the Shaikh gave the following appreciation of the Assyrian trouble# This is given below, with due apologies, as an interesting example of how certain politi- | cally minded Basrawis, viewed that unfortunate business* (a) Had not the Assyrian trouble eventuated, ■ there was to have been a Shiah tribal rising on the Suph^rates* (b) The Assyrian situation gave the 'Iraq Government a heaven sent chance of taming the peoples minds in the direction of an anti-English and anti- Christian campaign, with the result that (a) above did not come off. (c) The Turkish Minister in Baghdad had a large hand in the Assyrian business and advised the Government to adopt the strong measures they did which followed good Turkish precedent.

Their fanaticism has gone and they are definitely an exploded and broken force# The campaign towards Yemen is highly unpopular, and there are indications that the Tmnm Yahya has successfully r got at* some of Bin Saud r s most reliable tribes, notably the Ataiba and Harb# It is openly whispered in Riath that this is so. Qt the Hassa and Rialh contingents, which were sent south under Faisal ibn Sa'ad al Saud, half deserted before they were two days out of the capital. The outstanding examples being the Awazim, Mutair and Harb. The first arrived at the capital some 600 strong, but only 150 marched south# The King is fully aware of his unpopular! ty, and does not dare leave his capital and lead his Army himself# Nor will he allow his son Saud to leave Kejd for the same reason# There is no question at all of Bin Saud invading Yemen or Najran, on the contrary he is on the defensive already and straining every nerve to save Asir from the large, well equipped and organized amy that the Imam Yahya is collecting, on the Asir front. It is even talked about in Riath that Yahya r s objective is Mecca itself, but f Palace f circles say 12iat the King will make peace and surrender Asir before anything so serious as Ihat happens. (h)/7 «» 3 « (h) Should the Saudi an forces in Asir suffer the slightest rererse, then the Nejd amy of Bedouin irregulars will at once melt away and without a doubt outbrealcs will ocour in various directions in Nejd, commencing with passive defiance of Tax gatherers authority# (i) Much anti-English talk is the fashion in the Capital, and from the King downwards, England is made out to be eveiything that is bad and to be slowly working for the downfall of the Saudi dynasty* (j) The King himself frequently discussed this very question with Shaikh Shunaif, and asked him on more than one occasion, about f Iraq and His Majesty^ Government 1 s present methods there. When he, Shunaif, defended British policy and Englishmen generally, the King invariably ended up with the impatient expression, ^OIU You simple Sa t adunis» You do not know the English as I do. They have got us all by the throat and will not let go till they have throttled and killed us# Look at their treatment of me 1 *, (iad much more in this vein)# (k) Sp-ea Saud the son of the King gave out in public Mejliss and in the presence of the informer that the English had deliberately poisoned the late King Faisal, and that there was no doubt of that at all, say what they liked# 4# Speaking generally the impression gathered by Shaikh Shunaif during his sojourn at Riath was (a) That Bin Saud was completely on the rocks financially, and that his Kingdom was not far from the r breaking up* point: (b) That Bin Saud had changed his old methods4 ■* 7 / ^ methods of rule,from those of a benevolent * Shaikhly Ruler f to those of a 1 oniel despot f (c) That Bin Saud and his whole family were to-day definitely anti-Englidi, and were pub licly putting all their troubles at Great Britain 1 s door # 5 f As regards (a) and (b) above, Shaikh Shunaif opined that the King^s changed and foolish method# of dealing with his tribes was entirely due to the evil influence and corrupting ideas of his Syrian advisers, like Yusuf Yasin and Fuad Hamza, who had no more idea of understanding the Bedouin or treating him properly than their original mentors, the Turks# They it was, who were ever advising the King to adopt western methods with his tribes, which would never work, and only brought him into opposition (as it was doing) with the religious heads of Nejd# 6 # As regards (c) abore, in Shaikh Shunaif's view what was wanted to-day in Riath was a specially selected Arab speaking Englishman with, above all, knowledge of Arab and Bedouin psychology* Such person should be sent to Bin Saud t s Court to propagaj^ and improve relations# Heavy anti-British propaganda was all the time going on in Riath, the King and his family being the simple victims# 7# I have thought it my duty to submit the above account of my interview with this latest arrival from Nejd, as not only is the news quite fresh, but the man himself appears to be of a thinking and sensible type# 8# Shunai^s father and grandfather having died serving Bin Saud, his present information regarding con ditions in Nejd might, at first sight, be assumed to be unbiased# I gathered, however, that Shunaif had hoped to get money from Bin Saud (he is poor), but had failed, also that during his 7 months sojourn in Riath, he had/ ^ ** 5 7 fcad not been treated with the honour that every Sa'aduni expects as his due *• hence one must f I think, discount some of the things said* In the main, however, I think the information to be a oorrect picture of the situation, I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, J Lt*-Colonel, Politi cal Agent,Kuwait # ¥SSCC : ?T ?IDENTIAL» | POLITICAL AGENCY, No. 286, (jUSH^f KOTAIT. ted tlie 30th November 1033« fiUSH^F Yttv hi ■ l fTj voT ' 1 r OOKHOi' gut ] From Lt.-Colonel H^R^F♦Dickson, C^I.E^, I.A., Political Agent, Kuwait; To The Hon^ble the Political Resident in the Persi an Gulf, Bushire a Kuwait Intelligence Summary for Not ember Sir, yP • yf In continuation of my confidential Noso862 and E69, dated the 30th October and 8th November, respectively, I have the honour to forward my Intelligence Summary of Kuwait, Nejd and Hinterland news for the month of November, together with four spare copies♦ I am sending one copy of this each to Jedda and Bahrain direct. I» T R I B A L » (a) The whole desert world continues expectantly to await news of the coming clash between the armies of Bin Saud and those of the Imam Yahya of Yemen, and as already reported, the hope is almost universal that Bin Saud will suffer defeat♦ This would be the signal for all anti-Bin Saud elements to break out into rebellion. Those most desirous of the discomfiture of their King would appear, according to general gossip, to be (i) The Shammar, (ii) The Ataiba, (iii)The Mutair, (iv) The Ajman, (v) The people of Qasim, the richest province of Saudiyeh. (b) The Shaikh of Kuwait, and the writer supports him- E * him in this view, still -thinks that Bin Saud will not fight Yahya, but that peace will be declared and en arrangement come to before a serious clash takes place» The feeling of the people of Kuwait is curiously inconsistent* Their attitude is that it would never do for Bin Saud to suffer eclipse at the hands of the Zaidi Imam of Yemen# And even though Bin Saud is cordially hated by every one from the Shaikh down for his heartless and cruel 10 years blockade of Kuwait, family ties . sentiment and noblesse obligee would, it would seem, always in the end outweigji any personal feelings of enmity against the King, and there is little doubt in my mind, that both the Shaikh of Kuwait and his people would side with Bin Saud if ever the latter fared so badly as to be 'in extremis*♦ This feeling is psychological though contradictory, and should be realized by anyone trying to understand the Arabian situation# One must not forget also that the Shaikh and leading families of Kuwait are of Anaze extraction, just as Bin Saud is, and the remainder of the populace, either originate from ftasim or are closely con nected with the great tribes of Nejd# It is a case of t blood is thicker than water*# (c) Saudiyeh officials views, as given me by such persons as the son of Ibrahim bin Muammar, Saudi Minister in Baghdad, A1 Nafici, and Ibn Shaja r an, Commander of Blockade Troops south of Kuwait, are that (i) the Imam Yahya is now definitely alarmed at the preparations of the King of Saudiyeh and has already asked for peace; (ii) that Bin Saud has in formed him that he will only agree to discuss terms provided he, the Imam Yahya, pays him an amount equal to the money ex pended on the mobilization that has taken place, and that a definite and clear guarantee is given him that the Idrisi, now sheltering in Yemen, will be kept under proper control, and will not be allowed to further disturb the peace of Asir ar Saudiyeh* (d) All reports, whether emanating frcm the Shaikh of Kuwait, the tribes, or Saudi officials, definitely state that- 3 i state that no fi&amp;btlri^ of any sort has taken place between the rival forces up to the 15th HoTember© II» VISITORS ♦ The following prominent and other tribal visitors called on me during the period under review:- 3rd November: / f 5th November: 13th November: 15th November: 19th November: 36th November; E7th November E7th November Shunaif bin Hamud bin Abdulla al Sa , ^un (Ex Riath, vide my confidential No»S69, dated the 8th November 1933)# Aiyadh bin Hamdan, formerly employed by Major Grlubb (said to be Anaze)# Mohamed bin Hajaj ) ) AJman.

(c) Bedouin reports received in Kuwait on 27th, stated that excellent rain had fallen west of the Batin in the ^raq Dibdibba region, and that as a result Ajemi al Suwait (Dhafir) and his following were moving there from the Hamatiyat regionregion of tiie Sliaqq* (d) On B8th, E9th, 30th November saw heavy clouds over Kuwait town but no rain# IV.ROYAL AIR FORCE SURVEY OF KUWAIT &amp; KUWAIT KSUTRAL ZONE. ^ (a) Major Papworth, R^S., Survey Officer to Royal Air Force Headquarters {♦Iraq Conmiand) resumed his survey of the Neutral Zone on Snd November 1933, his assistant doing the same thing in the area on the north side of the Bay of Kuwait. (b) Both parties completed their work on 17th and 19th November respectively and returned to Shaiba # Ma j or (c) Papworth was supplied with the usual guards and guides by His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait in cluding hawkers with birds to provide the party with fresh game • (d) Major Papworth, as on the previous occasion when he visited Kuwait, made himself popular with everyone he came in contact with, and generally received high praise froai the Shaikh for his tact and fair dealing with the Arab, His final departure from Kuwait was genuinely regretted by both the Ruler, and every Arab with whom he came in contact» The same may be said of the survey staff as a whole- (e) On 9th November and i/9hile Major Papworth was camped some 6 miles south of Jebel Banaiya (known as A1 Diud, n the breasts 11 , among the Bedouin) in the coastal region of the Huzaim (Neutral Zone), I heard from A1 Nafisi, Bin Saud's Trade Agent in Kuwait, that a Saudi armed party under ibn Shaja t an had been sent by the King to protect the Survey Party and had arrived at and was camped at Wafra. I accord ingly proceeded by oar on 10th to Araif jan, camped there for night, and next day visited Major Papworth♦ After discussing with the latter Ibn Shaja'a^s arrival and learning that hehe had axffioient guards from the Shaikh of Kuwait to meet requirements, I proceeded to Ibn Shaja f ans camp at Wafra» The latter gave me a friendly reception and over a cup of coffee, I explained that Major Pap worth was grateful to the King, his master, for the guard which had been sent, but was really in no need of same* I suggested that he and Hie guard should be withdrawn. Ibn Shaja f an thanked me but said that he must report to the Survey Party, as these were his orders. This he did next day, and inspite of Major Papworth repeating what I had said, Ibn Shaja'an remained a rather unwelcome guest till the 16th November n&amp;ien survey operations were closed down. I myself returned to Kuwait on ISth November. (f) The Air Officer Commanding, ♦Iraq Command visited Kuwait on 13th November and afterwards flew doim to Majoir Papworth's camp where he spent the night. GOMMBNT. The visit of Ibn Shaja r an thou^i outwardly a mark of Bin Saud*s gracious consideration for Major Papworth's safety, had in my opinion two objects (i) To watch certain Awazim sections camped in the Neutral Zone, who were suspected of running contraband from Kuwait into Hassa: (b) To watch Major Papworth and see that he was not secretly boring for oil and general -ly conducting a geological survey. Ibn Shaja'an, a Mutatrl (of the Birzan Section) by origin, is known as one of Abdulla Ibn Jalou^s most cruel and heartless of butchers. It was chiefly due to his efforts that 5 blockade runners were executed in Hoffuf in October last (Tide Kuwait Summary, No.E62, of 30th October, para 11(4)(b) and 111(b)), V. RIATH NBWS AND WAR RUMOURS GENERALLY. 1# (a) On 20th November a report was current in Kuwait that a large ship load of arms and anmunition including fj^ed guns had arrived at Hodeida from G-enoa for the use of the Yemen armies. (b) A similar report said tiiat two high Italian officers&lt;* 5&gt;\- V officers had landed at Hodeida and proceeded to Sana^ (c) On 23rd November the Shaikh of Kuwait reported that Bin Saud left for Mecca on 16th November and also that he had received a telegram from Aden to -foe effect that the opposing Saudi and Yemen forces were in contact Just south of Sabiya in Asir, but that no shot had been fired* (d) On 84th news from Zubair said that telegrams received there reported fighting and a heavy reverse for Bin Saud. (The news was not credited locally.) The driver of Bin Saud's 2nd car, a Somali named Juma ibn Mohamed Yahya visited me on 26th November and reported the following interesting news, rtiich I consider reliable: NOTE* Juma's news is the more interesting as he is the British subject registered in liiis Agency, who sometime back was rumoured to have been executed in Riath, but later was proved by H.M*s Minister in Jedda to be safe. Juma^ report was as follows:- He, Juma, left Riath on 15th November, by car, with Ibrahim bin Muammar's son. The previous day 16th November, Bin Saud had left Riath for Rukba (3 hours short of Taif) ostensibly to hunt gazBlle, but in reality to visit Ataiba country en route and see what could be done to quiet that tribe which was said to be shaky and to have been got at by Imam Yahya* (See my Summary No.269, dated the 8th November, para 3{c )o Bin Saud was accompanied by his sons, Mohamed and Khalid. Amir Saud gave out that he would follow his father on 22nd November© The King before leaving had stated that he would meet iimir Faisal, Phllby and Abdulla bin Sulaiman (Finance) at Rukba. The King's brother Mohamed remained hunting north of PI o+Vinorth of Hiath* (b) Following was the military situation on 15th November: Bin Saud had 4 armies distributed as follows: (i) Hassa Force , under Sa'aid al Faisal, con sisting of 18 Bairaqs (approx* 1800): f 11 ) Hiath Force (A) under Al Subeli (Sbei) consisting of 27 Bairaqs (approx»3000 men): 0)0* f Objective of above Nejran, route via Buam (Bam) Bisha, Tathlith^ Hiath Fo rce (B) under Faisal bin Sa'ad al Saud consisting of 35 Bairaqs (approx»9000 men) now at SB HA* (iv) Hejaz Force under AlShuwair (Shammarl) whose daughter mrried to Amir Faisal) # Strength not known but said to be 5000 men* Now at Jezan and Subiya* (v) General Headquarters at Sbha under Amir Faisal, where principal Mreless installed^ (o) Yemen Forces were concentrated in great strength (rumoured 40000) near coastal Town of MSDI, south of MATAYAo Other Yemen forces at Sa^da, ready to move on Nejran or to Sabiya front, as occasion demanded* (d) Juma definite that no fighting had occurred up to 15th November. (This confirmed from Ibrahim ibn Muammar's sen also). (e) In Rlath up to recently, were Shaikh Ahmad al Sulalman, Khalid al Qarkhanl and Turk! ibn Madhl, three members of Embassy that recently went to Yemen. Both ha/e come to report to Bin Saud. (f) In Biath under open arrest, but always guarded, was Seyed Abdul ffahab al Idrisi. (g) News re: Riath Prisoners. (See para II,3(b) of Summary No .26S, dated the 30th October 1933.k - ^ - 7 - Juma related that he was himself present when they were removed from prison in Riath, a week before the Shaikh of Qatar arrived at the Capital (1st September), The circumstances were as follows;- (i) Six of Bin Jaloui f s cars, is cylinder Buick, 4 lorries and 1 Chevrolet arrived at Riath from Hoffuf bringing Amir Faisal's wife (the grand-daughter of Ibn Jaloui)* (ii) Bin Saud seized opportunity of sending the following prisoners to Hoffuf in the cars: Sultan ibn Humaid, Naif ibn Hathlain, Ibn Lami, 14 other Ataiba Shaikhs• (iii) The greatest secrecy was observed during their removal, Aich took place at 11.30 PJI* All approaches to the prison were guarded, and drivers were forbidden to blow horns either in Riath or at Hoffuf on arrival. (iy) The prisoners when brou^it out looked i « n arm was still ♦ result of beating he had received whon he was suspected of having connived at the attempted escape of Ataiba Shaikh last Summer (reported). (v) Cars left at midnight and made fast journey to Hoffuf under guard of 18 selected slaves of Ibn Jaloui - Chevrolet in front. 4 lorries in centre and big Buick in rear. ff j (vi) Convoy entered Hoffuf also at midnirfit I ]' n secrecy and prisoners were placed i in the KOT prison in underground dungeons. (vii) Juma received details of journey from the Somali driver of the ^8 cylinder Buick (his friend) who returned to Hiath 8 days after, with Abdulla bin Thani, Shaikh of Qatar. (viii)Juma was told by liiis driver that if prisoners were not secretly executed by Ibn Jaloui, as the Negro guards opined they would be, they could not long survive the dungeon life where no light penetrated at all. (ix) Juma's view^ was that the King intended ^t away, and so had sent tnem to Bin Jaloui♦ The above I believe to be the true story of the many contra dictory rumours that have come up to Kuwait regarding the execution of the Riath prisoners. Nor do I think the latter had even a sporting chance, once they were transferred to the ■^niir of Hassa's unlovely hands. tl./ mm71. PAIESIIMB BV3MTS. (a) On 24th November a letter, dated the 23rd of November and signed by the ^SHABIBilT AL lOTfJOITTYEH^ (Youngmen of Kuwait) was received by me • It read as follows: Kuwait # 23*11.35. To The Political Agent, Kuwait. In the name of the Merciful and Compassionate God, Whose help we seek. After Compliments. We. on behalf of all our old men and youngmen, and on behalf of our gentle women folk, beg to lay before Your Excellency this our sharp protest against His Majesty 1 s Government's methods towards our brothers, the Arabs of Palestine, which no nation in the world, ^hich considers itself just and impartial, as your G-overnment, we know, does, could take any sort of pride in. Indeed such treatment may also estrange the world from entering under ypur protection, which firstly we wish to see strong and secondly worthy. Be very sure that such unjust treatment will cause seventy millions of us Arabs, and three hundred and fifty millions of Mohammedans to bear you ill will, and await the hour of vengeance, for, verily everything has an end, and time will inevitably turn against the cruel. We, in view of the rights Kuwait has upon you, and the consideration you have always shown her, shall thank you to refer this our protest to your High Government. Sd.Al Shabibat al Kuwaitiyeh. (b) On receipt of the above document, I at once for warded it to His Excellency and enquired if he could tell me who the ^Shabiba' were and whether such document need -iL taken seriously, seeing that it bore no signature. His Excellency in reply advised me to treat it as a foolish effort on the part of some of his young people (he did not know who) and that I certainly need not to take any notice of a letter vtilch had not come througji him. I took his advice. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant.

He contemplates seme rather complicated trekking so it may be some time before he sees your letter^ I therefore acknowledge your kind offer of further assistance and I take the opportunity of saying how fully I share what Calvert said about the value of your monthly summaries to us here. One of my first tasks when I returned from leave was to read all those that I had not seen and I found them a mine ofvaluable information. We wrote to Bushire to express our thanks for your excellent answers to my questionnaire about trade,&amp;c. We have not yet got down to the economic survey we had planned but we hope to start -on it seriously in the near future. Nothing of the sort has been done since Ibn Saud roped the Hejaz into his dominions. At the moment the Saudi-Yemen situation continues to take up a great deal of our time. I should say that the chances of war or peace are now about fifty-fifty. The feature of the last month has been the tenseness of the situation in the mountain region northwest of Sa^da. This has done more to excite the Saudis than any other recent phase. The King continues to send troops to the South. Among the more or less recent departures from Taif has been that of Ibn Rubaiyan and his f Ateyba. Lt.-Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, C.I.E., Political Agent, KUWAIT .- E - Th.© difficulty all along has been to determine how far Ibn Saud has been actuated by firmness or fear. He has certainly been too prudent to rush into a dangerous war but he may merely have been postponing it until he is quite ready. Anyhow it really does look as though weware approaching the denouement; and yet when one remembers all that has happened between him and the Imam since 1926, one cannot even be sure of tMs. Yours sincerely, Sd* Andrew Ryan»CONFIDENTIAL, jSTo.

I have literally had no time at all to write Intelligence Summaries. (d) As I shall have a good deal of back ground to make up, I fear the present report will be somewhat long. (a) Up to the end of January not only Kuwait but the whole of Horth-Sast Arabia and Hassa fared badly where rain was concerned. The normal rainy season usually commences about the 15th October (WASM)and the tribes I. RAHI SITUATION. always/us© ~ 2 ~ always hope to get sometliiiig in November, but tiiis Winter, except for a few drops, which merely freshened things up, no rain fell till 3rd of February* On that date a depression would appear to have formed in North East Arabia and to have moved up into southern 'Iraq, and along the Supherates valley» Kuwait got a drizzle on 3rd February, another drizzle on 5th February and one whole-day of good rain {over v inch) on the 9th February* Southern and middle 'Iraq including the desert area south of the Eu- pherates and in North Kuwait did very much better from all account s&lt;. (b) South of Kuwait, especially in the Hassa zone, the Summan region (Mutair Country) and central and south central Nejd the rains have failed entirely except for a shower or tv/o reported frcm the AL JUDA area north west of Hoffuf and the SUDA region on the coast north of Jubail 9 (c) From the northern Bedouin point of view this 'Blessing of G-od' has relieved what promised to be a very serious situation indeed•. Everywhere grass is coming up well, west of the Batin valley, and moderately well in the Principality of Kuwait. The Northern portion of Kuwait has fared better than the southern, but even so the 'arfaj' bush has burst into bloom, and grass is appearing every where More rain however is wanted in Kuwait if the new grass is not to wither up and die* Only a trifle over i' has so far fallen while the annual average rainfall should reach 3^' to 4'* (d) Speaking generally ^raq and the Southern 'Iraq desert has had very ^ood rains; Kuwait, moderate rainsj Hail.and Jebel Shaimnar, moderate rains: inner Nejd and Hassa, none at all* (e) This means that Y/hile the f Iraq camel and shepherd tribes have been well provided for,things are going to be difficult for the Kuwait Bedouin (unless more rain falls) and very serious indeed for the tribesof Nejd and Hassa. The latter must migrate up to 'Iraq and Kuwait in search~ 3 ~ searoh of 'Hayat' (life) as they have already been doing throughout Febmary in large numbers, and nothing will induce them to go south again into ( reasom ble^e jdI unless rain falls in the interior, hov^ever much Bin Saud thunders^ For the Bedouin, therefore, the situation is fraught with anxiety* (a) ICumit tribes (Fidawiyeh and Araibdar) under the imir Haif bin Hajraf (Ajman) , vfho throughout December and January were camped in the Ab—al—Hiran, oa'da ano. HaiiB.ti— yat areas (Garaa Region) between the Musannat ridge and the Shaq,C[ depression^ gradually mo¥ed north with the advent of the rains and by the end of February settled themselves in the Hauma and Shiggat al Ruwaisat districts in the North lest corner of the Principality. They now water their camels at Hauma and Aglat ibn Sigai wells* (b) Awazim (followers of Ibn Draih, Ibn Khafra, Ion Juma, IbnAtrama, Hai-al-Fahama) practically the whole tribe both camel and sheep sections, moved up from Hassa during February in one vast migration to the northern portion of Kuwait grazing. By the end of the month the vanguard I- - oonsisting of vast numbers of camels and tents had reached the area north-west of the Liyah ridge at Um-al-Ruwaisat, came into touch with the Kuwait tribesj the rear guard, consisting of the slower moving sheep section were echeloned hack as far south as Subaihiyeh on the southern border. The above now water at Jahara, Subaihiyeh and Tawil wells. (o) Rani TOialid (Salah bin Abdulla) behind the Awazim moved up several section of the aristocratic Bani Khalid nomads. These normally live roundabout Q,atif and Jubail. The end of February saw some 60 tents of the tribe in the Kuwait Neutral Zone. They water at wafra. (d) Uutair (Ilwa and .Tasil) have practically all moved north-west across the Batin valley and by the end of February were echeloned from the 'Iraq. Dibdibba region and the Tawal al Dhafir {'Iraq Neutral Zone) in the North down/- 4 - down to ill Thamsmi in the south. Several sections notably the followers of A1 Fuqin and others are now camped frn the south west angle of Kuwait* The Mutair water from the ♦Iraq Neutral Zone, Hafar al Batin, and Bashuk well area. ilaif al llaziad (official leader of the Mutair Ilwa) is at Artawiyeh, with al Hamaidi son of Faisal al Duwish # Mashari ibn ^usaiyis % Nazil al I^Iusaiyis and other 'V/asil^ leaders (BRAH) were camped at Thamami at the end of February. (e) Harb (Al Firm) in the Bashuk region are echeloned westward from Thamami towards Hail. ^ Shammar more or less follow the grazing grounds of the Harb, though many are to be found in the f Iraq Neutral Zone (Tawal al Dhafir) and the Hajira region, 'Iraq southern Desert. (g) Ajman» Numbers of tents belonging to no particular section are scattered over the Kabd, Um Junaiyib and regions, south and southwest of Kuwait and are slowly moving north after the Awazim. This great tribe has remained completely disorganized ever since the Akhwan rebellion of 1950-31 was put down by Bin Saud when the principal leaders fled to Baghdad and only the southern sections under Ibn Munaikhir, Ibn Mikrad etc. remained loyal to the King. Shaikh Rakan, the son of the murdered Dhaidan al Hathlain, the last great Shaikh of the Ajroan, is not yet old enough to take a leading part in the tribe, and besides which he is kept under perpetual surveillance at Riath. 2o In discussing these tribal movements, it should be realized that each of the above tribes have all sent contingents to the 'Yemen War 11 , some in greater proportion to others. For instance the Mutair (Ilwa) have sent all their Shaikhs except Faisal al Duwish's younger son, Al Humaidi, Naif ibn Maziad (official Shaikh)and the Braih Shaikhs Ibn Jarbua, Ibn Ashwan, Ibn uhuwaribat, with their paramount Shaikh Mashari bin Musaiyis, while the Awazim have sent a comparatively small contingent of not more than 400/(*5 L - 5 - 400 probably♦ Speaking generally the following tribes have sent strong contingents to the 'Jar; Ataiba, Mutair, Q^ehtan, Dawasir, Sbei, Sahool, Ajman, Murra, Bani Hajir; while the following have been let off lightly, Harb, Braih (Mutair Wasil) Awazim, Bani IQialid, Liana sir, Shammar (Nejd Sections) » Braih (headqiiarters 'Al Hafar ?? ) have sent only a very few men, their role with Harb, being to guard the north eastern frontier of Bin Baud's Dominions, and assist Hammud al Bagaawi, the King's Chief Blockade Officer opposite Kuwait The following names represent some of the principal Shaikhs who are reliably reported to have gone with the Kings various 'G-hazzus' to the Asir fronts In the case of the Mutair the names may be taken as fairly correct, since I have special means of finding out what is going on in this great tribe.

The Awazim chiefs told him that ff it was better for them to risk Bin Sauds anger than to die. Behind us in Hassa lies death for our camels, our sheep and ourselves, to the north lies n Hayat n (life). We must proceed inspite of you tf o Al Bagaawi had perforce toilet the people go tr and contented himself with informing Ibn Jaloui, Governor of Hassa of the situation. The latter is reported to have sent reply that as it was a question of life and death for the Hassa tribes, he must not try and stop anyone moving towards the grazing grounds of the north. Other reports say that he replied that he would 'shortly detail a special force to deal with the disobedient ones'. I am inclined to believe the first story. 2. No doubt behind this northward move the various tribes also mean to replenish their own supplies from Kuwait Town, and possibly from Zubair, but they naturally do not- 8 - do not mention this. It stands to reason however tha once in Kuwait territory they will all certainly 'Sabil 1 ' to Kuwait in their thousands and as soon as possible. Nothing can prevent this. So until rains in the south cause Bin lluds tribes to return to their homes once more we may expect to see full 'Musabilah' take place between the Awazim, Ajman, Bani Khalid, and a large part of the Mutair with Kuwait. In other words March 1934 should see the Blockade broken and set at naught by Bin Saud's north eastern tribes for the first time in 10 years. This is all to the good from. Kuwait's point of view, while thousands of desperately poor tribal folk will at long last be able to buy from their ancestral market town, instead of being forced to go far south to Jubail, Qatif and Hoffuf for their necessities of life. 'Verily tb.e stars in their courses are', in the words of an old Ajman Shaikh, 'fighting against Abdul Aziz al Saud'. T¥. 7T3IT0RS.

Shaikh La'afi managed to get a message through to his brother to get his women folk secretly out of the Mutair country into Kuwait. This was done and his La'afi ibn Ma * ala th , one of the Shaikhs of Braih (Mutair) at present a fugitive from Saudi yetu Fahad bin Ma'alath, ^eed bin Ma * ala th, La'afi bin Ea'alath* Juma bin Maktum, brother of the Shaikh of Duba i • Yusuf bin Ahmad Kanoo, of Bahrain. S,.leh bin Abdulla of the Bani Lhaliu*and his two brothers Aeed and Fahad accompanied the ladies. They are all camped near Sahara prior to going into 'Iraq at the end of January and were visited by the writer on 10th February• (ii) In addition to the above, the family (ladies) of the Shaikh of Sharja visited Kuwait on 14th February 1934 en route to the Eejaz (Haj) * They left by the land route on 22nd Febrmry 1924. H ^ J . (a) The Kuwait camel Haj (trans-desert) left the Town between the 10th and 15th February. Not more than 500 persons left this year, as there was a general feeling of nervousness regarding the outcome of the Saudi - Yemen trouble. (b) A few cars also left for Riath from Kuwait with certain prominent lady members of the Naqib of Basra^s family, en route to Mecca, but this was done by special 1 permission. (c) In reply to a telegraphic query from certain Zubair notables to Bin Saud, as to whether they could go to the Haj in cars via Kuwait and Riath, the King replied and told them to refer to his Minister of Finance, Abdulla ibn Sulaiman, who would tell than of the fees that would have to be paid* This subsequently turned out to be £.T.2 per he ado RUMO'Lix-^ GL^H^LLY. Up to the end of February the principal topic of conversation in Kuwait has been the situation in the Asir - Yemen front. Many wild stories continue to come through, which all take a good deal of sifting. 3. As always is the case in Kuwait and especially among the tribal elements, persons hostile to Bin Saud have never/- 10 - never tired of spreading tales of the Hings difficulties, while conversely his Trade Agent and certain Kejd subjects residing here, have regularly tried to spread equally false news in favour of their Master- 4. At the end of January a particularly clear and circumstantial story {which was also confirmed from separate Mutair sources) was 'brought into Kuwait 'by one of Bin Sauds AJman messengers (ex Riath on 13th January)» This was to the effect that Saaiyid al Faisal, a negro commander of some of Bin Sauds advanced troops had made a sudden and treacherous attack on a force of some 1000 of Yahya* s army in the vicinity of Badr (Nejran)♦ The attack had been successful and 700 of Yahya's men had been slain. 5« The occurrence took place, it was said, during the truce when full peace negotiations were proceeding, and after Bin Saud had issued stringent orders to his generals that no offensive move whatsoever was to be made anywhere- As a result of the incident Yahya at once broke off peace conversations and ordered his armies to prepare immediately to take the offensive. 7. Bin Saud in vain dismissed Saa^iyid al Faisal and telegraphically expressed his profound regrets, but for sane days the Imam Yahya refused to be appeased. 8. Bin Saud, believing war was inevitable, sent his son Saud on 11th January post haste to Sbha with all available troops still in Riath (800 men) in light Ford lorries with orders to take supreme command, ifith the Amir Saud went Khalid bin liohamed as Saud and Fahad bin Sa'ad al Saud. 9 # The above story though promptly denied in Bahrain and elsewhere nevertheless obtained full evidence in Kuwait, seeing that it had been brought in by one of the King f s most trusty messengers. Sven the Shaikh of Kuwait, hitherto^ cautious, was inclined to believe the story and attached special significance to the departure of the Heir Apparent for the fronts 10 • On 5th February further news from RiathElath (this time tribal) arrived to the effect that Bin Saud had at last been successful in persuading Yahya that Sa^iyld al Faisal^ action had been entirely against his orders, and after expressing deep regret, had been able to restore the situation* The report further had it that Yahya* s troops had pursued and surrounded Sa^iyid al Faisal* force after their victory and in turn had captured the whole party, and it was this success on top of the Kings apologies that had turned the scales in favour of peace once more* This fresh report also had it that the original figure at 700 was incorrect and the true figurewas 300 killed by Sa r aiyid r s men* 11 # Peace negotiations were thereupon once again started and had continued till the end of February with varying success^ On 14th February the Shaikh of Kuwait reported that fresh news fron Riath had it that Bin Saud had ordered all the camels of his Asir expeditionary force to return to the highlands of Nejd, as there was an insufficiency of grazing in Asir, Such an order, if true, said His Excellency, would also serve the purpose of preventing mass desertions from the front of which many had been reported especially from the Ataiba tribe* 13 4 On 19th February the Shaikh reported that according to a Bedouin messenger from Artawiyeh a sharp fight had taken place near Ebha between the Mutair and the Harb tribal contingents of the King*, The Harb had been victorious at first and had killed 22 Mutairis, but subsequently the Ataiba came to the help of the Mutair, and turned the tables on the Harbo This interfaction fighting in the King's army had only been stopped after the Atair Saud had personally intervened* 14# On 27th February K*B.Abdul Latif bin Abdul Jalil, ex-Director of Customs, Kuwait, arrived from Riath (he had gone there on 9th February)* He brought (a) A personal and very friendly letter fromfrom the King to the writer^ (b) A similar letter to His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait * Both letters 7/ere dated 22nd February 1934g. With the Shaikhs letter caioe a Tt Mulhaq tr or enclosure marked n Yery secret Ty which was of sufficient interest to cause His Excellency to pay me a special visits The contents of the 'Mulhaq' were to the effect that though Yabya out wardly showed an accommodating spirit and was full of friend ly ideas, inwardly the man was full of treachery and guile That he was obviously playing a waiting game and inspite of his (Bin Saudfs) every offer of a friendly settlement would not come to the point. That the latest 'Wafd' (Peace Embassy) had arrived, and by its arrogant and impos sible demands, had made peace further away than it ever was% That he, the King, was still working for peace and would do so to the end, but that the result was now in God t s hand * 15. The Shaikh pointed out that reading between the lines, he saw that matters were fast approaching a crisis and for the following reasons: The T-mani Yaya was clearly out to waste time and give Bin Saud smooth words outwardly but all the time he was continuing his under ground activities against the King (such as encouraging the Asir tribes to rise and cut communications et» etc*)* Yahya t s obvious intention was to pin the Saudi forces to the Asir lowlands until the hot weather set in, when Bin Saud ¥/ould be forced to give way to all (Yahya's) demands or fight at a disadvantage. Yahya knew that Bin Saud was only keeping his Asir army supplied with food and fe munitions by superhuman efforts, and that money and supplies must fail if he could procrastinate long enoughs Bin Saud*s army leaders were daily impressing on the King that he must fight ncm or abandon Asir altogether, for they recognized that continued inaction was weakening the troops moral, and was playing into the enemy*s hands Bin Saud saw all this clearly also, but dare not risk a pitched battle• 'The wolf dared not bite the hedgehog 1 *, said the Shaikh. (b) (o) (d)- 15 - ! W ) 15} 16&lt;, His Exoellenoy was still of tlie opinion (expressed repeatedly since the commencement of the strained relations) 6 -c- that there nsould/no war and that some sort of a settlement would 'be arrived at somehow in the end, but that it would be disadvantageous to Bin Saud* 17 o. The crux of the situation lay, said the ShaixJa, round the Idrisi: Yahya wanted Bin Saud to give the Idrisi a small slice of'Asir to reside in under his (Yahya's) guarantee of good behaviour, while Bin oaud wanted (a) Either the surrender (unconditionally) of the Idrisi, or that Yahya should keep him^ (Idrisi) under surveillance in some town^in the interior of Yemen, he (Bin Saud) paying him a salaryo (b) That Yahya should pay him (Bin Saud) the total cost of maintaining his army in the field, calculated at approximately 10/- S* a day per man, from the day trouble began,. 18* The above conditions (17) were brought by K.B* Abdul Latif, who according to his own statement, had got them from the King himself. They are of course quoted | for what they are worth* Ho doubt H*M f s Minister at Jedda has the true facts at his disposal. 19 # According to the same source (K.B # Abdul Latif) the King was at his wits end for money, and hoped against hope that His Majesty's Government would still loan him a lump sum down to see him through his difficulties. 'How was the time for Great Britain to show whether her friend- ship was all a sham, or a true and loyal one', is said by the worthy Khan Bahadur to have been quoted to him by the King# VII. AH AJMaH SHtilKH ' S As an instance of the deep resentment and hostility which Bin Saud has managed to work up amongst the tribes of Nejd against himself, notably amongst the Ajman, Mutair and Ataiba, the following story may be found 1 of interest. It certainly is a pretty study in the psychology of the Bedouin.- 14 On 15th February a certain agedAJM^lN tribesman, (wliose name sliall be unmentioned) chief of* a small section, in discussing with me the possibilities of peace or war in the Yemen, gave it as his firm opinion that the days of Bin L^aud were numbered.. • tt GrOd ,t , said he, tr could no longer tolerate his misdoings and his harsh treatment of the Arabs and I^usalmino 1 know that what I say is right because * ten nights ago I dreamed a dream, and these sorts of dreams do not lie'* On my enquiring what his dream was, he related the following (his ?/ords, as close as possible)« 'I dreamed that I was in my small date grove at H f ta in Hassa, and was sleeping peacefully one afternoon by the side of one of the springs of water that exist there. It was midday and the heat of early Summer had made me sleepy. Suddenly I wo lie up feeling something crawling over my legs. In my dream I jumped up and saw that it was a viper which had disturbed me. I seized my stick and tried to kill it shouting loudly for help to my uncle lying in his tent close by. As I struck I wounded the snake only in the tail, and as I was about to strike again, behold, it lifted up its voice and spoke to me in man's tongue. I lay spellbound, and the snake said, 'Why, 01-do you hurt me, who would save you. I am no enemy but a friend• I am the vengeance of God* Let me depart in peace and you will live to bless me, for I come to kill your uncle who would destroy you'. Spellbound I dreamed that I awoke, and straightway (still in my dream) I went to our tribal priest (Mutawaa) andasked him to interpret my dream. The priest after hearing my story said, tr 0h this is the interpretation of thy dream: You are the people of Kejran, the Yam your blood brothers, the snake is Yahya, Lord of Yemen. Yahya on his ?/ay to slay the great Bin Saud passedpassed by you and you tried to kill him* He meant you no harm. Tou shouted and appealed for help to your uncle• He is Abdul Aziz al Saud, related to you in truth by blood and family ties, but nevertheless your enemy who would encompass your destruction. You did well to let the snake go, for verily he is G-od T s vengeance and will now carry out His work n . After this I woke, and knew that I had seen the coming death of the King, or at least his discomfiture. We, Ajman, are believers in dreams, and should a priest tell us anything in our dreams, it is a sure sign that what he says will come to pass. Bin Saud's days are numbered and great woe is coming over the land n . When the Bedouin of Arabia start dreaming dreams in the true old Testament stymie, and ?/hen these are passed from man to man and are believed, like the sayings of the prophets of old, then things begin to happen. VTII^ GIL On 15th February 1954, Mr.Chisholm and Major F.Holmes, representing the newly formed KuY/ait Oil Company, an amalgamation of the 'A.P.O.G.' and 'Gulf Oil Go., M of .America (Mellon Group) arrived in Kuwait. On 22nd February 1934, Messrs Ghisholm and Holmes presented to His Excellency the Shaikh of Kuwait two copies of the Draft Oil Agreement which they hope to get His Excellency r s approval to in due course.

Sah 1 U— 7/4/3' V s r,v ' r i uUm r in the Persian dulf, B u s li i r e Kuv/ait Intelligence Sxnamary for March 1934 (up to 7th April )• Sir / V ISc ) In continuation of my confidential Ko.G-89, dated the 5th March 1934, I have the honour to forv/ard my Intelli gence Summary for the month of March, together Y/ith 4 spare copies for distribution by you, (a) I am sending one copy of this to Jedda, one to Bahrain and one to Army Headquarters, Simla, as' recently directed by you^ (b) As from 15th April next, according to instructions received under your No»189—S, dated the 1- ^ ^ „ , - l shall combine the Kuwait Agency Diaries with my Intelligence Surnmaries, and submit the latter fartnightly* (c) As several items of interest (notably rain) have occurfed early in April, I am including news up to 7th April, j in this* TT^UIli (a) Reference my Summary for February CG~89, dated 5th March) and para 1(a)• On S7th March excellent and very heavy rain in the shape of a small cloud burst fell on tHe Dhahar ridge 12 milesM south of Kuwait. The area affected was about 20 square miles only. (b) On 28th and 29th March there was a very remarkable I J I —renarkable dust-storm over the whole of Kuwait principality which in parts was so thick, as to resemble a London fog at i its worst* His iSxcellency the Shaikh who was out hunting together with many Bedouin coming up to Kuwait lost their way completely, and were unable to make f/6 Kuwait for SO hours. Eleven motor cars carrying passengers to various Spring camps of Kuwait residents in the South were also fog- bound for a day and night. (c) Following the dust-storm a depression which seems to have formed somewhere in the direction of JAUF Oasis started moving towards the Batin region and reached the Bay of Kuwait on 1st April. There was violent thunder and lightening throughout the night of the 2nd,and day of 3rd April, which culminated in a widespread downpour of rain. This lasted the best part of 15 hours. The depression then moved South-SIast into the Persian G-ulf and apparently again struck the Arabian shore at Bahrain where the Royal Air Force reported stormy weather and rain on 7th April. (d) The whole of the Northern and Central portion of Kuwait got copious rain, but the extreme southern border got nothing, nor as far as can be gathered did North Hassa or any part of Bin Saud's territory in the interior. Kuwait Town's share was 47 cents, but very much more fell in the interior especially to the 3&gt;jorth and ./est of the Principality (e) The above 'Blessing of Ck)d n ,to use the language of of the Bedouin, has been/the greatest value. xi .uwait Principality has now got all it Y^rants and the wild grasses such as 'arfaj', 'Hassi' and rr Hamth n are everywhere coming out in profusion. Though the above rain is abnormally late it has come just in time to save the grazing which every where was shrivelling and drying up aftei only 1% growtn. It is novY expected that before the Summer heat finally comes on, the Desert hay crop and wild grass will have reached an average height of at least a foot, which will safely see the Nomad population through the coming Summer.IM,® - 3 - (f) The interior of Nejd from all accounts lias had no rain at all, and the prospects of the Bedouin there are bad indeed. (g) Hassa Province got a small fall of rain on 5th March, according to reports received from an Imperial Airways pilot, but this is said to have only touched the fringe of the trouble, | and was confined, as far as one can ascertain, to a few miles of the coastal region between Jubail and Q,atif. Inland there was nothing. (h) for a person who has not lived in the desert and amoiig the Bedouin of Arabia, it is difficult to imagine the delirious joy with which the above rain was greeted by the Nomad population, with their vast flocks of sheep and herds of camels* A sense of joy, well being and hope in the future, today pervades the whole countryside and affects the Town population equally v/ith the Desert. (i) According to old established custom^ ttie writer called on the Ruler on 5th April and congratulated him on the rain, and the ^Blessing 1 * y /hich God had vouched on his country and people. (j) The next two months should see the cost of butter, wool, meat, firewood and the necess^ities of life generally come down with a run. At the time of writing the following tribes (Kuwait and Nejd) are located as under, (a) Kuwait Nomads. (Araibdar and Fidawiyeh), under the Amir Haif bin Hajraf (Ajman) are camped in the North-West comer of the Principality and are scattered over the regions known as Um al liadafa and Um as-Shaham. They drink from 'Khabaris' (lakelets) -y^iich have everywhere formed as a result [ of the rains of 2nd and 3rd April. (b) AwAZILI. (Followers of Ibn Jama, Ibn Khafra, ibn Atrama, Rai al Fahama) are practically all camped ILast oi ohe Jahara-Safwan road. North of the Bay of Kuwait. A few of theirI vifi tt of their shepherds are on the Liyah region, about Idairat al- Hamth and Idairat al-Husskin. The tribe is in strength, and is closely concentrated for all eventualities, as a result of persistent rumours that Bin Saud has suffered defeat {6^4,34) in Yemen. They drink from Urn Niga and ^lOaabaris'. (o) Bi^HI KHALID# (Ahl al Jarriya) under Ibn ilendil, are camped at Ha\mia (H..W•Kuwait) » They drink from rain pools. Another party of Bani Khalid, under Shaikh Abdul liuhsin bin Muhanna al IQiazar of ^atif, moved up from the Kuwait Neutral Zone on S5th March and camped on 31st March on the Dhahar, 15 miles South of Kuwait, (d) MUTAIR« (Ilwah and ./asil) • Many sections of this tribe are concentrated immediately East and West of the Batin valley from near Jarishan to Hafar. In Kuwait territory proper, their locations are as follows: Mohamed al Badr - Hauma Mag id al Asgar - Aglat ibn Si gal Riddan as Snr - Al Shiggaq Al Fuqm - Northern End and Shaqq(Dikakf Faisal al Shiblan (Jiblan) - Manaqish in Shaqq Shuqair ibn Shugair - Al Shaqq (Gahlula) LFOTK. (i) -■aif al i-aziad (official leader of the Mutair 4 Ilwa] with Al Humaidi ibn Faisal al Duwish, are still at Artawiyeh in Hejd. (iil Musharl al Musaiyis , leader of the fT Wasil n group (Braih) is reported to be still at the Southern end of the Batin near Thamami (close to the Dahana belt of sand). {ej PA ^ atda . A considerable number of this tribe, which prior to the rise of 'Akhwanismf were considered as belonging properly to Kuwait, but who migrated in 1921 to Hejd, and settled down with the Mutair and became good Akhwan, have now returned to Kuwait under their shaikh Ibn suwailim. and are now camped close to and in company-5- ny . | (*9 company with tlie various Matair sections in Kuwait territory. They openly say they have done with Bin Saud and have returned to their old Shaikh and country for good. and ;t ZA3 n &gt; Llany tents of these two un important tribes (the former of which is an offshoot of Bani Khalid and so 'Bherif') have also entered Kuwait in the wake of the Mutair. They are camped close to the Bani IQialid under ibn Mendil (7.4.34.). (g) AJMM ) SBMMAR ) ■ No change. EARB ) GOLI-HIIT (1) xjw S will be seen from para II of my last Summary for February (C-89, dated the 5th March) the . -utair , ^v/azi li , : eni Klialid , ^dwan, ^ab and ^.. - (Bin auc. * s tribes) have been forced to come up to Kuwait frcm Hassa and Nejd because of complete lack of grazing in their om country. (S) Numbers of the above are now drav/ing their supplies from Kuwait Town, although their Shaikhs prefer to remain in the background, lest their presence in Kuwait be reported by Bin Saud 1 s spies and they get punidied later. (.3) By Arab custom, the Shaikh of Kuwait, could not, even if he so desired, refuse grazing to outside tribes forced by scarcity to enter his country. (4) In the opinion of the writer. Bin Saud r s tribes will be unable to return to i .ejd this season unless rain falls within the next 3 weeks or so. To do so would be to court disaster for their camels and sheep. (a) For the Blockade situation generally, see para III of Kuwait Intelligence Suramary for February (Despatch C~89, dated the5$M March),, (b) Tribal 'Musabilah' is being carried on with Kuwait, by those Hejd tribes who are camped in Kuwait, and no one is preventing them, let alone Bin Saud*s Blockade Officer, Hamud al Bagaawi. The latter is apparently confining him self to trying to prevent caravans going from Kuwait5 - 5 ■ from Kuwait across the Nejd border; but blockade running is on the increase and a marked deterioration in the measures taken to stop the traffic has set in. This, no doubt, is due to the Bin Saud - Yemen troubles, which have demoralized in large measure the King T s officials along the Northern frontierJj (c) On the 25th March the writer met Hamud al Bagaawis wife travelling with two other women in the desert, and had an interesting talk with her on matters to do with blockade. She had been staying with the Amir liaif ibn ajraf, and was returning to her husband after a lengthy absence. (d) It is reliably reported that the aged Faisal ibn Shuqair {uncle of Trahib, the Shaikh of the section) desiring || to put himself right with Bin Saud Ma bringing the Jerriya Mutair into Kuwait, recently proceeded to Hiath, and got a telegram sent to the King from there, to the effect that the Mutair had entered Kuwait purely because tT death n lay behind them and l^e 'Al Eaya' (the Bedouin equivalent for life) was in the North. The King replied at once, also by telegram that he had no objection to the whole of the Mutair doing so, as well as other Hassa tribeSo (Authority; The wife of Shaikh Hiddan as Sur of the Suwara Section of the Mutair, who, on behalf of her husband visited the writer on 25.3.34 and again on 7.4®34)» This is satisfactory as far as it goes. (e) A carious but unconfirmed report reached Kuwait on 20th March to the effect that the ^raq Government had appointed a certain Shammar tribesman named &gt;aaaid a 1 ^haiiL..o.ij to try and deal with certain f Iraqi smugglers, who, with great boldness were conducting their operations between Kuwait, Kerbela and Nejef. It was said that Sudair had been given the equi valent of Rs#5,000/- per annum, and had to produce and main tain a party of 60 horsemen and camelmen with the money. It/ i ►I iIt was further said that in the first engagement which he had with smugglers his party had been roughly handled, and scattered, while he himself ('Sudaid') had been severely wounded in the thigh. The writer personally thinks the story is a mytii. Y.'VlbITQRS&gt; The following prominent and other tribal visitors called at the Agency during the period under review: On 10.3,34, Shaikh Ali bin Ajjil as Saadmu He said he was camped near Bussaiya m -Uciq with his family* In course of conversation he voluntarily preferred the opinion that the 1 Iraq Govemioent would have difficulty in enforcing conscription among their tribes* He hoped they would be wise in time and make their Conscription La?/ only apply to the Towns and allow the tribes to oe called up irregularly in time of war as the Turks method was- On 11*3.34* Shaikh Hiddan as 3ur of the buwara Section of the ..Aitair tribe. He confirmed the report (para 71(12) of February Intelligence Summary, 0-89, dated 5*3.34) that the camels of the King's Asir force had been sent back 5 marches to graze. This had given rise to the report that Bin Saud hao. deprived the army of means of retreat. He reported that the survivors of Faisal al Saaiyid* s party which is said to have attacked the ImamYahya's troops (para Y (4) to (IS) of February Intelligence Suoamary) during peace negotiations had had their heads and beards shaven ofi oy Lin Saud as a punishment for their zeal. j-his confirms that the story as then related had some foundation in fact, but no doobt it was a smaller affair than first reported. On 13.3.34. nbdulla bin Junaifa r bin ilawela (A.-jman) He reported that a letter had been secretly received (on 8*3.34) from Ibn^Iiunaiichar, the head of the ikjman forces in Asir by^ nis brother, camped near Sarrar in Hassa. me letter was Y/ritten from tT xJiamis - usliait - Southeast of Sbha and was to following effect: 'There had been no fighting to date, out troops were hungry, camels had been sent to rear by tbe ICing 1 s orders, ne warned his family to tell all Ajman leaders in Hassa not to scatter, but to concentrate and keep in close touch, as the future sC full of dangers* That if Bin Saud went to war and was defeated, there would be trouble on a large scale throughout i.ejd, as every man's hand would be against his neighbour' ^ _ The visitor also reported that his brocherOn 17»3^34» On 10.5.S4, On 31.3.54:. On 25.3.34. brother had Just returned from Hiath where on his attempting to see the King and pay his respects, he had been insulted by Ibrahim ibn Jumaia, the king's Chamberlain and told that Kuwait Ajman, who were friends of Colonel Dickson, were not wanted in Riath; that he had repaired to the house of oaud al i^rafa (half brother to the lling) whose mother was an Ajman lady, and had been well treated there. (The bringing, in of my name was clearly an invent ion). Shaikh Abdul Huh sin bin Muhanna al IQiazar a senior Shaikh of the Bani Khalid, ac companied by two other chiefs, and his L son'! He said they had been forced up froml Qatif to Kuwait owing to scarcity of rain 1 and grazing. .:ote. This shaikh's daughter is married to| Shaikh Abdulla al Isa of Bahrain. The Lady n Amsha tT , wife of Shaikh Hazza ibn Badr, one of the leading Shaikhs of the Mutair and close relative of the late j ifaisal al Duwish. She paid a second visit on 1.^4.34. The Lady ,t V7adtha Tt , sister of the late Faisal al Duwish, paramount Shaikh of the Mutair. She was accompanied by the Lady n Wasmiyeh n wife of Shaikh Mohamed al Badr al Dushan, i a clever and entertaining person. The Lady Sarah, wife of Shaikh Ridden as- Sur of the Suwara Section of the Mutair. She called again on 8.4.34. NOTSU: 'he visits of the above 3 ladies were made in secret (b). ana much valuable information was obtained from them of the Yemen war situation, and of the views generally of the leaders of the Mutair and their allies the Ataiba with regard to Bin Saud 1 s distant operations. As the ladies also expressed anxiety lest their presence in Kuwait be later reported to the King and their menfolk be punished, it is requested that readers of this Summary be particular to make no mention of the fact to any person who might be the innocent means of getting them into trouble at some future date. As they aptly reioarked, n Bin Saud* s ears are long n . VI. FPU G.-L TOUit^. (a) On the 17th March, 21st March and again 25th March the writer made extensive tours of the area west and iiorth— West of Kuwait with the special object of visiting the Hassa and Nejd tribes who had entered Kuwait territory (See para III.above). (b) The last of these tours took him all over the_ Q i vL (! over the Liyah. - l-ikaka - _mvm, and U31 al ■..adafa area (c) The Gamps of the following leading Imtran, Bani Khalid, Rashaida and Ajinan Shaikhs were visited: 1. Ma J Id al Asgar (Mutair) Ridden as Sur ' Farhan ibn iChudhaiyir (Kuwait I.utair j Al Jazi (Mutairi wife of the late Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait)• I S # Saleh al Nimran Addas al Nimran Ibn sy /elim 3o Ibn l-endil 4. Haif bin 'lajraf Nahar al l.utalaq.im Obeid al Lutalaq.im (Rashaida) (Bani Khalid) (Ajman) (d) Liany Awazim, Adwan, ^ab, Rushaida and Mutair tents were seen, as. well as a few 3bei, Q,ahtan and g^ 00 ! tribes men. In fact the writer has rarely seen such a mass concentration of Bedouin in Kuwait# (e) All complained of the hardships they had undergone South, and all praised the grazing they had found in Kuwait. (f) Two things impressed the writer during these tours (which covered a distance of close on ^50 miles;• IvThe general nervousness of the i .ejd tribes^and the way they attempted to hide their identity by every means in their power: 2,The general underground tension and excitement which seemed to pervade the whole atmospnere. As regards (1): I learned fter both from the tribal ladies mentioned in para Y above and from the bhaikh of Kuwait tlat they thought I was about to order them (Nejd tribes) to return across the Southern border into rlejd again, and so every person attempted to escape my notice and hide the identity of his Chief or section by every known subterfuge. This would have been amusing had it not been sad. xxll had i clearly suffered at the hands of .bin Saud, and many showed signs of hunger and starvation, more especially the Mutair. They, one and all, certainly feared that I was about to evict them., I did my best to reassure them. As regards (2) above: Although my last tour among theseI )s - 10 these Nejd tribes was on 25th Ilarch, all of them appeared to be perfectly well a?/are that hostilities had broken.out between their master and Yahya in far off Yemen. This was the more straiige seeing that the official ne?7s only reached Kuwait on 26th March in the shape of a telegram from the Hon'ble the Political Resident who was at Bahrain, The effect of the news on the tribes was that the n smaller fry TT , almost under my eyes, began to close in on their Shaikhs tents, and the latter in turn to concentrate into groups; for example the Hutair, Rushaida, Adawin, Lab, Bani IQialid started grouping themselves in the .estern half of the Principality, along the Batin, while the strong Awazim (ene mies of the Mutair) started moving to the Eastern side of the | Kuwait-oafwan road. It was all very striking and quite patent that should Bin Saud suffer a serious reverse or ever go under the Nejd tribes vd.ll at once fly at each others throats and the days of the blood feud will once more prevail. ^Verily', as one Shaikh said, tT the Bedouins hand is against everyman, and everyman* s hand is against him'. And more than ever is it clear that Bin Saud's strong aim alone prevents 'chaos' among his people* /II. H-LAJb. .i i_&gt; -i-u x.-jiv-u-u.. . On 24th l.Iarch, The Shaikh of Kuwait received a mysterious and unsigned telegram from Baghdad to the effect that war had broken out between Bin Saud and Yahya and that the formers forces had invaded Yemen territory* On 26th March the Hon'ble the Political Resident from Bahrain informed the ?irri ter (quoting a telegram irom Jedda) that negotiations had been broken off between Bin Saud and Yahya. On 5th April the following telegram was received by the Shaikh of Kuwait from Ibn Muainmar, Saudian Minister at Baghdad, which in itself was curious as the Shaikh has never had correspondence or communication witb the person named:- 11 n- € ho ?&lt;0 person named: 'On date we have received a telegram from our relative m 'G-ovemment regarding the position dth Imam Yahya, which 'reads as follows:; 'Losing all hope of a satisfactory settlement with the Imam Yahya, His Majesty has given order to EUEUthe Amir oaud to advance and attack the forces of Yahya, Accordingly the iiiiiir Faisail bin ^aad advanced in the centre and in the direction of BAQIL and the iimir IQialid 'bin Mohamed towards_ (on the left)Hejran and Saada* There are no details of any 'battle as yet, but the Amir of Tlhamat Asir has moved at the head of a force to Harth (HARID) and God helped him to occupy that place- He proclaimed a general aimesty to the population who were pleased to offer their obedience and requested to be pardoned* 'God is our best recourse against those who kindle^ the fire of this insurrection- 1 Later news has it that H.H, the i&amp;iir Faisal bin Abdul Aziz has moved at the head of his force (right flank) along the coastal region of the Tihama, and now controls the situation there- His Highness the imiir Mohamed is on route from Riath with reinforcements for his brother H.H. the Amir Sa T ad t!! - The Shaikh of Kuwait told the writer that he would not be surprised if the above telegram portended a reverse. Til. .■'I OF BASRA 'JO ICUV/AIT. On the 26th March 1934 and taking advantage of the • Id Holidays, the Mutasarrif of basra, T'ahsin Beg All, aooompanied hy Dr.Ibrahim Akif -ilusi, Director of iiealth.Basrtfi Sami Beg, Accountant General Basra; xibdul ./ahab al liaama, Deputy Director of Customs; Abdul Jabbar Khaderi, merchant; Nuri Thabit, Journalist; Mr.Gabriel, Lawyer (Shaikh's), paid a purely private visit to Kuwait. The Shaikh who was in camp with his family placed his Palace at the disposal of the party. The Shaikh, it seems, did not invite the above guests in the first place, but in answer to an urgent personal message from the Mutasarrif that he would like to run down and see Kuwait, the Shaikh mswered that he was- 12 - f was welcome to do so, provided he came unofficially,. The Mutasarrif and.party left again on S8th March 1934, after mutual calls had 'been exchanged between him and the Political Agent * In the opinion of the writer, the Mutasarrif's visit had something to do with 'Iraq's anti-smuggling policy. The Mutasarrif certainly made ^ public remarks as to the unwisdom of accusing Kuwait, when his own country was entirely to blame. VTII &gt; OIL 1. (a) On 17th March the Shaikh reported that the .American Geologists working in Hassa had reached AL HAMTA wells 15 mile Southeast of 'NTA. They ?7ere moving from water to water and camping at each lot of wells for 7 and 8 days at a time. He said that he had heard that another party had gone South to Jabrin Oasis from Hoffuf. (b) The Representatives of the Kuwait Oil Company are at the time of writing still engaged in trying to get their concession out of the Shaikh* It is understood that matters are going as satisfactorily as can be expected, and it is hoped before very long that a pronouncement of a satisfactory nature will be made* In the meantime negotiations are carried on in very friendly mariner* (c) It is understood that what is holding up the final phase of the story is the Shaikh's insistence on having his own representative on the Board of Directors in London and his further insistence that the Company should pay him an export tax of 4 annas per every ton of Oil leaving the country The Company appear to be raising difficulties in the matter* States (d) The United/Minister at Baghdad paid a visit to Kuwait from 28th to 30th March* lie stayed with the Political Agent and while disclaiming any interest in Oil, put several pointed questions to Major Holmes regarding the 'Pied Line Agreement and Kuwait falling within the same*} ^ - 15 - gy (e; On 7th the writer learned that the G-erman Minister at Baghdad, and the vfrench Charge 1 d 1 Affaires, accompanied by their respective wives and the Hon*7 French Consul at Basra, hoped to visit Kuwait for two days on 7th and 8th April* Later&gt; In spite of a telegram being sent that there was no accommodation, the party arrived on 8th April, spent 6 hours in Kuwait and left again for Basra by car,. They were shown round the Town by the writer who was struck by their knowledge of the place and its history, and especially by certain pointed questions regarding Oil developments that were made by Dr.Grobba, the German liinister. (a) The Sastbound aircraft which arrived at Kuwait on 5th April was seriously damaged by a sudden and sharp squall which rising from nothing in a few seconds, struck her as she was refuelling on the ground. Her left top wing was badly ripped, before steps could be taken to get the machine head on to the wind. (b) A breakdown Hannibal arrived on the 6th April from Cairo with spares, mechanics, etc., but more material will have to be brought from London. (c) Passengers and mails were taken on to India by the relief (breakdown) aircraft after a delay of 24 hours, during which they were put up by the Political Agent and A.P.O.0# representative. (d) The damaged machine will probably be some 15 days in Kuwait, as the repairs to be done are extensive. (e) The Political Agent erected a large tent on the aerodrome for the party, placed the Agency at the disposal of the officers, as well as supplied blankets, bread,water, baths etc. etc. for the members of the crew.

J^BSL SHAI-mR And the Ibn Rasiiid dynasty of Hall now in abeyance&gt; Jebel Shammar is the Northern Province of Saudi Arabia, its capital Hail the focal point of the Shanmiar fribal Confederation, and was long ruled over by the A1 or Bani Rashid family, now scattered and living in exile. E # History, prior to the nineteenth century, of the Jebel Shanumr and its politics is raeagre. The ^-1 Sa'ud, the Boyal family of Saudi Arabia, maintain that the Ibn Rashid dynasty, rulers of Hail in the nineteenth century, were petty chieftains placed in power by them as the governing family of Jebei Shammar. However they came to power they were at least often rebellious and finally drove out the A1 Sa'ud, whose survivors fled to Kuwait. There they remained as refugees brooding over their fate just as the remainder of the Bani Rashid, now living under supervision in Saudi Arabia and scattered must do today; havlDg themselves been driven out in turn by the Ai sa'ud. It is concfeivable that the Bani Rasnid dynasty will one day be revived and rule again at Hail. 3. The Shammar Principality occupies a geographical position today of Increasing interest, situated as it is beneath what would be the shortest air route between Egypt and Kuwait or Bahrain. It is now too late and perhaps would be valueless, even if it were possible , to complete our information for the early years of the Rashid dynasty but it is not too late to fill in gaps which exist in more recent histroy. It is the object of this note to fill those gaps.Geographical and Statistical^ J\G.Lorimer* s ^Gasetteer of the Persian Grulfjpage 1732 and after of Volume II Geographical and Statistical' has a complete note on the country but no nap to show the extent of the Bani Hashid power at its greatest.

EVSNTS PHI OR TO AI^D TH3 SM) OF THB IBN RASHID RJLB AT HAIL 192U In the autumn of 1^20 Sam ibn Hashid, the Emir of Hail, who, under the skilful guidance of successive members of thB Subhan family, had emerged from the Great War unscathed and even with enhanced prestige, was suddenly- swept off his throne by assassination, and succeeded by his nephew, 'Abdullah ibn Mit'ab. Sa'ud^ chief adviser during the period immediately preceding his death bad been 'Aqab ibn 'Ajil a leading chief of the Shammar and also the Prince's father-in- law, who not only conducted the negotiations with the King Husain to a satisfactory conclusion, but also secured the retrocession of the Jauf district by the Sha'lan family, which had held it for the previous ten years» Outwardly all seemed well with the house of Rashid, which found some support in the pronounced sympathy of Miss Gertrude Bell and other British officials, both at Bagdad and in London, though there was no wish on the part of the British Government to jeopardise the established good relations with Ibn Sa'ud by any outward manifestation of smympathy with his rival. Inwardly, however, the affairs of Jabal Shammar were far from prosperous^ In spite of some gains from the contraband trade which had been carried on during the War, the people of Hail had on the whole been ruined by the blockade, and the Shammar tribesmen found their freedom of movement considerably restricted both by the imposition of some sort of control on their former free access to the desert 'ports'* like Najaf and Samawa, and by the ever-present threat of Wahhabi marauders. Townsmen and tribesmen alike clamoured for the old peace and security, whose absence was naturally imputed to the Government, and a considerable section of public opinion began to form roundlift) ~ 2 - round 'Abdullah ibn Talal, who was, in fact, the senior member of the dynasty, being a great-grandson of Talal ibn ♦Abdullah, who tod reigned from 1847 to 1868» An accident precipitated developments. Sa'ud had sallied out, as the Princes of Arabia are wont to do, forapicnic in the environs of Hail, and with him went the elite of the town, including •Abdullah and the other princes of the royal house. In the course of an impromptu shooting match, the ruling Prince had presumed to rally his cousin on his lack of skill as a marksman; and ♦Abdullah's next mark was his sovereign's head. H© missed not, but he was himself immediately cut dovm by Sa'ud 1 s slaves, and the throne of Hail passed to 'Abdullah ibn Mit'ab, who, in the interests of his am security, threw the assassin's brother, Muhammad, into the castle dungeon. The aim of the reformers had gone awry, and Hail, instead of having a strong and capable monarch, was again the prey of a weak regime. Meanwhile Ibn Sa'ud was watching the situation from the south, and there were not wanting well-meaning citizens of Hail who sent messages to him encouraging him id come and put an end to their intolerable situation. He himself was perhaps actuated by other motives, and political developments in 'Iraq had as much to do with the speeding up of operations against Hail as the desire to eliminate Ibn Rashid. Sharifian encouragement of the latter could be safely ignored so long as it emanated from Mecca, but the situation began to look more serious when British policy ?7as seen to be trending in the direction of the es tablishment of a Sharifian regiriB also in Iraq. With support on both flanks and British goodwill in the background. Hail might well become once more a serious danger to Wahhabi interests. Ibn Sa'ud hesitated no longer. His troops, under his brother Muhammad, moved up into the north, while the Ikhwan levies, under Faisal al Duwisn, operated in the4./ (f^J llrf 5 - in the eastern desert, and Nuri Sha'lan supported the movement with pressure on Jauf and the northern districts. These movements were launched during the spring of 1921, by which time the Conference convened at Cairo by Mr.Winston Churchill, who had now becorae responsible for the fate of the British mandated territories as Secretary of State for the Colonies, had definitely decided that Faisal, the third son of King Husain, should proceed to ♦Iraq as a candidate for its throne with all the backing of the British Government. In April the only serious obstacle in the path of such a policy was removed by Sir Percy Cox 1 s summary deportation of Saiyid Talib al Naqib, who was at this time Minister of the Interior in the provisional Government set up by Sir Percy Cox in October 1920, after the rebellion. And in June Faisal duly arrived at Basra in a British transport, while the so« called plebiscite to ascertain the views of the people of Iraq shortly afterwards confirmed Mr^hurchill* s view that Faisal would be an ideal King for the mandated territory. How Faisal was already flirting with the Shammar, who during these few months bad been drifting down from the troubled and profitless deserts of their own country to the greater peace and plenty of the Euphrates' marches, vshere they were not only warmly received by the king-elect, but also provided with arms, money and provisions for the maintenance Of a guerilla campaign against the slowly advancing army of the Wahhabis. Faisal was doing what he could to help his father's cause and to perpetuate an effective balance of power in the desert, and, while he was not outwardly encouraged in this policy by the British authorities, his actions did not pass unnoticed by the representatives of Ibn Sa'ud at Baghdad, who at this time were engaged in discussing ?/i th Sir Percy Cox the preliminaries of an agreement fir the fixing of the frontiers between the Wahhabi domain and theand the two states of 'Iraq and Kuwai t» Their reports made Ibn Sa^d realise that he eould no longer afford to play the tortoise in the race for Arabian hegemony; the consolida tion of Faisal's position in 'Iraq might well 'be followed by the creation under the veiled auspices of Great BriMn of an anti-Wahhabi league embracing the whole of northern Arabia above an arc joining Mecca and Basra. The position seemsd to him so serious and urgent that he took the field in person in July, after the successful termination of a conference at Riyadh, in the course of which he had been acclaimed by the Wahhabi chiefs and •Ulama as Sultan of Najd and its Dependencies. Himself remaining the Qasim, he sent forward two detachments respectively under nis Brother Muhammad and his son Sa'ud to begin the siege of Hail and to harry the countryside and guard against possible attacks by the Shanmar elements sojourning in 'Iraq. Meanwhile he himself received a deputation of the citizens of Hail, and made it clear to the members thereof that he intended to press the campaign vigorously unless they were prepared to accept his sine qua non condition that the Rashid dynasty should abdicate forthwith and its members surrender their persons to him. The deputation withdrew crestfallen, and the proffered terms were refused by 'Abdullah ibn Mit'ab, but the latter was not destined to hold his throne for long. The situation in the north, where Nuri Sha'lan had seized Jauf, demanded immediate measures of relief, and in his extremity he had released from prison Muhammad ibn Talal, the brother of the slain assassin of Sa'ud, to place him at the head of a force intended for the recovery of Jauf. The latter had now returned to Hail determined to assert his right to the throne against his weak and vacillating cousin, and Abdullah, deeming discretion the better part of valour, fled to fling himself on the discretion f-5- ||j discretion of tiie WahJiabi invader, usiio took him dom to Riyadh, where he has sojourned in captivity to this day. Meanwhile the more vigorous Muhammad ibn Talal, being recognised as ruler of Hail, began to take the offensive against the Wahhabis, and Ibn Sa f ud once more set forth from his capital to crush the new movement before it should assume dangerous proportions. Faisal al Buwish was sent forward with 2000 of his Mutair to watch the movements of the Shammar forces, which had moved out to the neighbourhood of Jithamiya and Taisiya to meet the enemy, Faisal was not in sufficient strength to launch an attack on Muhammad's superior positions, and the two armies remained facing each other until September 8th, when Ibn Saud himself arrived at Baqa'a just in time to receive the news that Muhammad had made a surprise assault on Duwish, lut had been beaten after a fight of considerable severity. The Wahhabi Sultan hurried up to complete the discomfiture of the enemy, who had taken refuge in various forts of the neighbourhood; and at dawn he opened on them with his guns, while his men advanced to the assault. Muhammad ibn Talal and his bodyguard fled by way of Jabal •Aja to Hail; and the forts surrendered after a short bombardment. The battle was over almost before it had begun, and Muhammad ibn Talal offered to submit on condition that he should remain ruler of the province under the suzerainty of Ibn Sa'ud# Such a condition was unacceptable to the Wahhabi Sultan, who now made the necessary dispositions for the siege of the city, in which a considerable party was sympathetic towards him and promised to work for early surrender if he would desist for a while from bombardment, II while the Shammar ruler wrote to Baghdad imploring the mediation of the British Hi^i Commissioner and of Faisal, who had been crowned King in August. Some weeks later Ibn Sa^d,- 6 - ikk f Sa'ud, tiring of inactivity, sent a message to his supporters in the city informing ttiem tliat, as he had already allowed them plenty of time to arrange matters according to their promises, he proposed to begin a bombardment in three days 1 time if it had not surrendered in the interval. Without further ado the gates were opened, and a force sent by Ibn Sa'ud had no difficulty in occupying the town, thou^i Muhammad ibn i Talal shut himself up in the great fort to stand a siege or to parley, as circumstances might dictate. After a brief exchange of messages, and on Ibn Sa^d^ guarantee of his personal immunity from all ill treatmait , he decided to surrender on November 2nd, 1921, yfom the siege had lasted rather less than two months. Like his immediate predecessor, he was sent to sojourn in honourable captivity at Riyadh, and with him ended the rule of the Hash ids, after a chequered though sometimes brilliant career of close on ninety years, during which thirteen members, representing five generations of the family, had occupied the throne.

A glance at the map will show that iiail is a place of some strategical importance in northern Arabia, since it is on the flank of any force moving fran either in the direction of Iraq or Palestine * trans Jordan.
