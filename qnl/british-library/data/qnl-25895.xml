It would be unwise uo expect gratitude for tardy supply of wheat v/hen we have many times broken promises to supply goods almost as important. t And we should be asking Iranian Government to amend regulations in order to export for the benefit of a belligerent importer goods of which there is shortage in Iran, . . 2.

General ' Officer Commanding Basra s request for 14 miles of piping from Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]. Anglo-Iranian Oil Company headquarters confirm that plenty of piping should be available at Kirkuk end at Khaniqin. In present changed circumstances in Iraq it may be possible for General Officer Commanding Basra to obtain his requirements from these sources. This depends mainly on whether through rail communications has now been re-established between Kirkuk and Basra, 2. Failing this, enquiries 'light be made whether piping is available in Bahrein. If so, we would be prepared to ask California Standard Oil Company to telegraph to Bahrein requesting that all possible facilities be provided. 3. If these suggestions come to nothing, best course seems to be for you to approach Iranian (Persian) Government and request them to assist His Majesty’s Government by permitting the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company to lend required piping to His Majesty's Government, on the understanding that it will be replaced as soon as possible by imports into Iran of similar material. Alternative arrangement might be that His Majesty’s Government would compensate Company direct for the material required. 4* I realise that course proposed in preceding paragraph would not be sufficient to overcome the objections which you have pointed out, and there is also the objection that Iranian Government might be unwilling to expose themselves to charge of unneutral conduct in thus helping the forces of a belligerent. On the other hand, Iranian Government have no hesitation about asking for British assistance when they require it, e.g. regarding wheat, and I see no reason why His Majesty's Government should not ask them to agree to a transaction like this.

Government of India, while realizing the diffi culties, recommend the proposal. 2. Much as I wish to assist operations [gr.omit. ?in] Iraq I feel unable, without your express instructions, to ask Iranian Government to allow export, for the follow ing reasons: 1) Quota of Anglo-Persian Oil Company exports which is always giving trouble has been filled for this year, 2) Anglo-Persian Oil Company state that v/hile material is surplus to present programme it is not surplus to eventual requirements, 3) Anglo-Persian Oil Company recently refused some piping for a local water supply, 4) Owing to the war Iran is short of all steel goods and would demand first claim to anything Anglo-Persian Oil Company declared surplus. 5) If Anglo-Persian Oil Company could be represented as serving as source of supply for British forces in Iraq it would play into the hands of the enemy who [groUndec.T that the very existence of our oil concession, in which Mis Majesty T s Government hold large share, is unneutral. As it is, I understand that the Company are privately supplying small articles but if this became known, still more if we asked for material on a large scale, it would have very unfortunate effect. 3. Anglo-Persian Oil Company believe that there is plenty of piping available at Kerkuk. 4. I am sending General Officer Commanding interim ; reply by telegraph and copy of this telegram by courier.
