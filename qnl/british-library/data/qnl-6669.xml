In August 1010 the Sec rotary of State laid before Council a note (P. 3839/1 0&gt; prepaied m the 1 olitical Pepartnient, giving information as to existing relatjons between the Government of India and the Horne Government in relation to Persia follows 1 :— &gt;1Cy aU&lt; er,SUU1 expen(1,ture - 1 he uote described the general position as “ 1,1 im tlicGovernmerit of India described Anglo-Indian interests in Persia as commercial, political, strategical and telegraphic. Much of the British tiade, particularly m the south and east, is with British India, while the north and west avenues of entry are devoted in the main to commercial connections with the British Isles. The political interests of Great Britain m 1 ersia, which, at their revival a century ago, .were mainly Indian in inception, are still largely Indian in character. The strategical interests aii Bom conditions with which India is most intimately concerned, and in recent years Persia (and especially Southern Persia) has assumed a stialegical importance in relation to British India which tends to increase rather than diminish. The telegraphic interests may lie said to be equally divided between the mother-country and India. The Consular officers in Southern Persia (and at Meshed) are, by agreement with the Foreign Office, members of the Indian Political Department, and in their political capacity report to the Government of India.” 2. In paragraph 242 of the Report of the Indian Expenditure Commission v 1900), better known as the “ elby Commission,’ the following opinion was expressed The two Governments are not agreed as to the extent of their ‘‘ respective interests in Persia. It is, in our opinion, desirable to adopt a general principle of division which will put an end to these discussions. Both countries have admittedly a large interest in Persia, and we think that the charges of the Mission “ and Consulates should be evenly divided between the two countries.” The reason why this principle was applied to diplomatic and consular expenditure only ivas presumably because there was at first no other charge necessitating a division. From 1890 to 1900 India had contributed a moiety of the Karim subsidy (2,000?. per annum), but, on the recommendation of the Welby Commission (Report, para graph 24b), the whole subsidy was, after 1900, defrayed from Imperial revenues as a set oft to the Baghdad-Basra mail subsidy paid by India. 3. Since 1900 the principle of equal division has repeatedly been put into practice. Apart from interest-bearing loans to a very considerable amount, in all of which we took our share, we have frequently contributed towards expenditure forming uo part of the “charges of the Mission and Consulates,” e.g., ?1) we paid half the expenses of the British section of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission, and even shared in the compensation paid to the Secretary to the British Commissioners (a Foreign Office officer) for injuries sustained while on duty; (2) we have shared the monthly advances made to the Persian Government under the so-called “ Moratorium ” scheme, and also (3) certain payments made to the British Minister at Tehran for secret service purposes ; and (4) we have contributed to various subsidies paid to different individuals aud tribes in Persia, both before and during the present war. 4. The question of the incidence of Persian charges was carefully, re-examined in 1917 in connection with the cost of the South Persia Rilles and of the Seistan Levy Corps. It was exhaustively discussed in a Memorandum prepared by the Financial Department of the India Office (dated the I5th September 1917), of which a copy is annexed to this Note. The conclusion reached was that, while the cost of the levies raised in Seistan was properly chargeable to Imperial revenues, as forming part of expenditure on military operations in Persia, 1 the cost of the South Persia Rifles, of subsidies and loans during the war,'and of secret service expenditure, bo 1 Under the terms of the Parliamentary Resolutions of November 1914, Imperial Revenues bear ail the extraordinary ' charges of Indian troops employed on military operations out of India.fir as not required for purely military purposes, should be equally divided.

Certain other cases not directly covered by the above decisions have since come up tor consideration, e.g .i T 1 (\) Relief measures at Shiraz, Meshed, Tehran and Ilamadan. In each case the Secretary of State in Council has agreed to bear half the cost, m The construction of the Bunder Abbas-Kerman road and telegraph hue. 1 he Secretary of State in Council has proposed to the Foreign Office that an outlay of 60,0002. on the former, and of 50,0007. on the latter, should be equally shared between the British and Indian Exchequers. f&gt; On the question of principle, the following note was recorded by the late Secretary of State (Mr. Chamberlain) on the 22nd June 1916 “I have no doubt that they \i.e. 9 the Wei by Commission] intended future Persian charges to be settled on the half-and-half principle,^ though some existing charges were balanced against one another .... f lhis war and our recent Experiences have demonstrated more clearly than ever before that nothing which touches Persia is alien to India . . . . “ The true and the only ground for such subsidies, and one which is quite conclusive in the present case, is that it is of primary importance to India that Persia should be sufficiently well governed to prevent her from becoming a danger to India through Afghanistan. “ Anyone who reads the draft Mesopotamian Blue Book or who has followed the ^constant pre-occupation of the Indian Government as to the repercussion of Persian events on Indian security will, I feel sure, admit the force of this argument. Its force is especially manifest in times like the present ; but if India be so deeply concerned in Persian politics in a crisis, it cannot wash its hands of Persian charges the moment the crisis passes. Were it not for India, we should not to-day have a man in Persia or up the Gulf, and India is fortunate in her bargain. “ I would therefore accept half charges.” Po! aTICAL DePARTM ENT.

The Welby Commission proposed a principle of equal division, which was put into practice from 1900 onwards. In 1917 the issue of Persian charges was re-examined in relation to the costs of the South Persia Rifles and the Seistan Levy Corps respectively (the cost of the former was divided equally, whilst the latter was deemed chargeable to Imperial revenues).The note goes on to cite other cases that have recently required consideration: relief measures in Persia and the construction of the Bunder Abbas-Kerman road and telegraph line. In both cases the Secretary of State in Council proposed that the expenses be divided equally.The note concludes with a quotation from a note recorded by the former Secretary of State for India [Joseph Austen Chamberlain] on 22 June 1916, accepting the principle of half charges.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Political and Secret Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>South Persia Rifles</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commission on Indian Expenditure</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Seistan Levy Corps</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Expenditure</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00017e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
