I GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. D. 0. No. !)&amp;//£ Bahrain, November 4, 1939. n Dear .Veightman, Regarding Ranee’s suggestion about an armourer. I think we do need a second man who will be capable of dealing with the new guns. I should be obliged if you would ascertain whether an armourer acquainted with Vicars Berthier guns could be obtained and on what terms. Ranee’s statement about the man we have got no^ is incorrect. Yours sincerely, II. Weightman, Esquire, 1.0.S., H.B.M’s Political ^gent, Bahrain.OC Confidential D.O. No. C/726-1.a/43 Dated the 11th November 1939• Now that the Bahrain Government have 12 V*B, guns, the question arises of their proper care and maintenance. Obviously the armourer at present on the strength of the -ly and I understand that it will take months, if not a year, not, I fear, particularly likely that we can get one from India, but at least I think an effort should be made. If you 1( agree, would it be possible to enquire from the Defence Depart ment whether there is any prospect of getting hold of an amourer with experience of V.B. guns who is on the point of retiring or who has ^ust gone on pension who might be sent to us here in Bahrain to look after these guns ? If not could they advise us on the best plan to adopt ? Bahrain Police is incapable of carrying out this task effeetive- to train a man from Bahrain as a machine-gun armourer.

Indeed the cost of the armourer would in a comparatively short space of time exceed the whole cost of the V.B. guns which the Bahrain Government possess, and they would do better to wear out and write off two or three annually. 2. It seems that there are two possible alternatives now to be considered i- (i) That an armourer be engaged for the maintenance of the machine guns held by both Muscat and Kuwait in addition to Bahrain, and of those which will in due course be supplied for the Bahrain Defence Force (cf. paragraph 4 of External Affairs* telegram No. 364^dated the 6th February 1940)/ The cost could then beNshared by the four partners in this scheme. (ii) That, as I believe happens in Kuwait, the Iraq Command of the Royal Air Force be asked if they can arrange to send an armourer at specified intervals to !, service rt the Bahrain V.Bs.
