Alekseev called 'Predatory Plans of Iranian Reaction- 8riuS '’ lts firs1: in 8 series of articles dealing with Persian question. Full text has been b^adcast by Moscow radio and is doubtless available to you. Following is summary: 2. Article emphasises that fro, very first days of its existence Soviet State tried to establish friendly relations with Persia as witness its statements of January 1918 and June 1919, and Soviet-Persian Treaty of February 26th, 1 9 21 in all 0 f readiness to contribute to Persian political ana economic development as independent country. A rticle sdds that 1921 Treaty stm ^ ^ basis of Soviet-Persian relations and stresses that Soviet renunciation of her rights, privileges, etcetera was all the more important because it took place at time v/hon Persia was virtually under British occupation and /contributed2 contributed to her liberation and recognition as an independent state. 3. But instead of showing gratitude and following path of friendly relations with Soviet Union, ruling circles in Persia caine out with predatory claims to Soviet terri tory e.g. in Persian memorandum of March 1919 to Paris Peace Conference. Head of Persian Government at that time was Samsam -s Saltana who had made Treaty of Friendship between Britain and Bakhtaris in 1916 and had allowed British troops to occupy Persia in 1918 and to move across Persia to Baku and Ashabad. Persian memorandum claimed over 570 thousand square kilometres of territory including Azerbaijan, Soviet Armenia, part of Dagestan and Transcaspian Oblast as far north as Komsomolets Gulf and as far east as Amudarya. Article adds that these claims were not advanced without foreign encouragement and if realised would have deprived Soviet Union of oil. A. Although these claims were not oensidered at Peace Conference it was no accident that they were put forward, because certain Persian statesmen have always aimed at bringing Soviet Union into collision with other great powers in order to use situation to realise their pre datory plans against her. For instance Hakimi who was in Government in 1919 and who partly inspired its pre datory plans was Prime Minister in 1945 and until February 1946, and poisoned atmosphere of Soviet-Persian relations. Foreign agent Seid Ziya Ud Din who is trying /to- 3 - * ♦ to undermine Sovict-Persian relations and cause friction between Britain and Soviet dnion has also begun to play prominent part in politics. People like these who still have much influence on Persian foreign policy know they cannot achieve-their territorial aims themselves and are therefore trying to bring Soviet Union into conflict with other great powers. In 1941 when Germany attached Soviet Union Persian ruling circles began to intrigue with her and there was Chauvinist talk of seizing Soviet Azerbaijan and ether areas. All this calls for vigilance on part of Soviet Union towards these ruling circles and their plans, 5. Author says that in his next article he will deal with oil concessions in Persia which also clearly reveal foreign policy of Persian ruling circles and their atti tude towards Soviet Union.

A petition expressing the unanimous desire of Azerbaijan people to have the Red Army stay would be presented to Soviet Government. National Government, however, appears to be divided on this subject. &lt;3, Kurdist an. There is no reliable news from either Rezaieh or Mianduab* Gazi Mohamed has been in Tabriz for last ten days or so and it is thought he has not yet reached agreement with Jaafar Pishavari on demarcation of Kurdish and Democrat territories. Gazi Mohamed has acquired a jeep which flies the Kurdish flag. He is accompanied by Kurdish officers in uniform. 3. One source reports that Kurds have placed token garrison of 2 q men in Rezaieh but are leaving election of townof town Government to the Azerbaijani townspeople. Another traveller states that Rezaieh townspeople are daily expecting a clash between Kurds and Democrats. All the country round Rezaieh seems to be completely under Kurdish control. Omar Khan of Shikkak is named as Minister of War in Kurdish Government, with Rashid Beg Herki as Commander in Chief and Zero Agha as Commandant of Gendarmerie. Some gendarmes previously in Persian service are said to have enlisted under Zero and are paid 120 tomans per month. Kurdish patrols in Rezaieh wear arm-bands with 'Jumhoorieh Kurdistan' (Republic of Kurdistan) on them. Kurdish Government is said to have condemned to death Qaraini Agha, Ali Agha Ilkhanizadeh (Amir Asad) and three other chiefs for 'treachery'. Amir Asad is in Tehran. A certain Mahmudian, a Kurd from Mahabad who was always considered a Russian agent, is said to have been tried and shot by Kurdish court martial in Mahabad. 4. People's Army. Conscription is rousing bitter discontent in Tabriz. Pew oi those called up are responding voluntarily and Pida'isfsic] are arresting young men on the streets. Notice has now been published announcing that all those called up who do not report before February 26th. will be tried and punished as deserters. Most of those so far recruited are being sent to Maragha, no doubt to build up a garrison against possible advance by Kurds who claim frontier should be drawn North of Maragha, giving that town and Mianduab to Kurdish- 3 - Kurdish Republic.- Two lorry loads of Peopled Army soldiers, former members of Iranian garrison here who were recently sent in direction of Sain Qaleh, are said to have joined Iranian forces to the South.. 5* Russia n Affairs . Rumours about impending withdrawal of Red Army are increasing, but there are as yet no open signs of withdrawal. It is fairly reliably reported however that Soviet military authorities have warned the owners of certain of their hirings to be ready to receive back their premises and some repairs are being done to hired property. Russians are said to havu refused to hand over the railway to Democrats yet on grounds that as they received it from Persian Government they must refer to Moscow for a decision on Democrats’ claim to receive it. 6. Azerbaijan National Government have published laws providing for the division of State lands among peasants and for the seizure of all property in Azerbaijan belonging to persons who have fled from iizerbai jan and who are deemed to be carrying on activities inimical to present regime here.. nT „ PILE copy Wltk the Compliment r of tV’O . c^te.rv of state y n d©r for ^ u&lt; • - EXT 1811 J / ■ 12 MAR 1946 C4~ u ^ 0 5 1 jH .

I saw the Persian Prime Minister this evening and obtained Russian text of Persian protest dated March 3rd, the translation of which is contained in my immediately following telegram. The Prime Minister was very secretive about giving me this copy at the Soviet Government guest house and only did so on my assurance that its contents and the fact that he had given it to me would be regarded as strictly confidential. 2. The Prime Minister confirmed that he was leaving tomorrow morning, weather permitting. No agreement whatever had been reached and he did not disguise his disappointment over the results of nis visit here. The atmosphere at last night’s Kremlin dinner had been friendly but .according to him nothing new had passed. It is worth noting that 191-the communique reported in my telegram No. 855 docs not include the usual phrase to the effect that 6th March, 1946 Repeated to Tehran R. 11,15 p.m. 6th March, 1946.

The Prime Minister again emphasised that he had been shocked to find the Generalissimo looking so old. S. The Prime Minister told me, again in confidence, that he was having some difficulty over the communique. Molotov had sent him a draft, which he showed me, to the effect that during the Prime Minister's stay in Moscow conversations had taken place in an atmosphere of friendship and understanding that they would be continued through diplomatic channels when the new Soviet Ambassador took up his post shortly at Tehran. The Prime Minister sent back -an alternative draft saying that the conversations had taken place only in an atmosphere of friendship ('understanding' was omitted) end omitting all reference to continuing the conversations in T e hran. Instead his draft ended with a simple statement to the effect that the arrival of the new Ambassador would strengthen the friendship between the two countries. He was still awaiting Molotov's reactions but seemed to think that the Russians must accept this revised draft. It is of some interest in this connexion that the Daily Express correspondent, who interviewed the Prime Minister this afternoon, was asked by the Persian Delegation to c?.dd the word 'apparently' to the sentence 'conversations will continue in Tehran'. 4. I-5- 4* I asked the Prime Minister what he intended to do next. He replied that there would no doubt be Persian and Soviet conversations in Tehran, but concurrently with an appeal to the United Nations Organisation. Although he did not definitely i state that he intended to renew the Persian appeal, he left me with the strong impression that this was his present intention. 5. The Prime Minister asked me what we and the Americans would do to help Persia if the United Nations Organisation procedure, of which he seemed sceptical, failed to restrain the Soviet Government. He also asked whether we had yet had any reply to our note, which he still regarded more as an enquiry than a protest. I repeated that I could make no prophecies but that I did not need to remind him of our close interest in this problem, which had again been proved by [grp,, undec. ? our] note. I also told him of the American protest delivered today, of which he seemed unaware. He was interested and encouraged by this and also by Mr. Churchill T s speech yesterday. 6, In the course of a general conversation while I was waiting for the Persian Note to be copied, the following points emerged: (a) that the Russians had never given him any better reason for their refusal to withdraw Lgrp. undec. ? other] than that reported in paragraph o vbl of my telegram No. 893. (b) that(b) that the Russians had constantly referred to the 1921 Treaty and assured him with every appearance of sincerity that they really believed in a British threat to the seouritv of the Soviet^ Union. ^ The Prime Minister agreed with me that this was complete nonsense and said he had so informed the Russians* (c) The Russians had repeatedly complained that the Persians were discriminating against them about oil concessions and had complained bitterly of the privileges of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. (d) Although there had been no commercial agreement, the Prime Minister was sending today to Molotov, a long Rote setting out the Persian point of view on outstanding coramerical questions including the Persian demand for a settlement of Soviet financial obligations to Persia incurred during the war. (e) .Then I asked the Prime Minister what he thought of all the reports in yesterday’s papers (see my telegram No* 911) of our arming the tribes etc. in the south, he at once replied that they were complete nonsense. He was surprisingly critical of the Soviet press and of the Soviet conception of democracy. (f) He expected to §pond the night at Baku on the return journey and to reach Tehran on the 8th, before ehe dissolution of the Majlis. He made quite a point of this. But he naturally gave me no hint of any developments of the kind reported in paragraph 5 of my telegram N 0 . 909* Foreign Office please pass to Tehran and Washington as my telegrams Nos. 78 and Lgrp. undec.] respectively botn posts immediate. 1 Repeated toJTehran and Washington as telegrams Nos. 21U &lt;and 2169 respectively] OTP.o i E'j-.'x j 1734 -f [This telegram of particular secrecy and should he retained hy the'authorised reejipient and no-t. passed.-onl V .... .

They were told that there might be a press conference tomorrow (the implication being that the Russians would have to agree first) but that the Prime Minister was not well enough! to see them today. He would however answer questions sent in to him. The Prime Minister’s spokesman seemed rather worried about message already sent by one of the correspondents to effect that conversations had been friendly but difficult. 3. Prime Minister's replies to questions were as follows: (a) He was returning to Tehran on his own volition and not on instructions from Tehran. vl \ • (b} He could not say whether his visit had been successfulsuccessful or not. (c) Asked whether he thought friendly raltlons possible between Persia and Soviet Union, he said he wished for a firm and lasting friendship and would do his best to achieve it, but he crossed out an addition that he was hopeful of doing so. (d) To achieve the withdrawal of Soviet' troops from Azerbaijan had been one of the main purposes of his mission to Moscow but he had not be en successful. 4, Both correspondents had the firm impression that no agreement was possible before the Prime Minister’s departure and that his spokesman was very despondent. 5. Stories are circulating in foreign diplomatic and journalistic circles that at his talk with the Persian Prime Minister last night reported in .today s press, Stalin dangled before the latter the prospect of leading new regime in Persia at the expense of the Shah after the forthcoming dissolution of the Majlis, but I have no confirmation of such stories.

On the first day of calling up the Prime Minister addressed a meeting (at which a representative of [gp.^ undec. ?Russo] press was present) with a fiery speech in which he said that if Tehran Government tried to prevent Azerbaijan obtaining its freedom the people s army would march on Tehran, occupy it, overthrow the present Government and set up a democratic one in its place. 2. The Prime Minister’s speech was an effort to rouse enthusiasm for a big army which is highly_unpopular among the people. The National Government claim 15,000 men have already 'volunteered'*, but it is doubtful whether anyone has done so. Conscripts are, hov/ever, being collect ed though Minister admitted there is no money tp f e g^ or clothe them.

We should suggest rather that after the support given to Persia by the Security Council the Russians did not dare to violate the Treaty of 1942 and that if in fact Russians left because they secured a government favourable to them this would indicate blackmail * on the part of the Russians and subservience on the part the Prime Minister* 3.

Acting Prime Minister Has no news from Moscow and dees not know when the Prime Minister will return. Deputies are forever debating without coming to any conclusion. Many of them would like an appeal to be made to the Security Council but few are likely to have the courage to sign one. They cannot agree as to what, if anything, should be done to provide for representation of the people during the interval between March 11th and meeting of the 15th [grp. undoc. ?Majlis] # They are afraid to prolong their mandate and are divided about proposal to appoint temporary Council either from them or from outside. 2. Muzaffar Firouz covered himself with ridicule by calling the country to the microphone to hear announce ment that the Russians were leaving Semnan. Acting Minister agrees that it is injurious to the interests / erf- 2 - of Persia in this crisis to have no other official mouthpiece than this mountebank, hut lacks the authority to silence him* 3. If it should he found that the Prime Minister has signed some agreement inacceptahle to Persian public opinion, the Shah in the interval between Parliaments could dismiss him, and invite someone else to form a Cabinet but fear of the Russians is so great that he would hardly do this and if he did it would be difficult to find a candidate for the Premiership.

In February of 1944 he was Acting Minister of Commerce and Industry for a short while after the resignation of NAKRAl. He was Amoved from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in the summer of 1944 and remained without an appointment until vugust 194 when he was appointed Head of the Caspian Fisheries, a post which he still occupies. In June 1942 he was a member of the Hizb-i-; illiun, and was alt,o mixed up in another German plot involving awam us Saltaneh and the old Husain Ali araguzlu (not Monsieur Ala&lt;s brother-in-law, the son of the late hegent). C.I.C. I. distrusted him intensely. The opinion of Kis Majesty*e Ambassador was that he was obstructive to us, an incorrigible intriguer, and very corrupt even by Persian standards. He was assumed to be working for the Russians, with whom, as Head of the Fisheries, he is in close touch. In 1945 he was an active member of a committee to put «,avvam us Saltaneh in as Prime Minister. Now that they have succeeded he confidently expects the Commerce anu industry portfolio.

Educated at Harrow ano Cambridge, Speaks .ngliah and French J fluently, A man of excitable anu nervous disposition »vho gives full rein to his feelings and ideas in the newspaper Ha‘d-i-Imruz, which he owns and edits. All his political activities directed to one end - opposition to the present Shah whom he wishes to see removed as vengeance for the death of his father at the hands of the Shah’s father, the late Reza :-hah. His hostility has recently been sharpened by the fact that his wife’s mother, Israet, one of the wives of Reza fhah, was recently evicted from the Palace on a charge of improper behaviour. He was at one time employed in the Persian Legation in Washington whence, it is believed, he was removed at the request of the United States Government for abuse of diplomatic bag privileges. It was Muzaffar Firuz who went to Palestine and brought from there r&amp;iyid Zia’s first manifesto. He remained an ardent supporter of Saiyid Zia until May 1945 f when he broke with him. Be says the breach was caused by Saiyid Zia *6 becoming; more and more dictatorial; Saiyid Zia*s version is that they had to part because Muzaffar Firuz would not abandon his newspaper campaign against the Shah and f aiyid Zia felt that it was impossible to fight the Russians and the Shah at the same time. After this, Muzaffar Firuz tried to compose his differences with the Tudeh, meaning, he says, to break them later, but he railed, and towards the end of 194 5 he became one of the chief supporters of the cancidature of .awam al •altana to the premiership. As a reward for this the ..avvam, when he became premier, appointed Muzaffar Firuz ’’Political Under Secretary' (an office apparently created for the purpose) and Director of Propaganda (February 1946). Muzaffar Firuz is clever and can write well, but he is rash, unbalanced, dishonest, untruthful and maliciousi he would probably sacrifice anything to bring about the /downfallaovmiall of the tihah.

JJJ IMPORTANT ' - 0 - My telegram [grp* undec. ?256], It is all very well for Persian Prime Minister to tell us that he looks for our support but we shall expect more candour from him than he usually shows. Deputies who put him in power claimed to have been completely deceived by promises already broken. I am pretty sure that he never intended to take to Moscow two senior statesmen he mentioned to me but gave their names to divert suspicion* His Cabinet is the worst for ability and honesty that I have seen since the abdication of Reza Shah and his two chief henchmen are filling the key posts with* Tudeh nominees while Tudeh papers f cover His Majesty's Government with abuse. I am not sure that there is not a concerted movement against the Shah with Prime Minister's approval and while that is perfectly legitimate we must not be left in ignorance when the Prime nister is asking for our help 0 2. As you are aware I made to the Prime Minister, what I hoped were useful suggestions as soon as he came into power - TrU UNRRA utilisation of services of Economic and Social Council and possible method of dealing with a Russian demand for an 12 A fo&amp; o oil/....( S3) - 2 - oil concession and I shall continue as long as I am here to assist him if I think he is not working against the interests of His Majesty’s Government, Deputies fear however that he v/ill find pretext for staying way until Majlis mandate has come to an end a fortnight hence and will then rule by decree and rig the elections as Russians wish. Prime Minister might say this is only way of getting rid of Russians unless some outside influence can get rid of them and in fact it seems probable that unless Russians can be induced to leave Persia by pressure through Security Council they will exact from Persia in return for withdrawal a price which v/ill have permanent prejudicial effect on Persian and British interests.

Prime Minister mentioned to me Mansur, Samii (No. 199) and Dr, Shafaq, a Deputy, This might not have been bad,for though Shafaq is a coward and notoriously in favour of appeasement Mansur is able, and I think that though corrupt financially he is patriotic while Samti is honest, I gather from Mansur however that he is not TTp/r^isposed to attend a conference without an agenda and that *1 1 C FEB 19+6 N * ^O/zroF^ 0 ^ ' / in,,«,•SZ - 2 - in eny case he has not been asked. General Jahanbani (No. 103) however has been asked and he also is for concessions to the Russians at any price. 3. It is a bad sign that local press is becoming more and more anti-British partly by suppression of anti- Russian papers and partly because official Pars agency is publishing more and more Tass material. Local French paper gave Manuilski's accusations in full but omitted to give Mr. Bevin's reply. This behavious after defence of Persia by Mr. Bevin in the Security Council is typical of the Persian character. 4. One thing the mission will obviously have to give is retrospective permission for the Russians to bore for oil in North Persia. For the well near Tabriz they could produce the permission of the Azerbaijan Government but this would not cover boring near Shahi and probably at least one other point outside iizerbaijan. 5. There is a general impression that the Russians will leave by March 2nd. If they do it will be because they have secured from the Prime Minister what they want. Hence the Prime Minister’s decision to go to Russia before March 2nd. 6. Muzaffar Firouz who makes himself the Prime Minister s spokesman talks of concessions in Azerbaijan as essential because the Persian army is not in a fit state to restore order against Azerbaijan army as it consists largely of Red j,rmy soldiers from Soviet Azerbaijan.

At present he runs the country with the assistance ofliuzaffar Eirouz for whom he has created the post of Political Under-Secretary of State. Muzaffar Pifouz is also Director Generaljxf the Red Cross. Muzaffar Pirouz who is unbalanced and thereby unfitted for any position of responsibility is unfriendly and openly hostile to^ the Shah who I understand is highly displeased at the appointment. 2. Muzaffar Firouz read from Radio Tehran evening of February 10th proclamation by the Prime Minister suspending orders by which the Military Governor had limited the rights of political parties. Tudoh will of course gain by this as it is they who organised demonstrations for the purpose of intimidation. 5. General opinion is that no Cabinet that the Prime Minister is likely to collect would get a majority ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ - * ■ vote in the Majlis. Yazdanpanaah (No. 251) having refused/r ( 8 ^ : &gt; r 1133 - 2 - refused the Ministry of_^dr, the Prime Minister I hear wanted to offer the post to C. Ahmedi (Mo. 16) hut 'Russia^dfd not like this'. The newsjthat Cabinet appointments have to be approved by Russia has aroused apprehension among the^deputies. 4 . The Majlis unless prolonged will_come to an end with effect from March 12th. The deputies belonging to the former majority i.e. Conservatives want the Majlis to be prolonged until the new elections have^ been held and would like this to be proposed by the prime Minister, but they suspect tEat he wants to have an interval when he could govern without a Majlis and they may^ themselves propose prolongation. One suggestion is^that they should wait until March 3rd 'and if the Soviet troops have not gone, should at once vote for prolongation. There is no sign of the withdrawal of Soviet troops. ^ *5^ fhe Prime Minister whom I have just seen j_ays he feels he must go to Moscow, J asked whether he would go before or^after March 2nd and he said before. He admitted that he had no agenda of discussions and that the Russians would try to blackmail him 'as~they always do ,f r He'feared that the Russians would raise the question of the treaty of 1921. He professed to ba'se this belief on^Vyshinsky’s speeches in the Security Council but I have little doubt that he has been told by the Russians that this matter will be discussed. He declares that he will ask for the withdrawal of the Soviet troops by March 2nd under the^ 1942 treaty, and if this is refused will appeal to the Security Council, but I do not believe him. ffcflirtifTI P*™* o nirnnwmrHnt q£L India as my talagram He~.

After acquainting him with the terms of National Government's letter and Manager's reply, I asked whether, in the event of National Goverrment’isci^SfflXffilllr^their threat to withdraw guard from the bank, he would be prepared to ask appropriate Soviet authorities to provide Russian guard (see Mr, Farquhar’s telegram No, 43 of 1945), seeing that if, for lack of Persian Government’s protection, force were used against the bank, public opinion would ask why the occupation power did not prevent it. The Soviet Consul-General replied that provision of Russian guard was a ’’ticklish” question which he could not answer on his own responsibility 5 he thought it would be an intervention in a dispute between a foreign interest and the local authorities which he could not venture to undertake. I did not press the point of the guard but repeated my statement about the view that public opinion would take. He made no comment on this. 2. Soviet Consul-General was at some pains to emphasise his own ill-defined position vis-k-vis the National Government but I feel sure that he will warn the prime/Prime Minister against using force. He said he was convinced that the National Government would not think of doing so. And while it seems clear that Soviet authorities will not supply guard, I think if the Bank of Sepah insist on keeping their funds here frozen, and the Prime Minister v/ishes to carry out his threat, the Soviet Consul-General will probably dissuade him. If he does not, and National Government continue their pressure, Manager will act as instructed in your telegram No. 9. 3.

It is of historical interest but probably of no legal significance that this law, which was passed by the First Majlis in tosy 190?&gt; is older than the ; upplementary Constitutional Law of October 8th, 190? which, by articles 90 to 94 , authorises the establishment of provincial councils. 3. As I reported in my telegr am J* 9 t 1X64^ dated Dece m ber * 2nd, 194 ^^ 1 found the newly-appointedminister of the Interior infavour of the immediate application of the Provincial , Councils Law, in spite of its defects. In fact, as was Ijl^^/f-^reported in Mr. Farquhar»s telegram ijo. 27 thJ 2 e c«nber, ^ / Monsieur Saleh issued instructions forelections to the Provincial Councils to be held forthwith. It is pleasant to see a Persian cabinet minister who is prepared to do something, but whether it was wise to embark upon the elections at once is open to doubt. The Azerbaijan Governnent will take no notice of the orders, having already a ’'government” of 'ministers” which suits the ruling group far better than a provincial council as defined in the law of 1907* It to be supposed that everywhere else in the north the Tudeh Party, which has in many parts arrogated to itself the functions of law and order ana even administration, will sway the councils, and when the uussian troops have finally withdrawn, the Government may have to invoke Article 8$ ( an Article which would hardly find a place in a law passed in Persia to-day) whereby the shah with the approval of the I inister oi the Interior, can dismiss the Council. 4. Apart from any difficulties which may result from having the elections just now, and the objections which may be raised to the property qualifications (Articles b and 4b) \nd the age limit in the case of district councils (Article 4b), it is probable that the law will prove to be unworkable and the government that applied it in its present i orm may be accused of insincerity. It is not surprising uhat the deputies of 1907 who had just escaped from an ancient autocracy should have been unable to prepare a clear, workable bill, but that will not excuse the central government if the provincial councils find that they can do little or nothing. It is true that the Council has a kino of right of impeachment of governore- ^eneral and governors (why not of all officials?), but their other rights and duties are ill-definea. A long list of defects might be made, but it will suiiice to cite four of major importance which strike the attention at the iirst readingi 1. Although Article 92 refers to 'local purposes such as /the The Eight Honourable rnest Bevln, I .P., Hia Majesty*s principal ecretary of Stat for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, ( ★ LG -bOP L. ^i. 1. ^ \ Ur 1.z &lt;0 construction of roaaG, the establishment of schools, bridge building etc.% nowhere does the law classify roads and schools and bridges and say for which categories provincial councils are responsible. . rticle 97(7) implies that the council is responsible for all the roads in the province, including the expensive trunk roads; which is unreasonable. The province's responsibility in the matter of education is left exceedingly vaguei the council may apparently ,, establish rt schools, but whether primary, secondary or other is not stated and nothing is said about maintenance or control. 2. In view of the fact that the law was drafted in 19^7t it is not surprising that public health, except in references to hospitals, orphanages anu asylums, finds no place. The neglect of public health is one of the most serious faults of the Persian Government, and it is certain that no serious improvement will be effected until local interest is enlisted. It would seem necessary to give local councils dutlss in such matters as the prevention of malaria and typhus and the treatment of malaria and eye diseases such as trachoma. 3* The problem of finance is left in the air. A council with more common sense and experience than any Persian council is likely to have might shrink from undertaking financial responsibilities on the strength of .'Articles 92 - 95, Articles 105 - 114 ana other ’'relevant’ 1 provisions. This question needs an intensive study by experts and the drafting of a few clauses easy to understand and leaving no doubt as to the sources and scope of the provincial income. Special arrangements might have to be made for poor areas like those on the Persian Gulf. 4. Instead of diminishine, centralisation, the law as it stands seems likely to increase it. The provincial budget must be approved by the Ministry of finance (Article 112) and in audition there is a vague clause (Article IOC) implying that the Provincial Council c&lt;=«n make ’’recommendations” to the Treasury concerning the money to be paid for general provincial expenses. disputes between a provincial council and the governor about certain matters defined in Article 97 are to be referred to the Majlis (and the enate). And so on. 5. I understand that : onsieur Saleh has drafted an amending law, and I shall be curious to see it. If it is a serious contribution to the essential simplification and clarification of the existing law, it will be a great and agreeable surprise. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, SguA ft. b.

He refused saying that he had direct understanding with the Russians that Kurdistan was to be independent not subordinate to Tabriz Democrats. Democrats demurred but finally had to agree. Kurdish area is from Mianduab to Sardasht. 3# Fact that Iraqi authorities had allowed Hama Rashid to escape from Iraq greatly vexed the Persian authorities in Kurdistan.

He said that the Soviet Charge d'Affaires (’’some sort of secretary n ) had called on him and said that the Soviet Government would be glad to receive proposed Persian Mission but thought that if the Prime Minister himself would preside over it there would be a greater chance of success. The Prime Minister said he had excused himself on the ground that he could not leave Persia at this moment. The Mission would be under Mansur. 3. The Prime Minister said there were two questions to settle: 1) withdrawal of Soviet troops by March 2nd and 2) Azerbaijan. I reminded him that the Russians had said that Azerbaijan had nothing to do with them but the Prime Minister said ^nevertheless”. He confirmed that the Russians were making arrangements to hand over the nearer parts of northern railways ! RECO.

He wondered what the Russians would demand and ‘seemed to think they might ask in secret for things which could not be avowed before the Security Council. I have no doubt that they will ask him to deport that 'tool of the Imperialists' Saiyid Zia, but thought it best not to say so. We also referred to oil (see my telegram No. 179), I believe that the deputies of the Right, who still represent half of the Majlis, have informed him that they will not support any proposal to rescind or amend oil concession law. 4. My impression is that the Prime Minister is enormously relieved to know that when the Russians demand delivery of goods in return for their sustained and resolute [gp. undec, ? support] he can sometimes, if not always, hide behind the Security Council, I am sure that he is sincere in expressing the hope that he may count upon the continued support of His Majesty's Government, I said the policy of His Majesty's Government was based now as always on respect for the independence, sovereignty and integrity of Persia and that I was sure they would support any Persian Government which followed a similar policy, Foreign Office please pass to^Washington and Government of* India as my telegrams Nos. 55 and 69.^respectively.

Although Qawam A1 Saltana could not get any measure through the Majlis with so small a majority he intends to take office. 2. It is distressing, though not surprising, to find that his right hand man is Sepehr (Muvarrikh A1 Daula) who is notorious even among Persians for corruption and intrigue. Sepehr gave a message to the Daily Telegraph correspondent to the following effect: instructions are being sent to the head of the Persian delegation in London to follow up the appeal in the Security Council and on the other hand to Suhaily, who INDIA OFFICE t s now attached to the delegation, to approach Vishinsky {and ask what he means by direct negotiations. Qawam A1 Saltana will not form his cabinet for the present but will personally despatch current business and see how relations with Russia develop.5. I cannot believe that Qawam A1 Saltana will give sincere support to the Persian delegation. It is not for nothing that Russians have been trying for over a year to get him into power. Suhaily, who is another crook recently declared in a newspaper interview that appeal to U.N*0. was a mistake and that Persia ought to negotiate direct with Russia. Sepehr has for a year or so been head of the Soviet-Persian party and acting as a jackal of the Russians. 4. It will be regrettable if the Persian Government weakens in appeal to U.N.O. just when Persians in general have been greatly heartened by the stand made by the British Foreign Secretary but the Persians are always ready to watch other people taking a courageous stand on behalf of Persia.

Bullard. 2. ^s all of my information pointed to the fact that Kakimi Cabinet is tottering and as I found him somewhat sensitive on the subject of 'decisions’' which might have been taken at Hoscow Conference without previous consultation with the Persian Government I did not make communication regarding appointment of a tripartite commission in actual words of Moscow telegram under reference. I first asked him how he was getting on with the holding of elections for these councils. He replied that his intention was to hold 'free' elections, in other words, he did not intend to hold them until all foreign troops had left the country. I then observed that that would mean waiting until after 2nd March and enquired whether he had any scheme in his mind, if it was thought wiser to hold these elections sooner* Could the idea of a tripartite commission, which would advise the Persian Government about these elections, appeal to him? To this he replied that his reaction to such an idea would certainly be favourable. He then attempted to extract details from me but I rode him off by telling him that I only knew what had happened in the vaguest outlines and that it was obviously better to await the return of Sir R. Bullard who could deal far more authoritatively with the whole question. 3. I gave him statement which you made to the press which he had in fact already heard on the radio. X encouraged him as far as I could to remain firm and not to make any public statement to the Majlis until after uhe return of Sir R. Bullard, warning him at the same time ’ that weather conditions might conceivably delay his arrival.\ - 2 - 5. His Excellency at the end of the interview complained somewhat bitterly of obstructive tactics by various groups in the Hajlis and admitted that there were various intrigues going on at the present moment to oust him from office.

I sav/ the Persian Prime Minister and Kin is ter for Foreign affairs together today and asked whether the Cabinet had decided to accept the ^nglo-American proposal. The Prime Minister explained that he had thought it better to approach the matter indirectly on basis of press reports from England and America and that as a result of this manoeuvre a member of the Cabinet had put forward a proposal similar to ours, I said that you would find the delay disappointing and that I hoped it would not be fatal: when would the decision on the proposal be taken? The Prime Minister promised to call special Cabinet meeting on January Kth to consider the text of the proposal and to inform me and United States Ambassador of the result that evening or January 5th, 2, The Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs both said they accepted the proposal in principle though they could not authorise public statement to this effect, to be made. They said they wanted to make some small amendments but I hope to persuade them not to do this though they may wish to comment on one or two points when they publish the acoeptanoe, 3. I regret the delay but what with our proposal and the question whether to protest to United Nations Organisation or not, and the Cabinet crisis, the Prime Minister is in a mental fog which it takes time to dissipate. Meanwhile as the main principle of our proposal has been published in England I have felt at liberty to speak of it to some Persians of importance and to recommend it to them.

It is reported that he did nob go as far as Penjwin but that his son did so ”to visit their property'. This move was I am satisfied made without the approval of the Central Government since as late as December 12th the Minister of the Interior issued an order that the year’s Residence Forode in Kirkuk originally imposed on H was to be extended. 2. The attention of Iraqi Prime Minister has now been drawn to the matter and he spontaneously agreed that Hana Rashid f s presence anywhere near the frontier was most undesirable, particularly at present juncture, and said that he would order him to be transferred to Dhulaim i.e. _the most westerly province of Iraq. 1 £ 7 ^, ' ^ \ J T. j [Copies sent to Middle East Secretari OTP t.]4-UAN—G I INDIA OFFICE;C\v' [z Jo L'Z./lLcljtf P. fi y With the Compliment* Of the _ 44 _ Under Secretary of State ^ ^ ry&amp;SJp ff Fbryig^ Affairp ^.&lt;3.

Countrymen, Bretheren, The fire of the world war, lit by the enemies of freedom and anti-democrats, has been extinguished by the valiant soldiers of our great Allies. The democratic world was victorious over the fascist aggressors who tried to subdue all nations and to bring them under the heavy yoke of headstrong despots. The path to freedom, as was expected by all nations, is now open. To-day all nations, whether great or small, wish to take advantage of the way open to them and of the premises set forth in the historic Atlantic Charter to administer their affairs in the manner they choose. We, the Kurds who live in Persia and who have fought for years and even for centuries in order to preserve our national and local rights, have sacrificed many lives to this end. Unfortunately the despotic Persian authorities have never been ready to listen to our arguments, reasonable though they are. They have even prevented us from taking advantage of the rights set forth in the constitutional laws in connection with the provinces arxl cities. Our answers have always been bullets, bombs, imprisonment, banishnent, execution and captivity, especially during the twenty years* reign of Riza Khan, when we were not even free to put on our own tribal clothes. Our property was wrested from us by the dishonest and treacherous officers at the point of the bayonet and our wemen disgracefully attacked. They did not even refrain from taking savage steps for our extermination. After all we are also human beiugs. We ‘ have a history and a language; we too have customs and traditions in the upkeep of which we are greatly interested. Why are we /not _not allowed to bring up our children to speak Kurdish? Why are we not permitted to manage our own house as we desire? Why do they not let Kurdistan become an independent province administered by a Provincial Council, for which provision was made in the constitutional law. D-ear countrymen, it should be pointed out that rights are not given but taken. We must fight for our rights. For this unity, organisation and leaders are required. It is for this sacred aim that the Kurdish Democratic Party has been established in Mahabad. Our dear countrymen, you should be on the alert and gather round the party making sacrifices for their legal rights. The Kurdistan Democrat Party will lead you to success. It is only through the leadership of this party that the Kurdish Nation will be saved from annihilation and its wealth, women and national reputation protected. It is this party which will be able to secure its national independence within the borders of Persia. The Party’s Policy . 1. The Kurds to be free and independent in the management of their local affairs and to receive Kurdish independence within the borders of Persia. * 2. Be allowed to study Kurdish and to administer their affairs in the Kurdish language. 3 . Governnent officials definitely to be appointed from among the local population. 4. Members of the Kurdistan Provincial Council to be elected immediately in accordance with the constitutional laws, to supervise all public and Government works. 5 . By the passing of a general law, the grievances existing between the fhrmer and the landowner to be amended /andand their future position defined. 6 . The Democratic Party of Kurdistan will make #special efforts to create complete unity and brotherhood between the Azerbaijan nation and the people who live in Azerbaijan (Assyrians, Armenians, etc.). 7. The Democratic Party of Kurdistan will fight to take advantage of the boundless natural wealth of Kurdistan and to improve the agriculture, commerce, education and health of Kurdistan, in order to secure economic and moral welfare for the Kurds. 8 . We wish the nations who live in Persia to be able to work for their freedom and for the welfare and progress of their country.

I saw Persian Rrime Minister this afternoon and spoke to him along the lines suggested by Sir R. Bullard. 2 . .is all of my information pointed to the fact that Kakimi Cabinet is tottering and as I found him somewhat sensitive on the subject of 'decisions' v/hich might have been taken at Moscow Conference without previous consultation with the Persian Government I did not make communication regarding appointment of a tripartite commission in actual words of Moscow telegram under reference. I first asked him how he was getting on with the holding of elections for these councils. He replied that his intention was to hold 'free' elections, in other words, he did not intend to hold them until all foreign troops had left the country. I then observed that that would mean waiting until after 2 nd March and enquired whether he had any scheme in his mind, if it was thought wiser to hold these elections sooner* Mould the idea of a tripartite commission, which would advise the Persian Government about these elections, appeal to him? To this he replied that his reaction to such an idea would certainly be favourable. He then attempted to extract details from me but I rode him off by telling him that I only knew what had happened in the vaguest outlines and that it was obviously better to await the return of Sir R. Bullard who could deal far more authoritatively with the whole question. 3. I gave him statement which you made to the press which he had in fact already heard on the radio. I encouraged him as far as I could to remain firm and not to make any public statement to the Majlis until after the return of Sir R. Bullard, warning him at the same time • that weather conditions might conceivably delay his arrival. 5./- 2 - 5. His Excellency at the end of the interview complained somewhat 'bitterly of obstructive tactics 'by various groups in the Hajlis and admitted that there were various intrigues going on at the present moment to oust him from office.

(Cairo) Government of India and IMPOmNT Oriental Counsellor had interview yesterday with Salih, newly appointed Minister of the Interior, whose first act on assuming office was to issue instructions for the holding of elections for provincial councils. Although the Minister struck the Oriental Counsellor as being enthusiastically in favour of holding these elections immediately in accordance with a law of some 50 years old. he appeared somewhat ignorant of the exact procedure whicn would have to be followed in spite of his recent study of the question. He informed the Oriental Counsellor that his department were at the present moment busy in drawing up instructions for the guidance of officials all over the country. Certain deputies of the Right have expressed to the Oriental Counsellor their fear that in the provinces where Russian troops are still located these councils will be entirely packed with 'democrat' members. They also foresee that the Left Wing or extremist elements will put up a stiff fight everyv/here and that the elections will be likely to lead to considerable political friction in various parts of the country.

Chief of General Staff fears that Hama might unsettle the situation again in Southern Kurdistan at a time when both Governments have their hands full. Persian Government asked the Iraqi Government last year to extradite Hama. Iraqi Government refused but agreed to keep him at a safe dis tance from the frontier at Kirkuk. 2, If the facts are as stated by the Chief of General Staff, it might be i useful if His Majesty's Ambas- fu Bagdad were to point out to the Iraqi Government the danger which they run and which they cause to Persia by allowing Hama to return to the frontier.

Fahimi, the Minister of the Interior, has been dropped. He was unpopular with the Russians as being a member of the Cabinet of Seed which refused to give the Russians an oil concession last year. He is commonly believed to have close relations with Seyyid Zia and this is probably the reason for dropping him* 2, He has been replaced by Saleh, Minister without Portfolio. Saleh with Firuz and Nariman is one of the three Cabinet Ministers reputed to favour appeasement of the Russians. Presumably that is why he has been made Minister of the Interior. Ministry of Commerce has now been filled by Hashira Sahded. 3.

[CYPHER] CABINET DISTRIBUTION FROM WASHINGTON TO FOREIGN OFFICE Earl of Halifax. No.82 95 ^ 12th December 1945. Repeated to Tehran Moscow D.12.55 a.m. 15th December 1945. R. 9.05 a.m. 15th December 1945 ******** IMMEDIATE - ' Your telegrams Nos. 12,5 25 and 12,524. In informal conversation with Mr. Loy Henderson, Director and other officials of Near Eastern Division member of my staff.gathered that the mind of the State Department was working along the following lines. The Soviets, in the view of the Department, were unlikely to encourage a coup d'etat by Tudeh, which would lay them open to the charge of a deliberate aggression. Therefore the alternative course of intimidating Shah and Parliament into accepting a puppet Government was more likely to be favoured. If however, Soviets could not secure a^ puppet Government they might well resort to a coup d'etat as a second choice. 5. [Sic]. As the problem is now on the agenda of the Moscow meeting of Foreign Ministers relative merits of the four courses of action outlined in your telegram No.12525 were not discussed in detail. Henderson however 'YHought that 'it would be unwise to make a joint approach to Mr. Molotov and assumed you and Byrnes would wish to broach the question independently. 4. Indeed in the view of the officials interviewed the 'approach of United Kingdom and United States to the problem was not in any case entirely identical. It was true that both nations in the first place took their stand on principle. Britain however had important interests in Persia whereas it could not (repeat not) be argued that the United States security interests were directly threatened by current events in Azerbaijan. On the other hand, the United States Government were no less —vitally^interested than His Majesty's Government in the fa. e^pt. | 20 DEC] 94 c preservation • JNDiA OFFICE!* \ 'w - 2 - preservation of v/orld order and peace and in the success ^ of U.F.C. They regarded the present crMs as a crucial test of justification of the act of faith imposed by the big upon the smaller powers at San Francisco. . . 5. . They had not encoura-ged Mr. Hussein Ala in his propaganda activities, for indeed he needed no encouragement. I can bear personal/witn-ess to this view as when I happened to meet him in a State Department corridor on December 10th he pressed into my hand a mimeographed statement neatly demolishing the Soviet Government's reply to the United States note of November 24th. 6 . As to publicity, the State Department officials pointed out that the New York Times have sent its representative Clifton Daniel to Tehran * and.that his despatches were currently appearing in the paper. State Department were in general favourable to further visits to Persia by press representatives but did. not contemplate any specific steps to stimulate managements in this direction. • Time News Magazine would feature a special story on Persia this week with picture of the Shah on the front page. . , 7. A State Department official asked what your reaction would be if Persia granted the Soviets oil concessions, which appear to be chief ground of contention.' There was always the possibility that timorous or compliant Persian Government [gp. undec.'] would yield on this important point. It would be helpful if I could learn whether you hold any opinion upon this particular aspect of the situation, which might be communicated to the State Department at this stage. 8 . Above summarises State Department's views. Paragraph 3 of Moscow telegram No.5270 to Foreign Office raises larger question as to whether it may not soon be necessary to consider seriously with regard to Russian- Turkish situation how far in the last resort we should be ready to meet force with force. As this question is also , presumably posed by the course of events in Persia it would seem necessary .to reach an early decision as to' whether oil is really at the bottom of the present crisis or whether we have got to face the unpleasant truth that the Soviets are bent upon progressive and deliberate disturbance of the Middle East area in accordance v/itti a methodically planned pattern of [gp, undec. ?aggressive] design.

There seems to us to be two ways in which they could do this: a) by inspiring and assaying a coup d'dtat by the Tudeh party; b) by continuing and intensifying their war of nerves against the present ‘'ndgime 5 ' and intimidating the Shah and Parliament into accepting a government devoted to their interests. 3. Course a) is crude and a government so formed would, be exposed to the risk that we and the United States Government might not recognise it, 4. Course b) seems more likely to be adopted and is more difficult to combat. If a government, legally constitut ed yet entirely subservient to the Russians, were to come into power, it might well consent to the Russians keeping their troops in Persia after the treaty date when the Sritish troops v/ill have been v/ithdrav/n. Such a move could only mean lasting Russian domination of the northern provinces and to a lesser degree of the rest of Persia. Obviously, if the Russians were to remain indefinitely in the Northern provinces, this would place us in a very difficult position. 5. We should be grateful for any indication of State Department's viev/s. Please discuss with them very confidentially to ascertain to Y/hat extent we should have their support in resisting these unpleasant possibilities. OTP-U'fj U With the.

He nad left in the background, question of development of national democratic movement for m Persia as in other countries a worn out political rdgime was trying to stifle democratic movement. Question or withdrawal of Allied troops concerns firstly U.S.S.R. Reply to this question is simple, in fact there is no question.' Soviet Angle-Persian Treaty of 1942 clearly defines tasks conditions and period of stay of Soviet troops in Persia not to mention that under Soviet-Persian treaty of 26th February 1921 Soviet Union has right to bring its troops into territory of Persia* Consequently, questions when and how Soviet troops will be withdrawn from Persia can be given short and clear answer that it will be in accordance with treaty. Question of Soviet troops in other states can be answered equally simply and clearly. This question does not raise doubts nor misunderstandings. 2. Question concerning British troops in Persia in accordance with 1942 treaty can apparently be answered relatively clearly. But ; author asks, are there not in Persia British troops which arrived there even before 1942 treaty? Author asks why. where, how many, what are they doing and are they covered by treaty of 1942. He then draws attention to daily Egyptian press questions on presence of British troops in Egypt and asks why big English land, air and naval forces are in Palestine turning country into theatre of war, manoeuvring shooting and imprisoning. He goes on to refer to the presence of British troops in Syria, and Lebanon, in G-reece where they are intervening in internal affairs, in Indonesia where their presence is criticised by many, including members of Labour Party; author by implication suggests that Dutch oil is here of importance and asks what British troops are doing in Belgium, France,Holland, Denmark and Norway, 3. Author states that third Allied power mentioned by Persian Premier is United States. America has no treaty with Persia about United States troops but obviously there are troops, as Hakimi speaks of their withdrawal. Question of these troops is surrounded by heavy mist which we also see in China where also there is no treaty but United States troops are there and moreover, under command of eminent American generals. There are also American troops in Egypt.1 £ 3 *' 2 ^ SECRET IRDEXSB 7u. ( /C/y. x Unde r» ;; C i 5 DEC 1945 rmi,- i ■, .

On December 15th, however, the Shah, the Prime Minister and the Minister of War, against the advice of the Chief of the General Staff, decided to tell G.O.C. to come to Army Corps with all his officers, disband the soldiery numbering about 750 and destroy all arms.

In the presence of the military Attache he and the Chief of the General Staff telephoned the Shah but the latter would not give decision. 5. It has subsequently been learned that the message was actualIv sent with the typically Persian addition that ‘’garrison should resist in principle”. Result is that the G.O.C.

He said that he was already dealing with this matter but as he was very vague as to details, I obtained his permission to speak to Salih, one of the Ministers without portfolio. Salih is American trained and inclined to be anti-British but he received my suggestion very well* He had been studying the question himself (this is due presumably to the Shah‘s influence, (see telegram No* 1365) ,and referred me to a^ law some thirty years old dealing with the question. He is in favour of applying that law, defective as it is, rather than spending a long time drafting a new one and trying to get it through the Majlis. This may be sound tactics but I have not yet seen the law. I urged Salih to move the Cabinet to issue a statement as soon as they decided on principle to promote provincial councils and I left with him a draft of the kind of statement which I thought would interest the outside world. 2 . I was greatly encouraged to learn that the proposal for provincial councils for the whole of Persia had been brought to the notice of the State Department who at once^telegraphed United States Ambassador here for his views. I have^ just explained the matter to the best informed of the American secretaries and have recommended him to consult Salih, who happens to be the brother of the United States Embassy’s Persian secretary, in order to obtain the opinion of a Persian.

They may be jealous because we have supplied Persian Army with ‘a few aircraft and trained a few pilots in the United Kingdom. We have however not attached any conditions whereas those surrounding the Russian offer were found intolerable by the Persian Government. ^ • +’ Ayiftion. BO AC used to land only at Tehran. Soviet military line which although the war is over continues to operate, serves three other Persian towns as well as lenran and earns an enoi*L!iOns revenue carrying Pern an passengers, Soviet Ambassador was annoyed that 0 this agreeable an angement could not continue after the war. r, . . .^ 9^?j' oms ' _ AH British goods except those for the British military forces are unloaded into the Custom House / where....where Persian officials deal with them in accordance with the law. Soviet authorities wrested from the Oawan al Sal tana Cabinet permission to store Soviet imports in Soviet depots and they do not permit Persian customs authorities to enter these depots but compel them to accept Soviet declaration as to the nature and quantity of goods. I have no doubt that the Persian authorities are Dustified in believing that this procedure conceals official Soviet fraud on a vast scale. 6 . Consuls. At the beginning of the war the Russians had one Consul in Persia and the Persians one in Russia. The Russians have flooded Persia with Consular officers without granting reciprocity to the Persians. w e have about ten consular posts in Persia tut then we grant reciprocity# 7. Minitions_Agreement. Persian Government agreed under duress to make munitions for the Russian at prices to be fixed later. Prices eventually fixed resulted in huge losses to the Persian Government.

Even before the recent general stoppage of food exports from Azerbaijan as part ^f local nolitical move the Russians never allowed dried fruit to be exported from Rezaieh This allowed them to buy cheaply. So far as I know the Persian Government never even protested. 11. Tehran Municipality has the right to an entertain ments tax. Whenever we have promoted a show for British or Allied or Persian charities we have always asked the municipality beforehand to forego the tax. At the present moment a^ Soviet commercial circus is coining money in Tehran, the^ cheapest seat being equivalent to a day’s pay for an unskilled workman. Circus is paying no tax and the municipality dare not ask for it.-5- 12.

Apart from using tne material contained in your telegrams Nos.1317 and 1320 it would be useful to impress on him once again the persistent efforts which you have made to make the Persians from the Shah downwards realise the need for reform and the extreme vulnerability of a State such as Persia if it allows the legitimate grievances of large sections of its own nationals to remain indefinitely unremedied. You could in particular refer to the great support which you gave to Dr. Millspaugh*s mission whicn in our' view afforded the Persians a magnificent opportunity to set their nouse in order with dis-mterested American assistance. Since Mr. Murray seems impressed with the number of deputies who have pro-British leanings, it might be well also'to explain that such influence as we brought to bear on the last Majlis elections was devoted simply to encouraging relatively public-spirited Persians to come forward as candidates and to discouraging the few candidates whose record showed that they had been actively pro-German or who were suspected of having undertaken activities dangerous to the Allied war effort in Persia. 3. You would also no doubt explain to Mr. Murray that we have always been willing to encourage any healthy elements that can be found in Persian political life. The difficulty, as he has no doubt discovered, about encouraging progressive movements in Persia is that they seem to have so little energy and staying- power of their own. There is one course which we might have taken but did not, and that is to nave followed the Russian example, selected a party, financed it, organised it and incited it against its own Government. Y!e do not think it right for a- 2 - % &gt; \ a foreign Government to organise and encourage opposition to the Persian Government, however lamentable its snort- &lt; comings, and we have to hear in mind how difficult it is m Persia at the present moment to get a Government_to govern at all* I do not believe that the American attitude is in any way different from ours on tnis point.

D. 11,21 p.m.23rd November,1945 R. 4.45 a.m. 23rd November,1945 Z - Z - Z My telegra m No . 7833^ Byrnes has made a preliminary statement at a press conference on the lines that the United States G-overnment nad. received disquieting information about the situation in Persia, that their own communications yc re broken and that they had few details, but that he wished to call &gt; attention to the fact that the Soviet Government, the British Government and the United States Government v/ere all signatories of the Tehran-Declaration v/hich gave assurances about the continued sovereignty and integrity of Persia. Byrnes's statement unfortunately received [gp. indec.J no publicity here. 2. In response to your suggestion, Byrnes has now decided to make a communication m Moscow to the Soviet Government on the follovdng approximate lines. The Unitea States note will say that the United States Government has received information that the Soviet commanders in Persia have prevented Persian troops from proceeding to certain areas in Persia to preserve lav/ and order. In the opinion of the United States Government the right oi the Persian Government to send Persian Forces anywhere to preserve lav/ and order is a sovereign right, and any interference by other powers is an interference v/ith a sovereign right. The United States Government are sure that Soviet Government and His Majesty's Government are just as anxious as they themselves that the Tehran declara tion should be lived up to meticulously. # It may be that the local commanders have acted without instructions. li so. United States Government hope that instructions will soon be given them not to interfere. Note will conclude by saying that United States Government hope that all foreign troops will be withdrawn from Persia at once. 3. The United States Government will formally address a note to His Majesty's Government on similar lines. It is expected that instructions to United States Ambassadors in London and Moscow v/ill be sent out tonight. The united States Ambassador in Moscow may therefore take action 24th November, or 25th November, Byrnes hopes that you will make a similar approach in Moscow as an independent bpt ^ parallel step as soon as possible. United States Government recb. r a. t 3 m NOVl^ INDIA Off! b 0 ~~ ■ b&amp;t /? /b t'i i xb'are taking action as the result of suggestion contained in your telegram No. 11711 and ‘on the assumption that they will not (repeat not) he acting alone. 5. At the same time, Byrnes continues to attach great importance to avoidance of any statement or hint that IJis +. 1 a.iesty's Government and the United States Government havetton in consultation. He’presumes that your note'.dll not (repeat not) be in identical or too nearly similar terms. The United States Government take their stand on the Tehran Declaration and Byrnes suggests that you may wish to bring in the Tripartite Treaty to which the United States are not a party. 6 . Byrnes is thinking of publishing the American note soon after it has been delivered. He \/ill say nothing further to the press meanv/hile. OTP /a.CYP®R] FROM WVi.

He hopes I gather to have the support not only of the majority but also of a number of minority Deputies who were opposed to Sadr. The Cabinet is^an improvement on its predecessor in that it has a separate Minister of the Interior and that the Minister of Agriculture judl is the best possible candidate. On the other hand it may be remembered against Saleh and Nariman by Tudeh that they were in one Saeds Cabinet and that they were concerned in the discharge of Persian Director General of Railways against the Y/ishes of all three of -the Allies (my telegram No. 1082 1944 ). Weakest point is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 'there was a general demand for the retention of Sipahbody but the American Ambassador opposed this on the grounds [?gp. omitted] had 'wrecked” American interests and although this seemed to mean that Sipahbody had not always given the American Ambassador immediately exactly what he asked for, the Prime Minister thought it better to look elsewhere. Najm is not credited with much sense and he is not even here to take up his post but is on his slow way home from Kabul on leave. Meanwhile at this critical moment the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in the hands of the Under Secretary a notorious clown with v/hom it is waste of time to discuss public business. O.T.P. RESD.

Saving. 11111 Saving, IMPORTANT I have just received visit from the Persian Chief of General Staff who came in the name of the Shah to express His Majesty's anxiety at the situation and to ask for information and-advice. Delay in formation of the new government was naturally, he said, causing general disquiet but the main cause of the Shah's anxiety^ was feeling that Russia might bring about or support some coup d'etat or even send troops into Tehran to impose their will. There were reports that strong bodies of Soviet troops had arrived in Persia by land and by sea, that 16,000 fresh troops had reached Kasvin, and that Russian tanks had been seen south of Tehran on Qum road. 2. I suggested that just as our additional Military Attach*^ had found no evidence that the Russians in Azerbaijan were preparing an attack against Turkey and indeed no evidence of the arrival of large bodies of Soviet troops so I was sure the reports he had quoted to me were grossly exaggerated or (when it comes to tanks on the road to Qum) without foundation. Russians might have sent away some older men from Qum for demobilisation and replaced them by young recruits and to impress the public and hearten the Tudeh they might conceal the one and advertise the other. I could not say what Tudeh would do. It rather looked as though they were moving their centre of activities to Mes hed 0 But in view of the Soviet promises to Persia and forthcoming United Nations Conference in London I could not believe that the Russians would take any military action against Persia. I thought it hov/ever extremely likely that before the Russians left Azerbaijan (not later than March 2nd) some ! action would be taken either by the Kurds or by the Democratic Party in Tabriz or both which would embarrass the Persian Government for a long time to come, but these movements would be made to appear spontaneous, and to some extent would be spontaneous and the natural result of Persian neglect in the past, but.^that did not require and would not I thought receive anything like armed Russian support. Policy for the Persians to follow was to go on quietly for the next four months and of course to make the Deputies do some useful work, e,g. pass income tax laws. Deputies could- 2 - could also help by asking questions, moderate in tone, about the Soviet programme of evacuation&gt; -Soviet interference with' movement of Persian troops and gendarmes etc. Persian Government could take-action on such-questions and either elicit replies from the Soviet Government or announce that . Soviet Government would hot reply. «. • ' ■ ’ « ■* * 3. Chief of the General Staff said that the'Shah intended, if he received news of the imminence of some violent action by the Russians, to move to some town in the south with the prime minister and set up-the Persian Government where'it could be free from Russian pressure. Shah hoped that if I received any Such news I vRjQld communicate it to him. I said that I did not believe that there would be any such news but that if there was I would let the Shah have it at once.

His Majesty s Ambassador is assured by the Government that they will now get on with the income tax law and with economic schemes e.g. railway extension. 2. Connexion of the Tudeh with the Russians, the Azerbaijan autonomy movement and the Meshed muting have helped to discredit the movement. Hence the adoption of the name democratic for the Azerbaijan autonomy party. Tudeh Party offices in Tehran have been closed by the Military Governor and most of the party’s newspapers remain suppressed. 5. British Overseas Airways Corporation, Tehran, ceased September 29th. Daily News will publish last number October 12 th and will be succeeded by a news bulletin obtainable by quarterly subscribers only. British military rear parties will have left by mid-October and only a few oddments will remain. Confidential. Ramadan will probably be evacuated between middle and end of October and Kermanshah between beginning and middle of November. Persian Government wish to retain eight R.A.F. personnel to run signals until civilians have been recruited. 4, Soviet troops rushed out of their aerodrome without warning and without cleaning barracks night of September 19th Pro-Russian papers now boasting that Russian evacuation completed before British or American but Russian air lines within as well as to and from Persia continue to run and there is evidence that number of Russians in civilian clothes has increased. Russian part of the censorship has stopped. 5. American resentment has been aroused by newspaper attacks urging that ^merican assets ought to be transferred to the Persian Government without charge and blaming*the United States Government for not having concluded treaty. United States Embassy issued communique defining attitude to assets and stating that it was the United States Government which proposed treaty and Persian Government which declared it to be unnecessary. 6 . Anxiety of the Persians about the London Conference may not be allayed by the proposed communiqud of the Council which says that letters having been exchanged between British and2 . and Soviet Foreign Secretaries Council struck Persia off the agenda, Molotov has in fact agreed that Persia^ must be evacuated according to the Treaty but has refrained from confirming that the last date is March 2nd, •.above is secret but you can teel enquirers that doubtless Persia was not discussed because evacuation was already fixed by Treaty,SECd^ JL DEf^‘ 2 5 OCT194? INDIA OFFICE iAn&gt;i4 pff ,c £ 5^ i.ioscov/ radio on October 11th broadcast article by Trud entitled ''Strangling of workers in Persia 1 ’, ^irticle alleges that six workers elected to attend Labour Conference in Paris were prevented fron going by the Persian Governnent, three by arrest and three by refusal of passports* I do not think that the Persian Government behaved very sensibly in this natter but the arrest of the three nen was due to the understandable attempt of the Government to prevent violent action by Tudeh and on the other hand because election would be challenged if judged by Western standards, Persian delegation includes two genuine mill workers-from Isfahan, one of whom lost an eye in the brawl that followed the murder of the leading anti-Tudeh workman* Trud says that in Isfahan workers Democratic Union was closed and replaced by another comprising factory owners as members. Tudeh Union was not closed but collapsed because all of its members deserted to rival Union which has undoubtedly been encouraged by owners, e*gr by an increase in wages. I leave it to others to say whether a Union encouraged^by^ employers or one encouraged by Soviet [grp* undec. ?Lationalists] most truly represents the workers of Isfahan The fact is that there is no trade unionism in our sense in Persia and probably cannot be for some years* This however will not prevent lively contest in Paris between the men who claim^ to be the real representatives of the workers. Tudeh leader in Majlis Iraj Iskandari has been flown out by the Russians. He secured a passport but other Persians who the Russians claim succeeded in going to Paris, were probably smuggled out by the Russians without Persian papers.

He says that he can send more only if he receives instructions from his principals in London telling him they want more. He has strict general instructions to economise in cable costs which are high, and is often snubbed about the cost of par ticular messages, however important. Associated Press, which he also represents, is more reasonable in this respect. 2. Correspondent also tells me that Reuter's only pay him £15 a month and he makes perhaps £10 in commission. To expect a firstclass service (which this correspondent could supply) for £25 a month is absurd. Associated Press pay him a good salary and naturally get a better service. Why should he and Associated Press subsidise Reuter's? Nevertheless, if instructed by Rueter's direct to send more news he will do so.

This reply bears out the warning originally given to the Prime Minister when he spoke vaguely about the project beforehand viz, that the first requisite for such a visit was an agreed programme. 2. Prime Minister thereupon dropped the proposal. He had had a hazy hope that if someone like Suhaily whom the Soviet Government do not distrust could have a good talk about things in general, relations would improve and in particular the Soviet authorities in north Persia would become reasonable.

He asked why evacuation could not be effected before March but did not press the point. He agreed that as Persia had endured difficulties in the north for four years she ought to be able to hold out five months longer. He was however anxious about Azerbaijan and in particular dealt with recent visit of a number of Kurds in connexion with autonomy movement to Baku without permission of Persian authorities. He considered that military mutiny had been nipped in the bud: accused had talked of implicating the Tudeh completely. Concession in housing pay and allowances which were being put through would he believed be too much to allay discontent amongst the officers. 2. I told His Majesty about the Foreign Secretary's message to the Persian Ambassador in London regarding the urgent necessity for the Persian Government to undertake reforms and about the-leading article in the Times in the same sense. He said that perhaps too little allowance was made for upheaval caused by pressure of foreign troops in Persia but claimed, with reason, to have given similar advice 'to all his government. He was sceptical about democracy as interpreted here as a method of government for Persia: the deputies appeared in the Majlis daily just long enough to justifiably collect salary and spent the rest of the time pressing the Minister for jobs for relatives and friends. He believed tha.t some change of constitution would have to be made when foreign troops had left: in particular, some means Hust be found to dissolve a Majlis which* like the present one, never passed any legislation at all. 3. Conversation was long and covered many subjects. I did not pursue the question of amenities of the constitution for we have troubles^ t q£ugh on our hands at present. I brought up RECO.

V 28th August, 1945 ■ ah c ■ ^ ^ The British Ambassador in Tehran in a letter dated 20th June 1945 to our Chief Representative in Iran Mr. Northcroft (of which a copy is enclosed), has sent us a warning concerning the likelihood of strikes at Abadan or at other oil producing centres in Iran. We have noted that the letter has been shown to the Commander-in-chief and that copies have been sent to the Foreign Office and to the Government of India. We appreciate the danger and tnink that you and other interested Authorities might wish to have some further information regarding the position as we see it. 1• The recent strike at our Kermanshah refinery was plainly caused by political agitation; the demands which were produced - apparently as an afterthought - were concerned largely with Governmental action, and no reasonable grievances could ^e substantiated in regard to conditions which could be remedied by the Company. 2. Nevertheless, the general political and economic conditions throughout Iran, the low standard of living and of social development of the large majority of Iranians, coupled with the effects of severe inflation and of other fundamental disturbances resulting from the war are, we appreciate, most cogent reasons in justification of the warning sounded by the Ambassador that labour unrest is likely to recur. In particular, at Abadan, the war effort necessitated the concentration of an additional * 23,000 labourers in a town which was already in spite of continuous help of every kind from the A.I.O.C. very lacking in hygienic and other municipal amenities. 3 . It is and always has been the Company’s policy to do all within its means and power to improve social conditions for its employees in Iran and elsewhere; and had it not been for the interruption caused by v/ar conditions and-rtjstrictions, the stage planned before the war would have been quickly completed and a further programme initiated. 4* This programme of social improvement was, however, unavoidably slowed down by scarcities of man-power and material and by problems of considerable complexity which aror^ from the demand for greatly increased output and which may not be generally known. The expansion entailed a prodigious construction effort, for which authority and the necessary priorities were not forthcoming until 1941 when it coincided with Military and Aid-to-Russia developments in Iran. The local demands of the Allies for manpower, commodities and material were enormous and far exceeded the slender resources of the country. The Company, compelled by the nature of its commercial status to rely on voluntary service, recruited British, Americans, Indians, Palestinians, Czechs and Poles in large numbers ana had as well to expand its Persian staff and labour K force from some 28,000 to 60,000. An unprecedented demand for ' accommodation and welfare facilities was set up in Abadan at a time when these were alreaay strained by applications (which were granted so far as possible) from the British military garrison, from British, American and Russian officials, and from Military and Aia-to-Ruosia . projects/ .

The problem was further complicated by the comfiete lack of * public facilities at the main centres, notably at Abadan, and the breakdown amounting to cessation of all Persian provincial administrative and security machinery, and also of commodity supplies. At the height of the construction programme, it was position, to ration and feed all its employees and the inhabitants (about 120,000) in the town of Abadan as well as large communities at other centres; and to prevent the onset of epidemics at a time when dangers of this sort were aggravated by the influx of large numbers of destitute Persians driven from their homes by conditions verging on famine. 6 . With regard to existing conditions of service of our Persian emplo, ees, we should mention that rates of pay are those which were laid down by the Allied Forces. Working hours are reasonable and are less than the 48 hour week demanded by the strikers at Kermanshah and the Toudeh party. Overtime, sickness and holiday pay, service gratuities, accident compensation have long been in force. The range of social benefits which includes hospitals, schools, clubs, housing for many employees and, for the time being, free rations ana heavily subsidised issues of clothing, etc., will, we believe, bear favourable comparison with that offered by any large commercial enterprise in the worla. The organisations for ensuring that working conditions are correct, that complaints are attendeu to, etc. are being continually overhauled and reinforced. 7. As regaras the future, whatever progress has alreaay been made, it is fully recognised how much still remains to be done and how behinahand the work has unavoidably become as the result ^of these other preoccupations during the past six years. Large scale extensions for housing estates, for medical and social welfare facilities have been planned and are being built; greater acceleration is limited only by restrictions on manpower and imported materials. 8 . The Company is fully alive to the necessity of finding out and removing all legitimate grievances amongst its Persian employees. We should ada, however, that we are doubtful whether Persian labour can be inmunised from unrest by conditions of service and by welfare organisations alone. It is our view that the danger originates in large part in the political and economic position of the country as a whole, and that simultaneous measures to improve internal conditions and the general administration of the country are essential, in addition to our localised efforts, if the dangers foreseen by the Ambassador and equally apprehended by ourselves, are to be averted. If you feel that these comments should reach the Government of India, perhaps you would kindly take the appropriate action. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) N.A.

They deserved to win since the complaints which were the ostensible cause or the strike were in nearly all cases unsupported by the facts* Nevertheless, it is not to be supposed that there will be no more trouble* The instigators are doubtless furious: indeed, this is evident from articles in the Tehran press; and it is expected that attempts will be made to cause trouble, if not at Kermanshah, then at Abadan or else where among the Company’s Persian employees. Apart from possible strikes, there is the risk that the Company may be rendered unpopular by press propaganda. It is vulnerable, being a foreign Company of whose shares a large part is held by a foreign Government* When Persians complain to me about revolutionary activities on the part of “left” elements, I always give them the same reply viz. that the way to prevent revolution is to undertake Reforms* I point out the great need of reform and tell them that if they do not take some action \ they will be swept aside by people who are more determined* I do not compare the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company with the Persian ruling classes, but there is an analogy. I should like to be assured that the Company are fully alive to the necessity to remove all legitimate grievances among their Persian employees, and that they are making a serious attempt to find out what those grievances are.

Some of the attacks have been scurrilous and some invalidated by the charge that Americans have no rights in the matter because they have no treaty like the Tripartite treaty of 1942. 2. Communique has been published by United States Embassy explaining in detail that United States Government proposed in 1943 to conclude a treaty governing the situation of American forces in Persia; Persian Government broke off negotiations and refused to resume them and finally in March 1945 informed United States Government that it thought an agreement unnecessary and considered the question &amp;a. closed. Communique also defends American policy in regard to sale of assets which it says (truly) does not differ (as some papers had suggested it did) from that of the British. 3. Incident has infuriated United States Ambassador against Persia - all the more so because he has always he says defended the interests of Persia. Soviet Ambassador has been quick to show his sympathy with Mr. Murray and to point out how ungrateful Persians are and United States .Ambassador does not seem to have noticed most violent attacks came from the newspapers which are strongly pro-Russian.

Proclaiming that dictatorship still prevailed in Persia, the signatories assert that Persian people expected leaders of great nations to help them in accordance with the Atlantic Charter and United Nations Charter to assure sovereign rights of the people and to remove injustices inflicted upon them. 2. On September 15th the Press published a telegram addressed by 27 editors and Tudeh Press and its associates to Foreign Ministers Conference informing them that dictatorship continued in Persia and the same elements who had co-operated with Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany were depriving the people contrary to the undertakings of United Nations Charter of free thought, free press and free association. To preserve its own existence the present regime was striving to stamp out freedom and democracy. The signatories in the name of the people strongly protested at these actions. Signatories considered it necessary to inform Foreign Ministers Conference of the disgust of the people, who were in captivity to Fascist hirelings, at present situation and that no trace of freedom or democracy was to be found in Persia. 5. On September 18th a manifesto signed by 56 editors of Independent Front and neutral papers was published expressing the view that the above telegrams were contrary to the interests of Persia at the present time when evacuation was being discussed and denying allegations made in them. The Persian people were strongly opposed to the exertion of influence by any foreign country in the internal affairs of Persia. 4. Non-Tudeh Press carry articles in support of the above manifesto and emphasise the need for evacuation of the • country; unless evacuation was carried cut the internal affairs of the country could not be put in order. Sadayi Iran September 18th states that Tudem party were accusing the Government and the people of Persia of dictatorial and Fascist inclinations in order to give Foreign countries a pretext to interfere in Persia ana to enslave her people. It asks why if Fascist principles urevailed in Persia Russia had signed a treaty with a '’Fascist Government' and Stalin had guaranteed the independence of a ’’Fascist country. Nidayi Idalat alleges that an attempt was being made to destroy the independence of Persia and asks how a country which had sacrificed all it had to Russia when the Germans were in Caucasus could /be called..../s be called Fascist. It recalls that this charge of Fascism had only been made after the end of the war. Traitorous elements had been commissioned to create disturbances 39 that it could be alleged that Persians could not manage their own affairs.

FFFFF Trud September 15th publishes almost three column report on visit of Soviet Trade Union Delegation to Persia by Borisov, head of delegation. He writes that invitation was made to United States, Britain and France as well as U.S.S.R. who were first to accept Uarmth with which delegation was received is explained by part played by Soviet Union in struggle against Fascism and for democracy, freedom and independence of nations. Hope was generally expressed for close relations between trade unions of both countries. 2. Visit to Persia showed that workers were employed largely in semi-handicraft industries in conditions of the worst feudal and semi-colonial slavery. There are 600,000 wage-earners but no legislation on working hours which go up to 14 a day. Women are mercilessly exploited and if paid at all receive arbitrary payment in kind. Child labour is widely used, 5. Bill to remedy this situation was submitted by People s Party in 1943 but it was obstructed by Saed Government and eventually thrown out by reactionary majority in Majlis. People’s Party was formed after alliance with great Allies which permitted creation of democratic parties and organisations. Its efforts to unite democratic elements and form trade unions were however frustrated by reactionary parties who were alarmed at its success and wished to split working class movement. 4. In June 1944, however, the three independent trade union associations in Peria, People’s Party Trace Union, Toilers' Union and Engineers' Union merged in spite of efforts of Yusef Eftekhari, a rogue and provocateur, guilty of organising railway strikes to prevent delivery of war supplies to U.S.S.R. to create competing “Workers' Trade Union”. Hew organisation represents 230,000 workers of 19 trade unions of all branches of industry and is fighting seriously for economic interests of working class and carrying on active struggle against reactionary element led by Seyyid Zia, who tried to suppress democratic development of country and pdson relations with Soviet Union. Seyvid elements are trying by all possible means to undermine authority and influence of trade unions, leaders of which are only working for unity of workers both in Persia and outside. 5. Central Council's request to take part in London 21 SEP in ^ INDIA OFFICE! conferenceconference was rejected as result of trick by Eftekhari. Soviet Trade Union Delegation on return to Soviet Union heard with indignation of renewed attempts to prevent Persian Trade Unions going to Paris. They hope that this time trick will not come off. 6 # Author of article concludes that Persian Trade Unions are in need and deserve brotherly help from international working class in their courageous struggle against reactionary Forces.V A f\V vi V FILE COPY V^ v i [GYKmilR] DEPARTIix^iiiL NO, 1 t-ROM i'KHQLciN TO FOREIGN OFFICE Mr. konypenny No, 1023 20th September, 1%5 D. 3.01 p.m. GMT 20th September, 1945 R. 5.27 p.m. BST 20th September, 1945 Repeated to Moscow Government of India M.E.
