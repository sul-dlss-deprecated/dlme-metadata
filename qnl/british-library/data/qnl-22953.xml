No satisfactory reply having been re ceived H.M.Ambassador Washington was instructed on April 10th to take up with State Department whole question of Company's activities in Egypt and Iraq general line being that while anxious to collaborate closely with Americans as regards American air services designed to help Allied war effort H.m.G. do not feel present time is opportune for purely commercial ventures.

To Political Resident, Bushire. No.310* Dated 12th May 1942. Chliger former Manager California Arabian Standard Oil Company has informed me in course of private conversation that recently Company made direct approach to Ibn Saud and secured unconditional permission for construction landing grounds throughout Company's concession area. Construction work will begin immediately at selected spots of which Ras Tanura will probably be one. Ibn Saud said in confidence that he had no objection to use of these aerodromes in emergency by R.A.F. aircraft which should be helped to get away again as quickly as possible. Pan American Airways are in close touch with California Arabian Standard Oil Company and probably hope to use these facilities. I hope to secure further details shortly, but request that source of information be kept strictly con fidential. PoliticalNo,C/658 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 13th May 1942.

In view of recent crashes of R.A.F. machines on &amp;audi Arabian shore of Persian ^ulf (caused I understand by machines attempting to land on surface which appeared safe from air but which was in fact soft sand) Manager California Arabian ffiil Company has suggested to me that his company should proceed to mark out several spots between Kuwait frontier and Dahran where safe landings could be made. 2. Markings would be quite elementary. Jompany have in mind driving cars round and round spots ehosen until track is sufficiently clear from the air and then taking tracks with oil Company would also make strip maps showing spots chosen and send copies to R.A.F. 3. I thanked Company for their offer and 1 enquired from Saudi Government whether they had any objection.

See also para 8 (ii) of Bahrain Intelligence Summary No.2 of 1942. 2. Statement that Pan American Airways probably hope to use new facilities was based on remark made to me by Ohliger that if Pan American Airways aircraft make use of new landing grounds American employees of Casoc will find it easier to take home leave. 3. Ohliger was not speaking in official capacity and seems to have been misinformed in several respects e.g. statements reported in first sentence of my telegram May 12th have been proved erroneous by Jeddah telegram.

Copy to Air Officer Commanding, Habbaniyah. No. 1100 Dated 10th June 1942 Reference my telegram No. T/273 April 13th. 2. Jackson reports from Salala on June 6th that four Pan American Airways personnel have arrived there. They state that they have come to establish a staging post for a Pan American Airways service between Khartoum and Karachi, that more of their men are expected within a few days with wireless equipment, that their aircraft carry U.S. Army markings, that they have not come under the auspices of the Royal Air Force or British Overseas Airways Cor poration, that they expect to Carr y private passengers if bookings of government priority passages permit it and that they wish to negotiate with Sultan for a camp site, local labour and supply of privisions. 3. Sultan is insisting that these Pan American Airways personnel should undertake to be associated with the Royal Air Force and to be bound by his rules for the Royal Air Force c.f. my telegram No. 304 February 15th (to Government of India only). Failing this he proposes to ask personnel to explain their presence. When Jackson write he (Jackson) was concluding with the personnel an agreement that they should vis a vis the State be regarded as the R.A.F. until their status is defined. 4. Sultan has intimated that he would in any case like to reserve his right of jurisdiction over these Americans. - 'lutj- Jackson is of opinion that Sultan would be pleased 5to accept Pan American Airways under R.A.F. auspices but that he is anxious for definition of their position as soon as possible. 6. Sultan clearly has full jurisdiction over American subjects within his terr itories and I propose that he should be informed that so far as we are concerned he is at full liberty to exercise this jurisdiction in the present case. 7. As our Civil Air Agreement of 1934 with Sultan has lapse -d he is at liberty to negotiate similar agreement direct with Americans. Such an agreement might be most damaging to our interests. It is therefore most desirable to arrange for the service which Pan American Airways are seeking to establish to be regarded as a military service, and that Americans should be induced to ask Sultan either direct or through us to grant facilities for it as much on the same lines as for R.+A.F. for duration of war. 8. Meanwhile arrangement which Jackson is making in concluding sentence of paragraph 3 appears to be an excellent one and I suggest that Sultan be asked to treat Pan American Airways personnel as R.A.F. (except that he will possess full jurisdiction in respect of them) until further approach is made to him on subject. 9. Please telegraph early instructions. BRITCONSUL -Telegram I.D.V.

Pan American Airways thus appear to be acting entirely on their own account in these countries and presumably also in Muscat. (b) U.S.A. Government intend to militarise all Pan American Airways services in Africa and Middle East but are finding difficulty in doing so largely owing to opposition inspired by Pan American Airvrays who are mean while doing their best to establish facilities for them selves throughout the Middle gast. (c) His Majesty*s Governmenl their part intend (1) to terminate as soon as pos sible agreement authorising subsidiary Company to O/perute from V/est A'frica to Khartoum and (ii) to make any tiew arrangement direct with U.3.A. authorities.

British Government purposes n nd (iii) for period of war* U.S.A. Government have agreed as a general rule that question of post war rights should be left for discussion after war.

With reference to para 2 (d) of that tele gram I consider it important that Sultan should be informed at once that Pan American Airways have no authority from U.3. Government to negotiate with him and that any rights accorded s should be granted to U.3.A. Government only.

Following is text of Aide Memoire received from the State Department in reply to representations based on your telegram No. 2350 s Begins : On April 15th,1942, the British Embassy handed to the Department of State an aide-memoire on the subject of Pan American Airways services in the itfear and Middle East. Reference was made to an attached copy of a note dated February 24, 1942, addressed by Mr.Eden to the United States Ambassador in London on the same subject • With regard to the air services presently carried on by Pan American Airways into Egypt, and from Cairo to Basra, note is taken of the fact that subject to the approval of the British military authorities, the Egyptian Government would be prepared to grant to Pan American Airways facilities for operating special air services t&lt; to meet the requirements for official passengers, mail or freight; and that the British Government believes that space in such services in excess of United States military requirements should be confined to material connected with the war effort of the United Nations, and that British and allied military material should have priority after United States military material. It is the view of this Government that Pan American Airways, in respect of the services to Egypt, and from Cairo to Basra, is operating a facilitt for the benefit of the Government of the United States and the United Nations. As this is done at the expense of the United States, it would seem that the United States should be free to make use of any unfilled space on these planes for non-commercial, civilian use approved by the United States authorities in the region. If the phrase •material connected with the war effort of the United Nations’* is interpreted in this sense, and is not restricted to what may be regarded as **military use*, this Government could accept the point of view of the Aide- memoire under reference. This Government is not prepared to accept without qualifica tion the suggestion that British and Allied military material should have priority after United States military material, irrespective of circumstances. It is believed that the needs oi the situation will be adequately not if the competent authority of the United States on the ground is instructed to give full consideration to British and Allied military needs in determining priorities. It will readily be appreciated that travel for diplomatic nd other government personnel, though civilian, may in many nstances outrank in necessity non-exigent space requirements or British and Allied military material. Repatriation of ^meri- an citizens might, in various contingencies, take priority iver such material, depending on the circumstances. Determina- ion of priority must be decided by the sound judgment o~ trie ompetent authority on the ground in the light of circumstances, i ather than by blanket rule. Should the particular question of a commercial air service / overrr • m 2 m I A over Egyptian territory require examiMtion, the United States £°J ern - mf.nt la entirelv willing to diaouee it in the first plac- with British Government. lAelieves, however, that such diaouseion oo 9 ld be more adequately held in Washington rather than in -airo. The Government of the United States agrees with the British Government that the present moment is » ot B i° ra and m Sudan post-war commercial air services between Cairo and Basra, ana in and Egyptian territory, as and when exploration of this au ^® 0 * appeal desirable it will feel free to take the matter up with the British Government, and has every confidence tbat through .k exchange of views, a solution of any problems then arising may be arrived at. . ,. -»»+rrwan+ pvDrfisses tiie hop® that no attempt In conclusion, the Department exp oonlpanie8 acting for either will be made by whi0 h would exclude air transport Government, to set up a^agg«ni . tat inn through diplomatic lines of the other, except after consult^ between channels.

We agree of course in principle that Americans should not pay import duty on any Aviation Spirit or lubricants particulari ty if circumstances require them to import themselves. Present position is that Avi/ation Spirit and lubricants are considered in India as article of indigenous supply since we purchase through local representatives of Oil Companys for rupees and we have been providing U.S.Air Force in India with Aviation, motor spirit and lubricants free on reverse Lease/Lend. Provided this practice continues, it makes no difference to the Americaais whether customs duty is charged or not. 5. 8ince all Aviation Spirit imported is treated as common user stock for Civil Aviation, R.A.F. and American Air Force, and since it is phy.xcally impossible to segregrate stocks for any particular consumer, we are unable to evolve any reasonable system other than provision of Aviation Spirit from British controlled sources by ourselves on reverse Lease/ Lend and by u.S.A. from American controlled sources on Lease/ Lend thus eliminating any difficulty in regard to customs duty. 4. As for Ras-al-fiadd and Salalah, we understand R.A.F. are responsible for laying down stocks for common user. Question does not therefore appear to arise in ifluscat territory. / Telegram- 2 - Teioffran Secret * i?rom .... Secretary of State for in ^ ia ! Lon ^ 01 ?' &lt; 2 0 .... Governor General (E.

They were surprised to note that our request did not ’appear t^o indlude any routes with large aircraft commencing in London and' they specifically asked the whether/British Overseas airway's 'Corporation intended to operate into or through Beirut. &lt; .0 &gt; - ,K ^ 6. Rayner replied that he'had not yet received any instructions in this connection ana that there was no airport in the Lebanon capable 01 taking large aircraft. The Lebanese agreed- but pointed out that the international airport 'at Lhafte wcuiu be ready by July 1950 and that they might wish to operate to Lonuon about&gt;that time. 0 However, they were hot in 4 position to say w'hat intermediate point they required on the London route. 7. They explained that by granting ’fifth freedom rights on local routes they would have to face very serious opposition from their own operators. Their main objective however is to attract inter national traffic to Beirut, 'and if we could give them even an assurance that B.O.^.C. would operate through Beirut when Khafte was^ready they would withdraw their objections and gra’nt fifth freedom rights not only to B.O.n.C. (which they are anxious to do) but also to Cyprus airways’ bn routes as in paragraph 3 (b) although they realised the latter concession as being against their own interests. ^ Oi ... ) 8.

I should be grateful therefore to learn whether hOaC intend to use Beirut and, if possible, the precise routes, so that I may give the Lebanese the necessary assurance, although they mentioned July, 1950, as the opening date of the new aerodrome it is safe to say that it will merely be usable by that date and that B.O.a.C. would not be expected to operate until amenities have reached a fair stage of completion. That may be about the end of this year, and by June 1951 at the latest. 10. May I also be informed whether the proposed Lebanese route to V.est Africa is acceptaole, if so whether you require^ me to obtain a reciprocal route. 11. Bayner deliberately avoided mention of Bahrain in connection with Cyprus airways Persian Culf route. It will be seen that the Lebanese asked for rights only at Kuwait. , ; We do not know whether they contemplate any extension of their own Persian Gulf service. He felt that if he had done so it might have introduced a fresh complication involving our own claim to cabotage rights in the Persian Gulf of which they are possibly unaware.
