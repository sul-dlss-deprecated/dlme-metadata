My dear Fowle, I write vvith reference to -^och^ express letter of 30thlDecember, C/1014-13/7, to say that we have passed on the suggestions In paragraphs 3 and 4 to Commander Bayldon, as Mr. Barnett is understood to be likely to proceed in the immediate future. 2. As regards paragraph 2 of his letter, you will have seen from the correspondence with the Passport Office, copies of which v/ere sent to you and to Bahrain under our printed letter No:P.Z.91/35 of 4th January, that both Mr. Barnett and the ^iner have been given passports vise for Bahrain and Koweit, but that it was considered unnecessary to grabt a special visa for Shar.iah or Bu Musa. If, in cases such as this, you would in future like specific visas given for Sharjah (or other points on the Trucial Coast which individuals may be permitted to visit) perhaps you would be so kind as to let us know and we will so inform the Passport Office. 3.

In other words the F reign Of!ice Circular in question, in the paradoxical wa^ in which things happen in the Bull, while intended to strengthen our hands, and actually doing so as regards foreigners in general visiting the Arab Coast as a whole, has weakened it with regard to the frucial Coast. 3, neither the frucial Coast towns,(we do not allow Imperial Airways passengers to enter Sharjah town), still less the interior, are really fit places for casual foreigners or British subjects, to visit or reside or travel in, unless in special circumstances. ee can ot from the practical point of view adopt the ”at your own risk ? attitude, since in the case / •G.JLaithwaite .squire, C.

At the same time he agrees with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs as to the desirability of taking any steps possible to avoid inconvenience to British subjects as a result of the attitude which has been adopted by the Persians in the matter j| now r under discussion. In the light of demi-official #ix§- conversations which have taken place with your department he is of opinion that it will suffice if the Political Agents in question are instructed to avoid the grant of visas or en dorsements as far as possible where it appears to be the intention of the applicant to proceed subsequently to Persia, and I am to enclose a copy of instructions to this effect . which have now been sent to the Government of India. It will not be overlooked in this connection that, under the procedure embodied in Foreign Office Confidential Circular No. T 7205/ 1 UM ^818/378 of 15th August 1934, special provision exists to meet the cases of persons who hold passports, visas, or available for Bahrain and Koweit who wish to proceed to Persia.

The instructions suggested by the Grovern- ment of India hardly appear to cover the case of a traveller who has no intention at the time of his departure from Bahrain of visiting Persia but who subsequently decides probably for business reasons- to visit Persia. In order to prevent difficulties I suggest that the Political Agents when granting visas for any territory whatever should stamp with a rubber : hdC stamp in the place for endorsements (page 4) that / 'This passport may not be made valid for Persia. In jthe event of the bearer wishing to visit Persia he must obtain a fresh passport.'* This restriction will inevitably involve a certain number of travellers in extra expense but in the circumstances I fear that cannot be helpedo It would of course be necessary for the Political Agents to delete any existing endorsements for Persia from any travel document on which it was necessaiy for them to affix their official seal or stamp.

If this is not admitted the Bahrain govern ment will appear to have no say whatever in the question of who is to be allowed to come to Bahrain which is an undignified and unsuitable position. 4 . I presume that (d) applies to continental pearl merchants as well as Arabs, the most important pearl merchants are French subjects. 5. Regarding 2, the Bahrain government has its own passport regulations which cover some of the classes of travellerstravellers mentioned in this section. 6 . I suggest an addition to the effect that persons suffering from infectious and contagious diseases such as venereal and leprosy will be forbidden to land in Bahrain and also that professional beggars, fakirs and derwishes will not be allowed to land. 7 . With regard to TT women travellers” I suggest that this expression should be qualified by the word^unattached”. The description TT women travellers” is ambiguous and I think a distinction should be made between women who live in Bahrain and women wishing to visit Bahrain. At present much inconvenience is caused to women residing in Bahrain who wish to return to Bahrain. I speak from experience. Yours sincerely,&amp; ■I D.O.

Thank you for your letter of the 27th April, D.0.No.707-29/7, and the draft Bahrain visa rules.

Note 3« 1(a)'This exception would not be applicable to the wives or dependents of British subjects employed in Bahrain'. This might be omitted, as it should be obvious. 1(b)'Shaikhdoms' seems better than 'principalities'. 'The authorisation of the Bahrain G-overnment applies only to Bahraini subjects'. This is not understood, as Bahraini subjects are surely free to return to Bahrain without special authorisation or visa. 'The written permission or authorisation of the Political Agent, Bahrain, is requisite, in the cases of all other persons not covered by 1 (a) and (b) above'. This is rather confusing, as it looks as though a written authorisation of the Political himself Agent to the visa applicant/might be necessary. The normal case (e.g. a French tourist) will ^pi^esumably be one in which a Consular Officer writes is or telegraphs to the Political Agent, Bahrain for authority to grant a visa, duly receives a reply by letter or cable, and acts 1 \ V I f accordingly. It is suggested that this paragraph be omitted altogether, and a section 5 placed at the end instead. 'J.Note 4* '5.

The only way in which this could be known to the visa - issuing authority (except in the rare cases where passport and visa were granted in the same town) would be if 'pearl- merchant' were noted on the passport under ''profession'. It is not known whether this is meant, but would it not be better to allow the visa-issuing authority to judge, and substitute instead some such phrase as 'provided the Consular Officer granting the visa is satisfied as th their being such'.•-T' B* 0.877-20/7.

IK 3^ 2 . While I appreciate the v&gt;^w of Sir Francis Humphrys (see his despatch No. 188/5/135 dated the 22nd February 1935) that the practice whereby Political Officers in the G-ulf have hitherto made private visa arrangements with His Majesty’s Consul at Basra, of which other Consular Officers are left in ignorance, is open to objection, I venture to think that it is unnecessary to circulate the present proposed rules to His Majesty’s Consular and Passport Control Officers. 3. Under paragraph 7 of Foreign office circular No. V' ^ 2117/593/378 da'ced the 10th March 1932, no visa can t be granted to a foreign subject without previous reference OM' 1 ' to the Political Agent, Bahrain. In paragraph 8 of the draft circular enclosed in Mr,Bland’s letter No.T 2329/ 582/378 dated the 15th March 1935 to the Under Secretary of State, India Office, it is contemplatea that this limitation shall be extended to all w omen of European race. For practical purposes, I think that the above limitations are appropriate for the guidance of passport issuing officers (other than His Majesty’s Consul at Basra and your own passport issuing officer) and I should prefer not to extend to them the discretion allowed by the draft rules. The draft rules have been designed i ' for the sole purpose of saving His majesty’s Consul, Basra, and the Political Agent, Bahrain, (and naturally your own passport issuing officer, if you think it useful) needless work in making references in the case- 2 - of the constant coming and going of the ordinary popula tion of the Persian Gulf with whom they are familiar and who have, however, for political and other reasons to he shepherded rather carefully, 4, In the circumstances, 1 venture to suggest that the draft rules should he approved by us for the guidance of His Majesty*s Consul, Basra (and your own passport issuing officer if you so wish) and the Political Agent, Bahrain. 5. I agree that the draft rules appear slightly cumhersome and have taken the opportunity afforded hy a recent visit to Bahrain to discuss them with the Assistant Political Agent (in the absence of the Acting Political Agent) and the Adviser to the Bahrain Govern ment. I now enclose revised rules which will, I think, meet Mr, Hurst’s criticism, while leaving the rules equally effective.&lt; The following regulations regarding” visas for Bahrain supplement and amplify the instructions contained in Foreign Office Circular T 2117/593/378 of the 10th March 1932. may, in the absence of special circumstances, he granted without reference to the Political Agent, to the following: (a) British Subjects except women travelling alone, lb) Merchants of Iraqi nationality or who are subjects of States and Shaikhdoms on the Arab Ooast, (c) Persons in possession of written authorisation by the Bahrain Government (in the case of Bahrain sub jects only) or the Political Agent, Bahrain, permit ting their entry. Id) Genuine Pearl Merchants of whatever nationality jjrovided they are^known as such to the passport issuing authority/ 2 .

I enolose herewith a eopy of despatoh Ho* 9/6/36 dated 12th., Mareh from His Majesty*g ambassador at Baghdad together with enclosure. Ambassador's despatch may be briefly summarised as follows;- Affairs at Baghdad drew the attention of the British Embassy there to the fast that the Political ^geat Kuwait charged only 75 fils (one rupee) for ordinary visas for Iraq whilst the normal standard fee for such visas is 750 fils ( 10 Gold Frames )* The Ministry suggested that such visas 1936 k \ SUBJECT j- VISAS FOR IRAQ, 2* The correspondence which has led up to the In December last the Iraq Ministry of Foreign and/and Laissez-Passere ( Certificates of Identity ) aiionld no longer be granted at such a trifling fee as sueh a practise eneonraged snuggling. The matter was referred to me for a® observations and fc&amp;e gist of ay reply may be gathered from the enoloseu eopy of the despatch under reference. v. fhe class of travellers with whom we are most concerned are of course British Indians living in the hrab States of the Persian Gulf who at present obtain an Iraqi visa for one rupee but who in future, if the Ambassador's suggestion is adopted, will have to pay 10 Gold Francs. This may be a hardship, but on the basis of reciprocity {since it eosts an Iraqi 10 Gold Francs to obtain a visa for India ) it would seem only fair that a British Indian should pay the same to vrisit Iraq. 4. Before actually instructing the loiitieal agents at Kuwait and Bahrain ( Political Agent Muscat will also have to be similarly instructed ) I should be grateful for 1 instrustions from Government of India. The Political Agents coneerned should also give their views. 3gd. i. C. Fowle Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Attested.

I regret, however, to have to inform you that, owing to an error on the part of the High Commission, that despatch does not accurately convey the meaning of the communication from the Director of the Passport, Residence and Nationality Department of the Iraqi ' Government to which it refers. In the High Commission despatch it is stated that that department did not rt at present desire to raise further objections to the grant of visas for Iraq by the agencies at Bahrain, Kuwait and Sharjah at a fee of Re i/-« In fact, however, the communication from the Department of Passport, Residence and Nationality reads as follows w There is no objection to the continuance of the grant of Iraqian visas at reduced fee to the | inhabitants of the Arabian States bordering the * Persian Gulf ' 3.

You will recollect that six of the nine persons mentioned by the Iraqi Government as having received visas for a fee of He 1/- only (of. the note $o.

Sir, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith translations of two notes which I have received from the Ministiy of Foreign Affairs concerning the fees charged by the Political Agents at Kuwait and Bahrain in respect of entrance visas for Iraq. On receipt of these notes I enquired of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf if it was in fact the practice of these agencies to grant entry visas for Iraq for a fee of 75 fils (l/6d. or Ks l/-) instead of the standard rate of 10 gold Francs. A copy of Colonel Fowle T s reply is enclosed, and also a further despatch which I am sending him on this subject. From these it will be seen (1) that, in 1932, the Director of the Department of Passport, Residence and nationality informed the High Commission that the Iraqi Governmenthad no objection to the continuance of the grant of entry visas for Iraq at a reduced fee to the w inha- bitants of the Arabian States bordering the Persian Gulf', but suggested that if it was desired to continue this practice, reciprocity should be Introduced in respect of Iraqi nationals desiring to visitthose states; (2) that, owing to an error on the part of the High Commission, the Political Resident was given to understand that the Iraqi Government had agreed to the grant of visas at Kuwait, Bahrain and Sharjah at a fee of &amp; l/- irrespective of the nationality of the applicant; Honourable thony Eden, M.C.,M.P.,- 2 ~ (iii)/ have (3) that no steps^ae yet been taken to grant reciprooity to Ira^i subjects; (4) that, in view of (2) above, I have recommended, to Colonel Powle that the Political Agents at Kuwait and Bahrain should cease forthwith to grant visas at less than the standard v rate of 10 Cold Francs to any hut the inhabitants (that is, u - nationals) of the Arab States in the Persian Gulf; ~ 1 (5) that Colonel Fowle considers that it would inflict hardship on those concerned if the visa fees for Kuwaitis . • : : wishing to enter Iraq, were raised; and (6) that he considers that the request for reciprocity put forward in the memorandum from the Department of Passport, Residence and Nationality is reasonable, 3. I share Colonel Fowle’s views on (5) and (6) above and I therefore venture to recommend that I may be authorised to reply to the two notes which I have received from the Iraqi Government ; on the following lines; (1) The grant of visa for Rs l/- only to persons who are not nationals of the Arab States in the Persian Gulf was due to a misunderstanding, and the Political Agents at Kuwait and Bahrain have already been instructed to charge any such persons the usual fee of 10 Gold Francs. (ii) The grant of visas for the fee of Rs 1 /- to nationals of the Arab States in the Persian Gulf is in accordance with the letter sent to the High Commission in 1932 by the Department of Passport, Residence and Nationality, Owing i to an oversight, however, the reciprocal treatment for Iraqis desiring to visit these States, which was recommended in that letter, has not been accorded. His Majesty’s Govern ment consider, however, that the proposal xor reciprocity I is reasonable and are prepared to introduce it forthwith. roic- 3 - (iii) It is hoped that the Iraqi Governiaent will, on this hasis, agree to the coninuance of the grant of entry Tisas for Iraq to Kuwaitis for a fee of Rs 1 /- only, since the charge of 10 Gold Francs would fall heavily 0 n the class of persons concerned, I would add that the reduced charge seems hardly likely to encourage smuggling from Kuwait, since smugglers, whatever their nationality, naturally avoid any frontier post and would not therefore appear to require visas at all. 4.

Your Express Letter No. 463. dated 26th. February 1936. Visa Fees and Certificates of Identity. The Government of India consider that the present practice whereby certificates of Identity have been issued by the Political Agents at Bahrain, Kuwait and Miscat to British and British Indian subjects as well as to subjects of Bahrain, Kuwait, Muscat, and the Irucial Coast Shaikhdoas, should be discontinued. In future British and British Indian jubjects should be required to take out regular passports. It is understood that in practice certificates of identity, which in future should be confined to subjects of the Julf States, are only issued on the Trucial Coast, in as much as the Rulers of Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat have themselves either taken, or are about to take, measures to require their subjects to take out their own passports. The Government of I n dia consider that the procedure for issue of certificates of identity shiuld be standardised, the certificate of identity being issued free of charge, and the holder being subjected to a fee of Rs l/~ only when a visa is granted for travel between Gr&amp;lf ports or between such ports and India. 3 . To conform to the above the cost of a visa on British passport for travel between Arab Ports in the Gulf or for a visit from India to such ports will be fixed at Us l/- only. No visa will be required on such passport for a journey to India* Issue of the above has been authorised. (Sd) 0. Caroe. Deputy Secretary to the Government of India.

Whatever the actual practice is on the Trucial Coast with regard to Arab nationals (British Indian subjects of the area do not come into the picture as they are not indigent and undesirable vide para 1 . of your letter) the correct procedure v should be as follows A \ if# 2 . in regard to nationals of the Trucial Coast SheiAhs the Residency Agent aets as passport Officer for the Bahrain Government - as well as for the other Arab States and as well as for India and Iraq, (vide para 5 (c) of your letter)* As far as Bahrain is concerned therefore any 'Trucial Coasti' wishing to visit that State should in the first instance obtain/ MFP—1516 S&amp;P—(M-2089)—2-4 35—200,0 00obtain a travel document of some sort, letter or otherwise (since the Trucial Coast rulers do not issue regular passports) permitting him to visit Bahrain* This corresponds to the endorsement on a regular passport. The intending traveller should then take this document to the Residency ^gent who visass it for Bahrain subject **vto whatever restrictions the Bahrain Government in consultation with the Political £gent may like to impose* It is then up to the Bahrain Government to stop the landing in Bahrain of any Trucial Coasti who is not in possession of a document from the Sheikh duly visaed by the Residency ^gent. 3. It is obvious that if this procedure is strictly carried out an adequate control will be effected over the entry of Trucial Coastis into Bahrain but it is equally obvious that it would entail considerable inconvenience on all individuals (desirable as well as undesirable^) wishing to visit Bahrain since e.g. the intending traveller from Abu Dhabi will have to visit Sharjah in order to get his from the Residency Agent. The inconvenience could b by the Residency Agent giving a visa valid for any number of journeys during the year. Bearing the above considerations in mind please let me know what course of action you wish to be carried out. risa ! bipooeti i! I [9 With regard to Qatar what are your recommendations ?

Travellers to ’Iraq fall under three Categories, namely, ’A’, ’B 1 and ’C*. Any cases of doubt with regard to persons within these categories or in which the bona fides of the applicant is not fully established, should be referred to the ’Iraqi Government with whom rests the final decision as to the admission of any individual to ’Iraq. 9. Women from Europe and from the United States who wish to reside in ’Iraq in places other than Baghdad,Basrah and Mosul, are required to fill in a Kesidence Permit form which will be issued to them for this purpose. 10. TRANSIT VISAS. Under Summary Visa Regulations, the period of the validity of the transit visa cannot exceed that of the visa of destination. It is also laid down under the head ’Transit Visas’ in the same Regulations that 'When an alien, not of the immigrant class, applied for a transit visa, he should be requested to produce proof that he is passing straight through the United Kingdom or some other British Possession. If such proof is not forthcoming, the Ordinary Visa shouldthe California Arabian Standard Oil C 0 inpany and who have not a visa on their passport to land in Bahrain are usually permitted to land on payment of the full visa fee of 10 gold dollars.

Cautions. No one should be given a visa for Kuwait if he is proceed ing there in search of work. Undesirables, suspicious persons and persons without ostensible means of living are not to be given visas for Kuwait, as they would be refused permission to land there. TRUCIAL OMAN SUBJECT S. Pas snorts. There is no passport system on the Tpucial Coast. Certificates of Identity. The Residency Agent, Sharjah, issues C e rtificates of Identity for Tpucial Coast subjects valid for one year for the journey to any of the Gulf ports and I n dia. He issues travel permits also for Iranians residents on the Trucial Coast available for the single journey only. Trucial Shaikhs also grant a form of permit to their subjects for the journey to Bahrain and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf other than Iranian ports. As regards the issue of Certificates of Identity, travel permits or visas to Persians or other foreigners on the Tpucial Coast for the journey to Bahrain, the Residency Agent, Sharjah, has been instructed to refer all such cases to the Political Agent, Bahrain, before a Certificate of Identity or a Travel Permit is issued. The Residency Agent, Sharjah, also issues Certificates of I den t i ty\f o r British subjects and foreignbe granted, but only if the applicant qualifies for it under the general regulations”. Ordinarily a person coming to Bahrain on a transit visa is expected to go straight on as soon as he can get a dhow or other onward transport. In the past it has been the practice not to insist on the payment of a full visa fee until 14 days have elapsed from the date of the arrival of the traveller, and that, if anyone overstays this period, he or she is called upon to pay the full visa fee. It should be well in future to insist more rigidly on persons holding a transit visa going on as soon as transport can be got. 11. GEg SR AL remarks. Care must be tahen to see that political agitators, undesirables and suspicious persons and persons who are subject to Foreign Office Circulars are not granted visas without making full and complete enquiries and reference (in the case of the latter category) to the authorities concerned.

If the adoption of this proposal meant involving you in a lot of extra work in the issue of certi ficates to all the female dependents of the Oil Company I would prefer to replace it by something else which would attain the same end, but I gather from paragraph I (a) of the copy of the Bahrain visa rules sent to me under Printed ft Letter Ho. 727-29/7 of the 28th 19S5, that female Ct-'&gt; dependents of the Company are already obliged to nave certi ficates of no objection, and therefore that my proposal would not jln-vdlv® you in any extra work. But I should be glad of your views on this point and ox any suggestions you may to have for alterations/this clause of the circular which would make it comprehensive, 'without making compulsory the rexerence of any class of person, to whom the Bahrain Government is unlikely to object.

Any suggestion tending to mitigate the difficulty and expense of getting from Bahrain to Iran is to 'be welcomed and there appears t.o he no reason why you should not issue transit visas to persons who are going to Iraq, simply to obtain their duplicate papers for a visit to Iran. 3. The passport should be stamped clearly 'Transit Visa' and the holder should be told that it is good for a single Journey only and allows a stay of fifteen days in Iraq.. The phrase 'in transit to Iran' should not, however, appear on the passport, because it would be difficult to Justify if the Iraq Government were to raise difficulties. Their rule for transit visas is that they 'may be granted to persons, the intention of whom is merely to pass through Iraq, provided they are in possession of sufficient funds for their Journey to their destination and have obtained a visa or other permission to enable them to enter the country of their ultimate destination'. Since the persons with whom we are concerned are going to Basrah precisely in order to obtain a visa for Iran, they would not come into the category of those to whom transit visas may be granted, if their passports gave any indication that Iran was theirtheir destination. Eat it seems to be perfectly justifiable to give a plain transit visa to anyone who is only visiting Iran, as long as theix ultimate destination is, for instance, Bahrain, or any other place which they can enter without let or hindrance. 4 . In the case of persons who intend to reside in Iran or to pass through it into some country for Miich they have no visa, it will not, therefore, be possible to grant a transit visa, and an ordinary visa at 10 gold francs will have to be given. 5 .

I have the honouif to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.2074 of August 11 on the subject of visas required by passengers leaving Bahrain by Imperial Airways westbound planes. 2. The only visas required by British subjects travelling by this route to the United Kingdom are transit visas for Iraq and for Egypt. You yourself are, I understand, authorized to grant a visa for Iraq. \ As regards Egypt a visa is certainly not obtainable at | the AirPci* here. Whether it is obtainable at Alexandria I cannot say, and I suggest you make inquiry on this point of H.M.Consul-General at Alexandria. . 5 . As regards persons other than British subjects, e.g. citizens of the United States, I can speak with certainty only as to visas for British or British mandated territory. Thus visas are required for Palestine (transit visa) and for the United Kingdom, and my impression is that you are authorized to grant these. I do not know what other visas are required, other than that for Iraq, which I imagine you are authorized to grant also* Such visas might be those for Egypt, Greece, Italy and France. None of these could be obtained at the Air Port here.

Wo. 2308-29/3=0. 10th September 1936. V I enclose a copy ©f Residency Express Letter No. 841 dated the 15th April 1936 9 which we have apparently never answered* My attention was drawn to it by Pyman* 2* I have ascertained from the Passport Officer that he permits Trucial and Qatar subjects to ifmd without a visa A from the Residency Agent, Sharjah, if they bear a pass signed by their own Shaikh or the Director of Customs, Qatar, stating that the traveller is his subject, ©r a Qatar subject, respect ively* The Passport Officer requires a visa signed by the Residency Agent, Sharjah, from foreiimers resident on the Trucial Coast who wish to enter Bahrain. 3* I have told him that in my opinion this is incorrect but that he may kindly continue the present system until I can ascertain your views. 4. It seems to me entirely wrong that people should come into Bahrain without a British visa? and incidentally we are allowing the Bahrain Government to pocket the landing fees instead ©f getting the visa fees ourselves* 5* On the other hand, we do not, I think, want to impede i travel between Gulf Ports as in paragraph 3 of the enclosure, nor do we wont to penalize Trucial subjects by making them pay 10 gold francs for a visa* 6. It has, however, been accepted that subjects of Gulf States can travel anywhere in the Gulf for Rs.l/- single journey. (Incidentally, the Bahrain Government landing fees are2 . art Rs#2/-)« So if we enforce the visa rule, we could give them a visa at Rs.l/- for single journey, or Rs.7/- for any number of journeys within 12 months, if they prefer it. Question of the inconvenience ©f going t© Sharjah for a visa, remains. Sending a travel document for visa is just as much of a business on the T r ucial coast as going in person. It has, however, been done in the past, and can continue t© be done. 8* My own opinion is that we should apply tie same methods to Trucial subjects as we do to other foreigners. That is to say, if they come to Bahrain with a visa from the British consular authorities in their part of t he world (be it San Francisco or Sharjah), they come in without ques tion. If they come without a visa, they may be permitted t© land at the discretion of the Bahrain Passport Officer, and their papers sent by him to the Agency for visa. In this case t hey take their chance ©f being refused permission to land. Qatar subjects can perfectly well get a *No Objection Certificate* from the Political Agent, Bahrain, and Trucial subjects apply to the Residency Agent, Sharjah for a visa, if they choose. 9. Arising from this question, I should like to ©pen the matter of the traffic with the mainland. First let me say that I realize that this should be as free from restriction a s possible. As you know, when Americans come ever from the mainland, the passports are sent to the Agency, and they are charged Hs.27/2/- * I see no reason whatever why Muscat!, Saudi, Kuwaiti, etc., subjects should not also, if permitted to land by the Bahrain Passport Officer, pay their Rs.l/- te the Agency for visa, or Rs.7/- fer any number of journeys within 12 months if they like, or3 I t •'V ®r ev«n they wont a transit visa, instead of paying landing fees t® the Bahrain Government as they do at present* 10# The Passport Officer estimates the average number landing from the mainland at 20 a day, and from the Trucial Coast 2400 have landed in the last 6 months. So if this were converted into rupees, and set off against the wages of an extra clerk, who could accompany the Pass port Officer and bring the passports requiring visa t© the Agency for stamping, we should still have a balance of revenue* 11. Gulf State subjects would benefit by paying only &amp;•!/- to the Agency instead ©f Hs*2/- t® the Bahrain Gov ernment. Saudi subjects might lose, as the Bahrain Government charges them only as.8/- landing fees from the mainland; but as most of them travel backwards and forwards continously, it would be t® their great a dvantage if they could get a 12— month visa at Rs*7/— , the amount which normally ©nly secures them 14 journeys* 12. I should be grateful for your views, se that I can put up an answer t© the Residency Express Letter enclosed. s? Captain T.

(b) was refused because the second sub-paragraph of paragraph 45 states that Emergency Certificates are 'only to be issued for a direct journey to a place in the British Empire'• 4.

'To. 1549&gt; dated the 3rd August 1856, have the honour to invite their attention to the previous correspondence relative to the application for visa for ’hiwait and Bahrein of an Traci subject, aser al Baj Ahmed and to state that the Consulate as it appears hove restricted the grant of visas to these two States unless the applicant proves that he is a (1) craftsman or has work and (2) that he is not an undesirable. In reply to condi tion No. (1) it annears/the Futasarri fiyeb that whot is described in the passport of a person as regards his profession is quite enough, as what is stated therein is described quite clearly as to what the t raV e ler’s occupation is. This, however, does not prevent the traveller to engage himself in another occupation in his power for example as a tradesman for ever or for example a Person who we describe as a ship builder can adopt the occupation of a black-smith and call himself as such later on. As regards condition No.(2) that the traveller should prove that he is not an undesirable. This could always be answered by thd Iraqi Authorities, who are ready to supply the information whenever the Consulate ask* them for it, and which is the safest thing to do, as it is difficult for a traveller to nrove what is required of ' * unless he produces an official certificate. While taking into consideration the above, ihe Mutasarrifiyeh requests the Consulate to look again into the request of the applicant in question with a view to grant him the necessary visa under advice to them (the Mutasarrifiyeh).

(O'fVUj. lUjA^f , Will you kindly refer to your letter No. 1975- 29/7 dated the 1st August 1936 about the proposed Bah- I 'IX rain G-overnment Landing Begulation; 2. i agree in principle that some form of regula tion is necessary to enable the Political Agent to aeal with persons who evade the passport regulations, bbt 1 see certain objections to the draft regulation enclosed in your letter. 3, Clause (3) is not quite logical. The Bahrain Government can hardly refuse permission to land in Bah rain to Bahrain subjects isave in the extreme case cl a banished man, which is hardly practical politics now- a-days) and all other persons are foreigners and so would come under the King’s Regulation. Klso, i ^ j ~ true that Palestine has a somewhat similar list of per sons who will not be admitted, out the circumstances there are rather different and it places the visa issuing authorities in a position of some difficulty. / 4, 1 do not think that any exception shculcl oe made of ficial I v for Iranian subjects. An Iranian is a fo reigner, so should have a visa, and if his Government wish/--2- wisti to make it impossible for him to get the requi site visa to come to Bahrain, it is not for us pffi- £iii]JLiL to help him evade the wishes of his own Grovern- ment. Be can always sup rosa , as hitherto, help our friends, our unfriends are not wanted in Bahrain. 5. Two other considerations arise if the rather wide exceptions in clause 4 la) to le) were given cut officially, firstly, they might he twisted later on, possibly before the League, into some acknowledgement on our part that Iran really had some rights in Bah rain and, secondly, 1 am afraid that sub-clauses Ic), Id) and le) might open the gate to a flood of unwanted Iranians entering Bahrain. 6. 1 think that we should be guarded over subjects of Sa*udi Arabia, who come from a mainland port, and make their admission, without a visa only permissive. 7. i think that Note lb) is rather dangerous, be cause a transit visa is usually held to cover 'passing straight through' a place lsee Summary of fisa Regu lations, under head 'Transit Visas'). Such a note might enable persons to come to Bahrain on a transit visa, which might possibly be given when an ordinary visa would not be granted. 3. Personally, 1 feel that a very general regula tion similar to that which enabled the Political Resi dent to deal in the past with evasions of the passport rules under the 'Persian leasts and Islands Ordei in King's Regulation which is, I think. Council' would be more suitable. enough/-i -x- vK enough to enable the Political Agent to leal with tie situation. If you agree, please telegraph the one word •VISAS*, hut if not we will discuss the guesticn when 1 come over to Bahrain. 9, The King's Regulation does not cater for a Bahrain subject guilty of abetment, but the Bahrain Government might issue an 'alan on the lines of tpe King's Regulation to cover this possibility.1&gt; 114 vx 1 o iij(jrUjLeiTl Ol'i I BAUKAIN.

His Britannic Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsDraft Letter. f -rr / To The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi. \A$ Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the Political / Agent, Bahrain, has represented that the Bahrain Govern ment are deeply concerned about the number of destitute persons who obtain entry into Bahrain, especially from native craft, without passports or visas. The number of such persons has greatly increased lately owing to the hope of obtaining employment in the Bahrain Petroleum com^sny’s Oil Field and the Bahrain Government regard it as essential that measures should be taken to exclude undesirables of this type. I entirely concur. 2. When these undesirables are Bahrain subjects it is of course the business of the Bahrain Government to deal with them* Nearly all these undesirables are, however, foreigners (Iraqis, Persians, etc.), with a few British Indians, who under the Bahrain Order in Council can only be dealt with by the Political Agent. But it is not an offence under the Bahrain Order in Council for this class of person to enter Bahrain in the circumstances described in paragraph i of this lett er • 3. As you are aware the normal procedure for introducing new legislation over British and foreign I, 5 - subjects in Bahrain is - under Section'?© (a) of the Bahrain Order in Council - to apply by a King-s Regula tion to such subjects the relevant edict (’Alan) by which /-2- i VH X wtiicii the Bahrain Government make such legislation applicabl to their subjects. In this instance, however, no proper Bahrain Government edict exists on Mihich we can issue a King’s Regulation. There is no proper machinery in -existence at the present time with which to deal with such .jr cases. There is an old Bahrain Government Order which ! purports to govern the landing of persons at Bahrain, but as this Order is obscure and many of its Sections are now out of date, it is unsuitable for use to-day. U 4. captain Hickinbotham, when Acting Political Agent, Bahrain, suggested, after consultation with the Bahrain Government, a Bahrain Government Landing Regula tion and a King’s Regulation making it applicable to those persons to whom the Bahrain Order in Council applies. But the proposed Bahrain Government Landing j. Regulation is rather complicated and in some respects unsuitable. 5 . in the circumstances, therefore, I recommend the issue of a simple King’s Regulation, of which a draft is attached. It is based generally on King’s Regulation No.2 of 1924 issued under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council. V v «. Th. acaie of t aoiaaai.r.t i. .tailor to that l.ii do., in th. i»ii» (mr ' 1920&gt; ’ 1 .hoold, however, e*pl«i» thetArtid. 4 i. doelgned to ^ . stop to . practice, which he. 8 ro,n up, cf Iren... .. ,,^13 bringing over destitute persons and and other vessels bring other undesirables for a small fee and landing them by subterfuge. If the masters of the vessels know that, f ■ V' -3- they render their vessels liable to detention, or even sale, they will be less likely to carry on this traffic and the owners of the vessels will take steps to see that their vessels are not so used* / 7* With reference to paragraph 5 of the draft King's Regulation. Since it will be some time before the King's Regulation can come into force, and since in the meantime destitutes will be entering Bahrain, I think the Political Agent should be given under the King's Regulation some powers to deal with such individuals. 8.

Memorandum Reference our discussion on Passport and nationality questions based on Howes 1 note of* the l?th November 1936. technically correct to charge visa fees at 10 gold francs for each of the Trucial Coast Shaikhdoms, in view of the number of these Sheikhdoms, and their proximity to each other, (a distance in some cases of only a few miles) we agreed that this procedure ^ would place an unfair financial burden on travellers to these Shaikhdoms, especially on the poorer of our own subjects - British Indians. If one of the latter, for instance, in the course of his business wanted to visit all the Shaikhdoms in question, from Qatar to Kalba ( the area which for uassport purposes can be included in the term Trucial Coast) he would have to pay 70 gold francs 1 A further objection would be that such an individual for natural motives of economy might only take out a visa for one Sheikhdom and then on arrival there might well find that he could do his business at another adjacent Sheikhdom, but not having obtained a visa for this Shaikhdom would be debarred from visiting it. Since it was impracticable Paragraph 1 of Mote. While it would be to2 to temper the wind to the shorn lamb and charge a high rate of visa fees for members of the Petroleum Concessions Limited, who can well afford it, and a low rate for the British Indian, we agreed that one visa, fee of 10 gold francs would be charged for all the Trucial Coast (Qatar - Kalba) area. We *also agrees, however, that the term Trucial Coast should not appear on the passport; the actual Shaikhdoms for which the visa was valid should be noted. The a Ivantage of this is that if we wish, for any reason, to limit any individuals* travels to certain ordinarily be made valid for any number of journeys Petroleum Concessions Limited, for instance, that while British subjects pay 10 gold francs for a visa Americans will have to pay the 'retaliatory** fee above procedure I should approach the Foreign Office and the Government of India for sanction.

As we have excellent reasons for adopting the procedure I do not suppose that they Shaikhdoms we can do so.

In these will3. will make any objection, and I daresay will be relieved at having one passport problem at least solved, on tlie spot** 4. Paragraph 2 of note. We were not agreed on this point since you thought, on general principles and with a view to keeping control in the Political Agent's hands, the present practice should continue, while I was of opinion that it should he discontinued. T.ly arguments were that in the first place, under the Foreign Office passport rules nationals returning to their own country require no visa, though in certain countries they require from the police of those countries a 'Permit to leave'; but this of course has nothing to do with visas. In the second place, the control of the Political Agent under this practice of preventing individuals in certain cases from leaving Bahrain does not appear to be very effective, as instances had occurred of absconders etcetera successfully escaping from Bahrain. Apparently this is not very difficult to do as the absconder, etcetera in question can, by bribing a nakhoda, make his get-away by dhow. If it is a case of a creditor wishing to stop a debtor from leaving the island he can always apply to the Court for an injunction to that effect. The present practice undoubtedly entails more work on your office and gives more trouble to intending travellers. Finally it is only nationals returning direct to their own country who would be affected i.e. Indians to India, Iraqis to Iraq. Individuals wishing to visit other countries or having to pass throughyVu&gt; 4* tlarough other countries on the way to their own country would still have to get a visa or transit visa as the case might be* All things considered, unless you car- produce very strong reasons in favour of it, I think the practice should be discontinued. 5 . Paragraph 3(a) of note. The point noted in this paragraph hardly seems to arise. An Emergency Certificate can be issued to the individual concerned for his country of origin and transit visas can be put on this certificate. For such countries as the Political Agent is Passport Officer e.g. British Empire and r Iraq, these visas can be granted by the Political Agent. In other cases the traveller will have to obtain the visa from the first passport officer of the country or countries which he has to Paragraph 3(b) of note. Te agreed that photographs should not be required for Emergency traverse.

The Persians were put in the favourable position apparently by the orders of the Political President ( vide Bush ire letter ITo. 1390 dated the 9th July 1932) and the order could presumably be cancelled by another order of the Political Resident. It might be laid down for instance that a Persian could only go to TnrHg on a visa costing 10 gold francs. I will consider this point at Eushire. 8 . Reference paragraph 6 of note. Any person bora in Bahrain, when the Bahrain Rationality Law is promulgated, will regain a Banrain subject unless he contracts out by registration at the Agency. But doubtless there are a number of cases in which the ^Iraq Nationality Laws conflict with those of Bahrain. In such case the individuals concerned are of dual nationality: i.e. in ‘Iraq they will be ‘Iraq subjects, throughout the British Empire they will be Bahrain subjects and in 'neutral' countries, according to the laws and practice of tnese countries. visas granted at Re.l/- to Trucial subjects for travel 9 ''here is also tne question of rnaKlng ^iie on the Arab coast, valid for 12 mentis instead c_ single journey ( vide your Express Leiter i.o. 255. at ter ITo. 2553 of 10 thXOth October 1936).

Political Agency, Bahrain, the 21st April 1937. To Imperial Airways Limited, Bahrain. Dear Sirs, A case recently occurred in which an emergancy night halt of the Westbound Service was made at Bahrain. An American employee of n &gt;e Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, who had been dismissed by the Company and ho was awaiting the aeroplane, took a number of the passengers to the New Camp and entertained them. As far as I am aware none of the passengers had a visa for Bahrain. 2 . It is requested that steps may be taken to ensure that travellers without a visa for Bahrain do not leave the Imperial Airways 1 Canp on the landing ground at Buharraq. Yours faithfully,/ I have the honour to report that by the terms of a recent regulation, No.45 of 1936, the Minister of the Interior is authorized, in the case of a group of Iraqi nationals wishing to leave Iraq for abroad in one party, to issue a single passport in the name of the ledder of the party together with a list of the names of the other members of the party. 2. Since it appeared to me to be probable that I should, sooner or later, be approached with a request for visas for Bahrain on a travel document of this nature I consulted the Foreign Office as to what should be my attitude in the matter. 3. The Foreign Office have now instructed me that the acceptance or otherwise of a collective travel document iB a matter for the decision of the authorities of the territory for which the bears are bound, and have authorized me to ascertain from you direct whether you are prepared to give me general discretionary powers, without * ad hoc f reference in each case, to affix visas in cases/which I am satisfied that the applicants are genuinely members of the same organization and that there is no objection to their entering Bahrain arising from the regulations governing the grant of visas for that country; it being of course understood that a full visa fee must normally be charged in respect of each individual comprised in the party, and that any request for a modification of visa charges must be referred to the Foreign Office. Political Agent, k- I BAHRAIN.■uam* i-7' -2- I shall be glad to learn whether you are prepared to give me discretionary powers as described in the preceding paragraph.

This is no doubt intended to apply to foreigners resident in Iran and not to tourists and other travellers from abroad. Nevertheless cases have arisen in which travellers on quite short visits have had trouble owin to failure to produce a taxation certificate when applying for an exit visa ? and one had recently to e-e obtained for a visitor from Baghdad who spent no more than nine days in the country. It therefore seems desirable to draw attention to a method oy whicn travellers can ensure that they escape this diiiicinUy. The' Iranian Government have rocmtly institute a J ‘Tourist permit*'' which can be obtained by travellers from Iranian Diplomatic and Consular Representatives abroad. The tourist permits have no fixed t^im ox validity, but can only be given to temporary visitors to Iran. Holders of such cards will not be requireu to produce any taxation certificates, nor to obtain *‘?errnis de s&amp;jour” nor the exit permits normally roquiie,.. t0 leave the city of Tehran. It appears also rhat at tne frontiers and at the police posts along the roads, tourist permits ensure prompt attention, and m geneial His Excellency, - - - • ■ The Right Honourable r T q.c.I.E., The Marquess of ^ ' 8bC. . it/-it is clear that their holders are saved manjr ol the vexatious delays which do so much to spoil the pleasure of travelling in Iran, Further, if their use becomes general among travellers, His Majesty?s Legation and Consulates should he saved much routine work, and I should therefore he grateful for any action which the Government of India may he able to take to bring the existence of the tourist permits to the notice of travellers proceeding to Iran. In particular Army Headquarters may he interested in ihe per mi gs , which should he a gredt convenience to officers travelling through this country. ^ 3.

Sir, It has Been brought to my notice that the Central Police authorities have issued instructions to the Police in the provinces to refuse an exit visa to a foreign subject unless he is in possession of a certifi cate from the Finance Department stating that he has duly paid his income-tax and other charges. This requirement is not likely to cause difficulty unless application is made for an exit visa in some district other than that in which tho applicant normally resides in which case it will be impossible for the local Finance Department to give the necessary certificate, and much delay may be caused. It therefore appears desirable that British suojects should be warned of these new instructions, and I shall be grateful if you will take such steps as may be possible to bring them to the notice of British subjects in your district, aid will suggest tha.t when a British subject leaver one district for another, he should eirner obtain o. clearance certificate from the Finance Department or alternatively should keep his receipts for income-tax and other taxes. 2 ' I am sending copies of this despatch to the rovlment of India, under cover of the despatch of Government ox xuu , Majesty’s principal which I enclose a copy, and^to hi i j r-t -p ■foy’ Persian Affails No# i ana oo n Secretary of ^taoe lor 101 -itn 1 «■ . .

Heading. Pros. NOTES. 19 Nos. Subject CONSUL AR. Passport and Visa Regulations I I c i' Ik number of Bahrainis produced their passports at the Agency for visas for 'Iraq. On page 4 of their passports it was noticed that an endorsement making the passport valid for • ‘Persia’ was entered. 2. it appeared that the holders were going to 'Iraq and to keshed (Khorassan) on a pilgrimage. I telephoned to the Adviser. (,as it seemed unwise that they should use a Bahrain passport endorsed for Persia for entering Persia) and he told me that they knew that when they entered Persian territory they should not produce their Bahrain passports and that the Persians treated them as Persian subjects and let them in. 3. In the circumstances it seemed best to let them have the endorsed passport, as our attitude is that their passports must be made valid for Persia, a foreign country. 28-2-1S35. -iroifl Btuiiiie, Bushire printed letter Bo. 0 B 6 datea Bushireprinted letter Ho. 372 dated 16-Bil^3o. -4g. 1 . 1 .

Bushire. 21. p.52 Para.E of this Z«L« does not represent the present passport system on the T'rucial Coast and also the procedure laid down at para,3 thereof does not seem helpful. It, would, of course, entail a great inconvenience on travellers irom the Trucial towns if they are required to go to Sharjah and obtain a Certificate of Identity from the R.A* there. The practice hitherto has been that subjects of the Trucial Coast travelling by sailing boats are given permits by their own Rulers for entry into Bahrain. For travelling by steamer, they are given Certificates of Identity by the R.A.? Sharjah^with the exception of subjects of the jLi uler of lubai who can travel by steamer on a permit farom the Ruler of luoai,2 s/r^. n «ihat we were wanting was tnat, as ^uite a number of indigent and sometimes undesirable persons try to come to Bahrain by ohow in search of work.the R.A*Sharjah may be instructed not to give visas (i) to anyone who is indigent or who only wishes to seek work at Bahrain or (iij to any Iranian who has only recently come over to the Trucial Coast from Iran, or (iii) to persons of any nationality other than Trucial Coast or Iranians who are known to him as living permanently on the Trucial Coast. ( set p.48). Vie have not, however, received any information from p.R. whether this may be done. There is another important point which was not referred to Bushire, namely, the nuler oi Luoai giving permits to foreigners such as Iranians, Muscatis, Saudi ^rabs and others who came to Bahrain by steamer( ana who apparently coula not get visas or travel permits from the R.A-Sharjah), as the Bahrain Government have objected to this procedure, vide reports from the i&gt;ssport oiiicer at po.21, 26, 27 , 31 and 34,-we may enquire from wiietner , he approves that the Ruler of ~ubai may be askea not to issu permits to anyone other than his subjects for the journey to Bahrain. Our main object was that adequate control may be ? effected over the entry of indigent foreigners into Baiirain ( ana not only irucial Coast suojects as mentioned at para. 3 of this X*u*;• as regards *&amp;tar, since the Bahrain Government have &gt; tH , Question so far, it seems preferable not to not raised this q_ut~bi-m ~ ^ . !; take it up.

As the r.A. is not authorised to issue passports he, under Consular Instructions, cannot issue dkergency Cexfiiicates, vine last para, of p.108, but, as he has been authorised by the P.B., vide the last sentence of para.3 of this X.i**, we may start issuing Emergency Certiiicates and take this as authority for doing so. have to follow the Consular Inst ructions with reagrd to the use oi this sort oi travel document. npf. para. 3:, We have not been charging any fee for visas granted to British subjects proceeding co India uor have we been stamping passpoits in the manner describe; therein, ihis might be the practice in Kuwait. .&lt;e Jaave, however, been giving free endorsements on passports oi British subjects going h Wa* have not so- far | prevented any British subject from going to India and ^ therefore, this question does not arise here. ,ie may, subject to your orders, reply that tne procedure laid down at para.4 of this X.n.is not in vogue h ere and that we may be supplied with 200 copies ol n.G. foms for use here. may also enquire whether we should; use Indian Oourt fee stamps to the value ofo shillings and six pence. 7 2b/b/3b Iss ue« 4.7.39 to P.E. .3»s3iro.|Qjl J isa application Form for travel documents issued by Bahrain Agenc y.
