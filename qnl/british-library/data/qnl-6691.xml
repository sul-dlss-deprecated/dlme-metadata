REPORT ON THE 192 ^ OF PERSIA to June, 1923. BY 1923. Price 9d. Net.DEPARTMENT OF OVERSEAS TRADE. COMMERCIAL REPRESENTATION ABROAD. To foster British overseas trade, the Department lias developed and controls the following services of Commercial Intelligence Officers : 1. In the Empire. The Trade Commissioner and Imperial Trade Correspondent Services. At the present time there are 12 Trade Commissioners’ offices. These are situated, four in Canada (Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Winnipeg) ; two in South Africa (Johannesburg, Capetown) ; two in Australia (Mel bourne, Sydney) ; one in India (Calcutta—to cover also Cevlon) ; and one each in New Zealand (Wellington), British East Africa ' (Nairobi) and British West Indies (Trinidad). The Trade Commissioners in the Dominions have the assistance of Imperial Trade correspondents at a number of important centres. In \ arious parts of the Empire in which at present there are no com missioners, there are correspondents with whom the Department deals direct. 2. In Foreign Countries. («) The Commercial Diplomatic Service attached to the British Diplomatic Missions. this service consists of between thirty and forty posts in all, and the officers of the service are stationed in all the moi'e important foreign markets of the world. The members of the Commercial Diplomatic Service are styled Commercial Counsellors ” in the highest grade, and ' Com mercial Secretaries in the three lower grades. They are members of the staff of the British Embassy or Legation in which they serve. The Commercial 1 )iplomatic Officer has general supervision over the &lt; ommercial work of the consular offices in his area, and, with the co operation of these two services, a complete network of Government com mercial representatives is thrown over foreign countries. The Department is represented in Persia by Mr. R. H. Hadow M C., Secretary in Charge of Commercial Affairs, Tehran. (b) The British Consular Service. Ihis service has been reorganized. Particular attention has been given to the commercial side of consular work. Members of British firms are urged to call upon the Department’s representative abroad when they visit an overseas country. It is also important that they should make a point of their representatives abroad keeping in close touch with the Department’s officers. A handbook giving fuller details of the Overseas Organization of the J epartment can be obtained on application at the Department of Overseas Trade, do, Old Queen Street, S.W.l. NOTE. It should be understood that the views expressed in annual reports arc the vii ws of the officers themselves, and are not necessarily in all respects the views of the Department.4 CURRENCY, WEIGHTS AND MEASURES AND GENERAL INFORMATION. The Unit of Weight adopted by the Persian Customs Administration, which is under Belgian direction, is the Tabriz Man, also known as the Batman, which is commonly recognized throughout Persia, though local Mans of varying weights often replace it in different parts of Persia for trading purposes. The Tabriz Man is approximately equivalent to 6 lb. 9 ozs. or 2-970 kilogrammes, and is made up of 40 Seers or 640 Meskels. 100 Batmans are equivalent to one Kharvar which is commonly used as the basis for transport charges, Kharvars being roughly equal to one ton. Two Tabriz Mans are also equal to one Shah Man. The Monetary Unit is the Kran, which has varied considerably in value during the last 18 months. 10 Krans are equivalent to one Toman, and the Kran is subdivided into 20 Shahis. For banking purposes the Kran is also divided into 100 cents, and in the bazaars it is still known as One Hazar from the fact that it was formerly divided into 1,000 Dinars (a purely mythical coin). The average Rate of Exchange for the Persian year commencing March, 1922, and ending March, 1923, was Krans 56-56 = £\ sterling, and Krans 1,000 = Rupees 365. Distances are usually measured in Farsakhs, which are equivalent to the hypothetical distance travelled by a loaded mule an hour and vary according to the nature of the country from 4 miles in flat country to 2£ in mountainous districts. The Unit of Measure for cloth and other merchandize is the Zar, which is roughly equivalent to 40£ inches and is sub-divided into 16 Girehs. This unit is also used for land measurement but varies from 39 inches to 42 inches in different parts of the country. 6,000 Zars are equivalent to one Farsakh for land measurement. Goods for Transport should usually be divided into the following weights, each load consisting of 2 bales : 1 Camel load .. .. .. .. .. lbs. 350-400 1 Mule „ lbs. 200-250 1 Donkey load .. . . .. .. .. lbs. 150-180 Country carts, and fourgons, the latter drawn by four horses, carry weights up to 1£ tons along the main roads only. Animal transport travels on an average 26 miles a day ; wheeled transport 20-30 miles. All goods should be securely packed and carried in sacking as well as waterproof material so as to minimize the risk of breakage or damage to goods in transit. Transport Rates vary, greatly according to district, the time of the year and the nature of the goods carried. In East Persia a fair average during the past year was £3 15s. Od. per ton per 100 miles for camel transport; mule and donkey rates being respectively somewhat higher and lower than the above amount. During the same period the equivalent of the average rates for animal transport were approximately* :— (1) Tehran-Isfahan (250 miles) = £9 5s. Od. per ton per 100 miles ; Isfahan-Shiraz (300 miles), ^6 10s. Od. per ton per 100 miles ; Shiraz-Bushire (200 miles), £0 per ton per 100 miles. (2) Isfahan-Ahwaz (250 miles), £14 per ton per 100 miles. Agencies. —The Persian merchant often finds it difficult on account of his lack of knowledge of foreign markets to establish direct connections with foreign firms not represented in this country, and one of the most felt wants, except in certain well-established and highly specialised lines such as piece-goods and textiles, is the establishment of suitable agencies for making known new products and putting Persian merchants in touch * These statistics have been calculated at the rate of Krans 50-^1, the rate at the end of June, 1923, being Krans 49-5-/1.5 with foreign firms. While the present trade depression lasts it is, however, doubtful whether such agencies could profitably be started. Arrangements are at present being made by the Iraq Railways for direct forwarding of merchandise from Basrah to Kermanshah and if delivery of consignments at the latter within 6 or 8 weeks from the time of shipment from Europe can be effected on delivery of bills of lading to the railway authorities, a considerable saving will undoubtedly be effected as the merchant is at present in the habit of borrowing money at rates of interest varying from 7 per cent, to 18 per cent, and even 24 per cent, from native bankers, in cases where shipment cannot properly belundertaken through foreign banks. Import Duties and Export Duties. The Persian customs dues are moderately heavy in case of imports into Persia, but light in the case of exports. Typical rates are (10 cents, equal one halfpenny):— Import Duties. Commercial samples Tea, “ white ” .. Tea, “ other ” .. Sugar Free. 6 Krans per batman (6£ lbs.) 4 50 cents to 1 Kran per batman, according to quality, plus tem porary surtax of the same amount. 1 Kran 50 cents, per batman. 1 Kran per batman. 1 2 Krans 40 cents, per batman. Various rates, roughly according to value. 1 Kran 50 cents, to 3 Krans per bat man. 15 per cent ad valorem. 20 10 15 15 ,, ,, 5 25 Krans per batman (gross weight). Matches Pepper. Curry Cotton thread .. Cotton piece goods Other piece goods Leather .. Most luxury goods Soap, scented .. Soap, other Indigo .. Bicycles, Motors, Tyres, etc. Motor Lorries .. Cigarettes, in cartons .. Cigarettes and Tobacco other .. .. .. 15 Krans per batman. The import of arms, except under special permission, is prohibited. Export Duties. —The only export duties are :— Natural gums (Assafoetida, etc.).. 4 per cent, ad valorem. Carpets, with aniline dyes Carpets, with natural dyes Pearls and precious stones Silk, raw, or in cocoon Tobacco, leaf Tobacco, manufactured Opium Butter, 1 Kran, rice, wheat, barley, etc., 10 cents., fish 10 cents., salt 5 cents. .. .. .. .. All per batman. Eggs .. .. .. .. 75 cents, per 100. Live animals : Sheep 1 Kran, cattle 10 Krans, horses 30 Krans, camels 50 Krans per head. The customs administration registers only nett weights unless gross weight is expressly declared in the existing Tariff as being assessable to duty. 12 Nil. 5 per cent, ad valorem. 1£ Krans per batman. 1 „ 3 „ 20 Krans per batman. (b41-508)q a 3The Statistics of imports and exports quoted are taken from the official customs report of 1921-1922. These statistics are admittedly not up to date but no later figures are available, except in isolated cases, since the customs administration publishes the statistics for each Persian year (beginning 22nd March) one year after. The statistics for March, 1921- March, 1922, therefore only became available in April, 1923. Every effort has, however, been made to bring the information in the report up to date (June, 1923), and the figures have only been used to illustrate the general trend of Persian trade, the condition of which has not altered materially during the past year. The report therefore covers a period from January, 1922, to June, 1923.7 REPORT ON THE TRADE AND INDUSTRY OF PERSIA. L—COMMUNICATIONS. Setting aside administrative and political difficulties which do not fall within the scope of this report, the principal difficulty with which trade has to cope is the lack of suitable or modern means of transport or of methods of interior communication. As has repeatedly been pointed out in the past, Persia, by reason of her geographical position, the difficult nature of her mountainous country and the natural inclinations of the majority of her in habitants, is in the position of a medieval merchant endeavouring to suit himself suddenly to the conditions of 20th century trade. The numerous parallel mountain ridges divide her trade routes into a series of separate entities ; she is not yet equipped with modern roads fit for motor transport; her railways are as yet only projected, and she has no means of river communication. She has therefore perforce to rely on the native cart, the camel, the mule, and the donkey, except along the three roads from Duzdap to Meshed, from Tehran to Enzeli and from Kazvin to Khanikin, where roads more or less fit for light motor transport have been made of recent years. Of these routes the first and last connect with a railway at Duzdap and Khanikin respectively and so serve as important links for Persia’s foreign trade, while from Enzeli on the Caspian, ships transport merchandize to and from Russia and the Caucasus. Yet even along these routes the burden of tolls for the upkeep and protection of the roads them selves weighs heavily on both mechanical and animal transport. From Khanikin to Tehran tolls average one kran per mile for a motor car, while the tolls along the completed carrossable roads are as follows :— No. Class of Means of Transport. Toll (repair dues per each farsakh). Observations. Krans .cents. (Shahis) 1 Donkey, bullock 0 05 (1) 2 Horse, mule, camel 0 10 (2) 3 One horse 2 wheel cart 0 30 (6) 4 Two horse 2 ,, 0 50 (10) 5 Two horse wagon 0 75 (15) 6 3 or 4 horse wagon, diligence. 1 50 (30)8 No. Class of Means of Transport.

(No motor car, or lorry carrying more than 2 tons is allowed without special permit). All means of transport without loads have to pay half the above tolls (repair dues). Main Trade Routes. —The other main routes which are indicated on the map attached to this report, with their approxi mate distances are :— (1) . Bushire-Shiraz-Isafahan-Tehran. —The road itself is not metalled and except along the portion between Bushire and Shiraz which was partly completed by the South Persia Rifles it is neither laid out nor graded, being in fact a caravan track. During the summer and autumn it is however used by country carts as well as pack animals, but the formidable passes between Shiraz and Bushire make it impossible for wheeled transport to use this section for commercial purposes. It has no bridges or culverts and the rivers and marshes make certain sections im passable during the winter and spring. Nevertheless a large portion of Persia’s foreign trade at present passes along this route. The Ministry of Public Works contemplates building this road shortly if the necessary funds are available. (2) The Ahwaz-Isfahan road through the Bakhtiari country. A caravan track used largely by pack animals and impassable for wheeled traffic. (3) The Duzdap- Kerman-Yezd-Isfahan route .—A caravan track passable at certain times of the year by light motor cars. Fre quented by merchandize using the Duzdap Railway which was extended during the war from Nushki via Dalbandin to connect India with Persia. Exporters of carpets from the Kerman district have during the past year used this route in preference to the mountainous road from Bander Abbas to Kerman, although the latest reports state that owing to raids by tribesmen on the road between Kerman and Duzdap the Bander Abbas route is again coming into use.9 Light motor lorries and Ford vans have been employed to some extent in this export trade but as in the case of almost every other road in Persia the lack of repair and petrol depots except at long distances and the rough nature of the roads necessi tates carrying an undue weight of petrol and spare parts and consequently makes it unprofitable to use motor transport in Persia except for light and valuable merchandize or for trans porting passengers. Cars used are mostly Ford touring cars or vans which on account of their simple and cheap construction and high ground clearance are popular in Persia. Should the pro jected development of proper motor roads be carried out Persia should in the absence of railways provide a good market for motor cars, light lorries and motor accessories. Price, rugged construction and simplicity are however essentials if makes not yet known in Persia are to be popularized. Higher first cost might be met by demonstrating that the cost of upkeep is appre ciably lower than that of existing makes. (4) The Bander Abbas-Kerman road.—Formerly used for the export of the greater part of the carpets and rugs made in the Kerman district and still a caravan route from the Persian Gulf for this and other merchandize to and from Central Persia. Owing to its mountainous nature it is only passable for pack animals and it is often impassable during the winter on account of snow. (5) The Tabriz- Hamadan trade route, which connects Persia in normal times with the Turkish import and export route via Trebizond. A recent revival in export of piece goods through Tabriz has brought this route into use of late but trade in North- West Persia has suffered from severe depression owing to the partial closure of the Trebizond route to Persia. The Julfa- Tabriz railway connects Persia with the Caucasian railways but is at present badly in need of repair and only occasional trains can be run when sufficient freight can be secured. (6) Tehran-Meshed —unmetalled but carrossable road much frequented by pilgrims on their way to the Holy Shrines of Iraq or of Meshed. Also used by traffic between East Persia and the Caspian Sea ports. A road to connect Tehran with the Caspian at Bandar-i-Gaz is also at present under construction. II.—TRADE AND INDUSTRY. Imports and Exports— Next to the paucity of her interior communications Persia has suffered considerably from the dis location of her pre-war import and export routes, and from the consequent necessity of redistributing her foreign trade. Prior to 1914 the bulk of her imports entered the country through Enzeli and the Caspian ports, or via Trebizond and Tabriz. Aggregate figures for 1921-1922 (the last year for which statistics are available) are given in Appendix I.10 An examination of the figures will show that only 8-4 per cent, of Persia’s foreign trade passed through the northern countries adjacent to Persia through the customs posts marked “ A,” while 91 per cent, passed through the Persian Gulf Ports, Iraq or India, by way of the Customs posts marked “ B.” The figures for the subsequent year will, it is believed, show no appreciable difference in the proportion of trade borne by these three countries, though the total amounts will not be the same, owing to the partial revival of the Trebizond route, in spite of the difficulties attending transport through the disturbed areas of Turkey, and to a slightly greater volume of trade by the Northern routes. In particular a service of small cargo steamers with a capacity for approximately 800 tons of cargo each has been started from Hamburg to Enzeli via the Russian canals and the Volga by a German firm. The first steamer reached Enzeli in November last but since that date no further steamers have reached Persian ports. It should be noted in passing that the figures quoted should not be taken as representing accurately the year 1921-1922 owing to the disturbed condition of Northern Persia at the beginning of 1921 which made it impossible for a time for the customs authori ties to obtain accurate figures for the Caspian and Azerbaijan districts. The cessation of a large proportion of the former trade with Russia has not been without effect in depressing the Persian market and the closure of the northern trade routes has further contributed to this depression by enhancing the cost of transporting goods to North Persia which is often out of all proportion to their original cost. A few Persian merchants attended the Russian fairs at Baku and Nijni Novgorod which were revived last year, but most of the native trading community is without knowledge of conditions outside Persia and except for the activities of the trading branches of the Soviet Government known as the Vnesh- torg, Centro-Soyuz and Naftkom, no Russian agencies now cater for the export trade in such commodities as dried fruits which before the War were exported in large quantities to Russia and the Caucasus through Tabriz and the Caspian ports. Russian prints which in 1914 were universally known throughout Persia have also ceased to be imported in any quantity, and the northern markets remain relatively closed to trade, except so far as Russian petrol, kerosine oil, and similar products, are imported. Russia supplies her immediate needs by exporting rice and foodstuffs and a limited amount of timber through her commercial institutions and to some extent through Persian merchants in Gilan and Baku. New Trade Routes.— This alteration of Persia’s normal trade routes has brought into prominence at least two routes which were rarely used before the war. The first of these is the Iraq route from Basrah via Baghdad to Kermanshah. This route was always popular with Persiantraders before the war and the construction of the Iraq railways from Basra to Baghdad and thence to Quaniqin near the Persian frontier has increased the facilities for importing frail or perishable goods. The virtual closure of the northern trade routes has also contributed in no small measure towards making it for the present one of Persia’s chief trade routes. From the figures in the Appendix it will be seen that imports via Kermanshah which amounted to krans 190 million in 1921-1922 exceeded in volume those of any other customs post in Persia, in spite of the 1 per cent, transit tax to which all goods passing through Iraq are sub jected. In winter caravans leave the metalled road near Hamadan and make their way to Tehran via Sultanabad and Oum or direct via Nobaran in order to avoid the Aveh Pass north of Hamadan and the intense cold of the Kazvin plain. Imports via Iraq include in particular a large proportion of the Manchester piece- goods which are still imported in large quantities, as will be seen from the figures quoted in a subsequent paragraph, although the return of the kran to its normal value and the competition of other European countries whose coinage has depreciated con siderably has tended to restrict these imports and to cut the profit on their sale to a fine point. The accumulation of stocks ordered by wholesale importers on behalf of the Persian merchants during the boom period of 1919-1920 when the kran had greatly appreciated in value was subsequently rejected by Persian merchants owing to the difficulty of paying sterling equivalents when the value of the Kran depreciated in 1921-1922. The importers were consequent!}^ forced to dispose of their accumu lated stocks for what they would fetch, and recent instances have occurred of the sale of goods in Tehran and the provinces of Persia at prices considerably below their current market price in the country of origin. The second trade route of importance is the Indian route entering Persia at Dalbandin by the Nushki-Duzdap railway. From a position of comparative importance owing to the gulf created between it and India by the Sarhad deserts Duzdap has since the construction of this railway during the war risen to be one of Persia’s principal distributing centres. The foreign trade which used this route during 1922-1923 reached a total of 87 million krans, an increase of 100 per cent, over the figures con tained in the attached table for 1921-1922. The railway besides tapping the rich grain districts of Sistan and the Kainat now feeds the districts of Kerman and Meshed, and it is probable that a large proportion of the trade which used to reach Herat, and Trans-Caspia from Russia is now supplied from India by this route. Goods exported to Persia through India by this route are entitled to a rebate of fifteen-sixteenths of the customs dues paid on foreign imports into India. Foreign Trade. —For the year 1921-1922 the first five countries trading with Persia, in their order of importance were :—12 — Imports. Exports. Total. Krans. Krans. Krans. (1) The British Empire, inclu ding India .. 462,100,000 159,000,000 621,100,000 (2) Egypt 17,500,000 199,400,000 216,900,000 (3) Russia 41,700,000 26,500,000 68,200,000 (4) Iraq 8,300,000 44,400,000 52,700,000 (5) U.S.A 5,500,000 29,500,000 35,000,000 The British Empire therefore accounted for nearly 60 per cent, of Persia’s trade, although it must be remembered that a certain quantity of the articles indexed by the customs authorities in Persia as coming from Great Britain or from India are certainly not of British manufacture or origin, but were merely consigned from these countries. This proportion has slightly decreased during the subsequent year, so far as can be ascertained, owing to a revival of trade with Italy, France and Germany in particular. The disparity between the import and export figures for the British Empire account for the depreciation of the kran on the British and Indian markets. Persia’s chief imports and exports during order of importance were :— 1921-1922 in Imports. Krans. (1) Cotton piece goods 188,600,000 (2) Sugar .. .. _ 141,300,000 (3) Nails, screws, iron piping, etc. .. 33,200,000 (4) Tea 31,300,000 Exports. Oil and kindred substances, such as petrol, benzine, etc. 322,600,000 Carpets and rugs 66,100,000 Dried and fresh fruits .. 26,900,000 Opium .. 15,400,000 Imports during the year totalled 55 per cent, of the foreign trade and exports 45 per cent. This ratio so far as can be ascertained remained virtually unchanged during the following year. Of the commodities quoted above the British Empire during the same period supplied cotton piece goods to a value of 185 million krans and tea valued at 30 million krans, as well as almost the entire quantity of Persia’s importation of nails, screws and iron piping. The chief sources of Persia’s sugar was British India which supplied 67 million krans worth ; Belgium, whence came 27 million krans worth ; and Egypt, which supplied sugar to the value of 17 million krans. It is probable that a large proportion of the sugar supplied by India is not of Indian origin, since a certain amount is known to come from the Dutch East Indies and more is probably imported in the first place from France, Egypt and other countries for re-export to Persia via Duzdap and the Persian Gulf.13 Of the exports a large portion of the oil and kindred products of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were consigned in the first place to Egypt for subsequent distribution to their ultimate destina tions, and it is to this fact that Egypt largely owes her place as the second country on Persia's foreign trade list. It is worthy of note that of Persia’s total export trade of 502 9 million krans for the year 1921-1922 the products of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company were valued at nearly 323 million krans, or 64 per cent, of the country’s exports. Rugs and carpets exported from Persia are mostly destined for the United States of America although a certain number are also sent to England and the Continent and large consignments reach the U.S.A. through British firms to whom they are sent in the first place by the agents of the latter in Persia. The value of Persia’s opium trade is accounted for by the superior morphine content of her product and by far the most profitable trade in South Persia during the year 1922-1923 has been the export of opium through the Persian Gulf. With the gathering of the new crop prices have dropped considerably, but as recently as the month of May, 1923, krans 650 to 700 per batman w 7 as obtainable at Shiraz and Bushire for this commodity. Since that date prices have fallen to one half or even one third of these figures, but the restriction of the sale of opium by the League of Nations will inevitably be a severe blow to Persia unless a substitute can be found to take its place in the extensive poppy fields of South Persia. Experiments have been made on a small scale with cotton for which the soil is said to be unsuitable, and this commodity may also be suitable for cultivation in Sistan, but the opium growers at present look with misgiving at the loss of their trade. The export of cotton from Khorassan through the Caspian ports during the first six months of 1923 has caused a sharp rise in the price of that commodity for which an increasing demand appears to exist in Russia. Isfahan and Khorassan cotton are also exported to India but are said to be of inferior quality ow r ing to lack of expert knowledge and cultivation of inferior short staple varieties and the prices realised do not appear to justify the heavy cost of transport through Persia to Duzdap or the Persian Gulf. Legislation. —The two next articles on Persia’s export list during the year 1921-1922 were respectively gum tragacanth and gold and silver. Export of the latter was stopped during the year 1922-1923 when the Majlis passed a law prohibiting the ex port of all gold and silver in whatever form except a sum of 10 tomans which each pilgrim to the holy shrines of Iraq was per mitted to carry on his person. Later this law' was amended to include prohibition of transport by sea of all export of silver and gold including specie large sums of which were wont to be shipped from one port in Persia to another on the Persian Gulf under a cabotage seal affixed by the customs authorities, owing to the difficulty of sending the money by land. The principal reason for14 this measure was the fear inspired in the minds of Persian mer chants by the adverse trade balance both in 1921 and 1922 and the consequent depreciation of the value of the kran, particularly in respect of British and Indian currency, since the imports from these countries to-day very largely exceed the exports to the same countries. Owing to the depreciated value of the kran its export was profitable because of its higher silver content and Persian merchants therefore argued that their country would soon be drained dry of silver coin. This conviction was strength ened by the fact that the difficulty of moving specie in Persia occasionally created a temporary shortage of silver in the larger towns and the cry was therefore raised that the country was being denuded of its currency. The result of prohibiting the transport of currency by sea from one port in the Persian Gulf to another, or from Jehran to Abadan via Iraq under cabotage seal, was seen by the Majlis to be deleterious to Persian interests since it impeded the free circulation of currency and rendered it almost impossible to pay the Persian employees of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in remote areas. The law prohibiting such export under cabotage seal has therefore been amended. Owing also to its adverse effect on the trade carried on by Persian and foreign merchants in the Persian Gulf the clause forbidding the export of rupees has also been repealed. The bad state of the market for imported goods and the accumulation of stocks imported as long ago as 1920 during the boom which followed the war, caused certain sections of the Persian merchant community to favour prohibition or restriction of all imports of so-called luxury goods, which at first included a number of imports of ordinary use throughout Persia. This movement, which was analogous to the cry for similar legislation in other parts of the world when the trade depression of 1921 set in has so far not resulted in the passage of any legislation. A concession for the exclusive right to mine the oxide deposits of Hormuz was granted at the beginning of 1923 by the Majlis to a prominent Persian merchant for a period of 15 years. This concession also carries with it the right to extract sulphur and salt from this and adjacent islands in the Persian Gulf. After considerable discussion the Majlis also authorised the Government in June, 1923, to negotiate with American companies for a concession covering the oil rights to four of the five provinces of Persia not covered by the D’Arcy concession. The fifth, the choice of which rests with the Persian Government, is to be reserved for exploitation by native capital. The Majlis has further empowered the American Financial Adviser to negotiate for a loan of £5,000,000. Native Industries. —In an attempt to increase its foreign trade the Persian Government has recently appropriated a sum of money for holding an exhibition of Persian industries and handi crafts in Tehran next autumn. Permission for the exhibition of foreign machinery has also been obtained in order to encourage15 the use of more modern methods by the craftsmen of Persia. At present there are no factories except carpet factories and the refineries of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Abadan, and organized labour is unknown. The Majlis, however, endeavoured to encourage the spinning and weaving industries, which are at present carried out entirely on hand looms, by passing a law making it compulsory for all employees of the Government and for such Government departments as the army, to wear only cloth made in Persia. As a result a considerable fillip has been given to weaving, though at present the majority of the yarn is of foreign make since it cannot be spun in Persia and it is uncertain whether Persia can produce enough cloth to supply her needs. A good opening therefore appears to exist for the establishment of power-driven mills for spinning and weaving wool, but the neces sary capital has not yet been attracted to the country and a thorough local investigation of conditions and supplies by an expert would be necessary before embarking on such an enter prise. The population is both industrious and nimble with brain and fingers and apt at handling machinery under proper super vision and there is no doubt that a good supply of artisans could be trained without much difficulty, but concessions and mono polies are still in existence and should be taken carefully into account. The country is also possessed of a large quantity of wool which is at present either used for making carpets or native- made cloth, or exported through Sistan to India. Owing to inferior cleaning, admixture of dead wool and lack of proper sorting it is said to fetch prices inferior to the Indian wools though the wool grown in the mountain districts is of good quality. The climate is said to be too dry for cotton spinning in the finer counts except in the districts adjoining the Caspian which possess a moist semi-tropical climate. Water power is un doubtedly available in large quantities in this and other parts of Persia. Capital and Labour. —Trade Unions and Employers' Federa tions do not exist since the conditions of employment and labour are in most respects similar to those existing in medieval Europe, with their attendant Merchants’ Guilds and apprentices. Indeed, the economic ideas and principles of the trading communities are not dissimilar to those prevailing in England before the Industrial Revolution, with the addition of a veneer of 20th century know ledge imparted by European education and contact, and no lack of native shrewdness and judgment. Natural Resources. —The natural resources of the country, with the single exception of its mineral oils have not as yet been either properly ascertained or exploited. For instance, coal, which is believed to exist in considerable quantities in the hills north of Tehran and in other parts of Persia is at prsent only mined by digging shallow surface pits during the summer to supply the winter needs of the capital or nearest towns and villages. The remainder of the population’s needs is met by16 f ♦ bringing charcoal over the mountains from Mazanderan Gilan and elsewhere and as the lack of proper roads make it necessary to transport all supplies of both these articles by mule the cost of transport is out of all proportion to the initial cost of production. As a result coal costs on an average £7 a ton, charcoal £11 a ton, and wood in limited quantities from local supplies, £3 10s. a ton in Tehran. Similarly, the cost of transport makes it impossible to export the surplus grain of the province of Pars, of which there is a considerable quantity in years when the harvest is good, to the Persian Gulf Ports, or inland to other provinces where there may be a shortage, and the landowners are credibly reported to be constrained during the present year to burn their surplus crops or to leave them to rot in the fields. Endeavours are, however, being made to organize cheap animal transport to the coast in order to prevent this waste. As in the case of her other trade the problem of the development of Persia’s natural resources hinges upon the establishment of cheap and modern methods of trans portation without which she cannot compete with foreign coun tries in exporting her products. CONCLUSION. .Given a reorganization of her finances, and construction of a proper system of carrossable roads throughout the country, as well as strict supervision of road tolls and taxes, Persia should be able ^ to look forward to an early revival of her trade and to increased material prosperity for her population which has during the past few years suffered considerable hardships. Increased and cheaper methods of communication are, however, essential to such a revival.For advertisements in all Reports by His Majesty’s Trade Commissioners, Commercial Diplomatic and Consular Officers, issued by the Department of Overseas Trade, apply to the Sole Advertisement Contractors :— J.
