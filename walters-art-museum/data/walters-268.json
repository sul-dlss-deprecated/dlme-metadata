Note the king's royal beard, considered to be an attribute of the gods. Kings wore false beards (held in place by a cord) to portray themselves as living gods. The inscribed belt buckle contains the hieroglyphs forming his throne name, User-Maat-Re Setep-en-Re. The king would have had five names in total, this name and three others acquired when he assumed the throne, and Ramesses, his birth name.
