After 24 hours we reached soath of 'ZtLRKO' island where we were attacked by a heavy storm which resulted rush of too much wa^er in the launch, this compelling us to jettison some of the cargo on board in order to sa&gt; r e our lives. v«e made our way to the nearest port, but went aground before reaching Here .we jettisoned the rest of the goods with the exception of very little. After 4 hours we reached the port and repaired the launch. We left this port bound for Jazeerat Seer/ to take some water. We reached this island after 8 hours and stayed there that night. On the following morning we left for Dalma where we stayed for 4 days and carried out some more repairs on the launch. On 28th Hajab, lo65 (28th June, 1946) we left Dalma bound for Qatar. Three hours after our departure from Dalma, the engine caught fire, and we were attacked by a storm again. We went back to Dalma, stayed for another 2 days, repaired the engine, and left for Qatar. On 2nd or 3rd Shaban, 1365 (1st or 2nd July, 1946) we reached Qatar '(i.e.) 30 hours after the departure from Dalma. vite stayed in Qatar, where we lanaed 4^ passengers, for 3 days and proceeded to Bahrain.^tement of naKnujU^b^hlj Oln Yusuf bin Hashn It took us 6 days to get here.

I enclose herewith statement of Ibrahim bin Yusuf bin Hashil, resident of Moharraq and nakhuda of a Bahrain launch, and would be grateful for your advice as to whether I can claim recovery of cost of cargo jettisoned by him. 2. I understand that the local custom as regards recovery of cost of cargo jettisoned by nakhudas is as undert If the launch or the craft was carrying a normal load the nakhuda is not held responsible, but if it was overloaded he has to pay the cost of the goods jettisoned. ^ shall be grateful if you will confirm whether this information is correct and also whether the load as detailed by the nakhuda in his statement, is considered normal for the launch in which it was transported. It strikes me that passengers in addition to the cargo carried, was an excessive number. 4.

The launch in question is at present out of Bahrain, but on its return, of v/hich I shall advise you, I would suggest a local Committee of launch and dhow owners, such as Yousuf bin Ahmed P'akhroo, Haji Khalil bin Ebrahim Kanoo etc ; be formed to decide whether or not the launch was overloaded.

This they said was a normal load. This information has been conveyed to me by my Head Munshi who was present with them. 3. I should be grateful if you would give me your views as to whether you consider the launch to have been overloaded considering the number of passengers, and what action, in view of the above finding of the committee of dhow owners, I can best take now to obtain compen sation for the goods jettisoned.

It is noted that the Committee have assessed the normal and safe load of the laianch of Ibrahim bin Hashil, at 230 bags of rice It is not clear v/hether this load is in addition to passengers or v /ithout. Taking an average weight of the load and passengers carried from D'bai, as per the Nakhudha 1 s statement of 11th July 1946 ; this works out to the equivalent of 250 bags rice, or an overload of 20 bags. Therefore if the normal load is 230 bags without passengers, the launch was overloaded and the Nakhudha responsible. - # # DIRECTOR OF CUSTOMS Ba in i R re.pt and -vo^fr /wy p0rt nfficer 'Bahrain.Sept.19, 1946. IV:.1.''s ./olitical Ac e nt, BAJ-3AI1T. Respected Sir; Host humbly and respectfully I beg to lay the following lines before your honour in the ardent hope that the same would not fail to receive your icind and sympathetic c-ct ions'. I beg to state to your honour that I am a subject of the Bahrain Crovernment. I an a poor man and I am the only main member of the family which is consisted of ten members,to look after them as well as to earn bread for them. I an the owner of a Marine Launch and this is the only source of my income to support my family. In connection with a case filed against me, the launch is under Government custody since the last twenty days. Neither I have any business nor any other source of income and therefore I am experiencing immense difficulties for the maintenance of my family. I, therefore, earnestly pray to your honour to be kind enough to issue order for the release of the launch to me and thus to enable me to keep the same in work to earn bread for my family. I shall be in Bahrain till the case is ended and whenever the launch is wanted by the Government I shall atonce arra.nge to bring the same under Government disposal. Por this act of your icindness I would remain ever grrteful to you and ever pray for your long life and prosperity. I have the honour to be sir Your most obedient servant 'h'.'r ^ahiu bil^ yououv hashxilTelegram En Clair, From Political Agent, Bqhrain.

Will you please refer to your d.o.letter No.2636-1/43 dated the 13th of August 1946 and my telegram on the above mentioned subject? I apologize for not replying in writing before this but I had to wait until I returned to India in order to consult my baggage lists. May I please know if my claim for Rs. 4000/- has been proceeded with and if so, at what stage it has reached? It appears that the heaviest of the eleven boxes were jettisoned, the approximate contents of which are as follows;- - r\ One large box (4'x2t , x2') Containing all crockery,cutlery, cooking utensils and a quantity of table linen. Value Ks. 1000/-. --do-- Containing one D.B.shot gun, one .455 service revolver, 2 fishing rods, three valuable pictures, four blankets, 4 pairs of sheets and miscellaneous clothing, value ite .2000/-. One uniform case - Containing clothing value Rs.600/- One- trunk One box. Containing clothes - Value Rs.250/- Containing whisky and gin - Value Rs. 150/-.3 # I am not covered 'by insurance and would ^ therefore 'be grateful if every effort could be made to secure my claim of Rs* 4000/-. Apart from the actual value of the articles it is very difficult to replace most of them, particularly my gun, fishing rods and pictures. From my experience of the gulf it is most unusual for a local craft plying between Sharjan and Bahrain to jet.tison cargo. At the first sign of a 'Shamal'they invar^iably run.for the shore. It would appear therefore that the, boat was overloaded 'and that my boxes were probably stored on the open deck. # 4. As regards my other luggage which I shipped to Bahrain through Messrs Gray Mackenzie, will you kindly hsnd it over to Gray Mackenzie for shipment to Karachi,. They number boxes 1-25 plus the six boxes received from the local craft i.e. 31 boxes in all. Would you kindly instruct the shipping agents to insure the lot for ks . 10,000/- and address &amp; consign them to the Eastern Express Co.,Ltd., Bunder Road, Karachi, who have been instructed to await delivery. I understand that the t Barpeta l will be calling in Bahrain shortly and would therefore be grateful if they could be shipped on the steamer.

A long time has passed since the money was deposited in the Agency; I could not secure the amount until after I had mortgaged my house. All this time passed but no investigation has yet been carried out in the matter, excepting some enquires from such experts as Haji Yusuf bin Abdur Rahman Fakhroo, Haji Khalil bin Ibrahim Kanoo and Haji Ahmad bin Ali A^-Qasir. As I am a poor man, the delay Ox the money results in loss to me; moreover. Jettisoning did occur and I can prove to you the correctness of my contention, I, therefore, request Your Excellency to loo : into my case with an eye of Justice and equity, as it is your custom with all.
