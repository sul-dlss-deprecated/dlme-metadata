Formerly in service of Zabun ibn Yasir, Albu Muhammad, but remained in the Muqata'ah when Zabun was expelled. Is disliked by ‘Usman. He has a good knowledge of farming and of the capabilities of the Muqata'ah formerly held by Zabun. Is now employed in Political Office, Oal‘at Salih, as Mamur of Special Revenue. ‘ABBAS, SAIYID. Kiliddar of Najaf. Of the Rafa'i family, the richest family in Najaf. He lives in the ‘Amarah quarter. He has done excellent service since the fall of Baghdad, and is certainly pro-British. He was very helpful during the troubles of 1917-18. At times he is a liar, but he is better than his uncle, Saiyid Hadi. ‘ABBAS ibn dharb. Of Shinafiyah, head of the Albu Din in that town. Not well-to-do, but has some influence. ‘ABBAS FADHLI. Of Basrah. Was in the Turkish Muhasibah, and is thoroughly acquainted with all things Turkish. He was Tapu Mudir at Basrah till March, 1917, then Mustashar of the Revenue Board at Baghdad from 1st April, 1917, to October, 1917, and is now Mustashar to the Revenue Board at Basrah.

His father, Jassam, was a sarkal of the Albu Ramlah section of the Jumailah. In 1901 Kadhim Pasha, in return for good work done by ‘Abbas al Jassam as sarkal of the Albu Ramlah when cultivating Kadhim Pasha’s Tapu property at Husai (on right bank of Euphrates, near Fallujah), appointed him as Shaikh of the Jumailah in place of the then Shaikh, one Mashkur al Khalaf, who was a bad character. Shaikh ‘Abbas filled his new post capably, and is still by far the most reliable of the Fallujah District Shaikhs. A middle-aged, hale and hearty man, with a direct and honest manner, he exercises a strong hold over his tribe, who obey his orders when Government tasks have to be carried out, without the necessity for any Government pressure. He is fairly well-to-do, and his circumstances should still further be improved by the opening of the Saklawiyah canal, upon which his tribe has a large holding. He has throughout assisted the British to the best of his ability. ‘ABBAS AL JUM’AH. A minor Shaikh, and a Government contractor, he lives close to the Jewish quarters in Samarra. Greedy of money, and was possibly concerned in contraband deals during the war. ‘ABBAS AL SAIYID LUTUF, SAIYID. Of Shinafiyah district.

He was appointed Rais Baladiyah on the arrival of the English, and has done much useful work in that office. He is very keen and liked and respected by the people of Qurnah.

He is on very bad terms with most of the neighbouring tribes. In June, 1918, his enmity with the Albu Hassan culminated in a pitched battle, in which each side lost 40 men. This has not lessened the mutual hatred, and only the influence of the P.O. prevents another outbreak. ‘ABDUL AHAD, YUSUF. A prominent Syrian Christian of Basrah. He has sat in the Majlis Idarah of Basrah in lurkish times, and is probably the best representative of the interests of Basrah Christians. A man of little means ; speaks English. A good fellow.

Son of Shaikh Ibrahim of the Khazraj, Sumaichah, who was murdered by one of the outlawed Ivhazraj. Inexperienced and lacks character at present. It was hoped to set him up as head Shaikh of the Khazraj in place of the outlaw, Oais, and he was given Rs. 1000/- to help him, but it looks as if he will be a failure. At present he is employed as a Bulugh Bashi of the Shabanah. ‘ABDUL ‘AZIZ IBN ‘ABBAS. Shaikh of the Sa'dah tribe, Mandali district. He was made shaikh in succession to his father by Musa Effendi, who was hand in glove with the Turks before the occupation of Mandali.

Head of the Rahahlah, originally a section of the Jalihah, from whom they split some years ago. ‘Ali al Na'mah, Shaikh of the Jalihah, wishes them to be put under him, while Abdul ‘Aziz, who is in alliance with the Fatlah, is unwilling to accept ‘Ali’s leadership. Hindiyah, right bank on Shatt Mulla*. (1705) ~ B 24 ‘ABDUL BAQI EFFENDI. Was Rais Baladivah at Shahraban for 10 years. He resigned the post ^ October, 1917, owing to ill-health.

Much respected saiyid of Qazani, Mandali district. He is married to a daughter of the Wali of Luristan. In person he is weak and insignificant, and he takes no part in Government affairs. ‘ABDUL HADI AL TALAQANI. Learned Shi'ah of Badrah; has been useful in settling Shar'ah cases.

Shares with Salim al Husain, q.v., authority over the Jubur and receives a percentage of the crops from the fallahs. He was in bad odour with Government in November, 1918, for harbouring ‘Abdul Razzaq, who was subsequently deported. He is probably pro-Turk, but has sufficient sense to hide his feelings, and acquiesces in any demands made on his tribe, which he well controls. ‘ABDUL HAMID AL SULAIMAN AL YUSUF. Rammadi district. Shaikh of the Albu Kulaib. His father, who died about 7 years ago, was one of the most influential Shaikhs in the district. ‘Abdul Hamid, who is 45 years old, although generally respected, has very little influence and only a small following. ‘ABDUL HAQQ. Qadhi of Hillah. A quiet and slack old man. Not much initiative or power, and possibly a bit weak for his position as Oadhi. He lives in the Mosque Sharqi, and does the Mu'adhdhin’s work as well as his own. He has an eye to the main chance. ‘ABDUL HASAN, SAIYID. Was for some years Wazir to the late Shaikh Hamud of Madinah, Ournah division. ‘Abdul Hamid, however, on his accession took a dislike to him and chose another Wazir. He was appointed Mudir of Bani Hutait, Bani Musharraf and Tbadah in June, 1917, but did not hold the office long. Clever, capable and reliable, he has rendered much assistance to A.P.O., Qurnah, from time to time. ‘ABDUL HASAN IBN YUSUF. Shaikh of the tribe of Al Hamad in the Tursaq, Mandali district. A young man, capable and well-educated; the leading personality in the Tursaq. He came in to the British some time before Mandali was occupied, and has always assisted the Government. ‘ABDUL HUSAIN, MIRZA. Wazir to the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh. He is a Lur, over 80, a pleasant, untidily dressed scoundrel, who drinks one or two bottles of cognac nightly and smokes opium. He has considerable influence over the Wali. Very independent ; he tells the Wall he does four hours’ work for him daily and considers the rest of his time his own. His son, aged 33, does most of his work ; capable, frank, decidedly pro-British and almost certain to be the next Wazir. All the Government papers are kept by the Wazir. Mirza ‘Abdul Husain supported Amanullah Khan (eldest son of the Wali ; d. December, 1918), and when he asked us to help the latter, put forward as an inducement that he would let us run through the papers.' He is pro-British, and on this account is losing ground. The office of Wazir has been in his family for several centuries, and, as he is afraid of being deposed, he would h*elp us if we guaranteed the continuance of the post in the family.5 ‘ABDUL HUSAIN, SAIYID. Of Hassunah. One of the Saiyids who own the whole of Hassunah. The A1 Musaddaq section of the A1 Ibrahim have been encroaching on their territories during the last few years and several of the Saiyids have been killed. Saiyid ‘Abdul Husain kept up friendly relations with the A.P.O. and the 1.0. of Nasiriyah, and wanted to supply recruits for the Arab Scouts. But he was summoned to Shatrah by Mizhir and the ‘Ulama, the A1 Ibrahim taking him thither, and told to have no further intercourse with us. His life was spared on the intercession of the ‘Ulama. In May, 1916, he withdrew his brother and a relative who had enlisted in the Nasiriyah Scouts. ‘ABDUL HUSAIN, SAIYID. Of Shatrah. Anglophile. Was in Kut during the siege. He made his escape two or three days after the surrender, reached ‘Amarah via the Hai. Lived subsequently at Chabaish, to which place he brought his family from the Gharraf. An intelligent person and useful as a news agent, but a busy-body. ‘ABDUL HUSAIN IBN SAIYID ‘ALI, SAIYID. Of Najaf, Huwaish quarter. Of the family of Saiyid Salman. His conduct during the blockade was suspicious. ‘ABDUL HUSAIN IBN SAIYID ‘ALI IBN SAIYID JAWWAD, SAIYID. A family of Mosul origin, whence they emigrated to Karbala some 160 years ago. The grandfather, Saiyid Jawwad, got himself appointed Kiliddar by the usual methods after the death of Mirza Hasan Kammunah. His son, Saiyid ‘Ali, succeeded him, and was followed by Saiyid ‘Abdul Husain. Saiyid ‘Abdul Husain fled from Karbala to Baghdad during the troubles of 1916, and on his disappearance the office of Kiliddar was seized by Fakhri Kammunah. It was, however, restored by us to Saiyid ‘Abdul Husain in the autumn of 1918. ‘ABDUL HUSAIN AL BARUDI. Of Karbala. Merchant of good reputation. ‘ABDUL HUSAIN TABATABAl, SAIYID. Son of Saiyid Hasan and grandson of Abul Qasim. He is about 35 years old, and has been studying Muhammadan law for some ten years. He has considerable local influence, and, like the others of his kind, is bigoted and retrogressive. Was born at, and studied in Karbala, and married a connection of his own. His influence is chiefly due to his family connection and to the great reputation enjoyed by his grandfather, Saiyid Abul Qasim, who was a well-known ‘Alim of Karbala in his time. Saiyid ‘Abdul Husain is a ^nephew of Saiyid Muhammad Baqir Tabatabai. He signed the Persian Madhbatah complaining of the Turkish treatment of the holy towns in June, 1916, and, in consequence of the events of 1916, was reported, immediately before the fall of Baghdad, to be steadfastly on our side. ‘ABDUL KARIM AGHA.

A small family, but were third in importance in the revolt which took place some 90 years ago. They have property in the town and are related by marriage to some of the Saiyid families. ‘Abdul Karim has two brothers, ‘Abdul Jalil and ‘Abdul Rahman. Like all the town Shaikhs, they were jealous rivals of the Kammunah Zadah. ‘ABDUL KARIM AL HAJI DARWlSH. Mukhtar of Dokhalah, Daltawah area. A jolly, casual ruffian, but possesses plenty of authority.6 ‘ABDUL KARIM JAZAlRI, SHAIKH. Of Najaf. An Arab ‘alim.

Rais Baladiyah of ‘Anah. ‘Abdul Latif is a man of about 60 years of age, and of a very fine presence. He comes from the family which has always been the most influential in ‘Anah. Personally, he is a nice old man, very polite, hospitable in the extreme, and about as conceited as he is stupid, but very honest withal. He is wealthy from his properties and his business as a merchant, but chiefly from the gold he has inherited. His influence in ‘Anah is considerable, but the Turks always disregarded this, importing other raises, and suspecting ‘Abdul Latif whenever ‘Anah objected to them! At the beginning of the war, a Yuzbashi was murdered one night for assaulting a woman, and ‘Abdul Latif openly expressed his approval. For this he was imprisoned 18 months in Baghdad. Again, after we withdrew from ‘Anah in the spring raid of 1918, he was imprisoned by the Turks for his British sympathies and only released on their finally withdrawing from ‘Anah in the autumn of 1918. His sympathies are all with us and his following includes the whole of ‘Anah. ‘ABDUL LATIF AL ‘ANBAR. Of Hudaid, Daltawah district.

Up to date these reports have been found untrue. ‘ABDUL LATlF IBN FATAH. Rais Baladiyah of Rawah. This is a new appointment, as in Turkish times Rawah was part of Anah, and this has given ‘Abdul Latif rather an exaggerated idea of himself. He is, however, a useful man and an honest one. He owns a small amount of property r^pcf 011 / 1110 ! 5 a trad e grain. His chief business is money-lending at extortionate rates of interest, from which nefarious profession he has amassed considerable wealth He is not too popular, because he hoards his money, and is very stingy to his guests. ‘ABDUL MAHDI, HAJI.

On the outbreak of war he went over to the Turks. He came to Najaf early in 1915, and on his return via Karbala saw Saiyid Ahmad Lucknawi, q.v., whom he had known through his work on the Oudh Bequest, and induced him to accompany him to Baghdad, ostensibly to obtain assistance from the American Consulate. On his return, ‘Abdul Rabb received a large bribe from the Wali, and was commissioned to preach the Jihad either in Afghanistan or Bokhara. He got as far as Kirmanshah, where the British Consul was told to arrest him, if possible, but could not succeed in doing so. ‘ABDUL RASUL AL SHA'BAN. Of Najaf, ‘Amarah quarter.

Abdul Whhab is a very pleasing middle-aged man, and is acknowledged as the leading citizen of Hadithah. He owns a lot of property there and has a considerable business as a merchant. His reputation for honesty and acuteness is admitted everywhere, although he is a man who always drives a hard bargain. He has wonderfully advanced ideas on municipal matters, and this should make the organisation of the municipality of Hadithah a simple matter. During the war he was fined many times for supposed British sympathies, whereas he actually sat quietly m Hadithah, and neither by word or deed assisted either us or the Turks. ‘ABDUL WAHAB IBN 'ABDUL LATIF. Of ‘Amarah. Arrested by order of G.H.Q., January, 1918. ‘ABDUL WAHAB IBN SAIYID ‘ABDUL RAZZAQ SAIYID. ^ bal ?V ag l d i 50 ’ 1 Abdul w ahab’s grandfather, also by name 'Abdul Wahab, Wa l Kl of K arba ! a and agent of the Mutawalli of Karbala and Musaiyib.

Was a friend of Saiyid Talib, who used to write to him from India. Hates the Turks. Of bad moral character. He is a contractor by profession. The ‘Abdul Wahid family are descended from the Bani Arab house, of' the Bani Khalid, and have been in the ‘Iraq some 300 years. ‘ABDUL WAHID, AHMAD CHALABI. Shaikh of Abul Khasib, the best of the family, generous and held in affectionate esteem, but he has not much character. He was a friend of Saiyid Talib and hated the Turks, but is now inclined to regard their failings leniently on account of their being Mohammadans. In the absence of any more suitable candidate he was made Mudir of Abul Khasib, but did not prove satisfactory in the discharge of those duties. ‘ABDUL WAHID, HAJI MAHMUD PASHA. The oldest of the family, which is the most numerous in Basrah. Brother of Ahmad Chalabi. A man of 85, an enormously wealthy owner of date gardens. He was outwardly on good terms with Saiyid Talib, mainly because he feared him, and is a convinced pan- Arab, but he is also a good Mohammadan and on religious grounds regrets the Turks. Virtuous but parsimonious; would sell his soul for official attention and recognition. He was Mudir of the Sanniyah estates under the Turks. On any question except the price of dates, and the relations between landlord and tenant, -his opinion is not worth having. Terrible miser. ‘ABDUL WAHID, SALIH BEG IBN HAJI MAHMUD. Was Rais al Baladiyah of Basrah, bad reputation, tyrannous, he wrung money out of the people. A friend of Saiyid Talib, but out of fear ; his real leanings were towards the C.U.P., and his sympathies are with the Turks on religious grounds. No politician. He was asked to keep the municipality moving after the occupation, and showed a vast incapacity. It was he who went down to Muhammarah and as Rais al Baladiyah offered to hand over Basrah to us. ‘ABDUL WAHID AL HAJI SIKAR. Shamiyah division. Son of the original paramount chief of the Fatlah, Haji Sikar, who was famous as one of the most powerful and probably the richest shaikh on the Euphrates. Cultivates a large area on the left bank of the Mishkhab from Abu Sukhair to the Ibrahim. Very able and more far-seeing than the average. Emphatically the most powerful of the Fatlah and next to Saiyid ‘Alwan, probably the greatest influence in Miskhab. A man of strong personality, but at first sight appears weak and uninteresting. Should be always carefully watched, but when he gets used to the new regime should be of considerable use to Government. ‘ABDULLAH ‘AZIZ IBN ABU SALAM. Of ‘Amarah. Arrested by order of G.H.Q., January, 1918. ‘ABDULLAH BEG BAJLAN. Younger brother of Mustafa Pasha Bajlan. An old man who owns some land in Khaniqin. Of no importance, though respected. ‘ABDULLAH EFFENDI IBN DARWlSH EFFENDI. Mudir mal of the Mandali district. An old man, Turkish in origin. He has a wide knowledge of all revenue matters, and his assistance in the Political Office at Mandali is invaluable. ‘ABDULLAH AL DULAIMI. Lieut. Colonel in the .Sharif’s army ; of Dulaim origin ; aged 32 ; speaks Arabic, Turkish, French. Very correct in tone ; lively, irregular ; eccentric. Too dashing for solemn operations. Popular, intelligent, and very nationalist ; probably accessible to money or women. M.C. 1917. ‘ABDULLAH EZRA OUBBAl. Mutawalli of the tomb of Ezra. The shrine in Turkish times received a grant-in-aid which exactly balanced with the fixed revenue assessment on the Sanniyah lands on the left bank so that the one cancelled the other. On the river bank the land was ordinary Miri and paid l-10th on Shitwi crops and l-6th on Saifi. The date palms round the shrine are Mulk, i.e., private property held by right of Tapu Sanads. The collection of Government dues bv a yearly assessment and the deduction from that sum of the annual (1705) ~ c10 . , , • ^„ X70ri ip.nt nrnress and was converted in December, grant-in-aid was found to be an I '“' ve '. et lining of which the rebate was taken into 1916, into a fixed cash assessment, in the d “ nl J ve °‘ '™ s been carried out . It was account. This is to hold good until a regu y maHp held bv the shrine recommended that the whole of the lands in question should be made held by shrine on the usual Tapu Sands. Qal‘at Salih district. ‘ABDULLAH AL HABIB. Shaikh of the Hudhail tribe, Shaikh of the Hudnau tnoe, 60 Bait, Shammar Toqah, 'Aziziyah district Un satisfactory, unpopular, and on bad terms with his tribe, who consequently do not obey tiim ‘ABDULLAH HULAISI. Well known ‘Aqaili of Damascus. ‘ABDULLAH MAMAGHANI, SHAIKH. Of Najaf. Son of Shaikh Hasan Mamaghani, one of the greatest ‘alims of his time. Concerned only in religion ; has many followers in Azarbaijan. ‘ABDULLAH AL MUHAMMAD AL SHAHIR. The present Shaikh of the Halabsah section of the Dulaim, cultivating on the Saklawiyah canal, Fallujah district. A young man, about 25 years of age , active and energetic, and has a strong hold over his section, which he utilises to our advantage. ‘ABDULLAH AL MUHAMMAD AL YASlN. Kut division. Paramount chief of Maiyah section of B. Rabi'ah. Son of Muhammad Yasin, who was outlawed in 1917. A man of about 32 years of age, of energy and capacity somewhat above the average. He is also ambitious, and in the disturbed times before and during the war managed his affairs with considerable success. He was Government Agent at Hai from April, 1917, to April, 1918, and seems to have managed the district fairly well, as there are few complaints of injustice. During these years he occupied a position of some importance, and at present appears somewhat unhappy and discontented at the inevitable waning of his importance. Being suspicious and of a limited outlook, and also because his influence as a paramount shaikh and as a landholder is somewhat uncertain, his position is difficult, and he cannot settle down to the new conditions (which themselves are not as yet fixed), so that his conduct is not always all that could be desired. When, however, his position becomes better defined, and if his energies are directed in the right path, he has sufficient ability to be a good landholder and tribal shaikh. But if led astray he might give trouble. ‘ABDULLAH AL MUTALAQQIM. Of the ‘Ajman, Hadi ibn Sifran section. Came up with Dhaidan al Hithlain, q.v., from Hasa in the autumn of 1915. Followed his fortunes for a time, but when, or possibly even before, Ibn Rashid left for Hail, he joined the Aslam (Shammar), who were in opposition to Ibn Rashid, and finally went down to Safwan, where the main body of the ‘Ajman had established itself under Sultan Ibn Hithlain, q.v. ‘ABDULLAH NAJM SHUMURTI. Of Najaf, Mushraq quarter. The most prominent member of the Shumurts left. A thorough bad hat. ‘ABDULLAH RASHID. Of the ‘Azzah, Dali ‘Abbas district. Appears to be a nice fellow, and is said to be a good cultivator. ‘ABDULLAH AG HA IBN SHABlB. Of Hillah. Brother of Hasan Agha, q.v. ‘ABDULLAH SHU'AIBI. Of Basrah. Brother of Muhammad. Merchant. Very strongly pro-Turk. Straight business man. Was a friend of Muhammal al ‘Asaimi, q.v. Has property in Suq district. Has been a nuisance to A.P.O. Suq in consequence, having tried vainly to recover Mallakiyah. His agent in Suq is Ibrahim al ‘Amari (senior). ‘ABDULLAH BEG IBN SULTAN BEG. With Muhammad al Hasan, Ikhtiyar of the ‘Amirliyah section of the Baiyat, Dali ‘Abbas district. They cafne over from Kirfi direction owing to a disagreement with the11 Turkish authorities over a robbery, and have settled on the Waisi canal under Jalil Effendi, with the permission of the Civil Commissioner. Very bad cultivators. They have quite the worst crops on the Khalis. ‘ABDULLAH AL WUSHAH. Shaikh of the Shuwalish (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Mujarrah), who are on the Euphrates river bank above Suq and are kept loyal by their vulnerable situation. ‘Abdullah has his people pretty well in hand, but he is a weakling. The Shuwalish are always in trouble with the Ahl Kut and other tribes of the Shamiyah. ‘ABID AL MUWANNIS. Of Samawah district. Shaikh of the A1 ‘Abas tribe (B. Huchaim) ; aged 40. His tribe is small but gave considerable trouble by robbing wayfarers between Samawah and Nasiriyah. In consequence they were shelled by a gunboat, and ‘Abid al Muwannis has fled the district. ‘ABID AL RISALAH. Appointed Shaik of Albu Nail, Diwaniyah district, in 1918. Has little control and needs constant official support. A weak character, but the best of the Albu Nail Sarkals. ‘ABID AL SARRAE. Of Karbala ; aged 50. A Persian, well known for his piety as a Shi'ah. His house is resorted to by Persian merchants. ‘ABID ZAID, SAIYID. vShaikh of the Cha'ab. Cultivates on the bazaiz of the Shatt al Khums above Shina- fiyah. Took to himself the title of Saiyid about three years ago, to which, it is said, he has no claim whatever. A sly, slippery, slimy and thoroughly revolting personality. Is not on good terms with Shaikh Hunain of the Zaiyad or with the Muqotar family. . ABU RISHAH AL GHADHBAN. Uncle of Kamandar. Appointed in October, 1916, to the Bait Jindil lands, to replace Hasan al Majid, who had proved wholly unsatisfactory. ABUL HAIL AL ‘ISA. See Muhalhil al ‘Isa. ‘ADDAl al jaryAn. Of Hillah district. Paramount shaikh of the Albu Sultan (Zubaid). He visited the C.P.O. at Kut, before Ctesiphon, and expressed the desire to submit to us. Subse quently he sent to the C.P.O. an original letter sent him by Naqib of Baghdad inciting him to join the Turks. After Ctesiphon and our retirement towards Kut, he sent a letter to the C.P.O. begging for two gunboats to be sent to Bughailah. After the Turks had entered Hillah in November, 1916, and punished the headmen of the town, ‘Addai and his tribe were induced to join them, and helped the Turks to repel the attack of the Mushahidah two months later. After the occupation of Baghdad he made submission. Was recognised as head shaikh of the Albu Sultan by Government, and made a member of the Hillah Tribal Majlis. He is a very strong and very shrewd man, the leading shaikh of the district, and is the only one of the Hillah Shaikhs who is educated to the extent of reading and writing. He has behaved extremely well, and has his tribesmen under strict control. His tribes gave the Turks a lot of trouble, and about ten years ago had a pitched battle, in which ‘Addai took part, with the rest of the Zubaid and most of the other tribes of the district. The Albu Sultan won. Hence, there is no love lost between ‘Addai and ‘Ajil al Samarmad. The Albu Sultan are a section of the Zubaid but are now independent. ‘Addai has some connection with the townsfolk, and spends a certain amount of time in Hillah. ‘ADHAM BEG BAJLAN. Nephew of Mustafa Pasha, took part in driving Baratoff from Khanaqin. Son of ‘Uthman Beg, stupid, not influential, always pro-Turkish. Was at the Military School at Constantinople. ‘ADHAR, hAji mulla. He came out against us by order of the Wali of Basrah, was dangerously wounded at the battle of Kut al Zain, picked up by us and well treated, on the advice of the Shaikh Muhammarah, who made representations in his favour. He considers that he owes his life to us, is now one of the four high officials of the Basrah occupied territory and staunchly (1705) c212 pro-British. His son is employed in the office of the Military Governor of Ashar, a suburb of Basrah. Haji ‘Adhar is a Shaikh of the ‘Amarah, originally part of the constituent of the B. Rabi'ah of that name. The late Shaikh of Madinah, Humud, was Haji ‘Adhar’s cousin. He stayed in Damascus on his return from the Hajj and is on terms of warm friendship with Muhammad al Bassam. A man of 45, fine looking, pleasant open manner. Some what given to intrigue. He has been in Government service since the occupation and is now Mudir of Harthah. AFDAL KHAN, NAWWAB. Shi'ah of Karbala, a leading Indian. Entrusted by Captain Young on April 8th, 1917, with funds to relieve distress among Indian subjects. Landowner. ‘AFTAN IBN SHARQI. Shaikh of Albu Mahal (Dulaim), 'Anah district. ‘Aftan is a young man of 23 years of age, of a pleasing appearance and polite in his manner. He is literate and, though he has never been out of his tribal area, he shows a remarkable grasp of the geography of the country. He has a very firm hold indeed of his tribe and, so far as one can judge, rules it with a certain regard to justice. He succeeded to the shaikhship six years ago on the death of his father, and has successfully beaten all the intrigues of his uncles to displace him on the grounds of his youth. He owns a certain amount of land near Qaim and, as a Beduin shaikh goes, is fairly wealthy. He keeps a very poor state, however, and is rather keen on money, which he prefers to lavish on his personal adornment than on his mudhif. He pro fessed lurkish sympathies, but was responsible for many robberies and raids on supply dumps and convoys. The Turks never retaliated until their return after our raid on Anah in the spring of 1918, when they imprisoned him. His tribesmen appeared in force, however, and at the moment troops and gendarmes were so few that he was freed. ‘Aftan never actually did anything against us. When Captain Carver arrived at ‘Anah in the autumn of 1918, ‘Aftan came in and professed his willingness to do anything the Govern ment desired. This he has done and done well, except that he will not supply mounted tribesmen as Shabanahs. Aftan is on good terms with all the surrounding shaikhs, with the one exception of Ali al Sulaiman, with whom he preserves a coldly polite attitude. He has the reputation of being a man of his word, and the only thing one ever hears said against him is that he is inordinately fond of money. ‘aghAl al battikh. ‘Aziziyah district. See Fahad al Battikh. AHMAD BEG. Rais Baladiyah of Samarra. Has been of the greatest assistance to us since our occupation. He is always most willing and obliging, in addition to which he is a man of wealth and prestige m Samarra circles. He has steered a difficult course with some skill. Difficult to say whether he is pro lurk or pro-British, probably neither. By faith a Sunni and in looks a Turk. He carefully avoids, as a rule, undertaking any business with Government, which is political C work° nCerned Wlth Government &gt; but latter ly has been induced to do a little AHMAD EFFENDI, SAIYID.

Was Rais Baladiyah of Ba'qubah at the time of the fall of Ba'qubah in March, 1917. Asked to be relieved of the appointment, and as he was quite useless to us the request was granted. Said to have been very friendly with Ahmad Faiq, Beg, the late Qaimmaqam. AHMAD BEHBEHANI, SAIYID. Of Najaf. A well known royalist Mujtahid of Tehran, dismissed by the Constitu tionalists. Very openly pro-British but probably mad. AHMAD SHAIKH DAUD Of Bait Shaikh Daud, a cultured family of Windiyah, Daltawah district, employed in the Waqf Department. AHMAD GURDAH. Sarkal of Jadidat al 'Amyah, Daltawah district. Good cultivator, but fearful liar. He belongs to the Albu Haiyaza' tribe (‘Ubaid). AHMAD HAMDI EFFENDI. Qadhi of Kirkuk and President of the Peace Court ; shortly to become Judge of the Shar'ah Court. Held various posts as Qadhi in Kurdistan previously. Very energetic, apparently honest, transacts much business, generally respected. Not in touch with the European world, but in complete revolt against the many faults, of Turkish rule. An elaborate conversationalist. Age about 57. Probably a Kurd. AHMAD IBN jABIR AL SABBAH. Of Kuwait. His uncle, Shaikh Salim, has made him second in command ; sits in his father’s place in the market, and does a good deal of official business. AHMAD IBN MULLA KHUDHAIR. Of Mushairiyah, Daltawah district. Well spoken of. AHMAD LUCKNAWI, SAIYID. One of the Mujtahid distributors of the Oudh Bequest at Karbala. A man of some ability, said to have earned a reputation at Karbala for generosity. He was induced to proceed to Baghdad with ‘Abdur Rabb, q.v., after war broke out, not suspecting any intrigue, but could not be persuaded by the Wall to preach the Jihad in Persia, and returned to Karbala. AHMAD AL MUSTAFA. Of ‘Amarah. Arrested by order of G.H.Q., January, 1918. AHMAD IBN RASHID. One of the rival headmen of Dair, Qurnah division. He joined the Turks in the beginning of the war, as did all the other inhabitants of the banks of the Shatt al ‘Arab, having no other alternative. He is head of the Oannas section of the ‘Amarah, these last being an offshoot of the tribe of the same name, a constituent of the B. Rabi'ah. Ahmad ibn Rashid was set up as Shaikh by the Turks on the deposition of Hachim al Sa'ad, the head of another rival clan in Dair. The two individuals were bitter rivals, and their enmity to one another was a constant source of trouble. Finally, a Mudir was appointed to Dair, and the two shaikhs were exiled to Basrah until they had made up their quarrel, when they were allowed to return to their lands at Dair. AHMAD AGHA IBN SAIYID RUSTAM, SAIYID. Uncle of the present Naqib of Mandali, and a large landowner. AHMAD AL SALIH. Of Jadidat al Shatt, Daltawah district.

Sent his men to ‘Ajaimi al Sa'dun before the Amir left Chabdah in 1916. The Dhafir attacked them and captured camels and rifles west ot Khidtir. ‘AJIL IBN ‘ATI AL SAMARMAD. Was the Head of the Juhaish (Zubaid), his own section being the Albu Khidr, who are on the Tigris in the ‘Aziziyah district. On the occupation of Baghdad, ‘A]il had his headquarters in Mahawil Shu'bah, and was recognised as Shaikh of all the Juhaish, including Faisal al Mughir’s sections. ‘Ajil refused to come in and make formal submission to Government, and after being given several chances of doing so, was eventually declared an outlaw. He wandered round the Jazirah for several months, but beyond keeping the tribes in an unsettled condition and instigating some petty raids and robberies on the Hillah-Bahgdad road, did nothing much. In February, 1918, when the cordon was gradually getting tighter round him he fled north to the Turks, taking with him Muhammad al Rashid, q.v., his cousin and step son (‘Ajil having married Muhammad’s mother after Rashid’s death). ‘Ajil returned after the occupation of Mosul in October, 1918. He is probably pro-Turk at heart and is not a man to be trusted. ‘AJIL AL GHADHBAN. Bani Lam. Was selected to go to Basrah in the place of Fahad, father of Kamandar, when the latter was allowed to return to his Muqata'ah in June, 1916, but ‘Ajil ran away. He was allowed to come back on payment of a fine. ‘AJIL AL MUHSIN. Shares since he came of age authority over the Juwaibir (Muntafiq, B. Malik, B. Khaiqan) with Hatim al Mozan, q.v. The two work well together. ‘Ajil is a boy of great promise. Hatim is paramount shaikh. ‘AJIL AL YAWAR IBN ‘ABDUL ‘AZIZ IBN FARHAN. Shammar Jarba‘. A man of about 30, with the family presence and good looks. He is probably one of the most influential among the Jarba' shaikhs. Joined his father, ‘Abdul ‘Aziz, q.v., in the ‘Iraq in October, 1917, but was jealous of the pretensions of his uncle, Faisal, q.v., when the latter came to Baghdad from Mecca in November, 1917. ‘Ajil and ‘Abdul ‘Aziz entered into relations with ‘Ajil al Samarmad, the hostile shaikh of the Zubaid, left ‘Iraq in February, 1918, and rejoined the Turks, to whom, however, they gave little effective help. ‘Ajil was in Mosul at the time of the occupation, and would have been made responsible for certain sections of the Shammar tribe, but he fled from the town without permission. His camp was rounded up in January, 1919, though he himself escaped. ‘AJJAH AL DALI, HAjI. He is the shaikh of the Albu Jaiyash (B. Huchaim), the biggest tribe of the Samawah district; succeeded his father, who had the tribe under control. There are now 18 sections; his control over the majority of them is practically nil. ‘ALI EFFENDI. Water Mamur of Kadhimain, Daltawah district. Landowner of Mahmudiyah.‘ALI EFFENDI. Landowner of Abu Tamr, Daltawah district. ‘ALI, HAJI. Of Kirkuk, brother of Haji Jamil Effendi, q.v., and like him a wealthy trader and cultivator. Now in Constantinople. ‘ALI, SAIYID. Of Suq. Albu Khalifah (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Bani Khaiqan). A prominent Saiyid and personally a charming and influential man, pleasant and cheerful. A well- known astrologer, student of horoscopes, he predicted the downfall of the Turks in 1917. His mystic talk makes a considerable impression. Pro-British, a protege of Haji Hasan Hamdani. He has influence with Badr Rumaiyidh and the tribes north of the Hammar. Poor and humble. Has done excellent work for us at Shatrah and on the Bad'ah Canal. ‘ALI, SAIYID. Mukhtar of Hibhib Daltawah district, in the time of the Turks. Resigned the post because of pressure of agricultural responsibilities. Reads and writes. ‘ALI AL ‘ABBUD. Of Albu Farraj. Sarkal of Umm al Shaifah Island, Balad district. A good culti vator and with pleasant manners. ‘ALI ‘ABDUL HUSAIN, HAjI. Of Badrah. Capable mallak, said to be in possession of Tapu Sanad, which he obtained from Qaimmaqam during the war for a consideration. ‘ALI AL SAIYID ‘ABDULLAH, SAIYID. Rais al Baladiyah of ‘Afaj, Diwaniyah district. Very energetic and progressive. Has travelled a good deal. ‘ALI IBN ‘ABDULLAH LUTAIYIF. Shaikh of ‘Azzah, resides at Marfur, near Shahraban. Like Habib, q.v., has very little control over his section. After our occupation he became Mudir of Dali ‘Abbas for a period of six weeks. He was not a success in this capacity owing to his unfair treat ment of the Jubur. Is in the bad books of the General Staff, as he is supposed to offer asylum to Turkish spies, but it is uncertain how far this impression is due to the machina tions of Yasin al ‘Abdullah of Sulaimaniyah, who is his enemy and an adherent of Habib al Khaziran. ‘ALI AL ‘ABID, SAIYID. Shaikh of Albu Darraj, Samarra. Always at great pains to pose as a man of influence among the tribes, but in reality exerts very little authority. Has occasionally been useful to Government and is probably pro-British. Is the possessor of an evil countenance. ‘ALI AL ‘AIYASH. Shaikh of the Jaghaifah, ‘Anah district. He is a man of about 50 years of age, of a rather unprepossessing appearance, but of a singularly pleasing manner. He is a very intelligent old man and constantly proclaims that he rules his tribe by diplomacy and not by force. He has land at Hadithah, and is rather keener on its cultivation than on roaming the desert. It is chiefly due to his influence that his tribe is little given to raiding. He wants to live a peaceful life and has tried hard to steer clear of all the Dulaim politics. For many years he has kept clear of all the minor Dulaim squabbles and acknowledges no man as his head. He invariably raises objections to all the orders he receives, but in the long run he carries them out. ‘ALI AL ‘ARS, HAJI. Lives in ‘Amarah, but keeps an agent at Qal'at Salih to run his farm. Haji Ali is a very unreliable person, full of protestations. His lands and property were confiscated by the Turks, but have recently been given back to him by us. In Turkish times he was security for ‘Usman al Yasir, and it was on this account that his lands were confiscated. ‘ALI AL HAJI ‘ASSAD. See Tallal al Tofan.16 ‘ALI AL BATTIKH. Head of Bait Battikh, Mujablah section, 100 Bait, Shammar Toqah, ‘Aziziyah district. After the occupation of Baghdad, ‘Ali settled down early to cultivation on the river bank, while his brothers Fahad, ‘Aghal and Kamil were engaged in highway robbery. ‘Ali is an excellent shaikh and quite reliable ; he has got his tribe well in hand. Did good work in settling up all the claims for highway robbery against his brothers. ‘ALI AL DABBUS, SHAIKH. Was formerly the leading personality in Suq al Shuyukh, but has been supplanted by Haji Hasan Hamdani, q.v. He bears him little malice, being fully occupied with his own business as a merchant. He is the richest merchant and garden owner in the Suq district. He is very pro-English and progressive. He has applied for a branch of the Bank of Persia for Suq and for the establishment of a Land Bank. Highly respected ; not an intriguer. Shi'ah. His advice is always of value. ‘ALI AL FADHL, Paramount shaikh of the Khafajah tribe (Muntafiq, Ajwad), old and decrepit. A great friend of the Khaiyun al ‘Ubaid, shaikh of the ‘Abudah. Cunning and exceedingly cruel. Fought against us at Batnijah. A great admirer of ‘Abdullah ibn Falih Pasha. Has in the past taken part in all the Muntafiq wars against the Turks, and only came in to us definitely when Baghdad was taken. His tribe was very much out of hand till quite recently, and made the Shatrah road a by-word for dangerous travelling. 'Ali al Fadhl has now turned over a new leaf, and in December, 1917, was granted an allowance of Rs. 200 p.m., thus bringing him into line with all the Kasiriyah shaikhs. He runs his job well. ‘ALI PATH, HAjI. Oldest member of ‘Arafat family of Badrah. Ignorant and obstinate. Pro-Turk. ‘ALI IBN FURAIYIH. Of Mandali district. Virtual shaikh of the Nida, as his father is becoming too old to carry on. ‘ALI AL HAMAD. .Shaikh of Tuwaimah, Balad district. Keeps very little control over a thieving lot of rascals. b ‘ALI AL HAMAD. Shaikh of the Habbab, Balad district. His tribe is well-behaved. ‘ALI IBN HAZZA’. ‘Aqaili, lives with the ‘Anizah. He belongs to the house of ‘Abdullah al Nujaidi of ‘ALI HIKMAT EFFENDI. Alim al Ulama of Kirkuk.

Shi ah Alim, of Dagharah, Diwaniyah district. Much respected. Progressive and open-minded. Connected with Najaf ‘Ulama. ‘ALI AL HILLI, SHAIKH. Of Najaf. Originally from Hillah. Radhi, though not so well known. An Arab ‘alim similar to Shaikh Ja'far al Shah ‘ALI AL HUSAIN. Head of the Karrafah. no very special consequence. A small tribe on the Shatt Mulla, Hindiyah River bank, of 'ALI AL HUSAIN AL KURAIYIM. Shaikh of Albu Isa. Is a man of great renown in circles. He invariably accompanied the Special Service his knowledge and assistance have been of considerable Samarra, especially in military Officer in his expeditions, and military value. The Turks set17 a price on his head. The G.O.C. 1st Corps presented him in December, 1918, with a gold watch in recognition of his services. He is well known among officers for his debonair and cavalier-like bearing. Politically, he is of little influence. In money matters he cannot be trusted, and is suspected of selling contraband goods. ‘ATI IBN SAIYID JARAU, SAIYID. Of Najaf, Buraq quarter. A man of no importance now, and entirely untrustworthy. He was a close ally of Haji Sa‘ad. Sent his son Husain to Nasiriyah with letters dated 2nd February, 1917, expressing adherence to us and asking for help. Saiyid Husain had been in to Basrah before with letters to C.P.O. ‘Ali and his relations were implicated in all the disturbances of 1917-18. ‘ALI JAUDAT. Major in the Sharif’s army of Mosul. Aged 34 ; speaks Arabic and Turkish ; a hard fighter, good officer, popular, energetic, efficient. Very quiet in manner. No politician. D.S.O., 1918. ‘ALI AL JAWAD.

Mukhtar of Jaizani al Tha'alib, Daltawah district. Honest, but weak. A nice man, but slow to understand and tactless. An earnest cultivator and a judge of a horse. ‘ALI MANP, SHAIKH. Of Najaf. An Arab ‘alim of no importance. ‘ALI AL MASLAWI, HAjI. A resident of Nasiriyah town, employed in the municipality as house tax collector. Had a very bad reputation under the Turks, whom he served in various capacities. He was particularly notorious for his dealings as date revenue collector, and for his crooked methods when employed as assistant to the Mudir of Hammar 10 years ago. He there earned an unenviable reputation by taking an unauthorised tax on the Khafajah women returning from Basrah, calling the tax a “ harlots’ tax,” and so causing the deepest resent ment among the Khafajah and Gharraf tribes. Smart, cunning, and pleasant of speech. Reads and writes well, a Sunni Mohammedan, said to be in sympathy with the Turks, but gives away nothing. ‘ALI V AL MISH'AL. Shaikh of ‘Atbah tribe, 55 Bait, Shammar Tdqah, ‘Aziziyah district, on Tapu land of Mr. Tatheossian. Unimportant tribe, well-behaved, and few complaints. ‘ALI AL MUHAMMAD. Of Albu Farraj, is the recognised head of the biggest tribe of the Samarra Qadha. He is the son of a noted character, but is himself a somewhat colourless though well-meaning individual. He is very poor and cannot, like his father, exact dues from his fallahs. “For this reason his influence with the tribe is not great. Probably would be advisable to grant him a salary and so consolidate his influence, which would be pro-British. The Albu Farraj are a section of the ‘Azzah, and keep up close relations with the latter. ‘ALI AL SAIYID MUHAMMAD SATD HABUBI, SAIYID. Of Najaf, Huwaish quarter. A family of merchants of whom Saiyid ‘Ali is the most important. His father, Saiyid Muhammad, was a most fanatical preacher of the Jihad and died at Nasiriyah.

(1705) D18 •ALI AL SHAIKH MUHAMMAD RIDHA, KASHIF AL GHATA, . Of Naiaf Head of the family of Shaikh Ja'far al Kabir, the greatest Mujtahid of his time The latter is perhaps best known for having refused to declare the Dafa agamst Russia about one hundred years ago, on the ground that the Russians were only fighting for territory, and not religion. Shaikh ‘Ali is a learned and good-hearted old man and has the largest library in Najaf. He has great influence among the tribes, owing to his own personal worth and owing to his family. He is very anti-Turkish and was often humiliated by the Ottoman Government. He is openly pro-British. His two sons, Shaikh Ahmad and Shaikh Muhammad Husain are 'Alims, and have very great influence with Saiyid Kadhim Yazdi, who invariably consults them in every matter. ■ALI .AL MUZAI'IL. Gli 3 .Zcil 3 .t, Shamiyah division. Cultivates land on the Hor Cmm Tocj. Lives at Turumah. He and Ouhaiyit ibn Wali are the most prominent men of the tribe. Of quarrelsome temperament, and totally unreasonable. Has several enemies, one of whom, it is devoutly to be hoped, will shortly dispose of him. Needs a very heavy hand. 'ALI AL NA'MAH. Head of the Jalihah. The tribe is in alliance with the Bani Hasan. ‘Ali is not a satisfactory person, and his relations with his sarkals require to be watched. He recently attempted to dispossess most of the sarkals in his tribe in order to gather more power into his own hands. Hindiyah, R. bank, on Shatt Mulla. 'ALI KHAN IBN NASIR KHAN, MIRZA.

A tyrant who has probably taken as many men’s lives as anyone in Hillah. He is inclined to be quarrelsome. He has protected the bazaars well on the whole, and should be retained as long as the Paswaniyah system remains. ‘ALI AL RIBDI. Well known ‘Aqaili of Damascus. Originally from Buraidah. *ALI AGHA IBN HAjI GHULAM RIDHA. Of Karbala. Aged 40. Inherited considerable property from his father, most of which he has squandered. Addicted to pleasure rather than business. ‘ALI RIZA KHAN, SHAB-I-DAULAH Son of Husain Ouli Khan, brother of Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh, was left six taifas, but being a minor these districts were captured by the Wali. He is a man of about 36, stout, lazy and rathei deaf, but he is the most capable member of the family, well informed and cakes an inteiest in European politics. He lives at Dehbalah on money supplied by the Wali. He has been in correspondence with the Russians and is willing to sign any treaty with the British if they will support him. His following is small and he has no money. He is not popular with the Wall’s Government, possibly because they know that if he became Wall he would be able to keep a firm hand on his ministers. He has two boys, the eldest about six. ‘ALI IBN SALIH, MULLA. ‘Amarah division. Secretary of Majid al Khalifah. A shrewd and capable man. Dealings with him have been satisfactory.

Shaikh of Dulaim, his own section is the Rudaini. Aged about 50 ; is by far the wealthiest man in the Ramadi district and if ambitious, could exert considerable political influence. Bakr ibn ‘Ubaid was succeeded by Muhammad al Bakr who was killed about 30 years ago. He was succeeded by Sulaiman al Bakr who enjoyed a very considerable reputation and died about 15 years ago, when ‘Ali, his son, became Shaikh. Before the fall of Ramadi, ‘Ali al Sulaiman was Shaikh of the Albu ‘Assaf and a few minor sub-sections, but since our occupation his authority has been greatly increased, and the Albu Fahad now acknowledge him as Shaikh. He remained with the Turks until our occupation of Ramadi, but gave them little active support. As he owns valuable properties in the vicinity of Ramadi his fondness for money will always guarantee his support to settled Government, and he will exert himself ener getically in the maintenance of law and order when he fears that his pocket may be affected.. He is able to read and write but prefers to use a clerk. ‘ALI THUWAINI. A follower of Muhammad al Sa'id’s section of the Karkhiyah. ‘ALI IBN SHAIKH ZAIN AL ‘ABIDIN, SHAIKH AL TRAQAIN. Of Karbala.

Has considerable land between al Fatlah and al Ibrahim on the left bank of the Mishkhab. Is a good cultivator. Related to Saiyid Nur, q.v. He was for a short time a representative for the Wilayat council under the Ottoman Government. He conceals beneath his charm, guile and craftiness. For the Arab, he has a good brain, and has a very considerable influence. Saiyid Nur voices his thoughts. Not to be trusted, his activities should be. carefully watched. ‘ALWAN AL‘ABDULLAH, HAjI. Wealthy merchant of Diwaniyah Town. Owns several irrigation pumps. ‘ALWAN AL chihAll Shaikh of Al Zaiyad, Diwaniyah district. Tactful and controls his tribe well. Formerly on bad terms with his Sarkals, due to the intrigues of Sa ‘dun al Rasan. ‘ALWAN al dhirb. Shaikh of Albu Dujaili, Balad district. Is a man of some influence and character. Liked by his tribe, whom he keeps in good order. ‘ALWAN IBN FULAIYIH. B. Lam, Bait Jindil. He visited the C.P.O., in company with Col. Leachman at Shaikh Sa'ad in 1915, and explained that he was between the devil and the deep sea, but was anxious to stay with us if we would guarantee him immunity and retention in his lands on the bank of Tigris above Shaikh Sa'ad. He was given a reassuring reply and asked to go and sit quietly in his Muaqata'ah and keep his strip of river secure. He went back to do so. A few days later Sabri Bey with some Turkish cavalry cut in to our com munications at and near Shaikh Sa'ad and ‘Alwan joined him. He and his tribesmen were responsible for the looting of a large convoy of mahailahs with Government stores. He himself then fled across the river and joined Chitab and others who were implicated in the same outrage. His Muqata’ah was accordingly handed over to Hasan al Majid. Alwan’s family have been settled on this land for 200 years. He made sunender in the winter of 1917-18 through Saiyid Muhammad Kadhim Yazdi, and was allowed to return to ‘Amarah, but his lands have not been restored to him. 'Alwan was respected by the Turks and by the Arabs, he is regarded as the most respectable of the Bani Lam shaikhs. This is the ‘Ali Gharbi estimate of him. (1705) D 220 ‘ALWAN AL NIJNI. A ^ ^ ^ Shinafivah district. Head of the Ibrahim section of the ‘Ayyash (Chabshah) about 400 rifles. In receipt of an allowance of Rs. 150 p.m. from Government. ‘ALWAN AL HAJI SA'DUN. Shamiyah district Of the Bait ‘Abbas, the Bani Hasan Shaikhly house. He controls the section of the Bani Hasan south of Kifl, the northern section follows his elder brother ‘Umran a v who is a more honest man than Alwan though not so able. In the days of no-Government before we occupied the Euphrates towns in August, 1917, he controlled affairs at Kufah, more or less, but was unable to deal effectively with the more unruly section of his tribe. With strong Government support he has done better, his intentions have always been good, but he is not a strong man, and while he will give an honest and unbiassed opinion on tribal affairs if he knows that he will not be quoted, he will shut up like an oyster if he thinks that his view will be passed on to his own people. It is very prob able that in view of his position vis-a-vis to Laftah Shamkhi, who has no use for him at all, and is more powerful, it is the best he can do. He is a keen and intelligent agriculturalist. He has been quoted by the Germap political service as incorruptible. Is very much a gentleman to deal with. He lives near Kifl. His hold over his tribe is maintained by tact and management, not by strength of character, and he is a procrastinator by nature. It is said that ‘Umran has to rely upon ‘Alwan for diplomacy and for the inevitable tribal intrigues. AMIN BEG. Chief of the Baigat family, formerly the leading family in Badrah, but owing to un fortunate land speculations, now comparatively poor. Was wakil of the Political Officer Kut, before an A.P.O. was posted to Badrah. Weak. AMIN IBN HUSAIN. Of Hillah. He is a good type of gentleman farmer, and owns a lovely garden about two miles downstream on the left bank. A genial and fatherly soul, and as full of goodness as any. His fallahs like him and he is generally much liked. He was a member of the Majlis, and could always settle small disputes amicably. AMIN EFFENDI IBN MULLA JAWWAD. Commissaire of Police at Mandali. An Arab in origin. Hard working and efficient, though not to be trusted too far. AMIN IBN SAID. Mukhtar of Huwaish, Daltawah district. Not known very much. ‘Amir, ‘abdul razzAq al. Of Basrah.

A brother of ‘Abdul Razzaq. ‘AMIR IBN PARIS. t\/t P artners in the Bahathah Muqata'ah with the brothers Mahud, Saihud and Wadi Ibn ‘Ajil who are his cousins. He is said to have killed a fifth partner and cousin, Zaidan, in 1914, and to have fled, returning only when the British took Amarah. Amir s story is that the three brothers killed Zaidan. In Tuly 1915, Amir was given back his original share by us, but was evicted by the three brothers. These three agreed to become responsible for the rent to us, ‘Amir failing to produce securities. Ultimately Mahud and Wadi were evicted by us and joined the Turks. The estate is now m the hands of Saihud. ‘Amir ibn suwaif. , Put in b y into the Bahathah Muqata'ah with his brothers Oata' and hT Ah ■.mL'i'i T e ™: ted Mahtld Ibn Ajil, q.v., and his brothers. ‘Amir, Qata' and Haji Salih are all three stupid, savage and unreliable. ‘AMMAR AL ‘ALL 50 ye“r e s ad ° f SeCti ° n ° f A ‘ bU ' Ali ’ SWr * district ‘ A badl y wo ™ ^^men of about21 ‘amrAn al hAji SA'DUN. cu of TT Alw ^ n al Ha ji Sa'dun, q.v. Stands head and shoulders above the Shaikhs of Hmdiyah. Head of the Bani Hasan who have lands both in Karburiyah, west of Tuwamj and in Kill Shu'bah on both banks of the river. ‘Amran possesses great influence, and has been most useful in every way. He is not popular with his sarkals, who are afraid of him. ‘AMRAN al zanbur. Of the Bani Ajil section of the Juhaish. Farmer of Government of lands in Mahawil Shu'bah. . r Amran is a very cheery and amusing individual, and has played the game well. In view of Faisal s incompetence to control all the Juhaish, ‘Amran has been dealt with direct in matters concerning his tribesmen, instead of through Faisal, but he is not a member of the Hillah Tribal Majlis. The Bani Ajil are also hopelessly mixed up with other Juhaish sections, not only in this district, but on the Tigris as well. Before the occupation Amran was in Turkish pay and at feud with his brother Hasan who was pro-British and was imprisoned in Baghdad on that account. He was also at feud with ‘Ajil ibn ‘Ali Samarmad, q.v. ANTOINE. See Petrus. •aqAb ibn ‘Ajil. Shaikh of the Fadhl section of the ‘Abdah (Shammar), maternal uncle of the Amir ‘Abdul Aziz ibn Rashid. Not on good terms with the Amir Sa'iid. He joined ‘Ajaimi ibn Sa'dun with some 30 men, and was engaged with him in the raid on the Dhafir in the early part of 1916. Ibn Rashid was reported in May, 1916, to be incensed at his continuing with ‘Ajaimi, and to have sent him an ultimatum. He subsequently joined Ibn Rashid, but returned to ‘Ajaimi ; but took little part in any further operations, frequenting his usual camping grounds. ‘AQAILI AL RADDAM. Shibil, Shamiyah division. Cultivates land near Qurnah on the edge of the desert west of the Kufah Channel. His father, ‘Ulaiwi al Rukhaiyis, is still alive, but is stone blind and too old to manage affairs. ‘Aqaili is rather a crude specimen, but is more or less honest, and well disposed to the British Government. ‘AQQAL al fadhlullah. Dulaim al Ghubaishat, Zubaid, 60 Bait. Good manners and superior in intellect to many of the Zubaid Shaikhs ; has his tribe well under control. ‘Aziziyah district. 'ARAIBAH BINT WADI. Albu Muhammad. Sister of ‘Araibi Pasha. Was married to Hatim ibn Saihud, and is the mother of his son Tahir. Hatim divorced her and quarrelled with ‘Araibi in conse quence. Tahir also takes her side. Like her cousin, Fitnah bint Saihud, she is a lady of considerable character and influence. She lives chiefly with Muhammad ‘Araibi, and takes an active part in the affairs of the family. She has been to Baghdad on several occasions with ‘Araibi. She mixes freely and unveiled in male society. ‘arrAr. Bani Lam. Nephew of Abu Rishah and cousin of Kamandar ibn Fahad. He has been given the Bait Fahad portion of Hasan al Majid’s Muqata'ah by Abu Rishah. He was formerly on bad terms with Fahad and was living in Juwi’s Muqata’ah opposite Fulaifilah. He then fell out with Juwi and returned to Fahad and thence to Abu Rishah. His difference with Juwi arose over the right to receive payment for the brushwood cut for the S. and T. near ‘Arrar’s camp. ‘ARRAR IBN HAJI JA'FAR. A non-tribal farmer under ‘Usman al Yasir. Was h merchant in ‘Amarah in the time of the Turks, but through their actions became practically bankrupt. Settled down as farmer and is doing well. He is the most zealous farmer in the Qabat Salih district, open- minded and ready to improve his methods when shown how to do so. Has behaved extremely well in supplying more than his share of labour, and rendered great assistance to the Irrigation Officer. Is rapidly improving his own farm and extending the cultivation.22 ASAD, SAIYID. unassuming and courtly old gentleman.

ASAD IBN ‘ALL Of Nahr al Shaikh, Ba'qubah division, dates. Gave some difficulty in the matter of getting ‘ASAIMI, ‘ABDUL RAHMAN. i , r . Brother of Muhammad, q.v. An Arab Diogenes, desires to be left m peace under any conditions. Lives in a “ house of hair ' with people like Humud ibn Suwait if by this means he can get out of the road of tumults. Comes into towns like Zubair and Khamisiyah for a short period every year. Great crony of Hamad ibn Khamis and now domiciled in Khamisiyah (October, 1916). Was all for our persevering m trying to get Ibn Rashid on our side because, with our backing, the Amir would have been able to recover the allegiance of his tribesmen and regain his old name in the Jazirah. In a quiet way did much to guide the minds of the Shaikhs of Zubair and Khamisiyah to us at the beginning. Mocked the Mujahidin who went to Shu aibah as choosing the wrong side. He 3 ^aps a good deal. Cannot read or write. ‘ASAIMI, MUHAMMAD AL BARRAK. One of the worst rogues in Basrah, ‘ Ajaimi’s agent, an enemy of Saiyid Talib. Cunning and treacherous ; he is said to have been the only man Saiyid Falib feared. He was formerly engaged in intrigue with ‘Ajaimi against the lurks, and probably they had an arrangement with the Germans for the landing of arms at Babyan for Ajaimi. He joined the Turks at Nasiriyah in January, 1915. In the middle of 1915 he went to Najaf with Saiyid Hadi to conciliate the people after the troubles there and was for a time acting Qaimmaqam of Hillah. With Muhammad Pasha Daghistani he was engaged in distribut ing Turkish bribes among the tribes. In May, 1916, he visited Ibn Rashid, near Zubair, to use his influence with him, but the mission was reported to have been unsuccessful. He began his career as a very poor man, entered the service of Makki Abu ‘Abadah, a sheep merchant of Basrah, but left him and went to Muhammad al Shu'aibi—both he and al Shu'aibi came originally from ‘Anaizah in the Qasim. He bought sheep for al Shu'aibi in Zubair, made a little mone}^ and set up as a sheepskin dealer under Qasim al Khudhairi, by whom he was also employed to bring in corn from the Muntafiq district. When he had saved a little capital he set up for himself. One of his brothers, Yusuf, he placed at ‘Amarah, the other ‘Abdul Rahman in Muntafiq—both like rogues with himself. In his dealings with the Muntafiq country he made the acquaintance of Sa'dun Pasha. He was at the root of the quarrel between Sa'dun and Mizyad Pasha, egging on Sa'dun to seize Mizyad’s estates. He made bad blood between ‘Ajaimi and ‘Abdullah Falih. ‘Ajaimi looted and captured Mizyad when the latter was camping in the desert, but Mizyad escaped and brought in a complaint to Basrah. It was ‘Asaimi who brought ‘Ajaimi into the C.U.P. In 1918 ‘Ajaimi sent him to Hijaz and Egypt, to plead his cause. ‘asfAr al saiyid sAfi, saiyid. Wealthy cultivator in Shafa'iyah, Diwaniyah district. ‘ASIF effendi mallAk. Of Mansuriyat al Shatt, Daltawah district. Baghdadi of Turkish descent. Sometimes suspected of unfortunate tendencies. A charming man, however. ‘ASIM IBN SALIH AL SA'ADI. Daltawah district. Son of the Mallak Salih of Hibhib, q.v. Reads and writes. ‘ATA EFFENDI. Of Hillah. A kind of professional Wakil. He is quiet, and from reports not obtensibly dishonest. ATI AL HARBIYAH, SHAIKH. Rais of huhaili (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Bani Khaiqan). Pro-British, was largely influenced by Captain Cowley, of Lynch Brothers, who often stayed with him. Was backward in coming in when we advanced on ‘Akaikah, but has given no trouble since we established ourselves in the Euphrates. Lame in the left leg from a bullet wound; pleasant manners.23 ‘ATIYAH, HAjI. Member of the Hillah Majlis. ‘ATIYAH, SHAIKH. Ran Qal'at Sikar before the appointment of an A.P.O. A strong man. He kept the town clean and peaceful and levied taxes as he chose ; therefore unpopular. He has a quarrel about land with the Mushlib, a section of the Toqiyah (Muntafiq, Ajwad, Humaid). His son was appointed Mudir of Suwaij Shijar, on probation, but turned out to be useless. ‘ATlYAH IBN ‘ABDULLAH. Shaikh of Jubur, on right bank of Diyalah, Shahraban district; resides at Shirwan. He has a strong personality and a firm control over his tribe. Intriguer. ‘ATIYAH ABU QULAL. Head of the Zuqurt, one of the two Arab factions of Najaf, the other being the Shumurt. Headman of the ‘Amarah quarter of Najaf. His ancestors were not Shaikhs, and until 1894 he earned his living by smuggling salt into the town. In the pursuit of this occupa tion he came into collision with the Turkish excise men, killing and wounding some of the party. This episode earned for him the wrath of the Government and considerable repute among the townsmen. He was outlawed, a sentence which did little but enhance his reputation. He built himself a strong fort known as Dar'iyah on the outskirts of the town, and owned a cultivated plot round a spring in the sandy bottom of the Bahr Najaf, some 20 miles further west. At Dar'iyah he resisted all attempts to bring him to order. These proceedings gave him considerable influence over the local population and the surrounding tribes ; guests flocked to enjoy his hospitality, and the two factions of Najaf acknowledged his authority. His position became so menacing that the Ottoman Government sent troops and guns against him, destroyed his houses and drove him to seek refuge in Kir- manshah. When Nazim Pasha was appointed Wali of Baghdad in 1910, ‘Atiyah returned secretly from Persia and cast himself on the clemency of that straightforward old soldier, and obtained through him a pardon from the Government. When Nazim fell and the country returned to the lawlessness from which he had partially delivered it, local highwaymen marked the recovery of their independence by robbing the Government post of a large sum of money on the Najaf-Karbala road. Jamal Beg, Nazim’s successor, turned to ‘Atiyah for help, and the latter recovered the money (from a coffee shop in Najaf) with such celerity that the Wali concluded that he must have been, at the very least, an accomplice in the robbery, and committed him to gaol. He was removed to Baghdad and submitted to various tortures, such as flogging and branding with hot irons, but at the beginning of the war he was released, and returned to Najaf. Such being his antecedents, it was not likely that he would prove a pillar of strength to the Ottoman Government. He was the last man to obey the orders of the Turks to take an oath to oppose us, and he lost no time in writing to the C.P.O. offering to come to terms with us. With the other Shaikhs of Najaf, ‘Atiyah administered the town of Najaf after the Turks were turned out in May, 1915, and he resumed control in the summer of 1916 when the Ottoman Government was ousted for the second time. He entered into correspondence with us and received financial support. His principal colleagues at Najaf were Haji Sa'ad, Saiyid Mahdi ibn Saiyid Salman and Kadhim Subbi. He came into Baghdad immediately after the Occu pation and, with the other town Shaikhs, was charged with the preservation of order in the town. In October, 1917, he instigated disorders after the town had failed to pay up an indemnity due to the ‘Anizah who had been looted when they came to Najaf to buy provisions. On the intervention of Muhammad Kadhim Yazdi he was pardoned but maintained a truculent attitude. In January, 1918, his men fired on our cavalry, killing a man. ‘Atiyah fled into the desert and was outlawed. He was not in Najaf at the time of the murder of Captain Marshall. In April, after the successful issue of the siege of Najaf, he was raided by the ‘Anizah and gave himself up at Samawah. He was deported from the ‘Iraq with the condition that he should never be allowed to return, and all his property was forfeited to Government. ‘AUDAH, SAIYID. Lives near Suq. One of the most important men in the place. Famous for his sanctity and as a settler of disputes. All sacred oaths in Suq are taken before him and often on his person.—' Wa hayyat Saiyid ‘Audah.’’ If the taker of the oath is forsworn he will die within the year.

After the retreat from Ctesiphon he showed himself consistently hostile, and attempts made through friendly Shaikhs to bring him over to our side met with no success. He expressed his firm conviction that the Turks would ultimately be victorious. His headquarters are immediately to the N of the Hammar Lake, on the southern end of the Bad'ah. All the Al Bu Salih are bad fighters and Badr’s own section, the Rumaiyidh are the worst of the lot. In June, 1918, gunboats and troops were sent out against Badr. He refused to submit tower was shelled. He was then outlawed and his son, Hasan, was detained in Nasiriyah, but subsequently escaped Sulaiman at Nasrullah was appointed Rais of the B. Malik in Badr s place. Badr has since done nothing overt against Government, but he refuses to recognise British rule, harbours Turkish spies, and gives a home to all criminals and malcontents.

He led the opposition to Ibn Sa'ud in 1915 and after the defeat of the Ajman fled northwards with Khumaiyidh ibn Munaikhir, q.v., and others, and in November asked Salim ibn Mubarak to grant them peace. Salim referred them to his father and Dhaidan came to Kuwait and made submission. At Ibn Sa’ud’s request the ‘ Ajman were expelled from Kuwait territory in February, 1916. About 1,200 of the 2,000 fighting men went to ‘ Ajaimi, and, with the exception of Khumaiyidh, subsequently joined Ibn Rashid. F)haidan wrote to the “ Commander of the Turkish Army ” saying that they were at his disposal. In May Sultan ibn Hithlain, q.v., obtained permission from the Shaikh of Zubair to settle at Safwan and took most of the ‘Ajman with him, but Dhaidan with some 100 followers remained with Ibn Rashid, acted as his go-between with Kuwait and co-operated with him in his abortive attack on the Aslam and the Dhafir in July. When Ibn Rashid went south he rejoined ‘ Ajaimi. In August, 1916, he raided Kuwait territory and carried off booty from Ibn Sabbah’s tribes. The ‘Ajman at Safwan joined in this raid, but it is believed that they were out against the Mutair, not against Ibn Sabbah, and the latter’s camels were subsequently returned. Dhaidan left most of his followers at Safwan and returned to ‘Ajaimi with a few personal followers. THE AL HITHLAIN. From Dhari ibn Tawalah. Rakan Hazam. Falih Muhammad Khalid. I L Sultan | Hazam. Naif Dhaidan. dhAri al dhAhir. Shaikh of the Z6ba‘, Fallujah district. Born about 1873. Became Shaikh on the death of his father, Shaikh Dhahir ibn Shaikh Mahmud in 1901. In appearance is short and unusually dark, with left eye blind. Was hostile to the British after the occupation of Baghdad and Fallujah, but came in eventually towards the end of the summer of 1917. During his hostility his brother Dhira‘ acted for a short time as Shaikh df the Z6ba‘, but was found entirely unreliable. Dhari was consequently restored to his position as Shaikh when he came in. Report has it that his influence over his tribe is powerful, but up to the present this has not been notably apparent. Though his various sections readily recognise him as their chief Shaikh and hold well together under him, he is not regarded by them as being particularly straight in his dealings. Apart from this he is intelligent, courteous, a keen agriculturist, and keeps open house on a generous scale. Is of liberal and anti- Turk tendencies, and is interested in agricultural machinery. Has a son, Khamis, who promises well. His usual home is on the south bank of the upper reaches of the Saklawiyah canal at ‘Abbadi. dhAri ibn tawAlah. Paramount Shaikh of the Aslam section of the Shammar, a tribe famous among Arabs as “ ahl al Tama' ” i.e., famous for their rapacity, but also reputed good fighters. Before they broke with Ibn Rashid they were reckoned to be his strongest men round Hail. Dhari has a name for great personal courage. A fine-looking man, he suffers from a broken arm, the bone of which has never set, so that it can be bent in the middle of the forearm. The hand has not withered, and he can pull a trigger with the fingers. Said to have received this wound either in a fight against Ibn Sa'ud two years ago, or in a fight in the Iraq with30 Fad'us, one of Ibn Suwait’s braves. Dhari is feaied by most of his tribesmen, by some of them feared onlv second to Ibn Rashid himself. He is veiy ambitious, and at present an implacable enemy of the ‘Abdah, Ibn Rashid s section. Being a small man compared with Ibn Sa'ud, he is making friends with the latter. He is said to distribute the money and arms given him by us chiefly to men he can trust, i.e., to his particular following Some of his Shaikhs, notably Sultan, 'Aghaiyan al Waj'an and Shukhaiyir al ‘Anush complain of his partiality in this respect. He came in to us in April, 1916, and offered his services against Ibn Rashid, who was then hanging round the edges of the ‘Iraq. I n alliance with Hamud ibn Suwait of the Dhafir he attacked Ibn Rashid south of Khamisiyah in July, and it was largely owing to the fact that the Aslam and the Dhafir closed the roads to the markets of the ‘Iraq that Ibn Rashid was obliged to return to Hail. Dhari was made responsible for the security of a part of the railway between Zubair and Khamisiyah and controlled the access of caravans to the latter town. He is a man of independent spirit, and probably as trustworthy as any of the fickle Beduin, but he has not any sure authority^ over his tribe. DlSHAR IBN FAISAL. ‘Amarah division. Brother of Shaikh Mutashshar, Albu Darraj. Was for a short time in charge of Oassat al Sharqi. Replaced by Shah ‘Ali in December, 1917, for instigating an unwarranted attack against Shia‘ ibn Fa'al, his partner in Oassat al Sharqi. DHIYAB, MULLA. ‘Amarah division. Shaikh Jiiwi’s agent.

Whether because of the Wall’s opposition or because the terms of the sheep contracts were unfavourable, Ezra has not been able recently to fulfil them. EZRA MIR. Jewish merchant and member of Majlis al Baladiyah, Oak at Salih. The only Jew in the town whose word can be considered at all reliable. Has done very useful work on the Majlis, and is generally respected in the town. EZRA WADDAN. A wealthy Jew landholder of Hillah. FA'AL IBN ‘ASACHIR. B. Lam. See Kamandar al Fahad. FAD'An al matrud.

All dealings with Government are in the hands of his son Warwar. Fadhlullah is an authority on Zubaid tribal customs, and spends his time settling inter-tribal and domestic disputes. Ukhwat Salmah are a very small tribe, but their Shaikh is much respected in the ‘Aziziyah district. FAD'US AL ASLIB. Shaikh of the ‘Araif (Dhafir, Samid). One of Humud ibn Suwait’s best men. FAHAD AL BATTIKH. And his brothers ‘Aghal and Kamil. Brothers of Shaikh ‘ Ali of the Mujablah, Shammar Tdqah, ‘Aziziyah district. None of the three have a savoury reputation, but Fahad is the worst. Gave much trouble to the Turkish Government as a regular highway robber, and continued in the same practices after the occupation. The three brothers were arrested by us on account of the many robberies committed by them, and all claims settled. They have since been released, and are at present keeping quiet. FAHAD BEG IBN HADHDHAL. ‘Anizah, paramount Shaikh of the ‘Amarat. Now a very old man, but still has a great reputation in the desert, though his son, Mi'tab, manages the affairs of the tribe. Came into Baghdad in June, 1917, and entered into an agreement with us. He receives a subsidy of £100 per mensem. He is hereditary Oaimmaqam of Razazah, where he has a tapu estate which was granted to his father. FAHAD AL HILLAL. Dulaim, Rammadi district. Until the fall of Hit he was only Ikhtiyar of the Albu Hillal section of the Albu Nimr. He was recognised by us as Shaikh of the Albu Nimr, but has shown that he has very little influence with them. He is illiterate, but a good fighter. FAHAD IBN KHALIFAH. See Mushattat ibn Khalifah. fAlih ibn bunaiyah. Half brother of Ghadhban al Bunaiyah. Behaved well after our occupation of ‘Amarah and handed over two guns abandoned by the Turks. Lives on the Musharrah Canal, one hour from ‘Amarah. He was proposed by Mutashshar as one of the combine of himself and the Bani Lam Shaikhs (Shabib, Hasan and Fahad) against the pro-Ottoman combine of Zubaid, Sarraj, To'qah, and Bait Jindil in May, 1916. His forces not stated. He visited the British Consul in disguise as a faqir in 1912, after the Turks had taken Ghadhban and Juwi prisoners to Baghdad, and offered the allegiance of the B. Lam to the British. Age about 30. Soft, plausible manner, not of much influence with the tribe.32 FAISAL, MULL A. f Tri ... ^ A Wakil of the Multazim of the Waqf lands of Khuwaihs, Daltawah district. cultivator and quite trustworthy. A keen FAISAL IBN FARHAN. . „ . ^ , T Of the Shammar Jarba‘. Visited the Sharif m 1917, and returned to the Iraq in November, 1917, with letters from the Sharif recommending him to the British administra tion. At that time his brother, ‘Abdul ‘Aziz, with the latter s son Ajil al \awar, were also in the ‘Iraq, with a number of Shammar tribesmen. Faisal was asked to arrange with them Shammar co-operation in a raid towards the Jabal Sinjar. His brother and nephew feared, probably with reason, that he intended to pose as head of the Shammar Jarba‘; they sheered off, entered into relations with Ajil al Samarmad, the anti-British Shaikh of the Zubaid, and finally left the ‘Iraq and rejoined the Turks. Most of the tribe, with which Faisal seems to have little influence, went with them, leaving haisal with little but his personal following. He spent the summer of 1918 near Sumaichah, where he has some uncultivated land, and came back to his former camp near Suwairah in the winter. A stupid man ; of fine presence like all the sons of Farhan, with a preposterously exaggerated view of his own importance. FAISAL AL MIZ'AL. Shaikh of Albu Husain of the Budair, Diwaniyah district. Returned in the autumn of 1918, with his tribe, to his lands, on the return of the water to Al Budair. Had been on the Gharraf for 15 years. FAISAL AL MUGHIR. Is now recognised as the head Shaikh of the Juhaish in the Hillah and Musaiyib districts and is a member of the Tribal Majlis. He has not proved himself competent to control his tribesmen, and he and his tribe have caused more difficulty than any other section of the Zubaid. His task has naturally not been any the easier on account of the complica tions caused by ‘Ajil al Samarmad’s claims ; and further, the Juhaish are so mixed up with the Mu'amrah tribesmen in Mahawil Shu'bah that it has been quite impossible to settle on any dividing line between the spheres of the Mu'amrah and the Juhaish. haisal was also handicapped by having to be at the beck and call of two Political Officers, viz., Hillah and Musaiyib. It is hoped that this latter disadvantage will be overcome by an arrangement whereby Faisal has appointed his son Nasir to be his wakil and deal with A.P.O., Musaiyib, in all matters concerning the Musaiyib district, Faisal confining the whole of his attention to the Hillah district. He is responsible to Government for Nasir. FAISAL AL MUTLAQ. Shaikh of the Zubaid, Juhaish, lives on the Bad'at Hamad. Strong character and considerable influence amongst the various sections of the Zubaid, ‘Aziziyah district. FAISAL AL SHADDUD.

Fond of luxury, uxorious, has about 25 wives. Cave valuable aid in supplying labour for building railway and Nasiriyah protective bunds. Not popular in tribe.

The Fandi family claim descent from the Ghazzi and through them from the old Fadhul tribe, now split up between the Shammar Jarba‘, Dhafir and ‘Anizah. Farhud is a clean-bred man of about 30, well mannered and of very pleasing address. The best of the Hachcham Shaikhs after Qasid al Nahi. A personal friend of ‘Ajaimi, as are all the Hachcham Shaikhs. All the Hachcham are cultivators. They live on lands mostly the property of the Rbdhan and Rashid branches of the Sa'dun. There is no paramount Shaikh of the Shamiyah sections, but the chief man is perhaps Qasid al Nahi. FARHUD AL MUGHASHGHASH. Paramount Shaikh of the B. Khaiqan, a tribal group within the B. Malik section of the Muntafiq, numbering some 15,000 fighting men, in the Hdr al Hammar and on the Euphrates immediately above it.

On our advance up the Euphrates he and his lands were at our mercy as soon as we reached ‘ Akaikah, and he was shrewd enough to see that his interests lay with us. He threw in his lot with us entirely and was of great service to us during the Qarmat Safhah operations and advance on Nasiriyah. In consequence of his services he received compensation for damage to his lands by the removal of the ‘Akaikah dam. He is now Mudir of the Bani Khaiqan. A man of strong character and much personal authority. Fine appearance. He has done remarkably well as Mudir. He has taken a house at Suq so as to have his two sons educated at the Government school.

Aftei Saihud (Albu Muhammad) defeated the 'Azainj (1905), Ghadhban farmed the ‘Azairri uq dtci a h fr°rn the Turks by prete-nom, and put in charge his brother Falih ; he farmed a so Albu Darra] and Qassat al Gharbi Muqata'ahs by prete-nom and put his brother Balasim (now dead) m charge. ‘Ah Gharbi Muqata'ah remained in the hands of Fahad, father of Kamandar (d. 1917). Ghadhban then became too much of a handful for the Turks, robbing and cutting mes of traffic on the Tigris, as well as being 50,000 liras in arrears with revenue. Finally they brought about 12,000 men and attacked him in conjunction with ‘Araibi and Yasir. ter some successes Ghadhban was heavily defeated at Abu Sidrah, Jawar, and the mouth of the Butairah, and was forced to take refuge in the hills, and the Turks gave his lands to other shaikhs. In this fighting, Abdul Karim and Falih Saihud, of the Albu Muhammad, as well as the Bahadil, Sarraj, and Sawaad tribes, were with Ghadhban. The Albu belI1 g P ow erless, had previously scattered, and many of them had gone to the Hai. Azamj in the beginning were ostensibly with Ghadhban owing to the presence of a ih Bunaiyah, but their shaikhs, who were then helping the Turks, succeeded in bringing * em against (jhadhban at the first favourable opportunity, and this defection on the part of the Azairij was the decisive factor in his ultimate defeat. He went into exile in the Ahwaz district, obtaining assistance from the Shaikh of Muhammarah. Ghadhban was still on bad terms with the Turks at the outbreak of war, but was endeavouring to ingratiate himself with them. At the same time he had not a single friend among the shaikhs, as he had behaved treacherously to all of them at different times, and had broken treaties to obtain temporary advantages. the outbreak of war the lurks brought him back, promised him the Muqata'ah of Thulthain, and gave him considerable sums to assist them in their attacks on Ahwaz. He joined them in the summer of 1915 with the Sawa'ad and some Albu Darraj, under Muhammad al Hittab, and in association with Muhammad Pasha Daghistani he may be said to have been in joint command of the forces operating against us. It was alleged at the time that he had offered £5 for the head of any British officer, but this was always stoutly denied by Ghadhban and was never fully substantiated. On our occupation of Amarah, he made overtures to us through his brother, Falih Bunaiyah, and was given a safe conduct to come in and make his submission. This he accordingly did and entered into a solemn undertaking to serve us, expressing his readiness, if necessary, to provide a force to co-operate with us when we advanced towards Kut. We did not, however, make any advance for some months, and in the meanwhile the Turks, after recovering themselves from their flight from ‘Amarah, advanced down the river, passing Ghadhban’s domicile, as far as Kumait. Ghadhban was at the time in negotiation with us for the raising of a force of 1,000 mounted men to co-operate with us and had been asked to leave his son with us as an earnest of good faith, but suddenly in the middle of negotiations it was; noticed that he had removed his camp away from the river and we soon heard that he had accepted a heavy bribe and rejoined the Turks. He seems to have taken no special part in the fighting which led up to the capture of Kut, the fact being that the Turks strongly distrusted him. After our occupation of Kut he wrote to the C.P.O. expressing his regret for what had happened, and his readiness to accept any terms from us and to send his son as an hostage. In reply he was informed that we intended to have no dealings with him for the present, but if he desired to leave the door open for ultimate pardon, he must keep away from the river and confine himself to certain approved localities. He complied with these instructions, and continued to make overtures through the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh and other third parties in the hope of being received back into the fold. Among these overtures was an offer to seize and hold Badrah for us. The offer was not accepted, as it was impossible to be sure of his bona fides. Ultimately transport camels being urgently needed for the advance of General Townshend’s force, it was decided to accept his overtures to the extent of ordering him to supply 200 camels for hire. With this order he complied, and subsequently went away eastwards towards ‘Arabistan. Subject to continued good behaviour, and in recognition of the fact that it would be impossible for him to maintain himself and his following and keep out of mischief without land or other source of income, a monthly subsidy of Rs. 1,000 a month was fixed for him on certain conditions, which he adhered to. Ghadhban has always been in relations with the Shaikh of Muhammarah (as his tribe moves into ‘Arabistan.every hot weather)—sometimes good and sometimes bad. They are now on satisfactory terms, and Ghadhban received his yearly present from the Shaikh. Notoriously brave and generous, Ghadhban exercises considerable influence over his tribe ; but he is known to be unreliable and an inveterate intriguer. He is at bitter feud with Juwi al Lazim. GHADHBAN IBN HASAN AL KHAIYUN. Aet. circa 17. He joined Badr Rumaiyidh and the Turks. Qurnah division. Brother of Salim al Khaiyun, the dispossessed Shaikh of Chabaish and was implicated in depredations on our telegraph lines. Salim is in Bombay in detention. Other sons are Falih and by a different wife, Hindal. Falih and Ghadhban at one time instituted a reign of terror agaianst Majid al Khaiyun, q.v., but fled before us to Nasiriyah. Ghadhban came in after our advance to Baghdad. (1705) f 236 GHAIDAN ‘ADWAH. Of Naiaf Huwaish quarter. Head of the ‘Adwah family and a Zuqurt. Two of his sons were deported. Entirely unreliable and a lover of money. ghaidAn agha bajlAn. Of Khaniqin. Landowner in Bin Kudrah district. Formerly a brigand of some note, but latterly settled down to quiet farming. ghAnim kirmashAh, haji. Of Najaf Huwaish quarter. Head of the Kirmashahi family and a Zuqurt. All of his relations deported in 1918 except two. Old but not harmless. GHAWI IBN HAMAD. A Sarkal of A1 Hamzah tribe of ‘Afaj, Diwaniyah district. A tool in the hands of Haji Mukhif, q.v. A proud and stupid young man. Deported 1918 for spreading false informa tion with a view to causing tribal disaffection. GHULAM HUSAIN MARANDI, SHAIKH. One of the religious leaders of Karbala. All expressed great relief at capture of Baghdad, when visited by Captain Young on 8th April. Though they praised the Kammunah Zadah, they hung back from committing themselves to asking in writing that Fakhruddin should be officially recognised Kiliddar, though they recommended the step. GHULAM RIZA KHAN. Amir-i-Jang, Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh. Son of Husain Quli Khan. The family are descendants of ‘Ali ibn Abi Talib and belong to the Bani Rabi'ah. About 600 years ago they lived near Kut. Owing to troubles with his own people, Ghulam Riza Khan’s ancestor fled to the hills and became groom to the Persian prince at Khurramabad. He rose to the position of Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh. The present man is a darwish, and wears darwish costume every Friday. He is one of the most prominent men in the Shi'ah world. He has impoverished his country, and whereas there were once 40,000 tents in the Pusht- i-Kuh, there are now not more than 11,000. His father died worth £8,000, but the present Wali is worth £1,000,000. His people would not object to a change of Walls, but at present there is no one rich and strong enough to oust him. His chief political object is to keep all strangers out of his country, specially non-Moslems. He is extremely bigoted, and does nothing without consulting the Quran. He was pro-Turk, chiefly on religious grounds, and signed a Quran for them. He would do anything except fight for them. He received £400 a month from them, and another £400 was paid to his men for patrolling the Badrah border land. He is persuaded that his mountains are impregnable. A spare, upright, well-dressed man of about 50. Autocratic, keeps a firm hand on his ministers, who are mostly negroes, and therefore have no personal influence. Exceedingly change able ; his word is said to be not worth a quarter of a kran. GHULAM SHAH KHAN. Favourite son of the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh. He has been treated by Captain Napier for acute Bright’s disease, but cannot live more than a year or so. He is 25, of good physique, now getting stout. Entirely under the thumb of his father, childish, easily pleased, not to be depended on. Incapable of ruling ; if he became Wali he would easily be ousted. He says he is pro-English, and was reported as such by the Turkish doctor sent to attend him. His political leanings are really confined to his being pro-Wali. HABIB, MULLA. Rais Baladiyah, Shahraban. He is a very energetic person, and takes great interest in any improvements. HABIB, SAIYID. See Salman, Saiyid. HABIB ABUL ‘IS, SAIYID. Hillah division. A well-known Saiyid in Mahawil Shu'bah. HABIB AL KHAZ'IRAN. Shaikh of the 'Azzah tribe, Shahraban district. It is reported that he gave Wai ?A eg ’ '' h ° w a s , co ™ mandln g at Dali ‘Abbas, a bribe of £T.50 to make him Shaikh of 1 Azzah. Habib at present is only Shaikh of the nomadic section. He has a very pleasi manner, and is ready to promise anything ; has, however, absolutely no control over a section of the tribe, and is unable to carry out his promises.37 HABIB AL MULLA MUHAMMAD, MULLA. Wealthy landowner of Shafahyah, Diwaniyah district. A straightforward character. Has done excellent service on crop estimation committees. Tactful arbitrator in disputes. HABIB AL SHALLAL. Shaikh of the Muhamdah Section of the Dulaim, Fallujah district. Born about 1880. Became Shaikh on the death of his father, Shallal ibn Habib, in 1912. Pro- British and well-meaning, but a weak Shaikh. His lack of influence primarily due to poverty. His circumstances should improve with the opening of the Saklawiyah canal, and his hold over his section, it is hoped, will increase accordingly. HABIB AL SHALL Of 'Amarah. Was non-tribal farmer of Abu Hallanah. Useful as an arbitrator in disputes. No authority with tribes. Unsatisfactory as Shaikh, and was deported to India in January, 1918, for corresponding with Turks. HACHIM IBN SA'UD. Of Dair. See Ahmad al Rashid. HADDAU, SAIYID. Mukhtar of Sadah, Ba'qubah district. Bad reports of him, but it is difficult to find a respectable person in this village of ruffians. HADI, SAIYID, NAQIB AL ASHRAF. Of Najaf, ‘Amarah Quarter. Uncle of the Kiliddar, Saiyid ‘Abbas. In reality a great supporter of Government, but pitifully weak and vacillating, and consequently useless when he is most needed. Not possessed of much intelligence. There is open enmity between him and the Kiliddar, and no remarks by either about the other should be ever listened to. Both he and the Kiliddar must be strongly backed by Government to be of any use at all. HADI KAMMUNAH. See Kammunah Zadah. HADI IBN SAIYID MUHAMMAD, SAIYID. Of Najaf, Huwaish Quarter. He is of the Saiyid Salman family, a nephew of Saiyid Mahdi. His behaviour during the blockade was not satisfactory. hAdi qazwini, saiyid. Resident of Tuwairij. Was a man of considerable weight with the Turkish adminis tration. After the Turkish re-occupation of Hillah in November, 1916, and the outrages which attended it, he went round among the tribes stirring them up against the Turks. Owns a considerable area of tapu land on the right bank of the Shatt al Hindiyah, and claims a much larger area in the hinterland, which the tribes have been in possession of for several years. His feelings towards the British Government will largely depend on the lines on which his claim is settled. HAIDAR AL QASSAB. Of Karbala. Follows his father’s trade, that of a butcher, and was reckoned head of the profession in Karbala. Now a grain merchant and trader. Has property in Umm al Hawa. Good reputation, age about 45. His son, ‘Abdul Husain, aged 25, is also a merchant of good repute. HAlQ IBN QARABAIT DANIEL KITTAB. An Armenian landholder of Hillah. HAIYAL IBN MUSA. Sawa'ad, Bait Zamil. A partner with Musa ibn Muhammad in the Musharrah estate. Of minor importance. haiyAt khAn, qAid. Head of Dinarwand tribe, Pusht-i-Kuh. Often comes in to ‘Amarah and has always maintained friendly relations with us. He is in receipt of a monthly allowance of Rs. 200. He states that the Wali is exceedingly bitter against him owing to his friendship with the British. Money presents, however small, are readily accepted by him.38 HAMAD AL ‘ABDUL WAHID. Shaikh of Tubur, originally Zubaid stock ; at Diyalah. At enmity with his neighbours, the Dafa/fa' tribe, which gives rise to continued petty disputes between the two tribes. Imprisoned for some months on suspicion of having relations with the Turks. Released for want of evidence. HAMAD IBN HASAN, MULLA. Secretary of Shaikh Salman, and acting Rais al Baladiyah of the village of Majar al Saghir. Has been found straightforward in his dealings with British Political Officers, but the whole management is really in the hand of Salman. HAMAD AL HAWWAS. Shaikh of the Dawar tribe, 150 Bait, Shammar Toqah, ‘Aziziyah district. Farms on tapu land of Daud Beg Daghistani. Hamad is an unpleasant person and made very little attempt to keep his tribe in order until severely punished. Tribe was concerned in repeated railway thefts, several being killed in jumping on and off trains at night. HAMAD AL KHALID. Of Kuwait. Inveterate foe of missionaries, but no inclination towards politics. Asked Shaikh Salim in February, 1917, to prohibit women and children from attending missionary services. The Shaikh replied :—“ The women are your women and the children your children ; it is your business.” HAMAD IBN KHAMIS. Shaikh of Khamisiyah, which was founded by his father, ‘Abdullah ibn Khamis, as a market town for Beduin caravans, Suq al Shuyukh being unapproachable in spring owing to floods. Khamisiyah occupies much the same position with regard to Suq that Zubair occupies relatively to Basrah. Shaikh Hamad is our strong ally, a Sunni and a Najdi; his father came from Buraidah. No caravans are supplied from Khamisiyah without our permission. Hamad is small in stature and of unprepossessing appearance. Suffers from something like asthma and has a stiff neck. He is all on the side of peace and quiet government. In former days he is said to have been much bullied by ‘Ajaimi and poor. This may account for his miserable house and for the dirtiness and unkemptness of his town. He has no power in men and arms but considerable influence as a landowner and as a man of reflection. He is keenly alive to his own profit in money matters. His circumstances have improved greatly through us. He is accused by many of making an excellent thing out of the blockade, but his brother and eldest son are probably more truly open to the charge than he^ He did very good work in connection with the transport of supphes by balam from Basrah to Khamisiyah and no doubt gained over it. His opinion as regards the Creek tribes between Suq and Khamisiyah is of great value. He is very impartial in is judgment of Shaikhs and does not air his private feuds and jealousies, in spite of continual suspicion o e contrary. He has been to Mecca, but this does not seem to have affected his morals, e.g., with regard to slave dealing in former times and other more dreadful Jnri Thn^Atf^u 6 n am i )lt u lon ls to become m Khamisiyah what Ibn Sabbah is in Kuwait dinne^narfip^ 11 S m P urchased m Basrah an outfit for the table and gave on trins in tbp 11 ^ 6 ^ ? 0 tde da y to British officers.

He is kept completely in the background and is somewhat discontented, but possesses no influence whatever. hamdAn ibn yasir. See Yasir, Hamdari ibn. HAMDANI, ‘ABDUL KARIM. A younger brother of Haji Hasan, aged about 25, was assistant to I. 0., Nasiriyah, where he helped ‘Ali al Mansur al Sa'dun to run the Arab scouts. Like all the Hamdani family, his tribal connection differentiates him from other townsmen. ‘Abdullah Falih puts up in his house when he comes to Nasiriyah. He went with the I. O. to Fallujah and returned to Suq early in 1918. HAMDANI, HAJI HASAN. Rais al Baladiyah at Suq al Shuyukh, landowner and big merchant, partner of Agha Ja'far of Basrah. The family have a peculiar tribal position in Suq owing to alliances with tribal Shaikhs. Haji Hasan, because of his tribal connections, is a much more important person than any other of the Suq merchants. He is not loved by the majority of the Shaikhs near Suq, though this is perhaps not to his discredit. The chief complainers are Thamir Beg al Sa'dun, Husain al Qubaiyah and Qasid of the Hachcham, the first being the brother, the second, and possibly the third also, friends of ‘Ajaimi. He is at enmity with ‘Ajaimi, and indeed none of the sons of Sa'dun have any love for him, though Thamir always stays in his house when they come to Suq—so did the Ottoman officials in Turkish time. ‘Abdullah Falih is on good terms with him. He was one of the Mujahidin at Shu'aibah, but it was mainly owing to his influence that Suq showed itself pro-British ; he is fully aware that he can hope for no mercy from the Turks. The family have business relations all up the Gharraf. He was exceedingly useful in procuring provisions for the troops at Nasiriyah. A man of about 50, impressive, outspoken, capable, accustomed to exercise authority, a valuable ally if checked in a natural tendency to become a dictator. He desires settled government that he may collect and enjoy his rents. He is a merchant politician and might have been Doge of Venice in its palmiest days. Haji Hasan avers that his tribe, the Albu Hamdan, were in the ‘Iraq at the time of the Arab conquest. There was a branch in Egypt (see the Diwan of Abu Farms al Hamdani, a member of the family who was present at the taking of Adrianople by the Turks). The Mesopotamian branch is now much split up ; a group of the Albu Hamdan are on the Zab ; there are some in Baghdad, where they own property in Kadhimain; Shaikh Hammadi ibn ‘Ali Pasha near Musaiyib is another member of the tribe, and there is a small furqah under Shaikh Hassun ibn ‘Ali Salih between Fallujah and Mahmudiyah. Hammadi Hasan Salih Kadhim ‘Abdul Karim HAMDANI, kAdhim. A younger brother of Haji Hasan. Assistant to A. P. O. Suq al Shuyukh. Cheerful, dogged, unflagging and faithful. hamdAni, sAlim. A younger brother of Haji Hasan, lives at Suq and acts as general utility man to Haji Hasan and Kadhim. HAMDI, SAIYID. Head Shaikh of the Albu ‘Abbas, lives at Samarra. A very old man and without much influence in these days. He is, however, much respected for the justice and wisdom with which he used to settle his tribal disputes. He has occasionally actively intervened in our interests and may be considered neutral. HAMID KHAN. Of Najaf. Nizam ud Daulah, grandfather of Hamid Khan, was Sadr A zam to Muhammad Shah (nephew of Path ‘Ali Shah) and the richest man in Persia. He married a daughter of Fath ‘Ah Shah. At the age of 28 his power and wealth were such that, as usual in Persia, a conspiracy was set on foot to overthrow and to murder him. This probab y would have succeeded but, through the good offices of English and Russian embassies, he and his family succeeded in escaping via Baghdad to Najaf, at which place he took up his residence. He was a man of great learning, and eventually became a Mujtahid, the40 only recorded instance of a man of distinguished family attaining this degree. His son was known for this reason as Nizam al ‘Ulama. The family are very large landlords, and the most famous and honoured in Najaf The present representative is Hamid Khan, the P. A. to the P. O. His knowledge of Najaf and its inhabitants is as unique as it is invaluable. He was Government Agent at Najaf during the autumn of 1917, before the appointment of a British Political Officer. \ relation of the Agha Khan. HAMlD AL DUKHAIR, HAjI. Of ‘Amarah, brother of Haji Salman al Dukhair of Basrah. Hamid is a most worthy man and greatly respected in ‘Amarah. He is strongly pro-British and has done good work for Government. He is a native of Najd, and a Sunni by religion. HAMID AL HASAN, SHAIKH. Head of the Bani Tamim in Balad Ruz district. Prior to and after the fall of Baghdad enriched himself with many robberies ; stood out against us until October, 1917, and during that summer continually caused trouble by petty raids against our communications. Pre sented with a gold watch by ‘Ali Ihsan Bey. Now very much subdued and has paid up all fines and debts. At enmity with the Karkhiyah, to whom he has to pay a large amount for fasl. Full of promises which do not usually materialise without pressure shifty and ambitious, he is not to be trusted. Considered eccentric. HAMID AL MIR jABIR. Shaikh of Madinah on the Euphrates above Qurnah. He belongs to the ‘Amarah a constituent of the B. Rabi'ah. He is the son of the late Humud, and cousin of Haji Mulla dhar, Mudir of Harthah. His cousin, Hasich ibn Mubarak, who was hostile to Humud remained wrth the Turks till March, 1917. Shaikh Hamud was present with a contingeni at a fighting on the Shatt al Arab, and his eldest and most promising son was killed in the action of Kut al Zam^ He therefore retired to Madinah, but a little later, after our occupation of Qurnah, he was influenced by the Shaikh of Muhammarah and Haji ‘Adhar to come over to us and proved a staunch adherent. During the time of the Turks he spent some years m prison and bore them no love. He died in December, 1916, and was succeeded by Hamid who was then 14. Hamid has shown himself headstrong and unreasonable and has lost the adhesion of most of his sarkals.

Always strongly anti-Turk. Lives at Gil and has the allegiance of about 20 villages. Acknowledged by all branches of the Talabani family as their outstanding representation, though he in no sense rules the whole tribe. Wealthy ; his property included oil wells, from which he has supplied the army since the spring of 1918. On bad terms with the Jabbari, his northern neighbours, and with the Sulaimaniyah saiyids. Capable of strong government, but has no super-tribal outlook. \\ as a fine horseman and athlete and a famous raider ; though now 80 is very vigorous. Six sons alive, none really fit to succeed him. Greatly respected outside his tribe, pious observer of the forms of religion, speaks broken Arabic. He went to Shu'aibah with the Kurd contingent ; fell out there with the Turks on account of their treatment of the Kurds. In the summer of 1917 he refused to join the Turks, and after the evacuation of Khaniqin by the Russians he prevented the Sallahiyah tribes from accompanying the Turks thither. He prevented them also from joining in the troubles near Balad Ruz in July, 1917. We got into touch with him in September, 1917, through Jamil Beg Baban of Kifri. He was then resisting successfully Turkish demands for assistance and supplies. He is noted for his personal courage, loyalty, and honesty. A good landlord and has lately become very rich owing to his policy of attracting the peasant Kurds to his lands by fair and generous treatment. * HAMMA AMIN. Chief of Balajir Bajlan.

During 1917 gave considerable assistance to Supply Department in providing sheep to military. • (1705) GharAt ibn jAsim. Shaikh of the Albu ‘Isa, Fallujah district. Born about 1858 and became Shaikh in 1890 on the death of his father. The latter was shot at his home at the instigation of the Turkish Government for unruly conduct. Karat is accordingly anti-Turk. He is very decrepit and old, but has a wide reputation of having been all that a good Shaikh should be. Even now his hold of his tribe is good. His son, ‘Aifan, a man about 28 years of age, is beginning to carry on his father’s duties. HARDAN AL ‘ABDUL HAMID. Dulaim, Ramadi district, Shaikh of the Albu ‘Aithah. He came in with A1 Sulaiman after the occupation of Ramadi in the autumn of 1917.

His territory is on the right bank of the Tigris from the east end of the Umm al ‘Uruq district to five miles above ‘Ali Gharbi. His forces were reckoned at about 400 foot. He made a signal demonstration of loyalty after Ctesiphon by riding up the river with a band of horsemen to meet the Army Commander’s steamer and was the only Shaikh of the Bani Lam who expressed his willingness to cross the river against the Turks. Fairly acute, incapable of speaking the truth. No authority over the tribe. He was turned out in March, 1916, and his brother was invited to take up the Muqata'ah, but refused to do so. The latter was therefore restored. He proved, however, so unsatis factory that he was removed in October, 1916, and Shaikh Abu Rishah, uncle of Kamandar al Fahad, was put in his place. Shaikh Tsa, his cousin, was dissatisfied with the arrange ment, on the ground that one of the Bait Jindil, presumably himself, should have been selected. HASAN MIZBAN. Bani Lam. Juwi’s uncle.

Saihud of the Sudan (q.v.) sublet a farm to him, but owing to the war and to ‘Araibi’s hostility to the Sudan he refused to pay his farm fees. ‘Araibi declared that he had not prompted the withholding of rent from the Sudan and promised that it should be paid. A man of no importance. HASAN BEG NAFTJI ZADAH. Kirkuk district, Kurd of the Kirkuk family, who take their name from the fact that they own the local oil wells. This property has been for many generations in the family and Government is content to take a tithe. Hasan Beg is a wealthy and progressive man, regarded as one of the five or six aristocrats of the place. Badly hit by the war. Age about 52, speaks Arabic, pleasant and intelligent. HASAN PARTU. Customs and Revenue Mudir at ‘Ali Gharbi. He was formerly Mudir under the Turks and knows his work well.

The A.P.O. of Suq caught him towards the end of 1915 and sent him down to Basrah, where he was imprisoned. He managed to escape and returned o is tribe where he was a source of difficulty to us.

The latter has proved reliable and has far greater influence than Hamid. HASSUBI AL HAJI DARWISH. Of Dokhalah, Daltawah area. Brother of ‘Abdul Karim, q.v. A worthless fellow. HASSUDI AL HAJI DARWISH. Of Ddkhalah, Daltawah area, brother of ‘Abdul Karim, q.v. A worthless fellow, only a little better than his other brother Hassubi. HASSUN EFFENDI IBN DARWISH ‘ALL Leads the faction in Ba'qubah opposed to Muhammad Taufiq Effendi. Lacks Muhammad Taufiq’s energy but has considerable influence in the town. Muhammad Taufiq has secretly told many stories of this man’s peculations and general dishonesty under the Turks ; it is probable that he fears him. Was not a member of the Committee of Union and Progress, to which Muhammad Effendi belonged for some time. HASSUN SHORBAH, HAjI. Of Najaf, Huwaish quarter. Head of the Shorbah family, who are Zuqurts ; a liar and unreliable, but oddly enough his conduct during the Blockade was good. HASSUNI. Shaikh of the Sukuk, Ba'qubah district. A nice old gentleman, who is looked up to. Sa‘ad probably has most influence in the tribe. Has obeyed all orders punctually. HATIM IBN hadhdhAl. Shaikh of the ‘Atabah, Balad district. A young, rather refined-looking Arab. His father was one of the three Shaikhs who counted for anything in Balad area before the war. He is a Shi'ah and pro-British. His tribe is well behaved. HATIM AL MOZAN. Paramount Shaikh of the Juwaibir (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Bani Khaiqan). ‘Ajil al Muhsin, q.v., has also much influence with the tribe. Hatim is a simple straightforward countryman, very honest, always anxious to help ; influence considerable. One of the staunchest supporters of Government. HATIM IBN SAIHUD. See Saihud, Hatim ibn. hAttAb al MIR jAbir. Stftf Manshad abMir Jabir. HAZZA* IBN MUHAIMID. Recognised head Shaikh of Mu'amrah (Zubaid) and a member of the Hillah Tribal Majlis, is second in importance in Hillah district to ‘Addai al Jaryan, q.v. Hazza‘, curiously enough, is a Sunni, although the majority of his tribesmen are Shi'ahs. The reason for this is probably not difficult to find, viz., that as a Sunni he was in a better position to work with the Turkish Officials than if he had been a Shi'ah. The majority of tribesmen in this area were originally Sunnis, but the influence of the Holy Shi ah cities of Karbala and Najaf probably undermined their original faith. The Zubaid were mostly converted three generations ago in the time of Shaikh Wadi, by one of the Oazwini Saiyids. Hazza* has never given trouble. He is more reliable and straighter than any other Shaikh in the Hillah district, and he has his tribesmen under excellent control. This is by no means an easy performance, as the Mu'amrah have the worst name in the district as thieves, and in the early days of British occupation they lived well up to their reputation, indulging both in rifle thieving from the Military and highway robberies. Hazza co operated with us most energetically in stopping this, and did not hesitate in producing the parties responsible. Heavy fines imposed on the section concerned were found to be the best way of dealing with such matters, but in two cases sentences of four years penal servitude were imposed. , The Mu'&amp;mrah tribe are mostly cultivating on the Nil Canal, but they are also mixed up with the Juhaish in Mahawil lands. In Nil Shu'bah there are also the Azzah and46 ’Ammar sections of Juhaish, but these sections have notified their willingness to tu to Hazza', which is a very convenient solution for the following reasons :— (1) Faisal is not able to control them. (2) It enables the whole of ‘Nil Shu'bah to be considered as being part of Hazza/’s sphere, although Mahawil still remains partly Mu'amrah partly Juhaish. His tribe are of thievish habits, but he effectively checked an outbreak of stealin in the summer of 1918, and he has got his people under control. The Mu'amrah have paid their revenue before anyone else. hAwi ibn shabib. Mandali District. Of the Sa'dah tribe. He belongs to a family that formerly held the shaikhship and, as he is capable and bears a good character, might do well in place of ‘Abdul ‘Aziz. HIBAT AL DIN SHAHRISTANI. Shi'ah of Najaf. Age about 36. A man of great mental activity. For the two years preceding the outbreak of war he edited a paper called A1 Tim, which acquired considerable reputation in the Shi'ah world, but in the last numbers he pronounced against the transport of corpses and their burial in the Holy Places, therefore drawing upon himself the con demnation of all Shi'ahs. Subsequently, however, a number of the younger Shi'ahs especially in Persia and India, have approved his views. Nevertheless, he was obliged to cease writing, and to live for some time in retirement at Baghdad. Rejected bv his own community he sought favour with the Turks, and issued a Fatwah in favour of jihad though he was not at heart anti-British. He at first marched with the army, but finding the perils of war greater than he anticipated he disguised himself in Beduin dress and toured the tribes preaching Turkish propaganda. The Turks offered him no reward he ImeH^ t0 K i a ce™f in ’ ?; nd desis i ed from an Y further effort on their behalf, indeed, HindfanH WiH 1 h ° 'T®' 1 . 1511 sub j ects . am °ng others Muhammad Ridha al , , ' , , Saiyid Abdul Hasan al Hindu to escape to Basrah.

Shammar To ^, ‘Aziziyah district, living with ‘Abbud alHUMAIDI AL FARHAN. Shammar Jarba‘. In active co-operation with the lurks during the whole of the War. A man of about 45, fine presence and generally accounted to be the best educated and most civilized of the Jarba‘ shaikhs. He was the Turkish candidate for the position of paramount chief immediately before the War. He was in Mosul when we occupied the town, and was made by us responsible for certain sections of the Shammar tribe. HUMAIYID AL SAIYID SUFUQ. Nafafshah tribe, 100 Bait, shares with Tarfah the headship of the Shammar Tdqah, ‘Azizlyah district. Was formerly regarded as the paramount Shaikh, but lost a good deal of his influence by staying out after the Shammar Tdqah had settled down to cultiva tion on the river bank. Has not the same personality as Tarfah or Challub, and does not exercise the same influence over his sections as the former two. He is pleasant and obliging, but unable to enforce proper discipline. HUMUD BAHICH, SAIYID. Of Hillah. A much respected family. Wealthy. HUMUD IBN KHALlFAH. See Mushattat ibn Khalifah. HUMUD IBN SUWAIT. Paramount Shaikh of the Dhafir, 1,500 fighting men. A man of about 45, good Badu type, intelligent, and reckoned among the tribes a fairly good politician. He is personally on terms of friendship with Ibn Rashid and at enmity with ‘Ajaimi ibn Sa'dun. With Sharshab ibn Shaham of the Budur and Manshad ibn Hubaiyib of the Ghazzi he formed a combine against ‘Ajaimi in our interest in the early part of 1915. But his authority over his own tribe is not complete and a sub-tribe of the Samid section were with ‘Ajaimi, as well as a sub-tribe of the Budur section, the Sa'id. These last, however, came in to Humud when ‘Ajaimi fled before an attack in March, 1916. ‘Ajaimi, with a small following of ‘Ajman and Shammar (Ibn ‘Ajil and some 20 horse), raided the combined encampment of Humud and Sharshab near Qasr al Shaqrah in March, 1916. The two shaikhs sent envoys to Basrah asking for our assistance and were given a couple of hundred rifles, together with some ammunition and provisions and money. They promised in return to protect our supply depot at Khamisiyah and to keep ‘Ajaimi out of the occupied territory. With this assistance they were able to repulse him. In April, 1916, Humud was given authority to grant or refuse passage to all caravans coming in to Khamisiyah from the desert. There is a great deal of jealousy between him and Ibrahim al ‘Abdullah, Shaikh of Zubair. Towards the end of April, 1916, Humud raided in the Shamiyah a body of Dhafir who had attached themselves to Zubair and were numbered by Ibrahim among his own people. Visited Ibn Rashid in June, 1916, when the latter was at Chabdah, but returned to his camp near Khamisiyah and joined Ibn Tawalah in an attack on the Amir. Humud is grasping and avaricious, unpopular with his own tribe. HUMUDI PASHA AL MALLAK. Of Basrah. Of good family, but quarrelled with his relations and took service as a Ballam with the Mudir of Abul Khasib, Haji Najm. He married the widow of the Turkish Mir Bahr who brought him considerable estates. He is now one of the richest men in Basrah, though he lost a good deal of money by standing surety for the Albu Muhammad Shaikhs. A Turkish Wali, Hamdi Pasha, borrowed £ T. 1,000 from him and gave him in exchange a Suq in Basrah (Suq al Humudi) which was said to be worth / T.20,000. He was Rais al Baladiyah of ‘Ashar. Turkish in sympathy. He went with the Turks to Kut al Zain at the beginning of the war, and provided them with much money. Fled to ‘Amarah with Jawid Pasha, but subsequently returned to Basrah. A Shi'ah ; had very great influence over the lower classes, with whom he has been so closely associated, and was, therefore, a man of importance. Ignorant, debauched, drinks. HUNAIN IBN HANNUN. Paramount chief of the Zaiyad, Shamiyah division. Cultivates on both sides of the Shamiyah channel near the Bazaiz of the Ghammas. His tribe, like the Ibrahim, is a purely riverain stock, and Hunain is only a slightly polished replica of his own adherents. HUSAIN EFFENDI.

Has sufficient influence over the poorer people to make him fairly efficient. HUSAIN AL ‘ALI, SHAIKH. Kirkuk district. Paramount Shaikh of the ‘Ubaid Arabs ; generally lives at Shubaichah. Position everywhere acknowledged, but as he is now about 80 and not strong, his sons and brothers do not obey him and there are several rebels against his authority, such as Shaikh Farhan of the Albu ‘Ali. His intentions are good but he has little power. Not really to be trusted, but more so than the rank and file of the ‘Ubaid. HUSAIN AL BA'Aj, SAIYID. A man of considerable importance at Qarmat Bani Sa'id, near Suq, where his nephew, Saiyid Yusuf, is Mudir. The Ba'aj have property in Muhammarah and stand in relations of friendship with the Shaikh.

He escaped and returned to Basrah in October, 1916. HUSAIN AL MAIDAN. Shaikh of the Albu Naim, 130 Bait ; a strong section of the Zubaid, Juhaish.

He holds the Tapu lands on the Tigris right bank alongside his present Muqata'ah. A man of 55. Has been useful and straightforward in deciding disputes between shaikhs. IBRAHIM IBN ‘ABDULLAH AL RASHID. Shaikh of Zubair. The Al Rashid are of ‘Anizah stock and came originally from Huraimlah in the ‘Aridh, but they have been settled in Zubair for 200 years. Ibrahim was a connection of Khalid al ‘Aun of Al Hirfi, Shaikh of Zubair, who was murdered in 1907 by Ibrahim’s brother Ahmad and his negroes. Muhammad Beg al Mushri was appointed Shaikh by the Turks, but with a very limited authority. Zubair continued, however, to be for all practical purposes independent. A Mudir represented the interests of the Ottoman Government, but the town was exempt from conscription. Muhammad al Mushri was in intimate relations with ‘Ajaimi al Sa'dun and was turned out by us just before the battle of Shu'aibah. Ibrahim was installed in his place as a relation of the old ruling family. (The Hirfi and the Rashid had long been at enmity, and a famous battle was fought between them some 40 years ago.) In recognition of his loyal services, Ibrahim has been given the farming rights over the valuable estate formerly belonging to Ghalib al ‘Umar on the left bank of the Shatt al ‘Arab and is warmly pro-British. Aet. 47 in 1916, intelligent, pleasant-mannered, has loyally accepted the conditions of the blockade and furnishes the C.P.O. with news of the desert. Is an exceedingly businesslike and shrewd person to deal with and has filled his part as Shaikh of Zubair in difficult situations with invariable tact and astuteness. Small in stature, he is not a commanding personality but enjoys respect, if not popularity. There is a good deal of jealousy between him and Ibn Suwait. ‘Abdul Latif Mandil [q.v.) is hostile to him. He has his town in excellent control. As a Najdi he has a hearty contempt for the Muntafiq, and as a townsman he professes to despise the wildness of the Beduin. He reckons himself among the Mutamaddinin, i.e., civilised, and would do his best to forward the cause of economic progress, so long as he was not called on to expend money from his own pocket. His opinion on Arabs is generally of great value. He executes admirably any commission entrusted to him, so long as he is given clear and precise instructions, and where price is no object., Reads and writes his own tongue. He rejoices in entertaining English ojfhcers. He would, however, much like to preserve his independent position as the shaikh of the desert oasis, which will be impossible under modern conditions. IBRAHIM rABDUL RAZZAQ. Sunni member of the Hillah Majlis—generally out of Hillah. Well educated man— apparently of nice disposition and agreeable.ibrAhIm al ‘amAri, hAji.

Mozan went blind and the lease was put up to auction ; ‘Asachir came in as partner with Fahad but fees were run up to an enormous extent by the fact that Juwi al Lazim and Shabib a Mizban, q.v., always jealous of Fahad, bid against him. Asachir died immediately after he had taken the lease. Fa'al and Qunfudh claimed that their names were entered on the lease as heirs to ‘Asachir, but Fahad, denied all knowledge of this. He turned them out and they took refuge first with Juwi and then with the Bait Jindil. In 1911 there was a great fight between Juwi and Fahad on one side and Ghadhban al Bunaiyah and t e Bait Tindil on the other, Qunfudh and Fa'al fighting with the latter. The Turks intervened and effected a conciliation, but the claim of Qunfudh and Fa al to half the estates was not settled. They occupied half of the Shuwaimiyah estate, on the northernmost borders of the ‘Ali Gharbi estate. We disallowed their claims after attempting to get them to accept a compromise. They are now living with Juwi. Fahad was at first obige o join the Turks but welcomed their withdrawal. In August, 1915, he attacked the TmUis cavalry and drove them back above ‘Ali Gharbi. Early in 1916 he was reported to be intriguing with Ghadhban al Bunaiyah and refused to supply us with sheep He was therefore sent for to Basrah in April, 1916, ostensibly on account of arrears of taxes but after about two months’ detention was allowed to return, and remained in his muqata a till his death.60 KAMIL AL BATT'IKH.

KAMMUNAH ZADAH, ‘ABDUL HAMID. Of Karbala. Son of Muhammad ‘Ali Kammunah, q.v. A young man about 20, pleasant manners, intelligent. At the special request of Saiyid Muhammad, Kadhim Yazdi was allowed to hold the office of Kiliddar, which had been in the hands of his uncle Fakhri, on the deportation of the latter in 1917. But after his father and his cousin, Shaikh Hadi, had both been found wanting, the Kiliddarship was definitely taken away from the Kammunah family and returned to Saiyid ‘Abdul Husain, ousted from the position by Fakhri. Muhammad Mahdi Kiliddar Hasan Kiliddar Muhammad Husain Kiliddar for short period Mahdi Hadi Fakhruddin Kiliddar from 1916-1917 KAMMtNAH ZADAH, FAKHRUDDIN. Brother of Haji Muhammad ‘Ali Kammunah of Karbala. In the beginning of the troubles at Karbala (April 21st, 1916) the Turkish Commandant, ‘Ali Effendi, came to his house and accused him of having encouraged the Yasir Arabs to come to the help of the townsmen against the B. Hasan. Fakhri tried to reassure him and was arrested, upon which the Karbala rising began. After the townsmen had driven out the Turks he was mainly responsible for restoring order. He and his brother were charged with the adminis tration of the town after the conquest of Baghdad, but he was found to be canying on a brisk trade with the Turks, and in September, 1917, was deported to India. Fakhri held the post of Kiliddar. KAMMUNAH ZADAH, HADI. Of Karbala, Rais Baladiyah under our administration. Convicted of gross dishonesty in the discharge of his duties and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment in Basrah gaol, July, 1918. KAMMUNAH ZADAH, MUHAMMAD ‘ALL The leading town Shaikh of Karbala. Wrote to C.P.O., October 24th, 1915, saying that he was pacifying the B. Hasan and hatlah, and proposing that we should agree to establish a sacred Province extending from Najaf to Samarra, and including Kadhimain, with himself as hereditary ruler. The C.P.O. sent him a colourless reply and a small present, for which he expressed effusive gratitude. He was absent at Najaf at the time of the Kaibala troubles of 1916. We subsidized him regularly as opportunity offered. Immediately after the fall of Baghdad he came in to see Sir Percy Cox, and was entrusted with the carrying on of administration at Karbala, there being then no better alternative. He cannot have been unaware of the trade which his brother Fakhri was carrying on with the Turks during the summer of 1917, and was probably a party to it. W 7 hen Fakhri was deported im September, 1917, Muhammad ‘Ali was summoned to Baghdad, and after some hesitation obeyed. He was permitted to remain in Baghdad, and was given an allowance. His private life was a scandal, and in the summer of 1918 he was found to61 be carrying on intrigues against us through his agent, Muhammad Shahbandar, and was deported to India in July. He was very unpopular in Karbala, where he had used his authority ill, and his disappearance was welcomed by all. KARAM ‘ALI IBN MULLA HASAN. Persian by birth, resides in ‘Amarah. A mountebank of mushroom growth. He gambled in Government Contracts, and got mixed up with Gagrit, late S. and T. Agent. Karam ‘Ali ended his career by being sentenced to one year’s hard labour for forgery in 1917. KARIM BEG DILO. Of Kani Masi Pchuka, Khaniqin district. The youngest of the Dilo in Khaniqin. Not a good character, though will probably settle down as he gets older. Could not be entrusted with any mission. KARIM BEG IBN FATAH BEG jAF BEGZADAH. Kifri district. One of the most influential members of the Jaf Begzadah family. His father, Fatah Beg ibn Muhammad Pasha, was brother to Mahmud Pasha. Karim Beg owns by tapu writ large lands in Sar Qabah-Shirwanah district. His house, Qabah Shirwanah, was built by his grandfather, Muhammad Pasha. The Jaf chiefs have accepted him as their representative in the Kifri district, and he is a possible candidate for the supreme headship of the Jaf. Thoroughly pro-British, though his enforced connection with the German officers during the Turkish occupation gave rise to false inpressions of his feelings. His management of practically the whole nomad sections of the Jaf tribe during their stay in the Kifri district is much assisting our administration. KARIM KHAN JUMUR. Lives at Bin Kudrah, Khaniqin division. Cousin of Muhammad Amin Agha, who was deported for complicity with the Germans in the neighbourhood. Harmless, and on one occasion rendered assistance to our irregulars against the Turks. Chief of the village of Barikah and adjacent lands. KASHKUL IBN YASIR. See Yasir, Shintah ibn. KASHMUR AL ‘ALL Shaikh of the Manasir tribe, 80 Bait, Shammar Toqah, ‘Aziziyah district. Most unsatisfactory. The Manasir have the worst reputation in the district and complaints of theft are very frequent against them. Mostly professional thieves and make little pretence at cultivation. KHAIYUN AL ‘UBAID. Nasiriyah division. Paramount shaikh of the ‘Abudah, a tribe of something over 3 000 fighting men round Shatrat al Muntafiq. Khaiyun belongs to the s^^ll Sinajir section, and owed his position to his own activity and to the political capacity of his Wazir Kadhim, an astute Kurd. His hold on Shatrah market gives him control over the local trade. He usually lives either at Sudaifah, east of Shatrah, or at Hawi, on the edge of the town. Age about 30. He has bad manners, is cruel and has a large store of low cunning. Fearless, and a born fighter. Owing to his faithlessness and stupid brutahty most of t e neighbouring tribes, more especially the Khafajah, were a j- f f ud wl ^ the Abudah - e was a constant thorn in the side of the Turks. In July 1914 the Ottoma,r Government sent a small force against him, which he defeated. At the outbreak of war he was heavily bribed by the Turks, and he joined ‘Abdullah Fahh al Sa dun against us in January, 1915 with 500 to 600 men. Though he abandoned the Turks in March, his men are said to have taken part in the battle of Shuaibah. He was made OHoman Qaimmaqam of Shatrah in June, 1915. Khaiyun came m to us m December, 1917 ’ a ^ d P ald U P R ^ 10 000 as a fine. He went up to Baghdad, where he paid his respects to the C.C., Sir P. Cox. He was allowed to run Shatrah affairs on a salary of Rs.500, pending, the appoint ment of a Political Officer. When this took place in April, 1918, he declared himse f freed of further responsibility and retired to his tribe. KHALAF. , Sabean member of the Majlis al Baladiyah at.QaTat Salih.

He is much too important a personage to be forced to confine himself to the truth. Has three sons, all influential and bloods of the vffiale Rather disliked by the poorer classes. Two of the sons, Zaidan and Alwan, 'ed t0 make money by trading on their employment by Intelligence to extort bribes from the people.

He behaved well and in 1915 was the only Bait Zamil Shaikh who nearly paid up his revenue dues in full. He acts as a check upon Shaikh Musa, who fears that Khalaf may be made principal Shaikh of the section. KHALAF IBN SUWAIT. The most influential of the Albu Saqar Shaikhs (Shammar), inhabitant of Jazirah. Called on the Political Officer in May 1918, in company with four others ; little is known of his personal characteristic ; he professed to be willing to supply camels if required for Government transport. He and his tribe are strongly suspected of running contraband to the enemy. KHALAF AL WARDI. Shaikh of Jubur, 406 Bait, originally Zubaid stock ; cultivate karad lands between Bawi and Diyalah.

KHAZ'AL KHAN, SHAIKH OF MUHAMMARAH, K.C.I.E., K.C.S.L Tribal chief of the Muhaisin and Governor of the Persian Province of Southern ‘Arabistan, a position which he holds nominally from the Shah, but which is virtually hereditary. He succeeded his brother Miz'al, who was murdered in 1897. Before his accession he had secretly assured us of his intention of encouraging British enterprise and when he came to power he made good his promises and has been consistently friendly and loyal to his engagements ever since, sometimes in circumstances of no small difficulty. In 1909 he was invested with the K.C.I.E. and the Persian Government was then informed that we had special relations with him and that in the event of any encroachment on his rights he would have our support. In 1915 he was invested by His Excellency the Viceroy at Muhammarah with the K.C.S.L Shaikh Khaz'al was on terms of the closest friendship with Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait and from 1890 onwards both chiefs assisted and subsidised Saiyid lalib of Basrah {q.v) Rebel Shaikhs along the Tigris, notably Ghadban al Bunaiyah of the Bani Lam and Falih ibn Saihud of the Al Bu Muhammad, were accustomed to seek temporary asylum in his territory. Shaikh Khaz'al has great tribal influence in what was formerly Turkish and is now British occupied territory, owing to the presence along the Shatt al Arab of a very large number of Muhaisin tribesmen, who look to him in all matters which come under tribal jurisdiction. He owns extensive property in the Basrah Wilayat. From the outbreak of war he has given us all possible assistance compatible with his position. He placed a large house near Basrah at our disposal for use as a Base Hospital. When in the spring of 1915 the tribes in his territory, incited by the preaching of the Jihad by Turkish emissaries, rose in revolt and assisted the Turks to attack our troops at Ahwaz and cut the pipe line, his steadfast attitude and his unshaken confidence in our ability to deal with the situation, combined with our success at Sha aibah, did much to prevent further secessions and to assist the rapid restoration of order and confidence which supervened in ‘Arabistan as soon as the Turks were driven across the Ivarkhah by the operations of the 12th Division. . , He has since co-operated closely with us in preserving order, but the Bam lurul have seldom shown themselves entirely amenable to his authority, and the chaotic condition of Northern ‘Arabistan is a constant menace to peace. As a great Arab chief and a Shi'ah he is respected by all the tribes of .Southern ‘Iraq ; he has used his influence on our behalf and has been very serviceable as an adjudicator of internal disputes among the tribesmen. Born in 1864, of commanding appearance, tall and dignified, but probably not a good life. Guided in all affairs of state by his exceptionally able counsellor Hap Muhammad ‘Ali Behbehani, Rais al Tujjar. His eldest son Chasib, born m 18J1, is unpopular Wtth the tribes and unlikely to prove a satisfactory successor. Ihe younger sons were educated at the American Missionary School in Basrah , t e c cs , u Hamid (q.v.), born in 1901, is an intelligent and promising boy. Shaikh Khaz al lives , at Failiyah, two miles below Muhammarah, where he has built himself an imposing and remarkable palace.64 KHIDHR, SHAIKH OF See Muhammad al ‘Ujairib.

KHUDHAIRI, ‘ABDUL WAHAB. Of Basrah. A cousin of 'Abdul Qadir of Baghdad. Like ‘Abdul Jabbar, knows how to handle local Arabs. Exiled to India.

In November, 1915, they approached Shaikh Salim, second son, with peace proposals. He replied that they must apply to ( ai , , ubarak, whereupon Dhaidan came to Kuwait and made submission. Ibn a u , however, insisted on their ejection from Kuwait territory and this took place in e ruary, 1916. Khumaiyidh, with about 50 followers, joined ‘Ajaimi and remained with lm ‘ A J r n r‘ UgUSt ’T 1 191 ?’ he went down to Safwan and with some of the ‘Ajman raided some Muitair m Ibn Sabbah’s territory and took booty.

Kuraidi is obliging, but has not much character or influence with his tribe ; has given considerable assistance supplying Sheep to military, and camels for transport purposes. Considering that the tribe is rather unapproachable, they are on the whole very satisfactory. KURAIYIM, HAJI. Himahmah (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Mujarrah). An important personage in the tribe. Is reputed a good arbitrator in land disputes and has frequently helped the A.P.O., Suq, in such cases. KUWAIT, SHAIKH OF. See Salim ibn Mubarak al Sabbaj. LAFTAH IBN AHMAD, HAjI. Agent in ‘Amarah for ‘Abdul Qadir Khudhairi of Baghdad. Respectable man. LAFTAH AL SHAMKHI. Shamiyah district. Head of the Jarrah, the largest section of the Bani Hasan. Under Turkish rule Laftah was something of a firebrand, and gave trouble pretty constantly. Latterly he has suffered from poor health and has been inclined to live in Kufah. It is probable that some of the intrigues which led to the Najaf riots of January and March were carried out in his country, and he wanted to be out of the way. Also we have backed ‘Alwan al Sa'dun, q.v., and his nose is rather out of joint. He is rather wild but straight and outspoken. He has a very strong hold over his tribe, and is an exceptionally energetic cultivator who will probably become rich. He has very greatly improved in the last six months and gives promise of becoming a useful person. LAM, BANI.

A respectable man but of no influence At heart an admirer and supporter of the British Government, but very weak and liable to go with the majority. MAHDI AYATULLAH ZADAH KHURASANI, MIRZA. Son of Ayatullah Akhund Mulla Kadhim Khurasani, the greatest Mujtahid of his time and famous as the leader of the Constitutionalist party in Persia. Akhund was a remark able man, and a large amount of the success of the Constitutionalist party was' due to his championship. His influence as a Mujtahid, however, decreased in proportion as his interference in politics increased, and it was on the ruins of his power that Saiyid Muhammad Kadhim rose. In dealing with Saiyid Muhammad Kadhim or with Mirza Mahdi, it is well to remember that religious influence is incompatible with political activity. Mirza Mahdi himself is well known in Persia. He is not particularly clever, but thoroughly untrustworthy and lives in intrigue. His relations with the shaikhs of Najaf were by no means such as to endear him to the lovers of order and justice. All communications between the Persian Capital and 'Iraq are made through him. He is not an 'alim. His brother, Agha Najafi, is the greatest Mujtahid in the Khurasan. His younger brother, Mirza Ahmad of Najaf, is an ‘alim. MAHDI IBN HAJI HASAN, AL MAlIYAH. Of ‘Amarah. A non-tribal farmer. Farms both under Muhammad ibn ‘Araibi and ‘Usman. A good farmer and treats his fallahs well. A very smart business man, and does well in spite of the enmity of the Shaikhs which his success and rather sharp tongue en genders. Mahdi is rather inclined to think that the British will interfere to a greater extent than they are prepared to do in the internal affairs of tribal Shaikhs. Mahdi is deserving of the greatest praise. He is the sort of sarkal we should like if there were no shaikhs, which is the highest praise he could be given. Generous to his fallahs and loyal without reserve to us. One of the best Arabs in the ‘Amarah division. MAHDI HAJI HUSAIN. Badrah district. Rich mallak of Jassan, popular and generous.

Well known as mean and miserly. MAHDI TABATABAl, SAIYID. Of Karbala Uncle of Saiyids ‘Abdul Husain and Muhammad Sadiq ; owes his influence locally chiefly to his family connections.

One of the partners in the Bahathah Muqata'ah, south east of ‘Amarah [see his brothers Saihud and Wadi and his cousin ‘Amir ibn Faris). ‘Araibi Pasha (father of Muhammad) is said to have cut off all the water from the Khasaf district of this farm (it came by a feeder from the Zubair canal), but it was decided in November, 1915, that the land has no right to this water and must make agreement for watftr with the Chahalah estate.

On the second capture of the town (autumn of 1918) he retired, presumably under compulsion, to Irbil, but returned in a few weeks and con tinues to hold his office under us. An efficient and advanced man generally, but not universally liked. A humorist, and therefore considered shallow. Suspected of betray ing to the Turks the relations between the British Government and Shaikh Mahmud Qarah Daghli, thus causing the imprisonment of the latter, but this is not certain. Age about 48. Very anti-tribal in attitude. MAJID, SAIYID. Brother of Saiyid Asad of Daur. Deserves especial mention as the most courteous old fellow.

Brother of Karim Khan Bajlan, succeeded him in the chieftainship of the Jumur section of the Bajlan.

Came to Qurnah with 2,000 men to help the Turks in November, 1914, and was given a Turkish decoration. Subsequently with ‘Araibi, expelled from Hilmi Pasha’s army for treachery, came in to us in July, 1915. His loyalty to us was rather shaky after the fall of Nut. He farms the Majar al Kabir Muqata'ah. The rice cultivated by Albu Muhammad and the wheat and millet by B. Malik or Sarraj. A man of 34, rather effeminate, said to be immensely rich, and has a very strong body guard of armed slaves. Has married a daughter of Zabun ibn Yasir. He is obstinate and childish. As Shaikh of Majar Kabir he has more influence with the Fartus tribe than any other shaikh. Lazy, but amenable to a strong hand. MAJID AL YUSUF. Mukhtar of Mansuriyat al Shatt, Daltawah area. Very weak and quite unreliable. The village swarms with libellers, false informants, and bad fellows. MA'JUN AL HAMMADI. Chief of the Sufran, Bani Huchaim, Samawah district. A friend of Naif al ‘Ajll, and not unlike him. Rumoured to have taken a keen interest in the Najaf troubles of 1918. The Sufran are one of the most troublesome of the Bani Huchaim tribes. Ma'jun submitted in November, 1917, but seems to be unable or unwilling to make his tribe obey orders. MALIK HUSAIN KHAN. Governor and Treasurer of Pusht-i-Kuh, where he is probably the most influential man. Aged about 54, a negro. Any decision he comes to would be acquiesced in by the Taifas. As Ezra’s friend he has lost ground and is desirous of a change of Walis. He now supports Amanullah Khan, the Wali’s eldest son (died December, 1918). He is an intelligent man of strong character, worth cultivating. Said by the Kurds to be a man of his word. If he says he will support us, he will certainly do so, and his influence would be of great assistance. His son, Muhammad Rahim Khan, is Chief of the customs. mAna‘ al lull Head of the Qurait. Bulk of his tribe are on the Abu Ruwaiyah, but a section of them are settled on the left bank of the Shatt al Hindiyah at Manfahan. This tribe had a bad reputation, but since one of their villages was burnt with the help of troops, Mana’s influence over his tribe has increased largely, and like the rest of the tribes, they are too much occupied with agriculture to lapse into their former evil ways. manAhi al muqotar. Second cousin of Mandhur al ‘Abdullah, Diwaniyah district. Shaikh of Al Juhaish. Mandhur’s right-hand man. manAshi LUMI. Acting chief Rabbi of Hillah—respected. He has probably not much influence with his people. He is an old inhabitant of Hillah. MANDHUR AL ‘ABDULLAH. Paramount Shaikh of Afaj tribes, nephew of the late Haji Tarfah.

The eldest son Yusuf Pasha, was a man of the world and brought the family into prominence. He was a hard drinker and his death was caused by his drinking a bottle of carbolic acid while m a.state of intoxication. Yusuf hated the Turks and used to say that service under the Indians would be better than service under the Ottomans. After his death,71 ‘Abdul Latif, who had hitherto lived in retirement and played no public part, came to the fore. He was the right-hand man of Saiyid d alib, and being backed by him he was beyond the arm of the law. Grasping and tyrannical. Already wealthy, and an owner of palm gardens, he made good use of the opportunities offered to increase his substance at the expense of his neighbours. He was treated with consideration by the Ottoman authorities and, though he has no sympathy with the Turks, he is always careful to stand well with the powers that be. He has a house at Zubair, where he usually spends the summer Although as a friend of Talib’s he belongs naturally to the anti-‘Ajaimi faction, there is no love lost between him and the Shaikh of Zubair, who is also against ‘Ajaimi. In the spring of 1916 Ibn Sa'ud summoned him to Riyadh to undertake the reorganisation of his revenues. He went subsequently to Bombay. A man of about 45, pleasant mannered, specious, clever, a good talker and hospitable. Has a keen eye to the main chance. MANDIL, ‘ABDUL WAHAB. Younger brother of ‘Abdul Latif, q.v.

They have now been allowed to return to their homes at Madinah. Ournah division. MANSHAD AL SARIN. Shaikh of the ‘Atbah, Balad Ruz district. A scheming little fellow without much influence.

Albu Kh&amp;lifah, Chief of the Shichach section. (Muntafiq, B. Malik.) A minor personality, not a leading Shaikh, has done good work and has always been helpful. He should not receive special recognition as a Shaikh, but is a fitting object for consideration on account of his goodwill. The Albu Khalifah are on the Hamidi canal (for the last two years almost dry) south of the Mazliq. They do not stretch as far as the Umm Nakhalah ; 400-500 men.7‘2 MARHUN AL HAjI KHALKHAL.

MIR HUSAIN IBN QAlD ‘ABBAS, QAlD. Head of Qaid Khurdah tribe of Pusht-i-Kuh, and neighbour of Qaid Haiyat, with whom he is not on good terms. He came into ‘Amarah in October, 19l6, to present his respects to the A.P.O. (and incidentally to obtain a pass for the export of goods). Expressed himself to be entirely at the service of the British Government, but the value of the assurance is doubtful. MIRI, HAJI.

He signally failed to keep his promise. He lived for some years with the ‘Azzah, as he was on bad terms with Husain al ‘Ali, paramount Shaikh of the ‘Ubaid, who would not allow him to exert any authority among the ‘Ubaid sections. For this reason he is now living with a section of the Albu Haiyaza' tribe. He has no relationship with this tribe, but commands influence among them, as is shown by the number of his tents. Is considered a good leader in a fight ; possessed of more brains than most of his confreres, he might, given suitable opportunity, obtain much greater control than he exercises at present.

With his brother Abul Hail joint Rais of the Hawal (Muntafiq, Bani Malik Bani Khaiqan). Both rather slippery gentlemen with a foot in either camp. Muhalhil is the best of the two and now behaves well. Abul Hail was connected with the intrigue to oust Haji Muhammad ibn Husain {q.v.) from the Fuhud.

Though in a humble position, he is one of the most pro mising men employed by Government at Suq.

Passed through Nasiriyah and saw the C.PX). in Basrah, on his way to Persia He was the bearer of letters signed by the people of Karbala to the Wall of Pusht- i-Kuh and other Persian grandees, describing the outrages committed by the Turks and asking the Persians for assistance.

He formed part of the Haiyat Muslihah, the Conciliatory Party, organised by the Ottoman Government in Najaf. In March 1916, when he was on a preaching campaign against us m Badrah and Pusht-i-Kuh, we offered him /500 on condition that he ceased from his unfriendly attitude towards us and from intriguing with the Wali of Pusht-i-Kuh, and retired to Mashhad in Persia till the end of the War and a second £500 on his arrival there. He failed to respond but retired to Najaf. His hostility to us was due to fact that his father suffered severely in pocket from Colonel Newmarch’s reorganisation of the Oudh Bequest. He was deeply implicated in the troubles which occurred in the town during the winter of 1917-1918. Documents captured from the German Political Officer at Anah in March, 1918, showed that he was President of Islamic Rebellion Committee, and he was certainly concerned in the plot which ended in the murder of Capt. Marshall. He was brought to trial with the other conspirators in May and sentenced to death. The sentence was, however, commuted to transportation for life and ultimately he was allowed to remain in the Iraq. MUHAMMAD ‘ALI BEHBEHANI, HAjI RAlS AL TUJjAR. See Rais al Tujjar.

The populace refused consent. ‘Ali sent some tribesmen, who were with him, to Hillah, asking the leading men to come out under safe conduct. They did so and were seized. The town was then occupied and much damage was done. A number of leading citizens, were hanged and their women carried off. Saiyid Muhammad ‘Ali was imprisoned in the house of Saiyid ‘Abdul Salam ibn Ibrahim and narrowly escaped with his life. He welcomed our arrival. Although he has declined to accept an official position as such from the Government, he has rendered great service and wields a great influence among the townspeople, who cheer fully agree to refer their disputes to him in all cases involving Shi'ah status. He is a part owner of considerable estates both in the Hillah and Hindiyah districts. Openminded ; he has consistently rendered us every possible assistance. He is heartily against the idea of Arab Government or an Arab Amir and has carried the town with him. MUHAMMAD ‘ALI IBN JAWWAD AGHA. Merchant. Town agent in ‘Amarah for Shaikh Salman of the Azairij.

Claims among other things, that he is much discussed in London. Typical of the more grotesque type of divine. Age about 62.77 MUHAMMAD ‘ALI IBN SAIYID YAHYA SARRAF. Of Karbala. Aged 27. His father was a successful Sarraf and at his death left money for the construction of the gate of the Mosque by his shop, dhe son, Muhammad { Ali, is also a Sarraf and enjoys universal trust. MUHAMMAD AMIN IBN SUWAIDAN. Of Qarnabit, Ba'qubah district. Means well, but has not much authority. Is well spoken of by L.P.O. MUHAMMAD IBN ‘ARAIBI PASHA. Albu Muhammad. About a year before our occupation of ‘Amarah, he and Tahir al Hatim, q.v., invaded and occupied the Khasaf tract of the Bahathah estate farmed by the Sudan {see Mahud ibn ‘Ajil). ‘Araibi, in 1916, promised to make his son evacuate it, and this was done. Succeeded to Chahalah Muqata'ah in December, 1917, on the death of ‘Araibi. Entirely under the bad and obstinate influence of Muhsin ibn Haji Habib, his chief secretary. Lackadaisical, without initiative, and has little personality. ‘Araibi Pasha was the most powerful of the Albu Muhammad shaikhs. Nephew of the old Shaikh Saihud, and cousin of Falih and Hatim. A friend of the Shaikh of Muhammarah. He was taken as a prisoner to Constantinople some years before the war, and spent a long time at Salonika and Uskub. He married a Turkish wife, who was the mother of his second son. His mother was a Bahadil, who had great influence with that tribe. He joined the Turks in the early part of 1915, but he and his nephew Majid were accused of being traitors and were sent away from Hilmi’s force. He corresponded with us through the Shaikh of Muhammarah, and took an early opportunity of making submission. MUHAMMAD IBN BADR. Son of Badr Abu Hasnah, Shaikh of Albu Nashi, ‘Afaj, Diwaniyah district. He runs the tribe lor his father, who is very old. An excellent shaikh. MUHAMMAD BAQIR, QAlD. See Muhammad Ja'far.

While in Baghdad a British officer pushed against him in the street and knocked him down. He complained to the Political Officer, and shortly afterwards resigned his work on the review and returned to Najaf. He was an intimate personal friend of Khaiyun al ‘Ubaid, and it was through his mediation that Khaiyun was reconciled to the Turks at the beginning of the war. MUHAMMAD AL SHAIKH DAUD. Of ‘Amarah. Arrested by order of G.H.Q., January, 1918. MUHAMMAD BECx DILO. Lives at Kahriz, near Khaniqin. Chief of the Dilo of Khaniqin. Employed by British Government as head of irregular horse on north part of province. A man of considerable influence, and good fighter, but very avaricious and of a sulky disposition. Not very easy to manage. Displayed considerable courage and ability in the difficult period of autumn, 1917, and preserved Khaniqin from a great deal of oppression by the Turks. He is cousin of Khurshid Beg Dilo, who has been fighting against us. The two are the last remnant of the old family of Dilo Pashas, once powerful in the Qarah Dagh district. They are on bad terms. MUHAMMAD AGHA IBN HAjI ELYAS. Government agent at Qazani. He has governed Qazani with ability since the fall of Baghdad and is much respected there. He is thoroughly trustworthy, and is very usefu in all dealings with the Arab tribes in the south of the Mandali district. MUHAMMAD AL FIRM. Shaikh of the Firidah section of the Harb. Most of the sections are in the Hijaz, but Muhammad has always been a man of Ibn Rashid s. He was with him in the spring of 1916 in the desert outside Zubair, but when the Amir returned to Hail the Harb made overtures to Dhari Ibn Tuwalah. In August they were at Chabdah with Dha ar al Burazi of the Juhaish (Aslam).78 MUHAMMAD HABlB, SHAIKH. Kirkuk district, Kurd of the Talabani family, Kirkuk branch. Until recently he lived in Kirkuk, where he was proprietor of Takiyah and a man of religion In 1918 moved out to his estate at Hasan, near Lailan, and is official Shaikh of that Talabani area, including a great part of the Qarah Hasan tribes.

Shaikh of Albu Darraj, farmed Qassat al Sharqi, Kumait, Jazrah and Shaihaniyah. Joined the Turks, came in July, 1915, and was given a free pardon. Joined the Turks again at the end of July, when they came down to Fulaifilah and was expelled by us. Mutashshar was made shaikh and the farms were divided between him, Shia' ibn Fa'al and Sahar ibn Husain. For a short time Muhammad’s step-mother Fitnah, sister of Falih ibn Saihud, was recognized as ruler of the Albu Darraj. After the fall of Kut he attempted to make an advance into the Albu Darraj Muqata'ah, and assembled a force in Bughailat which dispersed after a week or two. He came in finally in the summer of 1917, and is now living on a piece of land given him by Shawwai in the ‘Azairij Muqata’ah. He is better class than the other Albu Darraj shaikhs, and we should probably have to fall back on him if Mutashshar failed, but they would not combine well in the Muqata'ah. MUHAMMAD IBN HUSAIN, HAJI. Shaikh of the Fuhud (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Bani Khaiqan). Draws a subsidy of Rs. 75 a month. Pro-British, of strong character ; has been consistently friendly since the occupation and has incurred thereby many enemies. Mizhir Pasha tried to destroy his influence with the tribe but failed.

His brother Muhammad Taqi, is respected in Tehran. MUHAMMAD IBN HUSAIN THAMIR. Shaikh of Albu Hashmah, Balad district, an important tribe. Son of the Shaikh who was deported in July, 1918. Has had rather a difficult position to fill and, considering a things, has done very well. As a reward for his good behaviour, he was given Rs. 500 in 1918. He is badly off as he receives little or nothing from his tribesmen, although the tribes consist of over 250 houses. His tents adjoin the ‘Akab Camp and in consequence leavy demands are made on him for labour, which he has supplied well up to demand. MUHAMMAD AL SHAIKH jABIR. Was a turjman in the office of the A.P.O. Nasiriyah. His father was Secretary to Nasir Pasha al Sa'dun and Muhammad himself was Secretary to ‘Ajaimi for 3 years and did not get on with him, for which reason he has a grudge against the Sa'dun. He went to Rev. Mr. van Ess for education and embraced Christianity, at any rate for a time. At Nasiriyah he is known as a Mahommadan. He is unpopular with the tribesmen ; no manners ; jealous of the Hamdani house. MUHAMMAD JA'FAR, OAlD. He and Qaid Muhammad Baqir and Qaid Husain are brothers of Oaid Haiyat Khan, q.v. They have been into Amarah several times, mainly to obtain passes for the export of goods to Pusht-i-Kuh, and are frequently in trouble with the police for smuggling. MUHAMMAD AL JARRAD. Shaikh of the Banwah tribe, Shammar Toqah, ‘Aziziyah district, 60 Bait. Good reputation but little influence, has acted as crop estimator for revenue. Has only a small following and not much cultivation, but tribe has given no trouble. MUHAMMAD AL jARULLAH. Of the Ahl Kut (Muntafiq, Bani Malik), a nephew of Shaikh Chuwaiyid, rules a third of the tribe, but submits to Chuwaiyid’s authority in important matters. Friendly from the first, keeps his tribe in capital order ; with Chuwaiyid did very excellent work on the Suq-Nasiriyah road. The Ahl Kut are a good tribe. MUHAMMAD AL JAWWAD IBN HAjI ‘ABBAS. Has the right of collecting ‘uqr in Qarnabit, Ba'qubah district. Other inhabitants naturally dislike paying. MUHAMMAD IBN HAjI KADHIM. Secretary to Thamir Beg ibn Sa'dun, Suq al Shuyukh district. A man of about 25, pleasant mannered, quick witted, has been of considerable use to us in arranging for bund building, etc. His family belong to the Khaza'il; they entered into the service of Sa'dun Pasha, and live at Umm al Battush with Thamir. MUHAMMAD KADHIM AL TABATABAl AL YAZDI, SAIYID. Of Najaf. The greatest Shi'ah Mujtahid of the day, and of paramount influence throughout the whole of Shi'ah Islam. His sole possible rival is the aged Mirza Muhammad Taqi Shirazi of Samarra, who has possibly as many followers in Persia, but whose influence can never equal that of Saiyid Kadhim’s, for the simple reason that the latter is a Saiyid. It is remarkable that in Persia M. Muhammad Taqi’s influence is entirely among the higher classes, Yazdi’s among the common people. Saiyid Kadhim is extremely aged, but of vigorous intellect, great learning, and of very pleasing manner. His habits are simple. He is exceptionally broad-minded, and to those whom he knows well and trusts he will give invaluable advice and candid opinions. He will not commit himself to writing, and no attempt should ever be made to make him do so. He will certainly refuse, and it must be remembered that the power of such a man lies in his open neutrality and disassociation from political affairs. Should he abandon this attitude, his influence will deteriorate and his value will diminish. He is at heart pro-British and very anti-Turk. Since the deposition of Muhammad 'Ali Shah, when verbally, though not in writing, he expressed disapprobation of the Constitutionalists, he has never taken any part in politics, and has even ceased entirely to corresp'ond with the Persian Government. Any attempt to make him do this is foredoomed to failure. He does not even answer requests80 for advice sent to him by the Persian Government, and undoubtedly at heart is a hater of the Constitutionalists and a staunch royalist. , - ! ^ His remark in 1917 to Colonel Stokes was characteristic, when on the latter saying that he was in Persia at the time of the Constitution, he replied, “ Yes, when Persia began to go back.” His judgment on a Sharah case is final, but he will not give a decision against the decision of such a man as M. Muhammad 1 aqi. If a Shi ah Court is established in Baghdad it must be remembered that Shi‘ahs have the light, which they will certainly exercise, of appeal to the great Mujtahids. Saiyid Kadhim distributes yearly at least one hundred thousand pounds in charity from moneys which are supplied to him from Shi ahs of all countries, but mainly from Persia. (He died in the summer of 1919.) MUHAMMAD KARIM. Badrah district. Most important member of Haji Fumaili family (section of the Malik Sha'iyah tribe), which has settled at Zorbatiyah. Capable merchant. Much respected and thoroughly loyal. MUHAMMAD KARIM AGHA. Of Ibrahim Khanji, Kifri district. Chief of the northern section of the Zanganah tribe. Has a fighting reputation, but though feared by his tribes men is not liked. His strength keeps safe the Ibrahim Khanji road to Sulaimaniyah from Kifri. MUHAMMAD KHAjAH, HAJI. Member of an influential family at Lingah. For years styled himself, without any warrant, Turkish Consul at Lingah, even after the charge of Turkish interests in the Gulf had been entrusted to the British Residency at Bushire. In January, 1915, the two guards stationed before his house were removed at the instance of the British Consul. Muhammad Khajah sent an inflammatory telegram to the Turkish Ambassador at Teheran saying that the Persian Governor of Bushire was acting in British interests. In February, 1915, Muhammad’s brother, Salim Khajah, sent him word from Baghdad that he had been appointed Turkish Consul at Tehran, and would secure the recognition of Muhammad as Consul at Lingah. The latter was busy circulating Jihad notices and false war news supplied by the Turks. Pressure exerted at Tehran prevented his appointment as Consul, but as delay occurred in his ejection we occupied his house in January, 1916, and lowered the Turkish flag which he was still flying. The family were bound over to take no further part in politics. MUHAMMAD .IBN SAIYID KHALAF, SAIYID. Appointed Rais al Baladiyah of Majar Kabir and chief of Shabanahs, ‘Amarah district, in September, 1918. Formerly working as clerk in A.P.O.’s office in Qal'at Salih. Aged 23. A most fearless, untiring and loyal worker, with abundant self-confidence. Shows exceptional promise and organising ability. Tall and of slight build. He is now Arab Assistant to the P.O. ‘Amarah.

Is acknowledged as the head Shaikh of the . ujamma Not so long ago was a noted freebooter, but since he has taken to cultivation has amassed comparative wealth, and is now an upholder of law and order.81 He is a very popular sarkal, and the number of his fallahs increases monthly He receives a percentage of crops from the majority of charad owners. Is influential and helpful to Government, but will not accept responsibility for controlling the actions of other sections of the Mujaroma'.. MUHAMMAD AL MADHI ABU RUS. ‘Aqaih, lives with the ‘Anizah.

SAIYID MAHDI, BAHR AL ‘ULUM Taqi I Hasan Muhammad Mahdi Jawwad Muhammad Habib MUHAMMAD AL HAjI MUHAISIN. Of Diwaniyah. An interesting scoundrel. Was a mujahid under Sabri Beg at Hai Town in 1916. When the Turks retired from Diwaniyah, took charge of affairs and levied taxes. Incidentally he and his followers committed great excesses. Was appointed Police Commandant by Salih al Milli, our Government Agent in 1917, presumably to conciliate him. An unwise choice. On appointment of a British A.P.O.,could not brook restriction on his self-assumed authority. Known to have been connected with Najaf insurgents just before riots of 1918, and believed to have sent them arms. Deported to India, June, 1918. Would make an excellent Arab officer if he could keep straight. (See Haji Hamzah ibn Muhaisin.) MUHAMMAD IBN MUHAMMAD ‘ALI KHUNSAHI, SHAIKH. Of Najaf. An ‘alim and a preacher, pro-British.

Paramount shaikh of Sarraj Section of Rabi'ah ; son of Qassab, q.v. } now in Basrah ; a man of about 32 years of age, chiefly interested in his lands, seems very loyal to Government, and always does his best to please. He was put into his position by us when Qassab failed to make submission. This is possibly due to some extent to his somewhat equivocal position with regard to his father. He has little political ambition and is a good type of landholder and tribal shaikh and is likely to do well. MUHAMMAD AL RAHABI. Cultivates a considerable amount of land from Mahrut and Khorasan canals, Ba qubah district. Has considerable influence. MUHAMMAD AL RASHID. Son of Rashid, the previous head of the Juhaish (prior to Ajil) and cousin of Ajil. A boy of 12, intelligent and well-mannered. 'Ajil carried him off when he joined the Turks in February, 1918, but in October Muhammad applied for a safe conduct from the Civil Commissioner and permission to return to his lands in the Hillah district. (1705) M82 The safe conduct was granted him, but he was told that for the time he should remain at Suwairah where he is being educated. He has been granted a subsistence allowance of Rs. 300 per month. The question of his return to Hillah district will be considered later. MUHAMMAD RAUF AL JAUHAR. One of the leading merchants of luwairij. Commands a considerable amount of influence among the mercantile community. Owns land in Manfahan. MUHAMMAD RIDHA IBN MUHAMMAD TAQI MIRZA. Son of the great Mujtahid, with whom he has much influence. A bigoted Moslem and anti-British He was at the bottom of intrigues in January, 1919, to secure an inde pendent Arab State. An attempt was made by the ‘Ulama to intimidate all adverse to this idea by telling them that none but an infidel could desire any but Mohammadan Government. A friend of Muhammad Ridha Shabibi, q.v. MUHAMMAD RIDHA SHABlBL Of Najaf. A man of striking personality, great eloquence and remarkable literary gifts. After the occupation he showed himself extremely friendly, and was recommended by Capt. Marshall as correspondent for our vernacular paper, Al ‘Arab. In September, 1918, came to Kadhimain and was offered editorship of a fortnightly review under auspices. He accepted, but returned to Najaf on pretext of private affairs, leaving his brother, Muhammad Baqir, q.v., in charge of the paper. He never came back, and two months later both brothers resigned editorship. He had a small personal grievance relating to a book of his which was in the Press at the time of our occupation and was seized, with the printing press, by the Hostile Trading Department. Parts of the book were lost, and he received compensation which he considered insufficient. This would not seem enough to account for the anti-British attitude he adopted on his return to Najaf. In January, 1919, after a madhbatah favourable to the continuance of British administration had been agreed upon, he instituted a violent agitation to oppose it, and issued a declaration in favour of complete Arab independence in Mesopotamia. MUHAMMAD IBN RUSTAM, QAlD. Of the Dinarwand tribe, Pusht-i-Kuh. Related to the Chief, Qaid Haiyat Khan. MUHAMMAD SADIQ TABATABAI.

Head of half the Karkhiyah, Ba'qubah district, and unfriendly to Shaikh Ibrahim, q.v. A good cultivator. MUHAMMAD SATD IBN SAIYID ‘ABDUL KARIM, SAIYID. Born about 1857. Originally a townsman of Baghdad. Came to Radhwaniyah in Fallujah district some 34 years ago and cultivated there for 25 years. For the last six years he has resided in Fallujah. Wealthy, but keeps open house in Fallujah on a lavish scale and spends all he makes. Knows all the tribes and Shaikhs intimately, and is on friendly terms with them. Is strongly pro-British, and is well known and respected throughout Fallujah district. He is a genial, stout old man, whose influence is all to our good. The value of this is apparent, since every tribesman of high or low degree visiting Fallujah can generally be found enjoying the free hospitality of Muhammad Sa'id’s house. MUHAMMAD SATD AL ‘AJINAH. Of Najaf, Buraq quarter. Head of the family, who are respectable merchants. MUHAMMAD SAIHUD IBN HABlB AL AMIR. Paramount shaikh of the B. Rabi'ah.

MUHAMMAD SHAHBANDAR. Confidential Agent of Muhammad ‘Ali Kammunah.

MUHAMMAD AL SHIBLI. Shaikh of the Khazraj, Shutaitah, Balad district. A thieving lot. Muhammad is a poor specimen, he has not even the reputation of being a good thief, and is quite unable to control his tribe. MUHAMMAD SHU'AIBI. Of Basrah. A Najdi by origin, merchant as well as landowner. Friendly to us r not a bad fellow. Very straight. Considerably ruffled at first by being turned out of his house at Qardalan to make room for the Marin family when they were obliged to give up their own house on the river for hospital purposes.

His son ‘Abdullah has been appointed in his place. MUHAMMARAH, SHAIKH OF. See Khaz'al Khan. MUHAN IBN YUSUF AL KHAIRULLAH. Paramount Shaikh of the Humaid Confederation (Ajwad, Muntafiq) ; succeeded to the position in February, 1918, on the assassination of his father. Yusuf al Khairullah was the outstanding figure on the Gharraf in recent years. He owed his position entirely to his ability as a military leader, but he was also a strong administrator. His death, which occurred soon after he had made submission, was a great loss to us. Muhan is exceptionally capable, and stepped into his father’s place without any opposition. He refuses to take fasl for his father’s murder from the Khuwailid, a tribe which follows the Shuwailat, a constituent of the Humaid. MUHI UD DIN, SAIYID. Priest at Balad Ruz.

Pro-Turkish at heart, and was suspected of complicity in a plot to murder the P.O’s of the Shamiyah in February, 1918, though there was no proof against him. A shrewd business man. The family moved up from Hasa about 200 years ago, they own land at Al Hillah, Chamchah, as well as in Ghammas and on the Shatt. MUHSIN AL ‘ARS, HAjI. Merchant, brother of Haji ‘Ali. Implicated very largely in the fortunes of the Sudan Estate. His property was confiscated by the Turks on account of arrears. The matter will be considered after the war. MUHSIN IBN HAJI HABIB, MULLA. Secretary to Muhammad ibn ‘Araibi. The management of the Chahalah estate is said to be entirely in his hands. His influence is not a good one. Untrustworthy. A man of strong character, and from the point of view of satisfying Government demands for grain, etc., of undoubted value. He believes in strong methods with sarkals and fallahs. Hence, no doubt, his success. Indispensable to the effeminate Muhammad. The com bination of the two is useful, and as Mulla Muhsin has been threatened with explusion from the district if he offends the canons of ordinary justice he is probably behaving himself. MUHSIN AL MUHAMMAD YASIN. Son of the former Shaikh of the Maiyah (B. Rabi ah) on the left bank of Gharraf below Hai, and brother of the present Shaikh, ‘Abdullah. A young man of about 26, less ambitious and capable than his brother, but active and energetic in the management of his estates and tribes. He is completely led by his brother, and at present is not alto gether satisfactory. Left alone, however, he would be content to look after his lands and be quite a satisfactory Shaikh. MUHSIN IBN NAJM. See ‘Abdullah al Haji Hammadi. f MUHSIN QAZWlNI, SAIYID. Head of the Qazwini family in Najaf. His brother, Saiyid Muhammad, ‘Ah of Hillah, and his uncle, Saiyid Hadi, of Hindiyah, are well known and influential. MUHSIN SHALLASH, HAjI. Of Najaf, Buraq quarter. The richest financier and invaluable work during the blockade. A man of great acumen and ^ f He can be relied upon to give sound advice, and to be of great assistance in the matter o municipal improvements and projects. He is the Manager o e ^ q and has his finger in every pie. In political matters e is, , other. He very naturally, in matters which may affect his own poc e , o J f interests there should, therefore, be treated with considerable care as owing to hls ^ are ve^y few matters which do not affect him and it is valuable to find out what his interests may be in any particular matter, before seeing im 1 • ™ ^ • His brother, Haji Rfiuf, is able, but entirely overshadowed by Hap Muhsm. 4UHSIN IBN SAIYID ‘UQLAH. . . ^ v Farmer under ‘Usman al Yasir and much respected m ‘'; e ^^ULSntenigence: His brother, Saiyid Muhammad, has a farm also, bu is ver y Michariyah refused They, in conju/ction with all the Albu M^ammad farmers onfte M.chanyah^re ^ to take up their leases for the rice season of 1917, &amp; the irrigation had any probability of success.86 MUJBIL AL FARA'UN. Head of the Fatlah tribe in the Mishkhab on the right bank of over Shamiyah division He succeeded his brother Mubdir, who died m September 1918. Mizhir (q. v .) is the elder brother, but his mental incapacity made him unsuitable for the position. Mubdir was one of the best-known men on the Euphrates, was frequently employed by the Turks as an unofficial intelligence officer, and for a short time represented the Shamiyah on the Wilayat Council. He was very useful to us immediately after the occupation. Mujbil is a fairly honest and not too intelligent man who is played upon by the astuter ‘Abdul Wahid, his nephew. MUJBIL IBN FALIH SAIHUD. See Saihud, Khuwaibit ibn Falih. MUKHAILIF AL SAIYID. Shaikh of the Shuwaifi tribe, 150 Bait, Shammar Tdqah, ‘Aziziyah district. Very little influence and unreliable. Has a good deal of internal trouble with his tribes, who do not obey him properly. MUKHIF IBN MUHAMMAD, HAJI. Lormerly paramount Shaikh of ‘Afaj, a position he wrested from the hereditary Shaikh by shutting off the water supply and by judicious use of his wealth with Turkish officials. On learning that certain objectionable dealings with Revenue officials had become known, tendered his resignation in May, 1918. It was accepted, and the hereditary Shaikh, Mandhur al ‘Abdullah, reinstated by request of the tribes. Haji Mukhif continued to intrigue, but made no headway. Appears to be now resigned to his position. Very wealthy merchant, and owns valuable Tapu estate on the Dagharah, and property in Kadhimain. Very reserved manner, an inveterate intriguer. Extremely unpopular with local Shaikhs, especially those of ‘Afaj, whom he oppressed. MUKHLIF IBN HUSAIN QARNUS. Head Shaikh of the Dasat, Juwaisat, Balad district. Of little consequence, but seems to keep his tribe in order. MUNIYAH IBN HASAN. Rais al Baladiyah at Halfayah on the Musharrah, in the Sawa'ad Muqata'ah. A very capable, useful and honest man. He has many enemies in Halfiyah and at one time was arrested to answer a charge preferred against him of communicating with Turks. He how ever completely disproved the charge in question, which turned out to be a malicious intrigue against him. The parties who organised the intrigue were severely punished and Muniyah was reinstated. MUQOTAR, SAIYID HADE Of Shinafiyah, land-owning Saiyid. Six generations back the father of Muqotar, Shochah, founded Lamlun on the Shatt al Hillah. That branch of the river having con siderably diminished, Muqdtar moved to the neighbourhood of the present Shinafiyah, where they now own very large properties. Saiyid Hadi lives at Shinafiyah. The Muqotar enjoyed the favour of the Ottoman Government and were actively helpful to the Turks until we established effective control over the Middle Euphrates in November, 1917. They then made submission, in October, 1917, promising to serve us as loyally as they had served their late rulers, but Saiyid Hadi was found to be in communication with ‘Ajaimi al Sa dun in December, and though his letter of that date was overlooked, his great influence m Shmafiyah was reported to be covertly against us. He and his nephew, Saiyid Husain {q.v.), were deported to India as civilian prisoners of war, 1st class, in Tuly, 1918. He was implicated in all the Najaf disturbances of 1917-1918. MUQOTAR, HUSAIN, SAIYID. Owns considerable land in the south of the Shu'bat Ghammas, Shamiyah division, and is agen or a uqotar lands. Shi ah, age about 34. An excellent cultivator, and very shrewd business man. Somewhat given to intrigue. His uncle, Saiyid Hadi (q.v.), is known n 0 m e u+i but x hls own complicity in Turkish intrigue is less certain. He would be re P lace for agricultural work. Nevertheless, both he and Saiyid Hadi being suspected of intriguing with Ajaimi al Sa'dun, they were interned in India in July, 1918. MUQOTAR. See Ahmad al Saiyid ‘Alwan.87 MURAD AL KHALIL. The recognised head Shaikh of the Jubur and a member of the Tribal Madis at Hillah Murad is a man of probably 50 years of age, or more. He is possessed of considerable common-sense, and has been successful up to date in controlling his tribesmen. His section is the Juwazriyah. He has only recently been appointed paramount Shaikh and he has two powerful rivals for the Shaikhship in Farhan al Dabbi and Dohan al Hasan, who may be expected to intrigue against Murad with a view to undermining his influence with the tribe and his position with Ciovernment, given an opportunity to do so. His tribe were a turbu lent lot; the Turks could do little with them. He is controlling his tribe better than might have been expected in view of this fact. He got his clearances of canals done very promptly this year (1918). MURTADHA IBN SAIYID ‘ALI AGHA DAMAD TABRIZI, SAIYID. Of Najaf. Saiyid ‘Ali died at the beginning of 1918. He was prominently pro-Turkish and preached the Jihad against us. His son is a doubtful character. MURTADHA KILIDDAR IBN SAIYID MUSTAFA KILlDDAR IBN SAIYID HUSAIN KILIDDAR AL ‘ABBAS, SAIYID. Of Karbala. Comes of the Dhiya ud Din family. Aged 50. His grandfather, Saiyid Husain, was appointed Kiliddar by Nasr ud Din Shah when the latter visited Karbala. Saiyid Mustafa succeeded Saiyid Husain, and on his death his son, Saiyid Murtadha, succeeded in getting the post after a short interim by the payment of a heavy bribe. He has property at Musaiyib and elsewhere. MUSA, MULLA. Mukhtar of Sindiyah, Daltawah district. Very energetic, and quite a good Mukhtar. Rather clever, and though a responsible person, should not be trusted too far. MUSA IBN ‘ALL Shaikh of the Bait Zamil which with the Korjah make up the Sawa'ad. See Thamir ibn Shia‘. MUSA AL ‘ATIYAH, HAjI. Of Basrah. The leading grain merchant in ‘Ashar, well-known man. He egged on the Arabs to fight against us when we first landed, but owning a large property in ‘Ashar (part'of which was waqf) he became nominally our friend. MUSA EFFENDI IBN MA'RUF EFFENDI. A Turk who practically ruled Mandali for many years. He was a tyrant of the worst sort, and fled with the Turks in September, 1917. MUSA IBN MUHAMMAD. Sawa'ad. Head of the Bait Zamil which with the Korjah make up the tribe. His behaviour has been generally satisfactory. The Sawa'ad farm the Musharrah estate. A man of 60, unsophisticated of the old style, has paid up all his revenue and furnished the labour required of him. Like all the bigger Sawa'ad Shaikhs, an excellent fellow. MtSA IBN SALMAN. Bani Lam. Chief of the Dhahir section of the Bait Jindil. Brought in by A.P.O. ‘Ali Gharbi in September, 1916, and lodged with Juwi. He sent for his followers not large in number—but it was thought improbable that they would come in. Thaqil was appointed to Musa’s position in the tribe. MtJSA IBN YUSUF-AL-MANSUR, SHAIKH. The Shaikh of Muhammarah’s cousin. Age about 32 years. He is the Shaikh s representative at ‘Abadan, where he has been for the past years. He is a capable man, and well liked by the Shaikh and Europeans. MUSA IBN ZUBAIR AGHA Of Mushairiyah, Daltawah district. Of wide influence, but not spoken of highly. MUSALLAM IBN QADARAH. Merchant. Implicated in Sudan Estate matters, at one time having been their security to Government. Musallam is untrustworthy and dishonest, an is a no e mischief-maker and intriguer.MUSARHAD IBN MANAHI. , . a qv&gt; 't Vi f +1 c * v Owns from Mahdi to Abu Kallak, L. Bank of Tigris A Shaikh of the Sad an part of the Too ah. He came in to see Sir P. Cox in October, 1915 and was useful m obtaining about 80 camels for transport purposes for advance on Ctesiphon. On our second advance he lost no time in coming in. MUSHATTAT IBN KHALIFAH. , , . , . Albu Muhammad. Second son of Khalifah. He and his brothers Humud and Fahad live in the muqata'ah of their elder brother, Shaikh Majid. MUHSIN AL HARDAN. Dulaim Ramadi district. Son of Hardan al ‘Abdul Hamid, who is at present in India, Shaikh of the Albu ‘Aithah ; he controls various other sections, but has not the influence of his father. Such assistance as he gives is chiefly negative. He has no desire to court trouble, and he is rather eager to remain in ignorance of any misdeed of his tribes. Between 35 to 40 years of age, he can read and write, but not with ease, and always uses a clerk for all his correspondence. MUSHIR IBN MUHAMMAD, HAjI. Brother of Haji Mukhif, of Dagharah, Diwaniyah district, and equal partner with him in their Tapu estate. A wiser man than his brother. MUSHlR AL TUJJAR, HAJI. Eldest son of Haji Rais al Tujjar. Born about 1883. He travelled via India to Mecca in 1903. Like his father, is very pleasant and friendly to the British. He may succeed his father as the Shaikh’s Wazlr. MUSHRI, ‘ABDUL KARIM.

Appointed by the Ottoman Government Shaikh of Zubair after the murder of Khalid al ‘Aim in 1907. He was in the Shamiyah at the moment of the occupation of Basrah, and after the retreat of the Turks returned to Basrah. He was turned out by us imme diately before the battle of Shu'aibah. He fell foul of Saiyid Talib, as he disapproved of him, and to that extent was a friend of ‘Ajaimi. He was required to go and live at Kuwait, as Shaikh Ibrahim, whom we appointed to Zubair, believed that he was intriguing, but it is doubtful if he was. Now in Basrah. MUSLAT PASHA AL SALIH IBN MILHIM. Paramount Shaikh of the Jubur, on the Khabur. His fort is near Taban, on the Khabur. Many Armenians working for him. The Ottoman authorities treated him with respect. Nevertheless, he is anti-Turk and refused all military assistance. Befriended the refugees Faiz al Ghusain and Saiyid Husain Kashani on their way to Basrah. One of his nephews was at the Madrasat al ‘Ashair in Constantinople, was subsequently Qaim- maqam of Hillah, and now occupies an official post at Baghdad. The Jubur are half- settled cultivators. Another nephew, ‘Ali ibn Sultan, on the Khabur, could easily be won over. Befriended deserters. Approves of the Sharif’s rising. MUSLIH, MULLA. Of Mushairiyah, Daltawah district. Is often singled out as a good man. MUSTAFA, AGHA. Of Hillah. Has given two good houses as billets. Houses in good repair. He sub scribed to General Maude s Memorial b und ; he seems to be a good class man, and fairly truthful. MUSTAFA, HAjI. Born in Erzerum, pure Turkish blood. A self-made man, he used to be Katib to the Persian Consul at Basrah at a lira a month. Unscrupulous, well educated, was powerful in Turkish days. He was decorated with the 3rd class of the Majidiyah in August, 1914. Agent of the Shaikh of Muhammarah in Basrah. He has been useful to us m that capacity. M as one of the signatories of the telegram to King George after t le occupation. Inclined to think latterly that he is not treated with sufficient considera tion. Something of a rogue.89 MUSTAFA PASHA. Brother of Khansah Khanum, widow of Ibrahim Pasha Milli, but not on good terms with her sons, Khalil and IsmaTl. Lives near Wiransheher. Has about 1,000 good fighting men, Kurds ; himself an Arab. MUSTAFA AGHA IBN ‘ABDUL QADIR. Of ‘Amarah. Arrested by order of G.H.Q., January, 1918. MUSTAFA EFFENDI BAIYAT. Formerly agent at Sairah for Mac Andrew Forbes &amp; Co. After occupation acted efficiently as Rais Baladiyah, Sairah, but services dispensed with owing to lack of funds. Has extensive local knowledge of Jazirah tribes. MUSTAFA PASHA BAJLAN. Present head of the old family of Bajlan Pashas of Zohab. Lives at Khaniqin ; owns much land in and around Qasr-i-Shirin. Violently anti-Turkish and pro-British ; brought himself into trouble about 1910 by openly advocating the British occupation of ‘Arabistan and Southern Kurdistan. Best informed man living on local politics and geography. On our first advance up the Diyalah he wrote to us, but the letter fell into the hands of ‘Ali Ihsan. After the occupation of Baghdad he was instructed by us to keep order in the town and district of Khaniqin. Suffered severely at the hands of the Russians in April and May, 1917, and finally took refuge with us at Baghdad. His property was confiscated by the Turks. He returned to Khaniqin in July, 1918. MUSTAFA SHAIBANLI. A wealthy and respected townsman of Hillah. Head of the merchant class, more or less. An old man, of nice appearance. MUSTAFA IBN SULAIMAN AGHA. A Kurd from Kirkuk district, now living with Falih Saihud. He was previously for many years Yuzbashi of river Shabanah between ‘Azair and Amarah. He made his submission in August, 1915, and since then he has been with Falih, who has guaranteed his good behaviour. Mustafa is a very capable man with a great reputation for shrewd ness and courage among the tribes, whom he knows inside out. He has repeatedly applied for a post under Government, but it was not considered advisable to employ him until Turkish influences were removed. MUTASHSHAR IBN FAISAL. MADHKUR Ghaith Faris Muhammad Ta‘al Husain Jodah Hattab-Fitnah Faisal Hashim Mutlaq Sahr Shatab Fa'al Jiri Muhammad Mutashshar Disbar (evicted) (35) Shah ‘Ali Hamdan Shunaiwir Shia' Mutashshar’s position was difficult, (1705) as most of his family do not recognise him, but N90 sided with Muhammad al Hattab and the Turks. Moreover, the greater part of his tribe was in the inaccessible borders of the Jazirah desert. Shia‘ ibn Fa'al is not on good terms with him. There is a dispute with the ‘Azairij about the Khuzainah and Hamish lands which are in the possession of Mutashshar’s uncle, Mutlaq ibn Husain, of whom he is very jealous. Mutlaq intrigued against Mutashshar with the latter’s brother-in-law, Shawwai of the Azairij. Another uncle, Hashim, holding the Jifjafah lands, is hostile to Mutashshar He is a man of 35, shifty, but bound to us by his own interests and useful to us undignified, with a strong sense of humour. The forces at his disposal in May, 1916, were 800 foot and 60 horse ; this was his own estimate in the proposed combine of himself, the Bani Lam Shaikhs, Shabib, Fahad Hasan and Falih, against the hostile combine of the Zubaid, Sarraj, Toqah, and the pro- Turk members of the Bait Jindil. His position is now strong with the tribe and he has induced sections to return from the Hai and fronq Kamandar. Frank in manner and takes an intelligent interest in worldly affairs. Turbulent disposition. Probably the only man able to hold this difficult tribe together and firmly pro-British, but the most unsatisfactory Shaikh in the ‘Amarah division. MUTLAQ AL ‘ABBAS. Shaikh of Albu Hasan, Balad district. A cheery soul, energetic and distinctlv pro- British. Shi'ah. He is perhaps not quite so innocent as he looks and owns acquaintance with the Kubaishat and other tribes not too friendly with the British. MUTLAQ AL ‘ADHAIB. , Shaikh of the ‘Arachii, Shammar Toqah, deserted by his tribe who live in the Ba qubah district; thoroughly bad character, has been imprisoned both by Turks district ^ ^ rdeaSed ° n P robation under a guarantee from Shammar Shaikhs, 'Aziziyah MUTLAQ IBN FARMAN. .

Shaikh of Ghawalbah, Balad district. A dignified old gentleman of stately appearance He undoubtedly exercises considerable influence in his tribe, but in what direction it is difficult to say. He is a sly customer and well practised in trimming his sails. See also ‘Ulaiwi al Mijran. NAIF AL ‘AJIL. Shaikh of Al Muhsin, Samawah district. The Al Muhsin are a family of Saiyids formerly paramount over the Bani Huchaim. They have now no authority except over their family section. Naif is a clever man, so clever that one is inclined to mistrust every- thijig he says and does. He lives in the Muntafiq country and has no lands of his own. nAif al dhaidAn. Head of the Tufail whose lands are on the right bank of the Hindiyah, between the Bani Hasan and the Fatlah. He is not a very satisfactory person and does not possess much influence over his sarkals. nAif al jaryAn. Brother of ‘Addai, q.v. Lives with the Albu Sultan in Hillah district. nAif al mashA. One of the leading Shaikhs of the Bani Sa'id (Muntafiq), Nasiriyah division. He is hand in glove with the principal Bani Sa‘id Shaikh,‘Ulaiwi al Marhij. NAJI, BAIT. Of Najaf, Buraq quarter. Large grain merchants, strongly suspected of trading with Ibn Rashid. NAJI AL ‘AUDAH. Rais of Mutairat (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Mujarrah). A prosperous, well-to-do Chief. Owns much land in his own right, having taken out Tapu sanads, hence keeps quiet as he is vulnerable ; cunning, professes to be very pro- British and has never given any trouble. Pays his revenue regularly. He has a good deal of property in the Shamiyah, west of Suq, where he grows rice and wheat. In November, 1916, was given £100 loan to help him to buy wheat for sowing, this being the first experiment of this kind in Suq. In Turkish times he used to persecute the large Sabaean community which lives in his lands, but has desisted since our occupation. He is of Bani Khaiqan stock, but is now allied to the Mujarrah confederation. Supplied us with many labourers during the autumn of 1916 for the deepening of the Ttaibiyah canal. nAji al hAji sAlih. Formerly a merchant of Diwaniyah ; of good family. Became a Mamur Shu'bah, 1918. A very energetic and promising official. 0 najm, saiyid. Nephew of ‘Abdul Latif, Shaikh of the ‘Abbud, and as anti-Turk as he. Khabur. On the NAJM IBN MULLA ‘ABDULLAH. Mudir of Kumait and non-tribal farmer of the Qassat al Gharbi Muqata'ah lying round Kumait. He has held it since 1910. His sub-farmers are tribal, mostly Sarraj and Bani Lam, and he has considerable difficulty with them ; he has shown much good-will in the management of the town of Kumait. On this account and because of worries caused by the war, his fees were reduced by £T800. Drinks heavily. Lias great influence with Mutashshar and is an enemy of Muhammad al Hattab, by whom he was imprisoned in August, 1915, before our first advance to Kut. After occupying Kumait we found it necessary to fall back temporarily, and the Turks with Muhammad al Hattab raided Kumait, captured Najm and released him only after mulcting him of considerable property, for which loss he has been duly compensated by us. He was originally a soap merchant in Baghdad and at one time was engaged in taking horses to Bombay. Age about 55. (1705) N 292 Assumes an open and straightforward manner. Jovial and hearty. Used continually to try to evade the blockade by winking at contraband goods passing through Kumait to the Hai. Quite amenable, when pressure was brought on him. Fraternises with British officers.

Of Basiah. A friend of Saiyid Talib through whose influence he was elected a deputy for Basrah. Drinks and gambles, ignorant and tyrannous. He was at one time a member of the C.U.P. and is now inclined towards the Turks on religious grounds, but would pro- bably suffer at their hands if they returned. The family was once wealthy, but have gambled away most of their property. A large house on the right bank of the river, a coup e of miles below Basrah, belongs to them. We have requisitioned it for a hospital. NA'MAH, MAHMUD, HAjI. Sunni of Basrah, employed in the Political office at Basrah for three years. He accepted the work because of his genuine desire to serve the British government as well as to be of use to his own country, and his social position made him valuable to us in the first years of the occupation. He went to Bombay in December, 1918, in order to improve his93 English, hoping on his return to receive an administrative post. An honest and a pleasant man, not abundantly endowed with brains. Not a decisive personality. He is strongly opposed to the idea of an Arab Government under an Amir. ~ 6 y NAQIB ZADAH OF BASRAH, SAIYID HASHIM. Nephew of the Naqib, the richest of that house and probably the best of them. He disliked Talib who systematically squeezed him. He is a good Muhammadan and has a reputation for generosity. Speaks some English, was member of the Majlis Idarah. Not a prominent man. Was nettled at not having the same position under us that he had under the Turks. Has lived a most retired life since our occupation. Never comes into Basrah, and holds aloof from the British community. NAQIB ZADAH OF BASRAH, SAIYID RAJAB. The present Naqib of Basrah. An old man of little intelligence- and no courage. Pro-English from of old and strongly anti-Turk. He was not on very good terms with his son Saiyid Talib, and disliked the latter’s extravagant expenditure, but feared him. Speaks and writes English and prides himself on the accomplishment. Spends a good deal of his time in Kuwait. NAQIB, ZADAH OF BASRAH, SAIYID TALIB. Saiyid Talib is the eldest son of the present Naqib of Basrah, Saiyid Rajab. The family are descendants of the great Muhammadan saint, Saiyid Ahmad al Rafai, whose tomb stands east of Hai town, and control extensive Waqf property. In 1899 Saiyid Talib was sent by his father on a mission to Constantinople to complain of the policy of the Wali r Hamdi Pasha, who was disliked both by the Naqib and by Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait. Saiyid Talib succeeded in effecting his removal and returned to Basrah in a cloud of glory. He secured the friendship of Saikh Khaz'al of Muhammarah by the timely murder in 1890 of ‘Abdullah Rawanduzi, an individual distasteful to the Shaikh, and from that time forward received a large yearly subsidy both from Kuwait and from Muhammarah. He surrounded himself with a bodyguard of cut-throats and scoundrels and with their aid dominated Basrah, levying blackmail on the rich and plundering all who refused to serve him. In 1905 Fakhri Pasha, a Wali of unusual determination, had him removed to Con stantinople where he imbibed new political ideas. When the C.U.P. came to power he came back to Basrah and posed as the leader of the new party, but his fellow-townsmen found means of getting rid of him by returning him as a Deputy to Constantinople. Finding that he could make no profit out of the C.U.P., he joined the more moderate reformers, and with them evolved the idea of the Hurr al Mu tadil or moderate Liberal movement, which wms the parent of the Young Arab party. He came back to Basrah, but this time in opposition to the C.U.P., and found his chief opponent in Sa‘dun Pasha, paramount chief of the Muntafiq confederation. Him he decoyed into the hands of the Turks in 1 , , c ‘Aloimi In 1Q19 rm thp anvir.p. of Kiamil Pasha, the figure-head of the Liberal party, at that time Grand Vizier, he resolved to seok tho mmnort of fhe English, and to that end he went to Egypt m 1912, where he saw ‘Abdul Rahman Sister d. childless 1874. L Saiyid Talib (from Mandali, succeeded his brother- in-law ‘Abdul Rahman). Saiyid Muhammad Sa'id (resigned, 1890, d. 1896). Saiyid Rajab, (appointed Naqib in 1890). Saivid Ahmad [d. 1904). 1 Saiyid Hashim Talib Yusuf Hamad.94 the C.U.P. He met this threat with his usual vigour and by his customary methods In June his adherents assassinated the Turkish Commandant in the heart of the town The Turkish authorities were effectually cowed, the Wall was dismissed and in August a programme of reforms was issued. But these steps did not satisfy the ambitions of Saiyid Talib. The Arab Committee, which was wholly in his hands, circulated an address amon°- the soldiers and the Tribes calling on all Arabs to throw off Turkish tyranny and declare the independence of the 'Iraq. Enver Bey, who was then in power, ordered the arrest of Talib, but the Wali reported that he was powerless to carry out these instructions, and in December Talib sent a second threatening address to Constantinople. Enver submitted to the force of circumstances. The Walis of Basrah and Baghdad were bidden to consult Talib in all matters, and a high order was conferred on him. Thereat he issued a manifesto saying that he would henceforth support Ottoman authority. In the spring of 1914 he was used by the Turkish Authorities to carry on negotiations with Ibn Sa'ud touching the latter’s position in the Hasa, a province from which Ibn Sa'ud had expelled the Turks in the previous year, and in August Tala'at informed the British Ambassador in Con stantinople that Talib was to be appointed Wali of Basrah. Secret instructions for his arrest had, however, been issued to the Wali of Baghdad, who, to this end, set out in October, 1914, with a considerable force, arriving in Basrah just after the outbreak of war with Great Britain. Saiyid Talib had got wind of his intentions and retired to Kuwait ostensibly with the purpose of completing the negotiations with Ibn Sa'ud. Just before the war he was negotiating through the intermediation of the Shaikh of Muhammarah with the British Authorities with a vjew to co-operating with us in the event of \rar between Great Britain and Turkey, but he put forward extravagant pretensions, and had not come down to any reasonable terms when war broke out. He had precipitately to expedite his departure for Najd, whence he went into a voluntary exile in India. Saiyid Talib is a man between 45 and 50, a heavy drinker and addicted to all the vices of the East. ^ His constitution has suffered from life-long indulgence in every form of excess and his restless energy has probably been to some extent diminished. In spite of in numerable crimes, he still retains among Muhammadan Arabs—especially among those who have not been brought into immediate contact with him—a high religious position as the descendant of a sacred house, but it is doubtful whether he would carry any weight as a political reformer except in exceedingly primitive communities. He has still the support of many of his former adherents in Basrah, but his reputation among the educated togo^to Egypt^n 0 ^^ 03 ^ 10617 ^ ° f perSOnal ac q uaintan ce.

He is about 45 years old, strong-willed and ambitious. His fatter Shabib, who was Shaikh before him, died about 20 years ago. NIMISH AL 'AZIZ. Head Shaikh of the BiPaij who are Beduin and camel owners ranging the Tazirah between the Baghdad-Hillah Road and the Shatt al Gharraf. In the winter time they are usually to be found m the neighbourhood of Dagharah and ‘Afaj, but in the spring they move up up towards the Hillah district, and at harvest time bring their camels into the cultivated areas, making arrangements with Sarkals and Mallaks to transport the grain from the threshing floors to the storing places. The same sections of the Bu'aii usually T? ‘ono 11116 Mu&lt; Jata‘ah s every year. This year (1918) Nimish was given an allowance of Rs. 300 per month while he was in the neighbourhood of Hillah, with a view to getting the best W'ork out of him and his camels. Nimish has not much control over his tribe, and he is still very much frightened and suspicious of Government authority. The Bu'aij do most of the transporting of grain from threshing floors to stores in the Dagharah district. NU'AIMI AL BAUD. Rais of the Hamahmah (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Mujarrah). ( A small quiet tribe, fairly law-abiding, living on the Abu Sha'athah Canal. Shaikh i\u aimi is a pleasant man, looks after his tribe well and is greatly respected among the other tribes for his honesty. Always in demand when there are any difficult inter-tribal boundary disputes to be settled. A useful man, seems to be pro-British. NUGHAIMISH, HAjI. Of the Dawasir. His grandfather was called in by Nasir Pasha al Sa'dun to plant and cultivate the great Mu'amir estate near Fao, and was given by him a right of occupancy of a vague kind. For many years he was supported by Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait and Saiyid Talib of Basrah against the Sa'dun landlords (‘Abdullah Falih, etc.), and refused to give them their share of the produce. About 1911, when Saiyid Talib wished to curry favour with the Sa'dun and bring them into the Arab Confederacy, he and Shaikh Mubarak turned against Nughaimish and helped the Turks to evict him. Later, when the Sa'dun failed to join the Confederacy, Nughaimish was again taken into Saiyid Talib’s favour and restored to his former position. He was found by us in possession of Mu'amir when Ibrahim al Miz'il al Sa'dun and others of the Falih family made submission after Shu'aibah. We had no reason to turn him out as he had done nothing to annoy us, but as it seemed likely that the Muntafiq Shaikhs would want to go down to their property and quarrel with Nughaimish it was decided to let him remain in charge and deliver the shares through us. Nughaimish, however, failed to make good his undertakings and had to be ejected. He has now taken refuge with the Shaikh of Kuwait at Failakah Island. He had a large number of armed retainers. When in the good books of Shaikh Mubarak it is believed that he secretly transferred to him possession of a large slice of the Mu'amir estate. He is aged about 65. A hot-headed and thick-headed old man. His family, in charge of his son Thuwaini, are being paid a subsistence allowance from the estate pending examination of Nughaimish's claims and the title deeds of the Falih family. nujaidi AL jAsim. A well-to-do merchant of Nasiriyah, who owns much property. Pro-British—a bitter enemy of ‘Ajaimi who robbed him of much land by force. Was badly hit by us in 1916, when his garden south of Nasiriyah, opposite Gorringe Gate, was completely destroyed by our forces, on the excuse that some tribesmen made it their jumping-off place for an attack on our piquet line. Damage valued at Rs. 17,000 was done by us. Political Officer Nasiriyah, in 1918, put in an application for the restitution of his property so destroyed, and for the paying of compensation to the man. NtJR AL SAIYID 'AZIZ.

Inconse quence there is a strong party, viz., that of Salman al Qu'aiyid, always ready to seize any opportunity for intrigue against him.

With him came Thamir ibn Sa'dun ibn ‘Assaf ibn Salih and Paris ibn Badr ibn Sattam ibn Badr, both Al Sa'dun. SA'DtN, ‘ABDUL ‘API AL SULAIMAN. Of Hai. Came in in January, 1917. He has four sons, Bandar, q.v., Paris, Mishari and ‘Umar. He has been reinstated in some of his lands. SA'DtN, ‘ABDUL 'AZIZ IBN HUSAIN IBN MANStR. Property in Harthah, Qulyan, and on the Gharraf at al Buwaidhah in the hands of the ‘Umai'an (Al bu Salih) not far from Nasiriyah. His son Saif, a boy under 20, looks after the Harthah property. SA'DtN, ‘ABDUL ‘AZIZ AL RASHID. Near Suq. His son ‘Assaf was wounded a few days before the battle of Shu'aibah, taken prisoner and sent to India. ‘Abdul ‘Aziz came to Basrah in October, 1916, to make enquiries as to his whereabouts. A man of about 50 with a deep sword cut across his left cheek. Dignified and pleasant mannered. He cannot recover rents from the tribes who farm his lands near Suq, and asked us to advance him money on them. He has property in Harthah in the lands known as Oa'al Rashid, his estate being at the tail of the Mujai- dariyah and the Jirhan canals. He and Haji ‘Abdul ‘Ali al Rashid are the only Rashid left in the Oa‘. The rest of the land has passed into the hands of the heirs of Falih al Sa'dun. He and his humulah have property in common round ‘Akaikah and near Suq. (The Rashid are an offshoot of the Sa'dun springing from Rashid al Shabib. Shabib was the grandfather of Sa'dun and the great grandfather of Thamir, from whom the main branch known as Al Sa dun are descended.) ‘Abdul ‘Aziz and his brother ‘Abdullah have a strong family group one mile from Suq, where about 25 members of the family reside. They claim a wide extent of land there and have had many bitter fights with the Mujarrah and Bani Khaiqan tribesmen. All the Rashid clan have behaved well under our administration. SA'DUN, ‘ABDUL ‘AZIZ IBN SULAIMAN AL MANSUR. Cousin of Ajaimi, always well inclined to us. After the occupation of Basrah he and his brother wrote to the C.P.O., but they did not at that time come in. The Turks forced them to fight at Shu aibah ; after the battle they returned to Suq, wrote to us and came in. They stayed some time in Basrah and went back to Suq and Nasiriyah. Their property is between Nasiriyah and Shatrah. It is now occupied by the Khafajah. Their father Sulaiman frequently attempted in Turkish times to get into relations with the English. Abdul Aziz has gardens in Nasiriyah which were much ruined by our troops SA'DUN, ‘ABDUL HADI AL RASHID. A member of the Rashid clan, near Suq, in the group collected round ‘Abdul ‘Aziz al Rashid. Like his relation, Badr, he lives much in tents, roaming with his camels. A good type of Beduin Sa'dun.103 SA'DUN, ‘ABDUL KARIM BEG IBN FAHAD IBN ‘ALI IBN THAMIR. Eighth son of Fahad. Has property at Zuraiji, Salihiyah, Kut al Oawwam, Kut ai Na mah on the Shatt al Arab. Also at Umm al Sachach in the Albu Khalifah country (Hammar) and at ‘Ibadiyah where Maqtuf ibn Hasan of the Umm Sachach is his wakil. His brothers own lands on the Gharraf north of Hai town and live with their flocks in the Hamad. ‘Abdul Karim is a man of 35-40, pleasant-spoken and well educated. He was for many years in employment at Constantinople but resigned shortly after the Constitu tion. His brother, ‘Abdul Muhsin, and his son, Taufiq, are still there. He remained at Basrah after our occupation. His brother ‘Abdul Razzaq, q.v., is said by Mutlaq al Humud to be the best among the Sa'dun of to-day. SA'DUN, ‘ABDUL KARIM BEG IBN FALIH PASHA. Half brother of ‘Abdullah Beg ibn Falih to whom he is devoted. Son of a Circassian slave girl. Handsome, of prepossessing appearance, and a man of mark in the Muntafiq world. His usual occupation is looking after camels in the desert between the Tigris and the Euphrates. He rarely comes into cities and is a regular Beduin. Was advanced money by Major Hamilton, Political Officer Nasiriyah, for the purchase of camels in August, 1915 ; certain of the camels were purchased, but a balance of about 5,000s. remained unadjusted. ‘Abdul Karim disappeared with ‘Abdullah when the latter left us and only submitted to us again when ‘Abdullah came in, in February, 1918. He has promised to pay up the balance of the camel purchase money which he owes. SA'DUN, ‘ABDUL RAZZAO. Shares with his brothers property on the Gharraf above Hai. Since the beginning of the war has been out on the Hamad near Hai with his flocks. Said by Shaikh Mutlaq al Humud al Sa'dun to be the best of Sa'dun clan. He supplied us with camels when we advanced to Kut. SA'DUN. ‘ABDULLAH BEG IBN FALIH PASHA. Leader of the house of Nasir as opposed to that of Mansur which is represented by Ajaimi Beg al Mansur. ‘Abdullah styles himself Amir al Muntafiq, and the majority of the Muntafiq look to him as the hereditary and rightful shaikh of the Muntafiq on account of his being the grandson of Nasir Pasha, the last great shaikh of all the Muntafiq Arabs. The minority look to ‘Aiaimi Beg as their present leader, but the latter cannot put forward anything like the claims of ‘Abdullah. Speaking generally ‘Aja.mi considers himself the head of the Muntafiq who reside on the right bank of the Euphrates, and Abdullah leader of those between the Tigris and Euphrates. ‘Abdullah is a tall man of fine appearance. About 30 years old, good looking, simple-minded and cheerful. A good evamnle of the best type of Arab. Very proud of his sharaf, declined a subsidy from the British Government Xn he made his submission (February, 1918) ( Remarkable for his personal generosity, and though his financial position was good before the war, he now possesses nothing to speak of One of the few Sa'dun who retain their hold over the affections of the tribesmen. A bitter enemy of ‘Ajaimi, not on good terms with Dhan Beg and Ibrahim Beg who fear ‘Abdullah’s rise to power under us. ^ ‘Abdullah surrendered to Sir George Gorringe, K.C.B., at Nasiriyah on its first capture in lulv 1915 but smarting under a fancied grievance, he never came m to us again, and throughout the summer o/lflie was in correspondence both with ' s ^'UandXwsh He lived alone on the Gharraf river, and studiously avoided seeing both lurk and Brit. . His property at Ma‘amir, Basrah, was sequestiate y us. SA'DUN, ‘ABDULLAH MANSUR AL. , x o r H Son of.

SA'DUN, ‘AJAIMI IBN SA'DUN. ,*• • • ibn S a‘dun The most virile member of the Sa'dun famll y ^ he U pj-q^itive and restless instinct who seems to be endowed more than his e ov ^ ^ faithlessness but no less famous for of the desert Arab. He is renowned f 'nbut he is very fickle, his personal bravery and resolution. He g largely to the lawless methods The present unpopularity of the Sa'dun with the tribes is due larg } and brutality of ‘Ajaimi and his father.104 Having squandered most of his patrimony and having no proprietary stake in the country, he has for years been a stormy petrel in the Euphrates districts of the Basrah Wilayat. In pre-war days his proclivities brought him periodically into conflict with the pro vincial Turkish authorities, and on these occasions he more than once made appeals both to the Basrah Consulate and the Bushire Residency for British protection or intervention. To such overtures no response could be given, and he retired dejected. He was thrown permanently on to the side of the C.U.P. by his hatred of Saiyid Talib (see Naqib Zadah of Basrah, Saiyid Talib), whom he never forgave for having decoyed his father Sa'dun into Turkish hands in 1911. In October, 1912, he attacked and robbed his cousin Mizyad (probably with the connivance of the Mutasarrif Farid Bey) of a very large sum and came into conflict with Mizyad’s brother, ‘Abdullah. The C.U.P. falling out of power in November, ‘Ajaimi was proclaimed an outlaw. In November he threatened to attack Basrah, but in 1914, the C.U.P. being again supreme, he appeared outside Basrah to support them against Talib. When the war broke out he took service with the Turks as a soldier of fortune, and was present with his following of about 250 sowars with the Turkish forces opposing our entry into ‘Iraq. He managed, however, to keep out of all active fighting, and when the Basrah force was defeated at Kut al Zain'and abandoned Basrah, ‘Ajaimi retired by the desert route to Nasiriyah. He then began to make specious overtures through friends for entering into relations with us ; but he placed such an exalted estimate on his services that it is doubtful if his advances were serious. In any case, in spite of every opening afforded him both by message and writing, he repeatedly failed to come to the scratch, and finally committed himself completely to the services of the Turks, receiving considerable sums from them for raising an Arab contingent for co-operation with their forces opposing us at Shu'aibah. But he proved a broken reed to his patron, both at Shu'aibah and in the operations leading to the capture of Nasiriyah. He remained in the desert and in close touch with the Turks until we raided ‘Anah in the spring of 1918, writing frequently to the Shamiyah shaikhs, and providing a focus for Turkish intrigue. He was doubtless instrumental in fostering the troubles at Najaf, which ended in the murder of Captain Marshall in March, 1918. He was still an outlaw at the date of the Armistice. SA‘DUN, ‘ATI IBN ‘ABDULLAH IBN MANSUR IBN THAMIR. Head of the Arab Scouts at Nasiriyah, has shown himself a faithful servant of the British. A good horseman, used to a soldier’s life. Owns considerable property up the Hai which Muhammad al Yasin (Shaikh of the Maiyah) has got hold of and pays him no rent. He used to live at Hassanah with ‘Abdullah Falih, but when the latter’s attitude towards us became doubtful, he removed with all his family into the Al Ibrahim country, North East of Nasiriyah. A pleasant-mannered, well-bred man of about 40, not par ticularly intelligent, but a good trustworthy type. He was wounded in our service and was given a decoration. SA'DUN, BADR AL RASHID.’ . 0f the R ashid clan. Lives a mile from Suq with ‘Abdul ‘Aziz al Rashid, but spends six months yearly m tents among his camels living a nomad life. Tall in figure a fine example of the best type of Beduin Sa'dun. Influential, owns large property in’camels SA DUN, BANDAR IBN ‘ABDUU ‘ALI IBN SULAIMAN IBN MANSUR IBN RASHID. Came to ‘Ali Gharbi from the Hai in October, 1916, and proposed to remove his an^lfowance^ t01T ' H6 ^ allowed to settle with Fahad al Cxhadhban and given SA‘DUN, DHARI AL SAQR, HAjI.

Lived at Hassunah with Abdullah Falih. Dhari was ‘Abdullah Falih’s right105 (1705) hand, a very well known man, much respected. A bit of a philosopher, a lover of peace, pro-English. He left ‘Abdullah Falih and settled in our territory with a group of Sa'dun whom he won over from ‘Abdullah. SA'DUN, FAHAD BEG IBN ‘ALI IBN SULAIMAN IBN MANSUR IBN RASHID. Small sturdy, a fighter with a great reputation among the Arabs who have nick named him “ the lion.” In many ways very similar in character to ‘Ajaimi. He drew upon himself the wrath of the latter for harbouring a well known Sa'dun agent of ours prior to the battle of Shu aibah. ‘Ajaimi endeavoured to kill him. Since the occupation of Nasiriyah Fahad has been consistently loyal to us. He lives quietly in his garden on the Euphrates in the Ahl Kut area above Suq. He has suffered badly from the depre dations of tribesmen who think his garden and dates fair game. Has always been ready to serve and help us, and would make a good leader of tribal horse. He is at present unoccupied and poor. SA‘DUN, FAHAD AL SULAIMAN AL MANSUR. Great-grandson of Mansur, the brother of Nasir Pasha. Though not on good terms with ‘Ajaimi, he joined the Turks in January, 1915. Well disposed to us. He came in to the A.P.O. at Nasiriyah and offered to use his influence with the Gharraf tribes. The offer was accepted in general terms, but no special task was suggested to him, nor was a definite understanding made, or reward offered. Nothing came of the matter ; after the fall of Kut in April, 1916, he showed no inclination to take any part in the troubled politics of the Gharraf, but went to the Budur to keep clear of the whole business. An honest man of some ability. SA'DUN, FAISAL IBN BADR IBN MISHARI AL ‘ABDULLAH. He and his family used to live with ‘Abdullah Falih and received an allowance from him, but they left him when he went over to the Turks in the autumn of 1916, and settled in four gardens outside Nasiriyah owned by Faisal. He shares with his brothers in the family property at Umm al Haiyat on the Gharraf and at ‘Aqroq on the Hammar near the Fuhud. There is also property held jointly by the family at Chabasi al Saghir near Oardalan on the Shatt al ‘Arab. His uncles ‘Abdul ‘Aziz, ‘Abdul Latif and ‘Abdul Wahhad, hold land at ‘Ailah (Gharraf) ; his uncles ‘Id and Isma'il, hold some of the family estate at Madain (Gharraf) ; his cousin, Ghalib ibn Humud, has property in the Umm al Qutain, and the sons of his uncles, Jarrah and Muhammad, hold lands at Al Shahiniyah (Gharraf) ^ but these have passed out of cultivation owing to lack of water. Faisal is a well mannered man of about 45 with defective eyesight, which obliges him to wear strong blue spectacles. SA'DUN, FARHAN AL RAHAMAH. Has property at Hamranan, south of Khuzainah on the Nahr Hamran, Harthah District. Much damage done by the floods of 1915-16. A pleasant, probably somewhat specious man between 35-40. * • rr r + r The Rahamah are very distantly connected with the Sa'dun, being an ottshoot ol the family at a remote period. SA'DUN, PARIS IBN BADR IBN SATTAM IBN BADR. A man of about 50. Lives mostly with ‘Abbas ibn Khalid (q.v.), and came with him to Basrah in August, 1916. SA'DUN, HACHIM IBN SULTAN IBN MUSLUT IBN DAUD IBN MANSUR. Nephew of ‘Ali Mansur, an Arab scout at Nasiriyah. He has property at Tufai ^i opposite Shafi, the fallahin are Laftah ibn Hunaiyan and his people, who have paid no rent for two years. Intelligent pleasant man. SA'DUN, HUMUD AL MISHARI. Humud ibn ‘Amr ibn ‘Abdullah, generally known as Humud al Mishan (N.B .—Mishari was his uncle, but his father ‘Amr died many years ago an called after Mishari, who was better known.) The Mishari have aiways b ^ the Falih family as leaders in their wars, the Fahh not being good sold e y commanders. Humud was ‘Abdullah Falih s chief fighting man. i‘DUN, IBRAHIM IBN MIZ'AL. „ . + . , A grandson of Nasir and cousin of 'Abdullah Falih He ^ most Pm-Bntrsh of the Sa'dun ; refused to go to Shu'aibah and came in o u Hassunah north Nasiriyah. Has held consistently with us. His own country rouim Hassimah^r ^ of the Hammar Lake being so much disturbed, he came ow nl ,. tn K, :r the Sa'dun brought all his family. His mother is a negro slave girl. 1 he on y ™“ b ?™ e nn 7 dUn who had the determination to throw in his lot with us unreservedly from the beginning.106 &gt;r SA'DtJN, MISHARI IBN SA'DUN AL FAHAD AL MUHAMMAD. A man of between 40 and 50. Was in Suq district ; has palm gardens in the‘Asa- chirah country, lj hours above Suq, also on the Gharraf at Hausah, near Shatrah. He went up to Shatrah as an agent of ours after the fall of Kut, was taken by the Turks and sent to Mosul. He was released, as there was no documentary evidence against him, and returned to Suq after an absence of some eight or nine months. He was eight months in Turkish hands. Receives an allowance from us. SA'DUN, MUHAMMAD BEG AL FAHAD. Hai district. A Sa'dun Mallak holding most of the land in the district on the right bank of Gharraf. He follows the usual Sa'dun tent life, taking only a light rent from the tribes. He is the best educated and most widely travelled man in the district, having been to Constantinople and Egypt. As a result he has a broader outlook, and being already fairly wealthy, gets on well with his tenants. Would probably like to take part in public life in ‘Iraq if occassion arose ; probably, however, his views as to the land question would differ from those of Government. SA'DUN, MUTLAQ AL HUMUD. A Shaikh of the old style, now much advanced in years. He lives in the eastern part of the Hammar region, north of the lake, not far from Badr Rumaiyidh, and owns considerable properties on which the Albu Shamah, B. Hutait, Husaini and Musharraf (Muntafiq-Bani Malik) live. He is a son of Faisal and grandson of the famous Humud al Sa'dun who ruled the clan for 40 years, during half of which time he was blind. After our occupation of Basrah he came into Basrah and remained there for some weeks, but he is a harmless old dotard, and got into the unscrupulous hands of one Mathew Martos (since deported) who led him astray. Suddenly without any apparent reason, except perhaps that he thought the Turks were going to retake Basrah, he went over to the enemy or to 'Ajaimi at Shu'aibah. After the fall of Nasiriyah he made his submission again and Major Smyth, in ignorance of what had happened previously, welcomed him and whitewashed him. Is now living on his property on the Hammar. For many years the tribes have paid him no rents. SA'DUN, NASIR IBN ‘AJIL IBN FARIS IBN MUHAMMAD. The head of the Muhammad branch. Has lands at Huwairah (adjoining Kutaiban) and on the Bad'ah he possesses estates called Umm al Farur and Buwaidah. These last were in the hands of the Bani Zaid, who paid no rent until we took Nasiriyah, when they were frightened and paid up handsomely. All the lands of the Isma'il also belong to Nasir ; they pay no rent. SA'DUN, SA'UD AL RASHID. A distant cousin of Badr Al Rashid (q.v.). Very pro-British and would like to take service with us as a leader of tribal horse or Shabanah. Small and dark, of unprepossessing appearance, but energetic , has helped us in the settlement of several important boundary disputes near Suq, notably among the Hasan. He himself is deeply involved in a dispute over land with the Nuwashi who are tenants on the Rashid lands and pay no rents He lives with ‘Abdul ‘Aziz al Rashid a mile from Suq. SA'DUN, SHIBLI BEG. Hai district. A good type of the Sa'dun landholder and one of the very few who manages his own estates ; he possesses the courtesy and manners characteristic of most of the Sa dun without their usual importunity and grievances. As he is a Sa'dun Mallak mainly among Rabi'ah tribes his position is somewhat difficult, and he sees that his future is entirely bound up with the British Government, and is very loyal and anxious to please. As a result of what must have been a somewhat troubled life, he is full of suspicions of all Arab officials and of his neighbours, probably in most cases with justification. SA'DUN, SUFUQ IBN HACHIM AL ‘AZIZ. Of the Shabib clan a wizened old man. His conversation is interesting, but he is one of the poorest of the Sa dun in the Suq district He lives at Umm al Battush. SA DUN, SULTAN IBN HUMUD IBN 'ABDULLAH IBN MANStJR IBN RASHID. Enticed over from ‘Ajaimi's camp by Thamir Beg and settled at Umm al Battush. mnnnpr h P m a ^ dmg ^ fi§Ure n° f ''c re P uted to be 'Ajaimi’s leader of horse. Pleasant manner out shy and proud. Scorns to ask for presents107 (1705) SA'DIJN, SUMAIR IBN ‘ABDULLAH IBN MANStJR AL RASHID. Holds the lands of the ‘Amairah, Fuhud, Hawal and Ahl Muchairi in the Hammar, but receives little rent ; has four gardens in Nasiriyah and lands at Humairah (Qal'at Sikar), and at Mutawwa'ah opposite Muhammarah (the Ardh al Ruwais), some held jointly by the family. The heirs of Mansur held the Qa al Rashid on the Hammar from the frontiers of the J uwaibir to the frontiers of the Albu Shamah and S. to the frontiers of the Tbadah country, inclusive. Sumair’s family are at and near Nasiriyah. SA'DUN, THAMIR IBN SA'DUN. Elder brother of ‘Ajaimi. Lives at Umm al Battush near Suq and keeps a kind of semi-regal state, surrounding himself with Sa'dun notables who look to him as the head of the family. He is not, however, well off. His leading trait is his hatred of his brother ‘AjaimLwho, being a man of much stronger character and with a greater capacity as a leader, has eclipsed and supplanted Thamir. Chiefly owing to this sentiment Thamir stood locally by us ; he receives a subsidy and in December, 1916, he was given an allow ance for 30 horsemen whom he is bound to maintain for Government service in the Suq- Khamisiyah district. He is weak and obstinate, has a bad temper which at times gets control of him, is touchy, and possesses all the inordinate conceit of the Sa'dun. Very pleasant in personal intercourse. Strong supporter of Government, and carries on faith fully his work of keeping order in the Shamiyah. SA'DUN, THAMIR IBN SA'DUN IBN 'ASSAF IBN SALIH. A man of about 30 or less. Lives mostly with ‘Abbas Ibn Khalid (q.v.). Came to Basrah with him in August, 1916. SA'DUN, THUWAINI IBN ‘ABDULLAH IBN MANSUR AL RASHID, HAjI. Brother of Sumair; the two bear a marked resemblance to one another. Lives with Thamir Beg at Umm al Battush.

Joined the Turks in the beginning of the war but made submission to us in July, 1915. He rejoined the Turks after the fall of Kut. A man of no ability and slim un reliable character. He was settled at Alowi in the Shamiyah at the beginning of war, and on our occupation of Basrah wrote to the C.P.O. and pretended that he was friendly and wanted to come in, but failed to do so. On the Turks advancing from Khamisiyah he joined them. During a reconnaissance of ours, in retaliation, Alowi was attacked and his mud fort destroyed. SA'DUN, YUSUF AL MANSUR. Cousin of 'Ajaimi. Was with the Turks at Shu'aibah, came to us subsequently and was told to remain in Basrah. Left without permission in the late autumn of 1915 and went to Hassunah. He had been in communication with the Turks and is beheved to ha visited Khalil Pasha after the fall of Kut. Visited ‘Ajaimi and complained that ^ property at Mutawwa'ah near Basrah had been confiscated by us. Then went to Shatrah to Mizhir Pasha. SA'DUN, HAjI. w .. Of the Khaza'il Saw the C.P.O. on 23rd June, 1916. Letters sent by him to Khaza il Shaikhs, Sahan al Shadan, Muhammad al ‘Abtan, Salman al Dhahrr giving he^iews of the Mecca and Karbala risings.

Appointed Mudir of the Ham- mar Lake Shabanahs in October, 1916, in succession to Mahi al Khaiyun. A strong personality. SA'DUN AL RASAN. Shaikh of Al Hamad ('Aqrah), Diwaniyah district. A crafty and unscrupulous person. Incapable of speaking the truth. Notorious bad character, often punished by the Turks. Had to be similarly dealt with early in 1918. Has considerably improved, but needs constant attention. An inveterate intriguer and disturber of the peace, with a long standing feud with Sha'lan al ‘Atiyah of the Shabbanah. sAfi, bait. Of Najaf. Students whose activities should be watched. SAHAN AL SHA'LAN. Khaza'il. He is the Shaikh of the nomadic sections, but will take to cultivation, if there is sufficient water in the Hillah branch of the Euphrates. A fine type of nomad chief. We first entered into relations with him in June, 1916, when all the leading Khaza'il shaikhs communicated with Sir Percy Cox. SAHAR IBN HUSAIN. Albu Darraj. Uncle of Mutashshar. Given by us a third share in the Albu Darraj estates with Mutashshar and Shia'ibn Fa'al. In the early part of 1916 he intrigued con stantly against Mutashshar and was therefore evicted.

He did excellent work in the blockade when he surrendered almost all the prominent persons. His cousin Muhsin ibn Najm also did well. SA'ID IBN KHALIL. Mukhtar of Rayah, Ba'qubah district ; no authority, but as the village is tiny it does not matter. SAIHUD, FALIH IBN. Of the Albu Muhammad, harms the Muqata'ahs of Hafirah, Kasrah and Jamshah opposite Qahat Salih. Considers he has a good hereditary claim to the headship of the Albu Muhammad as his father was recognized as paramount by the Turks. In his youth he was held a prisoner by the Turks first in Constantinople and then at Uskub. His father held Majar al Kabir for many years, but Falih was exiled immediately after his father’s death, owing to the accumulation of arrears which he was unable to pay. Before this he had taken a prominent part in the great fight between Saihud and Ghadhban, while his brother Abdul Karim (d. 1917), in order to attract attention to the family grievances, fired on river steamers and held up all river traffic. Falih spent from 1911 to 1912 in exile in Huwaizah and was finally put into his present Muqata'ah with a promise from the Turks that he should get Majar al Kabir at the end of Majid al Khalifah’s lease. Falih controls 1,500 rifles or more ; he brought 550 infantry and 60 horsemen to join the Turks at Basrah in November, 1914, and was anxious to obtain a Turkish medal. After the battle of Qurnah his tribesmen quarrelled with the Turks. He was imprisoned for refusing to fight, but was released in March. He made submission to us on our occupation of ‘Amarah. Consideiing the size of his district and the fact that thirty miles of railway and road run109 through it, Falih has had more calls made upon him than any other Shaikh. He has responded with the greatest generosity and is deserving of recognition. Similarly, in complying with demands for live stock, he has delivered very much more than could reasonably be expected. He is a man of about 48, relatively civilized, a scholar and trust worthy as long as he is not offended. He is a strong Shaikh and has the reputation of treating his people impartially. He undoubtedly obtains a large revenue out of them, but he is considerate in his dealings with them. Is very keen on shooting, and spends most of his time in that way in the winter season. Has a large family, with grown up sons, and keeps them in excellent order. Is jealous of interference, but looks ahead and should prove a valuable asset in future. Dislikes Majid intensely, and hopes to get part of his Muqata'ah one day, or at any rate, something better than he has at present. Very anxious to get a settled tenure, and build himself a proper house. SAIHUD, FITNAH BINT. Albu Muhammad, sister of Falih and step-mother of Muhammad al Hattab of the Albu Darraj. Lives in Falih’s Muqata'ah and manages a farm herself. A notable woman with a sharp tongue. Is suffering from eye disease. SAIHUD, HATIM IBN. Albu Muhammad. He joined the Turks in December, 1915, and was one of the three Shaikhs who assisted them with 600 men in the defence of Qurnah. He was a fourth in the Falih-Zabun-'Abdul Karim coalition and held out after all the others had come in. Quarrels perpetually with his brother Falih over the Hafirah Muqata'ah. As he had to be settled on the land somewhere or remain an outlaw, he was given by us the Jawwar estate next to Majar al Kabir. Not as valuable as it used to be since the Jawwar canal was allowed to silt up during the fighting between the old Shaikh Saihud, Hatim’s father, and Ghadhban of the B. Lam. The corn lands are cultivated by Bahadil, the rice lands by Albu Muhammad. In November, 1916, Hatim went over to the Turks and Jawwar was given to Majid at Khalifah on a year’s lease. . Hatim married a sister of ‘Araibi Pasha whom he subsequently divorced and he is consequently at feud with ‘Araibi ; also with his own son Tahir of Jurait, who took his mother’s part. A ne’er-do-well of little importance. He came in after the advance to Baghdad. SAIHUD, KHURAIBIT IBN FALIH. Albu Muhammad. Brother of Dawwai, Bunaiyah, Mujbil and Saddam. Sons of Falih Saihud.

SALIH AL dAghir. Head of the Khashab section of the Ibrahim (Muntafiq, Bani Malik) the only shaikh of the tribe who has stood by us consistently and rejected all Turkish overtures, looked upon as leading shaikh of the Ibrahim by us in consequence. Gets Rs.200 subsidy per month. He rendered good service in endeavouring to bring in wavering shaikhs of his own and other tribes (October, 1916). His attitude was no doubt due in a great measure to the fact that his domicile is within range of our guns at Nasiriyah. Has not much influence in the tribe. Shifty, cunning, under the protection of Dhari Beg as Sa'dun. Received 3,000 loan in 1917 at 5 per cent, from P.O., Nasiriyah in order to dig a water channel.

In September the Khaza'il and Fatlah had a three days’ fight, which ended in a compromise, arranged by Saiyid Muhammad Kadhim Yazdi. The Fatlah agreed to come to the aid of the Khaza'il if the Turks attacked them. Salman had a long-standing dispute with Muhammad al ‘Abtan, which was settled by fasl in 1918.

IV.B.-These tracts are also claimed by Mutashshar, who married Shawwai s sister. These lands should probably be Albu Darrai not Azairij property. Salman is a man of about 50, parsimonious and unpopular but a strong character. He secretly hates Shawwai. He has his tribes well in hand and possesses a sense of humour. SALMAN AL QU‘AIYID. Previously Head Shaikh of the Yasar. On the surface Salman is rather a “ hail fellow well met ” sort of person, but is a born intriguer and not to be trusted.

Head of the Fatlah on the left bank. A man of considerable influence over his tribe and sarkals.

The second most important Mujtahid in Najaf and fourth in the Shi'ah world. He was made a Mujtahid through the influence of the Constitutionalists, who at the time were badly in need of Mujtahids to support them. A very learned man and well educated in other matters besides religion. Distinctly weak-minded and prone to interference in political affairs, and to intrigues sub rosa against Saiyid Kadhim Yazdi. He took a prominent part in the Jihad, but this was chiefly owing to pressure and bribery. It is impossible to say whether he is pro-anything at heart, except money. He is liable to gi\ e, on the spur of the moment, an opinion which he may afterwards regret. He should be treated with great care, and it should be remembered that in reality117 he has no influence, his name being only an axis around which intrigues can be woven, his vanity being played upon with the idea that the addition of his name to such and such a pronouncement will result in considerable elevation for himself. Intrigues will always centre upon him, owing to the fact that Saiyid Kadhim and Mirza Muhammad Taqi are entirely aloof from such influences. He is an Oudh Bequest Mujtahid distributor, and his acceptance of this post was solely due to the fact that his influence is so small as to bring him in practically no charity. His son, Shaikh Hasan, is mad. SHARIF AL ASSAD, HAJI. Brother of ‘Ali al Assad and like him a merchant in the Hammar. See Fallal a Tofan. sharshAb IBN SHAHAM.

Shaikh of the Muhammad Al Dhiyab. He also controls the cultivators of the Albu Nimr and various extraneous tribes. His influence is about equal to that of Mushin al Hardan, q.v., but he is far more ambitious, and owing to his greater energy his influence is likely to increase in the future. His age is about 35. His father, who was Shaikh before him, died in 1914. ^ ^ rp his correspondence himself. His He can read and write, and deals with shAwush al jabbArah. .

His sons, Saiyid Husain and Saiyid Rajuj, wrote constantly to us, and Rajuj visited Nasiriyah twice. They protected Indian refugees fleeing from Najaf. All the east end of Samawah was strongly pro-British, the west end under Robat al Salman neutral as far as overt acts went, but friendly to ‘Ajaimi. Saiyid Taffar had come into collision with the Turks in the summer of 1913, when the Government attempted to arrest him. He took refuge with the Al ‘Abas (Bani Huchaim) and offered a successful resistance to the troops sent out against him. In March, 1917, when ‘Ajaimi withdrew northwards, Saiyid Taffar regained his liberty, and was very useful to us during and after the occupation of Samawah, but he cannot forget his old enemies, and continually endeavours to bring about their embarrassment. A shrewd and able man. His sons have not inherited his capacity. tAha BEG. u Kirkuk district Kurd. A notable of the ruling family of the Sahhi, but not immersed in tribal' affairs.

In Tanuary, 1918, he was ordered to reside atSuwaij, near Shatrah, where he was pensioned off with a small salary of Rs. 80 per month. He is medium sized with a black beard and cheerful countenance, a strong well-wisher of the British , a most useful man to have among the tribes, but his reports are often not to be relied on. He has a tendency to so cook his news that, if believed, some of his private enemies would certainly come off badly at our hands. tAhir beg begzadah. Brother of Majid Beg Jaf Begzadah (q.v). Principal notable and present governor of Halabja. TAHIR AL HUSAIN. Shaikh of the Bani Sa'id (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Bani Khaiqan). He is the bright spot in the Mujarrah tribes.

The A.P.O. tried to settle the quarrel but without success, the Albu Hamdan sending insulting answers to his messages, and Saiyid Talib, who is a man of 45, remained at Suq on a subsistence allowance until he could be reinstated. His settlement occupies a point of vantage, though an isolated one, and was subsequently occupied by a British outpost detachment. His property was returned to him in September, 1916. Brother of Saiyid Husain. tallAl al tolAn. With ‘Ali al Haji Assad joint Rais of the Tbadah (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Bani Khaiqan). Both are plausible men of fine and commanding appearance.

Is getting on in years, and keeps in the background as regards active dealings with Government, his son Challub acting on most occasions for him. Tarfah has excellent manners and is highly respected amongst the tribesmen, who are in the habit of bringing inter-tribal and domestic troubles to him for settlement. He is a striking figure, and a contrast to most of his very commonplace neighbours. Always obliging and helpful in advice. The Bait Sabr are on very good terms with the Bait Battikh, the two making up the Mujablah section, but they occupy different lands, and the former kept themselves clear of the Battikh family brigandage.

Thamir’s brothers, Shabib and ‘Ah, and his uncle Ghadhban, have shares in the farm. (Cxhadhban died in October, 1916, and his son Sadiq inherited his share.) The four tenants used to share the estate m quarters but Thamir now takes a half and the rest have a half between them. Thamir has behaved very well since the occupation of ‘Amarah.

Nephew of Ghadhban al Bunaiyah, with whom Balasim was at enmity. ‘Ubairah is a child, and the absence of any dominant authority in the Muqata'ah is convenient. ‘ULAIWI, HAJI. Rich mallak and merchant of Badrah. Oppressive and cunning. Not to be trusted. Very unpopular. ‘ULAIWI AL MARHIJ. Head shaikh of the Bam Sa'id (Muntafiq), Nasiriyah district. A friend of Badr al Rumaiyidh, q.v., who tried to persuade him that the Turks would ultimately return. He seldom comes to Nasiriyah. Hand in glove with Naif al Masha. 'ULAIWI AL MIJRAN. Shaikh of Ghawalbah, Balad district. Shares authority with Mulla Naif, q.v. A lying and low scheming rascal, but withal very plausible and pleasant to speak to.

Brother of the Shaikh of the Mujablah, Shammar Toqah, ‘Aziziyah district. Employed by Government as a crop estimator for Revenue purposes. ‘UMAR IBN HAJI ‘ALWAN, SHAIKH. Of Karbala. Aged 34. He and his younger brother, ‘Uthman, are the representa tives of a Shaikhly family, who were in bitter rivalry with the Kammunah Zadah.

Haji ‘Alwan, the father of ‘Umar, was a muleteer ; he married a wife who had a certain amount of land and property. ‘UMAR FAUDHI. Of Basrah. A Turkish Advocate and a thorough scoundrel.

Farmer of the Nusf Shatt al Gharbi, Kulailah and Umm al Zabib Muqata ah just above Qal at Salih on left bank of Tigris, and also Nusf Shatt al Sharqi, which extends from about two miles below Qalat Salih to Ezra’s tomb. This latter Muqata'ah was given to ‘Usman on Zabun’s defection to the Turks in 1916. Has been outwardly a firm supporter of the British Government, and has supplied much labour and produce for military needs. Taking everything into consideration he behaved very well over the Michariyah Dam question, and kept his people well in hand. He has however, several grave failings which on occasions hamper our relations with him. He is terribly avaricious and seems incapable of telling the truth. Very narrow minded and singularly lacking in intelligence for a man with his power and opportunities. Is often very unfair in his dealings with his people. YASIR, ZABUN IBN. Albu Muhammad. Farmer of the Nasf Shatt al Sharqi estate which he held for some years. The farm is about two miles below Qal'at Salih, and extends nearly to ‘Azair. The fallahin are Sarraj and Bani Malik. Zabun joined the Turks in February, 1914, with 300 men. Subsequently came in to us and was given a reduction in the fees of his farm as the fees were too high. The lease was made out in the name of his son, Challub. Though he lives only five miles from Qal'at Salih he constantly refused to come in and see any British officer from the time when he first met the C.P.O. In January, 1916, he sent a Saiyid to make his peace with the Turks, but the Turks killed his messenger as a spy. Undiscouraged by this rebuff he remained openly pro-Turkish, and in June, 1916, was evicted from his Muqata'ah after repeated orders to come in and report himself. Challub, who suffers from goitre, joined the Turks. Zabun is ignorant and bigoted. He keeps a large number of men who exercise the influence of the evil eye. He came in after the advance to Baghdad. yAsir, saiyid. Of Karradi. Farms some lands belonging to ‘Abdullah Falih al Sa'dun on the Hor al Kar four hours S. of Tbrah (about eight hours from Suq al ‘Afaj) and six hours from Karradi. His fallahin are Budair, Shuraifat, Hachcham, etc. He was once a man of some means, but the water from the Hor ‘Afaj having diminished the lands have con siderably fallen in value. Nothing but a little millet can be grown. YASIR, SAIYID. A Saiyid of Qal'at Salih town. Cases requiring settlement according to Shar'ah law are referred to him, and he has rendered great assistance. His decisions seem impartial, and generally give satisfaction to the parties concerned. He is also now supervising the repairs to the shrine of ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Ali. YASIR AL CHOlAN. Shaikh of the Albu Humaidi, a nasty, treacherous crowd, section of the Hasan (Mun- tahq, Bani Malik, Mujarrah). Yasir was for long openly hostile ; has a reputation for extreme dishonesty, and will betray his own people. Influential, a dangerous man, was in constant touch with ‘Ajaimi. YUSUF EFFENDI IBN ‘ABDULLAH. Rais al Baladiyah at Mandali. Of Turkish extraction. Not by nature a prominent man, but honest and hard working. YtSUF AL BA’Aj, SAIYID. Mudir of Qarmat Bani Sa'id. About 35, a useful man, has been in the employment of the C.P.O. in secret service work. Continues to do good work. YUSUF IBN HAJI CHILAB. Owns property near Qal'at Salih and does some business there. Untrustworthy and unfriendly. YUSUF AL DUWAIRI. Merchant of Kuwait, anti-British, pro-Turk. In February, 1917 approached Shaikh Salim on behalf of a clique of Moslems with a request that women and children should be prohibited from attending missionary services on Sunday. Shaikh Salim replied It is unimportant and it is their day.” YUSUF AL MUSHAIT. Sarkal of Sindiyah, Daltawah area.YtSUF AL TOFAN, HAjI. Shaikh of the Qata‘ subsection of the Ghananimah section of the ‘Asachrah (Muntafiq,. Bani Malik). Like all his rascally tribe was consistently anti-British. Took part against us in the action of September, 1916. No influence beyond his humulah. YUSUF AL YA'QUB. A Jew merchant and head of this persuasion in Samarra. Is typical of his race and a sworn enemy of the Rais Baladiyah, Ahmad Beg. YUSUF ZAWAWI, SAIYID. Of Musqat. Well known to Sir Percy Cox who has always found him useful in political matters. He is, however, a strong Mohammadan. His family has great influence in Musqat and is probably largely responsible for the undercurrent of pan-Islamic feeling which exists there. This feeling is directed against the Sharif, who is not considered to be sufficiently powerful to organize an independent Moslem state nor to prove himself an effective guardian of the Holy Places. A letter of pro-Turkish colour purporting to be written by one of the Zawawi family, who was in India, to Saiyid Yusuf, was intercepted by the censor in October, 1915, but was judged to be a forgery. In January, 1917, a copy of verses written by his son Saiyid ‘Abdul Mun'im, a boy of 16, to Saiyid Muhammad Effendi Saiyid Hariri of Damascus was found in the possession of a suspect, Shaikh ‘Abdul ‘Aziz ibn al Hasan al Basati of Madinah, who was arrested at Lingah. Though the ascription of authorship was denied by the family the verses are probably genuine. ZABtN IBN YASIR. See Yasir, Zabun ibn. ZAKI, SAIYID. Of Hillah. Inspector of police, Syrian. His father was in the Law Court in Jerusalem. He is educated, very energetic and is learning English. He was formerly inspector of police in Najaf, and no doubt acquired a good many undesirable habits there. He came to Hillah in a state of poverty and practised as a Wakil for a bit; went down eventually to Diwaniyah in search of employment. He was then on his beam ends and ill. He was brought back to the civil police at Hillah. On the whole he has done well. He is a born detective and loves it. He has investigated robberies and crime with distinct success on occasions. He has handed over various bribes including one given him of £30 T. in gold. With strict supervision he will be very useful; we cannot afford to lose people with energy and intelligence ; but he must be looked after in case he employs his energy in undesired directions. zAmil al mannA*. Nasiriyah district. Head of a family of Hijaz origin, dependent on the Sa'dun. They were put in some 50 years ago as head men of the Ajwad division of the Muntafiq, but the position is purely titular with no executive tribal authority. In war time one of the Manna', if there happened to be a capable man available, would be the natural leader of the Ajwad. In an assembly of the Ajwad, Zamil would have the highest seat. The family have property on the Gharraf, and at Nasiriyah. Since the occupation of Gharraf, Zamil has been very friendly and obliging. J zAmil ibn manshad. Albu Muhammad. Maternal uncle of ‘Araibi, the father of Muhammad (q.v.). Aged about 50. Held Majar al Kabir 26 years ago and was evicted for arrears of revenue. Afterwards lived with Araibi as one of his principal sub-farmers, and has great influence Pleasant fat old man. Appears to be particularly well disposed to us.

Nationality Greek. Speaks French. J Rendered assistance to the Intelligence Department during This resulted in his deportation by the Turks to Anatolia He is a pleasant but not very intelligent man.ziyArah al mahi. Of the Azairij. Formerly partner of Salman al Manshad (his cousin) and Shawwai al Fahad on the Majar al Saghir. There were constant quarrels between them, and the Turks were obliged to separate the interests of the partners in order to keep the peace. Ziycirah was allowed to hold ‘Audah and Shattaniyah free of charge, the fees being paid by the other two shaikhs. In 1913 they appealed to Constantinople, and the lease was cancelled, probably by bribery. Ziyarah took refuge with Mutashshar of the Albu Darraj. Not a very strong man, but said to be open-handed and popular with the tribe. Age about 35. One of the few shaikhs who had no dealings with the Turks, with whom he was very sore on account of his previous treatment. He has been restored to ‘Audah and Shattaniyah, and should do very well as shaikh. Lately took a theatre to his muqata'ah and half married ‘Atiyah, a profligate dancing girl. Also sold Karun wheat advanced as seed straightway in the bazaar to pay part of his debts. A profligate. ZUBAIR, SHAIKH OF. See Ibrahim ibn ‘Abdullah. ZUHAIR, ‘ABDUL MUSHIN AL. Of Basrah. An adherent of the C.U.P. mainly out of hatred for Saiyid THib. Stupid, spendthrift, no interest in pan-Arab question, bad morals. Remained in Basrah when the Turks were driven out. ZUHAIR, ‘ABDUL WAHAB PASHA AL. Of Basrah. All the Zuhair family are adherents of the C.U.P. The only capable member of it was Ahmad Pasha, who was a deputy and is now dead. ‘Abdul Wahab is a gambler. Ahmad Pasha’s heirs have property at Qarmat ‘Ah (practically the whole of which belongs to them) and at Salihiyah. ZUHAIR, ‘ALI IBN HUSAIN AL. Of Basrah. Adherent of C.U.P., hated Saiyid Talib. Stupid, but a man of influence. Lives on the fortune of his wife. ZUWAIN, ‘ABBAS, SAIYtD. Shamiyah division. A distant cousin of Saiyid Hadi, with whom he is on bad terms. A more plastic type than Saiyid Hadi, but none the less undesirable. He is almost as much disliked as the former, but being less avaricious, or more wealthy, is less oppressive to the people. At present honorary Rais Baladiyah of Ja‘arah, in which position for obvious reasons he is eminentlv unsatisfactory. He will be replaced as soon as staff becomes available. He probably accepted this post to prevent Saiyid Hadi from intriguing against himself. ZUWAIN, SAIYID HADI. . . i i Shamivah division. A man of about 40, head of a family of Mecca origin, belonging to the wellknown A'raji house of Saiyids. His great gpTwTh^Zubafd ^Ahat where Saiyid Hadi now lives, and by permission of Wadi, Shaikh of the Zubaid, at t a time paramount in the Middle Euphrates, brought the surrounding iand under culti vation. The influence of the Zuwain extended at the time almost to Shmafiya , was curtailed when the Turks brought in the Fatlah and Ibrahim. f , nolitica i Saivid Hadi represented Government interests m Shamiyah before p occuDation of the district but is much given to intrigue, and has many enemies. Was undermined his position, which was at the best an artificial one. trusted H is. «,§r^ o f N ^ house of the Khaza'il.■</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000912.0x000090_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/20/221</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000912.0x000090</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/20/221</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Personalities.
