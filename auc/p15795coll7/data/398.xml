He tells of being responsible for managing the resumption of internet connections at the New Cairo campus, which had been cut due to the internet outage after January 28.  ##### recounts attending the protests at Tahrir Square, and depicts the coexistence there of people from all segments of society, though he emphasizes the participation of educated young people.  He mentions seeing Muslims and Christians sharing food, and did not observe women being harassed.  What he saw convinced him to bring his children to the demonstrations at Tahrir Square, because he felt it was safe for them to attend.  ###### recalls his doubts that President Mubarak would step down, and tells about driving around aimlessly in his car on the day before Mubarak’s departure, filled with pessimism.  He notes that the revolution broke a barrier of fear in the Egyptian people and convinced them of their right to free expression, and discusses his hopes for the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections.</dc:description><dc:date>2011-07-25</dc:date><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:language>Arabic</dc:language><dc:identifier>20110725</dc:identifier><dc:relation>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution</dc:relation><dc:source>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution oral histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2012, American University in Cairo.
