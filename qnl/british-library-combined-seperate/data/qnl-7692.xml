The summaries cover independent countries (Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, and Ethiopia), sovereignties previously under British Mandate or influence (Egypt, Sudan, Trans-Jordan, and Iraq), territories under British Mandate or protection (Palestine and the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms), British Colonies (Cyprus and the Aden Protectorate), and occupied territories under British military administration (Tripolitania, Cyrenaica, and Eritrea).The subject matter is developments, and proposals for developments, in civil aviation in the Middle East and surrounding regions. This includes the attitude of local governments to civil aviation, and the position of Britain's international competitors in civil aviation. Details related to the formation of airlines, and frequency of operating services are included.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Intelligence</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Civil Aviation</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Middle East</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Airlines</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x00024b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
