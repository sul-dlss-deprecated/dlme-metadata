Alongside each paragraph is a counter-explanation from Colonel Merewether, most of which either give fuller explanations of the correspondence cited or highlight areas where the Colonel has made assumptions and suppositions without having any evidence to support them.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024102474.0x000019#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
