MEMORANDUM. ^ 5 r- iV Please refer to your i'emorandum Ko: 1409/11 dated tde 25 th rhil Haj 1350. 2. 1 am not prepared to extend the arrangement made for the iduharraq Baladiya to the ^anama Balediya for several reasons. The first is that this arrangement was only allowed to the fiuharraq Balaaiya on account of their distance from Manama and the inconvenience caused both to then ana shop keepers in coming over to Panama for petty suits, ihis difficulty does not exist in ’Tmrma. Another objection is that tnis Baladiya habitually allows prominent persons to owe _ them sums of money for considerable periods. Ihen they do I this it is clearly unjustifiable to put into their hands a I weapon which enables them to take drastic action against small men while allowing the big man to escape. 3. You are probably aware that they recently applied to this Agency for the recovery of a claim against a member of the Majlis itself,which had been ^veruue for 1 year and 11 months. 1 think a bye law should be passed obliging the Secretary to sue automatically all debtors owing sums for over three montns,unless the Majlis by a resolution at a full meeting decides to cancel the amount. 4. A third reason,which renders me indisposed to give this concession to the Baladiya,is that their whole system of collecting house taxes is wrong ana,as you are aware,they only /^persist in it since most of the members of the Majlis are I jproperty owners, in no other town or country that I know of is anyone but the owner of the house responsible for payment, 1 ne) 17 and as you know they are obliged to pay even if they are unsuccessful in renting their properties* Should the Manana Baladiya adopt this plan they would save the Municipal staff an immense amount of work and add considerably to their revenue. Unless the Baladiya are willing to remedy this defect there aoes not seem any obligation on us to assist them in collecting their dues from one class alone* Political Agent, Bahrai (7C’s. P.

You will recall that it was recently discovered that a member of the Manama Baladiya had not paid his Baladi/a taxes for 22 months, ‘ibis man far from being 1 a pauper was possessed of ample landed property which should have been distrained lon£ a:^o to meet the amount. Since,however,no application had oeen made to the ^ourt until the amount had been so long outstanding, the fault of this lay with the Municipality. I surest that a useful bye-law might be introduced to the effect that when a debt of more than Rs. 5 /- had been outstanding for 3 months the Secretary should lay the matter oefore the cc Limit tee for action and take their orders as to whether the individual v/as to be sued or not and that after the lapse of G months the debtor should bo sued automatically, unless the Committee by a resolution for any reason decide to cancel the debt. If you approve of this suggestion, perhaps you would write to the two Presidents suggesting that such a rule be passed. 0 Political Agent ^ Bahrain./ LS V/ JL Ju KJ Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Bated, Muharram 3, 1353 No. /S' of 1353 April 18, 1934 H.

On Friday th* 23ra November lb34 all the meat-sellers mane a strike ana aeciaea not to sell meat in the T Chabrak ! (meat-market) ana they actually aia so. They sat outsiae tne T Chabrah t near the iunir T s oilice where tney exposed their meat ior sale. The following aay they aia the same tning also but the Balaaeyah officials(by order of the Bahrain Govt.of course) collected all their meat, put it insiae the Chabran ana haa it sola to tne public cneaply say ks.l/4 ior a Ruba T instead of ks.l/ 8 . On Sunday the 35th November 1034 all the meat-sellers were taken before the Banrain Court where most of them were lined ns.Id/- each ior intiinging the local laws by selling meat in a place other than the T Chabrah T which^the only place for the sale of meat. The grounds of the meat-sellers ior doing so is purported in what follows:- Some of them pay rent of Annas 4/- a day,making ns.7/8 a month, others pay Annas b/- a day ana few others pay Annas 8 /- a day which comes to ns. 15/- a month. (The rents vary according to the importance oi the place occupiedj. This rent should invariably be paid no mattei if tne meat-sellers use the place always or oiten. They claim that this rate of fent is too high ana the present arrangement of payment is unsuitable ior them. In addition to the rent each of the meat-sellers also has to pay daily R^l /8 for the wages of the transport of the meat from the slaughter house to the f Ghabrah f . They claim that this charge is also too high. As regards the rent they v/ant to be treated line the meat-sellers of Muharraq. who, it is said, pay rent only for the aays on which they use the place but not otherwise The matter is still unsettled.

All other members of the Agency staff pay this tax in the usual way. 2 . The houses in question are privately owned and leased to the occupants by the landlords. 3. in the case of the Bahrain Government no exemption from municipal house tax is granted to any government servants except in the case of two houses which are the property of the Bahrain government, acquired by purchase. 4. 1 should be obliged if you would let me know what reply to give to the Baladiya.

Colonel Loch is of opinion that the resolution passed on 5tn June i933, whicn wts the subject of f Ilan No.7/1353 dated the 7th June 1^33 is objectionable not merely because it contra venes the previous resolution tfhich was approved by tne Political itgent, taat house taxes should be recovered from l?ndiorus and. not from the tenants but also because tne practice of collecting taxes from the tenants is very unusual ana is tne leasi satisiactory 'nctnou oi collecting nouse taxes. Tne present resolution was not referred to the Political Agent for approval, ' and cannot be countenanced • 4 In the specific cases mentioned in your D.O. referred to above tne further ruestion of extra-territorial rights ana privileges oi tne British subjects employed in this Agency also arises ana it is one which we should prefer to tvoia.
