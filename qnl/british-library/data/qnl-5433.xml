Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the Government of India’s letters of 21st August, 1935 ,No.F.76-a/ 34, of 20th May, 1936, No.F.238-A/35,and of 20th August,1936,No.F.410-A/35, regarding various items of expenditure incurred in excess of the fixed Office allowances and contract grants of certain posts in the Persian Gulf during 1932/33, 1933/34 and 1934/35. 2. The Secretary of State accords his sanction to the individual excesses specified in the three letters under reference, but, as stated in his letter of 13th August,1936, No.F.2114/36, he does-not consider that in future his specific sanction need be sought in the case of ordinary excesses,at posts where expenditure is borne entirely by Indian revenues; or at posts where expenditure is divisible between Indian and Imperial revenues, provided that the excess upon all office allowances so divisible does not exceed Rs.250.

Sir, With reference to jour letters Fo.F.195-A/35 and No. F.238-A/35 of the 22nd -august 1935 and the 26th March 1936, respectively, regarding the rules relating to office allowances and other contract grants in Iran and the Persian Gulf, I am directed by the Secretary of State in Council to inform you that he sanctions the proposal of the Government of India that temporary overdrafts not exceeding Rs.250 should no longer be adjusted against the ensuing years grants so long as sanction is still obtained in respect of excesses over that figure and unspent balances are not allowed to be carried over. He also agrees that the small excesses up to Rs.250 may be regularised by the Government of India according their ex post facto sanction to an addition to the contract grant for the year concerned. I am further to state that the Secretary of State in Council has no objection to the Government of India sanctioning^ without reference to him, ordinary additions to expenditure borne entirely by India in respect of the office allowances and contract grants in the case of the Bahrain and Muscat Agencies and also the Zahidan Trade Agency. He also agrees with the Government of India that the sanction of higher authority must be sought as soon as it becomes apparent that a grant fixed for any Agency or Consulate in Iran or the Persian Gulf is likely to be exceeded beyond the permissible limit of The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign &amp; Political Department.overdraft, but he considers that his specific sanction need only be obtained where the expenditure is divisible between the Indian and Imperial Governments and when the excess on all office allowance so divisible exceeds Rs,250. In this connection it is assumed, however, that the powers enjoyed by the Resident of re-appropriation from one grant to another are not applied as between posts where the expenditure is borne entirely by India and those where it is shared with the Imperial Government, In view of the above decisions, the submission by you of draft amendments, where necessary, to the Rules appended to the Central Audit Resolution, for the formal sanction of the Secretary of State in Council, will be awaited.

Sir I an directed to invite a reference to the letter from the India Office, No. P. 5112/27 dated the 8th March 1928, and to say that in viev of the considerations set out therein, the Government of India do not wish to press for an enhancement of their powers in respect of expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia.

The powers possessed by the Government of India in relation to expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia have not so far been incorporated in the Central Audit Resolution, and I am to sug;est that this nay now be done by the addition of the following as sub-rules (9) and (10) to rule 1 of the rules appended to the Resolution: — '(9) To any expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia except in the following cases (i) Fresh exoenditure on salaries up to an amount not exceeding £ 100 per annun in the aggre gate at any one Consulate, (ii) Increased expenditure on contingencies, except as regards an unusual item exceeding £ 100, and, ” (iii) Increased expenditure on travelling.V- • (10) To any addition to the office allowances and other contract grants of any Agency or Consulate in Persia, except temporary overdrafts not exceeding Rs. 250 at any Agency or Consulate, such overdraft 'being adjusted 'by debit against the contract grants sanctioned for the ensuing financial year.” 3.

I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- E. BURDON. SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.I think it is mostunlikely that the Treasury would agree to the Government of India having a free hand in the establishments , etc# under the latter 1 s control* Even if they did, the arrangement, as you say, would have to be reciprocal, and there seems room for doubt whether the (Jovernment of India would agree to the Treasury having a free hanl in the establidiments controlled by the Treasury, and I think we should have to consult them on the point before approaching the Treasury. But the chance of the Treasury agreeing seems so remote that - unless you think it worth' while to make a demi—official enquiry — it does not seem necessary to pursue the point* I suggest that the Government of Indian letter might be answered to the effect that as the necessity for the restrictions on their powers arises from the financial liability of the Treasury, the restrictions must stand and that a separate letter will be sent to them in regard to the amendment of the Central Audit Resolution (for which this Department will arrange if you will refer the papers later)* I understand that references to this Office necessitated by the existing restrictions are A /YA Jr ^ H\ infrequent.

Secretary, Political Dept., I agree that the real question is the difficulty of obtaining the assent of the Treasury to the grant of enlarged powers to the Government of India. But in view of your marginal remark that the references to this Office necessitated by the existing restrictions are unfortunately not infrequent, it would, I think, be worth while to makie an effort to obtain their concurrence* Since these restrictions were laid down the powers of sanction accorded to the Government of India in the case of ^seSe^utre met entirely from Indian revenues have been greatly extended, and apart from the necessity of obtaining Treasury sanction there is presumably no reason why the Government of India should not be granted at least much higher powers of sanction in Persia than they at present possess* To revert to a suggestion made by Mr. Turner in his note of 18th Dovember — it would be as well, would it not, before pursuing the matter with the Government of India, to find out unofficially from the Foreign Office whether the Treasury would be prepared to agree to a»- enhancement / 2014 5000 5/2enhancement of the present limits of expenditure which may be sanctioned by either Government without consulting the other* If this course were approved by the Secretary of State in Council, we might perhaps suggest to the Foreign Office, as a rough indication of what is in our minds — though it would be necessary to consult the Government of India and to lay the matter again before the Secretary of State in Council before approaching them officially, that the new limits might be something as follows:— (i) Fresh expenditure on salaries * Figure of £100 in present rule to be raised to say £500; (ii) Contingencie s« Figure of £100 in present rule to be raised to say £500; (iii) Efecersooo ovUr Contract Grants* Figure of Bs. 250 in present rule to be raised to Rs.1000. We on our side would have to be prepared of course to agree to a e'er responding extension of the powers possessed by the Foreign Office, but I can see no objection to this.

'ItUL- You will remember that we had some discussion on the question raised by the Government of India in the correspondence of which I enclose copies as to the relaxation of the existing restrictions on their powers in regard to expenditure on diplomatic and Consular services in Persia. The expenditure in question is, of course, equally divided between Imperial and Indian revenues, and the approval of the Treasury as as wel}/ of the Secretary of State for India would be necessary to any relaxation of the financial restrictions referred to by the Government of India. C So far as we are concerned r whilethe matter has not yet been formally considered by the Secretary of State in Council, we should I think probably be favourably disposed towards some relaxation ( and, as a coHreyary. to a corresponding relaxation of the existing restrictions on the financial powers of the Foreign Office), hot only^ar minor poift4^-do these restrictions at present necessitate a number of references home on points of no intrinsic importance, but,thi-s-. i a tiie basi s of o4- Indi a’ g proposal, since the&amp;e /rf i nrm' were laid down, the CXrjiZ' powers of sanction granted to^'theft in the case of expenditure made entirely from Indian revenues have been very greatly extended, and the eont-r-ol with their strictly circum scribed powers as regards diplomatic and consular expenditure is now very marked. But before we take the matter further, we are anxious if possible to find out through the Foreign Office whether the Treasury would if approached officially be disposed to agree to some extension of the present limits within which expenditure may be sanctioned by either Government without consulting the other. A very rough indication of the type of thing towards which our minds are working (specific proposals have not, of course, yet been considered by the Secretary of State in Council, and it would apart from this be necessary further to consult the Government of j India as well before raising the matter officially), is the following: (l) Fresh expenditur e - Salaries- Figure of £100 under present rule to be raised to, say, £500*Draft Paper.

Subject:- Powers of the Government of India in respect of expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia. Sir, I am directed to forward a copy of a letter from the Accountant General, Central Revenues, No.T#M.Genl./l7 of 27-28/1311, dated the 5th August 1927, in which he has raised certain questions as to the powers of the Government of India in regard to expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia* 2. The first point relates to the arrangement, at present in force, under which previous sanction of the Secretary of State is obtained for expenditure on such services except in the following* cases:- (i) Fresh expenditure on salaries up to an amount not exceeding* £100 per annum in the aggregate at any one consulate. (ii) Increased expenditure on contingencies, except as regards an unusual item exceeding £100, and (iii) Increased expenditure on travelling. The present practice is based on an agreement between His Majesty 1 s Treasury and the Foreign Office described in paragraph 3 of the Treasury letter No.5633-06, dated the 31st October 1906, a copy of which was forwarded to the India Office bv the Foreign Office with their letter No. 36866, dated the 10th December 1906.

As stated by the Accountant General, Central Revenues, the sanction of the Secretary of State is obtained to all excesses over the contract grants except temporary overdrawals not exceeding Rs 250. Secretary of State in Council that the Government of India should continue to obtain his previous sanction notwithstanding the fact that no restrictions in respect of the class of cases mentioned in the last two paragraphs have been imposed on their powers in the Central Audit Resolution; and, if so, whether he would be prepared to consider any proposals for the modification of the present arrangement in view of the larger powers now possessed by them to sanction other expenditure from the central revenues. t pondence ending with the Secretary of State f s Despatch No. 'jthis connection. 4.

Rub i«ot: - Powers of the Government of Indie in raspect of ex penditure on Diplomatic and Consular Services m Parsi 0 . I have the honour to state that from a note bv the Financial in Recretarv dated 24th June 1908/the Foreign Department Proceeding Frontier B.Julv 1908, No. 441 (as incorporated in a manual of this office^ it appears that the following items of expenditure may be sanctioned bv the Government of Indie without the concurrence of His Meiftstv’s Secretary of State for India:- (a^ Fresh expenditure on saleries up to an amount not exceeding £100 per annum in the a^greerate at anv post under its control (M Increased expenditure on contingencies except as regards an unusual item exceeding £100/- (c) Increased expenditure on travelling*. If a project of expenditure is outside those limitations the previous sanction of the Secretary of State should be obtained. It is observed that in accordance with the above note the sanction of the Secretary of State is still obtained whenever anv expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular services in Persia exceeds the limits prescribed above# 2. A guestion has however arisen whether these old orders hold gpod after the introduction of the Reforms and the issue of the revised orders defining* the financial powers of the Governor General in Council as incorporated in the new Book of Financial powers and should still be acted upon. I beg* to observe that the charges in India on account of the Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia, though borne in rak moieties between the Indian and Home Governments are debited in the first instance entirely to Indian (Central) Revenues and budget provision for the entire charge is made in the India estimates, the recoveries from the HomeHome (rovernment bein^ made through the usual-annual statements. It appears therefore that the rules in the Book of financial Powers, which define the classes of expenditure from Central Revenues upon subjects other than provincial, which the Governor General in Council mav not sanction without the previous consent of the Seoretarv of State in Council, will also regulate ex penditure on Diplomatic and Consular »Services in Persia. As in the Book of Financial Powers no special restrictions have been laid down on the powers of the Governor General in Council in respect of expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular services in Persia, the presumption is that the sanction of the Secretarv of State is not reouired as contemplated in the Financial Secretarv 1 s note dated 24th June 1908 referred to above unless such sanction (viz of the Racretarv of State in Council) is necessarv under the rules contained in the Book of Finajmciil Powers. This view is based on the orders contained in the last sentence of paragraph 1, Part I of the Book of Financial Powers to the effect that these rules (i.e. rules in the appendix to Part I, Book of Financial Powers relating to expenditure bv the Government of India on subjects other than provincial) supersede all previous rules of a similar nature and, subject to their observance, orders regarding specific cases of expenditure passed bv the Secretarv of State in Council under regulations previouslv in force will no longer be binding. I shall be obliged if Government will kindlv let me know if mv presumption is correct. If on the other hand it is held that sanction of the Secretarv of State is still required (as such sanction is being actuallv obtained) whenever any item of expenditure on the Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia exceeds the limit referred to in the Financial Secretary’s note dated 24th June 1908, I would request that the advisability of incorporating these orders in the Book of Financial Powers and amending the rules defining the powers of the Governor General in Council may kindly be considered■ft by the Government of India and a oopy of their orders on the subject communicated to this office. 3. In this connection I would also observe that all excesses over and increases of the contract grants in the Persian Gulf reouire the sanction of the Secretary of State as these grants were fixed with his approval, the only exception being that the office allowances and other contract grants may be overdrawn bv jthe Consular Officers and Political Agents up to a limit of Rs 250/— in each case, the overdrafts being adjusted by debit against the contract grants for the next financial year. I would request that it may be considered bv the Govern ment of India whether under the rules in the Book of Financial Powers the sanction of the Secretary of State is still required to the above excesses. If so, the question of modifying the rules in the Book of Financial Powers may also be kindly considered.No.142(13)-^ From To His Majesty’s Under Secretary of State lor Inaia, I am directed to report tor tne information of His to curtailing inter-departmental correspondence on petuy cases, tne Government of India have decided that the Foreign and Political Department shall exercise power to sanction expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia ,etc., witnout tne usual reference to the Finance Department of the Government of India, witnin tne limits specified below. viz: - (a) Recurring expenditure not exceeding Rs # 200 per annum in any individual case, and (b) Non-recurring expenditure not exceeding Rs.1,01.0 in any individual case.
