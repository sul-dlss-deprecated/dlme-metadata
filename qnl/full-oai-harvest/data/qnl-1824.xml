The Shaikh's action was an expression of sympathy with moves by the League of Nations to end Italy's war in Abyssinia.The principal correspondents are the Political Agent, Bahrain (Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch); the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven William Fowle); officials of the Government of Bahrain; the Government of India; and the Foreign Office.The papers cover: discussion of the Shaikh's decision by the Political Agent, Bahrain and the Political Resident, the practical effects of which were thought to be 'small' (folios 2-6); the decision to defer an approach to other Gulf rulers to see if they wished to show sympathy (folios 7-10); instructions in the matter from the Government of India, which were that rulers of Gulf states should be advised to apply sanctions simultaneously with member states of the League of Nations (folios 11-26); the Political Resident's advice that it would be best not to approach other Gulf rulers, and to annul the Shaikh's proclamation, as the moves would be seen in Italy as an attempt by the British to inspire hostility in countries outside the British Empire, and copies of relevant notices (
                           alans) issued by the Government of Bahrain (folios 27-43); and correspondence concerning the lapse of the prohibition following the end of hostilities between Italy and Abyssinia (folios 44-47).The Arabic language content of the file consists of four folios, mainly copies of bilingual Arabic and English notices issued by the Government of Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>League of Nations</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Italy</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Economic sanctions</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000383#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000383#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000383#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
