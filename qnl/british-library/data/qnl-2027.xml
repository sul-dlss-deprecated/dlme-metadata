To begin therefore : Upon thurfdaji the 19 o£ January, having difpatch'd and taken order for what was needful, a little before day, after the difcharge of fome Guns,, as 'tis the cuftome at goitigoff from any Coaft, we began leifurely to difplay our fails, moving but (lowly, becaufe we waited for the fhip- / boat which was ftill atfhore , upon whofe return we unfolded sf all our Canvafejand though w;th a fmall gale 3 direded our courfe a . between the Iflands of Ormuz and Kefom, paffing on the outer ^ &amp;rmuZf next drabiat in regard the fhallownefs of the . 7 ^ fh towards ?tr{ia afforded not water enough for fuch great | / v Ships as ours. We were in company only two Englifh Ships, namely, the Whale, which was the Captain-fhip, (in which I was embarqu'd ) commanded by Captain Nicholas Woodcock^, and another call'd the Dolphin, which had for Captain , Ma tter Matthew Willis, At noon j being near Lareck^, and no wind ftirring , we caft Anchor without falling our fails, and our Captain fent his long boat aftiore to Lareck^, with two Grey-hounds which the Englifh of Conthru had given him ? to catch what game they could light upon. Towards night we fet fail again 5 but though the wind fomewhat Increas'd, yet becaufe the^ boat was not return'd we ftruck fail a little, and ftaid for it, difcharging alfo (everal mufket-fhots, to the end thofe that were in it might hear and fee where we were : And becaufe 'twas one a clock in the night, and the Boat was not yet ^ome,we doubted fome difafter might have befaln it,in regard of M y the multitude of thofe Arabian Thieves call'd Nonteks, which ' u P on ^at Sea 5 and frequently refide in this Ifland of Lareck, : Yet at length it return'd fafe and found, and brought us abun dance of Goats ^ whereupon wc again fpread our fails freely to the wind, which was pretty ftiff, although not much favour- able to our courfe. However, we went onwards, ph W from e coafl: Arabia to that otPerJia 5 and on Saturday morning, as we drew near the Arabian ftiore, we faw three fmall liknds ntuate near one another, and not far from a certain Cape, the name of which, and the Iflands, they could not tell me, fo as that might let it down truly 5 whereby I perceiv'd how it comes to at . name ?P^ces in thefe parts are very corruptly ^ ln eo 8 ra .pkical Charts 5 for in the Countries themfelves, i 6 c ° miTle ^ c f 18 had for the moft part with rude and ignorant P pe, few of them know how to pronounce the fame aright.

He related how he found this horn in the earth, being probably the horn of fome Animal dead there 5 and that when it was intire it was between five and fix feet long, and feven inches in cir cumference at the root, where it was thickeft. The piece which I faw ('for the horn was broken, and fold by pieces in feveral places) was fomething more then half a fpan long, and little lefs then five inches thick j the colour of it was white, inclining to yellow, like that of Ivory when it is old 5 it was hollow and fmooth within, but wreath'd on the outfide. The ^ ^ Captain faw not the Animal, nor knew whether it were of the ^ i ^ ^ land or thefea, for according to the place where he found itj ^ ^ ^ it might be as well one as the other: but he believ'd, for certain, ^ ^ that it was of a Unicorn, both becaufe the experience of its being X ^ good againft poyfon argu'd fo much, and for that the fignes at- S* 4. tributed by Authors to the Unicorn s horn agreed alfo to this^ as he conceiv'd. But herein I dilient from him, inafmuch as, if I remember aright, the horn of the Unicorn, whom the Greeks caird MonoceroS) is by Tliny defcrib'cHbtlack, and not white. The Captain added that it was a report, that Unicorns are found in certain Noithern parts of America^ not far from that Country of Greenland $ and fo not unlikely but that there might be fome alfo in Greenland, a neighbouring Country, and not yet known whether it be Continent or liland 5 and that they might fome- timescome thither from the contiguous lands oiAmerica, m cafe it be no iQand. This Country of Greenland is of late difcovery 5 ^ v and the firft Chriftian that difcover'd it, or went thither, was this Captain Woodcock^, in the year above-mention'd; and he / //S y gave it the name of Greenland upon this account, becaule where- v J ^ as the other Northern Countries thereabouts are deftitute of ^ . s? - y * grafs, ( wk ace the white Bears and Wolves which inhabit _ 0 | them live u hA dead Whales and other like things) he found this ^ green and full of Grals^ although it be always cover'd over with &gt; ^ Snow 5 fo that when the Animals there mind to feed,they hollow ^ ^ ' the fnow with their feet, and eafilyfind the grafs which is kept ^ ^ continually fre(h under the (ame. The Engli(h now yearly fail ^ / thither , where they take abundance of Whales, and fome ^ vaft, that when they open the mouth, the widenefs is above three Geometrical paces, or fifteen foot over. Of the(e Whales the Englilh make Oyle , drawing it onely out of the fat of their paunch 5 and they make fuch plenty, that out of one fingle B 3 Whale,The Travels Peter Delia Valle, 0 / ' £&lt;s / j&lt;- .

This Greenland 1 by what Captain Woodcock^ law, who dif- cover'd it 3 from the end of feventy fix degrees, to feventy eight and a half, (the cold not fuffering him to go further) was un-inhabitedj he not having found any perfon there but only wild beafts of many forts. The Company of the Greenland Merchants of England had the horn which he found, becaufe Captains of fhips are their ftipendiaries, and, befides their (alary, muft make no other profit of their Voyages 5 but whatever they gain or find, in cafe it be known, and they concealit not, all accrues to the Company that employes them. When the Horn was in- tire, it was fent to Conjiantinople to be fold, where two thoufand pounds Sterling was offer'd for it: But the Englifti Company hoping to get a greater rate fold it not at Conft ant maple, but font it into Mufcovy 3 where much about the fame price was bidden for it^ which being refus'd , it was carry'd back into Turkey, and fell of its value ^ a much lefs fum being now proffer'd then before. Hereupon the Company conceiv'd, that it would foil more eafily in pieces, then intire ^ becaufe few could be found who would purchale it at fo great a rate. Accordingly they broke it, and it was fold by pieces in fundry places 5 yet for all this, the whole proceed amounted onely to about twelve hun dred pounds Sterling. And ofthefo pieces they gave one to the Captain who found it, and this was it which he IhewM me. On the 2 5. of January, failing in the main Sea with the prow of the Ship South Eaft and by Eaft 5 and, as I conceive, at a good diftance from the Country of Macron, (which I conje$:ure to be part either of the ancient Caramania, oveKeoiGedrofia, and at this day having a Prince of its own, lyes upon the Sea Coaft between the States of the Perjian and thofe of the Moghol) we difcern'd behind us three or four Ships which feem'd to be Frigots or Galliots, but towards Evening we loft fight of them. The fame day, and the other before, began to be foen in the Sea abundance of certain things, which I took to be Snakes, or at leaft fifties in the form of Snakes, being exadHy of the form of large Eeles, long and round^ and according to the motion^)f the water leem d crooked as they floated along the Sea. Neverthe- lefs demanding of intelligent perfons what they were, I under- Itood that they were neithei; thofe Animals, nor yet living things, but onely a kind of excrement of the Se^, that iliape, Tv? 1 u l rno ^ on ? ^ av i n g what the agitated water gave it 5 al though by realon of the motion of the fliip they feem'd to move contrary to us, whilft we faw them left behind. And they told me, that the nearer we came to India, we (hould fee more of thele things. The next Evening, our Captain, who was a little more merry then ordinary, (becaufe, the Captain of the Dolphin mmg with us that day, he had drank pretty freely in conver- atiorp difcourfing with me, as he was wont, after Supper, fpoke trankly to me concerning their affairs of Or muz, ; In conclu- fion✓ Intothe EAST-INDIES. fion he told me 9 that their Treaty with the Terftans ftood thus 5 That if they would deliver to the Englifti theFortrefs of Ormuz^ with half the revenues of the Cuftom-houfe and the City, as they defir'd from the beginning 5 then the Englifh would people OrmuK, and reftore the trade as formerly;, keeping the fame con tinually open with Verfta, 5 and that for this purpofe, and alfo for guarding that Sea againft the Portugals and other Enemies, they ' - ^ ss would keep four (hips in That when this were agreed / j y , upon, the Englifh would tranfport a good number of people from England^ and whole Families with Wives and Children, to dwell in OrmuK, as the Portugah did before : and then they ✓ v would profecute the War againft the Portngals at Mafchat^ and every where elfe. But if thefe things were not agreed to, they ^ would make War no longer againft the Fortugals ^ nor car'd they for theTraffick of Perjiaupon other terms. Nowfhould thefe Treaties take effed 3 they would in no wife be advantagious for the Catholick Religion 5 and were there no more to be fear'd, the Portugals would thereby be for ever excluded from recovering 5 yea, all the reft which they poffefs in tho(e parts would be in great danger. Imanculi Beig^ who was Ge neral of the Perfiansin the late W 7 ars,and with whom theEnglifti treated in Comhru concerning this affair. Captain Woodcock^ faid 5 - inclin'd to the bargain 5 but it was not known what the of Sciraz, and ( which is more important) the King would do. On one fide, I know, the Persians infifted much upon having Or muz wholly to themfelves 5 accounting it a fmall matter to have gain'd, with fb much War, and lofs of men, onely the half, or rather lefs then half, the Fortrefs being deducted which the Englifh demanded for themfelves; fo that the Perfians would have but the fame intereft there as the King of Ormuz had with the Portugals^ and no more. They conceive alfb, that they have done little, and perhaps ill, fhould they make no greater acqui- fition, in having onely chang'd the Portugals in Ormuz for the , Englifh, and Chriftiansfor Chriftians* that upon eafier terms it might be hop'd, that perhaps the Portugals, after the lofs of Orribz, would agree with the Perfians , now there was no more to lofe, and onely give the Perfians that which the King of Or muz, a Mahometan like themfelves, injoy'd. Moreover, to the Perjian, no doubt, the friendfhip of the Portugals would be more profitable, m regard of the many States which they poflefs in India, from whence they may with more facility and certainty maintain the accuftomed Commerce with Perfia. But, on the other fide, to fee the Portugals fo worfted, and the Englifh more fortunate, at leaft, and couragious, if not more ftrong, 'tis a clear cafe that Or muz will never be reinhabited, nor Trade fet onfoot again, unlefs fome Nation of the Franks, which have fhips and . y ftrength at fea,refide there(thing8 which the Perjidns wholly want^ y there being neither Mariners nor Timber in Fe^,about that Sea, wherewith to build fhips) and the lofs refulting toPerfia by the ^ €3?rThe Travels of Peter Delia Valle, //' '/ $ A m tinguifliingof this Traffick 5 the charge of maintaining the Fortrefs of Ormwz, without any profit3and the continual danger 01 lofing it every hour, unlefs the Englifh guard the Sea with their (hips and help to defend it 5 thefe and other like confiderations may not im probably induce the King of Fer/w(contented to have demonftra- ted his power and valor, and chaftis'd his Enemies 5 the Portugals, according to his defire^ to grant the Englifh as much as they de mand : For he (hould not yield it to them upon force, but out of his liberality 5 and for his own profit give them that freely 3 which to retain to himfelf, as things now ftand, would notonelybeof no advantage, but of lofs. Peradventure he may alfo imagine now, in the pride of his vidory, that as with help of the Englifli he has driven the P^rtag^Z/outof 5 fo 'twill be eafie for him to expel the Englifh too, eitherby the help of others, or elfe by his own Forces alone, fhould they not comply with him. However, becaufe thefe Treaties with the Ferfhw are manag'd by the Company, of Merchants who alfo made the War, and not by the King oiEngland 5 and hitherto 'tis not known, whe ther their King approve the fad: or no, and will profecute or let fall the enterprize &gt; therefore, for a total conclufion, befidcs the confent of the King of Verfta^ they alio wait the determination of the King of England ^ and the greateft hope I have of the defeat ing of thefe projects fo prejudicial to the Catholicks, is this - alone, that the Englifh King will not meddle in them, and, per haps alfo, prohibit hisSubjeds fo to do 5 as a perfon w T hom we ^^^know to be a Friend to Peace, moft averfe from all kind ot War 5 specially, with the King of Spain ^while the Match of his Son with the Daughter of Spain is in agitation, In the mean time we began to find the Sea fufficiently rough, being got wholly out of the Perfian Gulph, and enter'd into the open Sea, (term'd by the Ancients Mare rubrum^nd by us at this day the Southern Ocean ) and having pafs'd not onely the Cape of Giafck ^t ,DUt a lfo that of Arabia^ which the Forth gals vulgarly ' y/vV czWRejalgate^ as it is a^fet down in the Maps 5 byt properly 'y ought to be call'd Kas elhad^ which in the Arabian Tongue fig- rnhes Capo del fine, or the Cape of the Confine, becaufe'tig the s/ , j a ^ 0 f t ]^ at; Country, and is further then any other extended in to the Sea 5 like that of Galicia in our Europe , which for the fame re^fon we call Finis Terr#, On Saturday, the 28. of Janu ary, havmg taken the meridional altitude of the Sun, according to daily cuftom, and made fuch detraction of degrees as was ne- cellary s we found our felves twenty three degrees five minutes diftant from the Equinodial towards the North: whence by confequence we had pafs'd the Tropick of Cancer twenty fix mi nutes and a half, according to the opinion of the Moderns, who reckon the Sun's greateft declination where the Tropicks are, twenty three degrees thirty one minutes and a half diftant from the Equinodial.

Every day about the hour of noon the Sun's altitude was infallibly obfervd , not onely by the Pilots;, as the cuftom is in all {hips, and the Captain, (who was a good Seamanj and perform'd all the exercifes of Art very well) but ( which pleas'd me moft 3 and which I thought worthy of great praife and imitation J there was no day, but at that hour twenty or thirty mariners;, mafters, boys, young men, and of all forts came upon the deck to make the fame obfervation &gt; fomewith Aftrolabes, others with Crofs-ftaffs, and others with feveral other inftruments, particularly with one which they told me was lately invented by one and from his name call d ^17cf*? David' s-Jiaff. This Inftrument confifts of two Triangles united together, one longer then the other, both having their bafe arch'd, and between them in the circle of their bafes containing ' an intire quadrant of ninty degrees. But whereas the fhorteft Triangle, whole Angles are lefs acute ^ contains fixty degrees divided by tens ( according to cuftom) in the circle of its bafe, which are two thirds of a quadrant, the other longer and of acuter Angles, which extends much backward, and opens in a wider circle at the bafe,comprehends no more then thirty, which make the remainder of the quadrant 5 fo that the longer Triangle contains fewer degrees by half then the fhorter j and he that would have the degrees larger for the better Subdividing them into minutes, may make the circle or bafe of the leffer Triangle take up feventy degrees, and fo there will remain to the longer no more then twenty for the complement of the quadrant. Ac cording to this diftribution, the degrees in the longer Triangle will come to be fo large, as to be capable of the fmalleft divifion of minutes ^ a thing very important. Befides, it hath two Fanes or Sights, in each Triangle one, which are to be mov'd back ward and forward ^ and with thefe, that is, with that of the long Triangle, the level of the Horizon is taken 5 and with the other of the fhort Triangle, that of the Sun 5 with this fur ther conveniency, that the Sights being lufficiently large, are therefore very expedient for performing the operation with fpeedj notwithftanding the dancing of the fhip when the Sea is rough 5 in which cale^if the Sights be toofmall 5 Vis hard to make any obfervation. With this Inftrument, and feveral others, many of the Englifti perform'd their operations every day 5 fuch as knew not how to do them well, were inftruded^ and if any one err'd in computation or otherwife,his error was (hew d him, and the reafon told him, that fb he might be train d to work exactly : The opinion of the fkilful was heard, and taken notice of 3 and at length all the obfervations being compar d together, the Pilot and the Captain refolv'd, and with mature counfel de~ termin'd ofall by which means their voyages are very well manag'd, and almoft always fucceed profperoufly to them. In the Portugal fhips I hear the contrary comes to pafs 5 becaule the Pilots being extremely jealous of their affairs (an habitual1 /) It V- TheTravels of Peter Delia Valle, humour of that Nation) will be alone to make their obfervati- ons 5 and for the moft part perform them in fecret, without any Aflociate to fee them : Should any other perfon in the (hip offer to take the altitude of the Sun, or look upon theMaporCom- pafs, or do any thing that relates to the well guiding of the VeP fel, and knowing its courfe 5 they would quarrel with him 5 and by no means fuffer him to do it 5 being averfe that any other fhould meddle with what they fay is their office and belongs to them alone* From their being fo little communicative, and very averfe to teach others, it happens that few amongft them un- derftand any thing of the Art of Navigation, there being none that will teach it experimentally, and they underftand little enough, becaufe they have no conference about the practical part, and learn much lefs of the Theory. This is the reafbn that their (hips frequently mifcarry, to the incredible detriment both of particular perfonsandof the Kingdom : And which is worfe, 'tis faid that not onely many of them are loft through the ignorance or negligence of thofe that guide them, but alfo fometime by malice ; For the Portugal Pilots have got a cuftom when they are to make a Voyage, to take up great fums of mo ney at Lisbon upon intereft, the moft they can get to trade with- alU and they take the fame by way of Venture upon thefhips which they guide: Now when by the way any fmall difafter befalls them, they not onely avoid it not, as many times they might do , but, if they be of evil intention, they cunningly run the (hips aground either in thefe Coafts of Africa or elfewhere 3 fo that though oftentimes the people, and aifo the arms, goods, efpecially of the greateft value be lav'd, yet (b it is, that fbme- times many perifti or fuffer exceffive lofs, and this onely to the end, that the fhipwrack may be the occafion gf their remaining gainers of the monies taken up at intereft upon the hazard afore- laid 5 which monies they carry not with them to trade withall 3 but leave all at home in Portugal: A practice indeed very per nicious, and which ought to be moft rigoroufly punifti'd : but the Portugals have now no King in their Country to mind their affairs, and the government depends upon Madrid, whei^ per haps they that adminifterit, being more intent upon their pri vate interefts then the publick, thefe and infinite other dilbr- ders pafs unredrefs'd. The Englifh, on the contrary, and other Europeans which fail upon the Ocean, are moft diligent and ftrift obfervers of all exadt difcipline, and of what concernes the good conduft of their (hips 5 and becaufe they well under ftand all the moft exquifite points of Navigation, and are ex tremely curious, as well in the Praftice as in the Theory, they ipare no pains, and negled not the doing of any thing whereby they may render their Navigations in all places more eafie and (ecure : Infomuch that Captain upon occafion of his having ftaid a year and odd moneths with his (hip in the Perfian Gulph, (hew'd me a Chart or Plat-form of the whole Streight ofleir obfetv !t ' 1 . 1the Vef. ! ,thhim &gt; and pother aDdb Sto ''ve.andva ^gfttben,^. , re ^''gnone Offend little praffical is the reafon detriment And which is : loft through ^m 5 butalfo ^otacuftom ufumsofmo* to trade with- ipon thelhips rmalldifafter y times they unningly tun or elfewherej ;arms 3 goods, isjthat fome- sonely to the sir remaining hazard afore- radewithall, ;ed very per- unifti'd; but ) mind their ij wheieper son their pri- e otber dilor- ry, and other diligent and iat concerned r well under- andare ex- beory, tbey ing whereby ore eaiie sua ccafionofhis intbePerto hole Street of Mo the EAST-INDIES. /&gt; of Or muz,, made by himfclf during that time with the higbeft exadncfs 5 for he had not onely taken the moft )ufl: meafures and diftan&lt;ies of all the adjacent places 3 but alfo founded all the Coaft with a plummet, to find all the convenient places where great fhips, fuch as theirsj might ride and caft anchor when occafion fhould require. On the Third of February&gt; conceiving by our reckoning that we were near India, in the Evening we let down the plummet into the Sea, as we us'd often to do, and found it not above fe- venteen fathom 5 whereby 'twas concluded;, that we were little more then fix leagues diftant from land, although by reafon of the darknefs of the Air none could be yet difcern'd 5 becaufe that precife depth of water ufes to be found in thofeSeasat thatdi- ftance from land. The Captain, who by well obferving the Sun and the Winds, had every day diligently noted the (hips way in the Map, as the cuftom is, hop'd that we might be near the City of Daman, which lies within the Gulph ot Cambaia, on the right hand as you enter into it, a good way inwards; hutl g j without having fo much minded the Maps, laid, that I conceiv d ^ &gt;&gt;/ we were much lower,and more without the Gulph towards Baf- fain-j becaufe although we had always fail'd and kept the (hips prow direded to Daman by the fhorteft line, yet for the two or three laft dayeswe had had the Wind for that place contrary 5 which although it hinder'd us not from holding our courfe;, be caufe we help'd our felves.with tjpe rudder,and fiding of the fails, yet the violence of the Wind muft needs have continually driven the (hip (bmething lower then we intended. Two hours after midnight, the current of the Gulph of Cambaia being con trary , againft which, by reafon of its impetuofnefs, there is no failing for a while, but the (hip muftftay either for the turning of it, Cwhich is known when it will happen, becaufe it regularly changes according to the hours and days of the Moon) or for a ftrong Wind wherewith to mafter the current 5 for this reafon 5 and alfo that the day-light might refolve us in what place we were- we caft anchor, and ftruk fail, to wait for a more fitting time. The Sea in this place began to be very rough, which happens by reafon of the ftrong current which it hath. The next Morning we difcernd land afar o(f, and, according to my conjecture, it appear'd that we were lowfer, that is, more to th^ South of Daman about twelve leagues, in a place a little diftant from Bajfain, which the Engliih call Terra di San Giovanni, but in the Sea-Chart is noted in the Portugal Tongue with the name of llhas das vaccas, or the Ijlands of Cows, About one a clock in the Afternoon, the Tide being become lefs contrary, we fet lail again by degrees, approaching ftill nearer the (bore oiIndia, But a little before Night the current turning againft us, we were oonftrain'd to caft anchor onfcemore* neverthele(s after mid- night it became favourable again, and we fail d onwards by de grees till day. This flow courfe through the Gulph of Ci h. The Travels of Peter Delia Valle, with the plummet always in hand, and founding every hour, it was requifite for us to hold, becaufe the place is dangerous, in regard of the many (helves or quick-fands which are in it* and efpecially becaufe the current, which turns every fix hours, now fetting one way, and anon the other, caufes great hindrance. By reafon of which (helves, from the time of our entrance into theGulph, we did not guide the (hip diredly towards Surht, which no doubt would have been the (horteft way by a ftrait line, but keeping lower towards Daman^ fetch'd a large compafs to the South, tacking about afterwards to the North when we were near land , onely to avoid the many (helves and (hallows, through which our great (hips could not pafs. On Sunday^ the the fifth of February, being at anchor in the Morning , we dif- cover'd near the land, which was not very (ar from us, ten or fifteen Frigots or Galliots failing Eaftwards^ which probably were either Portugal or Indian Merchants of fome Cafila, (as they ; / ; J/ call a Fleet or Confortof (hips ) coming from Cambaia to go to Goa, or fome other place thereabouts. The night following, we heard the report of Artillery, which we conceiv'd to come from the City of Daman, being the place nearefl us. Wednefday night after, the Wind blew fomewhat hard againft us, in regard whereof, and the ftrength of the current which carry'd us in that narrow chanoel amongft (helves and quick-fands, we fail'd for a good while very circumfpedly,and not without fome danger.On Thurfday we flood right a^ainft the mouth of the River of which City is not fituate upon the fhore, but fome leagues within land : And becau(e there is no ftation there for great (hips, we continued failing Northwards to the place where is the Port moft frequented by the (hips of Europe which though thebeft of all that Coaft, yet the Veflelsot that Country, not knowing fo well how to fteer, make not much ufe of it, becaufe the entrance is a little difficult. On Fry day the tenth of Febru ary, in the Afternoon, the favour of the current failing us, we caft anchor in fight of the Port of Surat at alittle diftance ^ and our boat going a .fhore, the Prefident of the Englifh Merchants (who ufesto refide in Snrat, and is fuperintendentof all^heir Trade in Eafi-Jndia^Terjia^With the other places depending on the ame, is now one Mr, Thomas Rajiel) perceiving our (hips near, and being at that time at the Sea-fide near the landing place, came in our boat to the (hips 3 together with one of their Minifters, Uo they cail thofe who exercife the office of Priefts) and two ot er Merchants 5 and after a collation and a fupper lodged with us all night.

We arriv'd at the City in good time, in the entrance of which there is a River call'd Tapi^oxTaptl^which was to be pafs'd over by boat: On the other fide of which River, fomething on the right hand as you go into the City, which hath no walls, ftands a Caftle lately built, but very ill defign'd. Moreover, near the place where the boats land ftands the Dogana^ or Cuftom-houfe, and it took us up fome time to difpatch there, becaufe they obferve very narrowly all goods that are brought in, ( although they be but Clothes for change) to fee whether there be any thing coming to the Cuftomes, nor will they fuffer ftrangers to enter till they be firft known and have licence, as 3 tis alfo praftis'd in Venice, In all things they proceed with fo great warinels and good order, that it being known that I conduced with me the Sig ra Mariuccia , although a girl very young, the Capo, or Prefident of the Dogana, requir'd likewife to be inform'd of her quality, and gave order that fhe (bould not be conduced with any violence or other diforder: otherwife, in lawful things, there is no difficulty, either through diverfity of Religion 5 or upon any other account. We were no fooner come to the Dogana.) but the news of our arrival was, I think, by Sig: Al berto's means, carried to the Houfe of the Dutch, many of which have Wives there which they married in India, purpofely to go with them and people a new col ony of theirs in ^ava Majoir^hich. they call Batavia Nova 5 where very great priviledges are granted to fuch of their Country-men as (hall go to live there with Wives and Families : For which end, many of them, for want of Eur ropasan, have taken Indian, Armenian, and Syrian Women, and of any other race that falls into their hands, lb they be or can be made Chriftians. Laft year the Fleet of the Portugals which went to India was encountred at Sea, and partly funk, partly taken by the Hollanders^ amongft other booty, three Maidens were taken, of thofe poor but' ^ell defcended Orphans which ^ are \^pnt to be lent from Portugal every year at the King's charge , with a dowry which the King gives them, to the end they may be married in India, in order to further the peopling of the Portugal Colonies in thofe parts. Thefe three Virgins fal ling into the hands of the Hollanders, and being carry'd to Surat^ which is the principal feat of all their traffick, the moft eminent Merchants amongft them ftrove who fhould marry them, being all paffably handfome. Two of them were gone from Surat, whether to the abovefaid Colony, or elfewhere, I know not. She that remain'd behind was czWd Donna Lucia, a young Woman, fair enough, and Wife to one of the wealthieft and eminenteft , r* y y J Hollanders. The Prefident of the Hollanders cali'd by them the Commendator, who refides in Surat, and has the general fuperintendency of their affairs in all thefe parts of the Eaft, is at 7 7 y /z ; this time Sig: Pietro VandeHhlreeckey a Gentleman of good breed -^^j^^A Ing, mS&amp; .v-t 14 ThsT^TifVels of Petct Delia Vallc, ing 5 and very courteous ^ he fpeaks no Italian, but SpaniOi very well, as being born zt Antwerp : He lives in a goodly Palace, which hath many diftindt apartments,with feveral entrances into a Court, like fo many different houfes, qnely included within the fame wall, which is entred into by one great Gate : Here the Commendator holds the beft and largeft apartment to himfelf, in the reft lodge fome of their graveft Merchants^Vhich are of the Council for management of affairs, in order to their better conveniency and union , befides many others of inferior con- dition,which live out of this great inclorure,difpers 3 d elfewhere in the City, and when occafion requires, they all repair to the Pa lace of the Commendator. Amongft thofe whofe habitation was in the Palace of the Commendator, Donna. Lucia's Husband has one of the principal, where he lives with his family and and Wife, whom,according to the cuftom otlndia, he maintains with much fplendor and gallantry.- Now upon their knowledge ot our arrival. Donna Lucia prefently fent her coach to bring Sig: Mariuccia to her houfe, for her better accommodation with her, till we had fetled out bufinefs, and provided lodgings. I was well pleas'd with the motion, becaufe till I had welt accommodated my felf with a place of refidence, the Sig: Marinccia could not be better difpos'd of then with this Portugal Gentlewoman, who is a Chriftian, and withal fecretly a Catholick, with the privity and connivance of her Hufband , although in publick fhe makes a virtue of neceffity, and in appearance conformes to the unhap py mode of that Nation, into whofe power the fortune of war and the difafter of her Country-men hath brought her. Sig: Al berto Scilling^ had,before we came from the Sea-fide, importun'd me in the name of the Commendator to lodge at his houfe &gt; which favour I much thank'd him for, and handfbmely declin'd, not thinking fit to accept it, becaufe I had receiv'dand wav'd the like invitation made to me before by the Englilh Prefident, who thought me the more oblig'd to comply with his offer, be caufe I came in their Ships : But I excus'd my felf both to the Commendator and the Prefident 5 partly, becaufe I was defirous to be at liberty by my felf, and partly,for that it was requifite for Sig: Mariuccia to be amongft Women, of which there was none in the Englilh Houfe. Being got quit of the Cuftom-houfe, I went to fee for a Houfe 5 and becaufe I was a new comer, and and had no leryantthat knew the City, I referr'd my felf to the direction of Sig: Alberto, who took this care upon himfelf, and foon after told me he had fent to get one prepar'd and put in good orders But by what I found afterwards, hehad contriv'd with the Dutch Commendator onely to delude me 5 for as he was car rying me to the place where he pretended to have taken a Houfe for me, he made me pafs by the Palace of the Hollanders, out of the Gate whereof a Gentleman belonging to the Commen dator ftep'd forth, and invited me in his name to alight from my ^Horfe, and at leaft ftay and dine with him that day, the rather becaufe ■Into the EAST -INDIES. , 15 becaufe S^Mariuccin was therejtelling me that it was not conve nient for me wait in the ftreets undecently and tediouily, whilft a Houfe was preparing for me elfewhere, which could not be done fo fpeedily. Notwithftairding which reafons, I endeavour'd all that pofTibly I could to decline this invitation 3 out of refped: to the Engliih Prefident 3 and with affeftionate thanks defir'd the Gentleman toexcufe me to the Sig r Commendator, ftraining my felf to cortefpond to his courtefie with the bell: Comple ments I had : But this avail'd me little , for as I was haftening to break off the difcourfe and be gonej the Commendator him- felf came forth into the ftreet half undrefs'd as he was in the houfe, and taking hold of my Horfe's bridle, told me that he would by no means fuffer me to go any where elfe now it was late without certain quarters 5 at leaft, I mull: needs ftay and dine with him that day. Beholding him thus on foot before me, I alighted in civility from my Horfe, and with the beft words I could, endeavour'd to get quit from the courteous violence which he us'd to me : But there was no remedy 5 he held me pri- foner, as I may fay, and I was fain to ftay dinner with him as he defir'd. Moreover, when night came, being I was refolv'd to lodge in another Houfe of mine own, under pretext that none could be got though fought for all day, (wherein I know not whether Sig r Alberto deluded me too.) I wasforc'd to accept of a large Houfe from the Commendator which he had taken for himfelf, before his late removal to that great Palace wherein he liv'd with the reft of his Country-men ; which former Hcmfe re maining empty at his charge and difpofal, I was by his great importunity oblig'd to accept .-'Wherefore I went to lodge there this night, and for the conveniency of Sig' Mariuccia^ they fent thither one of their Wives, a young Chriftian Woman of Arme nian race, though born in India^ with fbme other women-fer- vants. Now left the Englifti Prefident (hould take this ill, I purpos'd to prevent him with terms of courtefie 5 and the next Morning after a (hort, and the laft fit of my Tertian, I went to give him a vifit, and make my excufes to him by reprefenting to him the reafons of what had pafs'd with the Hollanders, without any voluntary fault of mine: But upon my enquiry at his Houfe, and fending my meftage to him, I was anfwer d that he was not at home , although we perceiv d by certain fignesthat he was, but fairly declin'd to receive my vifit. Wherefore underftand - ing afterwards that he was much incens'd not odely againft me, butalfoagainft the Holland Commendator, conceiving that he had unhandfomely ftolne and ufurp'd me from him, (as he faid} in regard of the intereft he had in us, upon the account of our be ing brought thither in their fhips 5 and that he had a more par ticular difpleafure againft Sig r ^//'er^jknowing him to have been the principal occafion oi all, I thought it expedient to appeafc him by all means, and upon what ever terms of fatisfadion : Ne- verthelefs 1 did not judge it meet to venture another repulfe byThe Travels of Peter Delia Valle, 5H ! going to vifit hiin 5 butfenthim a Letter in juftification of my felf ? with all the civil expreffions I could devife. At firft he was fomething backward to receive ir, doubting perchance that I had written angerly to him, in regard of iny preceding vifit: yet at length^upon the requeft of fbme mediators whom I made ufe of, he took it, read it, and remain'd very well fatisfied with my proceedings, in which there was nothing but gcntlenefs. The Commendator likewile, being one of an excellent nature, us'd all means he could to give the Prefident latisfadlion, and to fhew him that what he had done with us was to no ill end 5 he wentpurpofely to vifit him, carrying Sig: Alberto with him, to the end he might juftifie himfelf too: both of them intreated, and both of them took the blame upon themfelves, in fine, fo much was done and faid that the Prefident wasreconcil'd with all. And becaufe it was infifted on my behalf that he would admit a vifit from me, he confented upon this condition, that this firft time fhould not be fimply my vifit but his invitation , which accordingly he made to us to come al] together that night to fupper with him, where he treated us very fplendidly, and every thing ended in jollity and friendfhip as at firft. And all the while that I ftay'd at Snrkt^ he oblig'd me continually with fundry demonftrations of his affedionparticularly, by often fending his own Coach to me,with his Interpreter,who is an Armenian Chriftian, and a Catholick, call'd Scander^ Brother to F. Agofiino BagiezTji of Alingia, a Dominican, my acquaintance in Ferfia: which Interpreter being fkill'd in the Country, and converfing with me in the Perfian Tongue, carry'd me frequent ly abroad to fee fundry things. As for the Hollanders, the ca- reffes and civilities which they have done, and ftill continue to me, are fb numerous, that I fhall have them in remembrance as long as I live. But 'tis time now to fpeak a little of this City, and the curiofities which here and elfewhere I have lately feen. ' The City ofsurat^ is of a handfome greatnefs, and, for thefe Countries, of fufficiently good building .• Tis very populous, a11 cities an(1 places are in India^ which every where / // abounds with people. The Inhabitants are partly Gentilos^ and partly Mahometans 5 and, if I am not deceived, the former are the greater number ; However, they live all mixt together and peaceably, becaufe the Gran Moghel^ to whom is now a / t l ^ ^ omet imes had a diftinft King ) although he be a Mahometan &lt; but not a pure one, as they report ) makes no merence in his Dominions between the one fort and the other : and both m his Court and Armies, and even amongft men of the ug left degree, they are of equal account and confideration. let the Mahometans, as the Mafters, efpecially thofe of the iOgholian Race,which now is the Imperial in thefe parrs, feems to have fome little more of authority. But forafmuch as I have formedy furvey d and obferv d the manners of the Mahometans both in Turkey and Ferfta , I now turn my mind to thofe of the Gentile xy /t Vl. ay ^7Into the E AS T~lN D I E S. ij Gentile-Idolaters in India , which are more new to me 5 and with fisich obfervations in reference to both., as (hallfeem worthy of notice, 1 (hall not fail to acquaint you. In the firft place,, I {hall give you the relation of a Nuptial Pomp, which I faw one ??7&amp; &lt;? / ) day pafs by my hdufe in this manner 5 A long train of men with ^ Drums and Trumpets Before them march'd in the day time firft, carrying cover'd bafkets full of fundry things, which were either a Prefent fent from the Bridegroom to the Bride, or rather the attiring of the Bride, which ufes tp be publickly fhewn in the Eaft. Then follow'd on foot likewife fome black Women-ilaves, well cloth'd, being given to the Bride either by the Father or the Hufband. Laftly, to conclude the Pomp, came a Palanchino, a kind of Litter, wherein perfons of quality are wont to be carry'd in India. It was not of the ordinary form, which hang downwards upon one pole between the bearers before and be hind 5 but it was to be carry 5 d on high upon poles by four men, one at each corner, and it was cover'd all'over with (ilk * yet no body was within it 5 lb that I know not what it ferv d for, unlels haply it was intended to tranfport the Bride to her Hufband 5 this different fafhion being for greater folemnity made ufe of, in fuchan occafion as Marriage. At night the married couples pafs'd by, and, according to their mode, went round about the City with a numerous company. They were four,all very fmall Children,two boys and two girls &gt; ('for in India, moft Marriages are made at that age J and becaufe they were not big enough to ride on Horfe-back alone, therefore they were held up by fo many well-grown men who fat upon the faddle. Before them went many Torches and Mufical inftruments, with a great troOpi of people on foot accompanying them* But the perfons of qua lity follow'd in Coaches, of which there was a good number, and going one by one they made a very long train y whereby it was known that the married Children were of confiderable quality. 1 Of remarkable things without the City, there is on ode fide VI f/ a very large Ciftern or Artificial Pool, furrounded with ftorie- work,^and contriv'd with many fides and angles, at which there ^ / / &lt;/? are ftairs leading down to the fur face of the water. Inthemidft * ftands a little Ifland, which cannot begone to but by boat of fwimming.

Now, for that the Country is in ibme parts fo fcarce of water,many Cities and inhabited places have no other but the rain-water gather 'd in thefe great Ci- fterns, which are fo capacious, that one of them fuffices a City for a whole year and more : And it not onely affords drink to men and animals, but alfo they wafti clothes and beafts in it when occafion requires, and make ufe of it to all purpofes - whereby it comes to pafs that in fome places the water they have is not over clear , and the rude Indians care not for fuch delicacies, but 'tis enough for them if they have what is barely needful. XheCiftern, or Lake Surat, hath a great Trench adjoynd to it on one fide, long, large, and deep, over which certain fmall bridges are built, and it falls into another lefs Ciftern a good way off, which though but fmall here compara tively, would yet be a very large one in our parts 5 'tis built with many fides of ftone like the former, as alfo the banks of the Trench are.

On the trunk of this Tree a little above the ground, they have rudely engraven a round circle, which really hath not anyrea- ture of a humane countenance, but according to their grofs ap plication reprefents that of their Idol. This face they keep painted with a bright Flelh-colour, and this by a facred rite o Religion; as the Romans alfo dy'd the face of Jufiter mth Ver- inilliwri;, as P/i/y'teftifies : Round about it are faftned Flowers^ and abundance of a plant whofe leaves refemble a Heart, call d . - ^^7 hereP^, but in other places of lW/4, Betle. Thefe leaves the Indians ufe to champ or chaw all day long , either tor healt 1 s fake, or for entertainment and delight, (as fome other IMations for the fame reafons, or rather through evil cuftome, conti nually take Tobacco: ) And therewith they mix a little allies ot fea-ftiels, and fome fmall pieces of an Indian Nut fufficiently ^ common, which here they call and in other places a very dry fruit, feeming within like perfeft wood , and be ing of an aftringent nature they hold it good to ftrengthen t e Teeth: Which mixture, befides its comforting hath alfb a certain biting tafte wherewith they are delig te and 5 as they chaw it, it ftrangely dyes their lips and mouths re^which alfo they account gallant ^ but 5 do not^becaufe it appears not to be natural; They fwallow down onely the juice after long maftication, and fpit out the reft: In Vifits, 'tis the firft thing offer'd to the vifitants 5 nor is there any fociety or paftime with- t , out it.

As for its other qualities I can fay nothing} but there is no great matter in the taftcj norihould I make much difference of chawing thefe leaves of ?an^ or thofe of our Cedars. But to return to my Relation 5 Thofe flowers and leaves about the Idol's face carv'd in the Tree ;) are frequently chang d, and frefh conftantly fupply J d 5 and thoie which at times are taken away;, are given as a facred thing to the people who come from all parts to vifit it. In the fame rude fculpture of a humane face, they have put certain eyes of Silver and Gold with fome jewels, which were given by fome perfons who fool- iftily believ'd themfelves cur'd of maladies of the eyes, by virtue of the Idol : Before whom, upon a little hillock, ftands conti nually one of their Gioghi, who among the Indians are a fort of Hermits ^ and fometimes I have (een a Woman too ftanding there. On high, there hangs a Bell, which thofe that come to make their foolifti devotions, firft of all ring out, as if thereby' to call the Idol to hear them 5 then they fall to their adoration winch is commonly to extend both hands downwards as much as poffible, being joyn'd together in a praying pofture 5 which lifting up again by little and little, they bring to their mouths o 38 1:0 kits them 5 And laftly, extend them fo ioyn'd together as high as they can, over their heads: Which gefticulation is us'd onely to Idols and facred things ^ for to men, even to Kings them felves , they make the fame Salutation ( which in the%r/^- Tongue they caH and in thtn Indian, Sumbaia)on\y with the right hand. This ceremony being perform'd/ome make their prayers onely ftandmg, others proftrate themfelves with their whole body groveling upon the earth , and then rife again ; others onely touch the ground with the head and fore-heacT, and the Tr^ 0 r Humility.

A-fide of this T ree, ftands a very fmall fftpola^ or Chappel, with a very narrow window for entrance y'l faw not what was within it, but I was inform'd that Women^vho have no Children go in there Ibmetimes, and after they have been there become fruitful by ^ y / the virtue of the place 5 but as in falfe Religions every thing is ' impofture, fo 'tis the opinion here, that the attendants of the^^ Idol play fine pranks in this particular, either beguiling fimple young Women, orlatisfying the more crafty^ whom indeed they fometimes caufe to become pregnant, but 'tis by natural means without miracle, thePriefts within the Chappel fupply- ing the defeds of their Hufbands. Moreover, on another fide of this Tree, ftands a fquare low Poft, on which certain figures of Idols are engraven ; and at the foot thereof, there is a little kind of trench or hole, where alfo they pour Milk and Oyle, and make divers other Oblations. They are very folicitousin keeping the Tree with every bough and leaf of it, not fuffering it to be injur'd by animals or men, nor in any wife violated and profan'd. They tell a ftory of an Elephant who one day by chance eat but one (ingle leaf of this Tree, for which being pu- niffrd by the Idol, he dy'd within three dayes; Which ftory I underftood to be thus far true, namely that the event was in this manner 5 but 'twas thought that for the reputation of the place, the attendants of the Idol either poyfon'd or knock # d the Ele phant on the head 5 in which Arts the Gioghi and Priefts of the Gentiles ufe to be very dextrous. • The Commendator of the Dutch, came one day to give me a vifit, and after a competent converfation, carried me in his Coach a little out of the City, to fee one ofthe faireft and famous- eft gardens of Surht. The plot was level, well contriv'd and divided with handfome ftreight W T alks: on either fide whereof, were planted rowes of fundry Trees of this Climate , namely, / */' Ambe 0 or, as others fpeak, before defcrib'd by me in my A laft Letters from Perfta, in the maritine parts whereof I fa w Tome ^ ^ Treespf this kind^ Foufel^ whofe leaves are like thofe of the a.

They go abroad with a great train, fometimes alfo of their own men on Horfe-back 5 but efpecially with a great number of Indi an fervants on foot, arm'd according to the mode, with Sword, Buckler, Bows, and Arrows. For 'tis the cuftome of fervants in piUc'aJ India^ whether Mahometans or Gentiles, to go alwayes arm'd not onely upon a journey but alfo in the City, and to ferve in the houfe all day with the fame weapons by their fides, and never to lay them off, faving at night when they go to deep. Moreover, thefe Governoursof the two Frank or Chriftian Nations which refide in Surht , ufe to have carry'd before their Coach or Horfe when they ride^ a very high Bannerol or Streamer by a man on foot; (which likewife is the cuftome of all men of qua lity here) and likewife to have a fadled Horfe lead by hand be fore them : And not onely they who are publick perfons, but any private perfon whatever, of whatever Country or Religion, may in thefe parts live with as much grandeur and equipage as he pleafes : and fuch is the liberty here, that every one may do 3 if he will and be able, as much as the King himfelf. Hence, gene rally all live much after a genteel way ^ and they do it fecurely, as well becaufe the King doth not perfecute his fubjeds with falfe accufations, nor deprive them of any thing when he fees them live fplendidly, and with the appearances of riches^ ( as is often done in other Mahometan Countries ) as becaufe the Indians are inclin'd to thefe vanities s and fervants coft very little, in regard of the multitude of people, and the fmall charge where with the common fort are maintain'd j for a fimple Servant, who is not an Officer, commonly in the beft houfes, between wa^es., victuals, and clothing, ftands not in more then three Rupia a moneth, amounting to about the value of a Venetian Zecchine, or ten (hillings fterling. Of Slaves there is a numerous company, and they live with nothing, their clothing is onely white linnen, which though fine, is bought very cheap 5 and their dyet for ' 'the i •7) O/v £ JInto the EAST-INDIES. 23 themoftpartis nothing but Rice, (the ancient food of all the Indians 3 aecording to Straho) of which they have infinite plenty 5 tib; i f :' and a little fillij which is found every where in abundance ; So that every body^ven of mean fortune, keeps a great family, and ^ is fplendidly attended ^ which is eafie enough, confidering the y? ' /f very fmall charge, as I faid, and on the other fide the very con- fiderable gains of traffick wherein moft men areimploy d, and the incomes of the Land, through its incredible fruitfulnels, I dare fay, unmeafurable. Upon this occafion I mult not forget, r ^ that amongft the Indian Men, both Mahometans and Pagans, ^ agreably to what Strabo teftifies, they did ot old wear onely white linnen, more orleisfine according to the quality of the perfons, and the convenience they have of fpending : which linnen is altogether ofBumbaft or Cotton, (there being no Flax m India) and for the moft part very fine, in comparifonofthole q of our Countries. The Garment which they put next to thefkin, (erves both for Coat and Shirt from the girdle upwards, being adorn'd upon the breaft,and hanging down in many folds to the middle of the Leg. Under this Caflack from the girdle down wards, they wear a pair of long Drawers of the fame Cloth, which cover not only their Thighs 5 but legs alfo to the Feet 5 and 'tis a piece of gallantry to have it wrinkled in many folds upon the Legs. The naked Feet are no other wife confin d but to a flipper, and that eafie to be pull'd off without the help of the Hand 5 this mode being convenient, in regard of the heat of the Country, and the frequent ufe of (landing and walking upon Tapiftry in their Chambers. Laftly, the Head with all the hair, which the Gentiles (as of old they did alfo, by the report of Strabo') keep long, contrary to the Mahometans who (have it, Lib( ^ is bound up in a fmall and very neat Turbant, of almoft a qua drangular form,a little long, and flat on the top : They who go moft gallant, ufe to wear their Turbant only ftrip'd with filkof feveral colours upon the white, and fometimes with Gold 3 and likewife their girdles wrought of Silk and Gold, inftead of plain white.I was fo taken with this Indian drefs, in regard of its clcaniiefs and eafinefs 3 and for the goodly (hew me-thought it had oahorf-back,with the Scemiter girt on, and the buckler hanging at a (houlder belt, befides a broad and fhort dagger of a very ftrange iliape ty'd with taflell'd firings to the girdle, that! caused one to be made for my felf, complete in every point, and to carry with me to fhew it in Italy, The Mahometan Women, efpecially of the Mogholians, and Souldiers of other extraneous defcents, who yet are here efteem'djgo clad likewife all in white^ either plain, or wrought with Gold-flowers 5 of which work there are fome very goodly and fine pieces. Their upper Gar ment is fhort, more befeeming a Man then a Woman, and much of the fame fhape with thofe of Men : Sometimes they wear a Turbant too upon their heads, like Men, colour'd and wrought with Gold : Sometimes they wear onely fillets either white or?;?N 24 //&lt; (/ X. // ffl The Travels ^fPcter Delia Valle, red, or wrought with Gold and Silver ^ for other colours they little u(e» Likewife their Clothes are oftentimes red, of the fame rich and fine linnen 5 and their Drawers are alfo either white or red, and oftentimes of fundry forts offilk-ftuf^ftripM with all forts of colours. When they go along the City;, if it be not in clofe Coaches, but on foot or on horfe-back, they put on white vdls, wherewith they cover their faces, as 'tis the cu- ftomeof all Mahometan Women : Yet the Indian Gentile Wo men commonly ufe no other colour but red, or certain linnen ftamp'd with works of fundry colours, (which they call Cit) but all upon red, or wherein red is more confpicuous then the reft 5 whence theit attire feems onely red at a diftance. And for the moft part they ufe no garment 5 but wear onely a clofe Wafte- coat, the lleeves of which reach not beyond the middle of the Arm -y the reft whereof to the Hand is cover'd with bracelets of Gold, or Silver, or Ivory, or fuch other things according to the ability of the perfons. From the wafte downwards they wear a long Coat down to the Foot, as I have formerly writ that the Women do in the Province of Moghojian in Perfta, near Ormuz. When they go abroad, they cover themfelves with a Cloak of the ordinary fhape like afheet, which is alfo us'd by the Maho metan, and generally by all Women in the Eaftj yet it is of a red colour, or elfe of Cit upon a red ground, that is, of linnen ftamp'd with fmall works of fundry colours upon red. Thofe that have them, adorn themfelves with many gold-works, and jewels 5 efpecially their Ears with pendants fufficiently enor mous , wearing a circle of Gold or Silver at their Ears, the diametre whereof is oftentimes above halfafpan 3 and 'tis made ofa plate two fingers broad, and engraven with fundry works, which is a very difproportiOnate thing. The Pagan Women go with their faces uncover'd, and are freely fcen by every one both at home and a broad : Ncverthelefs they are modeft, and honor'd much more then the Mahometans, and amongft'them 'tis a certain thing that there is not any publick Courtifan 3 but amongft the Mahometan Women there are infinite, who go every day publickly ro houfes, and where they pleafe 5 to play on Mufick, fing, dance, and do what elfe belongs to their profe^ffion. But of thele things, enough for this time. I came from Perfta with a great defiretogoto Cambaia, in regard of what I had heard of it 5 being told that in that City which is one of the ancienteft pf India, the Pagans are very nu merous, and above meafure oblervers of their Rites 5 fb that I might probably fee more remarkable Curiofities there of thofe Idolaters then elfewhere: Sig: Alberto SciUing had the fame de- hre 5 lq that upon my imparting my mind to him,and his confent- mg thereunto, ^both of us defir'd the Dutch Commendator that when any of his Nation wen t to Cambaia, as they us'd to do lometimes about their affairs, he would do us the favour to ad- vcrtife us thereof, that we might go thither in their company.

I offerM the Steward money for the Coaches, but he refus'd then to take it, faying that it was not the cuftome, and that at our return, accounts Ihould be made up 5 for (b they were wont to deal with thoie Hackney - men, with whom the Nation has always long account for fuch matters} and I, who undetftood things no otherwife then by this information, fuffer'd my feff to be perfwaded. Now, on Monday the 2 3 11 of February^ beingtheday for our letting forth, befides the three Coaches for Sig: and me, and two others fullof Dutch-tnen who were to go this journey with us, all in very s^ood order for habits and arms, and alio with a Trumpeter with a filver Trumpet to recreate the Travellers, the Commen- dator himfelf came to my houie with many others of his follow- crs in their City-Coaches, to conduft me forth and fet me in the way. He accompany d me to a certain place without the City, where, in the (hadow of a fmall Chappel, we convers d to gether for a good while, and were entertain d with fundry fruits, particularly with Grapes, which here in we have often eat ripe, fweet, and good in February, yet green of colour, like thtDva-Lugliatica^ox early J^^-grape of Italy 5 and I believe there is plenty enough to make Wine. Whilft we were in this place, a Poft came to the Commendator from Agy a and from the Court, with news that 5^/^ ^3 ^^£5 of the Country, hadfentone of his principal Chans, call'd Ashf Chan^to Agra^to remove the Royal Treafure thence before the ai rival of ^Sultan Chorrom, one of the fame Kings Sons, lately rebell'd againfthis Father, and then reported to be upon his march with his Army thither : And from Agra it was (ignifi d,that things were in great danger of alterations through this'war rais d^ between the Father and the Son, with great danger of the whole State^ of India. This notable Paffage happening in my time, will give me oc- cafion to write many things worthy of memory, ufually attend ing the like Conjunftures, and being prefent in the country, perad venture lihall hereafter be an eye-witnefs, or at leaft have certain intelligence of fundry occurrences.

King, as his own Seals teftifie, the impreffion whereof I keep by • me, wherein is engraven all his pedigree as far as Taw er I am, from t whom Scuh Selim reckons himfelf the eighth defcendent. When ^ Scihh Selim was born, he was at firft call'd Sceichii 5 becaufe thet^^ / - King Ekbar his Father, having before had no children, conceived ^ he had obtain'd him by the prayers of a certain Sceich, (fo they^C^ as/ call a Religious Man J to whom he bore great reverence. But ^ X after he was come to ripe age, his Father chang'd his Name, as here they fometimes do, into Sciah Selim, which, in the Arabian Dialed, the learned Language to all Mahometans, fignifies Rl Pacific, a Peaceable, or Peace-making King^ conceiving this Name to agree to his Nature : The Father dying, Scidh Selim being advane'd to the Kingdom, chang'd his Name once again ( as 'tis the cuftom of many Oriental Princes on fuch an occafion ) with more Magnificent Titles, ( for their proper Names are no thing but Titles and Epithets ) and would be call'd Nur eddht, Mnhammcd, Gihon ghir, which partly in Arahick^, partly in Perfick, fignifies^ ihe Light of the Law, Mahomet, Take the World 3 in regard of the profeffion which he makes in publick of the Ma hometan Sed, though really in fecret, by what they report, he little cares for Mahomet and his Law, or any other Religion 5 accounting, according to the vain opinion of fome in thele parts 3 that a man may be fav'd in every Law. Ncverthelefs, the Name Sciah Selim, tenaciouily inhering in the memory of people, remains ftill to him, and in common difcourfe he is more frequently call'd by this then any other Name. He had two Brothers: One, who took a part of the Province Dacan', was call'd by his proper Name Peharl, and by firname Sciah Murad : The other, whody'd in the City Berhampor, was nam'd Daniel^ and fir nam'd Sombol Sciah, but both dyed without Heirs, whereupon their Dominion returned back to SciAh Selim, I know not whether by one or more Women, this Kingliad four Sonsv'the firfi:, is call'd Sultan Chofrou , the fecond, Sultan Terutz &gt; the third, Sultan Chorrom, now in rebellion, (to whom, when he returned from a war which he had profperoufly manag d in Dacan , his' Father gave the title of Sciahi Gihhn, which is interpreted. King of the World 9) and the fourth Sultan Scehriar, is yet a youth of fmall age. 'Tis poflible, others befides thefe have been born to him 5 but being dead, either in Child-hood or long ago, there is no mention made of them at prefent. He hath one Wife or Queen, whom he efleems and favours aj30ve all other Women ^ and his whole Empire is govern'd at this day by her counfel. She was born iu India, but of Perfiarv Race, that is, the Daughter of a Perfian, who coming, as many do into India, to thelervice of the Moghol, hapned in time to prove a very great man in this Court, .and, (if I miftake not) Chan E 2 w ^1The Travels Peter Delia Valle, \ N out many times to luuic Utmui^mc vnuuwa, 1 Allow not how ScM Selim had notice of her^ and became in love with her. He would have carried her into his Haram^ or Gyn&lt;eceo^ and kept her there like one of his other Concubines, but the very cunning and ambitious Woman, counterfeited great honefty to the King, and refused to go into his Palace \ and, as I believe ? alfo to comply with his defires, iaying, that (he had been the Wife of an Honourable Captain, and Daughter of an Honourable Fa ther, and (hould never wrong her own Honour, nor that of her Father and Hufband : and that to go to the Ring's Bar am A live like one of the other Female-Haves there, was asunfuitable to her noble condition.

But to return to the King's // / y , Children, C/w/m/the eldel&gt; 3 who was a Prince of much ' expedation, well beloy'd, and, as they fay, a friend in particular of the Chriftians, being at the government of 1 know not what/^- Country, rebell'd againft his Father, under pretext that the ^ Kingdom by right belonged unto him, becaufe indeed King &lt; cc/&lt; bar his Grand-father, at his death left it to him his Nephew be- // ingthen born, and not to Selim the Father who was his Son 5 being difpleas'd with his SonSelim^ for that one time in his life he attempted to rebel againft him. So eafie are Infurredions amongft thefe Infidels,and fo little faith can Fathers have in Sons, and they in their own Fathers : With this pretence Sultan Chofiou, once rais'd a great Army againft his Father 5 but coming to a battel he was routed and fore'd to furreinder himfelf freely to his Father : Who chiding him with words rather gentle then otherwife, alk'd him to what end he made thefe tumults 3 knowing wellthat he held and kept the whole Kingdom for him? Yet his deeds were (harper then his words 5 for in the firft place, he caus'd all the chief Captains who had follow'd him in the war to be cruelly flain, and (hewing them fo (lain to Chofibu, as in his return with Triumph he made pa(s along with himlelf in the middle of a long row of them barbaroufly mangled in feveral manners, and to behold (bme of his faithfulleft Confidents (ew'd up in beafts (kins, and be fo left miferably to rot ^ he bad him fee in what fort of people he had confided. Moreover, hefuffer'd him no longer to live freely, but committed him to the fafe but Honourable cuftody of certain Grandees of his Court : And, which was worfe, he caus'd his eyes to be few'd up, as 'tis fome- times the cuftom here ^ to the end to deprive him of fight with out excaecating him, that fo he might be unfit to caufe any more commotions 5 which fewing, if it continue long, they fay it wholly caufes lofs of Sight &gt; but after a while, the Father caus'd his Prince's eyes to be unrip'd again, fd that he was not blinded it (aw again,and it was only a temporal pennance. Yet he wai not Uver'd from prifon, in which he lived fo cloiely for two years, t onely one perfon was fufFer'd to be with him in the prifon to - him. Nurnzahal, who had apprehended that Sultan ChofroU d fucceed his Father in the Kingdom 3 and defir'd to eftablifh felf well, had frequently offer'd her Daughter to Sultan [rou before (he married her to Sultan Scehriar ^ but he, either that he had another Wife he lov'd fufficiently, and would not wrong her, or bccaufe he fcorn'd Nurntahal's Daughter, would never confent: Infomuch that whilft he was in prifon, and was told by reiterated me(rages that if he would marry Nur~ Mahal's Daughter, he ftiould be immediately fet free 5 never- thelefs he would not be brought to do it. His Wife, on the con trary, who lov'd him as well as he lov'd her 3 obtain d to be the. The Travels vf Peter Delia Valle, perfon allotted to ferve him in the prifon, and accordingly went thither and liv'd with him lb long; as he was there, never ceafing to perfwade him to marry Nnrn/ahal 's Daughter^that fo he might be deliver'd from thofe troubles ^ that for her part, (he was con tent to live with him as a Have, provided fhe faw him free and in a good condition ^ but he could never be prevail'd with. Thus he liv'd in prifon with his faithful and dear Wife, till, the malice of his perfecutors and his Father's anger being wearied, about two years after he was taken out of prifon, but ftill heldin a more honourable cuftody. For thefe things. Sultan Ctiofrou re- main'd always much in the hatred of Kurmahalh who defpairing , to marry her Daughter to him, gave her to Sultan Scehriar^ as is abovefaid. Sultan Permz, 0 the fecond Son, is now Governour of the Kingdom of Eengala at the mouth of Ganges, and lives peaceably, nor is any news heard of him. Sultan Chorron/j the third Son, had and hath under his Government that part of Dacan, which is fubjeft to the Moghol, bur now is about to ufurp the Kingdom of Guzarat , where I writ thefe things. Sultan Scehriar hath no Government yet, but'tis faid that he is lately made Captain of eight thoufand Horfe: Now touching the rebel lion and the beginning of it •, Sultan Chorrom, after the alliance that he made with Afaf Chan^ fo wrought by the means of his Father inlaw, and Numerhal his Aunt, that the King granted himtheprifoner Sultan Chofrou into his own power, taking him out of the hands of him that kept him , and committing him to him to keep, yet with order to ufe him very well and have great care of him. And this, becaufe C/wmw/ refus'd to go to his go vernment, and to the war whereunto they fent him, unlefs he carried Sultan C/w/m* with him, alledging that it was not con venient that he (hould be abfent from the Court whilft Sultan Chofrou his competitor and back-friend (tai'd there ^ when he had got him into his hands, he went to his goverment, and there kept and treated him honourably a year or two : but afterwards out of the intention which he always had to remove him out of his way to thefucceffion of the Kingdom, he being abfent (as fome fay) fent him poyfon d meats, appointing certain ?)f his Captains who kept him, to make him eat thofe meats by any means, either fair or foul. The Captains punctually executed this order ^ but hec&amp;xxfe Sultan Chofrou^ becommingfufpicious by t eir importunity to have him eat, would by no means tafteof thole meats, faying plainly, that they intended to poyfon him 5 the Captains, fince there was no other remedy, and perhaps having order, leap'd all upon him, and he defended himfelf bravely till at length having fell'd him to the ground, they itrangled him with a Bow-ftring. Others fay, that Sultan Char- rdm himfelf flew him with his own hand publicklv. Be it as it willj, sultan Chofrou dy'd of a violent death 5 and Sultan Chorram was dther by hunfdf, or by mediation of others the Mutherer.

Sultan Chorrom^ calls him to Court to give account of the fad. SultanChorrom would not obey the Summons, but gathering together his Forces, which neverthelefs are not great to with- s ^ // Hand his Father \ and raifing not onely thofe of his own jurif- 4 ^ A j : didion, but alio divers other neighbouring Cities notcompre- hended therein, (as C aw bait and other fuch, from which hath remov'd the Governoursplac'd there by his Father, and ^ appointed others at his own devotion ) with theaffiftance and^ : %^^^/' counfel of fome pety Gentile Princes, he remov'd his Camp to- ^ j wards Agra^ as is above intimated. In which commotions, and the death of Sultan Chojron, 5 tis not onely fufpeded that there is fome confpiracy of Ajaf Chan and Nnrmahaly his ancient ene mies in fecret, but alfo that the King of is of intelligence ^ with them, who about the fame time, or a little before, on his fide made the warr of Can dab or ; in which the coldnefs which the Moghol fotw'd, proceeded, no doubt, either from his not being well inform'd, becaufe perhaps Nurmahal, and Afaf cha^ who were his chief Counfellors, fuffering not true intelligence to be fignifi'd to him 5 or perhaps, becaufe the evil carriage of SultanChorrom hath hitherto neceffitated him to ftand in fu- Ipence. 'Tis true, the laft Advertifements from Agr^y that the King , as I laid, fent Afaf Chan to remove the treafure from thence, argue that the King ftill entrufts him ^ and confequent- ly, either that he is not in fault, or that his fault is not yet known. The dowbt will be beft clear'd by Time. Sultan Chofrou left a little Son behind him,whofe name is Sultan Bulachi: But my journey now calls meelfewhere. The Commendator having read the Letters from Agra, and XII, communicated to me all the News, it being now Evening, i took leave of him &gt; and after fundry volleys of mulkets here- ^ y turn'd to the City 5 and I with my company of five Coaches, ^ ^ ^ took the way of Cambata. Having travell'd two Cos, we ferri'd . over the fame R.iver of Surat^ and then proceeded four other Cos, which in all were fix, and at Night took up our lodging at a Town call'd Periah : But we refted little, becaufe foon after ^ mid-night we put our felves upon the way again. Our journey j from Surat to Cambaia, was always with our faces towards the North. The next Morning early, we made a Collation by the fide of a Pifcina, or Lake, which we found by the way of a long and narrow form, of which kind there are many in thefe parts. / | Having travell'd fixteen CV?/,which was from Surht in all two and ^. twenty, before Evening wearriv'd at the City of Barocci y or yj£.6*-, Behrug, as they call it in Perfian 5 under the walls whereof, on / • the South fide runs a River call'd Nerheda, which vve ferri'd over. The City is encompafs'd with a wall of moderate bignefi, built high upon a rifing hill. For the circuit 'tis populous enough, as generally are all the parts of India* 'Tis confiderable for a very great Trade of fine Cotton Cloth, or Callico, made more plenti fully there then in other places^ and difpers'd not onely through Afta, f'T- O -»-7Al The Travels of Peter Delia Valle, /r / / . yv*- ^ f /&amp; rrt'VA /X/f *■ ' /?u 7-h i ^/ a /c*?

Whence you may infer, what wealth comes out ot this fmall City alone, which for compafs and buildings, is not greater then Siena in fnfeany , although 'tis above three times as populous 3 and you may al(b confider to what fumm the Princes Cuftomes arife. A few Cos from the City, is a Mine of Calcidonies and Agates, white and green 5 but thefe ftones are carry'd left into Barocci then to Cambaia, although it be further from the Mine, becaufe there is a Sea-port, and a greater concourfe of forreign Merchants 5 and in Cambaia they are wrought into little Globes, either round or oval, to make Coronets or Neck-laces, and alfb little Cups, and divers other curious vellels for ornament. The Sea comes not up to Barocci even at the higheft tides,but is about as many miles diftant asVis from Surat, When we paft'd over the River, our Dutch Trumpeter founding his Inftrument, gave notice of our coming to his Country men refiding in Barocci j and they, at the Summons, came immediatly to the bank-fide to meet us 5 from whence we went with them to lodge in the Dutch Houfe there. Late in the Evening they carry'd us to fee a Fatache, or fmall Indian fhip which they were building, and was not yet finifh'd, in which they treated us till night, drinking of Tari^ which is a liquor drawn from the Nut-trees of India^ whitifli and a little troubled ^ of tafte, fomewhat fowrifh and fweet too, notunpleafing to the palate, almoft like our Poignant or Brilk-vvine ^ yet it inebriates as Wine doth, if drunk immo derately. The next day, which was Wednejday Feb. 12. we departed from Barocci late in the Forenoon. SixCWoff, we made a Collation near a water without lighting out of the Coach, having brought provifion with us for this purpofe r from Barocci. Afterwards upon the way we met the Wife and Fami ly of the Governour of Cawbaia, remov'd from that charge by the Rebel Sultan chorrom, who had plac'd another there at his devotion , and this, being driven from thence , return'd to Surkt^ where his houfe and ufual habitation was. His Wife was carry'd upon an Elephant, in acover'd and very convement litter. Three other Elephants follow'd unladen , favingwith the men upon their necks who guided them 5 then abundance of Coaches, partly cover'd and full of women, partly uncover'd ' with men in them 5 then a great number of Souldiers, Horfe and Foot 5 and, in brief, a great train fuitable to the quality of the perfon and the cuftom of India^ which is to have a very nu merous attendance whoever it be. After this we foarded a fmall River, which I believe, was of fait watery which, they fay, is call'dInto the EAST-INDIES. 33 call'd VtU-vd ^ and before night having travell'd eighteen ^^ we ftaid to lodge in a great Town call'd Giam ^ ^ day, two hours before day, we arofe to go along with a great 'W Cafila, or Caravan, which was there united 5 neverthelefs we ^ departed not fo foon, but were fain to wait in the Coach tillal- inoft day ^ becaufe the City was lock'dup, and none wasfuffer to go forth without paying a Toll, as likewife was paid in many / other places the lame day, though of rmall value. The was fo great, and the Coaches fo many, that in certain narrow r places we were fain to ftay a good while before we could go for- wards, juftas it happens in the ftreets of and K^catfo- lemn pomps. Having traveltd about five Cos^ an hour after Sun-rife, we came taaaarm of the Sea, or, to fpeak better, to the inmoft part of the Gulph of Camhaia, diredly where the Ri- vex Mebi falls into the Sea : In which place, the flux and reflux of the Sea is more impetuous and violent, and with a more rapid current, then perhaps in any other part of the world, at leafl: any whereof I have knowledge. But before I proceed further, 'tis needful here to corred an enormous error of many of our Geographers, even Moderns, which hath likewile given occafi- on of miftake to fundry Hiftorians. In almoft all the Mapps which hitherto Ihavefeen, the River is always defcrib'd falling into the Sea at the inmoft recefs of the Gulph of Cambaia^ which is a grievous error, and as wide from truth as the whole Country oiGuzarat is broad, (and 'tis no narrow one):for Indus^ which is difcharg'd into the Sea with two very large mouths, fufificiently diftant, runs not on theEafl: of Gfizarat, as it fhould do if it enter'd into the Sea at the Gulph of Cambaia. 5 but rather on the Weft, and fo far from the Gulph of Cambaia, that all OuKarat, and perhaps fome other Countries lye between. Wherefore the River which difembogues intheinmpft part of this Gulplys not Indus, but this Mehi which I fpeak of, a River of handfome but ordinary greatnefs, and hath not the leaft corre- fpondence with Indus. TSow\ being come to the fide of it, we were fain to foard over this Water, and not without danger: For tl^ere is a plain of about five Cos, which is all over -flow'd at high Tide 5 and when the water is loweft,in three or four places there are waters fufficiently broad and deep to be foarded 5 and fhould the Sea happen to come in whilft a man is in that paf^ fage, he would infallibly be drown'd. And befides, even in thoie places which are always foardable, when the Water is a little higher, or the current more furious then ordinary (tor 'tis not always equal, but more or lefs, according to the times of the Moon ) it often carries away people, and fometimes with fuch violence, that an Elephant cannot bear up againft it, but is fwept. away by the Water. Therefore they wait certain fit hours to pafs this foard, namely, when the Sea is at the loweft Ebb 5 which, if I miftake not, in all other places of the World is wont to be when the Moon is either rifing or fetting in the Hori- F son*Wi 1 ^ v ihe Travels of Peter Delia Vallc, _ Z onv as, on the contrary, when the Moon is in the middleof -dts/esrxSzs/ Heaven, the Xide ufesto beat thehigheft. But in the Gulph^of £ / * Cambaia , I know not upon what reafon, perhaps becaule 'tis ^ ,/ much within the Land 5 and far from the great mafs of the ^ ~ Ocean, it happens at another different hour, yet well known to w v the Country-people. The more cautious, wait alfo the moft fit- / 7 ting days in the moneth^ becaufe at the New Moon and Full J Moon the Waters are always greater and higher s and, without ' / a comparifon, higheft and moft impetuous of all, about the iEqui- L noxes and Solftices: In the quartersof the Moon the Tides are J / moderate, and in other intermediate days, lower then the reft. So that we being come to this place a few days before the New ^ Moon, were come in a good time , and iikewife in a feafonablc hour, the CafiU^ or Caravan , having fet forth from the City in fuch a moment as was exactly convenient for ordering matters right; for the owners of the Coaches, and the others i in ploy'd in this Journey, are well inftruded of every thing, and know what they have to do. So being united in a great troop 5 the better to break the ftream, wepafs'd over all that fpaceof five Cos, which was moift, yet firm ground 3 faving that in four places where we foarded the running-water of the River 3 which neverthelefs is (alt there, the great ftrength of the Sea over- ; • t coming that of the River. Of the four ftreams which we waded, the firft Was incOnfiderable, the other three came higher then the belly of the Oxen which drew the Coaches, into which ne- verthelefi the Water entered not, becaufc their floar, andelpe- cially the wheels are very high 5 and you fit, according to the manner of the Eaft, as upon plain ground, without hanging tlbe Legs downwards, but keeping them bow'd under you. For greater fecurity, they hir'd fundry men on foot, who held die Coaches on either fide ftedfaft with their hands, that fo in regaid of their lightnefs, they might not float and be carry # d away 5 and alfo to carry our bundles high on their heads, that lb the fame might not be wetted if the Water fhould come into the body of the Coaches. The men who go on foot in this paflage, f either ftrip themfelves naked, covering onely their privides with a little cloth, or pulling up their coat, which, as I faid^is of plain white linnen, and ferves both for garment and ftrirt^ and alfo tucking up their breeches made of the fame, they care not for wetting themfelves. Tis certainly an odd thing to behoM in this paflage, which is very much frequented, abundance of people^ go every day in this manner, fome in Coaches and Chair- riots, others on Horfeback and a foot ? men and alfo women naked, without being (hie who fees them &gt; a fpeftacle, no doubt, fumciently extravagant. This wet paflage being over^ there remain two other Cos 9 but of firm and higher ground, (which is mot overflow'd, although it be plain and the Sea-(hore) to arrive at the City of Cambaia, whither we came before dinner-time, Jaaving travel! d that day^ in Jall 5 twelve And here iikcwiie / / ; ' .

Camhaid is a City indifferently large.* though moft of its great- nefs confifts in Suburbs without the walls, which are fufficiently /^ / fpacious. 'Tis feated on the Sea-fliorej in a plain, almoltin the / / utmoft recefs of that great Gulph, whereunto it gives name, ^ . The City, that is the inner part, without the Suburbs is incom- ^ ^ pafs'd with walls, built with plain cortines and round battle ments. The Houfes within, are brickt with coverings pfTiles^ and Cifterns, which is the cuftom m India for provifion ot Water, which falls in fuch plenty during tfiofe three moneths of the great Summer rains. In our Countries they would be or dinary Houfes,but in thefe parts they are counted good, and per haps, the beft of the whole Province ^and they are made (hady and cool, as the heat of the place requires. The City hath no form d Port, becaule it ftands in a low Plain, but tis call d a Port, by reafon of the great concourfeof VefTels thither from feveral parts 5 which neverthelefs for the mo^l part are Frigots, Galeots, and other (mall ones of that make, which go either by oar or fail &gt; becaufe great ones cannot come near the Land by a great way. The people of are moft part Gentiles, and here, more then ellewhere, their vain fuperftitions are ob- (erved with rigor. Wherefore we, who came particularly to fee thefe things, the fame day of our arrival, after we had din d and refted a while, caus'd our felvesto be conduced to fee a famous Hofpital of Birds of all forts, which, for being fick, lame ? depriv'd of their mates, or otherwife needing food and cure, are kept and tended there with diligence ^ as alfo the men who take care of them, are maintain'd by the publick alms; the In- 5 dian Gentiles, (who,with Pythagoras and the ancient ./Egyptians, (the firft Authors of this opinion, according to Herodotus') be lieve the Tranfmigration of Souls., not onely from Man to Man, but alio from Man to brute beaft} conceiving it no le(s a work of Charity to do good to beafts then to Men. The Houfe of this Hofpital is-fmall, a little room fufficing for many Birds: Yet I (aw it full of Birds of all forts which need tendance, as Cocks, Hens, Pigeons, P^tcocks, Ducks, and fmall Birds, which during their being lame, or^ick, or matelels, are kept here , but being recover'd and in good plight, if they be wild, they are let goat liberty 5 if domeftick, they are given to fome pious perfon who keeps them in his Houfe. The moft curious thing I faw in this place, were certain little Mice, who being found Orphans without Sire or Dam to tend them, were put into this Hofpi tal 5 and a venerable Old Man with a white Beard keeping them in a box amongft Cotton , very diligently tended them with his fpedacles on his nofe, giving them milk to eat with a Bird's feather, becaufe they were fo little that as yet they could F 2 y cat a £ t &gt; 7-1, j Lib. 23The Travels of Fcter Delia Vallr, i,/ eat nothing elfe 5 and, as He'told us, he intended when they */ were growri up, to let them go free whither they pleas'd. From t S» wen; U ^ - j i ' this place we went out o£the City to the Sea-nde, to fee a Gar den fometimes belonging to the Kings of Gnzarat. Tisfmall, adorn'd with the fame Trees as that which I faw in $**41, with fome alfo of ours, as the Figtrees and Coleworts of Europe, which in India are accounted rare things. These is a ruhning^water which at the entrance falls from a great Kiafc^ or cxreer'd place to keep cool, ftanding upon a great Pifcina, or Lake, .contigu ous to the Garden on the out-fide ^ and ferving like that of Suraty to the common ufes of the City. Befides which, in this Garden there is nothing worth notice: Going from hence we went to fee upon the fame Lake a Mefchita^ or Temple of the Mahome tans, whereunto there is continually a great concourfe of people with ridiculous and foolifh devotions, not onely Mahometans, but likewife Gentiles. In the ftreet before the Gate, many per- fons fitting on the ground afked Alms, to &gt;whom the paffers-by caft (bme Rice 5 others, certain other Corn, but no Money: Within the Mfchifa, in a narrow dark place by a walls fide, is a kind of little Pyramid of Marble, and this they call Pir y that is. Old) which they fay is equivalent, to Holy: I imagine it the Sepulchre of fome one of their Sedl: accounted fuch; The people enter in with great crowds, efpecially Women, who. ufe to be more forward inthefe things then others; All who go b, ftrew Flowers or Rice there 5 to which enddand divers neajF thd Gate that fell Flowers to whofo pleafes for fuch Offerings: But this is rather a Cuftom of the Gentiles then Mahometans 5 and the Gentiles being more numerous and ancient in 'tis no wonder that fome Rite of theirs hath adher'd to the Maho metans. A little diftant from this place, we faw another Sepuchre adot'd too of fome Mahometan (for the Gentiles, who burn their dead, have no Sepulchres) built with a great roof fouir fquare, fupported by divers pillars, and under it a place open on all fides like a Porch 5 this alfo many perfons came to kils and venerate. Beyond the abovemention'd' Garden upon the Sea- fide, we faw another Sepulchre of a Mahometan of qwality^ haying a high round Cupola, like a Tower, which is afoended by a little ladder, and there you have a mofl! goodly profpedt upon the Sea and Land, to a great diftance.

Moreover, without one 0f the Qaces of the City 5 we law another great troop of ? Gows, GalveSj. and Goats, which being cur'd, and brought? into betteri plight, or gather d together from being difpers-d dnd without Mates, or being redeem'd with Money from the Mahometans who would have kill'd them to eat, (namely, the Goats and other Animals, but not the Cows and Calves) were fent into the field to feed by Neat-herds, purpofe- ly maintain d at the publick charge $ and thus they are kept till being redue'd to perfed health, 'tis found fitting to give them to fome Citizens, or others who may charitably keep them. I excepted Cows and Calves from, the Animals redeem'd from {laughter $ becaufein Cambaia, Cows y Calves,, and Oxen, are not killed by any : And there's a great prohibition againft it, by the inftance of the Gentiles, who upon this account pay a great fumm of Money to the Prince i and {houldany, either Maho metan or other be found to kill them, he would be punifti'd fe- verely, even with death. At Night we had Mufick at home, made by feme Mahometan Women Singers and Dapcers, ( for among the Gentiles none praftife fuch Arts) who with their In dian Inftruments, which are Drums, Bells ty'd to the Arms, and the like, all of great noife, gave us divertifement, playing, dancing, and finging whilft we were at Supper 5 but their Mufick being too full of noife, was to me rather diftafteful then pleafing. The next Morning we faw in the City a Temple of Idols, one of the beft which the Gentiles have in Cambaia. The form of it is perfeft fquare, with walls round about, fupporting a flat roof, which is alfo upheld in the middle by four pillars difpos'd in a fquare too} within which, upon the little fpace re- maininf ,13 advane'd fomewhat higher then the roof, and yet of a fquare form, akmd of Cupoktta , or little Chappel. In the principal part of this Temple ftand in three great Nieches lb many greatldok, made of white Marble, and naked, (as the Indians paint all their Idds: ) They are in a fitting pofture, yet after the manner of the Eaft, as they ufe to fit upon the ground with the Legs gather'd under &gt; but they fit in a place fomewhat higher then the fkwe, as it were upon a large Pedeftal. Thefe Nieches are inclos'd with doors made with lattices, that fo the Idols may be feen without opening them 5 but they are open d upon occa- fion for any' that are minded to go in: They were lb for us, but we entred not,becau(e the Nieches mc fo fmall that we (aw every thing well enough from the doors. The principal Idol in this Temple, is that which flands in the middle Nieche, calld Mahavir^ from whom the Temple is denominated : Who this Mdhavir is, and whether he be all one with Mahadcu , as I 7 t have Is / :Hi 4^ A^ts is** f ■ H'The Trd'vcls of Peter i3cli&lt;i Vsllcj have fome fufpicion ^ I do not yet know 5 becaufe the Indians who talkt with uSj either in the Portugal or Ferjian-^L ongue, be ing all Fadors or Merchants, and confequcntly unlearned, could . not give us any account of thefe things 5 befides, they (peak thofe'Languages ill, and are not intelligible faving in buying and felling : With other learned Gentiles, to whom alone their Indian Speech is familiar 5 we could not difcourfe for want of Language 5 wherefore of all thele things, and all the particulari ties of their Religion, I referve my felf to be further informed at Goa i if it (hall pleafe God 5 where I (hall have better conveni- eiace and more time, and meet with (ome learned Brachman, perhaps turn'd Chriftian, and able to give me a more certain Re lation hereof either in Portuguez or Latine &gt; and if he be -a Chriftian., he will, no doubt, give it me more truly then the Gentiles, who I believe, talk with us concerning their own matters neither willingly nor fincerely. Wherefore referring my felf to the better intelligence which I hope to have there, I (hall here only relate what I faw with mine own eyes, and fome- thing more which I attain'd to underftand, without lufpicion of error. Before the Idol without the Nieche hung a Bell, ( as 'tis the cuftom in all their Temples) which, aslfaid before, all thofe who come to make their prayers ring at their firft entrance. Within this and the other NiecAei-on the fides, were one or two lighted Candles. In theother fides of the Temple, fomething higher then the pavement, were in the wall certain little Nieches^ in each of which ftood an Idolet, or little Idol, fome in the Ibape of Men, others of Women. One there was which had many Arms on a fide, and many Faces &gt; and this theyfaid was call'd Brachma^ one of their chief falfe Deities. Another had the head of an Elephant, and was calFd Ganefcio : They fay, he is the Son of Mahadeu, who finding him one day with Parveti his Wife, but Kisown Mother, and not knowing who he was, kiird him out of jealoufie, cutting off his Head, but afterwards un- derftanding that he was his own Son, he repented him of his error, and relblv'd to bring him to life again : Wherefore meeting with an Elephant, (as he had purpos'd to do witl^ what he firft happen'd upon) he cutoff his Head and plac'd it on his dead Son's Shoulders : Whereupon Ganefcio reviv'd , and thenceforward liv'd immortal with an Elephants Head. But behold another delufion. One there is with the Head, I know not, whetherof aTyger or Lyon, probably'tis that which I formerly writ that I faw in Combru, in the maritine parts of Perfta, Some of thefe Idolets fate upon fundry Animals, as Tygers and the like, and even upon Rats 5 of which things the foolifti and ignorant Indians relate ridiculous ftories ; But i doubt not, that under the veil of thefe Fables, their ancient Sages (moft parfimonious of the Sciences, as all Barbarians ever werej have hid from the vulgar manyfecrets, either of Natural or Moral Philofophy, and perhaps alfo of Hiftory: And i hold ' for..... . —■— — Into the EAST-INDIES. 39 for certain, that all thefefo monftrous figures have fecretly fome more rational fignifications 5 though exprefs'd in this uncouth manner: As we knowin ancient time among the Gentiles of our Countries there was^n the figures of quadrifronted Janusoijft- piter Ammon^withthQ Head of a Ram j of Amhis^wkh the Head of a Dog, and many other extravagances not onely of the Grecz- atts and but alfoof the Rofttaus , The uieiingj 1 illars, and Walls of this Temple were adorn d with Painting, efpeci- ally red which how dear tis to the IftdidHs^ Iformeily intima ted.The doors of their Houfes^amely.thePofts^Architraves.and Barrs that faften it, are all colour d fo j adding fome mixture pf white limes to the red ^ for of white too they are 16 enamour d, that all Men are generally cloth'd with it. A cuftom peradven- ture deriv'd to them from JEgflt where it was in ufe, as Herodotus ^h. z. writes*,and whence perhaps Fythagoras himfeli: learnt it 5 who went ' cloth'd in white, as we find noted by tflian, and others. And I 'I • • IZ ' obferve, that in many particulars the manners of the prefent In dians much refemble thofeof the ancient^ nce the Egyptians who defcended from Cham the Son of Noah) were a very ancient people , I rather believe that the Indians learnt from the jEgyptians, then the Egyptians from the Indians 5 and 'tis known, that from JEgypt there was always Navigation and Commerce into India by the Southern Ocean. The red colour, amongft thefe Indians is, befides by the Women, worn alfo by thzSami^ who are a kind of religious perfons 5 with red, the Cioghi who live like Hermits and go about beggingfometimes paint their bodies in many parts 5 and alfo with red blended with yellow, that is, with (bme parcel of Sanders or Saffron^ almoft all the Indian Gentiles dye their fore-heads, and fome- times their garments 5 accordingly^ as Strabo reports frcMH the teftimony of OnejicritPts^ they did likewise in the time ot Alex* 15, under the Great. Laftly, they wear red Turbants upon their Heads, and their Girdles are ottner wrought with red then any other colour. After having feen the Temple of Mahavir ^ we went to vifit anold Brachman, accounted very learned amongft them.-, with whom we difcours'd as well as we could by an inter- preter,becaufe he underftood no other Language but the Indian, We found him amongft many Scholars,to whom he was giving a Ledure:He (hew'd us his Books written in an antique Charaaer, which is the learned amongft them, not common to the vulga^ but known onely to the learned, and us d by the Brachmansj as ?,/ ^ who, in diftindion from other vulgar Charaders, us'd vanouliy ^ infundry Provinces of India^ cdW itNagheri, I have, and fhali ^ *7 carry with me two fmall Books of it, which I fbmetimes bought . in Lar, This Brachman is call'd Keca Azarg , of which words, Bee a is his proper Name , and Azarg his Title of Honour, Amongft other Books, he (hew'd us that of their feft 5 in which, though it was bound long ways, as 'tis the fafhion oi their Book^ yet the lines were written crofs the paper , after the manner 01 J 4 lomein'; 40 the Travels of Pttcr i3era Valle, De Vita Apoll lib. j. cap.6. Lib. 8&gt; 1i /y/y V- /&amp; Ai-m A* , fame of our Mufick -Books: He affirmM to us for certain 3 that it was a work of Vythagorus^ which well agreeth with what, Thi- lofiratus faith, 'jarchas told nasnely, that they Indians believ e! the fame concerning the Soul which Pythagoras had taught them, and they the Egyptians 5 which is quite contrary to what, I faid before, was my opinion, which of thefetwo Na tions firft taught the other. But Diogenes Laertius^ who writes Tythagorass Life copioufly enough, makipg mention of his going into and how he convers'd likewife with the Chald£ans and Magi, yet fpeaks not a word that ever he went into India y or had communication with the Brachmans. Wherefore, if Pythagoras taught any thing to the Indians , as Jarchas faid, he did it not in perfon but by his books, which poflibly were carry'd into India, Moreover Eeca Azarg added, that their Brachnta, efteemed one of the chief amongft their falfe Gods, ( from whom they are denominated Brachmans) is all one with fythagoras : A curious notion indeed, and which, perhaps, would be news to hear in Europe, that Pythagoras is foolifhly ador'd in India for a God. But this, with Beca Azarg*sgooii leave, I do not believe : Either he did not exprefly fpeak thus 3 and by the fault of the Interpreters we did not underftand him aright 5 or, if he did affirm it, perhaps he came to be miftaketi by having heard Pythagoras nam'd by fome Europeans for the Author of that foolifti opinion of the Tranfmigration of Souls, Be it as it will, I cannot believe that Pythagoras and Brachma are all one ^ bccaule though Pythagoras be very ancient, for he flourifti'd in the Confulfhip of Brutus, who expell'd the Kings out of Rome 5 yet I hold the Rites and opinions of the Brach mans much more ancient. For when Diodorus relates the con- Lib. 19. of tfte two Wives of Ceteus, an Indian Captain in the Army otEumenes , each of whom would be burnt with her Hulband ilain in battel, fpeaking of the Laws, Cuftoms, and Rites of the Indians, he calls them, even at that time. Ancient things. And though Pythagoras and the Confulftiip of Brutus may pre cede not.onely Eumenes, who was one of Alexander the Greats fuccefibrs, but Alexander himfelf by about two ages, according to the Chronology of BtUarmine, which to me feemsgood e- nough 5 yet the fpace of two hundred years or fomewhat moire, is not fuch as that thofe things may be call'd Ancient, which had their beginning within fo (hort a term 5 as it fhould be infallibly, if Pythagoras, whom they take to be their Brachma, were the firft Author to the Indians of their Learning, and confequently of their Rites, Cuftoms, and Laws. But fince I have already made frequent mention of the Brachmans, and perhaps (hall have occafion to do the fame hereafter 5 to the end it may be under- ftood what they are,! fhall here fubjoyn (b much as I have hither to attain'd to know concerning them, and all the other Indians. The whole Gentile-people of India is divided into many fefe or parties of menj, known and diftinguiftit bydefcentor pedigree. XIV.Into the EAST-INDIES. 4 1 Lib.*; Lib.

Tis reckon'd that they are in all eighty four 5 fome fayvmore, making a more exaft and fubtle divifion. Every of thefe hath a particular name, and alfo a fpecial office and imployment in the Common wealth, from which none of the defcendents of that Race ever fwerve ^ they never rife nor fall, nor change condition: Whence fome are Hufbandmen, others, Mechanick, as Tay- lers, Shoemakers, and the like , others, Fadors or Merchants, fuch as they whom we call Banians , but they in theirXanguage more corredly Vania : Others, Souldiers, as the Ragia-puti 5 And thus every oneattends,and is employ 5 d in the proper Trade of his Family , without any mutation ever hapning amongft them 5 or Alliance of one Race contracted with another* D to dor us and Strabo , (almoft with the famewoflds, as if the one had transfcrib'd the other) affirm, that anciently the Races of the Indians were feven, each addicted to their proper profeflion ^ and for the firft of all, they place that of the Philofo- phers, who, mo doubt, are the Brachmans. Into feven kinds of men with their particular , and by Generation perpetuated Offices, Herodotus in like manner writes , (and Diodorm con firms it, though he difagrees in the number ) the people of Mgyp was divided inthofedaysi whereby 'tis manifeft what correfpondence there was between Mgypt and India in all things. Nor do I wonder at the divifion into feven Races onely, becaufe what is obferv J d at this day, muft then alfo have hapned, namely, that the fo many Races which they reckon, are reducd to four principal \ which, if I miftake not, are the Brachmans, the Soul diers, the Merchants, and the Artificers 5 from whom by more minute fubdivifion all the reft are deriv'd, in fuch number as in the whole people there are various profeffions of men. ^ In the fubftantial points of Religion all agree together, all believe the ^ Tranfmigration of Souls, which according to their merits and ^ demerits (they think) are fent by God into other bodies, either of Ammals more oriels clean, and of more oriels painful life $ or elfe of men more or left noble and handfome, and more or lefi pure of Race, wherein they place not a little of their vain (uper- ftition 5 accounting all other Nations and Religions, befides themfelves, unclean 5 and fome more then others, according as they more or lefs differ from their Cuftoms. All equally believe that there is a Paradice in Heaven with God, but that thereinto go onely the Souls of their own Nation, more pure and without any fin, who have liv'd pioufly in this world; Or in cafe they have fin'd, that after divers Tranfmigrations into various bodies of Animals and Men, having by often returning into the world undergone many pains, they are at length purg'd, and at laft dye in the body of fome man of Indian and noble Race, as the Brachmans, who amongft them are held the nobleft and pureft » G becaufeThe Travels of Peter Delia Valle, becaufe their employment is nothing elfe but the Divine Woi&gt; fhip 3 the fervice of Temples and Learning, and they obferve their own Religion with more rigor then any others. Tis trwe;, the Brachmanswho amongft the Indians 9 in my opinion^ much refemble the Levites of the Jews, are divided too into feveral forts, one more noble then another, and 3 according to nobility, more rigorous alfo in matter of eating , and in their other fuperftitious Ceremonies 5 for fome of them are Aftrolo- gers, fome Phyfitians, fome Secretaries of Princes 5 andfo of other forts of Scholars which I know not well, but the moft efteem'd and moft fublime amongft the Brachmans, and confe- quently, the moft rigorous of all in point of eating and other ob- fervances, are thofe who perform the Office of Priefts, whom they call Boti, Ordinarily they never admit into their Sed any man of another Religion 5 nor do they think that they do ill herein, or contrary to the zeal of faving Souls ^ fince believing theTranfmigration, they conceive it not neceffary to (alvati- on to change Religion, although one be of a falfe Sed &gt; but Judg that if this Soul (hall be worthy to have pardon from God 9 it lhall after death, and after being purg'd fundry ways, paft into, and be born in the body of fome Indian amongft them, and live excellently 5 and fo by this way at laft arrive at Paradice and live with God, although in the beginning it was in the world in the body of the worft finner and mifcreant what ever. With people of other Religion they never eat, nor will have any com munication of food, and, as much aspoffibie, they avoid even to touch them ^ conceiving themfelves polluted by communi cating with others. And herein they are fo fcrupulous, that even amongft the Indians themfelves, one of more noble Race, notonly neither eatg,nor makes ufeofthe fame clothes^r veflels, nor communicates in any thing with one lefs noble, but alfo en dures not to be touch'd by him 5 which if it fall out by chance that he be, he muft purifie himfelffrom the defilement by wafti- ings, and other arrogant Ceremonies. And hence 'tis a prety fight to behold the great refped which upon this account the ignoble bear to the more noble then themfelves, and how upon meeting in the ftreet, the ignoble not onely give place, but dance wildly up and down for fear of ruftiing againft the noble, and polluting them in any meafure ^ which, if they (hould not do, the Noble, and efpecially the Souldiers, would make them do it to the Mufick of blows. From this averfenels to communi cate one with another, particularly, in the ufe of eating and dnnkmg-veflels, concerning which they are moft ftrid, is fprung a Itrange Cuftom, which I was delighted not onely to fee, but alio fometimes out of gallantry to imitate in converfation. It happens Tery often during hot weather, both in Travelling and m Towns that people have need of refrefbing themfelves, and urinkingrof a little water, but becaufe every one hath not a tlrmking-veflcl of his own ready, to avoid defiling or being de- fil'dInto the EAST-INDIES. 43 fird by his companion's cup ^ there's a way found out whereby any perfon may drink in that, or any other whatever, without fcrupie or danger of any either adttve or paffive contamination. This is done5 by drinking in fuch manner that the veflfel touches not the lips or mouth of him who drinks ^ for it is held up on high with the hand over the mouth 5 and he that lifts it up higheft, and holds it fartheft from his mouth, fliewshimfelf moft man nerly 5 and thus powring the liquor out of the cup into the mouth 5 they drink round while there is any left, or fo long as they pleafei So accuftom d are the Indians to drink in this man ner, that they pradife it almoft continually with their own yef- fels for delight ^ without theneceffityof (hunning communica tion with others 5 and they are fo dextrous at it, that I remem ber to have feen one of them take with both hands a veffel as big as a bafin, and lifting it up above'a fpan higher then his mouth, powre a great torrent of water into his throat and drink it all off. Having been frequently preferit at fuch occafions, that where ever I came the Indians might not be fhie of reaching me a cup of water, I purpofely (et my (elf to learn this manner of drinking, which I call drinkjng in the Air , and at length havelearn'd it 5 not with cups as big as bafins, like his abovefaid i but with a handibme cruze, like thole we u(e, or with a little bottle or drinking glals made on purpofe, I do it very well: Sometimes in converfation we drink healths all* Indiana , after this faihion, with confent that all do reafon in the fame manner 3 and he that cannot do it right, either wets himlelf well, or falls a coughing andyexing, which gives occafion of laughter. But to return to the opinions of the Indians 5 As for good works and fins, they all agree with the Doftrine of Morality, and the univerfal conlent of Mankind, that there are differences of Virtue and Vice in all the world. They hold not onely Adul tery, but even fimple Fornication a great fin 5 nor do they ae- countMt lawful, as the Mahometans do, to have commerce with femal tlaves, or with others befides their own Wives. Yea, flaves of either Sex they no-wife admit,but hold it a fin 5 making ule of'free perfons for their fervice, and paying them wages, as we do in Europe :■ Which likewife was their ancient cuftom, as appears by Strabo, who cites JMegafthenes and other Authors of thofe times for it. They deteft Sodomy above meafure, and abhor the Mahometans whom they obferve addided to it. They take but one Wife, and never divorce her till death, unlels for the caufe of Adultery. Indeed fome, either by reafbn of the remotenefi of their Wives, or out of a defire to have Children., in cafe the firft Wife be barren 5 or becaule they are rich and potent, and are minded to do what none can forbid them, fbme~ times take more Wives &gt; but 'tis not counted well ^onc, unlefs they be Princes, who always in all Nations are priviledged in many things. When the Wife dyes, they marry another if they pleafe 5 but if the Hulband dye, the Woman never cnarnes G 2 numjiThe Travels of Peter Delia Val le, more ^ were fhe fo minded, nor could fhe find any of her own Race who would take her, becaufe (he would be accounted as bad as infamous in defiring a fccond Marriage.

Some Widows are burnt alive, together with the bodies of their dead Hufbands 5 a thing which anciently not onely the Indian Women did, according to what Strabo writes from the Relation of Onejicritus$ but alfo thechafte Wives of the ihra- cianS) as appears by Julius Solims. But this burning of Women upon the death of their Hufbands, is at their own choice to do it or not, and indeed, few pradife it; but (he who doth it, ac quires in the Nation a glorious name of Honour and Holineis. Tis moftufual among great perfons, who prize Reputation at a higher rate then others do 5 and in the death of Perfonages of great quality, to whom their Wives defire to do Honour by burning themfelves quick. I heard related at my firft coming, that a Ragia, that is, an Indian Prince, Cone of the many which arefubjefttothe being flain in a battel, fevenreen of his Wives were burnt alive , together with his body ^ which in lydia was held for great Honour and Magnificence. I have heard fay, (fori have not feen any Women burnt alive ) that when this isto bedone, the Wifeor Wive^who are to be burnt, in- clofe themfelves in a pile of wood, which is lay'd hollow like the rafters of a houfe, and the entrance rtop'd with great logs, that they may not get out in caie they (hould repent them when the,kindled fire begins to offend them ; Yea, divers men ftand about the pile with ftaves in their hands to flir the fire, and to powre liquors upon it to make it burn fafter* and that if they (hould fee theWoman offer to comeout,or avoid the flames,they would knock her on the head with their ftaves and kill her, or elfe beat her back into the fire^ becaufe'twould be a great fhame to the Woman and all her kindred, if (he fliould gc to be burnt, and then through fear of the fire andjkfath, repent and come out of it. I have likewife heard it faid7that fome Womei^ are burnt againft their own Will, their Relations refolving to have it fo for Honour of the Hufband 3 and that they have been brought to the (ire in a manner by force,and made befides theift- i 'elves with things given them to eat and drink for this purpoie, that they might more eafily fuifer themfelves to be ^aft into the fire, but this tlie Wlians direftly deny, (aying, that force is not us'd to any ^ and it may be true, at leaft in Countries where Mahometans command ^ for there no Woman is fuffer'd to be burnt without leave of the Covernour of the place, to whom it belongs firft to examine, whether the Women be vyilli^^ b(C- fides 3 and for a Llcerice 5 there is al(6 paiii a good fum of money.

But this fecond Argument feems not tome fo cogent, becaule, amoneftus Chriftians, if a Knight ofthe order of Calatrava, or the like, which are Enfignes of Nobility, in order to a more holy life enter into (bme Religion, .dthei of Fryers, Monks, or other Regulars; 'tis clear that takitlg the Religious Habit, he layes afide the body of his Knight-hood, 'although it be that Crofs, than which there cannot be a greater Cognizance ot. Chriftian Religion; albeit'tis worn by thofe Knights as atoken of Nobility too. l is enough, that the Jefuits think their opi nion abundantly confirm'd by the two abovefaid Realons, name ly, that it is rather a fign of Nobility then a Cognizance of Re ligion. And although the fame is conferr d with many fuper- ftitious Ceremonies, yet they will not have it taken away, al- ledging for example, that the Croffesof our Knights, however Enfienes of Nobility, are given with many Ceremonies and Rites of our facred Religion, the more to authorize them. Whence it appears that the ufe of this Ribban may be without Icruple permitted to the Indians,provided thefe fnperftinous Ceremonies be lay'd afide, and efpecialiy the End, in which alone conhits the fin &gt; changing it in that manner as the ancient Chnltians chang'd many Feftivals and fuperftitions of the Gentiles into Feftivals of Martyrs, and other pious Commemorations.

That the Gentile- Kings having bonour'd with this Enfign fome Mahometan, their Vaflal, and remaining a Mahometan, is no more then as if in our Countries we ihould grant to fome Jew the priviledge of wearing a black Hat without becoming a Chriftian 3 which may be done by way of difpenfation, and yet it cannot be deny'd 4 but that the wearing a black one, or a yellow, is, befidesthe matter of credit, a Cognizance alfo of the Religion or Sedt which a man profeffes.

Having feen this Temple, we overtook our at a Town call'd Saimh, three miles diftant from where we all lodg'd that night. The next Morning be.ng Smday, the Cafila which confifted of above a hundred Coaches, be- fides foot-men and horfe-men, and great loadenWagons, fet forth three hours before day ; and flaying not to reft any where, according to the cuftom of the Eaft, ( wh.ch is to make but one bout of a days journey; having travel! d fifteen^ by noon, or little later we lodg'd at a Town call'd Muter, where we faw an infinite number of Squirrels leaping amongft the trees every where; they werefmall, white, and with a taillefs, and not 10 fair as thofe of our Countiies. On Monday, about two hours before day, we rcfum'd our Voyage. When it wa.s day, we law upon the way every where abundance of wild Monkies, of which almoft all the Trees were full. They put me in mind of that Army of Monkies, which the Souldiersof the Great, beholding upon certain Hills a far off, and taking to be Metr intended to have charg'd, had not Taxilus inform d them what they were, 25 relates. We found abundance of people Lib.i* too upon the way begging alms with the found of a Frumpet^ which almoft every one had and founded, and or them were arm'd with Bows and Arrows, two things fiifficiently un- n, couth for beggars, and indeed, not be fufTer'd by Governours, fince thefe Ruffians under pretext of begging, rob frequently upon the way when they meet perions alone and unarm 0 3 which having weapons themfelves, they may eafily do. Th ls County was almofl: all woody, the ground unmeafuiabl} u y, to the great trouble of Travellers 5 the High-ways were al enclosed on the fides with high hedges of a plant always green and //, /t unfruitful, not known in Europe 5 and having no leaves, but in- / ftead thereof cover'd with certain long and (lender branches, al- ^ moft Jike our Sparagus but bigger, harder and thicker, ot a very lively green ^ being broken, they fend forth Milk like that of immature Figgs, which is very pernicious to the neih wherever it touches. The Fields were full of Olive-trees, Ta marind -trees, and other fuch which in India are familiar. About noon, having travell'd twelve, or, as others faid, fourteen Cos^ we arriv'd at Ahmedab^ and our journey from Cambata hither was always with our Faces towards the North Eait. Being entred into the City, which is competently large 3 with great Suburbs, we went diredtly to alight at the houfe of theEnghlft Merchants, till other lodging were prepar'd tor us, where alio we dind with them. After which we retir'd to one ot the ^ houfes which ftand in the ftreet, which they call Ter^ Carvanje- rat. that is, the laalm Inn. For youmuft know that the 7 3 ^ vanjerat*.The Travels Peter Delia Valle, vanjerai, or Inns in Ahmedabkd, and other great Cities of are not, as in Terfia. and Turkey&gt; one (ingle habitation made in form of a great Cioyfter 5 wich abundance of Lodgings round about;, feparate one from another, for quartering of ftrangers^ but they are whole great ftreets of the City deftinated for Grangers to dwell in, and wholbever is minded to hire a houfe and becaufe thefe ftreets are lockt up in the night time for fecu- rity of the perfons and goods which are there, therefore they call the Cavanferai.- Notwithftanding the wearifomnels of our journey, becaufe we were to ftay but a little while at Ahmedakady therefore after a little reft we went the (ame Even ing to view the market-place, buying fundry things. It difpleas 'd me fufficiently that the ftreets not being well pav'd, although they are large, fair, and ftrait, yet through the great drynefi of the Earth th^y arefodufty, that there's almoftno going a foot, becaufe the foot (inks Very deep in the ground with great defile ment 5 and the going onHorfe-back, or in a Coach, is likewife very troublefome in regard of the duft 5 a thing, indeed, of great difparagement to fo goodly and great a City as this is. I faw m Ahmedabad, Rofes, Flowers of Jafwin, and other forts, and divers fuch fruits as we have in our Countries in the Sum mer 5 whence I imagin d,that probably,we had repafs'd the Tro- pkkof Cancer^ and re-enter d a little into the temperate Zone 5 \vhich doubt I could not clear for want of my Aftrolabe, which r -had left With my other goods at Snrat, On Tnejday following.

This Palace hath a great fquare Court, furrounded with white and well pohfh d wallsi , the midft ftands a high Port to (hoot at with arrows, as is alfo ufual in the Piazzaes of Pcrfia. On the left fide of the Court a# ^ , vou go in, are the Kings Lodgings, a fmall and low building. What 'tis within fide, Iknownot, for I enter d not into it* but without,'tis as followsUnder the Kings Windows is a fquare place inclosed with a rail of colou ^d wood, and the pavement fomewhat rais'd; within which, when the King is there, ate wont to ftand certain Officers of the Militia, whom they caU mnfubdat, and they are almoftthe fame with our Colonels ; their Command extends not to above a Thoufand Horfe i no,r are they all equal, but from a thoufand downwards, fomehave more, fome lefs, under them. Within this indofure of the- Manjubdary, under the King's Balconies, ftand twocarvd Ele phants ofembols 'd work, but not large, painted with their natu ral colours i and in the front of the Royal Lodgings, are othet fuch Ornaments after their mode 3 of little connderation. Some faid, that a while ago in one of the Balconies ftood expos d to publick view an Image of the Virgin ^ir^plac'd there by Sctah Selim 5 ( who , they fay, was devoted to her ) and to whom, perhaps, it was given by one of our Priefts, who frequent his Court out of adefireto draw hiip to the Chriftian Faith , but theTmage was not ihere now, and p^ffibly, was taken away by Sultan Chorrom his Son , (reported-an Enemy of the Chnitians and their affairs) fince his coming to the Government ot thole parts of Cuzarat. The ftation of the greater Captains, andoi higher dignity then the Manjnhdary, as the CWand others ofc / - that r?nk, is in the Kings Balconies ? or near hand above rt* 16 within the Rooms: The inferior Souldiers, that is, fuch as have onely two or three Horfes, ftand upon the ground m the Court without the above mention'd inclofure. In the front ot the Court is another building, with an inclofure alio betore it, but lefs adorned ^ 'tis the place where the King's Guard Itands with all its Captains: And the fame order, I believe, is always obferv d in the MoghUs Court, in whatfoever place or City he happens to be. Within this Court is another on the left hand, furrounded with&gt;other buildings for neceffary Offices, but not fo well built nor polifti'd. Having feen what we could of the Royal Palace, we return^ by the (ame way we came to tnt ftrcet of the great Market. From whence we went to lee a ^ s famous Temple of Muhade#} to which there is hourly a grea / - * jl 2 concourle A ^The Travels of Peter Delia Vallc, concouife of people, and the ftreet which leads to it is always Eiil, not onely of goers and commers to the Templej, but alfo of beggars who ftand here and there alking Alms of thofe that pafs by- The building of this Temple is Imall, the entrance narrow and very low , almoft under ground 5 for you defcend by many fteps, and you would think you were rather going into a Grotto then into a Temple &gt; and hence there is always a great crowd there. On high hung a great number of Bellsj which are rung every moment with great noife by all thofe who come to worfhip. Within the Temple continually ftand, many naked Gioghi^ having onely their privities (not very well) cover'd with a cloth i they, wear long Hair difheverd , dying their Fore-heads with fpots of Sanders, Saffron, and other co lours fuitable to their fuperftitious Ceremonies. The reft of their bodies is clean and fmooth, without any tindture or impurity 5 which I mention as a difference from (bme other Gioghi, whofe Bodie arc all fmear 'd with colours and aflies, as I (hall relate hereafter. There is, no doubt 3 but thefe are the ancient Gymnofophifts io famous in the world &gt; and, in (hort, thofe very Sophifts who then went nakedjand exercis'd great patience in fufferings, to whom Alexander the Great fent Onefuritns to confuk with them, as Straho reports from the teftimony of the fiime Oneficritns. Many of them ftood in the Temple near the Idols, which were plac'd in the innermoft Penetral or Chancel of it^ with many Candles and lamps burning before them. Theldols were two ftones, fomewhat long, like two fmall Ter- mini, or Land-marks, pointed with their wonted colours; on the right fide whereof was a ftone cut into a figure,and on the left another of that ordinary form of a fmall pillar , according to , which, as I faid before, that they ufe to fliape Mahaden ; And before all thefe, another like figureiof Mahadeu, made of Cryftal, upon which the Ofeings were lay'd, as Milk;, Oyle, Rice, and divers fuch things. 1 he afliftent give every one that comes to worfhip fome of the Flowers, which are ftrew d upon , and round about the Idols 9 receiving in lieu thereof good fumms of Alms. Coming out of this Temple, and afcending up the wall of the City, which is hard by 3 we beheld from that height the little River call'd Saherweti, which tuns on that fide under the walls without the City. Upon the bank thereof, ftood expos'd to the Sun many Gioghi of more au- i r iTf 5 ? amely fueh5 as 1101 onel y are naked . iike thofe above eelcrib d, but go all Ipnnkled with afiies, and paint their bo dies and faces with a whitilh colour upon black, which they do with a certain ftone that is reducd into powder like Lime : Their beards and Hair they wear long, untrim'd, rudelv involv d, and fometimes ere£fed like horns.

From the lame place, I beheld a little Ghappel built upon two fmall figures of Mahadw, not upright, but lying along upon the groundjand carv'd in bafie relief,where alfo were Lamps burning, and people making their Offerings. One of theG/^z, laying afid^ all other care^ remain'd conti nually in this Chappel with grea^ retirednefs and abftradion of mind, fcarce ever coming forth 5 although it was very trouble- fome abiding there, in regard of .the heat of the lights 5 and inconvenient too, by realon the Chappel was fo little that it could fcarce contain him alone as he fat upon the pavement, ( which was fomewhat rais'd from the Earth) with his Leggs doubled under him, and almoft crooked. Returning home by the fame way of the great Ztaz^r, or Market, I faw Carvar/Jerai^ or Inns made with Cloyfters like thofe of Perfia 5 one greater and fquare of the ordinary form, and another lefs, narrow and long. Of divers other ftreets, in which I (aw nothing obfervable, I forbear to fpeak. The fame day after dinner, having taken leave of certain Armenian and Syrian Chriftians,who live in Abrntdahud with their Wives and Families, we put our felves upon the way to return to Camhaia^with the fame Cafila^with which we came, and which every week departs thence at a fct day. At our fetting forth we met with a little obftacle, for by reafonofthe new Commo tions between the Moghol^ and his Son Sultan Chorrom, who was become Mafter of thefe parts of Guznet^ there was a frefh pro hibition in Ahmedabad , that np Souldiers Wives, nor other perlbn of quality (hould go out of the City by Land 5 and this, as I conceive, left the rumors of the troubles (hould caufe the people of the City to remove into other Territories, and aban don (the fadion of the Rebel Sultan Chorrom j which they could not do if their Wives were reftrain'd, becaufe Hufbands are in a manner neceffitated to abide where their Wives and Houles are. So that by reafbn of this prohibition , I could not have got away, having my Sig' Mariuccia with me, un- lefs I had obtain'd exprefs leave in writing from the Go- vernour 5 in order to which it was needful for me to make it appear that we were ftrangers and not people of the Country, and to pay fome fmall fumm of Money, befides going back ward and for ward, whereby we loft much time. Having at length obtain'd permiffionj and being got out of the City, we XVI. JL y W if r mm m m a- mM , iilL III 'km mj fje Travels Peter Delis Valle^ we went a little without the walls to fee a great Artificial Lake which is there, made of ftone with flairs at feveral angles about it; its Diameter was,by iny conjefture,above hall a mile. It hath about the middle an Illand, with a little Garden, towhtchthey go by a handfome Bridge of many Arches very well built| upon which I believe, two Indian Coaches may go a breaft. Indeed thefe Indian Lakes are goodly things, and may be reckon d amongft the moft remarkable ftruftures of the world. Having • feen this, we went to overtake our Cafla, which was arriv d at ^ a Town (e&gt;fen Cox diftantfrom Ahcwdabtdj call d Barigia^ or SCusn BariZfdy f ifor the Indians very much confound thefc two Letters ^ .g and s in their fpeaking.) We came late to the faid Town, bv - reafbn of our hindrances at our departure from Armedal&gt;hd\ but certain Horfc-men appoibted, as I conceive, to guard the way j having met us in the night j would needs accompany us thither that fo we might go fafelys for which fervice they were contented with a very (mail gratuity which we gave them. XVII. the firft of March, being Ajh-Wednefday, we fet forth by break of day 5 and having traveil'd fifteen Cos, an hour or little more before night, we came to lodge in a competently large ; ! i»»' y y Town call'd Soznitra, where I law Batts as big as Crows. The next day, March the fecond, beginning our journey early, we travell'd twelve Cof, and a little after noon arriv'd at Cambaia. The Dutch Merchants there underftanding by others that we were coming with this Cajila, came to meet us a little without the Gate, and with their accuftomed courtefies condufted us to lodge in their Houfe. March the third, we went out of the walls to the top of the Tower of that Sepulchre, which I faid We (aw near the Garden of the King of Cuzarat, to behold from thence, ( being a great profpe^t upon the Sea) the coming in of the Tide, which indeed was a pleafant fpedacle. Twas^New- Moon this day, and fo a greater Tide then ufual, and we went; to obferve it at the punftual time of its being at the height, which thofe people know very well-, becaufe at that time it in- creafes in lefs then a quarter of an hour, to almoft the greateft height it is to have, and flows with greateft fury contrary to what happens in other Seas. Now at the due time we faw the Sea come roaring a far off, like a moft rapid River, and in a moment overflow a great fpace of Land, ruihing with fuch fury that nothing could have with-ftood its force 5 and I think it would have overtaken the fwifteft Race-horfe in the world. A thing verily ftrange, (ince in other places both the riling and the falling of the Sea in the flux and reflux is done gently in full fix hours, and with fo little motion that 'tis fcarce perce}v d. After this we went to (ee another goodly Ciftern, or Lake, without the City, formerly not feen, of a fquare form, and of a fumptu- ous marble ftrufture, with ftairs about it like the others which I had feen elfewhere.

They go naked,mofl: of them with their bodies painted and fmear'd, as is above mention'd 5 yet fome of them are onely naked, with the reft of their bodies fmooth, and onely their Fore-heads dy'd with Sanders and fome red, yellow, or white colour ^ which is alio imitated by many fecular perfons, out of fbperftition and gallantry. They live upon Almes, de- fpifing clothes and allother worldly things. T hey marry not, but make fevere profeffionof Chaftity at leaft in appearance 5 for in fecrer tis known many of them commit as many debauche ries as they can. They live in fociety under the obedience^ of their Superiors, and wander about the world without having any fetled abode. Their Habitations are the Fields, the Street^ the Porches, the Courts of Temples, and Trees, ^ efpecially un der thdfe where any Idol is worftiipt by them 5 and they undergo with incredible patience day and night no lefs the rigor of the Air then the exceffive heat of the Sun, which in thefe fultry Countries is a thing fufficiently to be admir'd.

On the fourth of March &gt; I went out of Cawbaia toaTown two miles off, call'd Hagra , to fee a famous Temple, built of old by the Race of the Bantons^ and belongs to them 3 but yet . the Brachmans poffefs it, and have care of it, as if it Were defcen- dedinto the e ast-indie s. 57 ded to them. This Temple is dedicated to Brahmh &gt; who, as I faid before, they hold to be the fame with Pythagoras although of theorigine of Brama, and how he was produc'd of the firft Caufc, or elfe of the firfi: Matter, andhdw they take this for one of the Elements, and a thoufand other extravagances 5 they tell long Fables, which do not agree to Pythagoras a meer man 5 but for all this tfiey confound the two Names, and 'tis no great inatter to reconcile them herein, after the fame manner that our ancient Geritiles agreed in their Jupiter, taken fometimes for one of the Elements, and fometimeshiftorically for an anci ent King one of ^^s Sons 5 and in divers other like names, in reference to Hiftory and Philfophy they had double^ allegori cal and myfterious fignifications. Concerning the Genealogy pf Bramh, and the other fabulous Indian Gods, and what be longs to their vain Theology, I tefer the Reader to the Books pf Father Francefio'Negrone , or Negraore, as the Portugals call iiim, who writes fully thereof in his Chronicles of the things done K, by thofe of his Order in lWi&lt;i,written in the Language 5 and I think he is the firft, and perhaps, the onely Modern Wn- ^ ter who hath given account of this matter in Europe, The faid ' * ^ Father having been affifted therein, for information by mofb fit and fufficient Interpreters, namely, the Fathers of his own Religion, good Divines, fkill'd in the Indian Tongue, and pet- fedly intelligent of thefe matters 5 who alfo read and interpre ted the very Books of the Indians to him, and were likewife his interpreters in the difcourfes which he had often with the learned Indians concerning their Religion, as himfelf frequently told sne. Befides which, he wanted not other helps, becaufe being appointed Hiftoriographer to his Order, he was abundantly fupply'd with what was needful to that Office &gt; he convers'd long in the Kingdom of fiifraga, where the Religion and Sciences of the Indians have their Principal Seat 5 as alfo in the Illand of Zeilan^ which many take to be the ancient Tabrobana, and in 6ther Countries for this very purpofe. He made many peregri nations exprelly to fee places and things conducing thereunto, and was affifted by the Vice-Roys themfelves and Governoura of Provinces, fubjeft to the Portugals , who fent him into all places accompany'd oftentimes with whole bands of Soul- diers, where the wayes were not fecure 5 in brief, without fpa- ring coft, pains, or diligence, he profeiledly intended^ this bu- finefs for many years together, with all kind of convenience and authority. Laftly, he was fome years fince fent by his Order into Europe, in Order to print his Works; and in the year 16195 as I came through Perfia, I faw him at Sphahan ^ and during his ihort abode there by means of a Friend got a fight of his Papers, but had not time to read them, as I defir'd.

Father Joam de Lucena a Jefuit, in hisHiftory of the Life of San Francefco Xavier, written in the Portugal Tongue, makes mention likewife of the Religion and Cuftoms of the Indian-Gentiles, andfeems to fpeak thereof with good grounds, although infomefew particulars, if I mi- Hake not, he is capable of a little correftion. Yet that which troubles me moft, is, that it clearly appears by his Book that he knew much more of the Cufloms of the Indians then he hath written: which perhaps he would not write, either becaufe they were obfeene and impious, or pertain'd not to his purpofe. I faw Father Negrone fince at Coa, but he brought not his Book printed? either becaufe his Fathers, as fbme fay, would not have it printed i or —.Yet he faith, he hath fent it to be printed in Portugal in that Language, and expeds it by the next Ship 5 if it comes, I (hall fee it. But having in Goa difcours'd with him more largely then I did in Perfta, I find him very little vers'd in matters of ancient Hiftory and Geography, as generally the Fryars of Spain , and efpecially Portugal are not, addicting themfelves little to other Studies, befides what ferves to Preach ing ^ wherefore, without good fkill in ancient Hiftory, Geogra phy, and other Humane Learning, I know not how 'tis poffible to write Hiftories well, particularly, concerning the Cuftoms of the Indians 5 of which alfo he hath had no other information but by interpreters 3 in which way I have by experience found that many errors are frequently committed. Neverthelefs we fhall fee what light may be had from F. Lucena's Book, although it be ftiort, concerning the Religion ot the Indians, In the mean time returning to my purpofe, I (hall tell you, that in the Temple dedicated to Brahma in the Town otNaghra^ which is little confiderable for building but in great Veneration for ancient Religion, there are many Idols of white Marble. The biggeft is the Chief, and hath the worthieft place : In the middle is the Statue of Brahma^ or Pythagoras, with many Arms and Faces, as they ordinarily pourtray him, namely, three Faces, for I could not fee whether there were a fourth or more behind 5 'tis naked with a long picked Beard, but ill cut as well as the reft of the figure, which for its bignefs hath a very great Belly, I know not whether through the Artificers fault, who feems to have been little fkilful ^ or elfe becaufe tfre Indians 0 as I have alfb heard of the people of Sumatra, account it a great Beauty and perfection to have a great Belly. This figure of Brahma ftands upright,and at his Feet two other lefs carv'd figures,which, as they fay, are his two Sons, Sunnct and Sunn at an.

I mutt not forget, that the^^ ^ * Banians fay,this Town Naghera was the King's Seat and principal p 7 City, anciently the Head of the whole Kingdom otCambaia, and yjr-, that the City now properly call'd Camhaia^ and rais'd to great- J j nefs by the ruineofthis old, is a modern thing 5 whence I have (bmetimes fufpefted that the Indian Character call d Naghr ^,us d by the learned, was denominated from this City wherein it was anciently Ub'd 5 but 'tis onely a Conjedture 5 and I have learnt by long and much experience, that in the derivation and interpre tation of Names, efpeciallyof Places, thereisno truftingtothe relemblance of Words 5 becaufe byreaibnof the diverfity of Languages, and the cafual Conformity of Words which fignifie things fufficiently different, according to the variety of Places ) grofs errors are eafily admitted.

Concerning Religion, I have heard nothing particular of them, but believe them Gentiles as the reft, or perhaps, Atheifts, who may poffibly hold every thing for lawful, as well in believing as in eating. They are all fufficiently poor, and live for the moft part by begging, orexer- cifing the mofl: fordid Trades in the Common-wealth, which others difdain to meddle with s but they, either becaufe their • ^ 3 Rite teaches them fo, or neceffity inforces them, are not at all fhieof. March the fifth. We vifited the* King's Garden again, and many other Gardens, where we tafted divers fruits, and be held feveral Flowers of India unknown in Europe 5 amongft the reft, one very odoriferous which I kept in a Paper, which they call Ciompa. Without the City we faw the Saltpits, and alfo the Field by the Sea-fide, where the Indians are wont to burn the bodies of their dead 3 which may be known by the reliques of y many fires and pieces of bones not wholly burnt, which are feen 7 r I 2 fcatter 'd /The Travels of t'eter Delia Valle, t i /V y (catter'd about the fame. The next Morning early., we re- turn'd to this Field, and faw feveral Bodies burnt, and parti cularly obferv'd the Funeral of one Woman from the beginning to the end. They carry the Corps wrapt in a cloth of of ' a red colour for the moft part, and much in ufe among the 7 ' ans forother purpofes. They carry it not upon a Biere, as we do ? but ty'd to and hanging down like a lack 3 tron^. a ftafFiay d crofs two Men's (boulders. They make the funeral pile of wood, lay'd together in form of abed, of equal length and breadth, and fufficient to receive the Body &gt; upon which, beginning then to lament with a loud voice, they lay the carkafs naked and fu- pine, with the Face and Feet towards the Sea 5 which I believe, is likewife obferv'd (where the Sea is not) towards Riven,Lakes, and Cifterns, the Indians having a particular devotion to the Water 5 nor do I know, that herein they have refped to arty Region of Heaven. They cover the privities with a piece of wood, anoint the Hands and Feet, put a coal of fire in the Mouth 5 and then all things being prepar'd, theyfet fire firft at the Throat, and afterwards to the whole pile round about, be ginning firft at the Head, but with their Faces turn'd another way, as Virgil faith our Anceftors did 5 Then fprinkle Water on the ground round about the pile, which they continually ftir up with ftaves in their Hands, and blow with the motion of a cloth, to the end the flame may not fpread, but burn more fpeedily. The body being confum'd by degrees , they reduce the fire into a round form, and when all is burnt, they leave the allies, and fbmetimes a piece of a bone not wholly confum'd there in the fame place: The cloth wherein the body was wrapt before it was committed to the pile, they give in Charity to fome poor . , perfon prefent. Such as have where withall, are burnt with odoriferous and precious wood, in which the rich fpend much 5 but they that cannot reach lb high, ufe ordinary wood. Children under two years of age are not burnt but buried, as we (aw fome in the fame Field. Nor let the Reader wonder, that in the fame day and hour we hapned to fee fo many dead per- fons ^ for, befides that Cambaia is a large City and very po pulous, as all the Cities and Lands of India are i the Gentiles are wont to perform this Ceremony of the dead onely in the Morning, at a fet hour, and in that place ^ fo that all that dye in the whole City, during the twenty four hours of the day, are ' ^ ' ' l id ^ roil ^ t to ^at place at the fame hour.

I on the other fide gave this Father a Letter to their Fathers Re- fident at Agra, t6 whom I had vritten formerly from Verfta, defiring them to fend me fome correft Copy of the Terfian Books^ written by their Fathers inthatCourtj in order to get the lame printed at Rome ^ and by Sig: Alberto SciUing, I had underftood that my firft Letter was receiv'd there 5 and that the faid Fathers o( Agra knew me by report, and the relation of divers who had feen me in Perjia, particularly of this Sig; Alberto, In this other Letter from Cambaia, I acquainted them with my Voyage to Coa-^ and defiring them to write to me there, and remember to favour me with thofe Books. Having dilpatchcU the Father Jefuit, we return'd to the Dutch Houfe to have a Collation 5 and here we were entertain'd a good while with goodMufick by an Indian, who fung tolerably well, andplay'd upon a certain odd inftrument us'd in India 5 which pleas'd me well enough^ecaufeit was not fo obftreperous Mufick as the or dinary of the vulgar Indians, but rather low and very fweet,and theMufician was fkilful according to the mode of the Country, ^ y y having liv'd at the Court of fifapor, inthefervice of Adilpah, ^ His Inftrument was made of two round Gourds dy'd black andj^^ vernifti'd , with a hole bor'd in one of them, to reverberate the found. Between the one Gourd and the other,about thediftance of three fpans,was faftned a piece of wocd^pon which they both hung, and the firings which were many, partly ofbrafs^nd part ly of fteel,were extended,paffing over many little pieces of wood like fq, many bridges ^ and thefe were the frets, which he touch 'd with the left Hand to diverfify the founds, and the ftrings with the right, not with his Fingers or Nails, but with certain iron wires faftned to hisFingers,by certain rings like thimbles, where with he did notftrike the ftrings ftrongly, but lightly touch 'd them from the top downwards, fo that they render'd a found fufficiently pleafant. When he play'd, he hel&amp; the Inftrument at his breaft by a ftring that went round his nec\k, and one of the Gourds hung over his left fhoulder, and th^ other under his right arm, fo that it was a prety fight. Collation and Mufick ended, we were conducted about two Cos out of the City by the Dutch Merchants, and took the (ame wdyby which we came. We pafs'd over the five of wet ground, with the four Currents of Water, of which the fecond was the deepeft (having waited : m:The Travels of Peter OellaValle, ■ ■ waited a while for a tit hour} in company of a numerous CafiU of Coaches 3 Carts, Horfe-men and Foot-men, in the fame manner and circumftances as I writ before 5 onely the Water was now much higher then we had found it at our coming 5 lb that it came into all the Coaches , and we were fain toftand upright and hold faftby the roof of the Coaches, bare leg'd too, becaufe the Water came above the bottom of the Coaches to the middle of the leg. The Oxen and Horfes could fcarce keep their Heads above Water, and the Coaches being light, if Men hir'd purpofely had not gone along in the Water to hold them fteady, and break the courfe thereof by holding great flumps of wood on that fide the Tide came furioufly in, without doubt, the Water would have fwept them away. In this place on the left hand to wards the land in the ftioift ground,we beheld at a diftance many Fowls, as big or bigger then Turkies, go up and down, rather running then flying. They told us, they were the fame which the Portugals czW Taxar&amp;j Flamencos^ from their bright colour 5 and I think, they are thofe of whofe beaks Mir Mahhamnred in Sfahan , makes bow-rings for the King 5 although heerrone- ouQy takes it for the beak of the Cocnos^ or Phoenix, which good Authors defcribe,not a water Fowl,but rather an inhabitant of high Mountains.

And although innumerable Moors go daily into the neighbouring Territories of thzPortugals 5 nor are they wont to be forbidden ^ yet, my Cacciatbr , I know not upon what account, they prohibited very ftridily, I believe by his own procurement. When I had read this prohibition in my Pais, I fent him out of the City before-hand;, with order to crofs the River at another place a good way off, and meet me at the Sea-fide, where being among the Englijh^ he would be out of all all danger 3 but through the negligence of a Man of the Coun try whom he took todiredt him, either by his own will, as'tis moft likely, becaufe he knew not the way 3 or elfe, not having found Boats to pals the River eMewhere, a^ he (aid, he was di- reCied to crols it at the feme place near the Cuftom-houle, where we did 5 whereupon being ieen by the Officers, he was feiz'd upon, and they would not fuffer him to come by any means.

But we had laid all things fo together, that he did not difcover the truth, or perhaps did not care much to find it out. Wherefore leaving Cacciatur in the Governours Houfe 3 where he caus'd him to ftay with fundry promifes, about night I de parted the City 3 and crofs'd the River with Sebaftian Luis in my company, who having fent hisVeffel down the River , went alon^ with me by Land. On the other fide of the River, we waited fome hours for Coaches to carry us to the Sea-fide, which we were fain to hit'e at a Town lome diftance ofi^ and were flow in coming. But as foon as they came we got into their^ and travell'd the reft of the night to the Sea-fide. March the four and twentieth. At Day-break we got to the IU {hore fide, where we found the Prefident attended with all the Merchants of his Nations, who were giving order for di- Iparching their Ships which were ready to fet fail to Mucha^ or JMnchar^ in the Red Sea 5 namely, the two Ships, the Whale Dolphin^ wherewith I came into Indian for of the other three which I left in Bender of Kombru, they had fold the little Fri- gar which was in ill plight, to the Perftans, who defign d to make j ufe of her in the enterprize of Arabia, whither they had deter- iliin'd to pais alone, now the Englijh plainly refus d to joyn with them in the War-, and the other two great Ships having put in likewife at Surht , were foon after fentout again with Mafter ihdmpfon, who came with them from Perfta, it not being known in Surat whither. I was receiv'd by thePrefidentin hisTent, together with my Mary linatim 5 and foon after came Cacciatur jjjy Servant, and two Moors of^wr^/jby the favour of the Com- mendator of the Dutch ^ but I know not whether it were with his own good liking, though to us he pretended that it was. After my departure the Commendator went to vifit the Govern- our, and fince T was gone, and, as he laid, could not carry Cac ciatur out oi Surat^ he defir'd that he would give him to him,^ to the end he might live in his Houle with other Friends 5 which the Governour readily granting, the fame night, by the help of certain perlbns purpofely difguis'd in Indian Habit, he fent him by a lecure way to the Sea-fide, where he foiand me in the Tent of the Englijh Prefident. The fame Morning I went aboard the Ship call the Whale, (wherein I came) to vifit the Captain and take leave of my Friends, with whom alio I din d^ afterwards I went aboard the Dolphin , to vifit not onely the Captain who was my Friend, but efpecially my good Companion Sig: Alberto SchiUing^ho was aboard there in order to go to the Red Sea, in tending to pafs from thence into ^Ethiopia to the Court of the Abijjins , in cafe he could get Tranfportation , and were not hindred in the Turkilh Ports where he was to pafs, upon account of being a chrifiiani the Turks not willingly granting pailag6,to Chrijiians (efpecially Europeans') towards FSbabeJe^ in regard o K 2 tmThe Travels of Fcter Delia Valle, m the fufpitions they have of the intelligences and converfe with our Compatriots may have to their prejudice with that Prince. Wherefore taking leave of Sig: Alberta with many embraces^ of Mafter Rofel^ ( whom I had known in Verjia, and who being come from thence after me 5 was here fhipt for a Trading Voy-^ age) and of all my other Friends in the two Ships, I came back to fup and lye on tand in the Tent of the Prefident. March the twenty fifth. Early in the Morning I put my Goods into the Shallop of Sobafiian Luis, and alfb going aboard my felf, whilftthe Prefident went to his own Ships to difpatch them, fet fail for Daman 5 at night we caft Anchor in a narrow arm of i;he Sea, which enters far into the Land, of which fort of inlets there are many all along the coaft of India, which encompafling good portions of Land make many little Iflands 5 and becaufe the faid arms of the Sea are long and narrow like Rivers ^ and fome of them have little Rivers falling into them from the continent, ( although the water is fait, and they have no current but the ebbing and flowing of the Sea ) the Portugals term them in their Language Rios, Rivers 5 which I take notice of^ ESKlv /// / that it may be under ftood that all the Rios , or Rivers, ^ ; siSyc w hich I fhall name in the coaft of India &gt; and not fpecifie that they are ftreams of frefh water, are fuch arms of the Sea as this, improperly call'd Rivers. This, where we ftaid this night, is c&amp;WdRio diColel^, or Cdeque, I have better underftood that all the aforefaid inlets are not arms of the Sea, but really Rivers of frefh water ^ and the Tide of the Sea at ebbing and flowing being here very ftrong and overcoming that of the Rivers 5 hence it comes to pafs that 'tis hardly perceiv'd whether they have any ftream or no 5 and the water going far into the Land comes like- wife to be fait 5 but indeed they are Rivers, and form Iflands by their entring into the Sea with many mouths. They are almoft innumerable upon all the coaft of India, and the Tortugals . very truly call them #70/, Rivers. Wonder not at thefe doubts and various informations, for I could not underftand things tnoroughly at firft/or want ofconverfe with intelligent perfons? nor was it eafiefor me to judge right in the beginning 3 the firft appearance of things oftentimes deceiving even the wilfeft, as the faltneis of the water did me,in my judgement of thefe Riversj making me take them for arms of the Sea 5 which miftake, was lurthet d by the affirmation of moft of the ignorant Portugals. who not knowing more of this coaft then the (hore where the water is lalt, think that the Rivers,are fait water 5 but Time and tter intormations afiift my diligence in difcovering the truth ot things* March the twenty lixth. About noon wearriv'd at Daman, but unfeafonably, theb*/A* and Fleet of the being gone in the Morning, and we difcem'd them failing afar ott, but it was not poflible to overtake them, I advertis'd F.

Befides the Jefuits and the Church ot the See, (as they call the Duo mo, or Cathedral^ here are Dominican^ Francijcans, and, as I remember, Angujtines too ^ allg who have good Churches and Covents. The City is environ'd with ftrong walls of good fortification, andhafh a large Territory and many Townsunder it 5 and becaufe they are frequently at war with Ni&amp;amJciahsWhofe State(being govern d at this day by his famous Abiffine-Slave Melik^Ambar ) borders upon it by Land ^ there fore the Portugals here are all Horfe-men, and keep many good Arabian Hories, as they are oblig'd to do , going trequently out to war in defence of their Territory when occafion requires, though during my time here they were at peace. In Daman I fir ft tafted at the Father Rcftor's Table many ftrange Indian Fruits, fome of which are defcrib d by Carolus ClufiHs, and others not, which, as I was told, were after the writing of his Books brought into Eaji India from Brajilj or New Spain $ namely, Pa~ paia, Cafu or Cagiu , Ciambo, Manga or Amba, and Ananas $ all which feem'd tome paffibly good, and, though of different tafrs, not inferior to ours of Europe, efpecially Papaia, which is little efteem d in India ^ and, if I miftake not, is not mention d by the abovefaid Writer 5 in (hape and tafte, it much refembles our Melons, but is fweeter, and confequently to me feem d bet ter. Ananas is juftly efteem'd, being of a laudable tafte, though fbmething uncouth, inclining more to (harpnefs, which, with a mixture of fweetnefs renders it plealant. And becauie the faid Books mention it not, I ftiall briefly add, that to the out ward view it (eems, when it is whole^ to refemble our Pine- Apple, both in the divifions and the colour 3 faving that at the top it hath a kind of tuft of long ftrait leaves between green and white, which the Pine-Apple hath not, and which render it prety to look upon 5 'tis alfo different from the Pine-Apple, in that the hufks are not hard, but tender like the common fkin of Fruits ^ nor is it needful to take them off one by one, neither is any feed eaten, as the Pine-Nuts, which are within the hulks,- but | I ■' v'{f iH i ji' i' i i 17° fhe fravels ofFetcv Delia Vallc, Ijy . ? . / i. . *r // -y- 77 y — | %./ r ^ S/ z*y mfi // ✓ Ar*/ ^t4^r&gt; /. &gt;71 ^ /'^ / l£'/ /&lt; f .

In Daman^ I had from the Jefuits two confiderable pieces of News. Firft, that the two Ships, which, aslfaid, werefent from before my depar ture thence, upon fome unknown defign, went to Dabnl^ under pretext of Peace and Friendihip, as if to traffick in that Port^ and that the Moors of Dabnl had fpread Carpets, and prepar'd ahandfome entertainment for the principals upon ftiore; but the EngUjh having fairly landed, fuddenly got to certain pieces of Ordnance which were there 5 and nail'd them up 5 then putting their hands to their Arm8,began to fall upon the people of the Ci ty 5 who upon this fudden unexpected onfet, betook themfelves to flight, and were likely to receive great dammage 5 but at length a Portugal Faftor, and fome few others making head againft the Englijh^ and animating the Citizens to do the like, turn'd the fcale of the vi&amp;ory, and in a (hort time beat out all the Englijh, killing many ofthem, and conftraining the reft to fly away with their Ships ^ who neverthelelsin their flight took two Vedelsof Dabulj which were in the Port richly laden, but un provided, as in a fecure place ; which wasnofmall dammage to the City, and afforded a rich booty to the Englijh. This aftion, I conceive, was done by the Erzglifo out of fome old grudge againft the City of Dahul, or perhaps, onely to force it to permit them free Trade 5 and they ufe deal to thus with fucb ports as will not admit them thereunto. The other News, was that Prete Janni , Ring of JEthiopia and the Abijjlns , was by means of the Jefuits reconcil'd to the Roman Church, and be come a good Catholick, intending that his whole Country ftiould do the fame 5 which if true, is indeed a thing of great con- fequence. March the feven and twentieth. About noon we departed from Daman towards Baffaim^ in the fame Barque or Almadia y and fail'd all the day 5 at night, in regard of the contrary cur rent and danger of Pirats, who cannot eafily be feen and avoid ed in the dark, we caft Anchor under a place call'd Dani}* March eight and twentieth, Continuing our courfe, in the Morning we efpy'd fome Ships, which we (ufpeded to be Pirats Malabars and therefore fetching a compafs we made but little way forwards.

But, left the people of the Fleet, which we found there with the Cafila^ fhould moleft our Boat, as fome- times 'tisufual, and take away ohe Sea-men for the (erviceof the Navy, we ftay'd a while without the City, cafting Anchor a little wide of the (hore 5 and in the mean time I fent notice to F.

Of the City t cannot fay any thing, becaufe it was night both at my entrance, ftay, and coming aw^y 5 I can onely intimate, that it is wholly furrounded with ftrong walls, and, if I took good notice, (eems to me greater then Daman 5 but of late years many buildings were deftroy'd by a horrible tempeft, and are not yetre-edifi'd, I found in the Colledge of Bajfaimy F.

In the Morning the Fleet fet fail, and going off the ftiore we came to the Illand where they take in frefh water ^over againft a City , ill view at a little diftance, which they call Saljette$ and the pl^ce where we ftay'd (being-a large and populous Ifland) 19 call'd in the PortugalTongue V dguadai and here we ftay'd all day^ecaufe the wind was fo contrary that could not get off that point of Land 5 and for that divers of the Galeots andnewFrigats built to be fent and arm*d in Qfyo were not in order to depart, and we were fore'd to ftay their preparation. March the one and thirtieth. At Sun-rife we put to Sea for G^, but were flow in getting forth to the Main be fore we could fet fail 5 becaufe the Tide was ftill going out, and there was fo little water left that our Frigat run a ground. At length the Tide turning, we row a 4 out of the ftreit between the City and the Ifland 3 and being come into the broad Sea hois'd all our fails. About mid-night following, we arriv'dat Cianl 3TheTravels 0/Peter Uclla vane, dlJl but enters not into the Port, becaufe it Rands much 1 where the Sea entrinz far into within Land upon a precipice, wnere tne o 6 the Bay between the Hills and the low Shore, (into which alfo is defchargd the mouth of a River) makes an ample and fecufe harbour j wherefore by reafon of the darknefs of the nisht, which in this place is no feafonable time, the Fleet would not enter, but we rode at the Rivers mouth t.U break Afrit the firft, Entring into the Port in the Morning, wecaft Anchor under the City upon the fhore , where nevt rtheleis. the water is fo deep, and our Galeots came fo near the bank, that we went aftiore by a bridge. In the entrance of the City and Haven, on the right hand, almoft Southwards wefaw that famous Hill which the PcrtvgaU call Morro dt Cta*l, command^ ing the Harbour and all the adjacent City 5 on the top of it ftands a ftrong Caftle, which was fometimes poffefi d Dacint namely, by Nizam-Schiah, to whom alfo the whole Territory about it belongs 5 and when the laid King made war with the Portugals, the Moors did great mifchief to them from the top of this Mountain, and another which ftands near the Harbour, but lomething more inwardly , dncharging great Ar tillery from thence upon the City ana the mouth of the Port, fo that no Ship could enter.

In the fame Houfe dwelt Signor- --a worthy and grave Souldier, who being a Friend to my faid Companion, we convers'd together till it was late, and then our Galeot being come back we went to embark 5 but neither did the fleet depart this night 3 as we fuppos'd it would.^pr// the third^A rumor of de parting being Ipread abroad about noon, we put out to Sea, and caft Anchor at the motith of the Harbour, where many other Ga- leots were gather 5 d,expe6i:ing thefetting forth of the whole fleet, but neither did we depart this day nor the night enfuing.

In the Afternoon we fail'd by a Fort, which is the onely one pof- (eis'd near the Sea by the Moors of Daman, that is, by Nizam Set- ah, which Fortiscall'd Danda Ragiaport 5 and at night we caft Anchor under a deep fhore call'd iCe^/.We did not fail in the night time, becaufe t\\tCapU was numerous, confifting, by my conje- • —» fture, of above 200.

Ofthefe three Princes, the neareft to the Moghol, whofe Territory lyes toward the Sea on the Weft, and Contines with the Tortngals at Giatil and other places, and who is properly ftyl'd King of Dackn^ ^ from the greateft Province) is call'd by the name, or rather firname, hereditary to all that reign in this State, Nizam Scikh, which many interpret/?^ delta Lancia ^ King of the Lance^ alluding to the Per/fan word Nize, which (ignifies a Lance 5 but I conceive they are miftaken, becaufe his name is Nizam Scthh, and not Nize Sciah^ as according to this interpretation it (hould be: Wherefore! have heard others, perhaps, better interpret it, Rt de' Falconi, King of Falcons^ or Hawks, from the word Nizam, which in the Indian Tongue, they fay, fignifiesa Hawk or other Bird of Prey. And whofoever reigns here, always retains this lirname ^ becaufe whileft he was not anabfolute Prince, but a Minifter of that other great King of this was his Title and Office under that King. The now reigning, is a Boy of twelve years old, who therefore doth not govern it, but an Abyffine Slave of the Moors Religion, call'd Melik^Amber, adminifters the State in his ftead, and that with fuch authority, that at this day this Territory is more generally known and cali'd by the name of Melickis Country, then the Kingdom of Nizam- Sciah, Neverthelefs this Melik^Amber governs not fraudulently, and with defign to ufurp, by keeping the King (hut up, as I have fometimes heard 5 but according as I have better underftood fince from perfons informed nearer hand, he adminifters with great fidelity and fubmiffion towards the young King 5 to whom fieverthelefs, they fay, he hath provided, or already given to Wife a Daughter of his own , upon fecurity that himfelf fhall be Governour of the whole State as long as he lives. This Melik Amber \s a Man of great parts, and fit for government, but, as they fay, very impious, addided to Sorcery 5 whereby 'tis thought that he keeps himfelf in favour with his King, and that for works of Inchantments, ( as to make prodigious buildings, and with good luck, that the fame may laft perpetually and lucceed well ) he hath with certain Superftitions us'd in thofe Countries committed moft horrid impieties and cruelties, killing hundreds of his Slave's Children, and others^ and offering them as in Sacrifice to the invok'd Devils^with other abominable ftories which I have heard related 5 but becaufe not feen by my felfInto the EAST-INDIES. felf, I affirm not for true. The Ambadadorofthis Nizam-Sczafr in Perfia^ is that Hhabefe Chan, an Abyffine alfo, whomlfaw a my being there. Of ftfange things, they relate that Niz&gt;am-Sciah y hath I know not where in his Country a piece of Ordnance fb vart 5 that they fay it requires 15000. pound of Powder to charge it 5 that the Ball it carries^ almoft equals the height of a Man 5 that the metal of the piece is about two fpans thick, and that it requires I know not how many thoufand Oxen^beddes Elephants to move it 5 which therefore is ufelefs for war 3 and (erves onely for vain pomp. Neverthelefs this King fo eftecms it, that he keeps it continually cover'd with rich cloth of Gold, and once a year comes in perfon to do it reverence, almoft adoring it ^ and indeed, although thefe Kings are Mwrs , yet they ftili retain much of the ancient Idolatry of the Countries, wherein Ma- hometifm is little , or not yet univerfally fetled. The (ccond of the three pety Kings, whofe Country joyns to that of the Mogh s oly but borders upon the Sea Eaftward in the Gulph of Bengalaj* he who (for the fame reafons mention'd concerning Nizam-Sciah) Is ^ S call'd by the hereditary firnameofCw^-^fi^^jWhich fomeerrone- outly expound Tolo d' i Re^ the Vole of Kings, being deceiv'd by the Arabick word Cutb, which fignifies the I^ole, and is us'd by the Arabians and Verfians, to denote fupream excellency ^ un- derftanding (e.^. ) by Folo de i Savii, 0 di Sapienza, ihe Pole of Wife-men, or of Wifdom, the wifeft Man in the world 5 by Polo di Sant 1 ta 0 della Legge ^ ibePok ofSanffityand the Law, the greateft pitch, and the higheftobferver of thedivine Law^ and io in all other like Cafes • but, t fay,! believe they are miftaken ^ jmd there feems to me more truth in the expofition of others, who interpret RedeiCani, King of Dogs, from£«M, which in the Language of India fignifies a Dog, becaufe he was Mafter of the Dogs to that fupream King. Under his jurifdiftkn is ^ Gnlcondalar, where, I think, he hath his Royal Seat, and Mifli- * fatan, a famous Port in the Gulph of Bengala, Laftly 3 the third of the three Regtdi, is he who hath his Seat in Fifipor, and reigns in the Country of Telongane , bordering upon the Portu- gals Territories atG^, more Southwards then the two before mentkm'd. Some will have Vifayor and Coa belong to the Pro vince of Dacan, and that Telenga much more remote,toward the South. The truth is, India and the Provinces thereof is very confus'd 5 forafmuch as the Indians themfelves being illiterate cannot diftinguilh it aright, and the Portugals have all their knowledge thereof from the vulgar of the ignorant Indians, whofe Language they underftand not well, and extreamly cor rupt in pronuntiations 5 therefore I cannot fpeak any thing cer tain concerning the fame, as neither have the Portugal Writers been able to do, though perfons very exadt and fufficient. But to return to my purpofe, the proper name of him that now reigns is Ibrahim , but his hereditary firname (as the others) is Jdil-Sciah, or idalSciah, which fignifies not giufto Re, a Jnfl L 2 King, &lt;7-(fa. A r*/ •11 I 6 The i ravels of Peter Delia Vallc, II m King, as fome think from the Arahick^otd Adil, denoting JuJi . but rather, in my opinion, as fome others fay, Re del/e Chiavi, King of the Keys, bom Adil or ldal 0 zn Indian word importing Keys, he having been in times pafs'd Superintendent of the Keys, (of the Treafury perhaps, or Archives ) under the fupream Ring. Sometimes thefe Princes have been call'd Nizam-malu^ Adil-Chan, and fo the others with the words, either Mekk. or y? / Chan, in (lead of Sciah, which is all one 5 for Melek or Malu^ (as fome corruptly read) lignifies a in Arabick^, as Chan doth alfo in Turkijh, and Sdah in P erf an : And becaufe thefe . C.^l^three Languages arc fufficiently familiar, andalmoft common . ^ to the Moors^ therefore they have us J d fometimes one word, &gt;W^^^ometimes another^ but in later times it feems that thofe who 7 / now rule, rejecting the words Melek^nd Chan, are better pleas d with the Ferfian Title Sciah, as being, perhaps, more modern to them 5 whence they are ordinarily call'd now Nizani-Sciah,CHtb' Scikh, and Adil-Sciah , which are the three Princes of whom I undertook to give an account, as perfons whom I (hall have fre quent occa(ion to mention in thefe Writings. And to leave no thing unfaid 5 I ihall add, that Ntzam-Sciah, or rather his Governour MdihcAmbar , makes war frequently and brave ly againft the Great Moghol, upon whom he borders: Cutb- Sciah , I know not whether he aftually makes publick war againft himjbut at leaft he fails not to aflift his Neighbour Nizatn- Sciah with money. The fame doth alio Adil-Sciah, but fecretly and by under-hand ^ not daring through I know not what mean fear declare himfelf an enemy to the Moghol-^ I fay, mean fear, becaufe not bordering upon him, ( for the two other Princes lye between them ) and being able, as they fay, upon occafioa to bring into the field a hundred thoufand men, he feems juftly chargeable with timeroufnefs and cowardice ; fince, me-thinks, he that hath a hundred thoufand men at his command ought not to fear the whole world 5 or, if he doth,he is a very Poltroif: But indeed, fears the Moghol, yea, he fears and ob- ferves him fo much that he payes him an annual Tribute 5 and when|the Moghol fends any Letter to him, which is always brought by fome very ordinary common Souldier or SlaVe, he goeth forth with his whole Army to meet the Letter and him that brings it,who being conduced to the Palace fits down there, whilft ftands all the time, and the Letter being lay'd upon a Carpet on the pavement, before he offers to put forth his hand to take it up, he bows himfelf three times to the earth, do ing reverence to it after their manner. Moreover, I have heard that this Ibrahim Adil-Sciah who now reigns, fome years ago poyfon'd his own eldeft Son, as fufpefted of being likely to be come one day a difturber of the Common-wealth and the pub-* lick quiet, being difpleas'd with him onely becaufe he once with ^too much freedom perfwaded him to deny the Moghol the ac- cuftom'd Tribute 5 faying, that with the Tribute alone which he pay'dInto the EAST-INDIES. 77 nav'd voluntarily he dutft undertake to make a mighty war up on him and never pay him Tribute more ; which 5 if true,was cer tainly in this Prince a ftrange effeft of fear. This Adtl-Sctah hath marry d one of his Daughters to Cutb-Sdah, and with Nizam- Sc iJ he conftantly maintains, and frequently renews alliance; fo that they are all three faft friends, and firmly united together^ I have alfo heard that Adil-Sciah ufes to wear his Beard very long, contrary to the other two, who are (haven after the mode ot Terfm and India. They fay the prefent Ibrahim Adtl-Saah is in firm, by reafon ofa great hurt receiv d by a Wolfin his hips, fo that he cannot ride on Horfe-back 5 and hence perhaps it is that he is fo peaceable and timerons, infirmities undoubtedly much deieftina the fpirits of Men. All thefe three Princes are Moors, as I faid before, although their Countries abound with innume rable Gentiles. Cutb-Sciah alone, as I have heard, is .to**?, ot the Sect of the Verfuns , but the other two, I conceive, are as the Turks and theMoghoh which yet I affirm not, becaufe I have not perfect certainty thereof. The Ring of Perfia chentbes all thefe three Princes fufficiently,and they have great corrdpon- &lt;lence by interchangeable Ambaflies and Prefents, all whiehis yy &gt; onely in reference to make greater oppofition to theMoghol ^ upon whom they border^ and whole greatnefs is equally pre- 0/^ fy- Judiciall to them all. And fo much may fuffice concerning^ ^ April the fifth. We fet fail again, and in the Afternoon pafs'd V It, by the City DabitL which belongs to the Dominions of Mil- ' Sciahj and ftands hid amongft Hills in a lovy Plain , fothat tis - / fcarcely feen. After which, we pafsd within two Leagues of a Point or Promontory which the Vortngals cdXpabulfalfoloecznie it deceives fuch as come from far by Sea, making them take it for the Point of Dahitl, to which it refembles.

Arriving before Day at the fhore of Goa, we began to enter into the lalt ■r. • «• I AU whirh tnePortmaU River, ox Rio, astheyfpeak, of fait water which the Portugal call Burro, di Goa upon the mouth of which River, which is lui- AJ. ficiently broad, ftand two Forts, one on each fide, witn good /va^ a-ax ^ f1 he Travels of Peter Delia Valle, pieces of Artillery planted upon them to defend the En trance. / ; VIJ I. Tis to be known that the City of Goa 3 at this day the Head ■£'/ .-/it a lA of all the Dominion of the Portngals in India, is fituate here in ly##, / ^ Vne of thefe lilands, of which, as I laid beforej there are innume- ^ ' r.ible upon all the Coaft of India, made by the feveral Rivers which divide them from the main-land. The City is built in the iniiiolt part of thelfland toward the Continent 5 and therefore the v hole Iiland is plentifully inhabited with Townsand places o^ Recreation, and particularly, upon the River 5 which is on either fide, adorn'd with Buildings and Houfes, furrounded with Groves of Palm-Trees, and delightful Gardens. The grc ateft part of the Ifland is inclos'd with a Wall, with Gates at the places forpaflage, continually guarded for fccurity againft the attempts of Neighbours, and alfo to prevent thePxi ^htof Slaves and I hefts 5 fince onelythat River being crofs'd you enter prefently into the Territory of Jdil Sciah and the Moors - but 'tis otherwile toward the Sea-fide, for all the Coaft which is belet with other fmall fflands and Pen-infula's, for a good fpace belongs to the ?ortugals, being inhabited with Townsand di vers Churches. The City which lyes on the right hand of the River; as you enter into the inmoftrecefs isfufficiently large buil t , partly, on a Plain, and, partly, upon certain pleafant riills , from the tops whereof the whole filand and the Sea are di{cover d with a very delightful profpedt. Tlie buildings of the City are good, large and convenient, contrived for the moft pari for the benefit of the wind and frefh Air, which is very ne- ctiiary in regard of the great heats, and alfo for reception of y y /} vs a / ^ rcat ^ a ^ ns o ^three Moneths of PaufecaL which are lune P / / anci ' which not upon account of the heat (although r - - ^ j j —- v^imc neat Ultnough it be very great at that time, but greateft of all in when the Snms.nthe Zemth ) but of the great Rain, the f/rLj'call the Winter ot the Earth. Neverthelefs the buildings have not much ornament or exquifitenefs of Art, but are rather plain, and almoft all without beautifyings.

But returning to my purpole ? whilftwe were coming to the City by the River betimes in the Morning, we met the Vice-Roy whowasgoing to the mouth ot theitarn?, to difpatchaway Kuy Treira de, Andrada^ whom with five or fix Ships (a fmall prepa-* j ration indeed) he fent to the relief and to make war y J again ft the Perftansl having like wife appointed divers other Ships ' to be fent after him bomCiaU, Dio, and other Ports of the Por-/^ X iugab 5 which if they go 3 may be fufficient for fome confiderable exploit: but the Orders of the Vice -Roy in other places God knows how they will be executed in his abfence. The fudden departure of Ruy Freira, made me forry that I had not th e op portunity to (ee him and fpeak with him, as I extreamly defir d, and perhaps, it would not have been unacceptable to him. Ar riving at the City, we caft Anchor under the Dogana , or Cuftom-houfe, where all Ships commonly ride, to wit, iuch as are not very great 3 for thefe ftay either at the barr in the mouth of the River, or in fome other place thereof where they have the deepeft water. Being come thither, I prefently gave notice of my arrival toF.Fr^: Leandroot the Anuntiation , whom 1 had known in Terfia, and who was here Provincial Vicar of the difcalceated Carmelites of India and Perjia, 1 alfo advertis d the^ Fathers Jcfuits thereof ,for whom I brought fundry oftheirGene- rals Letters from Ktf/^e,written afFedionately to recommend me to them. F.

A little after, it was very great contentment to me to fee and know F. Antonio Schi^am^ your Kinfman 3 now a very old man, who was faluted by me upon your account 5 andfo for this time I gave him a fuccind Relation of you, puting him in mind of your Child-hood. He came to vifit me with F. Vincen%o Sorrtntino oflfchia, whom I had formerly feen in Terfta, and who not living then with fhe Jefuits, came with the Spanifti Ambaflador as his Chaplain in that Voyage. Thefe two Fathers being Italians, were fentby F. Andrea Palmiroj Vifitorof the Jefuits, and then their Supe rior in Goa 0 both to complement me in his Name, and to give him more exaft information of me, whom he had never feen^ nor fo much as known by Fame, faving what his General's Let ters fignifi'd to him. Wherefore after they had vifited me, and underftood what was my intention to do , they went to give account thereof to the Father Vifitor, faying, that they would return again, as accordingly they did a good while after, offering me in the Name of the F. Vifitor their Covent of Profefsjd Houfe, where they pray'd me to go and lodge, at leaft till I were provided of a Houfe s adding, that they would alfo provide a convenient refidence for Mariam Tinatin , who was } thank'd them, and accepted the favour as to my ielt, and this with the approbation alfo of F.

But becaufe it was late that day, and there was not time to difpatch my Goods at the Dogana^ 'l did not land, but remain d in the Ship with intention to do fo the next day. Ayril the ninth.

Wherefore proceeding to the Church of the Carmelites, which ftands at the edge of the City upon a pleafant Hill, with a very delightful profpeft, I heard Mafs there, and ftay'd both to dine, fup, and lodg with them, dyril the tenth. Early in the Morning I went to the Ship, landed my Goods, difpatch'd them at the Cuftom-houfe, and having carry'd them to the Houfe of Sig' Lena da Cugna, where MarUm Tinatinwas, I went to quarter (till the Houfe taken forme were emptied, clean'd, and prepar'dj) in the Covent of the Profefs'd Houfe of the Jefuits, where I was received by the Vifitor, the Provincial, the Provoft, and the reft, with much courtefie, and with their accuftomed Charity and Civility. I found there many Italian Fathers, of which Nation the Society makes frequent ufe, efpecially in the Miffions of China, Japan, India, and many other places of the Eaft ^ befides the two above-nam'd, I found of Italians F .Chrijioforo Boro, a Milanefe, call'd Breno'm India 6 ( not to offend the Portugal's ears with the word Boro, which in ^ their Language do's not found well) a great Mathematician 5 Jf/u rul and another young Father who was afterwards my Confeflbr 5 F.

The Proceffion was made by the whole Clergy, with a greater Ihew of green boughs then clothes, and with many reprefentations of myfteries by perfons dilguis'd, fictitious ani mals, dances and mafkerades 5 things which in our Countries would more fute with Villages then great Cities.

May the eleventh, A Portugal Gentleman coming from the Court oiSpain by Land, to wit, by the way of Turkic, and, as they faid, in a very fhort time, and with Letters from the Court dated in the end of the laft O&amp;ober, brought news amongft other things of the Canoni- ' zation ot five Saints made together in one day,namely,ofS.

The Currier who went into Spam with the tidings of thelofsof Ormuz 9 thisPor-^ tugal Gentleman faid he met him at Marseilles ^ and concerning the Marriage between Spain and England^ he brought no intelli* / genceof any conclufion, fo that I belive, the news of V' loft chiefly by the fault of the will occafion muchdifficul- ty in the Treaty of that Marriage. May the feventeePlg Four Italian Bare-footed Carmelites arriv'd in Goa, being fent by their Fathers at Rome into Perfta 5 but having heard at Aleppo how the Fathers of Perjta were troubled by thefateof thofe newChri* ftians who were difcover'd and flain the year before, and efpeci- ally that they had nothing to live upon 5 they not knowing what to do, and being terrifi'd with the Relations of divers Merchants who aggravated things fufficiently 3 and being fo advis'd by fome 5 who, perhaps, like not the coming of fuch Fathers into Perjia y refolv'd to come into Ifulia, and to Goa to the Vicar Provincial, whither they brought no frefti News from Rome, having depart ed from thence Eleven Moneths before. They came almoft all lick, having fuffer'd much in the Defarts of Arabia, and other places of the journey, where they had felt great fcarcity 5 and for all this they would needs obferve their Lent and Fafts by the way, fuftaining themfelves almoft folely with Dates, which is a very hot food 5 and withall the alteration of the Air,very hot too, and unufual to them in the hight of Summer, was the occafion of their being all fick. Two of them arriv'd this day, and the two others the day after 5 becaufe they came from Majcat in fe- veral .Ships, Of thefe four Bare-footed C^me/iter, within a few days three dyed, and one alone after a long and dangerous (icknefs efcap'd.

At night themfelves, and divers of their Friendsj made Fire-works throughout the City. • And in favour of them the chief Tortugals^ went the fame night up and down the ftreets in a great Troop, clad in feveral difguifes, after the manner of a Mafcheradc. I alfo bore a part in the folemnity 3 out of my devotion to the new Saint 5 and according to the liberty which every one took of habiting himfelf as hepleas*d 5 I put my felfinto the garb of an Arabian Gentleman of the De- fart, which was accounted very brave and gallant 5 I accom- pany'd with Sig: Antonino, Son of Sig: Antonio Varaccio, my friend « a vouth of about twelve years old 3 who was one of thofe wta) went in the day time to the Vice-Roy, and I cloth'd him ijBT^rfian Habit of mine which I had brought from Terfta, or ratner like a nohleChizilbafe Souldier, very odd and brave 5 fo that we two were a fufficiently delightful fpedtacle to the whole City. May the one and twentieth. In the Morning the Bare-footed Fathers fung in their Church a folemn Mafs ingrati- Arum a&amp;ionem for the above-faid Canonization of Santa Terefia, upon whofe praifes an Anguftine Father made an eloquent Ser mon j the Vice-Roy and a multitude of people being prefent thereat. * May the three and twentieth. The Sun entringinto I obferv'd that the Rain begun in Goa , and it happens not alike in all the Coaft of India 5 tor it begins firft in the more Souther* ly parts of Capo Comorni^ and follows afterwards by degrees, ac cording as places extend more to the North 5 fo that in Cambaia y and other more northern parts, it begins later then in Goa 5 and the further any place lyes North , the later it begins there. Whence it comes to pafs that in the Terfian Ephemerides, or Al manacks, they ufe to let down the beginning of Parfcecal^ or the time of Rain in India^ at the fifteenth of their third moneth, call d which falls upon the third of our Junej becaufe they have obferv'd it in the more Northern parts of as in Cam- haia^ Surkt^ and the like, where the Perjians have more com merce then in other more Southern places. In likewife, for the moft part the beginniiigof the Rain is inthefirft days of P' e yet fometimes it anticipates, and fometimes falls fome- thing later with little difference. Tis obferv'd by long expe- ncnce that this Rain in India, after having lafted fome days at nrlt, ceales, and there return I know not how many days of fair weather j but thofe being pafs'd, it begins again more violent then ever, and continues for a long time together. By this Rain, as 1 obferv'd, the heat diminifheth, and the Earth which before was very dry and all naked ,. becomes cloth'd with n jw verdure, and various colours of pleafant flowers, and efpe- cia!,\ the Air oecomes more healthful, fweet, and more benigne both to found and infirm. The arm of the Sea^ or River, which ^ • encompafles mfmInto the EAST-INDIES. enccmpafles the Ifland of Goa, and is ordinarily fait, notwitH- ftanding the falling of the other little frefti Rivers into it^ with ^ the inundation of great ftreams which through the great Rain ' y flow from the circumjacent Land, is made likewife wholly , frcfti &gt; whence the Country-people who wait for this time, derive water out of it for their Fields of Rice in the Ifland of God and the neighbouring parts, which being temperM with this fweet moifture, on a fuddain become all green. 'June the firft , I fpoke firft to the Vice-Roy of Goa^ Don Franccfco dd Gdwa, Count of Bidigncira , Admiral of the Indian Sea, and ! ^ ) Grand-fon of that D. Vafco deGama. who difeover'd Eaft-India^ ( -T ) in which this Don Francefco was fometimes Vice-Roy, and was once taken captive in Africa with Ring Sebafiian. I delay'd fee ing him fo long, becaufe I was buli'd for a Moneth after my ar rival in changing my Habit and providing a Houfe, fo that I went not abroad 5 befides, that the Vice-Roy was likewife employ 9 d many days after in difpatching the Fleets which went to China and Zeilan i and after they were gone, he retir'd to a place out of Goa^ to recreate himfelf for many days 5 fo that I had no opportunity fooner. I prefentedto him two Letters from Rome, which I brbughtdireded to hisPredeceflbr in my recommendation, one from Sig:Cardinal CrefienthyZnd the other from the Duke of Alhaquerqne th^n Ambaflador at Rome for the Catholick King 5 and he, without reading them, in my prefence faid, that without that recommendation he (hould have ex- prels'd all fiting Civilities to me, and that he was glad to fee arid know me, with many other Complements and courteous offers. Hehad nolongdifcourfe with me, becaufe many other Gentlemen of the Council, and other perfons of the Govern ment expected to have Audience, but when I went away, he told F. Morigad the Jefuit his Confeffor who introduced me, that at a more convenient opportunity he defir d to talk with me more at length of the things of Perfia , and that he would ^ lend for me 5 and in the mean time defir'd a writing in difcotrfe which I had made a few days before concerning the Warrs of Perfia^oi which his faid Confeflbr who had feen it 9 had given him notice* wherefore I gave it to him with my own hand, as I had written it in my Native Tufcan Tongue, and F.

Here, after many Companies of Canarine Chriftians of the Country had march'd by with their Enfignes, Drums and Arms, leaping and playing along the ftreets, with their naked Swords in their Hands, for they are all Foot 5 at length all the Cavaliers run, two carriers on Hone-back, one downwards from the Church of Saint Vaul towards the City-, and the other upwards, running matches of two to two, or three to three, according as their attire agreed, with their Morifco Cymiters, and at laft they came all down marching together in order, and fo went to the Piazza of the Vice-Roys Palace, and fo the folemnity ended. I ftood to fee this fhew in the fame ftreet of Saint Taul, in the Houfe of one whom they call King of the Illands of Maldiva, or Maladiva^ which sire an innumerable company of fmall Iflands, almoft all united together, lying in a long fquare form towards the Weft,* not far from the Coaft of India^ of which Illands one of this Man's Anceftors was really Ring, but being driven out of his Dominion by his own people, tied to the Vortngals and turn'd Chriftian, with hopes of recoveriog his Kingdom by their help. Yet the Portngals never attempted any thing in his behalf and fo he and his defcendents remain deprived of the Kingdom Enjoying ontly the naked Title which the Portugals being now ally'd to him ftMl give him 3 and becaufe many Merchants Ships come from thole Iflands to trade in the Ports of the Portugalf, they force the faid Ships to pay a fmall matter of Tribute to him as their lawful Sovereign : of which, though the Governours of Ports, to whom upon neceffity he muft entruft, purloin aboVe halffrom him ^ neverthelefs he gets at this day by it about three thoufand Crowns yearly, and therewith fupports himfelf. The like Fates have befallen many other Princes in Indit, who hoping in the Portugals^ have found themfelves deluded. Wherein Reafon of State is but ill oblerv'd by the Portugals, becaufe by this projeeding , they have difcourag d all others from having confidence in them &gt; whereas had they affifted and protected them, as they ought and might eafily, and with fmall charge have done upon fundry fair occafions, they would by this time have got the love of 2\\ India ^ and themfelves would by the ftrength and help of their Friends, undoubtedly, have be come morepotent, as alfo, without comparifon, more fear'd by their Enemies. 'June the nine and twentieth. This year the Moors began their Kamadhan, according to the Rules of my Caicalation. j«/ythe five and twentieth, being the Feaft of Saint James , the Protestor of Spaing was folemnis'd with the ! - fameInto the EAST-INDIES. ' 89 fame gallantry of Cariers and Drcffes, as are above defcrib'd, faving that the Vice-Hoy heard Mais in the Church ot St. James. fn the Evening, I went with Sig: Ruy Gomez Boraccio, a Prieft V, and Brother of Sig: Antonio Btroccio to the Church of Saint Vames. which (lands fomewhat diftant without the City, upon . y, the edge of the Ifland towards the main Land oUdil-Sciah.^W^ ^ which is on the other fide of a little River, or Arm of the Sea. * ' For which reafon, theTfland is in this as well as many other dan- ^ a 1 ' gerous places fortift'd with ftrong walls 5 and here there is a Gate upon thepafs, which is almoft full of people, going and coming from the main Land, andiscall'd by the Indians Benajiarni, by which name fome of our Hiftorians mention it in their wri ting's concerning thefe parts ^ as Ojonus ^ A4ajf£us , occ. whic _ Gate as likewife many others, which are upon divers places ot paiia^e about the iQand, is guarded continually with Souldiers, commanded by a Captain who h^ththe care thereof, and for whom there is built a fineHoufe upon the walls ot the Illand , - which in this place are very high, forming a kind of Baftion, or rather a Cavaliero, or mount for, Ordnance ^ 0.91 very well^de- fign'd, but fufficiently ftrong, whereip are kept pieces of Artillery for defence of the place. We went to yifi^: t^e faid Captain,, who was then Sig: Manoel Pereira de U Gerqla, and from the high Bal conies of his Houfe and the Baftiqn, we enjoy'd the goodly pro- fpeftofthe Fields roundabout, both of the Ifland and the Con tinent, being difcernable to a great diftance^ i The Captaip en tertain d us with • the Mufick of his three Daughters, whofung and play'd very well after the Portugal manner upon the Lute, after which we return'd home. About the Church of Saint James are fome few habitations in fornvof a little Town, which is alto callM Santiago and the way from thence to the City is a ve- rv fine walkjthe Country being all green, and the way-fides belet with Indian Nut-trees 5 (which the call and their fruit Cocco) the Gardens andHoufes of Pleafure on either fide contributing to the delightfulnefs. thereof, being full of lundry fruit-trees unknown to us*, as alfo becaufe in Winter-cime the very walls of the Gardens are all green with mofs, and other herbs growing there, which indeed b onq, of the pleafantelt fights that I have feen in my days, and the rather becaule tis natural and without artifice. The fame happens, I believe, not in this Ifland onely, but in all the Region roundabout. In the field adioyning to the City, near the mines of a delerted build- inu, once intended for a Church, but never fimfh d, is a work of the Gentiles, fometimesJLords of this Country, namely, one of the greatefl: Wells that ever I beheld, round 5 and about twenty / of my Paces in Diametre, and very deep ^ it hath Parapets, or Walls breaft-high round about with two Gates, atone ot which is a double pair of ftairs leading two ways to the bottom, v to fetch water when it is very low. the fix and twentieth, I went out of the City to a place of pleafure in the luand, wherepo ■ ■ » The Travels of Peter Delia Valle, was a Ghiifch of Saint Ann&lt;t^ to which there was a great con- courfe of people, becaule it was her Feftival. This Church ftands very I o W j built amongft many Country dwellings;, partly, of the TOanders who live there, and partly, of the Tortugals who have Houfes of Pleafure there to fpend a moneth for recreation. The place is very delightful amongft Palmetoes and Groves of other Trees, and the way leading to it is extreamly pleafant, all cover'd with green. After I had heard Ma{s here, Sig: Gio~ vanni da Cojia de Menecas^ a F riend of mine whom I found there, carry d me to dine withhirti at theHoufe of a Vicar or Parifh- Prieft of another Church not far diftant, and offmall Building, which they call Santa Maria di Loreto, where we fpent the whole day in converlation with the faid Vic^r and other Friends. At night becaufe it rain'd, I caus'd my felf to be carry'd home in one of thofe Carriages which the Poriugals call Rete, being no thing elfe but a net of cords ty'd at the head and feet, and hang ing down from a great Indian Cane 3 in which Net (which is of the length of a Man, and fbwide that opening in the middle, (for the two ends are ty'd faft to the Cane ) 'tis capable of one perfon^) a Man lyes along very conveniently with a cuftiion un der his head, although fomewhat crooked ^ to wit, with the feet and head advant'd towards the Ligatures, and the middle part of the body knore pendulous under the Cane, which is car ry'd upon the flibulders of two men before, and two bthind 5 if the perfon be light, or the way (hort, two IVIen onely bear it, one before, ancr the other behind. Thefe Nets are different from the Palanchini and theAndor 5 for in thefe from the Cane han^not nets, but litters like little beds, upon which a Man fits with his legs ftretchM forth, or half lying along upon cushions, andfo is carr^'d Very conveniently. Moreover, the Palaxchini and the Andor, differ from one another 5 for that in the latter the Cane upon which they carry is ftrai't^ as it is likewife in the 3 Nets 5 but in the Valanchini^ for greater eafe of the perfon carry'd that he may have more room to carry his head upright, the faid Cane is crooked upward in this form h 5 and they bend Canes for thispurpofe when they are fmall and tender, and thefe are the moft convenient and honourable carriages^ and becaufe there are not found many goodCahfcs and fit to bear fuch a weight, there fore they are fold dear, ata hundred or fix fcore Tardini a piece which amount to about fixty of our Crowfls. Befides, as well the Talanchini as the Andor, and the Nets, are corer'd for avoid ing the Rain with dry Coverlets made of Palm leaves, to wit thofe of the Indian Nut, and other fuch Trees, fufficiently hand- fome 5 Which being caft over the Cane, hang down on each fide having two windows with little fhutters 5 They keep out the water very well, and the Coverlets may be taken off when one is minded to go uncover d, and carry'd by a fervant. Yet I riever faw any go uncovered in Goa^ either in or Nets; but out of the City in the Country, many. I have fpoken more atInto the EAST-INDIES. at length©fthefe Carriages, becaufe they are unknown in our Countries, although I remember to have feen in Italy the Effigies of a Net or B~ete , engraven in certain Maps of the World, and, if I mi flake not, amongft the ways of travelling in Brafil, : where I believe they are usM i and indeed this mode of Carriage is very II fual io India, notoncly in Cities, but alfo in journeys and thofe offufficient length , wherefore to make experience of it, I was minded to have my feif carry'd this day after the manner which .

This day we departed not, becaufe one of the Frigats of the Armado which was to accompa ny us, was unprovided with Sea-men, for which we wefe fain to ftay till the day following, and then were not very well provided. Thecaufe whereof was, for that there was at this time a great fearcity of Mariners in Goa, becaufe the Govern- ours of the maritime parts of the Continent fubjedt to Idal-Sciah^ would not permit their Ships to come, as they were wont,to lup- f\y Mariners fat the Portugal Armado 5 which feem'd an argu mentI he trawls of Rcter D elia Valle, meat of fome ill will of that Ring againft the Portngals,o{wh\ch, were there nothing elfe5theirs beir^g weaker, and more conrus d m their Government then evt r, and all things in bad order, was a fufticient gtound ^for remedy of which^they took no other courle, but daily loaded thtmltlves with new, unulua],and molt heavy Impofitions, to the manifeft ruine of the State, taking no care to prevent the hourly exorbitant defraudations of the pubhck Incomes, which otherwife would be fufficient to maintain the chaige without nt wGabels: but if fuch thefts continue, both the rublick Incomes and the new Gabels^and as many as they can invent, will be all fwallow'd up.

Not being to depart this day, we went to dine and pals the time, with intention alio to lodg the following night in the houfe of Sig: Baldaffar d Azevedo^ who liv'd conftantly in a fair Houfe there by the Sea-lide, a little ^iftant from the Vil/uy or Fort, where the yice-Roys lodg in Tatigu Whilftwewere recreating our felves, Sig: be thinking himfelfof what, perhaps, he had not thought of before, alk 'd me whether I had the Vice-Roy s Licence to go with him this Voyage 5 and I telling him th^t I had not, becaule I did not think it needful, he reply'd, that it was needful to be had by any means if I intended to go ^ otherwife, he could not venture to carry me, for tear of giving malevolous perfbns occafion to criminate him, by fayingjthat he had carry'd me a ftranger, and without the Vice-Roy's Licence, into fufpefted places, where matters of State were to be handled ^ in brief, knowing the matter blameable, and the wonted Cavils of many of his own Nation, and being admonilh'd by many and great troubles be fallen others, and particularly, a Kinfman of his very innocent ly for very flight caufes, and much inferior to this ^ hetQld me refolutely , that without the Vice-Roy's Licence it wasnowife good, either forhimor me,thatlihouldgo. Wherefore being we were not to depart that day, he advis'd me to return to the City, and procured the faid Licence, if I intended to go, and he would ftay for me till the next Morning} but without the Licence I muft not return to take Ship, nor would he by any means venture to carry me. I, who well underftood the pro cedures of the Portugals, and what rigor they ufe in their Go vernment, and to what fufpitions and malevolences they are prone, which caufe a thoufand ill ufages and injuftices, was fcnlible that Sig: Fernandez had reafon, and that the not having gotten this Licence was an inadvertency, becaufe I accounted iti flot neceflary&gt; but to obtain it of theVice-Roy^ who knewInto the EAST-INDIES. me well and had ftiewn himfelf courteous to me, I look'd upon as not difficult. Wherefore being loath to lofe my intended Voyage, as foon as I had din'd with thefe Gentlemen, I went by boat to the City, and having firft given account of my bufi- nefs to Sis: Antonio, and Sig: Ruy his Brother, (to whole Houfe I repair'dj having left that which I had hir and remov d my goods tothatof thefaid Sig' Barocci) I went wjth thefame S\v:RuyGome'Z&gt; to fpeak to V.Marejao ajefrnt, andtheVicc- Rov's Confeflor and my Friend, whomldefird (asthe fitteft perfontodoit, inthelfiort time left me) to get me a Licence from the Vice-Roy. He went immediately to fpeak to the Vice -Roy about it, and had the fortune to find him before he entcr'd into a Congregation or Council which was to fit till nieht; and the Vice-Roy prefently writ a Licence for him with his own hand, direded to the Ambaflador Gio: Fernandez wherein he told him, that whereas I defir'd to go along with him he might carry me, and (hew me all kind 01 Civility and Honour as a deferving perfon, with other like courteous and high expreffions. Having gotten my Licence , I went^ with F. Rvy Gomez Baraccio, to vifit the Biihop of Cocni, who in the vacancy of the See adminiftred the Arch-biftioprick of and whom I had not yet viftted ^ and underfhnding that he was de- firous to know me , and was a Prelate of great merit, notonely as to Eccleliaftick matters, but alfo in point of Government and Warr (for he took divers ftrong places 0 and perform d other exploits in India for the fervice of his King ^ with great valour) I would not depart without firft vifiting him, and making my felf known to him. This Prelate is call'd Fra Don SebaJUano di San Pietro, and is an Jugvfiine Fryer. We difcours'd above an hour toeether concerning things of India , Perp, and other matters 0 and I recommended to him with the F. Conielior the Angufiine Fathers of his Religion in Terfia, giving him an account of their neceflitics, and how he might help them. . ^ Night being come, I went to make a Collation in the Home of Sig,' Harocci , and when it was grown dark , I return d to imbark in the Ship which expefted me, and went to the Town of Pan pi to find Sig; Gio: Fernandez and my other Companions, who were very glad at my return with the Vice-Roy's Licence, fo favourable and courteous to me, becaufe they were loath to have gone without me 5 and fo I flept with them that night in the fame Houfe. My charge, Maria m Ttnattn, went not with me this journey becaufe it was not expedient, being I was to return to Goa, but ftay'd ftill in the Houfe of Sig' Lena daCugna^ onely Cacciatur went with me to ferve me. October xhe hiteenth s A little befofe night we were ready to fet fail, had not we been neceftitated to ftay for certain Mariners till the next Morning, when we went to hear Mafs in a Church of Saint Agnes belonging to the Auguftine Fryers, and ftanding in the Ifland otGoa 5 a ter which, being imbark'd, we ftay d a^vhile longer waiting IV, ■ ;• Jsi 1lii if ; | AocA*/fa V. /A fl (yr^y \m $&amp; 0m The Travels of Peter Delia Valle, Brachman Ambiflador, for whatreafon \ know not, unlefs, pcr- haps 5 he was minded to make us ftay tor him,, as we had made him ftay for us. At length being got out of the mouth of the River, we continu'd failing all night, but with afmallwind. Our courfe was always Southward almoft direftly, and we coafted along the land at a little diftance. Ottoher the fixteenth, Ja the Morning we difcern d four Ships otMalabar Rovers, near the ftiore (they call them Faroes^ and they go with Oars, like Galeots or Foifts) we gave them chafe for above an hour, in tending to fight them, but we could nqt overtake them 5 onely we loft much time and much of our way. Night came upon us near certain Rocks, or uninhabited little lilands, whkh they call Angtdiva, which fignifies, in the Language of the Country, Five Jjlands^ they being fo many in number^ We found frefh water in one of them, they are all green and have fome Trees. We fet fail from thence the fame nighty but had little or no wind and violent rain. Offober the feVenteenth , Continuing our courfe the next day with a very fmall gale, we faw the bound of the States of Adil-Sciah and Vent^tafa Naie^a, which is onely a brackifti River, fuch as are frequent upon the Coaft of India, The wind was but fmall ftill, ib that all this day we could not arrive at Onor ^ but when it was night, becaufe 'tis no good cntring into the Port of Onor in the dark and with ebbing water, as it was now, we caft Anchor, and remain'd all night under an uninhabited fmall Rock, which they call the Rock of Omr, After mid-midnight the Tide began to flow, but yet we ftirr'd not. Offober the eighteenth, About break of day we mov'd along , and by the help of Oars finifli'd the remainderof the way, arriving at in good time. This whole Voyage from Goa to is not above eighteen Leagues, but it took us up lb much time, becaufe we had onely a very fmall wind. Onoris a fmall place by the Sea-fide , but a good Port of in different capacity, which is form'd by two arms of Rivers, which ( I know not whether both from one or feveral headsj) running one Southward, and the other Northward, meet at the Fortrefs, and are difcharg'd with one mouth into the Sea. The habitati ons are rather Cottages then Houfes, built under a thick'Gfove of Palms, to wit, thofe which produce the Indian Nuts, call'd by the Portugals, Coco 5 and by the Arabians^ Narghil. But the Fortrefs is of a competent circuit 5 though the walls are not very well defign d,- being juft as the Portugals found them made by the people of the Country. It ftands upon a high Hill of free ftone, and being very capacious, not onely the Captain lives there, but mod of the married and principal Portugals have Houfes in it, very well accommodated with Wells, Gardefls, and other conveniencies. The ftreets within the Fortrefs are lar^land fair, befides a great Piazza fufficient to contain all the people of the place in time of a fiege. There are likewife two Churches, one dedicated to Saint Catherine the other to Saint Anthony 5 butunlefs, Into the EAST-INDIES, but ordinarily there is but one Prieft in Onor, who is the Vicar of the Arch -Bi(bop of Goa^ and therefore in other religi« ous perfons alwaysgo thither. Out of the Fort, in the Country, is the Bazar or Market, bat a fmall one and of little conhderati- on 5 nothing being found therein but what is barely necedary for fuftenance of the inhabitants. Our Ambaffador Sig: Gio: Fer nandez lodg'd with us 5 not in the Fort, but without in the Houfe of a private man ^ and, I believe, it was becaufe he had rigor ous Orders from the Vice-Roy againft the Captain 5 and Com- miflion to redrefs many Diforders which he had committed in his Government, elpecially to compofe matters between him and the people of the Country^ as alfo between him and the Vicar betwixt whom there were great Diforders, the fault of which was charg'd upon the Captain. When Vfewerefetledin our Houfe, fir ft the Vicar c^W'dF .Henrico Rabete^nd afterwards the Captain call'd Sig r Don dfyrijioforo Fernandez Francifco, with almoft all the principal perfons of the place 3 vifited Sig: Gio: Fer- nandez, who prefently beginning to treat of bufinefs , and pre- fenting'to the Captain the Vice-Roys Letters and Orders, the Captain being terrifi'd therewith on the one fide 3 and on the other, oblig'd by the civil terms of Sig: Fernandez, forthwith offer'd himfelf ready to give the Vice-Roy fatisfaftion in what ever he commaded,and began immediately to put the fame offer ineffeft} relpafing one-whom he held Prifoner, and performing- other things Which Sig: Fernandez appointed him. otioberthe nineteenth, Vhe Captain inviting the Ambaflador and all the company to^dine in the Fort,we went firft to vifit him, and after wards to hear Mafs in Saint Catharines Church, which is the Vicar's See 5 which being over, the Ambaffador vifited a Gentle woman who was a Kinfwoman of the Vicar s, and then retir ci in private with the Captain, not without maniteft fignes that his re -pacification was rather upon neceffity then out of good-will. Caufa Mali tanti, fce/nina fola fnit. 1 he original of moft of the Diforders between the Captain and the Vicar , they fay, was occafion d by the Captain's Wife, who had banifh'd out of Oner a fervant of his whom he had employ d as his Inftrument to other Women,and who had been formerly punifh'd for the fame fault. In the mean time we walk'd up and down, but faw nothing worth mentioning 5 and at at dinner-time we went to the Cap tain's Houfe where we all din d, namely, Sig: Gio: Fernandez the Ambaffador, the Chief Commander of the Fleet, call'd Heftor Fernandez, F.

The Entertainment wasfumptuous and very well ferv'd , dinner ended, we return'd to our Houfe. OBober the twentieth. In the Evening the Chaplain and I went in a Palanckino a mile out of Onor to fee a fine running wa ter, which ifluing out of the Earth in a low, or rather hollow place, as it were the bottom of a Gulph, falls into a Tank?, or r O 2 Cittern'.Ay •'w&amp;sk ■ C^S .. -vat'-'h- % :0m m ^ j^tess »* &gt; ms&amp;m'* VII Ciftern built round with ftone ^ and this being fill'd, it runs out with a ftream watering the neigbouring-fields.

The Ciftern is fquare, every fide being five or fix yards, and the water would reach to a man's neck 3 but by reafon of the ruinoufnefi of the walls in fome places, it is not very clean. Within it are fmall fifties, which ufe to bite fuch as come to fwim there, yet wixh- out doing hurt, becaufe they are fmall 5 and the place being low, is confequently, (hady, and lb affords a plealant ftation at all times.

We ftript our Selves, and fpent a good while in fwimming here. The fields about (Mor through which we pafs'd were very pleafant Hills and Valleyes, all green, partly with very high herbage, partly \vith wood, and partly with Corn. C &amp;ober the one and twentieth, I took the Altitude of the Sun, and found it diftant from the Zenith 24. degrees 20. minutes, upon which day the Sun, according to my manufcripts, was in the 2 7 th degree of and declin'd from the ^quinodial to / ? , the South 10. degrees 24^ 56 // ,which deduced from 24. degrees ^c/, in which I found the Sun, there remain 13. degrees 55', 4 // 5 and precifely fo much is Oner diftant from the iEquinoftial towards the North. In the Evening the Ambaflador VitHU Stnay^ who was lodg'd beyond the River more South of Onor^ came to the City to vifit the Captain in the Fort. The Captain with all the Citizens, and S\g: Cio: Fernandez^ with us of his Company, went to meet and receive him at the place where he landed 5 three pieces of Ordnance being difcharg'd whei^ he en- tred into the Fort. Ottober the four and twentieth, was the Da- vhli, or Feaftof the Indian-Gentiles, and, I believe, was the fame that I had feen the laft year celebrated in Bender di Combrit in ?erfia : The fame day, if I miftake not in my reckoning, the Moors began their new year 1033. In the Evening, I werft to fee another great Town of Gentiles, feparate from that ftands upon the Sea near Onor,^ and they call it the Villa de Brahmani, be- caulemoftof the inhabitants are Brachmans, whereas they that live by the Sea-fide are Fiftiermen, and of other like profeffion. This Town of the Brachmans ftands about a Canons-ftiot within land , remote from the Fortrefs of Onor towards Hordete or Greco, The inhabitants keep Cows or BufFalls, and live upon other Trades. In the entrance of the City is built for publick ufe a handfome fquare Ciftern, or Receptacle for Water, each fide of which contain'd about a hundred of my paces in length, 'tis fiird with rain water,which lafts for the whole year.

We ftay 'd all this while at O/r^r, becaufeas (bon as we arriv'd there , Vitula Sway writ to FenJ^tapa Naieka his Mafter 5 giving him an account of our arrival; and fo it was neceflary to ftay for his Anfwer and Orders from the Court: alfo waited for men to carry us upon the way, ('the whole jour ney being to be made in Litters or PaUnchinoes} together with our Goods and Baggage, which were likewife to be earry'd by men upon their (boulders. And the Davkli^ orFeaft of the Gentiles) falling 6ut in the mean titpe, we were fain to ftay till it waspafs 'd &gt; and I know not whether the Qjjeens Death and Fu nerals may not caufe us to ^ay ibme time longer. I will not fup- prels one ftory which is reported of this Lady. They (ay, thar twelve or thirteen years fince, when ftie was about five anct thirty years old, it came to her ears that Venfaapa Naie^d her Hulband, being become fond of a Mootifti Woman, kept her fe- cretly in a Fort not farr from the Court, where he frequently fo- lac'd himfelf with her for two or three dayes together 5 where upon Badra-Amk , (firft complaining to him not onely of the wrong which he did thereby to her, but alfo more of that which 'he did tohimfelf, defiling himfelf with a ftrange Woman of im pure Race, (according to their fuperftition) and of a Nation which drank Wine, and eat Flefti, and all fort of uncleannefles in their account ) told him that if he had a mind to other Wo men, he need not have wanted Gentile-Women of their clean Race, without contaminating himfelf with this Moor, and (he ihould have fuffer'd it with patience 5 butfincehe had thus de- fil 'd himfelf with her, (he for the future would have no more to do with him $ and thereupon ihe took an Oath that (he would be to him as his Daughter, and he (hould be to her as her Fa ther : After which (he (hew 'd no further refentmenty but liv'd with him as formerly, keeping him company in the Palace, tend ing upon him in his ficknefs, and other things with the fame love as at firft, helping and advifing him in matters of Government^ wherein fhe had alwayes great authority with him &gt; and,in (hort^ excepting the Matrimonial Aft, perfeftly fulfilling all other Of fices of a good Wife. Venkctafa Naiefa who had much affedion for her, notwithftanding the wrong he did her with his Moor, endeavor'd by all means poffible to divert her from this her pur- pofe, andto perfwade her to live a Matrimonial Lifeftill with him, offering many times to compound for that Oath by the alms ot above 20000. Pagods, ( Pagod is a gold coin, near equivalent to a Venetian Zecchine, or Englifti Angel) but all in vain , and ihe perfever 'd conftant in this Refolution till death &gt; which being undoubtedly an aft of much Conftancy and Virtue^ was the caufe that Vwl^tapa Naiek* lov'd her always (b much the 0 more. atfthrI he Travels Peter Delia Valle, X)tfober the eight and twentieth 3 Vitulh simytentto tell our Ambaiiaclor 3 that having fent word of our arrival to the Court, the great Minifters had, acquainted Fenk-tapaflaiek? therewith, who being ftili fo affliSed for the death of his Wife, that he went not forth in publick, nor fuffer'd himfelf to befeen 5 when they t Id him of this matter^he ftood a while without anfwering, and at length faid onely, that they might come when they pleafe: Whereupon his Courtiers feeing him in this mood, would not reply further to him concerning provifionsof the journey to be fent to the AmbafTador, perfons to convey his Goods, and other fuch things ^ wherefore Vitula Sway faid,that Sig: Gio: Fernandez* might confiderwhat to do, whether to put himfelf upon the way towards the Court without further waiting, or to have him write againj and ftay for an Anfwer 5 for he would do which he pleasM. Sig: Gio: Fernandez* , as well for the credit of his Embaffie as to avoid charges, was Sefirous to have provifions for the journey. Men to carry his Goods, and other greater conveniences, although in publick, and with us of his company &gt; he did not teftifie fb much, being willing to have it thought that Vitnla Sinay did thh Office for him at the Court upon his own motion, and not at his requeft 5 yet, I know, that in fecret he us'd great inftance with ^2^, both by Writing and by Speech by the mediation of an Interpreter that he would write again to the Court, and fet forth to Venk^tapk how that he was the AmbafTador of fo great a King , the firft Monarch of Chriftians, (for fo I heard him tell the Interpreter, though he fpoke with a low voicej and that it was not feemly for him to go in that manner, but that people fhould be fent to him for ' his journey, and perfons to receive him, and commands given to Venk;tape's Minifters that he might pals through his Territo ries with that conveniency and decency which was requifite ^ that fince he was now within two or three days journey of the Court, , he would ftay another week atO/^ and longer if need were, till a better Anfwer came 5 and that, if he thought it expedient, Vitnla himfelf might go before to do this Office, as he that might do it beft, and who ought to arrive at the Court before him the Ambaflador, who afterwards might come thither alone by eafie journeys after he had fent him an Anfwer. The fame night the Interpreter return'd with this meflage to Vitula Sinay y who was lodg'd on the other fide of the River in his own King's jui ifdiction. October the nine and twentieth. After we had heard Mais in Saint Anionic's ^gypt, Sig: Gio: Fernandez, was minded to go in peribn to vifit PitHld sinay , and fpeak to him about the above-mentioned matter 5 wherefore entring with us into one of thole boats, which they call Mancive^ going with twenty or four and twenty Oars, onely differing from the Almadies^ in xhatxhtMancive have a large cover'd room in the poop , (ever'd from the banks of rowers, and are greater then the Almadies which have no fucb room 5 we pafs'd out of the Port, and thence fromInto the EAS T-INDIES. 103 from the mouth of the River Southward, went to land upon the continent;, where Vitnla, Sway having been advertis'd of our coming, expeded us under the (hade of certain little Hills and Trees, of which all this Country is full. This was the firft time , that I let foot in any place of the Gentiles, where they bear fway themfelves. SigiCio .-Fernandez (poke along while and alone with Fztula Sinay, both of them fitting upon a Carpet fpread upon the grafs 5 and at length, the difcourfe being ended, theAmbaflador took boat again and return'd to Onor. Upon the way he told us r that Vitulh Sin ay faid , that in either cafe, of his writing again, or going in perfon to the Court, and waiting for a new Anfwer, many dayes would be loft &gt; therefore it feem'd beft to him that we (hould all put our felveS upon the way without fur ther waiting 5 and that to carry his (the Ambaflador's) Goods, they had appointed ten Men according to his Ring's Order 5 wherefore Sig: Fernandez told us, he was refolv'd to go by all means, and feeing the ten men allow'd him to carry his Goods were not fufficient, they alone requiring twenty fivt, befides thofe of the reft of his company, he would hire the reft at his own charge, and rid himfelf of this perplexity* By this change of opinion after this inteirview, I underftod thatVitula sinay had fpoken in fuch fort that Sig: Fernandez perceiv'd that this cold- nefs offending him greater accommodations for his journey,was not fo much through the King s melancholy for his Wife's death, and the prefent confulion of the Court, as for fomc other caule § and the alledging lofs of time in waiting for a new Anfwer, was but an excufe of Vitulk 5 bur, in fine, the truth could be no other, then that they would not give him any greater Provifions, or becaufe Venk-tapa was not well pleas'd with this Embaffie, 8cc. And to confirm this, I know that before Sig: Fernandez depart ed,from Goa^ Venl^tapa Naieka writ thither to his Ambaflador VituVa Sinay^xhdiX. if they fent this Embaffie to urge the reftitution of the State and Fortrefs of which he had lately taken AJ^ 1 - from a certain fmall Indian-Prince, neighbour to Mangalor^ who /7 jiv'd under the Portugal's protedion, ( for whofe defence, two or / A ^ three years before, the Portugals had made warr With Venk:tapt Naieka 3 and receiv'd a notable defeat by him) it was in vain, and that Sig: Gio: Fernandez, (now firft known to him) might forbear to undertake this journey, for that he was fully refolv'd not to reftore it, nor yet to give feven thoufand Pagods yearly to that Prince, as he had promis'd upon agreement, if he went not to live out of thofe Territories taken from him either in Goa or in Magalor^ox elfewhere,he pretending at leaft a purpofe to re turn to live with that annuity in the lands,once his own, private ly, in hopes,perhaps, to raife fome new commotion one day. So ihatVenktapa Naieka, knowing that one of the principal bufinef- fes of this Embaflie was that of the Prince of Banghel, which little pleas'd him ? and feeing alfo that this year the Ships from Portu- / V gal were not yet arriv'd, which every year fetch Pepper out of/ he travels of Peter Dells V^llc, m \ nA ' ? : IX. 'A //S c ■ fc of his Dominions, and bring him in a great fumof mony, by agreement made by the Portuga/s, who every year were either to rake it or pay for it 5 and neither the Ships nor the money com ing this year, they could not eafilypayhim for the Pepper this vear 3 nor yet for a great part of that of the laft ; for which;, by r afon of the lofs of their Ships they ftili^ow'd him: And laftly, oDferving the Tortugals weakned and low 5 fo that they not onely ftood in need of him 5 but now, in fome fort, began tofub- mit themfelves to him with this Embaffie which they fent to him, and the dilgrace of their pafs'd defeat j 'twas no ftrange thing, that being become infolent thereupon, as'tis the manner of the Barbariafis^nd defigning to carry it high over them,he not only (hew'd no great liking of the Embaffie, but made little ac count of it ? and, in a manner, defpis'd it 5 that fo he might keep himfelf and his affairs in greater reputation. Ottober the thirtieth, Sig; Gio: Fernandez being refolv'd to de part the next day, fent fome Horfes before, upon this, with Tome of his Family. The fame Evening,one from Goa brought News of the arrival there of fome Vortugals of the Fleet which came this year from Portugal, confifting of four great trading Ships, two Shallops, and four Galeons of Warr 5 which laft come in order to be confign'd to Ruy Freira for the War of Ormicz^ thelofsof which place, and the deliverance of Ruy Freira out of prifon being already known at the Court of Spain , but not the lofs of the Ships of the Fleet the lafl: year. TheT^r/^/j arriv'd in Goa , according to the abovefaid intelligence , came in one of the Galeons of the Fleet which is coming, which being fepa- rated from the reft, toucht at Mozambique , and there being old and (hatter'd was loft, onely all the People and Goods were lav'd, and came in other Ships to Goa , and being the reft of the Fleet delayesfo long, 'tis conceiv'd to have held a courfe with out the Ifland of Saint Lorenzo, which ufes to take up more time. They relate alfo , that the Marriage between Sj)ai7t and England is concluded, and that the Prince of England is now in Spain, being comethirhcr before the conclufion of the Marri age which was (hortly expeded.It being already very late&gt;, I ftiall not longer deferr concluding this Letter, becaufe it is requifite for me to go and take a little reft, that I be may fit for my jour ney to morrow Morning, if it pleafeGod^ to whom I heartily commend you , and with my accuftomed affection kifs your Hands.

What I fhall now fet down, mine own Eyes have witnefs'd to 5 and I fhall not fear being too tedious in defcribing things, perhaps, over minutely in thefe Letters 5 fince I know you are delighted there with, and out of your great erudition can make refledions upon the Rites us'd in thele parts of the world, which in m^ny things are not unlike the ancient ^Egyptian Idolatry. Fori am per- fwaded to believe, not without the authority of ancient Authors^ that the worfhip of Ifis and Ofirk was common to Mgy^t and this Region, as in Philojiratus I find Apollonius affirming, that in In* dia he faw the Statues not onelyof the ^Egyptians, but alio of the Grecian gods, as of Apollo, Bacchus, and Minerva^ But to return to the particulars of my journey j O&amp;ober the one and thirtieth. After one a clock in the Afternoon, we departed from Onor with Sig: Gio: Fernandez in a Mancion or Barge, and the reft of the Family in a lefs Boat. Vitnla Sinay who was to go with us, we left in a readinefs to fet forth after us, I know not, whether by water or by Land. We row'd up the River which runs Southward to O»0r, againft theftream, making ufe both of Sail qjid Oars 5 and a little before night having gone about three Leagues,,we came to Garfopa and there lodg'd. This place was fometimes a famous City, Metropolis of the Province 7 ^ and Seat of a Queen : in which State, as likewife in many others upon the Coaft of tothiiday, a Woman frequently hath , the fovereignty 5 Daughters or other nearefl: Kinfwomen be- gotten by what ever Father fucceeding the Mothers 5 thefe Gen tries having an opinion, (as 'tis indeed ) that the IfTue by the /? &lt;&gt;/ Woman-fide is much more fure of the blood and lineage of the Anceftors, then that by the Man-fide. The laft Queen of Garjbpa fell in Love with a mean Man and a ftranger,' into whofe power Ihe refign d her felf, together with her whole Kingdom. In which aft, (fetting afide her choofing a Lover of bafe blood, upon which account fhe was blam'd and hated by the Indians P whoThe Travels of Peter Delia Vall e, 4 who are moft rigorous obfervers of Nobilityj and maintainers of the dignity of their anceftors in all points) as to giving her felf up as a prey to her love^ (he committed no fault againft her honori for in thele Countries 'tis lawful for fuch Queens tochoofeto themfelves Lovers or Hufbands., one or more, according as they pleafe. ^ But this Man who was fo favoured by the Queen of Carfopa, having thoughts as ignoble as his blood 5 in ftead of correlponding with gratitude to the Queens courtefie, defign'd to rebell againft her, and take the Kingdom from her 5 which for a while he executed, having in procefs of time gain'd the affe&amp;ion of moft of her moft eminent Vaffals. The Queen feeing her felfopprefs'd by the Traytor, had recourfe to the Portugal^ offering them her whole State 3 on condition they would free her from imminent ruine.Butthe Pw/#g&lt;i/x 3 according as they had alwayes in India done by their friends, (whereby they have been many times the mine of others and themfelves too) did not fuc- cour her till it was too late, and then very coldly. On the other fide the Traytor 3 ( as his ill Fate, or rather God's juft anger, would have it) call'd to his afliftance againft the Queen and the Portugahy his Neighbour Fenk^tapi Naieka, nowMafterof thofe Countries. Venkctafa, Naivka taking advantage of theoccafion, enter'd fuddenly into the Kingdom of Carfopa with great dili gence and force, fo that fhortly becoming Mafter of the whole Country and the City RoyaI ,having driven out the Tortugals who came to defend it, he took the Queen Prifoner, and carry'd her to his own Courts where being kept, although honourably, ihe ended her dayes afterwards in an honourable prifon. But the Tray tor under-went the punifhment of his crime, for Venkctafa, Naiek# caus'd him to be flain ^ and for more fecure keeping that State in his power, caus'd the City and R.oyal Palace ofG^r- to be deftroy'd, fo that at this day, that lately flourifhing City is become nothing but a Wood^Trees being already grown above the ruinesof theHoules, and the place fcarcely inhabited by four Cottages of Peafants. But returning to my Travel, I muft not omit, that the three Leagues of this journey was one of the moft delightful ^paflages that ever I made in my life ^ for the Country on either fide is very beautiful, not confifting of Plains that afford onely an ordi nary profpeQ:,nor oftowring mountains^but of an unequal furface, Hills and Valleys, all green and delightful to the eyes, cloth'd with thick and high Oroves, and many times with fruit Trees, as Indian Nuts, Fonfel^ Ambe, and fuch like, allwater'd with innumerable Rivolets and Springs of frefh water 5 the fides of the River all fhady, befet with Flowers, Herbs, and fundry Plants, which like Ivy creeping about the Trees and Indian reeds ofexcefiive height, ( caird by the Country-people and ^very thick along the banks) make the wood more verdant^ through the middle whereof the River ftrayes with fundry wind ings.

Our boats being large, could not so to the ordinary landing place at Gar fop a &gt; becaufe the River which is difcharg'd into the Sea with one ftreanij is th ic divided into many 5 which fall from feveral Springs upon fome neigh bouring Hills, fo that the water is but little. Wherefore we landed at fome diftance from Garfopa.which ftands on the South- bank of the River, and walkt the reft of the way on toot, and our coods were carry'd upon the Men sfhoulQers, whom wc had hir dfor that purpofe. Before wegottooui lodging 3 it was night 3 and we were fain to wade over one of the arms of the River which took me up to the middle of the thigh 31 le ottom ^ \ V was ftony, and not fo dangerous to us, C who were free ) in re ference to falling, as to the poor men who carry d burthens , upon their heads ^ fo that I wonder d not he who carry d the hamper of my clothes tell down with it, and wetted it in the water. At length we lodg'd not within the compals of Garjopd^ which was lomewhat within land, but near it upon the River, in a place cover'd with a roofamongft certain iees,where many ^ are wont to lodge , and where the Pepper is weigh d and con- 7 traded for, when the Vortugcds come to fetch it: for this is the Country wherein greateft plenty of Pepper grovys 5 for which reafon the Queen of Garjepd was wont to be call d by the Tor- tugals^ Keyna da. rifnenta, thatis^ G)uecn of Pepper* I he Ri ver is cail'd by the Fortugals the River ot Garfopa^ but by the Indians in their own Language, one branch is term d, Amhnnidi^ and the other, Sark nidi. From the River 8 mouth, where it falls into the Sea, to Garfopa^ the way, if Imiftake notj is diredtly Eaft, • ; /1 • November the firft,After dinner we departed from our itation. III. and paffing by the Cottages, and the places where the City of Garjopa fometimes flood, we walkd a good way Southwards, or rather South South-weft, always through an uneven, woody Country, irrigated with water and delightful, like the banks ot the River which I defcrib d. Then we began to climb up a Mountain, which the Country-people call and divides the whole length of this part of India^ being wafh'd on the Eaft with the Gulph of Bengala, and on the Weft with the Ocean or Sea of Go a. The afcent of this Mountain is not very rough, but rather ealie andpleafant like the other foil, being thick fet with Groves of frees of exceflive greatnefs ^ fomeorthem foftrait, that one alone might ferve for the Maft of a Ship. With all, the Mountain is (b water'd with Rivulets and t ountains, and fo cloth'd with Grafs and Flowers, that, me-thought, I faw the moft delightful place of the Appennine in Italy, If there be any difference, the Gat of India hath the advantage in this place, be- caufe the height is much lefs then that of our Appennine , the alcent moreeafie, the wood more beautiful and thick, the wa ters not ^fs plentiful and clear 5 If Gat yields to it in any thing, P 2 'tis s/ Strt), The Travels of Peter Delia Vallc, n / d /y A-&lt; /{/' a Ai aun 1 &amp;/j,/ jC Vis in the frequency of inhabited places, the fumptuoufnefs of buildings ^ and laftly, in the beauty which the induftrious art of ' the inhabitants adds to the Affennine •■) the Indian Gat having noothei^ befides what liberal, yet unpolifti'd. Nature gives it. About three hours after noon we came to the top of where a little beneath the higheft cliff is found a kind ofbarr'd Gate, with a wall in a narrow pafs, which renders the place fufficiently llrong 5 a little further than which, in the top of all, are found earthen Bulwarks, and lines, which guard the paifage &gt; and in this place is a fufficient Fortrels, being a mile and half in circuit. It was fometimes call'd Garicota, but now Gavarada Naghar 5 we lodg'd about a Mufket-lhot without the Fort, in a plane and fomewhat low place, where are ibme Houfes like a Village, and amongft them a Temple of Hatnant, who is one of thofe two Scimions who were imploy'd by Ramo for recovering his Wife SitAfis their Fables relate ^ for which good work,and their other miracles, the Indians adore them. Here I (aw his Statue in the Temple with burning lights before it, and a conlecrated Silver Hand hung up by fome devout perfon, perhaps, cur'd of fome evil of his Hands. Below this place where we lodg'd, amongft the little Valleys of the Hill, is a fair and large Ciftern, or Receptacle of water, which falls thereinto from a River de- fcending from the Mountain, and the over-plus running into the lower Valleys. At night we heard Mufick at the Gate of the above-mention'd Temple, divers barbarous Inftruments (bund ing, and amongft the reft certain great Horns of metal, fafliion'd almoft into a femicircle; I afk'd the reafon of this Feftival, and they told me. The Idol was to go prefently, accompany'd with a great number of Men and Wotiien, in pilgrimage to a place of their devotion near SanTome, a moneths journey andmore^ and that it was to be carry*d in a Falanchino^ as the cuftom is, 'and in proceffion with fundry founds and fongs, almoft in the fame manner, as amongft us Chriftians, the Bodies or Images ot Saints arecarry'd in procellion when any Community or Fra ternity go in pilgrimage to Loreto, or Rome, in the Holy year. At this time aflifted at the fervice of the Idol, amongft otjiers, a Woman, who , they faid, was fo abftinent that (he did not fo much as eat Rice 5 they held her for a kind of Saint, upon a fame-that the Idol delighted to fleep with her, which thefe filly fouls accounted a great fpiritual favour 5 and haply, it may be true, that fome Incubus-Devil ha's to do with her, and de ceives her with falfe illufions, telling her that he is her God, of which kind of Women, there are many among the Moors. Di vers come to afk her about future things, and (he confulting, the Idol gives them their anfwer ^ one of thefe interrogations was made to her whilft we were prefent. Others came to offer t ruits and other edibles to the Idol, which one of the Priefts prefentedtoit, murmuring his Orifons 5 and taking half of the things offer'd, (which after prefentation to the Idol, remains to; earned Into the EAST-INDIES. to the fervants of the Temple), he reftores the other half to him that ofFer'd them 5 and were it but one Indian Nut, heiplitsit in two btforc the Idol 5 and gives half to him that brought its who takes the fame with reverence, and is afterwards to eat it with devotion as facred food, and tafted of by the Idol. In the Evening, by the Captain of the Fort (who was a Moor of Dacan^ and fometimes an Officer under one a Captairi otAdil-Scihh) in the Frontiers of Goa, but being taken Prifon- er in a War between Adil-Sciah and Venl^tapk Naieka, and after wards fet at liberty, remain'd in the fervice of Venf^tapk 5 and hath been about five and twenty years Governour of this For- trefs, and is calTd jWir-lta*) wasfenta Prefent of Sugar Canes and other refreftiments to eat, to Sig; Gio: Fernandez 5 whom al- fothe fame night Vitula Sinay^ who traveli'd with us*, but apart byhimfelf, cametovifit, and entertain'd with the fight of two young men, who fene'd very well a good while together, onely with Swords made of Indian Canesi On which occafion, I (hall not omit that amongft the Indians, 'tis the cuftom for every one to manage and make ufe onely of one fort of Arms, whereunto he accuftoms himfelf, and never ufes any other, even in time of War. So thatlbmeSouldiersfight onely with Swords, others with Sword and Buckler, others with Lances, others with Bows and Arrows, and others withMulkets? and fo every one with his own Arms, never changing the fame, but thereby becom* ing very expert and well pradis'd in that which he takes to. The way from Garfopa to Govarada Naghar was about five or fix mile^ and no more. November the fecond, £arly in the Morning VituU Sinay firft vifited Sig; Gio: Fernandez, and afterwards the Captain of the Fort, accompanied with a great number of hisSouldierswith feveral Arms, but moft had Pikes, Lances in the form of half Pikes, and Swords 5 onely two had Swords and Bucklers: one of them had a (hort and very broad Sword like a Cortelax, but the edge-part bowed inwards after a ftrange fafhioni Thofe twa with Swords and Bucklers came before the Captain, dancing and fkirmifhing after their manner, as if they fought together. The vifit was received in the Porch of the little Temple above men- tion'd , and lafted a good while. Vitula Sinay , whofpokc the Pwta(^/-Tongue well, ferv'd for interpreter between our Ambaflador and the Captain, and handfomely intimated to the Ambaflador, that when he returned back it was fit to give a Prefent to this Captain, and vifit him in the Fort 5 that the cu ftom was fo 5 and he had already done the like to the Ambaffa- dor; that fince he did it riot now, he had already made an ex- cufe for it, by telling him that the baggage was gone before, and that he did not go to vifit him, became he had no Prefent to carry him, but he would do it at his return. In the end of this vifit, Vitula Sinay caus'd a little Silver balket to be brought full of'&lt;■ li .111 rib m v.

After we had din'dp about noon or foon after, our AmbafTa- /dorwent away alone with his Chaplain, out of impatience to fray longer in that place; the reft of us remain'd, expeding the removing of all our baggage, which was very flow in departing, becaufe the Men who carry 'd the fame upon their heads, were not fufficicnt, and the burthens were too heavy 5 fo that it was needful to hire more, and increafe the number of Porters to thirty fix, befides mine , which I hir'd for ray {elf apart 5 and becaufe neither were thefe enough^ it was needful to lade two Oxen, who carry'd Goods for four other Men ^ and this took up much time, bccaufe neither the Men nor the beafts which were hir'd were ready, but were to be fought for here and there. In the meantime, while the burthens were getting in order, I entertain'd my felf in the Porch of the Temple, beholding little boys learning Arithmetick afteraftrange manner, which I will here relate. They were four, and having all taken the fame lefibn from the Matter , to get that fame by heart, and repeat likewife their former lelions and not forget them 5 one of them linging mufically with a certain continu'd tone, (which hath the torceof making deep imprtffion in the memory) recited partoi the leflbn j as, for example,One by it felf makes one 5 and whilft he wasthusfpeaking, he writ down the fame number, not with any kind of Pen, nor in Paper, but (not to fpend Paper irc vain) with his finger on the ground , the.pavement being for that pur- pofe ftrew'd all over with very fine fand 5 after the firft had writ what he lung, all the reft fung and writ down the fame thing together. Then the firft boy fung and writ down another pare ofthelefton, as;, for example. Two by it felf two make two 5 which all the reft repeated in the fame manner, and fo forward in order. When the pavement was full of figures^ they put them out with the hand, and if need were, ftrew'd it with new fand from a little heap which they had before them where-with to write further : And thus they did as long as the exercife conti nue 3 in which manner^ likewife they told me, they learnt to read and write without fpoiling Paper, Pens, or Ink, which certainly is a prety way. I afk/d them, if they happen'd to fop getInto the EAST -INDIES. n i VJ. set or be miftaken in any part of the leflbn, who correfted and taught them, they being all Scholars without the affiftance ot anyMafteri they anfwer'd me, and faid true, that it was not poffible for all four of them to forget or miftake in the fame part, and that they thus exereis'd together, to the end, that if one happen'd to be out, the others might correct him. Indeed a prety, eafie, and fecure way of learning. Having feen this Curiofity, and our baggage being laden, we all fet forth after the Ambaflador, and Vituli simy fee out to gether with us. We travell'd firft Eaft-ward, then South-ward, but many times I could not obferve which way our courfe tend ed • we went upon the ridge of a Hill, and through uneven waves, fometimes afcending, and fometimes defcending, but always in the middle of great thick Groves full of Grafs and running water, no lefs delightful then the former Fields. A little more then half a League from the Fort, we found a of theMwrs, built upon the way with a Lake or Receptacle ot water,, but not very well contriv'd by the Captain of the laid Fort, which his King had allow'd him to make as a great favour i for the Gentiles are not wont to fuffer in their Countries Temples of other Religions. Here we found our Ambaffador, who ftay'd for us; and we tarry'd likewife here above an hour in expeftation of our baggage, much of which was ftill behind. At length continuing our journey, and having refted a good while in another place, nigh,t came upon us in the midft of a Wood, lo fliady, that although we had very clear Moon-light, yet we were fain to light Torches, othervyife we could not fee our way. The Torches us'd in India are not like ours 5 but made of metal in form of thofe wherewith the Infernal Furies are painted, the fire of which is fed with Bitumenj and other dry materials which are put into the mouth or hollow at the topj into which alio they frequently powre a combuftible liquor;, which the Man that holds the Torch carries in his other hand in a metalline bottle with a long (lender neck very fit for that purpofe ? for when he is minded to recruit the flame, he diftills a little liquor into ifr, the length of the neck fecuringhis hand from hurt. By the light of thefe Torches we travell'd a great part of the night. At length being unable to overtake the Horfes which were led before, and the baggage being behind, for fear of lofing our way, we ftay 'd under a great Tree, where fome in P a lane h woes ^ and others upon the ground, fpent this night inconveniently and fupper-lefs, having nothing elfe to eat but a little Bread, which we toafted at the lire, that we might eat it hot $ and with the fame fire which we kindled, we allay'd the coldnelsof the night, which in the top of thefe Indian Mountains is very cold m re- eard of their height 5 yet it was not (harper to us this night, then it ufes to be at Rome in the beginning of September, even in tem- ^NovemUrthe third. As foon as it was day we follow 'd our way y Ahe Travels of Peter Delia Valle, /- &lt;?/A way, and in a lliort time came to a Village of four Cottages c aird Tnmhrts where the Horfes were lodg'd, and we alfo ftay'd till the baggage came up 9 which was much later then we 5 and we ftayVi the longer to red - the people that traveled on foot : for all the fervants 3 and I know not how many Mufketiers, which our Ambailador carried with him, were on foot. Fitula Sinay lay there likewife this night, but was gone before we came thkher. F rom G art cot a to Tumbre^ is about a League and half 5 for in this Country they meafure the way by Gau's^ and every Gau ?s about two Leagues^ and theyfaid that from Garicota to Tumhre^ w r as not one Gau,_ When we arriv'd at this Town, we found the pavements of the Cottages were vernifh'd over with Cow-dung mix'd with water. A cuftom of the in the places where they are wont to eat, as I have formerly obferv'd* I took it for a fuper- IHtious Rite of Religion 5 but I fince better underftand that it is us'd onely for elegancy and ornament,, becaufe not ufing, or not knowing how to make fuch ftrong and lafting pavements as ours, theirs being made fleightly of Earth and lb cafily fpoyl'd, therefore when they are minded to have them plain, fmooth, and firm., they fmear the fame over with Cow-dung temper'd with water, in cafe it be not liquid, ('for if it be, there needs no water) and plaining it either with their hands or fome other infrrument, and fo make it fmooth, bright, ftrong, and of a fine green colour, the Cows whofe dung they ufc, never eating any thing but Grafs 5 and it hath one convenience, that this pohihing is prefently made, foon dry, endures walking, or any thing elle to be done upon it 5 and the Houfes wherein we lodg'd, we found were preparing thus at our coming, and were prefently dry enough for our ufeXlndecd it is a prety Curiofity - and I intend to caufe tryal to be made of it in Italy^r\d the rather becaufe they % for certain, that the HouCcs whofe pavements are thusftercorated, are good againft the Plague 5 which is no deipicable advantage. Onely it hath this evil, that its handfom- nels and politenefs lafleth not, but requires frequent renovation, and he that would have it handfome, muft renew it everv eight or ten days 5 yet being a thing fo eafie to be done, and of lo littla cnarge, it mattus not tor a little trouble which every poor per- fon knows hows to difpatch. The Portugals ufe it in their Houfes at Goa^ and other places of India h and, in brief, 'tis certain that it is no fuperftitious cuftom, but onely for neatnefsand or nament 5 and therefore ^is no wonder that the Gentiles ufe it otten, and perhaps, every day in places where they eat, which iTZf R 'f t( ? be .

On the Southern bank, on which we came, were four Cottages, where we took up our ftation that Nighty enjoying the cool, the ftiadow, and the fight of a very goodly Wood which cloaths the River fides with green 5 but above all where we lodg'd, on either fide the way, were liich large and goodly Xrees, fuch fpacious places underneath for fhade, and the place fo opacous by the thicknefi of the boughs on high, that indeed, T never faw in my dayes a fairer natural Grove , amongft other Trees there was abundance , , of Bamhu, or very large Indian Canes, twin'd about to the top 1 ty/wswu . with prety Herbs. The journey of this day was three Cos, or a League and half. This River, they fay, is one of thofe which goes to Garfofa. Vitulk Sin ay we found not here , becaufe he was gone before. November the fourth. We began in the Morning to pais our , Goods^over the River 5 but becaufe there was but one, and that a fmalf boat, it was ten hours after noon before we had got all of them over 5 then following our journey through fomewhat oblique and uneven wayes like the former,we found many Trees oiMyrohalanes, fuch as are brought into Italy preferv'd in Sugar* It hath leaves much like that which produces Gum Arabick, by me formerly defcrib'd 5 different onely in this, that in that of Gum Arabick, the branch confiftingof many leaves, is much lefs, round or oval, and feems one leaf made up of many other long and narrow ones: But in this Myrobalane Tree, the branch is fufficiently long, and the fmall leaves compofing it in two rows on either fide, are fomewhat larger 5 nor is the Myrobalane Tree prickly like that ofGum Arabick.

Having refted many times upon the way, and in alltraveird two Leagues., we ended this day s journey in the onely confide- rable and populous Town we had hitherto met 5 whicfi is call'd Ahinelt. . We lodg'd in the Porches of a Temple of Idols, which hadi two Porches, one within, the other without, both low after their manner^ with very large Pent-houfes ftrengthen- ed with great Pofts 5 the Pavement rais'd high and dunga, but not lately 3 the walls white, (prinkled in the corners and ends, with a fort of Rofe-Oyle, ill colour'd 5 for lb w their cuftom always in their Religious Struftures. The Idol was call'd VirenX Deuru, the latter of which words (ignifies God, or rather Lord, being attributed alfo to Men of quality ^ he ftoodatthe upper end in a dark place with Candles before him 5 of what figure he was I could not fee well, by reafon of the darknefs, but they told me 'twas a Man; In the body of the Temple, were many other wooden Statues of Ids Idols, plac d about in feveral places, as 'twere for ornament 5 fome of which were figures of their Gods, others not of Gods, but for ornament, of feveral ftiapes. Many of thefe figures reprefented diftioneft anions. One was of a Woman, lifting up her cloths before, and (hewing that which Modefty oblig'd her to cover .* Another was of a Man and a Woman kifting, the Man holding his Hand on the Womans Breads : Another had a Man and a Woman naked, with their Hands at one another's (hameful parts, thofe of the Man being ofexceffivegreatneft, and fundry fiich reprefentations fit indeed ^for fuch a Temple. But thefe were not figures of Gods, Of ^ Gods there was Brahmh with five Heads, and three Arms on a fide, fitting aftride a Peacock, which in their Language they call Wan Brahmk, that is, the Veacock^ of Brahmb 3 another God wascall'd Naraim, with four Arms on a fide: Another with an Elephants Head, and two Hands to an Arm, whom they call Gmesu^ and others that is. Round-mouth tfcx ont and the fame God hath divers names : Another calFd fuenh^ had the (hape of a Man, holding a naked Sword in his right Hand, and a Buckler in his left: Another had a Man under hk t 4 eet, upon whofe Head he trampled ^ and (b, many others of various forts. I obferv d that all thefe Idols had the fame cover of the Head, high, with many picks or peaks, all ending in one long peak, a ftrange and majeftical Diadem not us'd now in India 5 it might have been of wreath'd Linnen, or Gold, or other lolid matter 5 wherefore I imagine that it is a very ancient co- veringp at this day dif-us'd^ unle(s haply it be (bme entlgn of Divinity, which I rather think, becaufe I remember to have feen at almoft the fame Diadems upon the Heads of fome E gyptian Statues, and, if I forget not, they were call'd TutHli, andInto the E A S T-IND I E S. 11!

In the middle of the Temple was another darker inclofure, wherein ftood faftned in the ground certain flerider ftaves, with others crofs them in two rowsj making a little Steccato or Pajifado of a long form 3 and thefe were to hang Lamps and Tapers upon, at more folemn daycs and hours. A Barber whom we had with us, an Indian- GenUle^ but a Native of the Country of Adil-Scihh, who was /-s — J J nam'd Deugi^ and underftood fomething of the P^/zg^Z-Tongue, /O ■ could not well tell me the names of thofe figures and Idols of the ' Temple, when I afk'd him, becaufe, he faid, they were not^^ things of his Country, where they had .other things and Gods, and that every Country had particular ones of their own. With- in the circuit of this T emple, but on one fide of the Court as you go in, were three other little Cells feparate from the body of the great Temple, two of which were empty, perhaps not yet well accommodated, but in the other was an Idol of an Ox 5 which our Barber knew, and faid was alfo of his Country, and ^ thatthey call it 5 it was half lying, or rather fitting upon ' the floor' with the Head ered 5 like which Ox, or Bafoana^ ^ flood another in the upper part of the Temple before the Tri bunal of the Idol as if it ftood there for his guard. In ^ the Evening theMiniftersof the Temple ring a kind of Bell or y Shell which was within the Temple, ftriking it with a ftafF^ and ^ ' it made a tolerable found , as if it had been a good Bell: at which found, fome from without aflembling together, they be gin to found within the Temple very loud two Drums, and two Pipes or Flutes of metal 5 after which many Tapers being light ed, particularly, at the Steccato above-mention'd, and putin order a little quilt, with a Canopy of rich StufF,which is alwayes ready in the Temple for carrying the Idol, they put the princi- paHdol Virena into it, not that of ordinary wood in the middle, of the Temple, but the other at the upper end, which was of the (June bignefs, about two fpans round between the figure and ornaments about it, but all painted with various colours, gilded and deck'd with white Flowers. Then one. of the Minifters march'd firft founding a Bell continually as he went, and after him others, and at length two with lighted Tapers, after which followed the Idol in his Canopy , with a Minifter before him carrying a Veflel of Perfumes, which he burnt 5 and thus they- carry'd him in Proceffion: Firft, into the Court without the Temple, going out of it on the left Hand, as you enter, which to them as they came forth was the right, and returning by the other oppofite. After which going out of the Gate of the Court into the ftreet, they went in the fame manner in Proceffion, Cftill founding their Bells) I know not whither, but'tis likely they went to fome other Temple to perform fome kind of Ce remony j for in the Town there was more then one. Being at 2 / ^ if i hi,i i6 The Travels of Peter Delia Valle, v ; w length return'd, and the Proceflron re-entring the Court with a great train of Men and Women of the Town, they went thrice r^bout the infide of the Court^as they had done once before they went our: But in thefe three Circumgyrations they obferv'd this Order., that the firft time they walk'd as they had done in thefheet^ the fecondj more leifurely, and thofe that (bunded the Flutes, left off, and founded another kind of (hriller and fweeter Pipe 5 the third time;, they walk'd more (lowly then be fore,, and leaving off the fecond Pipes, founded others of a far lower note. Which being done, thofe that carry'd and accom- pany'd the Canopy of the Idol, flood ftillin the entrance of the Temple right againft the Upper End, and one of thePriefts or Minifters Ttanding at the Upper End direftly oppofite to the Idol, (who was held (landing on his Feet by help of one of the Minifter's Hands, who for that purpofe went alwayes on one (ide near him began to (alute the Idol a far off with a dim Taper in his Hand, making a great circle with the fame from on high downwards, and from below upwards, diredlly overagainft the Idol, which he repeated feveral times s and in the end of the circles, which were always terminated in the lower part, he de- fcrib d a ftrait line from one fide to the oppofite, and that where the circle began 5 nor did he feem to me always to begin the cir cles on the fame part, but fometimes on the right, and fome- times on the left, with what Order I know not. This being done within, the fame Prieft came to the Entrance where the Idol ftood , paffing dire&amp;ly through the midft of the Palifado of L ] ghts, (through which, I believe, that for others, and another time, it is not lawful to pafs 5 becaufe out of thefe Ceremonies w hen any one enter'd to perform other Services, I faw him al ways go without the Palifado on the fides) coming along, Ifav lounding a Bell, and being followed by a Boy who carry'd a Bafin or water with Santalus , ox Senders after him, (the fame where- with, I conceive, they are wont to paint their fore-heads) and alio with Drums and Flutes founding all rhe u* ufuallyr ; ' Into the EAST-INDIES. ufually (lands. In the mean time one of the Minifters diftri- buted to all the by-ftanders a little quantity of certain Fitches mingled with fmall dices of Indian Nut, which, I conceive, had been offer'd to the Idol 5 and they took and eat the fame with fignes of Devotion and Reverence. He offer'd fome likewife to our people, and there wanted not fuch as took them $ the Drums and Fifes (bunding in the mean time : which at length eeafing, and the Candles being put out, the Ceremonies ended, and the people return'd to their Houfes. Such Men as were not Officers of the Temple, affifted at thefib Ceremonies in the fir ft entrance, where we alfo ftood : but the Women ftood more within in the body of the Temple,where the rows of lights were.

November the fifth, At day-break the Minifters of the Temple where welodg'd* founded Pipes and Drums for a good while in the Temple, without other Ceremony* The like they did again about Noon, and at Evening 5 but at nigfit they made the lame Proceflion with the Idol, and the fame Ceremonies which are above defcribM* This day came to the Town a Captain from the King with many attendants, and having viGted the Ambaffador, took divers of thofe Idols which ftood in the firft Entrance, and carry'd them away with him to benewmade, becaufe fome were old and broken.

Before we had din'dj and whilft we were at Table 6 they came to call us in hafte to Audience, faying, that Fitnd Sinay and other great Perfonswere come toconduft usto the King. The Ambafiador finding himfelf unready and furpris'd was fore'd to defire them not to come yet, making an excufe that we were ftill at dinner , and,^ Table being taken away he and all the reft retir'd to drefs themfelves in great confufion- and greater there was in getting the Horfes fadled, preparing the Prefents which were to be carry'd, and providing othernccef- fary things in hafte, for nothing was ready 5 but the Ambafiador and all his Servants were in a great hurry and confufion, calling for this and the other thing, which feem'd to me not to have too much of the Courtier. The perfons who came to fetch us fray d a good while without, but at length were brought into t^ie Porch of the Houfe, that is, into the firft Entrance within the Court, where Vifits are received 5 without feeing theAm- bailador or any of his Attendants, who were all employ'd in the above-faid confufion, at a good part of which thefe perfons were prefent. , ^1 At length the^ AmbafTador being drelsM came forth with the relr, and receiv d the V'ifit of Vitnla, sinay ^ and another great Perlon lent by the King to accompany him, he was a Moor\&gt;v beer, but of Indian Pvace, very black, and Captain General in theie parts of Banghel, from which charge he was lately return'd and his Name vyas Muse Bat.

There was alfo another good led-Horle which the Vice-Roy fent as a Prefent to Venk-tapa Nauka; that which thev had given to VH h I a Sinay ^ he had carry d to his Houfe and it appear'd not here. All the reft of us rode upon Horfes' of the place, which are of a very fmall fize, and were fent to us for that purpofe, accoutr'd after their manner, with faddles wrtty enough to look upon, but to me very inconvenient, for thev have bows and cruppers very high, and are all of hard , wood, without any fluffing, but with (harp wreathdedges cover'd with black or red Cloth, lay d with lifts of Gold or yellow, or other colour; in the cruppers are many carvdorn- Lnts almoft of this figure (—^D^fides certain extravagant taficls hanging down to the ftirrops; and, were they not lo hard, they would be neither unhandfome, nor unfafe to ride upon. The Pomp proceeded in this manner: Many Horlemen went formoft who were follow'd by divers Foot arm d with Pikes and other weapons, fome of them brahdiftiingthelameas they went along =, then march'd certain Mufketiers with Drums Trumoets, Pikes, and Cornets founding =, thefe cloth d all in one colour alter the Portugal manner, but with coarfe ftuff of (mall value &gt; and amongft them rode a fervant ofthe Ambafla- dor's, better clad after their falhion, Then follow'd the Ambaffador in the middle between Siaai and Musi Bait, and after him we of his retinue, to wit, the Chaplain, Sig: ConfalvoCarvaglio, Sig: Francefco Montcgro who liv'd at Barcdor, and whom we found atabout fome affi'irs of his own; butbecaufe he wanteda horfe, heappeard roc in the Cavalcade. After us camefome other Hone-men , but, in fumm, there was but few people, a fmaU fcew and htt e gallantry ; demonftrative fignes of the (mallnefsof this Court and the Prince. In this manner we rode tothe Palacewh ftands in a Fort or Citadel of good largenefs, lnc ®X 'mrlnee a great Ditch, and certain ill built baftions. At the entian^XV. we found two very long but- narrow Bulwarks. Within the Ci tadel are many Houfes, and (hops alfo in feveral ftreets , for we paG'd through two Gates, at both which there ftood Guards and all the diftance between them was an inhabited ftreet. We went through thefe two Gates on Horfe-back, which, I believe was a priviledge, for few did fo befides our felves 9 namely, fuch onely as entred where the King was 5 the reft either remaining onHorfe-backat the firftGate, or alighting at the Entrance of the fecond. A third Gate alfo we enter'd, but on Foot, and came into a kind of Court, about which were fitting in Porches many prime Courtiers, and other perfons of quality. Then we came to a fourth Gate guarded with Souldiers, into which one ly weFranchi or Chriftians, and fome few others of the Country were fuffer'd to enters and we prefehtly found the King, who was feated in a kind of Porch on the oppofite fide of a final! Court, upon a Pavement fomewhat rais'd from the Earth cover d with a Canopy like a fquare Tent, but made of boords and gilded. The Floor was cover'd with a piece of Tapiftry fomething old, and the King fat after the manner of the Eaft up on a little Quilt on the out-fide of the Tent, leaning upon one of the pillars which up-held it on the right hand, having at his back two great Cuftiions of fine white Silk. Before him lay his Sword, adonVd with Silver, and a little on one fide almoft in the middle of the Tent, was a fmall eight-corner'd Stand, painted and gilded, either to write upon, orelfeto hold fome thing or other of his. On the right hand, and behind the King, ftood divers Courtiers, one of which continually wav'd a white fan made of fine linnen^ as if to drive away the flies from the King. Befides the King, there was but one perfon fitting, an^ hethe principal Favorite of the Court, call'd Putapai*, and he fat at a good diftance from him on the right hand near the wall As foon as we faw the King afar off, the Ambaffador and we pull d off our Hats, and faluted him after our manner ; he feem'd not to Ihr at alljbut when we approach'd nearer 3 the Ambaffadot was made to fit down within the Tent at a good diftance from the King near the wall, as PHtapaia fate, but on the left fide, at which we enter'd The reft of us ftood a good while before the Tent, on the left fide alfo. yitula Simy approach'd to a Pillar oppofite to that on which the King lean'd, and there fcrr'd as whh fhp A* 5 , ??'

And hereupon the Ambailador arifing from his Seat 5 went to prefent the fame to him almoft kneeling upon one knee 5 and he without moving a whit 5 took it and gave it to FitnU Sinay y who gave it to another, probably, the principal Secretary, without reading or opening it. The Ambaffador had brought a Letter to him likewife written in the Ring of Spain s Name, but did not prefent it now 5 becaufe the Tortngals fay^hat the firft time of going to Audience, they are onely to make a Vifit, and not to treat of bufinels; Then they drew forth the Prefent before the King 5 which was fome pieces of cloth^within one of thofe wooden gilt boxes which are us'd in India 5 a Lance of the Moorifh (hape, to wit, long and fmooth like a Pike, the point of Iron gilt, and the foot em- bellifh'd with Silver, a gallant Target, and the Horfe above- mention'd cover'd with a filken Horle-cloth 5 which Horfe was brought into the Court where the King fate. Aftey he had re- ceiv'd and view'd the Prefent, and taken thelron of the Lancc in his hand 5 which the Ambaffador faid wasof Portugal they caus'd the reft of us to fit down near the outer wall bf the Porch on the left fide, upon a rough Carpet ftrip'd with white and blew, ( of that fort which the Turks and Perjtans call Kidim J (pread upon the pavement of the Porch. The Ambaffador, al though he fate, yet never put on his Hat before the King, (for fo the Nobles are wont to do before the Vice-Roy, namely, to fit, but not to be cover'd ) nor did the King fpeakto him to cover himfelf, but let him continue uncover'd , wherein, to my thinkings he committed an error 3 for going as he did in t^e name of the State, which amongft them is as much as to go in th^King of Spain s Name 5 why Ihould he not be cover'd be fore fo fmall a Prince? And the error (eem'd the greater,becau(e he was the firft that went AmbalTador to Venkctapa Naiek* in the name of the State 5 and confequently, hath mide an ill prefident to fuch as (hall come after him. And in introducing fuch prejudi cial cuftoms, a publick Minifter (hould have his eyes well open : but the truth is, the Portugals of India underftand little, are lit tle Courtiers, and lefs Polititians, how exquifite foevcr they be accounted here, as this Sig: Gio: Fernandez is efteem'd one of the moft accomplifti'd , and, I believe, not undefervedly.

Neverthelefs he fpoke them, profeffing hhnfelf much the fervant of Veu-tapa Naieka, out of hope that he, as Vitula Sinay had promis'd him at Goa , would write to the King of Spain in his favor, by which means he (hould have fome remuneration. Indeed, the Portugah have nothing elfe in their Heads but Interefi:, and therefore their Government goes as 1 As we fate down, ( being four of us that did fo, befides the Ambaflador, to wit, the Chaplain, Caravaglio, Montegro, and nw felf) I handfomely took the laft place , becaufe knowing the nature of the Portugals, I would not have them think that Aran^er went about to take place and prcheminence of thensp^ tbeirlblftnnitieg; and they conformably to their ownhumo^noi onely us'd no Courtefie to me, as well-bred Italians would have done, by faying to me, Amce, afiende Jifperws 5 butlfaw they were greatly pleas'd with my putting my felf in the laftpjjpe, Caravaglio taking the firft, the Chaplain the fecond,and Momfro the third. I, little caring for this, or for (hewing and making my felf known in the Court of Venkctafa Naieka, laug^ within my felf at their manners, and with the obfervation ^created my Curiofity , which alone had brought me into thefe parts. The King's difcourfe to the Ambaflador was diftended to divers things, and, as he was fpeaking, he frequently chaw'd leavs of Betle, which a Courtier reach'd to him now and then, and, when he was minded out a lump of the mafticated leaves, another held a kind of great Cup to his Mouth, for him tofpit into. The King afk'd concerning the flownefs of the Ships this year, as that which difgufted him, in regard of the Money they were to bring him for Pepper. He inquir'd of feveral things of India, and defir'd to know fome kind'of News. The Ambaflador told him all the News we had at Onor^, which were uncertain, being one- ly the Relations of fome vulgar perfons, and therefore,*^ my judgement, too immaturely utter'd 5 affirming, for certain, the coming of the Fleet with a great Army, the Alliance be tween Spain and England, the paflage of the Prince of England into Spain 5 and moreover, (Good God ! ) the reduction of all England to the Catholick Faith by the publick command of that King, with other fuch levities ufual to the Portugals, who are very ignorant ofthie affairs of the world and of State. The King further fpoke long concerning things tranfafted with him in the War of Banghel, particularly, of the Peace that concluded it 5 for which, probably, being difadvantageous to the Portugahy he faid, he heard that many blam'd him the Ambaflador, who ne gotiated it with his Minifters ^ and that they not oncly blam'd himInto the EAST-INDIES. him for it, but faid 3 he would be punifh'd by the Ring of Spain^ who was offended with it 5 whereat being forry;, as his Friend^ he had fent feveral times to Coato inquire tidings concerning him. The Ambaflador anfwer'd, that 'twas true;, there had been fuch acculations againft him and greater, fome alledging that his Highnefs had brib'd him 5 but that they were the words of male volent perfons, which he had always laugh'd at, knowing he had done his duty 3 and onely what the Vice-Roy had appointed him ; and that in Spain they give credit to the informations of the Vice-Roy, and not to the talk of others, as well appear'd by the event. Venkctapb proceeded to fay, that that Peace was ve ry well made for the Portugals^nd that much good had follow'd upon it 5 intimating that they would have made it withdUad- vantage, if it had not been concluded in that manner ds he con cluded it: As if he would have (aid. It had been ill for the 4 Tortugab, with manifeft fignes of a mind infulting over them, /jJ arid that the bufinefs of Banghd was no more to be treated of, *** he afk'd the Ambaflador, How old he was &gt; How many Children he had ? Putting him in mind of his ufing to come, when a very Youth, to ikkgrt with his Father to bring Horfes, 1 dewing himfelf very friendly to him. Nor did the Ambaf- an^ fadlr lofe the occafion of defiring him that he would favor him with hisJLetters to the Ring of ^/w^pretending to hope for much upon alcount of them, a thing which I fhould not commend in an Ambaflador, becaufe he may thereby come to be thought by his natural Prince too partial to, and too intimate with, the Prince with whom he treats &gt; and alfo by this means difparages himjfelf, as if he need to beg the mediation of foreign Princes to his natural Lord, and of fuch Princes too with whom he negotiates in behalf of his own 5 which by no means feems handfome. Then Venkctapa Nakka inquir'd concerning the reft of us, and Vitula sinay anfwer'd his Qyeftions 5 telling him of me, that I was a Roman, and that I travell'd over ib great a part of the World out of Curiofity, and that I writ down what t faw 5 with other things of the fame nature. VenkctaptL Naieka a ^ ,c ^J c 5 Whether I underftood the Language of the Moors ( I anfwer d that I did, together with the Turkjjh and Perjian 5 but Imention'd not tht Arabic^ becaufe I have it notfo ready as the other two, to be able to make ufe of it before every body. He feem'd fufficiently pleas'd in feeing me, and underftanding that I was born at Rome y and came thither fb great a Traveller 5 highly efteeming the ancient fame of Rom* and the Empire, and its new Grandeur and Pontificate of the Chriftians. Thefe and ether Dilcourfes, which I omit for brevity, lafting for fome time, he Caus 'd to be brought to him a piece of Silk embroiderd with Gold, fuch as thewear croft their {boulders, but with us may ferve to cover a Table or fuch like ufe 5 and calling the Ambaflfador before him , whither we accompany'd him, gave it to him, and caus'd it to be put upon his (houlders 5 where= WW' t'tM, / .A-lThe Travels of Peter Delia Valle, X V11. 1 Ml if • fijia f/ ftut 0&gt;.J * tS. xvin. a* ^ tsrt~f /if /y S /y /£ whereupon we weredifmifs'd, and lb going out to Horfe again, we were reconduded home with the lame folemmty and com- 1 ^After this, as we were walking through the City late in the Evening without the Ambaffador, we faw going along the ftreets feveral companies of young girls well cloth 'd after their manner, namely, with fome of the above-mention d wrought and figur'd Silk from the girdle downwards 5 and from thence upward either naked, or elfewith very pure linnen, cither of one colour 5 or {trip d and wrought with feveral, befides a fcart of the fame work caft over the (houlder. Their heads were deck'd with yellow and white flowers form'd into a high and large Diadem, with fome flicking out like Sun-beams, and others twifted together and hangingd own in feveral faftiions 5 which made a prety fight. All of them carry'd in each hand a little round painted Stick, about a fpan long or little more, which ftriking together after a mufical meafure, befides the founds of Drums and other inftru- ments, one of the Ikilfulleft of the company fung one verfe of a fong at once .at the end of which they all reply 'd feven or eight times in number of their meter this word, Cole, Cole, C^,which I know not what it fignifies, but, I believe, tis a word ot joy. Singing in this manner, they went along the ftreet eight or ten together, being either friends or neighbours, follow'd by many other women,not drefs'd in the fame fa{hion,but who were either their Mothers or their Kinf-women. I imagin'd it was forfomc extraordinary Feftival, and I was willing to have follow d them to fee whither they went, and what they did 5 but being in the company of others, I could not handfomely do it, nor had my Companions the fame Curiofity^ as indeed the Portugals are not at all curious. I underftood afterwards that they went to the Piazza of the great Temple, which is moderately large, and there dane'd in circles, finging their fongs till it was late , and that this was a Feftival, which they keep three dayes together at the end of a certain Faft in Honor of Gaurt, one of their Goddefles, Wife of Mobedaca j and therefore'tis celebrated by girts* November the ninth. Walking about the City, I faw a beam rais'd a good height, where, in certain of their Holy-dayes fome devout people are wont to hang themfelves bytheflelh upon hooks faftned to the top of it, and remain a good while fo hanging, the blood running down in the mean time , and they flouriftiing their Sword and Buckler in the Air, and finging verfes in Honor of their Gods. Moreover, in a clofe place oppofite to the Temple, I faw one of thofe very great Carrs, or Gharri- ots, wherein upon certain Feafts they carry their Idols in Pro- ceffion, with many people befides, and Dancing-women, who play on mufical inftruments, fing, and dance. The four wheels of this Carr were fourteen of my (pans in diameter and the wood of the fides was one fpan thick. At the end of it were two great woodenInto the E AS T-IN DIES. wooden Statues, painted with natural colours &gt; one of a Man^ the other of a Woman naked, in difhoneft poftures ? and upon the CartsWhich was very high,was room for abundance of people to ftand ^ and, in brief, it was fb large that fcarce any but the wideft ftreets in Rowe, as Strada, Giulia, or Babuino, would be capable for it to pafs in. I faw alfo certain Indian Fryers, whom in their Language they call Giangama , and perhaps, are the c ? loilr ^ fa^ne with the Sages feen by me elfewhere 5 but they have -) a ®cwotl Wives, and go with their faces fmear'd with afhes, yet not naked , but clad in certain extravagant habits, and a kind o£ picked hood or cowl upon their heads of dy'd linnen, of that colour which is generally us'd amongfl them, namely, a reddifti brick-colour, with many bracelets upon their arms and legs, fill'd with fomething within, that makes a jangling as they walk. But thepretieft and oddeft thing was, to fee certain Souldiers on Horfe-back, and confiderable Captains too, as I was informed, who for ornament of their Horfes wofe hanging behind the faddle-bow two very large taflels ofcerjain white,long, and fine Ikins, (they told me they were the tails of certain wild Oxen found in India, and highly efteenf d) which taflels were about two yards in compafs , and (b long as to reach from the faddle- bow to the ground 5 two, I (ay, hung behind the faddle-bow 5 and two before of equal height,and two others higher at the head ftall ^ fo that there were fix in all: between which the Horfe-man was feen upon the faddle half naked, and riding upon a Horfe which leap'd and curvetted all the way , by which motion thofe fix great tafl'els of (kin, being very light and not at all trouble- fome, but flying up and down, feem'd fo many great wings, which indeed was a prety odd fpedacle, and made me think I faw fo many BeUerophons upon feverall Pegafos's, The fame Evening I faw the companies of girls again , and following them I found that they did not go into the Piazza of the Temple, as they had done the two nights before,but into one of the King's Gardens, which for this purpofe flood open for every body, and is nothing but a great field planted confufedly with (hady and fruit^Frees, Sugar Canes, and other Garden plants. Hither al- moft the whole City flock'd, Men and Women, and all the companies of theflower'd Virgins, who putting themfelves into circles, here and there dane'd and fung 5 yet their dancing was nothing elfe but an eafie walking round, their fnappers alwayes founding ^ onely fometimes they would ftretch forth their legs, and now and then cowre down as if they were going to fit, one conftantly finging, and the reft repeating the word Cole^ Cole, There wanted not other Donne ballatrici. Dancing-women, who exceeded the former in fkill and dexterity :. But in conclufion, they gatherM into feveral companies to fupper, with the other Women that accompany'd them 5 fo did the Men alfo, fome with their Wives, and fome alone, of which there wanted not who invited us, not to cat with them ( for they communicate J* S notThe Travels of Peter Delia Valle, not with ftrangers at the Table) but to takefome of their fare ^ which we thank'd them for, but accepted not, being delighted onely to fee them feaft fo together, difpers'd in fe- veral places of the Garden 5 this being the night that the Faft ended. The fame night a PoftfromG^ brought the Ambaflador a Letter from the Vice-Roy, with another for Fitula Sinay^ and a third from the Captain of Onor. The Ambaflador imparted his intelligence to none 5 but forbad the Poft to let it be known that he had brought Letters 5 whence I conceiv'djthat the News was not good 3 otherwi(eit would have been prefently publifh'd 5 onely I heard fomeobfcure talk of the Malahariaftr^ out F would not inquire further into the matter, as that which did not belong to me 5 efpecially amongft the Portugals who are very dole and referv'd towards ftrangers. November the tenth, I faw paffing along the ftreet a Nephew otVenkctapl Naiek*, his Sifters Son^ a handfbme youth, and fair for thatCountry 5 he was one of thofe that alpire to the fucceffion of this State^nd was now returning from the fields without the Town, whither he ufes to go every Morning.

Before t\it ?aUnchind y march'd a nu merous company of Souldiers, and other people, many Drums and tifcs, two ftrait long Trumpets, and fuch brafs Timbrels as are us'd in Per/ta,Bells and divers other Inftrumfents,which found ed as loud as poflible,and amongft tbem was a troop of Dancing- women adorn'd with Girdles,Ringsupon their Legs,Neck-laces, and other ornaments of Gold, and with certain Pedforals or Breaft-plates, almoft round, in the faftion of a Shield, and but ting out with a Charp ridg before, embroyder'd vyith Gold, and ftuck either with Jewels or fome iiich things v^hjeh refledted the Sun-beams With marvellous fplendor 3 as to the reft of their bodies, they were uncover'd , without any Veil or Head-tire.^ When they came to the Piazza, the Palanchino ftood ftill,and the multitude having made a ring, the Dancing-women fell to dance q after their manner , which was much like the Morif-dance ©f ita1p y jor\dj the Dancers fung as they dane'd, which feem'd much / better : One of them, who, perhaps, was theMiftrefsof the ieft, dane'd alone byherfelf, with extravagant and high jump- ings, but alwayes looking towards the Valanchino : Sometimes (he cowr'd down with her hanches almoft to the ground, fome- times leaping up (he ftruck them with her Feet backwards, (zs Ctelius Rhodiginus relates of the ancient dance call'd Bibafi) continually linging and making feveral geftures with her Hands 5 but after a barbarous manner, and fuch as amongft us would not be thought handfome. The Dance being ended, the FaUnchino with all the train went forward, the Inftruments continually playing before them. Ifollow'd to fee the end, and found that thejy went into the chief ftreet, and (bout of the City by the Gate which leads toSagher, flopping in divers places of the ftreet to act the fame, or the like dances over again, and particular ly, in the Entrance ofthefaid Gate, where,amongft many Trees and Indian Canes which make the City-Wall, thereisafmall Piazza, very eeven, and (haded about, like a Paftoral Scene, and very handfome.

They told me, this honor was done him. becaufe they had then cafl: water upon his Head, and perform 'd fome other Ceremony, equivalent to our ordaining one in Sacris, or creating a Doftor. As I was going along the ftreets to behold this Pomp,! faw many perfons come with much devotion to kifs the Feet of allthofe Giangamoes, who on Foot follow'd the principal Giangamo who was in the Palancbifto $ and becaufe they were many, and it took up much time tokifsthe Feet of them all, therefore when any one came to do it 9 they ftood ftill all in a rank to give him time 5 and whUft fuch peribns were kiffing them, and for more reverence touching their Feet With their Fore-heads, th^fe Giangamoes ftood firm with a kem- ins 1, feverity, and without taking notice of it, as if they had been abftrafted from the things of the World ^ juft as our Fryers ufe to do when any devout perfons come out of reverence to kifs their Habit ^ but with Hypocrifie, conformable to their fuper- ftitious Religion. V . ,, • u Returning home, I met a Corps going to be burn d without the City, with Drums founding before it 3 it was carryed fitting 7 in a Chair, whereurtto it was ty'd that it might not fall, cloth'd in its ordinary attire, exactly as if it had been alive. The (eat / was cover'd behind, and on the fides with red and other colours, /L I know not whether Silk or no. It was open onely before, and there the dead perfop was to be (een. By the company, which Was fmall, I conjedur'd him to be one of mean quality. But they told me, All dead people arc carry'd thus, as well fuch as are buried, ^as the LingAvani ^ whom they alfb put into the Earth fitting^) as thofe that are burnd 5 and that he, whom I faw, was to be burnd, we gather'd from the Fire and Oyle which they carry d after him in'veffels. Thenight following there i . was a great folemnity in all the T emples, by lighting of Candles, finging, Mufick, dancing, about twenty Dancing-women, who went in Procefiion with the Idol into the Piazza, dancing before the great Temple 5 but,as I was told,they began very late,name ly, at the rifing of the Moon , which was about an hourjrifore mid-night 5 fo that I was gone to bed before I knew of it,although in the Evening I faw the lights in the T emple. But though I faw nothing, yet I heard of it as I was in bed, being awaken d by the noife 5 and hearing the fame was to be aded over again the next night, I purposed with my felftofee it. November the fourteenth, I went at night to the Temple to (ee whether there was any extraordinary^folemnity ^ but there was nothing more then ufual,nor did the Idol come forth : onely in the great Temple and its Inclofure or Court, into which they fuffer not ftrangers to enter, they made their accuftom'd Pro- ceflions with mufical inftruments, finging, and other Ceremo nies, which, I conceive, were the fame with thofe I faw in Abi^ mil : onely they are celebrated here every nighty becaufe as 'tis •: a moreInto the EAST-INDIES. 35 '^HeaiL to ?»'or4 ^ingaW come •■ 6 11 tlm e tokilij, ^tQdoit.^ c % their F« nnwithafeej 2S if they Ijj 'ft as our frjej -verence toki to their Tupe i'as catted fittii t not fall, dott 1 alive.

In the day time they did nothing, but talkt a little 3 and fome of them made themfelves drunk with a certain Wine made of dry'd Raifins, or a fort of Aqu* Vit£ and other mixtures, call'd m India ^ Nippa 5 I lay fomc of them, becaufe certain others of lefs ignoble Race, as they are more abftinent in eating, fo they drink not any thing that inebriates At night, they entertaki'd us a good while with Balls, or Dancing, after their mode, accom pany'd with finging, not unpleafant to behold 5 for they confifi: of a numerous company of Women, all well cloth'd and adorn'd with Gold, Jewels, andTreifesof feveral fafliions, who fing and fnap their wooden inftruments. They begin all their Balls flow-- ly, and by degrees growing to a heat,at laft end with furious and quick motions, which appear well enough : Amongft their other Dances two pleas'd me well, one in which they continually re* peated thefe words *-and another wherein they repre- fented a Battel, and the aftions of flaughter 5 in the conclufion, the Mafter of the Ball, who direds all, and was one ofthofe that brought them, dancing in the midft of them with a naked Pony^ ard, wherewith he reprefented the anions of (laughter as the Women did wkh their fhort fticks. But the end of this (hew was more ridiculous: For when they were difmifs'd, theyqot- cnely were not contented with the largefs of the Ambaflador, although I added as much of my own to it, but went away ill fatisfi'd, teftifying the fame by cholerick yellings, which to rae was a new Comedy. November thefixteenth, I was told that the above-mention'd Woman who had refolv'd to burn her felf for her Hufband's death'; was to dye this Evening. But upon further enquiry at the WomansHoufe, I underftood that it would not be till after a few dayesmore, and there 1 (aw her fitting in a Court or Yard,« and other perfons beating Drums about her.

Neither were there wanting about the Idols many of their Pnefts or Mi- nifters of the Temple who accompany'd them ; particularly,one who fcem'd the chief and Archimandrita of the refti befides, abundance of Torches whofe light difpell'd the darkriefs of the Moon -lefi night. In this order they came into the Piazza, and there after they had made a large ring, the dancing began 5 firft two Ballatrici, or Dancing-women, one from one fide of the circle and another from another , yet both with their Faces always turn'd towards the Idols, walk'd three fteps forward, and then three backward ; and this they did innumerable times. i fuppofe, it was a way of faluting the Idols. After the faid two Dancers alone had done thus, two others from the feveral hdej ioyn'd with them, and they did the fame again , three and three. This Salutation, or Preamble of the Bali, being many times repeated, they began to dance, namely , two that danc d better then the reft, one on the right fide of the circle, and the other on the left, both with their Faces, never with their back towards the VaUnchino of the Idols, though often in the Dance they retir'd backwards as well as went forwards. Their dancing was high, with frequent leapings and odd motions, fome- times inclining their pofteriors as if they meant to(itdown,fom€- times rifing very high, and difplaying the Coat wherewith they are cover'd from the girdle downwards, and almoft holding one Arm ftretch'd out before them, wherewith they now and then made as if they were thrufting or fencing 5 befides other mad geftures which were all accornpany'd with words which they fung, and fometimes with cries more ^pt to give horror then delight. Hence, while all the other Dancing-women, (that is, thofe who were uncovered and loofe for dancing ) danced all in a company together further diftant frp 13 ^ t ^ ie * fnapping their little ftieks and finging, being guided by a Man who danced with them and was their Mafter.

This Dance being ended, the Proceffion went forwards with the fame Pomp, and a nu merous Train of Men and Women of all forts. They went round about the outermoft walls of the Temple, which is fur- rounded with very large ftreett, inhabited for the moft part by the faid Dancers , or publick Strumpets. The circuit of the Proceffion began from the right Hand as you come forth of the Temple, which comes to be the left as you enter in ^ and in the fame manner I faw the Proceffion begin at the Temple of th® Town Ahinelk, which I have defcribed above 5 fo that it muft needs be one of their ufual Ceremonies. This ftop 'd at thele- veral places of the ftreets through which it paft 5 and at every fuch ftopping, the above -mention 'd Dancings, Preambles, and other Circumftances were again repeated 5 whence the Shew laft* ed a good while, and concluded at length with the laft Dancein the Piazza before the Temple-Gate 5 which ended, the Pro ceffion with the Idols re -entered the Temple, where being re» placed according to their accuftomed Ceremonies 5 thc folemnity ended, and all the people departed. I was told by one of the fpeftators, that this Ceremony was praftifed every Monday at night, and every New Moon, and every Full, as alfo upon certain other extraordinary folemnities with more or lefsPomp proportionably to theFeftivals: And he added, that the night following there would be a greater folemnity then this, becaufe the New Moon, and another of their Feafts were then co-incident, and that the King himfelf would be there 3 Wheffefore 1 refolved with my felf to fee it. November the one and twentieth, This night were an infinite company of Torches and Candles lighted, not onely in all the Temple, but alfo in all the Streets, Houfes, and Shops ofi^W ^ ) which made a kind of day-light over all the City. In ea'ch of the Temples was its Idol, which in fome was a Serpent; and they had adorned the outward Porches wot onely with lights, but alfo with certain contrivances of papers, on which were painted Men on Horfe-back, Elephants, people a fighting, and other odd figures 5 behind which papers, lights were placed in certain little Arches,like thofe which we make in our Sepulchres, thefe^with other gay Ornaments of Silk hung round about, made a fufticiently prety Shew. In the great Temple , not onely the infide, in the middle whereof is a very high and flender Cupola, (which appears without too) but alio all the outer walls, and all thofe round about the Piazza which lies before it, as alfo the Houfes of the adjacent fides were all full of lights.

The Ring ft a y d in the Temple about an hour, being entertaind with Mufick,Dancing, and other things which I could not fee, becaufe I was without.

Therefore let him either accept the above-faid Offer, or never fpeak more to him, for he would not hear him. That he hath been mov'd rf* , to make this offer of paying him the faid fumm, by the inftance ' ^ of the Portugals , who had interpos 'd in his behalf by this Em- baffie: And that for Banghel's aiTurance that he would perform this, he gave the Ambaffador ('and accordingly he did fo) a Copy of the Letter containing thefe promifes, which he writ to the laid King of Bavghel^ to the end the AmbafTador might fend it to the Vice-Roy,and be a witnefs of what he promis'd and was to obferve./ He has further told the Ambaflador, that this King had formerly writ to him that he would come and live in his Dominion, and repented of what he had done heretofore through evil counfel^ that yet, for the future, he would be at his devotion, receiving that Penfion which he had promis'd Jiim, and the like: Neverthelefshehadnow chang'd hismind, and refus'd both to come into his Dominion., and to go into that of Goa : That therefore feeing him fo unconftant, he had much reafon not to truft him, and, in fhort, would neither truft him, nor give him any thing fa ving upon the above-faid terms? and that not for his own fake , but in regard of the inftance which the Vortngals made for him ; That this was his laft Anfwer, and that nothing more was to be expefted or hoped t from him. From they fay, Orders are fent to the Vice- Roy to re -eftablifh Banghel by all means in his State, and to make war upon Venk-tafk, unlefs hereftore the fame intirely. However, being that Country is remote, and in the time that is Ipent in the going and coming of difpatches, many things may happen which may render it neceffary for the Vice-Roy in the preient conjuncture to proceed in fundry particulars differently from what Orders he receives from Spain, and to have authority in this bufinefs of Banghel to deliberate of Peace or War, as (hall to him feem moft expedient, endeavouring to comply no lefs with the time and the State of things, than the advertifements from Spain : Therefore the King of Spain, in the Letter which he wfit to Venkctapk Naieka , making onely general complements to him, referrs all matter of bufinefs to the Vice-Roy, to guid him-^ 10 j 5 m hi yof(Jfl4; 'ihtl ^&lt; r Pm whe^i ^ r Ww 3 i U ]es ) he had ^ ^telikeafj ? thenPenty There! c verlpeak dm lath been moi 3 ^ytheinftaD eWbythisEi vjo\i\d wg^bedidfo) i which he writ mbaflador mil ithepromis'dii )a{Iador 3 thaii come and Iki ture, he woi :h he had prot / chang'dhisnt andtogoiotoi condant, kfe would neitbc ■above-faidtei ardof theioli t this was list expeftcd orlicp refentto the I i his State, ^ j the lame in® dinthetimetk ion ie Vice-Roy jculars diW [tohaveautk 1 tor War, ^ to comply 110 •he advert^ , the Letter# ' Into the EAST-INDIES. himfelf therein as he (hall think mod fit.

November the three and twentieth. Before my departure from ikker)^ I was prefented from Vitnla Cofwhom I had before taken leave^) with a little Book written in theC^^-Language, * which is the vulgar in ikk^ri and all that State. It is made after the cuftom of the Country, not of paper, Cwhich they feldom ufej but of Palm-leavs ? to wit, ot that Palm which the Portu- gals call Palmum brama, i. e. lVild-palm x and is of that fort whicli produces the Indian Nut ^ for fo do thofe commonly in India,, where Palms that produce Oates are very rare. In the leavs of thefe Palms they write, or irather, ingrave the Letters with an Ironftyle made for thepurpofeofan uncouth form j and 3 that the writing may be more apparent, they ftreak it over with a coal, and tye the leavs together, to make a Book of them after a manner lufficiently ftrange. I being defirous to have one of thefe Books to carry , as a curiofity, to my own Country for or nament of my Library,and not finding any to be fold in the City, had entreated Vitnla sinay to help me to one 5 but he, not find ing any vendible therein, caus'd a fmall one to be purpofely tranferib'd for me, (there being not time enough for a greater} and fent it to me as a gift juft as I was ready to take Horfe. What the Book contains, I know not, but I imagine 'tis Veries in their Language, and I carry it with me, asIdoalfoCto (hew to the curious) djvers leavs not written, and a ftyle or Iron Pen, fuch as they ufey together with one leaf containing a Letter Miffive after their manner, which was written by I know not who to our Ambaflador &gt; of whom taking leave with many complements, as alio of Sig: Carvaglio, the Chaplain, MonUgro^ and all the company, I departed from ihferi a little before noon, going out at the fame Gate whereat I had enter'd 5 and having no other' / ^as there remji for that (he is| '/nesnot otfc the Indian! ^ in Religin ^ceiv'd, Imij I Hay'd hold i efeMenwhoj ^ptovldedoi ino'jiokWd nlavsHttd, I pi ny departure! vhomlhadH; CmuAjiw^ .

( whom I had brought fo carefully out of Verjia^ and trufted fo much, and who alone of all my ancient^ fervants re mained with me) one day cunningly open'd a light box or -balket ( Canefiri the Portugals call them ) wherein I kept my Clothes, and which, after the fafhion of the Country, was not of wood, but of hoops lind with leather, and clos'd with little Pad-locks, like thofe which are us'dati^e for Plate ^ and they are thus contriv d that they may be of little weight,becaufe m thefe parts, carriages and baggages for travel are more fre quently tranfported upon Mens fhoulders then upon beafts backs 5 and one of thefe bafkets oi CaPtejiri is juft a Man's bad. .Now the good Cacciatiir having open d mine, without hurting 'the lock, or medling With the linnen which he found therein, took out onely all the little mony which I then had, and had put into it, to avoid carrying its weight about me 5 it was in one of thofe long leathern purfes, which are made to wear round the wafle like a girdle, and was full of SpaniQi Rialls, a Coyn in thefe parts, and almoft in all the world current enough. His intention, I conceive, was to leave me (as they fay) naked in the Mountains in the center of India-^ and peradventure, to go into fome Territory of the Gentiles ov Mahometans^ thereto pafe a jovial life upon my cxpence. But it pleas d God, the theft being done in my Chamber, where none but he refortedj we had vehement fufpition of him ^ awil therefore the Ambaflador making ufe of his Authority, caus'd him to be laid hold on, and we found the theft in his breeches tyd to his naked ftefh 5 and thus I recover'd my money. I was unwilling any hurt (hould be done to him, and withall, to keep him longer ^ neverthelef* that he might not go into the Infidel-Countries, left thereby he ihoddlofe his Religion and turn to his native errors, Ifenthim away with fome trufty perfons to Goa, giving him Letters alfo to Signora JUaria , but fuch as whereby they might know that I had difmis'd him, and that he was not to be entertaind there, though otherwife indempnifi'd. By this Story you may fee how much a Man may bedeceiv'd in his trufting ^ how little benefits prevail upon an unworthy nature 5 and withall, you may con- fidertowhat misfortunes a Stranger isfubjedin ftrange Coun tries ^ fo that if I had had nothing elfe, being thus depnv d of all, I (hould have been left to perilh miferably amongft Bar barians, j But leaving him to his Voyage, I departed from and {i, having pafs'd the Town Badrapor, I left the road of Ahineh, and ^ by another way more towards the left hand, went to dine undct ^ certain Trees near a fmall Village of four Houfcs, which they U callI he Travels of Peter Delia Valle, / ' / / J li .MJ&amp;StitS' czW Bawanen coppd. After dinner we continu'd our way 5 and foarded a River call'd Inhale^ not without being wet 3 byreafon of the fmalkiefs of my Horfe 5 and having travell'd near two Gdu's (one Gan confifts of two Cos^ and is equivalent to two Portugal Leagues) welodg'd at night in a competent Town, the name whereof is Derwapora. Xln thefe Towns I endeavor'd to procure meaftrvant 5 as well becaufel underftood not the Language of the Country, ffor though he that carry'd my Goods could (peak Portugal^ yet hf could not well ferve me for an Interpreter, be- caufe being by Race a which amongft them is accounted vile and unclean, they would not fuffer him to come into their Houfes, nor touch their things 3 though they Were not (hie of me, albeit of ad iiff rent Religion, becaufe they look'd upon me as a Man of nobk Race) 5 as for that I found much trouble in reference to my dyet; For thefe Indians are extreamly faftidious in edibles, there is neither fledi nor fifh to be had amongft them 5 onemuft be contented onely with Rice, Butter, or Milk, and other fuch inanimate thingn, wherewith neverthelefs they make no ill'tafted diflies, but, which isworfe, they will cook every thing themfelvcs, and will not let others either cat or drink in their veflels ^ wherefore inftead of dirties they gave us our viftu- al$ in great Palm leav§, which yet are fmooth enough, and the Indians themfelves eat more frequently in them then in any other veffels; Befides, one muft entreat them three hours for this, and account it a great favor 3 fo that, in brief, to travel in thefe Countries requires a very large ftock of patience. The truth i?, tis a moft crafty invention of the Devil againfl: the Charity fo much preach'd by our Lord Jefus Chrift, to put it fo in the heads ofthele people, that^hey are polluted and become un clean, even by touching others of a different Religion ^ of which fuperftition, they are fo rigorous obfervers, |:hat they will foon- er fee a perlon whom they account vile and unclean, Cthougha Gentile) dye, then go near him to relieve-him.

Here was an Armado, and a Cafila of Ships, which came from Coa, and went to Mangabr and Cocin, or further 5 they were to depart the next day, and therefore I prepar'd my felf to go with them to Mangahr.

By whofe favour at length, the fail being let down by the cutting of the rope, and the Sea not rough, (Tor, if it had, it would have done us greater mifchief ) the Mariners freed the Ship, having caft themfelves into the Sea, and drawn her off from the ground by ftrength of Arm 5 the remainder of the night ^ve (pent in the mouth of the Haven , foliciting the other Ships out, and mending our own.

Rowing a great way againfl: the ftream, the water whereof for a good fpace is fait, at length we ftay'd to dine at a Town call'd Sale, inhabited for the moft part by Moors, and fituate on the right bank as you go up the River.

This Meffage being related to me, I let pafs the hour of dinner, Cbecaufej having no appetite, and hnding my ftomack heavy, I would not dine this day,) and when it leemda convenient time,I went (with my Interpreter^ cloth'd in black after my cuftom $ yet not with fuch large Breeches down to the heels, as the Fortngals for the moft part are wont to Wear in India, in regard of the heat, (for they are very commo dious, covering all the Leg, and faving the trouble of Stocking lb that the Leg is naked and loofe ) but with Stockins and Garters and ordinary Breeches, without a Gloak, (though us'd by the Portugal-SoMievs in Ivdia, even of greateft quality^ but with a large Coat or Caflbck, open at the fides, after the Coun try fafhion. The Palace,' (which may rather be call'd Capantt* Reale,* Royal Lodge) is entred into by a Gate like the grate or lat tice of our Vine-yards Tit Rome, ordinary enough, feated in the mid ft of a field, which like them is divided by a fmall hedge from the neighbouring fields. Within the Gate is a broad Walk or Alley, on the right fide whereof is a fpacious plot fown, at the end of which, the Walk turns to the right hand, and there upon the fame plot ftands the Royal Manfion, having a profpeft over all the faid great green field. In the middleof this fecond Walk, ^ou enter into the Houfe, afcending feven or eight wooden ftairs, which lead into a large Porch, the length of which is equal to the whole fore-part of the Houfe. This Porch was pav'd with Cow-dung after their manner, the walls about (hining, and painted with a bad red colour much us'd by them. The fore-part of it, which is all open, is up-held by great fquarc pofts, of no great height, ('for'tis their cuftom to make all buildings, efpecially Porches, but low in refped of the breadth and length, with very broad Pent-houfes^ which is, I believe, by reafon of the great heat of the Country, where they have more need of fhadow and ccolnefs, than of air or light. Directly oppofite to the ftairs in the middleof the Porch, was another fmall Porch, which was all the entrance into the inner part of the building. Within the little Porch was a fmall room long and narrow, where the King fate near the wall on the left fide 5 and he fate upon the ground after the Eaftern manner upon one of thofe coarfe clothes, which in Ferfia. and Turkie are calfd Kielim^ and ferve for poor people &gt; nor was it large, but onelyInto the EAST-INDIES. 1 59 onely fo much as to contain the Perfon of the King 3 the reft of the room being bare, faving that it was pollifla'd with Cow-dung. Befide the King, but a little farther on his left hand, fate upon a little matt, fufficient onely to contain him, a Youth of about fifteen or eighteen years of age, call'd Bate Rairh, who was his Nephew, and is to fucceed him, being the Son of his deceafed Sifter, who was Daughter to the prefent Queen. The Father of this Youth was a neighbour Gentile Prince, whom they call the King ofCuwhia, ( or perhaps more corrcftly, Kunble) call'd by his proper name Kamo-Nkto An ^ of which is the proper name, and Art the title* They (aid he was ftill living, though others at Goo. told me afterwards that he was dead. But being this young Bale Rairu was not to fucceed his Father, but had Right of Inheritance in Olaza, therefore he liv'd not in his Father's Country, but here at Mane I with his Grand-mother and his Uncle. None other fate with the King, but three or four of his more confiderable fervants ftood in the room talking with him 5 and in the great Porch, without the little onc,ftood in files on either fide other fervants of inferior de gree, two of which neareft the entrance ventilated the Air with fans of green Taffeta in their Hands, as if to drive away the flyef from the Ring or the entrance 3 a Ceremony us'd , as I have faid elfewhere by Indian!

Such as came to fpeak with the King, ftood without in the Porch, either on one fide, or in the mddle of the little Porch 5 either becaufe the room was very fmall, and not fufficient for many people 5 or rather, as I believe, for more State. The Ring was young, not above feventeen years of age, as they told me, yet hisafpeft fpokehim elder 3 for hte was very fat and lufty, as I could conjecture of him fitting, and befides, he had long hairs of a beard upon his cheeks, which hefuffer'd togrow without cutting, though they appeared to be but the firft down. Of Complexion he was dulky, not black, as his Mother is, but rather of an earthy colour, as aJmoft all the Malabars u(e to be. He had a lowder and bigger voice then Youths of his age ufe to have, and in his fpeaking, geftures, and all other things he (hew'd Judgment and manly gravity. From the girdle upwards he was all naked , faving that he had a thin cloth painted with feveral colours caft crofs his (boul ders. The hair of his head was long after their manner, and ty'd in one great knot,which hung on one fide wrapt up in a little plain linnen, which looks like a night-cap fallen on one fide. From the girdle downwards I faw not what he wore, becaufe he never4 .( /• / v •: ■ i6o XI.

When I came before the King, his Men made me come near to the little Porch in the midft ot them, where ftanding by my lelf 5 after the firft ralutations 5 theKing prefently bid me cover my head, which I fortb-with did without further mtreaty 5 though with the Mother, becaufe a Lady, I wasV.wilhng to fuper-abound m Courtefie, fpeaking to her all the t«ne -uncover d : But with the Son who was a Man, I was minded to enjoy the prmledg of mv defcent. and receive the favour which he did me, as due to my quality.

He aik d me almoft all the fame queftions as his Mother had done; Whence I came ? What Countries I had travell'd through? What Princes i had feen ? Whether I had left my own Country upon any misfortune? Or why? How I would have done thus alone m ftrange Countries, in cafe ot ficknels or other accidents ? To all whkh I anfwer'd, as I had done to his Mother 5 and upon my faying, that I wander'd thus alone up and down trufting in the help of God ^ He afk't me. Who was my God ? I anfwer'd him, (pointing upwards} the God of Heaven, the Creator of the Uni- verfe 5 whereupon certain Souldiers there pre ent, (^in all likely- Moors) as ifapplauding me^faid,^^ Chodia^Chodia^ which in thePerfian Tongue fignifies Lord^nd is meant of God ^ inferring that I worftiip'd the true God, whom they Moors pretended to know, in oppofition to the Idols of the Gentiles of the Country} And they us'd thePerfian word Chodia 0 becaufethat probably the Sed of Mahomet came into thefe parts from Perfta, (which is not very remote from India } as alfo fromor perhaps, becaufe the Indians of the Territory of Idal-Scihh and Dawn, being in great part ufe much the Perfian Tongue which is fpoken in the Courts of thofe Princes no lefs then their natural Language 5 whence thefe other Indians more inwards to the South have, byreaionof neighbourhood, communication both in Religion and Speech.

The King was hugely pleas d with it, and defir d to fee feveral Countries, where they lay, and how great they were, alking me fundry qaeftions about themi but being he vnderftood not our Letters written therein, he frnsfid him- felf with the fight onely ,and with (hewing it tc all the by-ltanderg as a curious and ingenious pi .ce ot Art. Then he afk d me, whe ther I could eat in their Houfes, or of their meats i for he &lt;ldir d to give me fomething to eac : I anfwer'd that I could, and that the purity of our Religion confifled not in the eating or touch ing of things, but in doing good works. He eatnefHy defir a me that I would ftay a while till fome meat wereprepar d tor me', for by all means he would have me eat fomething in his Houfe, and himfelf fee me eating. I told him, that if his inten tion were onely to give me meat, the time was already pa t, nor wis 1 difpos'd to eat; but if it were to fee me eat, I could not eat in that place after the fathion of my Country, not having there the preparations neceflary thereunto, fo that his Highnels fcould not fee what,perhaps,he d fir'd 5 and therefore I befeech d him to excufe me: Neverthelefs he was fo urgent,for it, that, not to appear difcourteous, I confented to obey him. And, till the meat' came, the King commanded fome of his Servants to conduft me to fit down by them in the Porch, where I might lit after our manner, but not in the King s fight. Hereupon I with-drew with fome of his Men to entertain me^ and in the mean time the King remain'd talking with the reit of them concerning me, commending me much for leveral things, but above all, for a good prefence, for (peaking truly anddifcreetly, like a Gentleman, and for my civil deportment.

But to re turn to my Relation, the Ring told me, he would have given me a better entertainment, butyetdefired me to receive this fmall extemporary one, and eat without any refped or (hinefs of thofe that were prefent &gt; for thereby he fhould underftand that I liked it. I anfwer'd, that the Favour and Courtefie which his High- nefs (hew'd me, was fufficient: But as for eating, the time being now paft, I did it onely to obey him 3 and fo, to comply with him, although I had little will to eat, Itafted lightly here and there of thofe fruits and herbs, where-with my Hand was but little foiled, which upon occafion I wiped with my handkerchief, being they ufe no other Table-linnen, nor had laid any for me. The^Kingfeeingthatl touched not the Rice,fpoke to me feveral times to eat of it, and to powre upon it fome of that butter which flood by it prepared. I did not, becaufe I would not greafe my lelf, there being no fpoon for xhz Indians eat every thing with the Hand alone, and fo do the Portugals 5 I know not, whether as having learnt fo to do in India of the Indians 5 or, whether it be their own natural cuftom , but they too, for the moft part eat with the Hand alone, ufing no fpoon, and that very ill-favoured- ly 5 for with the fame Hand, if need be, they mingle together the Rice, the Butter, the Cartl, and all other things how greafie fbever, daubing themfelves up to the wrift, or rather waftiing their Hands in their meat before they eat it 5 (a fafhion indeed fufficiently coarfe for people of Europe) : and thought at their Tables, which are handfome enough, there want not knives, Ipoons, and filver forks 9 and fome few fometimes make ufe thereof ^ Into the EAST-INDIES.The Travels of Peter Delia Valle, f* V v - \ k - iS xi thereof ^ yet the univcrdil cuftom is fuch^ that few ufe them, even when they lie before them.

In jfhort, rhv King frequently urg'd me to eat of the Rice, and I as often deny'd with feveral excufes ^ at laft he was fo importunate, that 1 was fain to tell him , I could not eat that meat in that manner, becaufel had not my Inftruments. The King told mej I might eat after my own way, and take what Inftruments I would, which (hould be fetch'd from my Houfe. I reply'd divers times, that there was no need, and that'my tafiing of it was enough to teffifie my Obedience : However 5 by all means he would have what was neceflary fetch'd from my Houfe.

Of Sciah Ahhas,, the King profefs'd to account him a great Prince, a great Souldier, and a great Captain ^ and I related to him, how I had been for a great while together very familiar with him, and that he had done me many favours, having me with him in divers notable occafions: whereto he anfwer'd, that he did not doubt it, and that, being fuch a perfon as I was, there was no Priiice but would highly favour me. He alk'd me alfo concerning the commodi ties of our Countries, and of thofe which are brought from thence into thefe Oriental parts 5 and Cbeing that in India they are accuftom'd to the Portugals, who, how great Perfonages fo* ever they be, are all Merchants, nor is it any difparagement amongft them ) he alk'd me.

' The King told me, that if I could procure a good Horfe out of my Country, he would pay very well for it 5 for the Indians have none good of their own breed ^ and the good they have, are brought to them either from Arabia or Verfta, and the Tortngals make a Trade of carrying them thither to it 11, even the greateft Perfons, as Governours ot places, and Captains Gene ral, not dildaining todo the fame.

Ever now and then, the King would talk with his Servants, and all was in commendation of me and my difcreet fpeaking, and efpecially of my white com plexion, which they much admired, although in Italy I was ne ver counted one of the fair, and, after fo many Travels, arid fo many futierings both of Body and Mind, I am fo changed that!

December the fixth, I underftood the Qyeen was gone abroad very early to her Works before I was up, without fending for me. Wherefore defiring to difpatch , I fent the Brachman my Interpreter to her, to remember her, that I defir'd to do her Reverence, having come into her Country onely for that pur- pofe, and to know when fhe pleas'd the time (hould be : The Brachman did the Mefiage, and fhe anfwer'd, that I fhould not Wonder at this delay , being (he was employ'd all the day at tnofe works, but however, fhe would fend for me when (he came home.

Then defending down the ftreet, which leads to / the neighbouring River, I faw likewife upon another Hill a little fquareChappel, which inftead of walls was inclofed with pales of wood, and cover'd with a roof. My Interpreter told me, it was built by this Queen., and that there was in it an Idol dedicated to the Devil, to whom out of their fear of him, that he may do them no evil, thefe wretched people do reverence. I hearing ofa thing fo ftrange, though not new to my ears, faid, I would go fee it, that I might affirm with truth I had with my own eyes feen the Devil worihip'd. The Brachman, my Inter preter, diiTwaded me as much as .he could, alledging that many Devils dwelt in that place, and might dome fome mifchief. I told him, that I was not afraid of the Devil, who had no power over me, that himfelf needed to fear him as little as 15 and therefore I defired him to go along with me cheerfully. When he faw me refolute, he accompanyed me to the foot of the Hill, and fhew'd me the way &gt; but it was not pofiible for me to get him further : he remained at a diftance, and faid he would by no means approach near that place, for he was afraid of the Devil. Wherefore I went forward alone, and faid , If that Caitif the Devil could do anything, let him hurt me: for I was his Enemy, and did not value him ^ and that if he did not , it was a fign he had no power. Speaking thus, and invoking the Name of Jefus, ('at which Heaven, Earth, and Hell ought to bow the knee) I mounted up the Hill, and being come to the Chappel, and finding no body there, I opened the door and went in. I faw the Idol ftanding in the middle upon the plain ground, made of white unpolifh'd flone, exceeding a humane ftature, and not of that (hape as we paint the Devil, but like a hand- fome Young Man, with a high round Diadem upon his Head af ter their falhion. From each Arm ifl'u'd two Hands, one of / which was ftretch'd out, the other bended to the body. In the an terior right Handle had a kind of weapon, which, I believe, was one of thofe Indian Ponyards df this form (ii| :===-) ot which t keep one by me: In the Interior left Hand he had a round thing, which I know not what it was, and in the other two Hands, I cannot tell what. Between the Legs was another Sta tue of a naked Man with a long beard, and his Hands upon the ground, as if he had been going upon them like Animals 5 and upon this image the Devil feem'd to ride. On the right Hand of the Idol was a great trunk ofa Tree, dead but adhering to the root, low, and feeming to be the remains of a great Tree that ha^d grown there. I imagine that this Tree was the habitation ot Z 2 It }l1 7 2 I he Travel of Peter Delia Valle, the Devils, who are wont to be in this place, and to do much mif- chief-, to remedy which the Queen founded this Chappel here, and dedicated this Idol to Cwhich they fay is the name of a great Devil, King of many thoufands of Devils) who dwelt here : The fame was afterwards confirm'd to me by others of the Country 3 all confefling that it was Buto, i, e, the Devil ^ for fo they tearm him in their Language. When I had feen all, and Ipit feveral times in the Idols face, I came away and re- turn'd home, upbraiding the Brachman with his Cowardize, and telling him that he might fee whether my Religion were good or no &gt; fincefo powerful and fear'd a Devil could not hurt me when I went to his very houfe5and did himfuch injuries; Whereunto the Brachman knew not what to anfwer. Concerning Idols, they told me, ztManel, that the Queen of O/^&amp;^andall her Family, 7 as'twere upon an Hereditary Account, ador 'dand held for her p r i nc ip a l God, an Idol call 'd Tutu Somnkta, which they faid was ^ ame w j t j 1 Mahadgu, and which they delineated alfo of a round figure , like the little pillar of a Land-mark, circular at the top after this manner as I have elfe-where noted that they pourtray Mahadm in Camhaia , and the Sun in other places. The fame day, December the feventh^ Being return'd home before noon, I took the Altitude of the Sun ztManel with an Aftrolabe. I found him to decline from the Zenith 3 5 degrees 5 r / / he was this day in the fourteenth degree of Sagittary. His /C?. f ^2 f},. 3 Southern Declination was 22 degrees 30'. which fubftraded from 3 5 degrees, (the Altitude which I took, leave 12 degrees 2 9 / . 36^. which is the Declination of the iEquinodial, South wards from the Zenith of Maritl^ and alfo the height of the Northern Pole in that place. So that Manel^ where the Qaeen of Olaza now refides, lyes 12 degrees 29^. 36' / . diftant from the iEquinodial towards the North. At night, having waited all the day, and not hearing of the Queens fending for me, as (he had promis 3 d, I thought not good to importune her further, but imagined fhe was not willing to be vifited more by me. Where fore I gave Order for a Boat to carry me back to the next day. Of the Queens not luffering her felfto be viilted more by me, certain Men of the Country who convers'd with me, gave fundry Reaions: Some (aid, the Queen imagin 'd I would have given her fome Prefent, as indeed I fhould, which would require a requital ^ but, perhaps, fhe had nothing fit to requite me with in thefe wretched places, or was loath to give: So that to avoid the fhame, fhe thought beft to decline the vifit. Others faid 5 there was no other decent placeto give Audience in, but that where her Son was, and for her to come thither, did not (hew well 5 as neither to fend for me into fome other unhand- fome place, nor yet to give me Audience in the Street, when it wasInto the. EAST-INDIES. 173 was no unexpefted meeting but defign'd, for which reafbn (he avoided fpeaking with me. The Brachman, not my Interpre ter, but the other who held my Sword, had a more extrava gant, and (in my opinion^ impertinent conceit, to wit, that there was fpread fuch a Fame of my good prelence^fairnefs, and handfome manner of converfation, that the Queen would not fpeak with me, for fear (he fhould become enamor'd of me, and be guilty of fome unbecomming ad:ion, at which I heartily laugh'd. 'Twas more probable, that (he intended to avoid gi ving people occafion to talk of her, for converfing privately with aftranger that was of fuch Reputation amongft them. But let the Caufe be what it will, I perceiv'd (he declWd my vifit, and therefore caus'd a Boat to be provided, which fthere being no other J was not row'd with Oars, but guided by two Men with Poles of Indian Cane or BamhH 0 which ferv'd well enough for that lhalloW River. The next day, December the eighth, A little before Noon 5 without having feen the Queen or any other, I departed from Mattel, In a place fome-what lower 5 on the left bank of the River, where the Queen receives a Toll of the Wares that paft by, ('which for the moft part areonely Rice^ which is carried out , and brought into her Country J I ftay'd a while to dine. Then continuing my way, I arriv'd very late at Mangalor^ where the Shops being (hut up, and nothing to be got, I was fain to go fupperlefs to bed. Occafion being offer'd for fending this Letter to Goa, whence the Fleet will depart next January, I would not omit it j fo that where-ever I may happen to refide, the Letter may at leaft arrive fafe to you, whofeHands I ki(s with my old Affedtiom LETTER VII.

IN this my excurfion and abfence from Goa, ( which was (hort a but the pleafanteft three Moneths Travel that ever I had J befides the Royal Seats of ikfrert and Mane I, defcrib'd in my laft to you, I had the fortune to go as far as Calecnt , to the other Royal Seat of call'd by his proper Title, il Samorino, where I have ereded the Pillars of my utmoft peregrination to wards the South.

' At this time the heat at Mangalor is fuch as 7 ■ ii : Hi '■■'t 11. it is at Roff/e in the moneth of Jnues or the end oiAuguji, December the eleventh, I went in the Morning about half a ^ League from MangaUr to fee the Hermitage^ where lives and ' e - reigns the Archimandrita of the Indian whom the Por- ^ tugals (ufually liberal of the Royal Title J ftyle King of the i &amp; Gioghi) perhaps becaufe the Indians tearm him (b in their Lan- g ua g e 5 al, ^ in effed he is Lord of a little circuit of Land, where- in, befides the Hermitage and the habitations of the Gioghi are fome few Houfes of the Country people, and a few very fmall ^/// ^ ' Aj Villages fubjeft to his Government.The Hermitage (lands on the J fide of a Hill, in this manner. ^ % J On the edge of the Plain, where the afcent of the Hill be gins, is a great Ciftern or Lake, from which afcending a pair of ftairs, with the face turn'd towards the North, you enter into a Gate, which hath a cover'd Porch, and is the firft of the whole inclofure, which is furrounded with a wall and a ditch like a Fort. Being enter'd 'the faid Gate, and going ftrait for ward through a handfbme broad Walk, beftt on either fide with fundry fruit-trees, you come to another Gate, where there are ftairs and a Porch higher then the former. This opens into a fquare Piazza or great Court, in the middle whereof ftands a Temple of indifferent greatnefs, and for Architecture like the other Temples of the Indian-Gentiles ^ onely the Front looks to wards the Eaft, where the Hill rifeth higher, and the South fide of the Temple ftands towards that Gate which leads into the Court. Behind the T emple, on the (ide of the Court, b a kind of Shed or Pent-houfe with a Charriot in it, which ferves to carry the Idol in Proceffion upon certain Feftivals. Alfo in two or three other places of the fide of the Court, there are little fquare Chappels for other Idols. On the North fide of the Courtis another Gate oppofiteto the former, by which going out and afcending fome few fteps, you fee a great Ciftern or Lake of a long form, built about with black ftone, and ftairs leading down to the furface of the water 5 in one place next the wall 'tis divided into many little Cifterns, and it ferves for the Minifters of the Temple to v afh themfelves in, and to perform their Ceremonies. The Gate of the Temple, as I faid, looks Eaftward, where the Hill begins to rife very high and fteep. From the Front of the Temple to the top of the Hill, are long and broad ftairs of the fame black ftone which lead up to it, and there the place is afterwards plain. Where the ftairs begin, ftands a high, ftrait, and round brazen Pillar, ty'd about in fe- veralInto the EAST-INDIES. 175 veral places with little fillets 5 'tis about 60 Palms high, and one and a half thick from the bottom to the top, with little dimi nution. On this Pillar are plac'd about feventeen round brazen wheels, made with many fpokes round about like ftars: they aretofupport the lights in great Feftivals, and are diftant about three Palms one from another. The top terminates in a great brazen Candleftick of five branches 5 of which the middlemoft is higheft; the other four of equal height. The foot of the Pil lar is fquare, and hath an Idol engraven pn each fide 5 the whole Engine isj or at leaft Teems, all of a piece. ^ T. he Temple, to wit 3 the inner part where the Idol ftands, is likewife all cover'd with brafs: They told me, the walls of the^ whole Inclofure, which are now cover'd with leavs, were fometimes cover'd with large plates of brafs 5 but that Ven^ta^a Naieka carry'd the fame away, when in the war of his Army pillag'd all thefe - Countries 5 which whether it be true or no, I know not 4 The walls of a lefs Inclofure ('wherein according to their cuftoin the Temple ftandsj are alfo furrounded on the outfide with eleven wooden rails up to the top, diftant one above another little more then an Architc&amp;icalPalm} thefe alfo ferve to bear Lights in Feftival occafions 5 which muft needs make a brave Shew, the Temple thereby appearing as if it were all on fire. This Temple is dedicated to an Idol call'd Mogin&amp;to 5 of what form it is I know not, beeauie they would not iufFer us to enter in to fee it. Having view'd the Temple, I afcended the Hill by the flairs, and palling a good way forward on the top thereof, came to the habitations of the Gioghi and their King 5 the place is a Plainjand planted with many Trees, under which are rais d many very great ftone -pavements a little height above the ground 3 for them to fit upon in the (hadow. There are an infinite number of little fquare Chappels with feveral Idols in them, and iomeplaces cover'd over head, but open round about, for the Gioghi to en tertain themfelves in. And laftly, there is the King s Houfe, 1 which is very low built 5 I faw nothing of it, ('and believe there is nothing more) but a fmall Porch, with walls round about colour'd with red, and painted with Elephants and other Ani mals: Befides, in one place a wooden thing like a little fquare ^ bed, fbmewhat rais'd from the ground, and cover d with a Cloth ^like a Tent 5 they told me it was the place where the King us'd to refide, and perhaps alfo to fleep. The King was not here now, but was gone to a Shed or Cottage in a great plain field, to fee fomething, I know not what, done. The Soil is very good^ and kept in tillage 5 where it is not plain, by reafon of the fteepnefs of the Hill, 'tis planted with high goodly Trees, moft of which bear fruit : And indeed, for a Hermitage fo ill kept by people that know not,.or cannot make it delightful, it feem d to me fufficiently handfome. I believe, k was-built^by the Kings of Banghd whilft they flourifh'd, fork lyes in their Territory^ uhThe Travels of Peter Delia Valle, ^nd that thepkee and the Seignory thereof was by them given to the Giorfi i who, as they have no Wives, fo the Dominion of this Hermitage and the adjacent Land, goep not by Inheritance but by Eledive Succeffion. I thought to find abundance of Gioghi here as in our Covents, but I faw not above one or two ^ and they 3 told me, they refort not together, but remain difpers'd here and there as they lift, abide in feveral places in Temples where they pleafe, nor are fubjed to their King in point of Obe dience, as ours are to their Superior, but onely do him Reve rence and Honour , and at certain folemn times great numbers of them affemble here, to whom during their ftay, the King fup plies Visuals. In the Hermitage live many Servants of his and Labourers of the Earth, who till tkefe Lands, whereby he gets Provifion. They told me, that what he pofleffes within and without the Hermitage, yields him about five or fix thoufand Pagods yearly 5 the greateft part whereof he expends in Feafts, and the reft in diet,and in what is needful for the ordinary fervice of the Temple, and his Idols 5 and that Venk-tapk Naiekahzd not yet taken Tribute of him, but 'twas feared he would hereafter. At length I went to fee the King of the Gioghi) and found him employed in his bufinefs after a mean fort, like a Peafant or Vil- laeer.He was an old man with a long white bea^but ftrong and lufty s in either ear hung two little beads, which feemed to be of Gold, I know not whether empty or full, about the bignefs of a Mulket-bullet 5 the holes of his ears were large, and the tips much ft retched by the weight 5 on his head he had a little red ' bonnet, fuch as our Galley -Oaves wear, which caps are brought out of Europe to be fold in India with good profit. From the girdle upwards he was naked, onely he had a piece of Cotton wrought with Lozenges of feveral colours crofshis (houlders^ he was not very low, and, for an Indian, of colour rather white then otherwife. He feemed a man of judgement, but upon tryal in lundry things, I found him not learned. He told me, that for merly he had Horfes, Elephants , Palanchinoes, and a great equipage and power htiox^Venkctap^ N^/e^took away all from him, fo that now he had very little left. That within twenty dayes after, there was to be a great Feaft in that place, to which many Gioghi would repair from feveral parts ^ that it would be worth my feeing, and that I ftiould meet one that could fpeak Arabick^ and Perfian , and was very learned, who could give me fatisfaftion of many things 5 and extolling the qualities of this Giogho, he told me that he had a very great Head (to fignifie the greatnefs of which, he made a great circle with his arms) to wit, of hair, ruffled and long, and which had neither been cut nor combed a great while. I alked him to give me his Name in writing , for my Memory 5 fince I was come to fee him. He anfwer d mel, ' as the Orientals for the fnoft part do to fuch curi- * ous demands) To what purpofe was it ? and,in fine, he would not give it mejbut I perceiv'd 'twas through &lt;1 vain and ignorant fear, thatInto the EAST-INDIES. 177 that it might be of fomemifchief to him. Nevetthelefsatmy soinp; away, I was told by others that he is cali'd Batniato 5 and that the Hermitage and all the adjacent places is'call'd Cadira. 1 Having ended my difcourle with the King, I came away, and, V. at the foot of the Hill, without the firft gate of the Hermitage, reftedtodine, till the heat were over , in the Houfe or Cottage of one of the Peafants, f there being a fmall Village there J whofe Wife fet before us Rice, Caril, and FiQi, which themfelves alfo eat being of a Race allow d ib to do. When the heat was paft, I return'd fair and foftly, as I went, to Man ! and arriv'd at home a good while before night. , , lr „ . December the eighteenth, I prepar a my lelt to go to Carnate . to fee that Queen 5 whofe Territory and Gity is 5 as I have faid elfe- where, two or three Leagues diftant from Mangalor, upon the Sea-eoaft towards the North. The City ftands upon a River which encompaife it 5 and over-flowes the Country round about 3 it was wont to be very ftrong both by Art and (ituation 5 but during the war of Mangafor t Venk'tapa Naieka coming with oreat Army to fubdue and pillage all thefe Countries, fentfor y ^ this Qj.ieen to come and yield Obedience to him. The Queen, 6/ yy who, as f have heard 3 is a Lady of much Virtue and Prudence 5 / fj being unwilling to gender her (elf to Venk^tapA, fummoned her Captains together, told them, that fhe was ready to fpend and give them all the Money and Jewels (he had, and not to be wanting on her part toherutmoft power, if they would prepare themfdve-s to defend the State 1 But thefe Minifters, either through Cowardize or T reachery, would not attempt a defence • ) Whereupon the poor QueenjWho as a W oman could do little by herfelf, (her Son alfo being very young) feeing her people dif- heartned^efolv'd by their advice to furrender her (elf to I enkjtd' f k Naieka ^ and accordingly prepar'dto go to him with a good Guard of Souldiers. Which he hearing, fent to her to come alone without other company then her Attendants 5 which (he did, not voluntarily, but conftrain'd thereto by her hard Fortune, and the little Faith of others. Venkctapa received her honourably, and took her into his Friendfhip and Protedion 5 but withall he caus'd the City to be difmantled of the ftrong walls it had, to prevent her rebelling againft him afterwards, and left her, as be fore , the Government of the State , tying her onely to Obe dience, the payment of a Tribute, and the profefling of a noble Vaffallage to him. When they difmantled the City3 the Qyeen fthey fay J unable to endure the fight, retir'd into afblitary place a little diftant, curfing in thofeherfolitudes thePufillani- mity and Infidelity of her own people, no lefs then the unfortuii- atenefs and weaknefs of the ifyrtugals her defenders, to whom me had been always a faithful Friend. At this time (he lives with her young Son, either in Carnate^ or (bme other place there abouts. ^ . A a BeingJ he Travels of Peter Delia Val!e 5 Being mov'd by the Fame of this Queens VirtueJ was defirous to go and do her Reverence 5 for which purpofe I had gotten a Paianchino ready, and Men to carry me thither. But in the Morning of the above-faid day;, there put in to Mangalor a Fleet of Ships, which they call V ar mat a del Can art, becaufe' it coafts along the' ruines of the Province Can ark 5 or elfe mata dei/aColletta, for that it is maintained with the Money of a New Impoft lay'd upon, and colleded by the Tortugals in their Indian Plantations. The General of this Fleet was Sig: Luis de Mendoza 5 a principal Cavalier or Fridalgo. (as they fpeak ) young, but of very good parts. The Captain of one of the Ships was Sig: Ayres de Siqueira Baraccio, formerly my Friend at Goa^ whom I expedted that I might return thither in his Ship. Whereupon hearing of his Arrival, I went to feek him, and finding him already landed 3 I underftood by him that this Fleet was to go to Calecut, in order to carry thither two Men of Sa- wort RingofC ^to^ (samort is a Title given to all thofe Kings, like our Emperour or C&lt;ejar) which Men he had a little before fentto Goa in the fame Fleet, in another Voyage which it had made upon thofe Coafts, to try the Vice-Roy about a Peace &gt; ( for he had been many years, if not at War, yet at enmity with the Portugals) faying, that if the Vice-Roy inclin'd to Peace, he would afterwards fend Ambaffadors with more folemnity, and treat of Articles. Now thefe Men were returning to Calecut with the Vice-Roy's Anfwer 5 and, as Sig: yfyre/faid, the Fleet would depart from Mangalor the fame night, yet would return very Chortly, becaufe the General had Orders not toftayat Calecnt above four a*d twenty hours, onely till he had landed thele Men, and underftood what Refolution the Samort gave in Anfwer, without giving him more time to think thereupon. That in their return the Fleet would touch at Aiangator^ and all the other Ports of that Coaft , to take with them the Merchants Ships laden with Rice, (which were now prepar'd, or a prepa ring ) and convoy them according to their cuftom to Goa, where, by reafon offcarcityof provi(ion,they were much defir'd.Hearing thisNewSj I was loath tolofethe opportunity of feeing Calecut, (the King whereof is one of the moft famous among the Gentile Princes of India^ and is likely to be at Peace but a little while with the PortHgals ) and therefore refolved to go aboard the Ship of Sig: the fame day, putting off my Journey to whither I had hopes to go at my return. Accordingly difmiffing the Paianchino, and the Men that were to carry me, together with the Servant I had taken at Barfelor, ( becaufe he was not willing to go further with me J, I went aboard alone without any Servant, aftunngmy felf I could not wantattend- ance, and what-ever elfe was needful in the Ship 5 wherein I •found Sig: Manoel Leyton 0 Son of Sig: Gio: Fernandez* Ley ton, embarqu'd as a Souldier (which courfe of life he was now firft eater'd upon), beiides many other eminent Souldiers, who were ' after-J^o tfce EAST-INDIES. vn. afterwards very friendly to me^nd with whom I fpent many days in good converfation. » v December the nineteenth^ We departed from Man gal or ^ and wentformoftof all;, becaufe our Ship was Captain of the Van- suard. This day we pafs'd by a high Hill difcoverd within Land, call'd Monte Deli ^ and the next day, ( December the twentieth) by another 5 calld Monte Ferntojb, At night, anchor'd under Cananor, but enter'd not the Port 3 having fail'd ^ from Mangalor hither always Southwards eighteen Leagues. December the one and twentieth. Once in the Morning, and once in the Evening, we met with Faroes^ which are very light ^ Ships of the Rovers, of whom this Coaft was full, for at Mangalor ends the Province of Canark , and that of Malabar begins: We made ready our Arms both times to fight them, but they fled from us, and recover'd the mouths of the Rivers, whereof that Coafl: is full, where by reafon it was their own Territory, and well guarded in thofe narrow and difficult places^ we could not purfue them to take them ^ onely we difcharg'd fomeGuns againft them atdiftance tono purpofe, which were anfwerd from that Land with the like 5 we might eafily have attempted, if not to take that which we fawin the Evening, yet atleaft to (hatter it a far off with our Cannon, if the Gene ral had not had regard to the Land they recover'd, which be- long'd to the Samorl, to whom upon account of the Peace in agi tation, he was willing to have refpedh At night we came to Anchor under Calecutj which is twelve Leagues Southwards be yond Cananor, December the two and twentieth. Early in the Morning the SamorVs two Men landed at Calecut, and wkh them a Portugal common Souldier, but well clad and attended, whom the Ge neral feht to the Ring with the Vice-Roy's Anfwer, which was ^ That the Vice-Roy was contented to treat of a Peace, and Would gladly conclude it % but on condition that the Samort' made Peace too with the King of Cocin^ the Tortngals Confede- / rate, whom it was not fit to leave out of the (aid Peace , and the rather, becaufe the greateft differences between the ^/x and the Samort were touching the King oi Cocin^ whom the Portngals Juftly defended as their faithful Friend, and had alwayes, to the dammageofthe-S^wr^, his perpetual Adverfary, much fupported 5 That the Samorl were contented to make Peace with both, he fhould fend his AmbafTadors to Goa with power to treat of the conditions, and they (hould be receiv d very well. Within a fhort time the Portugal return d to the Fleet; for the City of Calecut ftands upon the Ihore, and the Samort s Royal Palace is not far off: And together with the Portugal^ the Samort fent to the General a Portugal Boy, eight or ten years old, QdW'&amp;CiccO) who in certain Revolutions of had been taken Prifoner, and was brought up in his Court 5 he fent him well clothM. and accompany'd not onely with many perfon^ Aa 2 - but |j | ! m ill'! he Iravcly of Peter Delia Vallc, but ajfo with Pipes and Drums 5 that he might vifit the General in his Name 3 and give him a Prefent of Elefrediments to eat, nitmely, Indian Figgs 3 Lagnc, and other fruits. His Anfwer to the buiiiiefs was, that the Peace ihould be firft made between bimfelf and the Tortngals^ and afterwards the Interefts of the King of Cocinfaow\&lt;\ be taken into confideration ^ withall, de- fjring the General that he would vouchfafe to ftay a while till he had better advb'd with his Minifters, and deliberated about fending Ambafladors to GW in the fame Fleet 5 with other Rea- fons, which were judg'd rather excufes to put off the time, and hold the Vortugals in a Treaty of Peace, till fome very rich Ships of his which he expeded from Meccha were return 'd , left the Tortugals ftiould moleft them at Sea 5 than real intentions for a Peace &amp; efpecially with the King of Cocin^ with whom he hath long a:nd intricate difcords, not fo eafily to be terminated. The Tortugmls alfo demanded,that the Samort would remove a Garri- fon \vhich he had plac'd in certain Confines, where they for their own fecurity, and the defence of the King of Cocin, were fain to keep a Fort continually , with a great Garrifon and at much expence: And becaufe he fbew'd not much inclination there unto, it was not without caufe judg'd that his Treaties were Artifices, to hold the in fulpence ^ wherefore the Ge neral fent him word. That he had exprefs Order from the Vice- Roy not to ftay longer at Calecut then twenty four hours, and fo long he would ftay : If within that time the Sam on took a Re- folution futable to the Vice-Roy's Propofitions, he would carry his Ambaflador with a good will 5 otherwife, he intended to depart the next night, all the intermediate day being allow'd his Highnefs to determine. With this Reply he re-mandedthe young Child Cicco^ honor'd with fome fmall Prefents, and the other Men that came with him , without fending any of his Vortugals on purpofe, or going afhore torefrefh himfelfand vifit die Savwn, as he was by him invited •, the Vice -Roy having gi ven him fecret Inftru&amp;ion not to truft him too far ,becau(e thefe Kings samort had never been very faithful towards the Fonu- guis. Neverthelefs the General forbad not any Souldierstoland that were fo minded, fo that many of them w T eht afhore, fome to walk up and down, fome to buy things, and fome to do other bulinds 5 as aiio many people came to the Fleet in little boats, partly, to fell things ,and partly, outofcuriofity to fee thePflr^- gals , who in regard of their almoft continual enmity with the Samorl^ feldom usM to be feen in Calecut, 1 he fame day, f the two and twentieth) whilft we were aboard in the Port of Calecut, I took the Sun 's Altitude with my Aftxolabe, and found him to decline at Noon from the Zenith 34 degrees a*id 50 minutes. The Sun was this day in the thirtieth degree of Sagittary 5 whence according to my Canon of Declination, which I had fromF.FrA Paolo Maria-Cittadini, hedeciin'd from the Jiquino£Ual towards the South 23 degreesInto the EAST-INDIES. 18 and 28 minutes, which according to that Canon is the greateft Declination 5 ifit be not really fo 3 the little that is wanting may be allowed for the anticipation of four hours^if not more 5 that the Noon-tide falls fooner at Calecut than in any other Meridian of S^rfl/^according to which my Canon of Declination (hall be cal culated 5 fo that if from the 34 degrees 50 minutes in which I found the Sun^ youfubftrad the 23 dgrees 28'. which I prefup- pofe him to decline from the iEquinoftial towards the South, the remainder is 11 degrees 2 2 / . and fo much is the Elevation of /^y the North Pole in this place 5 and confequently, the City of ' / I Cakcut lyes 11 degrees 2 2 / . diftant from the iEquinodial wards the North. After dinner, I landed alfo with the Captain ' 1 of my Ship^and fome other Souldiers 5 we went to fee the Bazar, which is near the (hore 5 the Houfes, or rather Cottages are built of Earth and Palm-leav 5 t s being very low, the Streets alfo are very narrow, but indifferently long 5 the Market was full of all forts of provifion, and other things neceffary to the liveli hood of that people, conformable to their Cuftom 5 for as for Clothing, they need little, both Men and Women going quite naked, laving that they have a piece either of Cotton or Silk hanging down from the girdle to the knees, and covering their (hame ^ the better fort are Wont to wear it either all blew, or white ftrip'd with Azure, or AzurjC and fome other colour, a dark blew being moft efteernd amongft them. f Moreover, both Men and Women wear their hair long, and ty'd about the head $ the Women, with a lock hanging on one fide under the ear be- commingly enough, asalmoftall Indian-Women do 5 thedref- fing of whofe head, is, in my opinion, the gallanteft that I have feen in any other Nation : The Men have alock hanging down from the crown of the head , fometimes a little inclined on one fide 5 fome of them ufe a fmall colour'd head-band, but the Wo men ufenone at all. Both fexes have their arms full of bracelets, their ears of pendants, and their necks of jewels &gt; the Men com monly go with their naked Swords and Bucklers, or other Arms in their hands, as I faid of thofe of Balagate. The Inhabitants of the Kingdom of Calecut, and the In-land IX, parts, efpecially the better fort, are all Gentiles, of the Rac® Nairi for the moft part, by profeffion Souldiers , fufficiently ^^ fwafhingand brave: But the Sea-coafts are full of Malahari, an 1 adventitious people, though of long (landing 5 {ox Marco Polo V /' who writ four hundred years (ince, makes mention of them 5 / they live confufedly with the Pagans, and fpeak the fame Language, but yet are Mahometans in Religion. From them, all that Country for a long trad together is call'd Malabar, fa mous in India for the continual Robberies committed at Sea by the Malabar Thieves^ whence in the Ba%ar ot Calecut, be- fides the things above-mention'd, we faw fold good ftore of the Portugals commodities, as Swords, Arms, Books, Clothes of Goa, and the like Merchandizes taken from frrtvgal \182 7he'travels of Peter Delia Valle, Hi - &lt; i | 1 : i X. ob** tyft /t, /£ c/a &amp;&lt;niso &gt;-#^7 . at Sea ^ which things, becaufe ftoUen 5 and in regard of the Ex- communication which lyes upon us in that cale 5 are not bought by our Ghriftians. Having feen the and ftay'd there till it was late 5 we were minded to fee the more inward and noble parts of the City, and the out-fide of the Kings Palace &gt; for to fee the King at that hour we had no intention, nor did we come prepar'd for it, but were in the fame garb which we wore in the Ship. Accordingly we walk'd a good way towards the Palace, for the City is great, and we found it to confift of plots befet with abundance of high Trees, amongft the boughs whereof, a great many of wild Monkies, and within thefe clofe Groves, (land the Houfes, for the moft part at a diftance from the com mon Wayes or Streets, they appear but little, few of their out- fides being (een, befides the low walls made of a black ftone fur- rounding thefe plots, and dividing them from the Streets, which a re much better than thofe of the Vazar, but without any orna ment of Windows fo that he that walks through the City, may think that he is rather in the midft of uninhabited Gardens, than of an inhabited City : Neverthelefs it is well peopled, and hath many Inhabitants,whofe being contented with narrow buildings, is the caufe that it appears but fmall. As we walked in this manner, we met one of tho(e Men who had been at Goo. with the Vice- Roy 5 and bccaufe he faw us many together^ and imagin d there was fome perfon of quality amongft us, or b^aufe he knew our General, he invited us to go with him to his King 8 Palace 5 and going before us as our guide, conducted us thither, Healfofent one before to advertife the King of our coming, and told us, we muft jjy all means go to (ee him, becaufe his Highnefs was d^- lirous to lee us and^talk with us: Wherefore, not to appear dif- courteous, we were conftrein'd to confent to his Requeft, iiotwithftanding the unexpeftednefs of and our unpreparednefs for, the vifit. The firft and principal Gate of the Palace opens upon a little Piazza . .which is befet with certain very great T rees, affording a delightful fhadow. I faw no Guard before it, it was great and open} but before it, was a row of Balifters, about four or five foot from the ground, which ferv 'd to keep out not onely Horfes and other Animals, but alfoMen uponoccafion. In the middle was a little pair of Stairs without the Gate leading into n , and anotherwithin on the other fide. Yet, I believe, both the Stairs and the Balifrersare moveable, becaufe 'tis likely that when the King comes forth, the Gate is clearly open 5 otherwife it would not be handfome, but this is onely my conjecture. We enter'd this Gate, afcending the Stairs upon the Rails, where we were met by the Melienger whom the above-faid perfon had fent to the King,and who again invited us into the Palace by the Kings Order. Within the Gate we found a great Court, of a long form, without any juft and proportionate figure of Archite- d:ure ; on the fides, were many lodgings in feveral places, and inInto the E A S T-IN D I E S. 182 ' - ——— — ———^— V'-——■ ' in the middle 3 were planted divers great Trees for (hadow : The King's chief apartment, and (as I believe, by what I (hall men tion hereafter J where his Women were, was at the end of the Court, oppofite to the left fide of the Entrance. The Edifice, in comparison of ours, wasbf little confideration 5 but, accord ing to their mode, both for greatnefs and appearance, capable of a Royal Family .It had a cover'd porch in that form,as all their ftrudures have, and within that was a door of no great largenefs leading into the Houfe. Here we found Cicco the Portugal youth, become an Indian in Habit and Language, but, as himfelf told us, and as his Portugal Name,which he ftill retain'd among the Gen tiles, demonftrated, no Renegado but a ChriHian &gt; which I ra ther believe, becaufe indeed the Indian-Gentiles admit not, nor care to admit other ftrangers to their Religion, aslhaveelfe- where noted 5 for conjoyning fo irifeparately, as they do, their Religion to the Defcents or Races of Men, as a Man can never be of other Race then what he was born of 5 fo they alfo think that he neither can nor ought to be of any other Religion, although in Habit, Language, aftd Cuftomes, he accommodate himfelf to the people with whom he lives. With the fald Ciccti we found many other of the King's Courtiers who waited for us, and here we conversed with them a good while before the Gate, expeding a new Meffage from the King, who, they told us, was now bathing himlelf, according to their cuftom, after fupper. Nor was it long before Order came from the Ring for us to enter, and accordingly we were introdue'd into that fecond Gate 5 and palling by a clofe room like a chamber,(in which I few the Image of Brahma upon his Peacock, and other IdoletsJ we enter'd into a little open Court, 'furrounded with two rows of narrow and low Cloyfters, to wit, one level with the ground, and the other s fomewhat higher. The pavement of the porch was alfo fomething rais'd above the plane of the Court, fo much as might (erve for a Man to fit after our mariner. The King was not in this fmall Court, but they told us we muft attend him here, and he would come prefently : Whereupon we betook our felves to fit down upon that rais'd pavement of the porch, the Courtiers ftanding round about us 5 amongft which, the Portugal Cicco, and ano ther Indian Man, fwho, as theyfaid, was a Chriftian, and being fbmetimes a flave to the Portugals, had fled hither for Liberty, and was entertain'd in the King's Guard) ferv'd us for Interpre ters 5 but not well, becaufe the Man fpoke not the Portugal Tongue fo much as tolerably, and Cicco having been taken when he was very young, remembred but little of his own Language. No fooner were we feated in this place, but two Girls about twelve years old enter'd at the fame Gate whereat we came in 5 they were all naked, (as, I faid above, the Women generally go^ faving that they had a very fmall blew cloth wrap'd about their immodefties, and their Arms 3 Ears, and Necks, were full of or namentsi g ^ J he fravels of Peter Del la \ al 1c, naments of Gold and very rich Jewels. Their colour was fome- what fwarthy, as all thefe Nations are, but in refped of others of the fame Country, clear enough 5 and their (hape no lefs pro portionable and ;c6mely 3 than their afped was handfome and wel- favour'd. They were both the Daughters, as they told us, of the Queen, that is, not of the Ring but of his Stfter,who is ftyl'd, and ineffed is. Queen 5 for thefe Gentiles uiingto derive the defcent and inheritance by the line of the Women, though the Government is allow'd to Men, as more fit for it, and he that governes iscall'dKing, yet the King's Sifter, and,amongft them, Cif there be more then one J (he to whom, by reafon of Age, or for other refpedh it belongs, is cali'd, and properly is Queen, and cr/? /7 not any Wife or Concubine of the King, who ha's many. So Sa * alfo when the King, ( who governes upon the account of being Son of the Queen-Mother J happens to dye, his own Sons fuc- ceed him not, (becaufe they arc not the Sons of the Queen J but S the Sons of his Sifter 5 or in defeat of fuch, thofe of the neareft y Kinf-women by the fame Female line: So that thefe two Girls, whom I call the Nieces of xheSamorl, were right Princeflesor (f Infantaes of the Kingdom of Calecut, Upon their entrance where we were, all the Courtiers prefent ftiew'd great Reverence to them 5 and we, underftanding who they were, arofe from our feat, and having faluted them, ftood all the time afterwards be fore them bare-headed. For want of Language we fpoke not to them, becaufe the above-faid Indian-ilave was retir'd at a diftance upon their coming, giving place to other more noble Courtiers: And Cicco ftood fo demurely by us, that he durft not lift up his eyes to behold them, much lefs fpeak 5 having already learnt the Court-falhions and good manners of the place. Ne- vertheleft they talk'd much together concerning us, as they ftood, and we alfo of them, andallfmil'd without underftand ing one another. One of them being more forward could not contain, but approaching gently towards me, almoft touoh'd the Sleeve of my Coat with her hand, making a fign of wonder to her Sifcer^how we could go fo wrap'd up and intangled in clothes as we feeuAf to her to be ; Such is the power of Cuftom, that their going naked feem'd no more ftrange to us, than our being cloth'd appear'd extravagant to them. After a fhort fpace the King came in at the fame door, accompany'd with many others. He was a young Man of thirty or five and thirty years of Age, to my thinking, of a large bulk of body, fufficiently fair tor an Indian, and ot a handfome prefence. He is call d (as a principal Courtier, whom I afterwards alk'd, told me) by the proper name ofFikJra, His Beard was fomewhat long, and equally round about his Face , he was naked, having onely a piece of tine changeable cotten cloth, blew and white, hanging trom the girdle to the middle of the Leg. He had divers bracelets on his Arms, pendants at his Ears, and other ornaments with many Jewels and rubies of value. In his Hand he carry'd a painted ftaff,Into the EAST-INDIES. 85 ■irwasfo,, (if it were not an Indian Cane) like a Shep-herd's ftafF^ e&amp; of Qt L upon which fix'd in the earth, juft as Shep-herds are reprefcnted ennU in our Comedies, he ftood leaning for a while. When he was fatuted by us, he receiv'd us fmiling, and with much courtefie 5 and whilft his two Neeces ftood by him leaning againft a high banck to fit upon, we ftood orderly in the Court juft before the Ring 5 and the whole Court and the Porches being full of other Courtiers who came in, partly, with the King, and partly, by fome 'other little entrances. I will not omit the manner how thofe that entred fainted the King 5 for I faw more then one do it, and particularly, a Youth who enter'd a good while after the King by one of thofe little Gates 5 to whom in parti cular the King fpake much , and of whom he feemed to make great account. In his falutation he advanced his joyned Hands over his Head, then parting them a little, fo extended and ex alted , he fmote them lightly together twice or thrice, to wit, the palm of one Hand with the four longeft Fingers of the other joyned together 5 which whole action he repeated twice or thrice. Such as had weapons, lifted up their joyned Hands above their Heads, with their Swords, Ponyards, Bucklers, or other Arms in them, and inftead of ftriking with their Fingers, as by reafon of their Arms they could not,they bowed down their Hands fb conjoyned, and made the points of their Swords touch theground.Nolefs full were the higher Cloyfters round about of Women, who ftood there t6 behold us 5 amongft whom ftood apart in the moft eminent place the Qiieen, Sifter to the King, a Woman of ripe Age, cloth'd in blew Cotton as to her lower parts, and abundantly adorned with Jewels. The King defiling to talk with us, cauled the youth to draw near.and afterwards called for the Indian Slave above-men tioned 5 bec2ufeC/m&gt; 5 either out of exceffive Reverence, or for t hat he had forgotten the Portugal-T ongue, durft not undertake to interpret. He aiked our Captain who he was,and how called ? The Captain would not confefs himfelf Captain of a Ship, and fb become known, but counterfeiting another Name, faid, he was 4 a private Souldier, and Companion to the reft of us ^ which the King(eemed not to believe. He enquired likewife concerning the other Souldiers prefent ^ and above all,very particularly con cerning me , pointing at the pendant which I wore in my Ear, almoft like their Cuftom o£ India^ and looking upon me for it with fome wonder, as a thing which he knew not-ufual among the Fortugals whereupon I told him who I was, to wit, of what Country, and fomething I faid briefly concerning the curiofity of my Travells, that I had run through fo many Coun tries onely to fee the world, and was at length come to his Court, being no Vortugal^ but of Rome^ a different and remote Nation from Portugal 5 with all which he feem'd well pleas d # He bid us feveral times put on our Hats ^ but our Captain, whofe example 'twas fit for us to follow, being refolv'd not to make B b himfelf v-|■if.' r ' j \ % The Travels of Peter Delia Valle, himfelf known 3 not onely would not do it 3 but retus d it both by geftures and words, which I liked not well 5 for (baking his Head and fmiling, he anfwerd that he would not, that they {hould not caufe him to commit that falfe Latine, what ever elfe he did 5 that indeed it was not a thing to be jeafted in 5 with other fuch gallantries s he conceiving, as I believe, that herein confided all the punftuality ot this Audience on his part: So that none of the reft of us cover'd himfelf 5 but it would not have been ill done^ ifthe favour had been with better Anfwers then by faying, as the Captain did twice or thrice, (with greater Courtlhip, as he thought) that it was hot, and therefore he would not put on his Hat, which his fmiling betray'd to be but an excufe ^ though he conceiv'd he thereby (he w'd himfelf an ex cellent Courper, Then the King began to fpeak to our Cap tain, (whom he well perceiv'd to be the Chief of the company) concerning the Peace 5 yet laying no more then what he had fig- nifi'd to our General, and dehring him to perfwade the General not to depart fo foon from Calecvt, but to ftay till he had con- fulted better with his Minifters, and had time to give a better and more determinate Refolution.The Captain anfwer'd cuning- ly, that thefe matters did not belong to him, who was a private Souldier, and was come thither onely to fee the City and the Palace, whither he had been unexpedtedly invited by his High- nefs 5 that as to the Peace,it was to be treated of with the Gene ral, who had already anfwered his Highnefs as far as he could, according to the Orders given him by the Vice -Roy 5 neverthe- lefs that in Obedience to his Highnefs, he would deliver this Meflage to him in the Evening. The King (aw that a Soul dier of ours had one of thofe Harquebuzes, which the Par tubals call Baccamarti, which are very (hort, of a large bore, and with a Fire-lock after the Englifh-faihion. He afked to have it brought to him to look upon , whereupon a Courtier taking it out of the Souldier's Hand reach'd it to the King, not giving it into his Hand, Cfbr 'tis not lawful for them to touch a thing at the fame time with the King) but (becaufe it would neither have been handfome to have lay 'd it down on the ground for the Ring to take it up) therefore he took this courfe^ Hefetthe but-end of the Harquebuz upon the ground at a little diftance from the King, and then giving the bore-end a gentle caft from himfelf, made it fall into the Hands of the King, who held them ready for that purpofe. The Ring taking the Harquebuz in hisHand, pre- fently fhaked the powder out of the pan upon the ground, left aqydifafter (hould befallhim, (for he perceived it was charged) then lifting it up to his Eye, he looked through the fight, (hew ing thereby that he was a good markef-man, as they told us af terwards he was. He look'd much upon the Fire-lock as a thing unknown to them, for their Guns have onely match &gt; and being he ieemed much taken with this piece , I told the Captain it would be handfome to prefent it to him, and indeed had it been mine.- ry 1 ' ttfs'li 1 coinpam Into the EAST-INDIES. mineI ftiould willingly have given it him. The Captain fpoke'to the Souldier, who 5 uncapableof fuch noble thoughts^ anfwered that he would give it to the Ring if he might have forty Piafters for it, which was above twice the value. So that the King not offering to buy it, nor the Captain to lay out fo much Money in order to prefent it to him, the pleafuring him there with was waved 5 nor was it otherwife offered to him, as in my opinion Civility required. Neverthelefs the Ring never let it it go out of his Hand fo long as we were with him. After wards be (hewed us a little Parrot ftanding in an open Cage under the Cloyfter, he endeavoured tocaule it to fpeak in our prefence 5 and becaufe our Interpreters were not very good, he fent to call an eminent Servant of his, who fpoke the ?or- tugd-Tougue better, to come and interpret in this Conver- fation. , . n. j The Signori Portogheft my Companions, little accultomed to Princes Courts, though otherwife well bred, gave me occafion to laugh within my felf at two things. The firft was , that it ap pearing to them unhandfome, that the Ring flood all the while he difcourfed with us } as he did s or at moft , leaned onelj on the wall or hisftaff, they took upon them to fpeak to his Highnefs to fit down, and not put himfelf to fuch trouble. I diffwaded the Captain from it by all means, becaufe Rings are Rings., and (it or ftand when they pleafe, and do what they lifi^ 'tis their part to command 5 nor are we to ufe thofe Comple ments with them which we do to our equals , but always leave them to their own will and pleafure, for this is the breeding of the Court: Butmy counfel prevailed little, for the Captain wag refolved to (peak and defire him to (it down, as he did, not once, but twice or thrice 5 of which, neverthelefs the Ring made little account, and anfweredonely with a fmile. The fecond thing that made me laugh, was, that when the Ring entered into the little Court, the door whereat he and we had enterd before, was immediately made faft with an Ironbarr, people alfb ftand ing continually to guard it &gt; and fo likewife when any one came in, or was fent out by the Ring, it was prefently fhut with dili gence. The Captain and the other Portugals did not like this fhutting of the door, and began prefently to mutter amongft themfelves, and to fiifpe^t that the Ring intended to detain them prifoners there, or to put fome trick upon them 5 and^ what would the General and others (ay in Goa , for theii coming to put themfelves in a Cage thus, without the order and leave of their General, onely upon meer curiofity ? I adyis 'd them to be quiet, telling them that it was not befitting a Ring to do fuch an oft, nor was there any occafion why the Ring fhould be (o treacherous 5 that we were not fb many ^ nor io conhderable that the doing thereof would be of any profit to him, or damag® to the Portugal Nation.

This partly quieted them, although they very ill indur'd to fee themfelves (hut up. I told them fur ther. that it belong'd to the King to difmifs us when he pleas'd, and that, (houW we be late, the General would excufe us for our delay, at leaft, if not for our too-great Curiofity, which yet was no high crime as the cafe ftood, almoft all the Souldiers be ing come a (bore this day. Neverthelefs they twice or thrice de manded of the Ring that he would let them go, alledging that it was already late to return aboard, as indeed it was ^ but the King alwayes exens'd it, and would not difmifs thein 5 laying, That we muft ftay till the Man he hadTent for was comegbecaufc he wasdefirous to talk a little better with us, and that he would fend us aboard in his own Boats, at any time when it (hould be needful j for, there being no form'd Harbour at Calecut , but an open (hoare, the Ships rode at a good diftance from the Land. At length came the expeded Interpreter, who was a prime Brachman, and a Man of great Authority with the King &gt; for I obferved, that he alone of all that were prefent, leaned upon his ftafFas the King did, and, as himfelf faid, he had fometimes treat ed of weighty affairs on his Kings behalf with the Portugals in / £ 7 . ^ } the enterprize of Cognale, perhaps not iu the dayes of this Sam- but of his Predeceflbr : So that he faid, he was very well known to the Vice-R.oy, and the chief Captains of Goa vers'd in thofe parts. Upon the entrance of this Man, the King call'd our Captain to come up to him upon the raifed pavement of the Porch ^ he refufed at firft twice or thrice, but at length was prevailed withrby the inftances both of the King himfelf, and of this Brachmdn. Here the King fell largely to difcourfe with him, and with us about the Peace, about his defireto have the Fleet ftay a while longer for eftabliftiing a firm Friendfhip with the PertHgals^ud about divers o^her things 5 many of which were the fame that he had fpoken before. In (hort, the Audience lafted till night, the two little Ladies his Neeces, being prefent almoft all the time, ('for they went and came now and thenj and the Queen in the upper Cloyfter, in beholding of whom, tofpeak truth, I was more attentive than in all hearing thefe difcourfes, which I well faw were of little importance, and therefore I can not relate more pundually. At length it growing dark, upon our Captain s importunity the King difmifs'd us, and the door being open'd, we were fuffer'd to go forth, but firft he caus'd many branches of Indian Figs and Lagne, to be brought and prefente'd to us i) the Courtiers giving them to our Captain and the other Souldiers, not by ftretching forth the Hand, but by toffing them in the Aitj as their cuftora is, I believe, to avoid being contami nated is natIntothe EAST-INDIES. nated by our contad. The King did the like , when at our departure he reftor'd theHarquebuz to its owner 5 for he caft it after the fame manner into the Hands of one of his Courtiers as it was caft to him, but gently, and with much care left it fhould fail, bowing himfelf almoft to the ground for that purpofe, as it was neceflary to do by reafon of the ftiortnefs of the piece. Thefe Ceremonies, of not being touch'd, and the like, of which in publick demonftration they are fo rigorous, yet in (ecret and when theypleafe, they do not To exadly obferve. And'twas told us of this King, that he is a great drinker of Wine, though rigoroufly prohibited by his Religion, and that hehathfbme- times eaten and drunk at the fame Table with Vortugah very familiarly 3 and that he is a Man of very affable humour, and a great friend to a jovial life, as alfo his carriage towards us de- monftrated. Befides the Lagne and Figs which he appointed focne of his Servants to carry for us even to the Boats, he gave our Captain a wild Pig alive, which he caus'd to be brought from fome inner rooms of the Court, and being ty'd with a rope to be carry'd likewife to the Sea-fide, whither aUb he fent many, and fome of* the principal of his Courtiers, to accompany us. A little after us he Tent again to the General, one of thofetwo Men which had been at G^, Cto wit, he who conduced us to the Palace, and was prefent at the whole Audience^ to vilit the General in his Name, carry him new refrefhments of Fruits, and defirehim not to depart fo foon. But before I proceed further,for the better underftanding of what I have already written, I will here prefent to your view a rough and unmeafur'd Plat-form of the Palace, and the place where he gave us Audience. 11 l in a I v i l, The•V\ , \&gt;v.v: Into the EAST-INDIES. 8.

Our Captain in the clofe of the Audience, and when he receiv'd the Lagne. Being difmils'd hy t\\£Samort^ as is above-iaidj, we return'd to the Sea-fide to go aboard, it being now night, but becaufe there were but two or three very fmall boats, in each of which not above two or three could go at a time, in regard the Sea was £ome-what rough, and we were many, it came to be above one a clock in the night before we all got aboard. Our Captain was one of the firft, and he went prefently to give an account of what had pafs'd this day between us and the Samort to the General, who was minded to depart forth-with 5 but under- ftanding that the Souldiers were not yet all embarqued, and particularly, the Captain telling him that I was ftill on {hore 3 he gave order to move but llowly in expectation of me. In the mean ume the Meflenger went to him to defire him to ftay a little longer ^ whereupon the General, though he knew it would be of little importance in reference to the Treaty of Peace, yet not to appear difcourteous, and perhaps alio upon account of lome expediency in order to our Navigation, he determined to ftay all this night in the Port of C ale cut. The Mefienger returning afhoar with this anfwer, found me alone of all the Fleer, ftill there, where fome of the principal kept me company all the while, and left me not till they law me in the Boat, ufing much diligence, to difpatch all others as foon as poffible 5 and in the mean time that we waited, which was above an hour, holding me by the hand, and exprefling many other careffes and demonftrations of kindnefs to me. Before I leave CalecHt, I (hall here obferve one ftrange cuftom x of the people of thefe parts. The Gentil Nairi have no pe- Va culiar Wives, but all Women are common amon^t them ^ and when any man repairs to vifit one of them, he leaves his weapons at the door, which fign fufficiently debars all others from en- tringinto diftu):b him &gt; nor does this courfe beget any dHgufi / ^ or jealoufie. The Women are maintained by thofe men that have to do V^ith them. The children neither feek nor many times know, ^ho their Father is, but that defcent by the Mo- /u/ — ther s fide is alone confidered, and according to that all inheri- ^ li tances/Xy/ f y ./ w/ IS ^/ / * 0 S? rzrm 11 The Travels of Peter Delia Valle, tances are transferred. The fame is obferved among Pripces and tlieir Wives 5 the Queens, who are the King's SifterSj ufe to niarry other neighbouring KingS5and go into their States to have ^ children, who are to fucceed in the Kingdoms of their Uncles, ^ and by this means are of Royal blood both by Father and Mo- ^ ther. Thefe PrincefTes are held in great efteem by the Kings % fru ^-^their Husbands 5 yet if they are minded to try other men, they are not prohibited, but may and oftentimes do fo, making de of whom they fancy for their pleafure, but efpecially of fome Brachmans or other of their Husband's principal Coartiers, who with their privity and confent are wont to converfe and praftife with them moft intrinfecally in the Palace. The King;, and all others, as I have faid, commonly go naked 5 only they have a cloth wherewith they are girded, reaching to the mid-leg. Yet when upon any occafion the King is minded to appear much in Majefty, he puts on only a white Veftment of very fine Cotton, never uiing either Cloth of Gold or Silk. Others alfo when they pleale may wear the like garment but not in the King s pre- fence, in which tis not lawfulfor any to appear otherwife then naked, laving the Cloth above-mentioned. The Arms which every one wears, muft not be laid afide at any time, efpecially not before the King 5 and, as^I have elfewhere noted, everyone keeps to one fort of Arms, .which he firft takes to, without ever changing. When two Kings happen to war together, each Ar my takes great heed not to kill the contrary King^ nor Co much as to ftrike his Umbrella wherever it goes, which is amongft them the Enfign of Royalty 5 becaufe, befides that it would be a great (in to have a hand in Royal blood, the party or' fide ■which fhould kill or wound him , would expofe themfelves to great and ii reparable mi (chiefs, in regard of the Obligation the whole Kingdom of the wounded orllain King hath to revenge S him with the greateft deftrudtion of their enemies 5 even with the / ce,:tain ^ 0 ^ s t ^ e i r own lives if it b^ needful. By how much fuch Kings are of greater dignity among them, fo much longer / this obligation of turious revenge endureth.

December the thirtieth. About noon we entred the Port of Mangalor. I had a defire to go to Carnate to fee that Queen, and had already given Money for a Boat to carry me thither, being I might fooner and better go fo then with a Valanchino , but this Journey was difappointed as well as my former, I know not by what unhappy deftiny^ for I underftood that the Fleet was by all means to depart from Mangalor the next day, fb that I could not have time to go and return ^ and if I loft the opportunity of this Fleet, God knows when I fhould have another of pafiing to Goa^ whither other confiderations of my bufinefs required me to repair as foon as might be.

Our Coiripanions that were neareft would have dene the like, but the General, who was far behind in another place of the Cafila, fhot off a Piece to command all to ftay for him, reafona- bly conceiving it the beft way to attaque the enemy altogether &gt; whereupon all the other Ships of the Fleet which were behind us, ftood ftill awhile 5 but we alone/eeing our felves fo far en- gag d and fo near the Enemy, whatever the others did, would by no means ftay but continud our courfe. Which Sig.

We were now with in Falcon-lhot (for greater Pieces then Falcons thefe Ships carry not) but forbore to fire till a nearer approach might make the (hot more certain 5 which feem'd alfo to be the Enemie's defign : when being come fo neer as to fpeak and be heard, and ftanding ready to give fire both to the Ordnance and Mufket,by the voi ces and cries on either fide we found each other to be friends;for thefe Ships were an unexpected and extraordinary Fleet of / Tortugals fent to Coctn to convey fecurelyfrom thence to Got certain moneys of the Confraternity della Mifericordta,and other Provifions. Hereupon the feud ceafing, the mortal thunder was turn'd into joyful falutationsj with chearflil noife of Drums and Trumpets ^ at the found whereof the Morning beginning to clear up, feem'd alfo to haften to rejoyce with us and part our erroneous fray.

But God gives not all things to all. It being now broad day, wefet fail with the whole Cafila ^ but byreafbn of contrary wind, fail'd no more then three leagues^ and late in the evening came to anchor, in the place where we hapned to be 5 the contray North weft wind beginning to grow more boifterous.

This I(land of Salfette is full of .'very fair Towns, and abundance ^of Houfes.

Having anchor'd in the Bay of Mormogon in good time, and knowing that we were not to depart the night following, our Captain with fome others of us wentafhoreto fee a Place and Church of the Jefuits call'd S. Andrea^ which they told us was hard by ; yet we found it not fo near, but that we walk't about a league to get to it, becaufe we knew not the right way, but miftookit, and were tain to leap over very broad and deep ditches of water, into one whereof one our Company hapned to tall, to the great laughter of the reft, befides many other incon- \ veniences. We found the Church large, neat and well built, with a fair fquare Court or Yard before it, furrounded with handlom Stone-walls, and within with fome great Trees, under which were Banks rais'd to fit upon in the (hadow. On one fide of the Church was a very fair and well-built Houfe for the Fadre Kettore, who hath the prefent fuperintendency thereof? which Church and Building would be very magnificent not only for thii place but for the City of Rome it (elf. We ftay'd a good while difcourfing with the F.

January the eleventh, at our departing from the Port of Mor~ ntogon this day, in which we were to arrive at Goa^ the Gene ral, who was wont to go in the Rear-guard, being now mind ed to go in the middle of the Armada, commanded our Ship (hitherto Captain of the Vant-guard) to remain behind all the reft for guarding the Rear-guard : where great diligence was to tobeus'd, both that no ftragling Ship might be in danger of be ing furpriz'd by Rovers, or any of the Merchants VefTels flip afideto av®id paying Cuftom at Goa^ and go to unlade in other places of Counterband. Wherefore having fail'd the little re mainder of the way, and caus'd all the other Ships to enter, which were in number more then two hundred and fifty 5 we at length enter'd the Bar or Mouth of the Rio of Goa^ where we anchor'd under a Port hard by, without going further to the City 5 it being the cuftom for no Fleets to arrive in the City without the advice and Licence of the Viceroy. Here we found the Ship, which alone was to go this year to Portugal ulrezAy la den and ready to fail 5 as alfo fome Galeons in readinefs likewife^ whether to be fent to Ormuz or elfewhere I know not. Sig, Jyres de Siqueida Captain of our Ship, having got leave of the Gene ral, went to Goa with a Manciva or Boat which came to him for that purpofe 5 and I with Sig. Francefco Pefiiotto Captain of another Ship,Sig. ManoelLeyera and fome few Soldiers accompa- ni'd him. We arriv'd at Goa when it was dark night, becaufe'tis three leagues from the mouth of the Bar to the City, almoft di- rediy from South to North 5 fo that there is a confiderable diffe rence between the altitude of the Pole at Goa, and the mouth of the Bar. Having landed, every one went to his own home 5 and I, who had no houfe ready for me, nor yet any fervant,went alone, as I was 3 to lodg in the Houfe of Sig. Antonio Baracio my friend^ccording as himlelf &amp; SigrK/ry Gomes his Brother had pro mised I (hould when I departed from G^.AsT was going thither I was unexpectedly met by the faid two Brothers, who receiv'd me with their wonted courteiie. My Bed and Goods which I had in the Ship were foon after brought to the fame place by the pro curement of Sig. Ayres, I underftood here that my quondam fervant the honeft Cacciatur coming hither from Ikfcerl to Goa after his falfe dealing with me, had attempted to put a trick up on Signora Maria alfo, but it did not fucceed. He feign'd that I had fent him beforehand to take order for a houfe againft my return, and was importunate for mony to prepare and provide things neceffary. My letter he ventur'd not to prelent but pre tended a misfortune at Sea, whereby it was loft, with other luch inventions. Hereupon Signora Maria fufpeded him, and, with out my Letters, gave no credit to him, as neither did Signora Maria 1 tBsa i 81 1 ili I■r aoo , ■ The 'travels Peter Delia Valle, ' Maria da Cugtoa. So that feeing his devices to get mony from tbeni 3 proved ineffedua^he came no more in fight, and we believe is gone into the Territories of the Moors amongft the Mahome- tans 3 having heard no more news of him. XXI. January the twentieth, a Proclamation was put forth by the Vice-roy for all Portugal Soldiers fthey call allfuchas have not Wives, Soldati) and alfo all Dijpacciati, though marri'd 3 to prepare to go to Ormhr ^ it being given out that the Vice-roy in tended to pafs thither in perfonwitha great Armada and Gale- ons.Amongft theP^fcg^/i^thofe are calfd Dijpacciati^who having ended their fervices, which every one is oblig'd to perform for eight years, only with that fmall pay and maintenance which is given to Servants (which indeed is very (lenderJ, upon petition to the Ring in Spain and reprefentation of the fait hjuinefs of their fervices, according as the fame are greater or lef^ 3 are difmifs'd by the King with fome honourable and profitable Charge, as Cap tain of a Fort, and the like 5 to injoy the fame for three years or fome other determinate time. Which Charges they enter not upon as foon as the fame are granted, but when it falls to them of courfe according to the time of their difmiffion: whereby it comes to pafs that fome never enjoy them as long as they live, nor yet their fons fometimes, unlefs very late, (in cafe the favour extend to their fons tooj becaufe all the faid Charges or Offices go by feniority, every man' time beginning from the day of their difmiffion 5 and oftentimes it happens that for ty or fifty are difmifs'd at the fame time with him, all who muft jfirft enjoy the fame Office or elfedy to make way for him. In brief, 'tis an invention of the Kings of Portugal, much for their own intereft 3 for not having much to give in recompence of fer- vices, they by this means pay the greateft part of thofe that ferve them with hopes alone 5 which alfo prove very well to them, the men of this nation being of fuch an humor that they not only are contented with thefe bare hopes, and hold themfelves well re quited formany great and toilfom fervice, but make great ac- \ count thereof, for thefe Reverfions,which are to fall God knows when, aretheeftate and fupport of many, the portions of many Daughters, and in brief, in refped of the little other eftates they liave in India, one of the beft and moft considerable advantages that they pofiefs, befides their being of much reputation and ho- _ . j* nour. Now to all fuch as were in this manner difmifs'd was this Proclamation direded, obliging them to go toOrwuz with the Vice-roy under penalty of lofing all their Reverfions. But for all this, intelligent men did not believe that the Vice-roy would undertake this Expedition, both becaufe they did not hold him a man likely to take up fuch a relolution, and becauie there were not luch.preparations made in Goa for his voyage,as was recjuilite. X X 11. January the two and twentieth, a Galeot under the command of Sig. ManoeldePaiva^oxxi friend, arriv'd at Goa from in which were many perfons that had come to sindi with other v . v Ships .■A\Into the E AS T-I N D I E S. ^io Ships from Afafiat ^ amongfl: the reft there was a confiderablc Soldier belonging to RuyFreird, who brought certain news of bis own knowledge, how the faidita^ Freira having held Orwilz clofely befieg'd for a long time, and brought the Defendants to ^ great diftrefs for want of all things ^ at length, no relief com ing to him, no provifions wherewith to continue the Siege, (his VidaaliJ failing him) was conftrain'd to raife the Siege and re turn to Mafcat with all his Army $ yet with intention to make new provifions, and get new fuccours and ammunitions, and then to return again to^befiege the place 5 which in the mean time the Moors omitted not to fupply with all fort of necefiaries for a long time, to repair the fortifications and re-inforce it with frefti Soldiers. AH which confider'd, I hold the retaking of Ormuz very difficult, both in regard of the courage the enemy hath re- fum'd by this adtion, and becaufe the fame fcarcity ofVidtuals will happen frequently, andiha (hort time to the befiegers no lefs then to the befieged, being the Ifland affords nothing of it fdf, and our provifions muft be fetcht from greater diftance then thofe of the enemies; wherein not much diligence being us'd on our part, I doubt not but it will be very difficult for them to hold the Siege long ^ and when they intermit the fame never fo little, as they have done now , that fhort time is fufficient to fecure the place from famine^ becaufe having the Continent fo neer hand, and provifions there in much plenty,^ it may be in one day alone fupply'd for many months. As for taking it by battery ot otherwife ^ the Portngals being fo few and little skill'd in fuch Arts, and on the other fide the enemies fo numerous and indefa tigable in undergoing toil and pains, I hold it very difficult. The Viceroy of Coa, who had been fo cold in fending fuccours to Ruy Freira 1 becaufe he would not that he fhould take but only hold it ftreightned till himfelf went in perfon to reap the fruit of others labours 5 that fo he might with the glory ot this victory cover the pafs'd negledt he had committed in the fhame^ fullofsof the Ships in the Voyage when he came into India: now hearing this news, and how Ortnuz^ which he thought he $ had in his clutches, was by the retreat of Ruy Freira (who would infallibly write into of the wrong done him in not fending him any forces or fuccour during a year's time that he had been upon the attempt-, and heinoufly charge the Viceroy for it) efeap'd out of his hands, and become Very difficult to be taken, was infinitely troubled thereat 5 and indeed I know not how he can excufe himfelf to his Matter for fo great negligences ^ and feme have heard him lament himfelfmuclvnd fay that it was his own fault. However it were 3 the talk of his going to Ormnzhz* came very cold upon thefe news? and if it was not believ'd at firft, after this it was held wholly defperate^ although to encourage others to theexpeditic^he ftill kept up the report. The lame Ship brought news, how Kuy Freira, whilft he was at the^ /&gt; Sic^e of Ormuz* with his few Ships, fent two to the (height ot • / Q D d Mecha,•J; :: I! ■) 1 J / ? 1. •• ■ 111 lllii ' /&gt; m tAr &gt;/ 7 XXIIJ.

Befides, during his being before Ormu'z ^ he had fent fome other Ships to fall upon the Country of thofe Arabians whom they call living upon the Coafls of Perjia in the gulf above MogojiAn^ and that this enterprize fucceeded well enough, they having made great deftrudion, and taken much fpoil: but afterwards the Captains of the fame Ships being gree dy of prey j contrary to the order of Kuy Freira, and againftthe judgment of one of them who was the head of all the reft (little obedience is an ordinary thing among the Portugals^ and cauies infinite diforders) defign'd to fet upon another place 3 whole Go- vernout;) who was an Arabian Sceich, at firft attempted to make them forbear with good words^aying that he was theirVaila1,8cc. but whenhefaw 3 thatcourtefieprevaird not againft their rapaci ty, he got his men together, and made head againfl: them &gt; lb that allaulting them in a convenient place as they were out of order, he defeated them, killing many, and amongft thofe, di vers Captains and Soldiers of valour, which wasnofmall lols. It was further related, that during the Siege of Ormuz, the be- fieg'd being in great ftreights for all other things, and which was mofl: important, of water alfo,which within fail'd them and was corrupted 5 yet Ruj Freira could not hinder them from ferching plenty of very good water as often as they pleas'd at a place of the liland without the Garrifbn, which they call Irumbhfo where, not through want of Soldiers, (for he might have had Arabians enough and others of thofe Countries) but for want of money to pay and fupport them, he could never place a guard to prevent tlie enemies from fetching as much water as they pleas'd. They (aid laftly, that Ruy Freira was at Mafat folia ting for aid,and preparing to return to Or muz as foon as he (hould beprovided of what was needful. By the fame Ship a Jew came from Sindi who had lately dwelt in Ornitiz, and came to Sindt by fea from Guadel, which is a Port of the Kingdom of Kic and Macran^ and was come to Gnadal by land from Sphahan, He was a fagacious perfon, and affirmed to me for certain that the Prince of Kic and Macran was a friend and obedient to the Perjians, and that there pafled through his Country infinite Cafilasoi Merchandize which came from India to Guadel by Sea, and from thence were tranfported into Perfia upon Camels , and that this way was not only frequented (incc the taking of Ormuz which was declined during that War, but was alio very fecure and afforded much profit to the faid Prince ot Macran^ becaufe at he received divers Cuftoms of the abovelaid Merchandizes, and before thispafs was open 3 hehadno profit profit' HipaDii thtPn' becaufe who rais fjjdpafs A 01 difpofe^ W ml, ( makep: the Can lebrafM bnlloM of all th( Banners, ante' after \\ valcade hndin the Nei compan' Faith 01 ntjjks) \ fdfed in of very mov'dfro ramidsup Aelndiat of h 0 Writes 1 Nations (lations 3 preach ; Province Miracles i tliefe Pyi both at tfc ^nhrou| kfttlie fa Aiclikpifc Colled^ thei foaieii^ isfeoie theQ ity CoJledg,Into the EAST-INDIES. xxi\r. ijieb- profit at all.

January the twenty fifth. The Jefuits of the Colledge of Saint Paul, fthis day being the Feaft of their Coll edge J began to make part of their Solemnities, which were to be made for joy of the Canonization of their Saints Ignatio and Sciavier 5 the Ce lebration of which was deferred till now, that more time might be allotted for preparation., They came forth with a Cavalcade of all their Collegians divided into three Squadrons under three Banners, one of which reprefented the Aftatickt, one the Africans^ ^ and another the Europ&lt;eans' 0 thofe of each Squadron being clothed ^ after the manner of their refpeftive Countries. Before the Ca- 1 valcade, went a Chariot of Clouds with on the top, whp founding her Trumpet with the adjunction of Mufick, publilhed the News of the laid Canonization. Two other Chariots ac- company'd the Cavalcade, the hindermoft of which reprefented Faith or the Church $ the other in the middle was a Mount Par- najfus, with Afollo and the Mufes reprefenting the Sciences pro- felfed in the faid Colledge ^ both which Chariots, were alfo full of very good Mufick and many people. Moreover, they re- mov'd from place to place amongft the Cavalcade five great Py ramids upon wheels, drawn by Men on foot, well cloth'd after the Indian fafhion. Upon the firft were painted all the Martyrs of the Order of Jefuits 5 upon another, all the Doftors and Writers of Books ^ upon another, figures of Men of all fuch Nations in their proper habits, where the faid Otder hath foun dations, to reprefent the Languages in which the Fathers of it preach : Another had abundance of Devifes relating to all the Provinces of the faid Religion 5 and laftly, another had all the Miracles both of Sanf Ignatio, and San Francefco Sciavter. All of thefe Pyramids had Epitaphs, Statues, and other Ornaments both at the pedeftal and at the top &gt; fo that pafling in this man ner through the principal ftreets of the City, they planted and left the faid Pyramids in feveral places^ one before theSeetjr Archiepifcopal Church 5 one before the profefs'd Houfe oi Giesti$ one before the Church of San Paolo, where at firft they kept the Colledge^ but by reafon of thebadrlefsof the Air, remov d it from thence, yet the Church remaining to them, which was fometimes much frequented and magnificent, but at this day is but meanly provided for 5 fo that they are ftill in conteft with the City about it,who unwillingly confent to this changing of the Colledge.

Guadulufe lies at the foot of a certain Precipice in a plain foil upon a fpa- tious Lake, which at one time of the year is quite dry'd up and fown with Rice, fo that the profped is always very lovely 5 be- caufe the Lake is either full of water, in which grow abundance of pretty Flowers and aquatick Plants? or elfe'tis all green with Rice, which is fown before the Lake is totally dry and grows up to maturity before the Water return ? fo that it makes a very prgtty Shew, and the more becaufe this Water being colleded in great rain, is fed alfo by a fmall but conftantly running River 5 and though fo kept there for many months, yet caufes not any bad affeftionof the Air 5 but through the h ? goodnefs of the Cli mate the Air is always better here then any where elfe.

It comprehended not onely the whole Life, but alfo the Death of San Francefio Sciavier, the tranfportation of his Body to his afcenfion into Heaven 5 andlaftly, his Canonization. ^ On the feventh of the fame moneth, Mafs was fung in the Colledge of San Paolo Nouvo, and a predication made by F. Flaminio Calo an Italian, upon the Beatification of the Blefled Luigi Gonzaga, who was alfo a Father of the Society. In the Evening 3 the Portugals of quality paffed about the ttreets in a Mafkerade , accompanyed with Chariots and Mulick 5 about twelve of us went out of the Houfeof S\g: Antonio Bar(ucio, all clothed in the fame Livery, whioh I took care to get made according to my Phanfiejand I ordered it after the faftiion of the ancient Roman Warriers, juft as the ancient Empercurs ufe to be piftur'd 5 the colours were Carnation and White, with feve- ral Imprelles on the breaft, every one after his own Phanfie 5 it— --''f'' — Into the EAST-INDIES. a o 7 it appear cl very well by night, and was the beft and greateft Body of the whole Maskerade.

Which Imprefs I have been wont to ufe frequently fince the aeath of my Wife SitHMaam^ the Work of my clothes was wholly together Flames, onely diftinguiihed here and therewith Tears which (hewed my grief. . February the eighteenth,In the Morning lolemn Mais was lung^ and a Sermon made upon the Canonization of the Saints in San Paolo Vecchio. In the Afternoon, Lifts and a Ring being prepared before the Church of Giesu, many great Fortugal Gentlemen richly clothed, came as to run Carreers both at the one and the other, giving Divertifement to the Ladies who ftood beholding them on Balconies and Scaffolds. The like they did afterwards in the ftreet of San Paolo Vecchio. February the nineteenth, A very fblemn Proceffion was made from San Paolo Vecchio to Giesu, through the principal ftreets ot the City 5 which Proceffion exceeded all the reft, in number of Pageants, Chariots, and Ships, and other Engins filled with people who reprefented feveral things, and good Mufick, ac- companyed with feveral Dances on Foot, and many other brave devices i Of all which things I fpeak not, becaufe I have a print' ed Relation thereof by me. In^he endoftheProceffion, was carried by many of the Fathers in their Copes the Body of ^ Fra ?i&amp;fco Sciavier^ inclos'd in a fair and rich Silver Coffin, with a Silver Canopie over it made very gallant, and the Effigies of the Saint behind : Then came a great Standard with the pourtray- tures of the Saints, carry'd like wife by fome of the Fathers 5 and after that, all the Croilesof their PariQies ot Salfette, and onely one company of the Fryers of Saint Of the other Religions that are in Goa^ none appear d here ^ bccau(e they faid they would notgointh^Proceflionsof the Jefuits, fince the Tefuits wjnt not in thofe of others.

They carry'd in Proceffion a Chrift with the Crols on his (boulders, and many went along difciplining themfelves, bein^ cloth'd with white fack-cloth, gallant and handfome, -very' gravely, according to the humor of the Nation. In ^eve- ral places of the City certain Altars were plac'd, where the Pro- ceflion ftood ftilU and after fome time fpent in fingmg, the Chrift turn'd backwards, reprefenting that paflage, Fihas IL,, ii:!

At length, the Proceflion being come to the Church, Dell a Gratia, where it ended, after the Attgujiine Nunns (whofe Covent ftands near that of the Fryers in the fame Piazza) had fung a while, an Image of ddvoito Santo, of our Lord's Coun tenance like that at Rome, was (hown to the people gather'd to gether in the faid Piazza,from a window of one of the Bell-turrets which are on either fide the front of the faid Church 5 and (b the Solemnity ended. But the above-mention'd Altars in the ftreets are every Fryday during Lent adorn'd in the ramemanner,and vi- lited by the people every day, and alfb many hours of the nighty }uft as the Church of Saint Peter at Rome is vifited every Fry day oE March ^ and they call this vifiting 3 Corror os Pajfos, that is, go ing about and vifiting the fteps of our Lord 5 which fervesthe people, during this time of Lent, no lefs for devotion then for paftime. March the firft, There was al(b another Proceffion in Goa of the Difciplinanti, which I went not to fee 5 the like is made every Fry day during all Lent, and therefore I (hall not ftand to defcribe it. I believe there is no City in the world, where there are more Proceflions made then in Goa all the yfcat long 5 and the reafon is, becaufe the Religious are numerous, and much more then the City needs 5 they are alfo of great authority and very rich, and the People being naturally idle, and addided to Shews, negleding other Cares of more weight, and perhaps more profitable to thePublick,readily imploy themfelves iq^Jiefe matters} which, however gooc^as facred and parts of divine wor- (hip, yet in fuch a City as this which borders upon Enemies, and is the Mearopolis of a Kingdom lying in the midft of Barbanam t and fo alwayes at Warr, and where nothing elfe (hould be mind ed but Arms and Fleets, feem according to worldly Policy un profitable and too frequent, as alfo fo great a number of Religi ous and Ecclefiaftical perfons is burdenfome to the State, and prejudicial to the Militia. In the Evening of everv Frydayd Lent, there is a Sermon upon the Paflion, in the ChulWof Giesu j and lb likewife in other Churches, but upon other dayes and hours. At the end of thefe Sermons certain Tabernacles are open'd, and divers figures, reprefenting fome paflages of the Paf- fion, (according to the fubjedt of the Sermon ) are with lighted Tapers (hew'd to the People &gt; as one day that of the EcceHo*to\ another day. Our Lord with the Crofs upon his (houlders 5 and thelaftday, the Crucifix 5 and fo every day, one thing futable tothepurpofe. Oftentimes they make thefe figures move and turn, as they made the Robe fall off from the EcceHowo, and difcover the wounded Body 5 at which fight the devout People utter prodigious Cryes, and the Women force themfelves to (hreek out 5 and the Signore, or Gentlewomen, are fo zealous, that. i. ■ lutothe EAST-INDIES. 209 that they not onely cry out themfelves, but make their Maids do fo too, and beat them even in the Church if they do not 3 and that very lowdly, whether they have a will to it or no. Strange devotion indeed ! March the third. Ten Ships of Warr were at length fent from III. Goa. to the barr or mouth of the Sea, in order to depart (as they did) within two or three dayes towardsto ■K/y the General of which was Sig: Sancho de Toar^ Brother to Veedor da Fazenda, who was T reafnrer and Captain of one of the Ships. Our Friend Sig: Michel Pereira Boralho ^ who was fometimes Captain of the Galeons 3 went alfo 5 his Brother Giovan Boralho^ was kill 'd under Rvy Freirajn the battle with'the Englifli at Gias^ laft year 3 being Admiral of that Fleet, which next the General is the prime charge, having been many times before Capitan Maggiore, as they fpeak, or General, in theStreight of Ormiiz 5 I make particular mention of him upon account of his relation to Sig: Michel our Friend. But fuch a fuccour for Or muz after fo long a time, is indeed a very inconfiderable matter. Yet, they fay, other Ships are preparing to be fent after thefe. March the one and twentieth, I took the Altitude of the Sun at Goa with my Aftrolabe, and found him decline at noon from the Zenith towards the South fpurtecn degrees, and forty mi- ^ nutes. He was this day in the thirtieth degree of Pifcer, and ^# cu confequently, in the iEquinodial without any DecUnation 5 fo / that without making any Subftra^tion or Addition to this num- /A o ber. Go*, that is, the City, will lye juft fo many degrees (14. gr. ^ 40'J from the Equinoctial towards the North,and alfo have the Northern Pole elevated as many. March the eight and twentieth,News was brought to Goahow the great Mogholhzd caus'd all the Englifti that were at his Court j y( ^ J; to be (lain, and imprifoned all the reft that were at Surat. As ^ f for thofe that were (lain, fome fay it was by the Moghol's Order in way of punilhment, and that they were hang d and otherwife executed ? Others fay, it was by chance, as they endeavoured to defend themfelves by Arms, when he fent onely to arreft them prifoners, as he did thofe of Surat s and this feems moft likely. Beit as it will,this Accident may eafily difturb their Commere fomething in that Country. The occafion is reported thus. A few dayes, or moneths agoe, the Englifti in Surat apprehending themfelves aggrieved to a confiderable fumm by the Mogol's Mi- nifters, (whether by exaftion of Cuftoms,or ia Accounts, I know not) to repair the lofs by force, fince otherwife they could not, made reprifal of fome of the Moghofs fhips, which were come abroad full laden 5 and being the Gogol's people were not able to deal with the Englifti at Sea, they were conftraind for reco vering their furpris'd Veffels, to grant the Englifti everything demanded, and fatisfie them fo far as they pretended to be ag grieved. Which thing coming afterwards to the King's know- iedgejhe caus'd alk)f that Nation to be apprehended where-ever E e found i 1 111 jjUi II1 r iii iii 1 ■■.!

For my part, I think the Englifh have not manag'd their bufinefs difcreetly in this cafe 5 for how is it poffible for a few ftrangers and inmates to conteftwith, and get the better of 5 a great King in his own Country ? And upon rifing of the like differences, I (hould account it the beft courfe to accord them with good words, and amicably with the faid--King, by com plaining of his Minifters, and procuring him to provide in luch cafes as well as may be^ and this courfe maylucceed happily: Otherwife, if redrefs can be obtainM, then, before amanifeft feud, 'twere beft to get out of his-power, and warr upon him fecurely3not in his own Country where there are fo many people, and the King, undoubtedly, hath more power then any other. I believe, the Englifh made this attempt, upon fuppofition that theMoghol hath great need of the Sea, and that to the end his Ships might have tree paflkge therein, without being molefted by the Englilh, he would fuffer what they pleas'd. But herein, in my opinion, they are grofly miftaken ^ becaufe the Moghol is a very great and wealthy King, Whofe Revenews arife from his own Lands,and not from the Sea^'and to whom that little ;which is to be had from the Sea, (how great foever it may be) is no thing, and nothing he accounts it 5 bccaufe it accrues rather to fome fmall Captain of his, as the Governour of Surat, and the like, then to the Ring himfelf; So that. What is he concernd for it ? But indeed he Will be concern'd for fuch an injury done to him in his own jurifdi&amp;ion, as the Englilh have done by making reprifal of Ships, which Princes much inferior to the Moghol woukj. not havefuffer'd from any admitted as Friends into their Coimtries. Befides, the grievances alledg'd by the Englifti were but pretences, and the Moghofa Miniftershad their Reafons for them 5 wherefore the cafe ought to have been heard before falling to violence 5 and let the matter be how it will, 'twas juft for him to be Judge in his own Country, and that this refpeft (hould be (hewn him 5 if the Englifh would have taken this courfe^ if not, or if he would not do them Juft ice, they were alwayes at liberty to go out of his powetland fo make Warr againft him by Sea upon better terms. Concerning the Affairs of the Moghol with his Son, they faid that Sultan Chorrim having been twice routed, was atlaft retreated with fome few followers into the Dominions of Cutab-Scihh ^ and that his Father had given over purfuing him, and being retir 5 d to his own Court, left him there in quiet 5 that Cntab-Scikh did not afiift him out of awe to the Father, nor yet drive him out of his Territories out of re- fped to himfelf, but let him enjoy the polleflionof a certain fmall circuit in his Country to which he had retii'd. Concerning Perfian affairs, we heard a while fince, and it was verifi'djthat not only the Englilh Ships were gone thither ac cording to their cuftom for the Trade of Silk, butalfo thofe of the Hollanders which come to Surkt 5 perhaps becaufe lenders' TT'/- ■ A • : -,v- -^1 m Into the EAST-INDIE S. to are minded to fet up a Traffick thither too, aslunder- ftood from a good hand laft year at Surht, In the mean time other Ships and Galeons are preparing at Coa to be fent Ayrilxhz tenth;, Three Galeons fraighted with Vidual de parted from Goa to Rny Freira for the war of Ormii 'L^ as two other Ships had done a few days before befides the above-men- tion'd ten^and order was given for three other Galeons to go from Mozambique with people fufficient to arm all the fix 5 becaufe the former three of Goa carri'd no Soldiers but only Sea-men. They carri'd alfo from Goa a Petard,, wherewith they faid they in tended to attempt the little falfe Gate of Ormtiz, which ftands to^ wards the Sea ^ and feveral other preparations of War. On the twenty ninth of the lame month., being the day of S. Tietro Martire^ who, they fay^ was the Founder of the Inquijiti- on againft Hereticks, the Inquifitors of Goa made a Solemnity before their Houfe of the Inquifition which is in the Piazza of the Cathedral, and was fometimes the Palace of Sahaio Prince of Goa when the Vortugals took it, whence it is (till call'd la Pi- a&amp;za di Sahaio. After folemn Mafs had been fung in the Church of San Dominico^ as Vefpers had been the day before, in pre- (enceof the Inquifitors, who coming to fetch the Fryers in Pro- ceflion, repair'd thereunto Vontijicalikus ^ in the evening ma ny carreers were run on horf-back by the Vortugal-Gemvy^ invi ted purpofely by the Inquifitors ^ and a day or two after Cfor this Evening was not fufficient for fo many thingsj there was in the fame Piazza a Hunting or Baiting of Bulls after the Spanifh fafhion^ but the Beafls being tame and fpiritlefs afforded little fport 5 fo that I had not the cui iofity to be prefent at it. This is anew F^ftival lately inftituted by the prefent Inquilitors, who, I believe, will continue it yearly hereafter. May the tenth, a Packet-boaHrom Mafcat arriv'd at with Letters dated Afril the twenty fourth , confirming what had fome dayes before been rumor , d,that the King of Ferfia had taken Baghdad^ and the Ferfians were about to go againft BaJJork by Sea, but were diverted from their defign by the Portugal Fleet which they hear^l was preparing to fuccour that City 5 befides fome Ships of theirs which they continually keep there in favour of the 7urks againft the to guard the Mouth of the Ri ver, which is Euphrates and Tigris joyn'd together. The fame Boat brought news alfo that twelve Ships were already departed from Mafcat under the conduft of my friend Sig. Michele Perei- rd to begin a new Siege of , and thatK^ waited for the Galeons that he might go thither too with, the greater Fleet. If it be true, that Sciah-Ahhashz's taken Baghdad^ I am confident that at the long run BaJJora will fall into his hands too: if the Portugals may hinder him by fea, they cannot by land ^ and'tis a clear cafe, that if he hath he intends alfo to have the port of Bajjora, which is of great importance. That Ee 2 he C- IJL / 1212 The travels Peter Delia Valle, mi /■ V // he ha s taken Baghdad may very well be true, during the pre- fent ill State of the Turkifti Affairs, after the late tu mults in that Court, and the death of Sultan Snkiman who was lately mur- der'd and his formerly depos'd Uncle Sultan Mufiafk reftor'd to the Empire;, as I was lately affur'd hereby zn Armenian who told me that he was atConJiantinoplein the time ofthefe Revolu tions 5 and that Sultan Mujiafa was very loth tore-afiume the Government by reafonof the ill deportment of the Minifters 5 and that he would have no more Women or Concubines, but had married and difmifs'd all that were in the Seraglio, that, if any woman came into his prefence, he ran at her with his Ponyard, profeffing to lead a cbaftand religious life, not meaning to have other Succeflbrs then his Brothers two Sons, the elder of which is Sultan Mahomad Son of Sultana Kiofme^ who, I alwayes be- liev'd, would by his Mother's Arts one day come to rule, and now without doubt, whether fhe be living or not, f if the above- faid relations be true) will at leaft reign after his Uncle Afujiafa, Now forafmuch as in thefe violent mutations of Empire^ the Government alwayes fuffers deterioration , becaufe with out fome evil difpofition of the Government fuch violen ces in Royal Families cannot a rife 5 therefore, I (ay, perhaps this ill pofture of affairs hath afforded the Scuh occafions making himfelf Matter of Baghdad ^ efpecially if the Ty rant Bechir Subafct^ who had in a manner ufurp'd it to him felf, have given it into his power 5 (which is an eafie thing even in the good State of the lurkjfo Aff airs) being perhaps afraid of Sultan who,they lay, is very prudent and wholly intent to reform the Diforders of the Empire without caring to attend forreign enterprifes^whence perhaps having an eye too up on the Diforders of Baghdad^he was about to raife a fbong Army for removing the faid Tyrant, who by this means became ne- cellitated to yield it to the Sdah, Neverthclefs in thefe matters I have fome doubt, becaufethe fame Armenian told me, that Sul-* tan Mufiafa had made peace with the Terfian for twenty years^and / if the taking of Baghdad be true, it is a breaking of the peace i // which amongft theMoors,and confideringthe Cuftoms'of Scuh Abbas is not impoffible. At prefent I fufpend my belief, and defire to have more certain and particular informations of thefe matters, of which in Goa there is little plenty, I V. By the fame Veflel came a Letter from Sig.Uicolao de Silva Ve- odor da Jazenda, or Treafurer at Mafcat^ to one of the Inquiiitors, wherein he fignifi'd to him that he underftood by the Letters of the French Conful at AleppOythat at Rome Gregory X V. was dead, and a new Pope already chofen, Card. MaJJeo Barberint } about fifty four years old, who had affumed the name of Vrban VIIL The fame Letter further advertis'd that in the Marriage between the Prince of England^ and the Infanta was celebrated upon the day of our Ladie's Nativity in Septembers and that the Infante Don Carlo was to accompany her into England, and from1 Into the EAST-INDIES. 2 T 3 from thence pafs to his Government of Flanders 5 that in England the Catholicks had publick Churches open, and enjoy d Liberty of Confcience : That in Italy the bulinefs of the Valtolin had been referr*d to his Holinefsj but Pope Gregory dy'd without determining it: That the King of Spain kept a great Army rea dy in Milan about it 5 and that a League was made againft him in Italy by other Princes 5 that Tome faid Don Carlo of Spain was to marry the Heirefs of Lorrain^ and other like news^ which being of things either uncertain or futurej makefmall ac^ count of, till I fee the iffue. May the feventeenth 3 By a Merchants Ship from Bajfora, we had more certain intelligence by Lnigi Medices^ of Ramiro the Venetian Conful at Aleppo, that Pope Gregory X y. dy'd on the twenty ninth of July 1625. having been (ickonly five dayes. The Relation of the Conclave faith that the Pope dy'd on the eight of Jntyy the Cardinals enter'd into the Conclave on the nineteenth;, and that on the fixth of Angufl Urban VIII. was created Pope. That Card. Montato dy'd a little before the Pope 5 and Card.

May the nineteenth. One Ventura da Cojia, a Native of Canara was married. He was a domeftick fervant to Sig: Alvaroda, \ Cofia, aPrieftand ourFriend, Lord of a Village nearG^^ for whofe fake, who was willing to honour his fervant's wedding in his ownHoufe, I andfome other Friends went thither to ac company the Bride and the Bride-groom to the Church of San BlagiO) a little diftant in another Village, which was the Parifh of the Bride, where the Ceremonies were perform'd in the Even ing for coolnefs fake. The Company was very numerous, con- fifting of many Gentlemen, fuch, perhaps, as few other Canarini have had at their Marriages. The Spoufes came under Umbrella's of Silk garnifti'd with filver, 8c in other particulars the Ceremonies were according to the cuftom of the Portugals $ one- ly I obferv'd , that according to the ufe of the Country, in the Company before the Married Perfons, there march'd a party of fourteen or (ixteen men odly cloth'd after the Indian faQiion, to wit, naked from the girdle upward, and their Bodies painted in works with white Sanders, and adorn'd with bracelets and neck laces of Gold and Silver, and alfo with flowers and turbants upon their heads, in feveral gallant fafhions and ftreamers of fc- veral colours hanging behind them: From the girdle downwards, over the hofe which thefe Canarini ufe to wear fhort like ours, ♦ they had vanoully colour'd clothes girt about them with ftream- ers, or flying laps, hanging down a little below the knee 5 the reft ofthe leg was naked, faving that they had fandalson their feet. Tl^ele fine fellows danc'd all the way both going and re turning, accompanying their dances with chaunting many Ver- fes in their own Language, and beating the little fnappers which they carry'd in their hands, after the fafliion of the Country, formerly taken notice of at ikkert. And indeed the dances of thefe Canarini are pleafant enough^ fo that in the Feftivities made at Goa for the Canonization of the Saints Ignatio and Scix- vier^ though in other things they weremoft fbleinn and fumptu- ous 5 yet, in my conceit, there was nothing more worthy to be feen for delight, then the many pretty and jovial dances which interven'd in the Tragedy. The Marry'd Couple being return'd from Church to the Bride's Houfe, we were entertaind with a- handfome Collation of Sweet-meats in the yard, which was wholly cover'd over with a Tent, and adorn'd with Trees and green boughs, the Company fitting round, and the Marry'd Couple on one fide at the upper end upon a great Carpet under a Canopy. After which we all return'd home, and the Hufband ftay'd that night to fleep in his Wife's Houfe.

We had no wind in the night, and there fore went not out of the Port. December the feventeenth. In the morning we fet out of the Port with a fmall gale, and at the fame time three or four other Ships fet forth for leveral parts. We had not fail d far, but we ddcry'd fome Veflels coming towards us, which we took for Firats, and therefore prepar'd to fight them 5 but at length we loO: fight of them, and hois'd the great fail, diredingour couiie almottThe Travels Peter Delia Valle, almoft Nortbweft ^ having firfV rehears'd the Litanies of our La- dy 3 and invok'd the Divine Affifl:ance 5 and her'Sj propitious to our Voyage.

Here the wind fail'd us, and we had as quiet a Sea as ufes to be at the ftiores of Italy in the Month of Augufi. We began to find the Sky 3 which hitherto we had feen conftantly cleatj ('as it ufes to be in India during thefe Months) now inter- ftinguifh 'd with clouds: and 5 in fbort 5 the mutation of the Climate was manifeft. The Coaft of Arabia^ for which we were bound, could not be far off 5 but we could not get to difcover it for want of wind. December the twenty feventh.

A barbarous Su- perftition indeed 5 but yet fuch asfometimes, through the faith and fimplicity of thofe that pradife it, ufes to be heard. December the twenty eighth. We had a wind fufiiciently brisk and impetuous, yet not only not favourable but altogether con trary 5 lo that we could neither bear up againft it, nor yet cafi: anchor becaufe we were in the main Sea, which growing rough and tempeftuous, we were forc't to furl our fails, and fuffer the ^nip to be driven whither the wind pleas'd, which was South wards, not without fear falling upon Mombaza, or fome other remote Coaft of Africk^ and confequently fuffering fhipwrack, andathoufandotherDyfafters.

A little before mid-night we difcover'd the Coaft of A- r 10 neer that we caft anchor in hafte for fear of the Shallows whichinto the EAST-INDIES. which are thereabouts. In the morning we faw the Land naked both of Trees and Grafs, but rather ftony in appearance and Dc- fart, although it was part of that which they call Happy. December the thirtieth. We began to move forward Eaft Strnth-Eafl:, having the Land on the left hand ^ but a fudden contrary wind arifing forest us to caft anchor again in the place where we were, not without dangers for in the furling of the fail, through the negligence of the Sea-men, h wrapt about the Maft, the wind blowing very furioufly againfi: the fore-deck i fo that had the Veflel been lefs found and ftrong-fided,or fome of the PaiTengers lefs diligent to help, it had been overturn'd and funk, like the Ship of Orontes in the (hipwrack of Mneas^ which Virgil defcribes tohave been loft by the like cafualty. At night, the contrary wind ceafing, we proceeded in our intended courfe, December the one and thirtieth. The wind failing, we caft an chor, but jn an unfecure place, not without danger of being fplit upon the Chore, whither in fpight of our anchors the wind hurri'd us, but tacking about, we got to a more fecure place, near that from whence we had mov'd the day before. On the fir ft of January, and of the year 1625, We ftood at VI I, anchor till night, and then made a little progrefs 5 but all the next day we ftood at anchor again, and took very good fiflijand at night a little wind blowing from the Land, we went forwards now and then, but very little. January the eighth, Having all the preceding days been about theCoaftof Arabia, cafting anchor every day, and weighing again at night 5 (during which, a Boat of Arabians brought us much frefh fifl], and an Arabian came fwimming to us a great way only to beg a little Rice and Bifket, which we gave him) at length having a good wind this day after noon, we pafs'd a Cape which they call Capo falfo, becaufe 'tis neer and refcmbles the Cape Rafelhhad, but is not it. At night we palled by the True Cape call'd by the Arabians Rafelhhad, that is, the Cape of the Confine, becaufe'tis the laft and moft Southern Cape of Arabia, being, as they fay,in the latitude of twenty two degrees and a halt from the iEquinodial Northwards, and diftant from Majcat ? whither we were going, forty leagues^ the call it cor ruptly Capo cli Rofalgate. Having pafs'd this Cape, we fteer'd Northweft, ftill upon thecoaft ot Arabia which lies all the way on the left hand, and enter'd the Perfian Gulph, but faw not the oppofite Continent of Perfia^e^ufQ foragood way inwards the Gulph is very broad. January thefeventh. Having in the night foregoing had a good Wind, by day -light we were got eighteen leagues beyond the Cape, near the place where the City of C a!at at, which Al- huquerque deftroy'd, fometimes ftood, upon a good River, at the foot of certain little Mountains, of which almoft the whole coaft conllfts. Here the wind fail'd us, and having labour d with theoar ail day, we got no further ihenTeive, a place inhabited by2 The Travels of Peter Delia Valle, by Arabians, At night we were troubled with rairi;, which paf- fing through all covers, wetted us fufficiently, and kept us from fleeping. The next day we hois'd fail;, and had fcarce dry'd our Clothes, but more rain furpriz'd us 5 and through want of wind all the day, we did not get fo far as which lyes eight Leagues forward, and twelve fhort of Mafcat. On the eleventh of the fame Moneth, having no wind, we made ufe of Oars, till we came to an Anchor a little beyond Curiat 5 and the next day hoiiing fail, we pafs'd by an Ifland call 'd Scoglio di Curiat, failing through a narrow arm of the Sea which divides it from the Continent, which is all ftony and full of Cliffs, like the fair Mountain Pojilippo near Naples in Italy. Before night we caft Anchor a little beyond 5 for our Oars helpt the Ship but little ^ being only ferviceable to fuch heavy Veflels tofui' pafsa Cap6, or get into a Port, or the like, in cafe of need for a (hort way. At night we weigh'd Anchor, and fbon afterwards caft it again, having made but little way. January the thirteenth. Having fail'd all day, and pafs'd the Tropick of Cancer, we enter'd the Northern Temperate Region, and towards night arriv'd at the Port of Mafcat, which is well clos'd and encompafs'd about with little Mountains, but lyes open to the North-weft, whereby it receives much dammage. The Town, whereof the leaftpart are wall'd Houfes, and the greateft onelyfheds made of Palm-boughs, ftands direftlyin the innermoft recefs of the Port, furrounded behind with Moun tains 5 amongft which, neverthelefs, there want not wayes of accefs to it from the in-land parts 5 fo that 3 to fecure their Houfes from the incurfions of the Arabians, they had in my time begun to raife an earthern wall, but plain and weak, with a few Bafti- ons, very diftant one from another 5 which wall, drawn from Mountain to Mountain, inclofes and (ecures their Houfes on that fide, as the Sea doth on the oppofite and inacceffible little Moun tains on the two other fides. On the top of one of thefe Moun tains, on the right hand as you enter the Port, ftands the Caftle, difficult indeed to be taken by aflault or otherwife then by Fa mine, if well defended ; (or though the wall be not very ftrong, yet the natural fituation fecures it, and it hath a Plat-form le- velldto the Sea, whereby it defends the Port with Artillery, and is defcended to from the Caftle by a cover'd Ladder, which is very good. On the other fide of the Port, upon another Mountain ftands another Port of left confideraiion, having been ar.ciently the Caftle 5 yet it hath Artillery, and may be of (bme advantage. The Town is fmall, but for its bignels fufficiently peopled, efpecially (ince the lofs of Or/w/s, from whence many repair hither. The people ismix'dof Portugals, Arabians, In- dians, Gentiles, and Jews, It hath onely two Churches 5 one which is the See of the Vicar, who is no Prieftbut an Auguftine Fryer 5 one of their Covent, alwayes coming to officiate there, and to difcharge the place of Vicar and Parifh-Prieft .* the other . isInto the EAST-INDIES. ciatc^ is of Auguftine Fryers 3 where live about'four of that Order;, and both are dedicated toourLadyj with feveral Titles 5 to wit ? that of the Fryers Delia Gratia ^ and the other 3 DelKofario. The Captain lives not always in the Caftlc by reafon of the incon venience of its fituation-j but oncly during the hotter monthes of Summer for coolneis^ for upon the lower ground the heat is infupportable 5 both becaufe the Climate is of it felf hot 3 and becaufe the dwellings lie in a low and inclos d place, encompaf- fed;, as I faid 5 with Mountains 3 whichkeepofi'allwind, and re verberate the Sun more ftrongly ^ befides that, the Soil is dry andfaltifh, which confequcntly increafes the heat. The Cap tain whom I found there., was call d Sig: Martino Alfonjb ae Melo. I alfo found dwelling here a Nephew, or Brothers Son of the aj Captive King of Ormuz,, whofe Father was alto Ring of the '■ fame place before this Brother of his, who is dt this day prifoner in Perfta. This Nephew, they told me, was call'd after his Uncle's Name Muhhamed-Sciah 5 and the P^«g4/s make him be acknowledged Prince in Arabia by all the Arabians that were lately fubjed to the King of Ormut, and are now exempt from the oppreffion of thePerfianf or Rebellion, as neareft Rinfman and lawfulleft Heir(ofany now at liberty)to the imprifon'd King. At the fame time of our Arrival, there was alfo at Mafcat upon his journey Hhabefe-ChaH ^ Ambaflador of the King of Dacan^ Nizam-Sciah) who was returning to his Mafter from Verfia^hexe he had been many years,with Sciah-Abbas. It being night when we arriv'd at Mafcat^ we went not afhore 5 onely the Captain of the Ship was fent for by the Governour to (peak with him^ and give him account of his purpofes. # Remaining in the Ship this night, and for tny Recreation ob- ferving the Stars a little before day, I beheld (as I had at other times in India) the Aujiral Crofi 0 which the Spaniards call Crncero, and is the nearefi: vifible Conftellation to the Southern Pole, fer- ving in the other Hemifphere as the Pole-Star of the North in ours 5 fo that this Crofsis dilcerned even in the parallel 01 Mafcat) which is inthe Elevation ofa^ derees 36 / . 7^. Indeed it appears low, but a little above the Horizon.^ I noted here that in thefe Indian Seas this Crofs is feen at the time above-faid, (^to wit, a little before day, very eredt? for it rifes late in the night, and at firfl: appears a^thwart, till the Heaven wheeling about with a fhort circle, a little before day it appears in its *• cred Figure, which is of this form, * ^ * confifting of 4 ftars difpos'd in this manner, three of which are greater and more luminous, and one, to wit, that of the Weftern arm, is lefs and moreobfeure when the Crofs iseredt.

Accordingly we ftay'd, and by the help of Oafs it prefently made towards us. Wherein I obferv'd the little Military Dilcipline r and good or der pra&amp;is'd by the Portngals in India 5 for there was all the reafon in the world, that, if we (tey'd the coming up of this Ship, according to the icuftom, yet we ftiould not have trufted it till we knew what it was 5 tor it might have been an Enemy or t Rover, as there are many in thefe Seas, who being Portngals by Nation, and baniQi'd for fome mifdemeanbrsi, betake themlelves to carry Pepper, Arms, and other prohibited things to the Territories of the Moors. Wherefore to /ecure our felves from all deceit and dammage, which fuch a Ship feigning to be of Frezr^'s Armada might have done us, wefhould have ftay'd k- deed, but it ought to have been with our Arms in our Hands, Falcons, Corchabufes, and Mufltets loaden 5 and,in{hort 5 in a pofture of defence and fighting, as occafion requir'd.

Having pafs'd by this Cape, (which is 5 as I believe wilhin ten or twelve leagues of Ormn% ) leaving Ormuz and Bender di Komhraon the right hsrnd, (becaufe weprefum'd the Dutch and Englifh Ships to be there) we direded our courfe towards Larek^ hoping to find Rny Freira there 3 as we had underftood by the way 5 but a little after, we defcry'd two Ships of Ruy Freiras Ar mada ('as we fuppos'd) in two feveral places towards the Land 5 each of which gave us a Gun 5 whereby we apprehended that they intended either to receive or give us fome neceffary Ad- vertifement. Wherefore quitting our courfe to Lare^ we turn'd theSternto the coaft of Arabia^ towards which one ofthefaid Ships about Sun-fet feem to be retir'd. We approach't near the Land about Evening, and palling amidft certain Rocks,went to cafl: anchor within a little bay which was there 5 but in the narrow ftreight between a Rock and the Continent, a moft im petuous current of the Sea hurri'd us away fo furioufly, that without giving us time to let down the fail, it had almoft daih't us againft the foot of certain high Rocks, where, if we had touch't, without doubt our Ship had been fplit in a thoufand pieces, nor had any one of us efcap t with life unlefs by miracle: neverthelefsby plying our Oars ftoutly, and at length letting down the fail, by Gods mercy we were delivered from this im minent and manifeft danger. Yet not fo fully, but that we had like to have been caft upon another Rock, not fomuch through the violence of the Current, as the negligence of the Sea -men who did not govern the Sails and Helm well. But at length be- ing by the Divine Adiftance freed from both dangers, we got to the place we defign'd, and there found one of Ruy Freira s Ships which had given us a Warning-piece in the preceding day 5 and alfo an armed Bark of that fort which they call Terrankim, and are almoft fuch as our Caichi or Shallops 5 which Bark Kuy treira fent to the Rock Baba S el am there to wait for the Armada of Goa^ and advertife him when it arriv'd. In the Ship was Sig. Sancho di Toar, who the laft year had been fent from Goa Gene ral ot certain Ships to adift Ruy Freira^ and being weary of the war, now with his licence (obtained, as may be though^ by importunity) was returning to and fo to Goa, with fe- venty or eighty foldiers that accompani'd him. After we jiad calt anehor, although it was very dark, yet fome of the faid o iers, and the Captain of the Terranquim c&amp;mexo our Ship to Ipeak with Don Francefco Cavacio 5 foallb did the Captain ot the r ^ a bo v efaid di Toar, next morning. Don Francefio dif- waded the foldiers from deferring the war in a time of lb great need, and otfo fair anoccafion as would be at the coming of the Armada of Goa, which was approaching hourly 5 telling them iriat at0^4 it would beheld an adtion little honourable, and that the Vice-Roy would feverely punifti whoever return'd rmther abandoning Ruy Freira : In (hort, he faid fo much to nem,* that being aflur'd of the coming of the Fleet of Goa y (whichInto the EAST-INDIES. which before they disbeliev'd and accounted only a report to keep the foldiers in fufpence) almoft all of them changed thehr purpolej and refolv'd to continue at the war, after they had been at only to provide themfelves (bme neceffaries. Of fuch moment to the publick good is the authority and prudent dif- courfe of a worthy perfon amongft people. We had news from them, that Ruy Freira had quitted Lare^ becaufe the Englifh at the inftance of the Perfians had gone thither with their Ships to drive him thence, whereupon having firft deftroy'd certain Shops of Provifionp which he had made there for convenience of the foldiersand a weak Trench he remov'd with his Ar mada of Oars to a defart ftation of Arabia a little beyond the place where we were^ and there we fhould find him 5 that if we had gone to Lare^ we fhould have incurr'd the danger of fal ling into the enemies hands ^ and therefore;, as foon as they faw us 5 they (hot off a Warning-piece to recall us from that bad way. They told us moreover., that before the Tortugals were driven from Lare^ Frem? going one day with the greateft part of his Ships to make an appearance about Ormn%^ a great Tempeft arofe 3 by which four Ships which he left at Larek^, were driven upon the Rocks of the Ifland, and loft 5 with the death of many people 5 and that it was a great mercy of God that Ruy Freira was not there with his other Ships, becaufe they would have been all loft, although they wanted not a ftiare of trouble too by the tempeft in the place where they were* Hence I concluded that misfortunes every day increas'd upon'the Portugals in India^ fb that I know not what good judgment can be made of their affairs for the future. the eighth, in the morning. We departed from the place where we were, and coafting along in le(s then an hour, we arriv'd at a little Iffend which they call delle Capre or delle Ga- zelle^ near the Continent of Arabia^ almoft within a Bay which affords an ample and fecure Port for fmall Veflels. This place lies almoft diredly overagainft Ormu^ (bthat Ormuz, will come to be fixty leagues diftant from Mafcat, and confequently eighteen from Lima, Here we found Rny Freira with part of his Ships, of which fome were mending 3 I fay.

Aflbon as we had caft anchor, Ruy Freira czv&amp;S in perfon to our Ship acompani'd by lome of his Captains, and ftay'd there between two and three hours receiving and diftribu- ting amongft them certain fmall provifions of Vi&amp;ual and Arms which were brought himjreading the Viceroy'sLetters and many other which came to him from Goa, and difcourfing with Don Francefco Contigno Cavacio^ and others 3 giving them account ot all his fucceiies, and inquiring concerning the Armada and other things which we knew. And becaufe we aflur'd him,the Armada could2^0 T^be Travels Peter Delia Valle, could not be long before it arriv'd, (ince we came all together from Ciaul at the fame time, he lent forth another Ship to meet it, with order to inform them where he was, and prefently to re turn and advertife him of his arrival;, that he might go out and joyn with it. I could not be prefcnt at all the Converfation, be- caufc T had my Ague and was in bed. Yet upon his coming, I arole and drefs'd my felf to wait upon him, as 1 did fo long as I was able ^ but at length I was forc'd to retire, and onlyreturnM to iake leave of him when he departed. He made many com plements to me, telling me that he had long fince had knowledg of my perfon by fame, and (hould always be ready to ferve me upon any occafion 5 with other like Civilities. I offer'd him to (hew him the Pafs I had from the Viceroy, becaufe 1 had heard him fay indifcourfe how ftridly the Viceroy had charg'dhimnot to let any one pafs into the Terrifories of the Turks without his licence 5 but he would not look upon it, and told me it needed not for me, re-iterating that he was ready to ferve me 5 to which civillanguage I anfwer'd in the beft terms I could, fignifying to him how great a while I had been defirous to fee his perfon 3 and to ferve him&gt; The fame of his adions teftifi'd to me by the mouths of his very enemies, and how he was ipoken of at Got both by the Viceroy and all others 5 all which he receiv'd as kindly as I did his obliging expreffions. At length he return'd to his own Ship, taking with h\m Don Francefco ContignoCavdccio^ the. F. Provincial of Maniglia^ and divers others, to be enter- tain'd there with him all the day 5 but I remain'd in bed with my Ague. yj the ninth, Having taken a Terfian Pilot which Ruy Freira gave us, (becaufe the Portugal Pilots are not very fkilful in the Perjian Gulph, by reafon of the multitude of (helves, and theinconftancy of the winds, which make it needful to have a Pilot of the Country) at night we put off from the abovefaid Ifland fteering our courfe outwards. Almoft: at the fame time Ruy Freira went with lome of his Ships, leaving order for the reft to follow him as foon as they (bould be rcpnir'd 3 and by the in ner way, to wit, by the channel between the Ifland and the Continent, went I know not whereto take in water, intending - afterwards to fee how matters were at Ormii%., where there rode ten Ships ot War, Dutch znA Engljjh, partly under the Caftle, and partly in Bender di Kontbru, having already put v^at relief they pleas'd into the place.

But neither did the Ship ftay to fell anything, nor the Religious think good [to land in that place, for all thofe promifes. . , . , . ' February the two arid twentieth. Being at Anchor in a certain place,, at ni^ht we defcry'd Tome Veffels afar off 3 which we knew not what they were ^ arid therefore weighing Anchor^ and put- ting our felves in a pofture for fight, we row'd up to them. When we came near, we found them to be of thotc Pcrji.if! Vtl- / fels, which they call Terr at s, (a kind of great bark, frequent in thefe Seas) laden with Dates and Viftuals. Yet becaufe they neither ftay'd for us nor obey'd, we difchafg d fome Falcons and many Mulkets at them, without doing any hurt , becaufe of thofe that (hot none knew how to do it as they ought, but aU was done with great confufion and diforder, as is ufual amonglt thePortueals, efpecially in our Ship, which was a Merchant and not a Man of War. So that the Pe went away un- touch'd, and we not onelytook them not, as we mightealuy have done , had our Ships been well arm'd and well-govern d 5 but it feem'd alfo, that, had thofe Veflels had armed people, and a mind to aflault us, they might eafily have taken us confider- ne the little order and preparation for fight that Ifaw inour Sk li Fekwr/&lt;2^2 The Travels of Peter Delia Valle, February the feven and twentieth.

This fuperftitious Ceremony, not unlike that above-mention'd of therortugals binding S.Anthony oftadna^ was willing to infert for its ftrangenefs * although through the ignorance of the Mariners \ themfelves, who could give no other reafon for it but that the cuftom was (b 5 or t^ecaufe they would not tell us 5 I could not under ftand what Old Man it was that they beatt, under the figure of a bundle of Clothes, or from whom they demanded a good wind. Febrnary the eight and twentieth, We were minded to take in water in the Country of Verdifian fa part of Per/^), of which we had great need 5 but the people of the place prohibited us repelling the boat from the (hore with many Mufket-ftiots. And being ^we had notSouldiers to land and take water by force, it behov'd us to have patience and depart without. Mtrch the fir ft.

They tpeak the Perftan Language, and indeed are Vaflals of Perfta, though by realbn of their poverty they pay no Tribute to the Perftam. They told me, that they are govern d by a Chief, called, according the cuftom of the Arabians&gt; Sceich, which dig nity defbends from Father to Son 5 that in the war between the / 7 / Per flans ztiAthzPortngaU, the former had intended to have built / / /y/ a Fort here, w hereby to hinder the Portugal Ships from watering 4 hcre a&gt; tliey palTedby -, but the Inhabitants excufed themfelves from it in th'. u poverty,and by treating all parties alike friendly^ thev have efeaped unmolefted by any, and enjoy their fweet Liberty up6n no other account but their poverty.

At night we return d aboard, having exchanged the Pilot, which Rhji Freira gave us for one of Charg, it being the cuftom fo to do. It rained in the night, and the Sea grew high 5 wherefore for more le- curity, we put off from the land further to Sea.

The next day we failed a little, but moft of the day lay at Anchor, becaufe the Pilots could not find the mouth of the River of Bajfora, although it feem 'd to us to be very near; and indeed, 'tis no eafie matter to find it, the Ihore being ib low that it is not difcerned,unlefs very near hand approach fonear the (hore as to difcern the River, is not late by reafon of the (hallows. , ■' -j, . .

The River of Bajjora (which is Euphrates and Tygris joyned together^) is^call'd by the Arabians Sciat cl Arab) that is, the Arabian River&gt; and falls into the Sea with two great Mouths about twelve Leagues diftant one from the other.

And becaufe the divifion of the River into two Branches happens within the land a little below Bajfora, I know not how many leagues from the Sea^ hence it forms a nofmallTriangulct Hand, called at this day Cheder 5 which I hold to be the gift of the River (like the Delta of Egypt) and that it will increafc eve ryday by the fand brought down by the River, confidering the many flats and (hallows, which asl faid above are found in thefe places* Now we being entred by the Eaftern mouth, and having failed a good way againft the ftream, at length came to the place of thedivifion^and leaving the.more Wefterly branch on the left hand, continued our courfe am^iagft the. verdures of Date -trees and cultivated Fields, which on both fides the River down to the Sea are very fertile. At length we came to the place from whence up to the City of Baffora^ (which lies on the weft bank a good way from the River J is drawn an artificial Dike capable even of Portugal Galliots,which pafs up to the Dogana or Cuftom- houfe, where a bridg- of planks laid upon boats, and fortified with Iron chains crolieth the Dike 5 on the South-part of which bridg ftands a Caftle, and ftrong Bulwark for guard of the City and paiiage. The water of this trench ebbs and flows with the Sea, and at high Tide runs up I known not how far beyond the bridg ^ yet Ships go no farther then the bridg, where they ride as in a fecure Haven. From this trench are derived fome other little channels on eitherfide to feveral places of the City 5 and in fome of them they make ufe of fmall Boats, which they call Do- nee, with great convenience to the houfes 5 befides that they want not little bridges upon the faid channels to walk over on foot. - . .

Before the Caftle is an in different large Piazza, where there are (bme great Pieces of Oidnance, amongft which we law certain Portugal Pieces which had been taken many years ago by the Turks of Bapora from ■ ' 1 . i'7Into the EAST-IN DIES. 245 cat when they infefted the leas with their Galleys^ which after wards were deftroy'd by the Portugals, Another Piazza there is before the Bafha's Houfe, which is always full of heaps of Corn^ Rice, and other Fruits, which are to be fold here 5 being kept night and day without other (hops or inclofure then ordinary mats, without fear of ftealing in regard of the ftridt juftice exer- cis'd by the Turks in matter of Theft. The people are Arabians with (bme Turks intermixed, fb that the Arabian Language is moft fpoken, although the 7'urkijh and Perjian are not unfre- quenr. As for Religion, the-Mwr/are partly and part ly Scinai's, with Liberty of Confcience to both 5 yet in the Mefchitas the Service is after the. manner of the Sonai's, and al- fo all publick Ceremonies are perform'd after the Rite of the^c- nats, which is that which the Great Tur^ who is King of this Country, ohtexvzszt Conflantinoyle. There are alfo lome Hou- fes of Chaldean Chriftians, call'd Chriftians of S. or Sabe-* ans'^ though I believe they have little more befides the name of Chriftians? for they have no Church except the Houfe of one (ingle Prieft, who was there in my time, and he a very Idiot 3 nor could I learn that they ever aflembled there to be prefent at any Divine Service. They have no Faft or abftinence from Flefti, but eat every day alike. Nor have they any Sacraments, ex cept fome Ihadow of them 3 and 'tis a queftion whether their Baptifm be fuch as it ought to be, and not rather the Baptifm of S. John then of Chrift. Andbecaufeinthis, and many other things,they obferve S. John Baptiji more then any other,and have himingreateft Veneration, therefore they are call'd Chriftians of S. John^whh no fmall fufpition of being the remainder of thofe Jews whom S. John baptiz d with the Baptifm of Repentance, and who, without caring for any thing elfe, have continu'd in that Rite ever fince. The Gofpels, and other facred Books, *tis not known (at leaft) in Bajfora, that they have or ufe &gt; but they have a Book which they call Sidra, according whereunto they govern themfelves in matters of Religion 3 but who is the Au thor of it, I know not. They (peak aharfh Chaldee, befides A- rabick. which is generally in ufe 5 which Language of theirs they call Mendai^ asalfo for the moft part amongft themfelyes they areftyl'd Mendai, befides the two other names of Chriftians of S. John and Sabeans, by the firft of which they are known to us Europeans, and by the latter to the Moors. What Mendai fig- nifies, and whence it is deriv'd, I could not learn.

So that in my time the faid Fathers lived in an hired houfe, which the Bajha paid fc/i^yet ihey had a Church,or rather an Oratory t here, wherein Mais, and all Divine Offices were publickly cele brated.

In the morning his Wife in perfon went about feeking a Houfe for us 5 and at night I ac* companied her to fee one adjoyning to her own, which for that reafon, and becaufe it was fomewhat better then the reft, al though far from good, I made choice of, and (be promis'd to get it prepar'd for me againft the next day , whereupon I return'd aboard this night alfo. This day Proclamation was made in Baf fora for every houfe to fend out a man with Arms to the camp to aid the Balha in the War againft the Perjians^ who were faid to approach. March the fourteenth, I took pofieflion of the Houfe pre paid for me, and afterwards vifited Sig.

The people of Hhaveiza in the mean time agreed with the Chan, and receiv'd Mubhamed for their Prince, being ready to obey the Chan in this, and what-ever elfe he (hould command ^ yet upon condition that no gizilbafci fhould enter intoHte/e- whereunto the Chan allented. Concerning Occurrences fince our arrival at , News came that the Chan, after he had eftablifhed Muhhamed in Hhaveiza^ was advanced forwards with his Army towards BaJJora^ and was already enterd into the State by a place which they call Qarna^ intending, perhaps., to take certain Garrifons in thofe borders, and alfo to make fur ther progrefs: Whereupon the Bafha went out againft him with all his Forces, and three of the live P^/z^/Ships, which, as I faid, he kept in Pay ^ the City oftiajfora in the mean while being in greiat fear of the Per [tan Army. As for other things more particularly pertaining to the State of this City , he told me, that after the taking of Ormnfy the Sciah fent an Embaflage to the then Bafha of Baffora Efiajiab, to # tell him, that he requir'd no more from Bajjbra but onely to have his Coyn ftamp'd there, his Name us'din the Acclamations of the People, and in the Prayers of the Mefchitas^ as King of the Country, inftead of that of the Great Turk 5 and that the People of Baffora (hould wear their Turbants after the manner 5 that as for the reft he ftiould leave Efiajtab to rule in that State a s abfolute Lord, have the fame confirm'd tohkllTue, and be pro- teded againft the Turk or any other, without paying any Tri bute, but remaining in perfedt Libertj. Efiafidh, who was a pru dent man, well knowing the wayes of the King of Perjta 0 made no account of thefe offers, and thought not fit to adventure the fafety of the State which he poffefs'd, upon uncertain hopes 5 but trufting in the aid of the Tortugals, whole Ships might be of great ufe to him in that place, which the Perjians in order to offend Bajjora muft pafs by force, namely, either the Sea, or at leaft the great River, fthe Perfians having no Veflels fit to conteft with fuch ShipsJ he rejected the Propofition of the Sciah^ and prefently re-manded the Ambaflador with a ftrift Order imme diately to depart both the City and the State, left heftiouldfe- cretly corrupt ibme of the Grandees, who might afterwards pervert the people, who are half ^/^/M 5 s,Qfthe fedt of the Sciah 5 telling him in brief, that he Was the Great Turk's Vaflal andfo would die, and that he was prepar'd for War , if the Sciah pre tended any thing from him. The Sciah finding he could do no- ? thing upon Bajjbra by fair means 3 commanded the Chan of Scira%y K k as Wk Jul i mm II I ffha Travels of Peter Oclla VaLc, aThiTneareft Minifter to that Country, and the tnoft potent, to march thither with an Army, and attempt to take the (ame by force. Accordingly the Chan's Army came, ( in which I know not whether himfelf was in perfon, or Tome other General) and by the way of^dw/^er, and other places belonging to the near Hhaveiza^ enter'd into the State of BaJJora \ wnich entrance was the year before my arrival there, to wit, 1624. Yet he did not befiege the City, (aa it was reported at Goo) nor yet come near it, but only befieg'd a Garrilbn in the Frentiers call'd gahan^ which was in danger of being loft , to the great hazard of all the reft of the Country, and the fear of Baffora it felf} for the Terfians fought valoroufly, and flew many of the Defendants , but at length, by the help of the who from the adjoyning River did great mifchief with the Artillery of their Ships to the Perftan Camp , the QvLilbafci were repuls'd with lofs, or rather, of themfelves, ( being wearied with the length of the attempt, or elfere-caird into Perfor other fer- vices) they drew off and departed. Not did they return again till the following year, aslhavlfaid, about the time of my arri val at Bajtjora , upon the aqqafion ot dlfplacing Manfnr , and eftablifhing Muhhamed the Son oiMnharfiKb.

March the (ixtecnth.

March the feventeenth, Chogia Negem, (who might well know things, as he that was imploy'd in much bufinefs by the Baftia) in- form'd me that the Perfian Army confifted of 30000 men, and that there were feven Chans in it j which to me feem'd not pro- babJe,becaufe if the Chan of Sciraz, with his people was not fuf- ficient, 'twas poffible his Brother Davd Chan, whole Govern ment is near him, and the Chan of Locijian^ might be come 5 but that others more diftant (hould be there for the fole war of Btf- fira , there was no neceffity, and confequently., no ground to believe. He told me further, that now the waters were high there was no danger, nor could the perfians make much progrefs, by reafon of the great River which they were to pafs, and many over-ftow'd Lands and Trenches full of water, wherewith Baj- fora was now fortified : But when the waters came to be low, as they would be within three moneths, then BaJJbra would be in danger:M Into the EAST-INDIES. 251 danger: thatas for defence by thzVortugal Ships, the Perfuns might pafs over the great River by a Bridge much higher and further from Bajfora 3 either at which is in their Hands ? or at Baghdad it (elf, or fome where elfe, without the Portvgals entity being able to hinder them^that if they came but withProvifion for a few dayes, the Country on the Weft fide of the River on which Bajjhra (tands, was not fo defart but they might have forrage enough for a great Army: If this be true, as it may be, then confidering the power of the Perfians, their manner of warring, the fituation, ftrength, and forces of the City of Bajjbra 3 lam confident, that at the long run it will not fcape the Perfan* Hands,fo long as he holds Baghdad^ although in cafe of need the Grand Emir of the Defart (who is now Mndleg^ furnamed as all his Predeceflbrs were, Aburifc , that is, he of the Plume or Feather) (hould come to affiftthe Baiha^ who can now hope for no aid from the Turk, fince the taking of He alfb related to me concerning Baghdad , that the place was betray'd to the Sciah by Bekir Snbajci, call'd otherwife Dervife Mahhammd^ whofe Father (who pretended to render himfelf Tyrant there of) the Sciah caufed publickly to be flain upon his entrance into it, but kept the Tray tor with him, andus'd him well: That befides Baghdad ^ he took Kierkuc and Moujul by his Captains, and march'd beyond Hhella into the Country ot Emir AbHriJc &gt; even to Anna and r taiba &gt; within a little way of Aleppo which was thereupon in great fear 5 and that he left a Garrifon at Anna.

Finally, He added, that a potent Army of Turks had fincc ^ ^ fallen upon Perfia and Baghdad 0 and had already recover d Mouful and Kierknc $ which laftNews I rather fulpedt tobedi- fpers'd to animate the People of Bajfora, then hold for true 5 be- caufe, on the other fide,it was reported for certain, that the Stixh Was repofing his Forces at Ferhabad, which could not conuft with the fo near approach of the Turks againft him. , March the nineteenth, An eminent raan of Bajfora , nam d XII1; Scaich Abdajfalam , mufter'd a great company of his kindred, friends, and followers, with whom he intended to^go to the af- iiftanceof theBafha. Araongft them were mufter d about 2CO Chriftiansof S.John, arm'd with Arquebuzes, and other wea pons like the reiU but all, in my judgment, as much Moors as Cliriftians 3 !ktler Souldiers,and of no efteemln comparifon or the gizilbafci. March the two and twentieth. In the Piazza before the Bailia's Houfe, I faw awild Afs, or little Onager, which was Kk 2 I; mi 7/ l \T H 'ilr- fill i »1Lhe Travels cf Peter Delia Vallc, kept there for plealure. It was of the (hape of other Affes but of a brighter colour, and had a ridge of white hair from the head to the tail., like the mane of a Horfe 5 in running and leap- ingj it leem'd much nimbler then the ordinary fort of Affes. March the three and twentieth, A Portugal came from the Baftias Camp to Baffora, bringing News that the gizilbafci were return'd home to their own Countries, and that infuchhafte that they had left much Cattel, Goods, and Meat ready dreG'd in the Camp where they had quartered : Which fo unexpeded departure of the Perjlan Army, could not happen through any dilturbance given them by that of the Bajha &gt; but, perhapSjthey were re-call'd for fome other war, or fervice of greater ne- ceflity, as that of Or muz, or againft the Turks, or againftthe MogholditCandahar^ which the Sciah had lately taken, March the four and twentieth, I took the height of the Sun in Bajjbra at noon, and found him decline 28 degrees 48 minutes ^ ^ from the Zenith.

So that the Zenith of Bajjora is diftant from the iEquinoftial 30 degrees, 26 minutes, 32 lecoads, to which the Elevation of the North- Pole at the fame is equal. the one and thirtieth, Return'd the two Ships 7, above-mention'd to have been lent abroad by the General // II ' — i iijmft udiLjucb can a icrrats^ witn much wealth in them ^ and a rich Moor, who oiier'd a thoufand Patacches for his Kanfome, but they would not accept it.

Apnl the feventh, The Baftia return'd with all his Army to aj or a} t e fear and danger ot the war being now over by the cioparture of thePerfans. He enter'd into the City betimes in the Morning with great pomp, and the falutations of the Ar tillery. the thirteenth, F. Bajiliodi San Francefo. a Bare -footed Carmelite having finifli'd the building of the little Church and Coventof his Order which he had founded at Baffora, made a lolemn t eait, adorning both the Church, and the whole Orato- - . . ifT ry1 Into the EAST-INDIES. 253 allW ry of the Covent very fumpcuoully : and with a great concourfe of Chriftians both Europeans and Orientals of feveral Nations, he celebrated the dedication of the faid Churchj intitling it NoJtraSignorade 'i remcdii: The evening before, he had caufed many Bone-fires to be made, all the Portugal Soldiers contribu ting to the joy with many volleys of Arquebuffes. Moreover, to honour the faid Father, the Bafha fent about five hundred Moorifti Soldiers to the Covent to do the like, and caus'd many great Pieces to be (hot off at the Caftle, fo that the Feaft was celebrated generally by the whole City, both Chriftians and Moors, with great concourfe and applaufe. The next night,the Baftia himfelf with all his Court went to fee the Church and the Covent 'where alfo at his departure he left an Alms, the Fa ther receiv'd him with all due honour, and gave him a fumptu- ous Banquet 5 with which, both as to the manner and ceremo nies according to the fathion of the Country, both the Baftia and all the reft were much fatisfiU The General of the Tortugals, / with all the Captains of Ships, and moft principal Perfons of the Fleet, and (in ftiorO all the Europeans then in Bajjbra^ were prefent at this entertainment: only I, by reafon of an indifpofi- tion, had the difpieafure to be abfent. Mafs was fung by the F. Prior of the Augujiines, who affifted all the day to honour the feaft-, and the F. Provincial of Maniglta, who was a Paifenger with us, preacht. The fame day there came^to to the Baftia a Ctyigi bomthe Serdarox V'ezir of ConfiantinofU newly created (whole Predeceflor was faid to have been put to death by the Great Turk for having us'd little diligence in the affairs of Baghdad.) The faid Capigi brought the Baftia a Robe or Veft- ment (as their cuftom is) as a Prefent from the Fez,ir, and news that the Turkifti Army was already moving towards Baghdad, and was very near it, having re-taken JMonJul &amp;ud. Kierkuc, which \ are open places, and expos'd to the force of any Attempter. But that thisfhould happen fo foon, to me feem'd very ftrange, espe cially, if the new Serdar was lent from Conjtafitwofle the lame year, as he could not be before May or ApriLat the fooneft j and being of neceffity topafsby Aleppo, and get together not only much provifion, but alfo Soldiers from very remote Countries, and wait for them (befides 5 providing grafs and hay for the as every year they are wont to do in May) it was not poluble that he ftiould be fo foward by this time. Confidering too, that in all the Expeditions of late years, it hath been feen that the Turkifti Army never arrives at the Confines of Perfia the fame year that it is difpatch 't from ConliafttinoplejDUt muft always win ter the firft year either at Aleppo^ov 'wiMefopotawia^ov^t moftjwhen it is neareft in Erzirna-jhe. fecond year it arrives at the confines of Verim to make War 5 yea it oftentimes arrives there fo late in the year, and fo near Winter, that it fcarce do's any thing. Now that this new^er^rwas difpatcht from Conjiantinopk the fame yew&gt; and not the preceding,feem'd credible,becaufe 1 never^heard 01 his - wmtnng2^ The Travels of Peter DeHa Valle, wintringat ^/^^orany whereelfe^ 'twas likely that the new Serdar lately created at Conftantinofle (as he ufes to be in Marck^ and fometinnes fooner^) underftanding the danger of BaJJora^ prefently difpatch't the faid Ctpigi to confirm the mind and courage of the Baftia 5 which Capgi travelling by the fhorteft wap 5 and with great fpeed, as the bufinefs requir'd, might well arrive at Bajjbra from Confiantinofle by the time above-men tion d. In brief 3 I fufpeded the credit of fo near approach of the Turkifh Army, waiting till effeds (hould manifeftthe truth of the matter. Xy. -April the twenty third 5 News came to Bajfora, that the Ring of had ftraitly charg'd the who governs for him, and alfo his friend in the Defart Ewir Najtr, by all means to intercept the Cafila which was preparing at Eafora to go to Aleppo, or at leaft to hinder its going. This intelligence fo terrifi'd the Merchants who were upon the point to depart 3 that they deferr'd their journey, and in their own name dif patch't a Meffenger to Emir Najir, to know whether it was true ? and whether he would permit them fecure paffage or no. That it was true, on one hand I conceived not unlike- /i , &gt; ly i for it being of great importance to the Sciah to have the trade of India by Sea brought into his own Country, ('which, fince the taking of OrmH% &gt; he hath loft) and the laid trade being diverted to Bajfora , where (for want of Ships to conteft with the Portugals) he cannot hinder it ('which is the reafon why he was fo defirous to take Bajjbra, namely, that fo the Portugals might be depriv'd of all ports and pafles^ and be y.* neceflitated to come with the traffick of to Tome place of his Territories, without his rendring Or muz, to them) I fay, it feem d likely that he ftiould endeavour to hinder the traffick of BaJJora to Aleppo by land, which would amount to the fame thing : tor the Merchandifes of India cannot be all abfum'dat Bafora, bui[remaining there little or nothing muft be from thence A ~ difpers'dto Aleppo and el few here; Upon this account the Sciah rais'd a great War both againft the Portugals and the people of BaJJ'ora, whofe chiefeft fubfiftence is from this trade. On the other fide I conceiv'd it might not be true, becaufe Emir Najir j draws great profit from the tafilas which pais from Bajjbra to Aleppo ; and though at the taking of Bagdad he fided with the Sciah for lome end of his own 5 yet I believe,that as an Arabian and a tree Prince he is not lo devoted to the Sciah as to fer ve him with the prejudice of his proper interefts j and the rather becaufe at the lame time he keeps fome Agents and Minifters at BaJJora to receive the la:d Impofts, and without the Emirs afiiftance the Sciah can do nothing in thofe Delarts. Moreover,this Entir Na- ]ir hatli lately been much mortifi'd by thelcfles he receiv'd from Emir Abunjc^ and tis likely would rather endeavour to re-in- ^..ratia^e with Aburifc and the Turk (from whom he mayfuffer muchj lor avoiding a total ruine, than expofe himfelf to new * N - . dangersInto the E AS T IN DIES. 055 dangers for the Seiahfiom whom he can hope little good or hurt V' ' fo long as he is not Mafter of all as far as Aleppo $ which is not a thing to be brought to pafs fuddenly or eaftly. But of this alfo time will {how the truth. Maj the ninth., Another Capigi arrivM at Bajffora from the Ser~ X V I. dar, and was receiv'd with great folemnity and falutations of Artillery. He brought a Robe to the Bafha, and intelligence that he had left the Serdarzt Mardin^ which lies within a few dayes journey of Baghdad, donfirming the recovery of Afonfal and Kierkuc 5 (whereof, fuppofing the Serdar at Mar din, I made no fcruple) and adding that the Serdar was then upon removing from Mardin, and by this time had march't much forwards. This is what was given out i for more intrinfick and fecret news I could not know 5 having no acquaintance with any confiderable Turk from whom to learn the fame : nor was any more then this (ignifi'd to the chief Commander of the Pwt&amp;g^/ Ships. Only I judgd that the Turks well confidering the danger wherein Baf- fora was of being loft, might poflibly by thefe fucceffive Mef- fengersj and good tidings endeavour to confirm the minds of the Bafha, and the people^as much as they could. the eleventh;, The defign'd for Aleppo, which had many days waited fome leagues, without the City, at length fet forth and departed ^ either becaufe they had receivM a good an- fwer from Emir Nafir, or rather, ('as I believe) becaufe they re- ly'dupon other frefh tidings, how that Emir Najtrwas reconcil'd to Emir Abtirifc, and return d into the favour and devotion of the Great furk, iothat the Defart was all in peace , and perhaps alfo they trufted to the common report of the nearnefsof the Turkifh Army. I purpofed to depart from Ba[fora the fame way and upon the fame day (though alone, and not with the Capla) having hired Camels and certain Beduni Arabians to condud me. hut Alt Aga, the chief Captain of the Militia, gave notice to my Camelier that I muft not depart within three days. Whereupon being defirous to go with all fpeed by reafon that the hot weather came on, I got Sig. Confalvo Martins^ a Portugal Father 3 to fpeak to the faid Aga to know wherefore he detain'd us, and if there were no caufe,to difpatch us and let us go.The^anlwer'd that I muft by all means have patience for this week,that fo the Cafila might have time to get a little more onwards •, and that he did this becaufe he miftrufted my Camelier as a Beduin Arabian (although he had a Houfe and Wife at Bajjora) left for fome intereft of his own, departing at the fame time with theCafila, he (hould out go i/,and by other ways of the Defart( wherein he was Well ikil'd) give natice thereof to Emir Nafir, or elfeto fome other Beduin Arabians who might rob it, or perhaps alfo to the gizilbafci themielves. Wherefore fince my going fo foon might prove to my own damage, he defir'd for my fecurity 5 and the publick good of theCafila, that I would ftay thofe few days* to the end that the Cafila advancing before out of all fufpected places, my Ca- indict&lt;2 &lt;6 The Travels of Peter Delia Valle, melier might not have time to do any villany either to it or to me. The truth is 5 I did not conceive my Camelier likely to do any fuch thing, having had good information and affurance of him from Chogia Negem, to whom he was well known, and who recommended him to me : Neverthelefs, fince he that govern'd would have it fo, I had patience to wait as long as he defir'd, Yet from hence I gather'd that the above-mention'd news, now that the and Nd/zrconfpir'd againft the Cafila 5 was not altogether vain ^ being Ali AgA^ a man of fo great pldcein Bafor*.. had fuch apprehenfions about it. And it might confift well enough with the departing , for perhaps it went out upon a venture 5 theiVlerchants being unwilling to fuffer longer de- Jay, fforit was above eight months fince ihhCafila began to unite) I fay, at a venture 5 becaufe the Defart is like the Seaj where'tis a chance to meet or not meet enemies, and as men forbear not to fail upon the Sea through fear of Pirats or Ene mies, fo neither do they ceafe to pafs through the Defart. The F. Provincial of with his Companion, (a Caftiliantoo but not a Fryer of his Order) Adarc Antonio Lanza, a Venetian (who came with me from Goa to Bajfora) and I know not how many other Europeans,went along with the Cafila : I alone would not, but ftaid with my Servants to go by my felf, and to travel more hazardoufly indeed,but yet with more (peed, and undoubt edly with more convenience then they. May the thirteenth. Another Capigi fent from the Serdar to the Bafha arriv'd at bringing a Robe and a Scimiter as Prefents, and the confirmation of the Government of Bajfmh his perlon, which hitherto he had not had. As for news, twas diipers d amongft the people that the Turkifh Army was very neer, and almoft upon Baghdad $ yet Letters from our Jlepfo Merchants to the C^r^/e///e.f brought by a Moor of the company ot the faid Capigi, inform'd usfor certain that according to my above-mention cl Prophecy the Serdar was not yet come to A- leppo. Pis true, they writ that perhaps to make his voyage mure compendious he would not come to Aleppo^ but march di- 1 Ctrly to Mejopotamia and Baghdadhy another way j which yet was uncertain when the faid Letters were written : whence tis clear that one way or other he could not be further then dlefflO) and perhaps^according to my opinion, wa« fcarce departed from Conjtantinople. So that it was not poffible for Baghdad and Ter- Jta to have wars this current year 16255 fince it would have been noiiiiail Summers work to have march't to the Frontiers ;yet tnat war will follow the next year, unlefsfome other chance in- ttrvtne, I no-wife doubt.

June the third, Early in the Morning the Cafigi arriv'd at the place where we waited for him 5 whereupon, in order to our further progrefs, we difcharg'd fuch duties of Gabels orCuftoms as were to be paid at this Town. You muft know that in the whole way of thisDefart, we were to pay four Toils or Cuftoms, f if he that conducted us did not deceive us) namely, to Sceicb AhdnUah^ Lord of Cuwbeda, for every Camel's load of fine Merchandize, valu'd at the rate of Indian Cloth, five Piaftres ^ for every like load of any other Goods whatfoever, valu'd at the rate of Tobacco, a muchlefler fumm, but I know not how much. Another Gabelwastobe paid to a Chieftain of the Arabians of the Defart, whom they call Ben Chaled $ he takes for every load, be it what it will, five Lart, which amount to one Piaftre and a Sciahi be- Gdes, of which eight and a third part go for a Piaftre at Eajfora, but at Aleppo onely eight. The third Gabel was to be paid to another Head of the Arabians^ firnamed il Ciec$^ who takes for every load whaf foever, iix Sciabi ^ and laftly, fix other Sciabi, wtre in like manner to be paid for every load to another Captain of Arabtaxs, Coulin to the fore-faid Cieco, Scich Abdullah, Lord of Cuvebeda, laid, he would take nothing of me, in regard of two Letters which I brought him j one from the Bafha of Bajfou^ andntw Into the E AS T-I N D I E S. and the other from the Fador of the his Friend 3 both of them having much recommended me to him. The other three were not themfelves at CUveheda, but had their Agents or Officers there , to whom we paid what they faid was due 5 and they gave us an Acquittance for it 3 that it might not be demand ed of us again by any other of their Officers in the Defart. June the fourth, Scekh Abdullah^ it feems alter'd his mind con cerning the Gabel which he had remitted;, and requir'd the fame of me, taking for my ;two Trunks ten Piaftres^ which was a moft rigorous rate. I mention this to give notice of the manner of proceeding , and little pundualnefs obferv'd by thefe Bar barians. June the fifth. We departed Very early (toa$€Mijebeda, and before noon arriv'd at certain Wells or PitSjWhich they call Gane- mat, (importing their ufe for Cattel ) where we found many Arabians lodg'd. At a diftant view of them, we betook our felves to our Arms, againft what-ever (hould happen, but upon nearer approach,we perceiv d them to be poor peaceable people 5 whereupon we lodg'd all together in that place. Yet here we ha4 News that a band of Thieves had way-lay d us at another Pafs a little further off, with intent to affault us. For difcovering the truth whereof, our chief Gamelier went to Cnve- heda, where the Spies of thefc Thieves ufe to refide 5 and at night he brought us word that it was true, and that therefore it be- hovd us to go back again. Whether it was true, or onely an Invention of his for fome end of his own, I cannot affirm s but the next day early we return d to Cuitebeda, and lodg d without the Town at fomediftance from the place where we had been be fore. Two dayes after, we were^ perfwaded to lodg within the Town, for more fecurity from the Thieves, and to deceive their Spies, by making (hew as if we refolv'd not to go further, which might divert them from theit defign.

After noon, we proceed ed further tili an hour before night 5 and then took up our lodging near another water, June the fixteenth. Having travell'd from break of day tili noon, and men refted two hours, we proceeded again till night, lodging in a plac^. where the multitude of Gnats fuffer'd us to llecp but iittk.

The Capigi ibrahm Aga, had a Robe to prefent to him from the Serdar 5 but being we could not go to Argia^ by reafon all the Paflages were then overnown with water,, and the Cameliers had no mind to it in regard of a Gjbcl which would be recjuir'd there of us, we re- pos'd our felve;. about noon in the place where we were. Having pa s d Argia a good way, the Capigi got one to fwimover the waters and to advertife Hhafan Aga of the Serdar's Prefent which he had for him, and would have deliverd himfelf, had the u oeen pailable ^ he alio deiir d fbme Arqutbufiers to accompa ny us over the Defart.

June the nineteenth. Our removal hence being ftill deferr'd in expedation of the anfwer of Hhafan Aga, I went in the forenoon to take a more diligent view of the ruins of the above-faid an cient building. What it had been I could not underftand 5 but I found it to have been built with yery good Bricks, moft of which wereftampt in the midft with certain unknown letters which appearM very ancient. I oblerv'd that they ha.d been cemented, together in the Fabrick, not with lime, but with bitumen or pitch, which, as I faid,is generated in thefe De&amp;rts: whence the Hill,upon which thefe ruins are, is call'd by the Arabians y Mu- qeijer 0 that is, Pitchy. In the evening two men came from Hha- fan Aga^ to the Capgi with Letters and an Anfwer that he would fend him fome provifions 5 but they departed difcontented be caufe the Capigi gave them nothing. June the twentieth. Surveying the above-faid ruins again, I found on the ground fome pieces of black Marble, hard and fine, ingraven with the fame Letters as the Bricks 5 which fee^n d to me to be a kind of Seal like what the Orientals u(e at this day : for their Seals are only letters or written words containing the name of him whofe Seal it is, together with fome Epithet of humility and devotion. Titles of Honour, or other words according as every one pleaies 5 not being perpetual to the Fami ly, as ours are. Amongft other letters which I di(cover d in that fhort time, two I found in many places, one of which was like a jacent Pyramid thus, O, and the other refembled a Star of eight points in this form Of the Provifions promis d to the Capigi by Hhajan Aga^ fome few came this day ^ but he lent no more 5 and they faid,he was angry that the Capigi had not fent him the Serdar s Prefentvwhich he forbore to do,becaufe he knew he had abfolutely declar'd himfelf of the Perlian'Party.

Departing thence two or three hours before night, we quarter'd in another place callM Ehathuer ) where two or three men whom we met with their laden Camels, inform'd us that the great Cafila, which went fo many days before us from Ba/fora, had incounter'd many difficulties, and was ftopt by Emir Najir, who;, befides taking a great fum of money from them, alfo conftraind many of the people to go to Mefched Hhuf- fiinto fight with the grzilhafci, with whom he was now at en mity 5 in which conflict, which .prov'd little fuccefsful to the Arabians^ the chief Leader of the Cafila was (lain, his Sou fuc- ceeding him in his Charge &gt; with other like news, which made me doubt of the good eftate of our Francks who went along with that Cafila, V.

June the twenty fixth. We travelled from day-break till two hours before Noon, and then refted near certain Pits, where wc had on the right hand afar off Mefched-Ali^ the place where an ciently ftood the City of Kitfa, and where Ali the Son-in-law of Mabhammed wasllain 5 the name Adefched-Ali fignifying the place oi the Martyrdom of Alt, whom they hold a Martyr. And though the City of Kufa is no longer in being, yet^upon account of the faid Sepulchre, venerated by Mahometans, and adorned with a noble Fabrick, the place is frequented and inhabited; when w 7 e pafled by, it was in the power of the gizilhafet, where- asitufed to be in thatofthe Turks whilft they were Maftersof Baghdad, From hence we continued our Journey till two hours within night. jf^ethetwenty feventh, We fet forth by day-light 3 and at Sifli _ Noon9 Into the EAST-INDIES. luml; Noonrefted near a water, which rifing out of the ground, runs under a thicket of Canes, where we ftayed all day. The next day letting forth, and refting at our accuftomed hours, we pa{- led over many dry Lakes, which {eem'd to have had water in them at Tome time of the year. June the nine and twentieth , Two or three hours before Noon, we reftedbyawater nearthe mines of an ancient great Fabrick, perfeftly fquare with thirteen Pillafters, or ronud Columns on each fide without, and other compartiments of Arches 5 within which were many Chambers, with a Court of do great bignefs, and uncoverd. The Arabians call this Fabrick Cafr Chaider, I could not conjedure whether it had been a Pal- lace or Temple, orCaftle^ but I incline to believe it a Palace rather then any thing elfe. In this place we had within half a dayes journey on the Right Hand Mefched-Bhujfein, which figni- fies the place of the Martyrdom of Hhujfein^nd where Hhujfan the Son of and Fatima, Mnhhammed's Daughter, was flain, and buried by his Emulators 5 which place, in the Country calld Kierbeld) being inhabited and adorn'd with the faid Sepulchre, which the Moors vifit as Holy, ('a very fumptuous Fabrick after their mode^ was now in the Hands of the gt%ilbafci^ into which it fell with the other Territories of Baghdad^ which is but a little diftant from thence. Here we ftay'd to pay a Gabel to Najtr- ben-Mabhanna, Lord of thefe Defarts,or rather, to Sceich Ahiuleb his Son 5 for Sceich Nrfj/f being now old,and devoted to a Spiritual Life, (as he that had been in pilgrimage at Mek*) hadrefign'd the Government to his Son 5 and both of them were now remaining in Tents about a League from the place, where we refted to wards the North-Eaft. ytne the thirtieth, In the Morning the mo Capigts that were y I in our company, went (eparately to carry their Letters and Pre* fenfs from the Serdar to the Sceich 3 namely , Ibrahim Jga to theprefent, *ni Mahkmnd Agato the preceding Serdar who, as they faid, was poyfon'd either by others, or by himfelf fot fear of worfe, becaufe he had not been diligent enough in the war of Baghdad 5 yet this hisCapzgz, having been fent tofeveral other places, could not come hither (boner to ths Accich, After dinner, in the abfencejof the Caprgi, the Sceich s Men came to demand a Gabel 5 and after I had pay d them as much as they requir'd, to wit 3 twelve Piaftres, for onely two Cheits, and two or three more Piaftres offree-gift &gt; neverthelefs they opeo all my Trunks, breaking feme for hafte, turning all things topfie- turvy, and taking away for the Sceich and themfelves fame things ofvalue which they lik'd, a rich Perfian Turbant ot bilk and-Gold, a piece of tine checkered Silk to make Caffocks with- all, 'after the Pcrfian Mode 5 many difties of rare Porceilane, beautifi'd with Gold and colours 5 an Harquebufe belonging to my Servant 3 much curious Paper of Japan and India j bmdeSt many other toyes which I rememb .r not, telling me ^at toyInto the EAST-INDIES. mform'd that I underftood the Language, he told rae^ that I muft excufe what his Officers had done, for he had great need of Arquebuzes for war 5 that the T urbant and piece of Silk much pleas'd him, but he would pay for them 5 whereto I an- fwer'd, that I did not value his payment, but would give him both the one and the other. Then he call d for the Turbant, and having view'd and highly commended it, though I told him it had been us'd, (as indeed T had worn it feveral tiStes in Perfia) he enter'd into the Tent with it where his Women were, and ftom whence was heard a great noife of Hand-mils, where-with to make Meal for Bread 5 it being the cuftom amongft the Ara bians , for even the nobleft Women to do fuch fervices ; By and by he came out again with the Turbant upon his Head, where upon his people congratulated him for his new bravery, faying to him, Mnbarek^ that is, Blefled, to the fame purpofe with our Ad multos Amos, Then they fet before him a brafs diQi full of Grapes, and we being all call'd about him, he began to eat and give us fome of the faid Grapes, which were very fweet and good, and the firft that I had eaten this year.

We travell'd no further this day, but onely at night went to joyn with the Capigi's, who had pitch'd a Tent a little further from the Water, to avoid the Gnats there, which were very troublefome both to Men and Beafts.

The Mahometans celebrated their B air am , the Faft of Ramadh an being now ended. July the eighth. We came to feveral places of ftagnant waters, and baited at one, two or three hours before noon 5 but the water was fulphureous and ill-tafted , as 'moftof the reft were alio, in regard ot the many Minerals where-with the Earth of the Dciart abounds. We departed not from this place at night, ecaufe we were to pay a Gabel to Emir Aindleg Abftrifc^ whofe 1 erntory here-abouts begins.

Three hours before night, we put our felves upon the way 5 and travell'd till about an hour before night, when we came to a place of water. the tenth. We travell'd till Noon, and refted in a great Plain furrounded with certain Hills, in the midft whereof ftands ereded a Stone^ fafhion'd at the Top like the bowl of a Foun tain. After which, we proceeded till an hour after Sun-fet, and came to a place where we found good water between two little Hills. Here we ftaid to refrefti our felves and our Camels till three hours before night ^ the Capigi who were to go by the way of Anna to find the^mtar at Mardin^ or elfewhere, depart ing before us : but we, who intended to go to without touching at Anna 0 for compendioufnefs oi the way, and for avoiding payment of fome kind of Gabel the^left the way to Anna on the right hand, and took that within the Defart more Southward. We travell'd all the remainder of this day^ and all the night, with part aHb of the next day, without ftaying 5 to the end we might the fooner arrive at water, of which we had no lefs defire then need i July the twelfth. About three hours after Sun-rife we baited^ being weary, at the foot of certain little Hills, without finding water 5 fo that we were fain to drink that little which remain d in the Goat-skin borachoes which we carri'd with us. About three hours before Sun-(et, we proceeded again till aknoll: Noon the next day, when we arriv'd at water, to wit, the famous Ri ver Euphrates, lighting upon a place of the ordinary way to A- hppo, where I had formerly pals'd when I went from thence to Baghdad, and where the road between the River and certain little Hills full of that Talk or (hining Mineral is very narrow. Our further ftirring at night was prevented by the fupervening of fome Soldiers, lent by the Officers ot Anna, (yjhomiheCapi- gtsha.d inform'd of ourpaflage) to demand thole Tolls or Ga- bels which we had fought to avoid, although we pjifi d not through that City.

I paid for my part fix Piafters, and gave two more as a gratuity to the Soldiers, befides which, I was obligd to pay twenty to the chief Camelier, whole money was all gone 5 and in this manner I was conftrain'd both to profit and pleafure him who never did me other than difprofit and difplealure.But for all this, they afterwards open'd the two grcateft 1 runks 1 had, and tumbled all my Goods about, treatkfg me with ail rigor and difcoiu tcfie.

This being over, about three hours before night. We fet forth and travell'd till night. Some of the above-mention d Soldiers return'd to Anna^ but others, who were carrying I know not what moneys to their Emir Mudkg, accompani 'd withus. I n the Evening the Leader or Chieftain of thefe Soldiers made me open my Trunks once again, (namely the two little ones which they had omitted in the day^ and putting all my Goods in dif- order, took away many things, as a Mantle of Sitti Maani of deep azure filk, according to the mode of Ajfyria^ a Ball of Amber, an Alabafter Vefiel curioufly wrought, and confign'd to me in India by Sig.

It was no fmall good luck that I fav'd the Sword and Ponyard of: Sitti Maani^ with many of her jewels, braceiets,8c other ornaments of Gold from their rapacious hands, hiding them under a trunk ;for,if they had feen them/tis ten to one but they would have taken them from me. I relate thefe things that it mjy be known what Tyranny thele Barbarians exercife in their own Countries towards us, who in ours very often, with iil-employ'd courtefie, are wont to be undefervedly carefs 'dand honour'd when they come thither. July the htteenth. We travell'd from Day-break till Noon, ana three hours after till night, when we took up our Station not far from the River, arnongft many fhrubs which to me feem'd to be Juniper, or elfe that plant which in Ferfia they call Ghitz. i he next two days we travell d and refted at our ufual hours, and on the latter, we reftedliear a Pit or Well of bitter and ftir^ing water in a mineral Soil, all full of Talk , of which I brought away;ii|| ' Into the E AS T-I N D I E S. 269 away a parcel with me.In like manner we proceeded the two next days ^ and on the twenty firft 3 we pafs'd by a ruinous Gaftle call'd Hheir, which I had formerly feen only by night when I went from Aleppo to Baghdad. I took a better view of it now, and found it to be a great Building D all of good and large white Marble Stones 5 the form ofit is a long Square;, with walls round about 5 here and there diftinguilh'd with fmall round Turrets 5 within are many contrivances of Rooms, all likewife of white ftone ? but fo rui nous that it cannot be known what they were. From hence we travell'd about three hours further, and at night arriv'd at Ta~ iba, a Town which I had formerly feen, and lodg'd in a by-place amongft the walls of the Houfes near the Gate. jf«/} the twenty fecond, This day was fpent in paying the ufu- al Gabels, which every day are enhaunc d in thefe Countries, and are now become infupportable. Though I had nothing of Merchandife, but only goods for my own ufe 5 yet I could not come off under twenty Piaftres between Gabels and Donatives to the Officers, which they demanded as equally due. Here I found an Arabian nam'd Btrekjet, who fpoke a little Italian, and pafs'd for Faftor or Procurator of the Franks^ faying, he had authority fo to be from the Confuls of Aleppo. He prefent- ly ofTer'd himfelf to (peak to the Officers in our behalf, gave us an Entertainment, and invited us to lodg in his Houfe, and, if we had been fo minded, would have conduced us thither j but his fervices tended only to get fome money of us, 4nd by his fpeak- ing with the Officers to make us pay more then perhaps we fhould otherwife have done. July the twenty third. Two hours after Sun-rife, we departed from Taiba^ whence the faid Officer fent an Arabian with us, to conduft usfirft to Emir Mudleg (who they faid was at Hhamah, between Aleppo and Damafcus) and afterwards to Aleppo 5 they having done the fame to the great Cafila of Bajfora which had pafs'd by Taiba a little before us. This going to the £*//&gt;, was a troublefom thing, both in regard of the great diverfion out of the way, and the inconveniences we imagin'd the Ewir himfelf would put us to, after all the Tyrannies we had hitherto met with in the Defart. Wetravell'd till paft Noon, and after a ftiortreft till Sun-fet, having a continu'd ridg of little Hills al ways on the left hand. July the twenty fourth. We travell'd again from day-rlight till palt Noon, and two hours more in the Evening, takidg up our Quarters an hour before Sun-fet. Jniy twenty fifch, We fet forth an hour before Sun-rife, tra velling till Noon, when the Arabian, afiignd to us by the Offi cers of Taiba to conduft us to the Emir, being fo perfwaded, as I believe, by the Cameliers, who alledg'd that the Camels were very weary (as indeed they were, and ovet-iaden, in regard that many of them dy'd bythe.way, fo that tiiey could travel but gently) refolv'd to go alone before us by a neerer way over ^ the ii' 1 #1 1 h Is . !2 7° r the Travels of Peter Delia Valle, the mountains 5 and leave us to follow him leifurely^stheCame- liers faid they would.I was glad of his going 5 and intended to take a different courfe from what the Cameliers imagin'd ^ butbecaufe it was not yet feafonable, I held my peace. After two hours reft, we travell'd till an hour before night, when we took up out Sta tion ncer certain Pits, a little diftantfrom the reliquesof certain ancient Fabrickscalfd Sir/a by me formerly feen and defcrib'd in my journey to Baghdad. . the twenty fixth. Setting forth by day-light, we came to relt after Noon near a water which fprings up in a place foil of fmall Canes, whence we remov'd not this pigbt, partly that ourt ir'd and over-laden Camels might recover themfelvesa little, and partly, becaufe the Cameliers were minded to eat a Camel there conveniently, which falling lame of one leg they koockt on the head in the morning 5 and indeed they had eaten all the others which fail'd by the way, either through Difeafe or other- wife. Of this, which was not infirm, I was willing to take a trial, and lik*d the roafted flefh well enough, only it was forae- thing hard. the twenty feventh. Setting forth early, we wav*d the diredeft way to Aleppo, (^which was by the Town of AchiU)tm&amp; took another more Southwards, and to the left hand, which led to the place where the Emir refided 5 intending to leave the Ca- melier at a certain Town upon the way, from whence he was to go alone to the Emir, to carry him a Prefent, and excufe our go ing to him by alledging the death and wearinefs of our Camels. Hereby we endeavour'd to avoid ( if poffible) the troubles and dilgufts which we were likely to meet with from the Emir and his Arabians, in cafe we fhould have gone tohim our felves. At Noon, we came to the detignd Village, call'd Haila 5 they ac count it a Mez&gt;ar J that is, a place to be vifited, and of devotion, in regard of fome perfons buried there whom the Mahometans hold for Saints: yet it confi.fted only of four poor Cottages, and thole un-inhabited and abandoned, as is credible^ by reafonof the Tyrannies which the Arabians of theDcfart, efpecially the Soldiers, exercis'd in thefetroublefom times upon the poorPea- iants. 1 he Camelier, becaufe he could not leave us here, by reafbn the Village was without people, purpofed to carry us to the Emir ^ doubting, left if he did otherwife, it might turn to his prejudice. Whereupon, confidering what difgulh and per- , ^ a P s dangers too I might meet with there, both by reafonof the Vv omen whom I carri'd with me, and of whom the Mahometans ute to be very greedy , and alio by reafonof the body of Sitti Maani, and upon other accounts^ I fet my footagainft the wall, and refolutely told the Camelier, that I would by no means go to Emir Mudleg, with whom I had nothing to do^now I had pay d all his Gabelsi I would go diredly to Aleppo ^ whither if he would not carry j»e with his Camels, I would go on foot with my people, leaving all my Goods there on the ground to hi5 .

The chief Came lier try'd a good while to prevail with me to go with him to the Ewir $ but at length feeing me obftinfatej and fome other Came- liersof his companions of the famemind 3 he refolv'd at laft to leave the Camels with me to carry my Goods diredtly to Aleppo^ together with (bmefew other companions of the Journey, and to go himfelfalone with all his loads to the Emr, • purposing alfo to tell him., that we by force, and againft his will 3 had freed our felves from going to him 5 with which I was very well con tented. After he was gone his own way, we took ours direflly to Aleppo , and after two hours travel, took up our ftation in a bare champian place, where night had over-taken us, July the eight and twentieth, From Sun-rife we travell'd al- moft till noon, but the Camels being few, weary,and over-laden, made no great progrels. After three hours baiting, we journey d again till almoft night, and lodgd by a water near the Tents of fome Arabian Beguin fhep herds who were there. July the nine and twentieth. Setting forth early, we (aw lome number of Horfe crofs the way before us at a good diftance, and finding the place a Plain inclos'd with Hills, and conlecjuently, fit for Ambufcadcs and Treacheries, wefufpedted that they were Thieves, and that they went to wait at fome Pals to aflault us. Wherefore we put our felves in order, and march'd a good while on foot with our Arms ready to defend our felves by fight: But at length thefe fufpitions vanitti'd, and we met no body 5 and, peradventure, they were people that were afraid of us, and fled. Such encounters we frequently had in the Defartj and many times betook our felves to our Arms 5 fome times too in the night we were vifited by Pilferers, who attempted to fteal fomething clandeftinely 5 but, God be thanked, no mifchief ever befell us, and the Thieves finding us upon our guard, went away always fruftrated 5 and fometimes too,- either hurt or teui** fy'd by our Arms. On this occafion 1 will not omit, (now we are near the end of this journeyj, that the Defart between Aleppo a great Plain with very few inequalities 5 and fome 01 the foil is dry, fome faltifh and full of Other Minerals, little (tony, and lefs mooriQi With Keeds 5 but the greateft part was green with ■ t m XL m : ■Tbe Travels of Peter Delia Val le, with srafs at the time of my paffing through it, yet withgrafs moft commonly thorney, and good onely for Gamels to eat.

From hence! dilpatchd my Ser\ 3nt GiovitiH Rubehh with a Camelier to which was about a League off 5 and I writ Letters by him to the moft Illuftrious Sig.

After my Servant was gone, we follow 'd him till within a mile of Aleppo, where we fhyd 'his return in a Mejchita or Sepulchre, upon the way, of oneSceicb Saddi, venerated for a Saint 5 and becaufe either the Confal s Servants mifs'd of me and took another way , or elfe ray Servant arriv'd there late 5 therefore hearing of no Anfwer, we remain d in this place all night. JmIj the thirtieth. In the Morning I writ again to the Cooful, and to Sig: Giovan Maria de Bona, his chief Interpreter, and my ancient Friend, to whom I had not written the day before, becaufe I beliv'd him dead, as was falfely reported at Baffsn5 but underftanding in the laid Mejchita by certain Women that he was alive and well, I would not omit to write to him allb. I gave account both to the Conful and to him where I was, and defie'd of both the fame favours of being met and provided of a habitation, as I had done the day before. As foon as my Letters arriv'd at Aleppo, the Conful fent feveral perfonsto tetch me, who the Evening before had fought me a good while, but in vain, and went to look for me at the Town of Ludehi, whencel fent the firft advice.

The Conful at firft intended to receive my Women into his Houfe , but afterwards being told that it was not convenient by reafon of the churliftinefs of the T urks, who were now become more exorbitant than ever, he thought to lodg them in another decent place , but Sig: Giovan Maria de Bona, was pleas'd to take them to his Houfe, where-with I was very well contented , becauie they could not go to a better place whilft feparated from me: They werereceiv'd there, and treated by the Women of Sxq .

He gave me certain intel ligence how Sultan Mufiafa, Brother of the deceafed Sultan Ah- md, who reign'd in Cenftantinople at my being there, reign d, and wasdepos'd for an Ideot (^as really he isj twice? namely cnce before, 'and once after Sultan Othman. How Othmanj who was a Prince fufficiently odd humor'd, being ill-bent againft the Chriftians, and very defirous to make an Expedition againft Rome after the bad fuccefs befallen him in Poland, was ilain by his own Grandees, who would not fuffer his government, which was fomewhat rigorous and violent : and that, asa (ign of his be ing llain, he that llew him, carri'done of his ears to Mnfia- fas Mother, who was yet living, and was likely to be well- pleas'd therewith. That it was not true that the faid Othman in the beginning of his Reign had put to death gfizkgM'aji offo great authority in the time of Sultan Ahmed his Father, becaufe he had too much power,having been the man that depos'd Muftt- fa, and.placd Othman himfelf in the Throne 5 but indeed he banifht him from Confiantinople, fending him into a kind of exile to live privately in JEgyft ^ from whence he was afterwards re- call'd by the prefent Emperor, and reftor'd to his ancient favour, and at length dy'd of a difeafe at Conjiantinople.

By this means the faid Cof fin was happily convey'd both in and out, without being undg-- ftood what it was either by the Turks, or Mariners of the Ship, who otherwife would undoubtedly through their vain Auguries have fcrupled to carry it.

He told me,he was very defirous to go to Rome, and in a manner of- fer'd himfelf to accompany me, though I was to depart the next day:but becaufe he faid,he had not his Patriarch's Letters for that purpofe, but expected themihortly, therefore (according to the prudent judgment of other perfons who had inform'd me of his alTairs,namely, that there was little likelyhood ofhis having Let ters ofmuch importance from the Patriarch, and that his defireof going to was chiefly upon hope to get fomething therej I counMl d him by no means to get to -K(7^/e,without his Patriarch s Letters, inalmuch as the fame would render his reception un doubtedly more favourable.He came to be of my opinioiijand (aid he would follow me as foon as his Letters arriv'd, but in the mean time he defir'd me, that I would carry with me two men of his Nation,oft Into the EAST-INDIES.

After I had gone through many of their narrow Lanes, which they contrive fo, purpofely to hide the goodnefs of the BuHding from the Turks, I came at length to the Synagogue j which is a good large fquare uncbver'd Court, with cover'd Walks or Cloyfters roundabout, upheld by double Pillars di- fpos'd according to good Architedure. On the right hand of the entrance, is a kind of great Hall, which they make life of for their Service in the Winter, when it is cold or rains 5 as they do of the Court in Summer and fair weather. In the middle of the Court four Pillafters fupport a Cupoletta, under which in a high and decent place, like our Altar, lyes the volume of the - LaW ? and there alfo their Dodtor and principal Rabbi ftands f reading in a kind of mufical tone , to whom all the people alter natively anfwer. They ftand in very great number difpers'd in the Court, Cloyfters, and Hall, with their bonnets on their ' / Heads, and promifcuoufly like us in our Churches, Men and # Women together- (though I have fometimes feen it otherwife in Italy') } yet they are mixt in fuch order that thofe of one fa A mily Men and Women ftand all together; and, I believe too, they have their peculiar places and benches to fit upon. More over, the right fide of the Synagogue was fill'd with Jews origi- ginaries of the Country from ancient time ^ but the left with European Jews,who although inhabitants,and marry'd at Aleppo, yet are originally adventitious 3 and thefe are all Spaniards, and fpeak Spantfi for their natural Language $ yea, many of them were born and bred up if not Spain or Portugal, at leall: in Italy, Germany, or other Countries of Chriftendome. I was carry'd to fee this Synagogue by a Jew nam'd or in our Lan guage BleJJed, whom I had known at my laft being at Aleppo He was born and bred in Mantua, a man well qualifi'd, dane'd, play'd, and fung competently well 5 and upon thefe accounts came iiii11 rl yll i^j || lil | Hi 11 ml' ilii i|i| It! • ! rI'- ;i|y 178 ii H p i 1 • 1 . 1 I 'ivf l, s i 'I.'- : ' I: ! :^rM I he [ravels of Peter Delia Vallc, - 1-4\ came to my familiarity. Wc fat together a good while in the Synagogue amongfb his fellow-Jews., beholding their Ceremo nies 5 and 3 after I had feen enough^ 1 went away and left Baruch at his devotions. As 1 went home I pafs'd by theCarvanferdi, (or Market) of Silk, as they call it, becaufe in times paft. Silk and other Perfian Commodities were brought thither more then to other places, but now it is little frequented. Here buying foipe few things of certain Vzbeihi T artars, newly come to Alep po with a Caravan ^ I enquir'd concerning their Countries, and th^y told me, that no Tartars are call'd Vzkeghi, but thofe of the Countries of Balch, Buchara, and Sarntaca9td^ who, at this day , are divided under two Princes, Brethren ^ one whereof hath his Seat at Balch, and is call'd Nedhir Mtthhammed Chan^ on whom depends an inferior Prince, nam'd Bahadur, fwhichfig- nifies Gallant or Stout ) and firnam'd, Jelan Tuft, from hislpoyl- ing'and killing his Enemies in war, for in their Language Jefan 1 ligqifies to Spoil, and Tufc xo Kill. The other Brothernart'd Imanculi Chan, hath under him Tofc-Kmd^ Endigtan or Endigan, with other Territories, and both of them border up'on thofe of the Perfian Empire, and reign in the Coun tries , anciently cali'd Sogdiana, BaUriana, and perhaps alfo Hireania , but by the Moderns, Maurenucher, and 7«r- ktjian. The fame day after dinner I took leave of the Conful, with all my other Friends, and was by his Servants, and many others of the Italian Nation, accompany'dout of the Cityi 1V. Before we mounted our Camels, I was defirous to fee, in the Suburbs ofJleppo, the Churches of the Oriental Chri ^ians 5 which ftand in a Street call 'd Giudpda, not from the Jews, asfomewho Ikill not of Languages erroneoufly imagine, but from the Ara- bick word Gedida, which fignifies Nea? 5 perhaps, becaufe this place of i he Suburbs was built more lately then others. Here, a little out of the Street on the right hand, I found four Churches all together, led unto by one Gate onely from the Street, but (the place being fpacious enough within) conveniently divided and ieparated about the Court or Yard ; Two of them belong'd to the Armenians, the greater (a fair one indeed) calVd Santi guarant a, or the forty Saints and the lefs, Delia Madonna, w. our Lady. One of the other two call'd Sanlsicolo, beiongcl to the Greeks^ and the other, which is the leaft of all, to the Maronite Catholicks, call'd Sant* Elia. In another place a good diftant from this, I faw alone by it felf another Church, han- iome and large for the Country, built after our manner, with three Naves or Ifles upon Pillars^ it belong'd to the Syrian jaco- bites,' and was call'd Sitaa AJJcdi, or Santa Maria. This Church hath adjoyning to it a good Houfc, with a little Garden and other conveniences according totheufeof the CoyntryjWherein lives the Patriarch of thejacobits, calld for whom 1 had brought hom Bajjbra a Letter of F.

He told me, he was glad o£¥,BaJilio's Letter jand refiding at Bajfbray and building a Church there fb peaceably, and with fo much favour of the Turks, as he advertis'd him 5 and that he would continue correfpondence with him. He alfo (hew'dlme two fair Books of the Gofpels written in large Parchment-fheets, with excellent Syrian Charafters, otieof them, (as I remember) written four hundred years ago 5 the Letters whereof were all either of Gold or Silver : and this Book, they fay, was found by the Turks in Cyprus when they took the Ifland, and carri'd to Con- from whence it was afterwards redeem'd with mo tley, and brought hither.

After a (hort travel, we refted till the Moon arofe, and then proceeded all the remainder of the night in bad and uneven ways. ^Augnfi the twenty fourth, We pafs'd by fome Villages and places cultivated with Olive-trees, which 1 was joyful to fee, not having beheld any for many years. ^ About Noon, we refted amongft certain ruins of Stone-buildings which had once been very magnificent, and feem'd to be the remains of fome noble City in ancient times. Here the Archbifhop ifciva-jahrfs men, the one nam'd Abdifciva, and the other Hendi^ overtook me with his Letter: I receiv'd them, and carri'd them with me as I had promis'd. The faid place is call'd Hhalqa, which fignifies a Circle, becaufe 'tis a great Plain almoft furrounded with Hills. Three hours after Noon we fet forth again ^ we pafs'd by another Vil lage belonging to the Territory of Hhalqa, and at night took up our Quarters near a running Water under another Village call'd Harta. At midnight the Moon rifing, we fet forth again, and travell'd all the remainder of the night. the twenty fifth. Continuing our journey we camein- to a great Plain, and travelling along the River Orontes accord ing to theftream ,(which we had found at day-breakj we crofs'd over the fame upon a good Stone-bridge. Here the Plain is con- traced, being ftreightned on tHe right hand with high, and on the left with lower mountains 5 travelling in which Valley about Noon, we arriv'd at which is fronted with high moun tains almoft on the North beyond the River Orontes^ and back'd with lower toward the South, the walls of the City being ex tended over the fame. Weenter'd at the Eaft-gate, and took up our Quarters near a great Ciftern which is on the left hand of the Cate,divided only by a wall from the Street,and pavM round with white Marble ; it is fill'd by a running-water, and ftands in a {hady retir'd place, very delightful and convenient for travel lers to reft in. On the right fide of the faid Gate, in one of the Towers of the wall,wasa large and fair room, as high as the wall, with few windows befides low and half-fill'd loop-holes for de fence 5 fo that it was very cool,and would not be inconvenient in hot hours, were it in good repair 5 but 'tis now all ruinous with out a pavement, being made only a Stall for Cattle. The walk of the City were ftill (landing, all of Stone, magnificent, and built with Turrets after the ancient mode. At the Gate where we enter'd, began a Street not very broad but of great length, extended within the City, and pav'd all with white Marble. An* tioch is now inhabited by few people, who live in little cottages patcht out of the ruins amongft Gardens, of which theCityisall full ^ for of the ancient houles and ftruftures, faving the walls of the City, there is none ftanding.

There being nothing elfe remarkable to be feen 3 we went away three hours before night, by the fame Gate we had enrer'd at (perhaps becaufe the way was better' without then within^) going about the City on the outfiide to wards the plain on the North. But rd-eiltrlng afterwards at a breach of the Wall, we walkt a good way within the City 3 which I found full of Gardensand OrchardSj with few dwel lings., faving at the end. At length we went out at a Gate which ftands in the more Weftern part of the City^though not full Weft, where we pafs'd over a fair Stone-bridg which lies upon the River Or antes our way to Alexandretta on the Northern banck 5 for, they that go diredly thither from Alepfo, never fee this Ri ver., but leave it much South. We travell'd along its banks till night, contrary to its ftream 3 and took up our lodging by the River-fide, almoft diredly agairift tHe fcaftern Gate, at which weenter'd, and which we beheld afar off on the other bank ; Antiach is almoft fquare, about a mile long, and hath many Gates ^ on the South, it is terminated with Mountaius, Which, they faid, were feven, like the feven Hills of Rome^ but I could diftinguilh no more then five, that is, not five Mountains, (for the Mountain appears but one continu'd riigj but five tops of it. Thefe Mountains are very fteep, and therefore I think could not be built upon V but only, that part ,of them was included within the wall for ftrcngth, and that the fame might not be pre judicial to th« City by being left without, in cafe of War. That • which remains of the City at the foot of the faid Mountains, is of (mall circumference j fo that the City appear'd to me inuch lefs then I imagined it. Within, as I faid,there is not any Fabrick ftanding, but infinite ruins, and the earth is everywhere ftrow'd with great and goodly ftones.

We refreflit our weary Camels with two hours reft in a place amongft the Mountains, where 3 though there were no Houfes, yet we wanted not Water and wild Figs. After which being arriv'd to the higheft part of the Mountain, and re-enter'd the common road from Aleppo, we difcover'd the Mediterrane an Sea afar off, which to me was a welcome fight, in regard I had not feen it fince my departure from in the year 1616. We defcended down by a way where the Precipices are lecur'd with good breaft-works of earth fometimes for a Mile together 5 and at length came to the Town of Beilan, from whence the moun tains are here denominated Montague di Beilan, A little be yond this Town, we repos'd in a by-place near a running- water, and under the (hadow of abundance of Nut-trees 3 for the Town it felf and places adjacent were all taken up by a great Caravan which came from Aleppo xo Conjiantinople by land. the twenty feyenth. An hour before day we began to defcend amongft the ftreights of thefeMountains-^here we met a great Caravan of Merchandife which had lately come in two Ve netian Ships, and was going to Aleppo : After two or three hours travel we came to Alexandretta^ call'd by us Europaeans Scande- roon, but more correftly in Turkiili Eskander, that is, Alexcwdro Craco^ becaufe they will have it denominated from Alexander the Great. It was fometimes a noble City, but by reafon oi' the bad air (for itisfituated upon the Sea in a Moorifh Plain, and inclos'd with Hills which keep off the wind) it was never much inhabited 5 and the year before my being there,it was al- wholly deftroy'd by the Pirats oiBarbarj^who ipare none either of a different or of their own Religion., nor yet bear any refpeft to the States of the Great Turk himfelf, though their Lord3 Oo 2 fo1 he Travels of Peter Delia Valle, fo that Ifoundoncly fourfmall Houfes/carce re-edifi'd,this year wherein the Lieutenant of the place (for the right Governoiir remains at Jleppo^) the Vice-Confulsof fuchEuropsan-Nations as trade intoSoria, and a very few other people refided. Sig; Antonio Grandi, the Venetian Vice-Conful, having notice of my coming by a Meflenger whom I fent to him from Eeilan, re- ceiv'd and lodg'd us in his own Houfe with much Courtefie 5 upon the recommendation of his Conful 5 from whom I prefentedhima Letter. And when I had acquainted him with my defire to depart as foon as poflibie s and (hewn him the Governor's Pafs for my fclf goods, and people, which I brought with me from Aleppo, toge ther with other commendatory Letters to his Lieutenant and other Miniftcrs^ the faid Sig: Antonio went prefently to prefent the fame, andjjby the authority he had here obtain'd, much more ea^ly then I expeded, that I might imbarque when I pleas'd • yet upon promife, according to the cuftomof Turkje, ofafmall Prefent to the Governor, and alfo to a Jew his Minifter^ which was afterwards given to them both. After dinner Captain Fort, Commander of the French Ship S.Anne, wherein I was to im barque, came a ftiore, and I agreed with him to go aboard that night, though he pupofedto ftay two or three dayes longer, in expectation of more lading before he let fail. Accordingly after I had written to andfupp'din the Houfe of SigiJntonio Grandi, I was carry'd aboard by the faid Captain with all my people, and onely thofe few goods which I had brought with me iiom Aleppo $ leaving all the reft tobefirft receiv'd by thefaid Sig: Antonio, and then convey'd tome by Sea more atleifure. 1 bus alter many years I quitted the Continent of Ajia^mth a cer tain Rtfolution never to let foot upon it again unlefs armM, and began my Voyage towards my defired Italy y there being with me of Women, Butoni MaTi&amp;nt Tin at in, a Giorgian Virgin;, and taithtul Companion ot mod of my Peregrinations, Et/geitid an Indian Maid of Scilan 5 and of Men, F.

Then we pafs'd through a Village call'd Brome- Uxaia^ and at length arriving at Kiti, which lyes a little diftant from the Sea, (theCoaftof thelfland running Weft-ward from the Saline ) we vifited Aluife Cucct^ whom (indeed like a Philofopher, as he profefles to be) we found living in a Houfe, which had fometimes been great and fair, but was now half ru in d 5 the Garden had a fmall Brook, with ftruftures of Foun tains and fuch like things, but all out of order, and referving no other beauty befides a great number of Orange-Trees,planted regularly, and of equal height, and making a goodly and de licious Grove. I difcours'd with the faid Sig: Aluife^ and Jic feem'd an intelligent Perfon 5 but becaufe he was fick, or at leaft recovering, and (b weak that he could fcarce lpeak 3 1 could not benefit by him as Idefir'd. I afk'd him concerning Cddmid and its fpecies, and other Minerals, which you writ me word that you defir'd from Cyprus, and I accordingly (ent to timfa (the chief City of the lOand, and the place of the Baflia's re- lidence)^ as alfo concerning the Book of Galen, He told me, there was feme at this day, but 'twas hard to meet with any that knew it,or could tell where to find it, the people being very Ideots, and the Mines intermitted heretofore by the Chrifti- ans, for fear of alluring the Turks thereby to invade the Ifland, as alfo fince by the Turks through ignorance. After this and luch other Difcourfe, we returned to Larnaca by a different road, about the midft whereof we found another Village, call'd A/m- go &gt; but all thefe Villages in former times well peopled, are now ajmolt wholly deftroy'd and uninhabited. I I. the ninth. Being return'd to the Ship, the next day I took the height; ot the Sun with ray Aftrolabe in the Port deUd Saline of Cyprus, and found him decline Southward from the Zenith 29 degrees, 29 minutes, 50 feconds.

September the thirteenth, 1 went afliore in the Morning to Larnaca again, irora whence, upon the Confuls inftance, I was accompany d by Sig: Gio FrancefcoParente, two other Venetians, a Greek nam d Alejer Manoli, my (ervantAZ/r/je/, and a Janizary tor our guard, to a delicious place of Devotion, call 'd by the Oieeks, Agia-Nappa, that is, Holy, about eight leagues from LarnacA,Into the EAST-INDIES. Larnaca^ upon the Eaflern Sea-coaft near Ca$o della. Greca^ where there is a Church built in a Grotto^ wherein a miraculous Image of our Lady was found. Having rid all day almoil: continually by the Sea-iide, we lodg'dat the Village Ormidia^ and the next day early, paffing through the Village and the Cape di San Georgia^ where many Ships^ efpecially Pyrats 5 ufe to put in for water at a River which falls into the Sea on the Eaft of the (aid Cape, we arrived at the Village Agio. Nappa, We found it like all the reft that I faw in Cj^pm^ almoft wholly deftroy'd 5 partly^ by the ordinary tyrannies of the Turks., partly, by the Peftilence which a few years before had fwept away moft of the people. The Church being built almoft likeii little fquare Caftle, (perhaps for fear of theJPyrats) is ftill ftanding ^ and being un der ground 3 is deicended into by many flairs. A Papas, or Greek Prieft;, who officiates there, hath charge of it, together with certain Calogrie, or Nunns, who having renounced the world, have addicted themfelves to God's Service, and are mode ft! y cloth'd in black, though they be not Reclufes. In the middleof a great Court or Yard, ftands a marble Fountain not ill built, over which they have lately built a great Cupola, upon four Pilafters with feats round about, where we not onely entertain d our felves all day, but flept at night ^ the murmur of the water rendringthe place fufficiently pleafant. The next Morning, Mafs was fung in the Church after the Greek Rite, and I was prefent at it till the end of the Gofpel. On one fide of the Church in a place apart, is an Altar, where our Latine Priefts (ay Mais when any comes thither. In fumm, the Church is an indifferent large Grotto jkt Image ancient, and the Altar adorn'd after the Greek manner, without any thing elfe remarkable. Here we eat a great quantity of Becca-ficht^ or Fig-fnappers, ( a fort of Birds call'd by the Greeks Sicalidia ) which are fo plentiful in Cyprus, that abundance of them are fentfows'd in Vinegar to Vttiicc and elfe-where 5 but thofe ztJgia Nappa fome- times are not good, by reafon of their having eaten Scammony, which is not known to be found there-abouts, bur probably, they feed upon it in fome other place. September the fixtecnth. We departed from JgiaNappa to re turn to Larnaca, and paffing through the Village we alighted there to fee the Church oiSan C?/^rg/&lt;?,wherein amongfi: other Saints, I faw one painted whom they c2X\AgiosMapeas 9 that is, San Mama, much venerated by the Greeks 5 who fay. He was a Martyr , and bury'd in Cyprus but I know not accordingt o whatHiftory, rhey paint him between a Horfe and a Lyon. September 17 th Returning a Ship-board, by the way I vifited a Church of the Greeks, ( bat heretofore ot the Armenians) call d, S. Lazaro, fome of the ftones whereof I oblerv'd engraven with Armenian Letters : 3 Tis a very ancient ftone-ftruchireof an ex travagant form, though us'd by the Greeks in fundry places, Pp namely.fhe fravels Peter Dells \ alle^ namely, confiftbg of 3 Nave's or Hies, fupportedonely by4Pil^ afters 3 with three Cupola's on a row in the middle Nave^the place within ainongft the Pillafters ferving for men, and that round about for women by themfelves. Behind the Altar they (hew a Subterranean Sepukhre, like a little Grotto, and enter'd into by a fquare hole like that of a Tomb 5 they fay it was the Sepulchre o£Lazarus rais 'd by Chrift 5 and that he built the Church whilft he was Bifhop here, and at laft dy'd here 5 from whence his Body was afterwards tranfported fir ft to Confiantinofle^ andtheoto Marfcilles : The truth whereof, they affirm, is prov'd bythe Miracles done every day in the faid Sepulchre, as healing the Tick, and the like 5 but this is repugnant to the Hiftory we have in the Breviary, Martyrologie, &amp;c. September the twentieth, The Conful gave me a piece of Ltd*- nO'Vergine, that is, pure, without any other mixture^ as it comes naturally i whereof there is plenty in Cyprus ; and fome intelli gent perlbns of the Country whom I confulted purpofdy, told mc, 'tis generated of the Dew which falls from Heaven, juftas Manna is, and that'tis gather'd off the leavs of a plant no higher then a fpan and half, ortwofpans^ which matter they boyle, and being vifcid like wax, form into rolls like little Candles, which they wrap afterwards round together. The faid LaJd- num is black, hath a good quick Aromatical SmeU 5 and, in out Countries, mixt with other things , makes a good Perfume, and, perhaps, ferves for Medicinal Ufes 5 as you kriow very well. t j s , September the one and twentieth, Sig:C/V4c/jgave me fomeof theftone^M»fi/J, a fort of ftonethat may be fpun, of which the Ancients made the Cloth which, they fay, was incombuftible, and the fire onely cleans d it, as water doth other Linnen 5 in which Cloth they burnt dead bodies, and fo preferv'd the alhes thereof from being mingled with thofe of the vyood. At this day none knows how to make the Cloth, or to fpin the matter 5 although a whitilh matter like Cotton is clearly feen to iffue out of the ftone, not uncapable of being fpun. The colour of the Stone, whenintire, isgreeniQi, inclining to black, but fhining enough, almoft like Talk 5 yet when tis broken or Ipun, the matter that iffues out of it is white. 1 remember I once faw fomeof this Stone, and the Cloth woven thereof, in the Study of Ferrante Imperato at Naples, amongft other Curiofities. the twenty fourth, TheConlul invited us to dinner in the Venetian Ship where we ftay'd not onely to dine, butalfoto lleep all-night, being entertained with Mu- fick, and the good converfation of Sig; Parente, Flatro^O* Rocco Andreani, who were there. The next day, we returned to our own Ship, and the Evening following I went alhore again. A new man was expefted to come to govern the Ida nd, theoldbeing already departed upon the arrival ofan Officer of the new, who, as their cuftom is, was come with the Title of Mujjekm^ to pre pareInto the I!

Thefe fudden arid unexpefted changes of Minifters, have many years ago begun to be pradis'd in the Court of Confiantinofle^ occafion'd chiefly by the ill Government, and the felling of thofe Offices, withoutany limitation of time, to who-ever gives moft 5 which diforders are more prevalent now then ever : Which I mention, that it may be known in what an ill State the Common-wealth of the Turks is at this day 4 which indeed feems to be tending of its accord to manifeft ruine. September the eight and twentieth. After another treatment given us by the Conful in the Ship of Viaro, he accompany'd us in the Evening to our Caravel, which was to fet faii forth-withj and there,with many Complements and expreffionsof Courtefie^ wetook leave one of another 5 the Conful returning aftiore, and we remaining in the Shi p.

And being it was yet early, I walk'd about the Town, which is of indifferent bignefs, where I Taw zgrezt Mefchita of the Turks ftanding in a goodly ftreet near the (hore, where 1 faw great plenty of Carmbes , or Capers, where-with whole Ships are laden from hence for Venice and other parts. More within the Towr, I faw the Caftle which is fmalljof a round form, reprelent- ing rather alow thick Tower or Turret then a Fortrefs, yet it hath fome fmall pieces of Artillery, and is built of flone.

I received much news of them con cerning ibme of my friends at A^/ejand elfewhere, after which they departed, giving me hope, that in a Councel to be held that day about other weighty affairs of the Religion, my Ex pedition fhould be taken into confideration.

The reafon whereof I flip pole was, either becaufe the ifolctto where Ships P a ^ 1 ^ Quarantine was already fullofother people,or becaufe the llland ♦/ he Travels of Peter Delia Valle, was ibarce of provifion, and therefore they would not ad mit other new Pallengers to confume it. However we, ac cording to our licence^ landed all our goods at the abovelaid place 5 and we were no fooner got aftiore, but My Lord, theln- quifitor came in a Boat to vilit me at the Sea-fide. We difcours'd together above half an hour f, he in his Boat 3 and I upon the bank. He inquir'd of me feveral things concerning the affairs of the Eaft, and inform'd me of many of Europe 5 and at laft offering me his favour in all things, particularly, in getting 'the Qyaran- tine fhortned, which he intimated would laft forty days or more (including thofe which had pafs'd by the way from hither) departed, and I rcpair'd tothe houfe, which the owner of it, and the Captain of the Fort, Defiderio^ came to aflign to me, where all our Goods were fprcad abroad to be air'd in a large open room belonging to the faid houfe 5 which indeed I found very handfom and well provided with convenience of water, and other things 5 having a delicate profped upon the Port, the Sea, the Country] the 1 own, the new City, and, in (horr, being the beft, moft convenient and delightful that we could have had for that pur- pofe. By the Council's order a man was afiign'd to guard the , Houfe, and a Boat both to guard us, and to fupply us with pro- vifions 5 both at our charge,- as the cuftom is. Nor doth the Captain of the Port omit to vifit us frequently, and to difcourfe with us at a diftance. God be thanked, we are all wdl, and free from all contagious fufpition 5 ib that I hope to furraount this difficulty happily, which I acknowledg to proceed from the Di vine Providence, to which I heartily commend you.

November the thirteenth. My Lord the Inquifitor came to vifit nle j and difcours'd with me about an hour without the Gate 5 for feeing we had no Licence of Prattick 3 it was not law- 4 full for me to give him fo much as a Chair out of my Houfe. He promised me to fpeak to the Grand Mafter the fame day, and to procure our expedition. November the fixteenth. In the Morning before dayj three of thefaid Gallies fet fail from Malta towards Licata, or A lie at a in Sicily^ to fetch Corn ? whereof there was great penury. The fourth Galley was (bold that it could go no more toSea 3 and the new which were preparing at Malta^ Palermo, andNaples, inftead of thofe that had been loft, were not yet finiftl'd. After dinner^ the Commiffioners of Health return'd again to fee my Goods, bringing with them a Phyfitian to view and make rela tion of the Coffin wherein they underftood I carry'd the Body ofsitti Maani 5 but becaufe the ball of Cotton yarn wherein it was wraptwas not quite loofned for fear of fpoyling, though I had open'd and air'd it, they not onely refus'd to give me Prattick, but would not fuffer the Phyfitian to touch or view the feid Coffin, and told me, I muft firft loofen and air the Cotton yarn well, and then they would return to us another day to re- folve about Prattick. After which they made many excules to me for this ftrange treatment, alledging that the fubfiftence of Malta depending upon other parts abroad, they werefore'd to ufe the moft rigorous courfes in cafe of fulpition of Infedion 5 to the end Sicily and the other Countries, on which their fub fiftence depended, might not deprive them of Prattick, as they would eafily do, were it known that they proceeded otherwife, and were too eafie in admitting fufpefted things which came from the Levant.

Before dinner, we enter'd the Port of Syracnfe, where Sig: Fra: Marcantonio fericentato Receiver of the Order of Malta^ came prefentlyto our Galley to vifit the Captain, and take his Letters and Orders of bufinefs. By this Knight, without making my felf known to him ? I undcr- ftood that my great Friend, Monfignor Faolo Faraone^ Biftiop of Syracufi) being lately return'd from a vifitation was now in the City 3 of which I was very joyful, through the great defire I had to fee him. Wherefore after dinner I went afhore as all others did, and with Sig: Frate Antometto Cojia a Roman, prefently repair'd to his Palace to vifit him: But underftandinghe was faying the Office,and would not be difturb'dj ftay'd in the Anti- chamber till he had done, being entertain'd in the mean time by Sig: Paolo Faraone his Nephew, whom I had feen at Mejpna, in the year 16 n, then a very Youth, but now grown a compleat young man 5 yet I did notdifcover my felf to him. When the Biftiop had ended the Office, we enter'd to kifs his hands 3 At firft view, he faid, he thought he knew me, but rememberd not who I was 5 and, indeed, he knew me not by my voice after I had fpoken to him , although I knew both his voice and perfon, he leeming to me little or nothing chang'd from what I left him at Rome about twelve years ago when he was an Abbot. But when I difcover'd my ielf to him, he feem'd amaz'd, and with much joy, for feeing me here at a time when he thought 1 was far enough oil, and, perhaps, ( as he faid ) not in this world, (tor twas four years fince he had heard any News of me ) he receiv d me with extream lj.indne(s and gladnefs. After we had given one another account of many things, and I had been com plemented by Sig: fW/0 his Nephew, and others that v/ere with him, I told him that I had in the Galley Batoni Mariam Twatin, my ipiritual Oaughterjand fhould be glad that before we depart- ed, (as I thought to do with the fame G allies far JMejfin a) that ihe faw the Church and fomething of Syracuse. The Biftiop prelently lent Signer a Maria f his Brother's Wife, and Mother ot Sig: iWfl ) with two of her Daughters to fetch my Women rom tne Galley in a Coach 5 and Sig: Paolo*, the Receiverof Malta and my felf, went in another Coach to fetch them on Land. After thefe Gentlewomen had receiv'd them with many Complements, we all went together to the Nunns Church of o. where we ftay'd till evening 5 the Nunns being much de lightedInto the EAST-INDIES. 301: Mttti, lighted to behold the ftrange habits of my Women, and to d}£ courfe with them by Interpreters. In the mean time inahy peo ple flock'd into the Church to fee them 3 and feveral Cavaliers came to complement me, and make themfelves known to me. It being late, we were accompani'd by many Gentry and people to the Palace, where my Women were received by the Blftiop with much Courtefie. And being the Galleys were to depart for Mefsinathis very night, I defir'd leave of the Bifhop to return aboard again, but he would by no means grant it 5 faying that fince I was come to fee him, it was not fit that I (hould embitter his joy with fo fudden a departure, much lefs when S. Lucys day was fo near at hand, for which thofe that are remote ufe to go to Sjracufe , and that I was the moreoblig'd to ftay, becaufe I had once promis'd him by a Letter, (as indeed I had) to come to Syracufe^ and fpend zS, Lucfs day with him 3 fo that fince chance had brought it thus to pafs, I muft needs make my word good. I anfwer d many things, and did all I could to get away, but to no purpofe 5 for the Bifhop fen the Receiver to get all my goods out of the Galley, for which end was neceflary for the gate of the City to be kept open a good part of the night contrary to cuftom : and belides, having caus'd a very noble Apart ment to be got ready for me in the new building of his Pa lace, he would by all means have us all lodge there. Where fore, feeing his pleafure was fuch, I thought fit to obey him, and accept the favour. The Gentlemen and Gentlewomen after fbmedifcourfe departed, and we were conducted to our apart ment, whcre ,becaufe the Bifliop eats not at night, he left us to flip and reft.

IN continuation of my laft to you concerning the favours I re- ceiv'd from my Lord the Bifhop of Syrucuje^ I muft tell you in thefirft place, that on the fifth of December we were conduced by a great company of Gentry of both Sexes out of the City to feveral reliques of ancient Syracufe* We faw the Artificial Echo reported to have been made hyDionyjhts in aPrifbn where he kept many flaves, to hear what they talkt within 5 and, if I miftake not, Archimedes feems to have been the contriver of the Fabnck. Tis h ::M iM 1 if ■ i I ! lii rThe travels Peter Delia Vallc, Tis indeed one of the goodlieft pieces of Art that I ever faw in the world, and perhaps was ever invented, imitating nature fo exaftly that the Echo returns words, fentences, founds 3 and fongs moft intire and perfed, as was prov'd in our prefence with fun- dry Inftruments. If a man ftrike a thick extended cloth with a wand 3 it renders a found like the (hot of Artillery : which to be done fo well in a Grotto form'd not by Nature, but by Art, is indeed a ftrange thing, and (hews a prodigious wit in the Con triver. I muft not omit, that the roof of this grotto is hollow'd in the form of a man's ear, from which probably the Artificer borrow'd the Invention, fince jufl: as the voice (hiking the cars which arefo (hap'd renders the found audible &gt; fo tis leen by ex perience, that this great artificial Ear cut by hand in hardftonC;, being ftruck in like manner produces the fame effedt of augment ing a found 5 although we know not but other Natural Echoes in Caves are fram'd after the fame manner. Near the place of the Echo, we faw the fubterranean Cavities wherein the Haves were imprifon'd, and over them the place of Palace, in a very goodly (ituation, with a Profped extending far both on Land and Sea. And near the Palace we beheld many remainders of his great Theater,which was not built up like other Strudures but cut and hollow'd out of the hard flone, all of a piece, very large and of excellent Architefture. As we rcturn'd home, we faw contiguous to the City on one fide the Port which they call'd MATmoreo^ or the Marble Port, from its being built all of Stone and differing from the other great one which lies under the City on the other (ide 5 for at this day the City (lands wholly in the Peninfula Ortygia, which is almoftfurrounded by the Seajfaving where it joyns to the Land by a narrow Euripus. December 8 tb ,I accompani'd the B p to the Church of S.Fnwor, whither becaufeit was the Feaftof the Conception he Went to hear Mafs, being attended by the Senate, and all the Nobility of the City. After which, I went with divers Gentlemen my Friends to fee the Church of S.

December the twelfth. Being S. Lucie s EvCj Solemn Vefpers were fung in her Church, whither the Biftiop with the Senate . and all the Nobility repair'd. At night bone-fires were made, and a Cavalcade of many Cavaliers rode about with Torches, but cloth'd in their ordinary habits &gt; after whom follow'd the Senate likewife on Horfe-back. December the thirteenth^ Being the day of S. Lucie the Patro- neft of Syracuje, a folemn Proceffion was made, wherein the Images ot the Saint in Silver, as big or bigger then the life, were carry'd through the chief ftreets upon a goodly Pedeftal of (il ver, all the Clergy and Nobility accompanying the fame.The Procef- lion fet forth from the Cathedral, and as the H. Image came out of the Church-Gate, a certain man plac'd purpofely on the top of the Steeple, came flying down ('as theyfpeakj upon a rope and fell in the mid ft of thePiazza,which was throngd with people aflembled to fee the Shew. The Proceflion ended at the Church of S.

December the fourteenth. Many Races were run both by Foot men, Mules, ordinary Horles, and Barb or Ginets as they call them in Syracufe, with the ufual circumftances of throngs of people. Ladies at the^indows. Gentlemen on Horie-back, and in Coaches about the ftreets. December the fifteenth, A Mafcherade of twelve Cavaliers on Horfe-back, cloth'd by couples after feveral fafhions, went about the City. In the Piazza before the Bilhops Palace they ran al Saraceno^ ( i. e. at a wooden ftock made like a Man \ we call it a Turk ) and at the Ring, making many Caracols(or quick TurnsJ at the end. Which divertifement continu'd till night 5 when the Malkers were entertain'd with a fumptuous Supper by the Biftiop, together with the Senate and other Cavaliers. December the lixteenth , In the Morning I went to view the jj j Fountain Arethuja, which I had feen imperfedly many years before at my firlt being in Sicily. Tis in a Grove within the walls of the City, where iiiuing out of a cavernof a Hill, it de- fcend§ to the Sea -fide,forming an indifferent Pool before its going out of the walls, where the Syracufian Women ufe to go to waib their Clothes. In the afternoon going out of the City, to fee many courfes at the Ring in the field of S.

Thefe are Lapidicint, or Stone-Quarries, where the Athenian Prifoners were put, who after the lots of many battels both by Land and Sea, at laft yield ed at Syracuse, as Thncydides relates. Dernier the twentieth, TheBifhop made an Ordination ac cording the cuftom of Four times of the year, and this Morn ing ordain'd above two hundred perfonsof feveral Orders, for this Diocefs is fufficiently populous 5 and many,to avoid the ni&gt; merous grievances impos'd upon the Ring's people, willingly put themfelves into the Church. ; December the one twentieth, Another Proceflion like the former was made in the Evening, wherein the facred Image of S. Lucie was carry'd from her own Church, where it had bem till now, to the Cathedral, in which it is ufually kept inalittl- Chappel well guarded, and lock'd with many keyes. When the Image was come thither, and the Bifhop ftandingatthe Altar, tirft fhewM the Magiftrate, and'then the People the Reliques of the Saint, (to wit, a dark blew Mantle, and a Slipper like that of the Pope) holding the fame to them to kife, and diftributing Cotton to them which the faid Reliques had touch'd. After which the Bilhop entertain'd the Senate with a Supper. December the two and twentieth. The two ^//ejd-Gallies de parted for Malta, and the next Evening the General of Mdltn return'd to Syracufe for more provifion, the Hland of Malta being in great want thereof. December the four and twentieth. The faid General ftiip'dall the Corn he could pofiibly, as well by Health as openly, (^becauie he had not Licence forfo much) and in the Evening fet fail for Malta, He informed us that the Prior of the Church was com-' ing Ambaliador extraordinary to the Pope, in order to pacitie his Holinels who was much otiended at certain things which they had lately done ill at Alalta : Whereof I fhall give you this brief account. A while (ince two or three Commendams of Malta, becoming void by the death of a Commendator, who held them all toge ther, m Ha;Into the EAST -INDIES. 3 0 5 ther5the Pope joyn'd themanto a new Priorate 3 and gave the (ame to Sig: Don Antonio Earhenno his Nephew. Hereupon the Order took diftaft that the Pope fhould give thefe Commendams to his NepheWj in prejudice of the Ancients who pretended to them, and making a great ftir (as if the Pope were not Patron of their goods, as well as thofe of all other Orders) they tumultuoufly ' refolv'd to fend AmbafTadors to the Emperor^ and to the Kings of France and Spain to complain thereof^ and to intreat thefaid Princes to undertake their Proteftion that the Pope might not do them fuch Prejudices. This coming ro the Pope's Ears 3 he commanded Monfig: Vifconti his Inquifitor at Malta, to endea vor the hindring of thofe Embaffies 5 and, in cafe ofobftinaey, to prohibit them by a Publick Aft in the Name of his Holinefsj admonifhing the Order that they had no other Superior befides the Pope, and ought not to recurr to any about tfheir affairs but to him* The Inquifitor us'd his utmoft diligence, but feeing it prevail'd not, he caus'd the Pope's Prohibition to be fignifi'd to the Ambaflador's Eled, by a fit Minifter. One or two of them made no ftir , but another fell into fuch a rage that he drew a Ponyard to aflfault the Inquifitor's Officer that gave him the Intimation : After which all the Knights banded together^, and went tumultuoufly to the Grand Mafterj who was then in the Church at Vefpers, and by furious menaces of a notable fedition, caus'd him to fend fbme Grand CrofTes to defire the Inquifitor to revoke the faid Prohibition, otherwife a very great tumult and the ruine of the Order would enfue. The Inquifitor, mov'd with this and other effeftual Inftances which they made to him not without tumult, faid 5 He had no Authority re-call a Pro hibition made by the Pope 5 but, to prevent further mifchiefs, he condefcended to revoke the faid Order, fo far as his own Au thority (which he judg'd none at all in this matter) could ex tend: Whereupon the Ambaffadors prefently departed.The Pope vmderftanding thisfequel, gave the ^/fe/e-Ambaflador refiding at Rome a great check, and teftifi'd fo great difpleafure with the Order, that the Ambaflador himfelf, who, perhaps, had been the firft caufeof thefe Tumults at Malta, by writing to the Knights there to defend their caufes refblutely 5 that he now writ after a different manner, and fo reprefented both to the Grand Mafter and the Order, the Pope's difpleafure, and what mifchief he might do them 5 That being terrify'd there-with they fent Pofts after their Ambafladors to return , without negotiating at all with the faid Princes. Some of them , who were not yet arriv'd at the places whither they were fent 5 upon this Order return'd back without doing any things others, who were arriv'd at the Courts of the defign'd Princes, obtain'd their Letters of recommendation to the Pope, which were of little moment 5 but ever fince this bufinefs, the Pope hath had but little good will towards the Order,and hath frequently declar'd a purpofe to reform it in fundry things : As, that no Women R r (houldThe Travels of Peter Delia Valle, ' ' ' 1 ** ^d^e^thene^Ck^ call'd il Convent o, their Simoniacal Elections of Grand Matters 5 and other things, of which the F nights were much afraid. To thefe old difgufts, another hath lately been added : Upon the lofs of their Galhes taken by the Turks a while agoe 3 with the (laughter of many Knights, the Order for repairing the fame, thought, (and, I believe, hadal- ready Wolv'dJ tolayaGabel, (^whether perpetual or tempo, ral I know not) upon the Commendams and Pofleflions of the Order ^ which, without the Pope's leave, could not be done. * The Pope extreamly dillik'd this courle, conceiving no rieceflity of attempting it for that lofs 5 fince they had loft no thing but two pieces of wood ^ and as for the Knights, they might be recruited by the income of moneys which are paid upon the admittance of others to take the Crofs ^ befides that as to intereft, they had rather gain'd then loft, having by the death of fo many Knights, gotten fpoyls enough to pay the charge pretended, without burdening the ^pofleffions of the Ordei with any impofition. All which Reafons confider'd, the Pope hearing that they were refolv'd to impole the faid Gabel without addrefling to him, became extreamly difpleas'd with the Knights, threatning them with Excomunications and other punHhments: Whereupon the Order difpatch'd this Prior of the Church, (who is alfo a Grand Crofs and a PrieftJ Ambafladot extraordinary to his Holinefs, to pacific him.

January the thirteenth. Four Maltefe-Galleys arriv'd at Syra- cujc 5 and becaufe they intended for Mefsina, and one of them for Naples, and perhaps further, to carry the Prior of the Church, who, astfaid, was going extraordinary Ambaflador to Rome, and washereimbarqu'd; I defir'd to take the opportunity of thefe Galleys to Mefsina:^ accordingly went to fpeak with the General, who was gone a hunting with the Prior of the Church near the River Alfeo. The General courteoufly granted me paflage in his own Ship to Mefsina : but as for going to Naples in the Galley with the faid Prior, I could not obtain this favour from him : and though his excufe was, that but one Galley went thither, and that with many Paffengers,and my people and goods were not few 5 yet I perceiv'd that the Prior, on whom the cour- telie depended (although he had been my Friend at Malta, and Ihew'd himfelf fuch here alfo) was unwilling to grant me the fame, becaufe I lodg'd in the houfe of the Biftiop, with whom the Prior was difpleasd, becaufe the Biftiop had neither vifited him, nor yet the General of the Galleys, as they pretended he ought to have done: but the Biihop pretended the contrary, namely, that they ought to have vifitcd him firft 5 fo that be tween the punftilio's of both fides, I wasfain to fufFer an incon venience, as it commonly happens in fuch cafes. However I re- folv'd not to decline the General's offer of palling to Mefsina in thefe Galleys, and accordingly taking leave of the Bifhop, and all other Friends after fupper, I went aboard of the Generals Galley with my people, and at the fecond watch we fet fail. The winds being contrary we could not pafs furthef then Augujla, where we anchor'd a little without the Port, but becaufe we did not falute the City, fin regard we ftood off from it, and were upon departing^ a great Gun was difcharg'd from thence againft us with a bullet. Which though the General was offend ed at, yet becaufe there was nothing elfe to be done, he fent a Spanifti Gentleman of his Order to make excufe to the Governor for not having faluted him, (as not being the cuftom in fuch oc- cafions) and to complain of his (hooting with a bullet in that manner.

The Pope, as I conceive, apprehending their drift, prefently anfwer'd, that without a good Bill he would not accept of the Gennet, nor do that prejudice to the Apoftolical Chamber 5 wherefore if the Bill wefe not in otder, they (hould return back with the Gennet, and bring both together the next Morning. The Ambaffador made fuit to have the Gennet re- ceiv'd preiently, promifing that the Bill ftiould be ready (peedily. The Pope reply'd, that if Sig: Marcello Sa-tchtiH , Brother of Card: f*,who kept thepublick accounts of the Exchequer, and was then near the Pope, would take fccurity from the Am baffador, he would be contented 5 but he neither commanded thefaid Sig; Mar cello to take it, nor would have him take it for his fake 5 but he might do it, if he pleased at the Ambaiiadors re- queft.

Thefe Tortoifes increafe by eggs (as 1 have been often told) are very good to eat, the fubftance within them (whether you will call it flefh or filh) firft boyled, and after minced with butter, taftes like buttered Veal. Their (hell makes (as is very commonly known) excellent good Combs, Cups, or Boxes, and further it isufed by them in £aji~ Jndia^ to make or adorn little or great Cabinets. ^T he Dolphin is a fifh called,for his fwittnefsj The Arrow ofthe Sjpja, differing in this one particular, from all other fifties I ever obferved, in that he hath many little teeth upon the top of his tongue 5 He is very pleafing to the eye, fmell, andtaftej of a changeable colour,finn*d like a Roach, covered with many fmall Icales, having a frefti delightfom fcent above other fifties, and in tafte as good as any ^ thefe Dolphins are wont often to follow our Imps, not fo much 1 think for the love they bear unto man (as fome write,) as to feed themfelves with what they find caft over-board: whence it comes to pafs, that many times they feed us, for when they fwimclofetoour fhips, we often ftrike them with a broad inftrument, full of barbs, called an 'Harping-iron faftned to a rope, by which we hale them in.

After this fellow was returned, it made the Natives moft fhie of us when we arrived there 5 for though they would come about us in great Companies when we were new come thither, yet three or four days before they conceiv'd we would depart thence, there was not one of them to be feen, fearing belike we would have dealt with fome more of them, as formerly we had done with Cooret. But it had been well if he had not feen Eng land^ for as he difcovered nothing to us, fo ipertainly when he came home, he told his Country-men (having doubtlefs obferved fo much here) that Brafs was but a bafeand cheap commodity in England, and happily we had fo well ftored them with that met* tal before, that we had never after fuch a free Exchange of our Brafs and Iron for their Cattel.

Upon the firft fight off hat Shrpj we were all glad of the objed, improving all endeavours we could to overtake her, with-all preparing our great Grdnante, that if (be were a FmW we might falute her, if an Enemy be in readinef? for her.

And though all wou ld not , yet all muft. A little before night that prefent day, the Caraque departed again to Sea ^ we all loofed owv Anchors, opened our Sailes, and followed. The day now left us, and our proud Adverfary un willing as it fhould feem to efcape, put forth a light (as beforej for us to follow him, (as afterward we did to purpole). The night well-nigh (pent, we commended again our felves and caufe to God, when I ob(erved more (eeming devotion in our Sea-nten that Morning, than at any time before, or after while F kept them company 5 who, for the generality are fuch a kind of People that nothing will bow them or bring them on their knees, but extream Hazards .When this exercife was ended ? the day began to appear in a red mantle, which prov'd bloody unto many that be held it. And now we entred upon a fecond encounter, our four Ships refolving to take their turns one after the other, that we might compel this proud Portugal either to bend Or break. And now Reader thou mayeft fuppofe us fpeaking again to our Adverfary, and he to us, in the harflieft and lowdeft of all Dia- le&amp;si, no Arguments being fo ftrong asthofethat proceed from the mouths of Guns, and points of Swords, Our Charles the Admiral played her part firft, and ere (he had been at defiance with her Enemy half an hower, there came another great (hot from him, which hitting againft one of our Iron Pieces, mount ed on our halfD^4 5 brake into many little parts , which moft dangerouily wounded our N qw Contntander, and the Matter of^ our Ship, with others befide, who received feveral hurts by it. Captain Peprve'lls left Eye, by a glance of a Piece of that broken Bullet, wasfb 'lorn that it lay like Raggs upon his Cheeks another hurt by a piece of the fame Bullet he received on his Jaw-bone $ and by another, on his Head &gt; and a fourth hurt, he received in his leg, a ragged piece of that broken (hot fticking faftA Voyage to EAST-INDIA, &amp;c. faft betwixt the two bones thereof, grating there upon an Arte- f ry, which feemed by hh complayning to afflid him fo much 3 ' ' that it made him take very little notice of all the reft of his ^ Hurts^ it being moft true of bodily pains^ that the extremity of a greater pain will not fuffer a Man much to feel and complain of that which is lefs 5 as that tormenting pain of the Tooth-ack^ makes a man infenfibleof the akingof his Head 5 and when the Gout and Stone furprize the Body at once together, the tor* ture by the Gout is as it were loft in the extremity of the Stone, t ^ And thus was our New Commander welcomed to his Autho- h rity 5 we all thought that his wounds would very fuddenly have Cr ^' made an end of him, but he lived till about fourteen moneths ' ^ after, and then dyed as he was returning for England, I told you before, that this man fuffered not alone by the fcattered pieces of that broken fhot 3 for the Malier of the shty had a great piece of the Brawn of his Arm ftrook off by it, which made him like- wife unferviceable for a time, and^r^e other of the common failers received (everal and dangerous hurts by it likewife. The Captain and Mafter both thus difabied, deputed their Authority to the chief Mafter's mate, who behaved himfelf re- folutely and wifely 3 fb we continued one after the other, (hooting at oiir Adverfary as at a But^ and by three of the Clock in the Afternoon had (hot down her Main-maji by ttie board, her her Fore -top -Maft : And moreover, had iriade fuch breaches in her thick fides, that her cafe feemed fo de- fperate that (he muft exthtvyield or ferijh.

He waved us with another, upon which M r Connick^ our ^ c chief Merchant imployed in that fervice came up to them, and being invited, entred their Ship, where he was civilly ufed5 and there he delivered this MeHage to the chief Commander^ and his Company, that he had brought them Life and Feace^ if they would accept it 5 withall telling them, that they had deferved fo well by their undaunted valour, that they would put them- felves into our hands, they fhould be entertain'd with all Honour and Helped. How the ordinary fort in xhzCaraque were taken with this proffer, I know not 5 yet all this would not work upon that high-refolv'd Commander&gt; who like Fahricius in Tully could not be turn'd, in the leaft meafore, from his former and firtt Re- folutiort.

Now after that himfelf and Camrade had feen what they defired in and about Jerufalem, they took their leave of thofe Francifcans, leaving with them money to recompence thecour- tefie they had received from them 5 the Fryers being very poor, and conlcquently, unable to entertain them freely without re quitals. From hence they took their way to take a view of the Sea, Cfo called, either becaufe the water therein isftill, and moves not 3 or bccaufe no living Creature is in it, and nothing thrives on the banks thereof) the place where and Go- worrah, and Admah and Zeboim once ftood, thofe Cities which Almighty God overthrew in anger, andrepented not, Jer. 20. 16. Hence they went to have a fight of the River Jordan, which dif- chargeth it felf into that moft uncomfortable/^^and from hence they journeyed through thofe ^ fr-itar,(which for the tmotSolomon were rent from his Son Rehohoam) till theycame to Mount Ubanus, Thence back to Sidon, which retaineth that Name ftill. And here he told me, as his laft obfervation made in that Land of Canaan, fometimes (like the Garden of the Lord) flowing with mill^ and honey, being then enriched with a very greatA Voyage to E A S T-I' N DI A, &amp;c&gt; great variety, and abundance of Gods good Creatures \ and in the dayesof D^^/fo populous, that there werenumbred ink at one time thirteen hundred thou fund fighting men , 2 Sam. 24.9, befides Women and Children, and others untit to draw fwords 5 which was a moft wonderful thing to confider that fuch a fpot of ground in comparifon , not above one hundred and fixty miles in length,from Dan to Berfieba^nd not above fixty miles in breadth, homjoppa to Jordan, fhould be able to bear and feed fuch a nu merous people^and now the very felf fame trad ofearth,either for want of manuring, or (which is rather to be conceived} for the want of the bleffing of Almighty God which once (hined r pon it, but is now long fince witb-drawn from it, (For a fruitful Land the Lord makes barren for the wickednefi of them that dwell therein, Pfal. 107.34.) is now become unable to luftain one in an hundred of fucb a number. v F rom Si don they got a pafi'age by Sea unto Alexandretta, now called Scanderoon (in the extreameft bottom of the Mediterra* nean Sea) which is one of the unwholfomeft places in the world 5 where I have often heard that no ftranger (that was born far from it) comes to continue there tor the fpace of one moneth 5 but is fure to meet with a ficknefs i which very often proves mortal. At this place his Englifh Companion left him, and turned his face towards England^ and he prefently took his way towards Aleppo in Syria, about feventy miles or more difbmt from Scanderoon, which is as much renowned for wholfomne(s 5 as the place before-named for being unwholfome ^ and therefore his called, fweet-airdAleppo. Here he being kindly received by the Englijh Conjul * ftayed a time to gain the company of a Caravan^ which confifts of a great mixt multitude of people from divers parts, which get and keep together travelling thole parts, for fear of the incurfions and vioiences by thieves and Murtherers, which they would undoubtedly meet withall, if they travelled (ingle, or but few together. With thefehe after fet forwards towards, and to that City anciently called Niniveh in Ajjyria, which we find in the Prophtfie of jonah was lome- times agreat and excellent City of three dayesjourney, Jonah 9. 3. but now fo exceedingly leilen d and lodg'd inobfcurity, that paflengCrs cannot fay of it, this was Niniveh 5 which now hath its old name changed, and is called Mozel. From hence they journied to Babylon in Chaldea, fituated upon the River Euphra tes, oncelikewife fb great that Arijiotle called it a Country, not a City, but now it is very much contraded, and'tis called ^ dxt. From this place they proceeded through both the niaes ^ and cither did, or elfe our Traveller was made to be lieve, that he faw the very Mountain whereon the-^r^. of Noah refied after the Flood, Gen.8. And from hence they went forward towards the Kingdom of Perfa, and there to Vzjpahdn# the ufual place of Refidence for that great King, then called r/ , Abbas^ oi King Abbas. And after they went to anciently 1 ' called 'il: hfM': fell f , i^r i it 1 f®—fll'llHi K^MKSSSn 35° V / A Voyage ^ E A S T-I N D I A, c^v. called shujhan, where the great King Ahajuerus kept his Royal and moft Magnificent Court, Efih.i. From hence they journied afterwards to Candahor, the firft Province North Eafl: under the fubjeftion of the Great Moghol, and fo to Lahore, the chief- eft City but one belonging to that great Empire, a place, as' I have been often told by Tom: Cory at and others, of very great trade, wealth, and delight, lying more temperately out of the Parching Sun than any other of his great Cities do: And to this City he wanted not Company ? nor afterwards to Agra, the MoghoVs Metropolis or chief City. r And here it is very obfervable that from Lahore to Agra it is four hundred Englifh miles, and that the Country betwixt both thefe great Cities is rich, even pleafant and flat, aCawpaniay and the rode-way on both fides all this long diftance planted with great Trees which are all the year cloathed with leaves, exceeding beneficial unto Travellers forthefhade they afford them in thofe hot Climes. This very much extended length of way'twixt thefe two places, is called by Travellers the Long Wa\, very full of Villages and Towns for Paffengers every where to find Provifion. At Agra our Traveller made an halt, being there lovingly re ceived in the Englifi Faftory, where he ftayd till he had gotten, to his Turhjjh and Morifco or Arabian Languages, fome good knowledge in the Perjtan and IndoBan Tongues, in which ftudy he was alwayes very apt, and ift little time fhewed much profi ciency. The firft of thofe two, the Perjtan, is the more quaint 3 the other, the Indian, the vulgar Language fpoken in Eafl-India: In both thefe he fuddenly got fuch a knowledge and maftery, that it did exceedingly afterwards advantage him in his Travels up and down the Mogols Territory 5 he wearing alwayes the Habit of that Nation, and fpeaking their In the firft of thefe, the Tongue, he made afterwards an Oration to the Great Mogol, bringing in that Story of the Queen of Sheba, 1 Kings 10. (in which parts of that Sacred Hiftory the Mahumetans have fome knowledge^ and he told him, that as the Qyeenof sheba having heard of the Fame of King Solomon, came from far to vifit him, which when fhe had done, (he confefled that though (he had heard very much of him, and many things beyond her belief, yet now feeing what (he did, acknowledged that fhe had not heard half of that which fhe now faw concerning the Wifdom, and Greatnefi, and Reti nue, and Riches of Solatoton : So our Orator told ihe Aiogol, that he had heard very much of him before he had the Honour to fee him (when he was very far offin his own Country) but now what he beheld did exceedingly furmount all thofie former Re ports of him which came to his Ears at fuch a diftance from him : Then larding his fhort fpeech with fome other pieces of Flattery, which the liked well,concluded ; And when he had done, the Mogol gave him one hundred Roopus, which amounts to the value If IN 1 : lllN !di:- IIIKotk value J Voyage to E A S.T-I N D I A, &amp;c. value o{ tmelve pounds and ten {hillings of our Engliih Money &gt; loddrigupon him as a Derveefe, Vorary or Pilgrim, (for fo he called him ) and fuch as bear that name in that Country feem not much to care for money 5 and that was the reafon ( I con ceive ) that he gave him not a more plentiful Reward. After this he having got a great maftery likewife in the Indo- Uan 3 or more vulgar Language, there was a Woman ^ a Landrefs, belonging to my Lord Embaffadors Houfe^ who had fuch a freedom and liberty of Speech, that Ihe would fometimes fcould, - brawl, and rail from the Sun^rifing to Sun-fet, One day he undertook her in her own Language, and by eight of the Clock in the Morning fo fikneedher^ that (he had not one word more to fpeak. I fhall haveoccafion to fay more of this man in fome paflages of this following Difcourfe, and therefore I (hall not wrap all I have to fp&amp;lk of him in this, although it be a verylqngdi- greffion ^ Yet becaufe I muft now (hortly bring you to hi^ ;our- nies end, I thaU take the freedom to enlarge my felf a little fur ther concerning him here in this place, fccfor^ lileave him for the prefen^ and to give thee. Reader, a piece of his CharaBer^ itfpeaks thus: . v ^ r . j \ , That he Was a man of a very coveting Eye, that could never he fatisfied with feeing, n&amp;Seleman fpoaks, Ecclef. t.B* though he had feen very much $ and I atii perfwaded that he took as much content in -feeing , as many others in the enjoying of Great and Rare things, ' He was- a man that had got the maftery of many hard Languages, (as befojelobferved) to the and C?r^ he brought forth of with him ^ in which, if he had ob tained ^ifdom to hufband and manage them, as he had (kill to fpeak thehi, he had deferved more Fame in his Generation. But his knowledge and high attainments in; feveral Languages made him not a little ignorant of himfelf 5 he being fo covetous, (b am-s bitious ofpraife, that he would hear andendure morjpi it than he could in any meafure defetve $ being like a Ship that hath too much -^i/, *and too little Ballatf : Yet if he had not fain into the fmart hands of the Wits of thofe Times, hemight havepaf- fed better. That itch of Fame which engaged this man to the undertakings of thofe very hard and long, and dangerous Tra^ vels, hath put.thoufands more (and therefore he was not alone in this) int6 ft range attempts onely to be talked of. Upon a time one M* Richard ^ee/ a Merchant, and fervant to , the Eaft-TnJ a Company^ came unto us from Surat to Mandoa^ the place tiien of the Algol's Refidence (of which place fome- ^vhat more hereafter ) at- which time M r Coryat- was there with lis : This Merchant had not long before travelled over-land from EaB-India through Verfia, and fo to Conjldntinople^ and fo for England'^ who in his Travel home-ward had met withT^w; Coryat, as he was journeying towards Eafl-India. M r Steel then told him 3 that when he Was in EngLtnd^ King James (then living) enquired /j, t/U*' ^ J*A Voyage fa E A S T-IN D1 A, &lt;&amp;€. enquired after him;, and when he had certified the King of his meeting him on the way 3 the King replyed. Is that Fool yet li* ving ? which when our Pilgrim heard, it feemed to trouble him very much., becaufe the King fpake no more nor no better of him., faying, that Kings would fpeak of poor men what they plealed. At another time when he was ready to depart from us 5 my Lord Emhaffador gave him a Letter., and in that a Bill to receive ten pounds at Aleffo when he (hould return thither: The Letter was directed unto M r Libbaus Chafmtn 5 there Confnl at that time, in which that which concerned our Traveller was thus: M T Chapman, when you (hall hand thefe Letters, I defireyouto receive the Beare r of them, Mafter Thomas Cory at with Courte- iie,for you (hall find him a very honeft poor Wretch j and further, I muft entreat you tofurnifh him with ten pounds, which (hall be repayed, 8cc. Our F/Z^r/^ lik'd the gift well, but the gnage by which he (hould have received it, did not at all content him, telling me. That My Lord had even fyoyled his Courtefie in the carriage thereof $ fo that if he ha d been a very Fool indeed, he could'have faid very little lefs of him than he did, Honeji poor IVretch ! And to fay no more of him, was to (ay as much as no- thing» And furthermore he then told me, that when he was for merly undertaking his journey to Venice, a Perfon of Honour wrote thus in his behalf unto Sir Henry Wotton^ then and there Embajfador : My Lord, Good Wine needs no Bufti, neither a wor thy man Letters Commendatory , becau(e whith^rfoever he comes he is his own Epiftle, 8cc. There ((aid he) was fome Lan guage on my behalf 5 but now for my Lord to write nothing of me by way of Commendation, but Honefl poor Wretch^ is rather to trouble me than to pleafe me with his favour. And therefore afterwards his Letter was phras'd up tOihismind, but he never liv'd to re ceive the money. By which his old acquaintance may fee how tender this poor man was to be touched in any thing that might in the leaft meafure dijparage him. O what pains this poor man took to make himfelf a Subject for preitnt and after Diicourfe ! being troubled at nothing for the prefent, unlefs with the fear of not living to reap that fruit he was To ambitious of in all his un dertakings. And certainly he was furprized with fome fuch thoughts and fears (for fo he told us afterwards) when upon a time he being at Mandoa with us, and there ftanding in a room againft a ftone fiUar, where theEmbaflador was, andmyfelf prefent with them, upon a fudden he fell iutofucha Jaww, that we had very much ado to recover him out of it 5 but at laft, comn to himfelf, he told us that fome fad thoughts had immedi ately before prefented themfelves to his Fancy^ which as he con ceived put him into that dijiemper 5 like Fannius in Martial Ne m or tare mori, to prevent death by dying : For he told us that there was great Expectations in England o£ the large Accounts * he (hould give of his Travels after his return home j and that he wasJ Voyage to EAST-INDIA, &lt;&amp;c. was now fhortly to leave us ^ and he being at prefent not Very wellj if he Ihould die in the way toward Snrat^ whither He Was now intended to go, (which place he had not yet feen)he might be buryed in Obfcurity, and none of his F rlends ever know what became of him j he travelling now, as he ufiially did 5 alone. Upon which my Lord willed to ftay longer with us 3 but he thank- folly refufed that offer, and turned his face prefently after to wards Suraty which was then about three hundred miles diftant from us,'and he lived to come fafely thither : but there being aver-kindly uled by fome of the Englifh who gave him Sac^ which they ha &lt;J brought from England, he calling foritasfoon as he firft heard of it, and crying, Sac^ Sacf^! Is there fuch a thing as I pray you give me fome Sack, And drinking of it y though I conceive, moderately, ( for he was a very tempe rate man) it increaled his Flux which he had then upon him 5 and:\ this cauied him within a few dayes after his very tedious and troubldome Travels ffor he went mpft on foot) at this place to come to his )ourneies end 5 for here he overtook Death Decemb. 1617. and was buried ('as aforefaid) under a little Ado- uument J like one of thofe ufoally made in our Church-yards. I now proceed to our former Difcourfe of the Defcription of the Great Megol's Territories : Which I fhall digeft into feveral Sections. /// / S E C T IO N I. Of the feveral PrCvinceSy the chief Cities, theFrin~ cipalKivers, the extent of this vajl Empire. THe moft fpacious Monarchy under the fubjedtion of the Great Mogol, divides it felf into thirty and feven feveral and large Provinces,which anciently were particular Kingdoms, whofe true Names (which we there had out of the MogoVs own Records^ with their Principal Cities and Rivers, their Situation znd Borders, their Extent in length and breath, I (hall firft fet down very briefly, beginning at the North-Weft. Yet as I name thefe feveral Provinces, I Qiall by the way take notice of fomc particulars in them which are moft Remarkable. 1. C and ah ore, the chief City fo called 5 it lyes from the heart of the &amp;6gol s Territories North-Weft 5 it confines with the Ring of Perjta, and was anciently a Province belonging to him- 2.

Haiacan, the Province of the Baioches, who are a very ftout and war-like people that dare fight. I infert this 3 becaufe there are infinite multitudes of people in the Mogols Territories who ap pear as likely as thefe,but fo low-lpirited (asl fliall after obferve) that they dare not fight. This Province hath no renowned City. The famous River fcall'd by the Inhabitants ^zW) bor ders it on the Eaft 5 and Lar^ a Province belonging to the King of Terfia, meets it on the Weft. 5 . Euckpr , the chief City called Buckpr-Snccor 5 that fa mous River Indus makes its way through it, and gently enrich- eth it* 6. Tattdy the chief City fo called ^ the River Indus makes many Iflands in it exceeding fruitful and pleafant, the Main Cur rent whereof meets with the Sea at Sindee &gt; a place very famou? for many curious Handicrafts. 7.

Chitor^ an ancient great Kingdom, the chief City fo cal led, which ftandeth upon a mighty high Hill flat on the top, walled about at the leaft ten Englifh miles. There appear to this day above an hundred ruined Churches, and divers fair Pa laces, which are lodged in like manner among their Ruines 3 befides many exquifite Pillars of Carved Stone 3 andthe Ruines likewife at the leaft of an hundred thoufand Stone-Houfcs, as many Englifh by their obfervation have ghrfied. There is but one afcent unto it, cut out of a firm Rock, to which a man muft pafs through four (fometimes very magnificent) Gates. Its chief inhabitants at this day are Ziim and ohim^ Birds and Wild Beafts 5 but the ftately Ruines thereof give a fhadow of its Beauty while itflouriQied in its Pride. It was won from Ranas^ an ancient Indian Prince, who was forc'd to live himfelf ever after in high mountainous places adjoyning to that Pro vince, and his Pofterity to live there ever fince. Taken from him it was by Achabar Padjha fthe Father of that King who lived and reigned when I was in thofe parts) after a very long fiege, which famiftied the beiieged, without which it could never have been gotten. 19. Guzarat, a Very goodly, and large, and an exceeding rich Province 5 it enclofeth the Bay of Cambaya ' x its chief City is Afftadavaz* , befides, it hath in it Cambaya^ Broaera^ Baroch, and Surat) fair Cities j but the firft of thofe I named, more fpacious, and populous, and rich, then any of the other. It is watered with many goodly Rivers, as that of Cambaya, (falfly fuppofed to be Indus) with the River Narbodah, (pafiingby Baroch^nd fo to the SeaJ with the River Taplee, which watereth Surat. The Mer chants which are the Natives of this Province trade to the Red Sea, to Acbin, and to divers other places. 20. Chandis, the chief City called Brampore, which is very ^ great, and rich, and full of people. Adjoyning to this Province lived a petty Prince,called Partapjha, tributary to the Adegol , and this is the moft Southernmoft part of all his Territories. 21.

It is very well watered by the River ^emm. This and Lahore are the two principal and choice Cities of thisEmpire 3 betwixt whom is that Long Walk, ( I made mention of before ) of four hundred miles in length, (haded by great Trees on both fides: This is looked upon by Travellers, \yho have found the comfort of that cool (hade, as one of the irareft and moft beneficial Works in the whole World. 25. Sanbat) the chief City fo called &gt; the River parts it from Narvar, and after at the City Hellaba^idWs into that moft- famous River Ganges, which is called by the Inhabitants of Eajt~ India, Ganga, 26. Bakar, the chief City called Bikaneer^ it lyeth on the Weft fide of the River Ganges, 27. Nagracot, the chief City fo called, in which there is a Chaff el moft richly fet forth, being and paved with Plate of pure ^7z;er,moft curioufly imbofled over head in fevetal figures,- which they keep exceeding bright by often rubbing and burni(h- ing it 5 and all this Coft thofe poor feduced Indians are at, to do honour to an Idol they keep in that Chappel. What charge can* Heathenifti Idolaters be content to bear tor their grofs Idolatry! Nothing is too rich, too pretious, or too dear for it. This Idol thus kept in that fo richly adorned Chappel, they call Matta, and it is continually vifited by thofe poor blinded Infidels, who, out of the officioufnefs of their Devotion, cut off fome part of theirTiwgwex to offer unto it as a Sacrifice 5 which (they fay) grow out again as before: But in this I (hall leave my Reader to a be lief as much fufpenfive as is my own in this particular. In this Province likewife, there is another famous Pilgrimage to a place called Jallamakee ^ where out of cold Springs that iflue out from amongft hard Rocks , are daily to be feen continued Erup tions of Fire, before which the Idolatrous People fall down and worftiip. Both thefe places were feen, and ftridly obferved by Mafter Cory at, 28.

The chief Cities in it are Ragawahatand Dekaka. It hath many Havensmd Torts be longing unto it, which are places of very great trade. Now thefe are the feveral Trevinces belonging to the Great Mogol, and all of them under his fubjedion, which may be be held all together at one view in this moft exad affixed -Map, firft made by the efpecial obfervation and diredhon of that moft able and honourable Gentleman, Sir Thomas Row, here contracted in to a Ids compafs ^ yet large enough to demonftrate, that this great Empire is bounded on the Eaji, with the Kingdom of MaHg \ Weli, with Per fid ^ and with the Main Oceans Southerly j North, with the Mountain Caucafus and Tartaria $ South, with Decan and the Gulph of Bengala.Decan, lying in the fkirts of Ajfa, is divided betwixt three Mahumetan Trinces,&amp;xxd fome other Indian Rhaiaes, which are Princes likewife.A Voyage to EAST-INDIA, The length of thefe Provinces is Northmtt to South-weB mord than two thoufand Englifh miles 5 North and South the ex tent thereof is about fourteen hundred miles 5 the Southennoft part lying in twenty, and the Northermoll: in forty and three de grees ofNorth-Latitude. The breadth of this much enlarged and far extended Empire is North-eaft to Sonth-weft about fifteen hundred of the fame miles. And here a great errour in Geographers muft not efcape my notice, who in their Globes and Maps make Eaii-Indid and Chi na near Neighbours,, when as many large Countries are interpo- fed betwixt them ^ which great diftance may appear by the long travel of the Indian-Merchants, who are ufually (they goingand returning all the way by Land) in their journey, and return,and fome ftay there, two full years from Agra to China. NoWjto give an exaft account of all thofe fore-named Provin- rex, were more than I am able to undertake , yet out of that which I have obferved in fome of them (by travelling many miles up inro that Countrey, and then up and down with my Lord- EmbafTador unto many places there in progrefs with that King) I (hall adventure to ghefs at all, and I think for my parti cular, that the Great Mogol, confidering his moft large Territo* #•/&gt;/, his full and great Treafures, with the many rich Commodi ties his Provinces afford, is the greateft and richeft known King of the Eaft, if irot of the whole World, I (hall now therefore fall upon particulars to make that my obfervation good ; Where SECTION 11. Of the Soy I therey what it and what it produceth^ See. THis moft fpacious and fertile Monarchy (called by the la- habitants Indo&amp;an) fo much abounds in all neceffaries for the ufe and forvice of man, to feed, and cloath, and enrich him, as^that it is able to fubfift and flourifli of it felf, without the leaft help from any Neighbour-Prince or Nation. Here I (hall fpeak firft of that which Nature requires moft. Food, which this Empire brings forth in abundance 5 as, fingu* lar good Wheat, Rice, Barley, with divers more kinds of good Grain to make Bread (the ftaff of lifej and all thefe forts of Corn in their kinds, very good and exceeding cheap. For their Wheat, it is more foil and more white than ours,of which the In habitants make fuch pure, well-relifhed Bread, that I may fay of it, as one fometimes fpakeof the Bread made in the Biftioprick of Liege) it is Tank Panemelior^ Bread better than Bread. The ordinary fort of people eat Bread made ot a coarler Grain, but bothtoothiom, and wholfom, and hearty ^ they make it up 'S ' ■ 'inHorj A Voyage to E A S T-IN DI A, &amp;c. in broad Cakes 5 thick like our Oaten-cakes &gt; and then bake it upon fmall round iron hearths 3 which they carry with them wheii they joUrney from place to place, making ufe of them in their 1 ents.fc (hould feem to be an ancient Cuftom in the £aft 9 as may appear by that Precedent of when (he entertained theAn-* gels, who found her in her Tenths he took fine nteal^and did hgead it, and made Cakes thereof upon the hearth 0 Gen. 18, 6, To their Bread they have great abundance of all other good Provifion, as of Butter (beating their Cream into a fubftance like unto a thick Oy^for in that hot Climate they can never make it hard J which though foft, yet it is very (wect and good. They have Cheefe likewife in plenty, by reafon of their great number of Kine, and Sheep, and Goats. Befides, they have a Beaft ve ry large, having a fmooth thick skin without hair, called a Buf- felo&gt; which gives good milk 5 the flefti of them is like Beef, but neither lb J toothfom nor wholfom. Thefe Buffeloes are much employed in carrying large skins of water (for they are very ftrong Beafts) which hang on both fides of them, unto Fa milies that want it: their Hides make the moft firm and excel lent Buff. They have no want of Venifon of divers kinds, as Red-Deer, Fallow-Deer, Elks (which are very large, and ftrong,and fierce Creatures) Antilops, Kids, &amp;c. but their Deer are no where imparked3 the whole Empire being fas it were) a Forreft for them 5 for a man can travel no way but he (hall here and there lee of them. But becaufe they are every man's Game that will make them fo, they do not multiply to do them much hurt, ei ther in their Corn, or other places. , To thefe they have great ftore of Hares, and they have plenty of Fowls wild and tame, as abundance of Hens, Geefe, Ducks, Pigeons, Turtle-Doves* Partridges, Peacocks, Quails, arid many other fingular good Fowl. They have variety of Fifti^ all which, by reafon of their Plenty, and becaufe many of the Natives eat no kind of Flefti at all, nor of any thing that hath or may have life 5 and thofe that feed on fuch things, eat not freely of any of thofe living Creatures,they are all bought there at fuch eafie rates^as if they were not worth the valuing. They do not cut their Chickens when they be little to make Capons, and therefore they have no Creatures of that name, but men, their Eunuchs,called there Cogeesor Capons in their Language : fo made, when they be very young, and then deprived of all that might after provoke jealoufie^ und therefore they are put to be attendants on their women, the great men of that Nation keeping many of them, a foft, tender people, tener Spado, as Juvenal cals one of them, that never come to have any Hair on their Faces. But to return again to their Provifions, the Beeves of that Countrey ditter from ours, in that they are none of them very large, and thole they have, have each of them a great bunch ofr * i ill ill A Voyage to E A S T-IN D I A, &amp;c. of gi ifly flefh which grows upon the meeting of their fhoulders. Theflefti of their Beeves is much whiter than the fiefh of ours and Very fweet, tender and good. Their Sheep differ from ours by their great fle(hy Bob-tails, which/evered from their bodies, are very ponderous. Their Wool is generally coarfe,bnt their fledi is not fo. Now tofeafon all their good Provifions, there is great ftore of Sak^ and to fweeten all, abundance of Sugar growing in that Countrey 5 which after it is well refined, may be there had at a very low rate 5 out of which they make very pure white Sugar-Candy, which may be had there at a fmall eafie Price, hkewife. Their Fruits areevery way anfwerabletothe reft, the Coun trey abounding in Musk-Melons (very much better, becaufe they are better digefted there by the heat of the Sun, than' thefe with us.) They have many Water-Melons, a very choice good Fruit, and fome of them as big as our ordinary Pompions, and in (hape like them; the fubftance within this Fruit is fpon- gy, but exceeding tender and well-tafted, of a colour within equally mixed with red and white 5 and within that an excel- lent cooling and pleafing liquor. Here are likewife ftore of Pome-granats, Pdme-citrons§ here are Limons and Oranges, but I never found any there-fo . good as I have feen elfwhere! Here are Dates, Figs, Grapes^ Prunellods, Almonds, Coquer- nuts (of which lobferved (bmething before) and here they have thofe moft excellent Plums called Mirabolans, the ftdne of which h ruit differg very much from others in iti (hape, whereon Nature hath curiouily quartered feveral ftrakes equally divided, veiy pretty to behold 5 many of which choice Plums (^they write), are very cordial, and therefore worth the prizing, are there yvell-preferved, and (ent for England, - They have to thefe another 'Fruit we Englifli there call a PI an ten , of which many of them grow in Clufters together j longithey are in (hape, made like unto (lender Cucumbers, and very yellow when they are Ripe, and then tafte like unto a Ator- vPich Pear, but much better. Another moft excellent Fruit they have, called a Manggo, growing upon Trees as big as our Walnut-trees^ and as thefe here, fo thofe Trees there, y^ill be veiy full of that moll; excellent Fruit, in (hape and colour like unto our Apricocks, but much bigger 5 which taken and rol led in a man s hands when they are through ripe, the fubftance within them becomes like the pap ot a roaded Apple, which then fuck d out from about alarge ftone they have within them, is delicately pleafmg unto every Palat thattafts it. And to con clude, with the beft of all other their choice Fruits, the Amana's, like unto our Pine-Apples, which ObnW to the Tafter to be a moft pica ling Compound made of Straw-berries, Claret-wine, Role-water andSugar,well tempered together.Tn the Northermoft parts of this Empire they have variety of Pears and Apples,every •J v . whereA Voyage to EAST-INDIA, &amp;€, where good P^oots, as Garrets, Potatoes^ and others like them. They have Onions and Garlick, and fome Herbs andfmall Roots for Salads^and in the Southernmoft parts 3 Ginger growing almoft in every placerthe large races whereof axe there very excellently well prefervedj as we may know by our tafting them in EngUnd* And all theie things I have laft named may be there likewife bought at very low rates. And laftly 3 fome one kind or other of their very good and choice Fruits may be there had at every time or feafon of the Year. And here I cannot chufe but take notice of a very pleafimt and clear liquor, called Toddie, iflbing from a Spongie Tree, that grows ftrait and tall without Boughs to the Top;, and there Ipreads out in tender branches, very like unto thofe that grow from the Roots of our rank and rich Artichokes, but much bigger and longer. ThisToddie-tree is not fo big, but that it may be very eafily embraced, and the nimble people of that Countrey will climb upasfaft to the top thereof (the ftem of the Tree being-rough and crufty) as if they had the advan tage of Ladders to help them up. In the top-tender branches of thofe Trees they make incifions, which they open and flop again as they pleafe, und6r which they hang Pots made of large and light Gourds, to preferve the influence which illues out of them in a large quantity in the night-feafon, they flop- ping up thofe vents in the heat of the day. That which thus diftils forth in the night, if it be taken vety early in the morning, isaspleafingto the tafte as any new White-wine, and much clearer than it. It is a very piercing, and medicinable, ^nd inoffenfive Drink, if taken betimes in the day, only it is.a little windy : but if it be kept till the heat of the day, the Sun alters it foj as if it made it another kind of liquor, fork becomes then very heady, not fb well relifhed, and un wholibm 5 and when it is fo, not a few ot our drunken Sea-menchule to drink it 5 and I think they fo do, becaufe it will then prefently turn their brains 3 for there are tod too many of the common ibrtof thofe men who ufe the Sea, who lo ve thofe brutiftidi- ftempers too much , which turn a man out of himfelf, and leave a BeafHn the skin of a man. But for that drink, if it be taken in its befb, and moft proper feafon, I conceive it to be of it felf very wholfbm, becaufe it provokes urine exceedingly ^ the further benefit whereof fome there have found by happy expe rience, thereby eafed from their torture infiided by that fhame of Phyficians, and Tyrant of all Maladies, theSt^pne. Andfo cheaptoois this moftpleafing Wine, thatci man may there have more than enough for a very little money. At Snrat 0 and fo to dgra^ and beyond, it feldom or never rains, but one fea(on of the year^ but yet there is a refrefti- ing Dew during all that times the Heavens there are thus fhut up, which every night falls, and cools, and comforts, and refreflieth the face of the earth, fhofe general rains begin near the A a a timeA Voyage to EAST-INDIA, time that the Sun comes to the Northern Tropkk, and fo conti nue till his return back to the Line. Thefe (howers 3 at their be ginning molt extremely violent, areuflier'd in, and ufually take their leave with moft fearful Tempefts of Thunder &amp; Lightning more terrible than I can exprefs, yet feldom do harm; the rea- fon in Nature may be the fubtilty of the Air in thofe parts wherein there are fewer Thunder-ftones made, than in fuch Cli mates where the Air is thick, grofs, and cloudy. During thofe three months it rains ufually every day more or lefs, fometimes one whole quarter of the Moon together, fcarce without any in- termillion ; which abundanc ? of moifture, with the heat of the Sun, doth lo enrich their Land, which they never force Ciflob- ferved right) by Soy ling of it, as that, like by the in- undation ot Ntlns, it makes it fruitful all the year after. When the time of this Ram is pafled over 5 the face of the Sky there is prekntly lo ferene and clear, as that fcarcely one Cloud appears in their Hemifphere the nine months after. f ,. A . n 1 d here a ftrong Argument that may further, and moft in- a 1 1 ) cwthe goddnels of their Soil, (hall not efcape mv Pen, moft apparent in this, That when the Ground there hath been deftitute of Rain nine months together, and looks all of it like the barren Sands m the Defarts of where there it not one fpire of green Graft to be found; within a few days after thofe fat enriching fliowets begin to fall, the face of the Earth there (as it were by a new Reliirreftion) is fo revived, and throughout fo renewed, as that it is prefently covered all over ' ! f UIC f rce ' Mantle. And moreover, to confirm that which before I oblerved concerning the goodnefs of that Soil, amongft many hundred Acres of Corn of divers kinds.

TheyA Voyage to EAST-INDIA, &amp;c. They fow Tobacco in abundance 3 and they take it too 3 very much 5 but after a ftrangc way much different from us: for firft they have little Earthen Pots 5 (haped like our fmall Flower- pots, having a narrow neck 5 and an open round top;, out ofthc belly of which comes a fmall fpout 3 to the lower part of which fpoutthey fill the Pot with water, then putting their Tobacco loo[emthetop 3 and a burning coal upon it 5 they, having firft raltned a very fmall ftrait hollow Cane or Reed (not bigger than a fmall Arrow) within that fpout, a yard or ell long, the Pot ftanding on the ground, draw that fmoak into their mouths tvhich firft falls upon the Superficies of the water, and much dif. colours it. And this way of taking their Tobacco, they believe makes it much more cool and wholfom. The Tobacco^ which growsthere, isdoubtlefs in the Plant as good as in any other place of the world, but they know not how to cure and or der it, likethofe in the tVeJi-Indies, to make it fo rich and icrong. The Countrey is beautified with many Woods and Groves of Trees, in which thofe winged chorijiers make fweet Mufick. In thofe Woods fome excellent Hawks make their neftsi and there are very often to be feen great flocks of Parakeetoes, or little Parrats, who have their breeding and lodging amongft thofe Melancholy Shades. And (in the number of many other Creatures covered with FeathersJ there are fcime very little Birds lefs than our Wrens, who are exceeding pretty, for their neat (hape, and their covering, with moft curious parti-colour'd Feathers, full of variety of little fpots. I have feen there many of thofe rare Creatures kept together in large Cages, who pleafe the Eye with their curious Colours, and the Ear with their va- 8 - riety of pleafant Notes. The Woods and Groves in the Sou- thermoft parts of have great ftore of wild Apes, and Monkeys, and Baboons in them $ feme of which I have feen as high as our talleft Greyhounds, which live among thcTrees,and climb them at pleafure. Thofe Apes, &amp;c, are very terrible to thofe little Birds, which make their Nefts in thofe Woods 5 and therefore Nature hath taught them this fubtilty (to preferve their young ones from thofe Creatures which would otherwife deftroy them) to build their Nefts in the twigs, and the utmoft boughs of thofe Trees, where fome of them hang like little Purfe-nets, to which thofe Apes and Monkeys, be they never fb little and light, cannot oome to hurt them. Befides their Woods, they have great variety of fair goodly Trees that ftand here a nd there fingle, but I never faw any there of thofe kinds of Trees which England affords. They have very many firm and ftrong Timber-trees for building and other ufes 5 but much of their brufti, or fmall wood, I obferved to be very (appy 5 fo that when we brake a twig of it, there would come a fubftance out of feme of it, like unto Milk, and the fappinefs of that underwood may ( as I apprehend it ) A a a 2 benwK.'— im i u wwmmammmmr ' be afcribed in part to the fatnefs of that Soil. Some of their Trees have leavs upon them as broad as BucklerSjOthers are part- - like our Fern or Brakes, as the Tamerine Tree, which .bears Cods foraewhat like our Beans, in which when the Fruit is ripe, there is a very well tafted pulp, though it be fowr, moft wholfom to open the body, and to cool and cleanfe the blood. There is one very great and fair Tree growing in that Soil, of fpecial obfervation, out of whofe Branches or great Arms grow little Sprigs downward till they take Root (as they will cer tainly do if they be let alone) and taking Root, at length prove ftrong fupporters unto thofe large Branches that yield them. Whence it comes to pafi, that thofe Trees in time (their ftrong and far-extended Arms being in many places thus (upport- cd) grow to a very great height, and extend themfelves to (iich an incredible breadth, they growing round every way, as that hundreds of men may lhade themfelves under one of them at any time 5 the rather, becaufe thefe, as all other Trees in thofe Southern parts of Eaji lndia (as particularly lobferved before) ftill keep on their green Coats. for their Flowers, they are for the generality like unto painted Weeds^ which, though their colour be excellent, they rather delight the eye than affeft the fmell^for not many of them, except Rores,and (bme few kinds more, are any whit fragrant: Amongftthemthat arc 3 there' is one white Flower, like to Spa- nifli Jeffamin (if it be not the fame) which is exceedingly well fen ted jof which they make a moft excellent pure fweet Oil, with which they anoint their heads, and other parts of their bodies 5 which makes the company of thofe that do (b very iavoury and fweet. This Empire is watered with many goodly Rivers (as they arc exprefled in the Map J the two principal are Imlusznd Ganges^ where this thing is very obfervable (for they fay there, that it is very truej that one pint of the water of Ganges weigheth left by one ounce than any other water in that whole great Monar chy. And therefore (they fay J that the Mogol^ vvherefoever he is, hath water brought him from that River, that he may drink thereof, by fome appointed for that fervice, who are continual ly cither going to it, or coming from it: The water is brought unto the King in fine Copper Jars, excellently well tin'd on the infide, andfealed up when they are delivered to the Water* bearers for the Ring's ufe 5 two of which Jars every one carries, hanging upon Slings fitted for the Porter's (houlders. Befidcs their Rivers,they have ftore of Wells fed with Springs^ and to thefe, they have many Ponds, which they call Tanques, fome of them exceeding large, fill'd with water when that abun dance of Rain falls (of which more hereafter. J That mort ancient and innocent Drink of the World, Water, is the common drink of Eaji-India , it is far more pleafant and fweet than our water 5 and muft needs be fo, becaufe in all / ■ hot lif'l ■ iil ,1A Voyage to EAST-INDIA, &amp;c, hot Countries it is more rarified, better digefted ^ and freed from its rawnefs by the heat of the Sun, and therefore in thofe parts it is more defired of all that come thither 3 though they ne ver made it their drink before 5 than any other liquor 5 and agreeth better with mens bodies. Sometimes they boy] the water there with fome wholfom Seeds, and after drink it cold 5 and then it is, by much, more cold after an heat. ( Like unto fome men, who have (hewed formerly mnch zeal and heat for 'good, and afterward become more chil and cold than ever they were before.) Sometimes we mingle our water there with the juice of Limonsand Sugar, which makes an exceeding pleafant drink, which we call there sherbet. Some fmall quantity of but not common, is made amongft them 5 they call it Raa^ diftilled from Sugar, and a fpicy rinde of a Tree called jf^gni ^ it is very wholfbm, if taken very moderately. Many of the people there, who are ftrid in their Religion^ drink no Wine at all 5 but they ufe a Liquor more wholfom than pleafant, they call Coffee ^ made by a black Seed boyld in water, which turnes it almoft into the fame colour 5 but doth very little alter the tafte of the water 5 notwithftanding it is very good to help Digeftion, to quicken the Spirits, and tocleanfe the Blood. There is yet another help for thofe that forbear Wine, by an Herb they have, called Beetle, or Paune , in (hape fomewhat like an Ivy-leaf, but more tender 5 they chew it with an hard Nut, fomewhat like a Nutmeg, (but not in tafte like that) and a very little pure white lime amongft the leaves, and when they have fucked down the juice, put forth the reft. It hath ( as they fay, and 1 believe very much of it) many rare qualities 5 for it preferves the Teeth, ftrengthens the Stomack, comforts the Brain, and it cures or prevents a tainted Breath. This I am fore of, that fuch is the pleafing fmell of this Beetle, being chew ing in a clofe room, that the breath of him fo chewing it fills it with a very pleafing favour. This Empire furtheraffords very excellent good Horfe, curi- oufly made, high metl'd, and well managed by the Natives, Befides their own, they have many of the Perfian , Tartarian^ and Arabian breed, which have the name to be the choife ones of the World. But of thefe m6re when I come to fpeak of the Inhabitants. Here are a great number of Camels, Dromedaries, Mules and Afles, imployed for the carriage of burthens, or the carrying of the people, to which ufe alfo they employ many of their Oxen, and their Buffeloes likewKe, ( which before I (pake of.) Camels, as I oftobferved there, have one ftmnge quality, who cry and make a very piteous noyfe at night, when they take on their burthens i but in the morning when they are laid on, the poor Creatures are very ftill and quiet, making no noyfe^66 A Voyage to IL AS T-I N D I A, &amp;&gt;€. The Dromedary is called by the Prophet Jeremy, Jer.2 ,i %.the fmft Dromedary ^ the reafon may be 5 becaufe thefe j like the Camels, have very long legS3 and confequently make long fteps, and fo travelling rid ground apace 5 or becaufe at a pinch, or time of need, they will carry a man exceeding far without reft, and but with a very little food. They have fome Rhinocerots , but they are not common^ which are very large fquare Beafts, bigger than the largeft Oxen England affords ^ their (kins without hair, lye in great wrinkles upon their necks, breafts and backs, which doth not make them fcem lovely unto the beholder?. They have very ftrong, but fhort Horns, growing upon very firm bones, that lye over thei|: Noftrils, they grow upwards, towards rhetopof their head, every one of thefe Creatures being fortified with one of them 5 and that enough to make them fo terrible, that they are (hunn'd by other , though very large Creatures. With thefe Horns ( from which thofe Creatures have their Names) are made very excellent Cups, which (as is conceived) give fome virtue un to the liquor put into them, if itftand any whit long in thofe Cups. And now to conclude with the largeft and the moft intelli gent ( as we (hall hereafter (hew) of all the fenfible Creatures the Earth produceth, the Elephant, of which this vaft Monar chy hath abundance 5 and of them, the Mogol is Mafter of many thoufands&gt; and his Nobles, and all men of quality befides, in thofe large Territories, have more or lefs of them. But of thefe much fhall be fpoken in my fixt Seftion. I obferved before, that the Inhabitants of this Empire did carry moft of their burthens upon the backs of their Beafts 5 and in a fpecial manner this people employ their Camels and Dro medaries for this ufe, to carry their Merchandizes from place to place : and therefore I (hall let my Reader fee SECTION nr. What the chief Merchandiseand moft Staple, and other Commodities are, which are brought into this Empire. THe moft Staple Commodities of this Empire are Indico and Cotton Wool 5 of that Wool they make divers forts of Callico , which had that name ( as I fuppofe ) from Callicnt^ not far from Goa 0 where that kind of Cloth was firft bought by the Portugals. For the Spices brought hither by the Eaft-India Fleet, they are had more Southerly, from the Jflands of Sumatra^ from Ja- 4. ■ I' * vaJ Voyage to E AS T-INDI A, &amp;c. va *ajcrand minor y from the Moluccoes, and from other places thereabouts : In which, as in the Molucco Iflands 3 and thofe other parts too from whence the richeft Spices come, the Low- CountTy Merchants have got fuch footing, and fuch 1 particular intere r, that our Englifh factors there (^for theprefent^ buy thofe Commodities 5 as we fometimes do buy Provifions and Commodities here at rhome, out of the engroffing Huckfters hands : So that our Engliih in thofe parts have a free Trade for no kind of Spice, but for that, which is one of the loweft prized, namely. Pepper, which they fetch from Bantam, Which more general T rade of the Dutch, they have formerly gained at a very vaft expence, by fortifying themfelves there, in the places where-ever they fettle 5 and then ftanding, upon their Guard, put a kind of force upon the to fell them their Commodities. What the carriage of that people hath formerly been in thofe pans towards our Englifh, (where their Swords hath been longefi) isfufficiently made known by other Pens: This I may conclude from their example ( and I would they were fingularand alone in it) that when a people will not be ordered by that Royal Law , which commands us. Matth. 7. 12. To do nothings hut what we would be content to fuffer -^as to do nothing unto others 3 but what we would be well content to fuffer from others : But on the contrary, when they meafure things, not by theftrait and even Rule of Equity, but by the crooked and oblique Line ofPower^ arming their Tnjuftice to do what they pleafe, becaufe they can do what they will; This caufeth many to make very bold with God in cafes that feem to give advantage unto their high thoughts and Commodities: For what evil cannot Ambition and Covetoufnefs do, when they are backt with an Arbitrary and unlimitted Power here beloWjifthey be not checkt by a ftronger Arm from above? Whence we fee it often cometopafs, that when the Laws of Nature and Nations, yea of God himfelf, lye in the way of their profit, or earthly advantages ( what-ever their (ufferings or lofs be afterward ) they either (purn them thence, or elfe tread aiid trample upon them at pleafure, to com- pafs their ends for the prefent. This I can fay of the Dutch (fomething from my own knowledge , but more from there- port of others) that when I lived in thofe parts, and we Englifli there were more for number than they, and confequently could receive no hurt from them, we there ufed them as Neighbours andBiethren, but in other places, where they had the like ad vantage of us, they dealt with us neither like Chriftiansnor Men. But I will not here any longer digrefs, but return * to fpeak further of the Commodities to be had in Eafi~ India, The Indico we bring thence, is a good, and a rich Commo dity.

The leaves thusftripp'd off, are laid in great heaps together certain dayes 5 till they have been in a hot fweat 5 then are they removed, and put into very great and deep Veflels filt'd with afuflicientquantity of water to fteep them in 5 where .they leave their blew tincture with their fubftance^ thisdone, the water is drain'd out into other exceeding broad^ but very (hallow Veflels, orVats 3 made of Plaifter (like to that we call Plaifter of Paris) which will keep in all the Liquor till the hot Sun in (hort time extrads themoifturefromit^ and then what -mains in thebottomej is a Cream about one quarter of an inch thick, which fuddenly becomes hard and dry, and that is our 'Jndico^ thdbeft fort whereof comes from Biana^ near unto dgrd^ and a coarfer fort is made at Cirfaeje^ not far from Amadamaz, 5 'itbduc which two places, are a very great number ofthofe fhrubs planted, which bear thofe leaves. For their Cotton-woolly they fow feed, and very large quanti ties of Ground in Eaji-India arc thus feeded. It grows up like fmall Rofe-bufhes, and then puts forth many yellow blofloms^ thofe afterward falling off, there remain little Cods, about the bignefs ofa Man's Thumb, in which the fubftance at firft is moid and yellow 'y but as they ripen, they fwell bigger, till they break their Covering, and after, in fhort time, that within them be comes Wool, as white as Snow^ and then they gather it. Amongfl: that Wool they find feeds to fow again as they have occafion &gt; but thofe fhrubs bear that Wool three or four years eie they fupplant them. Of this Cotton-wool they make divers forts of white Cloth (as before lobferved) fome broad, fomenarrow, fomecoarfe, fome fine 5 and very fine indeed 5 for fome that I have feen there I believe was as fine as our pureft Lawn. Much of the coarfer fort of that Cloth they dye into Colours, or elfe ftain ink variety of well-fhaped and well-coloured Flowers or Fi gures , which are fo fixed in the Cloth, that no water can wafh them out. That pretty Art of ftaining, or printing fixing thofc variety of Colours in that white Cloth, the People ofhave engroiled to themfelves, where the moft curious are made 5 whither neighbouring, as well as more remote Nations^ bring their Monies to fetch them thence. In Dec an &gt; which bounds upon the il/^/'s Territories South^ ( the Princes whereofare Tributaries unto him ) there are many Diamond-Rocks, in which are found thofe rnoft pretious of all other Stones j and they are to be fold in this Empire , and con- foquently to be had by thofe who have fkill to buy them, and Money to pay for them. But as ail the Stones in Eaji-Jndiaaxe not pretious, fo thofe that are, the Natives know very well how to value. i 1 i But further, for the Merchandizing Commodities the Mogols Provinces aficrd, there is Mufk (by reafon of their abundance of 'an m fco ^IttA Voyage to EAST-IN DIA, gfr-c. ^ of Mufk-Cats) to behad in good quantity; and there are Be- zar (tones: which are not fo called from any Beaft of that name but they grow in the maws of Goats, which when they obferve' to grow exceeding lean , they kilj them, and find thofe ftones m them 3 and u tixey did not lb 3 that ftone in them would make an end-of them. By-wMch we may obferve, how that pre- tious Bezar ftone that proves many times fuch a Cordial, and Prcfcrvgtu^ to the Life of Man, isdeftruftive and mortal un to the poor Creature from wMce it is taken ; Like that pre- tious^Wor -d of God, that may proceed from the Lips of him tnat hath a, lean Soul, r and may doothers good;, but himfejf no thing but mifchief. TJie greateft number of thofe Goats from whence thoTe Bezar$ are taken, feed on the Mountains of Lar in the Perftavs Temfaxm, the Weftern-Bound before V of the Mogol'sgre&amp;t Empire^ They have fomeftore of Silk here 3 but the greateft quantity ot that rich Commodity, that any place in the whole World anords, comes out of a Province belonging unto the lung of Ptrju. 'ThvfeOeorgians and Armenians^ (both under the Command of the Perfian King) are by profefiion Chriftians, iike thole of the Greek Church. And xheAbiffins, under the Comm.md of Prejier John, are in profeffion Chriftians like- wile, but thefe clrcamciie their Males before they bap tize them. Alals pqpirPfiople I whoi for want of better in(bui- l 0n c ; anrit)t ' know what\they Chould, and therefore know not what they do. All thofe Armenians, Georgians, and Abijfins, (as I have it from others^, but can relate fomething of it out of my own knowledge J even all of them fee Chrift but in the dark, and by reafon of the general ignorance that is in them , cannot know God as they ought in Jefus Chrift. Thefe are the differ ent cafes of many which profefe Chrift in the World 5 fome cannot know him, fome care not to know hu% and fome will not know him, Amongft the firft of thefe, they all may be ranked whom I but now named, as many others of the Greek, and thofe that profefs Chriftianity in Ruffian Churches, with many-many others of the Romifh , who have the Truths of God fealed up in an unknown Tongue, to keep, and to conti^- nue them in ignorance 3 who inftead of the two Breafts of the Church, the Law and the Gofpel, are fed with mouldy and finnowed Traditions &gt; and their cafe being fbi, our Chari ty towards them may lead us thus far, to believe that they would do better, if they knew better 3 and this may (peak much in their excufe. But what Plea can be made for us of this Nation, that Do not what we Know 5 or if we be ignorant, it is be- caufe we will be fb ^ not becaufe we cannot know, but becaufe we care not for knowledge^ and will not kpow ? But to return to the place where I began my laft digreffion 5 I told you that the People here have fbme ftore of Silk, of which they make Velvets, Sattins, Taffataes, either plain, or mingled, Bbb orA Voyage to EAST-INDIA, &amp;£• or ftrip d in party-colours 5 but the beft of them for richnefs and goodnefs come not near thofe which are made in the parts of Italy. Many curious Boxes 3 Trunks, Standi(hcs 5 Carpets, with other excellent Manufactures^ maybe there had. They have medicinal Drugs 5 and amongft them very much Cajpa grow ing there in Canes. They have Gums well fented, and much Lignum Aloes&gt; which burnt, yields a perfume better than any one thing in the world that leverfmelled. They have great ftore of Gum-lac 5 of which they make their hard Wax 5 and that Gum likewife they there imployfor many other neat ufes. The Earth there yields good Minerals of Lead, Iron, Copper, Brafs, and (they fay) they have Silver-Mines too, which (if true ) they need not open, being fo enriched from other Na tions of Europe, and other parts, who yearly bring thither great quantities of Silver to purchafe their Commodities. Which I colled from our Englifti Trade there 5 for, though we vent fome quantity of our Wollen Cloth, withfome other things we carry thither, yet the greateft part by far of Commodities brought thence, are caught by the Silver hook. And this is the way to make any Nation of the world rich, to bring, and leave Silver in it, and to take away Commodities* And, as all Ri vers run into the Sea, fo many Silver Streams run into this Mo narchy, and there ftayi the People of any Nation being there very welcome that bring in their Bullion^ and carry away the others Merchandizes 5 but it is look'd on as a Crime that is not eafily anfwered , to tranfport any quantity of Silver thence. ^ The Coyn, or Bullion, brought thither from any place, is ^relently melted and refined, and the MogoV% Stamp (which is his Name, and Titles, in Perlian Characters) put upon it. The Coyn there is more pure than in any other part of the world, being ( as they report) made of pure Silver, without any Allay s fo that in the Spani(h Money, the pureft of all Europe, there is (bme drofs. They call their pieces of Money, Roopees 5 of which there arc . fome of divers values, the meaneft worth two (hillings and three pence, and the beft two (hillings and nine pence fterling. By thefe they count their Eftates and Payments. They have another Coyn of inferiour value in Guzarat, called Mamoodies, about twelve pence fterling; both the former, and thefe, are madeinhalfs, and Tome few in quarters ^ fo that three pence is the leaft piece of (ilver current in thofe Countries^nd very few of them to be feen. That which paffeth up and down for ex change under this rate, is Brafs or Copper Money, which they call Pices, whereof three, or thereabouts, countervail a Penny, Thofe Pjffej-are made fo maffie and thick, as that the bafer me tal of which they are made, put to other ufes, is well-nigh worth the Silver they are rated at. Their Silver Coyn isA Voyage ^EAST-INDIA, &amp;c. is made either round or fquare, but fo thick 5 as that it never breaks nor wears out. They have pure Goid-Coyn likewi(e 3 fome pieces of great value, but theleare not very ordinarily feen amongd them. I have now done with this Sedion, 'wherein I have related much of the Commodities^and Riches^s before of the Provifions and Pleafures which are to be found in that vaft Monarchy,, and 5 I conceive, nothing but what Truth will juftifie. And now, left that place I have defcrib'd, (hould (eem to be an earthly Para- dife, I muft acquaint my Reader, that the Contents there found by fuch as have lived in thofe parts, are four'd and fauc'd with many unpleafing things 5 which he muft needs know, when he takes notice SECTION IV.

Thofe moft- ravenous Creatures will not fuffer a Man to reft quietly in his Grave, for if his Body be not buryed very deep, they will dig him thence, and bury as much of him again as they can confume in their hungry bellies. In their Rivers are many Crocodiles, and Latet anguis inherbapn the Land 3 not a few over-grown Snakes, with other venemous and pernicious Creatures. In our Houfes there we often fee fhaped like unto Crocodiles, of a fad green colour, and but little Creatures, the fear of whom prefents its felf moft to the Eye, for I do not know that they ate hurtful. There are many Scorpions to be feen, which are B b b 2 often-A Voyage E A S T -l N DI A, i&amp;c* oftertimes felt, which creep into their houfes efpecially in that time of the Rains ^ whofe ftinging is moftfenfible;, and deadly, if the Patient have not prefently (bme oyl that is made of Scor- pionsj to annoint the part afFeftedj which is a fudden and a cer tain cure.

The Scorpions are in (hape like unto our Cra-fi(hes, and not bigger, and look black like them, before they are boy led. They have a little round tayl which turns upland lyes ufuallyupon their backs,* at the end whereof is their fting, which they do not put in,and let out oftheir bodies3as other venemous creatures do,but it alwayes appears in their tayls ready to ftrike 5 it is very fharp and hard, and not long, but crooked like the talon of an Hawk. The abundance of Flyes (/*fe thofe foarms in Egypt^ Exod. 8. 21J in thofe parts did likewife very much annoy us: for in the heat of the day their numberlefs number was fuch, as that \ve could not be quiet in any place for them, they being ready to By into our Cupps, and to cover our Meat as foon as it was placed on the T able 5 and therefore we had alwayes fome of the Natives we kept there, who were our Servants^ to ftand round about us onpupofe while we were eating, with Napkins^o fright them away. And as in the day one kind of ordinary Flyes troubled us 5 fo in the night we were likewife very much dif- quieted with another fort called Mufqueetoes^ like our Gnats, but fome-what lefs, and in that feafon we were very much troubled wuh Chinches, another fort of little troublefome and ofFenfive creatures, like little and thefe annoyed us two wayes^ as firft by their biting and ftinging, and then by their ftink. From all which we were by far more free when we lodged in •Tents ( as there we did much) than when we abode in Houfes, wherein great Cities and Towns, (to add unto the difquiets i before named ) there were fuch an abundance of large hungry Ratts, that fome of us were bitten in the night as we lay in our beds, either on our Toes or Fingers, or on the tips of our Ears, or on the tops of our Nofes, or in any part of our Bodies belides which they could get into their Mouths, The winds in thofe parts ( as I obferved before ) which they call the Mont foone , blow conftantly one way, altering but few points, fix months Southerly, and fix months Northerly. The months of April, May, and the beginning of jf#/*?, till the Rain . falls ?. falls 3 are fo extremly hotjas that the wind when it blows but gent ly^ receives fuch heat from the parched'ground, that the refledi- on thereof is ready to blifter a Man's Face that receives the breath of ir. And if God did not provide for thofe parts 3 by fending a breezej or breath, or fmall gale of wind daily 3 which lome-what tempers that hot fulphureous Air, there were no living in that Torrid Zone for us Englifli^ who have been ufed to breathe in a temperate Climate 5 and, notwithftanding that benefit, the Air in that plate is fo hot to us EngHdi, that we fhould be every.day ftewed in our own moifture, but that we ftir very little in the heat of the day, and have cloathing about us as thin as we can make it. And no marvel, for the coldeft day in the whole year at noon (unlefsitbe in the time when thofe Rains fall) is hotter there then the hotteft day in England. Yet I have there obfervcd moll: ftrange and (udden changes of heat and cold within few hours, as in November znA December the moft temperate months of their year (as before) and then at mid-night the Air was fo exceeding frefh and cold, that it would produce a thin Ice on the water,and then as we lay in our Tents, we would have been very glad ofthe warmth of a Rugg upon us, and the noon of that following day would be fo extream hot, as that it was troublefom then to keep on the thinneft cloathing. Sometimes there, the wind blows very high in thofe hot and dry feafons, not long before the Rain begins to fall, raifing up into the Air a very great height, thick Clouds of Duft and Sand, which appear like dark Clouds full o^moifl:ure,but they deceive like the brook in Job, Job 6.15. that hath no water in it, Thefe dry (bowers Cwhich Almighty God threatens to fend among a people as an heavy judgement.

And ib having obferved what is Truth, and what is enough to be faid of the Inconveniences and Annoyance?;, as well as of the Commodities and Contentments which are to be found in thofe parts, I come now to fpeak of the People that inhabit there. And becaufe many particulars will neceflarily fall with in tl\ejcompafs of this part of my Obfervatious, which would more weary my Reader if they Chould be prefented unto him in one continued Difcourfe, I (hall therefore ( as I have begun) break this into Sections, and proceed to (peak SECTION V, • . Of the Inhahitants of Eaft-India, who they are \ Of their viofl ' excellent Ingenuity exprejfed by their cur ions' nujaciures, their Markets at Home to buy and fell in, and their 1 rade abroad THe Inhabitants in general of Indoftan were all anciently Gentiles^ called in general Hittdoes ^ belonging to that very great number of thole which are called Heathens, which take up almoft two thirds of the number of the People who in habit the face of the whole Earth. But of this more hereafter. There are fome Jews ( but they are not manyj here and there fcattered and loft as it were, in thofe other great numbers of People5 thegreateft company of Jews now to be found together in any one place of the world (as I have been made to believe from the obfervation of others) are to be feen at Grand Cairo in Egypt, whither they are returned, and where fetled, to take their fill of their fore-Fathers Fletti-pots. For the Inhabitants of £^- India eVer 4!nce they were fubdued by they have been mixed with Mahnmetans 3 which though they be by farr in refpeft of their number lefs than thofe Pagans^ yet they bear all the fvvay, and command all in thofe Countries. ' 1 here are befides thefe, now become ■ as it were Natives there ) a great number of Perftans and Tartars ( who are Ma~ humetans byReligionJ that there inhabit, very many of which the# keeps tor Souldiers to ferveon Horfe-back, called there Haddees ; There are of both thefe many dating, ftout, hardy and valiant Men. For-the Perjians, there are many of them 'comely Ferfons, not fo fwart as thofe ot Eaji-Jndia, But for the 7artars I have there feen , ( and Iliavefeen many of them) they are more to be commended for their Valour than Beauty, a fquare, ftout, ftrong People, having platter Faces 5 and flat Nofes. There are many Armenians, and fome Abijfins amongft them, vti q whoA Voyage /^EAST-INDIA, &amp;€• whb wear the Livery of Chrift, in being called Chriftians, the greateft part of whofe Chriftianity lies in their Name. Thole Armenians there make fome wine to fell 3 of Raifons;, Sugar^atid other ingredients, that is ftrong and heady, and lufcious, tafted too much by many Chriftians that come thitherj as by thofe too that make it. Of the green Grapes there^ though they have abundance and they great, and (weet, and good, yet they make no Wine at all: The Mahumetans (in obedience to a Precept of Mahnmets which forbids Wine) neither make, nor drink it 5 and others are not ftiffered there to make it of thofe green Grapes, for fear (as I (uppofe) they (hould make, and drink too much of it. To thofel have named of other Nations, (that are to be feen in Eaji-India) there are befides fome few almoft of every people in Afta, and many Europeans of divers parts (that ufe to ftir from their own fires) to be found amongft them, and among that great variety of People and Nations there to be obferved, I have taken fpecial notice of divers Chinefaas, and Japanefaas there, and thofe I have feen of them, for the generality, are a people of no large ftature, with little eyes, and nofes fomthing flatted 5 de tribus CapUis^ with a few black hairs that ftandfcat^ tered on their upper lips which make them as handfome beards as are to be feen on our Hares, or Cats. There are fome Jews here (as before I oblerved) whofe ftub- bornnefs and Rebellion, long ago, caufed Almighty God to threaten them, that they ftjould be after fifted, and fcattered among all the Nations of the World* Thofe ancient Satyrifts, Terfim, and Juvenal, after that moil: horrid ad committed by them in Crucifying our Blefled Saviour (though not in refped unto that moft cruel action, for they were Heathens) yet they call them Verpor^ that is^circumcifed, Worms, vermin. Tacitus after gives them a moft unfavory Epithete, cal ling themfatentes Judteos^ ftinking Jews. Marcus the Emperour obferving them well, concluded that they were a generation of men worfe than favages or Canibals,to be even the worft of men, as if they were the very reffufe and dregs of mankind* How ufoal is that Proverb, that when men are fufpeded to do otherwife than they ftiould, toanfwer, what, am I Jew, that I (heuld do fo, and fo? I have obferved fomthing to this purpole, from the people of Eaji-India, who are very valiant at tongue fights, though not fo with their weapons (as you will hear after- ward), that people,! fay, who have a very nimble but a bale qua lity in railing at, and mifcalling one another 5 and their language is fo full, and fignificant, that they can call a man in it, two or three bale things in one word 5 but when they come to call mm, whom they mUcall, Judeo Jew, they belieye (as I have been ot- ten told) that they can go no higher , efteeming that, above aii other terms, the higheft name of obloquy. \ Yet we do believe, (becaufe the Lord hath promifed it) that 375976 A Voyage to E AS T-I N DI A, &amp;€. he will find a time to call home this people again to himfelfj when they lhall receive honour above all the contempt they have been long under j after they fhall fee with forrow, and with the eye of faith. Him;, whom their Fore-fathers, outofigno- rance, and dcfpite 3 and unbelief pierced. For the Stature of the Natives of Eafi-India^ they are like us but generally very freight &gt; for I never obfcrved nor .heard of any crooked perfon amongft them ; And one reafon may be, be- caufe they never lace nor girt in their Bodies 3 and when they fleep, they accuftom themfelves to ftretch out their Bodies at their full length 3 without any thing to raife up theii 4 heads. And further, among many other things I took fpecial notice of there, I never oblerved any deformed Perfon , nor Ideot or natural Fool, in thofe Parts. Now for the Complexion of this People, they are all of them of a fad tawney or Olive-colour, their hair black as a Raven, very harfh, but not curl'd. They like not a man or woman that is very white or fair,becaufe that (as they lay) is.the colour of Lepers, common amongft them. Moft of the Aiahumtans, except the Moolaes (which are their Priefts) or thofe which are very old and retired, and have (as it were) given the World quite overj keep their chins continually bare, but fuffer the hair: on their upper lipps to grow very long; 5 and they keep it in its natural colour , by combing it continually with black -lead Combs, till they ^e of t g99d years v b^t afterward, when Time hath fo fhowed upon them, that thej can no longer keep in nor conceal their gray hairs, they ufe the Rafor (as they did) no more, but let the^air of their chins grow long and large, which makes many gray-beards amongft thenij and I conceive that there are of thofe many Old men. And further, it is the manner of the M^humetans to (have all the hair from of! their Heads, referving only one lock on the Crown of them, for Mahomet to pull them up to Heaven with (as they fondly conceit). Tl]e Hi#does ftjave their Heads likewife, but cut all off3 and both of them fhave thus, and that very often; but however their baldnefs appears not at all,becaufe their Heads are continually covered with a Shafh, or a wreath of narrow Cal- o-Cloth, many times wrap'd about them 5 (ufually for their colour white or red) which they never pull off, as we do our Hats m Complements. Their much and often fhaving makes many excellent Barbers amongft them, who belides their Sciflers p ■ ^ a ^&gt; rs 3 u ^ e a little Inftrument about the length of a fhort Bodkin, very Iharp, made like a Chizel, but not broader at the cutting end than the fhankofa fix-penny nail, with which they pare and clenfe the nails on their fingers and toes. Every Barber carries always about him a round Looking-glafs made of fteel, about the compafs of a large trencher-plate, made fbmwhat hol- ow, and kept by them exceeding clean and fleek, fo that it will repiefent the Face of him that beholds it on the convex fide very well.i A Voyage to E A S T-1 N 13.1 A, 377 well. Thcfe BarbcrS;,. as they walk up and down, often prcfent thefe Glaflcs unto men whom they find fitting ftill, which is a tender of their Service if they fliail pleafe to make ufe of them. The people there often wafh their Bodies, and keep their Feet as clean and as fweet as their Hands. The better fortannoint themfelves very much with fweet oyls 3 which makes their com pany (as before I obferved) very favory. The Natives there (of which there is fomthing before in my third Settion) (hew very much ingenuity in their curious Manu- failures 5 as in their Silk-fluffs which they moft artificially weave, fome of them very neatly mingled either with Silver or Gold, or both. As alfo in making excellent Quilts of their ftained cloth, or of frefh coloured Taffeta lined with their Pintadoet, or of their Sattin lined with Taffata, betwixt which they put Gotten- wooll, and work them together with Silk. Thofe Taffata,-or Sattin-quilts, are excellently ftitched by them, being done as evenly, and in as good order, as if they had been drawn out to them, for their diredion , the better to work them. They make likewife excellent Carpetts of their Cotton-wooll, in fine mingled colours, fome of them more than three yards broad, and of a great length. Some other richer Carpets they make all of Silk, fo artificially mixed, as that they liyelily reprefent thofe flowers, and figures made in them. The ground of fome other of theirMich Carpets is Silver or Gold, about which are fuch filken flowers, and figures (as before T named) moft excellently and orderly difpofed throughout the whole work. Their skill is likewife exquifite in making of Cabinets, or Boxes, or Trunks, or Standifhes, curioudy wrought, within, and without 3 inlaid with Elephants tooth, or Mother of Pearl, or Ebony, or Tortoyfe-fhell, or Wyre 5 they make excellent Cups, and other things of Agate, and Cornelian 5 and curious they are in cutting all manner of ftones. Diamonds as well as others. ^ They paint Staves, or Bed-fteads, or Chefts of Boxes, or Fruit-difhes, or large Chargers ,extream neatly^which^when they be not inlaid (as before) they cover the wood (firft being hand- lomly turn'd) with a thick Gum, then put their Paint on, moft artificially made of liquid (ilver, or gold,or other lively colours, which they ufe 3 and after make it much more beautiful with a very clear varnifh put upon it. They are excellent at Limning, and will coppy out any Pi- dure they fee to the life.* for confirmation of which take this inftance 5 It happened that my Lord Embafladour vifiting the Mogol on a time, as he 'did often, prefented him with a curi ous neat fmall oval Pidure dope to the life in England, The Mogol was much pleafed with it, but told the Embafladour with- all, that haply he fuppofed that there- was never a one in his Country that could do fo well in that curious Art 3 and then of fered to^wager with him a Leek of Roopees ( a furn which C c c amounted37 § AVoya^eto E A S T-IN D ! A, amounted to no lei's then 10000 1. fieri.) that in a few days he would have two Copies made by that prelented to him fo like, that the Embafladour (hould no|: know his own. He're- fufed the great wager, but told the King he would adventure his judgment on it : Two Copies taken from that Original were within few days after made, and brought and laid before the Embafladour , in the prefence of the Ring 5 the Embafladour viewing them long, either out of Courtlhip to pleafethe Kine or elfe unable to make a difference 5 twixt the Pidures being all exquiiitly done, took one of them which was new made ^ for that which he had formerly prefented, and did after profefs'that he did not flatter, but miftake in that choice. The truth is that the Natives of that Monarchy are the befi: Apes for imitati on in the world, fo full of ingenuity that they will make any new thing by pattern, how hard foever it feem to be done 5 and therefore it is no marvel, if the Natives there make Shooes and Boots, and Clothes, and Linen, and Bands and Cuffs of our Englifh Faftiion, which are aU of them very much different from their Fafhions and Habits, and yet make them all exceeding neatly. x ® They have Markets, which they call Bazars, to fell and buy their Commodities in all their great Towns twice every day, a little before, and an hour after Sun-rifing in the morning, andVo a lutle before and a little after Sun-fet at night.

Thofe Mahumetans that have vifited Maho met s Sepulchre, are ever after called Hoggees, or holy men. This bound from Snrat to the Red-Seaj as fhe hath many people in her, fo hath fhe good Ordnance, but thofe Navigators know not well how to ufe them for their defence. She begins her Voyage about the twentieth of March 5 and finifheth it, about the end of September following. The Voyage is but fhort and might eafily be made in lefs than three moneths, but the Ship is very (low, and ill-built to abide foul weather 5 and in the long feafon of the rain, and a little before and after it, the winds upon thofe Coafts are commonly fo violent, that there is no coming but with much hazard into the Indian Sea. This Ship re turning is ufually worth (as I have heard it faithfully reported, and if my credit given to that report make me nottoabufemy Readers) two hundred thoufand pounds Sterling, and moft of it brought back in good Gold and Silver 5 fome fine ChawletsthQj bring with them home likewife. But that huge mafs of wealth thus brought home into IndU 0 is another efpecial thing, and might have been added to that 1 fpake of before towards the continual enriching of this great Monarchy: where, in the next place I fliall fpeak i W0 m ■ SECTION V I. Of th c care and shjU of this people in keeping and niana* qino^ their excellent good Horfes j Of their Elephants and their ordering and managing them, And how the people ride and are carried up and down from place to place. y | a He Souldiery here, and fo many of the Gentry, and better i fort of the people, who live at Court, (hew excellent good skill in riding and managing of their well turn d, high me- tal'd, choice Horfes •, which are excellent good at mounting up, bounding and curvetting, and when they run them at their full fwifteft fpeed will ftop them at a foots breadth 5 for the fcantling of thofe creatures, they are in proportion like ours, but excel lently well eyed, headed, limn d 5 for their colours, there are fome of them Raven-black, but many more of them white, cu- rioufly Dapled 5 and a very great number Pied and fpotted all over, and there are fbme of other bright colours. But it is a ufual cuftom there amongft Gallants who ride upon the brig t- coloured horfes, to have their legs and lower parts of their bel lies and breafts died into a Saffron colour (of which they have much there) which makes them look as if they had ftood in lome Ccc 2 Dyers :Dyars Vatt, juft to fuch an height of their bodies. The hair upon their Horres(whom they keep plump and fat} is very fhort, foft;, and lyes fleek upon them .* and I wonder not at it, they are kept fo daintily 5 every Horfe being allowed a man to drefs and feed him, and to run by him when he is rode forth and this is ail his work. They tye not down their horfe-heads when they ftand ftill (as we do) with halters, but fecure each horfe by two ropes, faft- ned to their hind-feet, which ropes are fomwhat long^to be flak ed down behind them in Tents, or other places wherein they are kept. . 4 They cut grafs for them green or withered on the earth as they have occafionto ufe it, never mowing their ground and ma king Hay as we do. But that which keeps their horfes in heart, and inflefh, is the Provender they eat, which is a kind of round grain they call Donna^ fomwhat bigger than our Tares 3 which they give not unto them dry, but boil'd, and mingled with fome coarfe Sugar amongft it 5 and when it is cold give it them, nlade up in round balls, which they put into their mouths, as if they cramb'd them 3 and fometimes they put a little Butter into thefe balls to fcour their bodies. I heir choice good horfes are valued there at as dear if not an higher rate, than thofe we efteem moft of in England are prized with us; They make exceflent Saddles, and fome of them of great value, adorned witlrhandfom and rich trapings, all of them very eafie both for the horfc, and his rider. They manage their horfes with ftrong fhaffles, whofe reins and head-fialls are made fuitable to their Saddles and Trappings, The Elephants in this vafi: Monarchy are very numerous, and though they be the largefl, and that by far, of all the Creatures the earth brings forth 5 yet are they fo tradable, unlefs at fome times when the Males are mad (of which more afterward) as that a boy of twelve years old is able to rule the biggefi: of them, in which we may in a fpecial manner read a Comment on that truth which tells us how that the Lord hath put the fear of man upon all the creatures here below. But for the Elephants (I have begun to fpeak of) they are very huge vaft over-grown Creatures, lome of whom, which I have feen, I conceive at the leaft twelve foot high 3 but there are amongft them (as they fay) fourteen or fifteen foot in height. The colour of them all is blacky their skins thick, and fmooth without hair 3 they have full eyes, but not proportionable to their great bodies 3 they have ears like our Oxen, but not ex ceeding large, and thofe ears edged (as it were) about with a fhort hair-fringe 3 and at the end of their tails (which are flender and not very long) there grows fome hair like wife and a little ce their eye-lids 3 but no where elfe about their-bodies. fhe feet of the Elephants look like the trunks of fmall trees cut fquare off from their roots 3 round about which there are thick, and fhort 3 and broad claws growing. Some on 1 %A V. oyage to E AST-INDI A, Some that write of them have abufed the world with this tra dition that they have no joynts in their legs, and therefore ftand when they fleepagainft trees to hold them up : which is all very falfe, for they lye down arid arife again at their pleafure as other beafts do. Their motion is not fwift, a walking rather than a pace about three miles at the moft an hour 5 but of all beafts that ear! ry burdens they are moft fure' of foot 3 for they never fall^ nor yet jfhimble to endanger their Rider. They are moft docile creatures, and of all thbfe we account meerly fenfible come neereftuntoreafon. ,. r; &gt; ... r . Lipjius in his Epiftles 5°* out of his obfervation from others, writes more of them than I can confirm, or an#, I perfwade my felf, believe 5 yet many things moft re markable, which feem indeed to be ads of reafon rather than fenfe, I have obferved in them: for inftance, an Elephant will do anything his Keeper commands him, as if he bid him to af fright a man, he will make towards him as if he meant to tread him into pieces 5 but when he is come at him do him no hurt at ail$ fo if he would have him, to abufe or to difgrace a man, he will take dirt, or dufl:, or _kenriel-wafer into his Trunk, and dafh it on his face. Their Trunks are grifly Snouts of a great length, hanging down betwixt their long teeth, which teeth nature hath given them for their defence, otherwife they are of little ufe to them. In their Trunks they have foch marvellous ftrength, that by them they can do very much mifchief: for if they ftrike an Horfe, or Camel, or any other the like beaft with them (asfometimes they do when as they are mad) they will fo break their bones, as that they will fpoii, nay kill them at one blow 5 and much more a man, if he chance to come in their way. Thofe Trunks of the Elephants are to them as an hand by which they feed themfelves, and make great ufe of them other- wife upon all occafioris: for with thofe Trunks they tear off boughs from trees, by winding them about them, and after, with them, put boughs into their mouths, and eat the tendereft parts of them. With thefe they pull up green corn (if they be foffer- ed) and grafs by the roots, and then againft their legs beat off the earth and dufi: that hangs about them, before they eat there of. Thus they deal with fedgs, or weeds, which they find in the water, firft wafhing off the dirt which hangs on the roots there of, and then down they go into their vafl: bellies. The Elephants delight much to bathe themlelves in water ^iri which, when they find depth enough, they fwim as well as any other Creatures. I obferved before, that the male Elephants when they grow lufly are fometimes mad for their females, but in few days come again in temper 5 before which time they are fb miA chievous, that they will ftrike any thing, but their Keepers, ■ that &gt;r; [i j 3|r s hi: Hi Hi 1 111 j| it Si 11 ■i 1 il J i' t llri that comes in their way , and their ftrength is fuch (as before I obfervM) that there is no blow they give which lights either up on men or beaft, but carries death with it. At thofe times to prevent mifchief they are kept apart from company, fetter'd with ftrong chains unto Trees 5 but if by chance in their phren- fie they get Ioofe(as fometimes they do) they will make after every thing they fee ftitj in which cafe they have no means to ftop them in their violent courfe, but by firing of Crackers made of Gun-powder, whofe fparkling, and noife makes them to ftand ftill and tremble. When thofe creatures are in that mad diftem- per, they fweat much, which makes their favour exceeding rank and filthy like that ill fmell of a Boar when he is fatting in his Stye, but, by much, more ftrong and more offenfive than that. An Englifh Merchant there , of good credit upon his own knowledg, reported this thing which follows, and is very ob- fervable, of an Elephant in Adfmer (the place then of the JMogols refidence) 5 who being brought often through the Bazar or Mar ket place, a woman who ufually fat there to fell herbs, was wont to give this great Elephant an handful, as he many times pafled by 5 this Elephant after, being mad, brake his fetters, and took his way through that Bazar 5 the people being all of them much affrighted, made hafte to fecure themfelves by getting out of his way, amongft whom was this Herb-woman, who, for fear and hafte, forgot her little Child which (he had brought thither 5 the Elephant came to the place where this woman ufually fate, ftopt, and feeing a little Child lying there about her herbs, took it up gently with his Trunk, not doing it the leaft harm, and prefent- ly after laid it down upon the ftall of an houfe that was hard by 5 and then proceeded on in his furious courfe. Acojia^ a Jefiiit, relates the like of an Elephant in Goa from his own experience. The Elephant, though he be vaft, and terrible, yea and cru el too, when he is fet to do mifchief, or when he is mad 5 yet otherwife is a tame gentle Creature, fo that the dread of this huge beaft, moft appears to the eyes. But notwithftanding his terriblenefs, I once there faw a Creature compared with an Ele phant , not much bigger tl\an a fmall Fifh compared with a Whale, boldly to encounter one of them. The occafion by which this fo c&amp;me to pafs offers it felfthus .• that year I went for Eaji-India, the Merchants here (as from the Ring of England^ in whofe name they fent all their Prefents) amongft many other things, then fent the Mogol fome great Englifh Maftives, and fome large Irifh Greyhounds^ in all to the number of eight, difperfed in our feveral Ships 5 one of thofe high fpirited Maftives in our Voyage thither, upon a day feeing a great Shoal or company of Porpifc.es (before defcribed) mounting up above the waves, and coming toward that Ship wherein he was, fuddenly lept over- boajd to encounter with them, before any did take notice of that fierce creature .* to prevent that engagement, wherein he was irrecoverably loft, the Ship then having fuch a frefh gale of winde. aaj BS;of A Voyage to E A S T-I N D I A, &amp;c. wind, that fbe could riot fuddenly flack her courfc, whereby that poor creature might have been preferved. Another, one of the Iriih Greyhounds had his head (hot off in our fight. The Mange was the deftrudion of four more of them 5 only two of the Maftives came alive to Eafi-India, and they were carried up. each of them drawn in a little Coach, when I went up to the Embaffador, that he might prefent them to the Mogol The fiercell: of thefe two, inour way thither, upon a time breaking loofe, fell upon a very large Elephant that was hard by us, faft- ning his teeth in the Elephants Trunk, and kept his hold there a good while, which made that huge beaft extremely to roar 5 and though the Elephant did fwing the Maftive up and down above ground many times (as not feeling his weight) that he might throw him off} yet he could not fuddenly do it, but at laft freeing himfelf trom the dog by throwing him a good fpace from him, there came a Mungril Gurr of that Gountrey towards our Maftive, who then loft this his moft unequal match, fell up on that dog and kill'd him, by which means we recovered our Maftive again into our cuftody, he having not received any ap parent hurts ^ by which we may fee how much Courage and Mettl^ there is in thofe right fierce Maftives. This ftory pleafed the Mogol very much when the dogs were prefented to him, and he allowed each of them four attendants of thofe Natives to wait upon them, who by turns two and two together carried them up and down with him in FaUnkees^ (after defcribed) to which they were tied 3 and the other two went by them, fanning the Flies from off them , and the King cauled a pair of filver tongs to be made on purpole, that with them when he pleafed, he might feed thofe dogs with his own hand. But this ftory by tfee way. The Mogol hath many of his great Elephants train'd up for the war,who carry each of them one iron Gun, about five foot long ? lying upon a ftrong frame of wood, made fquare that is fitted to a thick broad Pannel faftned about him, with very ftrong and broad Girfes or Girts. The Gun like an Harquebufs hath a piece of iron like a Musket-reft faftned on the fides thereof, made loofe to play up and down. The bottom of that Iron Reft (b fixed, is long, to be let through that frame of wood on the forefide, and fo to be keyed in at the bottom. At the four corners of this frame are fmall flags of filk, with fundry devices painted on them, put upon little neat coloured ftaves, upon the neck of the Elephant fits a m^n to guide him, and within the frame a Gunner, to make his (liot as he finds occafion. The Piece thus mounted, carries a bullet about the bignefsof aTenni-s Ball. Some Elephants the King keeps for the execution of Male factors 5 the manner how, follows in Setfion 23. And fome he keeps to carry himfelf and women 5 and fome Elephants are kept for State (of which more when I (hall come to fpeak more particularly of the great Afogol.) Other Elephants are there ira- ployedA Voyage to EAST-INDIA, &amp;c. ployed for the carrying of burdenSj their ftrength being fo great as that they will bear a marvellous weight: The Elephants are all governed with a fmall rod of fteel about half a yard long, made (harp on the lower end, and towards that end there is an hook returned, like a Fifh-hook, thaxis very (harp likewife ^ by which their Riders fitting on thefrnecks 3 pull them backj or prick them forward at their pleafure. Thefe vaft Creatures;, though the Countrey be exceeding fruitful, and all provifions in it cheap, yet by realbn of their huge bulk, if they well be kept and fed, are very chargeable in keeping 5 they are kept ufiially under the fhade of great Trees, where by a ftrong chain of iron upon one of their hind-legs they fatten them. And as they ftand, the abundance of Flies vex them,and therefore with their fore-feet they makedufl ? (the ground ufually being very dry) and with their Trunk caft the dull: about their bodies to drive away thofe Flies from them. The King allows every one of thofe great male-Elephants four femals, which in their language they call their wives. Thefe brutes (as they fay) will not endure any to behold them when they are coupling together 5 which may condemn many who call themlelves men and women, but have fo loft all modefty, that they are not ajhamed when they commit my a£t of filthinefs^ no they are not ajhamed^neither can they blujh. The Female Elephants Cas they further lay) carry their young, one whole year ere they bring them forth 5 Thirty years expire ere they come to their full growth 3 and they fulfill the accuftomed age of men ere they die. And laftly, notwithftanding the great Number thereof thofe vaft Creaturesj and theexceffive charge in keep ing them well, they value them at exceeding high rates. For this people, when as they journey from place to place,the men of theinferiourfort go all onfoot, their women that can not fotravel, ride on little Oxen, inured to carry burdens, or on Afles, which carry their little children with them, the wo men like the men afh ide. Others that are of better quality ride on Horfes, Mules, Camels, Dromedaries^relfe in flight Coaches with two wheels covered on the top and back-end, but the fore-part and fides open, unlefs they carry women. Thofe Coaches will carry four perfons befide the driver, but two may lie at eafe, and at length in them upon quilts, that lie in the bo dy of them, upheld by girt-web, with which they are bottom'd, which makes them by far more eafie. Thefe Coaches are cove red for men of quality with fome thing that is coftly^ much of our Englijh broad cloth that is died red, is there bought from us and imployed for that ufe. At the back-end of this Coach they have a long round bolfter, that reacheth both fides, ftuffed with Cotten-wool, and covered with Velvet or Sattin, or with fome other thing that is rich. Thefe Coaches are drawn by Oxe ^one yoke to a Coach 5 fome of which Oxen have their fhort horns neatly tipped with filver plate, and fome others with brafs 5 and theythey have each of them a fine Collar of large round bells 3 ibihe of them made of Silver. They are pared and futed as our Coach -horfes for ftature and colour v moft of them thus imploy- ed are white, and fome pide^ or (potted all over with ieveral colours. They are guided with fmall cords ;which go through the parting of their Noftrik, and fo twixt their horns into the Coach-mans hand, who by thefe reftrainsthem when, and guides them how he pleafeth ^ and when he would have them go on, pricks them forward with a fmall and fhort ftaff he keeps in his hand pointed like a goad. Thefe Oxen there, are very neatly ' made, flender, ftrait-limb'd and not very large, but naturally very nimble, and by daily ufemadefo fit to perform that la bour, (being kept well (hod) as that they go twenty miles a day and more, with good fpeed. They keep thofe Oxen for this fcr- vice, as their horfes, well-drefled, and fo well fed, that they be plump and fat, and confequently very handfomto behold. The men there ot thegreateft rank and quality, ride fome- times in thofe Coaches, and fometimes on their curious Horfes, andfomerimeson their brave Elephants, but however they are carried, they have their horfes, which wait upon them when they go abroad, that they may beftride them when they pleafe. And at other times they ride on mensfhoulders, in ajflight thing they call a Palankee, made fomewhat like a Couch or *ftanding Pallat, covered with a Canopy, wherein a man may lie at his full length, as many of thofe Grandees do, when they are removed trom place to place, giving themfelves up t6 eafe, and over unto thole lins which follow it i and while they are thus carried,they make the (houlders and joints of thofe that feci their heavy weight, to bow and buckle under their burdens.

WHere firft, for their numerous Armies, it will appear to be no ftrange thing, if we confider the Great Mogal to be what he is, an overgrown Prince, (as before deferibed) in the vaft extent of his large Territories, being like a huge Pike in a great Pond, that preys upon all his neighbours, who therefore purchafe, and keep his favour by very great Prefents given him byway of homage, and a fubmifs acknowledgment of his mighty Power.

And there fore we fell at good rates our Englilh Sword-blads that will bow,; and become ftrait again. They have (and they (ay that for ma ny generations paft have had) great Ordnance, though they fel- dora make ufe of them in their Wars. * Their warlike Mufickarefome Kettle-drums carried on horfe- back, with long wind Inftruments, which make not Mufick, but noife, fo harih and unpleafing, that it is enough to fright away their enemies.

There are fbme of the Mogols own Subjeds which are men of courage \ thofe of note among the Mahometans are called TSalo- ches^ inhabiting adjoyning unto the Kingdom of Perfia, (fpoken of before) and there are others called Patans, taking their denomination from a Province of that name in the Ring* domof Bengala. Thefe will look art enemy boldly in theface^ and maintain with their lives, their reputation and valour. Amongft the many Sedts of Hindoos or Gentiles (after fpoken of) which are fubjeft to this King, there is but one race of fighters called Kajhloots , a number of which live by fpoil, who i-n Troops furprize poor Paffengers, tor the mofb part murther- ing thofe whom they get under their power* Thefe excepted, the reft of the Mogols Natives, for the generality of them^ had rather eat than quarrel, and rather quarrel than fight. I fay quarrel, for I have feveral times obferved there, that when two of them,, have been both well armed, and have moft (hamefully abufed one another, in bafer language than I can exprefs, yet durft not draw their weapons in conclufion, when one of them hath caught the other by the throat, and forced him up againft fome wall, the futfercr would cry out pitiouily, and the ftanders by would admire the other for his valour, faying, Shu-Abas 5 a proverbial fpeech amongft them relating to the late King of Jkf, called Sha-Abas, a Prince much renowned for valour 5 and when any man did a thing they thought gallantly^, they cryea Sha-Abas, ds much as to fay, it was done as well as the Peruatx King could have done it.

For they dare not look a man of courage in the face, though they be thus fortified, with fuch variety of weapons for their defence.

The truth is, that the Portugals, efpecially thofe whicli are born in thofe Indian Colonies, moft of thema mix'd feed begot ten upon thofe Natives, are a very low, poor-fpirited people, called therefore Gallinas delt Mar, The Hens of the Sea« One notable inftance to prove this .• it happened that the Eafi- India Company had a very little Pinnace, they called the which they kept in thofe parts for di(coveries ^ inann'dfhe was but with ten men, and had only one fmall Murdering-piece with in her.

However, upon this account there came upon a time at my firft coming ifito India^ unto the Faftory at Surat, where I then was, a moft valiant Portugal (if you will give him leave to tell his own flory, and believe it when he hath done) who firft for his peribn was a Quantus tantus^ tantillus^ a very poor, little dwar* fifh man, whole perfbn promifed as little valour as any that I ever faw, though I know that high courage is not tyed to an huge bulk, for (if ftoriesabufe us not) the Great was but a little man j but what ever Alexander vtzs, I am fure, that this was a poor little things but however he told us, that he was by birth an Hidalgo, which iignifies in Spanifti the Son of fome bo dy, or no ordinary man, but a Gentleman of Spain, and that he came from thence as a Companion to the King of Spain* Vice roy, fent to Goa, and himfelf was called the Knight with the Golden Rapier, and that fiiddcnly after his coming to Goa, he was honourably invited into the field, there to fight a fingle Combat with a very gallant man of that place, but he fbon left him there dead 5 and having done fo, the Viceroy prevented him with a pardon for that fadt, before he ask'd it a but willing him withall, now he had been fufficiently tryed, to confine his Rapier to its fcabbard. But he told us further, that he could not long after live quietly there, but was provoked again by a man of nigh refolution, unto a fecond encounter;, when he had the like fuccefs as before, in killing his Adverfary. The Viceroy now was very angry with him, but upon much intreaty, as he faid, pardoned him a fecond time 3 upon the receit of which fa vour he told us that he was then refolved to throw away his Ra^ pier, to get into a Religious Houfe, and there to remain the re^ (idue of his days, a Convertado or Penitent, But the Viceroy could not be long without his Company ^ and therefore to gain it, reftored him again into his former favour: But for himfelf he wasftilliounhappy (the fame of his great valour beingfpread abroad) as that he could not long enjoy that peace, and quiet, which he now fo much defired, but received a third Challenge from r ; *• Wi \&amp;l ;■ 1% ml % 1 S.U ttW, \3r i 1#1 In; Ml ii 390 1 ; % M ill ll / : A Voyage E A S T-I N D I A, from a very gallant, and very valiant man, as he defcrib'd him, a man big enough to beat aG^/i^and then he further told us, that his honour was ever more dear unto him than his life 3 and therefore notwithftanding the lofs of the Viceroys favour, and What elfe might happen , he entred the Lifts with him 5 and though he found him the ftouteft adverfary that ever he oppofed, yet after a long conflid this little Knight kill'd that great Gyant, and left him there dead likewife : which done, He (not daring to return any more unto Goa) told us, that he came naked out of the field as we then faw him with no ornaments (I aflure you) about him, fit to make him a Viceroys companion, nor any wea pon fit to Dub him Knight of the Golden Rapier. He further added, that he was now refolved not to live any longer amongft the Chriftians, but that he defired to live antongft the Englifh, butwhen we replyedthat we were Chriftians, he cried JeJu Ma r/a ! as wondring at it, and further told us, that he never heard fb before. When this Rhadowantadiji had ended his perillous ftory, it was dinner time, and the Merchants bid him to fit down with us and eat, and fo he did, where certainly he laid about him more valiantly than ever he had done before in the field, giving our meat many a cut, and eating, as if he had been more than half • ftarved. He continued with us there fdr fomefew days, and af ter, when his hunger was well fatisfied, and his fpirits well re- frefhed, he began to take fome exception againft his place at the T able, becaufe he eat at the lower end thereof, faying, that the company there were but Fadors, Servants, but he was a Gen tleman, and therefore his due place was higher at the board, but then correded himfelf,faying,that it was not to be much confider- ed where he fate, for his place made the upper end of the Table where ever he was placed : and fuddenly after, this Don Qnixot being weary of his ftay with us (though he was but too well ufed ) and having a great mind to ramble further, told our Com pany, that he being an Hidalgo, it was very difhonourablefor him to take entertainment upon the terms he had it 5 and there fore defired us to make a little Purfe for him, on which he would live as long as he could, and then creep into fome Defert place, and there repent and dye. And now our great Gheft, having fpent all his humour, and told us all his Dream, had his defire granted in fome money that was given to him 5 andfo we parted with our Knight Errant, who lived longer than he told us he would live, for half a year after I took notice of him at the gcls Court, and there I leave him. I will now ihortly relate a ftory of another of his Nation (and I do believe, as good a Gentleman as himfelf) who called himfelf Antonio de U Valla. It happened, that a little before pur co ming thence, my Lord Emballadour going from his own houfe to dine at the Engliih Fadory mSnrat, and I waiting on him, there appeared then to us a walking Skeleton 2 moft miferably clothed^ wclothed 5 the pooreft;, and leaneft Creature that ever mine Eyes beheld 5 who faintly begg'd of him fome relief, telling C what was true) that he was almoft quite ftarv'd 5 Ambafladour pittied and relieved him 3 and, as we return d back, found this poor Creature eating with fo much gree- dinefs, as if he could not have been fatisfied. He was then willed to come to our Houfe, and he did fo, and there was fed, and heartned up again, and then 3 when he was come to himfelf, told us, that he had endured there abundance of milery., which, as he acknowledged, did moft juftly befall him, becaufe he had there renounced his Religion, and become a Mahomtan y which, when he had done , no care was taken of him there, (Tor they regard not a Man that will not be conftant in his Reli gion, believing, that if that Bond cannot tye him, nothing will.) He told us further 3 that he was very forry that he had (b done, ar^d defired a paflage for England^ which was granted him 5 and he was put unto me as my Servant, and therefore I fitted him with Qothes,&amp;c. fit for his turn, but afterward (we being at Sea) he would often curfe and ban, and cry out, O Mml ventura ! O his hard hap ! and that of all the miferies which he had endured, this was the greateft5 that he, an Hidalgo, a Gentleman oi Spain, (hould live to become a Servant, and which was worfe, toferve an Heretick. I would, when I heard this of him (for hefpakenot fotome) tell him of it, and further mind him of that moft fad condition in which we found him, how that he had ftarv'd to death, if our pitty in the relief he found from us, had not even then prevented it. He would reply, that he knew not whathefaid ^ telling me, that his many mife- ries hadturn'd his Brains: ( Not to beftow any more Ink and Paper on him) we brought him afterward to Vlimmouth, and immediately after our arrive there, he defired his Liberty,which was eafily granted him, and from thence (having fome Money given him , more than he deferved) took his courfe 5 whither, I cannot tell, neither need my Reader defire to know. And therefore I will return again, as fwift as meditation or thought can carry me, unto Eafi-India, where I (hall in the next place fpeak SECTION VIM.

But there are Spoilers fometimes met with-all in thofe Pro vinces, that live by their Swords and Bows 3 having nothing for their fubfiftance ( becaufe they will take no other courfe ) but what they get by rapine andfpoil, of whom fome-what more afterward. And now by the way for thofe Villains who thus live, ('where- ever they be) and thofe fturdy Rogues who are next to them in guilt, by eating up the Bread of the Poor, having able limbs to carry them that they may beg from Houfe to Houfe, and Hands to receive Alms but none to labour^ boththefe being the very vermin of thofe Common-wealths , wherein they are fiiffered to breathe, it were very well if fuch of thefe as have not deferved to be cut off by the Hand of Juftice, were all (erved as Philip King of Mace don dealt with two Rogues, alterum e Macedonia fugere^ alterum ferfequi jujjit. He made one of them to whip the other out of his Country, and fo he was rid of both of them. But to return to the place from whence I am now digrefled. I travelled from Snrat with four Englilh-men more, and about twenty of the Natives in our Company, we beginning our jour ney the firft ofJ^-towardsSirT/ww^ Rowjai ihzMogoh Court, then above four hundred miles diftant from Snrat. We had fix Wagons drawn with Oxen in our Company, laden with rich Englifh Goods ('the principal part whereof was Englilh broad ClothJ affignd to an EnglifliMerchant at the Court, and fome other Carriages we had, of ail which we made a ring every night near fome large Town or Villagej where werefolved to ftay, and pitched our Huts within that Circle, fome of us watch ing, and the Natives with us, every night 5 we went on that long journey very fafely, only in fome places where there was any fufpicion of danger, we had a Guard of Horfe appointed to go with us for our defence, by the Command of Sultan Caroon then Prince, and now King, (who had his Revenew out of thofe parts we then travelled thorough) who fent a Foot-man, that continually kept us company , with his Letters to command a Company of Souldiers that were Horfe-men, to guard us where he thought good ^ who as they did not expeft, fo they would take no recompence for their pains, though we freely offered it them. But the Providence of God did fo order it, that though we had their Company in feveral places, we never had need of their help for our defence. The truth is, that the People there in general are very civil, and we never had any affronts or ill ufage from them, if we did not firft provoke them. But if we did, they would not well bear it, for twice in one Week, at my firft coming to Surat^ the whole Town in general were in an uproar^ and furrounded our Houfe there, both times ^bvr.-. fomenitfmi il . rro- [for but A Voyage to E A S T-I N O I A, &amp;c. fbme of our Englifh provok'd thofe Natives to ftir againft qs;, but hy our fpepdy Addrefles unto the G oyernour of that place, we excufing the fault of thofe that mimTEreH^nieoccafion of their difcontent, they being newly come thither, and altogether un acquainted with their cuftoms, he prefently commanded that wild ACTembly to depart from our Houfe ^ and fb immediately they did, we receiving no hurt at allfromr any of them. When my Lord AmbaOadour at firft arrived at Svrat, fo it was, that an Engliih Cook he carryed with him, the very firft day of bis coming thither, found a way to an Armenian Chri- ftians Houfe, who fold Wine, which in that place, they, call Armeniarr Wine.

The Cook had his Head quickly over-fraighted with it, and then ftaggenng home-ward, in his way met the Governours Brother Surat ^ as he was riding to his Houfe the Cook made a ftand, {laying lim- iclf up upon his Sword and Scabbard, and cry'd out to the Go vernours Brother , Now thou Heathen Dog !

What fayeftthou? the Cook anfwered him with his Sword and Scabbard, with which he ftrook at him, but was im mediately feized on by his followers, and by them difarm d and carrved to Prifon •, the Ambafladour had prefent intelligence ofc the mifbehaviour of his drunken fervant, and immediately lent word unto the Governour's Brother, that he was not come thither to patronize any diforderly perfon, and therefore defir d him to do with him what he pleafed, upon which he P rcient |y fenthim home, not doing him the leaft hurt.

Upon which this nioft intemperate mad youth, who was like Philocles, that angry Poet 5 and therefore called, Choler and Brine, [ for he was the moft hafty and cholerick young man that ever I knew^] as will appear by his prefent carriage, which was thus5 firfi: he beat that ftranger, for refufing to hold his horfe, with his horfe-whip, which, I muft tell you, that people cannot endure, as if thofe whips ftung worfe than Scorpions.

But this fb anger (being whipt as before) came up and complained to me^ but to make him amends, that frantick young man (mad with rage, and he knew not wherefore) prefently followed him, and being come up clofe to him, difcharg'd his Piftol laden with a brace of bullets diredly at his body, which bullets, by the (pe dal guidance of the hand of God, fo flew, that they did the poor man no great hurt, only one of them firft tearing his coat, bruifed all the knuckles of his left hand, and |:he other brake his bow which he carried in the fame hand. We prefently dilarmed our young Bedlam, till he might return again to his wits. But our greateft bufineft^-was how to pacific the other mail, whom he had thus injured .* I prefently gave him a Roopee, in our money two (hillings and nine pence 5 he thanked me for it, and would have taken it with his right, but I defired him to take it with his maim'd hand, and fb he did, and could clinch it very well, which I was glad of. Then we did (hew (as we had caule) all the dif- like we could againft that defperate ad of him, from whom he re ceived his hurt, telling him, that we were all ftrangers, and for our parts had done him no wrong at all 5 and therefore hoped that we (hould not be made any way to fufTer for the faults of another: and we further told him, that if he would be quiet till we came up to the Court, he (hould have all the (atisfadtion he could defire.

The great man replied, that it wa^not well done ot us, but he hadnothing to do with it 5 and fo departed on his way. That night after, we came to a ftrong large Town, and placing our fclves on the liae of it, he did what he could ('as we imagined) to raife up that People againft us, fome of them coming about us to view us, as E e e 2 weX A Voyage ^EAST-INDIA, we conceived, but , putting on the belt confidence we could, and landing then upon our guard, and all of us watching that night but (in a fpecial rnanntr) by the good providence of God, who' kept us mall our journey, we here felt none of that mifehief wefcarecU but early in the morning quietly departed without the Itfau moltliation. After which, with a little money, anda great many good words, we fo quieted this man, that we never afterheard any more complaining from him. So that (as before oblerv ed) wc were not at anytime many dangers of fufferine by that people, but fome of our own Nation were the procurine caules of it. ■ 6 Before I obferved , that for the generality of this people thej have very low and timorous fpirits, but there are fome I named in my laft Sedion, who are ftout daring men, as the Ba- loches., Patans, and Raftiboots, who, as they have the honour above all the reft of the people in thofe large Provinces to be accounted valiant; fo, as occafion is offered, they will (hew themlelyes fo to be : and therefore they are much hired as Convoys, to fccure Mens Perfons and Goods, from place t0 £ ape - 1 . r, • i ^ o r ''Ole Provinces , they are not without Mountains of prey, and Taberpacles of Robbers, as David and Job fpeak ; where defperate nicn keep in fome Woods and Deferts 3 which are nt&gt;t far from great road-ways, -njoft frequented and ufedj and there, like the wild jrahetjn Companies,meet and fpoil, and de- Paflengers, when they exped them not, it being the enrfed manne^ of thoie Spoilers, if they prevail againft them vvhom they furpnfe, to kill them before they rifle them 5 and therefore the firft thing heard from them is, that is.

We were .often told of them as we travelled fometimes in t ie xiightj by reafon of the extreani liCtit of the day Rafter we Iiad taken leave of tljie Ring, and fo were journeying towards £«r#t)that we (hould meet with thofe cruel villains 5 but, through Gods mercy, we were never in danger of them but once j and that was about midnight, neer a large City called Eredera 5 but we being a competent number of Englifli-men together , about twenty, and all .of us refolved to fell air byes at as dear a rate as we could, and having twice fo many In dian iervants with us, which are very nimble with their Bows and Arrows, we with our Piftols and Carbins, which we pre- entjy ducharged amongft them, and our Indians plying them with their Arrows, made them fuddenly to retreat, we recei ving little hurt from them;but after this,we made no more nieht- marches. &amp; Thofe Indians I named before, are fo faithful to their trufts unto whomfoeyer they engage, to the Englifli as well as to any other, that if they be at any time aftaulted, they will rather dye in their defence, than forfake them at their need. ' So L SSmA Voyage to EAST-INDIA, &amp;€. So t hat I am very confident, if an Englifti Merchant (hould tra vel alone with a very great treafure in GokL, and Jewels (both, or either) from Surat, to Labor y which is more than one thou- iand Eriglifti miles, and take thofe Indian fervants only for his company, and guard, and all they knew what he carried with him. He paying them their Wages, they would be fo far from injuring him of the leafl: peny of his wealth, that whofoever be- fides fhould attempt his fpoiling, muft make a way through their blood, before they (hould be able to do it. Here is a great? and good example of faithfulnefs, and it is very truel But I much doubt, that if a great Indian Merchant, I mean a Native of that Countrey, (hould come for England ivith like treaiiire, with a defire to pafs through this whole Nation, and fhould for his more fafe paflage take a guard of Sword-men here, aftd pay them well for their (ervice, they might lye under foch a ftrong tentation, as might make them tofpoil the Egyptian, by (hortning his journey, dividing his fubftance, and by difpofing fo of his per(bn, that it (hould never tell tales. But for that people, as their faithfulnefs is very remarkable, fo is their diligence very exemplary likewife 5 for they keep continually within the call of their Mafters, and will not at any time depart thence without fpeeial leave. And the plenty of all Provifions being very great throughout the whole Monar^hy^ they ferve at very low rates, which I never knew them to raife, not requiring more than five (hillings Sterling every new Moon 3 paid the next day after its Change, which is all the recompence they do defire, or exped from their Mafters, to provide them- felves with all neceflaries ———quibus hinc foga 0 Calceus hinc eji^ Et Fanisfumufyue Do mi.- Juven.

This fellow led one of our Camels^ and had been with us two moneths before 5 but upon this little failing him ? would needs leave us: but before he de parted he made a fpeech to his Camel 3 telling him 5 that he had led him thus long, and had during that time lived by him , but now our money (as he (uppofed) quite failing, he told him that he muft be gone, defiring God to blefs him 5 and that he might have fome other to lead him that might not be lefs care ful of him than he had been. So he took leave of his Camel, though not of us, and departed. All the reft of his company were perfwaded to continue with us, and had their pay a day or andfo we proceeded on our journey, and fo (hall I two after 5 further in this Difcourfe. the people, I (hall fpeak And now I have fpoken fomthing of SECTION IX. - - i * » » : i j i f 9 *, . . f Of their buildings in Villages^ Towns^ and Cities 5 Hon? their Houfes arefurnijhed , Of their Sarra's or Honfes for the entertainment of Paffengers ^ Of their Tents, If ells&gt; and of their places of pleafnre, &amp;c.

Thofe broad Tarrafes, or flat Roofs, fome of them lofty, are places where many people may ftand (and fo they often do) early in the morning, and in the evening late, like Camelions 5 to draw, and drink in frefli air 5 and they are made after this faQii- on, for profped, as well as pleafure. Thofe houles of twoftories, have many of them very large upper rooms, which have many double doors in the fides of them, like thofe in our Balconies, to open and let in freih air, which is likewifc conveyed in unto them, by many leflfer lights made in the walls of thofe rooms, which are always free and open 5 The ufe of glafs windows, or any other (hut tings, being not known there, nor in any other very hot Coun- treys.

It is their manner in many places, to plant about., and amongft their buildings, trees which grow high and broad, the fhadow whereof keeps their houfes by far more cool , this I obferv'd in a fpecial manner when we were ready to enter Amadavar for it appeared to us, as if we had been entring a Wood, rather than a City. That Amadavar is very large and populous City, entred by many fair Gates girt about with an high and thick Wall of Brick, which mounts above the tops of their houfes, without which wall there are no fuburbs.

For the Mogol, at my being there, had a very great Lion (I often faw^ which went up and down 3 amongft the people that frequented his Court, gent- Jy as a dog, and never did hurt^only he had fome Keepers which did continually wait upon him. , For thole wild and cruel Beafts,one of our Englifh-men watch- jng in a tree by night,(that ftqod not far from our dwelling)with a hre-lock charg d with fomelmallbullets,(hot a Tigre,andkird him Itone-deadgas he was coming towards us.lt was a large beaft. higher than an IriQi-Greyhound,withgrizled hair,a longhead,&amp; 'harp and fhort picked ears,having a mouth fil'd with cruel teeth^ arter which (we ufually keeping a little fire without our houfe evei ynight)were not fo much troubled] with thofe night-walkers.

And the truth is, that if they had them, the extrearti heat there would forbid the life of many of them •, all their bravery is upon their Floors, ail which are made eeven with fine Earth or Plaifter, on whieh they fpread their moft excellent Carpets in their Tents, as well as in their dwelling houfes, laying fome Coarfe thing under to preferVe them , on which they fit (as Taylors on their fhop-boards) when tfaey meet together, putting off their fhooes (which they ufual- ly wear asllippers and their feet bare in them) when they come to tread upon thofe foft Pavements^ and keeping them off till they remove thence, this helps to keep Cool their feet, and is very pleafant in thofe hot Countries. On thofe Carpets they deep in the night time, orelfe upon an hard Quilt, or lying up on a flight and low Bed-ftead they call a Cot^ bottomed with broad Girt-web made ofCottennvool. But where-ever they lye 5 they ftretch themfclves out at their full length when they goto fleep, uiually upon their backs, without any Pillow, or Bolfter, to raifeup their heads. Very many of the meaner fort of people (as I have often obferved) lye thus ftretched out to take their reft upon the ground, in the dry feafon of the year, with a white Callico-cloth fpread all over them, which makes them to appear like fb many dead corpfes laid forth for burial. - This lying fo at length with their bodies thus extended, may be one reafbn why the people there are all fo ilraight limn d, ha-^ ving none crooked amongft them ? and another, becaufc they never girt, nor lace in their bodies (as before was obferved). Some of thole flight Bed-fteads, they call Cots, in their ftanding houfesbang by ropes, a little above ground, which are faftnedto the four corners, thereof $ moved gently up and down, by their fervants, to lull them afleep* - t They have no Inns in thofe parts for the entertainment 01 ftrangers -&gt; but in fbme great Towns large Houfes they cajl raas very fobfVantially built, with brick, or (lone, where any Paflengers may find houfe-room andufe it without any recom- pence s but there is nothing to be had befide room, all other things they mufl provide and bring with them, as when tiey lodge in Tents. . r , • ' Amongft their Buildings I muft take fpecial notice ot their Wells andTankes, upon both which in very many places they beftow exceeding much coft in ftone-work 5 then e s which are fed with Springs^ they make them round, but very wide and large.

Thefe great recepta cles of water, are made neer places that are very populous; fill'd when that long feafon of rain (before fpoken of) comes, imme diately before which time, they clenfe them, that the water may be more clear, and wholfom. They hold water all the dry fea- ion or the year. \ For their places of pleafure, they are in their Groves, where their curious Fruit-frees (before defcribed) grow 5 but efpecially m their Gardens,, wherein they plant little Vineyards that afford marvellous fair and fwect Grapes, which they cut green for tbek eating, or make Raiions of them. But for Wine, they make none, becaufe their Mahomet forbids the drinking thereof. In thofe Gardens likewife [ they have many Pome-granat-trees with all other of the choieeft fruits and flowers their Country affoids S to which Nature daily yields fuch a fupply, as that there is beauty to be leen in thofe Trees, and Plants, and that continually.

For their paftimes within doors, they have Cards, but much different from ours in the figures made inthem, and in their greater number of fuits. Thofe Cards I have often feen ; S have been more often told, that they have very good skill in that mofl innocent and ingenious game we call Chetie. They delight themfelves fometimes with the Company of Mountebanks, and Juglers. Fox their Mountebanks 5 they keep venemous Snakes in balkets, and will fuffer themfelves* to be bitten or ftung by them 5 which part thus bitten, or ftung, pre- fently (wells, and immediately after that, they cure themfelves again by Oyls and Powders, which they apply unto the place 3 and then offer to fell them unto the people ftanding by. * Their Juglers are the cunningft that ever I (aw, to do ftrange things by fleight of hand, as in this trick I (hall here name: where I have obferved them to lay downfcuttles or broad opert Wicker-balkets upon the ground, three or four one upon ano ther, all which appeared empty, as they laickhem down 5 but taking them up again one after the other, in the bottom of them there would appear, three or four living Turtle-doves .• which they would cover again with the fame Scuttles^ and toffing and turning them as they took them off, and iu&gt; the fecond time, none of tho(e pretty creatures were to be feen any more. But how they firft conveyed them thither, and how after thence 3 we could not poffibly difcover. For their Paftimes abroad they have Hawks of divers kinds, greater and lefs, and Partridges, and other choice Fowl great ftore to fly at. They have Hares, and Antilops, with other wild Beafts to hunt, and the(e not a few.

Therefore though they have abundance of flelh and towl, and have fifh too, yet are they temperate in all of them. 101 Swipes flefh, it is an abomination unto the Mahometans ^ andtheiefore they touch it not. And for other kind of fiefh, they eat very little of them alone, to make their full meals of them, for they drefs no kind of fkfh in great pieces, or whole joynts, nor fcarce any of their fowls whole. ^A Voyage to E A S T-I N DI A, &amp;c.

But their great common ftanding difh there is Rice, which they boy I with more Art than we: for they boyl the grain fo as that it is full, and plump 3 and tender, but not broken in boyling} they put to it a little green Ginger, and Pepper, and Butter, and this is the ordinary way of their drefling it, and fb 'tis very good. Sometimes they boyl pieces of flefh, or Hens, and other Fowl cut in pieces in their Rice, which difh they call ?iUavp\ as they order it, they make it a very excellent, and a very well-tafted Food* Once my Lord Ambafladour had an Entertainment there by Afaph Chan^ who invited him to dinner (and this was the only re* fped in that kind he ever had , while he was in Eafi-India ) That Jfaph Chan was a Man made by his great Alliances, the greateft Subjeft and Favourite in all that Empire ^ for his Sifter was the Mogol's moft beloved Wife, and his Daughter was mar ried unto Sultan Caroon the Prince, and very much beloved by him, but of allthefe, more afterward. This Afaph Chan entertained my Lord AmbafTador in a very fpacious and a very beautiful Tent, where none of his fol lowers befides my felf, faw, or tafted of that Entertainment. That Tent was kept full of a very pleafant Perfume in which fents the King and Grandees there take very much delight. The floor of the Tent was firft covered all over with very rich and large Carpets, which were covered again in the places where our dinner ftood, with other good Carpets, madeof ftitch'd Leather, to preferve them which were richer 5 and thefe were covered again with pure white and fine Callico Clothes, and all thefe covered with very many difhes of Silver, but for the greater part of thofe Silver dilhes they were not larger than our largeft trencher-plates, the brims of all of them gilt. We fate in that large Room as it were in a Triangle, The Ambafladour on Afaph Chan's right hand a good diftance from him, and my felf below 5 all of us on the ground, as they there all do when as they eat, with our Faces looking each to the other. 4 0 7 UK 1 11 %A Voyage to E A S T-IN DI A, &amp;€. otheiand every one of us had his (everal mefs. The Ambaf- fadour had more difhes by tenj and I lefs by ten, than our en tertainer hadj yet for my part I had fifty difties. They were all fet before us at,once, and little paths left betwikt them, that our entertainers fervants ( for otiely they waited ) might come and reach them to us one after another;, and fo they did. So that I taftedof all fet before me, andofmoft did but tafte, though all bf them tafted very well. ISow of the provifion it felf, for our larger diftieS;, they wete filled with Rice 3 drefled (as before defcrib'd.) And this Rice was prefented to us, fome of it white 3 in its own proper colour, fome of it made yellow with Saffrdn, and fome of it was made green', and fome of it put into a purple colour, but by what Ingredient I know not, but thi ^iamfure, that it all tafted very well -. And with Rice thus ordered, feveral of our difhes were furrtilhed, and very many more of them with fiefla of ftveral kinds, and with Hens, and with other fort of Fowl cut in pieces, as before I obfetved in their Indian Cookery. i: To thefe we had many Jellies,' and Culices 5 Rice ground to flower, and then boyled, and after fweetned with Sugar -Candy and Ro(e-Water tp be eaten cold.

Many other difhes we had, made up in Cakes of feveral forms, of the fineft of the wheat-flower, mingled with Almonds and Sugar-Candy, whereof (bme were fented, and Ibme not.

Almonds blanched, Raifons of the Sun 5 Prunellas, and I know not what, of all enough to make up thiat number of difhes before named j and with thefe quelque chafe, was that entertain ment made up. And it was better a great deal, than if it had confifled of full and heaped up difhes, fuch as arefometimes amongfl: us pro vided, for great and profufe entertainments.

The meaner fort of people thjere eat Rice boy led with their green-Ginger and a little Pepper, after which they put Butter into it, which is their principal difli, and but feldom eaten by them : But their ordinary Food is made fnot oftheflowrof Wheat) but of a coar(e well tafled Grain ^ made up in round broad and thick Cakes, which they bakfe upon their thin iron plates ( before fpoken of) which they c^rry with them, when as they travel from place to place ^ when they have bak'd thofe Cakes 5 they put a little Butter oto them: And doubt- lefs the poor people find this a very hearty Food, for they who live moft upon it, are as ftrong a^ they could be, if they had their diet out of the Ring's Kitchin. I fhatl here fay no more of this^ but proceed to fpeak. SECTION XL Of the Civilities of this People 5 Of their Complements^ and of their Habits* ANd here the People in general (as before was obferved ) are as civil to Strangers as to their own Country-men j for they ufe when they meet one another, or when they meet ftrangers, to bow their Heads, or to lay their right Hands on their Breads, and to bow their Bodies as they pafs, faluting them further with many well-wifhes. They ufe not to uncover their Heads at all, as we do in our Salutes, (from which cuftom of ours, the Turk? borrow this imprecation for their Enemies, wiftiing tHeir Souls no more reft after death than a Chriftians hat hath, which is alwayes ftirred ) but the meaner fort, inftead of uncovering their Heads to their SuperiourSj ufe thefe abject Ceremonies, by putting their right Hand to the Earth, and then laying it on their Heads, or by fal ling down on their Knees^ and then bowing their Heads to the Earth ^ both fignifying, that thofe unto whom they (hew thefe G g g reve^ vm 1 VP in!

When we vifit the people there of better quality, they enter tain us with much humanity 5 firfl: rifing up to us 5 they bow their Bodies ? and then entreat us to (it with them on their Carpets, where they arc free in their difcourfe,which we ufually exchange with them by an Interpreter. If we have any bufinefs with them, they return very civil and fair Anfwers, and for our further entertainment give us Beetle or Panne to chew, f before fpoken of.) 1 \ . In their near, and more clofe and hearty Salutes, they do not joyn Hands as we, but do that which is hateful to the Spaniard^ and not at ail in ufe with'us ^ for they take one another by the Chin, or Beard, and cry Bobba 3 which is. Father 5 or Bij, which is. Brother: And this appears to be a very ancient C©mple- ment, for thus Joab /long ago faluted^w^, 2 Sam, 20.9. But this they do in love, not as Joah did therCj in Treachcry. In their Complements they exprefs many good willies to one another, as Salam Allacum^ God give you healthy the reply, AUacum Salam, Thefame health God give you. hn&amp;Greb-a.

Now as this People of Eaji-India are civil in their (peeches, (o are they civilly clad 5 for there are none who wear their own fkin alone for their covering , as very many in the weftern India do. For the Habits of this People, from the higheft to the loweft, they are all made of the fame fafhion, which they ne ver alter nor change 5 their Coats fitting clofe to their Bodies unto their Waftes, then hanging down loofe a little below their Knees, the lower part of them fitting (bme-what full^ thofe clofe Coats are faftned unto both their Shoulders, with (lips made of the fame Cloth,which 3 for the generality 3 arc all made of coarf- er, or finer white 5 and in like manner are they faftned to their Wafte, on both fides thereof, which Coats coming double over their Breafts, are faftned by like flips of Cloth, that are put thick from their left Arm-holes to their middle 3 The fleevesof thofe Coats are made long, and fome-what clofe to their Arms, that they may ruffle, efpecially from their Elbows to their Wrifts. Under this Coat they ufually wear another Height one, made of the fame Cloth, but (horter than the other, and this is all they commonly wear upon the upper part of their bodies. But fome of the greater fort in the cooler feafons of the ' , . , ^ ' day Niltenter. wtliei r ^petSj A Voyage to EAST-INDIA, &amp;&gt;€. day there, will flip on loofe Coats over the other, made either of quilted Silk 5 or Callico , or of' our Englifli Scarlet-broad cloth (for that is the colour they moft love.) Under their Coats they have long Breeches like unto Irifti-troufeS;, made ufu* ally of the fame cloth, which come to their Anckles, and ruflle on the fmall of their legs. For their feet, they keep them (as was before obferved) always bare in their ihooes. Some of their Grandees makes their Coats and Breeches of ftriped Taffataof feveral colours, or of fome other filk fluff all of the fame colour, or of flight cloth of Silver or Gold, all made in that Country* But pure white and fine Callico-laune, (which they there make likewife) is for the moft part the height of all their bravery 5 the collars, and fome other parts of their upper coats, being fet off with fome neat ftitching. Upon their heads they wear a long wreath of cloth, about half a yard broad, ufually white, but fometimes of other co lours. Which cloth worn for their head-covering, is fometimes inter-woven in fpaces with threds of coloured filk, or iilver, or gold } and when not fo, one end of that wreath of cloth worn by Gallants is ufually thus inter-woven 5 and fo put upon their heads, that its gaynefs may appear. This headTCOvering of theirs, they call a Stwfh, which incircles their heads many times, and doth mervelloufly defend them from the violence of the Sun» And becaufe this covering muft needs keep their heads hot, they provide for this^ as well as they can, by (having the hair continually from off them. And they have girdles made of the lame wreaths of cloth for the better fort, /thus inter-woven, which come twice at leaft about them, made very trim with that kind of weaving, efpecially on both ends, which hang down di- redly before them. , • ' . ; And thus have I prefented a Mahometan there in his proper drefs whofe habit will more vifibly appear together in the JMo~ gols Pidure, portrayed and after put into this difcourfe. ^ Now for the Mahometan women,,, (becaufe I had never fight of thofe of the greateft quality) I cannot give fuch an account of them in refped of the Habits. For thefe, unlefs they be dif- honeft, or poor, come not abroad 5 but for the fafhion of their Garments, they do not differ much from thofe the men wear, for they wear Coats, and Breeches ohe very like, the other, on ly women bind their longhair with Phillets, whicWiang down behind them. They wear likewife Upon their heads Mantles or Vails (ufually made of white Callico ^ or of their Pintados) which hanff down over their other Garments-. .. urt er, t e women have their EarsJwred, not only in their flaps, but roun about them, wherein they wear yery little Pendants r thole ot the richer fort are made of flat, narrow and thin pieces of Gold or Silver ^ thofe worn by the poorer fort mac e o t-i as, C)r • kept bright, fo that all are in the fame ialhion Ttn-y c 0 T v work upon the edges and ends of thofe Pendants. And ^9 G g g 2 womenA Voyage to E AST-INDI A, &amp;c. women have the lower part of their left Noftrils pierced, wherein they wear a Ring (when tTaey pleafe) of Gold, or Sil ver 5 or of fome other bafer Metals, Thofe Rings of Gold have little Pearls faftned to one end of them, and that Pearl is dril a through, that both ends of the ring may meet in it. And doubt! efs, the women of the greateft quality (though I faw it not) are bedeck'd with many rich Jewels. This I have obferved in feme of thofe of the better fort I there (aw, that they did wear great broad hollow Rings of Cold enamel'd 5 and fome made of Silver, or Brafs, upon their wrifts, and upon the fmall of their legs, to take off and on 5 two or three of them upon each Arnij and Leg, which make a tinkling noife, very proba bly fueh Ornaments asthejewifh women were threatned for, Ifaiah 3. where Almighty God tells them, that he would take away their tinkling Ornaments about their feet, the tiracelets, and the Ornaments of their legs, their Rings, and Nofe-jewels, For my Lord Embafladour, and his Company, we all kept to our Englifh Habits, made as light and cool as poffibly we could have them. His waiters in red Tafiata Cloaks guarded with green Tatlata, which they always) wore when they went abroad with hinij my felf in a long black Caflbck 5 and the co lours and falhion of our garments were fo different from theirs, that we needed not, wherefoever we were, to invite fpe^ators to take notice of us. And now, the Conftancy there obferved by the Natives of both (exes, in keeping to their old faftiions in their Habits, ex- ampled to them by their Predeceflors in many foregoing Gene rations, and by them (Hll continued, is the great praife of this people, as the commendation of every Nation in the World al- moft, befidesours, ftillconftant to their ancient falhions in their Apparel. SECTION XII. Of their Language, their Boohj, their Learning, See, TH E Language of this Empire, I mean the Vulgar, bears the name of it, and is called Indoftan; it hath much affi nity with the Perfian, and Arabian Tongues: but the Indoftan is a fmoother Language, and more eafie to be pronounced than the other, a Language which is very (ignificant, and fpeaks much few words; They write k (as we) to the right hand. It is ex- prefled by letters, which are very much different from tliofe Alphabets, by which the Perfian and Arabian Tongues are form* ed. The Perfian there is fpoken as their more quaint and Gourt-tongue. The Arabian is their learned Language, both written 'backward to the left hand like the Hebrew^ from whenceemupoti tiity A Voyage ^EAST-INDIA, they borrrow many words, which come fo near it, as that he who is a good Critick in the Hebrew may very well guefs at the meaning of much in both thofe Languages, The Perfian is a Language^ as if it confifted all of Guttural letters (as fome in the Hebrew Alphabet are called) filling the mouth in the pro nunciation of them 5 for as the words in that Language are full of fenfe, fo in their fpeaking they are full of found. For the Latin and Greek, by which there hath been fo much knowledg conveyed into the World, they are as ignorant of them both, as if they had never been 5 and this maybe one great reafon why there is fo little learning amongft them. But for the people themfelves, they are men of very ftrong reafon, and will fpeak ex re nata, upon any offered occafion, very exceed ing well ^ and doubtlefs they are a people of luch ftrong Capa cities, that, were there literature amongft them, they might be the Authors of many excellent works 5 but as the cafe ftands with them, all that is there attainable towards Learning, is but to read and write. And here by the way let me infert this, that I never faw any Idiot or natural Fool, nor any deformed perfon amongft them, in any of thole parts. For Logick and Rhetorick which are fo inftrumental, the firftto enlarge, and the fecondto polifti difcourfes, they have none but what is Natural. They fay, that they write fome wit ty Poems, and compofe many handfom Annals and Stories of their own, and other adjacent Countries. They delight much in Mufick, and have fome ftringed, but many more Wind-inftruments 5 They have the ufeot Timbrels likewife 5 but for want of pleafing Airs, their Mufickin my ears never feemed to be any thing but difcord. Their Books are not many, and thofe are Manufcripts. That rare and happy invention of Printing, which hath been the ad vancement of fo much learning within Chriftendom, is not known without it. - They have heard of Arijiotle^ whom they call Ajtlis^ and have fome of his Books (as they fay) in the Arabian Tongue, in which Language (they further fay) they have many Books writ ten by Avicenna^ that ancient Phylitian, who was born in ^larchAtjdia^ one of the moft fam'd places within the Tartarian Empire, the Country (as they believe) where *1 amber lain ^ the Magols gxczt Anceftor, drew his firft breath. Someparts or fragments they have of the oldTeftament 5 or which more, when lihall cometo fpeak of their Religion. Many amongft them profefs themfelvs to have great skill in Judicial Aft rology, that great Cheat, which hath been very an ciently, and often put upon (as the Sacred Story witnefleth) the |jeopleinhabiting the Eaft, and South parts of the World, call it a Cheat, becaufe there is, and muft needs be, io mucn Uncertainty in it 5 all things here below being ordered., and over- 1 m m y ■n iff I4 I 4 (! iy i r|| i it |;1J .iili if A Voyage to E A S T-IN DI A, fac. ruled;, by the fecret , and unerring providence of Almighty GoA, which frnfirateth the tokens of the Lyars, and maketh Di^ viners mad 5 that tnrneth wife men backward^ and makpth their knotvledg foolifi 3 Efay 44. 25. Firft, thefe Diviners are mad when things fall not out according to their bold predidHons 5 And fecondly 3 they have been, and not without caufe, efteem- ed as mad-men, in foretelling things which they could not know, and much lefs bring to pafs. And therefore I have heard a great Matter in, and a publick Profeffor of, Aftronomy, who could fee as far into Conftella- tions, andobferve as much from them as any other, often fay, that he would go by the very felf lame rules that others did, to predid things to come^ and would write that which was&lt;juite contrary to what they obferved, yet what he wrote (hould as of ten fall to be as true as what they foretold. Yet notwithftanding the truth of thefe premifes, the great Mogol puts fo much confidence in his Aftrologers, that he will not undertake a journey, nor yet refolve to do any thing befides of the leaft confequence, unlefs his Wizards tell him, it is a good and a prolperous hour, to begin, and fet upon fuch an under taking , and at the very inftant he hath his directions from them, he fets upon the thing he undertakes, and not before. SECTION XIII. Of their Phyfitians, Difeafes, Cures, lVbe?t they begin their year , How they meafnre their time, &amp;c. HEre arethofe which pretend unto much skill in Phyfick, though (for ought I could ever there obferve) the people make but little ufe of them, they fearing more Medicum quam Morhum 5 and therefore do believe the Phyfitian to be the more dangerous difeafe. The common Difcafesof that Countreyare Bloody-Fluxes, with others that come not to blood, Hot-Fevers, Calentures, which feize on and fire the head and brain, more than other parts. Thefe, many times put our men at Sea into very high di- ftempers, efpecially while they are under the Torrid Zone, which makes the poor creatures vifited with them, fbmetimes to conceit the fpacious Sea and Waves therein to be great Fields full of Haycocks 5 and if they were not fometimes happily pre vented, would leap over-board to tumble in them. For ordinary Agues, fuch as are fb common among us, and forthofe two torments rather than difeafes(when they are felt in extremity) the Gout and the Stone, they have the happinefs to be ignorant of them. y But fometimes they are vilited with an inflamination,or an ex- tream ■ i J J}ar e » infimrf- A Voyage to E A S T-I N D I A, &amp;c. treme Burning^ fach as is fpoken of^ Deut ,28.22. or rather with st moft grievous Peftilence, which on a fudden fweeps away many thonfands when it comes into great populous Cities. This Pefli- lence makes the bodies of Men there which are vilited with it^ like an Houfe^ which on a fudden is covered all over with fire at once. The City Amadavar (at our being there with the King) was vifited with this Pejiilexce inthemoneth of May, and our Family was not exempted from that moft uncomfortable vifita- for within the (pace of nine dayes 3 feven perfons that were tion Englifli of our Family were taken away by it;, and none of thofe which dyed lay fick above twenty hours,, and the major part well and (ick, and dead in twelve hours. As our Surgeon (who was there all the Phyfician we had 3 and he led the way) falling fick at mid-day 3 and the following mid-night dead. And there were three more that followed hitn, one immediately after the other., who made as much hafte to the Grave as he had done., and the reft went after them 3 within that fpace of time (I named before.) And ( as before I obferved ) all thofe that dyed in our Family of this Pejtilence^ had their Bodies fet all on fire by it 5 fo foon as they were firft vifited j and when they were dy ing, and dead, broad fpots of a black and blew colour ap peared on their Breafts 5 and their flefti was made fo extreme hot by their moft high d^ftemper, that we who furvived, could fcarce endure to keep our hands upon it. It was a moft fad time, a fiery Tryal indeed. But fuch is the goodnefs of Almighty God, that he makes the miferies of Men here , dut tolerabiles, aut breves, either fufferable 5 or Ihort &gt; (b that if the thing impofed be extreme heavy to be born , it continues not long, as this moft grievous vifitation, moft violent for the time, ifke a/nighty ftorm, and then blown away. For here the mercy of God fuddenly fiept in, betwixt the living and the dead? fo that not onely in our Family, but alfo in that.great City, the Plague was ftayed. All our Family \_ my Lord Ambaffadour onely excepted ] were vifited with this ficknefs, and we all, who through Gods help and goodnefs out-lived it, had many great blifters, filFd with a thick yellow watery fubftance, thatarofe upon many parts of our bodies, which when they brake, did even burn and corrode our fkins, as it ran down upon them. For my part I had a Calenture before at Mandoa , which brought me even into the very Jaws of Death, from whence it pleafed God then to refcue and deliver me, which amongft thoufands and millions of mercies more received from him, hath, and (hall for ever give me caufe to jpeak^good of his Name, There are very few Englifh which come thither, but have fome violent ficknels, which if they efcape, and live temperate ly, they ufually enjoy very much health afterward.

And hehimfelf by violent Fluxes^ was twice brought even to the very brink of the Grave. The Natives of Eaji-Inclia in all their violent hotdircafes 3 make very little ufe of Phyficians, unlefs it be to breathe a Vein fometiines, after which they ufe much fafting as their moft hopeful remedy. The foul Difeafe is too common in thofe hot Climates, where the people that have it are much more affedfed with the trouble it brings, than with the fin or fhame thereof. The people in Edji-ItidiaYwe up to our greateft Ages^ but without all queftion they have more old people than we ^ a thing not to be wondered at, if weconfider the great Tempe rance of that people in general in their eating and drinking. But to proceed. The Hindooes or Heathens there begin their year the firft day of March. The Mahometans begin theirs, the tenth, at the very inftant as the Aftrologers there ghefs that the Sun enters into Aries , their year as ours is divided into twelve Moneths, or rather into thirteen Moons, for according to them they make many payments. They diftinguifti their time in a much different manner from us^ dividing the day into four, and the night into as many parts, which they call Pores $ which again they fubdivide each of them into eight parts, which they call Grees 5 meafured according to the ancient cu- ftom, by water dropping out of oneveffel into another, by which there alwayes ftands a Man appointed for that fervice, to turn that veffel up again when it is all dropped out, and then to ftrike with an hammer (^upon the brim of a concave piece of Metal, like the inner part of a large Platter, hanging by the brim on a wire J the number of thofe and G ! reex as they pafs. It hath a deep found, and may be heard very far 5 but thefe are not common amongft them. Neither have they any Clocks, or Sun-Dials, to (hew them further how their time pafleth. / W e lived there fome part of our t ime a little within, or under the Tropick^of Cancer^ and then the Sun was our Zenith&gt; or Ver- ticle at noon-day direftly over our heads, at his return to his Northern bounds ( of which I have fpoken lomething before.) The Sun-rifing there, was about fix hours in the Morning before its appearing here, fo that it is twelve of the Clock with them, when it is but fix with us. We had the Sun there above the Ho rizon in December, when the dayes are (horteft near eleven hours 3 and in when they are at their fulleft length, feme- what more than thirteen hours, which long ablenceof the Sun there from the face of the Earth, was very advantagious to cool both the Earth and Air. I proceed to fpeak SECTIONA Voyage to E A S T-IN D I A, &amp;c. SECTION XIV. Of moji excellent Moralities w amonoft the Fcoplc of thofe Nations. X.'!

For the Temperance of very many, by far the greateft part of the Mahometans and Gentiles, it is fuch, as that they will rather choofe to dye, like the Mother and heijeveu Sobs menti oned in the fecond of Macchahees and feventh Chapter, then eat or drink any thing their Law forbids them.

Which (hews their hatred of drunken diftempers j for none of the people there are at any time feen drunk, (though they might find li- quor 'enough to do it) but the very oftal and dreggsof that people, and thefe rarely, or very feldom. ■ „ And here 1 (hall infert another moft needful particular to my prefent purpofe, which deferves a moft high commendation to be civen unto that people in general, how poor and mean foeverthev be 5 and that is, the great exemplary care they ma- nifeft in their piety to their Parents, that, notwuhftandine they ferve for very little ( as I obferved before) but five (hillings a Moon for their whole livelyhood and fubfiftence; yet, it their Parents be in want, they will impart at the lealt halt ot that little towards their necelfaries, choofing rather to want themfelves .then that their Parents (hould fuffer need. For the Mahometans [who live much upon the labours of the Hindooes, keeping them under, becaufe they formerly conquer- ■ ed them] there are many ot them idle , and k ' 0 to eat than work , and thefe are all for tomorrow, a word very common in their mouths, and the word is wh&gt;ch figmfies to morrow, and when that day comes to morrow thev will fet down upon their bufinefles tomorrow, Z 7o any thing you wouldW them to do to *orro*.mmmmmmm s / m i l I ■1^ i &gt; A Vdyagejo EAST-INDIA, they will beftow any thing upon you tomorrow.

But.for the Hindooes^ or Heathens, the ancient inhabitants of Eaft-India, they are a very induftrious people, very diligent in all the works of their particular Callings, believing that Bread, fweeteft, and moft favory , which is gain'd by fweat. Thefe are for the generality the people that plant and till the gi^und: Thefe they which make thofe curious Manufactures that Empire-affords 5 working, as we fay, with tooth and nail 5 Employing their ears and toes, as well as their fingers, to affift them [ by holding threds of filk] in the making of fome things they work. Thefe are a people who are not afraid of a Lirn m the way, of a Lion in the fir eets , as the flothful man is Prw : 26.13, but they lay hold on the prefent time, the oppor tunity, to fet upon their bufinefles which they are to do today., tfiey being .very laborious in their feveral imployments, and v^ry fiqiiare and exaft to make good all their engagements. Which appears much ia their jnftnefs manifefted unto thofe that trtide with them &gt; for if a Man will put it unto their Confci- enc-es to fell the Commodity he defires to buy at as low a rate as he can afford it, they will deal fquarely, and honeftly with him ^ but if in thofe bargainings a man offer them much leis than their let price, they will be apt to fay. What, doftthou think me a ChriJUan^xhu I would go about to deceive thee ?

I (hall not need amongft men profefiing Chriftianity to write any thing in anlwer to thofe their frantick aflertions^either will I make it my bufinefs to enlarge my felfin thedifcovery of the Mahometan Religion, becauie that hath been done by fbmany hands already 5 only this I will fay of it, and not much more, that it hath Will-worftiip for its Foundation 5 Fables and Lies for its fupport 3 and a groundlefs prefumption for its fuper- ftrufture. ' For its Foundation 5 firfl: 3 abundance of Will-worfhip, mani- fefted in many outwatd performances, which are not hard to be performed, becaufe the depraved will of man, is ready preft and bent to perform things of that kind with readinefs, cheerfulneft, and delight. The works of your Father the Devil you wiUdofmh. our Saviour, of the obftinate Jews 5 do them, be they never fo hard, with content and willingnefs. Secondly,the Mahometan Religion hath abundance of ftrange Monftroos Fables and Lyes fonts fupport, thtix Alcoran ((ot the fubftance of it) being a fardle of fooliih impoflibilities, fit to be received by none but foob and mad-men 5 for they Can gain no more credit with thofe that are judicious, then what is related in the ryming ftory of that antient Knight Errant, Be- vis of Southampton^ or in the Poems of Orlando^ the furious, where may be found fome fuch like parallel fidHons,as oi^jialpho who mounted a Griffin, which carried him up immediately into the Moon, where (they Mahomet fometime wasjthereafbn f conceive which made hrmfelf, and his followers, ever (ince fo full of Lunacy or madnefs. Thirdly, it hath a groundlefs prefumption for its fuper- ftru&amp;ure, which prelumption draws that milled people into a carelefs lecurity, they efteeming themfelves the only true be lievers of the world, and none true believers but themfelves. Yet it cann9t be denied, but that there are fbme things in the precepts which. Mahomet h&amp;th. prefcribed to be received andob- Icrved by his followers, that are good ^ laid down in eight com mandments which are thele. Firft, C I hat God is a great God^ and the only God^ and Maho met is the Prophet of God. Second, That Children mnji obey their Parents^ afid do nothing to dijpleafe them either in word or deed. Third, That every one muji do to another that&gt; and only that^ which he would have another do to him. F ourth , That every man five times every day mufi repair to the Mofquit or Churchy to pray there 5 or^wherejoever he i/, he muji pray , wwy day fo ff/'ten^ if not m the Church, then elfewhere. Fifth, B ■■A Voyage to E A S T-IN D I A, &amp;c. Fifth, 'That one whole Moon in everyy ear, every man^ come to years of difcretion, muji jpend the whole day^ 'twixt the rtfing^ and Jetting of the Sun, infafting. Sixth, That every one out of his fiore, muft give unto the poor liberally, freely, and voluntarily. Seventh, That every one (except thofe Votaries which renounce marriage) muji marry, to increafe and multiply the Se&amp; and Re ligion of Mahomet. Eighth, That no man muji kill, orJhed blood. Now much in thefe Commandments agrees with the word of Truth 5 and we need not wonder at it 3 when we confider, that even the Devil himfelf (as we may oblerve in the GofpelJ hath fometimes had a Scripture in his mouth. So have Hereticks, and fo did Mahomet and his Affiftants mix fbme Scripture in their Alcoran, to put a fairer glofs upon their irreligion. But what Scriptures they all urge, are for the moft part, if not ever, wrefted, by their maiming, or perverting, or mif-applying of them. Thus the Devil quotes a Scripture, Mat. ^,6, but one part is left out, and the reft mif-applied. Thofe therefore who wreft or mangle Scripture to ferve their own turn, we may lee fromwhofe School they have it. Thus Mahomet cites Scripture to do more mifchief by it let no man content him{elf,and think all is weiLji becaufe he can lometimes fpeakgood words, have a Scripture in his mouth 5 when he confiders that Hereticks, Hy pocrites do fo, that Mahomet, nay Satan himfelf hath done as much. But to proceed 3 the Mahometan-Vxitfts are called Moolaas, who read lome parcels out of their ^/^r^»,upon Fridays (which are theirSabbaths or days of reft) unto the people affembled in their Mofquits or Churches, and then further deliver fome pre- - cepts, which they gather out of it, unto their miferably deluded hearers. Thefe are they which joyn thofe of that Religion in marriage 5 and thefe imploy much of their time as Scriveners todobulinefles for others 5 or to teach their young Children to write and read their language in written hand, for fas before) they have no Printing. Thofe Moolaas vxz mow diftinguifhed from the reft of the Mahometans by their Beards f which they wear long) then by any other of their habits. Their Calling gains, and gives them very much reverence and efteemamongft the People 5 as another fort of Priefts there have, of an high order or rank, which live much retired &gt; but when they appear openly are moft highly reverenced 5 they are called Scayds who derive themfelves trom Mahomet. The Mahometans have fair Churches which (as before) are called Mofquits 5 their Churches are built of Marble or coarfer ftone, the broad-fide towards the Weft is made up dole like a firm wall, and fo are both ends, in which there are no lights j theA Voyage /o E A S T-l N DI A, &amp;c. the other broad fide towards the Eafl: is ereded upon Pillars ( where a man may take notice of the excellent workmanftiip both in Vaults, and Arches) the fpaces betwixt them Pillars ftand open. Their Churches are built long and narrow 3 (land ing North and South which way they lay up the bodies of their dead 5 but none of them within their Churches. At the four corners of their Mofquits which ftand in great Ci- ties or in other places much peopled, there are high and round, butfmall Turrets 5 which are made open with lights everyway, wherein a man may be eafily feen, and heard 5 their devout Moo- laar five times every day^ afcend unto the tops of thofe high Turrets, whence they proclaim, as loudly as they can poffibly fpeak, their Prophet Mahomet^ thus in Arabian, La alia ilia alla y Mahomet Rejul-alla^ that is, There is no God but one God, and Mahotnet the Meflenger from God, That voice infteadof Bells (which they ufe not in their Churches) puts the moft devout in mind of the hours of their devotion, thofe Priefts being ex ceedingly zealous to promote the caufe, and to keep up the ho nour of their Mahomet, as the men of Ephejus fometime were. # when they feared that the credit of their Baggage Diana was like to be called into queftjon, they took up a Cry which conti nued for the fpace of two hours. Crying out with one voice 3 Great is Diana of the Epheftans ^AOis 19. 24. But to return again to thofe Mahometan Priefts, who out of zeal do fo often proclaim their Mahomet. Tom Coryat upon a time having heard their Moolaas often (as before) fo to cry, got him upon an high place diredly oppofite to one of thofe Priefts, and contradidted him thus: La alia ilia alia, Hafaret Eeja Ben- alia, that is. No God, but one God, and the Lord Chrift the Son of Cod, and further added that Mahomet was, zn Impoftor .* and all this he fpake in their own language as loud as poflibly he could, in the ears of many Mahometans that heard it. But whether (circumftances confidered) the zeal, or difcretion of our Pilgrim were more here to be commended, I leave to the judgment of my Reader. That he did To, I amfure, and Ifiir- iher believe how that bojd attempt of his, if it had been aded in many other places of 4jia, would have coft him his life with as much torture as cruelty could been invented. But he was here taken for a mad-man, and fo let alone. Haply the rather, becaufe every one there hath Jiberty to profefs his own Religion freely, and, if he pleafe, may argue againft theirs, without fear of an inquifition, as Tom Coryat tiid at another time with a Moolaa, and th^ Queftion was. Which of thefe two was the Mufsleman or true Believer : after much heat on both fides, Tom Coryat thus diftinguHhed, that himfelf was the Orthodox Mufslemam or true true-believer, the Moolaa the pfeudo Mvfsleman or falfe true believer ^ which diftindion, if I had not thought it would have made my Reader fmile had been here omitted. TheA Voyage to EAST-INDIA, &amp;c. The Mahometans have a fet form of prayer in the Arabian Tongue 3 not underftood by many of the common people, yet repeated by them as well as by the Moolaas : they likewife re~ hearle the Names of God and of their Mahomet certain times every day upon Beads:, like the mils-led Papifts, who feem to regard more the Number, then the weight of prayers. But for the carriage of that people in their devotions, before they go into their Churches they wafti their feet, and entring into them put off their fhooes. As they begin their devotions they ftop their ears, and fix their eyes, that nothing may divert their thoughts^ then in a foft and ftill voice they utter their prayers, wherein are many words moft fignificantly expreffing the Omnipotency, and Greatnefs, and Eternity, and other At tributes of God. Many words likewife that feem to exprefs much humiliation, they confeffing in divers ftibmiffive geftures, their own unworthinefs, when they pray carting themfelves low upon their Facefimdry times, and then acknowledg that they are burdens to the Earth, and poyfbn to the Air, and the like, being fo confounded and aftiam'd as that they feem not to dare fo much as to lift up their eyes towards Heaven 5 but after all tliis 3 comfort themfelves in the mercies of God, through the mediation of Mahomet. If this people could as well ccbelud^, as? they can begin and continue their prayers, in refped of their expreffions, and car riages in them, they might find comfort j but the conclufion of their devotions marrs all. Yet this, for their commendation ( who doubtlefs, if they knew better would pray better) that what diverfions, and im pediments foever they have arifing either from pleafure or pro fit, the Mahometans pray five times a day. The Mogol doth fo, who fits on tlje Throne 5 the Shepherd doth fo that waits on his flock in the field (where, by the way, they do not follow their flocks 5 but their flocks, them ) all forts of Mahometans do thus whether fixed in a place or moving in a journey, when their timesy or hours of prayer come,* which in the morning are at Six, Nine, and T welve of the clock 5 and at three ^nd fix ill the afternoon. When they pray^t is their manner to fet their Faces that they may look towards Medina neer Mecha in Arabia where their great Seducer Mahomet was buried, who promifed them after onethouland years, to fetch them all to Heaven 5 which terra, when it was out, and the promife not fulfilled, the Mahome tans concluded that their Fore-fathers mif-took the time of the promife of his coming ^ and therefore refolve to wait for the accomplilhment of it one thoufand years more. In the mean time they do fo reverence that place where the body of Maho met was laid up, that whofoever hath been there (as there are divers which flock yearly thither in Pilgrimage) are for ever af ter called, and efteemed Hoggees, which fignifies Holy men. And \A Voyage to JL AS T-IN DI A, d^» 'Tndherethe thing being rightly and ferioufly confidered^ it is a very great (hame that a Mahometan (hould pray five times - every day, that Pagans and Heathens (hould be very frequent in their devotions, and Chriftians (who only can hope for good anfwers in prayer) fo negligent in that great prevailing duty. For a Mahometan to pray five times every day^ what diverfions foever he hath to hinder him, and for a Chriftianto let any thing interrupt his devotion 5 for a Mahometan to pray five times a day,, and for one that is called a Chriftian not to pray (fome be lieving themfelves above this and other Ordinances) five times in a week, a moneth, a year ! - But this will admit left caule of wonder if we connder how that many bearing the Names of Chriftians cannot pray at all, thofe I mean which are prophane and filthy, and who live as if there were no God to hear, or to judg, and no Hell to punifh. Such as thefe can but babble, they cannot pray, for they blas pheme the Name of God, while they may think they adore it. I (ball add here a (hort ftory , It happened that I once having fome difcourfe with a Mahometan of good quality, and fpeak- ing with him about his frequent praying, I told him that if him- fclf, and others of his profeflion who did believe it as a duty to pray fb often, could conclude their Petitions in the Name of fefus Chrift, they might find much comfort in thofe their fre quent performances, in that great duty : He anfwered, that I needed not to trouble ray felfwith that, for they found as great comfort as they could defire in what they did. And prefently he would needs infer this Relation. , 1 1 • There was ((aid he) a moft devout Mufsleman who Lad In^ habitation in a great City where Mahomet was zealoufly pro- fefied, that man for many years together fpent his whole ^ a y^ n the Alofquit) or Church, in the mean time, he minding not the world at all, became fo poor, that he had nothing left to buy bread for his family 5 yet,notwithftanding his poor condition,he was refolved ftill to ply his devotions: and in a moi ning hen he perceived that there was nothing at all left for the further (ubfiftence of himfelf and houfhold) took a folemn leave wife and children, refolving for his part to go and pra) and dye in the Mofquit, leaving his family (it no relief came) to familh at home. But that very day he put on this refolution, theie came to his houfe in his ablence a very beautiful young man (as he appeared to be) who brought and gave unto his wife a very good quantity of Gold bound up in a white Napkin, telling her, that God had nowremembred her husband, and lent him his pay for his conftant pains taken in his devotion 5 wi^all charging her not to fend for her husband, for though h&gt;, had taken fuch a folemn leave of her that morning, yet he would come home to her again that night 5 and fo he depai ted trom her..

Her husband prefently replied that it was the Angel Gabriel fent from God (for the Mahometans fpeak much of that AngeF) and he further added, that himfelf had nothing to bring home Unto her but a little grett, or fand, which he took up in his'Way. feomeward, and bound it in his girdle, which he prefently open ing to (hew her, it was all turn d into precious ftohe's, whidlt amounted unto a very great value in money.

Unto which conclufion we may all flibfcribe, leaving the premifes { which are laid down in that ftory, unto thofe that dare be lieve thenu - ^ &gt; c The Mahometans fay, that they have the Books of Mofes, but they have very much corrupted that ftory, in afcribing that to Jjhmael which is faid of ifaac^ Gen. 22. as I font ael fhould havC been facrificed, not ifaac^^ot which more afterward).

But I'll return again to that people 3 that I may acquaint my Reader with one thing of fpecial obfervation ^ and 'tis this: That there is not one among the Mahometans (of any under- ftanding) which at any time mentions the name of our bleiled Saviour called there Hazaret Eefa^the Lord Chrift^but he makes mention of it with high reverence and refped. For they fay of Chrift that he was a good man., and a jufl^ that he lived witkm fin, that he did greater miracles then ever any before or iince him^nay further they,call him Rha-how-Alla^he breath of God but how he ftiouldbe the Son of Cod 3 they cannot conceive' and therefore cannot believe. Perhaps the Socinians firft took that their opinion from thefe which bids them to have every thing they receive as truth, to be cleared up unto them by the ftrength of Reafon, as if there were no need of the exercife of Faith. And truly (1 muft needs confels) that to believe the Incar nation of the Son of Godj is one of the hardeft and greateft tasks for Faith to encounter withall, that God ftiould be made a Man, that this Man Chriftfhould be born of a Virgin, that Lifefliould fpring from Death 5 and that from Contempt and Scorn 3 Triumph 5 andVictory (hould come^f.ButChriftians muft bind up all their thoughts, as to thefe 3 in that excellent medi tation of Picus MiranduU , faying, Mir an dam Dei Incarnate nem , 8cc. concerning that admirable, and wonderful Incar nation of Chrift the Son of God, I (hall not fay much ^ it be ing fiifficient for me, as for all others that look for benefit by Chrift, to believe, that he was begotten, and that he was born. Thefe are Articles of our Faith 5 and we arenotChri- ftians,if we believe them not. I may feem very frrange therefore, that the Mahometans ('who underftand themfelves better) fhould have fuch a very high efteem of our Bletfed Saviour Chrift, and yet think us who profefsour felvesChriftians to be fo unworthy, or fo un clean, as that they will not eat with us, any thing that is of our dreiling, nor yet of any thing that isdreffed in our veilels. There are more particulars which challenge a room in this Seftion as their proper place: but becaufe I would not have it fwell too big, I (hall here part it, and fpeak furthet ACTIONCOBctip^ XTIOS Of their Votaries j rvhere^ of the voluntary andJharp Pe* n tnces, that people undergo.

Thofe very (harp and very ftrid'Penances which many of this people for the preftnt volun tarily undergo, far exceed all thofe the Romanifts boaft of5 for inftance^ there are fbme who live alone upon the tops of Hills (which are clothed or covered with trees, and ftand remote from any Company) and there fpqnd the whole time of their following lives in Contemplation, ftirring not at all from the places they firft fix on, but ad requifita naturae crying out con tinually in thefe or the like expreffions, Alia Achabar, fkc. that is, God Almighty look upon me, I love thee, I love not the world 5 but I love thee, and I do all this for thy fake 5 look up on me, God Almighty.

Avery great difference'twixt that people and ours 5 for there they call mad-men Prophets, and amongfl: us there are many Prophets which are accounted but mad-men. There are another fort among them called Mendee, carried on like wife meerly by mifs-takes and mif-conceivings in Religi on 5 who like the Fr/ei?/ of Baal&gt; mentioned 1 King. 18. often cut their pefh with knives and launcers.

And all that time, thofe that are ftrid an their Religion, forbear their Women, and will not take either Meat or Drink any day during that time, fo long as the Sun is above their Horizon, but after the Sun is {et they eat at pleafure. The laft day of their Ram- jan, they confecratc as a day of mourning to the memory of their deceafed friends, when I have obferved many of the mean- ner fort, feem to make moft bitter lamentation.

For their works of charity 3 there are fome rich men that build Sarraes in great Cities and T owns (fpoken of before) where pafiengers may find houle-room and that freely, with out a return of any recompence^ wherein themfelves and goods may be in (afety. Others make Wells and Tanks for the publick benefit^ Or maintain fervants, which continually attend upon road-ways that are much travelled, and there offer unto Pafiengers water for themlelves and beafts, which water they bring thither in great skins hanging upon the back of their Buttelos ^ which as it is freely given, fb it muft be freely taken by all thofe, who deiire to refrefh themfelves by it. There are fome which build rich Monuments to preferve the memories of thofe whom they have efteemed eminent for their aufterity and holinefs; thefe they call Tares or Saints^ amongft whom fome of thofe ( before-mentioned ) help to fill their Number, who fequefter themfelves from the world (as they think) and fpend their life alone upon the tops of Hills, or in other obfcure corners. 429 SECTION XVII. Of the Marriages of the Mahometans, and of their P0* lygamy. See. A Mongft many other things that confirm the Mahometans in j\ their irreligion, this certainly is not the leaft^ the indul gence which gives them to take more wives than one (Tor they make take four if they pleafe) and that further pro- mifo which that monllrous Seducerhathmzde unto his follow ers of a flefhly Paradife hereafter, wherein he will provide for them all wives which (hall have large rowling eyes, which they look upon in that fox as a great beauty. And it is a very futable comfort for fuch as walk lo much after the fiefh. For Polygamy, or the having of more wives than one, Lamech a great Grand-child of^i»,was the firft that brought it into the World, Gen 4.19. And it was firft brought into the Church by Abraham ; which adt of his, as of others after him (good men in their generation) though it found permiffion, never had ap probation from Almighty God. And further, though under the times of the Lawjit tound fome connivence, yetfincethe p 0 *?' there hath been no juch cuftom in any of the Chttrches of Chri* . 1 remember:: : •1i: l,r ii I remember that my Lord Ambaffadour had a Servant of that Nation, who defired leave to be abfent one day 3 and being aiked why, he told usj that he was then to marry a Wife 3 though he had three living then, a Man would think enough for his means but five (hillings a Moon 3 the ufual pay of Ser vants there (as before I obferved) to maintain himfelf, and all the reft of his family. Often have 1 heard this Queftionput, How thefe Mahome tans can do with fo many Wives 5 fome of which they keep pent up in little Cottages, or Tents? And in other places and parts oi the World, where mens dwellings are very large and Ipacious, there is fcarce room enough to be found for one Wife in a great Houfe. . • The Mahometans, who have moft Wives, and Women, are mod: jealous ^ and their jealoufie fuch, as that they will not fuf- fer the Brothers, or Fathers of their Wives, to come to them, or to have any fpeech with them, except it be in their prefence. And a continued cuftom by this reftraint hath made it odious for fuch Women,as have the reputation ofhonef^tobe feenat any time by any Man, befides their own Hufbands, or by thole be fore named, and by them but very feldom. But if they diflionour their Hufbands beds, or being unmarryed are found incontinent and filthy, profeffing Chaftity 5 rather than they (hall want the levereft punidiment, their own Brothers hands will befirfta- gainft them to take away their lives, and for (b doing, (hall be commended, but not queftioned, fhe Women there ofthe greater quality,have Eunuchs inftead of men to wait upon them, who in their minority are deprived of all that might provoke jealoufie. Here is a free toleration for Harlots, who are lifted and en rolled (as they fay J before they can have liberty to keep fuch an open houfe.

For inftance, all Bramins (which are their Priefts, the Sons of all which are Priefts, likewife) are married to Bra/uins daughters ^ fo a Mer chants Ton marries a Merchants daughter, and fo men of feveral Trades marry to the fame Trade. Thus a Coolee (who is a Tiller of the Ground) marries his fon to a Coolees daughter ^ and foin all other profeffions they keep themfelves to their own Tribes and Trades, not mixing with any other, by which means they never advance themfelves higher than they were at firfh They take but one wife, and of her they are not fo fearful and jealous as the Mahometans are of their feveral wives and women, for they fuffer their wives to go abroad whither they pleafe. They are married very young, about fix , or (even years bid, their Parents making Matches for them, who lay hold of every opportunity tobeftow their Ghildren. Becaufe confin'd to their own Trilx^ they have not fuch variety , of choice as otherwife they might have; and when they attain to the age of thirteen, or fourteen, or fifteen years at the moft, they bed together. Their Marriages are fblemnized (as thofe of the Mahometans) with much company, and noife &gt; but with this difference, that both the young couple ride openly on horie-back, and for the mofl part, they are fo little, that fome go on their horfe lides to hold them up from falling. They are bedeck d, or ftrewed all over their cloathing, with the choice flowers of that Country, faftned in order all about their Garments. &gt; q ^ a For their Habits they differ very little from the Mahome^as, but are very like them civilly clad, but many of their women were Rings on their Toes ^ and therefore go bare foqt.

But ( as I conceive) the moft principal caufe why they thus forbear to take the lives of inferiour Creatures, proceeds from their obedience unto a precept given them by one ol: their principal,, and moft highly efteemed Prophets and Law-givers they call Bremaw , others they have in very high efteem, aqd ( the name of one of them is Kam^ of another V ermijjar f I am ignorant of the names of others, and I conceive that my Reader wilf^ot much care to know them.

A LI Errour in the World proceeds either from Ignorance ( commonly joyned with Pride ) or elfe from Wilfulnefs. This is moft true as in natural, and moral, fo in fpiritual things; For as Knowledge (bftens and fweetens Men's manners, fo it enricheth their Minds 5 which Knowledge is certainly a moft divine, a very excellent thing, otherwile our firft Parents would never have been fo ambitious of it.'' This makes a Man here to live twice, or to injoy here a double Life in refpedfc of him that wants it. But for this Knowledge, it'certainly muft be efteemed better, or worfe a by how much the objeft of this Knowledge is worfc, or better. Now the beft objed of this Knowledge is a right Underftanding, and Knowledge of the true God, which that people wants. Now touching this people, they are altogether ignorant of God,A Voyage ft? E A S T-IN D I-A, &amp;c. Mu, God, as they ought to know him 5 and they have no learning amongft them, but as much as enables them to write and to read what they have written, and they having no infight into the reafons and caufes of things (I meaij the ruder fort, both of the Mahometans and Gentiles) when they obferve things which are not very ordinary, as when they fee any Eclipfes, but elpeci- allyof the Moon (haply fome of them facrificing to her, and calling her the Queen of Heaven, as thofe Idolaters did, jfer. 44.18.) they make a very great ftir and noile, bemoaning her much, which helps (as they conceive) to free, and bring her out of it. Juvenal obferving that cuftom ('which appears to be very ancient among the Heathens) reproves a very braw ling clamorous Woman in his fixthSatyre thus, Vna* labormti potefit faecurrere Luna^ that (he made noife enough to deliver the Moon out of an Eclipfe. Their ignorance in this, as in many-many other things, is much to be pitied : as the knowledg and learning of many others, which (^by their not improving of it) is to them as the Letters which fometimes carried againft himfelf 5 it con- dcftiHs the bearer. ' But though the Hindoos, or Heathens there, have no learn ing 5 yet they want not opinions: for their divided hearts are there dlftraded into foiir-fcore, and four feveral Seds, each dif fering from others, very much in opinion about their irreligion 5 which might fill a man, even full of wonder, that doth not con-^ iider, how that Satan, who is the author divifion, is the feducer of them all* Thofe many Seds (as I conceive among them ) confift of people there of feveral Trades, Occupations, and Conditions of Life ^ which feveral forts of people (as before I obferved) fiiftfry into their own Tribes 5 and fo unite and keep together amongft themfelves, that they have not much correfpondency with any other people. Thefe without doubt have (everal ways of worfhip within themfelves, which makes them fo leparate from others, as that they will not eat with any, but thofe of their own Tribes. The illiterate Priefts of all that people for the generality of them are called Brdmins^ who derive themfelves from whom (they lay) was one of the firft men that inhabited the World \ and, after the fin of that firft World brought the Flood, the race of that Bramon (whofe very name they highly reverence) was continued in Brewaw, who (as they fay) o 1111 '' lived that deluge, and is honoured by them likewile as one 01 their great Prophets and Law-givers. Thofe Bramins (as I conceive) are they, which the ancient (lories call Brachmans , but with this difference, that thole Brachmans 11 God, &gt;A Voyage fo E AST-INDI A, &amp;c. Brachwanes were accounted learned men 5 for the learning of thofe times wherein they lived: But thefe are a very filly, fottifh, and an ignorant fort of people, who are fo incon- ftant in their Principles, as that they fcarce know what the par ticulars are which they hold and maintain as truths. As anciently amongft the Jews, their Prieft-hood is heredi tary , for all thofe Bramins Sons are Priefts, and they all take the Daughters of Bramins to be their Wives. (Of which fomthing before.) They have little Churches they call Vagods, ftanding near, or under their green Trees, built rounds but as their ancient Brachmans were faid not to endure, thefe, on the contrary, have Images in their Pagods made in monftrous fhapes, but for what end they have them, 1 know not. N0W3 from the manner of thofe Heathen®, which I believe hath been for many-many years retained in their Idolatrous worfhips 5 1 conceive that the Jews long ago borrowed that un warrantable cuflom of worfhipping God in Groves, or under green Trees. Both men and women before they go to their devotions (which are very frequently performed) wafh their bodies, and keep off all their cloaths, but the covering of modefty, till they have done, led hereunto by a Precept (as they fay) comman ded them to be perform'd by their Law-giver which requires them daily to obferve their times of devotion exprefled by their wafhings,and worlhippings, and prayer to God 5 which muft be all done with purity of hearts. And it is the manner of this people before they take their food to walh their bodies, then (which I much obferved while we lived in Tents) they make a little Circle upon the ground, which they feem to confecrate \ after which they fit down with in that compafs, and eat what they have provided 5 and if any come within that Circle before they have ended their meal, they prefently quit the place, and leave their food behind them. That outward wafhing (as this people think) avails very much to their cleanfingfrom fin, not unlike the Pharifees, who were all for the out-fide of Religion , and would not eat withun- wafhen hands, Mark. 7.2. unlefs they wafhed themfelvesup to the Elbows(as TheophyUft oblerves^hence thofe Hindoos alcribe a certain divinity unto Rivers, but above all to that famous Ri* ver Ganges, whither they flock daily in troops, that there they may wa(h themfdves 5 and the nearer they can come to the head of that River, the more virtue they believe is in the water. After they have thus walhed, they throw pieces of Gold, or Silver (according to their devotion and ability) into that River^ and fo depart from it. Thus Reader thou haft fomewhat of the carriages of this people in life.

Styx, or Acheron, and there take new bodies. Others of them think that ere long the World will have an end, after which they (hall live here again on a new earth. Some other wild conceivings of this people follow afterward. Some Bramins have told me that they acknowledge one God 3 whom they defcribe with a thoufand eyes 3 with a thoiifand hands, and as many feetjthat thereby they may exprefs his power^as be ing all eye to fee, and all foot to follow^ and all hand to fmite of fenders. The confideration whereof makes that people very ex^ ad: in the performances of all moral duties^ following dofe to the light of Nature in their dealings with men, moft carefully obferving that Royal LaWj in doing nothing to others, but what they would be well contented to fuffer from others, Thofe Bramins talk of two books, which not long after the Creation, when the World began to be peopled, (they fay) were delivered by Almighty God to Br anion (before fpoken ot) : one of which Books (they fay) containing very high, and fecret, and myfterious things was fealed up, and might not be opened ^ the other to be read, but only by the Bramins, or Priefts. And this Book, thus to be read, came after (as they further fay) into the hands of Bremarv (of whom likewife fomthing before) and by him it was communicated unto ita^and Vermijj'ar, two other fam'd Prophets amongft them, which thofe Heathens dolike^ wile exceedingly magnifie ^ as they do fbme. others, whofe names I have not. Now that Book which they call the shefier, or the Book of their written word, hath been tranfcribed in all ages ever fince by the Bramins, out of which they deliver Pre cepts unto the people. They fay that there are feven Orbs, above which is the feat of God 5 and that God knows not fmall and petty things, or, if he do, regards them not. They further believe that there are Devils, but fo fettered and bound in chains, as that they cannot hurt them. I obferved before the tendernefs and fcruple, which is in very many of that people in taking the lives of any inferioui , and meerly fenfible, yea and of hurtful creatures too. And thofe which are moft tender -hearted in this cale are called Banians, who are by far more numerous than any other of thofe Indian Seds^ and thefe hold P^%^/his Metempjychofts, as a prime Article of their Faith. W hich that untaught people come up very near unto, thinking that all the fouls, both of men and wo men after they leave their bodies make their repole in « tiie r Creatures, and thofe Souls (as they imagine) are belt lodged that go into Kine, which (in their opinion) are the belt ot ail fenfible creatures ^ and therefore ^as before) they ^ large funis of money unto the Mogol to redeem them tiom flaughter. And this people further conceit, that ^SQubot the wicked go into vile Creatures, as the Sous o 441 , 1 «i!44 2 d Voyage ^ E A S T-I N D I A, fac. and Drunkards into Swine. So the Souls of the Voluptuous and incontinent into Monkies and Apes. Thus the Souls of the Furious.,Revengeful 3 Cruel People^ into Lions^ Wolves;, Tygres^ other beafts of prey. So the Souls of the Envious into Serpents^ and fointo other Creatures according to peoples qualities and difpofitions, while 'they lived fucceffively from one to another of the fame kind, ad infinitum for ever and ever 3 by confe- quence they believing the immortality of the World. And upon that fame mad and groundlefs phanfie, probably they fur ther believe, that the Souls of Froward, Peevifti, and Teachy Women go into Wafps $ and that there is never a filly Fly, but (if they may be credited) carries about it fome Souls (haply they think of light Women) and will not be perfwaded out of their wild conceivings, fo incorrigible are their fottifti errours. The day of reft which thofe Hindoos obferveas a Sabbath isThurfday, as the Mahometans Friday. Many Feftivals they have which they keep folemnly, and Pilgrimages., the moft fa mous briefly fpoken of before in thofe (hort defcriptions of Na* graiot) and Syba, obferved in my firft Section. Now there are a race of other Heathens (I named before) living amongft thofe Hindoos^ which in many things differ very much from them : they are called Perfees, who (^asthey fay) originally came out of about that time and his followers gave Laws to the PerfianSj and impofed a new Religi on on them 5 which thefePerfees not enduring left their Coun* try, and came and fetled themfelves in EaJi^India^ in the Pro vince of Guzarat, where the moft part of them ftill continue (though there are fome of them likewife in other parts of India) but where-ever they live they confine themfelves ftriftly to their own Tribe, or Sed. F or their Habits, they are clad like the other people of that Empire 5 but they fhave not their hair clofe as the other do 5 but fuffer their beards to grow long. . f heir profeffion is for the generality all kinds of Husbandry, imploying themfclves very much in Sowing and Setting of Hei bs 5 in Planting and Dreffing of Vines, and Palmeeto^ or Toddy-Trees, as in Planting and Husbanding all other Trees bearing fruit ^ and indeed they are a very induftrious people, and fo are very many of the Hindoos (as before I obferved) and they do all very well in doing fo, and in this a due, and deferved commendation belongs unto them. For, 1 here is no condition whatfoever can priviledge a folded ai m. Our ftrft Parents before their fall were put into the Gar den of Eden to drefs it. Certainly, if idlenefs had been better than labour, they had never been commanded to do work, but they mufl labour in their eftate of innocency, becaufe they were happy, and much more we in our finful loft eftate that we may befo.

That body therefore well deferves to pine and ftarve without pity 5 when two able Hands cannot feed one Mouth. mouui. But further, for thofe Perfees 5 they ufe their liberty in meats and drinks., to take of them what they pleafe 5 but becaufe they would not give offence, either to the Mahometans, or Ba nians, or other Hindoos amongft whom they livej, they abftain from eating Beef, or Swines flefh. It is their ufual manner to eat alone, as for every one of them to drink in his own Cup 5 and this is a means (as they think) to keep themfelves more pure, for if they (hould eat with others, they are afraid that they might participate of fome uncleannefs by them, Alas poor Creatures, that do not at all underlrand them- felves, and their moft miferable condition: for to them that ar$ defiled, and unbelieving is nothing pure. Yet I obferved before, the Mahometans and Gentiles there are very ftrid: in this particular 5 fo that they will not eat with any mixt company, and many of the Gentiles not eat withone another. And this hath been an ancient cuftom among Hea- thens. It isfaid, Gen. 43. 32. that the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that was an abomination to the ^For thofe Perfees ^ further they believe that there is but one God, who made all things, and hath a Soveraign power over all.

As, many of the Hindoos afcribe to much unto water (as be fore) fo thefe to fire: and the reafon of it, is this, becaufe they have had this tradition from many ages and generations P 5 that their great Law-giver, whom they ca r ^ Wa ® up into Heaven, and there had fire delivered unto him, vyhi he brought down thence; and he ever after commandcdlus fol lowers to worlhip it and fo they do , and turther^thcy loveanj thing that refembles fire, as the Sun and Moon ' an J^ refor J when they pray in the day time they look towards Sun, an fo towards the Moon in their n .ght -devotions, ^from^ato over -high cfteem they have of fire, they keep fire . s contmuauy bumins' in their Egearees, or Temples in Lamps icd with ) , which are always attended by their PnL r fts 1''tSmcm from many of thefe which have burned without extmgmlhment trem -SStf&amp;SZtS* of ***&amp; 3 j L U 2^444 ^ Voyage ^ E A S T-I N DI A, their Xertooji did fetch fire from Heaven is as certainTytruTTq that ancient Fidion and Fable of Trometheus, that he did f&gt;pal fire thence. &gt;, ai But to proceed: their Priefts they call Daroos, orHarboods above both which,, they have a Chief, or High-Prieft, thev call the Dejioor,^ who not often appears openly, but, when he doth he meets with much Reverence and Refpeft given unto him by the common people, and fo do thofe other Church-men which are his mfenours : unto all which they allow free maintenance tor their more comfortable fubfiftance.

He is lineally defcended from that moft famous Conquerour, called in our Stories Tantberlain, concerning whofe Birth and original Hiftories much differ, and therefore I cannot de termine it 5 but, in this, all that write of him agree, that he ha- ving got together very many huge multitudes of Men, made very great Conquefts in the South-Eaft parts of the World, not onely on Bajazet the Emperour of the Turks , but alfo in Eaft-India A and elfe-where 5 for.

Tell thy Majfter, laid the Mogol, that he is my Slave, for my Anceftor conquered him. The Mogol feeds and feafts himfelf with this conceit, that he is Conquerour of the World, and therefore (I conceive) that he was troubled upon a time, when my Lord Ambaflador, having bu- finefs with him f and upon thofe terms, there is no coming unto that King empty-handed without fbmePrefent, or other ^ of which more afterward), and having at that time nothing left, which he thought fit to give him, prefented him with Mercators great Book of Cofmography, f which the Ambaflador had brought thither for his own ufe) telling the Mogol, that that Book d^fenbed the four parts of the World, and all feve- ral Countries in them contained.

As it was faid of the Lands of Alcibiades^ that, compared with the Globe of the whole Earth, they did not appear bigger then a fmall tittle. The Territories are more apparent, large, and viable, as one may take notice, who ftridtly views this affixed Map, which is ^ true reprefenta- tion of that great Empire in its large dimenfions. So that al though the Mogol be not Mafter of the whole World, yet hath he a great (hare in it, if weconfider his very large Territories, and his abundant riches, as will after more appear, whofe wealth and ftrength makes him fo potentj as that he is able, wnenfoever he pleafeth to make inroades upon,and to do much mifchief unto any of his Neighbours 5 but I leave that, and come now to fpeak SECTION XXIII. f , , ^ ' ... .

There are no Laws for Government kept in that Empire upon record (for ought I could ever learn) to regulate Governours there in the adminiftration of Juftice, but what are written in thebreaft of that Ring and his Subftitutes* and therefore they often take liberty to proceed how they pleafe, in punifhing the Offender rather than the offence 5 mens perfons more than their Crimes 5 dgrotutit potius qutm m or hum.

Now the^iay that one great reafon, why they put men there unto fiich exqCiifite torments, is, becaufe they hold it a thing of the greateft difhonour there for any man to die by the hand of an Executioner : therefore they are ufually commanded^ when they are fentenced to die, to rip up, or cut open their own bellies, and thofe who will not fo do are tormented in dying. Hence moft of that people,when as they have received that hard command to prevent death , by dying j call for their friends about them, eat, and feem to be merry with them, and then in the clofe of the meal, and in their prcfence, commit this fad flaughter upon themfelves, as firft thofe poor wretches make themielves naked to the middle, he, or they who are to die ^ then the moft wretched felf-murderer, who is to ad that bloody part, ftrikes a (harp Knife into the bottom ot his belly, then rips himfelf up, and after gives himielfone other cut crofs his belly, and when he hath done both thefe, if after he can but wipe his bloody knife upon a white paper, or napkin that is laid by him, he is believed to part with his life with a very great deal of honour, and immediatly (as he is made to believe) goes to FaJ {amafJ i whom they fay is the God of war.

When I was in India jhere was one fentenced by the Mogol himfelfj for killing his own father, to dye thus 5 firft he commanded that this Parricide fhould be bound alive by his heels faftned to a fmall iron chain 3 which was tied to the hind-leg ^ of a great Elephant} and then that this Elephant ftould drag ^ him after him one whole remove of that King, from one place 1 1 to another, which was about ten miles diftant, that fo all his fiefti ^ 1 might be worn off his bones, and fo it was, when we fa w him in every the way following that King in hisProgrefs 5 for he appeared pUce then to us a Skeleton, rather than a body. cut no There was another condemned to dye by the Mogol himfelf asiftl fwhiie we were ztAmzdavar) for killing hisown Mother ^ and anyco at this the King was much troubled to think of a death, fuita- tW ble for fo horrid a crime 3 but, upon a little paufc, he ad- theirk judged him to be ftung to death by Snakes, which was accord- Whc ingly done. I told you before that there are fome Mountebanks Goven there, which keep great Snakes to (hew tricks with them &gt; one as if hi of thofe fellows was prefently called for to bring his Snakes to gence do that execution, who came to the place where that wretched inferb Creature vyas appointed to dye, and found him there all naked thatbr (except a little covering before) and trembling. Then fudden- from 1 ly the Mountebank (having firft angred and provoked the vene- from t mous creatures,) put one of them to his Thigh, which prefently binds I twin d it lejf about that part, till it came near his Groin, and meetin there bit him till blood followed, the other was faftned to the theirc cut-fide of his other Thigh, twining about it (for thofe Snakes Tk thus kept, are long and flender) and there bit him likewife 5 not- appok w it Itanding, the wretch kept upon his feet near a quarter of matters an hour, before which time the Snakes were taken from him ; ot he r c fefcom^med exceedingly of a fire that with much tor- Qfai, ment had poflefled all his Limbs, and his whole body began to nv fub fwell exceedingly, like NafuJw, bit by a Lybian Serpent, called a „d tu a Prejier : Now much after this manner did the flinging of thofe Crimin Snakes work upon that wretch ; and about half an hour after p rdent ey were taken from him, the foul of that unnatural monfter a left his groaning Carkafs, and fo went to its place.

When the Mogol by Letters (ends-his Commands to any of his Governours, thofe Papecs areentertain'd with as much re/ped: as if himfelf were prefent 5 for thi Governour having intelli gence that liich Letters are come near him, himfelf with other inferiour Officers ride forth to meet the or Meffenger that brings them 5 and as foon as^he fees thofe Letters he alights from his horfe, falls, down on the eafrth, and then takes them from the Meflenger and lays thefti on his head, whereon he binds them faft, and then returning to his plade of publick meeting, for difpatch of bufinefles, he readd them, and anfwers their contents with all ^are and diligence. - ^ The Ring oft times in his own perfon, and fo his Subftitutes appointed Governours for Provinces and Cities, Judge in all matters Criminal that concern Life and Death. There are other Officers to aflift them, which are called Cut-walls (whole Office is like that of our Sheriffs in England) andthefe have ma ny fubftitutes under them, whofe bufinefs it is to apprehend, and to bring before thefe Judges fuch as are to be tried for things Criminal, or Capital, where the offender (as before) knows prefently what will become of him. And thofe Officers wait likewifeon other Judges there, which are called Cadees, who only meddle with Contracts and Debts and other bufinefTes of this nature 'twixt man and man. Now thefe Officers arreft Debtors, and bring them before thofe Judges, and their Sureties too, bound as with us in Contrads, confirmed fas before,) under their hands andfeals, and if they give not content unto thofe which complain of them, they will impriibn their perfbns, where they fhall find and feel the weight of fetters ^ nay, many times they will fell their Perfons, their Wives and Children in to bondage, when they cannot fatisfie their debts 3 And the cu- ftomof that Country bears with fuch hard and pitilefs courfes, fuch as was complain'd of by the poor Widow unto tne Py®' phet Elifia j who when her husband was dead, and (he not able to pay, the Creditor came and took ber txoofons to be bond -men, 2 Rings 4.1. 1 • . ikQA Voyage E A S T-IN DI A, TheMogol looked to be prefentedwith feme thing, or other, when my Lord Embaffadour came to him, and if he faw him often empty handed, he was not welcome 5 and therefore the Eaft-India Company were wont every year to fend many parti cular things unto him 5 in the name of the King of England that were given him at feveral times, efpecially then when the Embafladour had any requ^ft unto him, which made a very fair way unto it. Amongft many other things, when my Lord Embafladour firft went thither, the Company fent the Mogol an Englifti Coach, and Harnefs for four Horfes, and an able Coach-man, to fute and manage fome of his excellent Horfes, that they might be made fit for that fervice. The Coach they lent was lined within with CrimfonCto^ Velvet, which when the Mo' ol took notice of, he told the Embafladour that he wondred the King of England would trouble himfelf fo much, as to fend un to 4 for Velvet to line a Coach for him, in regard that he had been informed, that the EngliQi King had much better Velvet nearer home, for fuch, or any other ufcs. And immediately after-, the Mogol caufed that Coach to be taken all to pieces i and to have another made by it, for (as before) they are a people that will make any new thing by a pattern^ and when his new Coach was made according to the pattern, his work-men firft putting the Englifh Coach together, did fo with that they had new made 5 then pulling out all the China Velvet which was in the Englifti Coach, there was in the room thereof put a very rich Stuff, theground Silver , wrought^ all over in fpaces with variety of flowers of fiik, excellently well fuited for their colours, and cut fhort likeaPIufh, and in ftead of the brafs-nails that were firft in it, there were nails of filver put in their places. And the Coach' wluch his own Work-men made was lined and feated likewife with a richer ftuff than the former ,the ground of it gold,mingled like the other with filk flowers, and the nails filver and double gut 5 and after having Horfe^ and Harnefs fitted for both his Coaches, He rode fometimes in them, and contraded with the Englifh-coach-man to ferve him, whom he made very fine, by rich vefts he gave him, allowing hijn a very great Penfion 5 be- iides, he never carried him in any of thofe Coaches, but he gave him the reward of ten pounds at theleaft, which had raifed the Coach-man unto a very great Eftate, had not death prevented It:&gt; t ^ at immediately after he was fetled in that great fervice. The Eaji-India Company fent other Prefents for that King, ^ xc ellcnt Pi&amp;ures which pleafed the Mogol very much, efpe- cially if there were fair and beautiful Women portrayed in them. They fent likewife Swords, Rapiers, excellently well hatcht, and pieces of rich Imbroidery to make fweet bags, and rich Gloves^ and handfome Looking-glafles, and other things to give away, that they might have always fome things in readi-Hour A Voyage to E AS T-IN D I A, &amp;€. 455 nefs to prefent both to the King, and nlfo to his Govcrnours 3 where our Faftories were fetled :for all thefe were like thofe Rulers of Ifrael mentioned, Hojea 4. 18. who would love to fay with jhame. give ye. They looked to be prefented withfome- thing, when our Fadors had any efpecial occafion to repair un to them;) and if the particular thing they then prefented did not like them well^ they would defire to have it exchanged for fomething elfe 5 haply they having never heard of our good and modeft proverb, That a man muft not look^ into the mouth of a given Horfe. And it is a very poor thing indeed which is freely given, and is not worth the taking. The Mogol fometimes by his Firmauns^ or Letters Patents, will grant fome particular things unto fingle, or divers perfbns, and prefently after will contradid thofe Grants by other Let ters, excufing himfelf thus. That he is a great, and an abfblute King^ and therefore muft not be tied unto any thing, which if he were, he (aid that he was a 11ave, and not a free-man : Yet what he promifed was ufually enjoyed, although he would not be tied to a certain performance of his promife. Therefore there can be no dealing with this King upon very fure terms, who will fay and unfay, promile and deny. Yet we Englifh- men did not at all fuffer by that inconftancy of his, but there found a free Trade, a peaceable refidence, and a very good efteem with that King and People, and much the better (as I con ceive ) by realbn of the prudence of my Lord Embaffadour, who was there (in fome fenfe) like in the Court of Vha- raoh ^ for whofe fake all his Nation there, feemed to fare the better. And we had a very eafie way upon any grievance to repair to that King as will appear now in my next Sedion, which fpeaks, SECTION XXIV. Of the Mogol, fhemug himfelf three times publickly unto his people every clay, and i oftentimes appear. F Irft, early in the morning, at that very time the Sun begins to appear above the Horizon, He appears unto his people in a place very like unto one of our Balconies, made in his Houfes, or Pavilions for his morning appearance,^ diredly op- pofite to the Eaft, about feven, or eight foot high from the ground, againft which time a very great number of his people, efpecially of the greater fort, who defire as often as they can to appear in his eye, affemble there together to give him the Salam^ or good mornings crying all out as fbon as they lee men /Hfcll Mfe ( m 4S^ A Voyage to E A S T-IN DI A, King with a loud voice, Padjha SaUmet, which fignifies, Live O great King, or, O great King, Health and life. At Noon he ftews himfelf in another place like the former, on the South-fide 5 and a little before Sun-fet, in a like place, on the Weft-fide of* bis Houfe, or T ent: but as foon as the Sun forlakes the Hemifphear he leaves his people ufheredin and out with Drums and Wind- inf h uments, and the peoples acclamations. ■ At both which times likewife very great numbers of hid people aflemble together to prefent themfelves before him.- And at any of thefe three times, he that hath a fuit to. the King ordefiresjufticeathishands, be he Poor, or Rich, if he hold' up a Petition to be feen, fliall be heard and anlwered. And between feven and nine of the Clock at night, he fits within Houle, or Tent, more privately in a fpacious place, cal led his Goaza/can, or bathing-houfe made bright, like day by abundance of lights, and here the King fits mounted upon a ftately Throne, where his Nobles and fuch as are favoured by him hand about him; others find admittance to, but by fpecial leave from his Guard, who caule every one that enters that place to breathe upon them; and if they imagine that any have drunk wine, they keep him out. ■ At this time my Lord Embafladour made his ufual addrefles to him, and I often waited on him thither; and it Was a good time to do bufinefs with that King, who then was for the moft part very plealant, and iull of talk unto thofe which were round about him, and fo continued till he fella lleep (oft times by drinking) and then all aliembled, immediately quitted the place, except thofe which were his trufted lervants, who by turns watched his perfon. The Mogol hath a moft ftately, rich, and fpacious houfe at Agra, his Metropolis, or chief City, which is called his Palace Royal, wherein there are two Towers, or Turrets about ten topt fajiare covered with maffie Gold (as ours are ufually with Lead) this I had from Tom Cory at, as from other Englifh Mer chants, who keep in a Faftory at that place. And further they told me, that he hath a moft glorious Throne within that his alace, alccnded by divers fteps, which are covered with plate 1 n! e . r ' up 0n the top of which afcent ftand four Lions upon p edeftals(of curioufly coloured Marble) which Lions are all made of Malhe filver, fome part of them guilded with gold, and befet with precious ftones. Thofe Lions fupport a Canopy _ot pure gold under which the fits, when as he appears in his great eft ftate and glory. t or the beauty of that Court, it confifts not in gay and gorei- ous apparel, for the Country is fo hot, that they cannot endure any thing that is very warm, or maffie 3 or rich about them. 1 Mogol himfelt tor the moft part is covered with a garment (as betorc ddenbed) made of pure, white, and fine Cailico- laune 3 and io are his Nobles, which garments are v\aftied after mmA Voyage to EAST-INDIA, &amp;c. 457 after one days wearing. But for the though his cloath- ingbenotricliandcodly;, yet I believe that there is never a Monarch in the whole world that is daily adorned with fo ma ny Jewels as himfelfis. Now^ they are Jewels which make mens covering moft rich 5 fuch as people in other parts fome- times wear about them, that are otherwife moft meanly habi ted. To which purpofe I was long fince told by a Gentleman of honour, fent as a Companion to the old Earl of Nottingham^ when he was imployed as an extraordinary Embaffadour by King- James, to confirm the peace made 'twixt himfelf and the King of Spain, which Emballadour had a very great many Gentlemen in his train, in as rich clothing as Velvets and Silks could make 5 but then there did appear many a great Don, or Grandee in the Spamjb Court, in along black bays Cloak and Caflack, which had one Hatband of Diamonds, which was of more worth by far, than all the bravery of the Ambafladors many Followers. ■ . . : But for the Mogol, T wonder not at his manry Jewels, he be ing fas 1 conceive) the greateft, and richeft Mafter of precious ftones that inhabits the whole earth. For Diamonds (which of ail other are accounted moft precious ft ones J they are found in Decaff (where the Rocks are, out of which they are digged) the Princes whereof are the next Neighbours and Tributaries to the great Mogol, and they pay himas TFribute many Diamonds yearly-5 and further, he hath the refufal ot all thofe rich ftones they fell,' he having Gold and Silver in the greateft abundance, (and that will purchafe any thing but heaven)&amp;: he wil part with any mony for any Gems befidejthat are precious and great,whe ther Rubies, or any other ftones of value,as alfo for rich Pearls. And his Grandees follow him in that fancy : for one of his great Lords gave our Merchants there, twelve hundred pounds flerling for one Pearl which was brought out of England. The Pearl was (haped like a Pear, very large, beautiful, and ori ent, and fo its price deferved it ftiould be. ^ Now the Jldogol having fuch an abundance of Jewels, wears many of them' daily 5 enow to exceed thofe women, which 'Rome was wont to fhew in their Star-like drefles^ who m the height and profperity of that Empire * wweJaid to wear the Jpoils of Nations in one ear.

Jewels, and many other glittering vanities. This Feaft is ufually kept by the while he is in his Pro- grefs, and lodges in Tents. Whether his Diet at this time be greater than ordinary I know not 5 for he always eats in private amongft his Women 3 where none but his own Family fee him while he is eatings which Family of his confiftsof his Wives, and Children, and Women, and Eunuchs, and his Boys ^ and none but thefe abide and lodge in the Kings Houfes, or Tents, and therefore how his fable is fpread, I could never know ^ butdoubdefs he hath of all thofe varieties that Empire affords, if hefo pleafe. His food (they fay) is ferved in unto him in Veflels of Gok^which covered and brought unto him by his Eunuchs,after it is proved by his Tafters, he cats, not at any fet times of the day, but he hath provifion ready at all times, and calls for it when he fc Imngry, and never but then. 1 he fir ft of September (which was the late Mogol's birth day) he retaining an ancient yearly Cuftom, was, in the pre- i^nce of his chief Grandees, weighed in a Balance 5 the ^Cere mony was performed within his Hou{e 5 or Tent,^ a fair fpacious Room, whereinto none were admitted but by fpeciafleave. The Scales in which he was thus weighed were plated with Gold, and fo the beam on which they hung, by great Chains made likewifeof that moft precious Metal, the King fitting in one of rhem was weighed firft againft filver Coin, which im mediately after was diftributed among the poor 5 then was he weighed againft Gold 5 after. that againft Jewels (as they fay) but I obferved (being prefent there with my Lord Ambaflador) that he was weighed againft three ieveral things, laid in filken Bags on the contrary Scale.

Then he drinks to his Nobles in his Royal wine (as that of A- hafaerush caWed, Eflh, I. j.) who pledge his health : at which fblemnity he drank to my Lord Ambaffadour, in a Cup of Gold moft curiouily enameled^ and fet all over the outfide with ftones (which were fmall Rubies, Turkefles 3 and Emeralds) with a Cover, or Plate, to fet in it in, both of pure Gold, the brims of which plate, and the cover were enameled, and let with ftones as the other, and all thefe together weighed twenty and four ounces of our Englifll weights, which he then gave unto my Lord Ambaffadour, whom he ever ufed with very much refpedt, and would moreover often ask him, why he did not defire fome good, and great gifts at his hands, be being a great King, and able to give it 5 the Embafladour Wduld reply. That he came not thither to beg any thing of him^ all that he defired, was that his Countrey-men the Englifti might have a free, fafe, and peaceable trade in his Dominions: The Mogol would anlwer that he was bound in honour to afford them that, we coming from the furthermoft parts of the world to trade there 5 and would often bid the Ambaffadour to ask fomething for himfelf,who to this would aufwe^that if that Ring knew not better to give, then he knew to ask, he muft have nothing from him. Upon thele terms they continually both ftood, fo that in conclufiun the Embaffadour had no gift from him, but that before-mentioned, befides an horfo or two, and fometimes a Veft, or upper Garment, made of (light Cloth of Gold,which the Mogol would firfl: put upon his own back, and then give it to the Embaffadour. But the Mogol ( if he had fo pleafed) might have beftowed on him fome great Princely gift, and found no greater mifsofit, than there would be of a Glafs of water taken out of a great Fountain. Now although the Mogol had fuch infinite Treafure , yet he could find room toftoreup more ftill: the defires of a covetous heart being fo unfatiable, as that it never knows when it hath enough : being^ like a bot- tomlefs purfe that can never be fill'd 5 for the more it hath, the more ftill it covets. ^ See an image hereof in Alcmaon^ who being will a by fits to go into his Treafure-houfe, and there take as much GoUl as himfelf could carry away 5 provided for that pnrpo.e a long Garment that was double down to his ankles, and great boots, and fill'd them both 5 nay , he fluffed his mouth and tied wedges of Gold to the locks of his head, and doubt e s, but for killing himfelf, he would have fill'd his skull and bowels therewith. Here was an heart fet upon Gold, and Gold over- lading an heart: for the man flowing To much about him, as that he could not ftir with it, forfeited what he might have had, Nnn 2 and^6o A Voyage to EAST-INDIA, and was turned out of the Treafury, as poor and empty as he eame into it. He is a rich man whatever he hath (be it more or lefs) that is contented. He is a poor man, who ftill wants more, in becoming poor by plenty, wanting what he hath as well and as much as what he hath not 3 and fo do very many who are the greateft engroflers of the worlds wealth. 9 ■. r\ r; r'....&gt; ' ..

The Mogol made fome further trials like this,. where the Ape did his part as before. And before the was taken out of his prefence , this ftrange,' and unex- - iollowln g came into the King's thought. There are Uaid he) many difputes in the World about that true Pro- phct which hould come into the World.

Then a great Nobleman of that Courtj and in high favour with the King, faid 3 that it wasfome impofture of the Chriftians Cthough there were none that did bear that Name there prefent) and defired that he might make a third trial 5 which graiited 3 he put but eleven of thofe names toge ther, referving the name of Chrift in his hand 5 the Ape fearch- ing as before;, puird forth his paw empty^ and fo twice., or thrice together, the King demanding a reafonfor this, was an- fwered, that haply the thing he looked for was not there ; he was bid to fearch for it, and then putting out thofe eleven names one after the other, inafeeming indignation rent them 5 then running to Mabohet-Chan caught him by the hand where the Name of Chrift was concealed, which delivered, he opened the Scroll, and fb held it up to the King, but did not tear it as the former^upon which the Mogol took the Ape 3 and gave his Keeper a good Penfion for to keep him near about him, calling him the Divining Ape,and this was all that followed upon this admirable thing, except the great wonderland amazement of that people. There was one fome years linfce wrote this ftory (but fojne- what varied from that I have hfcfe related) in a little printed Pamphlet, and told his Reader that I had often feen that Ape while Hived in thofe parts,which particular he fliould have left out 5 but for the Relation it felf, I believe it was fo,becau(e it hath been often confirmed there in its report unto me by divers perfons, who knew not one another, and were differing in Reli- on 3 yet all agreed in the ftory ,and in all the circumftances thereof.

So that it might be faid of him, quando male nemo 'pejus ^ that when he did wickedly none could do worfe, as if it had been true of him which was fpoken of that monfter Ner^obferved before, who was called Ltttum Jangnine maceratumfint foaked in blood. For his good adHons, he did relieve continually many poor people 5 and not (eldom would (hew many expreffions of duty and ftrongaffedionto his Mother then living, fo that he who efteemed the whole world as his Vaffals would help to carry her in a Palankee upon his (boulders. The Mogol would often vifit the Cells of thofe he efteemed re ligious men, whofe Perfonshe efteemed facred, as if they had been Demigods, And he would fpeak moft refpedively of our bleffed Savi our Chrift^but his Parentage,his poverty^nd his crofs did fo con found his thoughts, that he knew not what to think of them. Laftly,the Mogol is very free and noble unto all thofe which fall into, and abide in his affection, which brings me now to fpeak SECTION XXVI. Of the exceeding great Fenfions the Mogol gives unto his SnbjeSls^ how they are raifed, and how long they are con- tinned^ &amp;c. WHich great revenues thatman^of them do enjoy a makes them to live like great Princes rather than other men. Nowforthofe Penfions, which arefo exceeding great, the Alogol in his far extended Monarchy allows yearly pay for one Million of Horfe j and for every Horfe and Man about eighteen pounds ftetling per annum^ which is exadly pa-id every5 poor iV.ll* j Man lyfjili eve'!

Now fbme of the Mogol's moft beloved Nobles have the pay of fix thoufand horfe 5 and there are others (at the leaft twenty in his Empire) which have the pay of $ooohorfe ;) exceeding large Penfions above the revenue of any other Subjedh in the whole World., they Amounting unto more than one hundred thoufand pounds yearly unto a particular man. Now others have the pay of four thoufand horfe 5 others of three, or two, or one thoufand horfe, and Co downward 5 stnd tKPefe by their propor tions , are appointed to have horfes always in readinefs well mann'd, and otherwife appointed for the Rings fervice, fo that he who hath the pay of five, or fix thoufand, muft always have one thoufand in readinefs, or more, according to the Kings heed of them, and fo in proportion all the reft which enables them on a fudden to make tip the number, at the leaft of two hundred thoufand horfe 5 of which number, they have always at hand one hundred thoufand to wait upon the King wherefo- cver he is. There are very many private men in Cities and Towns, who arc Merchants, or Trades-men that are very rich: but it is not fafefor them that are fo, fo to appear j left that they ftiouldbe ufed as fili'd Sponges. But there is never a Subject in that Empire, who hath Land of inheritance, which he may call his own| but they are all Te nants at the will of their King 5 having no other title to that they enjoy befides the Rings favour, which is by far more eafily loft than gotten 5 It is true, that the King advanceth many there, unto many great honours, and allows them (as before) marvel lous great revenues 5 but no Son thfer^ enjoys either the Titles, or Means of his Father that hath had Penfions from that Ring, for the Ring takes pofleffion of all when they are dead, appoint ing their Children fbme competent means for their (ubfiftencej which they (hall not exceed, if they fall not into the Rings af- fe&lt;5tion as their Fathers did 5 wherefore many great men in this Empire live up to the height of their means ^ and therefore have a very numerous train, a very great retinue to attend up on them, which makes them to appear like Princes, rather thanSubje&amp;s. t w x. Yet this their necefTary dependance on their Rmg binas them unto fuch bale (ubje^ion , as that they will yield with readinefs unto any of his unreafonable arid willful commands. As Tint arch writes of the Souldiers of Scipi»^ Nulltts eji horum^ qui non confiettfa turri femet in mare pr£cipaturus ft, j( jujfero^ There was never a one in his Army, by his own report, t at would not for a word of his mouth, have gone up into a Tower, and caft himfelf thence head-long into the Sea : and thus t e people here will do any thing the Ring commands them to 05 fo that if he bid the Father to lay hands of violence upon his bon. alM- tIIA Voyage to EAST INDIA, Son 5 or the Son upon his Father 3 they will do it, rather than the will ot the King (houldbe difobeyed. . Thus fometting Na- turej rather than Subjedion. i • of theirs ^ ra 5 r ) u P on the Kings favour makes all iusSubjcfts moft fervile flatterers, for they will commend any ot us actions, though they be nothing but cruelty ^fo any oi his fpeeches 5 though nothing but folly. And when the King fits and fptaks to any of his people publickly, there is not a word falls from him that is not written by fome Scriveners or Scribes, that ftand round about him. In the year ^618. when we lived at that Court, there ap peared at once in the moneth of 'November in their Hemifphear two great Blazing-ftars, the one of them North, the other South, which unufual fight appeared there for the fpace of one moneth. One of thofe lirange Comets in the North, appeared like a long blazing-torch, or Launce fired at the upper end 5 the other in the South, was round like a pot boiling out fire. The Mogol confulted with his flattering Aftrologers, whofpake of tin lc Comets unto the King, as Daniel fometimes did of Nebu- chadmwars dre^m, Dan. 4.19. My Lord, the dream is to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof unto thine enemies. For his Aftrologers told him that he needed not trouble himfelf with the thought thereof, for it concerned other places and people, not him nor his. But not long after this, their feafon ot Rain, (before fpoken of) which was never known to fail till then, tailed them 3 and this caufed fuch a famine and mortality in the South parts of his Empire, that it did very much un people it; and in the Northern part thereof (whither the Mogol then repaired) his third Son Sultan Caroom railed, and kepttoge- VI ^ ^ 01 ar,(: ^ ftood upon his guard, and would not disband, till his Father had delivered his eldeft Son Snltan Coobfe- ro ° hands. And how, when he had him in his power he ufedhim, youfhall after hear. In the mean time, take one admirable example of a very grois flatterer but a great Favorite of that King, who was noted above others of that Nation to be a great ,negle6i:er of God, be lieving it Religion enough to pleafe the Mogol hisMafter. This man was a Souldier of an approved valour : But upon a time he Uting in dalliance with one of his women, flie pluckt an hair from his breaft (which grew about his Nipple) in wantonnefs, ichout the leaft thought of doing him hurt. But the Jirtle wound that Imall and unparalle'd inftrument of death made, preiently began to fefter, and in fliorttime after became a Can- Ker mcurablej in fine, when he faw that he muft needs dye, he i WO u whl r ch . are worth the remembringof all that inall ever hear them, faying,: Who would not have thought bu Leen hred a Soddter,Jhould have dyed Enemy, by a Sword', or a Launce, or an Arr m- ippw WMBmA Voyage to EAST-INDIA, &amp;€. 4^5 inflruwent vf death : But now (though too late) I am forcd to confcfi that there is a great God above^ whofe Majejly I have ever dejpifed, that needs no bigger Launce than an hair to kill an Atheifi^ or a defpifer of his Majejiy* And fo, defiring that thofe his laft words might be told unto the King his Mafter, he died. The Mogol never advanceth anyj but he gives him a new name , and this of fome pretty hgnification 5 as Pharoah did untojojeph, when he made him great in his Court, Gen. 4.1. 45. The new names (I fay) that the Mogol gives unto thofe he ad vances and favours, are fignificant. As Afaph Chan, The gather ing, or rich Lord ^ whofe Sifter the Mogol married, and the was his moft beloved Wife : and her Brothers marvellous great riches, anfwered his name } for he died worth many Millions (as I have been credibly informed) the greateft Subjed (I believe) for wealth that ever the World had. So another of the Mogols Grandees was called The beloved Lord. Ano ther Chan-Jahan, The Lord of my heart. Another Chan-Allaam, The Lord of the World. Another Chan-Channa, The Lord of Lords. He called his chief Phyfician Mocrob-Chan, The Lord of my health 5 and many other names, like thefe, his Grandees had, which at my being there belonged to his moft numerous Court. And further for their Titles of honour there, all the Kings Children are called Sultans, or Princes 5 his Daughters ^/,or Princelles j the next title is equivalent to a Duke^ the next Channa , a double Lord, or Earl 5 the next Chan, a Lord. So Meirfa fignifies a Knight, that hath been a General, or Commander in the Wars 5 ZJfnbra, a Captain ^ Hadde, a Ca» valier, orSouldier on hor(e-back 1 who have all allowed them means by the King (as before) proportionable for the fupports of their Honours, and Titles, and Names. His Officers of State are his Treafurers, which receive his re venues in his feveral Provinces, and take care for the payment of his great Penfions, which, when they are due, are paid wit h out any delay: There his chief Eunuchs (which command the reft of them) take care for the ordering of his Houfe, and are Stewards and Controulers of it &gt; his Secretaries, theMafters of his Elephants-, and the Mafters of his Tents are other ot his great Officers ^ and fo are the keepers of his Ward-robe, who are entrufted with his Plate and Jewels. To thefe I may add thofe which take care of his Cuftoms for Goods brought into his Empire, as for commodities carried thence. But thefe are not many, becaufe his Sea-ports are but few. The Cuftoms paid in his Ports are not high, that ftrangers of all Nations may have the greater encouragement to Trade there with him. But as ne expeds money from all ftrangers that Trade there.- So it is a fault he will not pardon (as before) for any to carry any quanti ty of filver thence. He hath other Officers that fpread over his Empire^ to exad monies out of all the labours ofthat P ec) ^ e &gt;A Voyage to EAST-INDIA, &amp;€. who make the curious manufaftures. So that like a ^reat Tree he receives nourifhment from every, even theleaft Roots that grow under his (hadow ^ and therefore though his Penfions are exceeding great (as before^ they are nothing comparable to his much greater revenues. ■ By reafon of that Countries immoderate heat, our Englifh- clont b iv not fit to make Habits for that people: that of it which is laltl .ihere, is moft of it for colour Red 5 and this they imploy for the moft part to make coverings for their Elephants and Horfes, and to cover their Coaches, the King himfelf taking a very great part thereof5 whofe payments are very good, only the Merchant muft get the hands of fome of his chief Officers to his Bill 3 appointed for fuch difpatches, which are obtained as ibonassdefired. And this the King doth to prevent the abufes of particular, and fingle perfons.

Thefe Tents, I fay^hen they are al together,cover fuch a great quantity of ground, that I believe it is five Englilh-miles at the leaft, from one fide of them to the other, very beautiful to behold from fome Hill, where they may be all feen at once. They write of Xerxes, that when from fuch a place he took a view of his very numerous Army, confiftingat the leaft of three hundred thoufand men, he wept, faying, that in lefs than the compafs of one hundred years, not one of that great mighty Hoft Would be alive. And to fee fiich a company then together of all forts of people (and I (hall give a go©d reafon prefently why I believe that mixt company of men, women, and children may make up fuch an huge number, as before I named, if not exceed it) and to confider that death will feize upon them all, within fuch a fpace of time, and that the fecond death hath fuch a power over them, is a thing of more fad confideration. Now to make it appear that the number of people of all forts is fo exceeding great, which here get and keep together in the Mogols Leskar^ or Camp Royal 5 firft there are one hundred thoufand Souldiers, which always wait about that King (as be fore obferved) and all his Grandees have a very great train of fol-'' i tliat A Voyage to E A S T-IN DI A, &amp;■('. followers and fervants to attend them there, and ib have all other men according to their feveral qualities; and all thefe carry their Wives and Childern, and whole family with them, which muft needs amount to a very exceeding great number. And further to demonftrate this =, when that King removes from one place to another, forthefpace of twelve hours, a broad pafiage is continually fill'd with Paflbngers, and Elephants and Horfts, and Dromedaries, and Camels, and Coaches, and Alies, and Oxen, (on which the meaner fort of men and women with little children, ridejfo full as they may well pafs one by the other.

The Mogol of all his lb many Wives and Concubines had but fix Children, five Sons and one Daughter. The Names he gave his Children 3 and others a were Names that proceeded from Counfel ( as he imagined ) rather than Chance. His eldeft Son was called Sultan Coobfurroo, which fignified the Prince with the good Face, his Perfon and Beauty anfwered his Name ^ for he was a Prince of a very lovely prefence. - His fecond Son hecal* led Sultan Peru*#, Prince of the Pleiades, or of the fweet influ ences of the Pleiades.

Now all thefe Letters were written in the Perfian Tongue, the Court-Language there, and their Copies were fent to the Ambaffadour , that he might get them ttanflated. The Originals rowled up fomewhat long, were covered with Cloth of Gold, fealed up on both endSj the fafhion in that Court and Country to make up Let ters, though they be not all cloathed there in fuch a glorious drefs.

But for the Jefuits there 5 There was one of that Order, in Goa (a City of the Portugah lying ijn the (kirts of Ivdia ) of very much Fame and Renown called Jeronymo Xaviere , fent for by Achabar-sha , the late Kings Father, in the year 1596. to argue before him the Do- ftrine of Chriftianity : there being alwayes prefent a MooUa y or Mahometan Prieft 5 and a Third Pf rfon, whq followed no precile Rule, but what the Mght of Natur? meerly led him to 5 and thefe twq were to obtain what they could againft his Reafoning. .

That this Law thus delivered was moft conformable to right ion 5 And fo was not the Law of Mahomet, That Man fall'n from God by fin, was not able to recover himfelf from that Fall 5 and therefore it was neceflary that there fnould be one, more than a Man, to do it for him, and that that One &lt;;ould not be . That this One was Chrift 3 God as well as Man 5 God to fa- tisfie ( the Mahometans themfelves confefling that Chrift was the breath of God) 3 and Man to fuffer death as he did.

That the great worth and worthinefs (hining inthePerfbn of Chrift, was by far more excellent than any thing obfervable in Mahomet (for they themfelves confefs that Chrift lived without fin 3 when Mahomet himfelf acknowledgeth, that he had been a filthy perfon.) That the feigned 3 foolifli 9 and ridiculous miracles., which they fay were done by Mahomet^ were nothing comparable to the Miracles done by Chrift, who ( as the Mahometans con fefs) did greater Miracles than ever were done before or fincehim. . (( ^ That there was a great deal of difference in the manner of promulgating the Gofpel of Chrift, into the world? and the in troducing of the Laws of Mahomet, That Chrift hath purchafed Heaven for all that believe in him, and that Hell is prepared fqr all others that do not rely on him, and on him alone,for Salvation. There were many more particulars befidesthde, which that JeroK/mo Xaveere laid down before the Mogol ? to ground his ar guments on 2 which that Ring heard patiently, atfeveral times during thefpace of one year and a half? but at laft hefent him away back again to Goa honourably, with fome good gifts beftowed on him, telling him, as Felix did, after he had rea- foned before him, that he would call for him again when he had a convenient time^ A(£ts24.25. Which time or feafon, neither of them both ever found afterward. Thefe Particulars, which I have here inferted (with many more $ I might have added to them3 upon all which, that Jeronjmo Xaveere enlarged himfelf before the Mogol in his ar- euings before him) were given unto me in Latine by Fran~ cifco Corf, another Jefuit refident at that Court, while I was there, and long before that time. And further I have been there told by other people profeffing Chriftianity in that Em pire., that there was fuch a Difpute there heldi and for my part I do believe it. . r .. . , For that Francifco be was a Florentine by birth, aged about fifty years, who (if he were indeed what he feemed to be) was a man of afevere life, yet of a fair andanafiable / 'A-7- / difpofmon : He lived at that Court, as an Agent forthePortu- aalsv and had not only free accefs unto that King, but alio en couragement and help by hitts, which he fbmetimes beftowe ^When this Jefuit came fitft to be acquainted with my Lord Ambafladour, he told him that they were both by protelU- / A Voyage to EAST-INDIA, dSr.A Voyageto EAS T-INDI A, &amp;c. on ChriftianS;, though there was a vaft difference betwixt them in their profeffingof it. And as he (hould not go about to re concile the Embrifladour to them : So he told him that it would be labour in vain if he (hould attempt to reconcile him .to us# Only he defired, that there might be a fair correfpondency be- twixtthem 3 but nodifputes. And further, his defire was that thofe wide differences 'twixt the Church of Rome and us, might not be made there to appear, that Chrift might not feem by thofc differences to be divided amongft men profelling Chriftianity, which might have been a very main Obftacle, and hinderance unto his great Defign and endeavour 5 for which he was fent thither, to convert people unto Chriftianity there. Telling my Lord Embafladour further, that he (hould be ready to do for him all good offices of iove and fetvice there, and fo he was. After his firfl: acquaintance, he vifited us often, ufually once a week. And as thofe of that fociety, in other parts of the world are very great intelligencers: fo was he there, knowing all news which was ftirring and might be had, which he com municated unto us. And he would tell us many ftories befides s, one of \^hich, if true, is very remarkable. And it was thus 5 There are a race of people in Eaft'/W;^, the men of which race have (if he told us triie)^ their right legs extraordinary great andmiftiapen, their left legs are like other mens. Now he told us, that they were the pofterity of thofe who ftamped S* the Apoftle to death, come thither to preach the Gofpel ^ and that ever fince the men of that race have, and only they of that Nation, that great deformity upon them. Some few people I have there feen of whom this ftory b told, but whether that deformity be like Cehezas leprofie, hereditary 5 and if fo, whe ther it fell upon that people upon the occafion before-named 9 1 am yet to learn. The Jeluits mEzft'India (for he was not alone there) have liberty to convert any they can work upon, unto Chriftianity, &amp;c. The Mogol hath thus far declared, that it fhall be lawful for any one, perfwaded fo in confcience, to become a Chriftian, and that he (hould not by fo doing lofe his favour. Upon which ,1 have one thing,here to infert,which I had there by report (yet I was bid to believe it and report it for a truth) concerning a Gentleman of quality, and a fervant of the great Mogol, who upon fome conviftion wrought upon him (as, they fay) Would needs be Baptized and become a Chriftian. The King hearing of this Convert fent for him, and at firft with ma ny cruel threats commanded him to renounce that his new pro- feflion; the man replied,that he was moft willing to luffer any thing in that caufe, which the King^could inflid:. The Mogol then began to deal with him another way, ask- king why bethought himfelf wifer thebshis Fore-fathers, who lived and died Mahometans; and further added many pro- mifesA Voyage to EAST-INDIA, &amp;c. mifes of riches and honour, if he would return to his Mahome- tifrn, he replied agairij as they fay (for I have all this by Traditi on) that he would not accept of any thing in the world, fo to do : TheMogol wondring at his conftancy told him, that if he could nave frighted, or bought him, out of his new profeffion, he would have made him an example for/ all waverers 5 but now he perceived that his refblution indeed was to be a Chriftian, and he bid him fo continue, and with a reward difcharged him. The late Mogol about the beginning of his reign,caufed a Tem ple to be built in -/4gm,his chief City,for the Jefuits, wherein two of his younger Brothers Sons were folemnly Baptized, and de livered into their hands to be trained up in Chriftianity. The young Gentlemen, growing to fome ftature (after they had had their tuition for fome years) defired them to provide them Wives out of Chriftendom fitting their Birth ^ in which having not iud- den content, they gave up their Crucifixes again into the Je fuits hands, and fo left them. Who had thefe conjedures upon this their revolt, that either the Ring their Uncle caufed them tp be Baptized, to make them more odious to the Mahometans, being fo near of his blood 5 or elfe, it was his plot to get them beautiful Wives out of Europe^ which himfelf meant to take if he had liked them. The Jefuit I laft namedCorfa upon a time (at our be ing there) having his houfe, amongft very many more conlumed by aiudden fire, it fo was that his wooden Crofs, fet on a Pole near the fide of his houfe, was not (as hefaid)confumed. Up on which he prefently repaired to that Court, carried that Crofs with him, and told the King thereof. The Prince Ca~ room (who was no favourer of the Chriftians) being then pre- fent, and hearing him talk how his Crofs was preferved, derided him, faying, that it-was one of his fabulous miracles y and fur ther added, that he would have a fire prefently made before the King, whereinto he would have that Crofs caft * and it it con- fumed not, his Father^ himfelf, and all the people jhere would prefently become Chriftians 5 but if it did, himfelf ihould be burnt with it. The Jefuit not willing to put himfelf upon fo fudden and fo hot a trial, anfwered that he durft not tempt God, who was not tyed to times 5 and it might be that Almighty God, would never fhew that people that infinite favour to make them Chriftians, or if he had fuch a great mercy for them in ftore, it might be that the time of manifefting it, was not yet come 5 and therefore if he (hould now fubmit to that trial, and Almighty God not pleafe to (hew a further and a prefent miracle, his Reli gion would fufier prejudice there for ever after 5 and therefore hereflifed. It fhould feem that the Jefuits there do exceedingly extol the Virgin Mary^ which I have gathered from poor people therejNa- tives of that Country, who have often asked Alms ot me, when I ftirred abroad amonefl them &gt; and whereas one hath defired me4S0 A Voyage E A S T-IN DI A, &amp;c me to give him fome relief for Chrifts fake 5 there are many who have begged it for the Virgin il/^r/sfake. Well known it isjthat the Jefuits there 5 who like the Pharifees, Mat. 23. 25. That would compaf Sea and Land to make one Pro- felyte &gt; have fent into Chriftendom many large reports of their great Converfions of Infidels in Eafl-I'ndia. But all thefe boafi:- ings are but reports 5 the truth is, that they have there fpilt the precious water of Baptifmupon fome few Faces, working upon theneceffityof fome poor men, who for want of means, which fhey give them, are contented to wear Crucifixes 5 but for want of knowledge in the Dodrine of Chriftianity are only in Nam^ Chriftians. ^ So that the Jefuits Congregations there are very thin, confining of fome Italians, which the entertains (by great pay given them ) to cut his Diamonds, and other rich Stones 5 And of other European ftrangers which come thither 5 and fome few others of the Natives, before mentioned. So that in one word I ftiall fpeak this more of the Jefuits in Eafi-India, that they have there Tentplum, but not Ecclejiam, When I lived in thofe parts it was my earneft defire and daily prayer, to have put my weak hands unto that moft acceptable, but hard labour of walhing Moors,that the Name of Jefiis Chrift might have been there enlarged (if God had pleafed to honour me fo far) by my endeavours. But there are three main and apparent obftacles (befides thofe which do not appear) that hin der the fettlement and growth of Chriftianity in thofe parts. Fir ft. The liberty of the Mahometan Religion given the people there in cafe of Marriage. Secondly, The moft debaiich'd^ives of many coming thither, or living amongft them who profels themfelves Ghriftians 5 per quorum latera patitur Fwigelium, by whom theGofpel of JefusChrift is fcandalized, and exceeding ly fuffers. And laftly. The hearts of that people are fo con firmed and hardned in their own evil old ways, their ears fo fealed up, their eyes fo blinded with unbeliefand darknefs, that only he, who hath the Key of David that Jhutj when no man can op en 2 and opens when no man can font, can open to them the door of life, i ba V' FINIS</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100023517141.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>212.d.1.</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023517141.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: Printed Collections</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>212.d.1.</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘The travels of Sig.
