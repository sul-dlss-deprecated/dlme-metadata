B. m t s Political Agent, Bahrain. ip ■ y^\-/ !&gt; Memorandum: - I forward herewith three copies of the new rules laid down for the Shia Shera Appeal Court to come into force from now onwards. Adviser to the Government. h / s.z.The following rules will come into Jloui' from now onwards :- The Senior Kadhi supervises the Shia Shera Court and • acts as an adviser to the Shera Court. In the absence of the Kadhis or more than one of the Kadhis the Senior Kadhi will deal with Shera Cases. The Senior Kadhi has the power to look into any case if he thinks a decision was prejudiced. The Shera Kadhis can send any case to him for consultation before arriving at a judgment if they wish to djo so or at the request of one of the parties. Every judgment passed Shera Court is liable to 'Tamyiz' except if a compromise is arrived at between the two parties, in which case there is no reason to C'q£&amp; for a Tamyiz. Judgments passed by the Tamyiz Court, in Shera Cases* cannot be changed in any way. If there is any mistake or contradiction in the judgment the attention of the Senior Kadhi should be drawn to it by the Bahrain Court and the case will be reconsidered by him. As judgments passed by Bahrain Court can be appealed against, similarly any judgment passed by Shia Shera Court is liable to 'Tamyiz”. And the decision of the Tamyiz Kadhi is final. If any party against whom judgment is passed v/ishes his case to be reconsidered it will be done so but only by the Tamyiz Court. A case can only be reconsidered if it is sent by a higher Court : but after reconsidering a case no one has the right to ask for reconsiderin£p_t for a second time. Any party can refuse to accept a judgment passed by the Shia Shera Court and demand transfer of his case for Tamyiz. Cases cun be sent to the Senior Aadhi for Tamyiz for any1 ^■v 10 . 11 . 4L 12 . 13. 14. 15. any of the following reasons. if it can be proved by any party. (A) If the Shera Court dealt with a case in a prejudical manner. (3) If the judgment passed is contrary to the Shera law. (C) If the judgment made differs from a previous judgment in a similar case (if there is contradiction in judgment s). (D) If the judgment is not unanimous (i.e. passed by all the 3 Kadhis). (3) If there are documents and/or agreements which have been msunderstood or ignored by the Kadhis. (?) If the case has not been sufficiently studied by the Q,adhis or the judgment passed has not been in accordance with justice. A case can be sent for Tamyiz either by the Court which passed the judgment or by the Bahrain Court in writing or referred in the ordinary way. The party who wishes his case to be heard by the Tamyiz should put his objections and reasons in writing. In every case the objections should be reasonable and acceptable. The appellant should not demand to have a new or a separate case. The Senior Q,adhi has the right to ask to see the proceedings of the case and how a judgment was arrived at, he will go through the case and proceed with it from the beginning. The Tamyiz Court can cancel any judgment if it was found to be contrary to Shera law or if there is any contradic tions in the judgment, even if the points on v/hich the Tamyiz Court based its decision are not raised by the party who objected. The final judgment of the Senior Kadhi will be sent to the Court v/hich referred the case to him but that Court has no right to cancel the judgment. A case can be referred to Tamyiz if an application is made - during --3- during the same period as the appeals in Bahrain Court cases are accepted i. e. one month after the judgment. If any party dies the heirs or administrators have the $ right to conduct the case. 16. c °urt fees on appeal oases from Shera Court to Tamyiz will he on the same scale as Court fees in Bahrain Court appeals.Please say in each case that I am going away on tour in a few days time but will return after about two weeks and will then be glad to see him.
