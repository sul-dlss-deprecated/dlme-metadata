I forward herewith the following documents i - (a) A copy of the draft Muscat Civil Air Agreement. (b) A copy of the draft Air Navigation regulations made by the Sultan. (c) A copy of the draft Conditions governing the use of tihiscat aerodromes. (d) A draft of the letter it is proposed to address to the Sultan regarding facilities for the J oyal ^ir Force.

(g) A draft of the special rules for the conduct . and security of personnel at bal&amp;lah and Masirah. (h) A List of Points presented by the Dultan to the Political Agent. In (a), (b) and (c) numerous alterations have been suggested as a result of discussions with the dultan and Political Agent, Muscat. 3 . xhe following alterations are of a general nature i (a) t»t the dultan 1 s request the tit © 'His Highness' has been omitted throughout. Ibis title was also dropped in the 1939 Treaty. (b) &lt;4here necessary the phrase ' Muscat and cman' has been altered to 'the territories of the Sultan' so as to cover Gwadur. 4. The following alterations have been made in the dr»ft Civil Air i grcement * Article The singular 'aerodrome' has been omitted in two places as the agreement covers several aero dromes. This also applies to rtides 2, 3 and 6 . (Note. Regarding 'exclusive rights' see Article 17 sub paragraph (iv) below). i»rtic l e .. •.^ page a. article 2 &gt; M 0 n his beliair H has been substituted for 'On their behalf” in the first sentence* This alteration Is in my opinion logical* article $ * The first part of this Article has been re-dr&amp;fAuthorisation may be granted either by His iajesty’s Government or the Sultan according to circumstance s • ✓ 11 P, v. Article 4 * See paragraph 3 of your telegram Mo* 21391, dated the 9th December t 1946* This Article has been re~dr&amp;fted at the wish of the Sultan so as to accord as closely as possible with the terminology usuu in Article 5 of the Chicago Convention* .* , ^ article 5 . bee paragraph 6 of my telegram No. 1403 of the 3rd December* 1946* This Article has been re drafted in accordance with the Sultan's wishes* The word 'through” has been altered to 'with' towards the end of tne Article as the Sultan does not wish to be bothered with correspondence on technical matters* article 6 * I have omitted the reference to Part 11 and 111 of the Agreement* The regulations and conditions printed as Parts II and III of the old Agreement were not really parts of the Agreement at all and were not signed on behalf of His majesty's Government. If they are attached to the agreement they shoul appear as Appendices, but especially If the Agreement is to be communicated to the Council of the International Civil aviation Organization I consider it preferable that they should be treated as separate entitles* The words 'by the parties to this Agreement' have been added as the Sultan asked whose agreement was required to amendments under this * rtlcle and he has approved the addition* 1 consider it probably, however* that before the Agreement is signed he wll ask for the omission of the whole phrase 'subject to such amendments as may from time to time b© agreed by the parties to this Agreement” as he has asked In the regulations and conditions nothing should appear to show that they have been framed in consultation with fils Majesty's Government, although he is willing to agree in an exchange of letters that no alterations or additions should be made without such consultation* X see no objection to the omission provided letters are exchanged as suggested by the dultan. Article ? * 1 have omitted the singular 'station' as unnecessary* The last sentence has been added at the Sultan's wish* Article 15 * Paragraphs one and two have been omitted vide paragraph 8 of my telegram No* T/611, dated the 7th December, 1946* In my discussion with the Sultan I referred to the unratified 1939 Fuel Convention and the facts stated in paragraph 3 of letter No* &gt; *6^06/46, dated the 10th October, 1946, from the Ministry of /ivil viation, but as reported the Sultan will not willingly agree to a refund of duty on fuel and oil. / ^ '*' y The Sultan wishes paragrapn three to be re drafted so as to allow him to recover duty on spare parts, etc* supplied to foreign -ircraft* He eventually agreed to a re-draft of the paragraph in accordance with Article 24(b) of the Chicago Convention. This will technically permit him to recover duty on spare parts supplied to civil aircraft not engaged in &amp; scheduled international air service* As occasions for recovery of duty in these circumstances ire likely to be of rare occurrence I am doubtful whether the Sultan will in -raetlc* bothar himself about such recovery.. • *. 3 page 3* © AZ« (!)• % ith regard to the annual rental, the first suggestion a&amp;de to the Multan was £ .',000 and he countered by demanding £ 6 ,GOO* he has now agreed to accept £ 6,000 provided (a) rent is paid separately by the B«0 .a*C. and d.A*F. for the buildings at Salalah and «asirah and (b) if It is desired at a later date to develop additional landin£ grounds or flying boat bases there will be fresh negotiations (i,e* additional rental will be paid). He is willing to drop condition (b) if the annual rental is raised to £ 6 , 000 . (ii). The Political iigent reports that the rent which the Multan intends to demand for the buil dings at dalalah and ^asirah is likely to be heavy. Ihe Sultan showed the Political Agent an American statement of the total capital cost which amounted to 1 , 000,000 dollars. 5 he dult&amp;n admitted that tills was excessive but stated that he intended asking for rent for these bulldints bss^d on one- third of the above figure. At a subsequent interview he demanded £ 3,5200 as rent for all the buildings and said that if they ware not re uired he would dismantle them and use the materials elsewhere. X do not know whether the IwA.P. or B.t.A.C. require all the buildings, but would in any case that it is desirable that we should offer the Multan an increased rental under the Air Agreement in order to obtain the use of some or all of these buildings. I am doubtful if the Sultan will accept even £ 6,000 if the rent of these buildings and the ground rent of the other buildings fc .f. comrrents on paragraph &amp;(4) of the letter regarding facilities for the ir .A.k. in paregraph 7 below) is to be covered, and I suggest that I should be authorised to go up to £ 7,600 if necessary. It would assist me if 1 could be informed whether the h.A.F. or h.C.A.C. are willing to dispense with the use of some of the , merican buildings if the bultan insists on demanding rent for them on e capital cost basis. In dealing with this question it should be borne in miiKi that the Sultan is rather sore on account of whst he considers the unauthorised use by the r *.A.f. of these buildings c.f. correspondence ending with wy deni official letter Mb. 716 - 6 , dated the 7th September, 1946, to i*maldson. (iii). vith regard to condition (b) in the second sentence of sub-paragraph (i) above, throughout the negotiations the Sultan has been insisting tu«t the aero- drot*s covered by the Civil *ir Agreement should be specified. (He does not wish the r.A.F« to be limited to these specified aerodromes, and says they aay use all the nine aerodromes in his territories, and he would, 1 think, allow them to develop fresh aerodromes If they sc desired). I have accordingly prepared a ^chedole to be attached to the Agreement giving the names of the aerodromes which the Sultan regards as being covered by it. It has been specifically stated that the use of the aerodromes Includes the use of flying-boat b*ses where these exist at the sane place. Of tne places I have included In the Schedule Salalah and Maslrah are in regular use. At Gwadur the B.o.a.C* have recently laid •scorings for use In the event of emergency landings by flying-boats. 6 hina$ has been included because of its mention in Article 16 c.f. paragraph 9 of my telegram f o. ‘i/€lX, dated the 7th December, 946, and also because the 6 ult*n has mentioned it in his Point 19 vide document (h) listed in paragraph 2 . 1 have now received your telegram Bo. 21^67 of December 18th authorising the omialsslon of Article 16 but would ask that whole question of the aero dromes to bo covered by the Agreement should be considered In the light of what is stated in this and the ne^t succeeding sub-paragraph. Ihe following landing grounds which ei^lst have not been Included • ausc&amp;t, Has al Hadd, Dohar, Dhuwaimiyah, v-urbat. If it is desired that any of these should be Included in theV page 4. Schedule| I should be grateful for Instructions accordingly. (iv) • It must be borne in mind that the Inclusion of a landing ground in schedule II may impose an obligation as well as conferring a privilege. In fact the Sultan has raised this point in connection with the exclusive rights conferred under Article 1 and has asked wnat reply for instance he is to give to the Americans if they ask his permission to develop a landing ground at a place in his territories in which we are not interested c.f. Point 21 in the Sultan 1 s list of Points (item (h) in paragraph 2). He referred in particular to the enquiries made from him a few months ago about the use of the bhinas landing ground by the T.ifc.A. vide the paper forwarded under my printed letter J o. 663 • dated the 3rd September f 1946. 1 should be grateful for instructions regarding the reply to be given to him on this point. . ^&lt;1 '• article 16 . the last sentence has been added at the Sultan's wish viparagraph 11 of my telegram #©• -/611, dated the ?th December, 1946, and 1 suggest should be allowed to stand except that the bultan might be asked to agree to “review' being read for rt revision'. 6 . i'he following alterations have been mad© in the Air Navigation Pegulations. the Sultan has asked for more time to stony these regulations and 1 have just heard that he has suggested further alterations. I will address you regarding these separately* (The references below are to the rules as numbered in the 1934 Agreement). Heading. This has been revised c*f* paragraph 3. * Pula 1 - - This has been re-inserted vide paragraph 12 of my telegram No* T/611* dated the 7th December, 1346* The Dultan has agreed that the authorisation should be for the service and not for each specific aircraft engaged on it* Xhe question of the fee to be charged has not been discussed with him and 1 should be grateful for instructions regarding the advice to be given to him on this point. Please see also my comments on Point 18 in paragraph VO* lule 14(111)• The Sultan insists that the penalties for the infringement of the Regulations should be specified* The last portion of this sub-rule has been altered accordingly* The penalties are those prescribed in King's Regulation No. 1 of 193b. 6 * The following alterations have been made in the conditions governing the use of aerodromes* uandlnK * This has been revised c.f* paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 Article 6 . i^qle 1 . (i). In accordance with the Sultan's wishes the words 'as agents of the Sultan' have been added afWr “His Majesty's uoverncient” in the opening phrase. I am inclined to think that it is inappropriate that His Majesty's Government should be mentioned In these conditions, especially in view of the revised heading anb would suggest the omission of the words “or by ills ajesty's Government, as agents of the Sultan, their servants or agents'*. If necessary notices can be posted at aerodromes disclaiming responsibility on behalf of His Majesty's Government. (ii)# A nev? sentence has been added as desired by the Sultan. The last words originally read 'through the negleet ,, of an air service or its employees'. The Sultan has • * * *page 5 Thf Sultan has insisted on omitting mention of w nofclect ,, but )im explained that if one of tils sublet* sufx'ars injury tlrr ough his own fault damage will not bo claimed* I suggest that the addition made be allowed to stand in its present form* hale 4 « this has been added as desired by the Sultan* He is wii.ing to confirm b&gt; an exchange of letters that the rules will be framed in consultation with the Political Resident* I suggest that the rule be accepted on this condition. hale, 5 * this is new but appears unobjectionable. ?. With reference to the draft letter regarding facilities (Item (d) In paragraph 2), the Sultan accepts paragraph 1 thereof and in fact is willing to grant more c.f. paragraph 4 Article 17(iii) of this letter. Paragraph 2 ( 1 ) requires no eommnt at this stage. fclth regard to paragraph 2 ( 2 ), while the sultan does not mind what arms and ammunition are maintained at laslrah he is anxious that at Salaiah they should be reduced to u minimum and in particular has asked that no bombs should be kept there. He has also objected to machine-guns but might be persuaded tc agree to one or two for post defence purposes* I should be grateful for a statement of the armament which the H.A.F. consider it essential to retain at Halalah. Paragraph 2( *) requires no comment. It may be possible tc omit all or part of paragraph 2(4) if the subsidy Is increased c.f. paragraph 4 Article 17(11). The - other builaings*’ mentioned are those which have been constructed from time to time by the l.A.F. or B.O.A.C. 1 am not sure of what these buildings consist but I understand they include a 'beach wasp 11 at dalalah, vide Point 1 in the Sultan's hist of Points (item (h) in paragraph 2 ). I also understand that the buildings both at Salalah and ^aslrah are very much scattered no doubt as a precaution against air attack. It is desirable that in any case the k.A.F. (and if necessary the B.O.A.C.) should define at once the ground and buildings which they wish to retain, though it should be borne in mind that if any “other’buildings' ©re abandoned the Sultan will regard them in future as ills property. Vith reference to paragraph 2(6), the Sultan states that the number of points to be guarded has recently been Increased from sir to ten, hence his demand for an Increased number of askars. It Is desirable tnat the H.n.F. should examine the possibility of reducing the points to be guarded. The bultan will certainly insist on the continued employment of local askars at Salalah and their payment by the r.A.F. or B.O.A.C. as the case may be. The Sultan has not prescribed any special conditions about the employment of guards at ssasirah and it is left to the H.A.F. or B.u.A.C. to make their own arrangements. ith reference to paragraph 2 ( 6 ), I am told that the eskers at Salalah are at present provided with very inadequate accommodation. * 1th reference to paragraph 3, the Sultan is not willing that the option of renewal grant©i to His Majesty's Government by Article 18 of the Civil Air Agreement should apply to li.A.F. facilities.iL — ■page 6 . * 8 . The Sultan has asked that R.A.F* vehicles stationed at Salaleh and Masirah should bear numbers. There will presumably be no difficulty in complying with this request which is not mentioned in any of the documents forwarded herewith. 9 . In return for the facilities to be granted to the H.A.F. the Sultan has asked for (a) the supply on payment of certain arms and amunition y and (b) facilities for the purchase of U•&amp;»&gt;*• dollars. frith regard to (a) the Sultan requires t 1. 250 .303 rifles latest type issued to British ; i rmy with slings and spares. 2 . 1,50*000 rounds .303 ammunition. 3. 24 Service revolvers. 4 . 3 f 00C cartridges for above revolvers. t 5. 3 V.B« macaine guns. He wishes these arms* etc. to be delivered at Salalah and says he requires them for a local Bolice force which he is thinking of raising. He proposes to store them in his fprt where there is* according to him* no danger of their failing into the hands of the tribesmen. It would appear from this request that the Sultan's negotations with the Americans for the purchase of arms (vide correspondence ending with your telegram Ho. 16456* dated the 2nd September, 1946) have fallen through* though i have not questioned him on this oint as the Americans wight not like him to know that they had consulted us on the subject. frith regard to (b) # the Sultan wishes to obtain a credit of 20,000 U.a.A. dollars during 1947 to purchase cars and trucks. H 6 has said nothing about possible further requirements in subsequent years. 1 reeomraend that if possible both the oultan's requests should be granted. 10 * fcith reference to the exchange of letters re£&amp;* f Hng interim arrangements (items (e) and (f) in para graph 2) I instructed the Political Agent to discuss with the dultan the latter's demands for ® limitation of the Interim period and a promise for the continuance of the war subsidy if the negotiations break down, is a result of this discussion Sultan has stated that he will wait for a reply on these points until after the prorosed visit of the Political Agent to Saialah early in 1947. This means that if the negotiations am sue ess fully concluded during this visit the Sultan's demands will automatically lapse but that otherwise we shall have to let him have a reply. In the event of the breakdown of the negotiations the dultan would appear to have some claim to a continuance of the war subsidy c.f. the terms of the letter addressed to him by tlx* Political ^gent on the 5 th *?ay, 1946. a copy of which was forwarded under endorsement Ho. c/ll. * dated the 18th ay* 1946. 11. The Special Buies for the Conduct and Security of Personnel (item (g) in paragraph 2) contain few additions to those already in force at Salalah, which were approved by the Government of India in their express letter fro. B.1726 - KA2* dated the 13th July, 1942 (no copy to India Office). I suggest that it be left to me to approve them after consultation with the Air Officer Commanding* Aden.page ?• 30 The Sultan has agreeci that his ’‘rolnts’ , vi e i In XHSiraKraph can be conf irtae 3 by a separate lettar and naai not be covered by anyofthe otherdocuments.

Use or establishment by foreign lines of aercJromes not covered by the Civil Air Agreement. This point which is a most l&amp;portant one has been dealt with in paragraph 4 Article 17(iv). 13. An addition®! ‘point 1 which has been raised separately by the Fultan arid not included in his list is that the B.O.A.C. suould agree to accept and carry free of charge ’ letters arid small parcels and to grant free passage to hi'i and his staff up to two persons between aerodromes in his territory and Karachi whenever such accommodation can be provided witaout dislodging passengers whose aecommoostlon has already been secured, this should be conceded if possible. 14. Ihe dultan is prepared to accord the same treat* raent to Indian as to britisn civil aircraft for so long as India remains within the Umpire. Actually the civil Air Agreement allows for little or no discrimination between British and foreign aircraft. 16. I apologise for the great length of this reference, ihe cultan would, I think, be willing to accept tnf docaments (® 1 * (b), (c) and (d) as they now stand, except for the modifications in (b), and the only questions of reri importance outstanding are dealt with in ny comments on Article 17 of the Agreement in paragraph 4. I should like to be in a position to give a favourable reply to his requests contained in paragraph 9 and to answer as many as possible of the points discussed in paragraph 12 though some of tnese could, I think, safely be left for settlement at a later date. 1£* As soon as 1 receive final instructions from its Majesty* s Government which I hope will not be later than the middle of January, 1 propose that Major Stewart should proceed to Dhofar for further dis usslo: s with the Sultan and, it is hoped, the final conclusion of the -agreement. As mail boats now very rarely call at Muscat it will be necessary to ask ••••page 9 to ask the A.I.C.C. to transport liejor Stewart from Muscat to Dhofar by tanker, and I suggest that when the time comes this should' be a ranged in iiondoa with tiie A.I.O.C’s head office. 17. If necessary in order to obtain rapid decisions on the points at issue a conference might be held at Cairo early in January between representatives of the India Office, P*A.F. and li.O.A.C* and myself. I am not personally anxious to attend such a conference as it will interfere with my tour programme but It might save correspondence. I would suggest that in any case while tne Political Agent, Muscat, is at Salalah the Air Officer Commanding, ^ den, or some senior Air Staff Officer should meet him there and also if possible fly with him to M&amp;sirah in order to discuss on the spot future H.A.F. requirements as well as the Sultan's conditions, special rules arid points so fsr as they affect the i,A,F.

Xw * Reference paragraph 6 of my express letter No. 1172 - S, dated the 19th December, 1946. 2. The Sultan has asked for the following additions to be made in the Air Navigation Regulations t (i) The following rule to be added after or as part of rule 1 « 'The application for grant of authorisation to an aircraft of a scheduled international air service to fly over or within the Sultan* s territories and territorial waters shall be made by the registered owner of the aircraft or his proxy, and shall clearly state the class of authori sation required'. When I was in Muscat I understood that the Sultan had agreed to grant authorisations for scheduled services instead of for individual aircraft c.f. paragraph 4 of your telegram No. 21391, dated the 9th December, 1946 (not repeated to Muscat)• He appears to have gone back on this but I have asked the Political Agent for further elucidation. Apart from this 1 see no objection to the addition. (ii) The following rule to be added after paragraph 13 i 'Any laws and regulations not covered by paragraph 13 but which are generally adopted by the Inter national Air Navigation Organisation shall also apply'. . i. * The Political Agent reports that this has been drawn up with item J of Article 37 of the Chicago Convention in mind and is intended to replace a long list of customs regulations which the uultan wished to specify in a separate schedule. I see no objection to the addition but suggest the inclusion of 'so far as they are applicable' or similar phrase at the end of it. (ill) The Sultan wishes paragraphs 14, 18 to 25 and 28 of the draft Egyptian Air Navigation Regulations (Section X), suitably amended and altered to meet fuscat requirements, to be included somewhere in his Regulations. I have no copy of the Egyptian Regulations and cannot comment. A copy may kindly be sent to me. Meanwhile, on the assumption that a copy is available with His Majesty's Government, it may kindly be considered whether there is any objection to rules being added as proposed. 3 So far as ...4 page 2 * 3. So far as I am aware, the only point outstanding that is not covered by this express latter or my express letter under reference is the Sultan*s request for an assurance that he will not be called upon to bear any expense on quarantine f-rrangeffients c.f* paragraph 3 of my telegram No. T/611, dated the 7th December, 1946.

IMPORTANT. Your Express Letter No. 1172-S of December 19th and connected correspondence. MUSCAT AIR AGREE* MENT. 2 # His %jesty's Government have now been in formed that B.O.A.C. have decided that they will have no requirements in Muscat territory for as long as they can foresee and are ready to withdraw at about 14 days notice. They can if necessary dispense with emergency landing facilities at Gwadur. There will therefore be no advantage in proceeding further with negotations of Civil Air Agreement proper. 3 . Royal Air Force requirements however as stat ed in paragraph 1 of Appendix D of your express letter still standing. They wish to maintain aerodromes at Masirah and Salalah ( but no where else ) as an insurance against cessation of facilities on Egypt-Iraq-Persian Gulf route. 4 . Royal Air Force will need majority of American buildings. Details ? will be communicated to you by Air Officer Commanding Aden. P.O.A.C. buildings may be surrendered to Sultan but since I understand Sultan has no right to these it is desirable to obtain from Sultan suchsuch credit as possible for handifcg them over. 5. Paragraph 2(2) of Appendix D. Air Officer Comraanding Aden has undertaken to reduce arras and ammunition at Salalah to a minimum and remove bombs. 6 . Paragraph 2(5) of Appendix D. Air Officer Commanding considers neither present number of 62 ASKARS at Salalah nor any of points to be guarded need be increased. 7. Last sentence of paragraph No.3 of Appendix D. His Majessty’s Government would prefer that this should read n understood this period may be extended with Your Highness' agreement on such conditions etc.,'. 8 . Paragraph No.9 of your Express Letter. There should be no difficulty about supply of arms on payment. His Majesty's Government would however be reluctant to supply dollars unless Sultan ? is insist ent. 9. Appendix G. Rules of conduct may be agreed locally with Air Officer Commanding Aden. Understand latter was pro posing to discuss matter with Sultan on 21st January. 10. Sultan's points 8 &amp; 9. Air Ministry agree to continuance of present arrangements as far as facilities exist. Paragraph No.11. It will now be ? necessary for you to negoti ate with Sultan an agreement covering most of Royal Air Forceb requirements only. Financial terms will ofcourse have*&gt; have to be considered on new basis and I await your recommendations. His Majesty’s Government would hope that it would be possible to keep within over-all limit of 3,000/- pounds Sterling ( half 6,000/- ) including rent of buildings. Paragraph No.12. There is no objection to Americans using or developing any aerodromes in Muscat territory so far as His Majesty’s Government are concerned. Air Ministry would be prepared to permit using of Masirah and Salalah for Civil aircraft though they could not undertake making any special arrangements.

SUBJECT: MUSCAT AIR AGREEMENT81/71 * v&amp;) Telegram 3. (3). . From Political Resident, Bahrain. To India Office, London. Repeated Government of India, New Delhi No. 109. Dated the 28th January, 1947. IMPQHTii^T (To India Office only) Your telegram No* 1078, January 23rd. Muscat Air Agreement. 2. I cannot but regard it as a pity that we are abandoning the position with regard to civil aviation that we have acquired in Muscat, and I think the Sultan will be greatly disappointed at the latest development. He has given a great deal of time and consideration to draft agreement and I trust I may be permitted to convey His Majesty*s Government*s regrets to him for abandoning the whole proposal at the eleventh hour. 3. In the circumstances the sooner the British Overseas Airways Corporation withdraw the better. I have no doubt that the Sultan will claim to be paid at the war P subsidy rates up to the date of their withdrawal cf. y Appendix F to my express letter No. H72-3 y December 19th, 1946, and I ao not see how we can resist this claim. 4. With regard to Gwadur I am not clear what is intended by the phrase 'if necessary' in paragraph 2 of your telegram. May I tell the Sultan that the emergency landing facilities will be dispensed ith ? The only alternative is to reach some agreement with him regarding them. 6 Heference • • • •ho. 109 page 2 5. Reference paragraph 11 of your telegram. I cannot make any recommendations regarding financial terms until Sultan^ reactions have been obtained. If Royal Air Force are to have exclusive control of Masirah and balalah he may well expect to receive as much as was contemplated under the draft civil air agreement. 6. Reference paragraph 12. If Masirah and Salalah are to be used by civil aircraft Sultan will almost certainly insist on promulgating air navigation regulations and will make it condition of the use and maintenance of these aerodromes by Royal Air Force that they administer the regulations on his behalf. He will be averse to letting tne Royal Air Force retain the aerodromes if they are not willing to keep them open for civil aircraft. 7. The above are my main comments. I may have others to submit after examination of past records and of situation on spot. 8. I consider it desirable that Stewart should proceed to Dhofar as soon as possible to communicate His ''-^ooe/vwvi/vcwt 5 Majesty’s/decision to the Sultan and ascertain his reactions. Stewart will then be able to go into matters that require examination on the spot and will if possible arrange to meet the Air officer Commanding, Aden. I propose to visit Uhofar myself at a later stage for final discussions with Sultan and Stewart if necessary. 9. If you agree that Stewart should go to Dhofar at once would you kindly if possible arrange with Anglo Iranian Oil Company (cf. paragraph 16 of my express letter Wo. 1172 - S, December 19th, 1946), to send tanker to pick him up at Bahrain, take him to Muscat where he will collect clerks and records and then take him on to Dhofar. 10.

Note of a meeting held at the India Office at 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 21st January, 1947 Present : Mr. E.P. Donaldson (in the Oftair) Mr. M.W. Low ) ( Air Ministry) Mr. S.W. Warran ) Mr. E. Ratcliffe-Cou/lsins (Min. of C.A.) Mr. L. Petch (Treasury) f; r - f t ,! 7 H =?; pison &gt; (India Office) Mr. ri.J. Booth ) Mr. Donaldson referred to the three Express Letters recently received from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, giving an account of the negotiations with the ^ultan of Muscat as far as they had gone, and asked for comments on them. 2. Mr. Ratcliffe-Cousins said that the Ministry of Civil Aviation now had no requirements at all, since B.O.A.C. hdd , recently informed fchafen them that they could not forsee that they would need any facilities at all in Muscat territory and were ready to withdraw at 14 days' notice. There was there- fore ho need to proceed with the Civil Air Agreement as such. 3. Mr. Low .said that the R.A.F. requirements were unchanged. They wished to maintain airfields at SALALAH and MASIRAK on the present basis as an insurance against any cessation either r in peace or war of facilities on the Iraq route to the Far East. The exact scale on which the aerodromes would be maintained had not, however, yet been decided. They would require the &lt; majority of the American buildings at these airfields but not || the B.O.A.C. buildings. *hese latter could be handed over to | the Sultan, but as no surrender agreement had been made regarding || them it might be possible to obtain some quid nro quo., 4. On the minor points, Mr. Low said that A.O.C*. , Aden considered that there was no need to increase the number of Askars at Salalah, nor the number of points to be guarded. The A.O.C. would discuss rules of conduct personally with the Sultan. The R.A.F. would continue, as far as possible, the facilities regarding the carriage of mail and transmission of messages. 5. Mr. Petch said that there was no objection to the Sultan's purchasing arms from H.M.G. The Treasury would, however, be reluctant to release any dollars to the ^ultan unless this could not be avoided. With regard to the annual amount to be paid to the “'ultan, he thought that in view of the reduced facilities required, any authority given to the P.R. should, at the present stage at least, be limited to £3,000. The annual payment, when agreed, should be borne on the ^ir Ministry vote, seeing that the Ministry of ''ivil Aviation were no longer directly concerned, -‘-he Air Ministry and Ministry of Civil Aviation representatives agreed. 6. it v/as agreed that H.M.G. need have no objection to the development in Muscat territory of airfields by American interests. Mr Loh confirmed that there would be no objection to civil air craft of any nationality using the facilities, such as they were, at Salalah and Masirah, though no special arrangements could be made for them. 7. It was agreed that the India Office should pass the conclusions of the meeting to the Political Resident, subject to it being/'J i 5-; - 2 - to it being confirmed from the foreign Office that they would see no objection in principle to the Political Resident being instructed to negotiate for an agreement covering R.A.F. facilities only.

Reference your telegram No.254 dated 2' 7 th February. ^■s^raft agreement forwarded to India Office with your Express Letter No.1172-3 dated 19th December, 1946, was of an exclusive nature and was accepted by Sultan as basis for final consideration on assumption that we proposed to go ahead with development of c' : vil air route. As far as we are concerned civil air route has now become of secondary importance to R.^.F. require ments, we therefore propose to offer only minimum maintenance etc., limited re-fuelling and no repair facilities for civil aircraft. I hardly think that this will be acceptable to Sultan who. in spite of his friendship to the R.A.F. will naturally wish to see civil air route through Salalah and Nasi rah developed to fullest possible extent if not by us then by any non British competitor prepared to undertake it. 2 . In circumstances, and if insist on terms now suggested, I consider he will be most reluctant to grant excxusive •rights we ask for in present draft agreement without first consulting in any case possible competitors i.e. Americans, and that/extensive redrafting will be required. I therefore feel that best course is for me to go to Salalah, as early as possible, present Sultan with latest developments, redraft to the best of my ability in light oi his reactions and instructions received up-to-date then ask R..&amp;.F- to fly me to Bahrain for consultation with you, or alternatively, and this would save time, fly straight home and be present at any discussions India Office may institute. 3 .

Muscat air ..greement. 2. ikir Ministry now state that th§ir revised require ments are as follows: (a) the right to land aircraft in transit at Masirah and Salalah. (b) the right to maintain at each airfield a quan tity of stores ann equipment with which to service aircraft in transit. (c) the right to station at each airfield upto 500 R.ii F. personnel as permanent staff for purpose of providing for R.A.F. (I) servicing and refuelling facilities for • aircraft in transit.

(e) the right to maintain at eacl airfield a small communications flight of not more than 6 aircraft. (f) the right to station *iden Protectorate Levies for guarding purposes at Masirah. Above should be substituted for present paragraph I of Appendix D to your express letter of December 19th. With reference to (f) I understand Sultan told A.O.C. Aden on January 21st that he was unable himself to provide guards at Masirah. 3 . I presume that when Sultan is approached with these increased requirements he may not be satisfied with offer of poundssterling 6000/- previously authorised.-^. Were it not for compli- cation regarding buildings it would not be possible to say if Sultan asked for increased price, that our original requirements would stand, and we would negotiate again if and when increased requirements materialised. But it would probably be necessary, in order to accommodate numbers of personnel contemplated to retain use of virtually all R.A.F. and U.S.A. constructed buildings at Masirah and Salalah and in view of Sultan's expressed intention of dismantling those not required we must retain them in meantime. Negotiations must therefore proceed on basis of retaining all buildings at Salalah and Masirah. If Sultan presses for something like pounds sterling £200/- there will be no alternative but to accept, and you have authority to go upto this figure ? he said requirements can be obtained for less so much the better. In view however of uncertainty of future strategic requirements Air Ministry would like to include provision for review of agreement as regards number of buildings to be retained after 12 or 18 months. 4 . His Majesty's Government would like additional clauses inserted in Appendix D to cover use by R.A.F. of all air fields in Muscat territory including Gwadur, even though specific requirements at this stage relate only to occupation of Masirah and Salalah. This goes somewhat further than suggestion in paragraph No.2 of your telegram No.178 February 13th. 5. Reference paragraph 2 of your telegram No.260 of March 1st to A.O.C. Aden. Air Ministry would like to adhere to view that there is no necessity to increase numbejss of Askars at Salalah. 'r.

Sultan stipulates that until he . can provide his own doctor R.A.F. or civil shall carry out quarantine duties. 2. rtir Navigation Regulations. (a) Sultan wishes to make it clear that British air lines would have to apply for authorisation (annual for number of planes) the same as anyone else and pay same fees. He is not prepared at this stage to specify fee to be charged beyond that it would not be excessive. (b) Ke again asks for copy of Annex D and E of Convention referred to in Articles 8 and 9. (c) Alter word '’State 11 appearing in article 12 to read 'Sultanate'. (d) Article 13. He insists on deletion of additional words 'so far as applicable' (para 2 (ii) of your express letter N 0 .II 88 -S December 23rd 1946 refers). 3 . Schedule III General conditions. Article 7 (i.e. Formally article 17 of Adaptations forwarded with your Express Letter No.102-3 January 15th which have in accordance with para 4 of India Office telegram No.2609 February 26th been added to General Conditions and omitted from Regulations). Sultan insists on deletion of word 'reasonable' appearing between words 'all' and 'times'. 4 . Appendix G. Rides for Conduct and security. Sultan asks for alteration of Article 10 to read 'The Agent appointed to procure local food supplies including firewood should, as at present, be appointed by the Sultan.' 5. Air Officer Commanding agrees. Draft R.^.F. letter ^npendix DReference New para 1 (b). Sultan insists on insertion of word '•necessary' between words 'a' and 'quantity'. Para 1 (c). Sultan agrees to 500 but would like, if it can be done without serious embarrassment, number at Salalah to be reduced. Para 1 (d). Omit word 'temporarily'. Para 1 (f). No objection but required assurance strict discipline will be maintained and no mixing with local Arabs. Para 2 (d). Insert word 'present' between worda- 'outside' and 'limits'. *.fter word 'camps' add words 'as now defined and marked'. Para 3. Sultan insists on wording of original dr^ft 'A for words appearing after 'seven years'. Following are ne*w points raised by Sultan which I am discussing with Air Officer Commanding. (a) If numbers are to be increased as proposed reasonably senior officers should be in charge and they should also be provided with efficient interpreters. (b) Camp area in Salalah should for purposes of pro tection be enclosed in wire fence. (c) A fter expiry of agreement all permanent buildings will revert to Sultan free of charge. (d) Buildings will be maintained in reasonable condition by R.A.F. (e) Sultan insists that as long as Liasirah is maintained we will maintain at least minimum facilities at Salalah. (f) Numbers of R.A.F. per-sonnel visiting town and bazaar area at any one time shall be restricted. (g) In each case of seven years of agreement Sultan shall be supplied with 10,000 rounds of S.a.a. on payment. (h) As Masirah develops it will be necessary for His Highness to send representative for periodic inspection of island and R.a.F. should supply transport when possible. 7 . (a) If final agreement is reached regarding boundaries of aerodrome at Salalah and above conditions met S’ Ita will sign agreementfor pounds sterling 6000 all included. Tf payrient is to be ns.de expressed in terras of rent then Article 16 of Agreement (article 17 of appendix a) will have to be omitted and fresh sentence inserted in R.A.F. letter. Trust it may be left to my discretion to arrange this. (b) Officer Commanding suggests that it may '.&lt;ell be desirable to dev lop aerodromes at Ras al Hadd or Muscat, if this is so, I think there is suitable site within vicinity of Musest and if I a:a given discretion I think I could, if done now, get Sultan's agreement to examine site for possible development suggesting we do this ex-gratia for favours received at Salalah and tiasirah. If this is left till later we will have to pay. g. I am discussing Sultan's points mentioned in your appendix G and H together with Sultan's new points v/ith a. v Officer Comman .-1 and will send further communication. 9 . Sultan insists that the number of ^skars shall be 80. It also transpires that there a^e six now doing guard duty at place where cargo shipped, by sea is landed, making total of 86. There is much to be said in favour of Sultan's arguments and both Air Officer Commanding and myself agree that it would be adviseable to concede his points and approve 86 Askars to be increased if and when further duties are required. -- STUART --• *«•»•**&lt;* / 2 6641/PMEAS—8/43 TRUE COPY , R.A.F.

Telegrams containing 1 your views and recommendations should be addressed at Salalah( K&gt;( SECRE T. Ko.C.204-2/40. Dear Colonel Fay, POLITICAL AGENCY, MUSCAT, (camp) Salalah, Dated 21st March, 1947. A I arrived in Salalah on the 14th of March and commenced dis cussions with the Sultan on the basic of the drt.fts forwarded to the India Office with your Express Letter No. 1172-3, dated the 19th De cember, 1946, amended so as to incorporate additions and alterations proposed up to the receipt of India Office telegram No.3153, dated the 3th March, 1947. After five days of almost continuous discussions with the Sultan, he has agreed to accept the draft forma of agreement which I enclose with this letter. For facility of reference I attach Appendix 'A* showing (a) the amendments made from time to time in accordance with instructions received from you and tho India Office and (b) the amendments and additions insisted upon by the Sultan in our present discussions. I have disputed for many hours the amend ments proposed by the Sultan and the ones now incorporated in the draft attached are those on which I have not* teen able to persuade hire to give way. There were many other amendments he wished to make which he has finally conceded to me in our discussions. I do not feel that I should have any success in disputing the remaining points on which he now insists and in view of the fact that he is granting to us all our demands for pounds sterling 6000, I recommend that these amendments and the additiona^ssurances enumerated in para 2 below should be conceded. 2. The Sultan raised the following new points in our discussionsj (a) He wished assurances that if the numbers of Royal Mr Force personnel permanent and in transit are to be increased as proposed, there should always be reasonably senior officers in charge of the bases at Masirah and £alalah and that these officers should each be provided with an efficient interpreter. (b) He stipulated that the camp area in Salalah should for purpose of its own security bo enclosed in wire fence. (c) After the expiry of the agreement, all permanent buildings should revert to the Sultan free of charge. (d) Buildings will be maintained in reasonable condition by the Royal Air Force. (e) As long as Masirah is maintained, we will agree to main tain at least minimum facilities at Salalah. (f) Numbers of R.A.F. personnel visiting the town and basaar areas at any one time shall be restricted. (g) In each of the seven years of the agreement, the Sultan shall be supplied with 10,000 rounds S.A.A. on payment. (h) As Masirah develops, it will be necessary for the Sultan (both in his interest and ours) to send a representative for periodic inspection of the island. The Rqyal Air Force should whenever pos sible supply transport. (i) The Hon*ble Lt. Col. If.R. Hay, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, B&gt;JUUUL*-(i) All Royal Air Force stores etc., though exempt from payment of customs duty, should. In accordance with Article 5 (5) of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation, signed at Muscat on the 5th February, 1939, comply with customs formalities. 3. I was not able to obtain the Sultan's consent to a revision of the rents after 12 to 18 months in the light of the buildings actually required by us (vide paragraph 3 of India Office telegram No.3028, dated the 6 th March, 1947). Since, however, we have now obtained his agreement to grant to us not only all the buildings, but also our Increased requirements for the sum of pounds sterling 6000 only, which, you will remember, was the sum he originally de manded for our lesser requirements in addition to rents for the American bungalows, I have not felt it possible to pursue this point. The Sultan has moreover made it quite clear that if there is to be any re-negotiation after 12 or 18 months, it will be for the entire agreement. I trust you will agree that this point should be dropped. 4* Regarding the method of payment to be made. If the subsidy is to be regarded entirely in the light of payment for rents of buildings, it will be necessary to insert a new paragraph in the letter covering the Royal Air Force requirements and omit Article 16 in the Civil Air Agreement. The Sultan appears to be content to leave this to our discretion. I should accordingly be glad for instructions on this point. 5. I conveyed to the Sultan the conditions as laid down in para graph 2 of India Office telegram No.2609, dated the 26th February, 1947, under which we are prepared to operate the Civil Air Agreement. The Sultan took immediate objection to jqy use of the words , 'rainiraum ,, and ,, limited ,, (your telegram No.T/37, dated the 11th March, 1947, refers). I had in any case not put these conditions in writing, so did not press the point. I should be glad to be informed however whether these conditions should be made in writing, if so, I think they can without difficulty be incorporated in the separate letter covering the Sultan's points (Appendix 'H* of your Express Letter No.ll72-S, dated the 19th December, 1946). I think it should be borne in mind however that the Sultan will not agree to the Inclusion of the words 'rainiraunj' and 'limited'* nor do I, in fact, myself feel that they serve any useful purpose, since without precise definition, AW the use of such terms must always leave room for argument A. 6 . The Sultan (in view of para 2 (c) of the Royal Air Force letter, as amended) drove around the aerodrome with myself and the Air Officer Commanding in order to mark on a map the limits of what he considered to be the present boundaries of the aerodrome. It is apparent, that if the stage is ever rerched when there will be 500 Royal Air Force Personnel permanently stationed at Salalah together with 500 in transit, there must be fairly considerable new construction, the Air Officer Commanding and myself accordingly endeavoured to stretch these boundaries as widely as possible so as to leave room for new construction. We finally came to an agreement which would in the opinion of the Air Officer Commanding and nyself leave room within the limits of the aerodrome for all additional construction that we could at the present time foresee. Since to obtain extra land, which may,in fact, never actually be required, would only have resulted in an immediate Increase in the sum of pounds sterling 6000 demanded by the Sultan, we felt that no useful purpose would be served by pressing for wider-limits at this stage. If and when extra land is required, it can under Article 2 (d) of Royal Air Force letter be negotiated on payment of additional rent at the time.7* Regarding rules for the conduct and security of Royal ^ Air Force personnel (Appendix G of your Express Letter No.ll72-S, dated the 19th December, 1946), the Air Officer Commanding agrees to all the conditions including the new Article 10 which the Sultan requires to be amended to read as followst 'The Agent appointed to procure local food supplies including firewood should, as at present, be appointed by the Sultan.' 8 . Regarding the Sultan's points (Appendix 'H* of your Express Letter No.H72-S, dated the 19th December, 1946), the first point is settled since for the sum of pounds sterling 6000 we get all rights in all buildings. It is however open for consideration by us as to what proportion of the B.O.A.C. buildings apart from the beach camp, which is not included in the agreement, should be made available by the Rqyal Air Force for the use of civil airways and the civil airways superintendent. Point 2. This will, I think, have to be conceded. Points 3, 4, 5, 6 , 7, 8 , 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13, can without difficulty be conceded. Point 14* The Sultan merely wishes to stipulate that the graves of all Christians who may have the misfortune to die or be killed at Salalah shall be concentrated in one cemetery and not scattered about. Point 15. The Sultan drops this. Point 16. Provision has been made in the plan of the aerodrome for a single petrol dump. Points 17, 18, 19 and 20 are covered. Point 21. No longer arise. 9. It has been agreed vide India Office telegram No.1078, dated the 23rd January, 1947, that it shall be left to your discretion to draw up with the Air Officer Commanding rules for the conduct and security of Royal Air Force personnel. The Air Officer Commanding sees no objection to the rules proposed in your Appendix G, and I will draft for your approval a separate letter conveying our agree ment to these rules to the Sultan. 10. The Sultan also asks for a separate letter from you or from me conveying our agreement to his points mentioned in Appendix 'H* together with the new points now raised. 11. Regarding the number of Askars, it transpired that,in addition to the 80 the Sultan required for the camp, there are also 6 Askars employed as guards at Risut, the place where Royal Air Force land stores shipped by sea making a total of 86 in all. The Air Officer Commanding and myself discussed this question with the Sultan. I was personally of the opinion that there is much to be said in favour of the Sultan's arguments for an increase in the number from 60 to 80 and the Air Officer Commanding finally also agreed. 12. If the points now raised with new additions and amendments proposed by the Sultan are acceptable to His Majesty's Government, I see no reason why the agreement and letters should not be signed and the negotiations completed during your visit to Salalah between the 3rd and 6 th of April.13 . I an sanding this letter through the good offices of the Air Officer Commanding. It seems unlikely however that It can arrive at Bahrain before the 27th or 2dth of March. In order therefore to save time and to facilitate references you may have to make to the India Office, I am forwarding a copy together with Its enclosures direct to Donaldson. I am also forwarding to you but not to the India Office post copies of ay telegrams Issued from Salalah up to date, so thp.t any mutilations In transit of the originals can be corrected. chju - lj ?MUSCAT CIVIL AIR jflMBHBt* I* Heads of agreement between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Sultan of Muaost and Oman. 1.

Only fee charged by Egyptian Government appears to be one of ?_€£ piastres (equivalent of 13 shs. 4 d.) which is an annual registration fee for foreign aircraft intended presumably to cover clerical expenses. It is an authorisation and not collected for each flight. Possibly Sultan will drop idea of charging fee when he realises this out if he still insists position may be accepted. (c) Para 7. Sultan may be told under normal circumstances it is unlikely that garrison at Salalah \ will amount to 500. i , H / C v 1 (d) Para 8 . As regards point (c). Does Sultan mean that after seven years all buildings will become his property even if Agreement is then renewed or merely that buildings will become his property when */ Agreement is (5 groups omitted) will have to ? secure Sultan*s agreement to latter interpretation otherwise after seven years Sultan will be able to claim all buildings2 buildings erected and demand additional rent, (e) Para 10.

Firstly, regarding the provision of 10,000 TJ.S. collars the Cultan wanted this eolier credit to pur- ch se tr*nsport for the Levies end a tractor for agri cultural purposes* He has, however, agreed that, if it would seriously embarrass His ' r jesty^s Oovarn- ment to give him facilities to obtain the dollars, he will, provided he Is riven priority, buy Briuish. I presume this *111 be more acceptable to His Hf josty»s Govornment ana should be rateful if I could be pro vided with price-lists and catalogues of 50 cwt. and 5 ton British made troop-carryin; lorries ana also of agricultural tractors. 5. Secondly, regarding the supply of arms and ammunition agreed to in paragraph (19) of my letter No.C.fcl4~^/40 dated the 5th April, 1947, to the Sultan.

( /iW Among business items the Sultan raentions~*that he has quite a number of matters to discuss with me in connection with the recent c.icinges in India and their effects on him and the State. In connection with the Air Agreement he' mentions that he has received his Statement of Accounts up to the 31st October 1947 from Lloyds Bank Limited, London, and no credit is so far shown from His Majesty*s Government for rent ^ S 97 although he has received the telegram from me saying that the first payment has been made into the Bank. He asks that I should look into ^ \rUU this matter. I am doing so and will write to you officially. He also urges once again that steps should be taken soon to appoint a Senior Royal Air rorce Commanding Officer for Salalah and a reliable interpreter in accordance with our Agreement. I have had previous reminders from him about this, which I have passed on to the Air Officer Commanding Aden and so far no action seems to have been taken, and I am telegraphing him he also asxs whether any steps have been taken to despatch the arms and Yours sincerely, A.C.Stewart• rsecret D.O.

The Sultan has again written to me suggesting that misunder standings are once more cropping up between himself and the Officer commanding, and reminding me of our promise that the Station should be under the command of a reasonably Senior Officer who would have the assistance of a proper interpreter. He stresses that he attaches great importance to this as a means of putting a stop to the many little misunderstandings which arise when ^Station is under the charge of a young officer with no proper understanding of the habits and customs of the country in which he serves. 3* On reference to ny records I find that we did promise the Sultan that 'if the numbers of the Royal Air Force were to be increased a a proposed, reasonably Senior Officers should be put in charge and that they should also be provided with efficient interpreters' (please see paragraph 6 (a) of ay telegram C.142 dated the 18th Ifarch 1947 to the Political Resident read with paragraph 6 of my telegram No. C. 1 4 3 dated the 19th March to the Political Resident both copied to you under ny D.O.

So far as i am aware, however, the Political Agent has not been specified as the authority to exercise this right on behalf of His M a j es ty» s Government and as a result of the experience of the past few months, i am inclined to the opinion that his doing so leads to unnecessary delays, expense, and confusion, since it is the Royal Air Force who are responsible for operating the aerodrome, and only they are in possession of the latest information regarding its operational fitness, and facilities available for refuelling, feeding, accommodation etc. on the whole therefore X feel that we could appropriately suggest that the Air Officer Commanding Aden should exercise the authority granted to His Majesty*s Government under Article 4 of the Agreement rather than the Political Agent though perhaps it may bo desirable to stipulate that he shall inform the political Agent of all authorisations so granted or rejected. 3.

Dear Harrison, Your letter Ext.3001/47 of January 1st'to Ratcliffe Cousins about 'authorisation fees' charged by the Egyptians and elsewhere has only just been passed to me for reply. I much regret the delay. ' I think the best thing is to give you some idea of recent developments with regard to,those fees - ' and to the best of our knowledge Egypt is the only State still to make such a charge. As you know, the Egyptians used to charge a fee of £1.13«.4 for the issue of a permit for non-scheduled aircraft (not for the regular airlines) on every occasion when they wished- to visit Egypt. The final sentence of Article 15 of the Chicago Convention prohibits such a fee solely in respect of the right of transit over, entry into or exit from'the territory of a contracting State, and partly as a result of our representations, the Egyptians abolished the require ment for a permit, and consequently the fee, where non traffic flights were concerned. I attach three copies of Egyptian Notice to Airmen No.9A of October, 1947 announcing this step in the right direction. I Now, although the Egyptians are strictly entitled under Article 5 of the Convention to levy such a fee when the flight is for traffic purposes, as a regulation, condition or limitation', this is contrary to the spirit of I.C.A.O., which is aiming at removing all hindrances of the kind to free International flying. Ceeing therefore that the Egyptians are apparently the only people to levy such a charge even for traffic flights, we have instructed our representative in Cairo to press for its abolition, as being contrary to the spirit of the Convention and out of step with practice in other member States. Our latest information from him leads us to believe that the Egyptians agree that they are wrong to make such a charge and are on the point of issuing instruc tions to their Consulates abroad to cease levying charges on all entry permits, though this has not yet*been done/ will therefore presumably agree that the Political Resident should be informed of these facts, and you may think that in the circumstances it would be a retro grade step if the Sultan of Muscat were to be encouraged to make any charge for 'authorisation' or 'permission' to fly to or through his territory. If there is any other information you require, please do not hesitate to let me know. v F.A.K. Harrison, Esq., Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, London, S.W.l. Yours sincerely, (SOD.)

I explained that at the raoraent the sole Sovernraent to charge such fees v/as the Egyptian Government and that even they now admitted that such charges were against the principles of the International Air Convention and it was thought likely that they would abandon the charge. The Sultan pointed out that he was not a signatory of the International Air Convention and so its terms did not apply to him. He seemed, however, to view the proppect of giving up such charges reasonably and in any case no rate has yet been fixed by him, nor have ary' authorisation fees been claimed. It is for consideration whether we should let matters rest until an actual claim is made. On the whole I am in favour of letting matters rest as I don’t think that in any case the Sultan would fix an authorisation fee without first consulting the Political .agent who could then take up the argument again. ltd. ’’A.C.S.” 28th larch 1948.GO:^I!JIiTIAL L.O.No.G/13.

OFFICE OF THE POLITICAL RESIDENT, PERSIAN GULF, Camp, MUSCAT, the 7th April 1S48. Reference to previous correspondence: i DESCRIPTION OF ENCLOSURE Demi-official letter No.C/10 dotdd . 4th April 1948, from the Uon'ble Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE., CSI., to Mr. I3.A.B. Burrows of the Foreign Office. Subject: Charging of Authorisation Fees by the Sultan of Muscat. NPGD.O.No.C/lO. OFFICE OF THE POLITICAL RESIDENT PERSIAN GULF, Camp, MUSCAT, the 4th April 1948 Please refer to Harrison's demi-official letter No.598/48 dated the 6th,March 1948 about the charging of 'authorisation fees' by the Sultan of Muscat. 2. Stewart has approached the Sultan and reports A ♦ as follows 'I explained that at the moment the sole Government to charge such fees was the Egyptian Government and that even they now admitted that such charges were against the principles of the International Air Convention and it was thought likely that they would abandon the charge. The Sultan pointed out that he was not a signatory of the International Air Convention and so its terms did not apply to him. He seemed, however, to view the prospect of giving up such charges reasonably and in any* case no rate has yet been fixed by him, nor havfc any authorisation fees been claimed 3. In the light of the above it appears that the Sultan may drop the idea of charging authorisation fees. Should he revert to it we will make further efforts to dissuade him. (SOD.) V .R.HAY. B. A. B.
