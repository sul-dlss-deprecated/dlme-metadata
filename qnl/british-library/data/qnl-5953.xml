THE YEAR BY COLONEL H.R,P.DICKSON. 195S . / • The Principality of Kuwait is an independent Arab State under a virtual British protection. It has a distinctive flag d&gt;f its own: red, with the word 'Kuwait' in Arabic characters in white across it. The State war cries (Nakhwa) are 'Ana akhu Mariam” and 'Ana akhu Salim' - the former from a famous ancestress of A1 Subah who rule# the State for a short period. Boundaries . The question of the status and territory of the Shaikh of Kuwait was the subject of negotations between His Majesty’s Government and the Sublime Porte in 1913, as result of which the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 29th July 1913 was signed but never ratified. By this agreement the autonomy of the Shaikh of Kuwait was recognised in an area, the boundary of which formed a semi-rcircle with the town of Kuwait as centre and the Khaur az-Subair on its radius to the north and Qurain to the south, together with the islands of 'Jarbah, Bubiyan, Maskan, Failakah, ’Auhah, Kubbar Qaru, Maqta’ and Umm al-Karadim, and other adjacent islets. It was further recognised that the Shaikh of Kuwait was the tribal overlord, and entitled to levy tribute, within a larger area, the boundary of which started from the south side of the Khaur az-Subair at its junction with the Thaur ’Abdullah and passed just to the south of Umm Qasr, Safwan and Jabal Sanam and on to the Batin; it then turned south west and followed the Batin to Hafar al-Batin; it then turned south-east, and included the wells of Safah, Qar’ah Habah and Wabrah, and the village of Anta’, and joined the sea at Jabal Manifah. This Anglo-Turkish Agreement, however., as stated above, was never ratified. During the rule of Shaikh Salim, the question of the boundary between his territory and that of Ibn Saud became very acute, and resulted in the surprisejand defeat of the Kuwait tribesmen atat Hamdh near Jaryah, or Qaryah as it should really be pronounced, in April 1920, and the battle of Jahrah in October of the same year. The question first arose in January 1919, when Shaikh Salim wanted to build a fort at Dauhat Balbul, just north of Jabal Manifah, to which Ibn Sa’ud objected, and claimed that it was within his terri tory, Nothing happened until April 1920, when Ibn Shuqair started to build the Ikhwan village of Jaryah, but from then onwardsthe relations between Shaikh Salim and Ibn Sa f ud went from bad to worse. During the summer of 1920 both parties applied for British arbitration, and both were asked to state exactly what territory they claimed. Ibn Sa'ud replied that he claimed the whole country up to the walls of Kuwait; and Shaikh Salim claimed a frontier similar to the outer line of the Anglo-Turkish agreement. The High Commissioner for ’Iraq then invited Ibn Sa’ud to Basra with a view to settling the dispute, but Ibn Sa’ud replied that he was unable to come at the time. In January 1921 the Shaikh of Mohammerah offered to send his son, Shaikh Chasib, accompanied by Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir of Kuwait, to Nejd, to try and arrange a truce between Ibn Sa’ud and Shaikh Salim. His offer was accepted, and the mission left for Bahrain en route for Nejd in February, and reached Ibn Sa’ud’s camp to the north of Riyadh on the 2nd March. Two days later the news of Shaikh Salim’s death reached them, and Ibn Sa’ud at once said that there was no longer any quarrel to settle, or any need for a boundary between his territory and that of Kuwait. Ibn Sa’udfcx had already been told that His Majesty’s Government recognised the territory within the inner boundary of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement as definitely belonging to Kuwait. Nothing more happened regarding the frontier until November 1922, when at a conference held at ’Uqair between Sir Percy Cox and Ibn Sa’ud, at which the Political Agent was also present, the question of a frontier between Kuwait and Nejd came up for£ for discussion. It was recognised at once that the power of Ibn Subah (to give the Shaikh of Kuwait his desert title) was much less in the desert than it had been when the Anglo- Turkish Agreement was drawn up, and an Agreement was even tually arrived at by which the frontier starts from the junction of the Vadi al-Aujah with the Batin on the west. From this point, leaving tiqa T i to Najd, it runs in a straight line to the junction of the 29th parallel of lati tude with the red semi-circle on the map attached to the draft Anglo-Turkish Agreement, and then follows the red semi-circle to the sea. The above forms the southern boundary of the recignised territory of Kuwait, but the tract of country bounded on the north by the above line, on the west by Shaqq, on the east by the sea, and on the south by a straight line running eastwards from the Shaqq in the west, through f Ain al- f Abd, to the sea north of the Has al Mish'ab, is recognised as common to the two States of Najd and Kuwait, in which both enjoy equal rights. This is known today as the 'Kuwait Neutral Zone'. In April 1923 the Shaikh of Kuwait was informed that His Majesty T s Government recognised the other frontiers claimed by him. The frontiers of Kuwait are accordingly as shown on the attached map. ADM.I-^ISTRaTION . Kuwait was founded about rhe begii^ing of the eighteenth century by some settleirs of the ^tub, a sept of the ’Anizah, over whom the Subah family enjoyed predominance. It is unnecessary to consider its early history. Suffice it to say that in May 1896 Shaikh Mubarak became Huler of Kuwait on the assassination of his brother. It was he who raised Kuwait from a place of little importance to a flourishing principality. Under his strong rule it became a most attractive place to live in to the Arab mind, and the population of the town nearly doubled itself. It would be difficult to speak too highly in praise of his devotion to the British Government.Shaikh Mubarak died in November 1915, and was succeeded by his eldest son Shaikh Jabir, a debonair and pleasant man, whose..toi*. ’i'O .-1 .&gt; ~cy: t o .

I j.ntd ' ;* : f )X84 whose mildness and affability made him a popular ruler.Shaikh Salim, another son of Shaikh Mubarak succeeded on his brother’s death in February 1917. He was very different type of man from his easy going brother, being a stern Muhammadan and a very obstinate man. He had spent nearly all his life in the desurt before he came to the throne and hated all modern inventions. He was almost entirely to blame for his quarrel all with Ibn Saud and/the sorrow that it brought to Kuwait, and in short he did nearly as much harm to the State, as his father had done good. He died suddenly on the 23rd February 1921 to the undisguised jo£ of nearly all his subjects. It had always been the custom for Shaikhs of Kuwait to rule personally and autocratically, and to avoid all delegation of authority. In the town it was their usage to give audience for an hour or two each morning in the market place, and decide cases by direct judgment. On the death of Shaikh Salim, however, the townspeople, tired of the unnecessary war with Ibn Saud which he had led them into against their will, determined that in future they would have some say in the a fairs of the State, informed the members of the Subah family that they would only accept as their Ruler one who would accept a council of advisers. S haikh Ahmed , eldest son of the late Shaikh Jabinp was chosen as Ruler, and on his return from Nejd an Agreement was drawn up between him and the people of Kuwait to the effect that all criminal cases would be decided in accordance with the Shar’ or Religious Law; that in case of appeal, the written statements of both parties and the Oadhi’s judgment would be submitted to the ’ Ulama , whose decision would be final; that if both parties in a dispute agreed beforehand for a third party to arbitrate between them, his decision should hold; that the Ruler would seek advice in all matters ▼ external as well as internal - which affected the town; and that if any one had any suggestion to make for the benefit of the town or people, he would lay it before the Ruler, who would consult his people, and adppt it if they so advised. A council ofof twelve members was duly elected - six from the eastern half of the town, and six from the western - under the presidency of one of the leading merchants, Hamad bin ♦Abdullah as-Saqar. Since the early days of its election however, this council has hever met, and in practice Shaikh Ahmad rules in ipfc^h the same manner as his predecessors. He is a mild and pleasant man of much the same type as his father. His bluff, jovial manners make him an eminently suitable person for his position in so far as the cereminial part of his duties are concerned. Unfor tunately however, he has no strength of character, and is a lamentably weak Ruler. He is a right.minded nan, and would normally like to do the right thing, but is easily swayed by his advisers - who are not always of the most desirable type. Like many weak men, he can atbtimes be very o^bstinate. Although greatly desiring popularity, he is not very popular amongst his subjects, amongst whom he has the reputation of being mean. He is a strict muslim and is x zealous in the enforcement of the prohibition against liquor, and also in the suppression of prosti tution. He himself is a non smoker. He is unquestionably well disposed towards the British, and is very fond of entertaining in British style. He has a suite of rooms furnished like a Suropean house, and is fond of cinema tographs, cameras, cars, and other modern ipvqntions. He frequently drives his own car. Shaikh Hamad al-Mubarak t the Shaikh’s Uncle, officiates for him whenever he leaves Kuwait. He is nine years younger than his nephew, being thirty three years of age. His mother belonged to the Ajnan tribe. He is a quiet, shy man, with no great intelligance, and no strength of character. s haikh Abdullah as-Salim, was born in 1895. He is by far the strongest in character and most intelligent member of the Subah family. He is a well read man and can converseconverse on many more subjects thai the average man of his class* He is his cousin’s only really dangerous rival. He is certainly an ambitious man and there is little doubt that he had strong hopes of succeeding his father on his death in 1921 notwithstanding the fact that he is Shaikh Ahmad’s junior by Itara ten years. V/hen Shaikh Ahmad was chosen as Ruler, Shaikh Abdullah as-Salim started to 'assist” him, and soon got a good deal of power into his own ha^nds, which Ahmad with his easy going nature allowed him to do. He soon started issuing orders not as the Ruler’s deputy, but in his own name, and it looked very much as if he were going to become the virtual ruler of Kuwait, and Shaikh Ahmad to remain a mere figurehead - if that. After about two months, however, he overstepped the mark, by tyring to introduce a sort of 'civil list' with fixed salaries for all the members of the Subah family including Shaikh Ahmad. According to the scale which he drafted he himself was to get'^almost as much as Shaikh Ahmad, and far more than any of the others. This produced a very stormy scene between ’Abdullah and the rest of the family, at which Shaikh Jabir as-Subah, Mubarak’s brother, who has since died, did some very plain speaking, and Shaikh Abdullah went into retirement, and did not appear in public again for some time. Shaikh ’Abdullah as-Salim next came into pro minence in Kay 1923. Ibn Saud had sent one Saiyid Hamzah al-Ghauth to Kuwait to represent him at a Conference at which it was hoped to come to an understanding regarding the vexed question of the Najd Customs with a view to the re opening of trade between Najd and Kuwait. The negotiations proved entirely abortive and Saiyid Hamzah left Kuwait for Riyadh dm the 19th May. He was accompanied, however, by Shaikh Abdullah as-Salim as representative of Shaikh Ahmad, who had written to Ibn Saud that he saw no hope of comingcoming to an agreement on the terms proposed by Saiyid Hamzah, so he had decided to let him return, and send a deputation of his own, headed by his cousin.Shaikh Abdullah returned to Kuwait on 27th June, and it became known thati he had come to a private understanding with Ibn Saud by which the latter was to recognise him as his Agent in Kuwait with whom a^one he would correspond, and was to allow trade between Najd and Kuwait to be reopened in return for the whole of the customs dues on exports from Kuwait by land (other than those for Kuwait subjects or for (Iraq ), which Shaikh ’Abdullah was to collect and remit to him* Shaikh ’Abdullah at first urged Shaiikh Ahmad to settle the matter himself without consulting his people at all, but he refused to do this, and several meetings were held. Shaikh Abdullah nearly succeeded in persuading the people to take up his plan, and urge ita Shaikh Ahmad to agree to it, but some stood out firmly against it. Shaikh Ahmad, after vacillating for several days, finally wrote to Ibn Saud rejecting his terms. Since then Shaikh ’Abdullah as-Salim has kept quiet, and spends most of his time at Itas his house at Sha’b outside the town. The only other members of the Subah worth noting are Shaikh Salman al-Hamud . who is rather a distinguished looking man of forty six. T v ere is nothing in him, however, and he drinks. His father was a younger brother of Shaikh Mubarak. Shaikh Ali Al-Khalifah . a grandson of Shaikh ’Abdullah who was Ruler from 1886 to 1892, is a fat, cheery man of 44 who wears ringlets like a Bedouin and lives largely in the desert. He is the chief commander of the Kuwait forces in war, and the recognised expert on all things military. He is noted for his enormous appetite. Outside the Subah family the people who have the most influence over the Shaikh are:-to V M * H Khan B&amp;hadur Mu11a Salih , his chief Secretary, who is a foxy, intriguing little man, with plenty of brains. Jassim al Yacub . Father of the Director of Customs, and Comptroller of the Shaikh’s Household. ’Abdul Aziz as Salim , his agent in Basrah, where he normally lives. This man is a born intriguer, and it is common knowledge in Kuwait that he used to work - if he does not still do so - in Shaikh Abdullah’s interests against Shaikh Ahmad. The above three individuals are actually in the Shaikh’s employ. The following are influential notables Saiyid Hamid Bey an-Naqib . a son of the late Naqib of Basrah and thr brother of the famous Saiyid Talib Pasha. He lives partly in Basrah and partly in Kuwait and owns property in both places. Unlike his brother he is not particularly keen on politics, and, despite his high birth, he does not despise business. To him belongs the credit of making the motor road from Kuwait to Zubair, and of forming the Kuwait - Iraq Motor Transport Company. He is also the Ford Agent in Kuwait. He is a well educa ted man with charming manners, and I am sure that what influence he has is for good. He represents Basrah in the Iraq Parliament and would like to see Kuwait absorbed into Iraq. Hilal al-Kutairi is the leading pearl merchant of Kuwait. Born and brought up in the desert with his tribe, he was fortunate at pearl diving when a young man, settled in the town, and is by far the richest man in the place. He is still a Bedouin at heart: he has a very fine house, but I do not believe there is a chair in it - his reception rooms being furnished with rich carpets, cushions and camel-saddles alone. At the time of recent revival when the Mutair became Ikhwan he wavered for some time as to whether to join the movement himself or not, and got so far as to discard his head-rope and bind his kerchief X withwith a turban instead (the outward emblem of the Ikhwan). He soon made up his mind, however, and went back to the head-rope. Still he is very strict, and strongly dis approves of smoking, etc. He has never lost touch with his tribe, and no Mutairi ever comes to Kuwait without going to his house. He is consequently very well informed regarding the desert. He is an elderly man and his views are somewhat old fashioned, but on the whole his influence is for good. Shamlan al-Ali is the second largest pearl merchant in Kuwait, and is closely associated with Hilal al-Kutairi. Like him he has great influence. He took a very strong line in opposing Shaikh Abdullah as-Salim’s Customs scheme in June 1923 - in fact, but for him it is probable that Shaikh Abdullah would have got his way, and Shaikh Ahmad been forced to agree to Ibn Saud’s terms. Hamad al-Khalid is a dour, but kindly old man of old- fashioned views and T Anaze stock. During the war he started to lead the Pro-Turk party - until Shaikh Mubarak made it clear that there was to be no Pro-Tiirk party in now Kuwait. There is/nothing anti-British about him.. Shaikh Yusuf bin T Isa is a schoolmaster and intriguer who is mixed up with every underhand plot in Kuwait. There are of course many others who are in a position to influence the Shaikh but the above are the most important. One other man, not a Kuwaiti subject, whose character is worth considering is Abdullah an-Nafisi. Abdullah an-Nafisi is Ibn Saud's Agent in Kuwait. He is a pleasant and tactful man, who is liked by every one in the place.Though Agent to the Wahabi King he is one of the heaviest smokers I have seen. Note. It is of interest to note here that the present Sau'di Minister in London H.E. Shaikh Hafidh 7/ahba for some years lived in Kuwait, and worked as a Schoolmaster. He had the reputation, wrongly imputed to him I think, of f j, _ having been rabidly anti-English at one time, and is said.said to have been deported to India during the war. To his great credit, be it said, he worked himself into the confidence of his present Master His Majesty King Abdul Aziz as Saud, and through sheer grit and deter mination, in face of untold difficulties attained to the honourable position he now holds.ORIGIN 0j 1 TH2 NA1.IE POT./AIT AND POSITION. The name 'KUWAIT” is the diminutive of Kut ^ , and means a small fort; it sufficiently indicates the insigni ficant origin of the thriving town of Kuwait, the capital of the Arab Shaikhdom or principality which now shares its name. In old English records and books Kuwait is generally called 'Graine' ob 'Grane', doubtless from the island of QURAIN, a short distance to the west of it. The town, which is about 80 miles south and slightly east of Basra almost 180 miles west by north of BUSHEHR and nearly 230 miles north-north-west of BAHRAIN, faces the north-west and is situated on the southern shore of Kuwait Bay about one third of the way from its entrance at Ras-al-Ardh to its foot at Jahrah, CO^ST t HAHBQUR AND AL'TC.TCRAGE'5 . The Bay itself is a large inlet of remarkable form, £ ea cling out of the north-west comer of the Persian Gulf, with an extreme length east and west of about 10 miles. In shape it approaches a crescent with the convex side to the north and one of the hrons point ing o the south-west. The Bay proper is an indentation in the true Arabian coast line,which is represented northwards by the western shore of Khor as Sabiyah and southv.ards by the coast below Ras-al-Ardh; but its shore line is prolonged on the side next the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab by a mud flat, extending 20 miles south-east from the mouth of Khor- as-Sabiyah,on which stands the island of Failakah. The entrance of the bay, between this mud flat and Ras-al-Ardh, is about 4 miles wide and open to the south-west and south- south-west. In the southern shore of the bay,within, are three coves; the eastermost,between Ras-al-Ardh and Ras- Ajuzaho i/Xu-V'is shallow and vessels are recom ended not to enter it;the eastern portion of this is known as Bandar- ash-Sha T b and the western as Bunai d-a 1- far possibly a corruption of Bunaidir-a 1 -GazThe middle cove, between Has ’AjuzahV &gt; Ras 'Ajuzah and Ras -Ushairij , contains Kuwait Town on its eastern side, a dead coral reef covered with mud and sand knov/n as T Akaz ^ &gt; or simply Jazirah, in the centre, the island of Qurain or Shuwaikh on the southern margin of 'Akaz, ani the island of Umm-an-Namal near Has ’Ushairij* The westermost cove, Dohat x.adhamah between Ras ’Ushairij and Ras Kadhamah, forms the innermost recess of the whole bay, and near the foot of tt stands the vil lage of Jahrah. The land surrounding the bay is low except on the north side where the Zor hills, parallel to the shore, attain a height of 150 to 400 feet* A flat of soft mud extends for some distance off shore on the northernside of the bay, making communication difficult at low water between sea and land* In most parts of the bay the water is of suitable depth for anchorage and there is good holding ground, the soundings are 14 fathoms off Ras-al-Ardh and 6 to 10 off Ras ’Ajuzah, shoaling to 6 fathoms at the entrance of Dohat Kadhamah. There is a rocky 2 -fathom shoal, called Fasht-al-HadibahW'^ &gt; 2 * miles nortl1 of the anchorage for large vessels, which is marked by nuoys, is called Bandar Tuwainah ; it lies a mile and half to the north of the town inside the Fasht-a-Hadibah. In a Shansi a considerable sea rises in the southern part of the bay, not enough however to distress a large vessel; but in Qaus vessels anchoring outside the Hadibah shoal, or with the town south by west to south-south-west, might not be sufficiently sheltered. Shoal water extends off the town of Kuwait for about 8 cables, and landing at low tide is inconvenient as the beach dries out to a considerable distance; but at high water the sea washes up almost to the houses. In front of the town are a number of tidal har bours, called lliq’ahs of considerable size, formed of loose coral by piers and breakwaters or ^ursmm— coral blocks; these are often breached in a shamal, but are easily repaired. :ixcept for a few which are loept at Bandar Ash-Shuwaikh, the large ocean going sailing vessels are laid up inside these Niq'ahs during the summer months, when the monsoon renders it unsafe for them to go outside the Persian Gulf. On the beach lie in winter, drawn up above the hi^i water line, many of the pearling and other vessels on which the prosperity of the town depends; in places these extend, almost touching each others sides, for hundreds of yeards, and if all were launched together they would form a most imposing fleet. The boat harbour of Bandar-ash-Shuwaikh is described in the article on Qurain Island, and the bay and promontory of 1 adhymah are dealt with in the article under their own name. There is a beacon on Ras-al-Ardh on which a white light is maintained at night. A white light is also maintained on Ras f Ajuzah, and a red li$it, on the mast in front of the Political Agency. The Twon and Its Surroundings. The town now measures about three miles along the shore, having extended considerably in recent years towards Ras Ajuzah. Its greatest depth, about one mile, is near the centre of the town, where the long suburb called Murqab has grown out frcan it towards the south-east. On Ras Ajuzah is a dwelling house erected by the late Shaikh Jabir bin Mubarak and named 'Dasman', which is used by the present Shaikh of Kuwait as a summer residence. A light is maintained on the roof of this building for the benefit of vessels making for Kuwait during the ni^it. Slightly to the west of this Vj are too large houses belonging to the ex-Shaikh of Koham- merah, which form a conspicuous landmark. Nearly mile further south-west is the Political Agency, and Annexe, in the compound of which are also situated the post and telegraph and Charitable Dispensary. About half a mile beyond the Political Agency is the Shaikh's alc.ce, ana „ u,tit just beyond it, the Customs House. Here is the entrance to the main bazaar, at the southern extremity of 'hie.., end to the west of the Murqab quarter, is the large open ra&lt;. 1 &gt; .t place known as the Sufat £ . Continuing along the sea front a short distance from the Customs House one comes to the office of the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, and a little way beyond that is the newly opened school called tbe ttadrasat-al-Ahmdiyah^'-u^^ the western ex tremity of the town are the hospital and dwelling houses of the American 'Arabian Mission'. The site o^ the town is generally flat and sandy; but the south-western quarter stands on somewhat higher ground, and has steep lanes run ning down from it to the beach. The streets are irregular and winding, and the town is not laid out on any general plan. The only street of much importance, besides the main bazaar which runs at right angles to the sea from the Shaikh’s Palace, is one which leads from the Sufat to the north-east end of the town, but it has no general name. Most of the houses have only a ground floor, but appear higher owing to a parapet-wall enclosing the roof; they are gem rally built surrounding a courtyard. The better sort are of stone plastered with Juss ^ , and have high arched gateways; a few arches appear also in upper stories. The system of conservancy is rudimentary, though of late years this has greatly improved, due to the energy of a strong Municipal Cormittee. There are over forty mosques of which nine are Jamii^ or Friday congregational mosques these are the chief mosque or Mas jid. as Suq, which stands on the west side of the main bazaar, the Masjid-al- Adsani a little to the west of it, the Masjid Hilal ^ and the i^asjid Salih Fudhalah^jU^^ * ♦ » in the Llurqab quarter, the Masjid-an-Nusf * a little to the east of the Political Agency, the Shaikh’s mosque or Masjid-al-Khalifah ^ on the sea front i near his residence, and the Masjid-O' the Hasjid-al-Badr in the western portion of the town* A tenth, the Hasjid Darwazat-al-Jahrah, is probably going to be converted into a Jami , . Kuwait was originally a walled town, and is said to have had seven gates on the landward side in 1874, but since that time it has more than doubled its size and the sites of the old gates are now known to very few; of one only, the Darwazat Jana’at &gt; which was the second in order from the east, do any traces remain. For many years Kuwait remained an open, undefended town, but in 1920 a new wall was built by the late Shaikh Salim. The present wall is a litt&amp; over four miles in length. Form Has ’Ajuzah it runs approximately south west for two and half miles, then west by south for a lit tle over a mile, and then west by north to the sea, which it joins a quarter of a mile beyond the property of the American Mission. The wall originally left the sea at Bas Ajuza itself, but, as the foreshore there is very shelving and an enemy could have worked round it at low tide at a considerable distance from it, a subsidiary wall was built afterwards, running roughly east and west from from the Bunaid-al-Qar creek. There are three gates p the Dawazat-al-Burai’ ■&gt; leading to Hawaii, Dimnah, nriri the coastal villages of the Adan district, the DaiWzat Naif,!^^^ ,also called the Tarwazat-ash- Shamiyah &gt; on the main roed to Ne «) d &gt; ^ the Dawazat-al-Jahrah leading to Jahrah. The wall is loop- holed for rifle fire throughout its length, but the loop holes are so small and so badly constructed that only a very limited field of fire can be obtained. In addi tion to the three gates which are protected by towers, Mulla from the Sufat to the there is a round shaped Bastion or Qulab^as it is called about every two hundred yards throu^iout the length ofof the wall. The land surrounding Kuwait is pure desert as far as the eye can reach, and belongs to the tract called Qara f ah* To the south of the town the land rises for a mile or so and then falls, consequently the place is lost sight of soon after leaving it. On this side in the './inter are pitched many Bedouin camps, and there is a cons tant coming and going of camels and small caravans through the Darwazat Naif. There is a landing ground for aeroplanes just outside the wall, immediately to the east of the Dar wazat al Burai’isi. Between the Darwazat-al-Burai T isi and the Darwazat-al-Jahrah on both sides of the wall is the gypsiferibus tract where Juss or gypsum mortar is manufactured by simply firing rubbish in broad shallow excavations. About a quarter of a mile to the nouth-west of the Darwazat- al-Jahrah is the Christian Cemetery, the ground for which was presented to the British Covemment by the late Shaikh Mubarak in 1913. The V/ireless Buildings, which with the con struction of a land line were never used as such, are on the sea front half a mile outside the town, and from a con spicuous landmark. Climate; The climate of Kuwait compares most favourably with that of the other ports of the Persian Gulf and of most parts of Mesopotamia. In winter, especially when a Shamal is blowing, it is sometimes bitterly cold and in January 1911 the thermometer fe&amp;l to 24°7 F. In Summer the heat of the sun is tempered by sea breeze and the clean sand desert cools down rapidly at ni^it; the highest tem perature that has been recorded was 122 F. in 1909. The average maximum and minimum temperatures are 114.F. and 35.F. respectively. The average rainfall is slightly under 5 inches. Inhabitants. The population of Kuwait is now a little over 50,000, of whom the great majority are Arabs of the UTUB,Awazim, Rashaidah, Bani Khalid, Dawasir, Ajraan, Anizah and Dhafir tribes, besides Basawiyah or Arabs from Hasa, and Baharinah from Afe Bahrain. There are also a large number of Persians, some Jana f at, some Jews and many negroes; also one Christian family, a dozen Indians and one Sabian. The Utub are the tribe to whidi the Shaikh of Kuwait belong but they do not compreMise a very large number of families The resident Bani Khalid belong, in part at least to the Mahashir, Al Miqdam and Bani Nahad sections of that tribe. More than a hundred Arab households in the town are immi grants from Zilfi in Nejd. The Persian community, which has increased enormously in recent years, now consists of about 10,000 souls. Even those who are permanently settled in Kuwait go and come freely between Kuwait and the parts of Persia to which they originally belonged. There are over a score of Persian merchants and many shop keepers, but the great majority are employed as labourers. The water carry ing trade frcm the water boats to the house is almost en tirely in their hands. The Jana T at are a small colony of under 200 souls; some are merchants, the others sailors and boatmen. Many of the better class families of Kuwait will not givj/e their daughters in marriage to them. The Jewu number 161 souls; they have a synagogue of their own, called a Kanisah; a few are well-do-do merchants, but the majority are cloth-sellers and goldsmiths. The negroes are a very conspicuous element of the population; they number over 40 00 altogether, and have social clubs of their cwrn which are distinguished by special sky-signs; about one-third are Matuq; or emancipated, while two-thirds are Tam- luk or enslaved. With the exception of the Persians, Bahrainah and some of the Hasawiyah who are Shias, the Muhammadans of Kuwait are nearly all Sunnis. The pilgrimage to Mecca from Kuwait i s normally made by land, and the average annual number of pilgrims who go isis only about 2 00 * The Arab population of Kuwait are not on the whole of a robust type; they are generally long-faced, slender and The men wear the ordinary garments of the sedentry Arab, wi th a red and white Kufiyah or kerchief -never blue and white- The women dress in black veils and overmantles, but sometimes display beneath a bri ght-coloured skirt which they allow to trail in the dust for some distance behind them. Traditions and Superstitions. There are several interesting traditions and superstitions in Kuwait, of which the fol lowing few will serve as examples:- On the foreshore almost in front of the American Mission is place of Khidhr, from the tradition that he stepped from there to Failakah island in one stride. It is the universal custom when the keel of a new boat is laid down to fence it round and keep a watchman over it at night until it is too high g© for a woman to jump over it, the belief being that if a barren woman succeeds in doing so she will at once be cured of her infirmity; at the same tiiiB , however, the boat will either be wrecked on its first voyage or its owner will die. In the event of anyone falling and injuring himself, it is customary to break some eggs at the place where the accident occurred in order to propitiate the local Jinn, and many believe that failure to do so would give the patient a poor chance of making a satisfactory recovery. People supposed to be possessed by Jinn are often taken to the negroes meeting places for treatment, as th^r are supposed to have peculiar powers for exorcising evil spirits f Jinn, it may inclined to lankiness; the complexion of many is sickly a rock kncwn as the Moti-al-Khidhrit may be noted, are said to be peculiarly prevalent te- near the cemetery towards the east of the town, beveral specific supernatural beings, of a malicious or at amy rate playful nature, are believed in. Of these the lantal , who is described as a negro giant of enormous size, but capable of shrinking at will, who annoys people particularly towards the south of the town by putting a barrier across the road along which they are walking, throw- % ing stones at them, etc. The Shahu &gt; wil ° a l so said to be found on Failkah island, is said to resemble a woman, with donkey^ feet, hands like a cow^ fore-feet, and heir like a camel-load of brushwood. The Kharuf-al- Musal^r^^^jJ^ or chained lamb, is described as an ani mal - usually a lamb in the first instance - with a chain round its neck, which converts itself into the shape of various other animals if anyone tries to catch it* The above are thou(^it to be ifiet wi'h chiefly at night. ihere is,' however, the Himarat-al-Qailah ^ 1 'jl U’ or s he-ass of the siesta, which, as its name implies, is most active duping the early part of the afternoon. Education. Except for the school conducted by the American Mission, there were for many years no educational facilities beyond those offered in the ordinary Mullas T schools, which here, as in other places, only teach a sufficiency of Arabic to enable the pupils to read the Q,uran the best of these is the Madrasat-al-Mubarakiyah, but even it does not pre tend to give a general education. In 1921, however, a sub scription was raised to endow a secondary Muslim ijchool, and a sum of 8 s.10,000 a year was subscribed. In September of that year the Madrasat-al-Ahmadiyah was accordingly opened. Owing to lack of funds, however, it has not been able to provide very efficient masters, but it is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. Supplies and Water. Neither Kuwait nor its environs can2Z can boast any agricultural resources* There are no date plantations, no fields, and not many kitchen gardens* Hawaii and the other neighbouring villages supply a certain amount of vegetables, as—alee—and melons, but the majority of the vegetables, as also forage, are brought from Jahrah or from abroad* The Bedouin of the district provide the town with gried curds, ghi and Faqa f or truffles, both fresh and dried, besides camel dung, which is used as fuel to supplement the scanty supply of brushwood from the neighbourhood* The drinking water of the town used formerly to be supplied from wells on its outskirts, mostly more or less brackish* These wells really only gave the scanty percolation of each season’s rain, and when the rainfall was slight, numbers of them gave out, while the remainder became still more brackish as they were deepened. In 1908, owing partly to the failure of the rains during the winter of 1907-08 and partly to the bad pearl season of 1907 whichreduced the pearling fraternity to poverty, it occurred to some of the boat owners to em ploy their vessels in the off season by carrying water fran the Shatt-Al-Arab. It was found water so brought could be sold cheaply and yet return a sufficient profit, and within a year there were at least a score of craft engaged entirely in this trade. Consequently the donkey owners, who formerly brought water in skins from the ne ighb our ing wells , sold off their animals and took to other trades. In course of time the town became almost entirely dependent on the Shatt-al- Arab for its drinking water, and at the present time there are over fity fair sized boats, specially fitted with tanks employed entirely in this trade. The supply is far from satisfactory, as a severe storm preventing the boats from putting to sea for two or three days, causes a serious short age of water, particularly in the summer months. large water distilling plant has been erected, but is not yet inla working- order* Sea Fidieries, The only truly local produce of Kuwait is tliat yielded by the harbour fisheri es; these are a valuable asset. A list of the commonest kinds of fish is given below, showing the seasons and localities in which they are most common. Of these the Zubaidi is the most important, and forms about one third of the total catch of the Kuwait boats Although commonest in spring, it is caught all the year round except in the very depth of winter* The Zubaidi is captured in float-and-weigfrt nets, 2 to 2 * fathoms deep, which are set across the tide-way; these nets are made in lengths of 36 fathoms, and each boat carries 8 to 16 lengths which are connected when set so as to form one long barrier 300 to 700 fathoms in extent. Some times 70 to 80 boats go out. The nets are cast after sunset, and are hauled three times in the nipjit; fish that are not disposed of the first day, in consequence of not reaching the town in time are salted. The next commonest fish are the Naqrur and the Nuwaibi which are caught chiefly with lines or Khuyut Ribyan or prawns, which are in season in Spring and early Summer, are caught with fine triangular handnets. Many fish of all kinds are taken in stake-nets or rather tidal the fish enter them with the flowing tide and left behind at the ebb. These Hadhrahs are a common sight along the coast near iv uwait, and also at other places such as Bahrain. The fishermen of Kuwait are mostly tcwn Arabs of the Awazim tribe but there are also some other Arabs and Persians. The boats used are practically all Shu’ais ^, the ex- ceptions being Jalibots ^A few of the primitive Huwairiyas^or boat made of date branches are still used, and some are usually to be seen drawn up on the beach at Bunaid- al-Q,ar. As a rule Kuwait fishermen do not go outside Auhah Island near Failkah, but occasionally they visit the Khor weirs, called Hadhrahs constructed of reed-hurdlesli« Kh(br Abdulla and fish it, for Zubaidi only, between -^as- al-C^aid and War bah island; at such times they take their drinking water with them and are absent from Kuwait for about a week, not Icmding on Bubiyan island except to collect fuel* The majority of the fish caught is consumed locally, but Zabaidis, as also Likhmahs, Sawais and sharks, are also dried and exported to Basrah and elsewhere* Pearl Fisheries, The lower and middle classes of Kuwait town almost all live by seafaring occupations, such as fishing, pearl diving and the carrying trade; at present (1921) the town possesses over 700 pearl boats; the great majority are Sambuks ^ &gt; hut Shu’ais^are also commonly used, besides a few Jalibots , small Bums and one or two Batils • Kany of these boats have not been at sea for years, as, owing to the increased deirand for labour in Mesopotamia, it is now impossible to find crews for them* The average number of pearling boats from Kuwait which now visit the banks is not more than about 320. In former years a large number of Kuwait pearl divers used to visit the Ceylon pearl banks in winter, but this has not been done since the war. Carrying Trade* There are at present (1933) some 200 boats sailing under the Kuwait flag, engaged in the carrying and coasting trade, of which 60 have a carrying capacity of over 100 tons each; of these 8 bums carry over 3^0 tons; 15 bums and 5 Eaghalahs &lt;0-^ , over 230 tons; 1 Danghiyah &gt; , 19 2 tons; 25 bums and 4 baghalahs, over 145 tons; and 2 Kutiyahs J, 115 tons* Of the smaller craft 15 bums carry over 75 tons each; 55 Bums, over 50 tons; and 28 bums over 30 tons; 8 sambuks and 5 Shu T ais carry 23 tons each; and 21 balams and 14 Jalibots, 15 tons each. The carrying trade is chiefly con fined to India, but Kuwait boats also sometimes visit Zanizibar, Aden, Jibuti, the Red Lea ports, etc. LongLong voyages are only made during the winter months. During the summer when the monsoon would render it dangerous for them to leave the Persian Gulf, the large cargo vessels are laid up in Kuwait, either in the various niqSahs or tidal harbours, or at Bandar ash-Shiwaikh to the west of the town. The smaller vessels are employed in the coasting trade within the Persian Gulf, the smallest plying almost exclusively between Kuwait and the Shatt-al-Arab. Forty boats are employed constantly in bringing water from there to the town. On an average four such boats arrive daily and bring 27,200 gallons of water. BOAT BUILDING . Kuwait is famed for boat building and quite the best boats in the Gulf are built there. A considerable change has been introduced in Kuwait in the types of boats built in the last 35 years. Formerly the largest sea-going vessels were all of the BAGHALAHBaghalah type, while the Bum type was confined to medium sized and snail vessels. Now, however, the largest boats built in Kuwait are all without exception bums . It BUM is claimed for the bum that it has better Cargo space than the Baghalah and that with its pointed stern, it is a better sea boat, particularly in a following sea. Two Indian built boats, known in Arabic as the Kutiyah and Dangiyah very closely resemble the tffehalah and the bum respectively. The kutiyah, which is fairly common in Kuwait, is in all respects similar to the baghalah . excepting that the stemhead has a peculiar device, rather like a bird T s head with the beak pointing back, instead of the ba^halah 1 s plain knob. The danp;iyah which is not so common, is excatly like a bfrm except for its stem- head, which is more like that of a shu t ai . The sea-going balam from the Shatt al--rab also resembles a small bum except that its stern-head is cut off short, and it usually looks badly built and badly rigged. The Jalibaut and the Mashuwah are practically the same, and are so well known that they need not be described. Of other boats used the Sambuk is pre-eminently the pearling boat of Kuwait. In fact it is rarely used for other purposes, though eight are employed in the local carrying trade# Its square stern is said to make it more suitable for the frequent turning that is required at the pearl banks than is a boat:of the bum type, whichwhich is hardly ever seen there except as a iaiarxxx dealer’s boat. Sambuk. Very similar to the above is the Shu’ai, except that it is usually smaller. The only difference, however, is in the stem-head, as can be seen below. Shu T ai. The Shu’ai is a very common boat in Kuwait. Itbis used for fishing, for pearl diving, and four or five of them are used in the local carrying trade. A very peculair type of boat, now rarely seen atActually the only one in use is that of the 'Commodore' of the Pearling Fleet, It is said to be a very fast type of boat, and was rather popular amongst piratesl Its peculiar fiddle headed bow and high stern board carved with a peculiar device, which is always the same, make it conspicuous from amongst all other types of craft. Somewhat similar is the Baqarah . except that in place of the fiddle head it has a very sharp pointed clipper bow. There is not a single Baqarah in Kuwait itself, and only one in Failakah. No other type deserve mention. Trade. Kuwait owes its mercantile importance to its pearling and carrying fleets, and to its trade with India, and with Iraq and Persia - especially a lucrative smuggling trade. Also in normal years with the Interior of Arabia,, particularly Qasim, for which it is the natural port. Since the begining of 1922, how ever, this trade has been closed by Ibn Saud, who has prohibited his subjects from trading with Kuwait at all. His reason for this action is that he says he is unable to collect his Customs dues on goods imported from Kuwait in the desert, and that he wants to esta blish a Najd Customs House in Kuwait Town, an arrange ment which the Shaikh of Kuwait has naturally never seen his way to accept. Other suggestions have been ipade to get over the difficulty: for example that import duty into Najd should be abolished, and that the Shaikh of Kuwait should levy expott duty instead and pay Ibn Saud a fixed sum, but up to the present it has not been possible to come to any agreement. This sto page of trade between Najd and Kuwait is a most serious matter ui for Kuwait - as also for Qasim and L Jl Hail - and the prosperity of the town has been declining ever since. The people of Kuwait are nearly all of Najd origin, and not a few of the Kuwait merchants had*' IK ^ ^ O) ^ )’V-VW~ Ttwt &amp; HyvK-v f- A TUd-wv JlXx. .2 1 Lliscellaneous Occupations^ The other occupations and in dustries of the town are directed to the satisfaction of local requiremsnts; an enumeration of then as they were in 1921 will help to elucidate the character of Kuwait* There were then 80 dealers in piecegoods, 44 goldsmiths, 18 black smiths, 6 tinaniths, 6 gunsmiths, 6 lamp-makers, 206 dealers in Bedomin requisites (including 25 women), 24 leather workers, 23 quilt makers, 55 haberdashers, 10 tailors, 50 cloak embroiderers (of whom only 5 keep shops and the re mainder work in their homes) , 7 gold and sil braid workers; 4 makers of Aqals or Arab head fillets, 19 barbers, 11 con fectioners, 23 bakers (including 13 women), 9 dealers in marine stores (anchors, various kinds of rope, etc.) 12 pro fessional cooks, 27 butchers, 45 tobacconists, 24 ghi sel lers, 41 date merchants, 3 druggists, 18 fishmongers, 124 fruiterers, 147 rice dealers, 45 wheat dealers, 16 oil merchants, 30 grass sellers ( of whom only 8 have shops) and 15 dallals or brokers of private goods on commission. There were at the same time 30 tea shops and 5 cafes. The above figures were for the summer months; during the winter many additional shops are opened temporarily by pearl divers while not thus employed. ./eights, measures and currency. The weights and measures by means of which the tradesmen of Kuwait conduct the busi ness with one another and with the general public deserve a brief notice. The most accurate of these, as is obviously necessary, are those used in the pearl trade. Exceptionally large and fine pearls are bought and sold singly, and there is no recognised method of assessing their value. Kedium pearls are assorted with reference to size by being passed through a series of perforated brass or copper bowls, called Tasah, U* , the standard set of which consists of four; the perforations of the largest called Has are *18' in diameter; of the second Batn .15 inches; of the third, Dhail ^) ,.13 inches; and the fourth, RabiahRabiah ^ ,.11 inch. Tholesale purchases of pearls from liakhudas by Tawwashes are made chiefly by size. In this case, after any specially fine pearls have been removed which it is desired to dispose of separately, the rest are assorted into Ras, Batn, etc., and change hands at a pre viously arranged rate at so much per Mithqal ArabijA/^J which is equivalent to 450 grains. The ordinary pearl then usually passes from one dealer to another on a more precise kind of estimate based upon weight; in Kuwait the Bombay Mithqal, equivalent to 75 grains Troy and subdivided into 24 Rattis jr each of 16 -nahs^, is usually employed. The unit in the dealer's system is called a Chau , and although derived from a weight, is not in itself a weight, the number of Chaus in a pearl is found by squaring the weight of the pearl in Mithqals and multiplying the result by 330. The Chau is divisible into 100 Dukrahs cy*j , and the Dukrah into 10 Bad&amp;ms ^• There are other kinds of Chaus also occasionally used and obtained by an identical process from other Mithqals, such as the Poona Mithqal of 68i grains. Most dealers have ready-reckoners for the con venient calculation of Chaus from weight, of which the n Daf tar Hisab-al-Lulu f ^^^ , published in Bombay is the most popular. V/hen the number of Chaus in a* pearl has been obtained, it only remains in order to determine its value to apply the market rate per Chau of the class to which it belongs. Gold is sold by the Mithqal Attari Iti* or 54 grain, which is divisible into 18 Habbahs or Hamar of 3 grains each. It is also - probably more frequently - sold by the Li rah or Turkish pound, and fractions thereof Silver is sold by the Mithqal Shiraof 72 grains, divided into 24 Habbahs of 3 grains each. The Mithqal Attari and the Mithqal Shirazi are also both used for drugs and. silk -thread, but for t h&amp;s purpose they are not divisible into Habbahs, but only into halves and quarters,ard the niceties of weight are arrived at by using the two Mighqals and their fractions in conjunction. Perfumes, as also gpld thread, are sold by the Tolah^of 180 grains Troy. The ordinary unit of weight in Kuwait is the •Vaqiyah of which there are three kinds; viz, one of 4 lbs. 10.22 oz. another of 4 lbs. 15.168 oz. , and a third of 9 lbs.4.44 oz., being respectively the weight of 75, 80 and 150 Karia Theresa dollars, on which coin the Waqiyah is based. The Waqiyah of 4 lbs. 15.168 oz. is only used by the local customs for imports from the desert, and beyond this men tion of it, no fhrther notice will be taken of it here. The Waqiyah of 4 lbs. 10.22 oz. is used by the local Customs for sea imports and is universally used in the bazaar, ex cept in the sale of fish for which alone the double Taqiyah of 9 lbs.4.44 oz. is used. A larger measure is the Mann ir* , of which there are six distinct varieties, all based on the Waqiyah of 4 lbs 10.22 oz • t A Kuwait Taghar ^ is 20 Manns of 36 Waqiyahs (the Mann Basri) or approximately 3340 lbs. Firewood is normally sold by the Baf 4 Manns of 30 ’Waqiyahs, equivalent to 556 lbs. 10.4.oz. Juss is sold by the Karah ^ of 100 Manns of 24 Waqiyahs or 11133 lbs. The term Karah is also used for date palm branches, in which sense it equals 1000 branches. Beams and masts are sold by the Calicut Kandy of 10 cubic feet, 29 cubic inches; chandals (round rafters or spars) the Korjah or score; boat ribs by the Oari or cart load of 40 pieces or upwards according to size. Kuwait stone is sold by the Tishalah aJ Lt or lighter load, averaging 250 cubic feet. The four gallon kerosene oil tin is used as a measure of capacity; it is principally used for the sale of water, butor date syrup are also sometimes but gbi, fat and Dibs sold by the tin. The unit of length is the Dhira or cubit of 19 inches cotton and woollen goods and some kinds of planking are sold by the Dhira 1 , and it is also used for measuring up masonry work which has been given out on contract by the piece. Dope is normally sold by the Ba' or fathom, which is the full span of the arms. There is no square measure in use; and a plot of ground is described as being so many Dhiras accor ding to the sum of its sides. The Indian Rupee has been the official local currency since 1911, when it replaced the Maria Theresa Dollar. The latter however, is still largely used and of necessity in all transactions with Arabs of the interior. Customs and Lifehterage . The administration of the Kuwait Customs is supervised by a local xxshs Arab and system works satisfactorily. An import duty of 4 c /o ad valorem is charged, and there is no export duty, except on goods brought in from the interior, such as ghi, hides, wool, etc., on which 470 is charged if exported. These low rates of duty no doubt encourage smuggling. There is one pecularity in the Kuwait Customs Regulations, viz., that the Shaikh persists in charging duty on goods manifested for but not landed at, Kuwait. The arrangements for lightering and landing cargo at Kuwait are superior to those at any other port in the Persian Gulf. Physical Geograph y. Kuwait State generally speaking may be said to consist of a hard gravelly surface north of a line Kuwait - Jahrah - Rigai, and undulating to sandy south of such line. While west of the Shaqq the country everywhere as far as the Batin is f)§\J)t, hard and gravelly. The best Arfaj grazing is in the region lying along the sea for a depth of 40 miles, while Nuzzi grazing lies to the west of it. The only well marked valley of any size is that of the Shaqq, a portion of which is within the Kuwait frontier; while on the western boundary there is the wide and longlong valley of the Batin. The only eminences deserving of mention are the Jal-az-Zor on the north side of Kuwait Bay, and a few isolated hills which are of some importance as landmarks, such as Sirrah in Qara^h district, Burqan and 7/arah in the f Adan region and GRAIN and Jebel FUARIS in the Neutral Zone. Beyond the recognised frontier to the south, the Dhila’-al-Muai jil and the plateaux of Ba’al and V/uraiah are also worthy of notice. Nowhere in Kuwait is there any flowing water or spring rising to the surface of the ground nor any in the adjoining tracts, except AIN al Abd in the Maqta regionwhich consists of sulphurated hydrogen and flows out at the rate of 1,000 gallons a minute. The entire water supply is therefore from wells which are on the average about 20 feet deep. The only minerals known to exist^ are Juss or gypsum, in f£\jlds near Kuwait Town and else where, and some bitumen springs near the Burqan Hill, and on the north east side of Kuwait Bay near Mudaira. Pearl Divers say that there is also a subterranean spring under the sea near Qaru Island. Flora and Fauna. Vegetation is extremely scanty and in winter becomes almost invisible. The only trees are the date, the ber or siddar ^—' and the tamarisk or Athl and they even are not met with except in the environs of villages. Shrubs found, especially in the northern eastern as and southern districts, and useful fax grazing for Mimadts camels are Arfaj &gt; ' the various HAIDH species, bush with small leaves and red berries. The colocynth, obtainable but is often of poor quality. Nasi^^^grass is also obtainable in plenty to the west of the Shaqq. Local Xmrt/animal and bird life are scarce, but the wild animals include the hare and gazelle resembling the Indian chinkara, and the Ausaj , the last is the bibxthorn, a thorny called Handhal , flourishes in the desert; and south of Kuwait Bay the grass called Thamam K is also the wolf; among the land birds are the lesser bastard and the sandgrouse. During the winter and spring Kuwait forms'nupm *’ «n , ‘| forms an ideal centre for the study of migratory birds moving from the Tropics to Russia and Asia. The State seems to fall in a direct line of these birds flights. Military Resources . The Shaikh of Kuwait maintains a standing force of about 300 men, mostly footmen, armed with rifles, who defend his person, supply the town guards at night and perform his errands in the country. In time of war this fighting force consists of the best levy he can raise from the redouin subject to his influence and from the settled inhabitants. At the time of the battle of Jahrah in October 1920 practically all the able.bodied men of Kuwait Town were impressed into military service, and for many weeks after it every leading merchant had to supply his quota of men for the protection of the town wall at night. The Shaikh possesses for an emergency an armoury of good up to date weapons consisting of some 4,500 Mausers and .303 British rifles with a plentiful supply of ammunition. He also possesses six Ford Vanettes mounted with Lewis Guns on tripods, and one Chevrolet Lorry with a 'Vickers' Machine Gun similarly mounted. Revenue . There is no distinction in Kuwait betv/een the State revenues and the privy purse of the Ruler. The Shaikh H s chief sources of revenue are his Customs, Pearl Fisheries, private estates on the Shatt-al-Arab and Zakat*ha( in Buraidah a th&lt; of Najd inter© thai those r en now of ^Iraq. Ibn Sa'ud- The great Wahabi Ruler Faisal bin Turki as-Saud who died in 1865 left his throne to his eldest son, T Abdullah. The latter^s brother Sa f ud, however, rebelled against him and occupied Riyadh. Abdullah fled to Hail, and invoked the assistance of Ibn Rashid, who: was then the most powerful man in Arabia. Baud was defeated and killed, but Abdullah soon realised that he had gained little, as Ibn Rashid annexed the Wahabi country, and Abdullah was kept a prisoner in Hail until he died. Meanwhile the remnants of the Saixd, who would not submit to a foreign yoke, had gone into exile, some to the Hijaz, and others including Faiial’s fourth son, Abdur Rahman, to Kuwait. Encouraged and helped by Shaikh Mubarak, another bitter enemy of Ibn Rashid, Abdmr Rahman undertook the task of freeing his land from the foreigner. An attempt in 1900 failed, but in the spring of 1901 Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman al- Faisal as-Saud, the present Ibn Saud acting for his father, left Kuwait with a picked following of two hundred men. 7/hen he arrived near Riyadh, he halted his party and went on at Busk with fifteen men alone. They made their way unnoticed to the house of Ibn Rashid’s governor, into which they forced an entry and placed everyone in it under arrest in one room. They learned that the governor, as always, had gone to the fort to pass the night for greater security. They accordingly waited in the house till he returned in the morning surrounded by his bodyguard. As the cortege approached the door, the sixteen rushed out sword in hand, and, after a brieg struggle Abdul Aziz found himself master of Riyadh. The following years werewere spent in recovering province after province firom the domination of the foreigner. In the spring of 1913 Abdul Aziz, in whose favour his father had abdicated, swooped upon Hasa and turned the Turks out of the province lock, stock and barrel. Such was the state of affairs at the outbreak of the war - which affected Arabia less than most parts of the world. When Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait renounced fealty to the Turk, he really changed nothing. When Ibn Rashid marched against Ibn Saud at the close of 1914, although he nominally did so on behalf of the Turfcs, it was really only another hand in the old match between the rival principalities of Riyadh and Hail. The rival forced met at Majma T ah, 120 miles north west of Riyadh, and fought an indecisive battle, in which Captain Shakespeare who was with Ibn Saud was killed. It was not till the begining of November 1921, however, that the long struggle was finally brought to a close by the final surrender of Hail to Ibn Saud. This brought not only the Jabal Shammar, but Jauf and all the surrounding country to the borders of Syria, under his sway. Ibn Saud’s next campaign against the Hijaz started in the summer of 1924, the result of a quarrel which had long been simmering. By the end of 1925 he had captured the Hijaz and expelled the Hashimite dynasty. Thus in twenty five years did this extraordinary man rai se himself from an exile in Kuwait to be King of Hijaz and of Najd and its Dependencies. Ibn Saud is now a man of about fifty years of age. He is at least 6 ft 3 in. in height, and of very dignified and handsome appearance. He possesses an extraordinary charm of manner such as I have rarely seen in any man of any race. Abdullah bin Jiluwi ,Ibn Saud’s cousin, isis certainly the second most imprtant man of the Saud family. He was one of the faithful band who accompanied Ibn Saud on the desperate venture which restored the throne of Riyadh to his family, and has ever since enjoyed and merited his undoubted confidence. He was appointed Governor of Qasim on the reconquest of that province from Ibn Rashid, and in 1914 was ordered to Hasa to create order out of confusion left by the Turks, which he soon did. In fact before long he had made himself indispensable there - but for which fact, he would much prefer to lead a quiet life at h^ome, as he is said to be absolutely unambitious. Several years older than Ibn Saud, he is said to be a man of medium build, somewhat morose in appearance. He has earned aft extraordinary reputation for justice. Ikhwan, or ’Brethern*, is the name assumed by the fana tical Wahabi converts after the recent revival. It is not quite certain when this ’revival* first started, but the term 'Ikhwan' first came into general use about the begining of the war. It was then that Ibn Saud decided to turn his attention to it as a means of strengthening and consolidating his power. The story goes that Ibn Jiluwi warned him against it and said f, they would certainly make a useful weapon, but I fear that they may fast be like an automatic pistol which certainly fires ftxxt, but with which there is a danger that when you put it in your belt it may go off and wouHd you Tt . To this Ibn Saud is said to have replied 'Don’t be frightened of that, when I’ve done with my pistol, I’ll unload it and throw the cartridges on the ground'. He did realise, however, that it was vital to get the members of the new xult under control. In 1916 he issued his famous order that all Bedouins of Najd must join the movement. This led to much fighting, but by 1918 he had forced all eicept the Ajman to do so, and to recognise him as their Imam. In order to keep these tribes&amp; tribes under bis control, he induced his religious leaders to issue a fatwah that the Ikhwan should build themselves villages and till the soil, this being incumbent on them from a religious point of view. The order seems to have been responded to with enthusiasm in most cases. The progress of the movement was most cleverly managed, and Ibn Saud showed great genius in n working out the scheme without estraging the ^ppple. He himself selected the site for each Ikhwan village. With a tribe which was not of itself keen to join the movement his method seems to have been to send for the Shaikh and tell him in blunt terms that his tribe had no religion. He would then order the Shaikh to attend a course of instruction at a school of Religion. At the same time half a dozen selected instructors, attended by some genuine fanatic like Faisal ad-Dawish, would be sent off to the tribe. These would hold daily classes, and it rarely took them long to rouse the dormant fanaticism inherent in simple and savage people. These teachers insisted on all conveifs wearing a white turban over the kerchief in place of the head rope (Ibn Saud has since decreed that this is not necessary, and he himself always wears the head-rope). The strictest Puritanism is the key note of their religion, and the use of tobacco is regarded by them as a deadly sin as the drinking of alcohol. They themselves are all Brethren, but like all new converts to any religion they are very intolerant. They will not even salute, or return the salute of anyone outside their own sect, or even allow that he is a Muslim. I remember Shaikh Salim having one flogged for swaggering up to a shop keeper in Kuwait and saying as he pointed to some of his wares '’’Ala cham, ya chafir'? (How much is is it, infidel?'). Of the tribes most closely associated with Kuwait the most imprtant are:-The Mutair . a large tribe, said to be of Hijaz origin, and closely akin to the Harb and the Utaibah. Until they became Ikhwan the Mutair were one of the most typical Bedouin tribes of Central Atabia, with a range from near Kuwait town in the north, westward to the Batin, to Q,asim and the northern part of Hasa in the south. Since their 'conversion”, however, the majority of them have settled, notably at Artawiyah (250 miles south west of Kuwait, and 150 miles north-west of Riyadh), which is one of the most famous Ikhwan villages in Arabia, and the seat of the most powerflul Shaikh o f the tribe, the fanatical Faisal ad-Dawish. Another of their villages is Jaryah (125 miles south of Kuwait) the seat of Ibn Shuqair, the building of which in 1920 v/as one of the causes of the quarrel between Ibn Saud and Shaikh Salim. The original sections of the Mutair are only two, the ’Ilwah and the Buraih. But t these have been added in recent timfcs, probably by a fission from the Buraih, a third section, the Bani Abdullah. During the struggle for supremacy at the beginning of the century the Bani Abdullah sided with Ibn Rashid, while the majority of the tribe^ were partisans of Ibn Saud. After the defeat of Ibn Rashid they rejoined the main body of the Mutair, but the recon ciliation was only temporary, and they have separated them selves again, and left the tribe for the country between Najd and Mecca. The Ilwfah consist of two sub-sections, the Muwahah, which is Faisal ad-Dawish f s own sub-section, and of which the other chief shaikhs are Jufran al-Fuqm, Haif al-Fuqm and Ibn Ghunaiman; and the Uiblan, of which the chief shaikhs are Faisal bin Shiblan and Saihud bin Lami. The Buraih are composed of three main sub-sections, the Aulad Ali, the Aulad V/asil end the Birzan, all of which are Ui der the leadership of Ibn Musaiyis of the Aulad Wasil. To the Birzan belong the notorious family fcfof Abu Shuwairibat, the members ofmwhich caused so much trouble to the peace of the frontier a few years ago. The Mutair have suffered heavily in the recent wars, particularly in the battle of Jahrah in October 1920, and the fighting outside Hail in September 1921, and it is probbale that the total strength of the tribe does not now exceed 9,000 souls, Faisal ad-Dawish’s authority as paramount Shaikh of the Mutair has been much consolidated by the change of religion. The tribe, as is also the case with other Ikhwan tribes, is not now well armed. The ^.iman, usually pronounced Aiman - the singular of which is Ajmi (Aini) - are one of the most important tribes of Eastern Arabia. Their proper summer range is the Gulf lowalands from Taff to Uqair (Ujair) enve loping the Hasa oasis on the north and east. Inland their country stretches beck over the Summan, and in winter as far as Sudair. On the littoral they have some times straggled into Qatar, and frequently to, and beyond Kuwait town. Some settled Ajman detached from the tribe, have for many years been found in Kuwait town, and in the coastal villages to the south of it. The tribe is a strong one, although their claim to be able to turn out over 10,000 fihgting men, including 2,000 horsemen, is probably exaggerated; yet there is little doubt that they number over 30,000 souls. In politics they have always been a shifting and inconstant factor. During the Ottoman occupation of Hasa and Qatif they were constantly recalcitrant. They wel comed Ibn Saud when he invaded Hasa in 1913, but once he was established, liked him and his taxes no better he than the Turks. In 1915 xx/organisfed^ a campaign against them, but was defeated in an abortive night attack, and his own brother Sa’d was killed. Later on/-V / on, with the assistance of a Kuwait force under Shaikh Salim, he hemmed them in near the Qatif coast. After being besieged for some time the Ajman surrender ed to Shaikh Salim, who sent them to Kuwait, where Shaikh Mubarak accepted them, against Ibn Saud f s wishes who wished to further avenge his brother’s death. Soon after this Shaikh Mubarak died, and Shaikh Jabir, in order to placate Ibn Saud, ejected the Ajman from Kuwait territory. After making overtures first to Ujaimi as-Sadun and then to Ibn Rashid, they obtained per mission from the Shaikh of Zubair to settle quietly at Safwan. On the occasion of Ibn Saud’s visit to Kuwaitath Basrah in November 1916 a truce was arranged between him and the Ajman. In the middle of 1917, howrver, Ibn Saud induced the Awazim to leave Kuwait territory and settle in Najd. Shaikh Salim, who was then Ruler, retaliated by seducing the Ajman, who moved en masse into Kuwait territory. Sven^tually after much correspondence, Ibn Saud agreed to restore the Awazim if Shaikh Salim would turn out the Ajman and cut off his relations with Shammar. The i^wazim were returned but the Ajman remained in Kuwait terri tory. By the begining of 1918 the question had become such a burning one that it was decided to take the tribe under British protection, and they were settled to the north of Zubair. Here they were guilty of so much raiding that Ibn Saud was eventually told that, so far as the British were concerned, there was no objection to his taking action against them. About a year later the Ajman agai^n acknowledge their alle giance to Ibn Saud and returned to Najd. Since then they have become Ikhwan. The paramount chieftainship of Ajman is in the Hithlain family of the Najiah sub section of the maidh section of the tribe, the present holder being Dhaidan al-Hithlain. His headquarterSisis at Sarar (165 miles south of Kuwait). The chief sections of the tribe are the Arjah under Sftaikh Mani bin Jumah; the Dhain under Shaikh Fahad bin Sad; the Hadi, under Shaikh Nahar al-Mutallaqim (recently in Iraq); the Hajraf, the Hajjan, the Hamad bin Rashid and the Hitlan, all under Nahar al-Mutalaqqim; the Khuwaitir, the Mahfudh, under Mabkhut al-Muqrad,; the lia’idh, the Miflih, the Misra* , the Rushaid and the Sulaifi, under Dhaidan al-Hithlain himself; the Shamar under Sultan bin Hithlain; the Shawawilah under Fahad bin Hithlain; the Sifran, under Mansur bin Shafi al and Munaikh; the Sulaiman under Muhammad bin Musami ;/the Suraih* The *Awazim (Singular - Azimi) are a bedouin tribe of the oanntry south of Kuwait. About 250 non-nomadic families of the tribe are settled in Kuwait town, where one of the quarters is called after them; others possess the village of Dimnah to the west of Ras al-Ardh; and a few live on Maskan island, or maschan at it is always called. The tribe has no connection with another tribe of ’Av/azim or Hawazim found in dentral Arabia, especially near Jauf. These ’Awazim, who claim to be of Harb origin, apparently first made their appearance in the neighbiurhood of Kuwait during the early part of the 19 th century. They are divided into two main sections, the Ku’ah and the Ghiyadh, of which the former takes prece dence. Their paramount Shaikh is Habib bin Jami of the Hadalin sub-section of the Ku’ah. The tribe numbers about 4,000 souls. They are pastoral nomads, fisher men and pearl divers. They are large breeders of camels sheep and goatd, also a fair number of donkeys, but few horses. In Kuwait tom the fishing trade is mostly in their hands. The ’Awazim are recognised as an inferior tribe, and intermarry only amongst themselves and with the Rashaidah. For many years the ’Awazim were thethe loyal subjects of Kuwait, and from a military point of view formed the backbone of Ibn Subah’s state. During the question of Shaikh Salim the question of their tribute was one of the chief causes of his quarrel with Ibn Saud. The nomads of th© tribe have now become Ikhwan, and have naturally oriented themselves towards Ibn Sa*ud. The Rashaidah (singular Rashidi) are an inferior tribe of Kuwait and the territory to the south of it. They number about 4,000 souls and are said to be of Kutaim extraction; those in Kuwait town who are largely of the Hirshan section, are not infrequently called Kutaim a term which is also applied to the Saluba, those despised tinker outcasts who are found all over Arabia. A few years ago the majority of the nomadic Rashaidah became Ikhwan. The chief Shaikhs of the tribe at present are Mutlaq al-Musailim (whom I last heard of in Iraq) and Asi al-Musailim (who is with the Ikhwan). There are seventeen sections to the tribe, hut no useful purpose is served by enumerating them* The Dhafir is an Iraq tribe of Bedouins whose winter hfebitat is the country to the south of the railway line between Zubair and Nasiriyah. In the summer they are mostly on the Umm al-Afur island, opposite Samawah. They have for some time been flirting with Ikhwanism. The Muntafik - or Tt Muntafiq n as the name is officially spelt in English in Iraq, though I have never heard it pronounced that way, or spelt that way in Arabic - are a very large Iraq tribe, of which a portion are still Bedouin. We are only concerned with them in that, amongst other places, they are found in the western desert of the right bank of the Euphrates - chiefly between Nasiriyah and Samawah.The Shammar , whoniused to be of such vital importance in the politics of Central and Eastern Arabia, have more or less faded out of the picture. Formerly the Southern Shammar were not only a powerful nomad tribe, oasis of but also masters of the/Jabal Shammar. Their paramount o*.ly Shaikh Ibn Rashid, was not chief of his own tribe, but also was ruler of a settled principality, of which Hail was the capital. Since the fall of Hail in 1921, however, they have fallen from their high estate, and have largely joined the Northern section of the tribe. Recent events in the Desert . In 1923 a tendency began to be noticeable amongst Najd tribes to take refuge in Iraq from the exactions of Ibn Sa f ud. These even included some families from the most raoidly I :hwan tribe like the Mutair - notably the Diyahin, a sect of the Aulad Wasil sub-section Buraih section of that tribe. These refugees soon started raiding into Najd, at the direct instigation of King Faisal according to the popular belief in Najd, and made the state of the country more disturbed than it had been for years. -i-he Kuwait conference between Najd and Iraq and Trans-Jor- dania was watched with intense interest to see whether Iraq would agree to Ibn Sa’ud’s demand that such refugee tribes should be compelled to return. Big raids into, and from, Najd continued to take place in rapid success ion until May 1925 when under orders from the Iraq Government these seceders from the Ikhwan tribes of lajd who had taken refuge in Iraq and had disturbed the peace of the frontier for so long, started to move towards the Northern Jazirah. By the end of June 1925 the country was free from them, and an immediate improvement in the state of the country followed. A long spell of quiet and more or less immunity from raids followed - doubtless due in part to the fact that the Ikhwan tribes were otherwise engaged, the Ilijaz campaign being then in progress.Scon after the fall of Jiddah at the end of 1925 many of the Ikhwan leaders returned to Najd. Some were bitterly disappointed that the Hijaz campaign had not offered better facilities for amassing plunder. Notable amongst these was Faisal ad-Dawaish. No sooner had he arrived at Artawiyah than he summoned his followers to prepare for a big raid against Iraq, Before he had time to set out, however, he received definite orders from Ibn Sa T ud for bidding him to,proceed, and reluctantly disbanded his men. In April he visited Sultan bin Humaid, paramount Shaikh of the f Utaibah, at G-hatghat. From there an invitation was sent to Dhaidan al-Hithlain of the ^jman, who joined them shortly afterwards. They then apparently took an oath binding themselves together for mutual support in the event of Ibn Sa’ud wishing to take punitive action against any of them. There continued to be much talk about the strained relations between Ibn Sa T ud and the leaders of the Ikhwan, particularly the three mentioned above, who were much dissatisfied with Ibn Sa*ud f s idea of orga nising a civilised government in the Hijaz, and his prohi biting them from raiding across the frontier. They argued that if, as they maintained, the people of Iraq,Kuwait, etc., were not true muslims, they itoBEghi ought to be allowed to fight against them; if, on the other hand, Ibn Sa^d prohibited this, saying that they were not enemies, he had no right to prevent them from trading with them - as he did in the case of Kuwait. In the summer of 1927 a plot to murder Ibn Sard's son, Sa'ud, in Riyadh, and his cousin Ibn Jliluwi at Rasa, at the same time, was discovered and frustrated only just in time. In the early part of 1927, on the Persian Govern ent refusing permission for the Imperial Air7/ays to establish a service to India along the south coastbof Persia, the suggestion was made that the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf might be followed instead, and Ibn Sa f ud was approachedapproached with a view to obtaining his permission for the route over his territory to be used. As was to be expected, the very idea of such a thing was anathema to the Ildiwan, and Ibn Sa r ud on the very strong advice of Ibn Jiluwi said that he could not agree. Next came the building of a police post at Baswah, or Busaiyah as we usually call it. The Ikhwan apparently connet it in their minds with the Air Route Scheme, and think that it is destined to become an enormous petrol dump j hence their determination to destroy it. The Air Route Scheme and Busaiyah Post between them certainly seem to be the immediate causes of Faisal ad-Dawish and his Mutair getting out of hand, and going raiding in defiance of Ibn Sard’s orders. The real reason is that they, like all Bedouins, are para sites who do not earn their living in the world, end must be paid or raid. The actual attack on Busaiyah Post, the raid on the Kuwait f Uraibdar, or local Bedouin, etc are too recent to require recapitulating. At present the situation seems to be that Faisal ad- Dawish, as stated above, is acting in open defiance of Ibn Sa^d. The Ajman and other tribes are quiet at present, but are not a verybreliable weapon in Ibn Sa’ud’s hands. Ibn Sa’ud is certainly in a very awakward position; he is obviously having very strong pressure brought to bear on him, as it is hard to think that a man of his acumen can really think all that he has been writing in his recent letters of protest. It remains to be seen whether he will be able to bring Dawish to heel and re-establish his authority, or not. Personally I think he will do so through the Ulama . whom he has summoned to Riyadh. He has a very persuas ive tongue, and they have great influence with the tribes, if he can make them see reason.Meanwhile, as far as Kuwait is concerned, the people are still in a state of nervous tension. The town wall has been repaired, and is manned every night. The village of Jahrah is also strongly held with a force of over three hundred men, including a body of specially engaged mercenaries, but not counting the Bedouin camped in the vicinity. Many alarmist rumours are current, and accurate news is at a discount. lUL, \ijLytr )Communications From what has gone before it will be apparent that Kuwait, though free as to its surface from physical obstacles, is not an easy country to travel in. At a maximum of 29 to 25 miles from the town in any direction even the smallest quantity of provisions ceases to be obtainable; it is thus necessary to carry all food required. The case of forage is easier, as in many localities can support themselves by grazing. tfater is scarce everywhere, especially to the north of Jahrah, and routes are determined everywhere chiefly by the position and state of wells. The details of the more important roads are given below. All these, of course, are mere tracks; there are no made roads. The motor road to Ba$ra from Kuwait though unmetalled is quite the best of these. See Route I. Note. With the advent of the motor car several roads have been blazed, between Kuwait and Riath. Quite the best of these in fact the only satisfactory one, takes the following route. Kuwait, Manaquish, Khabrat al Duwish, down the Shaqq, Jerriya al Ilya, Turaibi, Kanhara (East side of Dhana opposite Ruma) Ruma, Rumhiyeh, Baruban, Riath.I # Motor Route from Kuwait Town to Zubair and Basra , (a) This is the only road worthy of the name that exists in Kuwait State and was opened in 1928. It is passable for all sorts of vehicular traffic all the year round and except duting heavy rains when a 5 mile section between Kuwait and Jahara, and another similar strip between Safwan and Zubair gets water logged renders car movement difficult, the road may be called a good one. It is unmetalled throughout its length but as the surface is hard gravel this does not affect its condition, or the speed of cars. (b) From the Kuwait Post Office to the British Consulate in Basra the distance has been found to be by check 110 miles. Deducting 10 miles for the portion Zubair to the Consulate, we arrive at a distance of 100 miles approximately for the strip hsixsas: Kuwait - Zubair. (c) The road passes close to Jahra and through Safwaan, an Iraq frontier Police and Customs Post: between Jahara and Safwan a distance of some 60 miles there is no water at all. (d) The Telegraph line which at one time followed the coast line via Subiyeh (Route II) was dismantled and erected along the direct motor road in 1931. (e) With a good car and a driver the time taken to cover the distance between Kuwait and Basra may be reckoned at 4 hours.II. Route from Kuwait Town to Basrah via Q.asr-as-Sabiyah .

At 3-^ miles this track crosses a ridge of sandhills about 360 feet high. It then ascends again to a height of 350 feet at Tg- miles, after which it descends by gentle undulations to 10 miles. From here to Sabiriyah at 21 miles it traverses a low plateau about 100 feet high, of sand and gravel, and affording good camel grazing. Another variation of the route is to leave the road described above the Mughairah in stage 3 and go north-west to Huqaijah in stage 4, thus reducing the total distance by about Tj miles. III.

A considerable village in the Kuwait Principality, situated near the foot of the Kuwait Bay, about 2 miles inland, 40 feet above sea le*¥l, and distant 20 miles by road from Kuwait Town: It is the chief and almost only seat of agriculture in Kuwait territory. Situation . Jahrah stands in an open plain of sand sprinkled with camel grazing, 5^ miles to the south east of the gap in the Zor hills, known as the Mutla f Pass, through which caravans from Kuwait to Basrah by the direct route pass. The desert rises gradually from the village towards the west and south west. One mile to the north of the village is a plain called Muraitibah on which Bedouins camp in the summer; it is riddled with wells containing water at a depth of 12 feet. The flew trees about Jahrah, except the dates belonging to the village, are either tamarisks or bers. The air of the place is dry and the climate healthy. £efences . Jahrah is commanded at artillery ranges by the ZOR hills, and, owing to the shoal water at the foot of Kuwait Bay, the place could not be effectively supported by naval fire. The Shaikh of Kuwait has a fortified residence, known as the Qasr-al-Ahmar or Red Fprt from the colour of its walls, on the south east side of the village outside the limits of culti vation, but only separated by a roadway from the nearest garden. It is about 80 yards square, and has towers over the doorway., which faces north west, and at the four corners. The walls are fifteen high and two feet thick at the top, the towers being about eight feet higher. There is no well,of good water inside the fort. It was in this fort that the late Shaikh Salim of Kuwait took refuge with a v out 600 men after the defeat of the Kuwait force by Faisal-as-Dawish and his Ikhwan inin October 1920, and had the latter not withdrawn he would doubtless have been forced to surrender by lack of water. There were then high garden walls, since demolished, right up to the roadway opposite the fort which afforded the Ikhwan excellent cover from view and some cover from fire. The fort contains stabling for about a hundred horses, and its chief use now is as a place for the Shaikh r s brood mares and young stock. Jahrah was entirely evacuated for some weeks after the battle referred to above, and when it was reoccupied a wall was built round the village itself, which is situated a little over half a mile to the north west of the Qasr-al-Ahmar, a few outlying houses being demolished to render its shape suitable. The village is roughly rectangular in shape, about 400 yards long by 300 broad, with its longer sides facing the south west and north east. The wall is fifteen feet high, and has a square tower to afford flanking fire at each corner, and another in the centre of each face. It is loop-holed for rifle fire through but the loop-holes are so small, and so badly cons tructed that anly a limited field of fire is obtain able. At the time of his death in February 1921, the late Shaikh Salim was intending to build a small fort between Jahrah and the head of the bay to protect the landing place, and enable reinforcements to be brought from Kuwait by sea in the event of Jahrah being besieged, but, with the peace with NAJD, the idea has been anandoned. Population . The permanent inhabitants of Jahrah are mostly cultivators of Najdi extraction, who till the lands possessed here by the Shaikh and various merchants of Kuwait and by the relations of the Naqib of Basrah. The houses about 90 in number, are built of clay and accommodate a population of some 50f) souls.In the summer there are large Bedouin encampments a short distance outside the walls; and even in the winter there are generally some encampments in the vicinity. Agriculture . As the importance of Jahrah is chiefly agricultural, and as most of the cultivation in the Shaikhs dominions is concentrated here, we proceed to give a full account of the place in this aspect. There is no ffexed scale for the division of produce between landlord and tenant. The staple crops are wheat, barley and lucern, the amount of barley being about double that of wheat; the total yield of wheat in a good year is about 120 maunds only. The wheat called Hintah or 30wn at the begining of September, and is reaped along with % the barley or Sha T ir the beginning of March. A part of the cereal crops is cut green for fodder as in India, and is called Qasil ; the barley is sometimes twice cut for this purpose before it is allowed to mature, but the young wheat is rarely so treated except in unusually good years. The lucern called Jathth or, more rarely, Qatt J&lt;2-3 , is of excellent quality, and is cultivated on the same ground for four years, after which the plot is left Hailah for one year. Other crops are the musk melon or Batikh and the water melon or Raqi Jy which are sown once a year, tipen about the end of October, and continue in season for nearly a month; the quantity grown is too small to admit of export to Kuwait town. The pumpkin or Qara somes in at the beginning of December, lasts for three - i months, and is exported to Kuwait. Beans or Baqilla u (pronounced Bajilla) &gt;V ^ ripen in February, but the crop is small and only sufficient for village require ments. The onion or Basal is ready at the end ofof Bficember and continues till spring. The radish, called Ruwaid ^yy begins early in the year and * •• outlasts the onion. The leek or Baqal is sown afresh every year; it is cropped like lucern and yields 16 crops in the season. Clover or Halbah and « cress or Rashad j are small and short-lived crops; these herbs are only used for seasoning. The brinjal or Bahriyan O L; -&gt; V ' the bindi or Eamiyah and the tomato ▼ which has no Arabic name - come early in the year and do not last long, but are exported to Kuwait Town. There are about 2500 date trees at Jahrah producing about 600 maunds of dates per annum; practically the whole of the fruit is eaten as Ratab, that is, in the yellow or semiripe state. The date plantation of Saiyid Khalaf, a relation of the Naqib of Basrah, is considered the best. Only about 50 tons of grain are exported yearly to Kuwait Town, but the agriculture of Jahrah might be greatly extended if more capital were sunk in it. Irrigation. The crops enumearted above are mostly irrigated and are grown in enclosures formed by low clay walls - some of these walls were formerly eight or nine feet high, but were lowered after the battle of Jahrah in October 1920, as part of the scheme for the defence of the place. These gardens are mostly on the south east side of the village, between it and the Q,asr&lt; al-Ahmar. A little of the wheat and barley is grown by rainfall alone, but the area of such cultivation is very small compared with the rest. The water for irri gation is brackish; it is raised in skins by donkeys which pull,by walking down an inclined plane that slopes away from the well. There are 19 large wells with an average depth of 20 feet. The Shaikh of Kuwait has a windmill to raise water for the irrigation of hishis garden next the Q,asr-al-Ahraar. A water lift is water from the well head to the crops are Saqiyah V Sometimes th^e water raised is collected in a reser artificial hollows where water collects are known as terrace on which irrigation water is allowed to spread before being let go to a lower level. Agricultiral terms . Late grown crops are described is land either situated on the ddge of a Khabrah or watered only by rain; Hazam s or stony ground; and tive. The commenest implements of agriculture are a rudimentary plough, called If dan ) an iron spade, called i’akhin , used in making, repairing, open- * ing and closing water channels; and a wooden rake or hoe staff to prevent sheep and goats from straying, or to scare birds from growing crops.

There are several wtlls from which the gardens are irrigated.A small village in the QARA- t AH distirfct of the Kuwait Principality, situated on a low bank of east- sand about 200 yards from the sea and 6 miles^south- east of Kuwait Town. The village contains a mosque and twenty five houses, and is now permanently inhabited. In addition to the permanent inhabi tants, there are usually several families of T AWAZIM. The inhabitants are all 1 AWAZIM and earn their livelihood by fishing, chiefly by means of Hadhrahs or tidal weirs on the beach. A few donkeys and some poultry belong to the village. There are a number of wells, but only a few hold water, which is slightly brackish. —______—ABU HULA. IF AH A coast village in the f ADAN district of the Kuwait Principality, lying about 21^ miles south- south- east of the town of Kuwait; it MHi*±Hxxx consists of 49 houses end is inhabited by Arabs of miscellaneous origin. There are about 1000 flourishing date palms and 30 wells containing good water at about 20 feet; but of the latter only 7 yield water for irrigation. Barley, melons, and a few vegetables are grown and some Sidar or ber trees are seen. As mentioned in the article on ’ADAN, this is one of the villages known as Q,USUB to which the townsmen of Kuwait resort at certain seasons of the year.FUHAIHIL A coast village in the 'A: AIT District of the Kuwait Principality, 24^- miles south-south- east of Kuwait Town. It consists of 61 houses and has 20 wells of good water about 18 feet deep. There are some 200 date palms, and some cultiva tion of wheat, barley and melons, irrigated from the wells. The inhabitants, who belong to various Arab tribes, own some flocks of sheep and goats. As mentioned in the article on ’ADAN, Fuhaihl is one of the villages known as Q,USUR to which the townsmen of Kuwait resort at certain seasons.SHU* AI BAH. A small coast village of the 1 ACAN district in the Kuwait Principality, being one of those included in the name QUSUR; it is situated 27 miles south-south-east of Kuwait Town. It consists of only four permanently inhabited houses, but there are several Hotahs or enclosures with lodges in them which are occupied from time to time, also a fort which is a favourite resort of Shaikh Jabir as-Subah. There are 10 wells containing good water at B feet, about 150 date palms, a few sidar or ber trees, and a little cultivation of barley and vegetables. The inhabitants own one or two boats. The place is to some extent a country resort for the townsmen of Kuwait.UMM JUNAIB. A general term including the districts of KABD, c^ARA’AH and ’ADAN of the Kuwait Principality, also those of SALU, HUB AIM and the northern portion of SUDAHin the undeter mined territory (too the south of it. It is hounded on the east by the sea, and on the north by the Kuwait Bay and on the south by the Dhila*-al-MU’AIJIL. This is the generally recognised meaning of the name. Some people, however, maintain that Umm Junaib is a small separate district, somewhat higher that Huzaim and to the west of it, and of LABI3AH, containing the hill of JJ and the wells of Shadhaf &lt;- * and ' b ^j &gt; Ruhaiyah Y/afrah.UM al KHITAN A small tract in the Kuwait Principality; it lies between the district of YAH on the east and that of SHIQAQ on the west, and is at the extreme x north-west of the recognised territory of Kuwait• It is about 8 miles in diameter, and is situated perhaps 25 miles north-v/est of Jahrah.mxita: line KADHIMAH \/ The innermose cove (Dohat Kadhimah) of Kuwait Bay, to the west of the Has ’Ushairij: also a point (Ras Kadhimah) which projects into the same cove from its north side. The cove shoals gradually from its entrance, where it is 4 miles broad and 6 fathoms deep in mid channel, to its head, which is 9 miles west by south of Ras T Ushairij and within 2 miles of the village of Jahrah. There is an anchorage well sheltered from the Shamal, which would accom odate a large number of ships of 24 feet draught; but there is no deep water close to the shore, and cargo would have to be worked in lighters, or a large pier fe built. Ras Kadhimah is a low swampy point running out some 3 furlongs southwards into the cove at about 3 miles from its head: it is hardly above sea level, but it is partially protected by a natural bank of sand which follows the highwaterQ.URAIN 6 :^ Frequently pronounced Grain. (1) A small barren islet in Kuwait Bay, also called mile off shore at a point 4 miles to the west of Kuwait town. Towards its south end is a small brown coloured mound 27 feet high. On the south east of the island, beteen it and the shore is a * \ ) « small basin called Bandar-ash-Shuwaikh where native boats may ride, perfectly sheltered from all winds, in 3 to 4 fathoms of water. This harbour is connected with the open bay by a long, narrow gut, which over a distance of 400 yards carries only 12 to 13 feet of water at low spring tides: the obstruction appears to be of rock which could not be very easily removed. 'Grains', the old English name for Kuwait Town, was probably taken from this island. (2) The name of a small isolated hill, of a khor or depression, and some wells, all situated in the southern extremity of Kuwait territory, on the boundary between it and the Salu* district. The hill is a little over 40 miles south of Kuwait Town and about 14 miles from the sea coast. The Khor or depression lies to the north and east of the hill, between it and the sea; it measures about six miles in each direction and is overgrown with grass and bushes. In spite of the fact that it is called a Khor or inlet, it appears to have no comniurication with the sea and its drainage is said to sink into the ground. Jazira t-a sh-Shuwaikh about half aQASR AS SIRRAH (HISHRIff) A fort belonging to the Sheilchnof Kuwait, situated in the Qara f ah district eight miles south-south east of Kuwait Town. It was built in 1900 by it Shaikh Mubarak, who frequently used/as a residence. The fort is oblong and pleasures 150 by 120 feet; there is a tower at each corner. The walls are of mud faced with juss, 12 feet high and 2 feet thick and are loopholed. The only entrance is in the north face. The fort, which is now in rather bad repair, stands at an elivation of 180 feet above the sea upon the highest of half a dozen low hills, and forms a conspicuous landmark both bynland and sea. It is supplied with water from wells 60 to 70 feet deep, and the water is both good and abundant. About 12 miles south and slightly east of Sirrah are the wells of Thamilat-as-’ Atul ( 50 called from a family of the f Ajman tribe) of which the water is always sweet.AL Q.USUR A name applied to the villages of FAliTAS, FUHAjf IHIL, Abu HULAIFAH and SHU'AIBAH in the 1 ADAM district of the Kuwait Principality.AL AD AN o LaM A district in the principality of Kuwait, enclosed between the district of Qara’ah on the north, that of Shaqq on the west, that of Salu on the south.

The f Adan district contains the only relic of antiquarian interest which have as yet been discovered in the Kuwait Principality; these consist of some sacrophagi at a spot 6 miles from Warah hill, from which that hill lies at 258° o and westernmost part of Burqan hill at 214 . The tombs lie east and west and are therefore not lluhammadan; they occupy a plot of high ground about 100 feet square. The sarcophagi are of gypsum cement, about 5 feet long, 1 foot 8 inches broad and 2 feet deep; the thickness of the sides is about 4 inches; they are buried 3 to 4 feet below ground and a large number of stones of irregular shape each about 2 cubic feet in volume, are piled over them. There are no inscriptions. A copper coin found there seemed to be Persian of Baghdad mintage belonging to the 17th or 18th century A.D.

A well known camping ground and watering station in SUIS5AN, about 140 miles south by west, as the crow flies, of KUWAIT Town. It is a main and central halting place for tribes on the move between the coast and the interior in this part of Arabia. There are over 100 wells within a space of about 400 yards square, but ordinarily only a few are in good repair. They are sunk some 28 to 24 feet through sandstone rock and are reputed ancient; their mouths are deeply grooved by the fiction of the ropes with which the water is drawn; the fluid they yield is brackish, and much inferior to the water of Habah wells further to the west-south-west, which are now usually called at in preference to Wabrah by travellers from KUWAIT to RIYADH by the direct route.AL SUI.IMAK i)\/^ ' A huge district, the northern portion of which fells within the territory claimed by the Shai hs of Kuwait. It lies between the SAHANAH desert on the west and the districts of DIBDIBAH and SHAQQ, the Abu Dhuhair hills and the Taff hills in Hasa on the east. Sumnan extends from the lattitude of HAKAR-al-Batin on the north to the route between RIYADH and HOFUF on the south, and possibly beyond; its length from north west to south-east is thus at least £40 miles. It is divided h&amp;lf way betw en the extreme points mentioned by the direct route from KUWAIT to RIYADH; and its breadth, which at this point is 90 miles, diminishes southwards to about 20 miles at the place where the road between RIYADH and HOFUF crosses it. Entered from the Kuwait side by the direct route to RIYADH the Summan is at first a confused region of earthy mounds and flat-topped sandstone hills, through v/hich run shallow winding valleys that in spring are brightened here and there by wild flowers, grass and shrubs. Further on the hills become more entangled, and further on again the country becomes more open; the valleys, broad and flat-bottomed, run with winding courses almost north and south, while the hills, low, level and less irregularly disposed, are frequently ribanded near their bases with brick- colour or, when their form is conical, exhibit brick- red in their summits. A barren and glaring tract follows and is succeeded by a second labrynth of valleys, but the aspect of the country is now milder. The last 20 miles, as the western border of Summan is approached, consists of broken ground with patches of grass and brushwood; it gradually opens into undulating plains, with outcrops of sandstone, whichwhich end abruptly at the sandy barrier of DAHANAH. On the RUYADH - HOFUF road the Summan presents towards the west scarped and embayed cliffs from 50 to 100 feet high, and on this parallel the central portion consists of bare plains, reaching to the horizon and strewn with gravel and small stones, that afford no fuel and no grazing for camels-* After good rain there is admirable pasture throughout the greater part of the Summan, better than that of the DAHANAH. The com ion brushwood of the tract is a kind of wild myrtle; and sour sorrel, said to have been introduced by the Turks in HASA, is abundant. In spring wild parsley and various wild flowers are seen. The Arabs who encamp in Summan are nearly all Mutair but towards the south end there are some f AJMAN who occupy it in common with the MUTAIR. The tract is visited also by by the Eani KHALID, QAHTAN and SABAI’. The best knwon wells are those of WABRAH, HABAH &lt;V u&gt; , Q,ar T ah and Saf ah x? •AL PHI LA' AL IIJ'AIJIL A low range of hills in the undetermined territory between the principality of Kuwait and Hasa, running east and west between the Hamdh wells in the Sudah cistrict and the Safah wells in Summan.

Also more rarely called Butain 0^7 . The final and lower section of the great Wadi-ar-RUMMAH, of which the middle and upper course lies in NAJD. According to some authorities the name is given to the entire length of the valley from QASIM downwards, but the more general usage is to distingui the portion lying in the DAHANAH as the 'tfadi-al-Mustawi, and to call the lower portion only BATIN. It mayr therefore be said to start from about 70 miles south-west of HAFAR; from HANAR it runs for 60 miles north-eastwqrds to RIQA’I* and from RIQ4. T I it continues in the same direction for about 103 miles further to the Ratk Ridge, 37 miles from Basrah, where it ends. The Batin is generally a well-marked depression, varying \ in breadth from 6 miles ( as at HAFARj to 2 miles ( As at RIAQ/I ) ; near its end at Ratk it is very broad and shallow The actual bottom or bed of the valley measures about 3 mile across at HAFAR, but it is normally much less, and for some distance above RIQA T I its width does not exceed half a mile; it shows no signs of water action, but it is covered with a level deposit of dark coloured clay which may have been gradually washed down from the higher ground on either side. The level bed bears large patches of low scrub, which give cover to gazelle and bustard. The routes from Basrah and Kuwait to QASIM run along the Batin, the latter joining in at RIQA'I. In the following table the principal features of the Batin are enumerated and are described in descending order Name. Position. Nature. Remarks.

Its total length is about 100 miles, and its breadth is perhaps 50.AL HAFaR. An important halting place and group of wells in the BATIN section of the Wadi-ar-RUIIMAH. Halter lies about 160 miles west-south-west of Kuwait Town. The wells are about 40 in number, but at the present time only 11 are *alive', that is to say, yield water. They are scattered in the bed of the BATIN, which here forms a circular plain about 3 miles in diameter, at intervals of from 100 yards to a quarter of a mile apart; each well is in the centre of a mound, about 10 feet high, which has been formed by the soil removed from it. The wells are lined with rough stone masonry 6 feet across at the top, their average depth is and are about/150 feet to the water, but if left undist bed for a time the level rised by about 30 feet. The water they contain is almost tepid, and in the chilly air of the morning vapour can be seen rising from their mouths. South by east from the wells, between them and the right bank of the BATIN, is a long, low, sandy hill. No firewood is available in the immediate vicinity and the only fuel at hand is camel dung. The Mutair, and occasionally other tribes, make use of these wells, and they would be more frequented if they were of a less inconvenient depth. Rafar is one of the recognised stages on the route to QASIM via the BATIN from Kuwait Tom and BASRAH. At Hafar two hollows join the BATIN, one from the no-^th and the other from the south; the former is called FULAIJ-ash-SHAJIA.LIYAH ^ and leads to a line of wells styled Atwal-adh-Dhafir lA * running northwards. of which the first is Dulainiyah^A* conducts similarly to a line of having a south- wasterly direction and known as the Atwal-al-l'utalr j&gt;' which the first is Safah ^ in SUIXAN.AL RI^A’X . A group of wells situated in the Batin at a point about 105 miles west-south-west in a directisiB line from Kuwait Town. The wells lie near the south-eastern bank, and are relatively high up above the general bottom of the BATIN depression, so that it is necessary to climb up the bank to reach them. They do not always yield a supply of water, but if there be heavy rain in the spring water is obtainable throughout the summer. The wells are interconnected by subterranean galleries, and the percolation is very slow, so that only a small quantity of water is ever available at a time.C^PT^IK DE QAU.g'S KOTl^ (fl.A.?. ) 01 TH^ BATIU DAT:;:!)' Ktf./AIT. '^'rd' March '1928' . I forward some notes made on al Batin country when accompany ing Carfour to al Riqai recently. At mile 30 from Aobair the ground known as ar Rahah is entered an area of few bushes. The Batin is hardly percep tible but with every mile to the south becomes more marked as a valley until from Jarishan it is easily followed as such. The sandy waddies which cut through the sides of the disappear valley ioDt^sm/before reaching the actual valley bottom and conseuqently the best track for heavy vehicles is down the very centre. This runs co patatively straight and altthough hummocky and covered with strong r, hamdh Tf bushes has a firm surface. Between Halaibah and Jarishan the ground is known as Umm as Sdairah, a district of thick bushes and herbage. To the west is as katiyahahwhich name should I think replace al I.‘a ti yah ad. To the east is as Ratk a name which appears on some maps but not the new 1/1,000,000 sheet. Al Makhazumah (or al Khazumah) is divided into two ridges the more northerly of which is knwon as al Atshanah and the more southerly as ar Rai-anah. By the latter is a Khabra water hole in which may be foudn 'ater 'or ? little time after rain. The new 1/1000.000 sheet shows Adhaibah instead of Alaibah as formerly which letter according to local informa tion is correct and should be reverted to once more. Ar Ruhail I believe to be father south than it is shown on the map as in actual experience the time taken in reaching it from al Makhazumah v/as far in excess of what was expected. If this is so then iALaibah (Adhaibah) is also probably more to the south than it appears on the map and this was borne out by reaching Abraj al Hibari sooner than was expected. On the north-west side of the valley and approximately 7 miles north of nbraj al Hibari is the well marked hill of Kahzoul (on the 1916 map published under direction of Col.Colonel Sir S. Bur and unnumbered on my copy, a piace name of Mahzu is given in this area but on the wrong side of al Batin). East of al Batin and M&amp;hzoul and about 6 miles from the eastern side of the former is the hill of 3£a&amp;af al Anaq, a very distinct formation from the ground but which I am unable to find marked on any map. At Bissau adh Dhabi as the name indicates a few skins of water may be found,. Some old wells were seen. The new map does not show Shiqaiyah, the area of small waddles running into al Batin on the eastern side immediately above Umm al Hamir. In this area water may be found (see Boute Books which deal with the country to the south from here). The area ad Dibdibbah should I think be shown on both sides of al Batin instead of only the north (large letters) as local information confirms and also Colonel Knox and Captain Shakespeare (see Routes in Arabia page 72 and 74) both say on leaving the Wadi Shaq, coming from Kuwait they entered the Dibdibbah. The most v interesting feature near al Batin in its northern course are the wells of (jALban Shiqqat ibn Zikaih, the only plentiful water in all its upper length. The approximate position is by the 'S' in Shiqqat of Shiqqat ar Rawaisat on the new 1/1,000,000 map. The water is perennial and reached at about 15 feet. About 80 wells have been dug but only 13 are in use, some havin' been found to give bitter water and others having been allowed to choke up. Over 200 tents of Bedouin Arabs were watering there last autumn.S.S.O. (R.A. ?, ) Car RECOI^INAISSAI^Cj] . 33PORT ON B,VriN (1928) . In accordance with instructions S.S.O. proceeded with armoured cars on 11th March 1928 to accompany the reconnaissances in the vicinity of 3 AMAH,HaFAR,UMM RUDHUMMAH and KUWAIT. Topographical . 1. ffin the course of this recco the following points were noted, though no opportunity was found for detailed sketching. HANNIYAH range is throighout its extent a quite cons- u picous feature being a ridge of 80 to 100 feet rising to a plateau. It does not however show clearly from the air. The going is generally good for cars but with soft patches. The name UMM AL BAT does not appear to be known to local Arabs and there is no special feature at this position. KHOR TRANADI and KHOR G-HANIIvI are districts rather than individual features, and the KHOR THANADI apparently starts some 4 miles further north than would seem from the map. 2. SAMAH wells (SAMA on map) are situated at the northern limit of a very extensive lov/ lying plain to which a descent of some 100 feet is mad from the north. This plain extends to the UQUBBA depression. There is no solitary distinctive hillock as indicated on the map but this very fertile plain is bordered to the north and w st by an irregular ridge. At its southerly limits this ridge borders the SHAIB AL AMMAH where it merges into the SHAIB IJQUBBA. Xsatr^ Broad and unusually dry. 3. The Batin ridge though apparently accurately shown in the general features, would appear on the map to be 10 miles too far east. The Batin hollow averages Lg- miles across; is of soft surface covered with pebbles and is grass covered in winter.Position unsuitable for armoured car manoeuvres as it istvW is difficult to emerge from the hollow to the high bordering plateaus owing to the sandy slopes inter- veing* 4. Westward from the SHAIB FUIALJ to the SHA.IB UQUBBA there extends a level plateau with pebbly surface, most of it very fertile in camel and sheep grazing. The surface is ^sgenarlly suited to armoured car manoeuvres, has unlimited areas suitable to the landing of aircraft. Just south of AL JAULT and at a point where the SKAIB UQUBBA takes the name SHAIB FAO is an area of winter rain pools known as HUSNAH and not to be confused with a similar district named HASANA situated as shown on the map. 5. As far as the SHAIB CHARIM the plateau main tains its fertile level characteristics. At this point the country becomes rather more broken and stony. The WADI CHARAM does not form a single well marked water course but is rather a series of water channels the two main courses being in broad hollows bordered by ridges and hillocks XXTDXTX AX, ft*xWOT C and about a quarter of a mile apart. JAADAT AL BASHUK is well defined and is used as the direct route to and from the wells at BASHUK area. Westward from WADI CHARIM the land becomes barren with stones and then wide areas of rocky slabs and boulders. 6. HADIQA is situated in the midst of very difficult and rocky going making slow and wearing progress for the cars. These conditions appear to exist allalong the South Eastern border of the DAHANAH and it is very probably this barrier of rock which pr vents the further drifting of the DAHANAH sand-dunes in this direction. 7. G-oing Northwest towards UMM AR RUDHUMMAH conditions improve and in the vicinity of that place are many spacious level hollows which contain excellentn?- winter grazing for sheep. The hollows are however intersected by stony areas, and ITEM AR RUDHUMKAH wells themselves are in a depression partly surrounded by a bro v en ridge and with three very notable pinnacles of rock near the main group of wells. This rock is of a deep reddish tint with mauve layers. 8. In approaching this place from the south it is noticeable that the MAIJIBYAT ridge seems to be continued northward beyond AL CHAICUB and joins with the ridges surrounding UMM AR RUDHUMMAH wells. The wells appear about 4 miles south of their position as at present shown. 9. From mm AR RUDHUMMAH to U JIB Ik lies a level plateau, with firm surface and good camel grazing, and from UQUBBA southward to the WADI BULAIJ lies a similar plateau but soft in patches. The immediate vicinity of the WiiDI BULAIJ and of the descent into the HAYAR hollow has difficult areas of sand. 10. From the BATIN ridge to the line of the 3S SHAQ, WADI is a level plain fairly fertile in camel grazing, and with a gravelly surface ?/ith occasional sandy patches. The MUSANNAH which appears at least 5 miles south of its marked map location is a definite but not very distinctive feature. Probably it would be undis- tinguishable from the air. It is in appearance a long low mound of a sandy nature with whitish stones upon its surface. Two ancient wells without water were located at a point approximately 10 miles south of the position incorrectly marked as UMM AL AMARAH. Name not known. From the 3S 8HAQ, to the coast extends a district particularly unsuited to armoured cars being of small scattered mounds and entirely of a soft sandy nature.HA?AR. Wells.22.

Hafar wells which are much used by Mutair Arabs and of the Jibain and Braih sections are believed to have been under ob servation by tribesmen throu hout the occupation by the Ar moured Cars. Parties of 7 to 10 men on camels visited the vicinity every night* Apparently they did not draw water except on the first night. The district Shaib Fuiaij - Shaib Uqubba - Shaib Charim - Hadiqa Wells - Uram Ar Rudhmmah Wells - Samah Wells is appa rently deserted in spite of much good grazing being still available. There were traces however, that a small party of Arabs had quite recently visited Uram Ar Rudhummah which district is usually occupied by Harb or Dhafir. The Shammar seldom move further east than the Lina - Aiwij -Anna Amarah line. No encounter took place between cars and hostile tribesmen except on the arrival of the cars at Hafar. On this occasion two prisoners were taken one of whom was wounded. They proved to be Jiblan Mutair. The A-^abs some 15 in number retire from the wells on the arrival of the cars but certain tribesmen directed a persistent fire upon the cars. Eight camels were shot under their riders by machine gun fire. Hafar is not suited to Armoured car action owing to the soft sur face and manoeuvring proving difficult. The prisoners had no new information on the situation and seemed still to believe that a very large force led by Duwish and Ibn Humaid was nearing Hafar. One manl also stated that Duwish disconcerted by air raids and the advance of the cars had persuaded Ibn Lami to agree to his long projected plan for consolidating a Mutair tribal base at Artawiyah. Some confirmation of this seems to have also been reported in Kuwait. Ihilst in Kuwait during the Id celebrations the opportunity was taken at the suggestion of the P.A. to visit the notables of the town in company with S.S.O.Kuwait. Buscol. 26/5/28. Sd.

Dickson. 1933AL SHAQ.ft A long shallow valley perhaps 100 miles long north to south, and on the average about 10 miles broad, forming a district, which for the northern 40 miles or so is within the boundary of the Kuwait Principa lity. On the north it endfe about 20 miles north west of Jahrah; in the south in the neighbourhood of Wurai'an; on the east it is bounded by the dis tricts of KABD and ’ADAN in Kuwait territory, and those of SALU*, HUZAIM and SUDAH to the south of it; on the west by DIBDIBAH; while SUMMAN approaches its south-western corner. Shaqq has no fixed inhabi tants, but yields most of the grass and firewood that are sold in Kuwait Town; in the north it marks the boundary between the Hamdh grazing on the east and the T Arfaj on the west. Where it is crossed by the route from the Ku ait Town to RIQA’I, at 40 miles west-south-west of Kuwait, it contains a Khabrah called Khabrat-al-Faraq ; and similarly on the direct route to Eafar at 54 miles it south-west of Kuwait Town, there is situated in/the Khabrat-ad-Dawish^^-^' . The former of these is within the frontier of Kuwait and the latter is outside it/ FAIAIICAH ISLAND. To British mariners formerly knov/n as * T Pheleechi rT , from the ordinary pronounciation which is Bailachah. An island 7 miles in length, with a maximum breadth of 3 miles lying on the north side of the entrance to Au'.ait Bay: its western end, nearest to Kuwait Town, is about 10 miles east-north-east of Ras-al-Ardh, while its northern end is about 7 miles south-east of the mouth of IChor-as-SABIYAH. Physical characteristics and surroundings . The shape of Pailakah is that of a badly-shaped wedge, having its point to the south-east and its base to the north-west. The Island stands on an extensive flat of mud and sand with rocky patches, whichis called Bharub out stretches south-eastwards from the entfance of Ahor-as- SA3IYAH. Failakah is low, the highest point being a mound 30 feet high in the wst.rmost part; at high spring tides it is broken in upon by the sea, and, not being visible more than 5 or 8 miles, it is frequently not sighted in entering Au ait Bay. Failakah has two: out liers, ’Auhah a small sandy islet about three miles from its south-eastern extremity at the place where the Dharub flat comes to an end, and Maskan or Aaschan as it is pronounced, a low iandy islet on theflat about two miles from Bailakah in the direction of Khor-as- SABIYAH. Inhabitants . Estimates of the population of Failakah vary but there appear to be about 200 men or, say, 500 souls altogether. There is now only one village, TOR on the north-west coast facing Mashjan. Landing at Bor is easy. The place possesses some 30 to 35 boats, smaller on the average than the boats of Kuwait Town, and 15 to 20 Huwairiyahs ^ fishing boats built of date branches. There are several deserted villages on the island; of these Subaihiyah is situated on - ~‘ thei ak the south-western shore, about 2-^ miles from the southern end. One mile beyond Zor is the deserted site of Za f idi Qurainiyah , where there is a house belonging to the Shai’zh of Kuwait, where members of his family some times reside for a short time; this is now, except Zoe, the only inhabited place on the island. The people of Zor, mostly fishermen but a few of them pearl divers, are of mixed origin: the majority are said to have come from the island of KHARAG, but others from Kao, the Hindiyan district, and even Oman. They are civil and welldisposed but superstitious and fanciful, and their condition generally is wretched. Indeed the aspect of the island from every point of view is one of meloncholy but gentle decay. V/ater Supply . Water is found in most parts of thie island at a depth of only six feet; it is better than that' of the wells ratxxdsxitaEx on the outskirts of the Kuvzait Town, and is said to be less brackish near the sea than it is at some distance inland. In the hot weather it turns so salt in some places as to kill lucerne. Fisheries and agriculture . The re ources of Kailakah are fisheries and agriculture on a modest scale. After deduc- the catch of fish is divided into equal shares, of which one goes to the Shaikh of the island, one to the owner of the boat, one to the Captain, and to each of the crew. Wheat and barley are grown with some success on clayey patches. About 6,000 lbs of wheat are said to be sown annually in the whole island, and the total yield of grain is about 50 tons. The produce, after deduction of taxes, is divid d equally between the cultivators on the one hand and the suppliers of the seed, plough-a:imals and food for the animals on the other. The crop is sown ^— ; about a mile further is a similar place calleo * p s ht ; finally in this direction we reach tion of Makalah or the food expenses of the crewsown in October and reaped in April. L'elons are grown, also lucerne and some ordinary vegetables, such as onions, carrots and radishes. There are a few rose tree and some dates; but the latter, which are chiefly towards the south end of the island, are not in a flourishing condition, and the agriculture of Failakah generally is inferior to that of JAHRAH. The Sidar or Ber and the Athl or tamarisk are the principal trees other than dates, but hardly as they are they do not grow without attention. Domestic and other animals . Failakah boasts a fair number of donkeys - these are of two breeds, the small /• brown donkey or hhikari and a larger and better 4 variety, also brown, called locally G-hazal ; O there are also a few flocks and herds and some pultry and about a dozen camels belonging to the Shaikh, Flamingos, pelicans, gulls and flocks of a bird resemb ling the curlew haunt the shore, and the island is said to be visited in the summer by large flocks of sand grouse. There are a number of gazelles, descended from a pair which a member of the Shaikh of Kuwait’s family turned loose some years ago: only members of the Subah family are allowed to shoot them. Admir:istration . Failakah is governed (1921) on behalf of the Shaikh of Kuwait, to whom it belongs, by one of his distant relations. This individual Sa’ud bin Abdullah as-Sa’ud, who is a man of 52 years of age with a considerable amount of negro blood in his veins and partially paralysed in his lower limbs, succeeded his father in the governorship. About one-third of the arable land on Failakah is held Ku’af or revenue free; the remainder pays Sakat to the Shaikhnof Kuwait at the rate of one tenth of gross produce. ’asides this the Shaikh takes for himself all the straw of the island even of revenue free holdings, except a small quantity which the inhabitants are allowed to retain fort&gt;2 for their own necessities. Rich merchants of Kuwait or foreigners are prohibited from settling in Failakah on the ground that they would prob bly o-press the original inhabitants. Sacred places. Failakah is remarkable chiefly for its tombs and shrines. First, there are the graves of the Auliya VJj?' or Saints, who play a large part in the traditions of the island; of these some 60 or 70 are scattered round the village of Zor. Then, about a mile to the south of Zor are the tombs of Sa T d , Sa’id and Sa T idah 0 that of Sa^ is to the east of the others, and the whole group stands up cons picuously as Failakah is approached in a boat from Kuwait. It is principally to visit these tombs said to commemorate two brothers and a sister who were murdered here, that pilgrims from Taman and India, and more frequently from Afghanistan and Baluchistan, visit Failakah t There is another tomb also visited by pilgrims; it is said to be that of a certain IZuhammad-al- Badawi, whose only claim to distinction is that his finger after death resisted the removal of his. signet / ^ ring- La. tly, there is the kucam-al-Khidhr L*-* a T out three quarters of a mile north-east of Zor, which is now a roofless tower threatened by the encroachments of the sea. Persian do ot resort to it but it is frequented by -Arab sailors who come to perorm their vows, made in sickness or in danger at sea, by sacrificing a sheep or a goat by burning incense and by feeding the poor. I.lulsim theologians are not agreed as to whether this Zhidhr was a prophet or not; some of them even deny his existence. Some commentators identify him with the prophet Alias. He is believed to have been alive in the time of Abraham, to have been a companion of Hoses, and to be still alive in consequence of having drunk the water of life. L c&amp;lly it is a tradition that khidhr stepped from a rock in front of what is now the iimerica.nAmerican Mission in Kuwait to the site of this shrine in one step. The shrine of Kidhr is not su much visited by foreign pilgrims as those mentioned before it. Traditions and superstitions . ^urainiyah is said t o have been the seat of a tyrant who wore golden boots: his city was destroyed by God because he cut a child in half to prove the temper of his sword. ^lere is a local tradition supported by traces of good stone ^houses in the middle of the island, but the Tortuguest once occupied Tailakah. They are said to have been driven, first from Dasht and then from the centre of the island to which they retired, by a plague of rats sent upon them by the Auliya. Most of the islanders firmly believe in the existence of a malignant demon, called Bu DaryaL^^&gt; , believed to frequent the sea round the island, especially between it and Maskan and to entice the unwary out of their depth and drown them. ' any also * believe in the Shahu yP^*-** who is d3sc:mbed as being like a woman with donkey’s feet, hands like a con’s fore feet, and hair like a camel, load of brushwood. The Shahu is also said to be found in ku ait Town.Note on the Native Craft of Kuwait (See also General Information (Historial &amp; Administrative about Kuwait).Private letter from Lt-Col..+ore, to Co .mander Yau^han, Secretary to c nior Paval Officer, Persian Gulf. I am returning your ’’Last Lays of Past &amp; Sail” with very many thanks. I have engoyed it immensely, particularly the chapter on the Lateen Sail. It is a great pity that the author was never up the Persian Gulf, as there are some most interesting types of ^rab craft to be seen here, and he has had to rely largely on herarsay. I do not know, for example, whether t&amp;ere is really s , much difference between the Pambuk or Sambuq to give it a preferable spelling, of the Red Sea and that of the Gulf as one T'ould imagine from this book. I personally would not call any of the three boats shown on page 125 a true sambuq , whereas that shown in the Arab drawing facing page 122 obviously is. nrab boats which are for all practical purposes exactly the same but differ in some trivial detail o'ten have different names, and I would not accept the three boats on page 125 as samhugs without corroboration from the ^rab. Very few of the definitions of boats on the bottom of page 122 and the top of page 125 would I accept, but they are avowedly not his own. As you are interested in this sort of thing, I am giving you a few notes on the different kinds of boats to bemet with in this part of the world, which may help you to identify the different types, and tell you what you should look out for if you want to get distinctive photos of them. A considerable change has been introduced in the types of ocean going crai't built in kuwait and elsewhere during the last 35 years or so. Formerly all the largest VEfcfcsifci vessels were of the square sterned type, known as baghalah . Low, however, the largest vessels built are without exception bums . It is claimed for the bam (which type was formerly confined to boats of from 20 to 50 tons) that, v/ith its po nted stern, it is a better sea boat, particularly in a following sea; and also that it has better cargo space. The bum is now the most commonly used type of vessel in the Persian Gulf - at any rate at the top part of it. It is of various sizes,from the harbour lighter of Ku ait to a ship of over 500 tons carrying capacity. It uuaally has two m sts but some of the largest have 3. It is distinguished by its sharp stern, and its long straight stem head, the end of which is usually black with a white ring. Very similar to the bum is the dangiyah , an Indian built vessel occasionally seen in the upper part of the Gulf. For practical purposes it is exactly ali e the larger type of bum, but its stem head resembles that of a shu T ai. Being an Indian boat too, it not unfrecuently is brightly painted instead of being oiled. The balam also closely resembles a bum of the smaller type, xcept that its stem head is si ply cut off flush with less of a point than that shown on page 137 of the book. There is moreover not: ing peculiar about its steering gear. The balam (or to give it its full name, balam nassari , to distinguish it from the : Im. a:Lari seen in Basra) is always Iraq o ,r ned but plies as far as Kuwait. The b&amp;ghlah is a large vessel, able to carry from 80 to 300 tons of cargo. There is formerly said to have been a 500 ton baghla in the Gulf, but there is no ^rab vessel of that size afloat now.Very similar to the ba^hla is the kutiyah , an Indian built vessel, but frequently seen in the northern part of the (half. It is exactly the same as the bauhla except that its stem has a peculair device, rather like a bird T s head with the beak pointing back, instead of the baghala t s plain knob. The ghunchah is said to be exactly the same as a small baghala but have never actually seen one, so cannot vouch for the accuracy of the statement. The picture of the ’ T ghan.ia” is certainly not the least like a beyha la . The sambuq is preeminently the pearling boat of the Gulf, in fact it is rarely used for other purposes, though a few are used in the local carrying trade. Its square stern is said to make it more suitable for the frequent pulling round by oars that is required at the pearl banks, than is a boat of the bum type, 'hich is hardly ever seen there except as a ^sdtsjex dealer’s boat. It has two masts and usually is completely decked. Its stem head is its distinguishing feature (in which no variation is allowed) as too its square stern. The shu T ai is normally smaller than the sambuq th' ugh some are qui e as big. The c ly real difference between the two is that the stem head of the sambuo is plain, whereas that of the shu T ai has a step in it. In all other respects they are identical. Large shu’ais are used for pearling, and small ones as fishing boats. In the latter c se they have only one mast. The jalibaut , or .jali as it is sometimes called, is anoth-,r square stemed boat of somewhat more European appearance. Its name is commonly supposed to be merely the English .jolly-boat but I doubt very much if this is really the case. The start with what is the derivation of our holly-boat ? Is it not probable that both the English and Arabic names are derived from galievat or gellywatte . the name of a shallow draught war-boat, which continued to be in use on the west-coast of India down to the latter half of the XVIII Century, and which in turn almost certainly comes from the Portuguese galeota - c-f-yi galley . It is inter sting to note that though square sterned like the sambuq and Shu’ai , there is this difference that in the case of the sambuq and shu’ai there is an outside upright beam ( I do not know its technical name) onto which the rudder is hinged, and in the case of the jalibaut there is* not. In Lorimer’s ’’Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf' the mashuwah is given as a special type of boat. If this is correct I do not know what the difference between a mashuwah and .ialibaut is: I have certainly heard the rsame boatspoken of by both the names by a man who ought to know. Possibly mashuwah is a more or less vague term like our boat. r ^ le b atil is one of the most peculiar and dis tinctive boats in the Gulf, with its fiddle shaped prww structure and its high and quaintly ornamented stern - in the pattern of which no variation is allowed. It is said to be a very fast boat, and was formerly much used by pirates. As a type it is now getting rare, at any rate at this end of the Gulf. Here in Kuwait there is now only one batil t a fine two masted boat, used for pearling. The baoarah is an ultra clipper bowed boat, somewhat like the batil . It has \he same high ornamented stern; but it lacks the fiddle shaped ornament at the prow. It has usually two masts, except on the Persian Coast, where it has sometimes only one. It is rarely seen on the northern end of the Gulf, and there is only one in Kuwait owned baqara h - and it is at Pailakah Island. The zaruqa h is said to be a small one -masted bagarah , but I have never met one in real life, and &lt;x nnot vouch for the accuracy of the statement. The badan also I have never seen, as it doesdoes not exist up this end of the Gulf. It is said to be the same as a small bagarah , exceut that it is -lat- bottomed. The huri is the little dug-out ofton carried by Arab vessels. No description of Guld boats would be complete without mentioning the huwairiyah , which is probably one of the most promitive boats in the world. It is made entirely of date stalks tied together with string. In form it follows the lines of an ordinary boat, and is pointed at both ends. They are usually about 10 feet long and carry one, or sometimes, two men. I have asked manyvArabs what the word ohow is, but none of them have heard of it at all. One frequently hears people - particularly at Bushire and Ganavah - talking about muhailahs, apparently as a generic name for Arab or Persian craft. nis is nuite wrong. The muhailah is a very distinctive type o.u river craft. It is 50 to 80 feet long, with abeam nearly one third of its length. It is built with a tremendous sheer, giving the midship portion a free board of barely a foot, while the gunwale at bow and stern is ten to twelve feet above the water. I hope you may find the above notes of interest to you.PREVAILING WINDS AT KIT7AIT Approximate Period. Name.

By Lieut-Colonel H.R.P. Dickson. 1933I Note on the ^Drin^in^ water rt available in Ku.ait. v/ith special reference to the Heeds of Military and Navc:l 'orces rr . The Sharniyah wells consist of nearly six hu dred small wells. They are situated in several groups but the actual v;ells are in some cases only a few feet apart. They are not lined, and are mostly under a yard in diameter. The wells vary considerably in yield and quality; and also, to some extent, in accordance with the seasons of the year - some becoming rather brackish towards the end of the summer. Cne recently tested was forty feet deep, and had two feet of water, yielding forty five gallons - which, however, soon refilled. In former years these wells used to supply practically the entire population of Kuwait with water, but, with the great increase in population under Shaikh Mubarak’s rule, they began to prove insufficient, particularly after a scanty rainfall. The rainfall during the winter of 1907-1SOS was particularly bad, and in the summer of 1908 the water problem became acute. It occurred to one boat owner to try importing water for sale from the Shatt al-Arab, and, as it was found that water so brought could be sold cheaply and yet return a good profit, a regular fleet of water carrying boats has gro?ra into existence. At the present day there are forty five boats, of the type known as bum employed exclusively in this trade. Of these an average of six / arrive daily, each v/ith about 8,000 gc lions of water, worth roughly Pm. 100/. More people now drink imported river water than water from the Shamiyah //ells, as, in view of the carriage from the latter, they '‘ind it cheaper to do so. There would probably be sufficient water available from the Shamiyah wells to supply any force likely to be stationed in _.uwait # ^.s in the case of the townspeople, however, transport has to be con sidered and it might be more comweneint and economicaleconomical to use imported water. (II) Imported water - from the Shatt al-Arab near ?ao not from Basrah - is always bamlr.ble in reasonable quantities and could be brought in larger quantities without any trouble - boats being brought to any part of the foreshore desired. No pumps or piping are available, as the water is always landed from the boats in skins or kerosine oil tins. Large numbers of locally made wooden tanks are available. (III) One or two wells at Sirrah used to give good water, but the water is now indifferent. Probably better water would be obtained if a new well was dug there. (IV) During the Spring of 1928 the Shaikh of Lohammerah made a palace of his, situated outside the townbut inside the walls, available for the use of the Naval landing parties, and it proved to be sufficient to accommodate two hundred and fifty officers and men. This would presumably be available again, but there are practically no other suitable buildings inside the walls. The Royal Air force officers and men recently occupied some buildings outside the wall, which were originally intended as wireless buildings, but never used as such, and are now used as a Quarantine Station for the town, and they proved sufficient for their needs. for troops tents would, of course, be suitable during the winter months, but from Nay to October British troops at any rate would be better in huts. No hutting materials are available in Nuwait itself, but it would be easy to import reeds from Iraq to make the excellent type of hut, known as serifah . Men to make them would also have to be brought from Iraq50MH RAIJtfoM NOTES, POINTS, AND THOUGHTS KU'.VSIT though its Indian population (-un-fr*-! tite orGmi.in.g j ^£.—^he RmrcT^ hao b^w small, has always been a port of importance for the distribution of Indian goods, the consumption of which has steadily increased in recent years. It is true that Indian merchants have never established themselves at Kuweit, and the only activities actually carried on by inidK Indians in the town today are a few small tailoring establishments, and one general store. But the reason for this is simply that the Euweiti has always been in the forefront of Ahe Arab business world, and instead of the Infilan coming to Kuweit seeking business, the Arab of Kuweit goes to India himself and brings the business from there. This is an old condition of affairs, but its importance does not lessen. Hardly a big business house in Kuweit does not have at least one member of its family either in Bombay or Karachi, in a permanent establishment, and indeed in recent years the Kuweiti have looked farther and farther afield - to Colombo, Madras, Calcutta e crr-3-i-ngi. norA business in their wake. Kuweit has traditionally looked to Iraqi rlantations in which its wealthy families are interested (and largely hold), but as the place fromwhich its rice, its tea, its sugar, almost its every kind of foodstuff, building material, and even household need must oe imported. Of some 150 large Kuweit booms wh/ich annually make long voyages from the nort, figures show that 150 s^ail to ^Indian ports and 4 to, a* / »■ ■ m ***&amp;*-,**. ev/TTer^ the V/m ZffYfgrb? t. h r hrinp ^i-i^ ^ i■■ i t - rice, sugar, ioodstuffs, piecegoodsA timber for housebuilding and shipbuilding, sail- thev tradem are astute traders, and they bring good 'JLt j India not only as the best market for/the dates from themi Kuweit and India Page 2 cloth, roping-stuffs, s:nall canoes, furniture. In Kuweit the building of dhows is still a very live and even a growing business. (This week the keels of four new large booms have been laid.) Kuweit is a good port, and a center admirably suited both for the storage of goods and for their infiltration into other areas. The climate is the best in the northern end of the Persian Gulf; the harbour is as good as can be found in the same area; the inhabitants are friendly, honest, and peaceloving* import duties are very low; and the tov/n is the natural outlet, and trade center, for a considerable area of north-eastern and northern Arabia and for much of northern ITejd. A few years ago, much of the trade with Nejd was disrupted because of the difficulties with King Ibn Saud, who desired to establish his own customs facilities at Kuweit; but the ban then imposed unon llejd trade with Kuweit has now been lifted and normal trading is fast being re-introduced. This condition of affairs,** for some years, caused a deilinu in the imports of staples s ch as rice and sugar; but that is a condition now ended^^^a** 0 ven whi 1 e it lasted, Luveit’s inroorts of other Indian goods increased. The reason for this is the simnle one that in recent years - very recent years - ohe standard of living in Kuweit has improved tremendously, ana it is stil-i improving. Kven in the short space of the last rive years, the differences which have come to Kuweit have Dcen astonishing. Kuweiti have long been in contact, through tneir leading merchants, with the nearer outside world - with Basra, with Bomoay and Karachi, even with Damascus and Syria. But for many years there seemed almost no receptivity to new ideas at all; and nothing changed very much. It is tha.t conuioion which has so surprisingly altered, bringing with its alteration an imrrtrfcved standard of living, a demand for more ana different tyres of goods - a demand which ought to be cultivated and trained. Pive years ago, there was scarcely a decently dressed im n in Kuweit, for all v’ore the time honoured BeduinT^iirt, with its wide sleeves and its oreast pocket for funds: even a coat was a rare sight. How it is rare indeed to see a Kuweiti (other than the Bedu who flock to tneKuweit and India Page 3 town in the summer inonths) who does not include., in his ordinary street wear, at least one garuent of muronean origin? those who go habitually to India and Iraq in these days are becoming accustomed to keening suits of good materials in their wardrobes. As in their persons, so also with their houses. The old unfurnished domiciles of mud walls ana mangrove poles are largely going: now houses are oeing built better srsi and better (with a corresnondingly rising market for building materials). In thi3 respect the intlux? of ideas from india is very striking. Now many Kuweit merchants have their aoors and orasswork, and all their furniture, made for them in India ana brought here in oheir dhows, or by the 3.T. steamers. In any Kuweit home of the better class (and the number of families belonging to the better class steadily increases) one finds Indian wardrobes, instead of the old brassbound Arab chests; Indian chairs, desks, bedsteads: Indian matting on the floors v as a foundation ior the Persian and Turkish carpets): Indian occasional tables; Indian mirrors, Indian wall decorations. All of this is a striking change. It took the Kuweiti a long time to make up his mind to change - or to spend any money at all, ior that matter - but now he has changed. It would be the wrong time, indeed, tnen, to abandon him. Ntx This is a market which, properly tended now, must develop into some thing really worth while; i.or Kuweit’s importance is more likely to increase than diminish. Another new development - of 'which only the beginnings are now evident _ was orougat about^by iusuf Murzook, one of the leading merchants in the Indian trade. This merchant had snent much time in India, and thereioi^, v/hen he wished to build himseli a new aome, ne not only brought all the materials from India but the artisans ao well. With their aid, he bu.lt himself a tine re w house in a. conspicuous position on the waterfront: tnis -as little floor, a a ot&gt; It is a handsome house, with fine more than a year ago.Kuweit and India 4 straight lines, well laid out rooms, an intelligent use of the broad area of the roof, good fittings, good doors, good brasswork - even some plumbing. This house opened the eyes of the other merchants of Kuweit and began a spu rfTof re building their own houses, the results of which have been astonishing. Almost in every street now, a handsome new house takes rapid shape - a house with found ations , a house which will not lose half its walls at the first hard rain, a house with well-laid out roo.is, each with its bathroom, (oalv a xhswsr tub-shower nlace; but a good beginning), its sijgtE electric light, its fans, its furniture. As with the better-off, so also with the poor, and these llso are trying to improve their housing, For them it must be admitted that it is a difficult thing to do, for Kuweit still is peopled by a vast majority of poor labourers who count themselhes fortunate if they can earn One rupee a day. It is these people who buy the SaKensgzra Japanese rubbish in the bazaar: but they also can be educated and a start has been made. One must say again that it seems hardly the time to throw away the good work which India has puo inoo the development of this territory, just when it is likeliest to oear fruit. . . To summarise, then, Kuweit is becoming, and will continue to become an increasingly important market, uhe real possibilities of which have scarcely yet oeen jfaoped. rintL i :- iiHiimi nil i n r '’ Tn 1 - M yr ^ The Kuweiti have looked always to India as their natural market, both to buy and sell (existing conditions both in Iraq and Iran tend to concentrate development in India, more and more, for both Iraq «nd Iran nave long pursued policies which, whatever other effects they might have had, have not been .good for their external trade), fith the development of oil, the return of the Nejd trade, better earnings from their important shipping industry, and the general improvementKuweit and India 5 of their living conditions and consequent growing demand for more and more goods, it is obvious that if Indian trade and co;nrnerce with this port do not increase then the fault can oe laid to alone. . . There is just one further point which occurs to me, at this stage; and that is that we do get some loyalty, some proper conception of a properly ordered political life, from our Indian reople; and the more of them who can spread this doctrine at the present juncture the better will it be for our own general interests - and the interests of peace - here. 'But if we get loyalty from Indians, so also do the Arabs watch closely what we do in India as it is seen there, and reflected here; I cannot help thinking that the present would be a very bad time t indeed, not only from the commercial viewpoint, to set about any changes even if for some reasons they might otherwise seem desirable.PRIVATE a nd GOinTIVElTriRL A REPORT on the BOOMS of KUY/EIT According to figures supplied to me by tone chief of the customs department at Kuweit tv/o weeks ago, thee are 104 long-voyage sailing-ships registered at Kuweit. Since that date, tv/o more have been launched, so that now there are 106. (The accuracy of these figures is by no means certain: but I have counted them mys elf and they appear about right.) Of the 106, only three are bgggalas. All the rest are booms. About tv/enty of them are usually engaged in the East African trade, and all the others voyage to India. In addition to this 80-odd which sail to India and do nothing else, there are from 1^ to 20 of the larger, better water booms wijiich make Indian voyages during the winter, when there is less demand for fresh water from Kao. ITo v/ater-booms go down to Africa. The average tonnage of these deepsea booms is about 110 tons, but they range from 60 tons to perhaps 250: their capacity is always spoken of locally as so many packages of Basra dates, and the largest can stow 5000 packages. There is only one boom now with such a capjeity, and few others able to load 4,000. a boom of Even/3,000 packages in these days is considered a large vessel, for it has proved uneconomic to run these very large booms. The raer hants do not like them (this was pre-war) for when they come in, with their great cargoes, they usually spoil the market. The average cost of a well-constructed boom, though not necessarily with all first-class timber, works out -- again prewar -- at about 4 Rupees a package of dates for the smaller vessels, up to 5, 6, and even 8 rupees a package for the larger. That is to say, a fair building price for a boom such as Ali Kejdi’s, loading 2300 packageBooms Report Page 2 would be about 14000 Rupees, and this v&amp;xfr is about what she cost. A new boom launched yesterday, with a capacity of 2000 packages, cost 10000 Rupees: that is for the hull alone. 7ith her masts and sails, and longboat and a couple of old bower anchors and so forth, she will cost about 12000 rupees. A big boom such as the Samhan (nakhoda Abdul V/ahhab bin Isa al-Oitami; now an exile in Basra, while his brother Yusuf commands the boom), which can stow about 5000 packages of dates, cost -- as far as I can discover -- some 40,000 rupees. Booms are always built of teak and other woods brought up from Malabar. Usually merchants who own booms bring their own timber, store it in their own yards, and hire shipwright- carpenters by the day when they wish to build. The outsider would always find building more expensive. Booms are usually owned by the bigger merchants, and even though many of them are registered in the names of their nakhodas or the families of their nakhodas, it is invariably the merchants who are the real owners -- at any rate, they put up the money. It often suits them to allow the nakhodas to act as owners, for in this way they get better work from the nakhodas, and more profit -Kr from the booms.^'Tgiere a nakhoda is the alleged owner/ of a boom, there invariably exists a structure of debt and subterfuge almost impossible to see through: the nakhodas do not seem to mind. Take, for instance, the case of the family of Ali bin Nassir Uejdi. This family, a Uejd family without much sibstance, holds now two large booms in the African trade. The larger, the boom Bayan , cost some 14000 rupees new. The smaller, which is commanded by Abdulla the brother of Ali, cost 10000 rupees, bought this year at the age of perhaps six or seven years. Practically the whole of this 24,000 rupees was put up by the firm of Khalid Abdul-latif al- Hamad and Bros., date and general merchants, plantation owners, financiers, and whatbots in Kuweit, Basra, Aden,Booms Report 3 and Berbera, Exactly how the merchants are reimbursed for the money they have advanced I have been unable to discover, but I know that they are reimbursed, and that handsomely. Ali Uejdi is a good nakhoda and a good business man, and in two African voyages h^D boom had earned her entire cost. I know »nl-y that he did not receive much from these sums. The average earnings of a Kuweit boom, by the way, are supposed to equal her cost, each voyage -- that is, her gross earnings, hat is done with these gross earnings I shall come to later. Usually - such is the way business is done in Kuweit - the more booms a nakhoda or a nakhoda’s family thinks it owns, the more is the nakhoda or his family in some merchants debt. But this fact never seems to bother them, for debt is no burden anyv/here in Arabia, as far as I can see. '''Hki- $ tOr Oi ^ Booms in the Indian traae take dates from Basrah to Karachi or to Bombay, sometimes, and come back direct with rice or grain, or general cargoes: many of their voyages are direct and clear-cut. Others take dates and sell them along the lesser ports} finally, with the riroceeds, buying cargoes of timber, roping stuffs, canoes, crud furniture and the like, and bringing all this back to Muscat, Bahrein, Basra, and Kuweit for sale. Exactly what smuggling they &amp;lso do I don’t know, for I have not sailed in the Indian trade: but it is safe to conclude that, as elsewhere, it is as much as possible. The Kuweit ^ • r. shins also carry some coastwfise Indian cargoes, for the Kuweit booms have a good name, and their nakhodas and crews are well-known for their general honesty -- that is, as far as the cargo itself is concerned. Cargo pilferage in Kuweit ships is unknown: it never occurs to *a Kuweiti to tamper with his cargo, as is a sadly common practice among some of the less scrunulous Indian coasting nakhodas. Calicut seems to be the farthest point reached oy Kuweit ships on their Indian voyages: tney never round Ca-oe Comorin, never go to Java. Though they almost alwaysBooms report 4 sail home dirgctly to^the Persian ^ulf (or by as near direct a route as the v/ind allows) , sometimes one loads tiles and jars at Mangalore for Mombasa and Zanzibar, returning with mangrove noles either from the delta of the Rufiji River, in Tanganyika, or from Larnu in Kenya Colony. African traders always load dates at Basra for Mukalla for orders. At Mukalla they receive discharging orders, and usually discharge part cargo there, part at Berbera, and the rest at Aden. Sometimes they take the whole to ^erbera: sometimes they go to Hodeida, or even to Gizan: but if they are sent to Hodeida, Gizan, or any other port well in the Red Sea, it is usually impossible for them to make the voyage to Africa and they then come home with general cargo^from Aden, or go to Seihut to load fish-oil, or tramn round the Mahra coast and to Sur (where there is very little for the Kuweiti to pick up, when the hungry Suri and poverty-stricken Mahra Bedu are looking for a livelihood), finally bringing firewood home from the Batina coast. But usually alii the dates are discharged by the time the booms reach Aden, and in December (they leave the Shatt-el-Arab in September) they leave Aden bound for Zanzibar. They top un along the Hadhramaut coast, and their cargoes lb ually include about 50 tons of salt (in bulk) .(rice, sugar, and other foodstuffs to be sold to Arabs down the Benadir and Swahili coasts, as well as ghee in kerosene tins, and £» cooking stones and such things. At Mukalla dnd Shihr, they compete for passengers; often a boom will have 150 of these. In the B a yan this year, we carried 130, as far as I could count. (There never was a -oro-ner passenger list.) With the 'oassengers on board, the shins sail along ihe Arao coast until they are to windward of Ras Asir, when they stand towards Africa and, soon picking un that coasL, continue down it for two or three months, looking in at whatever ports seem likely to offer profit. They sail down ith the north-east monsoon, and never sailBooms report 5 any further than this useful wind blows: the southern limit of oheir voyages is Cane Delgado. On rare occasions, they do some coasting trade between Zanzibar and the Comoro Islands or even to Madagascar, but nowadays is quite unusual. Ordinarily they sell their outward cargoes at such nlaces at Haifun, Obbia, 'yarsheikh, Mogadishu, iiterka, Brava, and Kisimayu (all in Italian Mast Africa), at Lamu, Malindi, and Mombasa, in Kenya: ana at Zanzibar. Tanga and Dar-es-Salaam are little visitea oy Kuv/eit craft. At Zanzibar discharge of the outward cargo is comnlete, and they then often go local tramping, ej.ther to Lindi or Mikindani or some such nlace for a cargo of grain (for a local merchant at Zanzibar), or to the Rufiji for mangrove poles. If they have arrived at Zanzibar by mid-February, they have amnle time for a local coasting voyage wmie v.aiting fox he SW monsoon. If later than this, however, the larger vessels have no time for this extra coasting to Lindi and those places usually, on discharge of these local cargoes at Zanzibar, go on to Lamu to load: others go straight from Zanzibar to tne delta of tne Rufiji, and take in a cargo there for the Persian Culf without bothering about local earnings. Prom the Rufiji, they return to Zanzibar, where usually the nakhodas have remained while mates or other unfortunates have JUJ&amp;SL taken the shin to the dreadful , and there top off with whatever comes to hand. In the Bayan this year, we loaded, at Zanzibar, ei ;ht bags of cloves, two tons of unhusked coconuts, 100 small cases or. French vermicelli (a cheap job lot somebody in the suq had sold to Ali Nejdi -- and he made a handsome profit on it at Muscat later, ior we sold it there to Batina and Trucial coasters who distributed it about without bothering to pay any customs charges), and four cases of cheap perfumed soap of the kind that is always ^popular in the suqs of Kuweit, Basra, and Bahrein. Prom Zanzibar the booms usually sailBooms Report 6 directly homewards to Muscat for orders, going into fuscat only for letters from the merchants in Kuweit: cargoes are sold at Bahrein, Basra, pr Kuweit, and sometimes (though rarely) elsewhere, such as Sharja or some port on the }atar Pensmsular. A Kuweit boom 1 s typical African voyage works out something like this.'She goes from Kuweit to Basra early in September, and is chartered there to load dates at such and such a freight to Mukalla for orders.These dates she does not buy; they are bought usually by the merchants who are her real owners. 7ith the freight earned by the dates, which is collected at Aden, the boom then buys salt, rice, tinned milk, sugar, and such things. Say (as in the Bayan), she has earned about 3000 Rupees freight on the dates. This then is used to buy cargo for sale in Africa. She then goes to Mukalla and Shihr and shins her passengers. The average income from this source, in a good year, is about 1000 runees. The fare for men from the Hadhramaut to anywhere in Africa that the booms visit, is 8 rupees: for women (who are not wanted, and rarely brought), it is 12. In addition to these ^adhrami, most of the booms have odd merchants on board, not very modern Sinbads usually from Sur whose principal merchandise is Japanese junk bought cheaply in the Crater at Aden, and whose only business is smuggling. These often decamp from the ship without paying their fares, and are rarely a source of any kind of profit. Ror this reason, many of the older Kuweit nakhodas will not carry them. The cargo bought at Aden and Mukalla is then sold, in bits and pieces, down the coasts of Italian hast Africa and Kenya and Tanganyika. Most of this business is purely Arab, v/hich is another way of saying that again the structure of debt becomes so complicated and hopelessly entangled that it is beyond the conception of the European how it ever can be straightened out. Cash changes hands .and with great reluctance, ^ T&amp;Telyk and booms, though time means little to them, wvon TVp-^L-pcannot always wait about until an Arab merchantBooms Report 7 pays. A considerable proportion of the business of each voyage seems to consist of trying to clear up the debts of the last, and for this purpose odd mates and younger sons and brothers (always without passports) are left at odd places up and do n the coast, while the boom moves on. These pick up their own ship later, with cash: or if they don’t they make the best of their way home by other vessels. (Incidentally they never pay any fares: no fares are charged, for any Arab ship will carry a debt- collector for any other.) The outward cargo finally disposed of, the boom moves on with whatever funds may be in hand -- and they are usually sufficient, for after all the Hadhrami pays cash, and so do odd extra passengers picked up on the African coast: and some old debts are always settled -- and goes, say, down to the delta of the Rufiji. Here she buys a cargo of mangrove poles, or at least pretends to buy her cargo. In actual fact she buys half a cargo, steals the other half. This is a time-honoured practice which has been going on, apparently, for centuries. Previously - prior to the Berman times - the Sultan of Zanzibar had the cutting rights for this delta, and under that sort of management the present system of paying for half the cargo, stealing the other half, was built up. As far as I have been able to discover, the Bermans, if they did not find out quite what was going on, at least became very suspicious, and for a year or two before the war outbreak of war in 1914 made the Arab shins load from a central dump at Salale, under close supervsision. The usual method, and the one in use now, is to allow the Arabs to move about in the delta more or less as they like, and only one government officer - a forester - looks after them. The cutting rights are now the property of a contracting company which, since it spends nothing in the delta, itseli and pays only royalties on what is sold, does not care to check stealing. The company is represented by oneBooms renort 8 man, who is usually at the southern end of the delta while the forester is at the northern. There are also forest guards, headmen, and all the rest of the usual organisation: hut it is all corrupt. The guards being Swahilis under Arab dominance dare not do anything to upset the established pratices, even if they wished; and they do not wish, for they profit well enough as things are. It is usual to pay the proper price cheerfully enough to the company for half the cargo, and the remainder through a close organisation of the Swahili headmen, is bought from them at half-price. This is done very cleverly and without much trouble. The forester at Salale, a good man, has become very suspicious of late and has placed guards in each ship; but the guards are without exception corrupt, and the only result has been to waste theypp-^agr. The forester has, however, managed to put the capacities of the dhows up in general by ten percent: but they still steal at least half their cargos. As a matter of fact, the Kuweiti are rather new at this business, which has long been a preserve of the Suri Arabs, ’.'hen we loaded in the Rufiji this year, it was the Dayan's first VAsit: v/e took down a Suri ”pilot'^ whose real duty was to see that we were able to fill the ship without paying for the cargo. V/e actually bought 142 score of mangrove poles: at -Bahrein we sold 300 score, though we loaded only in the Rufiji. The capacities of the ships is not known: it is difficult for the Ruronean to tell one dhow from another, or even one Arab: the Arabs go to considerable lengths - merely precautionary - to disguise the identity of their craft and of themselves, often, indeed, sending their shins down from Zanzibar, on two successive voyages, under two different names. Since no names are to be seen on them, this is easy enough. All this subterfuge is not really necessary, for no one has any idea that the stealing is on such a large scale: and nobody cares very much about what goes on in the Rufiji Delta anyway. (My own feeling would be that whoever ^uts up with that wretched dump^which is a frightful place of malaria, mosquitos, mud, hi^po. rain, gloom, and wretchedness in general, deserves to profit handsomely hy it: and both the company’s charge and the government’s royalty on the poles are far too high -- they both get what they deserve). The Arabs in the Rufiji receive no consideration whatever. It is a dangerous place, both to their own health, and to their ships’ safety. The company does not collect their poles, nor even n bother to come round and collect payment # y(The Arabs have to hire the Swahili (first finding them, which is not easy), and fe ed them on board their vessels - and this m a place where food is expensive, and nothing is ■procurable locally. It takes some 70 or 80 Swahili £0 about a month to cut even a smallish cargo; and they are all (perhaps inspired by the Arab example) tremendous eaters. ITobody but the Arabs comes to the Rufiji to buy poles: it is uneconomic for them to come if the present system were disturbed (while poles are priced as high as they are). It follows, then, that if for any reason they are driven away, the Rufi.ji’s trade would cease. Of course the whole thing should be praperly organised and put on an Hfgl'BXJsagR efficient basis, which would be easy enough: the existing situation is rather a sad reflection upon much of what has gone on in mandated territories. By the way, one of the ringleaders in this headmen-Swahili-forest-guard organisation, and one of the men largely responsible for keeping it going, is the alleged agent of the Company at Zanzibar. This company is somewhat curiously called the Liverpool and Uganda Company: it seems to employ a lot of Germans -- or did. It was explained to me that Germans were the cheapest European labour a7 a liable in Tanganyika , and this probably was so. Other proceedings of the Arabs in the Rufiji includeBooins Renort 10 r\ smuggling in rice and sugar. Indeed the Arab is always ready for any dishonesty of this kind that might bring him profit, and it is almost impossible to control him. Svery sailor smuggles on his own account; the ship smuggles for the general account; the nakhoda and all the mates, the younger sons, the odd Suri merchants, and whoever else might be aboard, smuggle^ for their accounts. They smuggle whatever will bring them a profit, but having little money their investments are never large. Sailors usually spend from 10 to 20 rupees in Ql the Grater at Aden, buying cheap sarongs, cheap French perfumes (which they afterv/ards take from the big bottles and put into a lot of small ones), playing cards, and whatever else tneir previous experience has shown them to be saleable; nakhodas branch out into women's veils from Bombay, more expensive perfumes, better sarongs. Any smuggling in bulk is usually done by distributing the stuff to smaller coasting vessels, either Somali (under the Italian flag), or Suri; the Ku/v eiti rarely takes a real risk. Sailors carry stuff ashore beneath the copious folds of their big shirts, or tied round their knees; nothing short of rigorous examination of the whole lot of them would check thennj of this pastime. They hawk what they smuggle, openly enough, through the native quarters and in the suqs. In addition to such inoctfuous things as dry-goads and the like, the Arab also brings drugs, hashish, qat, and such things. I was told by a Govt, medical officer at Zanzibar that as soon as the north-east .lonsaon sets in nobody in Zanzibar asks for a arug prescription. Much of this stuff comes in Bo ifeby kotias, too; but I would not absolve the Kuweiti. I saw some stuff landed by Suri from the -Bayan. At Zanzibar the port authorities compel the dhows to crowd into one confined anchorage: here the new arrival, sailing in, jostles about amongst a -—. . the fleet looking for^good arwr berth: and it is ,hile this jostling is going on that the stuff is landed. ItBooms Report 11 is merely passed to other ships, of v/hich there may be as many as 60 at the anchorage. Thesisailors jump overboard and swim to other ships with lines - the Arabs’ usual manner of picking out a berth in a crowded anchorage - and at the same time an odd 3uri or tv/o jumps over with other things. These he hides, for the time being, aboard a vessel nearby which ha s already been examined. In such circumstanes , it is obvious that smuggling is al riost impossible to check: the whole fleet cannot be watched at once, and the jostling and swimming to and fro are genuine enough. Rigorous search of any Arab dhow is a discouraging proceeding to anyone, especially to the European in hot places; any other searchers would be corrupt. Cockroaches, rats, and all manner of foulness are taken for granted; most of the important stuff, too, is hidden beneath the so-called great 'cabin”, the foulest place of all. And most dho/v s have at least one pretty secure hiding-place: all dhow^ma sters, andpill dhow crews, have a disarming frankness which soon puts the European off whatever search he might begin. But this frankness is deceptive indeed: Ao^- any illegal business that me/can manage, he does^-- the whole lot of them. The Suri are the most unscrupulous of all: but the Kuweiti is not so very far behind. And the conditions of Zanzibar are duplicated elsewhere. From Italian East Africa (where the Arabs are oy no means popular) the Kuweiti smuggle considerable sums in paper lira, for which there appears to exist a definite market both in Kuweit and at Port Said. The lira, done up in a hxx bundle of old rags, are merely passed round from ship to ship so that they are always on board a ship v/hich is not subject to search: and then, at the last moment - again in the jostling this time of unmooring/^the bundle comes aboard the ship to which it belongs, and off it goes. As w r ith lira, and goods to be smuggled; so also with passengers. Odd wanderers without passports (seemingly only on general principle: there is nothing more dishonest or illegal about th1^2 ^ooras Report 12 any more than there is with the general run of Arabs) flit from ship to ship, without ever being listed on any: indeed quite a floating population moves down from Arabia annually in the Suri, Kuweiti, Hadhrami, and Mahra dhows of which there is no official knowledge v/hatever. There is, for that matter, a considerable deficiency in official knowledge of dhows and their goings-on in general. The dhows leave Arabia almost invariably without a passenger list of any kind; passengers die (and usually some do) are promptly thrown over board, and their deaths unreported. The Italians at Haifun, often the Arabs 1 first port of call, do try to make a thorough survey at least of tne passengers, hopelessly discouraging task as it is, and do their best both to list them, ana to inoculate them. In this the Italians are doing the governments of Kenya, Zanzibar, and Tanganyika an excellent service. Such passenger-lis-s as are complied, however, are n^ver complete: or if they are complex, say, at Haifun, then at Mogadishu xsy they become hop dessly incorrect again. People are no^ smuggled actually into the ports: they merely 'change ships', and this is a process impossiole to control. The ship-changers almost invanaoly are without passports: most of them come from Sur. *.7e had our share in the Bayan , both taking them from ooner ships, arid giving o oner ships our own. 'Then immigration officers v/ere expected, I have often seen old men, olind men, small boys, and others being hidden carefully away in tne forepeak or elsewhere. Usually there is no real reason why these people should oe smuggled about, for they are no v/orse cioizens than one lisocu ones: simply the Arac’s detestationj^and utter inability to understand red tape regulations, is all that lies at tne oo^tom oiBooms He-nort listed anyv/here. By staying in shins -- they might be guests, in the course of an ordinary trading voyage, of anything up to half-a-dozen: they prefer the Kuweiti because Fuweiti feed bettor than their ov/n -- they never land their goods, and thus never nass through customs examination. Acco ‘ding to them, in v/natever port tney may be they are simply travellers $&gt;ound somewhere else: anu in fact they are, though there trade may not be. The Italians, incidentally, do their best also to control this sort of thing, ana they have the advantage of Uoing a far greater pronortion of Europeans than we do. But they have to rely a great deal upon Somali police, and onese are no more s£tio^'actory than Swahili - worse, iJi anything. Anu. ootn the Araos and the Somali have a fierce and undying contempt for the Italian, which I am glad to say -b^rD neither of them feel towards us. Reverting to the economic side, the booms bring back their mangrove poles (called chun dels, or u orities )and whatever else may offer - usually something of a miscellany such as we carried in the Sayan. The nroceeds of the sale of these goods, together with ihe money earned from-i passengers, is usually tne profit of ifae voyage. V In short, here is the outline of a general African voyage: Dates are freighted to Mukalla/Berbera/Aden: cargo is bought at Acen with this freight and sold in Bast Africa: with the proceeds from the sale of the cargo, the homeward cargo is bought: the proceeds of the sale of the homeward cargo constitute the profit of the voyage. It is not as simple as this, of course. There is nothing simple and straightforward about any Arab economy: there are the complications of passengers, smuggling and dishonest activities in general, repayment of the ship^ own debts and settlement of her old accounts, and then the further comnlication -minseparable from all Arab seafaring - of the advances/shares system, and the fact that the sailors 1Booms Report 13 shares for the stolen noles is greater than their share for the honestly acquired ones. All manner of other complications are involved, all of which appear confusing almost beyond belief to us: but they seem as clear as daylight to the dullest j Arab mariner. Ho Arab sailor seems really to mind the shares system, honeless as it is. The broad principle of it is that the sailor pays for his food, and takes a share - an honest share - in the earnings of the shin. Say, for example, that the Bayan this 3a st voyage grossed 14000 rupees (which would be good). Then from this gross the cost of the food is deducted - for 27 souls, about 2000 rmnees for the 10 months voyage. This leaves 10,000 rupees. This sum is halved, half going to the owners, and the other half is then divided into a certain number of equal shares. Ofothese shares, the sailors take one each, the quartermasters one and a half, the cook one and a quarter, the serang two, the mate two, and the nakhoda four. ’Thatever else may be dishonest aoout them, at any rate the division of the spoils seems scrunulously honest in most of the Kuweit shins. A sailor’s average annual share is about 150 runees, if he is very fortunate: this year the Bayan paid 135 run^es a share. Others paid less. (Abdul 7/ahhab bin Kalifa - the big boom Tai-seer - 125: Ahmed Radhwan the Persian - baggala Salamte - 95.) In addition the sailor gets what he earns from his own ventures, plus whatever buksheesh the nakhoda feels inclined to give him - sometimes none. Usually part of his share goes towards paying off some old pearling debt, though nowadays it is rare to take more than 15 rupees for this. The sailor’s gross earnings, even if he has had a most successful year, very seldom reach as high as 200 rupees, nevertheless mast of them are married; some of the serangs and quartermasters have two wives, but this is very unusual among the sailors.looms Report 15 I shall conclude these notes with a few odd facts, very baldly stated. On the outward voyage, the carnenter (if one is carried) always builds a boat for sale at Lamu or Mombasa. The boat is made as large as the maindedc of the boora will allow - is often as big as eight tons. I have yet to see an Arab dhow with lights -- and I have probably seen at least 1000 of them under way. They will not use lights, and we cannot make them: they swear that swordfish (of which they are terribly afraid - and with some reason) are infuriated by red sidelights, and will attack their ships if they show them. Navigation is almost alv/ays entirely by sight. They coast out, and they coast back - both ways with a fair wind, and under good conditions. But the local knowledge of a good Kuweit nakhoda is immense. A sailor to every 100 packages of dates, with an extra one for every thousand, is considered the proper manning scale for Kuweit ships. They carry big crews because it costs nothing: the sailors pay for the food. Indian kotias carry crews only about a third the size of those carried ).n Kuweit ships. There is a fine comradeship amorg st all dhow- captains: all of them seem prepared to help any other who is in trouble, even if they do not like him. It seems sufficient that he should be a Muslim. Kuweit's shipping position compares roughly with other Arab ports as follows: (the figures are the best I have been able to gather, and refer only to long-voyage ships) KU'fSIT 106 (all told 120) ships going long voyage SUR 60 BAHREIN 2 (Bahrein is now a locally distriouting centre, more than a port sending out its own ships) KUNCrK (also called KINGK, or KU1T0) About 20Booms Re-port 16 LIUCrBH Perhaps 6 JSSSRH Pe -haps 4 (formerly many more; this port has declined severely) MUSCAT One boom: a number of smaller craft TUTKALLA Only small craft sail from the Haahrainaut MAHRA COAST Is now buying old Suri baggalas The Persians and Suri buy from Kuweit, the Suri W baggalas (of which they have now bought about the lot) ani the Persians booms. People from Mahra buy worn-out Suri baggalas, sometimes buy old pearlers at Kuweit. (Price 400 Rupees upwards.) In round figures, Kuweit has probably 300 carpenters, 500 nakhodas (of one sort and another), five or six thousand seamen. The boom SAMKAli has a crew of 48. Kuweiti sailors work magnificently: but they include many negroes, freed slaves, and a fair sprinkling of Persians. No Bedu goes deepwater. No baggala has been built at Kuweit for the past quarter of a century. Nakhodas seem born to that rank: they have never been sailors. Nakhodas go by families: if a mariner is not in a nakhoda family, he very, very seldom can become even a mate, A lot of nakhodas are sons of merchants out of their black slaves. The Kuweiti still has a hearty belief in jinns, and a lot of his own superstitions. piracy is still a real risk of the sea: beating along the Mahra coast, or anywhere west of Ras al Hadd, the Ku/veiti must watch for them. Nowadays they try to steal from anchored ships: they also try to wassi: wreck ships, if they can, for they consider wrecks Cod’s gift to them.

They do not have the long lives ordinarily assigned to them: an Arab dhow over 50 is rare nowadays, though they u ed to sail until they were more than 80 and even 100.

Suri nakhodas sneak Swahili very well. and the Arabs are very unimaginative about naming their vessels. Half the dhows in Kuweit are called the 'Pat- ql-Khair'. Usually when one asks a sailor the name of his dhow, he does^t know. Neither does he know how old he is, or what day - or even what month (unless it be Ramadhan). These things do not bother him. and also well kept up. Most of them are a credit to their owners, masters, and crews. ITT; Astronomical navigation is a closed book to No Kuweit nakhoda speaks English.

There is no proper measurement of shi^s at Kuweit; no prorer means of identification. They aught to be made carve numbers - pronerly allocated official numbers - into the planking on both quarters, carrying in the same place details of their nett and gross tonnage. The number and tonnage ought also to be carved along the inside of the coaming of the main-hatch. The present lack of means of identification is used by the Arabs a good deal, in the furtherance of dishonest - or at any rate completely illegal - activities. In time of war we ought to be able to identify them. They are aL 1 given proper measurement, and measurement certificates, if wver they visit Karachi or Bombayr but there is a trade in these certificates v/hich is winked at here, and causes a good deal of hoodwinking in the ports of Iraq. Entering at Kao, when going into the 3hatt-el-Arab to load dates, hardly any Kuweit dhow can be trusted to give honest particulars of herself, the object in this oeing to hide her real capacity (since they all load at anchorage in the river, from plantations, and there is no check on the actual number of parcels taken on board) and so avoid the payment of as much excise as possible, -he same kind of thing goes on in the Rufiji River, and anywhere else where it may be of profit. Eurther to disguise the ships, their real nakhodas very seldom take them into the river: the nakhodas join later, on the eve of sailing, vdien tne vessel has been cleared and all payments made. By that time - j am speaking now of Kao ~ tnere are usually ^-ore than a hundred other vessels awaiting attention, and the port'.That ^oeg On (Kuweit) Page 2 officials, even if they wished, would find it impossible to check every dhow. I found the Iraqi port director at Vao the other day very much concerned about this, and inclined to berate the Kuweiti. 'That do they do? he said: They own all these shambas here - waving about with a fat hand (and indeed most of the plan&amp;aitions about there are owned in Kuweit) - and they live in an unnecessary place without hospitals or schools or even water (and if we wished, he went on, ' e could stop their water for them any day), solely for the -purpose of avoiding their proper responsibilities as landholders here, and for carrying on activities against us. What activities? I asked: but he did not go into that, ^e said Iraq could make a good port out of Kuweit; but he meant that Iraq could get more business for 3asra and for Fao if Kuveit were not in existence. However, there is no doubt that the existence of a free and not entirely properly administered port here in Kuweit i_s a thorn in the Iraqi side: and the agents of the enemy lose no opportunity in pointing out that (according to them) Kuweit depends upon us and upon ^ritisn policy for its whole existence. KUWEIT is especially busy just now, in spite of the wretched state of tne pearl market. Fhe pearl market, and the revenues derived from it, had already so declined that even complete collapse is not now a major calamity; the sea carrying trade has been improving to offset the loss from pearls, and distribution of goods into the hinterland has also greatly increased, as far as I can gather. But I see everywhere as I go about signs of activity -- building (tnere is an extraordinary number of new houses, though I see that they are practically all merchants’ houses): snip- building (I am told that most of the booms had to go off v/ithout their carpenters this year, as so much worx was offering here that the carpenters w mid not ship away, preferring to stay in Kuweit where they are all busy): furniture-making, and carnentery and joinery in general:V/liat Goes On -- Page 3 and even the sho^3 seem generally very busy, nonetheless there is a deep undercurrent of worried uncertainty among the more intelligent business-men, and a very real^desire to see the war at an early end.especially since Russia came in. The Kuweiti business men remember/dlearly what happened in .AjLaJL t :e last war to imagine that there will be anyv/prosperity for tnem in this, no matter in wha.t way some funds might temporarily come to the place, or from what trades. They know that war means dislocation and loss: they have experience d that, and remember it. So, with a very worried eye on the future, and one ear onen for Punis Bahri, most of them keep busy making what they can as they can and rather hoping now that we will win. Odd Beliefs amon,^ th e Kuv/ e i t i : Here are some queer things the Kuweiti have been taught to believe. De (1. was a Jew. f'e was the real cause of the political troubles in Kuweit, (^he corrollary being, I suppose, now that he isn’t here, there is no trouble.) Only British policj^ maintains Kuweit as a buffer-state, purely in Britain’s interest. (The exact nature of the interest is unspecified.) The Kuweit Oil Co. doesn’t want to get - or to use at any rate - Kuweit’s oil: again part of that inscrutable British policy. When the K.O.Co drilled on the other side of the bay, the hole was plugged to prevent the oil from spurting out. Bngland started this war. (This is a contribution from Tunis Bahri.) Japan is rapidly becoming Muslim. Half the British Cabinet is Jewish. Jewish purse-strings rule England. (Tore from P.B.) ** BT T T Britain is satisfied with what sheWhat ^oes On -- Page 4 holds: and ^od knows what Germany wants. But from recent -oolicy, it is obvious that it is a lot. On the whole, we seem still to be preferred, in spite of Palestine. THERE is no doubt that the situation here - and probably throughout Arabia - has changed materially since the war began, because of Russia's comingnin and Italy staying out. They never did really wish us to be beaten, but only (I gather from the hotheads) to be so weakened, or so busy, that we would no longer care very much about the situation in Palestine: now they seem to fear we might not win, and admit their bewilderment and complete incapacity to foresee events. I dax cannot help thinking that a talk on the possible complications of the war as they might affect Huslim peoples, given in Arabic on our Arab programmes - ia frank and really vital talk, with some facts and guts to it - would be good propaganda at the moment. The better news they hear from us, and the more real news, the less will they be inclined to listen elsewhere. pzgathergdxi'HoPraq .thewothsrxday'^whsrs anti^zritishxandxproxHxtierzfeeixngzinxfchsxSu^xwa axan:. xtrongxthakzoEiezf eitx in zsnemyzterrxtiOEy^x The rate of exchange Suq here is Three Annas for a on Indian notes Ten-Rupee note. in the There is a lot of cocaine in Kuweit.as demanding of some of them, if they were as scornful of Eunis Bahri as their s*poken words might indicate, why did they always listen to him?

Before Ramadhan we shall have to change our hour, if the broadcasts in Arabic are to be of any general good at all. . . Ilot es on Eascist-ITazi Propaganda in GeneraJL As far as this place Kuweit is concerned, I do not believe any active Fascist or ITazi agents have ever been at work in it, or even interested. (And in that they err.) Where Kuweit becomes affected is in the Iraqi schools, for the dictator-countries have for years followed a policy of getting bright Iraqi students to their own schools, thereoto be politically educated and made into very active agents indeed, rhese return Iraq, become teachers, are conscripted into army service, spread ■nropaganda in the army; and as teachers they influence the Kuweit boys. If it were possible, no Kuweiti children should ever be sent to an Iraq government school: but , unfortunately more and more of the younger merchants’ sono have been sent to these schools in recent years, fith tnese, I’m afraid the harm has been done. The worst type of agent-teacher nreaches ardently the doctrines tne fascist states most need to spread - anti-British to the core. Much of this, one regrets to report, has fallen into eager ears, if The use of the Arabs themselves as preachers of the new doctrines was an excellent move which I do not think we could well duplicate, for we may as well admit thatListening to the Radio (etc.) -- .5 the theatrical nature and much of the pomp and blustering, conceit and show of the Italians (for instance) has much apoeal to the Arab nature. If he com-s to 'England, how shall we make him our agent? It v/ould be better to leave that kind of ih ing to Prance -- or change ourselves a bit, which would be better still. It is a sad fact that many of the Arabs who do get to England, as students and the like, come away from us feeling - well, that they have not been very welcome. Our ways, though they wear better, are not anything like as impressive: even our climate is against them. Rut if we only could train up some Kuweiti to be teachers, in a part of the Empire v/here conditions would be suitable for them - climatically, socially, and econo.nically - I think we should have be able to build up for ourselves some very fine propaganda indeed. This is a field we have neglected. Rut where to send them? Might Egypt do? Or India? They might feel more at home in Prance -- certainly there there is no colour-bar, and there is a. better general disposition to welcome them. The Germans are clever enough (I gather from actual^,questioning) to mix the Iraqi and the other Arabs that they get into their own youth movements, with definite bright youths to look after them upon strict instructions to make them welcome in every way: I d.on’t see why we could not, in these more enlightened days, do something of the same. 7e have, I also gather, been far too content to leave them alone. oookiridly to produce a T, V/ho f s Who’ 1 for Kuwait.

( 9 ) Numerous bedouin women and has two sone Subah, and Mishaal, and one daughter Muniyat. He succeeded his uncle Sheikh Salim bin Mubarak in 1921 and has rerained in control of the Amirate without interruption until the present day though a determined effort was made in 1938 to cause him to abdicate and a serious heart attack in April of this year has restricted his movement but not his hold on affairs. The Shaikh is a good looking man of ligjit complexion and. carefully trimned beard who photographs badly. He spent much of the early part of his life with the oedouin and lias many of their traits. • •ry pro-British he lias offered, and when called upon gives, such assistance and facilities as His Majesty^ Government may be in need of for the prosecution of the war. That he lias succeeded in retaining control of his Amirate is in great measure due to nis close relations with His M&amp;issty 1 s Government and so far His Highness has shown no tendency to forget this undoubted fact* unfortunately lie is lacking in firmness in dealing with his own relatives and allows them too much freedom a ? tlon * He is remarkably mean and in consequence is not liked by the bedouins who love a free giver, fortunately Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim, C.I.E., is equally close fisted. Not clever, but shrewd in more ways than are at once obvious, he can be childishly stubborn and difficult to deal with while at times he is easy and aocomuodating. A bedouin by decent with a superficial layer of -culture and civilisation. 2 . Shaikh Abdullah bin as Subah. A..-ad 37. The eldest eon of th. Ruler Shaikh Ahmed by a lady of the house of Ghanim.

C.I Ji^A*fed Fat and short winded this Shaikh is generally accepted as the heir presumptive and it is probable that he will succeed ms first cousin without opposition but how long he will live is a matter of some doubt for he is a gross person who has for years suffered from a form of kidney disease and I suspect a weak neart. His manners vary with his mood, some times courteous and wellbred, at otners borrish and inclined to be insolent. In character he resembles his cousin only in their common intense dislike of spending money * he is a coward at heart and much of his bluster is an ineffectual cloak for natural craveness. He pretends to considerable eruditions and of recent years has developed an affected manner of speech which is difficult to understand. Like most heirs whether apparant or presumptive he is not on tjt&gt;od terms with His Highness who cordially dislikes and distrusts nim. He is reputed, with some truth* tc have Axis leanings and there is little doubt that he likes to hear the news from all quarters. He is President of the Advisory Council but takes his duties very lightly and spends most of his time at Failaoha Island. He is not liked by Ibn Saud who considers his aversion to hawking, or hunting in any form contemptable.

At feud with Snaikh Abdullah bin Sa'id, Brother of the Imam, and Wali of Boshar. Might possibly be elected Imam if his brother diedf but is not himself particularly influential. Has been in Muscat service for 29 years (1942), for most of whicn he has held his present Wilayat.

First met the Sultan^ father in India at the Delhi Durbar, where he made his mark by the success with which he showed him round. Salrid Hamad bin Faisal A very cultivated and charming individual, who is regarded by the Sultan, rather Justifiably, as a 'dark horse', and is kept definitely in eclipse. Was for ten years Wall of Sohar, where he did not draw pay, but managed the revenue and expenditure of the Wilayat independently of the rest of the Sultanate, taking from it his own perquisites. He became so strong that his dismissal and relegation to the Wilayat of Matrah was only achieved by a show of force on the part of the Sul tan* From this post of diminshed splendour he was again dismissed on charges of embezzlement. He still draws, on paper, a considerable salaryj but the bulk of it goes direct to his creditors. (While in Sohar, he established a Municipality there). Formerly Wali of Quriat, and has been Wall of Gwadur since 1941. (NOTE.

Mujtemmad bin Abdullah was elected in 1920, largely through the influence of Shaikh Isa bin Saleh al-Harti (q.v.) (on the murder of the Imam Salim bin Rashid al-Kharusi). His property is mostly in Wadi Sama'il, where the excellent Fardh dates are grown. After the repulse of the Oman rebellion in 1919, he was the last of the Sama'il shaikhs to come to terms.

(The latter was concerned in a plot to assas. c ; Saiyid Majid in Zanzibar! and on its failure, (vide on •Imam') he joined Azzan bin Qais* party. He later supported Saiyid Abdul Aziz against Saiyid Turki. His most distinguished exploit was his attempt to assassinate Saiyid' Turki when staying in Muscat as his guest). Isa bin Saleh 1 e policy was at first to gain influence over Saiyid Taimur, and use him as his puppet against Saiyid Faisalj but wten Saiyid Taimur succeeded to the Sultanate, Shaikh Isa*s friendship for him disappeared. Shaikh Isa was the prime instigator of the Oman rebellions in 1913 - 19. He married a daughter of the present Imam, and was mainly responsible for his election. He lives at Qabil ash-Sharqiyeh. His tribe is the Hawarith. (This tribe, apart from Shaikh Isa*s personal influence, is not a particularly strong one). Imail iflialll ar-Rasasl A Palestinian, who has been in the service of the State since 1929. He started as a teacher; but now holds the position of Wall of Matrah.

The Political Agent is directly responsidle to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 2. APPROA CHES AND ENTRANCE . Kuwait Hardour and its approaches present no navigational difficulties. Depths at L.W.O.S.T. in the entrance to the hardour are 10 to 16 fathoms, and in the middle of the hardour from 5 to 9 fathoms. Adout 1-J miles from Kuwait town is an area in which depths of 3 i to 5 £ fathoms are available as an anchorages for vessels of suitable draught. The further westward in this area a vessel can anchor the better the shelter. This are is southward of EASHT AL HADAIBAFL Vessels requiring greater defcpths anchor N.N.7. of EASHT AL HADAIBAH in from 7 to 9 fathoms, but in this anchorage there is little shelter from the Kaus wind. Anchorages may also be obtained by vessels of suitable draught in BANDAR 3HU7AIKH. Tides . Spring tides rise Hi feet and Neap tides 8 feet. 3. VUAYAGE There are two jetties at Bandar Shuwhikh - (a) Built by the British Government in 1915 is approximately 300 feet long x 30 feet wide. This jetty is built in stone and cement. (b) Built by the A.I.O.C. in 1940 is 280 feet long x 16 feet wide and constructec in cement. Both these jetties are used by the A.I.O.C. for the discharge of packed oil. Depths at the seaward ends are about 14 feet at high water and 2i feet at low water. At high water the top of each jetty is about li feet above the surface. Two buoys have been laid off the Oil Comapny jetty at which small ships can be at high water. They can then lie secured alongside the jetty for short periods. The largest ship that has done this is the rt NIDAR0S', 2,353 tons, 22 feet draught. It has been proposed that this jetty be extended by 32 feet at right angles and, that the level of the jetty be raised 2 i feet. Landing at Kuwait may be effected in any of the sheltered cambers formed by the numerous breakwaters, but all dry from 2 to 3 feet at Springs. /A bitumen lakeSECHET 2^ KUTA.IT. (contd.) jUAYAGrE . (contd.) A Mtumen lake exists within 18 miles of Kuwait and there are ample supplies of coral rock suitable for jetty enlargements etc. Harbour craft consists of motor boats, booms and barges. Booms (lighters) vary in capicity from 1000 to 2000 bags or packages. Barges have a similar capicity. The rate of cargo discharges varies according to whether bags or packages are being unloaded. The former are discharged at the rate of 300 per hatch per hour in good weather and the latter at 200. In bad weather lighter work suffers consider ably dropping to half or less per hour. LIFTING- APPLIANCES . There is one 5-ton hand crane at the main port. ffAHEHOUSES . There is fairly large warehousing space in the Customs sheds. THE TQ'.TN . Kuwait Town, the capital^of the AMI3ATE of Kuwait, is one of the most important in the Persian Gulf. It is built on a considerable slope, the houses being about 50 feet above those on the sea front. It is surrounded on its landward side by a wall in which are 38 towers and 5 gates. The houses are mostly of stone and sun-dried bricks. The Sheikhis town palace has a small roof which is the highest point of any building in the town. The population of Kuwait is estimated at 70,000. Ho spit als. There is one hospital and two outpatient dispen- saries in the town. The hospital is the American Mission Hospital and consists of two'sections, men and women. Both these sections cater for Arabs only, and have no suitable accommodation for Europeans, but the latter can be admitted in an emergency. Number of beds -25. The Kuwait Oil Company have two rooms (one air-conditioned) for use of their employees near, and under the care of the Mission Hospital. There are also two out-patient dispensaries. GOVEBNUENT ESTABLISHMENTS . NIL. COL TlEBCI A L ESTABLISHMENTS . Kuwait is a large boat-building centre and is famous for the excellence of the dhows and booms constructed. All work done is entirely manual, no machinery of any kind being in existence. All craft are built entirely out of timber which is imported by dhows returning from Africa and Malabar. The largest ship yet built measures 130 feet overall with a moulded depth of 16 feet. OIL. In January 1934, the Kuwait Oil Company was formed by agreement with the A.I.O.C. and the American Gulf Co.

Company, British control is assured. This is satisfactory as the oil fields in Kuwait are strategically well placed in that the dispositions made to protect the present source of supply in South Iran would in a large measure afford protection th the source of supply in Kuwait. Further, Kuwait would he a convenient alternative requir ing little diversion of shipping or change in protective dispositions should the A.I.O.C. output from Ahadan he inter rupted. There is as yet no refinery or oil pipe laid. Note. Recent information indicates that at the present time thedevelopments of Kuwait Oil Co., are curtailed owing to ruling circumstances. Labour in Kuwait tom is mainly Persian labour and numbers of labourers available fluctuate. The normal wage of a labourer averages Rs.4/- per day. The coolie labourer works about 8 hours ner day. 9. AIRC RAFT FACT ORIES. NIL. 10. AIR FACILITIE S. (a) The B.O.A.C. have an agreement with the Sheikh for the use of the harbour near SHU7AIKH as an alighting area. There are three Flying Boat^buoys, two situated near the Oil Company’s jetty at SHUIAIKH. The third buoy is situat ed approximately 2 nautical miles further up the channel beyond JEZIRAT KURSIN. These buoys consist of fendered drums that neares the jetty is moored to a 30 cwt. sinker and the outer two to 3-ton sinkers. The shoal water along the westerly edge of the NNE/SSW alighting area is marked by eight black and white anchored drums. The B.O.A.C. maintain stocks of fuel and oil. Tater is available. (b) The R.A.F. have a landing ground situated in position 29® 21* N: 48° 00* E, i mile SSE of Kuwait. This landing ground measures 1000 x 1000 yards ? and consists of hard sand. It is unservicVble after heavy rain and liable to become soft in wet weather^. The landing ground is 12 feet above sea level and land marks are : - Kuwait Bay and town, find indicator over gate in town wall. Two runaways at right angles to each other marked with 2’ wide brown oil strips. Black bitumen corner marks. '’.TELLINGTON' and M D.0.3’' aircraft have successfully used this aerodrome. (c) The civil aerodrome, which is close to the town wall, has a sub-surface which is firm in all weathers, but this landing ground is now out of commission and would require some attention before being fit for use. 11.

(contd) Current supplied is normally 220 volts L.C. dut this fluctuates very considerably and often drops as low as 150 volts. / The Oil Company has an independent plant consisting of 2 oil driven generators developing 7 K.W. This is used solely for their own purposes. later. The Oil Company has found water in abundance at a point ^TTmTles 3.T. of Kuwait. This water although saline is quite drinkable. It is unlikely that any great use will be made of this in the near future owing to the length of pipeline involved and the unsuitability of the water for engines. The present arrangement for the Oil Company’s water supply consists of three 12,000 gallon tanks on the foreshore at Shuwaikh. One tank is used as a settling tank, one (full) as reserve and the other to use. Water is brought to Kuwait by booms from the 3hatt-al-Arab The booms lie off Shuwaikh jetty. A pipeline has been led some way out to sea and water is pumped by hand from the booms through this pipeline (S”) to the settling tank. It is then pumped to the oil camp some 14 miles distant where similar water storage exists. The town supply is also obtained in booms from the Shatt- -al-Arab. Water is sold at the rate of i anna per gallon. There is no pipe system or water works. The Military Authorities have constructed a 100,000 gallon cement water storage tank at Shuwaikh. TRANSPORT FACILITIES . The main means of transport to the interior is by carand camel. A Company maintains a regular bi-weekly service in each direction between Kuwait and Basra for mails and passengers. This is the best road in the state and is fit for M.T. all the year round. Camels in considerable quantity can be bought but not hired. About 200 donkeys can be hired in Kuwait and Jahra. SI GNAL C OMivTTJNIC AT I ONS . There is a single telegraph line from the Post Office in Kuwait town to Basra. There is no cable communication. Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd., have erected a W/T station.

HayV CONFIDENTIAL No.B/PG/20 The Honourable, the Political Resident, HAS Office of Staff Officer (Intelligence), Persian Gulf, “‘th April, 1948 i - MISHAAB The following report is submitted in accordance with your request Ras-al-Mishaab was chosen as the most advantageous point for the discharge of material in connection with the Trans-Arabian Pipeline, although the problem of berthing was rendered difficult in view of shallow water. In consequence, an island was constructed in sufficient depth of water to accommodate two cargo ships alongside. A M Y' shaped pier has been constructed inshore and barges brought in sections from the United States have been assembled and are used for seefciens-f?em-%he United-Statess the purpose of off-loading. The nature of the beach in this area favours the use of flat-bottomed craft which dry out at- low water. * The island forms the seaward end of an overhead lifting and con- vepying cable referred to as a 'sky-hook' with a lifting capacity of approximately ten tons. The pipes will be conveyed in sections weighing approximately three tons, each section consisting of two pipes one fitting inside the other. Pipes will be carried inland and assembled for future installation. It is anticipated that operations will commence in May. International Bechtel Incorporated are constructing the pipeline and the numbers of personnel employed are shewn hereunders- Amerleans 450 British 2 (Gray Mackenzie &amp; Customs rep.) Native Labourers 1200 Native labour is largely drawn from Bahrain, but Saudi Arabs are now being employed as truck drivers etc. A wire perimeter fence 8 feet high has been constructed against the many Bedouins camped in the vicinity for the obvious purpose of looting. The air-strip generally defined as the R.A.F. emergency landing- ground, is in daily use by the Arabian American Oil Company. The following information has been extracted from my Naval Periodical Summary, October-November, 1947:- (vi). Tides - Rise and Fall (Maximum) 9 ft. (viii) . Road Distances - Dhahran - Ras-al-Mishaab 186 miles Ras Tanura - Ras-al-Mishaab 143 miles (xxii) Lighters and Tugs - At present there are 4 ordinary lighters c approximately 200 tons each and one big flattop available. There are one big tug, the M/S 'Ras Tanura' and 3 native type motor- launches in Mishaab. (xxiii). Facilities for discharge of lighters ahsore - There is a small 'Y' shaped pier 2/3 miles from the anchorage where two light ers at a time, one at each arm, can be discharged and there are two cranes on wheels, one of 6 tons and the other of 15 tons lifting capacity. I understand, however, that this arrangement is only temporary as there will be built a pier where oceangoing cargo ships can go alongside and discharge cargo. (xxiv) Stores etc - There are no stores, provisions or water avail able in Ras-al-Mishaab and no facilities for repair work of any kind.2 (xxv) Labout - The ship has to bring the stevedore gangs necessary from Bahrain or Eas Tanura. The stevedores stay on board all the time and have to be supplied water by the ship while the contractors supply their food. (xxvi) Radio - There is no telegraph or telephone station at Ras.al- Mishaab; so the ship has to use its own radio station. In the Gulf, Bahrain, Dhahran and Basrah, radio stations are within reach. (xxvii) Agents - The firm of Gray Mackenzie and Co Ltd; has a representative at Ras-al-Mishaab and there are also some Custom Officials stationed there. 'LB' COPIED Sd/- A.L.

R.M. Andrew, Esquire, Political Agent, KUWAITCONFIDENTIAL The Political Agency No.R/42 Kuwait Dated the 14th July, 1948 © /Syrian My dear Sir Rupert, Will you please refer to your demi-official letter No. K/91 dated the 1st July, 1948 about Kuwait Personalities. 2. As regards Khan Bahadur Abdur razaq Razuqi, he is the son of the late Sayid Mohmood Razucti# a Kuwaiti Arab. He joined Kis Majesty’s Government service when a young boy, and rose to the post of Residency Agent, Sharjah, from which post he retired in 1946, in order to devote himself to commerce. Although his main commercial interests are now in Kuwait, he also retains his business connections with the Crucial Coast, and is a Kind of unofficial agent to whom Arabs from the Trucial Coast turn when they come u^ here for worK or trade. 3. As the leading merchants of Kuwait I would class Hajji Abdurrahman bin Mohammed Bahar, Yusuf Ahmed Mohammed al Ghanim and Yusuf Husain Behbehani. About the first 1 have nothing to add except perhaps that his wartime profits were not on the scale of other merchants, as he Kept strictly to commission worK and followed a conservative trading policy. Yusuf al Ghanim, who has perhaps more agencies than he can deal with effectively, including many important ones liKe Chevrolet, is also interested in the projected scheme for the construction of a water pipe-line from Iraq, and his monopoly of ice pro duction in Kuwait gives him considerable power in the summer months. He is at the present moment not in India but in Syria, where his extremely attractive/wife is undergoing treatment. About Yusuf Behbehani I should only add that he, liKe Yusuf al Ghanim, has become one of the largest contractors for the Kuwait Oil Company and that he is well in with the Shaikh.
