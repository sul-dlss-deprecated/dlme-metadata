We forward to you herewith, in translation, copy of letter No.18929/2101555 dated 27th Murdad, 1311, from the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs, containing the observations of the Persian Ministry of Justice regarding the Judicial Cooperation Agreement, for information.

His Excellency the Minister Plenipotentiary, With reference to Royal ’Iraqi Legation letter No.957 dated 27th July, 1932, regarding the draft Judicial Cooperation (Agreement), I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the Persian Ministry of Justice have previously been informed of the point of view of the Royal ’Iraqi Government regarding the draft in question, and have now replied to the points of view of the ’Iraqi Government as follows 1. The point of view of the ’Iraqi Government regarding Article 1 (a) have previously been observed and completely assured in the sentence ’’Actes Judiciares en matiere civile et commerciale” which mean the documents emanating from judicial authorities, however, the documents emanating from non-judicial authorities, such as Tapu and Notary Public, have also been included in the sentence ’’Actes extrajudiciaires” and in the sentence ”y compris ceux de la juridiction mon contentieuse”. Therefore there exists no defect at all in the Agreement, as thought by the ’Iraqi Government. The demands made by the ’Iraqi Government exist in the draft of the Persian Government. As the taking of oath is not provided for in Persian laws, it is difficult to have oath taken in Persian territory. Therefore, the Ministry (? Persian Ministry of Justice) consider that the inclusion of a clear provision in the draft is not suitable.2. The Persian Government agree to the proposal of the ’Iraqi Government that the documents should be prepared only in the language of the demanding government without having the necessity to translate them. 3. The Persian Government also agree to the proposal of the ’Iraqi Government regarding the amendment of Article 7. when you inform me of the comment of the ’Iraqi Government to the above quoted observations, I will make the necessary arrangements for the conclusion of the Agreement. I seize this opportunity, Your Excellency, to renew the expression of my high consideration and esteem.4 igust 2 air. With reference to the letter from this Department of the 9th of March* I am directed to transmit to you* for the information of decretory Sir John diraon* a copy of a letter addressed to the Legal Secretary to the High Commissioner for Iraq by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affair* on the subject of the judicial agreement between Iraq and i’ersia* A copy has been sent to His Majesty 1 * Minister at Teheran direct from Baghdad* 2.
