Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 30.) (No. 796. Very Confidential.) Sir, Constantinople, September 20, 1912. IN my telegram No. 363 of the 4 th instant, I reported that the Russian Ambassador was about to propose to his Government that it might be necessary, in order to induce the Porte to accept the Russian desiderata in connection with the Turco-Persian frontier, to hold out hopes of a cession of territory from Persia to Turkey between Zohab and Mandeli, and also of concessions in connection with the temettu tax and the economic liberty of Turkey in regard to import duties. In the course of conversation yesterday, M. de Giers informed me that in discussing the frontier question with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 14th instant he hinted to his Excellency that if the Porte should agree to the wishes of Great Britain and Russia in those parts of the frontier in which they were respectively interested, the two Governments would, he thought, prove not unwilling to give the Porte their support in obtaining a rectification of the frontier in the Zohab region, provided such rectification could be justified by the treaty of Erzeroum. M. de Giers went on to say that Gabriel Effendi had intimated that the Porte, in return for acquiescence in the Russian wishes, would desire to obtain some concession in connection with the Capitulations ; he understood that Russia and the other Powers were averse from giving way on such questions as consular jurisdiction and consular assistance in Turkish courts, but he could not admit that they should, by insisting on the right founded on the Capitulations, desire to interfere with Turkish liberty in economic questions. The Ambassador replied that, as regards the frontier, Russia only required the observance of a status quo which had lasted many years and which resulted from treaty agreements, and compliance with this demand would be a very small concession as compared with the sacrifice Russia would make by abandoning her rights in the question of customs dues. M. de Giers did not tell me that his Government had not agreed to his proposal s© bring the 4 per cent, customs duties into connection with the Turco-Persian frontier question, but it would seem as if this was the case.

Gabnel Eftendi said that the Council of Ministers had not found time to go into the whole question, and he reminded me that the Persian Ambassador had made a proposal to piolong the commission s term. I said that while 1 regretted that he should allow such a necessity to arise, I hoped that if it should do so, there would be no obstacle on the part of the Porte. ^ His &gt; Excellency said he could reassure me on that point, and after thanking him I reminded him that he had more than once stated to me that he was quite prepared to accept the frontier proposed by us between Mohammerah and Howizah. It was impossible to discuss the whole frontier at once, and a beginning had to be made somewhere, and it appeared to me to be as well to begin on the points where agreement was assured . would not his Excellency instruct the Turkish delegates to bring forward the question of this part of the frontier at an early meeting of the commission and signify their acceptance of it. Gabriel Effendi said that before giving such instructions he must go more carefully into the details of our proposal. I said that there was little need for elaborate explanations ;. the line that we proposed was entirely m accordance with the treaty of Erzeroum, and was, moreover, for all intents and purposes, identical with the frontier recognised for the past sixty years. I was, however, unable to extract any promise from him, and my impression is that the Minister has not yet been able to secure the attention of his colleagues to the question. I think that this belief is shared by the Russian Ambassador. y i 7 Vr CHARLES M. MARLING.

Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey .— (Received September 23.) Sir, Constantinople, September 14, 1912. WITH reference to my despatch No. 727 of the 28th ultimo, I have the honour to transmit herewith a further memorandum by Mr. Shipley containing supplementary observations on the portion of Dervish Pasha’s book on the Turco-Persian frontier question, chapters 19-40, translation of which was forwarded to you in my despatch above referred to. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING Enclosure in No. 1. Supplementary Observations on the portion of Dervish Pasha’s Booh dealing with the Ancient Frontier between Turkey and Persia from the Region of Howeizeh to the Chigan Pass in Suleimanieh. Chapter 31. DERVISH PASHA, having in the preceding chapters (19-30) completed his survey of the line which, according to him, formed the ancient frontier from Howeizeh to Sermil, proceeds in chapter 31 to give a description of the line in question from the last-mentioned place to the River Shirwan. From Dervish Pasha’s reference to Mount Dalahou and to the fact of his leaving on the Persian side the district of Biveh Nidj (vide map Turkey 37 a), it is clear that from Sermil northwards to Kaia Zandjir the ancient frontier as defined by him is practically identical with the yellow line marked on Colonel Shell’s map attached to Mr. Parker’s memorandum of the 8th December, T906, as showing the line claimed by the Ottoman commissioners in the conferences of 1851—2. From Kala Zandjir northwards to Mount Bizel, situated a little to the south of the River Shirwan, the line, however, cannot be traced with any accuracy owing to the difficulty of identifying the localities through which, according to Dervish Pasha, it passes. He states, however, that if this^ frontier were adopted, the plain of Mirava will be left on the Turkish side, and if, as it would seem from Dervish Pasha’a general description, the plain in question is the plahywatered by the Zemkian River, it is clear that the frontier to which he is here alluding must be formed by the mountain ranges marked Saravend and Avroman on Colonel Shells map above referred to. (Note .—Dervish Pasha in his description of this portion of the line, i.e., between Kala Zandjir and the River Shirwan, makes no mention of a continuation south of that river of the Avroman range properly so-called, and it would seem that in the map in question the name Avroman has been erroneously substituted for Saravend. See also map 37 A where the Saravend range is apparently called Shaveran.) From Mount Bizel the line, according to Dervish Pasha, then goes by Mounts Sari, Suraban, and Koweila (apparently not marked on the identic map) to a hill on the right (northern) bank of the Shirwan which he calls Mount Kavtieh, the exact locality of which I have been unable to determine, his description of this portion of the line being concluded with the observation that “ this interpretation makes the old frontier of Zohab duly clear.’' Chapter 32. In chapter 32 Dervish Pasha, after quoting the provisions of the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) relating to the partition of Zohab, gives the line of frontier from Sermil to Mount Bizel, which, he states, was proposed by him in accordance with the official explanations given by him during the conversation which took place at Zohab [2619 2—14] rYwith the representatives of the three Powers. The line thus proposed by Dervi K Pasha is given in Colonel Shell’s map above referred to, and need not therefore h discussed in detail here ; but it may be remarked that in so far as it abandons t ^ 6 frontier of the Sara vend range and gives Derneh and the Mirava plain to Persia it ' 6 if only slightly, more advantageous to the latter country than the line of the an * ^ frontier as described by Dervish Pasha in the preceding chapter. It may further W observed that in his references in this connection to Zohab and Shehrizor (Suleimai ‘ M he nowhere (if the small district of Shemiran specially referred to in chapter 35 5 excepted) asserts that the limits of the last-named province extend south of the IT ^ Shirwan, while in his official explanations to the representatives of the three Powers^ which he refers above, he is in direct contradiction with the statement made bv tb toman delegates on the present Turco-Persian Boundary Commission {Proce s-verbal No. 5 of the 25th April last) respecting the extension of the province of Suleimanieh in question south of the Shirwan (vide Enclosure 3 in Colonel Williams’ deqnnf^K + Sir S. Canning of the 21 st June, 1852). despatch to Chapter 33. . T h e definition, it may be noted, which Dervish Pasha in this chapter states was given by the Persian delegates in the conferences above alluded to of the limits of Zohab {vide Colonel Shed’s map) has, as will be seen from P voces -verbal No 4 of the 15th April last, been closely adhered to by their successor on the present commission Ihe chief objection of Dervish Pasha to the definition in question, which, he savs does not change the present shape of Zohab and renders the mention of eastern or mountainous lands and western or plain lands unmeaning, appears to be that it includes in that province the districts of Binkudra and Dekke situated in the anyle formed by the junction of the Rivers Elwend and Diyale (Shirwan), though &amp; in chapter 3/, in speaking of Kuretou, he appears to admit that the former of those two nahiehs was originally a dependency of Zohab. The further criticism which in the concluding part of the chapter Dervish Pasha passes on the omission of the then Peismn delegates tn include in their definition of Zohab the districts of Direh Kala thawin’ r hllan ’ and Gulem (? ulln ) 18 perhaps also deserving of attention, as showing question. 118 OPim0n ^ at ODe time ^dent on the province in Chapters 34, 35, 36, axd 38.

Kavtieh hill on^the' north 1 fide &amp; of 6 '?h^R^ 1 t h^. ancient frontier from Sermil to the me north side of the River Shirwan, Dervish Pasha proceeds in'chapter 39 to give his views as to what constitutes the line of the frontier in question from the above-mentioned hill to the Chigan pass. The quotation from the Treaty of Murad (1639) which he gives as bearing out his argument, viz., “the parts of the mountains on tho other side of Zalim castle near Shehr-i-Zor, which look towards that ^castle, have been conquered by us,” agrees in substance with the versions communicated ^jy the Turkish plenipotentiary at Erzeroum on the 17th and 21st November, 1843, respectively {vide treaties concluded between Turkey and Persia in 1639, 1746, and 1822, pp. 6 and 9), except that the words “have been conquered by us” appear to have been an addition of Dervish Pasha’s own, while, for the words “ on the other side of,” the versions above referred to read “above.” (Note .—The version in the Vienna copy of the treaty is, “ The villages on the mountain above Salim Cale (Zalim) near Chehrezor will be in the possession of the ;Sultan, and the villages lying on the east will be in the possession of the Shah.”) Here again, however, the direction which Dervish Pasha, conformably to the quotation given by him above, considers should be taken by the ancient frontier from the Kavtieh hill as far as Mount Dalemiz in the Avroman range, cannot be determined with any accuracy, for, though the position of Mount Dalemiz itself and of the mountains Kemajar and Dalani situated to the north of Shehr Avroman, through which he causes it to pass, are indicated on the reduction of the identic map (sheet 5), this is not the case with the mountains called by him Shindirva, Guzindar, and Shelvarder, all of which would appear to be to the south of Sheh Avroman and between that city and Mount Shahu. By his subsequent statement, viz., that “if, however, the original frontier be regarded as passing those points in the said mountain which are necessarily most suitable for a frontier, then some of the villages at present subject to Shehrezor, and in the possession of the Ottoman Empire, will have to be left on the other side, and some of the villages said to be subject to Avroman castle, and now in the Persians’ possession, on this side,” Dervish Pasha would himself appear to entertain some doubts as to the suitability as a boundary of the old frontier afcove described by him as being according to the Treaty of Murad. This alternative line, however, is, as will be seen, rejected by Dervish Pasha apparently as not being consistent with the clause in the treaty which leaves Avroman castle on the other side of (he., behind) the Avroman mountains. Consequently, he argues, it is impossible from the nature of the^ ground that the villages at present subject to Avroman and situated on this (the Turkish)^ side of the Avroman mountains should be subject to Avroman. Therefore, it is,_ he thinks, “ most probable ” that the phrase in the treaty “ the parts of the mountains on the other side of Zahm castle which look towards that castle means the whole of this side of the Avroman range which looks towards Zalim, i.e., towards Turkey. That this, viz. that the whole of the western face of the Avroman range should belong to the last-named country, is the conclusion which Dervish Pasha throughout the w 7 hole of the chapter has been endeavouring to establish, is shown by the tact that, alter a final enumeration of the localities from the Kavtieh hill to the Chigan pass, through which the line, according to his interpretation of the Treaty of Murad, should pass, he adds that this’interpretation will leave Avroman and its dependent villages, which are situated to the east and north-east of the mountains of Avroman, on the Persian side, while on the Turkish side will remain Shehrizor and its dependent villages which are to the south and south-west, together with seventeen villages which are on the nearer (the Turkish) face of the mountains and are to-day in Persian possession. Chapter 40. In this chapter, Dervish Pasha devotes considerable attention to the question of the ownership of the seventeen villages above alluded to by him. By his statement, however, that “ it cannot be properly understood from the text of the treaty on which side the ’treaty leaves these villages,” a statement which is substantially reproduced a little further in the chapter, it can hardly be said that he establishes a very conclusive right to their ownership by Turkey, if, indeed, the balance, according to v'hat he states is the “ present information,” is not in favour of Persia. His chief reason, in fact, here for the cession of these villages to Turkey v r ould seem to rest on the strategic principles which, according to him, should govern the delimitation of frontiers generally, but, whatever the ^alue of the arguments used in this connection by Dervish Pasha may be, the methods which he states in the concluding part of the chapter were adopted’ to obtain a declaration of Turkish allegiance from the inhabitants of thesevillages are, to say the least, not calculated to inspire confidence in the strength r his case. In concluding these observations on this portion of Dervish Pasha’s book it m not be without interest to recall that the latter, by the line of demarcation which h^ proposed some years later in the report presented by him to the mediating co V nnssionersof the commission of 1875 (Enclosure 2 in No. 1 in Sir G. Buchanan’s to Sir E. Grey No. Ill df the 4th April last), and by which BeyyatDiluranTchermnni and Deh Baba (Dehbala) are left to Persia, appears to have, entirely abandoned th^ lurkish claim to the Pusht-i-Kuh district. The acceptance, however, of the official map, pursuant to which Dervish Pasha states in the report in question that the above line of demarcation was proposed by him was, it will be recollected, provisional onlv and m any case such acceptance is not regarded by the present Ottoman commissionem as binding upon them, as the various proces-vcrbaux of the Frontier Commission now sitting at Constantinople have abundantly shown. sy .

I HAVE received your despatch No. 683 of the 13th August respecting the interests of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in the neighbourhood of Zohab and Kasr- i-Shirin in so far as they may be affected by a possible transfer of territory in this region from Persia to Turkey. Mr. Greenway, representing the company, called at this department on the 22nd August; 1m said that he had traversed the district in question last year, and that the only wells and stores owned by the company were at Tchiah Sourkh, a point about 24 miles north-north-east of Kasr-i-Shirin, as marked on the accompanying map. You will observe that they lie to the west of the red line, and^ aie accordingly included in territory which, according to the mediating commissioners interpretation of the Treaty of Erzeroum, should be Turkish, though it has remained in the de facto possession of Persia. . , . , From recent telegraphic correspondence I am in some doubt as to the attitude which the Russian Government intend to adopt respecting the transfer of this territory . if the transfer does not take place the interests of the oil company wid presumably remain as before; if it does take place—and I do not consider that it should be opposed by His Majesty’s Government merely on the ground that the interests o± the oil company might thereby be affected—it is convenient to consider in advance ow those interests can best be safeguarded. _ _ . , I understand from Mr. Green way that, ceteris paribus, it would be an advantage to the oil company if their Tchiah Sourkh property were recognised^as being in Turkish territory. The reason of this is that the company’s object ^ in maintaining their wells at Tchiah Sourkh is to provide for future local consumption m Mesopotamia, where they anticipate that there will be increasing demands for purposes of railway traction, and they would accordingly welcome the absence of any customs barrier, they do not, however, attach great importance to the option to lay a pipe-line to Bagdad m order that the wells may “ be brought into communication with navigable waters leading to the refinery on Abadan Island,” since, as Mr. Greenway argued even supposing that permission were granted for tank steamers to ply on the navigable waters, the cost q transporting the oil via Bagdad to Abadan Island would be prohibitive, and the oil could not compete commercially with that now brought to Abadan Island througn tiie existmg^pipe^e^urco_pergian frontier negotiations proceed,'it appears likely that the territory where the Tchiah Sourkh wells are situated is to be transferred to lurkey, it will then be advisable to address to the Ottoman Government a note m the_sense ot my telegram No. 696 of the 21st August to His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Reteisbmgh. A copy of this telegram-is enclosed for convenience of reference. • . , It will then be necessary to induce both Turkey and Persia to accept a stipulation in the document under which the territory would be transferred to the effect that each Power would recognise concessions granted by the other m temtory lans err y 0the Turkey would be debarred from questioning thenceforward the validity of the oil company’s rights, and, if the same stipulation provided for the benefits of ^ ^ of the concessionnaire passing to the new Sovereign, any need for a fresh grant concession would be obviated. . • ux n f t i 1P If Turkey accepted the above arrangements, and maintains that the lights Anatolian Railway Company under the convention of July 1904 did not ° 1 territory transferred, 1 am advised that it would be very difficult for that company to make ok a valid claim. The formula under which the territory would be transfer^d would, however, have to be prepared very carefully, and, m the event of the trans e taking p^5of'?kould desire to obtain legal advice on the subject. ^ ^ AA dm ’ E.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 645 of the 31st ultimo, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith two copies of Proces-verbal No. 15 of the sitting of the Turc '-Persian Frontier Commission of the 1st August last, containing the reply of the Persian delegates to the delimitation of the province of Suleimanieh given try the Ottoman members of the commission at the preceding sitting (Proces-verbal No. 14). As the line of argument adopted by the Persians on this occasion directly involves the question of the interpretation of article 3 of the Treaty of Erzeroum of 1847, and its bearing on the delimitation of frontier districts other than those of Suleimanieh, Zohab, and Mohammerah, the proceedings, I venture to think, are not without a certain importance. As regards the question of Suleimanieh, to which the Persian delegates first addressed themselves, the contention put forward by the latter was that the various transformations which, according to their Ottoman colleagues, the province in question had undergone did not affect the view put forward by them—the Persian delegates—in Proces-verbal No. 13, which was that the Suleimanieh of the Treaty of Erzeroum could not be conceived as having limits other than those of the treaty in question, under which it was ceded by Persia to Turkey. The rights of the latter country to Suleimanieh had been recognised by Persia, and there was therefore no occasion to discuss the extent either of the sanjak of Shehrizol or of the “sanjaks” of Kurdistan or of Suleimanieh with its thirty-two sanjaks, &amp;c. Further, of all the districts enumerated by the Turkish members of the commission in Proces-verbal No. 14 only those of Serdesht and Beitoush had been mentioned as forming part of Suleimanieh by the Ottoman delegates to the conference at Erzeroum, when officially stating the full extent of the territorial claims of their Government (in 1844). As by the compromise of the 21st December, 191 l, it v\as the Treaty of Erzeroum which had to serve as basis for their present discussions, it was obvious that no addition could be made to the number of Ottoman claims formulated at the conferences which resulted in the conclusion of the treaty in question. These claims were recapitulated at the eleventh sitting of the conference above referred to, and official note was, with the assent of the two plenipotentiaries, taken by the two mediating commissioners of the closure of the territorial discussion. It was therefore impossible that there could be claims concerning Suleimanieh other than those enumerated by Enveri Effendi (the then Ottoman plenipotentiary) under paragraph 3, viz., Serdesht and Beitoush. The Persian delegates concluded this part of their argument by stating that as regards these two last- mentioned districts the general sense of article 3 of the Treaty of Erzeroum, which, according to them, was alone authoritative in this matter, must be taken into consideration. In discussing this latter question, viz., that of the interpretation of article 3, the posi tion taken up by the Persian delegates was that, while recognising the existence of former treaties, these treaties in so far as they were concerned with territorial questions had been annulled and abrogated by the last Treaty of Erzeroum. Article 9 of the said treaty, it was further maintained by the Persian delegates, could have no bearing on the territorial question, being applicable only where omissions existed. But as by articles 2 and 3 of the treatv the question of territorial claims had received an explicit and peremptory solution, there was no occasion to refer to treaties anterior to that of 1847, apart entirely from the question of the authenticity of the latter. The points on the frontier subject to territorial modifications were settled by article 2 of the last Treaty of Erzeroum, while the article following laid down that at all other points the two parties abandoned their former pretensions, the meaning of which, according to the Persian delegates, was that the status quo of 1263 (1847) would assume the character of legal ownership. A translation of article 3 of the Treaty of Erzeroum was then given by the Persian delegates, as also a list of the claims put forward by the Ottoman plenipotentiary in the eleventh sitting of the conference at Erzeroum of the 4th January, 1844, with the [2597 3]Consul Shipley to Mr. Parker.—(Received August 19.) (Private.) Dear Parker, Constantinople, August 14, 1912. I HOPE you will kindly excuse me if my letter to you of to-day is a short one. I have in fact only just got back to Therapia from town, where 1 have passed the greater part of the day in presenting to the Persians, in company with Minorsky, the map containing the line in Mohammerah proposed to the Turks by our Govern ment. After this was done Minorsky urged very strongly on the Persian Ambassador the necessity of the immediate acceptance by them of the explanatory notes, a draft of the form which we thought this acceptance (unconditional) should take being further handed to him by my colleague. The latter also added that they, the Persians, could now do so safely as their interests in that region were secured, more in fact being claimed for them than was the case with the line of the mediating commissioners. The Persian Ambassador promised to act on our advice, and certainly seemed to me to be satisfied with our explanations. 1, of course, gave Minorsky my best support in the representations he made on this particular matter. As you will see by proces-verbal No. 15 which we are sending you to-day, the Persians are taking their stand on their interpretation of article 3, in which they are being strongly backed up by the Russians. The Turkish reply which will form proces- verbal No. 16, and will be given formally at to-morrow’s sitting, is, I understand from the Persian delegates, a very short one, and avoids going into the points raised, merely stating that the matter must be referred to The Hague. The Russians have promised us such of the proceedings of the Kemball Zelenoi Commission as are in their possession, and we hope to forward them very shortly. I trust also by next Wednesday’s bag to forward you a further instalment of the translation of Dervish Pasha’s book. Yours very sincerely, H. S. SHIPLEY. [2597 *--2] :30AUGW2^)Sir G.

In their opinion Persia is bound by the terms of article 2 of Treaty of Erzeroum, and must renounce that portion of Zohab allowed to Turkey by virtue of that article. As regards [? question as to whether] Russia and England should come to an understanding with regard to any other eventual concession to be made by Persia, the Imperial Government, while recognising the utility of such an understanding, consider that it would be advisable to invite the two Ambassadors to exchange their views on the subject, and to submit their conclusions to the two Governments. In the course of conversation his Excellency gave me to understand that in his opinion Persia could not be expected to make any concession beyond those laid down in article 2. 707 —1011] CORY TO; INDW*- 8EC RE TA 1 ttY'S v . ,,CONFIDENTIAL. , Sir Edward Grey to Mr. Marling (Constantinople), (No. 530.)

I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of Proces-verbal No. 14 of the sitting of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission of the 15th instant, containing the delimitation of the province of Suleimanieh given by the Turkish commissioners as opposed to that given by the Persian delegates in Proces-verbal No. 13, forwarded to you in my despatch No. 626 of the 25th last. As will be observed, the Ottoman delegates commenced their argument by a somewhat lengthy preamble, setting forth the administrative changes which the province in question had undergone since the year 964 Hegira (1557 a.d.), when its name, according to them, was Chehrizol (Chehrizar), up to the year 1179 Hegira (1766 a.d.), at which period its administrative provisions were apparently those of 1118 Hegira (1609 a.d.), with the addition, however, of the sanjaks of Bane and Sakiz, and with the exception of Mihridan and Avroman, ceded during the interval to Persia. The Ottoman delegates, after giving the above rdsum6, and after touching briefly on Persian aggressions in the Suleimanieh district, proceeded to refer, firstly, to the clause of the treaty of 1238 (1823), specifying the recognition by the Persian Government of the ancient frontiers of the Ottoman Empire, which frontiers, it is important to note, were asserted by the Turkish delegates to have been fixed by the treaty of 1049 (L639 a.d. ), the said treaty being reaffirmed by those of 1149 (1736) and 1159 (1746), and, secondly, to the stipulation in the said clause that no act of aggression should be committed by Persia on the sanjaks of Kurdistan and on the district of Kurdistan properly so called. Finally, after stating that with the exception of certain sanjaks which had been placed under Mosul, all other sanjaks of Kurdistan had later taken the name of Suleimanieh, a delimitation, as above stated, was given by the Ottoman delegates of the province itself, the possession of which by the Porte was recognised by the treaty of Erzeroum of 1263 (1847 a.d.). The exact line of this delimitation of this province of Suleimaneh was not given by the Turkish delegates, though there can be no doubt as to the vast extent the province in question has been caused to take under their definition, seeing that it is made to comprise territories so far apart as Maragba, Saoudj, Bulak, Sulduz, Ouchno (Ushnu), Sahidjan (Lahidjan), Band, and Sakiz in the north, Kizildje with its dependencies, and Pave, Chemiran, and Pushtikef (in Zohab) to the South Tashkessen, on the eastern shore of Lake Urmia, at which the limits of Suleimanieh are asserted by the Ottoman delegates to commence, is a village about half-way between the villages marked on the Royal Geographical Society’s map of Eastern Turkey in Asia, Syria, and Western Persia (1910) as Gugan and Khanagha. From Tashkessen the limits, according to the Ottoman delegates, reached the summits of Mount Sahend (a little to the south of Tabreez), subsequently following the mountains which divide the waters of the River Kizilenzen (Kiziluzun) from those of the River Tchegatu until they arrive at the frontiers of Kizildje. The precise point at which the line enters Kizildje is not stated by the Ottoman delegates, the only further indication given by them being that it passes along the crests of the Avroman range (thus leaving Mihriban and Avroman to Persia) terminating at Mount Chahou at the north-east corner of Zohab. The reply of the Persian delegates to the above delimitation is is course of preparation and will, I understand, be given very shortly. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. !l [•2597/—3]PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL No. 1. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 6.) (No. 641.) Constantinople, July 30, 1912. THE Minister for Foreign Affairs told me this morning that the Russian Ambassador, in speaking of the northern part of the Turco-Persian frontier, had said that his Government was interested in seeing a return to the status quo ante 1J05, and- when he, Gabriel Effendi, had asked his Excellency what that implied, M de Oxers had replied that the encroachments of the Ottoman troops since that date had been ascertained with a very considerable degree of accuracy by M. Mmorsky and Mr. Shipley, both of whom were now in Constantinople. M. de Giers had agreed to allow M. Minorsky to show him roughly the results of the joint enquiry, and Gabriel Effendi hoped that I would allow Mr. Shipley to accompany M. Minorsky. As Gabriel Effendi seemed disposed to make a point of it, and as also M. de_Giers had sent me word of his conversation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I agreed to Gabriel Effendi’s request, the more so as it appeared to me that the fact that the lurkish Minister for Foreign Affairs having invited the members of the Anglo-Russian Commission of last spring to furnish him with information is a useful recognition ot the position of the two Powers in the frontier question. CHARLES M. MARLING. [2597 /—6]PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL [34096] Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to Mr. Parker.—(Peeeived August 12.) (Confidential.) My dear Parker, Bushire, July 16, 1912. PLEASE refer to my telegram No 710, dated the 10th July, 1912, to the India Office, with reference to the islands in the Shatt-el-Arab which are claimed by the Sheikh of Mohammerah as Persian territory. The only island of any size in the river below Mohammerah is Muhalleh, and it seems from the record that the Turks are more likely to contest its ownership than that of the other islands, which are relatively of little importance to them. This being the case, I venture to direct attention to one or two points which favour possession by Persia ; you have probably already taken note of them. Item 7, p. Jo, Turco-Persian Frontier Negotiations, Part I (Foreign Office Print): Ramliyeh Island is identical with the modern Muhalleh, and the north end of the latter is still so called. The documents put forward by the Turks show it to be dependent on Mahallat Maharzi, which was then the chief place on the island of Jazirat-al-Khidhar (it is situated on the north-west corner; see map). Jazirat-al-Khidhar having been allocated to Persia by the treaty of Erzeroum, it follows that the islands dependent on it likewise fall to Persia in the absence of any special stipulation. The statement of the commissioners in February, 1850 (p. 75, Part III, idem), that they had carefully abstained from admitting the pretensions of Persia to the island of the Shatt-al-Arab, all of which lay to the west of Mohammerah and Jazirat-al-Khidhar, must, as far as the island of Muhalleh is concerned, be qualified by the fact that in November 1851, when the question of Muhalleh was raised in concrete form, they abstained from recording any opinion on the subject, and insisted on the maintenance of the status quo on the island (which was then admittedly in Persian hands) and in the town of Mohammerah (vide p. Ill et seq.). This plainly shows that they did not consider that the boundary line they had adumbrated in the previous year was a final settlement of the question. You rs faith fid 1 y, P.' Z. COX.

ISI2 F Amend ill [August 19.] Section 1. [34847] (No. Sir, No. 1. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 19. Constantinople, August 13, 1912. I VENTURE to supplement my telegram No. 280 of the 10th instant by submitting to you some reasons which lead me to believe that the cession by Persia to Turkey of the Kasr-i-Shirin districts would benefit the Anglo-Persian Oil Syndicate, which possesses wells situated in that district. The first and most obvious advantage would be that of increased security. The Government of Turkey, as we are but too well aware, is far from maintaining an ideal tranquillity even in more accessible places than Kasr-i-Shirin ; but, at all events, it is immeasurably more powerful than that of Persia; and, when its own interests or sufficient pressure from outside requires, it would be quite capable of giving adequate protection to the company’s property and employes. Again, the company is already doing a sufficiently remunerative business with Bagdad, so I gather from some recent reports of Mr. Lorimer, to make it worth while to bring out more plant, and it seems probable that when the artificial barrier of the frontier and the aggravating obstruc tiveness of the frontier officials are removed, the trade with Bagdad should increase still further. It is not likely, however, that the syndicate could ever reap any really considerable profits from this market, as the oil is unrefined, and the demand for it in that state could never be very large. But if, as a condition of the cession, we could obtain for the syndicate the right to lay a pipe line to Bagdad or some other more convenient spot a very much wider field is opened. The great obstacle to the development of the Kasr-i-Shirin oil-field has been the impossibility of laying a pipe line through Persia on account of the wild and lawless character of the inhabitants of the districts to be traversed, and the Porte has always opposed the laying of a line across the frontier. But with a pipe line to Bagdad or elsewhere the Kasr-i-Shirin w r ells would be brought into communication with navigable waters leading to the syndicate’s refinery on Abadan Island. It is also possible that, should the territory ceded to Turkey comprise only a part of the Kasr-i-Shirin oil-field, the syndicate could employ the pipe line to Bagdad even to carry oil from the part of the field in Persian territory. This, however, is looking far ahead, and there are other and more immediate considerations which I think deserve attention. One of the objects held in view by the framers of the existing mining law of Turkey was to prevent the acquisition of large tracts of country for speculative persons who had no intention of developing the properties themselves, and in the case of mines of copper, iron, &amp;c., which cover no considerable area, the object was legitimate and salutary ; but in practice the law has proved a great obstacle to ihe exploitation of the oil-fields in this country, where for profitable working it is essential that very large areas be held, and this under the mining law' as it stands can only be secured with great difficulty and at a prohibitive cost. With its Persian concession confirmed to it, the Anglo-Persian Oil Syndicate would, besides being the first in the field, be untrammelled by these restrictions, and would thus have a considerable advantage over possible competitors, such as, for instance, the Bagdad Railway Company, whose mining rights under the original concession are specifically subject to the observance of the mining law. This was, however, presumably not the case with the Anatolian Railway Company, which, as I reported in my telegram above referred to, maintains that it possesses preference rights for the w'orking of the oil-fields of Mosul and Bagdad vilayets under a convention granted to it by the Civil List in 1904. A copy of that convention is enclosed herewith, and some observations on the value of the company’s rights will be found in my despatch No. 931 of the 1st December, 1909. „ [ 259 7 t 1 ] I C( afi MJG 1912 N 30AUG1912R i SEC -if- A OV wmmmm•societe conservera un droit de preference a conditions egales vis-a-vis de toute autre personne on societe qui demanderait cette exploitation. Pour la Societe du Chemin de Per d’Anatolie, K. ZANDER. Le Ministre de la Liste civile, OHANNES SAKYZ. : Constantinople, le 16 juillet, 1601. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Memorandum by Mr. Weakley. ARTICLE 22 of the Bagdad Railway Convention grants certain mining privileges, as distinct from monopoly, within the Mosul and Bagdad provinces as at present detined, and therefore these privileges could not be claimed for mines discovered in a new territory added to these two provinces subsequent to the date of the convention.* The convention made between M. K. Zander and the Civil List of the 16th duly, ] 904, authorised the Anatolian Railway Company to carry out preliminary surveys of the petroleum-fields in the Mosul and Bagdad vilayets. Under this convention the Anatolian Railway Company had an optional right to work these petroleum deposits, but it was also stipulated that should the company fail to conclude a convention relative to the concession for working these petroleum deposits, they would, none the less, retain a right of preference on equal terms “ vis-a-vis de toute personne on societe qui demanderait cette exploitation.” This convention also only concerns the territory within the present administrative limits of the Mosul and Bagdad p rov i nc e s &gt; and cannot affect any other territory. I should therefore think that, supposing Kasr-i-Shirin were ceded to Turkey, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s interests would not be adversely affected by the stipulations of article 22 of the Bagdad convention or by the convention of 1904. I know of no other agreement. E. WEAKLEY. * Note .—The words “ within the Mosul and Bagdad provinces as at present defined ” are not expressly contained in article 22 of the Bagdad Railway Convention, which is as follows :— “ The concessionnaires may work any mines which they shall discover within a zone of 20 kilom. each side of the middle of the line, provided that they conform with the laws and regulations relating thereto, but this shall not give them a privilege or monopoly. “ They may likewise cut wood in the forests adjoining the line, either for timber or for charcoal, on application to the competent authorities, and if they conform to the regulations governing the matter.” A. P. It may also be useful to quote here Mr. Marling’s telegram No. 280 of &gt; the 11th August, 1912, and Mr. Hurst’s minute thereon :— “ (No. 280.) “ Turco-Persian frontier. “ Your telegram No. 408 of 7th August. “ Presuming that concession granted by Persian Government would retain its validity, I think that the cession would be of benefit to the company provided that we stipulated that the company should have right to lay pipe-line to Bagdad or other convenient spot. “Anatolian Railway Company maintain that, under a convention made with Civil List 1904, it retains right of preference over oilfields of Bagdad and Mosul vilayets, and it is on this that the Deutsche Bank and the National Bank are relying to obtain concession mentioned in my despatch No. 637 of the 27th July. Turks, however, have for some time consistently maintained that such rights have lapsed. I know of no other agreement, but presumably no such convention could affect territory recognised as de facto Persian at time when convention was made.”4 Minute by Mr. Hurst. The generalisation in the last sentence of Mr. Marling’s telegram is too wide. The question whether a concession to a private concern over a particular tract of land might not also cover after-acquired Turkish territory adjoining the tract must primarily be answered by reference to the terms of the concession. If the Anatolian Railway Company hold a concession to exploit the oil throughout the vilayets of Mosul and Bagdad, and Turkey obtains certain additional territory in Zohab upon the footing that it is and always has been hers by right, it is not at all improbable that the railway company’s concession is so worded that the right to exploit the oil, if still valid, will apply to the new territory as well as that now recognised as within the vilayets. I cannot say more because, as I have stated above it must depend primarily on the wording of the concession. : There is another question involved which is really distinct from the above, and that is the position of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company if Kasr-i-Shirin passes to Turkey. This company derives its rights from a concession granted by Persia, and if it is carrying on business and working the oil in territory which passes into Turkey’s possession upon the footing that Persia has no title to that territory, there will be a risk that the concession may be held to have ceased to operate in such territory. Persia had no right to grant such a concession except in respect of her own territory, and if i Kasr-i-Shirin passes to Turkey upon the footing that it was not Persian, it passes upon the footing that Persia had no right to grant such a concession, and the concession is therefore bad. This is what might happen if there is an arbitration and Zohab is awarded to Turkey. The upshot is, I think, that if an arrangement can be made as to the Zohab frontier by agreement, a saving of the rights of the oil company should be inserted in the document in which the agreement is embodied. By itself this might not exclude the Anatolian Railway Company’s claim, but probably some means could be found of meeting that difficulty.

I think we shall have considerable difficulty in inducing Turkey to agree to the maintenance of the status quo of 1848 along the whole frontier, since the protocol of December 1911 expressly laid down that the Treaty of Erzeroum was to be the basis of discussion, and article 2 of that treaty allocated a portion of Zohab to Turkey, and that portion has not been evacuated by Persia to this day. North of Zohab province I agree that there is more justification for insisting as far as possible on status quo of 1848, but can we ignore terms of Treaty of Erzeroum in deciding about Zohab province ? If we insisted on status quo there I doubt if we could induce Turkey to waive reference to Hague Tribunal. The alarm of the Persian Government at the rumour of concessions in Zohab has no bearing on the legal claim of Turkey. How do Russian Government meet this argument ? As to Mohammerah, in overriding mediating commissioners’ line, we are not departing from Treaty of Erzeroum, since mediating commissioners, as is apparent from the proc'es-vcrbaux, did not strictly adhere to that instrument.

If the Persian Government do not confirm the attitude of their delegates at Constantinople, the consequence may be that Turkey will disavow the Treaty of Erzeroum, with the result that Persia will lose her principal claim to any portion of the province of Zohab.

Would it not in any case be open to Turks to argue that if Civil List had intended its agreement with the Anatolian Railway to cover districts then not in de facto possession of Turkey, a stipulation to that effect would have appeared in the agreement ?

CONFIDENTIAL. [33340] No. 1 Consul Shipley to Mr. Parker.—(Received August 7.) (Private.) Dear Parker, Constantinople, July 31, 1912. I HAVE, I fear, very little to tell you in my letter of to-day about the past fortnight’s doings, as the interest during that period has mainly been in the question of the acceptance by the Persians of the explanatory notes and the communication to the Turkish Embassy by yourselves at the Foreign Office of His Majesty’s Government’s memorandum setting forth the latter’s proposals as regards Mohammerah, the former of which has been fully dealt with in our various telegrams to you, while as regards any action concerning the latter, we are, of course, awaiting instructions. In the meantime, as far as 1 could gather from what M. de Giers, whom I met by chance the day before yesterday, told me, the new Turkish Minister for 1 oreign Affairs has already received a hint from him respecting Russian wishes with regard to the northern part of the frontier, and, as you will see by the despatch we are sending you to-day, 1 and Minorsky are to go to-morrow to the Turkish h oreign Office to give the Minister exact information as to the extent of Turkish encroachments since 1905, of which he states he is ignorant. We are, of course, saying nothing to the Persians of the communication which the Foreign Office, as above stated, have made to the Turkish Embassy; while M. de Giers, in the conversation above alluded to, was very careful to point out that, in speaking to Noradunghian Effendi, he did not discuss the general frontier at all, confining his observations entirely to the northern part of it. As for our chances in getting a settlement with the new Cabinet, I cannot say that I feel they have become any greater, though it is perhaps too soon to form an opinion, especially in a country like Turkey. We have it, at any rate, in our favour that a concession of a sort (I refer to the line in Mohammerah Assim Bey gave us) has already been made which must, to a certain extent, bind the new Ministry. ^ ^ As you will see by Proces-verbal No. 14, which we send by to-day s bag, the Turks have put in their extreme pretensions as regards the extent of Suleimanieh—pretensions which, if admitted, would almost literally bring them to the gates of Tabreez. Further, as I imagined they would, they appeal once more, as they did in 1907-8, to the treaty of 1639 as bearing these pretensions out. This only furnishes one more proof, if such were needed, of the hopelessness of expecting the two parties to come to an agreement if left to themselves. With kind regards, Yours very sincerely, H. S.

IN continuation of my despatch No. 626 of the 24th instant, I have the honour to S p a ^ y°. u the . followin g details respecting the line of delimitation of the province of Suleimameh given by the Persian delegates at the sitting of the Turco-Persian r rentier Commission of the 11th July last (proces-verbal No. 13'. The line in question, I have ascertained from the Persian delegates, starts from a point on tlm Eiver Flwend a little to the east of Khanikin, whence, following the line of demarcation laid down by them in proces-verbal No. 4 as constituting the western limit of Zohab, it crosses to the right bank of the River Shirvan at the western extremity of Mount Kaschkan-Sirvani at a point some 5 miles to the south of a locality called Kan-i-1 chakal on the reduction of the identic map (sheet 5). From this latter P. 01 ^ the Pne, as will be observed from the proces-verbal in question, passing by the right bank ot the River Shirvan, would extend along the nearest crest of Mount Raiamon to the_ summit of the range of the same name (Mounts Kuh-i-Balambo and Balembo, reduction of identic map, sheet 5). From this last-mentioned summit the line would pass along the peaks of Chanervi and Kouhi Kouraneh (Kouhi Shenervi and Kouh Rekouvaneh, ibid.) to the northern summit of Gerdeneh-Gavkouch (Mount Tepega-Kousha-Pardouh or Gardouh (?), ibid.), would then follow the crest lying between the villages of Suskaneh and Tevileh (Tavila) so as to turn from the east to R 1 u uT tti- AC?, 1 ^'f' ter village and pass between the villages Belkheh-Sufla and Belkheh-Uha (Belkheb only marked on the reduction of the identic map) Then passing by the villages of Beareh, Khangermele (Khani Guermel, reduction identic map, sheet 7), Serkhete (Serkham), and Khanedoune (Khani Dounid, identic map, ibid. ; Kani Dunra, Maunselfs reduction, ibid.) it would pass by the east of Fort Zelm and to the west of Khanahgul (Bagh-Khane-Keul, identic map ; Khanikul, Maunselfs reauction) to reach the summit of Mount Sound, which is the most lofty of the main range of Avroman (Kouhi Sourene, reduction identic map, sheet 5), Berdeh-Reche (not marked on reduction identic map) of the above-mentioned range. After this the line would pass by Tchigan-Guedighi (i.e., Tchigan or Tchagan Pass, apparently not marked on reduction identic map or on MaunseH’s reduction) to the summit of Mount Bend-i- Ketchel (Kouhi Beden-i-Katchal, reduction identic map), turning from thence to the north-east so as to pass by the two villages of Rechan and Bozan (Reschan and Bouzan, ibid.) to reach the summit of Mount Siah Kou (Mount Siah Kouh to west of Benowa Souta, ibid.). From thence it would extend along the peaks of this mountain, following the streams and passing by the south of Benave-Soute (Benowa-Souta, vide supra-, Bmavasuta, Maunselfs reduction, sheet 7), it would turn to the north, passing by Benave-Soute to join the bed of the river Benave-Soute at the point w T here the streams of the two above-mentioned villages unite (vide Maunsell’s reduction, sheet 7). From this point it would take a direction towards the mam stream of the river which flows through the plain, and passing from the left to the right bank of this river, would abut on the principal summit of Mount Kouseh-Recha (Mount Kouh-i-Koce-Rescoa, reduction identic map, sheet 5). Following the crest stretching to the east of the village of Messoud (Masod, ibid.), the line in question coinciding at this point with the watershed, would then pass by the summits of the range of mountains—to the south, the east, and the north—of Tchillir and of Naokhan (i.e., the district of Teretul) mountains, called Kel-i-Milhk, Berd-i-Celsian (Berd-i-Cecenan, reduction identical map, sheet 5), Balikder- Hezar-Maleh _ (Bali-Keder Hazar-Mal, ibid.), Pouchti-Chehidan (Mount Pouscht Shahidan, ibid.), _ Guerdeneh-Naokhan (Berd-i-Nowkhan, ibid. ; Koh-i-Naokhan, Maunsells reduction, sheet 7), Sipkian (Spi-Kan, reduction identic map sheet 5) Douberde, Berdi-Vizman (Mounts Dou-Berde and Berd-i-Vouzma, ibid.)

For greater facility of reference I beg to enclose herewith a tracing'^ of the outline of the district referred to in the above-mentioned 'proces-verbol (No. 13), drawn by Mr. Shipley from sheet 7 of the reduction made by Colonel Maunsell of the identic map. The extent of the Persian claim in the district in question is shown approximately by a line in red ink drawn by Mr. Shipley with the assistance of the Persian delegates It may not be without interest to note that a comparison of this line with the chain dotted line given in Colonel Maunsell’s reduction above referred to will show that while from Mount Shenervi in the south to Binavasuta the Persian line is somewhat to the west of the chain dotted line in question, the two are practically identical from Binavasuta northwards as far as the River Kiveroo. ’CHARLES M.

He had better, therefore, simply say that His Majesty’s Government will take steps to ensure freedom of navigation on the river and other interests of the sheikh so far as they are compatible with the treaty and the explanatory note, and he should indicate to the sheikh the line of frontier we have proposed.

Constantinople, July 24, 1912. t+l x* l? honour to transmit to you herewith copies of proces-verbal No. 13 of the sitting of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission of the 1 tth instant, containing the reply given by the Turkish members of the commission to the arguments advanced by the Persian delegates at the preceding sitting (proces-verbal No. 12) respecting the question of Zohab, the remainder of the sitting being taken up by the definition of the limits of the province of Suleimanieh given by the Persian members of the commission at the request of their Ottoman colleagues. The Ottoman delegates, it will be observed from the proces-verbal above alluded to (INa 13), reaffirm their contention that the land registration relied on by them was in conformity with existing treaties, and that consequently the right of possession conferred by such registration could not be considered as an act of forcible seizure, as maintained by the Persian delegates. Further, the pretension put forward by the Persian delegates, viz., that the definition previously given bv the latter of the boundaries of Zohab corresponded to the definition alleged to have been given by the ^ (former) Turkish commissioners was, the Ottoman delegates maintained, not admissible, because, had an arrangement been arrived at respecting these boundaries, the present commission would have been under no obligation to discuss them, nor, the Ottoman delegates went on to say, had the commissioners of the two parties been sent to Zohab to delimit that province according to a conception incompatible with the provisions of the treaty of Erzeroum. The Ottoman delegates then proceeded to ^ comment on the fact that their Persian colleagues, while relying on certain opinions of former Turkish commissioners—opinions of the nature of which they, the Ottoman delegates, professed themselves wholly ignorant—in so far as these opinions corresponded to the interests of Persia, left aside the arguments of the said com missioners where these arguments established Ottoman rights. The opinions in question, it was contended by the Ottoman delegates, could never, as was maintained by their Persian colleagues, be made to serve as “documents by virtue of general juridical principles, so long as the contrary could be proved by treaties in force and by documents of which they, the Ottoman delegates, were in possession. The latter finally completed their argument with the statement that, as the long and fruitless discussion on the subject had shown that the Persian delegates persisted in their views, wnich were neither in conformity with the spirit of the Treaty of Erzeroum nor justified by any document, it only remained to them to defer this question also to the impartial judgment of The Hague Tribunal. I am compelled to defer my observations on the definition which was given at the conclusion of the sitting by the Persian delegates of the limits of the province of Suleimanieh until I am in receipt of certain further explanations with which the Persian delegates have promised to furnish Mr. Shipley.

YOUR telegram No. 424 Foreign Office, August 7, 1912. and Bushire telegram of 6th August. Copies of the maps of the Mohammerah frontier which we have proposed to Turkish Government were posted to Tehran and Bushire on 19th July. The line which we have proposed to Turkey is more advantageous to Persia than that which was proposed by mediating commissioners in 1850 and then accepted by Persia, so that Persia should be satisfied if Turkey accedes to our present proposal. It seems to me that the most expedient course now would be for you to communicate a copy of the map confidentially to the Persian Government, for Sir P. Cox to do likewise to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and for Mr. Marling to do likewise to the Persian delegates at Constantinople ; at the same time it might be explained J that, while we hope to secure the frontier we have proposed, we are not satisfied, in view of the wording of article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum, that Turkey is legally bound to recognise the modern port and anchorage of Mohammerah in so far as it is in the main stream of the Shatt-el-Arab and not in the Karun, and on this point it may be impossible to maintain the line we have proposed to Turkey ; but we will do our best, 1 and in any case we should provide against any arbitrary interference with the commercial interests of the port of Mohammerah. • Before deciding on this course I should like your observations and those of Sir P.

Please make a communication in following sense to the Russian Government :— His Majesty’s Government are fully disposed to co-operate with Russia in promoting a settlement in whatever manner may appear most practicable ; but they are advised that it is arguable that article 3 of the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) relates exclusively to the districts mentioned in article 2, and not to the rest of the frontier. If this view is correct, and it has consistently been maintained by Turkey, article 3 does not perpetuate the territorial status quo of 1847. His Majesty’s Government presume that the Russian Government have not overlooked the Anglo-Russian joint note of 10th August, 1849, to the Porte, in the last sentence of which the Turkish inter pretation was virtually upheld. As to the Shatt-el-Arab, His Majesty’s Government are only prepared to recognise Turkish rights over the waterway, and that only on certain conditions; they are not prepared to recognise Turkish “ exclusive rights all along the river.” As His Majesty’s Government are now negotiating direct with Turkey on this subject, they would much prefer that no statement should be made by the Persian delegates about it at presents They agree, however, to the delegates being advised to accept the explanatory note, and have instructed British Embassy accordingly, so that this can be done at once. Unless some concessions are made to Turkey on other parts of the frontier, she is unlikely to waive appeal to The Hague ; there are no doubt objections to concessions at Zohab, but they seem less than elsewhere. In any case, Persia will presumably have to evacuate territory in Zohab to the west of the line proposed by mediating commissioners in 1852 (see map attached to Foreign Office memorandum of December 1906), and some further concessions in Zohab to the east of the mediating commissioners line might be made if Persia were allowed to retain Kasr-i-Shirin.

THE translation ot the preface to Dervish Pasha’s book which we have annexed to proces-verbal No. 12, forwarded by to-day’s bag in our despatch No. 603 will I think, supply the answer to the question contained in your letter to me of the 8th instant. If the statement made by Dervish Pasha himself in the preface in { question 1S to be relied upon, his book and his report are one and the same thinu- The statement in my letter to you of the 3rd instant, viz., that the book was f “ founded in the report previously presented by him to the Porte,” was due to a misreading on my part of a Turkish word, for which I beg to express my great regret In any case, on receipt of the Foreign Office despatch No. 168 of the 29th April and before sending home the Foreign Office translation from the book, I had been informed both by Minorsky and by Itila-el-Mulk, from whom I made express enquiry, that they possessed nothing else but the book itself. M. de Klemm, as you will recollect from Sir G. Buchanan’s despatch No._ 130 of the 21st April, only states that “ Dervish Pasha’s report is a long book in Turkish, of which the Bussian Government only possess a photographic copy,” this being the copy from which our translation was made. He makes no mention of a separate report. You will perhaps allow me to add that I fully realise that the translation of the preface should have been included with the translation of the portion we sent, but I hope that you will put down my failure to do so not to negligence on my part, but to an error of judgment. As far as the commission is concerned, proces-verbaux Nos. 10 and 11, forwarded to you by Wednesday’s bag, and No. 12 which we are sending to-day, almost bring the proceedings up to date. There is, howe ver, a further proces-verbal of the sitting of the 11th instant, but as it has only just reached us, it has been impossible to forward it by this bag. It contains the leply of the lurkish delegates to the Persian summary respecting the Zobat question, given in pyroces-verbal No. 12, the former stating in concluding their argument that this question also must be referred to The Hague : a definition of the boundaries of Suleimanieh (referred to in article 2 of the Treaty of Erzeroum) was given at the same sitting by the Persian delegates, to which the Turks were to reply at the next sitting (the 15th instant). The proces-verbal in question (No. 13), which necessitates a careful and lengthy reference to the maps, will be forwarded in a few days. You will perhaps notice that the arguments of the Persian delegates, in proces-verbal No. 12, whatever their worth may be, have been put with quite unusual brevity and clearness. I gathered from Itila-el-Mulk that they—the Persian delegates were assisted in the matter by the Bussians, and if this is so, it would account for the argument under paragraph 3 (first heading) and the reference to “juridical principles ” under paragraph 3 (second heading). The result generally of the work of the commission so far has, I fear, not been such as to encourage much hope of an understanding being arrived at in the commission itself. If anything is done, it would seem that it will be by an arrangement outside, and I think this explains the growing- anxiety of the Bussians referred to in Marling’s telegram of to-day, as I think they wish to begin direct negotiations with the Turkish Government respecting the northern part of the frontier, as we ourselves are doing in the south. Assim Bey has certainly shown himself conciliatory so far, and if he will keep to the assurances he has given us, we may hope to get one part at least of the frontier question settled once for all. With kind regards as always, yours very sincerely, H. S. SHIPLEY. P.S.—The date 1269 (1853 a.d.) given in my last letter as being the date of the presentation by Dervish Pasha of his report or m emor andum was correct. As^the book itself, however, was printed in 1286 (1868 a.d.), |he interval should have been fifteen years, and not as then stated by me. | g AIM' 191' [2545 z—3] 6 AUG 1912; 4 TEC !' Ill ! 1 |i'.

The argument under paragraph 3, however, viz, that land regis tration being an unilateral act, cannot constitute conclusive proof of ownership as otherwise any act of forcible seizure by any State of territory belonging to another would create rights for the aggressor on these acquisitions being placed by the latter on its land registers, is deserving of note. With regard to the delimitation of Zohnb, the province of Zohab itself as distinct from any claim of ownership, the line taken by the Persian delegates is, it will be seen, the same as that followed by them during the whole of the discussion on the subject! the boundaries of the province in question, as defined by them in Proces-verbal No. 4, above alluded to, correspond, it is pointed out by them, with the boundaries as laid down by the Ottoman Commissioners in. 1266 (1850). In this connection particular stress, as you will observe, is laid by the Persian delegates on the official status of Dervish Pasha, the then Ottoman commissioner, and on the official nature of the report presented by him to the Sublime Porte, as shown by ~- le P re fece, his argument being concluded by the contention, firstly, that notwith standing the fact that the territorial status of the frontier has at all times been subject to change, the Zohab mentioned in the Treaty of Erzeroum could not be conceived as having.other boundaries than those which it was held to have in 1268 (1847) ; and secondly, by the assertion that, apart from claims put forward by the Turkish com missioners, which were not allowed by Persia, it was obvious that where these commissioners recognised Persian rights, or the justice of the reasons advanced by the Persians, such recognition acquired documentary importance by virtue of general juridical principles. As express reference was made by the Persian delegates in the proces-verbal under discussion to the preface to the report presented by Dervish Pasha to the Sublime Porte, I enclose herewith a translation which I have caused to be made of the preface in question, which forms the prefix to the book, translation of chapters 1 to 18, of which was forwarded to you in Sir G.

MEMORANDUM drawn up chapter by chapter by his Excellency Field-Marshal Dervish Pasha, delegate for the delimitation of the Persian frontier, and presented in Jemazi-ul-Akhir 12*69 (1853). The memorandum, which is based on information obtained by Dervish Pasha in the course of his duties, deals with the line of frontier between the territories of the two States from beginning to end according to the nresent knowledge of the tribes on both sides, to^ references m old treaties and to conclusions as to the places which form the old frontier obtained from competent persons and from certain official documents.

(No. 209. Confidential.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, July 5, 1912. IN the conversation which I had, as reported in my immediately preceding despatch, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 29th ultimo on the subject of the Turco-Persian frontier negotiations, I said to his Excellency that I could not under stand why the Russian Government considered that a reference of the question to arbitration would be likely to prove favourable to the Turkish claims so far as the more northerly portion of the frontier was concerned. I said that we had seen the Turkish encroachments on Persian territory take place under our very eyes during the last few years. Turkey, during this period, might have induced local personages to execute deeds of sale or other documents seeming to tell in her favour, but it was inconceivable that these could be considered by any arbitration court as giving Turkey a valid title to the districts which she had occupied. M. Sazonof replied that he was assured (by M. Minorsky, as I understand), that the Turks had been most energetic and industrious in providing themselves with documents designed to show their title to the territories in dispute. It was not a very difficult thing to produce acts and deeds purporting to date from the time of Sultan Murad IV or other distant periods, and the Persians might find it difficult to refute the authenticity of such documents On the other hand the Persian authorities had been excessively remiss in the preservation and collection of papers establishing their ancient rights in the contested districts. Apparently, as I gathered, the Persians had shown themselves lacking in the skill and enterprise displayed by the Turks. At any rate M. Sazonof seemed to think that an arbitration court, looking at the question from a purely legal and formal point of view, might consider that the Turkish claims were better supported than the Persian, and he was clearly most anxious that a settlement of the frontier question should be arrived at by the mixed commission now^ sitting. For if the matter went to arbitration, and the arbitration court upheld Turkey’s claims to all the territories which she now holds, M. Sazonof would consider it impossible for Russia to recognise the tribunal’s decision. I have, &amp;c.

HAYING received your telegrams Nos. 534 and 542 of the 27th and 28th June, respectively, T had an interview with the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 29th June, and laid before him the reasons why His Majesty’s Government thought it important that the Persian delegates on the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission should postpone for a few weeks accepting the “ explanatory note ” of the two mediating Powers of 1850, so as to allow time for the conclusion of the pending negotiations with Turkey regarding the Mohammerah boundary question. M. Sazonof said that he was most desirous of assisting His Majesty’s Government in every possible way in their negotiations respecting Mohammerah. At the same time, he expressed great anxiety regarding the more northerly portion of the Turco-Persian frontier, in which Russia was deeply interested. He explained that, if the Persian delegates postponed their acceptance of the explanatory note for some weeks, he feared that the commission would fail to reach a complete agreement within the six months’ time specified in the protocol of the 21st December, 1911, and the Turks would then insist on referring the northern frontier question to The Hague Tribunal. He believed that if the question went to The Hague, Turkey might make good her claims to the districts in the vicinity of Urmia, which she had occupied since 1905. While Russia could scarcely hope to secure a complete return to the status quo of 1905, she could not possibly permit Turkey to remain in possession of certain of the positions which she now occupied. He was prepared to join His Majesty’s Government in any pressure which they might consider it necessary to use with the Ottoman Government in connection wit 1 1 the Mohammerah boundary question, and, on the other hand, he earnestly trusted that His Majesty’s Government would act in the same way towards Russia in regard to the northern part of the frontier. His Excellency further expressed the apprehension that, if the Persian delegates refused or delayed their acceptance of the explanatory note, the lurks would have a pretext for declaring that they were not bound by the Treaty of Erzeroum. This, he considered, would place Russia in a very disadvantageous position as regards the part of the frontier that interested her. He therefore urged the importance of settling the Mohammerah question and of the Persians accepting the explanatory note with the least possible delay. As I had the honour to report by my telegram No. 231 of the 29th ultimo, I asked his Excellency, as a sort of compromise, to instruct the Russian Ambassador at Constantinople to advise the Persian delegates that they should suspend their proposed acceptance of the explanatory note, at any rate for a while, so that the British and Russian Governments should have time to discuss the matter further and come to an agreement between themselves. To this he consented. I received your further instructions on the 2nd instant, but was unable to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs again before his departure for Baltic Port. ^ I accordingly addressed him an aide-memoire respecting the course which His Majesty s Government intended to pursue in regard to the Mohammerah question, and a letter conveying to him your assurance of full diplomatic support in the northern frontier question, and asking what was the line of frontier which Russia would accept. Copies of these communications are enclosed herewith, as also a copy of the letter which I leceived from his Excellency in reply. I have, &amp;e: HUGH O’BEIRNE.

St. Petersburgh, August 4, 1912, 8T5 p.m YOUR telegram No. 594 Memorandum from Russian Government states that Russian Ambassador at Constantinople considers that certain concessions from Persia to Turkey m Zohab are possible in principle; but that it seems premature to raise this question now, seeing that Russian claims in regard to northern part of frontier are founded on such a solid basis as article 3 of Treaty of Erzeroum, and especially that Russian arguments as to that part of the frontier have not yet been communicated to the Ottoman Government. Moreover, Zohab, by convention of 26th August, is m Russian zone, includes Kasr-i-Shirin, and might in time become of importance if the joining up of the Asia Minor railways with Persian Khanikin line were effected. For the present, therefore, two Powers should confine themselves to offering to Porte their support in obtaining Persia’s recognition of Turkey’s exclusive rights all along Shatt-el-Arab, the concessions in Zohab being reserved for future eventualities. Ambassador thinks that it would be better at present for Persia not to demand the acceptance by Turkey of the identic map so as not to complicate question^ of observance by Turkey of the status quo based on article 3 of Treaty of Erzeroum. Persian Government, in making their communication as to the acceptance of identic note, might confine themselves to [?] intimation that they are following the advice of mediating Powers, who for seventy years have not ceased [ ?] offering their good offices to disputing parties. .

However, as His Majesty’s Government have already made a communication to the Ottoman Govern ment in regard to Mohammerah, Russian Government find themselves obliged to enter into negotiations with Ottoman Government with a view to insisting on maintenance of status quo of 1905 in regard to that part of the frontier which stretches approximately from Mount Ararat to Suleimanieh.

Mohammerah Frontier. /ilG* HIS Majesty’s Government have already informed the Imperial Ottoman Govern ment of the great importance which they attach to the maintenance of the frontier status quo, as locally observed, in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. His Majesty’s Government now have the honour to explain their views in greater detail, and they would preface their statement by observing that they have not only re-examined all the evidence, both oral and documentary, which was laid before the conference of Erzeroum, but they have also had recourse to the great store of information collected by the well-known savant Major (afterwards Sir Henry) Rawlinson, who was well acquainted with the country, and made a profound study of the territorial position m the Mohammerah region, based upon historical facts and the deeds of title relating to each particular plot of land. ^ Moreover, much information, which was not at the disposal of the Commissioners at Erzeroum, has been traced in the voluminous records of the East India Company, who carried on direct tiade vith Bussorah from the year 1635. These records are especially illuminating in regard to the conditions which actually prevailed on the waters of the Shatt-el-Aiab duiing the 17th and 18th centuries. The accompanying maps indicate the line of the frontier as it has been locally observed for a century or more. For facility of reference, the line may be followed, firstly, from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where it strikes the Shatt- el-Arab, and, secondly, along the course of that river until it reaches the sea. By reference to the accompanying map No. 1, the village of Shu’aib will be observed at a point 15f miles on a bearing of 8 degrees north of west from Havyizeh : it is a settled village of the Beni Salih, containing some 500 inhabitants living in permanent dwellings. The whole country, comprised approximately in a triangle formed by lines joining Hawizeh, Shu’aib, and Kuskh-i-Basri, is regularly occupied and cultivated by the tribes of Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, who are not nomadic, in the ordinary sense of the term, but are settled inhabitants. These tribes, who exclusively inhabit, and wdiere possible cultivate, the triangular tract above referred to, have belonged from time immemorial to Hawizeh, which has been a recognised district of the Persian province of Khuzistan or Arabistan for, at any rate, four centuries. They pay revenue to their tribal sheikhs, who formerly passed it on in tribute to the “ Maula ” ruler of Hawizeh, who in turn paid it to the Persian Government, but, since 1902. this tribute has been collected through the agency of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. . To the eastward of the marsh on which the village of Shu aib is situated, and southwards, as far as human occupation prevails or is possible, there is not the slightest sign of Turkish influence or jurisdiction, nor of Turkish status.. The British Resident in the Persian Gulf has recently visited the Hawizeh district, and his investigations have seiw^Uio confirm the information which His Majesty’s [2545 r—3] ^ ^ &gt; .o Government already possessed. Apart from the sheikhs and tribesmen of the Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, Sir Percy Cox came in contact with many old inhabitants who could speak with long experience in regard to the territorial status quo. The view universally expressed as to the frontier was as follows :— 1. That whatever is the western boundary of the Hawizeh is, ipso facto, the frontier of Persia: in other words, that the Hawizeh district is included within the confines of Persia. 2. That the “Hawizeh district’’ comprises those lands which are regularly occupied and cultivated by tribes belonging to it, and paying revenue to Persia. 3. That, on the above premises, the boundary locally recognised is that shown by a green line on map No. 1. It will be noticed that the line'(which is formed by the edge of the marsh, and is thus a natural frontier), after crossing the Ghor-el-Azem, eventually cuts the mam channel of the marsh just west of Shu’aib, continues in a southeily diiection until it reaches a point due west of Kuskh-i Basri, whence it breaks back to that place, and then proceeds direct to the Shatt-el-Arab at Di’aiji. The reason why Kuskh-i-Basri is recognised as an angle of the boundary is referable to the existence of a winter lake of rain water at Yafair; the limit of cultivation and occupation by tribesmen under Hawizeh in this direction is regulated by the distance Iron! their water supply (Yafair), at which they can safely dwell and keep their flocks, and this limit ^ is considered to be reached at Kuskh-i-Basri, where the ruins of an extensive building of great age form a convenient landmark. His Majesty s Government, being in possession of precise and trustworthy information regarding the frontier of Hawizeh, have no occasion to appeal to more uncertain authorities, but they think it is not without interest to recall to the Imperial Ottoman Govermnent that Dervish Pasha, whose estimates of Turkish claims were not usually marked by excessive moderation, admits in Chapter XIII of his book (printed m Constantinople in 1868), “ that it would be hardly right ” for the Ottoman Government to lay claim to the country of Hawizeh, though, in the subsequent chapter his Excellency expresses the view that it “ might be useful ” for Turkey to claim it as MTounV^HbZlhfrir 6 g elSe ’ ViZ '’ tha ‘ th6 K6rkha Sh0 ' lld be ad0 I’ ted as Coming now to the neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Arab, the frontier as locallv observed enters the Khaiym Canal (which is the name of the channel running from the Pinkish Customs Post at Di aiji, between the islands of Kharnubiyah, Bowarin and Aqawat, to the junction of the Nahr Nazaileh with the main stream) it a poini between the Xahr Diaij 1 and the Nahr Abul Arabid; it follows the middle of the Nahr Khmyin until it reaches the point where the Nahr Khaiyin and the Nahr Nazaileh meet the mam channel of the Shatt-el-Arab.

H, therefore, His Majesty s Government had strict regard either to purely local considerations or to the letter of the treaties, they would not hesitate to press for the irontier as locally recognised along its whole length from Hawizeh to the Persian Gulf. But they prefer to look at the negotiations in which they are now engaged as a whole, and are sincerely anxious to arrive at an arrangement which both paities can accept ex animo, and which, by removing all points of grievance and friction not only between themselves, but also between the Sublime Porte and the oheikh of Mohammerah, will place the relations of all concerned on a thoroughly satisfactory footing. Provided, therefore, the Turkish Government will accept the frontier status ^uo as _ already indicated from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the pomt where the Khaiyin Canal and the Nahr Nazaileh enter the Shatt-el-Arab, then His Majesty s Government are prepared to use their influence with the Persian Govern ment the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to recognise Turkish sovereignty over the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, subject to the following conditions :— (i-) The following islands to be recognised as within the territorial limits of Persia:— (a.) Muhalleh and its adjunct Bahriyeh, the four islands situated between Shatait and Ma awiyeh, and the two islands off Manquhi. These islands are in fact parts of the island of Abadan, and must be so regarded. (b.) Any islands now in existence, or which may hereafter be formed, and which may be connected at low water either with Abadan Island or with the Persian bank below the Nahr Nazaileh. (ii.) The arrangements proposed by His Majesty’s Government for maintaining full freedom of navigation on the river, and for its conservancy, to be accepted by the Ottoman Government. (iii.) The modern port and anchorage of Mohammerah, which is in the main stream of the Shatt-el-Arab above and below its junction with the Karun, to be recognised as within Persian jurisdiction. (See Map No. 2.) (iv.) No interference to take place with existing fishing rights and usages on or from the Persian bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, that phrase being understood to comprise all land on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab or on the Persian islands therein which is uncovered at normal low tide. (v.) Turkish jurisdiction not to extend to land on the Persian bank, defined as above, which is only temporarily covered with water in time of flood or from any accidental cause, and Persian jurisdiction not to extend to land which is temporarily or accidentally uncovered below normal low-water mark. (yi.) The Sheikh of Mohammerah to continue in full enjoyment of his existing proprietary rights in lands situated in Turkish territory.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government,] [Bj PERSIA.

(No. Sir, Nos. 10 and 11, containing the account of the proceedings of the sittings of the Turco- Persian Commission of the 20th and 24th June last, respectively. A perusal of the proves-verbaux above alluded to will show that as far as Zohab, which formed the immediate subject of discussion at the sittings in question, is concerned, matters remain practically where they were, the Persians merely reiterating their arguments as to the non-existence of treaties in force between the two States which could render valid the registration of certain lands which the Ottoman Government relied on as proof of ownership and as showing that these lands did not form part of the province of Zohab properly so called. The contrary was maintained with equal persistence by the Ottoman delegates on their part, the latter on this occasion going so far as to assert that the contention in this respect of their Persian colleagues, opposed as it was to article 9 of the Treaty of Erzeroum, could not be made the subject of serious discussion. It will be noted, however, that the Ottoman delegates, as a further argument and in reply to the demand of the Persian delegates for the production of a treaty contemporaneous with the date—951 a.h. (1544 a.d.)— of the first registration by the Ottoman Government of these lands, stated that such treaty was unnecessary, the registration in question being in conformity with treaties still in force between the two countries concluded after that date. The further statement by the Persian delegates—that if land registers could be cited as proof, such registers, dating from the beginning of the Kajar dynasty, were also in existence at the Persian Ministry of Finance, was met by the Ottoman delegates with the rejoinder that the period in question, viz., 1796, was a time when Persian aggressions on Ottoman territory were in full course, and that registrations which referred to that date could not be held valid unless it were in conformity with treaties in force, thus, it will be observed, turning against the Persians the argument on which the latter have hitherto chiefly relied. ottoman, le Gouvernement persan n’aurait pu avoir des pretentions et n’aurait pas envoye des Gouverneurs generaux pour son administration, ainsi qu’il ne se serait pas desiste par le Traite d’Erzeroum, 1263, de ses droits iegaux sur le sandjiak ottoman.

Pour la Perse : Les membres de la delegation persane. SON Excellence Mirza Mahmoud Han donne lecture de la declaration suivante : “En ce qui regarde la non-existence d’autres traites en vigueur,sauf celui d’Erzeroum, la delegation persane reitere cette assertion, se basant sur les considerations suivantes : si en vertu d’un traite, le sandjiak de Suleimanieh avait dte cede au Gouvernement [2545 p —2]fo Hague. It seems probable that tbe commissioners will not agree as to whetber m intei pi eting tbe treaty the explanatory note is to be taken into account, and that this point will have to go to The Hague. ( 2 .) If the terms of the protocol alone are looked at, I think that the omission of all reference to the explanatory note suggests that it was not to be taken into account—or at any rate that it is quite possible that The Hague Tribunal would take that view. But the difficulty arises from the “ acceptance ” of the explanatory note by the Persian plenipotentiary in 1848, which is printed on pp. 64-65 of 10041. In view of the terms of this document, I think (though of course it is impossible to forecast the decision of he Hague Tribunal) that it would probably be held that the Persian Government are bound to accept the assurances given to the Porte by the mediating Powers on the hist three points, unless it could be shown that the Persian plenipotentiary exceeded Is powers in signing the document. Whether this would be possible one cannot s&amp;y without seeing the instructions given him by the Persian Government. It is, however, ^ ,^’ 0 c ^ ear ^ ia, k ^ ie ac ^ on °f Lord Cowley and M. de Titof in 1848, as to which see PP' Hr. Parker’s memorandum (14638), and the correspondence printed on pp. 47-65 of 10041, precludes the British and Russian Governments from con tending that Persia is not bound by the explanatory note. ( 3 .) I am not sure that I agree with Mr. Shipley and M. Minorsky that if The Ha one tribunal decides that the treaty is not to be read in the light of the explanatory note in key could decline to be bound by the treaty. From a legal point of view, it seems o me that lurkey has bound herself by the protocol of December last to accept the treaty as the basis of discussion. A difference of opinion arises as to whether the explanatory note is to be considered as part of, or interpreting, the treatv, and The ilagne Inbunal, to whom the point is referred under the protocol, decides that it is not It seems to me that technically Turkey is then bound by the treaty without the explanatory note, though she would have a strong case morally, and considerable cause Ll Foreign Office, June 16, 1912.

I agree to proposed communication to Persian Government if the Russian Govern ment agree, but I think we should impress upon Persian Government the necessity of consulting us as to what concessions they ask from Turkey in return for Persian acceptance of explanatory note. We have not yet informed Persian Government of our communication made to Turkish Ambassador on 18th July respecting frontier we recommend at Mohammerah. If Turkish Government meet our views in regard to Mohammerah and Russian views in regard to northern part of frontier, would Russian Government be prepared to join us in urging upon Persia some corresponding concession to Turkey in the Zohab region ? Such a concession would, we know, not be agreeable to Persia, but it seems to afford the only equitable means of compromise and of avoiding a reference to The Hague Tribunal.

I agree with him that this is a valid argument, but at the same time it appears to me that®when the Turks have accepted the locally observed line at Mohammerah, out of deference to us, they will probably ask whether [? compromise] obtained for them some compensation from Persia elsewhere. ^ He admits that task of obtaining recognition of locally observed line is not facilitated for us by appointment to Ministry for Foreign Affairs of a Christian, who, as such, must show himself more Turkish than the Turks in a question concerning abandonment of claim to territory, but he thinks that Turkish Government will realise that they cannot afford to quarrel with us over so small a matter just now. 25JUL1912 A L?C7 -c£ 6 7 f CONFIDENTIAL 1S12 .. j *.

From telegrams which he has lately received from them it has become apparent to him that both Central Government and Persian representative at Constantinople are extremely ill informed regarding local position and geographical details, and quite incapable of looking after their interests effectively. He tlras feels that those interests, which are mainly his own, are in very bad hands, and he even fears that the present regime at Tehran, with its strong Bakhtiari element, would probably sacrifice them with little compunction in exchange for advantage elsewhere. In the above connection he remarked that were it not that he relied on our community of interests and effective support he would now have to be taking active measures to make his position safe, but that, things being as they were, he was doing no more than prepare himself to act on the frontier in case any of the aggressive intentions with which rumour credits Turks should take shape.

[i^V YOUR telegram No. 575 Russian Government have sent me a memorandum stating that they cannot relinquish their opinion that it is of the highest importance that Persia should promptly accept explanatory note, and that Ottoman Government should he induced to recognise status quo of the present frontier line near Mohammerah by direct pressure, which His Majesty’s Government have decided to exercise on them. Russian Government consider it very doubtful whether Ottoman Government would accept condition suggested in your telegram under reply, namely, that they should recognise locally observed boundary in Mohammerah and Hawiza region if such a condition were put forward by Persia. ^ If, however, Persian Government accepted explanatory note without this reservation, they could in exchange insist that Turkey should recognise other suggestions made at various times by mediating Powers, and especially identic map of 1870, which would be of great importance. If explanatory note be only accepted by Persia after Ottoman Government have given way to demands of His Majesty’s Government in regard to frontier near Mohammerah, Persia’s concession would no longer have any value in the eyes of the Porte, and there would no longer be any chance of the identic map and of other questions advantageous to Persia receiving a favourable solution. If, on the contrary, Persia accepts the explanatory note before an arrangement be come to between Ottoman Government and His Majesty’s Government in regard to Mohammerah frontier, Persia w'ould probably be able to obtain certain concessions. Furthermore, Persia’s refusal to recognise validity of such an important document as identic note signed by representatives of the two mediating Powers is calculated to discredit generally the suggestions made at various times by those Powers to disputants. Russian Government therefore think it very desirable that Persia’s adherence to explanatory note should not be postponed. They have, however, instructed their representative at Constantinople to consider question carefully in concert with His Majesty’s Ambassador, with a view to finding a solution as far as possible in accordance with respective interests of the two Powers.

CONFIDENTIAL. I M 2^ C [July 9.J Section 1. [29190 No. 1 . Consul Shipley to Mr. Parker.—(Received July 9 .) (Private.) Dear Parker, Constantinople, Julij 3, 1912. IN my last letter to you of the 19th ultimo I referred to the line which, according to the information given me by Itila-el-Mulk, had been informally proposed by the Ottoman delegates to their Persian colleagues, adding that the line in question after Howeizeh adopted the Kebir Kuh generally as the eastern frontier of Turkey. From some further indications which have since been supplied to me by Itila, though unfortunately these also are in parts very vague, the line in question goes from Tchardowar, which may roughly be called the northern extremity of the Kebir Kuh {vide MaunselPs reduction, sheet 9), to Mount Kaladja (near Mount Katchal, ibid., sheet 8 ), and from thence by Mount Nua to Sermil. From this latter place the line goes by the Kele-Siah (Guile Siar ?) and Kiani Kelb Ali mountains (vide map of Zohab, attached to your memorandum of the 8 th December, 1906) to Derteng, then by a mountain which Itila calls Kredaghi (Garee Mount, ibidem ?) and the Bemou range to the River Shirvan, which it follows up stream. Between this latter stream and Mount Takhti Abdalan (Red. Id. map, sheet 5, latitude 40° 50', longitude 46° 15') no indication whatever is given as to the direction of the line, but from the Takhti Abdalan it goes northwards through Pusht-i-Bademjan (which is apparently outside the neutral zone) until it reaches the Kele-Khan Pass, through which we travelled on our way from Sakkiz to Bane last year. From thence, according to Itila, it goes by the Keupri Dagh, the Ester Dagh (for this latter mountain, vide Maunsell’s reduction, sheet 6 ) to the Meidan Pass in the neighbourhood of Pasve. From Pasve northwards the Turkish delegates, I am informed by Itila, stated that the line as far as the Kotur district, would be that presented to the mediating delegates by Dervish Pasha in the commission of 1875. The only remark I think that I need make with regard to this latter part of the line is that, at any rate from Djildian northwards, it appears to adhere very closely to the eastern line of the neutral zone all the way up until it ends at the so-called boundary mark near Raihane on the road from Khoi to Kotur. The Persian delegates, Itila tells me, declined to accept this line, i.e., from Mohammerah to Kotur, as proposed by the Turks, and as it was only put forward by the latter informally, and as I have not had an opportunity of ascertaining what the Russians think of it, I would only at present repeat what I said in my last letter, viz., that it shows at least some willingness on their part to bargain, especially as it will be noticed that by it they—the Turks—virtually declare their readiness to withdraw from the lake and the districts immediately thereto adjoining. The one object of immediate interest to ourselves during the past fortnight has been the proposal by the Persians to declare their acceptance of the explanatory notes under certain conditions. We informed you of this fully in our telegram No. 197 of the 23rd ultimo, and I am glad to say that we have succeeded in making them see clearly that such acceptance, while it would be very damaging to their own position, would in no way provide a solution of the difficulty, the question to which a reply was demanded by the Turks being whether these notes were accepted or not—a simple yes or no, in fact. The amended draft of the reply which has been submitted to its by the Persians makes no mention at all of any acceptance of the notes, conditional or otherwise, and merely reiterates the assertion that the Persian Government has never accepted them nor authorised its plenipotentiary to sign anything but the text of the treaty, offering at the same time to produce authentic documents in support of these assertions if required. There is, I think, no objection to a reply of this kind, as the Persians tell me that they must make a rejoinder of some sort or other to the Turkish argument in Proces-verbal No. 5. A difficulty in connection with this question of the notes has been that the Russians are extremely anxious to get them out of the way so as to deal with article 3 and the northern part of the frontier. Minorsky especially has been pressing me on the matter for some time past, and it is for this reason that the latest telegrams from the Foreign Office—1st July, &amp;c.,—have been a considerable f 2.)4o i] W N 2 1SJUL1912 j) 22 relief to us, as we can now, at any rate, fully inform the Russian Embassy of the reasons we do not wish the Persians to accept, even conditionally, these notes. In our despatch No. 520 the word used in connection with Dervish Pasha’s book should have been “printed” and not “published.” In the preface to the book L question it is stated that the book was founded on a report which he—Dervish Pasha— had presented to the Porte in 1269 (1861), he., seven years before the hook itself made its appearance. It is the translation from the book (not from the report of 1861 therein referred to, which is of course inaccessible) which forms the enclosure in our despatch above referred to. The report which Dervish Pasha presented to the mediating delegates in 1875 is a different document, though parts of his book may have been utilised by him in its compilation. The book of Khursbid Effendi is again another production, and, as you will see by the despatch which we are forwarding by to-day’s bag, I have been and am endeavouring to get hold of a Copy. In the meantime I forward to you herewith a translation of tile index of Dervish Pasha’s book of the contents from pp. 21 td 50.

I will go on with the translation, but you might perhaps, after looking through the various headings, be able to give me some indication whether a translation of the whole, i.e., from p. 21 to p. 50, will be required.

Beyond the reference contained in the late Sir A. Kemballs despatch to Sir A.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 510 of the 18th instant, I have the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty’s vice-consul at Van respecting the recent affray between Turkish troops and Abdoui tribesmen at Kotur. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. Vice-Consul Molyneux-Seel to Sir G. Lowther. (No. 12.) Sir, Van, June 10, 1912. I HAVE the honour to inform your Excellency that, according to the report furnished by the frontier commissary, the details of the recent fight with Simko are as follows : — On Monday night, 19th-20th May, the Abdoui tribesmen attacked Kochalan Hill, advancing by two tracks directly, and sending a third party by a circuitous route to attack the hill from the west. The Ottoman troops engaged were forty men from Razi and Chilik, of the 16th Frontier Guard company, and forty-five men of the 1st 99th Regiment, who reinforced from Heratil. The strength of the Abdouis was 130 on foot and 120 mounted. The fight on Kochalan Hill lasted seventeen hours, at the end of which time the Abdouis took flight. The Ottoman troops lost 2 killed, 6 wounded, and 5 captured, of whom 1 died at Kotur. Kochalan Hill is not marked on our map, but on the sketch which accompanied the report it was shown well on the Turkish side of the frontier. On the 28th May the troops who had taken part in the seventeen hours’ fight being exhausted (this reason does not seem a very sound one after the lapse of a week), and owing to news that the Abdoui leaders had held a meeting at Maku, and were expecting a new supply of ammunition, a renewed attack being expected, orders were given for the dispatch of the following reinforcements : from Archag, 40 men to Kashgeul and 30 to Kanisbi (south of Kashgeul) ; from Serai, 140 men to the plateau of Heratil; total reinforcements, 210 men. e The local Government here was informed that protests had been made on the ground, first, that Kotur had been occupied by Turkish troops, and subsequently with the modified ground of complaint that troops with artillery were on the march to Kotur. . The result of enquiries here made from all available sources does not furnish the slightest grounds for either accusation. Russian agents persist in stating that there are two mountain-guns at Mawana and four machine-guns at Chari. I am quite convinced that neither exist, though absolute proof is of course not obtainable. I have, Ac. J. MOLYNEUX-SEEL, Captain. [2545 a —19] 1SJUL1912* 4L qfithe treaty at random, and it is to attain this end that the explanatory note serves. It is, in fact, in precise conformity with the treaty itself, as I endeavoured to prove at the interview I lately had with your Excellency. Thus, when the representatives in Constantinople declare that Turkey, in yielding, to Persia the city, port, and anchorage of Mohammerah, with the island of Khizr, does not thereby yield any other cities or ports belonging to Turkey, they only say what is self-evident and what your Excellency is no doubt ready to affirm, more particularly when you call to recollection the first part of the 3rd article of the treaty, which limits all territorial restitution to Mohammerah and Zohab. Moreover, the demarcating line proposed by the two mediating commissioners—a league to the west of Mohammerah— will prove to your Excellency the fair spirit with which the interpretation is given. The second point of explanation is to the effect that, if a tribe or a part of a tribe residing in Turkey should be adjudged to Persia, the transfer of the tribe or of part of the tribe to Persia is not to include the transfer of the territory also. This, too, is quite obvious ; it is entirely a question of tribes and human beings, as your Excellency remarked—not of territory—and the above explanation is made most distinct by the latter part of the 8th article. The third point of explanation is almost indifferent, and merely repeats what the treaty declares : that, according to the 1st and 4th articles, all previous pecuniary claims between the Governments are mutually abandoned, and that the claims for pasturage and also the damages which have been experienced on both sides (as is stipulated in the 4th article of the treaty) since the acceptation by Persia and Turkey of the propositions offered by the two mediating Governments, that is to say, since the month of Jemadee ool evvel 1261, should be regulated and adjudged by commissioners. I trust the observations I have made above will convince your Excellency that, in confirming the explanatory note of the representatives in Constantinople, the Persian Government in no degree departs from the spirit, meaning, or words of the treaty, and that an intimation to that effect will be given to Meerza Jaffier Khan.

Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 24.) Constantinople, June 18, 1912. 'MlH reference to my telegram No. 185 of the 8th June, I have the honour to forward herewith a despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Van, respecting an encounter at the Kotur frontier between t^imko’s men and Ottoman troops. I HAVE the honour to inform your Excellency that about twelve days ago an encounter took place between Simko’s men and Ottoman troops on the Kotur frontier, in which the latter lost two killed, eight wounded, and four taken prisoners. Simko’s men are said to have lost six killed. According to the Turkish account, the conflict was brought about by Simko’s men crossing the border and endeavouring, as usual, to steal sheep belonging to the neighbouring Shemsiki tribe. The tribesmen informed the Ottoman troops, who, hastily collecting their forces from their various posts, attacked Simko and drove him back into his territory. According to a report furnished by a Russian agent to my colleague, the circum stances of the conflict and its cause were as follows : Last year Simko had carried off a number of sheep belonging to Sadoun Bey, chief of the Shemsiki tribe in the kaza of Khoshab. Sadoun Bey, with the intention of recovering his sheep, organised a force amongst his tribesmen and one night entered Kotur. Simko attacked him and a fight ensued, Sadoun Bey being driven back. On the news of the fighting, Ottoman troops were sent to aid Sadoun Be}’. This report closes with the sentence, “ They say that Russia no longer supports Simko.’' The significance of this appeared to be that the writer, who, it must be remembered, was in Russian employ, considered that Russia’s having supported Simko was an undisputed fact. The Turks have three military posts, which, I gather, are situated exactly on the Kotur frontier. One is on the east side at Chari, and the two others on the south side at Chilik and Kashgeul respectively. It seems that the scene of the encounter with the troops was on the actual frontier, so that in repelling Simko’s attack the troops may necessarily have transgressed the Kotur border. But I can see no ground for supposing that the Turks had or have any intention of occupying Kotur or .of making an unprovoked attack on Simko in his own territory. The strongest argument in support of this contention is that the Turks have not a sufficient force at hand to carry out such a project Simko has at his command between 300 and 400 well-armed Abdoui tribesmen renowned for their bravery, whereas the Turkish troops available are inferior in numbers and distributed between the three posts mentioned above. At the same time, there is no doubt that the Turks feel very acutely the humiliating position in which they are placed, and might, perhaps, be driven at some time to commit some act which would involve them in political difficulties. I have informed your Excellency from time to time of the acts of brigandage committed by Simko. In one of the villages in Salmas, recently passed through by Jabir Pasha during his inspection tour, it was recounted how Simko’s men had raided the village and violated every single girl among the inhabitants. Other villages in this plain and also in the plain of Khoi have suffered similarly, the latter not, however, since the Russian occupation. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure in No. 1. (No. 11.) Sir, Vice-Consul Molyneux-Seel to Sir G. Lowther. Van, June 3, 1912. [2500 aa—10] L 1SJUL1Q12 V /It is estimated that during the past year Simko has stolen sheep to the value of 25,000k In the face of all this, the Turks are compelled to look on more or less helplessly. It is obvious that to absolutely prevent the possibility of Simko’s crossing the frontie/^ a large Turkish force would- be required. At present Simko either manages to slip through between the posts or to force his way past one of the posts before reinforce ments from other posts can arrive. He can subsequently retire back into Kotur, where he cannot be touched. It is needless to mention that Turkish diplomatic representations are of no avail. It can be imagined how such a state of affairs must exasperate the Turks, the more so as they know that, were it permitted, by collecting a few troops from neighbouring places, it would be a matter of a few hours only to crush Simko in his lair. Kotur forms a harbour of refuge, also, for other Turkish brigands. The famous brigand, Mir Mehe of Shattakh,. was with Simko during the last encounter with the troops. Simko has been offered the post of commandant of the Persian cavalry at Urmi but he has declined to quit his tribesmen. The Turks find it difficult to understand the attitude adopted by the Russians in this affair. Even the Russians do not question that Simko is a brigand who has caused untold misery to the wretched inhabitants of the villages within his reach. It is understood that Russia has taken over the practical control of this part of the country, and that the object of her presence is the suppression of lawlessness among the Persian subjects. If, then, Simko be regarded by the Russians as a Persian official (Governor of Kotur), it should be a simple matter to obtain his removal. But if he be regarded as a brigand, surely, if only in the name of humanity, he might be suppressed in common with other brigands in other parts of Persia. The Turkish efforts to persuade Simko to enter into Turkish territory have been defeated by the influence of Russia, who, for some reason or other, does not wish him to quit Kotur. Considering all the circumstances, it is not surprising that the Turks hold firmly to the idea that Russian agents keep Simko supplied with arms, through the medium of the Russian protege, the Khan of Maku. My Russian colleague informs me that he received a telegram to the effect that the Constantinople newspapers reported the occupation of Kotur by Turkish troops, including artillery. Such a report would appear to have come by way of Russia from Khoi, and it seems probable that Simko sent his four Turkish prisoners to Khoi by way of proof of the presence of Turkish troops in his territory. At the time of the conflict 150 Turkish infantry were sent from Serai and Archag to reinforce the Turkish posts. It seems that, at the time of the fight, the Turkish post of Kashgeul had been vacated, as the troops stationed there belonged to the Bashkala battalion, which has been withdrawn and is now on its way to Bitlis. -Fht' battalions from Chan and Mawana (one from each place) are also now on their way to Bitlis.

The territorial stipulations of the treaty as given in Each id : Append ice de Tchefebszade, “ Historiographe de rEmpire/’f are as follows :— “ Les parties du royaume de Perse, qui, depuis le commencement de la guerre d’Orient, ont ete conquises par la Porte, avec 1 assistance divine, et qui sont devenues parties integrantes de son empire, telles que Kermanchahan, Hamadan, la province de Sine, Ardelan, Nehavond, Khoarremabad, le Loristan, Mekris, Meragha, Qui (Khoi), Serkan, et principalement Tebrez (Tabreez), Capitale de 1’Azerbijan ; cette province en entier ; Guendje, Kasabagh (Karabagh), Erivan, Ordoubad, Nakhdjivan, Tiflis ; tout le Gurdistan (Georgistan), le district de Chamakhi; le Chirwan (Sherivan) et, en outre d’une foule d’autres points qui ne sont pas digues d’etre enumeres, le district Honweize (Howeizeh), resteront entre les mains du Sultan. “ La Perse en outre abandonne Sultanie, Ebher, Zindjan (Sendjan), et Tarim avec leurs dependances.” 1732 (1144).— Between Mahmoud I and Shah Tahmasp II. [Marked in Sir S. Canning’s summary^ (p. 11) “ communicated from home ” with further note “ this treaty did not remain long in force.”] This is the treaty which gives back to the Shah Tabreez, Ardelan, Kermanshahan, Hamadan, and Honweize (Howeizeh ?) in Luristan, and lays down that the River Araxes, on the side of Azerbaijan, Derneh and Dertenk (Dartang), on the side of Irak, shall, with the ancient limits, form the boundaries of the two States. The following extract is taken from the version of the treaty given by Soubhi: “Historiographe de I’Empire”! “ Le fleuve Aras (Araxes) du cote de 1’Azerbijan, Derne et Dertenk du cote de 1’Irak ainsi que les anciennes limites, formeront la frontiere des deux Etats. * The Treaty of 1727 was made during 1 the Afghan usurpation of the Persian throne (1727-1730) and the Persians are not likely to recognise it.—E. P. f Copies of Tchelebszade’s version of the Treaty of 1727 (or January 28, 1728, according to Tchelebszade) and of Soubhi’s version of the Treaty of 1732 were taken from the books in the Royal Library at Paris for the use of the Foreign Office in 1842.—E.

Tabreez, Ardelan, Kermanchahan, Hamadan, Lonweize (Honweiz^, Howeizeh) en le Loristan, qui sont entre les mains du Scbah de^? Perse, resteront en sa possession.” Foot-note .—According to von Hammer, vol. xiv, pp. 259, 260, 261, the Sultan would seem to have shown great hesitation in ratifying this treaty, and it is not clear how Persia succeeded in obtaining such favourable terms, for if the account given by the former historian is to be believed, the advantage in the campaign immediately preceding the conclusion of the treaty was all on the side of Turkey. 1736 (1149). —Between Mahmoud 1 and Nadir Shah. In Sir S. Canning’s summary this treaty is only referred to as follows :— “ The limitation is confirmed according to the Treaty of Murad.” According to von Hammer, vol. xiv, p. 347, the stipulations would seem to be chiefly— 1. Acknowledgment of Nadir as Shah of Persia. 2. Stipulation as to Persian pilgrims. 3. Maintenance of residents at respective courts. 4. Itelease of prisoners. 5. Frontiers. Here von Hammer only says (comme) “ les frontieres des deux Empires restaient les memes que cedes qui avaient ete fixees par le trade conclu avec le Sultan Murad IV,” not giving the exact words of the treaty ad hoc. 1746 (1159). There are three versions of this treaty* given in S. Canning’s summary (p. 11); the first, marked “ communicated from Persia,” contains only the reference “ The stipulations regarding the boundaries of Murad IV are confirmed ” ; the second, marked “ communicated from home,” is as follows : “ The limitation of Murad IV is confirmed, merchants to pay the usual duties, refugees to be reciprocally given up ” ; the third, marked “ communicated from the Porte,” states : &lt;c Murad IV frontiers are confirmed, merchants to trade on the ancient footing of security.” Von Hammer’s reference (vol. xv, p. 118) to the treaty under consideration is as follows :— It (the treaty) adopted as basis the delimitation laid down by the treaty concluded with the Sultan Murad IV, and only contained three new articles :— 1. Pespecting pilgrims. 2. Mutual charges d’affaires. 3. Peturn of respective prisoners. Foot-note. —Von Hammer, in a foot-note, has a reference to the copies of this treaty as follows :— “ Voir aussi (dans 1’ouvrage dTzi), p. 83, les deux traites de paix ; le traitd persan, p. 85.” This foot-note of von Hammer would apparently account for the three versions given in Sir S. Canning’s summary. * A full translation by Mr. Taylour Thomson of the treaty of 1746, concluded between Nadir Shah and Sultan Mahmoud Khan, was sent to the Foreign Office in Sir S. Canning’s despatch No. 70, April 27, 1844, and a copy extracted from “ Izi’s Chronicle ” was received from him in January 1843. These two versions have been printed in Confidential 10007.—E. P.3 1S23 (1238).— Between Mahmoud II and Feth All Shah. [Note. —The date of this treaty would seem to be 1823 and not 1822* as given in Sir S. Canning’s summary.] There are two versions of this treaty given in Sir H. Rawlinson’s memorandum — The first marked “ communicated from Persia.'” The second marked &lt;c communicated from the Porte.” The one important difference between them is that it is the Persian version only which states that “ Persia is not to interfere with the territory of Kurdistanf or with the revenues of the districts (sanjak : this is not a Persian word) of Kurdistan, and it is not to use any influence over the former or present possessors of districts, and with regard to the “elyats” (wandering tribes) of the above-mentioned places belonging to both Governments]: which pass into the territory of both Governments to fix their winter and summer abodes, &amp;c.” The version marked “ communicated from the Porte ” makes no mention of the word “ Kurdistan,” the reference being : “ Persia shall on no pretext or in any way whatever interfere with Turkish affairs on this side of Bagdad or within the Turkish frontier.” Of the two above-mentioned versions, the Persian would seem to be the correct one* being borne out by the version given in Noradungian’s “ Pecueil d’Actes internationaux de 1’Empire ottoman ” (vol. ii, p. 95), which is as follows :— Article l er .—“ Le Gouvernement persan ne doit plus se permettre des a present de s’immiscer en aucune maniere dans les districts de Bagdad et du Kurdistan enfermes dans les frontieres de I’Empire ottoman.” Then further :—“ Si les peuplades qui habitent ces pays limitrophes franchissaient d’un cote ou de 1’autre la frontiere pour un sejour d’ete ou hiver, les agents de Son Altesse Buy ale 1’Heritier presomptit du Trone doivent s’accorder avec le Gouverneur general de Bagdad sur le paiement du tribut d’usagm, &amp;c.” The Persian version of the treaty of 1823 (1822), it may be remarked, states that the stipulations regarding the boundaries are confirmed according to the treaty of 1746 (i.e., according to 'the Treaty of Murad IV). The Turkish version is : “ The frontiers and other stipulations of Murad IV are confirmed.” With regard to the meaning to be attached to the word “ Kurdistan,” in the treaty of 1823 (1822), the expression as it stands is certainly ambiguous, but apart from the o-eneral tenour of the treaty, the quotation which I have given above from Nora dungian’s “ Becueil,” which speaks of the districts of Bagdad and Kurdistan, “ enfermes dans les frontieres de 1 Empire ottoman,” is, it seems to me, conclusive that Turkish and not Persian Kurdistan was intended to be understood by the framers of the treaty in question even if provision had not been made for the passing§ of tribes from either side of the frontier to the other. Summary. The result of the foregoing review of the treaties under discussion will have been to show that we are, as far as the territorial delimitation between the two States is concerned, thrown back in the ultimate resort on the treaty of Murad IV of 1639,|| as all of these treaties subsequent to that of 1727, with the exception of the treaty of 1732, the importance of which, however, as explicitly giving back to Persia, Tabreez Ardelan, * Colonel Shell’s translation of the treaty, forwarded to the Foreign Office in Sir S. Canning’s despatch No. 70 of April 27. 1844. gives the 19th day of Zilkaadi, 1237 (about August 5, 1822), as the date when it was sealed (sio-ned), and in the negotiations preceding the treaty of 184&lt; it was constantly referred to as the treaty of 1822 In Hertslet’s “ Persian Treaties” (1891 edition), the date of the treaty is given as the 19th dav of Zilkaadi, 1238, i.*., July 28, 1823. In the treaty of Erzeroum of 1847 the year of the Hegira (a.h. 1238) only is quoted, and this corresponds to a.d. 1822 (commencing septembei 28) 18 l 3 (ending Se Pt+ m yfi e ^ t h e E word Kurdistan there is in brackets—apparently as a note— u exclusive of its more extensive application.” This word is used in Persia to denote the province of Ardelan, of which Senore (teenna) is the capital; in Turkey this word perhaps implies Suleimanieh. , , ,,, . x , + The Turkish version is: “ If the inhabitants of that neighbourhood should come into the winter or summer quarters of either party, &amp;c. S Confirmed by article 9 of the treaty of 1847. . , r , j| For the delimitation by the treaty of Murad IT, vide Mr. Shipley s memorandum of March 16, 1912.4 Ifoweizeh &amp;c., must not be overlooked, confirm the territorial stipulations of the treaty of Murad in question. In making the above statement, however, it is necessary to observe that the subsequent treaty of Erzeroum of 1847 and the question whether, or how far, its provisions may have changed or annulled the territorial stipulations of previous treaties have not been dealt with as not coming within the scope of the present memorandum.

In deference to the views of the Russian Government, I ^am prepared to concert with them in advising the Persian Government to accept the explanatory note, though I apprehend that The Hague Tribunal would interpret that document as modifying the Treaty of Erzeroum, especially near Mohammerah, to the detriment of Persia. I cousider, however, that it would be well to induce the Persian Government to couple in the first instance their acceptance of explanatory note with a provision that they do so subject to the recognition by Turkey of the locally observed boundary in the Mohammerah and Hawizeh region. After the British and Russian representatives at Constantinople have concerted with the Persian delegate in preparing a draft communication to the Turkish Government on the subject, I should wish to have an opportunity of considering it before it is actually handed to the Turkish delegates. As the Russian Government are aware, His Majesty’s Government attach the greatest importance to the maintenance of the frontier as locally observed, and they are making a communication to the Turkish Government this week on the subject; the frontier in question is more advantageous to Persia than the line proposed by the mediating commissioners in 1850.

His Excellency fears that Turks will insist on explanatory note being accepted before they enter on negotiations respecting the frontier in the north, and that if there is undue delay there will not be sufficient time for delegates to deal with points which directly interest Russia. He finally suggested that the two Ambassadors should concert together and endeavour to arrive at an understanding as to the best mode of proceeding, as he considers that they are better judges of the situation than their respective Governments. I fear that, if, as is probable, Turks do not return early answer, Russian Government will adhere to their present standpoint. I ■ 19 JUL1912 SEC PEN ARY’ 29 IV 1611)11312 .V ll DEGSir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 14, 10'30 p.m.) (No. 247.) R. lyd') St. Petersburgh, Jidg 14, 1912, 8-20 p.m. MR. O’BEIRN K’S telegram No.V231 setter received from Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that he has received a telegram from Russian Ambassador at Constantinople, saying that his Excellency attaches great importance to the immediate acceptance of the explanatory note by Persian delegates. Russian Ambassador draws attention to the danger of Turks taking advantage of the hesitation on the part of delegation to annul the Treaty of Erzeroum, which alone offers a solid basis for well-founded claims of Persia with regard to whole of the rest of the frontier, and the abrogation of which would render further pourparlers exceedingly difficult. Russian Ambassador thinks, moreover, that Persia’s adherence to the explanatory note would not prevent His Majesty’s Government from obtaining the object which they have in view since they have decided to exercise pressure on the Sublime Porte on the question of the line of demarcation near Mohammerah. If that pressure attains the desired result, Turkey will make concessions to satisfy demand of His Majesty’s Government, if not, Persia’s refusal to accept explanatory [? note] will be of small value. k/JTrA ■ Rruecian Ambacoader thinks that above views of Russian Ambassador are well founded, seeing that, as question has become object of direct negotiation between Great Britain and Turkey, Persia’s attitude in regard to the question has no longer any importance. Moreover, it is highly important that ulterior frontier negotiations between Persian and Turkish delegates should not remain in suspense, in view of short time remaining for those negotiations as laid down by protocol of Tehran. Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs begs that, in bringing above to your knowledge, I will draw your attention to necessity of instructing the two Ambassadors at Constan tinople to concert together without delay, with a view to advising Persian delegates to accept explanatory note and to continue negotiations on basis of Treaty of Erzeroum. I will see his' Excellency to-morrow and discuss matter with him. 1 19 JUL 1912 2 S *ir J/ V # r r 'MV) , In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote No - and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

Section 3. [26631] No. 1. (No. 517.) Sir, Sir G. Loicther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 24.) Constantinople, June 17, J912. ASSIM BEY has on several occasions recently endeavoured to discuss with me the question of the Turco-Persian frontier in connection with the northern portion, or Urmia district, but I have confined myself usually to the expression of a hope that, with a further examination and a display of good-will on either side, a solution agreeable to all parties interested would be found. After discussing to-day the Mohammerah frontier, as reported in my despatch No. 516, Assim Bey again referred to the northern frontier, and asked me how he could satisfy the Russians consistently with an arrangement which he could put before Parliament without being exposed to scathing criticism, and with some hope of the arrangement being endorsed by the Chamber. she secured a good geographical boundary. His Excellency was not precise as to the documents on which he relied, and whether or not they were treaties, but he again the lake, but, as he had stated to me in the conversation reported to you in my despatch No 457 of the 27th May last, he realised that, even if this claim were thus found he would be able to justify it before the Chamber. Assim Bey did not go into any details as regards the frontier beyond what I have mentioned, but as his suggestions seem to imply a considerable concession beyond the His Excellency said he asked for the advice of His Majesty’s Government in an unofficial and private manner. What did the Russians want? As his Excellency began speaking about the rights of Turkey to an approach to the Lake of Urmia on its western shore, and to a slice of territory to the south of the lake, I repeated substantially the reply I had given on a former occasion, namely, that speaking personally, I did not think that Russia could admit either claim on the part of Turkey. To this his Excellency replied that although Turkey could, with the documents now in her possession, justify her claim to both, she might eventually abandon such claim if expressed his conviction that these documents would establish the Turkish claim before the commission, and, if necessary, before the Hague Tribunal, not only to the approach to Lake Urmia on the west and on the south, but also even to territory on the east of accepted bv the tribunal, Russia would not agree to it. He therefore asked whether it would not be possible to come to terms by establishing a geographical frontier which was formed by the mountains to the west of Lake Urmia. Turkey, by agreeing to this, would be abandoning a valuable asset in her access to the lake, which was necessary for the flocks on account of the salt they required, but if a strategical frontier were attitude assumed till now, and indicate a desire to come to terms, I have ventured to report the conversation to you, Sir, and would ask you to instruct me as to the language I should hold should he again refer to the subject, which I am convinced he will do.

W11H reference to my telegram No. 191 of the 16th instant, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a translation which, in pursuance of the instructions con tained in your despatch No. 168 of the 29th April last, I have caused to be made of the portion (Chapters I to XVIII) of the book written by the late Dervish Pasha relating to Mohammerah and Howeizeh, and published in Constantinople in the year 1868. I would draw attention to Chapters IX to XIV, dealing with the delimitation of the frontier immediately above Mohammerah, and particularly to Chapters XIII and XIV, in which, as you will observe, Dervish Pasha, while expressing his doubts as to the right of the Turkish Government to put forward a claim to Howeizeh, nevertheless concludes by saying that such a claim “ might be useful as a pretext for proposing that the Kerkha should be adopted as a boundary above Sheria.” The translation was made by Mr. Bullard, and I venture to think has been done with great care. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER, Enclosure in No. 1. Translation of the portion (Chapters I to XVIII) of the Booh written by the late Dervish Pasha, sometime Turkish Delegate on the Turco-Persian Frontier Delimitation Commission of 1849-52, relating to Mohammerah and printed in Constantinople in the year 1286 a.h. (1868). Chapter I. MOHAMMERAH lies at a distance of eight hours to the south of Bussorah, on the right bank of the Karun River, which comes from Khuzistan, in Persian territory, and flows into the Shatt-el-Arab, and a quarter-of-an-hour s distance from the point where the said Karun River joins the Shatt-el-Arab. It is a village consisting of some 150 Arab houses, and surrounded by an earth wall in the form of a square, each side of which is about 600 paces long. Investigation has shown that the line of the old frontier of the Ottoman Empire lies to the east of Mohammerah and the under mentioned El Khizr, the “ lengergiah ” [the anchorage], &amp;c. It begins from a point on the shore of the Persian Gulf, such that the old frontier of the Ottoman Empire includes not only Mohammerah, but also the sanjaks of North Goban, South Goban, Haffar and Mouavieh, and other places which have passed into the possession of the Persians, and many of which are abandoned and in ruins ; it passes on the other side of these places, and extends to a ruin called Kut-el-Abd, which is situated at a distance of five or six hours to the east of Mohammerah, and on the right bank of the Karun River. From there it passes between the two Kasrs [this must mean Keushk-i- Howeiza and Keushk-i-Bussorah. See Chapter IX] and divides the old sanjaks of Soueib and Neshveh, dependencies of Bussorah, from the lands of the country of Howeiza. Then it goes to a place called Sheria, situated on the left of the Soueib River, which flows into the Shatt-el-Arab, at a point half-an-hour’s distance below Kurna. The south-western side of this line will then be in Turkey and the north eastern in Persia. As evidence with regard to North and South Goban, Haffar, Mouavieh, Abu Jezi [? Abu Jidiyeh], and other places which lie inland from Mohammerah, the official documents enumerated below this chapter and a considerable number of reliable entries in the registers kept in the office at Bussorah were con sulted, and enquiries and explanations with regard to the last treaty concluded at [2506 an —2] BT- ser i u 4 - QnKh'mp Porte and the Ambassadors of the mediating Erzeroum passed between ^ Sublime F t Ottoman Government, stating that f}.p a hove lines * but in spite of this the Persian delegate clung to the literal mea ^ of the treatT Ind claimed that to Persia should be left not only the three places mentioned aLe, but also the places previously mentmued and lying inW from thein viz., North and South Goban, Mouavieh, Haffar, and other places also in addition to the territory as far as a locality called Abu Jezi Khaiky [ • •&gt; . Cana lknch is subject to Mohammerah, and is at present in the possession of the Perdans—all the places which are situated on the left bank of the Shatt-e -Arab as far as the Soueib Kiver, which have been subject to Bussorah ah Ihe med'ating delegates both took a middle course, and gave it as their confidential opinion that the part below Abu Jezi Kharky, i.e .,the eastern and southern portions of the said|Khark, should he left to Persia and the northern part to Turkey ; but as this view was no accepted by the delegates of the two contracting Powers, the character of these places was left an open question.

Document of the Sheri Court, dated 1227 a.h. (1813), and sealed ^h the seal of the Kadi of Bussorah, concerning the administration of the benefactions of Shei h Yakoub in Haffar. [Note —The sanjak of Soueib referred to above has been explained to be a locality near the Soueib Biver, which the Persian delegate, in his report No ‘2 of the sitting which took place at Mohammerah on 14 Rebi-ul-Evvel, 1266 a.h. (16th January, 18o0), described as the Kerkha River, a tributary of the Shatt-el-Arab . tt In addition to the documents here referred to, the fact that Maharzi and Hattai are also dependencies of Bussorah is shown by the text of an Imperial patent issued by Sultan Mahmoud I in 1160 A.H. (1748), and granting to certain members of the Nakshbend Order for their maintenance the revenues of Maharzi and liattar, as well as those of Siraii, Ashar, Muhikirann, and Beleded-HamaMan (he., the town of Hamadan), and a large number of other places subordinate^ to the treasury of Bussorah. Ibis Maharzi is situated on the island of El Khizr, while Haffar consists of the lands on both banks of the River Karun, to the east of Mohammerah ; both are at present m the possession of the Persians. A number of firmans, Imperial berats, and other oihciai documents in our keeping serve to prove that similar places m the neighbourhood which are in the hands of the Persians belong to the Ottoman Empire, and are dependent on Bussorah.] Chapter III. In addition to the above-mentioned documents there exists a considerable number of ancient firmans and papers as definitive proofs that among the dependencies o e vilayet of Bussorah are the places lying within the above-mentioned frontier, viz., IN orand South Goban, the River Mouavieh [? Mouavieh Canal], Haffar, and El Khizr, with the mukataa lands on them, and Mohammerah itself with its dependencies. Moreover, in the Bassorah Land Registry have been found very many entries which prove that the Chaab tribes, which formerly inhabited the now ruined portions of the said localities j^and still dwell in the cultivated parts, are Ottoman subjects dependent on Bussorah. Not only have those documents which are of value been copied in extenso, but copies have also been made of such of the entries as support the case. Also the ruins of the kassaba of Benineh [?], which was originally the seat of the government of the sanjak of Goban, and is situated on the left of the Karim River and six hours south-east of Mohammerah, have been inspected. Chapter IV. The Chaab tribe, some of whom live to-day in Mohammerah and El Khizr, and to the east of these places, and on the banks of the Shatt-el-Arab, are a people who came originally from Nejd. On their arrival the Valis of Bagdad and Bussorah gave them a locality called Sabla to live in, and there they settled. Sabla is on the Karun at a distance of about three hours east of Mohammerah. They gradually increased in number, and brought under cultivation the places called North Goban and South Goban, mention of which was made in the first chapter. From time to time disputes broke out between them and the Persian tribes in the neighbourhood, and acts of mutual aggression took place, and on two or three occasions the Persians, with the object of causing the total destitution of those tribes, broke the Sabla dam, which served for the cultivation of the fields, thereby turning the Karun completely into its present channel. The Chaab tribes were unable to resist and to rebuild the dam, and their fields, in fulfilment of the Persians’ dearest wish, fell into disuse. A century and two or three years ago the great sheikhs of the Chaab tribes inhabiting Goban, with some of the tribes subject to them, went to a locality in Persian territory called Fellahieh and gradually brought it under cultivation and settled there. The other branches of this tribe—part of which consists of the Mouhaisin, who inhabit Mohammerah and the neighbourhood and the places near Bussorah, and the Idris [Dris ?], and the Nassar, who live in El Khizr and El Mahalleh—came to the places referred to above as dependent on Bussorah and settled there. Those of them who settled on this side, being dependent on Bussorah, still pay to Bussorah through the said great sheikhs the land tax which they have long paid to the Bussorah Treasury under the name of “ kalamieh.” They have also made an annual allowance to the said sheikhs according to the custom among the tribes ; and the sheikh who lived with his tribe in Fellahieh began to pay something to the Persians as a present, because they were living in part of Persian territory, and the Persians would not let them alone; and that is why they have been known as Persian subjects. Nevertheless the tribes on this side have never acknowledged the Persians ; but, owing to the services they have rendered, as above explained, to the sheikh in Fellahieh, and to the fact that, when harrassed recently by the valis and mutessarifs of Bussorah, they took refuge with their sheikhs and were protected by them, the “kalamieh” they paid annually to the Bussorah Treasury gradually diminished, while the allowances they made to their sheikhs in Fellahieh increased, and, in consequence of these rapprochements and this unavoidable dependence on Persia, trouble arose as to their nationality. Nevertheless, until the end of the term of office of the last Vali of Bagdad but one—the late Daoud Pasha—all the land tax of the Chaab tribes in Mohammerah and the neighbourhood and in El Khizr was paid to the Bussorah Treasury, and the customary robes of honour were presented by the Vali of Bagdad and the sub-governors of Bussorah. When they became obstinate, after Daoud Pasha’s time, the late Ali Pasha went against them as in the case of their predecessors, and after having been punished and corrected they paid their land tax for a year or two. In any case it has been ascertained that the claim has been raised recently by the Persians, since which time Persia has laid claim to be ruler over them all, and has seized that territory, whereas it is clear that the Persians have no right to any part of the lands in Mohammerah and the neighbourhood or within the above- mentioned old frontier as far as the River Soueib. Chapter V. The village of Mohammerah, as it stands at present, has already been described. It is not an old village ; investigation shows that it was rebuilt thirty-three or thirty- four years ago, when the late Daoud Pasha was Vali of Bagdad and a man named4 Bekir Agha was sub-governor of Bussorab, fe., in 1235 or 1236 a.h. (about 1822 or 1823), and was brought under cultivation m 1238, 1239, or 1240 a h. The ougma^ Mohammerah, which is now called Old Mohammerah, is a village a ou en nnnu es distance lower down on the right bank of the channel, where the Karun flows m o the Shatt-el-Arab. This place is still partly cultivated From the place _ called Kassaba-el-Munai’ab, which is situated on the right bank of the Karun, m the neighbourhood of the places which are opposite Sabla and dependent on Mohammerah, it is a distance of about three hours to Mohammerah itself and from there to e iunction of the Karun and the Shatt-el-Arab, and from the said junction to Abu Jezi Kharky, and on until you reach Fellahieh Fort is a distance of an hour and a-hali. There are date palms and fields, sometimes close together, sometimes farther apart, and sometimes with vacant spaces between. The breadth of these date-palm plantations mav be a quarter or half-an-hour, or three-quarters of an hour at the outside. this exception, the above-mentioned North and South Goban and Mouavieh, and Umm-el-Hamr and Umm-el-Azam, and all the districts round Goban are completely waste and deserted. Chapter VI. El Khizr is an island opposite Mohammerah. It is bounded on the north by the Karun River, on the west by the Shatt-el-Arab, on the south by the Persian Gulf, and on the east by the River Bamishere, a tributary of the Karun. _ It is an hour broad m some places and two hours in others, and its length is eight or nine hours. Rumour says that in ancient times much of it was cultivated and inhabited ; to-day it is waste except for date palms and some cultivated fields in the neighbourhood of a village called Kut Faris, which is opposite Mohammerah; in parts of the island of El Mahalleh ; in localities stretching from the right bank of the Bamishere two or three hours long half-an-hour broad ; and in one or two places on the bank of the Shatt-el-Arab in the neio'hbourhood of the Persian Gulf. Kut Faris is in the form of an irregular square surrounded by an earth wall. Most of it is deserted ; the inhabited portion does not contain more than forty or fifty houses. This is the extent of the cultivated portions of El Khizr. The island of El Mahalieh, lying west of it and in the Shatt-el-Arab, and the cultivated patches of date palms two or three hours long and from half to a quarter of an hour broad, on the left bank of the Karun, from the mouth of the Bamishere, as far as the places near Sabla, are in the possession of the Idris and Nassar branches of the Chaab tribes which live in El Khizr, and of their dependent tribes. Chapter VII. The “ lengergiah,” or anchorage, of Mohammerah, as it is called, is the part of the River Karun between the present-day Mohammerah and Kut Faris, on El Khizr. At low tide this anchorage is not suitable for very large ships, as it has then only 18 or 20 feet of water, so that it cannot take ships much larger than the boats which are used there—“ baghala ” they are called—and which are of about 2,000 or 3,000 kilehs (a “ kileh ” is about 45 kilom.). But experiment shows that at high tide the water in the anchorage is 10 or 15 feet deeper, so that there are 30 or 35 feet of water in ^the anchorage, especially between the anchorage and the place where the Karun flows into the Shatt-el-Arab. When the Karun is in this condition, war-ships of the size of a brig, a corvette, or even, perhaps, a frigate, can come alongside. Indian and European goods sold in the above-mentioned localities and among the population of Ivliuzistan and Luristan and the Bakhtiari Kurds come to the Shatt-el-Arab from the Persian Gulf by ship and boat, and these goods would be sold in Turkey ; moreover, goods bound for these places come to Mohammerah by the Karun, and that is why Mohammerah is a fairly considerable harbour and port. While Mohammerah was a dependency of Bussorah, goods and merchandise of all kinds which entered the mouth of the Shatt-el- Arab from the Persian Gulf—whether intended for sale in Turkey or on their way to Persia—paid dues to the custom-house at Bussorah, and, similarly, the dates produced in Mohammerah and El Khizr and their dependencies, and all kinds of vrares coming from Persia and intended for exportation to the Persian Gulf via the Sbatt-el-Arab, formerly paid dues to the Bussorah custom-house ; so that if Mohammerah and the anchorage and El Khizr are left on the other side, it is Persia that will receive the customs dues on goods and produce which comes from the Persian Gulf to the port of Mohammerah and from there to Persia, and on the produce of Persia and of^ Moham merah and El Khizr and their dependencies which are exported to the Persian Gulf. Moreover, the “ miri ” property of those places which were formerly dependent onBussorah would also remain on the other side, which would cause a great diminution in the revenues of Bussorah. Hence the saying that if Mohammerah is left to Persia, .Dussorah will be ruined. Chapter VIII. The northern parts of Abu Jezi Kbarky and of the Fellahieh Fort, i.e., all the date t plantations and mukataa lands lying along the Shatt-el-Arah as far as Bussorah, have j b . een an d still are dependencies of Bussorah; but though they are held and administered by Turkey, the majority of the fellahs of the date plantations along tne bhatt-el-Arab as far as a village called Girdalan, opposite Bussorah, belong to a branch of the Chaab tribe living in Mohammerah and district—the Muhaisin—and therefore the Persian delegate used as a pretext for claiming those places for Persia, the phrase m the last treaty which says that the lands on the left bank of the Shatt- el-Arab m the hands of the tribes known to be subject to Persia shall remain as a possession of the Persian Government; and he claimed not only this, but also the left bank of the boueib five or six hours farther up, and the whole of the left bank of the !Shatt-el-Arab. Chapter IX. In referring to the old boundary of Mohammerah in the first chapter, it was said that it passed between the two Kasrs. Now the Kasrs are to the north of a village called Girdalan, which is opposite Bussorah, on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, and is dependent on Bussorah at the present time. One of the Kasrs is a ruin called Kasi -i-Bussorah , it stands m the bare desert seven and a-half or eight hours from the village of Girdalan. Kasr-i-Howeiza is about one and a-half hours above Kasr-i- Bussorah ; it also stands in the bare desert. No entry referring to these places has been found, but it is rumoured that they were built on the frontier of the two States as land-maiks, and the fact that they are brick buildings m the form of guard-houses lends colour to the report. Chapter X. These Kasis now stand in the bare desert. Investigation shows, however, that in former times there was a large canal, called Humaily, which was specially dug out from the^ right bank of the Karun and the neighbourhood of the place known at Kut-el-Abd, which was spoken of above as being about five or six hours from Mohammerah. This canal began there, passed between the Kasrs, and joined the Shatt-el-Arab near a place called Kut Rayyan, two hours above Girdalan ; but some 90 or 100 years ago the dam of the Karun near Sabla, which is three hours above Mohammerah, was destroyed by the Persians, as explained m detail above; so that not only did other places become ruined and deserted, but the water of the canal was drawn oft, and the neighbourhood was left completely desolate and waste. Chapter XI. As explained above, the old frontier separating the territories of the two States reaches a place called Sheria, on the left bank of the Soueib. From there, according to one rumour, it runs along the Soueib, and so up until it reaches the old bed of^the Kerkha, which joins the Soueib. Thence it follows this old bed upwards and passes through the kassaba of Howeiza, leaving that part of the kassaba which is on the right bank of the said river in Turkey, and that on the left bank in Persia. Thence, following the old bed again, it goes up to the present bed of the Kerkha, which it follows up till it reaches a hill called Dem Shah, the south-eastern extremity of the Kebir Kuh range, which will be spoken of in detail below. According to another rumour the frontier crosses the Soueib from Sheria to the opposite bank. Now there is a stream which comes out from between those parts of the Kebir Kuh which are named respectively Shahzadeh Ahmed and Leiteh Anar (?). It unites with other streams, escapes from the mountains, and falls in the desert, after which point it takes the name of Duveiridj. Three hours below a place called Biseitin, which is dependent on Howeiza, the stream divides into two parts, one branch* passing by the Hors and flowing into the Soueib ; and the frontier, crossing the Soueib at Sheria, comes to this branch of the Duveiridj and goes on from there to the main stream of the Duveiridj, which it follows upwards until it ends in the mountains. * Note .—The other branch of the Duveiridj flows into the Hors formed by the River Hid [Had?! [2500 aa —2] Oi 6 1 ii Iff Chapter XII. The river which in Persia is called the Kerkha, but after passing Howeiza is known amono- the Arabs as the Soueib, flowed through the kassaba of Howeiza from ancient times'until recently ; but a few years ago it changed its course. The lower Porto of* its present channel is known as the Kiver Hashim. The Hashim falls into the desert before reaching that part of the Duveindj which flows into the Soueib. There the waters of the Lshimspread out on one side, and on the other the waters of the great canal called Hid [Had ?], which the Beni Lam conducted from the Tigris so that the part of the Duveiridj which flows into the Soueib remains within the frontier; and it is usually imperceptible. Chapter XIII. No entry has been found referring to Howeiza as being part of Ottoman territory, nor has any rumour which can be said to be near the truth been heard from anyone. Article 7 of the treaty of 1140 says: “The country of Howeiza is situated near Bussorah, between Bagdad and Bussorah. There have been continual quarrels and disputes with the Arab brigands who lived there for a long time; and it is, there ore, essential that the said country should be taken and subdued by my Imperial Government; and the Shah shall in no wise enter or attack the _ said country nor prevent its being taken and subdued by my Imperial Government But it is understood that the said country was not in the possession of the Imperial Government previous to that date , and although it was subsequently taken and subdued, it would be hardly right for the Ottoman Government to lay claim to it, for it is probable that Howeiza still remained on the other side, as the treaty of 1150 speaks of the frontier and boundary questions as having been settled and cleared up in the time of Murad IV r.c., in the treaty of 1049 Yet a careful perusal of the text of the treaty of 1140 shows that, although the said place was in the possession of the Persians, it had not been taken possession of but had been obtained from the native Arabs. _ Moreover, some historical works show that at that time Howeiza really belonged neither to one side nor to the other, but was independent. In the Devhat-el-Wuzera (?) in the events of the year 1140, a.h. (1728) it is written that the late Ahmed Pasha, Vah of Bagdad, went against Howeiza and conquered it, and that he appointed the late Emir Mehmed Khan as ruler; while in a book published in 1812 by a man named Guiz (?), who was secretary to bir John Malcolm when the latter went to Persia as British Ambassador, it is said, on p. 106 : “ Until a few years ago Howeiza was under an independent administration ; but it has recently passed into the hands of the Persians.” This confirms the above observation. Chapter XIY. In view of these investigations and considerations, there is no harm in claiming that Howeiza belongs to Ottoman territory, and even if it is impossible to save the whole of the country of Howeiza from the hands of the Persians by such a claim, it occurs to me that it might be useful as a pretext for proposing that the Kerkha should be adopted as the boundary above Sheria. Chapter XV. It is known to the subjects of both States that the frontier follows that branch of the Duveiridj (mentioned in the second rumour referred to above) which flows into the Soueib, until it reaches the main stream of the Duveiridj, which it follows up till it ends in the skirts of the mountains. The left bank of the Duveiridj is held to be Persian and the right Turkish. From the skirts of the mountains referred to above the frontier runs entirely along the mountain-skirts. The flat lands to^ the south and south-west of this line are in the possession of the Beni Lam, who are subject to Bagdad, while the mountainous country to the north and north-east is in the hands ol the Feili tribe, who are subject to Persia. Chapter XYI. This, then, is the position of the present frontier, and the Persians have absolutely no right to the regions on this side of it. Within the frontier there are k wc f places called Beyyat and Dihluran, which are situated in the above-mentioned flat lands, near the mountains, and which until recent times were tilled and inhabited. They 1 . n the position of the Beni Lam, and each of them, in addition to the fifth part of their *1 'agricultural produce and other customary taxes, paid a thousand Damascus pieces (?) a-year^ a sum equal to 1,000 piastres, while the “ emval-i-murettebe ” fa land tax W belonging to Bagdad, was paid to the Bagdad Treasury by sheikhs of the Beni Lam ; but tor some time past the Feili tribe, who are subject to Persia, have stretched out the 4 -i^ n ° 0 PP iessi0r b and ba\e been the cause of the complete ruin and desolation of these two places. Moreover, a few years ago the Feili tribe interfered with a place called Beksayeh or Baksayeh, which is from three to five hours from the mountain PPPP an( * wa i c h also until recently was under the rule of Beni Lam, and was not liable to be entered or attacked by the Feili tribes; and now one-half of the fifth ot the agricultural produce which is due to the Beni Lam, is taken by the Feili tribes. Chapter XVII. Bumom puts the number of the Beni Lam w'ho are under the administration of the vilayet of Bagdad to-day at 11,500 houses in all; 7,000 of these are in the deserts, the reedy lakes known as Hors, and the marshes, which begin from the rDht bank of toe Duveiridj, and on the one side follow the right bank of that branch of the Duveindj, which flows into the Hors as far as the Tigris ; on another side follow the skirts of the Pusht-i-Kuh (where the Fedi tribes live), where the mountains pass into the flat lands, as far as Zorbatieh ; and on the third side stretch along the left bank of the Tigris, till they reach a place called Kut-el-Amara, on the left bank of the Tioris, and the villages of Jessan and Bedra [Bedrai ?]. The remaining 4,500 houses are on an island on the right of the Tigris, opposite the lands inhabited by the other part of the tribe. Present investigations show that during the period extending from about sixty years ago until the year 1263 (1849), more than 12,000 houses of the Beni Lam, con sisting of many tubes some because they could not agree with their sheikhs, some because they were unable to bear the tyranny and oppression to which they were subjected by the A'ahs of Bagdad, and some for other reasons—went over into Persian territory, and settled in the following places In the Fellahieh district In a place called Shaver (?) .. On the Kerkha River In a place called Ramiz (?) .. In the locality called Diz Ful (?) In Howeiza and district In a place called Bahbahan Tan On the River Kanin Houses. 2,000 1,800 500 100 2,750 3,000 200 581 Total 12,200 [sic.] Chapter XVIII. The present frontier of the two States passes by the places mentioned in Chapter XV ; but the original frontier extends as far as the Milleh Panjem(?) gorge, and the dividing line of the Great Mountains which, between the above-mentioned hill called Dem Shah and the Haft Ab Mountains, are called the Kebir Kuh. No entry or document showing that the frontier passes by the said places has been found, but the end of the boundary of the sanjak of Zohab is Ser Mil, and on p. 446 of the “ Jehan Numa ” it says that “ Dihbala is a sanjak on the frontier, and Jankuleh Castle, which is in the Pusht-i-Kuh Mountains (now in the possession of the Feili tribes) is also within the vilayet of Bagdad.” Moreover, according to certain competent persons belonging, some to the Feili tribes, who live in the Pusht-i-Kuh Mountains (situated to the south and south-east of the Kebir Kuh) and some to the population of Diz Ful, the frontier, after reaching Dem Shah, passes along the summits of the high ranges of the Kebir KuK Incidentally, while I was at Mohammerah, a man named Selim Khan, a kol aghassi who was in command of the Persian troops there, said in the course of conversation in the presence of Ja’fer Khan, “The Pusht-i-Kuh are Turkish, and the Pish Kuh Persian.” This sentence is a proof that it is considered among the Persians, too, that the frontier follows the lofty summits of the Kebir Kuh, for which the name Pish Kuh is applied to the north and north-eastern sides of the Kebir Kuh, which look towards Persia, and the name Pusht-i-Kuh to the south and south-western sides of the Kebir Kuh, which face the desert, and the high peaks of the Kebir Kuh form the line of demarcation between the Pish Kuh and the Pusht-i-Kuh. It is true that a report presented to the Sublime Porte recently (18 Shevval, 1267 (1840)), says that all the mountains known as Pusht- i-Kuh and Kebir Kuh are inhabited by the Feili Lurs, and that the said places belong [2506 aa — D8 to Persia • but this arose because no one had at that time been to those parts and seen them, because existing maps showed all the Keb.r Kuh, P.sh-Kuh and Pushtu-K h TCphir Kuh and finally because the necessary investigations had not been p p y • j -hr „„ j have recently visited and seen those regions, and have herei KfLen years a^go Major Kawlmson, the British consul at Bagdad, made a tour in these r $ p ,f “ ft statement shows that the Kebir Kuh was the boundary, and that it was lecogmsed by everyone as the boundary, even at the time when Major Rawlmson made his jomn y.

Please inform Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs that we are now drawing up a communication to the Turkish Government respecting Mohammerah on the lines indicated in my telegram No. 335 of the 11th April,'with which his Excellency is already familiar, and, as soon as Turkey accepts our proposals, we shall have no obiection to Persia accepting the “explanatory note.” We propose to inform Turkish Government that if they do not accept our proposals, which merely provide for a continuance of the status quo as locally observed for the past sixty years at any rate, we cannot assent to the customs increase or conclude certain pending negotiations respecting our interests in the Persian Gulf. The above is for the confidential information of the Russian Government. I gathered from His Majesty s Embassy at Constantinople that the period of six months for negotiation allowed under the protocol signed last December will only be reckoned from end of April (see Sir G. Lowther’s despatch No. 391 of the 7th May) but I am consulting Sir G. Lowther further on this point.

Confidential.) MY immediately preceding telegram Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed to me great anxiety regarding question of northern portion of frontier. He said that, while Russia could scarcely hope to obtain a complete return to status quo of 1905, it was entirely out of the question that she should allow Turks to retain certain positions now occupied by them near Urmia. He still believed that if question went to Hague Tribunal Turkey might make good her claims to these districts. He was therefore anxious to avoid a reference tn The Hague, and he attached great importance to the Persian delegates avoiding giving Turks a pretext for declaring that they declined to abide by the Treaty of Erzeroum. He_ said that he was ready to join His Majesty’s Government in any pressure which they might think necessary to apply to Turks in regard to Mohammerah, and he earnestly trusted that His Majesty’s Government would do as much for Russia towards the north. Minister for Foreign Affairs is not unnaturally apprehensive lest after a settlement has been reached about Mohammerah Turkish delegates should act so as to force arbitration on other parts of the frontier question.Mr. O'Beirne to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 29, 11 p.m.) (No. 231.) v St. Petersburgh, June 29, 1912, 9'40 p.m. YOUR telegram No. 542 I spoke to Minister for Foreign Affairs to-day as instructed. He said that he was most anxious to assist His Majesty’s Government in every possible way in regard to Mohammerah question. At the same time it must be remembered that Russian Government were deeply interested in an arrangement respecting northern portion of frontier being arrived at between Persian and Turkish delegates such as would be satisfactory to Russia. He was afraid that if Persian delegates postponed their acceptance of explanatory note “ for some weeks ” there was a serious danger that commission would not be able to come to a complete agreement within the six months’ time specified in protocol of 21st December, 1911, with result that Turks would insist on a reference to The Hague. He urged importance of Mohammerah question being settled and of commission approaching question of northern part of line. I pointed out that Turkish Government would probably not acquiesce in conditions which Persian delegates proposed to attach to their acceptance of explanatory note, so that proposed course was not likely to expedite matters. As, however, Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs maintained his objections to a further delay of some weeks, and as our interview was necessarily short owing to his having a pressing engagement, I asked whether he would telegraph instructions to Russian Ambassador at Constantinople to advise Persian delegates to suspend their proposed communication to Ottoman delegates until British and Russian Governments should have had time to come to an agreement on question. This he promised to do. I understand M. Minorsky has urged on Persian delegates necessity of taking up consideration of more northerly frontier, but without success.

We are having a map prepared showing in detail the frontier we claim, and we hope to communicate it to the Russian Government very shortly.

Reasons given by the Russian Government for their opinion are roughly those stated in Sir G.

Sir Edward Grey to Sir G, Lowther (Constantinople), (No. 351.) i^.) Foreign Office, June 28, 1912, 1-20 p.m. YOUR telegram No. 200 of 25th June: Turco-Persian frontier. Your Excellency should lose no time in informing Assim Bey that his proposal is quite inaceeptable. It is not even so advantageous as the mediating commissioners , line of 1850.Sir G. Lowther to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 24.) (No. 517.) Sir, Constantinople, June 17, 1912. I HAVE at length succeeded in inducing Assim Bey to show me on a map the line which he would prevail upon the Turkish commissioners to accept as the boundary in the Mohammerah district, and I annex herewith a copy of the map showing it. Leaving the Shatt-el-Arab on a point immediately north of Mohammerah Antica, the line would follow parallel with the Karun as marked by the red line, and then proceed north-eastwards, striking the Kerhah at Kuti-Sheikh Behram. The Turkish Government would abandon the territory to the east of the Bamishere to which they were entitled under the Treaty of Erzeroum, which only left to Persia Mohammerah and the Island of Khizr. and which is indicated by the line in red drawn from the Persian Gulf northwards If an arrangement such as this could be made his Excellency said he would be able to justify it before Parliament, as he would be able to argue that it did not amount to a cession of territory, but to a rectification of the frontier. The part which Turkey would retain was for the most part marshy and valueless ground. I did not, in the absence of instructions, argue the matter with his Excellency, who said that he trusted that this proposal would meet the wishes of Plis Majesty’s Government, but if it did not, he hoped that it 'would be possible to suggest one that did. It would appear from Assim Bey’s proposal that Howeizah, and the places known as Keushk-i-Bussorah and Keushk-i-Howeizah, would remain in Turkish territory. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER.

Sheikh Bender of Khoi demanded their surrender, and the Russian Government asked His Majesty’s Government to support them at Tehran in inducing the Persians to surrender them and at Constantinople in protesting against the incursion. The Russian Minister at Tehran had reported that the surrender of the men was the only way of maintaining the peace, as the Turks would otherwise certainly make a further incursion to set them free.
