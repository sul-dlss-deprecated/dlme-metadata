Kemball writes that he has received a letter from Mohamed ben Khuleefa [Muhammad bin Khalifa], chief of Bahrain, who requests the British Government's help in the perceived threat of invasion via Adeed on the Guttur [Qatar] coast, by the Wahhabi tribes under Ameer Fysul [Faisal bin Turki]. Following advice from the Bahrain Native Agent Hajee Jassim, Kemball considers the threat to not be genuine, stating that the Wahhabi tribes are more interesting in the Oman coast. However, he requests guidance from the Government should Faisal bin Turki attempt to invade Bahrain.The following enclosures follow Kemball's letter:1.
