The Indian trade returns show that India's exports to Persia in 190?'8 were ^371,200 and the imports theref rom ^288,400. The total trade of the United Kingdom with Persia was therefore &lt;£1,080,900 and that of India with Persia &lt;P659, 600. These figures, however, exclude re-exports to Persia. The ~e~exports from the United Kingdom to Persia, were only &lt;f?,?00, but those of India were6 ^428,400, of which a large proportion was probably British in origin. Again, both British and Indian goods reach Persia via Asiatic T^jrkey (Baghdad) and are credited to the latter. The Persian returns, which take account of all goods reaching Persia from England or India, by whatever route, show that the United Kingdom' is about 50 per cent* greater than the Indian, and the United Kingdom and Indian returns, so f ar as they go, support the view that British trade is consiaerably larger than Indian* It should be added that the Persian returns given above -relate to both merchandise and treasure, whereas the Indian and United Kingdom returns relate to merchandise only. About ^ of the value of the exports to India from Persia in 1906'? consisted of gold and silver specie, according to the Persian returns* (Intld.) H.J.T. 5/4/09*HiSir T. Holderness, Secretary of State would like to have statistics, for a sufficient period of tine to show what progress is being made, of Indian trade with the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia. (Initialled) F.A.H. 15/7/08, Please see subjoined statement which has keen compiled in consultation with Sir R. Ritchie* So far as any clear inference can be drawn from the figures, it would seem that (1) Imports into India from Persia have declined. (2) Exports to Persia from India of Indian produce have held their own. (3) Exports to Persia from India of non~Indian produce have declined. The last may merely mean that goods which formerly went to Persia by way of India now go direct from Europe. The Turkish trade with India is not unsatisfactory, « the improvement being marked in respect of exports from India of Indian produce. The note appended to the return, regarding the Bahrein \oBahrein figures is important. Their accuracy is doubtful, and they run from 1904~5 only* But they go to show that the Turkish trade has improved more than the figures in the Statement itself make out.

An unknown portion of the exports from the Gulf to India passes on to the United Kingdom. The British and Indian returns of trade with countries in the Persian Gulf are not drawn up in the same way and exact comparisons are impossible. It is probable that when adjustments for re-exports are made the British and Indian shares of the trade are approximately equal.iV.5. Figures are not available for earlier years, the Gulf ports in Turkey in Asia not being distinguished frow I&lt;evant and Black Sea ports. Since 1904~5 traae w ith Bahrein has been given in the Indian returns. The imports from Bahrein were nil in 1904~5 and 1905^6,but amounted to rf '334,000 (mainly for pearls) in 1906-?.

The re-exports to Bahrein were nijt in 1904-5 and 1905-6, and ^72, 000 in 1906-7. The figures on the preceding page were taken from the Indian trade returns.
