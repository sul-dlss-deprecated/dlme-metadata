(l) In memo. 1674 June 27th 1911 P.R. suggested to foreign their asking National or other Indian bank'to examine question of opening branches at Bahrain, .Coweit, and possibly Ma skat, stating that it had toeen considered in past by I.B.P. as regards last and first, whe^e however the terms of its charter appear to preclude l establishment of branches; and as regards last only by National Bank, which did not think terms sufficient ly attractive, ne added that business relations be tween the i.B.P, and Bahrain would also -cresumablv not be free from political objection; and forwarded a memo, in which C.A. pointed out that the bulk of the trade of Bahrain and noweit is with india, not Persia. Foreign replied that the principal banks and in- i • -terested traders at Bombay and Karachi were against the project (memo, 58-E.A., 9-1-12) and sent support ing note (dated 51-X-ll) by Department of Commerce and industry. This note dealt,chiefly with con ditions at B'Abbas, and reported the view that 'if a German bank went there and did well, a good bank from ±ndia would be aole to follow and catch it up', with comment that 'being first in the field is ad- psychological vantageous only at tne/jratscabc&amp;ka: moment; pioneering (2) is notoriously risky unless the time is well chosen./ The present time is not the right time'. It did not discuss a subsidy. On July 26th 1916 Cox wired to Foreign (Basrah no.3700) that Eastern Bank had. applied to open 'branch at Bahrain, uis favorable recommendations of this move were approved 'by Foreign telegram 710-S (September 29th 1916) except proposal that rupees should bo shipped tree of ireight ona-Lges by Government vessels 'when this can be done without additional expense to the otate', which they opposed as involving direct competition be tween government and private shipping enterprise. They were preoared to consider negotiations with B.I•S.N. regarding reduction of rates, if these proved obstacle to cstablisiimen t of bank. Bank, s aq:ent approached shaikh on question at, Bahrain in February 1917, but found in him same reluctance as had been met with in 1900 - though opening of two or Lhree European firms since then nad made matter easier - partly on religious grounds but mainly owing to opposition by principal merchants. j j .A.Bahrain (memo.1252, Dec.3., 1917 to D.C.C. so Baghdad) reported this opposition as still/strong that merchants were said to have offered to bribe Shaikh to maintain his attitude; but on august 9th 1918 (telegram 112-0 to Baghdad, repealed Buahire) announced that hostility had been overcome and shaikh 1 s full consent obtained. Baghdad again referred question to India, in view of currency position, with note that Eastern Bank, Basrah, were prepared to provide initial staff.f\ 4 (5) No further proposals regarding Ma skat or j^ovvoit, until P• A, Koweit (rnemo. 1141 July 31, 1918) suggested the initiation of banking facilities on the iirab side generally, through Gray Paul and Co., in cooperation with the Eastern Bank, M.

An attempt to establish » branch of th® Eastern Bank at Bahrain in 1917 sat with strong local opposition which was alsoat entirely due to the fact that certain InfXuentl&amp;l icerchants ware- in the habit of taking deposits of large auwe fro^ V.^e living frater nity for safekeeping during the winter inonthii md that tho ^aiabli® 31, raent of a bank would have closed this source of free tsoney for financing trading operatioas. The question of Interest '^as brought forward as a religious objection to the bank tut its vepreeent&amp;tive was able to give satisfactory assurances in thia respect ard in any case the objection was not raised seriously, bein,^ only a political nsove of the opposing merchants# The conditions in Kuwait are much the same ard I an \ inclined to think that the establishment of a regular ^bank would be opposed here alao# / I ;yould therefore suggest that it cl^ht be possible for Messrs Gray, Paul and Ooaspany gradually to assume iome of the functions of a bank (they already, I believe, issue a large rubber of drafts and take deposits of pe-irle in the ordinary way of business) arid in process of time to expand into a bank proper. It seems to mo possible that Messrs Gray, Paul and Ooxapany rirht be willing and able to come to some working agreement with the Eastern ank in this oonnection# I venture to think that the present is an exceptionally suitable time for an unobtrusive start as Government is paying out large sums of money on the Arab side in subsidies and payments for purchases made by various Departments and it would fceem quits reason- / able for them to utilise the services of the only European British firmi /'A firm to do Treasury worlf # The quostlon of the depraclatlon of Indian currency notes in Kuwait 1b roo^l/ing ^ttontion s.nd any atteinpt to V^p thoir value at par by mking thara roadily ohangaable Into silver isi^ht be worked through Mesdre Gray, Paul and Company, whioh would give the flTtn an useful basis on atiiat; to doitmen^e cpera«» tiona# Ihe provision of ^taff, as Meaara Gray^ Paul and Company have no European Aealatant permanently at Kuwait at present, and of safe-deposit aooomaodation will, x fancy, prove Uffioultj but, if they ^©re to work in conjunction with the ^aatern Bank, ■■ t mi^ht be possible to provide the one European Assistant neceae&amp;ry md Oovernmant might be prepared bo aasist In securing quiol: delivery of any safes etc- whioh xoight be required.

British Hosidency and Ooneulate-General, Bushire, 8th September 1918. To The Offgt Civil Commissioner, Baghdad• Memorandum, Your telegram 6502 of August 8th. I premise, partly to explain the delay in replying, and partly to emphasise the present conditions prevailing in the Gulf mail service, that Koweit memo, of July SI reach ed me on September 4. This was duo to the fact that there was an interval of three weeks during August, in which period no outward mail reached Bushiro from India, and consequently no ship was available in the river to bring mails down from Basrah. This state of things is bound to recur, as long as ships so unequal in speed as the tt Dwark:a n and 'Lightning' are used for this service. To turn to the Koweit memo. I have no emphatic i i opinion on the subject, except that the project of establishing a Bank at either Bahrain or Koweit seems to me to be one for which Government support should be eminently cautious and discreet. If the project is put to the Bank in such a way as to give the idea that the Directors will be performing a patriotic duty in accepting the proposal, the local Political Agent may find himself embarrassed in the future by exorbitant demands for political support on the part of the Bank manager. Similarlyvisavis the Shaikhs and the local mercantilo oommuni- that ties, I think/it is inadvisable for the political Agent to give any ground for the idea that the Government is 'behind the Bank to any extent. It is probable that the idea of its establishment at all cannot meet with general acceptance at either place without the exorcise of a good deal of personal influence by the political Agent, but it^should be made clear that it is the general interest of trade that is being considered, and not those of a particular British institution. It follows from the above that I consider it ad visable to make it quite clear to the Eastern Bank that if they go to either of these places, it is because, after a careful examination of the con ditions, they believe it will pay them to do so, and not at the official or semi-official instigation of Government. For the same reason I think the appear ance of the Political Agent in any negotiations be tween the Bank and the Shaikh concerned should bo limited as far as possible to an introduction of the Bank's representative on arrival, an^L to any official assistance which would naturally be accord ed to any newly arrived British subject. In fact, it should be made clear to all concerned that the Bank stands on its own bottom as a commercial con cern, and is not in any waj? a Government institution. Subject to the above, and to the Directors of the Eastern Bank being satisfied that the prospects are favourable, I think the mooner they get to work the better. The present method of financing the pearl trade strikes an outsider as extremely wasteful, in volving as it does an amount of movement of specie which a Bank ought to be able largely to obviate.I attach for convenience a tabular statement of the movement of specie into and out of Bahrain in the years 1912 to 1917, from which I am unable to deduce any definite conclusion, except that so large move ment both ways can hardly be a healthy feature of any branch of commerce^while the freight, insurance etc., on so large a quantity of specie must be a considerable tax on the trade, I think it is plain that unless the Bank is prepared to start operations at both places simultaneously, Bahrain should be preferred as possessing much larger trade,and using more specie. The suggestion that operations should be begun by Gray Paul and Co., in communication with the Eastern Bank seems to me to be one which can only be left entirely to those firms. I should be surprised to learn that Gray Paul and Go./ would be prepared to undertake business of this nature, but if they would I see no reason which could justify Government in obstructing themj at the same time I think some new blood in the Gulf trade would be an excellent thing, and in particular I % should view with distrust any measure which would tend to strengthen the grip of the B.I,S*N.Oo., on the Gulf. It appears to me that one of the most serious problenrs which will confront Gov ernment on the reestablishment of normal com- • mercial conditions after the end of the war will be the defence of the general interests of com merce against the virtual monopoly of freight # which will be possessed by that Company in allr- o 'V,„ Oriental Waters. For this reason I should be In clined not to suggest to the Eastern Bank the combination proposed by p,A. Koweit.

Letter from His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No. 554, dated the 10th November 1927. _ There is good reason to believe that the chronic confusion in the Ministry of Finance which, it must be remembered, always existed in spite I)oc J or Millspaugh, is becoming worse confounded.

The Persian Government are thus losing about £140 a day. 5 A few davs ago Mr. Wilkinson received a visit—strictly personal —from the Minister's private secretary, in which the latter enquired on behalf of the Prince whether the Bank could accommodate him with -,500 xlans So' to be repaid in six months Mr Wkinson regretted he was unable to make this advance without adequate security. 6. This morning the Secretary returned and asked if the Bank could advance Ts 2,500 a month for six months to be repaid at the rate of , tomans a month for the balance of 9,000 tomans due at tlneendothispen^ to become a loan the terms of repayment of which could ^ f rra nged a ^ The Secretary then added that he was authorised by the Prince to mention in confidence that if this could be done there, would be no further difficulty Sout accepting the Bank's offer of 3* per cent, or 3t per cent, for a three or sk montM deposit. Mr. Wilkinson related the above to me m strict confidence this morning and I beg that it may be so treated. The crooked ness and venality of Prince Firuz have long been notorious even among his own countrymen! but this, I understand, is the first occasion on which he hois so openly attempted to bribe the Imperial Bank I should add. that according to'Mr. Wilkinson, Prince Firuz sp^te of great superficial in- tellio-ence is wholly ignorant in matter of finance and is under the impres- sion that the Bank would make an exorbitant profit if tt'is offer wer accepted and could re-loan this money at about 5 per cent. He saw there fore an opportunity of feathering his own nest at the expense o is c ?• the Bank getting off cheaply by only being asked to pay 15 ; 000 To ™^ (£3,000) in return for his permission to do what he believed to be a ve y lucrative bit of business. 7. Since Doctor Millspaugh's departure every appointment under the Ministry of Finance requires only the Minister's approval and has to be paid for accordingly. A case recently came to my ^knowledge ^ from Kermanshah, where the scandals connected with the so-called Alimentation Service were particularly bad. On the suspension by the Peman Govern ment of Mr. Dunaway, the local American financial agent, a Persian sent to Prince Piruz 1,000 Tomans and asked for the post vacated by Mr. Dunaway. The Prince pocketed the 1,000 Tomans knowing that the applicant who had done exceedingly well would not dare to show him up, and appointed some one else who was prepared to pay 1,500 Tomans. 8.

Letter from His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Office, London, No, 585, dated the 1st December 1927. . - ^ . . . . . . . , . /.I . ■ .• i . . ■ - With reference to my despatch No. 554-Confidential of November 10th {S. No. 47), I have the honour to inform you that the Imperial Bank of Persia came to a settlement yesterday with the Minister of Finance on a number of outstanding questions. 'Mr. Wilkinson, Chief Manager of the Bank, explained to me in general terms the nature of the settlement which has been made for a period of six months. 2. The chief points are :— {a) The Imperial Bank will continue to transfer Government funds from one part of the country to another at par without com mission. (b) The Bank will continue to accept depreciated coins on the terms previously arranged at all their branches. {c) The Persian Government will confide all Government funds to the Imperial Bank. {d) The Persian Government, will leave the amount of the A. P. 0. C. royalty, about £1,400,000, in London, the bank paying interest at the rate previously offered. As a conces sion to the Persian Government the Bank will allow interest on this sum at a reduced rate for the period November 2nd— 30th. {e) The Persian Government grant to the Imperial Bank an option for an indefinite period to import £500,000 worth of silver bullion free of duty. 3. &gt;Mr. Wilkinson tell^ me he found it necessary to adopt a very firm attitude and to make Prince Firuz realise that he had no intention of giving way and if the Persian Government wished to obtain the concessions he was prepared to offer they must meet him in the same spirit. He held two trump cards of great value. Firstly the engagement to transfer Gov ernment funds at par was of inestimable benefit to the army and pressure was put on him and subsequently on Prince Firuz by the Shah himself to obtain a continuance of this arrangement. The Imperial Bank alone could do this. If the army had to rely on Bazaar merchants to effect these transfers or even if they were to be made through the local financial agents of the Ministry of Finance, long delays were inevitable, big commissions would be demanded by the Bazaar merchants, corruption was certain on the part of the financial agents. 4. Again there was the question of the depreciated coin. Unless the Persian Government were going to be reasonable he flatly declined to allow his branches to continue accepting it. He had warned Prince Firuz of this long ago. The Prince had ignored his warning and continued to, obstruct the Bank. Now His Highness was reaping the whirlwind of pro tests from all the bazaars in Persia and was trying to induce the Bank as an act of grace to help him. 5. I understand from Mr. Wilkinson that he was very satisfied with the arrangement concluded especially with the option to import silver free of duty. He knew that Teymourtache and Prince Firuz hoped to come to terms with the Russian bank whereby the latter would receive a portion of Government funds. The Russian Bank however are not in the position to60 render to the Persian Government a number of essential services which only the Imperial Bank could do. It came down to this therefore that the Persian Governmer^t could not have it bothways. As it was Mr. Wilkinson considered that the Bank's demands were very moderate. 6. At the very last moment signature of the agreement was delayed by Mr. Wilkinson receiving through Prince Firuz's secretary a final im passioned appeal for a personal loan, in return for which it was a ^ m made clear that the agreement would be immediately signed. Mr. Wilkinson was adamant, no loan was granted and the agreement signed. 7. There is one other point of interest, namely, the decision to keep a large sterling account in London which, Mr. Wilkinson tells me, is a new departure. The intention apparently is to use this money for financing railway purchases, an equivalent amount of the funds of the sugar and tea monopoly which are banked in Tehran being transferred to the current account of the Persian Government as and when the sterling account is drawn upon. i Gil D—77e(cJ FifD -26 1-28-3?.No. 142.

It must he. said that the chief foreign concessions,the revision of which are of the greatest Importance, are those of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company,and of the Xr.pertal Bank* In the past year we gave space to the purport of the concessions to the Bank an^ the Oil Company,and laid them before our readers; repetition appears superfluous How that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry for .ubllc 'orks are occupied in reconsidering the former concessions,and in particular the concession for the Imperial Bank has taken up the attention of the Minister of Finance,we consider it obligatory on ourselves on our pa-t to write a short art'cle and offer it to the people and Aut v ritiefl.

The Political Agency, Bahrein. Dated 5th May, I..29. To The Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Mem orand um. I have been informed 'by the Adviser to the Bahrein Government that a consignment of twenty lakhs of rupees in silver is at present in the customs consigned to Mr Yusuf ( marked Ottoman Bank ) Kanoo^and that he believes that it is his intention to open a branch for the Ottoman Bank here. The Adviser is st%ngly opposed to the opening of a. branch of another bank here, as he is of the opinion that there is not enough business for two banks, and that if the Eastern Bank found much business cut away from them they might reduce the sacle of their operations and post or close dov/n a native manager hereleaving Bahrein to an even greater e extent in the power of the Kanoo interests. I am unable to find the papers dealing with the institution of the branch of the Eastern Bank, but I have seen from another file that Yusuf Kanoo has been credited^ by Major Daly with having been violently opposed to allow ing them to come here, and also with having instigated Shaikh Isa to forbid it. The Adviser informs me that the Eastern Bank were only allowed to come here on the express understanding that they would not lend money at interest, whereas a represen tative of the Ottoman Bank who visited Bahrein promised that they would allow 10 : /o on current accounts^ in conversa tion with Arab merchants! So far the Shaikh does not appear to have any 1 \IL* very marked views on the subject, but^does not appear to be i- y- tyEBT'wr''.. 'f-o-. &gt;1 •i in favour of a second bank opening in Bcihrein. I personally think that it would not be fair to allow the Ottoman Bank to cut in at this point, for I am told that last year was the first year that the Eastern Banl fau^jhave shown a profit, and it appears from remarks that I have seen scattered in files that they were pressed to come here by us in the first place. Indeed when it is considrere that dealing as they do in rupees they can make little by that exchangg and by their concession they are precluded from can be lending money at interest there but little meat on their Bahrein bone. It would also be hot in the best interests of Bahrein to allow an increase of Kanoo influence, if it can be avoided, but I should be glad if before I express a final opinion you would give me some referenced from your records to correspondence about the Eastern Bank so that I may examine more fully the circumstances under which it was encouraged to open a branch here.

(No. 312. Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, June 1, 1929. I HAVE the honour to acknowledge receipt on the 24th May of your despatch No. 219 of the 7th May, in which you forwarded for communication to the Prime Minister a letter from the Imperial Bank of Persia protesting against recent infringements of the bank s concession. At the same time, you left to me discretion as to how, and when, this letter should be presented. 2. The day before I received your despatch I had had a long talk at a dinner at the German Legation with Dr. Schniewind, the present financial adviser of the Persian Government. I spoke to him about Dr. Lindenblatt, and what appeared to me to be the actively unfriendly policy of the National Bank towards the Imperial Bank. For instance, Dr. Lindenblatt had recently summoned the principal merchants in the bazaar, had offered them a 1 per cent, lower rate of interest for accommodation than that given by the other banks in Tehran, although this was economically unsound, and had pressed them on patriotic grounds to transfer their business from the Imperial to the National Bank. I said that this w T as so contrary to the assurances given to me last year by Dr. Botzkes that I was bound to look upon Dr. Lindenblatt's action as deliberately unfriendly, especially when considered in connexion w T ith his recent activities in inveigling employees of the Imperial and Ottoman Banks by the lure of double wages. 3. Dr. Schniewind said he very much regretted the bad relations between the Imperial and National Banks and their respective managers, and added that he would be only too happy to lend his assistance, if required, in reconciling the latter. I said I would speak to Mr. Wilkinson. 4. On the 27th May, after carefully thinking over the matter and the subject of your despatch under reply, I addressed to Mr. Wilkinson the letter of which a copy is herein enclosed. I also enclose a copy of his reply. 5. You will observe that subject to your and the bank's approval I would propose to recast the letter from Sir Hugh Barnes in the form of a letter from myself to Taimourtache.. I feel that a letter sent in tins somewhat less official form, backed by an exchange of views between Dr. Lindenblatt and Mr. Wilkinson in the presence of Dr. Schniewind, would be more likely to have practical results than simply to hand Sir Hugh Barnes's letter to the Prime Minister. 6. Unfortunately, Dr. Schniewind is away this week at Isfahan, but I hope it will be possible to arrange for the interview between Mr. Wilkinson and Dr. Lindenblatt before the former starts home on leave on the 9th June. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Sir R. Clive to Mr. Wilkinson. (Confidential.) My dear Wilkinson, May 27, 1929. I HAVE now received through the Foreign Office the letter from Sir Hugh Barnes addressed to the Prime Minister, of which you showed me a copy the other day. It is left to my discretion how and when I should present this letter. My first inclination was to request an interview with the Prime Minister, and to ask you to accompany me when I proposed to hand the letter (with a Persian translation) to his Highness. The more I think of it, however, the more I feel that simply to hand in this letter to the Prime Minister, however justified the substance of it may be, is unlikely to lead to any satisfactory result. Firuz would probably be instructed to prepare a reply, which would in due course be composed in specious if not in offensive [828 r—9] PERSIA. ^6 ^ CONFIDENTIAL. [E 3077/1070/341ij ^ 1 ^ Telegram F.

In other places, the Britiah consul uses his influence in support of the Bank, but in such a way that no harm is done to the interests of any competing British bank. 4. On the analogy of the Persian practice, I co sider that no support should be given to the Ottoiaan Bank which, by opening a branch at Bahrain, would com pete with the Kastern Bank, which is a wholly British concern. I consider that there is no room for two banks in Bahrain, and that, if the Ottoman Bank started competition, the Fastern Bank would probably have to close its doors.5.

Mr Oliphant read to them your despatches under reference, drawing their special attention to the passage in the postscript to your despatch of June lotn which runs as follows — ' If means could be found of associating the Persian Government with the Imperial Bank, so that the Government had a direct interest in the fortunes of the Bank, I felt sure that that would not only appeal to the Persian Government but would in the end be beneficial to the Bank . 3. Mr. Rogers said that Mr. Wilkinson, the Tehran Manager of the Bank, had arrived in London on leave, but that he had only been able to have a very brie, conversation with him. Sir H. Barnes observed that the Board of the Bank ha never hitherto considered the question of associating the Persian Government with the Bank, for it had never hitherto appeared that the Persian Government were sufficiently interested to wish to acquire a direct inters st in the Bank. Although many Persian nationals were shareholders, it was true that the Persian Governmen had at present no direct interest. He undertook that the Bank would consider the whole question, and see what practical solution of the problem could be devised. 4. Sir H. Barnes added that if it proved possible in the autumn to enter into new negotiations with the Persian Government with the object of drawing closer the relations between the Government and the Bank, he foresaw that it would pro bably be necessary for the Bank to abandon their claim against the Persian Govern ment for losses suffered by the Bank during the war.114 ^6 kmJ '1) ti tei 5. Finally, Mr. Oliphant referred to a report that had reached him that the Board of the Bank were seriously contemplating liquidation. He said that in such a matter the interests of the shareholders must of course prevail, and that it was not the duty or intention of the Foreign Office to urge that the Bank should place general political considerations before those special interests ; but he hoped greatly that no sudden decision to liquidate would be taken before the question had been considered bv the Board in all its wider aspects. Undoubtedly the Imperial Bank was of great value to British interests in Persia. 6. Sir H. Barnes explained that the question of liquidation had never been con sidered by the Directors, though it was a possibility which had naturally not escaped the notice of the management of the Bank. The position briefly was that the Bank would not be prepared to run their business at a Idss. At the present time, however, as in the past, the Bank were making a profit, and the question of liquida tion did not therefore arise. 7. From the foregoing you will observe that Sir H. Barnes has undertaken care fully to consider the position in the light of your recommendation that means should if possible be found of associating the Persian Government with the Bank so that that Government shall in future have a direct interest in its fortunes. ttacksmadeipor to Ministers of Str ion have not. soi of the Govern taken officiallj' cession and tWi .d spread hyrt letter iMi Minister, Teh x 1st and June Li: to inform yout: i the 10th 4 •ence, patch of J®' jvemiuent witl irect interest in'; t only af r of the I*' sbavea^ aoftfeBaitf! j Governing , Govern® 6 ^.

IN tlie course of a visit he paid me this morning my German colleague referred to the relations between the Imperial Bank and the National Bank. He had learnt with much regret on his return from leave a fortnight ago that the relations between the two banks were very unsatisfactory. 2. I said that I feared that this was to a certain extent true. I then told him that I had recently, with Mr. Wilkinson, discussed the matter with Taimourtache, and I gave him a brief outline of what I had said on that occasion to the Minister of Court, as recorded in my despatch No. 336 of the 15th June. 1 said that it was impossible to avoid the impression that the National Bank had deliberately set itself to cut into the business of the Imperial Bank and had made no effort to embark on those other lines of business w r hich were open to it but closed, under the terms of its concession, to the Imperial Bank. Was this the policy of Dr. Lindenblatt or of the Minister of Finance working through Dr. Lindenblatt ? Count Schulenburg preferred to believe it was the latter, ''in any case he considered it essential that the rivalry between the two banks should be put an end to and a working agreement arrived at whereby more friendly relations would be established. 3. Happily Prince Firuz has been relieved of his office as Minister of Finance and the prospect of better relations thereby enhanced, although personally I have little confidence in the good faith of Dr. Lindenblatt. I have, however, to record that Taimourtache asked me two days ago to inform Mr. D Alton, the acting manager of the Imperial Bank, that the Government had decided to keep a part of their funds in the Imperial Bank. i cn i i i • j 4. In the postscript to my despatch No. 331) I referred to what the Shah had said in regard to the Imperial Bank, and it may be that this decision of the Government to place a part of their funds again in the Imperial Bank has been directly inspired by His Majesty.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 312 of the 1st June and in accordance with the authorisation contained in Mr. Oliphant's private telegram of the lOth June, I have the honour to report that I handed yesterday to the Minister of Court a letter in French, of which a copy is enclosed, embodying the substance of Sir Hugh Barnes's letter of protest to the Prime Minister enclosed in your despatch No. 219 of the 7th May. 2. I had arranged for Mr. Wilkinson, the chief manager of the Imperial Bank, to he present during my interview with the Minister of Court. His Highness read through the letter twice. He then said :— '1 understand this letter to contain three distinct points :— '(1.) A protest that the bank's concession had been infringed ; ' (2.) A protest on the subject of bank-notes ; and ' (3.) A claim for indemnity for losses suffered by the bank during the war. 'As regards the second point, that is on the way to being satisfactorily settled. As regards the third point, I have already made it abundantly clear to Mr Wilkinson that the Persian Government will never entertain this claim for indemnification.' I pointed out to his Highness that the claim in question was for money looted from the bank mainly by Swedish gendarmerie officers in the service of the Persian Government, and the Persian Government were responsible for the action of their own employees. His Highness declined to admit this, but said that Persia was overrun with foreign troops ; that these Swedish officers, though nominally in the service of the Persian Government, had ceased to be under their control; they had become the paid agents of the Germans, and the bank should more properly have addressed their claim to His Majesty's Government, who themselves might have obtained a refund from the Germans in the form of reparations. Mr. Wilkinson here interposed that the money stolen was Persian money and that the bank had repaid the Persian claims at the head office in Tehran. Taimourtache replied that this did not alter the view of the Persian Government; the bank had three alternatives—either to pay, or to refuse payment, or to bring an action against the Swedish officers. They had chosen the first alternative, and their claim was more properly against His Majesty's Government. In any case he repeated with great emphasis that the Persian Government would never entertain the bank's claim. 3. As regards the first point, that the Persian Government had infringed the concession of the bank, he declined to admit this. He fetched a copy of the bank concession and read out article 6, which he maintained was rather an obligation of the bank than of the Persian Government. The Government were not bound to give their business to the bank ; it was rather the bank who were bound to assist the Government if the latter required assistance. Legally, therefore, he maintained the Government had done nothing wrong. I replied whatever might be the strict legal interpretation of the relevant articles of the concession the present attitude of the National Bank, as directed by Dr. Lindenblatt under the instructions oi the Ministry of linance, appeared to be definitely hostile to the Imperial Bank. Not only had the Government transferred to the National Bank all the Government business which had for the past forty years been done with the Imperial Bank, but the National Bank, instead of embarking on business which under its concession the Imperial Bank was precluded from under taking, came into the field as a direct competitor of the Imperial Bank and as nothing else. Under their charter they were established to facilitate commerce, agriculture and industry. They had done nothing, and appeared to have no intention of doing anything, for the two latter, and they had in no sense assisted the commerce of the country because they were merely attempting to take away the established business of [856 b—10] B j } ■ \the Imperial Bank without entering on any new field of activity. Mr. Wilkinson here elaborated various activities which were open to the National Bank but impossible lor the Imperial Bank, such as mortgages on rea property, the si k cocoon business from Gilan, which passed through Russia and which owing to the absence ol reJ^ns with the Soviet Government, was too risky for the Imperial .3aiik to un itake , the opium business, which should obviously be a Government undertakiag now athe Persian Government had established an opium monopoly. Bis Highness argued that these undertakings were all speculative and that the new bank could not aflord to squander its resources in unnecessary risks. I replied that as a national bank wit i le lesources of the Government behind it it should more naturally have attempted to assist Persian trade in any direction, especially in those directions which were not open to the existing hanks. Finally, His highness said that the bank s protest appeared rather to be for moral infringement than for legal infringement. 1 replied that whatever word he might choose to define the nature of the protest, the result was that there was a complete lack of cordiality between the National Bank and the Imperial Lank through no fault of the latter. His Highness admitted the lack of cordiality and said it was certainly most unfortunate, and lie would be only too ready to do what he could to assist matters. He regretted that Mr. Wilkinson was going away, as he would otherwise have got Mr. Wilkinson and Dr. Lindenblatt together m his presence m the hope of clarifying the position. I said that Mr. Wilkinson was going on leave at once and that he needed his leave jmd that I imagined there could be no question of his putting it off again ; he would be back in the early autumn. His Highness said that as soon as ever he came back he would take the matter up, as he considered iti essential that the two banks should be on friendly terms. Meanwhile, he would discuss^ the matter with Prince Firuz and with Dr. Lindenblatt. He drew attention to the fact which Mr. Wilkinson readily acknowledged that he had in the past always done his best to settle differences between the Imperial Bank and the Ministiy of L inance. 4. Finally, he expressed the hope that I would not insist on leaving this letter 01 protest with him as, in that case, the letter would have to be submitted to the C ouncil of Ministers, and I now knew' in advance what the answer would be. In the circum stances I realised that it would serve no purpose to leave the letter and to be sent m due course an entirely unsatisfactory reply. i t • i 5. 1 have no reason to believe that his Highness is himself hostile to the Impeiiai Bank and I am convinced that he realises the necessity, in the interest of Persia, for good relations between the two banks. I trust, therefore, that the board of the Imperial Bank will agree that it is preferable to rely on the goodwill of the Minister of Court and his promise tu clear up the relations between the two banks rather than to send in the protest and merely to receive an uncompromising answ 7 er. (j. I should add that in the course of this conversation his Highness spoke somewhat bitterly of the fall in the kran exchange, some 12 per cent., as he put it, in the last three or four months, i.e., from 48 to ^4 to the £ sterling. I asked him if he accused the Imperial Bank of beincr responsible for this fall in the exchange. He said no, and Mr. Wilkinson then tried to explain the reason for the fall. If the Persian Government had not insisted in keeping all their sterling reserve intact and had been willing to use it for maintaining the exchange, it would have been possible to keep the latter round 50 to the £ sterling. His Highness replied it was the policy of the Government to maintain this reserve in a gold currency—part, he said, w r as banked in Germany and part in Switzerland at 6 per cent. He then enquired whether, if the Government did buy krans with a part of this reserve, Mr. Wilkinson would guarantee the exchange remaining tixed for a certain period round 50. Mr. Wilkinson said this was quite impossible. The rate of exchange must depend on the balance of trade, and while the Railway Syndicate was buying abroad the supplies for the railway, Persian export trade was not sufficient to balance these imports. His Highness admitted that he was not an expert in exchange questions and merely said the position w T as very unsatisfactory and something must be done. 7. The Persian Government are, I understand, again seriously thinking ot establishing a gold standard on the advice of Dr. Schniewind, the German Financial Adviser, and are anxious to discuss the matter in the autumn. It is obvious that the conversion of the Persian currency from a silver to a gold basis could not possibly be effected without the help and support of the Imperial Bank. In any case, to sell their present stock of silver of some 50 million to 60 million tomans and replace it by gold would, Mr. Wilkinson tells me, involve a loss of 25 per cent., say £2 million to £3 million sterling. It seems to me, therefore, that a favourable opportunity nwy present itself in the autumn for the Imperial Bank to regularise their relations withthe Persian Government and the National Bank on a more satisfactory basis in return for their assistance m the matter of the gold standard. 8. Mr. Wilkinson, to whom I have shown this despatch, will doubtless discuss the question with his board on his return to London. He leaves Tehran on the 16th June. T have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE. (Confidential.) P.S.— June 16.—Since writing the above, Mr. Wilkinson has been to see me. He was requested by Taimourtache to call on him this morning. His Highness said that he had given to the Shah a full account of our conversation of the 14th. His Majesty had said : ' We need the Imperial Bank. I consider that both the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Imperial Bank of Persia are Persian concerns. You may tell Mr. Wilkinson that, also that I intend to reopen an account with the bank ' or words ; to that effect. Taimourtache went on to say that if there was any trouble betweon the bank and the Minister of Finance during his (Wilkinsons) absence, the acting manager was immediately to write him. As soon as Mr. Wilkinson returned, he intended to get him and Dr. Lindenblatt together and to go into the question of how the business could be divided between the two banks. Mr. Wilkinson told me, in fact, that Taimourtache showed himself most friendly and anxious to get matters between the ^ two banks placed on a satisfactory footing. 1 said I considered the Shah's message u ' ^ry encouraging, and I sincerely hoped the board of the bank would carefully go into w ■ the whole question this summer. If means could be found of associating the Persian mot .1 i Goverriment wlLl1 the -imperial Bank, so that the Government had a direct interest in Ln-JF the fortunes of the bank, I felt sure that that would not only appeal to the Persian Government but would in the end be beneficial to the bank. After all, the goodwill of the Imperial Bank in Persia to-day was worth a great deal. I told him for his private information that it was on the lines of direct association that Sir John Cadman had been discussing the future of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company with the_ Persian Government. I hoped that his board would very seriously consider the question in this light. ' R - H - C - Enclosure in Xo. 1. Sir 7?. Cli ue to Taimourtache. Mon cher Ministre, ^ ^ ^ Teheran, le 10 juin 10-i9. J AI I'honneur de porter a I'attention serieuse de votre Altesse la protestation suivante que la Banque imperiale de Perse desire adresser au Gouvernement persan, citant plusieurs exemples qui demontrent qu'a certains egards le Gouvernement persan n a pas respecte avec son exactitude habituelle les termes de la concession accordee a la hanque : 1. Concernant les articles l er et 6 de la concession : La Banque imperiale de Perse ayant ete nommee Banque de I'fitat, c'est-a-dire la hanque du Gouvernement, et sa situation exceptionnelle en Perse ayant ete soulignee en article 5 par I'expression ' Institution nationale,' la banque estime que la creation par le Gouvernement persan d'une Banque nationale, comme elle est operee actueUement, est contraire a I'intention de la concession et se heurte aux droits et aux privileges accordes a la Banque imperiale par cette concession. Dans les clauses 1 et 5 de la loi de 1927 etablissant la Banque nationale, il est dit que le premier but de la nouvelle banque sera de faciliter le commerce, la cultivation, 1 agriculture et 1'industrie par le moyen de prets a bonne securite. Cette categorie d affaires n'etant pas permise a la Banque imperiale en vertu de sa concession, elle ne pent avoir d'objection a ce qu'elle soit confiee a une autre banque. Bien que la clause 12 de la loi precitee prevoit dans le cours du temps une expansion des operations de la nouvelle banque, la Banque imperiale a naturellement suppose qu'on ne permettrait pas que cette expansion empiete sur les affaires confiees a la Banque impenale tant que sa concession soit en vigueur. Neanmoins, il parait maintenant qu en moinade deux ans apres son etablisseinent les operations de la Banque nationale sont conduites de maniere a envahir directement celles de la Banque imperiale en sa capacite de banque d'fitat ou de banque du Gouvernement. Or, on a recemment [856 b—10] B 2x v A u THIS D OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT. ''' ■ PERSIA. ^ April 22, 1930. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2.

A . 7 ^ ^ r 0, ^ [a* h' Tehran, April 4, 1930. ir ' IN your telegram No. 58 of the 25th March you were good enough to inform me that the board of the Imperial Bank of Persia agreed to a suggestion I had made that at the interview which had been arranged with the Minister ot Court for the 31st March, Mr. Rogers should go unaccompanied by Mr. Wilkinson, the chiet manager of the bank. . • -i i\/r- • 4. 2. My reason for making this suggestion was that, m my opinion the Minister of Court would be more impressed if, in the first instance, he received Mr. Rogers alone as a member and special representative of the board of the bank, than it he was accompanied by the chief manager. Mr. Rogers was, as a matter of tact, accompanied by Mr. Lingeman, the acting commercial secretary, as interpreter, as he does not himself speak French. . n ^ T . j 3. Having discussed the whole position fully with Mr. Rogers, I suggested that he should take with him a memorandum couched in conciliatory terms. As the bank were not prepared to go to arbitration on the P omt c f 0 f' cessionary rights had been infringed by the new law, I advised Mr. Rogers not to lay too much stress on the past, but to concentrate on the future. Appeals to sentiment and to the past services of the bank would carry little weight w ith the Minister of Court, who was essentially a realist. _ , ^ 4 On the one hand, his Highness was determined to weaken the position ot the Imperial Bank of Persia if the latter were not prepared to discuss a revision of their concession. This was not so much because he had any very defimte grievance against the bank as that the privileges enjoyed by the bank ■ t ° h ^ e sistent with Persian sovereign rights. I need only mention the sole right ot no issue, and exemption from all taxation until the end of the concessionary period in 1949 5 On the other hand, as everything has its price, there must presumably be a price at which it would be worth the bank's while to renounce this exclusive right of nntp issue m favour of the Persian Goveinment. ^ _ i . _ . , 6 Moreover, the ordinary facilities which the bank had hitherto enjoved were most injuriously affected by the recent law, and it was essential shou,d enabled to do business on at least an equal footing with t heNatmnalBank. 7 I warned Mr. Rogers that even if the Minister of Court could substantiate no actual complaint against the Imperial Bank, yet I knew ^t he thought they ^ reactionary and unhelpful. Although he had assured me that the recent law com trolling foreign exchange was not directed against the Impena. Ba , merely a phasS in the economic policy of the Persian Government, p!,^^ Qii thing quite different to Mr. Jacks, the resident dy rec or 0 . , , ,1 [ Company. He had, in fact, told Mr. Jacks that the law was ^f ^^he Imperial Bank, in order to break their monopoly of exchange and to force them to come to terms with the National Bank. While praising t e I }S. 0 JtH / j with that of for their liberal and helpful policy, he had contrasted their attitude with that ot the ^mperial Bank of Persia of ^ to me to bave a^rtain amount of right on his side. The Imperial Bank had been very short-sighted m their attitude towards the National Bank. They began b y th ' s ne ^ b X with undisguised contempt, and then, six months later, th f^ r ^ Foreign Office officially to support their Potest against an in concession. Up to the last moment they had flatly declined to fix the exchang agreement with the National Bank. , . . tn makp 9. In speaking thus frankly to Mr. Rogers, my object ^to endeavour to make him understand the point of view of the Minister of Court before he met him. [92 y—2] B111 eOfifi r ^ •' ( [ Ijcy difficultes que la banque a su surmonter pendant cette periode ne sont peut-etre pas suffisamment comprises an jour qu'il est. La banque conserve, neanmoins, I'espoir que le Gouvernement se rendra compte que ce n'est pas sans raison qu'elle se sent affligee par les restrictions qui out ete recemment appliquees a ses activites en vue des services qu'eile a rendus par le passe au Gouvernement persan et a la Perse. La banque est convaincue que le Gouvernement ne peut se plaindre qu'eile ait abuse de ses droits de quelque facon que ce soit. Elle se trouve, cependant, dans cette situation que ses transactions bancaires courantes sont serieusement restreintes par la nouvelle loi qui impose le controle de toutes les operations de change. Entre-t-il vraiment dans les intentions du Gouvernement persan d'empecher la Banque imperiale de conclure les affaires normales d'une banque ? Le Gouvernement persan ne reconnait-il pas que la banque peut lui etre d'un puissant secours dans I'avenir par son experience du pays, son organisation, ses ressources, son credit au dehors ? La banque elle-meme a tout interet a contribuer au developpement eoonomique de la Perse et a cooperer avec le Gouvernement de Sa Majeste le Schah dans cette intention. Mr. Rogers est autorise a affirmer de la fagon la plus formelle que la Banque imperiale n'a aucunement le desir de contrecarrer les operations de la Banque nationale, mais elle s'estime en droit de prier le Gouvernement de lui confier de pair avec la Banque nationale Fexecution des reglements qui regissent les transactions de change sans qu'eile soit assujettie aux restrictions dont elle souffre a present. Si le Gouvernement persan desire entreprendre des negociations ayant pour but la revision de la concession de la Banque imperiale, celle-ci se fera un plaisir d'etudier les propositions raisonnables du Gouvernement a cet effet dans I'esprit le plus conciliant. La Banque imperiale se rend compte que les reglements par voie d'arbitrage n'engendrent que trop sou vent Famertume et, bien que ses conseillers legistes lui out fait tres clairement entendre qu'elle aurait en toute probabilite gain de 5 cause, elle n'eprouve aucun desir d'avoir recours a ce procede. La Banque imperiale ne desire rien de mieux que d'arriver a un accord amical avec le Gouvernement persan. Le 31 mars 1930. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Interview of Mr. Rogers with Minister of Court on March 31. Mr . ROGERS, accompanied by Mr. Lingeman, called on the Minister of Court at his private house yesterday afternoon, the appointment having been arranged by His Majesty's Minister. After an exchange of compliments Mr. Rogers handed his Highness an aide-memoire, a copy of which is attached,* setting out in very genera terms the services which the Imperial Bank of Persia had rendered the 1 er ® 1 ; a ^ Government in the past, its pained surprise at the lack of conhdence which the Government now displayed towards the bank, the harm done to its business y the restrictions recently placed upon it, and the readiness of the bank to contri u e towards the economic development of the country in co -operation with the Govern ment and the National Bank. . , i .i ^ i i His Highness, when he had read the aide-memoire, remarked that it was largely concerned with the position of the Imperial Bank of Persia as the State Bank. Ihe question appeared to him to be one of purely academic interest as the functions ot State banks had never been very clearly defined He would like to po 11 ^ out, however, that in the original concession it was laid down that the Imperial Bank ' siege social' was to be in Tehran, whereas the bank was allowed, under Appendix No. 4, to establish it in London, where it has always been. This, m his view, was sufficient to weaken very considerably the claim of the Imperial Bank of Persiatobe looked upon and treated as the State bank, whatever that might mean. ( Artl ^ e ^ of Appendix No. 4 actually says that the bank s chief place of business will be m Tehran, no mention being made of the ' siege social,' whereas both are referred to in the original concession. The inference is that the chief place of business must in Tehran, while the 11 siege social may be outside Persia.) His Highness said he wished to give Mr. Rogers the most formal assurance that the recent legislation and regulations in the matter of exchange ha no • Enclosure 1 in No. 1. [92 y—2] B 2against the Imperial Bank (his Highness told Mr. Jacks the exact opposite). He realised perfectly well the benefits which Persian finance and commerce had derived from the operations of the bank and he hoped that the country would continue for a lonsj time to profit bv its activities. He feit very strongly, however, t.iat tiie bank bad failed to move with the times. It was no longer merely a question of tne bank advancing a few thousand pounds to the Government or to private traders. The Government was determined to shake the country out of its state ot lethargy and it must be able to count on the wholehearted support of the imperial Bank. T-hei Government had come to the conclusion that it needed a State bank which was State bank in name only, a bank over which it exercised undisputed control, and the only way of achieving that object in its view was to create an entirely new oank witM a capital supplied by the State. The National Bank had thus come into Demg. The Imperial Bank of Persia which had hitherto enjoyed a virtual monopoly of banking business in Persia, naturally resented this challenge to its position. His iJighness himself had expected a considerable amount of friction between the two baiiks. His efforts to reduce it to a minimum had been far from successful, but he did not bea .Fl Mr. Wilkinson, whom he liked personally, any malice. Mr. Rogers, he was glad to note, had come out to regularise the relations between the Imperial Bank and the Government. His Highness was certain that, if only a little goodwill were displayed on both sides, the two banks could at the same time settle their differences. The Imperial Bank, the Minister of Court continued, professed itself anxious to co-operate with the Government in every way. He suggested that the bank should give tangible evidence of its goodwill. One of the most serious problems with which the Government was faced at present was the need to adjust the trade balance. He had always been told that the fall in the kran was very largely due to the immobili sation of the oil royalty in London or, in other words, to the withdrawal from the trade balance of a large proportion of the country's invisible exports. He had followed the advice given to him by Mr. Wilkinson and placed £300,000 at the disposal of the National Bank. This was a sacrifice on the part of the Government which he thought the Imperial Bank, in view of the large profits it had made in the past, could well afford to imitate. Mr. Rogers here observed that the sacrifice on the part of the Imperial Bank had already begun. The bank held at present bills to the value of £300,000 which it had discounted before the new regulations came into force and which it was under a moral obligation to its clients to retire. It was quite unable, however, to obtain the required exchange. Not only that, but half of the small amount of exchange it did buy had to be placed at the disposal of the National Bank. It was already oversold to the extent of £75,000, which was contrary to all its principles and must lead to heavy loss. (This loss would amount to approximately 50 per cent, if silver had to be shipped to London.) His Highness, without expressing any sympathy for the Imperial Bank, stated that he had not fully understood the situation. The news obviously gave him great satisfaction as he expressed the conviction that this sum of £600,000 (£300,000 from the oil royalty and £300,000 supplied by the Imperial Bank) would suffice to fill the gap between the demand for exchange and the supply during the current year, thereby helping the Government to maintain the kran at its present artificial level. (His Highness does not appear to realise that the £300,000 which may be supplied by the Imperial Bank of Persia—if the board is willing to face the loss- will only tend to alleviate the situation by relieving the open market of the demand for this amount, whereas the £300,000 from the oil royalty are, in Mr. Rogers's view, entirely inadequate for the purpose. It is clear that exchange will only be available in the ordinary way by the rate being placed on a level at which it would be profitable for exporters to purchase produce, and it must be remembered that there is at the moment a world-wide slump in practically all raw materials and food-siuffs. , Tey- mourtache, unfortunately, could not even be made to understand that an unduly low rate would handicap the export trade.) His Highness next referred to the question of the Imperial Bank's sole right of note issue. He first of all stated very emphatically that the Government was quite determined to secure this right and asked Mr. Rogers whether he did not agree that it was derogatory for a sovereign State to allow its notes to be issued by a foreign concern. Mr. Rogers said that he entirely sympathised with the aspirations of the Persian Government in this regard. The bank, he added, was quite prepared to relinquish its right in return for proper compensation. His Highness touched on the possibility of the bank issuing new notes with a gold backing, a solution which he said would be very much to the Government's benefit (though less palatable to itsImperial Bank of putting half its purchases of exchange at the disposal of the National Bank. His Highness agreed without hesitation. The first essential, he 0 Ppositei pride), but immediately reverted to the question of compensation to the bank. He ^ had [I did not quite understand the value which the bank attached to its privilege. Mr. ^dconti Wilkinson had explained to him that the uncovered portion of the notes in ?er ' ftat tljf circulation represented to all intents and purposes so much additional capital. He ^ionof tVk (Teymourtache) had tentatively proposed, therefore, as a suitable form of compen- trader sation, and he now renewed the offer, that the Government should lend the bank a ^ jetharov sum equal to its paid up capital, i.e., £650,000, free of interest until 1949, when the er ial concession comes to an end. Teymourtache was asked whether, in the event of the ^ whicli board accepting this proposal, and given an agreement between the two banks to fix d control ■ ra ^ e ' ^ ie w 1 ou ^ ( J a o re ^ ^o away with the obligation recently imposed upon the iop 0 | v said, was that the two banks should find a modus vivendi and he asked Mr. Rogers to 1 come to the palace the next morning when he would introduce Dr. Lindenblatt to him. ithcdid ^ before taking his leave, appealed to Teymourtache to give back to 's he w I m P er i a l Bank at least a portion of the Government's business. He said that the i j p : bank would like to feel that it shared the Government's confidence with the National iH , ai1 ! Bank. Teymourtache asserted that there would be no discrimination whatever Ie 'r^between the two banks as long as the Imperial Bank of Persia proved its devotion to ; e( | the country's interests. The Government would like to feel that it had two State 't r^ 1 P.an^nks at its disposal instead of one.

PERSIA CON FLDENTl AI [E 2191/697/34] Sir R. Clive to Mr. A. Henderson.—(Received A^pril 29.) (No. 165.) Sir, Tehran, April 18, 1930. SINCE I last had the honour to address you on the subject of the Imperial Bank of Persia, Messrs. Rogers and Wilkinson have had two interviews with the Minister of Court—on the 14th April, and again on the 16th April. 2. At an interview which I had with his Highness on the 10th April, I handed to him a memorandum which was based on recent conversations which had taken place between Dr. Lindenblatt on the one side and Messrs. Rogers and Wilkinson on the other. 3. Teymourtache read the memorandum and expressed disappointment with the attitude of the Imperial Bank. They talked about co-operation, he said, but in practice they did not appear to be willing to co-operate. 4. I said I thought he was very unreasonable about the attitude of the bank. Mr. Rogers had given him a memorandum at his first interview which was couched in very conciliatory terms and expressed the willingness of the bank to consider the proposals which the Persian Government might make for the revision of the bank concession. Teymourtache replied that, in his opinion, there was no particular need to revise the concession. As regards the sole right to issue notes for the next nineteen years, he considered that, on the whole, it would suit the Persian Government better and cost them less if the Imperial Bank did this. 5. I expressed surprise at what his Highness said, and remarked that this attitude appeared to be quite different to that which he had adopted eighteen months ago, when the Prime Minister had publicly announced that the Persian Government desired to see the old concessions revised. His Highness then said there were two things which had very much annoyed him in the last few days. Firstly, a responsible member of the Imperial Bank had been saying that the present state of affairs could not continue and that the Persian Government would be bound to revise or rescind the recent law on the control of exchange; secondly, Mr. Rogers had put forward to Dr. Lindenblatt as the price demanded by the bank for giving up their right of note issue no less than £1 million. This he considered bargaining in its most extreme form. When he had asked Mr. Wilkinson some time ago what w T as the exact value to the bank of their right of note issue, he had been told that it was as though the bank bad the use of so much capital without interest. He had at once asked Mr. Wilkinson whether, if the Persian Government lent the Imperial Bank the amount of their paid-up capital, namely, £650,000, without interest, until the end of the concession, that would be fair compensation? Mr. Wilkinson had not given him to understand that the right of note issue had any further value than what he had actually mentioned. When, therefore, Mr. Rogers told Dr. Lindenblatt that the bank would give up this right for the sum of £1 million, he could not avoid the impression that the attitude of the Imperial Bank had not changed and that their talk of co-operation had no real significance. 6. I said to Teymourtache that Mr. Wilkinson had not perhaps mentioned the indirect, or what might be called the moral, value of the sole right of note issue. Circulation of the bank's notes in Persia was a permanent advertisement for the bank; the people had absolute confidence in these notes; they knew they had ^ present them at any branch of the bank to receive the face value in silver. I had no idea what would be the monetary equivalent to the bank of this, but it must be, I imagined, a considerable sum. In any case, I said that when he talked o co -operation I was not quite clear what he meant. How was the Imperial Bank to co -operate when they were placed at such a disadvantage with regard to the Nationa Bank ? It was essential to the Imperial Bank that they should be on an equality xor ordinary business with the National Bank. As it was, the National Bank, with the Government funds to fall back on to support their exchange dealings, were m a privileged position. Teymourtache replied that the Government had placed a Dr. Lindenblatt's disposal about £400,000 of their gold reserve; why could not the Imperial Bank do the same in order to help Persian trade ? I said surely this was WW'* BU8 u: £^olNfey i Vo April 29, 1930. Section 10. No. 1. [92 fi—10]an unreasonable demand; the National Bank were enabled by the Government action to make a profit, but at the expense of the Persian Government. The Imperial Bank, however, if they followed his Highness's advice, were bound to m ak e ^ loss at the expense of their shareholders. Yes, said Teymourtache, that is the difficulty; how can the Imperial Bank at the same time serve the interests of Persian trade and also 01 their hness was the wish of the Persian Government to force the Imperial Bank to clear out of Persia. He said certainly not but he was not prepared to modify the present policy whereby the Imperial Bank had to hold at the disposal of the Government 50 per cent, of the exchange they bought. 8 As a complete deadlock had been reached, I changed the subject. Later on, before leaving, I reverted to the question. I said it seemed to me hopeless to expect a satisfactory arrangement to be made direct between the representatives of the Imperial Bank and Dr. Lindenblatt. I asked him to treat what I was now going to sav as entirely personal and confidential. I said that I had the impression that Dr. Lindenblatt was animated by such strong feelings against the Imperial Bank that his main object was to drive the bank out of Persia. I did not believe that he was really considering the best interests of Persian trade,^ in addition to his animus against the Imperial Bank I believed that he had no love lor the English and looked forward as a patriotic German, not merely to driving out the Imperial Bank with its English employees, but to bringing in more and more Germans to control the economic position in Persia. If I was right in this surmise, it was obviously hopeless to expect an agreement between Dr. Lindenblatt and Mr. Rogers and Mr. Wilkinson. I again repeated that the Imperial Bank were ready to co-operate with the Persian Government to assist Persian trade, but how was this to be done? Teymourtache said : 'I have two alternatives to suggest. We could arrange a meeting at which you and I would be present, together with Lindenblatt, Rogers and Wilkinson.' I said that I personally had no competence in banking matters. ' No more have I,' said Teymourtache, 'but you and I might add a little common sense to the proceedings.' . j 9. ' The other alternative is that I should see Rogers and Wilkinson together; which do you prefer ?' I said I thought the best would be, in the first instance, at any rate, if he would receive Messrs. Rogers and Wilkinson, and I hoped he would endeavour to understand the bank point of view. He agreed to do this, and asked me to arrange for these two gentlemen to come and see him on Monday afternoon, the 14th, at 4 o'clock. 10. On the 14tlh April, before Mr. Rogers and Mr. Wilkinson went to see him, I decided to send to his Highness a personal letter, of which a copy is herewith enclosed. The object of this letter, which only in part relates to the Imperial Bank, was to draw the serious attention of his Highness to tlhe generally unsatisfactory attitude of the Persian Government. In the part of the letter which relates to the bank I endeavoured to warn the Minister that the present treatment of the Imperial Bank of Persia could but react in the long run to the disadvantage of the Persian Government. The facts were bound to come out, and if a British concern, which had invested money in Persia and had on the whole served the Persian Government and Persian people well for the past forty years, were to be treated in this way, he would look in vain if he wished at some later date to obtain British capital for industrial development in this country. 11. As I had the honour to report in my telegram No. 93 of the 16th April Teymourtache received Mr. Rogers and Mr. Wilkinson very politely on the 14th, and, in the course of a long discussion, handed them a draft, of which copy is enclosed,* of a revised bank concession. It came out in this conversation that Dr. Lindenblatt had, in fact, offered to buy out the Imperial Bank. Teymourtache said that this was entirely without his authority, and he expressed his annoyance at Dr. Lindenblatt's action. 12. When I saw his Highness the following day, he referred to my personal letter and to wfoat I had said about injury to Persian credit if the Persian Govern ment persisted in their present attitude; lie said that Persia did not wish to borrow any money at the present time, and, therefore, the question of their international credit had no practical importance. Such foolish remarks on the part of his Highness I am not inclined to take seriously. I had, on the contrary, the impression that his Highness was beginning more and more to realise that there was something wrong with his present economic policy which was merely having the effect of paralysing Persian trade and causing general irritation in the country. No one * Not printed./o^ ^ Gove TK ^It' a t )S0 ^ 1Ll ^ e ^y forced to do so will sell any exchange at all. This is not merely is fk a lo| ; because the rate of the kran has been arbitrarily fixed at 60, and considerable ^ dilc^ doubt is felt as to wl:ietller tlle Government will be able to hold the kran at this er ^ trade J ra ^ e ' because everyone feels that if the 11 rial ' currency, based on gold, is to be introduced next year, they would do much better to accumulate all the gold they can ^riiBiem■ P resent ' an&lt; ^ ^ their silver krans. As I told his Highness, there appeared H but he! to be two alternatives, and two only, either to let the kran exchange follow its normal ^ had to u'Course, or for the Persian Government to continue to support it by depleting their ie y bought gold reserve in Europe, and, if they depleted this reserve beyond a certain point, Subject, [ they would not have enough left to make it possible to introduce the gold standard tteliopelesq, currency at all next year. In fact, I gave his Highness to understand pretty clearly ip r esentati re&lt; ^at amateur finance was a dangerous expedient, especially when, so far as I was lat I Wa8r |; aware, the economic situation in Persia was not such as need cause any serious alarm, the iinp r J-There was really no comparison between the position in Persia to-day and the ; the l4p : position in Turkey.

Sllr ,| 3. In addition to this appendix, the bank received a letter (Enclosure 2) signed ' K hy the Prime Minister in regard to the question of their future collaboration with the ... . Government and with the National Bank, and in regard to the latter point a • ailX ^ memorandum (Enclosure 3) is attached to this letter setting forth certain details in . . ' .^.regard to this collaboration. I understand that the method by which this is to be i done is at present under discussion between the two banks. The main thing is that 1 ! the Imperial Bank is placed on an equality with the National Bank for ordinary ®7«ba,.king business. J ; etsesperij ^ rp^ e se ^l em e n t embodied in the documents signed by the Prime Minister was l OTffipte J^^ggQ^atgd. entirely with the Minister of Court, who merely informed the Council of [e i m Pe ra lj /Ministers what he had arranged. Although I consider they have parted with their ^ernementi;; note j sslie ] am convinced that the bank were right in coming to a settlement, m d liypottefp^ negotiations were conducted m a friendly atmosphere, and it was an excellent me croire that the board decided to send out Mr. Rogers. It is too much to hope that ' 111011 ' :l!i1 .^ Mr. Wilkinson and Dr. Lindenblatt will establish cordial relations, but I trust that que ce soit, • f u ture relations may be correct. lavemr,lei The news of the renunciation by the bank of their right of note issue has been )as ^ lie 11 - received by the Persian press, instigated no doubt by the Minister of Court, with paeans erse. Jedirai 0 |&gt; r 0p r p S ented as a ^reat triumph for the Government. It is also admitted nciere indepft that without the right of note issue the Government's Gold Standard Law must have 'BSCrapports^ een r 0 n( } eref ] inoperative. It is satisfactory, however, that these articles conclude , on a more friendly note towards the Imperial Bank and that the conciliatory attitude rmetsdeleiv: 0 £ the j g commended. Satisfaction is also expressed at the arrangement concluded :i de (although this has not been published) between the Imperial Bank and the National line par ' Bank with regard to future collaboration between these two institutions. I he leading ist de toute d a rti c le j n the ' Iran ' concludes by saying that the general attitude of the Imperial est ecnb i j^nk gain the sympathy of everyone in Persia. 6. It is of course far too early to surmise what will be the practical effect of this it dans UD e ! l arrangement, b u t there is no doubt whatever that the Persian Government have seul inovenpt 1 obtained the renunciation by the bank of their sole right of note issue at a very cheap et qui ' s; : u price, and, unless the Imperial Bank can regain the preponderance of exchange business, it would seem inevitable that there will be in the future a very considerable drop in R.H.UJ 1 their profits. I am hopeful, however, that if the Imperial Bank will only profit by the lessons of the past eighteen months, they may yet maintain their position as the leading bank in Persia. There is no doubt that the board ot the batik have for some years past been far too conservative in their policy—I might even say reactionary and, if it is not presumptuous on my part to express an opinion on the constitution of the board, I am convinced that the introduction of a little new blood couid only be an advantage. Since the abolition of the so-called Capitul ations in 19.:8 the wave of Persian nationalism has been spreading. I am the first to admit that this is less a genuine expression of national feeling than an artificially fosteied growth, but nationalism is being preached in the army and in the press, and due allowance will have to be made for this by all commercial institutions doing business in Persia.

IN continuation of my despatch No. 22J of the 15th May regarding the settle ment between the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Persian Government, I have the honour to enclose herewith a resume of the debate which took place in the Majlis when the agreement came up for ratification, and of further newspaper articles on the subject. # 2. The opposition to the agreement in the Majlis was led by the Deputy for Yezd, Farokhi, who has long been known to this Legation as being in the pay of the Soviet Embassy. On the 24th May I learned from a private but well-informed source that, on the publication in the press of the agreement, Loganovsky, the Soviet Charge d'Affaires, called on Teymourtache to protest against the agreement. I am given to understand that there was a very stormy interview between the two, in the course of which Loganovsky was practically told to mind his own business. That Loganovsky, after this interview, should have put up Farokhi to attack the agreement in the Majlis, a Majlis, moreover, which, with very few exceptions, is completely dominated by the Minister of Court, would appear to be very foolish, as these tactics could have no chance of succeeding. On the contrary, the press has been mobilised to support the Minister of Court and to defend the agreement. 3. On the 27th instant, the second reading of the agreement came up for discussion in the Majlis. Farokhi again distinguished himself by violently opposing it, but his speech had no effect, and the agreement was ratified by 85 out of 93 votes. 4. Mr. Wilkinson informed me on the 26th instant that the Commission of Control, at its sitting on the previous day, had delegated its powers to the two banks jointly, and that the commission would henceforward only sit once a fortnight to receive'a report on the amount of exchange bought and sold. The two banks would deal in exchange by mutual agreement and without reference to the commission. Mr. Wilkinson thought this arrangement would ease the situation considerably. 5. Copies of this despatch, with its enclosure, have been sent to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, and to His Majesty's High Commissioner for Iraq. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE.

Henderson.—(Received June 10.) (No- 288 -) ^/n::- Sir, ^ ^ i-fr Tehran, June 1, 1^0. ENCLOSED in your despatch No. 251 of the 22nd May was a letter from Sir Hugh Barnes to Mr. Oiiphant enclosing various documents, including a letter from Mr. Sidney Rogers, written from Tehran, the 29th April 2. In this letter occurs the following passage :— There is one matter I should like to mention in case repercussions of my negotiations are heard in London. The Minister holds strong views as to the rights of the Ottoman Bank, and I have been pressed rather unduly to include that bank in the privileges we have had to fight so hard to obtain for ourselves, to say nothing of the sacrifices we have had to make to clinch the bargain ' . . . . The Ottoman Bank have no protest to make such as we have, and I have not yet been convinced upon what grounds they can ask our Minister to endeavour to persuade us to help them fight against any disability in which the Persian Government may place them. So far as I understand, the Ottoman Bank have joint representation through the French and British Governments. Surely these two Ministers can bring pressure to bear, if, indeed, any grounds exist for their doing so! ' 3. In the first place, I have never made any protest on behalf of the Ottoman Bank, nor has their manager ever asked me to do so. Neither has he ever suggested that I should invoke the assistance of the Imperial Bank of Persia on behalf of his bank. 4. On one occasion, towards the end of March, he spoke to me of the bank's difficulties, especially the need for about £11,000 exchange a week and the right to have local agents where there were no branches of the Ottoman Bank to operate exchange transactions. He had failed to obtain any satisfaction from Dr. Lindenblatt. In the absence from Tehran of both the French Charge d'Affaires and the French commercial attache, I said I would mention the matter unofficially to Teymourtache, which I did. His Highness spoke to Dr. Lindenblatt, and I understand the Ottoman Bank obtained some small satisfaction on the second point, while Dr. Lindenblatt allowed them to keep £25,000 of the exchange they bought for their Hamadan branch to meet previous commitments without handing over 50 per cent, to the National Bank. 5. You will observe in the Imperial Bank of Persia's telegram No. 20 of the 7th May from Tehran, which formed an enclosure to your despatch No. 244 of the 15th May, the following sentence :— ' Disposal of 50 per cent, surrendered by other banks authorised to deal in exchange to be determined by mutual agreement between the two banks' (i.e., the National Bank and the Imperial Bank of Persia). This proposal was made not by the National Bank but by the Imperial Bank of Persia. 6. When I first read the draft of the letter in which this proposal occurred, I remarked to Mr. Lingeman, the officer in charge of commercial affairs, and incidentally Mr. Rogers's son-in-law, that it seemed to me a very invidious proposal as regards the other banks concerned, namely, the Ottoman Bank and the Russian Bank. I feared that the whole odium of this proposal would fall—naturally enough—on the Imperial Bank of Persia, and that Dr. Lindenblatt might one day make capital out of it to the detriment of the Imperial Bank of Persia with a view to estranging the Imperial Bank of Persia and the other foreign banks. I asked Mr. Lingeman to put this before Mr. Rogers, and to say to him that this proposal appeared to me so contrary to the principle the Imperial Bank of Persia were fighting for of ' freedom to do ordinary banking business ' that I doubted whether it was really in their interests to press for this. It seemed to me personally that the [147 k—3] -'JJA \ i ■ ■ ! p % — -■ ' i I i fl I -,1 ■ i J 'j Imwerkl Bank of Fer-fia would have been better adraed, « a matter oi principle, to prm for the retention by tkanwires of all the eiehange thej- tocght, and not merely of 75 per cent.

I enclose a note by Mr Lingeman which confirms what I have written o.-^.e, . g. I propose to show this despatch to Mr W ilkin^on, chief manager of the Imoeriai Bank of Persia in lehran, 1 I hare. Arc. R. H. CLH^E. Enclosure in No. L Note by Mr. Lingeman. ON or about the 3rd May Mr. Rogers showed me his and Mr. iikinson &gt; draft of the agreement to be concluded between the National Bank and trie Imperial Bank of Persia- One of the suggestions it contained was to the effect that the Imperial Bank of Persia should share equally with the National Bank the 50 per cent, of the other banks purchases. I expressed ^reat surprise at this proviso. I pointed out that the Imperial Bank in the past had complained, repeatedly and in terms of profound indignation, of the necessity under which they had been placed of giving up 50 per cent, of their exchange.* They had declared that it made business impossible for them. The Ottoman Bank, I presumed, had suffered from this handicap in exactly the same way. Yet the Imperial Bank of Persia were not only proposing that it should continue to apply to the Ottoman Bank, but that they (the Imperial Bank) should benefit by it. I did not think that this was playing cricket, but., quite apart from the moral aspect of the question, on which I felt very strongly, a proposal such as this might enable Dr. Lindenblatt, who had been makhig overtures to the Ottoman Bank of late, to do a lot of mischief. I spoke to Mr. Rogers just before he was going out to dinner, and did not, therefore, have much time to go into the question. The opinion I had expressed must have had some effect on him, however, as the draft which he sent me the next day, and which I immediately showed to the Minister, had been amended, the disposal of the 50 per cent, exchange surrendered by the other banks being left to the decision of the National Bank and the Imperial*Bank (see Mr. Rogers's telegram to Sir Hugh Barnes of the 7th May for confirmation). This alteration made me conclude that Mr. Rogers and Mr. Wilkinson had changed their views and now realised that it would be bad policy to claim any part of the exchange surrendered by the other banks. The Minister's views on the subject were the same as those I had already expressed to Mr. Rogers, but I repeated them to the latter at somewhat greater length, in accordance with the Minister's instructions. I was at pains to explain that the Minister's concern lest the Imperial Bank should have anything to do with the disposal of the other banks' purchases was dictated by the interests of the Imperial Bank itself, but this Mr. Rogers obviously failed to realise. He referred to the relations between his bank and the Ottoman Bank, which have been anything but harmonious since the war, and said that he was not here to fight the Ottoman Bank's battles. Teymourtache, moreover, had told him he was not to worry about any other bank. In the end Mr. Rogers asked me to redraft the agreement, which I did without mentioning the other banks. The agreement was signed on the basis of my redraft, but it was apparently at the last moment, and unbeknown to the Legation, that a note was added to paragraph 5 stipulating that the other banks would continue to give up 50 per cent, of their purchases, and that the Imperial Bank would share the proceeds equally with the National Bank.

Experiments which are III Advised. Mr. Sydney Rogers, who for macy years was London manager of the Imperial Back tf Persia, end who is now a member of the Bank's board of directors, contributes the following article to the Backing Section of The Time*. Persia, as one c£ the smaller of the recently resuscitated Eastern nations, it may safely be said, has been greatly attracted by the possi bilities of the late President Wilson's ' Fourteen Points,' and by the alluring vista of 'self-determina- tion.' Unfortunately these 'points' have been erroneously interpreted &gt; by almost every small nation. • Certainly in the East such nations lack the practical (xperienc, diplomacy and environment of the West, qualifications moat essential in carrying out progressively in a sane and cautious manner the advice given by him to the whole world to ensure lasting peace. As an independent nation Persia enjoys the right of managing her own affairs and is, perhaps, sensitive about outside pf rsuasion and possible interference; hence her haste to dis play authority in her own domain, without perhaps studying, as a cation more conversant with Western ideas most assuredly would, the ' ethics of international courtesy and without due regard for the feelings of neighbouring States who wish to carry on friendly intercourse. The method employed to arrive at a solution of Persia's economic and finaccial difficulties—difficulties which almost every country in the world is experiercing in like measure f —has been to establish Government ? monopolies embracing almost every | sphere of commercial and financial ? activity. _ — —System of Monopolies. i • , 1 . f10 J 1 ™* experiment ol this kind to be introduced was in ii,! import trade in euear 0 comparatively lar 4 e quantities oTltfnri rlr 4 0f a ^ OI 'oences for the export of raw 'iai^V 0011 consumption ha' practioaliy the nation's whole require- ments m foreign exchangP, both for e purchase of imports and for financing Ks exports, had to be at' rates the Bank ^ 8 C0mmJ S9J0D, o£ wh.ca the majority coneisted of members of the Government eervice and official of the National Bank. measure was not as successful as anticipated, and the import and export tr ade of the country was, and remains, badly disorganized. At this time the value of sterl- fifw e ?u re n 8ed J n kraDS was fix ed at 60 to the £. Trade was practically brought to a standstill and a situa tion created comparable with that resulting from the prohibition laws m the United Statee—namely exporters sold their exchange to importers direct and thus evaded the t xisting law. Realizing at the last the fallacy of having fixed a rate far too high m intrinsic value, the Com missioners were compelled some months later to reduce it to 90 krans to the £. Even this rate is inade quate to tempt merchants to abandon the prectice the new law engendered and they still do their business at rates far removed from the official rate namely, somewhere in the region of 102 krans to the &amp; The m x*; step was to acquire from the Imperial Bank of Persia its exclusive privilege of issuing notes and to replace the bank's notes ij Dational ia8 ue based upon a gold exchange value.

Foreigners' Difficulties. ,, -J 0 fff^ct Persia to-day is for the Persians alone, and no foreign capital or enterprise will apparently be tolerated. The difficulties that have to be faced by British institu tions, and those of other nations that have been established for many years m the country, are also shared at present by Persian merchants and traders, and it is a foregone conclu sion that unless an amelioration of present conditions is brought about by amendments to the laws it will be imposBible for foreign commercial repregentatives to remain in the country. Whether these possibilities will ba recognized by the Ministers at present holding office, or a general withdrawal of foreigners from the country be determined upon, remains to be seen. Before such a step is taken it is to be hoped that the affront to all nations—for it can be deemed no lese-^will have called forth protest. It may be asserted that the foregoing has been written in a spirit of criticism and is lacking in cons tructive advice, but it is only fair to state that counsel and advice from the best sources available, and offers of practicaf help from those to whom the country is well known, have been tendered freely to the Persian QoverRmmt*THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT PERSIA.

WITH reference to my telegrams Nos. 177 and 178 of to-day's date, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the letter which Mr. Butters, who is acting as chief manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia during Mr. Wilkinson's absence on leave, received from the Minister of Finance on the 5th August. Mr. Butters brought this letter round to me and told me that he proposed to send a mere acknowledgment in return, mentioning that he had sent a copy to the board and myself. I expressed the opinion that the challenge to the veracity of Sir Hugh Barnes's statement called for an immediate reply, and I suggested to Mr. Butters that he might like to think the matter over and, if he wished, consult me as to the terms of the reply he should send Taghi Zadeh. He subsequently called, on the 7th August, and we together drafted what we considered a suitable answer, which I gathered Mr. Butters would send Taghi Zadeh, with perhaps one or two minor amendments. 2. Written as it was two days after Mr. Lascelles's interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Taghi Zadeh's letter was presumably intended to make it clear to the bank that the Government in no way abandoned their uncom promising attitude. The latter, moreover, has been made public by an article in the ' Iran ' (copy attached^)), which has been evidently inspired by the Minister of Court. The second part of this article, it will be noted, deals with an article on Persian currency problems which Mr. Rogers, a director of the bank, contributed to the ' Times,' and in which he made use of terms which could not fail to irritate the Persian Government. 3. Mr. Butters himself, although he has been instructed to insist on the recognition of patent rights of the bank in the matter, is not unduly disturbed by the Government's behaviour. In the first place, he is positive that the National Bank are not in a position to buy exporters' exchange, and that, if any were to be had, the Government would have to have recourse to the Imperial Bank, which alone could afford to lock up capital in this way. Secondly, he is equally positive that the Persian Government are about to ask his bank to delay the withdrawal of their note issue once more. The fact is, however, that as long as there is no exporters' exchange for the National Bank to buy, the Government are not likely to realise how difficult the situation would be were it forthcoming and only the National Bank authorised to purchase. Moreover, there is a very important question of principle at stake which should, if possible, be settled before any bargaining takes place on the question of the note issue. It would, indeed, be extremely bad policy to allow the Persian Government a bargaining counter, which they would certainly not possess had they honoured their engagements. 4. The above considerations lead me to suggest, with all due diffidence, that the time has come when a strongly-worded note should be addressed to the Persian Government, stating in unequivocal terms the very serious view which His Majesty's Government take of the violation of the spirit of the agreement arrived at on the 13th May of last year. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES DODD. Postscript.- —I have only learnt this morning, after this despatch had been typed, that Mr. Butters, on second thoughts, decided not to send Taghi Zadeh a written reply to his letter. He has asked Teymourtache for an interview, he has had what he describes as another friendly conversation with Taghi Zadeh and seems to be satisfied that he is making satisfactory progress. I shall be to have your authority to address a note to the Persian Government as suggested, but do not propose to take any action without first consulting Mr. Butters. C. D. Not printed. [227 u—7]Enclosure in No. 1. Persian Minister of Finance to Mr. Butters, 1mferial Bank of Persia. My dear Mr. Butters, Tehran August 4 1931. AS you are well aware, by virtue of the supplement to the Trade Monopoly Law of the 20th Esfand, 1309, a ' reglement' was instituted by the Imperial Persian Government appointing the National Bank of Persia as the sole agent of the Government for purchase of the exchange sold by the exporters. On the 20th April, 1931, the Imperial Bank of Persia addressed a letter to the Ministry of Finance protesting against this exclusive agency of the National Bank and claiming the appointment contrary to the spirit of the agreement concluded in May 1930. The bank did specially refer to the letter written to her in May 1931 by his Highness the Prime Minister. By my letter dated the 2nd May, 1931, I clearly refused to agree to the argument advanced by the bank, and by stronger arguments refuted the claim of the Imperial Bank to any right of equality in this or similar matters with the National Bank of Persia, pointing out in the clearest manner that ' there was absolutely no place to raise any question of principle.' I informed the bank, however, that ' the question of how a solution could be found so as to give the bank the possible facilities and satisfaction and reach an eventual arrangement by which the Government might extend to the bank the desired facilities in this question and the hank give the necessary guarantees and promise of assistance to the Government was under consideration. Reference to my above-mentioned letter will make this whole matter quite clear to you. You will note that we did not in the least recognise any right for the Imperial Bank of Persia in its claim, but that, on the contrary, we rejected same entirely. If the Government took the matter under consideration, it was on their own choice and solely in order to do, if possible, a mere favour to the Imperial Bank of Persia, but in no wise because her claim was thought to have any foundation. Though no formal decision in the matter is yet reached by the Government which might lead to an amendment of the ' reglement/' I thought I could give, during an interview with Mr. Wilkinson, to his repeated representations and his request for answer, an optimistic reply, giving him hope of an arrangement and referring him to the Ministry of Economy to take part in the drafting of the would-be amended project of the 'reglement,' in anticipation of the hoped-for decision of the Government. I should say, however, that statements such as that made recently by Sir Hugh Barnes, chairman of the Imperial Bank of Persia, on the occasion of the forty-second ordinary general meeting of the bank (topic, ' Foreign Trade Monopoiy,' last paragraph), statement which, you will readily admit, is quite inconsistent with the facts and misleading, do not seem to be of nature to induce the Council of Ministers to take a very favourable decision. Sir High Barnes pretended that ' the Persian Government, as might be expected, admitted that a mistake had been made and undertook that the regulation would be amended.' Would it not have been much better if the chairman had stated the facts as they were and as they stand now, and not have told his audience publicly things which not only are entirely erroneous, but also certainly not meant to draw the Persian Government's special favour toward the Imperial Bank of Persia in the matter ? Having been quite surprised to read that part of the speech, I thought to write you these personal lines in the hope that you will understand and take it as a friendly notice meant to call your attention to the possible effect of such utterances in the opposite direction.

CONFIDENTIAL. [E 4549/847/34] Li 14(^1 September 4, 1931. Section 4. No. 1. /f4 Mr. Dodd to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.—[Received Septemher 4.) (No. 463.) Gulhek, August 25, 1931. WITH reference to my telegram No. 183 of the 18th instant, I have the honour to inform you that the Minister of Finance asked the acting chief manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia on the 15th whether the bank would delay the withdrawal of its notes until the 21st March next, unless the Government happened to be in a position to introduce the new note issue sooner, in which case the bank would be given two months' notice. This notice, however, would not be given before the 1st November, so that the present notes would not begin to be withdrawn before the 1st January at the earliest. Mr. Butters informed Taghi Zadeh that he would forward the Government's request to his board. The latter subsequently instructed him to convey to the Persian Govern ment their readiness to meet their wishes and co-operate in every possible way, it being understood that the Imperial Bank would, in return, be granted the right to purchase exporters' exchange on the same terms as the National Bank. 2. Teymourtache let it be known to Mr. Butters that the commercial treaty he hoped to conclude with the Soviet Ambassador by the end of this month would probably contain a clause to the effect that the Soviet acknowledged themselves bound to purchase exchange from the authorised banks only. This would clear the way for giving the Imperial Bank the privilege it asked for, and his Highness held out the likelihood that the monopoly regulations would be amended accordingly. He wanted, however, an exchange of letters, in which the bank would recognise that it had no claim to equality with the National Bank and that the permission accorded to it to purchase exporters' exchange was by favour of the Government. He pretended that he was prepared to go to arbitration on the question of principle if the Imperial Bank insisted on maintaining their point of view. Taghi Zadeh has also impressed upon Mr. Butters the threat that the bank would get nothing if it demanded anything as a right. 3. Teymourtache may or may not be bluffing, and he is certainly practising blackmail, but the fact remains that the bank cannot hope to carry on its business in Persia in direct opposition to the Government. An agreement on practical lines is the best that can be hoped for, and any categorical assertion of the bank's rights at this juncture might w^ell prejudice Mr. Butters's negotiations. I have consequently decided not to make any official representations to the Persian Government as yet, and trust that you will agree. 4. Mr. Butters informed me in confidence that, in practice, the bank could not refuse the request of the Government to keep the present note issue in circulation, since the withdrawal of the notes could only be effected with the assistance of the Government, and in virtue of Government decrees. On the other hand, Mr. Butters is also of the opinion that the Government, perhaps prompted by the newly arrived Belgian financial advisers, have begun to realise how much depends on the Imperial Bank to bring such a delicate operation to a successful conclusion. The National Bank is so short of notes that it is making its payments in silver, to the great annoyance of Government departments. Both the Belgian Treasurer-General and the German manager of the National Bank have been to see Mr. Butters on the subject. Dr. Lindenblatt has gone so far as to promise the Imperial Bank his unstinted support in its negotiations with the Government if it agrees to issue another million tomans' worth of notes in co-operation with the National Bank. 5. Dr. Lindenblatt confided to Mr. Butters at the same time that he was extremely anxious about the whole question of the gold standard and the new currency. He stated that he was going to ask the Government to acquaint him with the exact measures they proposed to adopt to maintain the rial at par, and [254 d—4] 1 i 11 it ia i H2 li6 would resign without tiny liesitcition if lie judged tiieni msiifticicnt. He Wcis 3, poor man—in spite of his present salary of £5,000 per annum—and he could not afford to lose his reputation as a banker. If the rial followed the example of the kran, he would be held partly responsible, to say the least, m banking circles, both in Germany and elsewhere. , 1 , 6. Teymourtache has promised Mr. Butters that he will settle the bank's affairs before his departure to Europe on the 3rd or 4th September, and he will probably see Mr. Butters on the 26th August. The latter is very sanguine of his ability to strike a bargain on purely practical lines, without raising the issue of principle, and I trust that his expectations may be realised. I have, &amp;c.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 463 of the 25th August last, in which I reported the intimation made to the Imperial Bank of Persia that the Persian Government wished them to delay the withdrawal of their note issue once more, I have the honour to inform your Lordship that I now learn on good authority that Teymourtache, during his visit to England, proposes to arrange for the creation of a Currency Board in London. If this news is correct, his Highness will have to sacrifice a certain amount of political prejudice to the cause of Persian financial stability. 2. The Minister of Finance told me a few days ago that the nickel coins of the new currency had arrived; that the striking of the silver coins would begin shortly; that the smaller notes were also here and that the larger ones were expected by the end of the year—presumably the Persian year—when they would be put into circulation. 3. Mr. Butters has proposed that the notes of both issues should be in circulation together during a period of some months. 4.

Mr. Dodd to the Marquess of Reading.—(Received October 2.) (No. 526. Most Confidential.) My Lord, Tehran, Septem ber 23, 1931. WITH reference to my telegram No. 204 of the 16th instant, I have the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith, a translation of the letter addressed by the Minister of Finance to the acting chief manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia on the 13th September, recording the bank's appointment as the Persian Government's agent for the purchase of exchange on the same terms as the National Bank. No other bank is to share this privilege, apparently. 2. The press has referred to a decree of the Council of Ministers embodying this decision, but the text of the decree itself has not been published, nor has Mr. Butters received a copy of it. The latter, however, does not think that it would be politic to press the matter, as the Government doubtless wish to give it as little publicity as possible, whilst the Minister of Finance's letter gives the bank the guarantee and rights it has been craving for. 3. Mr. Butters, in my opinion, deserves the greatest credit for having brought his negotiations to a successful issue. He has throughout shown an experienced intuition of the most suitable line of approach, and a fund of tact and patience, and the results which he has obtained show what success can be obtained by the display of these qualities in the direction of the bank's affairs. 4. All the exporters' exchange bought by the Imperial Bank will be held at the disposal of the Government, and the bank is to make regular statements of such purchases to the Treasury-General, as indicated in Taghi Zadeh's letter. It is only to this extent that the bank has agreed to ' place itself under the control of the Persian Government' (see your Lordship's despatch No. 509 of the 7th September), and this it has been willing to do from the very beginning. Mr. Wilkinson's letter to the Minister of Finance of the 20th April, a copy of which formed Enclosure {c) to Sir Robert Clive's despatch No. 224 of the 6th May last, gave a definite undertaking to that effect. It is, therefore, a mere excuse on the part of the Government for the delay in according to the Imperial Bank a privilege to which it was clearly entitled under the agreement of the 13th May, 1930, to profess that the bank has hitherto declined to accept the measure of official control required of it. 5.

When Mr. Wilkinson informed me of the matter I undertook to bring it to the notice of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and we agreed that he should invoke the assistance of the Prime Minister. 3. Having received yesterday morning your telegram No. 75, I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whom I met at the local races, whether he had any news for me of this matter, and said that the action of the Minister of Finance had made a bad impression in London. Feroughi replied that he had written to Taghizadeh, but had as yet had no reply. I shall be seeing Feroughi to-morrow, when I will press him for a speedy and satisfactory answer. 4.

THE exchanges leading up to the satisfactory liquidation of the attack on the Imperial Bank of Persia's customs immunity are, I think, of sufficient general interest to merit a fairly detailed report. 2. I endeavoured from the start to convince the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the issue would become a matter of first-class importance if it were not settled promptly, but I certainly failed to do so, and after a few days had elapsed he expressed his regret at not having taken up the matter personally with the Minister of Finance. 3. In these circumstances I was half-disposed to tell Feroughi, on receiving your telegram No. 85 of the 27th May containing a cordial message from His Majesty the King to the Shah, that I had received this message, but that I was not in a position to deliver it until the bank business was settled. I decided, however, on reflection, that this would be an impropriety, and so I merely told Feroughi that it was virtually certain that the Shah would talk politics with me when he received me prior to my departure on leave of absence, and that I should be obliged to tell him what I thought of the bank business. Feroughi replied that he was convinced that there had been no desire to raise matters of principle, and that he would do all he could to hasten a decision. 4. On the following day (Tuesday) His Highness sent Mirza Muhammad Khan Sheyesteh to see me about the Parsons case (as reported in my despatch No. 256 of the 1st June). With Sheyesteh I was more plain, saying that I was authorised, when I saw the Shah, to hold a certain language to His Majesty; I should not be able to do so if the Ministry of Finance persisted in its attitude towards the Imperial Bank of Persia. 5. Meanwhile, I had two days previously asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs to arrange an audience for me as soon as possible, and hoping that the (audience might be fixed for Thursday, I wrote on Wednesday to Feroughi, enclosing a copy of the King's message to the Shah, and saying that if the bank business were not settled before I saw His Majesty, I should consider myself absolutely bound to mention it to him. I enclose a copy of this letter.^) 6. Yesterday I was informed that the audience (to which I shall be (accompanied by Mr. Mallet) was fixed for to-morrow, and I received, simul taneously, the letter from Feroughi of which I enclose a copy^') informing me that the bank business was settled. 7. To complete the story, before attempting to draw various conclusions, I will add that neither I nor Mr. Wilkinson had any direct dealings in the matter with the Minister of Finance himself. My view, in which Mr. Wilkinson concurred, was that the method employed by Taghizadeh to communicate his wishes to the bank had been cavalier to the point of discourtesy, and that it would be a sign of weakness to approach him. Mr. Wilkinson therefore confined (himself to placing the facts before the Prime Minister, but, so far as I am aware, his repeated efforts to galvanise that veteran statesman into activity failed entirely. . . 8. The main conclusion which I draw is that the Shah s Ministers are satisfied that His Majesty would be annoyed if they were responsible for an incident which once again threatened to disturb Anglo-Persian relations. But for this consideration T am sure that Taghizadeh, who is painfully slow to reach a decision and equally obstinate when he has done so, would not have surrendered without a far more stubborn resistance. I am the more sure of this as the [831 u—6] Not printed.Director-General of Customs told me confidentially that, on receipt of his instructions, he pointed out to the Minister that the bank's rights were clearly defined. Another conclusion is that Taghizadeh is at present far the strongest influence in the Cabinet, and that his colleagues are afraid to tackle him except under exceptional pressure. 9.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a letter and memorandum that the Imperial Bank of Persia have just received from the Ministry of Finance on the subject of the Ministry's claim that the bank should not have taken income tax paid in the United Kingdom into account before calculating the ' 1 net profits '' on which the royalty of 6 per cent, was payable to the Persian Government in past years. The royalty came to an end in 1930, at the time of the cancellation of the bank's right to issue notes (see article 2 (2) of Appendix No. 5 to the bank's concession signed on the 13th May, 1930), but the Ministry's claim is in respect of all years between 1889 and that date/ During many of these years the royalty would not have reached the minimum figure of £4,000 which the bank was obliged to pay in any circumstances, even if United Kingdom income tax had been taken into account after, instead of before, the net profits were calculated; but making all allowances for these years the sums involved would be likely to prove very considerable. 2. I understand that the chief meager would like his board to take the dispute to arbitration if the Ministry persist in pressing this claim. 3. I venture to draw attention to the fact that the date, the 8th June, quoted in the Ministry's letter is the 8th June, 1932, which means that the Persian Government have taken a whole year to decide upon their answer. 4., I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade. 1 have, &amp;c.

I HAVE to acknowledge receipt of the letter dated the 8th June from Mr. Barnes, chairman of your board of directors, and I have taken note of the contents of the memorandum attached thereto with regard to the mode of compu tation of the annual royalties due by the Imperial Bank of Persia to the Persian Government. In reply I send you herewith a memorandum containing the views of the Ministry of Finance on the subject in dispute. This Ministry hopes that the arguments set forth in its memorandum will this time be considered convincing enough by the bank to settle the difference and that the bank's directors will not allow the aggravation to such an extent of a dispute over so evident a right. Since the Government have always helped the bank in every respect and still do so, the bank should not, by contesting such an obvious right, shake the Govern ment's belief in the sincerity of the bank's friendship. HASSAN TAGHI ZADEH. (Seal of the Ministry of Finance.) [859 t—2]2 Enclosure 2 in No. 1. MemoTanduvi on the Mode of Commutation of the Dues Payable by the Imperial Bank of Persia to the Persian Government. {a) THE General Revenue Department, in its letter dated the 5th April, 1932, requested the Imperial Bank of Persia to send to it certain information in order that it might be able to a certain extent to probe into the accounts submitted by the bank's experts in determining the dues payable by the bank. No reply has, however, been received on this subject. It will be necessary, betore the account of the said dues is definitely closed, to obtain a clear and detailed answer in this respect. In the above-mentioned letter it was pointed out that, by virtue of the terms of the concession, the bank should have had its centre and registered office (' siege social ') in Tehran and that, therefore, the bank cannot exempt from Persian dues a part of its net profits which it pays to the British Government as income tax because of its British nationality and its domicile in London. lurther,^ the Revenue Department had stated that the bank had at least impliedly admitted that the dues payable to the Persian Government had priority, inasmuch as the said dues had been debited to the profit and loss account before British income tax was taken into account. It was also pointed out that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited), whose concession was similarly worded, had never raised any objection in this respect and had always paid the dues out of net profits before deducting British income tax. (&amp;) The Imperial Bank of Persia contested the above interpretation, and in the course of its memorandum dated the 8th June, 1932, advanced certain argu ments which, briefly stated, are as follows :— Bank's Arguments. (1) As the bank had to work partly in Persia and partly abroad, and as it had to be constituted in accordance with the laws of a foreign country, and seeing that disputes between the contracting parties had to be referred to arbitration, the concession must, therefore, be considered as an international agreement and without reference to either Persian or English law, the concession must be inter preted and construed in accordance with the surrounding circumstances and the intention of the contracting parties at the time. The Persian Government, by approving the bank's statutes, has obviously taken full cognisance of the matter, and has also admitted that the bank must comply with the laws of the country where it is constituted and, particularly, pay British income tax so that it may continue its operations and make profits. Therefore, by ' net profits ' is meant profits remaining in Persia after payment of British financial and other duties. Refutation of above Arguments. The concession granted to the Imperial Bank of Persia has no international agreement aspect whatsoever. It is merely an agreement concluded in Persia between the Persian Government and a foreign national laying down the terms under which the concessionnaire should work on Persian territory (without for bidding him from extending and expanding his operations abroad). It is not, therefore, so important or effective if the Persian Government has not objected against the constitution of the bank, the establishment of which it had sanctioned, as a British company. Moreover, an implied agreement on a question of appearance (form) cannot be considered as proof that the Government has waived some of the rights explicitly assured (reserved) to itself in the concession, nor can it prove that the Government has permitted the deduction of a portion of the net profits due to it by virtue of the concession. The Imperial Bank of Persia must have its registered office ('siege social'— 'Markaz-i-Asli ')' and its centre of operations ('Markaz-i-Amaliyat') in Persia. In justice and equity the bank should centralise in Persia all its profits derived in Persia and abroad and pass same to the royalty account. From these should be deducted only such expenditures as are in reality necessary for the carrying out of the operations mentioned in the concession. British income tax should on no condition be debited to this account, because it represents a part of the net profits derived in Persia and abroad which the concessionnaire companv freely pays to the British Government by reason of its having selected British nationality.Bank's Arguments. IP Over agreat number of years the Persian Government has accepted that royalty should be calculated on net profits after deduction of British income tax, and the Hig i Commissioner who represented the Persian Government was no doubt aware of the method of calculation of royalty, and never objected. This is proof that the Persian Government has heretofore accepted the bank's interpre tation regarding deduction of British income tax from net profits. Refutation of above A rguments. The concession foresees the presence at the general meeting of shareholders and meetings of the directors m Tehran of the Government's special envoy. Apart from this the Imperial Bank of Persia did not in the past send detailed statements of accounts so as to ascertain that British income was being deducted from net profits, and as no documents or positive proofs of any kind were presented the Persian Government had been unable to agree to the amount of royalties it has received. Such payments have, on the contrary, been treated as part payments made on account and the Persian Government has not waived its rights. There fore, the implied consent of the Persian Government which, it is alleged existed does not apply. On the contrary, the payment of £87,304 in 1928 indicates that the Imperial Bank of Persia itself impliedly agreed to the indefinite nature of the Persian Government annual royalties accounts. Moreover, bv virtue of the concession, the Persian Government is entitled to 6 per cent, of the net profits of the bank. By c ' net profits ' is meant profits less expenditure, and by expenditure is meant moneys spent in the course of deriving income. For this reason income tax payable in England cannot be looked upon as expenditure, and for the same reason the Government's royalty must be paid before the deduction of the said tax, especially since the Imperial Bank of Persia, in spite of having had the sole right of issue of notes, has been exempt from all taxes, including income tax, whereas in England, where it has no such monopolistic concession, it pays income tax. In the circumstances, how can it be said that the payment of British income tax has precedence over the Persian Government's 6 per cent, royalty which must compensate the Government's Exchequer loss for the non-collection of the usual taxes ? The Persian Government naturally sees no objection to the Imperial Bank of Persia paying any amount it likes out of its profits to any person or authority it chooses, but this prerogative cannot cause a diminution of the undoubted rights of the Persian Government. Bank's Arguments. (3) The fact that royalty payable to the Persian Government has been debited to the profit and loss account before providing for British income tax, cannot be taken as evidence of the bank's interpretation of the meaning of ' net profits ' mentioned in the concession. The said procedure was adopted by arrangement with the British income tax authorities. Besides, the practice of another company which also holds a concession in Persia cannot affect the subject in dispute. Refutation of above Arguments. Admittedly, the said facts were cited only as secondary evidence, and it is true that by themselves they are not sufficient to prove the Persian Government's contention. The other questions, however, are amply sufficient to prove the justice of the Persian Exchequer's claim, in favour of which the following argument may also be added :— It is entirely contrary to logic that taxes payable in Persia should be subject to an increase or decrease in taxation in another country, for in this manner it will be sufficient for the latter country to raise its taxation two or three times in order that as a result the Persian Government's dues may sustain a very considerable fall.

Hoare to Sir John Simon.—{Received January 16, 1934.) (No. 612.) Sir, Tehran, December 30, 1933. I HAVE the honour to inform you that the chief manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia has shown me copies of correspondence exchanged during the last two or three months between the India Office and the bank's London office respecting the importation of silver into India across the Indo-Persian land frontier. 2. The gist of this correspondence is to the effect that the bank have pointed out to the India Office that a large and lucrative trade is taking place across this frontier in silver bullion, which thereby escapes the Indian customs duty; that the National Bank and numerous firms engage freely in this trade; that they (the Imperial Bank) have been invited to undertake this business on behalf of at least one customer, and that they wish to know whether the Government of India approve of their doing so. The replies from the India Office, if I remember aright, avoid any direct expression of either approval or disapproval, but simply state that the bank should not rely upon the continuance of the conditions which make this trade possible. 3. The anomalies and abuses which arise from the non-application of the Indian customs tariff to goods imported over the Persian frontier are, of course, onlv too well known to the Government of India, who have had under considera tion for many years the question of establishing customs barriers upon the land frontiers of 'India. During the past year His Majesty's consul-general for Khorasan has drawn frequent attention to the use that is made of the Zahedan route, and particularly of the parcel post service, for the entry into India of goods and money that certainly do not originate in Persia. I have little to add to the information that he has already supplied or that is already known to the Government of India, except that it has come to my knowledge that at least one Indian merchant (a copy of whose card I encloseC)) has found it woith his while to set up in business in Tehran for no other real purpose than to undeitake the importation of silver bars from Belgium by parcel post and their re-expedition to India via Zahedan. . ± ± ± 4. I have at present no exact figures illustrating the extent oi this ti arnc, but Mr Wilkinson is endeavouring to obtain some from the Persian Customs Administration. These figures will, of course, only show the amount ot silver re-exported from Persia. It is possible that a certain amount is also exported, that is to say smuggled, out of the eountry. In the meanwhile, Major Daly s diary for November states that consignments of 348,000 lb. and 4,550 lb left Zahedan on the 7th and 19th November respectively. Even if oz. should be read for ' lb ' in the case of the first consignment, as seems more probable, it Is obvious that, with a duty on silver of 7 annas 6 pice an ounce, the Government of India lost revenue amounting to over H lakhs of rupees as the r®®™ ° f ® single transaction. In addition, large quantities of si \ goo s aie ^ f,, nm shipped to Bander Abbas, often out of bond at Bombay, and tra 'ff ied thereby road to India by way of Kerman and Zahedan The transport by this route no doubt affects to some extent the profits to be gained by the ev ^ of customs duties, and at present it is perhaps only upon bullion « of small bulk and high value that this profit can be earned, ' ^ ^ transport conditions are rapidly improving in Persia and he mpeDHgof railway between Zahedan and Nok Kundi, if it takes place, should make this loute •n-ffiSMSL. ho. ,h.

Now that the question has waited so long, there is some advantage in'letting it wait until the 10th May, 1936, when the Tariff Autonomy Treaty expires and the necessity of negotiating a new tariff agreement on the lines of those ordinarily negotiated with other countries will almost certainly arise It will be remembered that nothing ever came of the long negotiations , with the Persian Government over the interpretationofthe protocol attached to article 2 of the treaty in so far as it might be affected by the imposition of a customs barrier on the Indo-Persian frontier. The last proposals suspended in 1931 and never resumed, were for an exchange of notes, in which the Government of India would declare in effect that a customs barrier was not likely to be imposed, but that, if it were, the right of the Persian Government to raise then customs tariff on the principal articles of exportation from India would be submitted to arbitration. Since then it has been assumed that, provided he customs barrier were established on all land frontiers alike the basis of the obiections of the Persian Government would disappear. Although 1 am not convinced that they would accept the change without a protest, the ensuing difficulties should be theoretical rather than practical, for the amount ot duty- collected in a year on this frontier on Persian products destined to remain m India would probably not be very large. In any case, I am m favour of taking a decision first and informing the Persian Government afterwards. 6. As against the treaty position, the loss of revenue to the (jovernment 01 India appears a compelling reason for taking action, but this is a point on wmcn it is hardly for me to express an opinion. There are also other reasons, such as the desirability of being able, if necessary, to appl\ the same restrictions to Persian consuls in India as are applied to British consuls in 1 eisia m the mattei of customs procedure. The ideal solution would no doubt be, an aiiangement b} which customs duties could be imposed on all goods, except those pioduced in Persia or other limitrophe countries, but it would be difficult, I fancy, to put such an arrangement into force without infringing the most -favouied-nation lights of other countries 7. I have digressed somewhat far from the affairs of the Imperial Bank of Persia. Though the importation of silver into India over the land frontiers is perfectly legal, it is a business in which, in the circumstances, a leputable institution naturally hesitates to engage without an assurance that the Govern ment of India would approve. I therefore suggest that, if possible, urgent steps be taken to stop the importation of silver through Baluchistan, either by the imposition of a customs barrier or otherwise. Failing this, I submit that the Imperial Bank of Persia should be given a clear indication that the Government of India see no objection to their undertaking this business when it comes their way, and should also be told in confidence, in advance, when any measures to stop the traffic are about to be put into force. The present position is that a reputable British institution is penalised by its own sense of propriety, while its rivals, including the National Bank of Persia, take the profit. 8.

The Agricultural Bank's subscriptions towards this total amount to 76,210,200 rials (about £846,800), of which 36,380,450 rials (about £404,200) paid up.

Mr. Seymour to Mr. Eden.—[Received February 28.) (No. 40 E. Confidential.) Sir, Tehran, February 7, 1938. WITH reference to my despatch No. 29 E. of the 28th January, I have the honour to inform you that the Tehran manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran has again been approached by M. Nariman, of the Exchange Control Commission, with a view to the granting by the bank of an advance of £1 million. 2. The renewal of this request was parried by Mr. Butters with an enquiry as to what satisfaction he would be given as regards a whole series of points which he had put to the Minister of Finance—points which were, I understand, largely designed to free the Imperial Bank of Iran from numerous restrictions on their operations which have been imposed by regulations since their arrangement with M. Davar of March 1936. These restrictions, which in the opinion of Mr. Butters have been drawn up in incompetence rather than by hostile design, have prevented the bank from doing legitimate business which, incidentally, the National Bank would not in any case be in a position to handle. 3. Mr. Butters has explained to me that the desired advance of £1 million would amount, to all intents and purposes, to a loan for which no security had been offered, and he feels sure that even if satisfaction were given on all the points referred to above, his bank would not feel able to sanction such a straight loan, as the military and railway commitments of the Iranian Government for the next few years are much too heavy for a concession of this kind to be safe. 4. I gather that M. Nariman was entirely unforthcoming on the question of the restrictions mentioned in paragraph 2 above, and that he immediately proceeded to repeat his further request for a reduction in the rate of interest in the credits granted by the bank to the Iranian Government, to which I referred in paragraph 1 of my despatch No. 29 E., to a figure below the present 4 per cent., though apparently he did not seem to expect a favourable response. 5. The arrangement concluded by the bank with the late M. Davar in 1936 lapses in March next, and, unless a further agreement is reached before then, the Iranian Government will lose the credits put at their disposal by the bank, and the latter will lose all right to conduct operations in foreign exchange. In this connexion I understand that the board of the Imperial Bank of Iran agree with their manager here that the renewal of the advance under the 1936 arrange ment must in any case be conditional upon the settlement of a number of points affecting the bank's liberty to trade. 6. Mr. Butters has informed me that he has allowed the advance to the Treasury of £300,000, the request for which I mentioned in paragraph 5 of my despatch under reference. This is, of course, quite separate from the question of the £1 million desired by M. Nariman for the needs of the Exchange Control Commission. The advance is due for repayment in about a month, and as the oil royalties do not fall due during this period, it is by no means clear how the Ministry of Finance will be able to effect repayment. 7. As regards the question of Mr. Butters s protest against the alleged attempt of the Iranian Societe des Cotonnades to side-track the Inipei ial Bank of Iran in connexion with the purchase in England of cotton goods, I learn that the Minister of Finance has replied that the Banque Mellie are the agents of the societe, so that it was natural that the societe s representatives in London should give this bank as a reference. The representatives had, however, no autnoi ity, and still less anv instructions, to insist on excluding the Imperial Bank or lan. M. Bader said that he was writing to the societe's representatives with a view to clearing the matter up. , ^ ^ ^ 8.

X heard privately that the Americans had asked Lloyds to coiae in, but Lloyds, who represent the I .B .I, in India, said quite properly that they considered it was in territory and asked them to take it up. 3. There was no tiiiie to lose, so having fixed things with Shaikh :iait;jan, I put forward cay annual trip to Tehran, and ^ot Walters, the Chief Jana^er of the i.b.X., to conclude the arrangements t^nd select a suitable inan to open the branch, and he lias now t;one to India to recruit staff. I did not want the astern bank to have long notice of the i .B .I*© intent- -ions as X knew it Viould only lead to a personal appeal to preserve their csonopoly. 4. If the i,B # X. had not agreed to come in, the way would have been open for someone we did not want. I saw from a recent intercept that the riastern Bank feared the opening of an American bank in lihahran, and ^e mi^it easily have had them in Bahrain, or, worse still, some mushroom grow^th such as we nearly got in Kuwait. You may have seen from recent intercepts that there has been some talk of an Arab bank in the Qulf with a capital of 10 - lb lakhs and a half baked concern of this description would discredit serious banks. Itxe I.B.I., who have proved very satisfactory in Kuwait, will fill a crying need in Bahrain as the Astern Bank do not understand the Persian trade, and we have every- i -thing to 4$ain by having them on both sides of the Gulf.

The fact that you have seen it should not be disclosed to the Head Office of the Eastern Bank. 2e How the Eastern Bank came to be such Imbeciles as to quarrel with what were then C.A.S^OeC. over their rates I cannot imagine, as most of the profit went in Excess Profits Tax, but the trouble clearly took place after August - September 1941 as I met Ohliger then and found him perfectly happy with all his Bahrain facilities, and must have occured during my deputation to Cairo. I did not hear anything about it from the Political Agent on my return, but it was soon clear to me that there was a coolness between the parties and I thought it might be due to the exorbitant rates the Eastern Bank were then charging. I took up the question of their rates but got little satisfaction and then determined to bring in the Imperial Bank of Iran, with the results that you know. The latter are a much better and stronger bank and will be very useful to us, and their own position will be greatly improved by being on both sides of the Gulf. 3. The Arabian Oil Company have evidently some ulterior motive in trying to keep the Eastern Bank off the mainland and their objection to Han^s Jewish Head Clerk is ridiculous, in fact Ohliger himself is a Jew I It Is however disturbing to see that the Eastern Bank propose to take a year in opening, and by that time much of the advantage will have been lost. I do not regard an American bank on the mainland as nearly so dangerous as one in i v / Bahrain, R.T.

He thought the State would lose heavily as much material was then going through to Saudi Arabia f and that the latter i»ould ultimately develop their facilities at Has Tanurah whatever was done# I think it would pay Bahrain in the long run to give up the transit duties and establish a free port| as they would only lose a lakh or a lakh and a half f and they already have ample income from the oil.

CONCERNING THE NEW BRANCH BEING CPENSD BY IMPERIAL BANK OF IRAN AT BAHRAIN. The Olio wing is a copy of the AirgrapHr^ ' ' My dear Ham, The news telegraphed by you that the Imperial Bttuk ^ of Iran are preparing to open in Bahrain a nd have actually obtained official permission to do so, c^me as a disconcert ing surprise to us in London, in discussion with their General Manager immediately after receiving the information. I learned that 'their representative, Mr, lyere (Taiyers) visited Bahrain recently for the purpose of making enquiries with a view to opening a Branch and has since gone to India to recruit staff, purchase stationery etc. I should be interested to know when he visited Bahrain, wi-^th whom he stayed there and why his presence for such a purpose was not known and reported to us before. The General Manager of the Imperial Bank of Iran expressed the hope that our respective Managers (when their) Branch opened) would be good friends socially althou^i competitors in business. This is something which I must leave in your hands r but what hurts us most is 'the evidence that in war time they can spare the ataff for what we regard as an enroachBent on our territory vshilst we. awing to the release of personnel for war services, find the greatest difficulty in providing the staff for our legitimate needs. Please telegraph us immediately if and when you hear that the -Imperial Bank of Iran are about to open.' 9/44 /teriltopy but for the protection of your own connect ions in Badirain as well as the development of rooten- tialities in Arabia, our Directors wish to take action before' competit^brs step in.

Sir Geoffrey is of opinion that the trade Dooii which has been flourishing in these ports during the past three years is due entirely to the War and the resultant olack marKet and that it will dwindle when conditions return to normal. He pointed out that it was possioxe that Lingah would become a free port after the War and this would greatly affect the trade of Dubai, as imports for Iran would then pass through the former port. At the same time he indicated that, as the present prosperity of Dubai was closely connected with Iranian trade, The Imperial Bank of Iran would ue able to handle the business from Banrain. In view oi the above I am not taking any further steps to visit Dubai at present. Should the oil companies start work on tne Trucial Coast however, the situation should be reviewed again. Sir Geoffrey then brought up the question oi our competitor and informed me confidentially that he decided two years ago that tnere should be another bank in Bahrain. This decision was arrived at after a discussion he had with some of the leading merchants here in October 1^42. ne assured me that no other bank would be allowed to open here within ten years irom now.

The position appears to be that our competitor will be unable to ship cash from miia and will have to obtain his requirements by selling Indian funis to bazaar merchants, thereoyx increasing tne demand for money, we ^o not think this will be well received oy merchants here, our policy is to endeavour to maintain rates within reasonable limits, which helps to keep the market in a healthy slate. As regards foreign exchange, merchants will now be able to get their requirements from us at Control rates provided shipping space has been san ctioned by The Government of India and approved by the reserve Bank of India. This arrangement has been achieved through the efforts of this t bank and merchants have expressed their apprecia tion of the help we have given them in this connection.
