The scales of pay for the first and second munshis approved by your letter under reference have been increased ^ by fifty per cent on cost of living grounds (India Office letter P 2772 of the 7th August 1923 etc_. ) 3. The statement in paragraph 4 of Sir H.Clive’s despatch that the cost of living has increased by thirty five per cent since the present total salaries were sanctioned, is open to question but the Secretary of State nevertheless considers that there is a case for the grant of further increments to the munshis. He does not consider however that it is necessary to grant such large immediate increases as proposed by sir R.Clive.

In view of the many requests doth for increased salaries and for alterations to buildings which I have of late been compelled to submit to you, I was reluctant to make further demands, although important economies have been effected in other directions. X was the less dis posed to support the Uunshis 1 request in that I was by no means convinced that their emoluments were insufficient. Careful enquiry has however satisfied me that their petition is justified# 3. Comparison with other foreign missions is diffi cult in that their - 'usually only - liunshi fulfills the duties of a dragoman, and is correspondingly highly paid I have, however, ascertained that the second iTunshi to the Soviet Embassy, who have an Oriental secretary, '^JorvUXm4 receives a salary of ifcnami one hundred and fifty per men sem, while a reference to the Ministry for Foreigpi Afiairg has revealed the fact that officials of the same age, and holding the rank to which our TTanshis mi^it be assumed to Right Honourable Sir Austen Chamberlain, K#0#, M#P#, The Foreign Office.1 \ / - 2 - to have attained, receive a salary of Krona 124o - 1440 per mensem in so far as the First and second },lunshis are con- % cerned while the Third sionshi v/ould he earning Krans 920 - 1020 per mensem* They would moreover each receive one month 1 s leave a year, and would be qualifying for a pension at the rate of one sixtieth of their salary for each year of service* 4. It will further be remembered that since their oresent salaries were sanctioned the cost of living has gone un by some 85$ t and in order to meet this fact the general level of the salaries earned by officials in the service of the Persian Government has been considerably raised. 5 . I am satisfied therefore that on increase in salary is both warranted and essential, and I have the honour to submit the following proposals to s&amp;iich you will, I trust, accord youi* full support, since they constitute in my opinion, the minimum wage that the Mimshis should be earning* An immediate increase os from July 1st next to the following scale First llunehi 1400 Krens per mensem.

Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to refer to your letter P.3299/25 of the 17th November, 1925 and to transmit herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, copies of two despatches which have been received from His Majesty^ Minister at Tehran, requesting authority for the engagement of two additional ferrashes and for a general increase in the wages of the menial staff at His Majesty^ legation. 2. It will be seen that Sir E« Clive has engaged an additional ferrash and requests authority to engage a second additional ferrash, in order to reduce the number of working hours from seventy-four hours a week, which is considered excessive, to sixty-six hours, and to enable a ferrash to be employed continually on duty at the telephone. 3. Sir E. Clive further recommends an immediate general increase in the wages of the menial staff, on the ground that they are inadequately paid and are discontented, and also the provision of good service increments after six years’ service. 4. In this connexion Sir E. Clive has pointed out that for some months the ferrashes have been paid less than a living wage, and a telegram has just been received stating that from subsequent enquiries which he nas m^de, it has been ascertained that the menial staff are more heavily in debt than he supposed, and are being compelled to sell their clothes. With three exceptions these servants have been fa the service of the legation for upwards of fourteen years,If*' ' r f 'w- p JP;, and most of tiiem have not less than three dependents. 5. It will he observed that His Majesty^ Minister proposes certain reductions of staff and that the resulting savings will more than cover the increased expenditure involved by his proposals. 6. The Secretary of State considers that these proposals are most reasonable, and I am accordingly to request that you will move the Secretary of State for India in Council to approve, with effect from the 1st January 1929, (1) the employment of two additional ferrashes at a wage ins 180 of one hundred and eighty krans per month, each, (2) the increase in the wages of the servants to the rates proposed in column ( B ) of the enclosure II to Tehran despatch Ho.11 of the 4th January 1929, and (3) the provision of increments, to be granted or withheld at the discretion of His Majesty’s Minister, at the fws lo rate of ten krans per month after six, twelve and eighteen years' service from the 1st January 1929, the first increments to be payable as from the 1st January 1935. 7.

It will be apparent to you that my proposals are nothing more in fact than a redistribution of work. It is not impossible that I may find myself able to dispense with the four remaining Indian orderlies or at any rate with two of them. I am, however, not at present in a position to make such a recommendation, as it seems not impossible that these orderlies may again be called upon to escort the mail between Tehran and Baghdad. 7* To sum up, and apart from the further reductions adumbrated in the preceding paragraph, those I am now reoomcmnding cover the additional expenditure involved in the proposals made at the beginning of this despatch, and indeed leave a slight margin. In this connection it is not irrelevant to remind you that since November 1925 when the present scale of wages was approved in your deap So. 592 (X 7694/602/503) the annual cost of this Uission haw1 i * r - 3 - yi, &gt;+*** .

I shall in this despat oh confine myself to the first of these questions, and submit my recommendations in the second in ay ianediately following despatch* 2 * lliere are, as you are aware, at present six ferrashes in this Legation, two of whoa are continually on duty with the Vice Consulate and oriental Chancery which are in separate buildings and some way from the chancery proper and &amp; third at the Dispensary. This leaves three men for the main office* 3, The increased efficiency of the town Telephone system has naturally resulted in a large amount oi work, previously transacted by letter, being dealt with dn the Telephone. Although this fact enables rae to propose the reduction by two of the Indian orderlies the result is that it is now necessary to keep one f err ash continually on duty at the telephone, leaving two only to compete with i;ha official needs of the office in other respects* This pro vision is entirely inade&lt;i*urt«. even if the necessity for allowing them a certain time off in the weejc is Left out of account* It must moreover not be forgotten that there are long passages and all the rooms to be kept clean, fires to be looked after and last but not least some twenty five ^ lamps v 's ^Skt Honourable A *sten Chamberlain K.G., M.P.* The Foreign Offioe*956 -2- amp» to bo oleanoft anft fillod every day. I have accordingly found it neoesoary to anthorise he engagement as fro* January let of an extra ferraah, at ;he ainimura rate at present authorised and trust you wilfree ?*it to approve this* 5 It is always a matter of some difficulty to “bring 3 ut in a despatch the necessity for an increase of staff. In this particular case however that difficulty con ho overcome by merely quoting the number of working hours which ere done by the ferrashes per week. I rould here emphasise that the engagement of the ferrash mentioned in the preceding paragraph will not enable me to effect a reduction in their hours of work* At/present moment the ferrashes have two afternoon* off por week, and one vfcole day every three weeks, fhls cannot be described as a generous allowance, and leaves t** with, at'a conservative estimate, a seventy four hour week as they arrive at the office about seven a.m. and leave it when it closes about eight p.m. or later. With «n* ferrash. making five for the Chancery proper and telephone and leaving one each for the Oriental Chancery and the Vie. Consulate and the Dispensary, it would be possible to reduce the week to sixty six hours. This though by no Ught can I think he regarded as reasonable and . according y have the honour to urge that I mey ae given aut-oiity to engage one more mtn for this work at the miaimom rate. 6 . I have at the beginning of this despatch intimated my intention of addressing you on the que.tion of wages. It neither the additional Is perhaps useful tpaention/ StaffA 356 -3- Staff asked for atoore, nor the increased wages which I am recommending, will result in greater expense to His Majesty Government in view of certain reductions which I shall propose in my immediately following despatch I have the honour to he with the highest respect, Sir, Yo\ir most obedient! huable Senraat!

' A \ / S1/\iJ 1 Jj, Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Chamberlain to refer to your letter of the 7th August, 1923 (P.2772) and to state that His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has made application for increases of the wages of the official servants at His Majesty’s Legation on the grounds that their present wages do not in many cases provide the barest subsistence. 2. Sir P. Loraine states that the servants have repeatedly submitted petitions for the increase of their wages and that, in order to restore the contented sor - '. ^ce which he regards as the principal safeguard against attempts to tamper with their fidelity, he considers it essential that the increases shown in the enclosed schedules should be granted as from the 1st ultimo. 3. In the case of the ghulams. Sir P* Loraine proposes that long and meritorious as distinct from merely satisfactory service should he rewarded by tne grant of increments of ten krans a month after six, twelve and eighteen years' service, such increments to be awarded and forfeited at His Majesty's Minister's discretion. 0\ 4. The Secretary oi sua^e &lt;A f ant of increments would prove an incentive to tne ^ft?Mt^aintenance of a high standard of efficiency ana discipline, but in view of the fact that six of ghulams ^ Uhder-Secretary of State, India Office.ghulams have already qualified for these increments, he is of opinion that the 'basic rate of pay should not be increased beyond two hundred and thirty-five krans a month instead of two hundred and fifty krans a month as was originally proposed by Sir loraine. 5* In order to meet the cost of these increases, amounting to two hundred and seventy-three krans a month in the case of the servants and to four hundred and twenty krans a month in the case of the ghulams, Sir P* loraine has agreed that the ghulam establishment should be reduced from twelve to ten (including the Mir Akhor) on the understanding that the Indian Escort is not reduced below a strength of nine* 6. The establishment of ghulams is at present one below strength and the further reduction of one will be effected as soon as possible, when the net result will be an appreciable saving in the cost of the servants at His Majesty^ legation. 7. I am, therefore, to request that you will move the Secretary of State for India in Council to sanction the increases of wages as indicated above as a permanent arrangement. 8.

Sir, (tois. £4. i With reference to your letter (P.1298) of April 6th last relative to the wages of the servants employed at His Llajesty 1 s Legation at Teheran, I am directed hy Earl Curzon of Kedleston to transmit herewith, copy of a despatch from His iiajesty's 1-inis ter at Teheran, in which Llr. Herman recommends that the bonus of fifty per cent at present paid to the servants should be confirmed as a permanent measure and be compounded with the present scale of wages, the whole to form the permanent monthly wage of the servants. 2. It appears from Iv'f . Herman’s despatch that the minimum living wage for a man c^nd his family in Teheran is considered to be twenty four tomans a month. In view of this and having regard to the present rates of pay of the Legation Servants, Lord Curzon is of opinion that the re uest put forward by His Majesty’s Minister is reason able and should be acceded to with effect from October 1st next. 3. I am to request therefore that ar. Secretary ^ontagu ■ will agree to the proposal, 4. A similar letter has been addressed to the Treasury. .:e . &gt;F,.

Ly Lord, with roisrencG to Your Lordohip’s telegram Uo. 72 of the 8th February last, and to Sir Percy Cox^ telegram Ko. 276 of the 15th lay 1920, I have the honoia* to report thu.t there does not appear, at present, to he any probability of a decrease in prices L at Tehran. oot commodities have, on the contrary, become increasingly scarce and expensive, and as long ao economic conditions in Kusoia remain as they are at present, and shortage of transport prevails in this country, there is little hope of an improvement of prices in ilorth Persia. The \mgea of all menials have conse uently had to bo increased. As an example I would quote the recent increase granted to members of the police force, whose wage has been raised from 14 to 24 tomans a month, the latter sum being now considered the minimum living wage -or a nan and his family, which compares favourably with tae wage of the Legation gholams, who are receiving at present 22 tomans in all per month. This sum includes the temporary 50/ bonus and a temporary extra allowance 4 tomano a month in lieu of travelling allowance received by them as couriers, before the war; the actual being only 12 tomans. Other Legation servants, receive less. I have the honour, therefore, to request that Your.. honourable Cli **zon 0 f Kedleston, K.G.,■' i, Your Lordship will be so good as to confirm as a permanent measure the present 50, bonus, and that sanction may be accorded for it to be compounded with \ the present scale of wages, the whole to form the permanent monthly wage accorded to Legation servants. I should explain that Your Lordship*s telegram UO 9 440 of August 25th last arrived in a corrupt condition which made it appear that I was to expect a despatch from you on this subject. The fact accounts for the last sentence of my telegram $ 0 . 110 of the 15th of last month. I have etc., (Signed) H. Lorman.t '' **' i * ' - I !li r 1790/34).
