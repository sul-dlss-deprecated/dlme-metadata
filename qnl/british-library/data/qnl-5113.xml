I have to inform you that the sum of &lt;£1,528. 2.2, as shown in the enclosed statement, has been received from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in respect thereof cmd for the cost of the telegrams regarding the engagement of Mr. Scott on survey work. As regards Captain A.T.

Moreover since the claim was preferred on the Company the Comptroller has notified a further charge of Rs.40, in respect of Captain Wilson's travelling allowance bill forfor the period 1st to 25th September 1909.

ESTABLISHMENT* The Right Hon’ble VISCOUNT MORLEY oe BLACKBURN, O.M., Mis Majesty's Secretary of State for India* SlMtiA, the 28th July 1910. Mt Lord, In reply to Your Lordship’s despatch No. 114 (Political), dated the 5th November 1909, regarding the amount recoverable from the Anglo- Persian Oil Company in connection with the employment of the Indian Guard for the oil works in the neighbourhood of Ahwaz, we have the honour to forward a copy of the letter cited in the From the First Assistant Resident in charge . i • i current duties, Uushire Residency, No. 173, dated margin, from Which it Will 06 OOSeiVeU leth January 1910, with enclosure. that, although Lieutenant Wilson was appointed temporarily as His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Mobammerah with effect from the 25th July 1909, he continued to perform the duties of officer in charge of the guard up to the 25th Septemfer 1909. His absence from Ahwaz, from time to time, was largely in the interests of the Oil Company and no objections were raised to his absence by the Company’s local represent atives. 2. We are of opinion that a fair arrangement would be that the Com pany should defray the cost of the salary and allowances of Lieutenant Wilson and the 8 cavalrymen and 12 infantrymen of the guard for the period from the 18th January 1909, the date from which the Company agreed to bear the cost of the guard, as intimated to us in Your Lordship’s telegram dated the 28th January 1909, to the 25th September 1909, the date on which the mam portion of the guard left Ahwaz for India. 3. As regards Lieutenant Banking, it will be seen from the correspond, ence ending with Your Lordship’s despatch No. 104 (Political), dated the22nd October 1909, that the Company are not liable for any charges on account of his salary and allowances. We hare the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’a most obedient, humble servants, k, 5No. 173, dated Bushire, the 16th January 1910. Prom— Major A. P. Trevor, I.A., First Assistant Resident, in charge of Residency, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the letter from the Goyernment of India in the Foreign Department, No. 4242-Est. B., dated the 21st December 1909, forwarding a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Secre tary of State for India, No. 111-Political, dated the 5th November 1909, regard ing the amount recoverable from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in connec tion with the employment of the Indian guard for the oil works in the neigh bourhood of Ahwaz ; and, in accordance with the instructions contained in paragraph 1 of the letter, to forward, for the information of Government, a copy of the marginally cited letter in which His Majesty’s Acting Consul, Mohammerah, explains his position and No. s, dated 8th January i9io. duti es when he held charge of the Indian guard. 2. So far as Lieutenant Wilson is concerned, I think that his explanation furnishes a categorical answer to Mr. Wallace’s remarks, which, in the light of that explanation, seem somewhat uncalled for. Lieutenant Wilson’s salary ceased to he debited to advances ^recoverable from the D’Arcy Oil Syndicate, with effect from the 1st August 1909 ; and that of Lieutenant Banking with effect from the 1st September 1908. Lieute nant Wilson took charge of His Majesty’s Consulate at Mohammerah on the 24th July 1909 'P.M.) ; and Lieutenant Banking was transferred from Ahwaz on the 6th June 1908. 3. As regards the Indian guard: with the exception of the four men retained as Lieutenant Wilson’s personal escort, all the others left Mohammerah on the 25th September, but the pay of all the men was debited to advances recoverable from the D’Arcy Oil Syndicate, up to and inclusive of 30th September 1909. No. 8, dated Mohammerah, the 8th January 1910. Prom— Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, I.A., Acting Consul for Arahistan, To— The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. With reference to your endorsement No. 41 of 6th January 1910, I have the honour to state that the Indian Oil Guard, with the exception of four men, left Mohammerah on the 25th September, arriving Karachi, 30th September. They were paid up to the latter date. 2. The four men retained as my personal escort are still in Ahwaz. 3. As regards Mr. Wallace’s letter to the Under-Secretary of State for India, it w ill doubtless be possible to ascertain from the Treasury Officer, Bushire, the date on which Lieutenant Banking’s pay ceased to be ^ debited to &lt;£ Advances Becoverable from D’Asrcy Oil Syandicate and was debited instead t 0 “ 25—Political Agencies and Other Foreign Services.” 4. As regards Mr. Wallace’s remarks regarding my own position and duties, I was not &lt;£ transferred from Ahwaz in May 1909, but I was appointed Acting Consul for Arabistan at Mohammerah with effect from 24th July (p.m.) after I had been about three weeks at Mohammerah waiting to take over fiom Mr. McDouall. 5. Mr Wallace’s statement that I was only at Ahwaz for a portion of the time, being occupied with surveys, etc., in Arabistan and the Bakhtian country is correct, but I remained at all times in command of the guard, return ing every few days to look after them, and remained at all times wholly respon sible for them. My continued presence was in no way necessary and no untoward event occurred in consequence of my absence. I left the guard alone for short periods with a full sense of my respon sibility in doing so, and in the conviction that in the interests of the Govern ment of India and of the Oil Company it was desirable that I should make use 2701 F. D.2 of my leisure and unique opportunities to study the country thoroughly and Ivcy TTnstead of wasting my time sitting in camp m command of 20 men a duty which the Sergeant in charge was fully capable of perfo S' bring at no time after the first few months any reason to apprehend trouble with the natives. 6 Not only did thfe Oil Company’s local representatives at no time raise the slightest obiection to my absence but they continually made use of the knowledge I had acquired and made further suggestions as to future enquiries on my part- The following few examples of enquiries undertaken by me in connection with the Oil Company’s work will illustrate my points. (a) Road from X)eh Luran in Pusht-i-Kuk to Ahwaz. lb) Pipe line route from oil wells to Abbadan. (c) Abhadan Island. (d) Survey of Arabistan and Bakhtiari country, south of hills. The only existing map of the country is that made by me, copies of which have been supplied to the Company and to the Directors, although the map is confidential. Their engineers and geologists have frequently told me that their task has been enormously facilitated by the existence of this map. The selection of a site on Abbadan Island was made on information supplied by me, and the map of the site made by me is still the only one extant. 7. Under the circumstances, therefore, I think that the Oil Company ha\ e no ridit to claim a rebate on account of my salary, as my temporary absence in no way interfered with the duties for which I was detailed and for which they were paying, hut on the contrary assisted the operations and development of the Company in no small degree.

Subject to the concurrence of Secretary Sir E. Grey, Viscount Morley proposes to approve the proceedings of the Government of India, the effect of which will be to relieve the Anglo-Persian Oil Company of a charge of approximately Rs. 718 a month in respect of Lieutenant Ranking’s salary from the 18th January last, when the Syndicate became chargeable with the cost of the Oil Guard, till the 31st March last, and to impose a corresponding charge on British and Indian revenues, together with a charge for Lieutenant Ranking’s travelling allowance while on deputation to India, the amount of which has so far not been reported.

I have the honour to address you on the subject of the Sepoys recently stationed at Ahwaz. I have been informed by the Eoreign Office that the men left Mohammerah on the 25th September, and I presume that the Indian Government will now be preparing a bill against this Company for their pay from the date on which the Government intended to remove them from Ahwaz (17th January 1909) to the date to which the Government kindly consented to leave them at Ahwaz. I have not been informed of this date, but it is presumably some where between the 17th and 25th September 1909, so there would appear to be about eight months due by this Company to the Government. The monthly cost of the Guard was estimated to be 174L 8s., but I understand that this included the pay of Lieutenants Wilson and Ranking who were originally in charge. I would call your attention, however, to the fact that Lieutenant Ranking was transferred from Ahwaz in 1908 and Lieutenant Wilson in May 1909. I am also informed that up to May 1909 Lieutenant Wilson though nominally in charge of the Guard at Ahwaz was in point of fact only at Ahwaz during about 25 per cent, of his time, the remainder of his time being occupied in surveying and other duties on behalf of the Government. I am calling your attention to these facts in order to avoid the possibility of their being overlooked when the Bill comes to be made out, and, consequently, of my having to apply for its correction.

The Syndicate will gladly avail themselves of any advice which Captain Lorimer may give them for the due working of this arrangement, and naturally will in no way hold him responsible for it.

Sirdar Mohtasham and Sirdar Bahadur have approached him through the Syndicate’s doctor with a view to arranging for the Syndicate to take over management and payment of the guards, a portion of the guard money payable to the ETans being allotted to the Syndicate for a loan. Captain Lorimer being unable to do so, he has arranged for the Manager and doctor to visit the Khans with a view to drawing up an Agreement. Captain Lorimer questions the ultimate sincerity of the Khans, who seem to be temporarily desirous of British good-will, and also the likelihood of satisfactoiy final arrangement; moreover, he doubts whether the Syndicate will be able to under take the management of the guard. A , , The issue of the proposal probably may be determined by the Sirdar Assad, wJio is expected on the spot shortly from France.

Sir, Stanmore Hall, Stanmore, January 12, 1909. WITH reference to your letter dated the 6th instant, we greatly regret the decision which His Majesty’s Government has come to, the more so as it would appear from the telegrams published in the public press, more especially during the last fortnight, that the necessity for safeguarding British interests in southern Persia now, as compared with the time when it was first decided to locate a guard there, is not less but greater. Also, seeing that the time is not yet, although it is now approximate, for forming a Joint-stock Company which could be called upon to pay for or towards the upkeep of the guard, and that consequently we shall have to add this expenditure to our other already heavy expenditure while we are getting nothing out of the country in return, the decision detailed in your letter now under reply bears very hardly upon us. But we dare not under present conditions take upon our shoulders the responsibility of keeping a large staff of Englishmen in Persia without a guard, and I am therefore to inform you that while earnestly begging the Government to maintain the guard at the public expense for, say, three months from now, we will refund to His Majesty’s Government its contribution to the cost of the guard from such time as it feels unable to continue this contribution.

SINCE the accompanying letter was drafted, I have received and I thank you for your Office letter dated the 11th instant. The fact that His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has sent a second telegram on the subject emphasizes what I had occasion to write to you on the 28th December, 1908, and again under yesterday’s date, in support of our plea that the Indian guard may be retained for, at all events, three months without our being made to^ pay towards its cost. I say three months, because I anticipate that within that period a Joint-stock Company will have been formed to work the Concession, and to so put an end to the heavy expenses that we are meantime having to provide ourselves. With reference to the first part of your letter now under reply, I am not quite sure whether the monthly sum that you name covers the entire cost of the guard, or only the British Government’s contribution thereto. I assume that the Indian Govern ment pays a share of the cost, and has not refused to continue to do so. 174/. 8s., or 8,616 rupees per month, looks like the entire cost of the guard, but we understand that the Home Government alone objects to maintain the present arrange ments in their entirety, and that consequently we are asked only to refund its contribution.

At the end _ of six months, owing to the continued disturbed condition of Persia it was felt that it could not safely be withdrawn ; but steps were taken to determine the period of its retention, and to arrive at a satisfactory solution as to the incidence of the resulting cost.

Half the cost of the return journey to India will eventually become payable from the Imperial Exchequer. I am to add that it has been with considerable reluctance that the Oil Syndicate have agreed to bear the future cost of the guard ; and, in these circumstances, Sir E.

In reply to your letter No. 43832 of the 17th instant, I have now had an opportunity of consulting the chief among the parties interested with me in de veloping the Persian Oilfields. I regret the delay, hut it was difficult to see some of them at this sea- son of the year. Before the Government comes to a decision adverse to the retention of the guard at its own cost and that of India, I would ask you to consider the following. We desire at once to admit that as between the Government of His Imperial Majesty The Shah of Persia and the Governments of Great Britain and India it is the duty of the first named rather than of the latter to furnish all the necessary guards at its own expense as provided by the Concession granted to me by the Persian Government. But it is matter of common knowledge that when we came into contact with the Bakhtiari people, and these stopped ie Right Honourable Sir Charles Hardinge, G.C.M.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c..stopped the works which under the Concession uoove referred to we had every right to pursue, the Gov ernment of His Imperial Majesty tne Shan was, anc is, absolutely incapable of enforcing its authority over the Bakhtiaris. We therefore sent out an Emissary, Mr. J. Preece, a British ex-Consul in Persia. The stop page of our work, with a large number of Europeans sitting idle in Persia, itself involved us in very heavy expense. In addition to this we paid the cost of Mr. Preece’s mission, and, when he succeeded in making terms with the Chiefs on the spot of the Bakhtiari Tribe, we paid (and are paying) blackmail to them for permission to do that which we submit we have a perfect right to do without let or inter ference, and, above all, we are bearing the very heavy loss caused by the stoppage of our work in the consequently delayed formation of the Company which it is our intention to form at an early date to develop the Petroleum Industry in Persia. For obvious reasons there was nothing to be gained by our attempting to formulate a claim on thethe Persian Government, still less of course can there he any claim on the British Government in respect of the above items. But we trust that the latter will take into con sideration, before coming to a decision on the ques-. tion of the Sepoy Guard now at issue, that we have suffered and are bearing these heavy expenses and loss, we who are endeavouring to develop and have already met with marked success in laying the foundation of this new Industry - an Industry to be worked entirely by British initiative, in British hands, and by Brit ish Capital, and one which we have every reason to be lieve should be looked upon with favour if not indul gence by the British Government, since it may in the near future become a source of valuable fuel for our Navy. Y/e would therefore earnestly beg of His Majesty’s Government to maintain at the public cost this Guard, # / whose necessity and presence have been justified hith erto by events, and whose retention on public grounds, as you are good enough to inform us in your letter now under reply, is advocated both by Captain Lorrimer and LieutenantLieutenant Wilson. We also Leg leave to point out with the greatest respect that if any catastrophe, or violence on the part of the trioes/nen, should re sult as a consequence of the withdrawal of the Guard, it might lead to a very much more serious national expenditure and to serious action on the part of the Government - for after all we are British subjecus not only pursuing lawful objects in Persia, but do-, ing so with the express sanction of the Persian Gov ernment . Finally, it has been suggested to us that if the Government is unwilling to use the relatively small amount of public funds required by the reten tion of the Guard protecting important British In- terests, a protection rendered necessary by the physi cal inability of the Government of His Imperial Maj esty the Shah to carry out its obligations in this connection, the Government might not unreasonably instruct its representative in Teheran to request that the cost of the Guard be reimbursed by the Per sian Government.

This officer, while allowing that the natives at the present scene of operations are now better disposed and trouble is accordingly unlikely, agrees with Captain Lorimer, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, that the continuance of the Khans in their present attitude is uncertain, and he considers that if boring were begun at any new place, or if the laying of pipe lines were undertaken, the same difficulties would be encountered as before.

Grey your letter of the 6tk instant relative to the proposed increase of the Consular guards at Ispahan and Ahwaz. With regard to Ispahan, I am to state, for the information of the Lords Commis sioners of His Majesty’s Treasury, that Sir E. Grey considers the proposed increase to he necessary for the protection of the Consulate and Consular staff, and that, in view of the fact that their Lordships sanction the proposal subject to this condition, he has requested the Secretary of State for India to take the necessary steps to send the reinforcements. # With regard to Ahwaz, I am to transmit copies of further telegrams from His Majesty’s Consul at that place showing that the proposed increase is urgently required. * I am also to inclose copy of a further letter from the India Office,! from which it will be seen that the Government of India now propose to send an infantry guard with eight mounted men instead of cavalry, which would reduce the expenditure from 533/. 6s. Sd. to 266/. 135. 4d. initial, and from 1,920/. per annum to 1,824/. per annum recurring. Sir E. Grey has throughout the present disturbed state of affairs in Persia declined to adopt the policy of sending expeditions inland for the protection of British subjects, and has caused the latter to be warned that in case of danger they must proceed to the coast. It is not denied that the principal object of increasing the Ahwaz guard is to protect the lives of the employes and the property of the Oil Syndicate, but the case appears to Sir E. Grey to be exceptional. Ahwaz is easily accessible from the river, and a small expenditure, half of which will be borne by the Government of India, will, it is hoped, prevent the total abandon ment of an important British enterprise, with the great loss of British prestige throughout Persia which it would entail. In view of the above considerations, I am to express the earnest hope that their Lordships will reconsider their decision and sanction half the expenditure incurred in the dispatch of the guards and their maintenance for a period of six months.

Grey is of opinion that, in view of the menacing attitude of the population of Ispahan, reported by His Majesty’s Consul-General at that place, it is urgently necessary to take adequate steps for the protection of the lives and property of Eritish subjects there, who number more than forty, and that His Majesty’s Government would be incurring a grave responsibility were they to neglect to adopt Mr. Barnham’s recommendations. With regard to the necessity of the proposed increase at Ahwaz, I am to draw the especial attention of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury to Sir C. Spring-Rice’s despatch No. 209 of the 13th September, from which it is clear that the lives of British subjects and the valuable property of the Oil Syndicate in the neighbourhood of that place may at any moment be exposed to serious danger, and that the only alternative policy to adequate protection would be the complete with drawal of the employes from Persia—a course which would be attended with disastrous results to British prestige—apart from the material losses which would be incurred. With regard to the inquiry contained in the third paragraph of your letter, I am to state (1) that the present guard at Ispahan consists of eight men, that at Ahwaz of twelve : (2) that it is now proposed to send twelve additional men to Ispahan and twenty additional men with two officers to Ahwaz; and (B) that the figures given in the letter from this Department of the 22nd instant represent the gross cost of the proposed increase. With regard to the last paragraph of your letter, I am to state that, in spite of the Anglo-Russian Convention, which makes no provision for the reciprocal protection of the lives and property of British and Russian subjects, the disturbed state of Persia makes it impossible for the present to contemplate any reduction of the British Consular establishments there, and in support of this view it is only necessary to point to the cases of Ispahan and Ahwaz, in which an increase is considered necessary. When, however, tranquillity and order have been restored in the country, Sir E. Grey will gladly welcome the reduction of the Consular guards, and he trusts that this desirable situation may not be long deferred. I am to add that, in view of the explanations afforded above. Sir E. Grey earnestly hopes that their Lordships will consent to the proposals now before them. I am, &amp;c, (Signed) LOTUS MALLET. [October BO.] Section 2. * Sir 0.

Foreign Office, October 22, 1907. I AM directed by Secretary Sir E. Grey to state, for the information of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, that he has been in consultation with Mr. Secretary Morley respecting the situation at Ispahan and Ahwaz, and that he has arrived at the decision that it is necessary, in view of the disturbed state of affairs at those places, to increase the Consular guards. The Russian Government have already raised the number of their Consular guard at Ispahan. At Ahwaz an increase in the British Consular guard is essential with a view to the protection of the British subjects engaged in prospecting for oil in the neighbourhood, an undertaking which, it is hoped, will open up a wide field for British enterprise. In these circumstances I am to express the earnest hope that you will move the Lords Commissioners to sanction the payment of one-half of the estimated expenditure, which is stated to be 268?. initial and 580?. a-year recurring on account of Ispahan, and 533?. 6s. 8d. initial and 1,920?. a-year recurring on behalf of Ahwaz. In the case of Ahwaz the sums quoted are exclusive of transport charges. In view of the critical situation in the localities in question, I am to request that a reply may be returned to this letter as soon as possible. I am to add that these increases should not be regarded as permanent. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) LOUIS MALLET.

Communication with Bushire from ionammerah is not possible by vire at present except vi&amp; Constantinople, so I write instead of wiring. 1 think Lorimer’s reply and the Syndicate’s maybe both correct without being: mutually contradictory. The Syndicate, I take it, consider that the presence of Indian oil guards at Maidan Minaftun is not now necessary. With that view 1 deliberately concur. The people as well as the Khans are fairly well-disposed to the Company and not likely to cause trouble at Maidan Minaftun. Lorimer, I believe, considers that the guard should be retained in order that it may be utilized should the Company commence operations at Deh Luran, Behbahan or elsewhere; he also is not convinced that the Khans will remain in their present trame of mind—apparently an abnormal one. I fully agree with him. I have travelled extensively over the whole country from Dizful to Behbahan and from Mohammerah to tlmdian, and I believe that, should boring operations be commenced at a new place, obstacles will be met with similar to those encountered at Mamatain, i.e., popular opposition fostered by the avarice of local Chiefs, and that the presence of an Indian oil guard will be almost essential. p ^ e J nolds come s out again as manager shortly, I believe, and until we hear whether he proposes to commence borings elsewhere than at Maidan Minaftun, I think that, for this reason alone, decision should be deferred. The laying of the pipe will be a big business, and local opposition may be aroused in P^ces whither the Oil Company have not yet penetrated, but which will be traversed by the line.

For this reason als^ de^y inadeciding ts^advisahle. eventually to fend for themselves, hut meanwhile, until things are more developed, I consider that the guard should be retamed, not for present, but for future necessities. ....... , So much for the guard, qud guard ; it remains to consider rts position as my escort As YOU are no doubt aware, I have been so confident that no untoward event would occur at Maidan Minaftun that I have left most of the escort there alone, and myself with three or four men spent twenty-five days m each month travelling all over the country mapping and reporting, and have visited practice ly every town, village and valley within 100 miles of darn. I am gradually extending my work on these lines, and last month was able to penetrate the unknown Kuhgalu country. Next spring I shall be able to enter the Kuhgalu country again and reconnoitre it thoroughly. The opening up of relations with the Kuhgalus may, or may not, be of importance but it is a task for which His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul tor Arabistan will find it difficult to obtain time. He has to cover an enormous area, and move with a large caravan, the latter a serious obstacle in the Kuhgalu country. If therefore Government think this work—partly geographical, partly politica, partly military in its scope—worth continuing, and if they wish it to remain m my charge, they i^ay consider it an additional reason for retaining the escort, at all events, till the end of next summer (1909). i If it is the 100/. which is bothering them, let the question of housing be shelved till 1909, when it may be conveniently raised again. I inclose an official letter to facilitate this solution, should you desire to adopt it ; if not, please destroy. If any men of the escort get sickly I shall send them to India at once, so there need be no anxiety on the score of their health, and the heat affects me less than i Lorimer goes on leave at the beginning of next year, and it would be a pity if his departure synchronized with that of the guard. I have sent a copy of this letter to Lorimer. Yours sincerely, (Signed) A. T. WILSOh. P.S.—If a compromise on the question of the escort is necessary, could you not leave the officers and the cavalry (eight), and transfer the infantry (twelve) to Bunder Abbas ?

Section 14. [32484] No. 1. Sir C. Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received September 30.) (No. 209.) _ Gulahek, September 13, 1907. I HAVE already drawn your attention, in my telegram No. 253 of the 10th instant,, to the grave situation in which the European'employes of the Oil Syndicate find themselves owing to the aggressive attitude of the tribesmen in the neighbourhood of the borings, the utter failure of the Bakhtiari guards to afford them adequate protection, and the dilatoriness of the Bakhtiari Chiefs in administering punishment, and then only under the strongest pressure, to the authors of the various outrages committed in the last few months. I now have the honour to transmit copy of a report on the subject which I have received from His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Abwaz. Captain Lorimer has had a long experience of the temper of the tribesmen and of local conditions. I feel convinced that he would not adopt the pessimistic tone which inspires his despatch without good reason, and that he has not exaggerated the dangers of the situation. I cannot, therefore, help regarding with grave apprehension the possibility of a renewed and more serious outbreak by which the lives of British subjects and the valuable property of the Oil Syndicate in those regions would be threatened with destruction, and the creation of a situation in which decisive action on the part of His Majesty s Grovernment would become imperatively necessary, equally for the protection of British subjects and interests as for the signal vindication of European prestige among these semi-barbarous tribes. Upon hearing of the assault in July last on Mr. Harris, I at once made strong representations to the Persian Government, with the result that pressing instructions were sent by the late Attabek ordering the Bakhtiari Chiefs immediately to take steps for the arrest and punishment of the offenders. On receiving Captain Lorimer’s latest report I renewed my representations privately, and to-day received a reply from Saad-ed-Dowleh, the new Minister for Foreign Affairs, to the effect that fresh instruc tions have been telegraphed to the Shahab and Samsam-es-Saltaneh to see justice done. In view of the fact that the orders of the Attabek, who was known to command the respect of the Khans, were either evaded or so obeyed as to produce no moral effect whatever, I am not at all sanguine that the instructions of a Minister, whose recent appointment to office has been by no means viewed with general approval, will be fruitful of result. The impotence of the Central Government to deal with these and similar cases is, 1 venture to think, amply demonstrated by the series of reports I have had the honour of addressing to you, and I accordingly submit that, in order to avert what would be at best a situation of extreme embarrassment, there are two courses open to His Majesty’s Government—either to recommend to the Oil Syndicate the complete withdrawal of their employes from Persia, or to afford them adequate protection in the places where they are conducting their operations. The disadvantages of the latter alternative, both on the ground of the general policy pursued by His Majesty’s Government in regard to this country and in view of the lately accentuated dislike of foreign enterprise and suspicion of foreign intervention in Persia, are too evident for it to be necessary for me to dwell upon them. I venture, however, to call your serious attention to the grave consequences which would be involved by the withdrawal of the Syndicate’s representatives. A probably fatal blow would be struck at British prestige, for whatever be the ostensible reason for withdrawal, the^ tribesmen and their Chiefs will ascribe to it no other motive than fear. The borings with their costly engineering plant would have to be abandoned; the sums expended by the Syndicate in experimental labours, amounting, I believe, to some 100,000/., would be lost, for even were the responsibility fixed on the Persian Govern ment, and they would usee very effort to shelve it on the ground that they had not recognized the Agreement between the Syndicate and the Bakhtiari Khans, they would be utterly unable to meet the claim; lastly, a possible supply of neutral petroleum, under neither American nor Russian control, would be lost or indefinitely postponed. [2633 gg —14] B2 Id conclusion, T l)c^ to point out tliut should His Tllsjcstj s Government decide upon affording - armed protection to the Syndicate s employes, the objections previously urged by the military authorities in connection with Consular guaids against the locking up of small detachments would to a large extent be removed, in that the three places where I understand the borings are now being conducted, viz., Mamatain, Chardin, and Batwand, are, unlike the Consular posts in the interior, accessible from the one navigable river in Persia, and detachments stationed there could accordingly be withdrawn or reinforced with relative ease and rapidity. I am consulting Captain Lorimer as to the measures he would propose. I might, however, suggest that, as a temporary measure, his guard might be increased, and that he should be instructed to reside in the immediate vicinity of the works. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL SPRING-RICE. Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Vice-Consul Lorimer to Sir C. Spring-Hiee. (No. 56. Camp.) Sir, Ispahan, August 29, 1907. 1 HAVE the honour to inform you that I have just received a large budget of letters and reports from Mr. Reynolds of the Oil Syndicate. I forward inclosed extracts of the more essential parts of these reports, which will enable you to form some idea of the state of affairs. 2. The situation, as I diagnose it, is becoming very serious. All that is wanted to make it impossible is a complete sense of impunity on the part of the aggressive tribes men, and everything for the past six months has been directly calculated to foster such a feeling. The stage already reached is, in my opinion, by no means free of danger to the lives of the European employes of the Syndicate. I have done, and shall continue to do, all that I can with the Khans; but at the best they are a broken reed, and punishments inflicted by them, only under extreme pressure, lose all their value. Such punishments as have been inflicted have been due entirely to insistence by me; they have only been effected after long delay, and it is evident that they have produced no moral effect. The unsatisfactory state of affairs is perhaps not entirely due to ill-will on the part of the Khans, but largely to their total lack of administrative ability, their want of trustworthy underlings, and their domestic quarrels, which make them afraid in many cases of alienating to a rival the support of tribesmen who look on any form of discipline with abhorrence. 6. The serious element in the situation is the character of the Bakhtiari tribesmen. Sudden and ungoverned in their passions, they are accustomed to exercise them among themselves with little regard to future consequences. It is with retaliation only that they have chiefly to reckon ; the one restraint which might have a moderating influence on them—that of capital punishment—is, to the best of my knowledge, non-existent. I heir relations with Europeans in the past have been almost nil, and they have been guided^ in them by a vague apprehension that unknown calamities must follow injury to a European. This feaip which was general, is, however, gradually disappearing throughout Persia, and during the past year or two the Bakhtiaris have been conducting a series o experiments on their own account. 1 he results of these can only be tending to assure them that Europeans and their property are in no way inviolate, and they have gained the certainty that their Khans aie eithei unable or opposed to securing for Europeans effective protection, and that the latter have no power to compel their active assistance. All these conditions combine to furnish a prospect which cannot be regarded by us without disquietude. 4. With regard to the action to be taken at the moment, I shall write myself very strongly to the Khans, and 1 would suggest that the Harris case be again referred to the Attabek. I should not, however, recommend that the latter cases, which have not already been referred to him, should be referred to him at present.3 iest H «,, ■ r'«i| ^ [ ^kS Vl ^i Ifsthi' re ere tbe to4 ’1 Ail ikt bi| rtoftle^jg lj calculated to fete ins tree of d^tur th tie Kta;kk hem, onljM cn inflicted kisfe: ifter lonj delir,!!!: ■floe toflUit dve aiij, Heins rake tbemsfnidi ton any fora of dij flbeBakitiaritrik j to exercise tteir with retaliation^ l^jjt hare a nfl 'best of KJ [most nlaiit j, calamities 1Bli nt. TIig Khans a.rG afiaid of the -A.tta;bGk, ajtid X sha.!! attempt in the first place to stimulate their fear by making use of the threat of submitting our complaints to him. An additional reason for adopting this line is that we have, X presume, no certainty that the Attabek would take up the cases. I shall also revive the question of taking payment of the guards into our own hands, but, at the stage now reached, this, if conceded, would not be the panacea that it might have been earlier. 5. Looking to the future, T think it would be well that the attention of XXis Majesty’s Government should be called to the precarious position of the Syndicate’s work and employes, a position which there is reason to anticipate will be aggravated rather than ameliorated in the near future. The question which has to he confronted is, what action Government would take in the case of the occurrence of a serious disturbance resulting in the loss of British lives. Such an occurrence would almost certainly make the continuance of Europeans in the countiy impossible, unless they were to he adequately protected by reliable Guards and such guards are not to be found in Persia. 6. In an environment like the Bakhtiari country it may be considered as axiomatic that foreign subjects should either be effectively protected, or else that they should not be peimitted to reside in the country at all. Any other course must lead to entire loss of prestige, which will be permanent, and consequently to the complete insecurity of the lives and property of foreigners travelling through, or halting in, the country. It therefore seems to me that if, in the case of certain contingencies which cannot be dismissed as entirely improbable, His Majesty’s Government is not prepared to protect the Oil Syndicate s operations and employes by force, it is desirable and only fair that the Syndicate should be informed of the risks they are running before they have committed themselves to still greater expenditure. There is no reason to believe that the finding of oil, should that take place, would make for greater security. With drawal, however, prematurely, or obviously under the pressure of a handful of bragging savages, would also be a severe blow to our prestige, not only locally, but throughout the country. 7. You will recollect that on various occasions during the past year when the question has been raised, I have inclined to minimize the danger to European lives and property, and that on the whole I have been justified by events. It is with reluctance that now, owing to the spirit I see spreading among the irresponsible tribesmen, I feel myself obliged to adopt a more apprehensive tone. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) D. L, LOHIMER.

THE explanation of the occurrence (f .e., the Harris case) is briefly as explained to his Excellency the Samsam, as caused by labourers from Batwand demanding to be engaged on work, they having left work of their own accord, and resenting that others should he engaged in their place. I send you herewith also copy of a letter written me by the Mirza at the Batwand camp, dated the 1st August, on the subject of the row, and it would seem to he all you can require in addition to Mr. Bradshaw’s Report.

I have the honour to draw your attention to the fact that the man, by name Khormai ( ? ), the same who some three months ago drew his knife on Mr. Crawford and was accordingly punished in the presence of Captain Lorimer, has again been aggressive. On the 25th July last he severely thrashed one of Mr. Crawford’s water-carriers —in fact, so severely, that medical attendance was necessary for the man. He also threatened to beat any one in the employ of Mr. Crawford who came for water, and to stop Mr. Crawford obtaining the water necessary for the camp. (3.)

I have the honour to inform you that on the 30th June I was going to Maidan-i- ^aftun with some of Mr. Bradshaw’s men, I riding my mule, and a few yards from the camp there was a crowd of Batwand people waiting for us on the hill by the way. As soon as we came near to them one of the crowd, by name Ali, with a stick in his hand, began beating the men who were with me, and the others started throwing stones all round me. Eidi, the brother of Mashdi Mohamed Ali, late Raid of Batwand, told them to kill me, as it was through me that they were not engaged as labourers. Mr. Harris, being in his tent, on hearing the row came out to see what w T as the matter, and, on coming near, a man by the name of Kazim threw some stones at him, and, as they were nearly going to break his head, I dismounted and shouted to the guards to defend us, but they did not. I then told Eidi that the matter will he reported to you, and that you will report it to his Excellency Sarum-ul-Mulk, and he became abusive, answering in Persian [here follows abuse of the Sarum-ul-Mulk unfit for repetition.—D.

Owing to the friendly feeling existing between ourselves, you had better have advised us direct, when we would have taken the necessary steps to punish the wrong doers. We shall, however, be grateful in future if you will advise us direct should the like occur again, that we may take the necessary steps to have them punished severely. We have sent two men to inquire into the case, and if any one has done wrong we have ordered that he be chained and brought to us to be punished here. We wish you to give your instructions to the Company’s men, too, to treat the people there better and in a kind and friendly way. and we will do our best to punish at once any one who ill-treats the Company’s men.

To The Right Hon’ble VISCOUNT MORLEY op BLACKBURN, O.M., His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. ber 1907, relative to the increase of the Ahwaz Consular Guard, we have the honour to forward, for Your Lordship’s consideration, the accompanying copy mends that a local allowance, at the rate of Rs. 200 a month, may be sanctioned to Lieutenant Wilson, the officer on duty with the guard of the D’Arcy Oil Syndicate in Arabistan, with effect from the date of his taking charge of his present appointment, and that a similar concession should be granted to Lieutenant Ranking, who is now, under the authority of Your Lordship’s telegram of the 20th July 1908, attached to the Vice-Consulate at Ahwaz. 2. We concur with the views expressed by Major Cox that, having regard to the high cost of living in Persia and the exceptionally arduous conditions under which these officers have been working, the consolidated pay at the rate of Rs. 500 a month, which Lieutenants Wilson and Ranking now draw, cannot be regarded as adequate. In lieu, however, of increasing their present emoluments by a local allow ance at the rate of Rs. 200 a month, we recommend that both officers should receive, with effect from the date of their landing at Mohammerah, till such time as they are relieved of their present duties, the pay of their rank, i.€.&gt; Rs. 825-12-0, in addition to exchange compensation allowance and a local allowance at the rate of Rs. 350 a month, or a total monthly salary of approximately Rs. 718 which cannot, we consider, in the circumstances be considered excessive. The estimated monthly cost, viz.) Rs. 2,280, of the arrangements for the protection of the camps of the D Arcy Oil Syndicate which was reported in our telegram, dated the 11 th November 1907, was based on the assumption that the two officers in charge of the guard would draw pay at the rate of Rs. 600 and Rs. 500 a month, respectively. While therefore the actual increased cost involved in our present proposal amounts to Rs. 436 a month, the total estimated monthly cost will only be increased by Rs. 336 x approximately, i.e^ to Rs. 2,616.

From Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, Officer in charge guards, Oil Syndicate^ To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, ^ I have the honour to represent in the hope of favourable consideration, my position here from a financial point of view. J The case is as follows :— Government has fixed my pay at Rs. 500 . If I was with my regiment I should be drawing not less than Rs, 450 , perhaps more. My exceptional position here involves heavy expense, and I am thus worse off than if I was with my regiment, although I have exchanged the amenities of regimental fife for a solitary existence in a tent during a Persian summer in its least attractive guise. Servants here are expensive in the extreme (the C. S. L. have forced up prices to an incredible degree.) Every ounce of eatables has to be imported from Shushtar by mule caravan, a heavy expense. All stores, such as tea, coffee, etc., must be ordered from Bombay, shipped to Shushtar and thence by caravan here, mules being hired for the purpose. Customs duties must be paid (I am not exempt like Consuls.) Postage on letters and parcels is a heavy item. The result is that I am pecuniarily worse off here than in India, for I draw Rs. 500 here, where the sepoy draws Rs. 50 , and Rs. 450 there, where the sepoy draws Rs. 10 . I respectfully request that Government may be asked to grant me a local allowance, from the date of taking up my duties with the Oil Syndicate, at the same rate as the Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, for whilst I have not so many outgoings as he, such as I have are far costlier, as my distance from the Karun and Shushtar practically doubles the cost of freight from Bombay, and servants and food are twice as costly as in Ahwaz. I should be very grateful for your support in the matter. Apologizing for troubling you. Q. C. B. P., Simla.—No. C-218 F. D.—15*6 08.—.44—J. D.vy mm IM i 1 1908 . SIMLA. FOREIGN E EE N RT M ENT.

Lorimer, I.A., His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul for Arabistan, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to forward enclosed in original a letter No. 7, dated 17th February 1908, which I have received from Lieutenant Banking, and a letter No. 6 , dated 16th February from the same to which is attached a sketch of Maid an Mud af tun. The subject discussed is that of providing built quarters for the officers, men, and horses of the Indian Guard at Maidan Munaftun which it is estimated can he done at a cost of £125 sterling. 2 . In the present state of uncertainty as to the duration of the retention of the guard, which has only been sanctioned for six months, and the further fact that Mr. Beynolds is now in private strongly of the opinion that the operations will have to be abandoned in a few months, it is probable that Government may not see its way to undertake the works proposed, which in themselves are highly desirable. 3 . I would suggest, however, that should the search for oil he prolonged, and the further retention of the guard, which in that event will in my opinion be necessary, be decided on, the possibility of asking the Syndicate to bear a part or the whole of the expense of housing the guard be taken into consideration. I think that a very strong case for their doing so could he made out. It is to be noticed that delay will increase the expense of building, if it does not otherwise make it impossible owing to the absence of labour. 4 . I would beg to call particular attention to the recommendation made by Lieutenant Banking in paragraph 9 of his letter No. 7, and to state my opinion that if the guard is to be retained at Maidan Munaftun beyond the end of May, arrangements should he made to supply the tents asked for before that date. This would mean that they should be shipped from India not later than the end of April. No. 6 , dated Camp Maidan Munaftun, the 16fch February 1908. From— Lieutenant J.

In the event of the question again arising with the Khans of the Company paying for and taking over the ground so occupied, I would^ venture to suggest ^ that some such amount he taken up as is enclosed within the limit A. B. which it will he seen runs along the crests of the hills which form a natural boundary2 to the Maidan and ground occupied by the Oil Company with the exception of the ground to the north-west of the office, etc., where the boundary might run from hill C following the line of the river southwards. 2.

Enclosure. 1 map.No. 7, dated Camp Maidan Munaftun, the 17th February 1908. From— Lieutenant J. Ranking, To—His Britannic Majesty^s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz. I beg to lay before you for your favourable consideration the following scheme for the housing of the escort here with me. 1 would venture to point out that it is absolutely necessary to get the men into some sort of houses before tbe hot weather sets in, otherwise if they have to pass the hot weather under canvas in small tents their efficiency must necessarily suffer owing to the heat, and also if some rough form of houses are built it will effect a saving in tentage, and in the event of oil ultimately being found here the houses might be taken over by the Oil Company for its own use, thereby effecting a clear saving to Government. V ith the above object in view I have the honour to forward herewith plans and rough estimates for favour cf criticism and sanction if approved of. 2. I beg to request that permission to commence building may be granted as soon as possible, as, unless work is started within the next month or so no labour will be obtainable, for, with the exception of those labourers working for the Oil Company, all others go up to the Galagh shortly after the ’Id-i-Nouroz. 3. The scheme is based on a total expenditure of £125 (one hundred and twenty-five), which I propose to allot as follows :— Block A— £ Men’s quarters— To accommodate 20 men, and 2 store rooms for spare kit tents, etc. ........... 50 Block B— To accommodate two British officers . . . . . .50 Block C— To accommodate 8 followers and servants and British officers’ cook house .......... 18 Block A— To also have pent house roof behind as shelter for 10 horses, i.e., 8 escort horses and 1 per British officer . . . . . ... 4. The main item of expenditure is tbe labour, for, as will be seen here after, the majority, I might say all, of the materials are to be had at the price of the labour of collecting and working them. I propose to utilise the labour of tbe escort as opportunity offers, on such work as the feeding-troughs to minimise cost, as has already been done for feeding-troughs in Camp (both day and night lines) and the Ambar for bhusa. 5.

This uniform thickness of 2 ' for the walls has been decided on as it is the most convenient fomaterials Roofs domed of stone and mud, shaped with gatch castings faced with gatch.

Doors and windows to be of wood, obtained ready made from Shushter at 26 krans per door {i.e., 2 leaves lintel and door posts) and 4—6 krans per window {i.e», 2 leaves and frame).

Pent bouse roof of stable to be formed of surplus iron pipes of about 1' in diameter if obtainable from Oil Company as trusses {if not of “bailies” (wooden beams)}, with short cross pieces of reed which grows along the banks of the streams in the vicinity (the greei. tops of which will be used for fodder for the horses which they readily eat in preference to bbusa). These reeds to be finally covered with a l'-2* layer of mud plaster. floors.—The floor of the stable to slope 1 in 42 from the trough backwards I propose to make the floor of stones not larger than a polo ball set in a bed made by mixing crude black oil and sand to the consistency of stiff clay. The above has been tried by me on a small scale and appears to answer requirements. It has the advantage of forming a hard surface very similar to asphalt, easy to keep clean and free from droppings and stalings and is cheaper than gatcb to put down, as it requires no burning, its only dis- advantage being its slowness in thoroughly drying in comparison with the latter. Some natural paths similar to asphalt and which appear to have been formed by the mixing of sand and black oil are to be found in the vicinity. Feeding troughs. —To be 1 yard from black wall of bouse to allow of easy access to the horses’ beads. Back wall to be 4s' high to prevent wastage of food, front wall S' bottom 2 ' from ground level. To be made of stone and mud and plastered over with mud to save expense. No foundations. 8 . Site. —As regards site I would suggest that the bouses be built on the site of the present camp, facing west by south in the following order :—Block B, Block C, Block A. As will be seen from reference to sketch * map, Maidan Munaftun (forwarded under my No. 6 of 16th ^February 1908), the cite is a central one and has the following additional advantages :— (i) Is on rising ground being a continuation of a spur of the hill to the north-east of Camp. Its soil is of white sand, hence the site is dry and well drained and does not bold water after rain. Is reasonably close to the animals’ watering place in the stream west of the office, etc. An ambar for bbusa has been built with escort labour of stones and mud and faced with mud, is situated at the back ol t e present camp limits. Another consideration in favour of early commencement of work is the fact that wood for burning gatcb can be procured at present at rates be 0 the average, owing to there being a large amount of wood cut ready to bring in which the Oil Company have refused to take. The above scheme will be carried through with the utmost cheapness, which is compatible with good work, and if any saving is eftectea ou (ii) I ■ .the original rough estimate of £125 (one hundred and twenty-five only), any such surplus will either be refunded to Government or expended in such minor works as may be deemed necessary. 9. If either on account of its expense or on account of any uncertainty as to how long the Guard is to remain in maidan Munaftun, the above scheme is deemed impracticable, I venture to suggest as an alternative that 4 S.S. tents he sanctioned for the escort’s use during the hot weather. This, it will be seen from Army Eegulations, India, Volume II, paragraph 771, as amended by Standing Army Order No. 58 of 1905, is allowable, and even these tents in the hot weather would make a great difference to the health of the escort, more over, the freight of such tents would be comparatively small even if they had to be shipped from India.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 26 of the 14th February, I have the honour to transmit herewith copies of printed correspondence in regard to the affairs of the Oil Syndicate with which I have been furnished by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire. Amin-us-Sharieh has been dismissed from the service of the Ispahan Consulate- General, as he had in every way failed to give satisfaction to Mr. Barnham. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CHARLES M. MARLING. Inclosure 1 in No. 1 . Vice-Consul Lorimer to Major Cox. (Confidential.) Ahwaz, December 30, 1907. IN continuation of my telegram No. 42, of which 1 sent you a copy by last post, informing you of the pressure being put on Mr. Reynolds by his principals to adopt a conciliatory attitude towards the Khans, in particular in regard to the question of demanding from them compensation for losses, I have now the honour to forward copies of a Memorandum addressed by the Syndicate Board to Mr. Reynolds on the same subject, and of a letter from the Khans which is attached to this Memorandum. 2 . Before proceeding further I would say that, owing to the continued state of collapse of the telegraph line, my telegram No. 42 has not yet been dispatched to Tehran, and that I would therefore suggest that you should telegraph such a message to His Britannic Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires as that telegram and the present letter may render advisable in your opinion. 3. With regard to the Syndicate’s Memorandum, which I have little hesitation in attributing to the pen of Mr. Preece, I quite appreciate the anxiety which it is only natural that the appearances of the circumstances should arouse in their minds, but with the opinion which I have formed of the Khans’ character and my reading of present signs, I cannot concur in the estimate of the situation which they deduce from the diatribes of the Khans. On the other hand, in the further light of the letters which I have received from the Khans within the last month and a half, I strongly incline to the opinion that the position of the Oil Company has never been more secure than it is at the present moment, and with the steps which we are now on the eve of taking, I am hopeful that disturbing incidents like those of the Batwand assault and the Shardin case will cease. 4. The result of our dealings with the Khans during the past year has been to reduce them from a state of bullying confidence to one of apprehensive respect. They have played every card in the game of bluff, blackmail, intimidation, complaint against myself, and finally their last trump, renunciation of responsibility, and have seen us hold on unmoved; and they are now seeking to recover their false step, in employing their ultimate weapon without effect, and to bring things back to the situation which preceded their coup manque'. As this suits our purposes, I consider it our policy to make their retreat easy for them, and I am acting on this line. To alter our policy now to one of concession would, in my opinion, be the best way to restore confidence to the Khans, and that would only mean the renewal of their old exactions with the addition of a hundred new ones, and the employment of the methods of last winter and spring—robbery and disturbances—to lend force to their demands. 5. The Syndicate is also probably not aware of the state of Messrs. Lynch’s affairs, which will continue to demand unrelaxed stringency on the part of the Legation and myself as its representative, and which, as the Khans’ minds do not work in watertight compartments, will continue to colour our general relations with them, and this will be [2952 Z—21] Bthe case even were the Oil Syndicate to start a policy of invincible complaisance. Some of the effects of this interdependence of different interests might perhaps be obviated by the Syndicate conducting their own negotiations, and if they are prepared to undertake this they might depute Mr. Preece to come out here for the purpose. 6 . I feel confident that the opinion expressed above will meet with the concurrence of the Legation, and I have only written at this length in case it should be considered advisable to offer the Syndicate any full exposition of my views. 7 . It is to be kept in mind that the Memorandum deals only with the deduction of the compensation claims from the November instalment, and that the writer of it is apparently in ignorance of the Khans’ declaration of the 15th November, and of the suspension of the whole instalment, and still further of the subdued manner in which this action has been received by the Khans. As regards the compensation, from the point of view of immediate effect, there might not be much danger in maintaining silence on the subject for the time being, so long as the Khans were not aware that it was an intentional or calculated silence on our part. From the point of view of ultimate effect, the longer the question of recovery is postponed, the more difficult will the operation become. Nor, even the Syndicate consenting, could the eventual renunciation of claims be regarded with favour, as such action would tend to compromise the force of our demands made in similar cases in the future on behalf of Messrs. Lynch Brothers or any other British interests. 8 . For the reasons already stated in paragraph 6 ,1 propose to offer a few comments on minor points in the Syndicate’s Memorandum; curtness is to be attributed only to a desire for brevity. The real state of mind and the effective intentions of the Khans are not to be gathered from the tone of their letters, written violently with the deliberate design of producing a particular impression. I admit that the instability of the Central Govern ment is an unsatisfactory factor, but 1 do not consider it dangerous. There is nothing in the Agreement to show that the 2,000/. was in fact granted the Khans for the use of their land. Kemuneration for this was guaranteed in various other ways; and the Khans themselves have at no time put forward this argument. Concessions would not be a matter of a few krans. There is no responsible Chief amongst the Bakhtiaris outside the ruling families. The guards at present are nominally supplied by, and under the control of, the most influential men in the district. I thoroughly appreciate the desirability of work going on quietly, and conceive that our present policy, however improbable it may seem from the remoteness of London, is the best calculated to secure that end. The payment of the extra 500/. is recommended, but the provisional clauses which follow beg the whole question. Who is going to guarantee any promise made by the Khans that they will supply adequate guards, &amp;c. ? The statement that the situation will be improved by the finding of oil is a fallacy. In my opinion, exactly the reverse will be the case, more especially if it has been preceded by a period of concession-making on our own part. Where demands contrary to justice are made, concession or conciliation will never secure satisfaction or gratitude, and will only act as an incitement to constant and progressive blackmailing. 9. As the Memorandum recognizes that the Khans’ letter is a tissue of lies, it is unnecessary to discuss the dubious compliments paid to Mr. Preece, or the invective against^ my own manner and language, while the elaborate misstatements it contains can be judged in the light of the facts, which are mostly public property. There is one feature about this letter, however, to which I think it proper to call attention, and that is the identity of the addressee, which is concealed under the style of a u Persian friend.” J On my general knowledge, I have little doubt as to who he is, but it is sufficient here to examine the internal evidence. It appears from the Khans’ letter'that he is a man whose friendship they have enjoyed for some time; that he is acquainted with the confidential affairs of the Syndicate and Messrs. Lynch Brothers, and that he was, and probably is, attached to a British Consulate, anu finally that he was with Mr. Preece 'when the Agreement 'fit. the Khans was drawn up with the Syndicate (at Shalamar). . ^his can only be one person, the Amin-us-Sheriah, who has for years held tbe position of Confidential Agent or Adviser in the Ispahan Consulate-General. This raafl was a piotegd of Mr. Preece’s, but has failed to give satisfaction to Mr. Barn hank which enables me to raise this point without losing a couple of months by first referring, to the latter.My object in writing on the subject is to call attention to what appears to me the highly icpiehensible conduct of this man, a Grovernment servant, in establishing himself as an independent and secret intermediary between the Syndicate and the khan. His collect action under the circumstances, which is recognized even by the Khans, was to lay the matter before his official superior, with whom all further action should have icsted. That he did do so appears inconceivable, as in that case I should have been informed by His Majesty’s Consul-General, and the Khans’ letter, had it reached the Syndicate at all, would have done so through official channels. But the blame in the matter appears to me to extend beyond this man and attach also to the recipients of the letter, who have suppressed the identity of its transmitter, and who, for all that is known, may have returned some reply, compromising or otherwise through the same medium. 10.^ Assuming that no hint of this correspondence was made to His Britannic Majesty s Consul-General at Ispahan, I would suggest that he might be consulted as to whether he could obtain a direct admission from the Amin-us-Skeriah of his havin 0 * been a party to it. Inclosure 2 in No. 1 . Mr. J. Jenkins to Mr. G. Reynolds. (Private.) 9, Gracechurch Street, London, December 6 , 1907. I HAVE been requested to hand you the inclosed translation of a letter from the Bakhtiari Khans to a Persian friend ; also a Memorandum dealing with this letter. Kind regards. Inclosure 3 in No. 1 . Memorandum addressed by the Concessions Syndicate to Mr. G. Reynolds. THE inclosed translation of a letter from the Bakhtiari Chiefs, which has been sent to Mr. Preece, is forwarded to Mr. Reynolds for his information. It is suggested that Mr. Reynolds should show to Captain Lorimer not only the inclosure, but also this communication. It is evident from the tone of this letter that the Bakhtiaris are in a very great state of tension, and are but seeking for a pretext to quarrel. Taking into consideration the present state of affairs in Persia, the Shah’s Government changing every few days, their orders not even running in Tehran, the general state of unrest throughout the country, the Legation with no great faith in the future and with but little power to help us, although we are backed up to the utmost by the Foreign Office, the Bakhtiari Chiefs have evidently our beards in their hands, and if they are not made contented, the work must perforce stop. Their complaints are nothing but a tissue of lies—not one can hold water really—but it must be remembered that when it was arranged to pay them 2 , 000 /. per annum, it was done as much for permission to use their ground as for guards. To us at the present time it is of paramount importance that the work should go on quietly and systematically at Maidan-i-Naptun; such enormous interests are involved that it is not worth our while to sacrifice them for the sake of a few krans. Without wishing in any way to throw over Captain Lorimer, who is or was ready to fight the Chiefs to a finish, we think it desirous that the next instalment should be paid to the Chiefs without any deduction whatever, keeping the question of deduction for robbery open for future settlement, and also that the extra 500/. per annum should be paid the Chiefs, provided they give adequate guard under a responsible Chief, not necessarily one of their own family, that those to whom robberies have been traced, or who have been caught, like the man in Mr. Lewko’s tent, should be properly punished. It must be obvious both to Captain Lorimer and Mr. Reynolds how imperative it is that the work should go on quietly until oil is found; once that desired result is attained, the situation will be completely changed; therefore we hope that every endeavour will be made to conciliate the Chiefs, for the time at least, on the lines we have indicated above, and that Mr. Reynolds will be able to complete his work without impediment. Ahwaz, November 23, 1907. B 2 [2952 /—21]Inclosure 4 in No. 1. Letter from the Bakhtiari Khans to a Persian Friend, dated some time in October 1907. ^ SIN’CE^your friendship is assured and as you are fully acquainted with the contracts with Lynch’s and the Oil Company, we trouble you with the request that if, as previously you are with the British Consulate, you will, in whatever manner you think best, bring this letter to the notice of the British Legation and British Consulate, and explain the purport of it verbally. ,, . . , , • , Previously, there was a road through the Bakhtiari country over which caiavans and merchandise passed and crossed the rivers by ferries, the ferryman levying a toll for the work a portion of which toll was paid to us by way of revenue; two years previous to Lynch’s making the road and bridge, we made a good bridge of ropes, by which the traffic passed the river most satisfactorily. Then the old order of things passed from our control, and Lynch’s seriously departed from the terms of their Agreement, and caused us an infinity of trouble and loss by reason of the roads and caiavanserais we built. You must be aware that since the road was made we had nothing but trouble and loss; the building of the two iron bridges was also the cause of much trouble and loss to us. , You know that during these few years Mr. Preece was the Consul-General at Ispahan and was our good friend ; his friendship and knowledge and interest in our affairs is the reason of our friendship with the British Government, and we are grateful to him in that he conducted our affairs with justice, rectitude, and friendship, and correctness, and took friendly trouble for us and in our affairs. It was due to his efforts that whenever Lynch’s attempted to oppress us, Mr. Preece, in accordance with justice and agreement, prevented our being tyrannized over; he prevented Lynch’s making exorbitant charges, and arranged that we paid 300 odd tomans the first year and 400 tomans the second year. We did not at that time realize the ability and fairmindedness of Mr. Preece ; but^all this has been changed, and, in place of that favour, we have only trouble and worries. Our affairs appear to have been transferred to the charge of the Vice-Consul at Ahwaz (Captain Lorimer), who at first treated us in a friendly manner; but now he has taken up another style, at once so overbearing and harsh that the bands of the proverbial and ancient friendship between us and the English Government are strained to the breaking- point. For example, in the contract for the road it is stipulated that no engineer (for the roads) should be sent without our concurrence; now he states that last year an engineer came (but without our knowledge) and painted the bridge, and presents charges to the amount of 1,500 tomans, and in the most harsh, hectoring, and coarse language (which we cannot write to you) peremptorily demands payment of the same. Another matter is the contract of the Oil Company. You were with Mr. Preece when the contract was made. All the difficult and very binding clauses drawn up with mutual friendship were accepted by us ; but now the Oil Company’s representatives are treating our people in a very severe manner, and are acting in a very reprehensible way. We requested Captain Lorimer to put a stop to such actions, but he prefers to magnify other small matters, making mountains out of mole-hills, and makes difficulties where there should be none. The question of robberies inserted in the contract is beyond our control, but he demands compensation, and wishes to deduct the amount from the instalment which is due. He complains of the guards without just cause. By reason of all these difficulties it was agreed under the seal of the British Legation that the instalments should be increased yearly by 500/. for the expenses of the Chief of the road guards, who were to be increased and always present. That latter we performed; now that it is time toi payment of the instalment, he repudiates it and refuses to pay. We fear we tire you, but there are still many questions unmentioned. We request that, in whatever way you consider best and possible, to inform the British Legation and officials fully on these matters, in order that the friendship of so many years may not be broken.

It will be observed from the latter of these two messages that His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz considers the moment inopportune for pressing the Bakhtiari chiefs to permit the payment of the native guards by the Syndi cates and that, in view of the fact that the question of whether the enterprise can be profitably worked will probably be settled within six months, he strongly de precates the removal of the Indian guards before the expiration of that period. Mr. Marling fully shares the opinion expressed by Captain Lorimer. It ^ Under Secretary of State, India Office.It will be remembered that in the letter from the Treasury of December 7th. last (see Confidential Print, Persia, December 9th. section 3) the maintenance of an increased Consular guard at Ahwaz was authorised for a period of six months. The reinforcements arrived at their destination about December 17th. so that approxi mately three months and a half have yet to elapse be fore the expiration of the time sanctioned. I am to state that in these circumstances it ap pears to Sir E.

Captain Lorimer adds that the Syndicate’s claim for compensation from the Khans before these latest thefts amounted to 1,100 tomans on account of losses sustained since the end of March last. Mr. Bradshaw reported that on the 11th November a large bellows for forge and a small portable forge were stolen. Mr. Reynolds added: “If this utter neglect in the matter of guarding the property of the Company continues, the drilling will be stopped hy the removal or destruction of some essential part of the gear. . . . Already we have been robbed of part of our tackle, which we cannot do without, and which it will take me six weeks or even more to replace from Bombay.” In his letter of the ilth November, Mr. Bradshaw stated that the guards furnished for the last week had been as follows:— At Batwand, three men with one gun; At Drillers’ Camp, two men with one gun; At Maidan-i-Munaftun, two men with no gun ; and added that the tribesmen were then coming down by hundreds and camping all round the works; that, though for the moment they were engaged in killing each other near the camp, they might quite possibly be encouraged to attack the workers by their practically unguarded state; and that it would be no matter for surprise if a the drillers one day turned up at Naseri and refused to work any longer, unless a radical and speedy change be made in the farce that is being enacted here under the ““ InVifw a of 'the subsequent repudiation by the Khans of all responsibility in the matter (see my despatch No. 257 of the 30th November), which made the outlook even Z e unpromising^ I think His Majesty’s Government wi be more than ever “nvinced of the necessity that existed for the dispatch of Indian guards to the scene of disorder.

Tone conciliatory; deals in subdued expostulatory_ protestation [sic] of past services and personal friendship, and implies no repudiation of responsibility which I had not myself mentioned specifically.

Mention of compensation might be postponed, but Syndicate should understand that this will render recovery of this and subsequent claims still more difficult in future. I have communicated with Representative m the above sense.” Cox supports Lorimer’s view, and I entirely agree with them. It appears that Khans have managed to communicate direct with Syndicate with the ohjectof appealing against attitude of Legation just as they a PPy le f, ^ against Lorimer. From indications here and from that Khans are coming to heel, and it would be most unde irable that independent action of Syndicate should counteract good result achieved.

The note appears to me to be most unsatisfactory. The Persian Government seek to evade all responsibility, and have not apparently attempted in any way to exact any guarantees from the Bakhtiari Khans for the observance of their obligations and the protection of the Companies’ property and employes. . The attempt to take credit for the punishment of Mr. Harris assailants is absurd.

Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey. — (Received December 23.) ^ ^ Tehran, November 30, 1907. AS I Lad the honour to report in my telegram No. 312 of the 15th instant, I received on that date a visit from Murtaza Kuli Khan, son of Samsam-es-Saltaneh,. Ilkhani of the Bakhtiari tribes, accompanied by two other Bakhtiari Khans, Suja-es- gultan and Bahadur-ed-Dowleh, both of whom reside normally in Tehran. The Ilkhani’s son acted almost exclusively as spokesman. In my telegram above mentioned I sketched the main lines of the conversation which ensued and recorded its essential points. The complaints they brought forward fell into two main categories: the bill for painting and repairing the bridges on the Ahwaz-Ispahan road in 1901, and the compensation claims presented to them for losses incurred by the Oil Syndicate and their employes. The former they claimed to be excessive, and though I explained to them that all Messrs. Lynch’s claims had underoone the most careful examination at the hands both of this Legation and of His Maiesty’s Government before presentation, and that this one in particular was a true account of moneys actually expended, they showed no signs of abandoning their contention, even hinting that an unjust attempt was being made to extract payments ^ ^ With regard to the latter, they complained that compensation was claimed for all sorts of trilling objects, such as damaged pans and broken plates, for which it was absurd to hold them responsible. This complaint, which is a regular p/a£ dujour m Captain Lorimer’s discussions with the Chiefs, I did not^ regard as ^meriting serious, attention. I had already explained to them that Captain Lorimer s mission was to- smooth over any difficulties between the Companies and the Bakhtiari, and that I was confident he would not support any frivolous claims on behalf of the former, and would carefully examine any grievances which the latter might bring to ms notice.. The Khans must not think that he was partial to one side or the other. W hen they now put forward a formal request for his removal, which was clearly the mam object of their visit, I curtly informed them that it would not be granted. The next topic they touched upon was the arrangements for guarding the Oil Syndicate’s works and the failure of the Syndicate to pay them the extra 500/. covenanted for. I said I could not think of recommending the payment of this additional sum unless the Khans made proper provision for the eftectrve protection of the lives and property involved, and this they had signally failed to do. Ineieupon Suja-es-Sultan vehemently exclaimed that 200 men had at one time been sent , and I inquired horv, in that case, an outrage like that perpetrated on Mr. Hanm could 1 a Murtaza Kuli Khan then entered upon a_ muddled survey of their case m which grievances against, claims on or by, and obligations towar s i essrs. ync an Oil Syndicate were inextricably confused. , r -.-u The upshot of it all was, more inferentially, perhaps, than by direct speech « thL whose uses the Persian is strangely unfamiliar, that they were smc o a ns with foreigners, that they would gladly shut up the road and all the caravanserais on it, as it cost them more money and worry than it was worth; and that, as iega Oil Syndicate’s works, they would henceforth divest themselves of all responsibility for the protection of the employes unless their demands were agreed to. They spoke of having so far prevented the tribes from attacking the oil we s, an core P Harris incident as quite trivial. Their general tone was extremely imcomprom g and, in fact, aggressive. The impression derived by my mterpre er, w C the me instead of' translating in full the long and rambling statements made by t Ilkhani’s son, was that all we could expect of them was that the tribes should be pie- vented from openly attacking the oil wells. . T • ~ in -^-t- 'ha In reply I merely reiterated my statement that Captain Lorimer w u [2757 3—9]removed, and added that as to the rest the Khans must decide as to the wisdom of the steps they proposed to take in their own interests. The speaker then formally disclaimed all responsibility from that day forward, apparently as well for the road as for the oil works, and, on being questioned, stated that he did so with the authority of the Ilkhani and Ilbeggi. That the leading motive actuating these gentlemen was the desire for Captain Lorimer’s removal I think there is no doubt. Various suggestions have been made as f / to the quarter from which their action was influenced in order to create difficulties for His Majesty’s Government, e g., the Shah or his party, or a section of the Assembly. These theories seem, however, unimportant, and are incapable of confirniation. In Captain Lorimer they have found a man with whom they cannot trifle, whose patience they cannot exhaust, and whom neither threats nor irrelevant arguments will turn from his purpose. Their sole object being the rapid acquisition of wealth with the minimum of responsibility or bother, it is not unnatural that they should find dealings with such a man extremely inconvenient. There is not a shred of evidence to show that Captain Lorimer has ever abused his position or exceeded his powers, and I conceive it to be just as much in the_interest of His Majesty’s Government to retain as it is in that of the Khans to remove him. Mr. Kitabji, whom recent events, and particularly the news of my interview with the Khans, have galvanized into an unwonted and not altogether tactful activity, informs me that the unyielding attitude which I felt it my duty to adopt produced a sobering effect on my visitors, who have since been assailed with doubts as to the wisdom of the step they took and alarmed at its possible consequences. In conclusion, I have the honour to transmit copy of a note which I addressed to the Persian Government in accordance with the instructions contained in your telegram No. 177 of the 16th November. _ i I have as yet received no reply to this communication, but I have spoken officially to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and privately to the Prime Minister and the President of the Assembly, on the attitude of the Khans, and have impressed on them the great interest which His Majesty’s Government attach to the two great British enterprises in the Bakhtiari country. They all promised to do everything possible to force the Khans to observe their engagements and to protect British lives and properties ; but while I am convinced that the Persian Government are ready to use on our behalf such influence as they may possess over the Bakhtiari Chieftains, it must be remembered that their influence is only moral, and that they can themselves do nothing whatever to afford material protection to our interests.

THE lawlessness and disorder prevailing in Bakhtiaristan have been causing the gravest concern to His Majesty’s Government for the safety of the employes an property of the two important British commercial enterprises operating in that region, namely, the Persian Transport Company and the D’Arcy Oil Syndicate. . . Until now a certain measure of protection has been afforded by the Bakhtiari Khans to the property and employes of these Companies, but I have recently received an intimanon from their Excellencies that for the future they decline to accept any responsibility whatever in this respect or to fulfil the various obligations they nave assumed in either case. _ , , Even before this repudiation by the Khans of their responsibility the condition oi the country was only too alarming, as is shown by the constant robberies of caravans on the Ahwaz-Ispahan road and the attack on Mr. Harris at Batwand, of which yon Excellency is no doubt cognizant; and now that the responsible Chiefs seek to ova the duties and obligations of their position, it is clear that the uncertainty and dang in which British lives and property in these regions are placed has been serious) aggravated. It has been my duty to keep my Government fully informed of these cn cun^ stances, and, in pursuance of the instructions which I have received from His Majes} 5.

An attack in force he adds is highly improbable and is a contingency which need not be contemplated. 10 more infantrymen will be necessary to meet Vice Consul’s recommendation; but he says that 6 of his own escort can be lent for the present and uggests that as general outlook i s more favourable perhapsJ. 1 V the despatch of more men from India might be delayed the receipt by yourself and Government of India of hi written reports.

I HAVE the honour to refer to your telegram of the 13th instant and to my telegram No. 39 of the same date, in the latter of which I am not sure that I made myself quite clear. 2. With the principle of supplying what might be described as hody-guards for the British subjects at the scenes of the Syndicate’s works I am in thorough accord. It may annoy the Khans, but it will frighten them, and have a good moral effect in general in demonstrating that we are in earnest, and prepared to take practical measures to secure the safety of our subjects. 3. The difficulties are that my present guards’ time expires in October, and their relief has been announced for the latter half of NovemberThe relief can only take place at Ahwaz, and it would be unwise to formally initiate the scheme of resident guard’s at Batwand and elsewhere, when it would almost immediately be necessary to withdraw them for several weeks. Also any arrangement which would tend to delay the departure of the outgoing guard might lead to some trouble with them. Horses cannot be obtained in Arabistan, but unmounted men would always be of use for the purposes of the scheme. 4. These, however, are comparatively trifles; the important point is that, in my opinion, it would be quite impossible to locate Indian sowars at the Qilwmrks without a suitable British officer in charge of them. The position might be delicate, and a certain degree of judgment and tact would be necessary. Eurther, the sowars them selves would probably get out of hand, having no one of authority or experience over them; and again, if there were no one to attend to them on the spot, the sowars’ affairs, accounts, &amp;c., would get into hopeless confusion. These considerations would apply with augmented force to the relieving guards, whose character is an unknown quantity, and whose ignorance of the language, country, and people would constitute an additional danger. It would be quite impossible for me to stay permanently at Batwand, and therefore, if the experiment is to be made, I think a special British officer should be provided. He could be called a Consular Assistant, and he would gain an experience of Bakhtiari affairs which would bridge the hiatus that under present circumstances seems likely to occur when I go on leave. In case the question of the selection of an officer should arise, the qualities which should be specially sought for are a sound judgment and an even temper. 5. On the Batwand side the Syndicate have, I think, three camps scattered along a line of 16 miles, and it would probably be necessary to provide detachments for each. The scene of operations on the Mamatain side is comparatively concentrated. [2717 66 — 21 ]2 The numbers suggested in my telegram would, I think, suffice to produce the moral impression which is the object in view. To prevent offences against property and to guarantee the satety of every native employe would of course he a perfectly different thing, and might require a large force. 6. A step like that contemplated would probably have a sobering effect on the Khans, and bring them to accept any terms proposed; hut such acceptance would be no more to he relied on than the promises they have lavished on us in the past. It is probable at the same time that they would raise some outcry, and I presume that in case of their appealing to Tehran you would he prepared either to carry the authorities there along with you or to defy them. We only desire to provide for the safety of the lives and persons of British subjects, and a strong claim could be based on the analogy of the Consular guards, of which these guards would in fact be a part.

Tliey aie intended as a substantial addition to Captain Lorimer’s guard of twelve men, which, it appeals fiom his despatch of the 14th September, he contemplated using at Batwand and other places. It must be left to his discretion where and in what numbers to employ them. If, as appears from your telegram, they are not sufficient for the protection of all the camps, the employes must be concentrated where they can be protected, and if a senous attack is anticipated from the Bakhtians, the officers m charge should avoid a conflict, and retire to the river with the British employes. r •*? mmmk i //N CONFIDENTIAL.

It appears that former includes two camps, which are 2 miles apart. The latter has a base, viz., Batwand, 16 miles away, and is itself composed of two borings, a mile apart, with a workshop between. Borings at Mamatain are at present going on, but are likely to be relinquished as unprofitable, in which case guard would be transferred to Maidan-i-Munaftun. “ Lorimer’s reports do not say precisely how he would propose to distribute the guard. “As far as I can judge, pending reply from him, four infantry and two sowars at Mamatain, ditto at Shardin, ditto at Batwand, ditto at Maidan-i-Munaftun would suffice. “ Total, sixteen infantry and eight sowars. “ If the twenty men which I suggested in September have started, he extra four could probably be [?lent] temporarily by Lorimer until decision is arrived at regarding relinquishment of Mamatain. “ The above would seem reasonable provision for purposes of sentry-go, protection from pilfering now prevalent, and for escort work between camps. In order to cope with actively hostile movement on the part of Bakhtiaris, measures would be required on a totally different scale, which His Majesty’s Government seem disinclined to under take. Last letter from Lorimer, dated 20th November, reports petty robberies still going on, and provisional guards still farcical, and civilian employes likely to abscond if better protection not afforded.” [864—193]0 CONFIDENTIAL. \Q,s ' ^ -‘OV/ \Vv. ll ri-rb%£ V Sir Edward Grey to Sir A.

Grey considers the proposed increase to he necessary for the protection of the Consulate and Consular staff, and that, in view of the fact that their Lordships sanction the proposal subject to this condition, he has requested the Secretary of State for India to take the necessary steps to send the reinforcements. # With regard to Ahwaz, I am to transmit copies of further telegrams from His Majesty’s Consul at that place showing that the proposed increase is urgently required.* I am also to inclose copy of a further letter from the India Office,! from which it will be seen that the Government of India now propose to send an infantry guard with eight mounted men instead of cavalry, which would reduce the expenditure from 533/. 6 s. 8 cZ. to 266/. 13s. 4d. initial, and from 1,920/. per annum to 1,824/. per annum recurring. Sir E. Grey has throughout the present disturbed state of affairs in Persia declined to adopt the policy of sending expeditions inland for the protection of British subjects, and has caused the latter to be warned that in case of danger they must proceed to the coast. It is not denied that the principal object of increasing the Ahwaz guard is to protect the lives of the employes and the property of the Oil Syndicate, but the case appears to Sir E. Grey to be exceptional. Ahwaz is easily accessible from the river, and a small expenditure, half of which will be borne by the Government of India, will, it is hoped, prevent the total abandon ment of an important British enterprise, with the great loss of British prestige throughout Persia which it would entail. In view of the above considerations, I am to express the earnest hope that their Lordships will reconsider their decision and sanction half the expenditure incurred in the dispatch of the guards and their maintenance for a period of six months.

Spring-Bice’s despatch No. 209 of the 13th September, from which it is clear that the lives of British subjects and the valuable property of the Oil Syndicate in the neighbourhood of that place may at any moment be exposed to serious danger, and that the only alternative policy to adequate protection would be the complete with drawal of the employes from Persia—a course which w r ould be attended with disastrous results to British prestige—apart from the material losses which would be With regard to the inquiry contained in the third paragraph of your letter, I am to state (1) that the present guard at Ispahan consists of eight men, that at Ahwaz of twelve : (2) that it is now r proposed to send twelve additional men to Ispahan and twenty additional men with two officers to Ahwaz; and (3) that the figures given in the letter from this Department of the 22nd instant represent the gross cost of the proposed increase. With regard to the last paragraph of your letter, I am to state that, in spite of the Anglo-Bussian Convention, which makes no provision for the reciprocal protection of the lives and property of British and Bussian subjects, the disturbed state of Persia makes it impossible for the present to contemplate any reduction of the British Consular establishments there, and in support of this view it is only necessary to point to the cases of Ispahan and Ahwaz, in which an increase is considered necessary. When, however, tranquillity and order have been restored in the country, Sir E. Grey will gladly welcome the reduction of the Consular guards, and he trusts that this desirable situation may not be long deferred. I am to add that, in view of the explanations afforded above. Sir E. Grey earnestly hopes that their Lordships will consent to the proposals now before them. incurred. I am, &amp;c. (Signed) LOUIS MALLET.

Grey to state, for tbe information of the Lords Commissioners of tbe Treasury, that he has been in consultation with Mr. Secretary Morley respecting the situation at Ispahan and Ahwaz, and that he has arrived at the decision that it is necessary, in view of the disturbed state of affairs at those places, to increase the Consular guards. The Russian Government have already raised the number of their Consular guard at Ispahan. At Ahwaz an increase in the British Consular guard is essential with a view to the protection of the British subjects engaged in prospecting for oil in the neighbourhood, an undertaking which, it is hoped, will open up a wide field for British enterprise. In these circumstances I am to express the earnest hope that you will move the Lords Commissioners to sanction the payment of one-half of the estimated expenditure, which is stated to be 268L initial and 580/. a-year recurring on account of Ispahan, and 533/. 6 s. 8 d. initial and 1,920/. a-year recurring on behalf of Ahwaz. In the case of Ahwaz the sums quoted are exclusive of transport charges. In view of the critical situation in the localities in question, I am to request that a reply may be returned to this letter as soon as possible. I am to add that these increases should not be regarded as permanent. I am* &amp;c. (Signed) LOUIS MALLET.
