REPORT ON A TOUR Hff TURKISH ARABIA AND KURDISTAN APRIL-MAY 1910 BY J. G. LORIMER, ESQ., C.I.E., I.C.S., \ British Political Besident in Turkish Arabia and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Baghdad, SIMLA: PRINTED AT THE GOVERNMENT MONOTYPE PRES&amp; C-223 GSB 1913.REMAKES. The following tour report has been written up from notes taken by me on a journey made in April-May 1910, on which I was accompanied by Mr. J. C. Gaskin, Commercial Assistant in the Baghdad Residency. The information of immediate interest obtained, political and military, was communicated to Government at the time ; that now submitted is mainly topographical. If it can be plotted into the existing maps by means of points such as Kirkuk, Arbll, etc., which are approximately fixed, it will add some useful detail and correct a few mistakes. The baggage caravan on the journey consisted partly of ponies and partly of mules. The times recorded while travelling by land were ordinarily those of a walking horse, and so varied with the ground ; but the average speed was 3 to Similes an hour. The only instrument used for taking directions was a pocket compass. In travelling down the Tigris the rate of progress varied with current and wind, and here the time taken is only a rough guide to the distance traversed. No notes were taken on the familiar road from Baghdad to Khanaqin and Qasr-i-Shlrin, which latter place, as well as Chiah Surkh, the oil field of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company in that direction, was visited. It was not thought necessary to describe in detail such places as Musal and Samarra which have received attention from other travellers. The system of transliteration followed in the report is that authorised by the Foreign Department of the Government of India for Arabic, but with modifications in the case of Turkish names. J. G. LORIMEB, Political Resident, Baghdad. “ Lawrence On board R.I.M.S. 16th September 1912. C223GSB0 REPORT ON A TOUR IN TURKISH ARABIA AND KURDISTAN. APRIL-MAY, 1912. Khanaqin to Zangabad. . (18th April 1910.) We left Khanaqm at 10-30 a.m. and marched for 15 minutes along the right bank of Alwand. The Alwand hereabouts is 20 to 30 yards broad and generally fordable. We next crossed flat lands, fallow, etc., for 5 minutes. We then crossed (first) a hollow called Darwanjik, coming from the hills on the north, and (second) a canal called Qulah, 20 feet wide, with water 3 feet deep, coming from the westwards. From this point Khanaqin lies to the south-east. To the north-east at J a mile is a village, Kawazi. To the south-west, i«t Station. (20 minutes.) a. 0 f a m q e&gt; the tomb of 'Abbas on a mound. About due west, at 1 mile, is the village of ’Aliyawah, 100 houses of miscellaneous Kurds. Just beyond this point the Qulah canal is spanned by an aqueduct 4 feet broad. W e proceeded for 15 minutes. To the south by west from the point then reached lies Muhammad Shaii Baig village, 2nd station. (35 minutes.) small, at £ a mile. At one mile or more, inline behind it, is ’Aliyawah, already mentioned, on a ridge which appears to run north-west and south-east. To the east-north-east at 1J miles is village Husain, 50 houses of Shair ’Amariyah Kurds. To the north-north-west at 3 miles, is Imam Bawa Mahmud, a tomb on a light-coloured mound. Two palm groves are visible, one on each side of the mound ; they belong to Mustafa Pasha of the Bajalan Kurds. Behind the groves is said to be a village, Bawa Palau or Bawa Falawi, 150 houses of miscellaneous Kurds. To the north-west by west is a village, Shaikh Hasan, 50 houses of Arabs. (This village is upon the road further on.) To the north-west by north, at about 10 miles, is the red peak of Marwari Hill, near Dakkah. We proceeded for 21 minutes to Shaikh Hasan village, before mentioned, and ascended a mound beside it. A few minutes before reaching it a branch of the Qulah canal was struck. To the north-west by west, at J of a mile, is a village, Shaikh Husain, 30 houses of Arabs. (All the Arabs in this region are 3rd station (Shaikh Hasan). (56 minutes.) Sunnis.) To the north-east at about 3 miles, are 3 small Kurdish villages. The peak of Marwari lies about north-west by north. We proceeded for 10 minutes, and stopped again. To the south-east is Khanaqui. To the south-west by west, at | of a mile, 4th Station. (1 hour 6 mmutoa.) j g Husain village, already mentioned. To the north at 1 or 1J miles, is Imam Bawa Mahmud, before mentioned. To the north by west, at 1J or 2 miles, is part of Bawa Palau (see above). ^ The rest of the village (about two-thirds) is nearer to the date groves. Marwari still lies to the north-west by north. C223GSB2 After 12 minutes we passed Imam Bawa Mahmud, lying | of a mile to the right of the road ; and 6 minutes later we passed the second of the two date groves already mentioned, lying £ a mile to right of road. After 14 minutes more we reached a mound called Bawa Taq, which is on the 5th Station (Bawa Taq). (1 hour 38 minu ea.) ri g ht ^ ° f th ® r0ad - F . r0m here from wes t to south-west he several small Arab villages at various distances. To the south-west by south, at about 2 miles, is a mound called Tall Mai Qulah. Most of this district is watered by the Qfilah canal; but Mustafa Pasha’s date groves are irrigated by a spring in the Marwari hill, which last begin near the groves in question. Clover, wheat and barley are the crops hereabouts. To the south by west, at 3 or 4 miles, is Falaiyah village, 50 houses of Arabs. The Hamrln hills are visible along the left front, from west-north-west to west-south west or rather further. After 20 minutes we reached some rising ground, and arrived at the top of it in 10 minutes more. Marwari peak was now seen to the north by west, at 3 or 3£ miles. After 11 minutes more we passed Bankan, a village belonging to Ibrahim Baig, Jaf Kurd, immediately to the left of the road. After 11 minutes more we reached Ghaznah Tappah, a light-coloured mound q . .. .p, , , OA on the right side of road. Here the Hamrin minutes.) hllis appear to extend along the horizon from west to south-west. To the west- north-west, at 2 miles, is a small Kurdish village, Mahmud Rosam. At an uncertain distance to the north-west Dakkah appears. Marwari peak is now slightly to west of north, and Khanaqin slightly to east of south-east. We reached Dakkah after 32 minutes. Sangar, a canal from the west, runs along the left side of the road throughout this part. It is 6 feet broad, and it had about 6 inches of running water in it. Just before reaching Dakkah are the ruins of a village which belonged to the father of Mustafa Pasha, Bajalan Kurd. Dakkah consists of about 60 houses of Jaf Kurds under Ibrahim Baig. (The 7th Station (Dakkah). (3 hours 2 minutes.) Kurds of the country are Bajalan from Khanaqm until the Jaf boundary is reach ed.) Marwari peak is now about 2 miles to the east-north-east. On the opposite side of the Diyalah river, from north-west to west, are the Ban Sanduq hills. (These are marked “ Karabulak ” in sheet 38 of the War Office map, and are shown there extending too far to the south ; they do not go further south than Dakkah.) Zangabad village appears across the Diyalah, to the west by south, at about 4 miles. We proceeded for 15 minutes through a thick growth of “ palk ”, a bush with round leaves varying in size between a shilling and a half-crown. Then we marched for 5 minutes over shingle to the edge of the Diyalah. From the Dakkah-Zangabad ferry (east bank) the Marwari peak bears east- north-east, at 3 or 4 miles. To the north- 8th Station (Dakkah-Zangabad ferry, east / ,, , - “ . r bank). (3 hours and 22 minutes -. Baggage took north-east apparently at 7 or 8 miles, is the a little over 4 hours.) village of Upper Qarah Bulaq consisting of 30 houses of Talabaniyah Kurds of Shaikh Taiyib’s section, with a red hillock. To the north, at about 5 miles, is Great Qarah Bidaq village with 50 or 60 houses of the same. Upper Qarah Bulaq is said to be on the west side of the Diyalah. I The only means of crossing the river on 18tb April 1910 was a single small 0 . , f n ,, , , y , kilik or raft, supported on 1°6 skins. * 6 It was said that there was no other ferry at all near, either up or down stream. The raft in crossing drifted | to f of a mile down stream, and reached the opposite side at the off-take of a~ canal, called Kashawul, leading in the direction of Zangabad. The breadth of the stream where it was narrowest, in crossing, was about 150 yards ; and the general direc tion of the river was from north to south. The ferrying over of two travellers with their servants and baggage took three hours, as the raft had to make more3 i than one journey. The cost was about 17 shillings. The unloaded mules crossed by themselves, swimming in one place, in a line more direct than that taken by the raft. From the landing place on the west bank Zangabad bore west-south-west and the Ban Sanduq hills extended round from 0 th Sstation (Dakkah-Zangabad ferry, west nor th-west to nearly north. Marwari peak bank). (6 hours 22 minutes.) r was still at east-north-east. The time taken from the landing place to Zangabad village was half an hour by riders and 40 minutes by baggage. The way lay across ordinary open ground and fields. The main village of Zangabad consists of about 200 houses of Zangabad Kurds, and there is a small suburb about J 10th Station (Zangabad). (7 or 7| hours.) 0 f &amp; m *j e wes t war d. There are a few Jews. The Kurdish inhabitants were friendly and accommodated us two Europ- pean travellers on the roof of a mosque. There are fine gardens here, belonging formerly to the Sultan’s Civil List, but now to the Turkish Government. Irriga tion is from two water-cuts; one on the east of the village, which perhaps* comes • My notes about these are not very clear. from the Diyalah, and One Oil the west J. G. L. known as the Saidalan Qarah Tappah- Zangabad, which may be be from the west. On this day’s journey we passed through some remarkably fine crops, with flowers of various sorts, including clover. Zangabad to SalahIyah (or Kifri). {19th Afrit 1901.) We proceeded for 25 minutes to Ban Sanduq village, 40 houses of Zangabad 1st Station (Ban Sanduq). (25 minutes.) Kurds, which is OB the road. From here Zangabad bore south-south-east, and a village Shaitapanah, 25 houses of Zangabad Kurds, west by south. In the plain, about one mile west of Zangabad, is Tappah Qran, a remarkable eminence like a Babylonian or Assyrian mound. Amidst the crops by the way stood wild hollyhocks in flower, and here and there a quail rose from them. \ After 15 minutes ipiore Zangabad lay to the south-east and Ban Sanduq village a little to the east of south-east, Qran Tappah 2nd station. (40 minute?.) ^ sou th-south-east, Shaitapanah to the south-south-west, at about 2 miles and Marwari peak to the east. (This station is on a neck of low hills. Just beyond it is a ruined village on the leftside of the road.) After 15 minutes we reached Tazashan village, 30 houses of Zangabad Kurds. After 12 minutes more we halted. From the place reached Zangabad lies a little east of south-east. A little 3rd Station, (i hour 7 minutes.) t° tlie west of south-south-west, at 1 mile, is Hajliar village, 70 houses of Zangabad Kurds. This village is a freehold property of Majid PUsha, Baban Kurd, who lives at Salahiyah. T&amp;zashan now bears about south-east. After 5 minutes we passed Kokaz village, 30 houses of Zangabad Kurds, on the left side of the road. After 15 minutes more we reached another station. From this point the last (3rd) station lies a little to the south of east- south-east. To the south-west by south 4th Station. (1 hour 27 minuter.) at jj milegj ig Ta p pah Ch armi hamlet, 7 houses of Zangabad Kurds. We proceeded for 23 minutes. All the way here from Ban Sanduq village there have been low hills immediately on right of the road.4 The last (4th) station now bears east-south-east by south. At south-west, at n ko ^ about 4 miles, is ti e tomb of Ibrahim Samim. 5th Station. (1 hour 50 minutes.) m xi -li. , i ^ lo the south-west by south, at about 3| miles, is Tappah ’Ali, a village of 40 houses of Zanganah Kurds. Two miles to the right of the road is an Arab village of 30 houses. On the left Jabal Hamrin runs from west-north-west to south-south-east. ^ e travelled for 25 minutes and reached Kushk, ruins and a mound, on ' the right of road. The tomb of Ibrahim Samim bears south-south-west, and Tappah \Ali village 6th Station (Kushk). (2 hour.^ 15 minutes.) South by West. Alter 4 minutes the dried-up bed of a water-course called Kodara was crossed. It is about 8 feet deep and 25 feet broad. This is the end of the Zangabad terri tories. After 50 minutes more we reached a station. From here the last station bears south-east by south. To the west-south-west, at 1 mile, is Zardao village, 120 houses of 7th station. (3 hours 9 minuter) Zanganah Kurds. To the north-west, at about 1 mile, is Tall Ishan, a village of 40 houses of Zanganah Kurds, on the road. The mound which gives its name to Tall Ishan is to the west at about 2 miles. To the west-north-west, at several miles distance, is Eski Kifri or Old Kifri. There is near this station, at a place called Salaishah, a garden belonging to Haji Husain son of Said Ahmad, of Kifri. The low hills on the right of the road are called hereabouts Chalao Kharit. To the north-north-east, through them, are visible other reddish hills called ShTrwanah. e marched for 23 minutes, crossing during the last 400 or 500 yards the shingly bed of the Zardao stream, and reached Tall Ishan village. The Zardao is formed at this place by the junction of a northern sweet stream from Salahiyah with another, not 8th station (Tali Ishan). (3 hours 32 minutes.) coming more from the eastwards. Each stream, at this time, was clear and a few feet broad, but quite shallow. The Zardao is said to run westwards from here for an hour or two, and to be expended in irrigation. So far as we have come from Khanaqin we have met with no real obstacle to artillery except the Diyalah river, which it would be difficult or impossible to get guns over, when in flood, without rafts or other means brought from a dis tance. This day a number of little ravines from the hills have intersected the road, few if any of them more than 12 feet deep or 20 feet broad, and probably all of them capable of being easily made passable for artillery. After 8 minutes we passed the mill of ’Abdul ’Aziz Agha of Qarah Tappah, who was at the time acting somewhere as a civil Mudir. From this mill the village of Tall Ishan lies south by west. After 12 minutes more we ascended a mound at the side of the road. The ground is hilly after leaving Tall Ishan. From this mound Tall Ishan lies a little to the west of south, and Salahiyah due north. To the north-east, at 2£ miles, 9th station. (3 hours 52 minutes.) j g Xainashimah village, 60 or 70 houses of Zanganah Kurds. To the east by north, at 3j miles, is Rahammarkah village, 100 houses of Zanganah Kurds. After 37 minutes through low hills, and never far from the bed of the stream on • ♦ * from Salahiyah, we reached Sarcham, v a temporary harvesters village on the road. The Qaim-Maqam of Salahiyah, Muhammad ’Ali, who is a brother of Mahmud Pasha, chief of the Jaf Kurds, met us here with about 20 mounted men. After 40 minutes riding we reached Salahiyah (or Kifri). After leaving Sar cham the way was chiefly over flat land, the hilly belt being left behind. Some cultivation, both irrigated and unirrigated, was noticed.0 5 SalaliTynh. consists, it is said, of about 800 houses ; and it has a good bazaar of about 80 shops.

(20th April 1910.) * \s a Turkish official and a tribal chief in After a visit to the Qaim-Maqam, who one Muhammad ’Ali’s position was difficult. wou hl no t talk politics,* WC Went to See He has since, I hear, been removed from the ^ Nasalah coal Workings, of which WC Turkish service. ^ G L ._3i.8-ii. had heard much. The workings are in the low hills to the east of Kifri; the exact direction could not be fixed' as the two places were not simultaneously visible from any point on the road. The first or older workings were reached in f of an hour from Kifri; they formed a Soup of 4, of which only one seemed of importance This one was in the shape of an°open qiarrv, the bottom of which was reached by a descending ramp about 20 yards long, the upright face of the quarry, consisting of coal of a sort, was about 15 feet high and 30 feet across. There were two openings in the ace, near The right side ; but there were two or three feet of water at the bottom of the Quarry and in the Openings, which made access inconvenient. There are said to be internal galleries running from 20 to 60 feet inwards. The workings fill up in the “ght with water which has to be cleared out in the morning. The coal is carried out of the pit in baskets or cloths. The coal seams in this group of work- cameaouLoiLu p , t- t ly from north-west to south-east. They are embedded m greyish clay and sand, and there is light-brown sandstone immedi ately around. 8 There is a single working 100 yards south-east of the group. To reach some newer workings we crossed the bed of the Nasalah stream To reach c Nasalah (40 houses of Jaf Kurds), beyond which they are Ttuated The bed of the stream is of shingle and about 200 yards broad with Thttfe flowing water. It is reached in a few minutes from the older workings. The digriMS behind Nasalah form an almost continuous cutting, which begins about f of a mile east of the village and runs for about 400 yards eastward One of* the Inhabitants 6 informed me that this apparent cutting was formed by the falling in of a long subterranean gallery, but the information seems doubtfu . could 8 never have been convenient to work such a long gallery so near to the sur face from the end only; there must at least have been manholes at intervals. At 40 minutes from the newer workings, to the north-east of Nasalah village, we sow the oldest coal working of all. It is an open cutting about 100 yards long From this last pit we regained the Nasalah stream in 12 minutes and crossed it above the village. C223GSBThe whole of this country is a system of sharp rocky ridges running north west by west and south-east by east. The angle of the strata to the horizon is about 30°. It is said that about 20 Waznahs of coal can be excavated in a day by 3 work men on a Qran each; 20 Waznahs is about 20 donkey-loads. (The local Waz- nah=60 Constantinople Huqqahs of 2-8326 lbs.=about 170 lbs. The Qran= about 4 pence.) These are the figures given us on the spot, but they cannot be guaranteed. The coal, it is said, can be delivered at Kifri, donkey hire included, at 7| Raij Paistres per donkey load, say at Z\d. per cwt. But to send it to Bagh dad on donkeys would cost a Majidi per Waznah more, or about 2s. 2|-d. additional. This would make the price at Baghdad about half-a-crown a cwt. or 50 shillings a ton, while foreign coal costs £3 and upwards a ton. Unfortunately the best Nasalah coal appears to be of very poor quality. I had a sample sent to Baghdad, but I could not get it to burn in an ordinary grate. The Nasalah pits began to be worked about 20 years ago, and at one time some coal from them used to reach Baghdad, but it did not apparently find favour, and it has ceased to be sent. In returning from the coal workings I climbed the hill of Bawa Shah Suwar, which overlooks the town of Salahiyah from the north and commands an excel lent view of the whole of it. On account of the shrine from which it takes the name, the hill and the slopes below it are a favourite burying ground of the inhabit ants. Salahiyah (or Kifri) to Tuz Khurmatu. {21st April 1912.) After marching for 2| hours from Salahlyah, say 7| miles, that place is. 1st station. (2 hours so minutes.) seen to bear east-south-east. The track is crossed here (at 7| miles) by a beaten road leading into the hills to the north : this road is said to conduct in 5 hours, say 15 miles, to a settlement of 1,000 households of Dawudlyah Kurds whose chief is Samim Beg. As seen from here the Hamrin hills occupy the horizon from west-south-west to south-south east. In the valley between the Salahlyah-Tuz Khurmatu track and the Hamrin hills numerous encampments of Arabs of the tribe (or class) called Biyat are to be found at this season. Further on, about 10 miles from Salahiyah, there is a hill on the right with 2nd station. (3 hours 20 minutes.) a ^hite patch on it, called Gharrah. Beyond this point (Gharrah) the Biyat encamp ments to the left are more distant than before. At about 14 miles from Salahiyah we separated from our baggage caravan. „ , ^ , . — . . . Sofar aswehad come on the way from Sala- 3rd Station. (4 hours, 40 mmutes.) h;yah ^ had been ^ hill / accompany . ing the road on the right hand; these rose from 100 to 150 feet above the plain, and the fall of the strata of which they were composed seemed to be from the side next the road backwards. On the left, all the way, had been meadows sloping down into the valley between us and Jabal Hamrin ; and a line of telegraph had followed the road closely on that side. At the point now reached there was a large village of Biyat due south some miles off, and another south-south west not quite so far away. The baggage continued along the road outside the hills and reached Tub Khurmatu in 8 hours 20 minutes from Salahiyah, making the distance about 25 miles. About 5 miles before reaching its destination the baggage passed a Biyat village of 100 households, 2 miles to the left of the road, which was called Khasradalah.7 ci We ourselves turned into the hills on the right in search of son^.e well-known oil springs, and found them at least after Abu Sarkai Oil Springs. much wandering in a maze of rugged ridges and valleys. There are about 7 borings altogether, situated on the two sides of a small ravine at a place called Abu Sarkai. By them stands a small tower for defence. At no great distance, man open plain in the hilts, were encamp ed two households of Na’aim Saiyids, whose head is Saiyid Muhammad-bin-Jasim. These people, who had been settled here for about 13 years, received us hospit ably and guided us to the oil spiings : without their help we should never have found them. While searching for the springs, before this, we came on some interest ing rock dwellings, neatly cut in the faces of low cliffs. The springs are said to yield about 10 donkey loads of oil daily, and the load sells for 2 shillings to 2 shillings and 4 pence at Tuz Kkurmatu. The principal pit is about 15 feet in diameter and 25 or 30 feet deep, and the oil is brought up in goat skins by men who clamber down for it. From Abu Sarkai a regular beaten track, made by the oil caravans, leads to Tuz Khurmatu ; the distance is about Abu Sarkai to Tuz Khurmatu. g miles. Just before reaching the village the Tuz Khurmatu Chai (or stream) is crossed; when we passed, the water in it was deep, clear, and abundant, but animals could walk through. Tuz Khurmatu (the name means “ Salt and Dates ”) consists of about 600 houses and has probably about 3,000 inhabitants. Some 20 households are Jews, the rest are Turks who have been settled here from of old. The place is (or was at the time of our visit) a Radif centre. Tuz Khurmatu. The refining of the oil from the adjacent hills is a' local industry of some little importance. Of about 20 stills situated in a place outside the town we found 6 working. The oil springs belonged to the Civil List of the late Sultan. The Tuz Khurmatu oil goes to Salahiyah, Kirkuk and Sulaimanlyah, and occasionally as far as Musal. Water obtained from a spring on the side of the Chai further from the town is evaporated for salt, and there is a Mudir of the Public Debt at Tuz Khurmatu to watch the operations. In 1909 the salt taken from here amounted to 400,000 kilos, and the selling rate was 41 Gsp. per 100 kilos. (108 Gsp.=£l stg.). It was disposed of in the neighbouring places such as Kirkuk, Sulaimanlyah and Salahiyah. The Mudir of Tuz Khurmatu, which is a Nahiyah, was a very self-sufficient youth of the “ Union and Progress ” type : name Tauflq Effendi. He said that the pen was more powerful than the sword, but that the stick was more effect ive than either ; and therewith he exhibited some apparatus which he kept for inflicting the bastinado. It was noticeable that every one salaamed to him with great care when he passed through the bazaar. Tuz Khurmatu to Daquq. (22nd April 1910.) At about 5 miles from Tuz Khurmatu the road is rising; it has been rising , „ . , for some time, but it has not yet reached its 1st Station. (1 hour 40 minutes.) ^ • i ,• nn ■ l i, ' maximum elevation, lo the souch-west by west, at 2 or 3 miles, is the village of A1 Bii Sabah, 200 houses of Dawudah (or Dawudiyah) Kurds ; and, near by, a path from it to the Dawudiyah settlements —see diary of yesterday—crosses the Tuz Khurmatu-Daquq track. Tuz Khurmatu is to the south-east from here. The Hamrin hills, as seen from here, fill the horizon from west to south-west. Just beyond this the hills on the right of the road, here about called Dawudiyah, converge towards the road and die away ; but mounds continue near the road for 3 miles further. (N. B.—Troops moving along the Khanaqin-Kirkuk road might be annoyed from the hills close to the road on its8 north-east side almost all the way from Khanaqin to the present station. The crossing of the Diyalah might also be made difficult.) At about 7 miles from Tuz Khurmatu the highest part of the ground is reached. At about 8 miles there is a mound on the right side of the road. At about 9 miles the bed of a stream called Khuri Chai is crossed ; it is considered the half-way place between Tuz Khurmatu and Daquq. The name means dry stream”, but there were a few pools in the bed at which we watered our animals. Some half mile further on a second Khuri Chai, about 100 yards wide, is encountered ; it is said to unite with the first a little further down {i.e. to the west). The second halting place was reached in two hours from the first. From it the mound at 8 miles from Tuz Khurmatu 2nd Station. (3 hours 40 minutes.) bears south-east; Daquq is to the north west ; and to the north-west by west is a fort of Namuk Agha, Dawudlyah Kurd, by which 1,000 houses are said to be protected. Half an hour later a third halt was made, and Tuz Khurmatu was found to bear about south-south-east while Namuk 3rd station. (4 hours io minutes.) Agha’s village wasto the west-south-west at 2 or 3 miles distance. There are hills to the north-east, but they are now distant and not high. After 50 minutes’ going the top of a long rise on the road is attained. Daquq lies ahead to the north-west by north, 4th Station. (5 hours.) an( i Tuz Khurmatu behind to the south- south-east. To the east at 1 mile, is the village of Shorawah, consisting of 50 houses of Dawudlyah Kurds. To the w^est is a conspicuous mound, about 3 miles off • a grove of trees lies somewhat nearer and a little to the north of west ; and at this grove is said to be a_village called Iftighar, which comprises 300 houses of Kurds subject to Namuk Agha. Fifty minutes further on a ruined tower and house on a mound are met with. J Here on the left of the road is a small canal, 5th Station. (5 hours 50 minutes.) about 6 feet wide, flowing from the west. At our visit it had a rapid flow and the water was brownish-pink, being no doubt from the Daquq Chai, which was in flood. About quarter of a mile from the tower the shingle bed of the Daquq Chai, about 800 yards wide, was reached. Ine Daquq Chai. village of Daqfiq lies about 1 mile beyond the further bank. In consequence of rain the day before the Chai was in flood, and its brown water filled three separate channels, of which one was about 40 yards wide The baggage crossed, but probably could not have done so.a few hours earlier At the Daquq Chai the territory of the Dawudlyah Kurds ends, and that of the Talabaniyah begins. The latter are accounted Saiyids, but they are turbulent and predatory. The baggage reached Daquq from Tuz Khurmatu in just under 7 hours; the distance between the places is thus, Daquq. (6 hour 50 minutes.) allowing for delays in crossing the Chai about 19 miles. Just before entering the village there is some hi ah 5 ground on the left, upon which stands a minaret of an old mosque that has disappeared. About l£ miles to the north-east of Daquq can be seen the shrine of Zain-al-’Abidm, with one large and three small white domes, and a few houses of Saiyids beside it. This shrine and the old^minaret al ready mentioned are conspicuous for some miles before reaching Daquq. The Mudir of Daquq, which is a Nahiyah, was a veteran of the Kusso-Turkish war. He seemed to have no ideas, nor even any words. Such as he and the Mudir of Tuz Khurmatu are the feet of clay on which the simulacrum of Turkish authority in the Orient rests.9 Daquq to Kirkuk. {23rd April 1910.)

The town of Kirkuk stands up boldly as one approaches it; part of it C223GSB10 is built on a large hill which is probably artificial in spite of its size. The popula tion of Kirkuk is estimated at 40,000 to 50,000 souls ; and, out of 4,000 houses, 200 are said to belong to Jews and 200 to Christians. The exports are wool, gall- nuts, wheat, barley, gum tragacanth, and a little wine. Halt at Kirkuk. (24th April 1910.) A small river from the northern hills, at the time of our visit a nearly dry shingle bed, passes the west side of the town and divides it from an important suburb on the west side. The latter contains the Sarai, military barracks, mili tary hospital, municipal buildings, post and telegraph office, and a school. There are numerous mills on the stream ; and it is spanned, between the town and the official suburb, by a fairly good bridge of 15 arches with a roadway 12 feet wide. A flowing canal runs through part of the town of Kirkuk proper, passing by the east side of the fort, or elevated part of the town. The town appeared to have about 500 shops, but the Mutasarrif (’Aun Ullah Bey) professed to know that there were exactly 1,822. The Mutasarrif, whose guests we were while at Kirkuk, gave us an account of the Hamawand tribe, then in rebellion against the Government and living across the Persian border, from his point of view. He said that the only cure for the trouble that they caused was to kill them off. The Hamawand have about 10 prominent chiefs, each of whom has a considerable following. These chiefs quarrel among themselves, but they make common cause against the Govern ment. The neighbouring tribes fear and dislike the Hamawand, but cannot be induced to take proper action against them. An edict issued by the Mutasarrif, in which he threatened to burn the houses of any who harboured the Hamawand had produced some effect; but there are a million ways by which the Hama wand can enter the country; they know every inch of the ground, and they can move by night as well as by day. They own no immoveable property capable of being seized or destroyed. They live by plunder, and they will be perfectly well able to subsist in Persia. Even the capture of their women, if this could be effected, would be a matter of indifference to them. Formerly they lived about Sulaimaniyah and raided about Kirkuk ; now they w~ere settled in Persia and raided about Sulaimaniyah. The latter place was still open to them owing to the apathy of the Mutasarrif. “ Divided authority was a bad thing ” (i.e., Sulaimaniyah should be placed under the Mutasarrif of Kirkuk). From other sources we learned that the Hamawand tribe numbered only about 200 mounted men; but that about 300 other horsemen, of associated tribes, etc., were accustomed to w r ork wfith them. All raids and robberies committed, including many by the Talabanlyah, 'were now put down to the Hamawand, they being notorious outlaws. (The Hamawands were pardoned a few months after this and nothing has been heard of them since.) The population of Kirkuk is mixed : there are more Turks than Kurds, and more Kurds than Arabs. Baba Gurgur. (2oth April 1910.) Baba Gurgur, which was visited during our halt at Kirkuk, is in some low hills a little to the right of the Kirkuk-Altun Koprii road at 4 or 5 miles from Kir kuk. The place itself is a slight hollow on some high ground ; it is about 50 yards11 long and 20 yards broad, and there are some 20 vents of natural gas in it. At the time of our visit these were alight, as they generally are, unless artificially exting uished. if one of the vents be stopped with earth, the gas usually escapes at some other place near by where it can be lighted with a match. A kettle can con\ eniently be boiled on any of the burning vents, and Baba Gurgur is said to be a favourite picnic place in spring for the merchants and military garrison of Kirkuk. There is a strong smell of sulphur about. ^ on direction, but quite near the road, is a group of 4 or 5 oil pits called Biar (wells) : they are the property of Salih Pasha, absent at Constantinople at the time of our visit, and are said to yield 8 donkey loads (say 32 tins) of crude oil daily. The pits are situated on a slight hill and are 12 to lo feet deep. The water is separated from the oil at the wells and the oil is afterwards refined at Kirkuk. There is a sulphurous spring in the hills, a little further m than the oil pits. Closely adjoining the official suburb of Kirkuk on its north side, on the way to Baba Gurgur, is the considerable village of Shatarli with about 200 houses. It has an old leaning minaret. . Kirkuk the date tree has already ceased to occur, and the olive has made its appearance. We are approaching the temperate zone. Vines, limes, figs apricots, mulberries, willows, etc., are to be seen.

Chogh, seemingly double-peaked, appears . . , to the west-north-west. The distance to it, across the plain, did not look more than 10 or 12 miles; but, according to the map, it is really 25 miles off or more. ° After 23 minutes’ going along the top of the outermost ridge of the hills, 2nd station, (l hour 43 minute,.) which form a series of parallel ridges one were obtained behind the other, the following bearings further side oTthe'^^ 636 ' ^ &amp; ^ diStanCe&gt; Jabal Makh5l &gt; ahil &gt; ™ the ^ by south at l£ miles, Bajiwan, a village of 30 hon&lt;?p&lt;? nf aj iwan Kurds, and close to it an encampment of Sawamirah Arabs, shepherds TuStaT** b ’ “ * l, “ t * niI “' * 'Ol-P .1120 To the west at 2£ miles Chdprijah, a village of 100 houses of Turkmans.

The rocks hereabout are sandstone.12 After 20 minutes more a ravine is crossed where there is water and a gendar- ' 4th station (Khan-an-Naft). (2 hours 27 merie post (Nuqtah) called Khan-an-Naft. minutes.) From here the road again turns to north west by north. Five minutes before reaching this place was an encampment of ’Obaid Arabs, shepherds. From Khan-an-Naft the road runs in a generally north by west direction for miles to the top of the second or inner 5th station (Pass). (Say 3 hours.) ridge of hills. On surmounting this pass a magnificent view is suddenly obtained of a plain beyond, draining north-west to the Little Zab. In the distance are magnificent lines of mountains, some of which, when we saw them, w'ere snow-covered. A dark-coloured mountain due north was pointed out as that overhanging Shaqlawah, which we afterwards visited ; to the left of it, and not so far off, was a long hill of a reddish colour. Snow moun tains extending round from north by east to north-east, were said to be in the neigh bourhood of Raniyah. To the east-north-east was a large mountain, also covered with snow, which was described to us as adjoining Sulaimamyah. The following villages were observed from the pass :— To the north-east by east Kalwur, 30 houses of (Kalwur) Shawan Kurds. To the east north-east Daraman-al-’Uliyah, 40 houses of Shawan Kurds. To the east by north Daraman-as-Sufla, 30 houses. The next stage is a descent from the pass to the broad valley beyond them ; and the next station is reached in about 40 minutes. Kalwur village lies | of a mile due north from here ; and to the north-north east, at 1,000 yards off the road, there is 6th Station. (3 hours 40 minutes.) a conspicuous mound. Ten minutes later Kalwur village is passed; it lies J a mile to the right of the road. Ten minutes after Kalwur we arrive at another station. Looking back from this point we see the pass crossed at the 5th station lying to the south-south-east. To the north by 7th station. (4 hours.) ^ ^ m jj e&gt; j g Bibani Zghaiyir, a hamlet of 15 houses. To the north-east by north, at about 3 miles, is Bibani Zardak, a village of 20 houses of Bibani Kurds. To the north-east by east, at about 4 miles, is B bani Kab r, a village of 60 houses of B bani Kurds. The road ahead seems to run north-west by north. The hills crossed between the 1st and 5th stations are seen still running parallel to the road on its left side. On the right across the plain, at a distance of several miles, is a reddish-coloured range of hills larger than those on the left. The telegraph line, which before crossing the pass was on the right of the road, is now on the left. In an hour and 25 minutes, moving north-w T est, we arrived at a place on the road J of a mile to the north of which is a prominent mound called Gok Tappah. To the west-south-west from here, at 1 mile, is a village Nabi Awah, consisting of 30 houses of Kurds. Here, or a little * fur ther on, the following obervations were taken. To the west-south-west at about 1J miles, Gurzai, a village of 60 houses of Sawalih or Salihi Kurds. 8th Station (Gok Tappah). (5 hours 25 minutes.) ♦ There is an unfortunate omission in my notes at this point. I think that the bearings which follow were taken not far beyond Gck Tappah. J. G. L. To the north-east by east, at about 2 miles, Gawani, a village of 70 houses of Sawalih. To the east-north-east, at about 2j miles, Qadir Baghir, a village of 80 houses of Sawalih. To the west, at about 3 miles, Kitkah or Kikkah, a village of 100 houses of Sawalih. To the north by west, at about 2 miles, Galoziyah, a village of 150 houses of Sawalih.0 13 There are said to be about 30 villages of Sawalih or Salilii Kurds in all. The chief of the tribe is one 'Abdul Karim, who lives at a place called Sarbid. At 25 minutes beyond the place where the preceding observations were taken a small clear stream in a shingly bed is crossed. The Kurds call it Galal and the Turks Injesui. At 13 minutes further on, two small canals, spanned by small bridges, traverse the road. From this place Kitkah or Kikkah, already mentioned, bears south-west 8th Station. (6 hours 3 minutes.) and is about 2 miles off. To the east-north- east, at about miles, is Saibirau, a vil lage of 80 houses of Sawalih. After 20 minutes a broad depression without a stream is reached : it is fol lowed by a stony ascent. After 15 minutes a small dry shingly ravine, called Wishkakhan in Kurdish and Qarah Chai in Turkish, is crossed. In 15 minutes more a point is reached from which the whole way to Altun 10 th Station.

Twenty-five minutes later the bridge which gives its name to Altun Koprii Altun Koprii. (7 hours is minutes); b't Gold Bridge is reached, and the town, the baggage animals took 91 hours over this which begins immediately at its further day’s stage.) end, is entered. The Lower Zab is divided at Altun Koprii into two branches, an eastern and a western, of which the former is the more considerable. The main town, con sisting of about 350 houses, is situated on the head of the island enclosed be tween them. The western branch dries up altogether after the spring floods ; and the eastern branch then becomes fordable above and below (but not at) the town. The main stream, when we saw it, was about 40 yards broad; and the bridge, which is of one span, and very high and pointed, then rose about 50 feet above the water. This bridge, which is extraordinarily steep and difficult of ascent from both sides, is cursed by the muleteers of all the country-side for killing their animals; but the boys of the town enjoy diving ofi it feet foremost. The water under the bridge is said to be very deep. On the eastern side of the main stream is a detached suburb of the town called Mahallah Sulahi, which consists of about 70 houses of Arabs, Kurds, and others. On the west side of the western branch is another detached suburb, called Mahallah TisTn, of about 70 houses of mixed tribes. This suburb is connected with the main town by a bridge less remarkable than that over the main Zab. The two streams of the Zab re-unite about f of a mile below the place where they separate ; and a little below their junction, on the right bank of the river is the small mixed Turkish and Arab hamlet of Kaiyabashi with about a dozen houses. Kaiyabashi lies nearly due south of the bridge over the main Zab. The direction of the river near the town is about north-east by north and south-west by south. In the whole town there are about 50 shops and one public bath. Trade is mostly in wheat and barley, which are exported and floated down the Zab and Tigris on rafts. There is an export, bat small, of wool, and of timber brought by river from the hills. c The inhabitants of Altun Koprii are mostly Turks, and Turkish is the pre vailing language. (The settled Turks of this part of the country are Turkmans and are said to talk a Turkmani dialect; they are not ’Osmanlis.) C223GSB14 Altun Kopru to ArbIl. (27th April 1910.) The road from Altun Kopru to Arbil runs at first, after leaving the former place, up the valley of a small tributary of the Lower Zab. This stream is called the Injesui. There are corn lands m the valley and low hills on either side A bend of the Injesui was crossed at 28 minutes and another at 32 minutes from A tun Kopiu, and a third was touched at about 35 minutes. There ware at this time only a few inches of water in the stream. In 13 minutes more an eminence is reached, from which Altun Koprii bears First Station. (48 minutes.) about south-south-east. The Musal road the hills, is now seen about half a milfo^olhe westward!' 8 The teTeS to Arbil is also on the left hand side of the road that we are following Between us and the Musal road is a mill, and beyond that road is a hamlet called Makhsu mah, consisting of 12 houses of Kurds. 1 U MakllS11 '' f A L l \ be y° 1 nd tbe first station the telegraph line (two wires) crosses from the left to the right of the road. In 18 minutes more we reach the second station at the top of a shingly ascent, just before which there is a dip into a hot low and a bend of the Injesui is touched. The valley of the Injesui and the Musal road now disappear to the left. J n Musal Altun Kopru still lies to the south-south-east. To the west by south, at 2nd Station.

There were also a number of more distant villages, and some black tents were seen scattered about. The road ahead appeared to run north by west The country is a plain, or very wide valley, shut in by ranges of hills on the right and left of the road which seem to run about north-west and south-east These rano-P* must be about 20 miles apart. ges There is said to be no leading chief among the Dizzai Kurds ; but Ahmad Pasha, son of Husain Agha, is recognised by the Turkish Government as tbrir official head. This individual is said to live at a village on a long ridge about 10 miles west-south-west of this place (Qush Tappah), near the Musal road Other prominent men among the Dizzais are Ibrahim Agha, son of Baiz and Mahmrid Agha, son of Kaka Khan, who resides at Girdmalah. ’ llmud 9th Station (Qarachan Agha Tappahchi). (7 hours 31 minutes.) (N.B .—For the stage ending at this station the time taken by the baggage has been adopt ed.) The next station, Qarachanf Agha Tap pahchi, is 2 hours 45 minutes beyond that of Qush Tappah. From it the following observations were taken:— to the south by east, the two last stations and Altun Koprii; to the west by north at 2 miles, Timar, a village of 20 Dizzai houses ; to the east, at 1 mile, Qarachan Agha, a village of 25 Dizzai houses; to the north by west, Arbil. About 1 mile from the Qarachan station a small stream was crossed, and im- Arbn. (io hours 6 minutes.) mediately afterwards a little dry* hollow • Time adopted for last stage into Arbil ne ar the latter, close to the right, was a village called Little Hamwarkah. We could not take observations from here to Arbil as a guard of honour had come out to meet us. 10 (N.B. is that taken by baggage.) Arbil, like Kirkuk, stands partly on a huge artificial hill, of prehistoric construction, and makes a bold feature as it rises above the plain. It is in fact * Perhaps “ Kush ”. f Perhaps “ Karachan *’' 16 / of more striking appearance than Kirkuk, the Fort (or elevated part) being more compact, and the buildings in it of a better sort. From the Arbil Fort an old minaret lies to the west-south-west, just outside the town. To the south-east at 1| miles is Badawah, a village of 50 houses of Dizeai Kurds. At Kirkuk we met Ibrahim Agha, the chief of the Dizzai Kurds. Arbil is said to consist of 1,800 houses of Turks and Kurds. The water of the town is all from ponds. The Qaza } T ields a large surplus revenue, which is sent to Kirkuk. The land taxes are said to produce £T. 90,000 a year, of which one-third is from lands for merly belonging to the Sultan’s Civil List. The yield could be greatly increased by irrigation from the Zab. The entire way from Altun Koprii to Arbil we had fields of wheat and barley on both sides of the road ; but not a single tree was to be seen. The harvest was an exceptional one. ArbIl to Shaqlawah. {28th April 1910.) The road to Shaqlawah from Arbil runs at first across open plains. After 52 minutes Arbil lies to the south-west by south ; so does Bairkdd village, \ /co • * \ passed 5 minutes previously, on the west 1 st station (Bairko appa i. mmu s j^ e of the road from Arbil. Bairkod con sists of 10 houses of Gardi Kurds. Between Bairkod and the station, just before reaching the latter, a small hollow descending from the right to the left of the road is crossed. To the west, slightly north, a village is pointed out w^hich is said to be ’Ain Oahwah 300 houses of Oriental Christians, distant f of an hour by road from Arbil; this is no doubt the “ Ankowa ” of the War Office map. Somewhat west of south are the Qarah Chogh hills, already observed on the wav from Kirkuk to Altun Koprii. As now seen they form two masses, of wffiich that to the right is called Qarah Chogh Harqi, and that to the left Qarah Chogh Bulbadh. They are said to be nine hours by road from Arbil. To the east-north-east is the main peak of the long black range which was first sighted on the way Kirkuk to Altun Koprii: it is Safin. A nearer and lower range bounds the plain of Arbil in the same direction and is called Dulopa. After 33 minutes the next station is reached. To the north-north-west, distant about f of a mile, is Pirzin, a vil- 2 nd station, (i hour 25 minute .) lage of 50 houses of Gardi Kurds. To the east-south-east, isPirrash, a village of 40 houses of Dizzai Kurds. At the foot of the first hills to eastward are various temporary encampments of Gardi Kurds of the Zaid Baigi section.

From here Arbil lies south west Looking west-north-west we see two masses of hill beyond the Zab River : r -to the right of the line of vision is Maqlub, that to the left Chazardak, and the latter is said to be 7 hours distant from where we are. To the east-north-east, at f .of a mile, is Malta ’Umar, a village of 25 houses of Gardi Kurds. To the east, at 1 mile, is Shawak, a village of 25 houses of Gardi Kurds.17 To the north-north-east is the Galiyawah Pass, which will be mentioned again. In 30 minutes we arrive at the next station, having passed at 16 minutes through the village of Malla ’Umar, already Cth station. (2 hours 46 mmute.?.) mentioned, where were a few mulberries, the first trees not growing artificially in gardens that we had seen for 100 miles. We wait at the station till the baggage comes up. Caravans carrying fnewood and even timber indicate our approach to hills where trees grow in some quantity. To the west-north-west, at a distance said to be 4 hours’ journey, is Gird ’Araq, a fort on a mound, inhabited by 20 households of Gardi Kurds. To the west, at an estimated distance of 1^ or 2 hours’ journey, is Baharki,* * This ia evidently the “Bahirka” of the War a village of 150 houses of Gardi Kurds, Office map. where Kakil Agha, the head of the Gardi tribe, has his abode. (We learn incidentally that he has lately given a daughter in marriage to a son of Ahmad Pasha of the Dizzai tribe and has been paid £ T. 600 for her.) Arbil is still to the south-west. We have now been 10 days in contact with Kurds. After experience of the Wazirs, Mahsuds, Afridis and other hill tribes on the North-West Frontier of India it is impossible to regard the Kurds whom we have seen as at all ferocious, or to help suspecting that the opinion of the Kurdish character which prevails at Baghdad is rather a proof of the effeminacy of the Baghdadi himself. The Kurds met so far are more intelligent than the brutish Arabs of Mesopotamia, but less self-assertive and vivacious than Pathans, and less deferential than Panjabis. Marching with the baggage we reach another station (the 6th) in 32 minutes. Here we have done with the outer hills or 6th station. (3 hours is minutes.) Hanarah Daghi, bounding the Arb'l plain, to the summit of which we have gradually risen ; and we begin suddenly to descend into the valley of the Bastorah stream which divides them from the inner hills. The stream is the administrative boundary between the Qazas of Arbil and Koi Sanjaq. On the other side of the Bastorah to the north-east, at 1J miles, is the village of Donguzawah, 20 houses of Korrai Kurds. Half a mile from it, to north-east by north from the present station, is Saiwakah, a village of 15 houses with a fort on a mound. The range beyond the valley is crossed, within our view, by 3 passes: viz .— the “ Galiyawah,” to the north-north-east, leading to Bowanduz and Shaq- lawah; the “Shaqlawah,” to the north-east, by which we are to cross, leading to Shaqlawah ; and the “ Saiwakah,” to the north-east by east. The range beyond the Bastorah is called the Shaqlawah Hills; but it is only a spur of the great moun tain, to be mentioned hereafter, on the further slopes of which Shaqlawah village is situated. The baggage reached the foot of the descent to the Bastorah in 22 minutes _ . L . and crossed the stream. The bed, about 80 40 mmu« , On ‘ h &lt;3 ^ y“d S wide, was stony. The largest channel was the first one crossed ; at the time it was only about 6 yards wide and the water 1 foot deep, but the flow of the current was very rapid. The next station was reached, 35 minutes after crossing the Bastorab, bv an q,i q, .• .. , &gt; s ascending path. From it Saiwakah bore 8 th btation.

C223GSB18 Forty minutes walking uphill brings the traveller to another observation Qth station. (4 hours 55 minutes.) point. ^ The surface of the track is rough, otherwise the ascent is not difficult. From this station Arbll lies to the south-west, but the nearer half of the road thence bears south-west by south. To the south-south-west is Donguzawah village. Near by, to the left of the road, is Saiwakah fort, a square stone erection with bastions; it may be conjectured to have belonged, in times past, to robber barons who levied blackmail on the traffic over the passes between the plains and the hills. . Hanarah Daghi, the range crossed before fording the Bastorah, has its highest point to the south, and dies away into the plains to the west-south-west. The Bastorah is seen to go westwards to the Zab River, which is also visible. There is a good spring in a hollow just above Saiwakah village. In 21 minutes more the top of the pass is reached by walking. From it the loth Station. (5 hours 16 minutes.) peak of Safin bears about east at an ap parent distance of 8 or 10 miles. Shaq- lawah village is not visible, but its direction is pointed out as east-north-east. Ahead is a white-coloured ridge with a notch in it to the left of east-north east, and through this notch appears a red range beyond. Descending from the pass we reach the bottom of another valley, with a stream, , . in 44 minutes. The track is stonv and rough. On the far side of the stream two villages are visible. These are to the east, at COO yards, Korrai, 50 houses of Hoshnau (or Aushnau) Kurds ; and to the north-west, at 1 mile, Hasan Mawilawi, 30 houses of the same. The chief man of the former village is Ahmad Amin Agha.’ The pass which we have crossed lies behind, about south-south-west. We now find ourselves amidst vegetation of entirely new sort. About Korrai there are tall poplars and willows, and the fences or hedges are w r attled. The baggage caravan passes Korrai village, to its right, 10 minutes after cross- 12th Station (Darband Safin,. (» honn, 37 !f g ^ and , 27 minUteS later minutes.) ^ enters Darband Safin, the gorge in the wdiitish ridge already mentioned, with a stream from the Safin hill coming down through it. Korrai village is on the fur ther (or south) side of the Sal In stream, wdiich is either identical with the Korrai stream already crossed or else a right bank affluent of it. Korrai lies w^est-south- west of the Darband or gorge. The air begins to be laden with an intoxicating fragrance of hawthorn (in Kurdish “ jaiwij ”), reminiscent of home; and a thunderstorm is gathering with European suddenness. In 18 minutes from the Darband the baggage caravan reaches Hujaran, a vil- 13th station (Hujaran). (6 hours 55 minutes.) ^ 15 houses of Hoshnau Kurds, imme- &gt; diately on the right of the road. Here a valley is seen running up into the hills to the right; and at the head of it on its north side, is the principal peak of Safin. ’ A few minutes further on we reached a grove of trees, where we sheltered for Sha^lawah. (8 hours 20 minutes.) half an hour from a violent thunderstorm, . accompanied by heavy rain. After the thunder was o\ er, the ram still continuing, w^e w r ere obliged by the approach of night to push on. After 10 minutes w^e reached the top of a small pass from which the Darband behind lay to the south-south-west, while the road ahead turned east in the direction of Shaqlawah. Partly through heavy mud partlv over wet ground, we reached Shaqlawah in an hour and 20 minutes, without baggage and wet to the skin. Owing to variation of pace according to the nature of the road and to the gathering dark, I cannot estimate the distance traversed in this time The time of arrival of the weary baggage caravan which plodded for much longer through mud and darkness is also no criterion ’ (The topography of the War Office map beyond Korrai, no doubt “ Kora ” seems to be conjectural. Shaqlawah village really lies on the northern, not on the southern, side of the Shaqlawah mountain ; and its position is, I should say a good deal further to the east than that assigned to it in the map. Moreover Shaqlawah. \ 19 mountain appears to be simply the highest peak of the Safin Range, not a separate range divided from the latter by a great valley. The diagram above gives a rough idea of the topography as it appears to a passing traveller. This much is certain that Shaqlawah is to the north of the main watershed hereabouts, while Korrai is south of it.) Shaqlawah. {19th April 1910.) I spent the next day in climbing and trying to shoot on the Shaqlawah moun tain behind the village. There is only one way up the mountain from the neighbourhood of the Shaqlawah mountain. villa g e ' the n0rtl1 faC « ° f the hil1 bein g v ery precipitous. Even on this, the usual path used by the villagers, there is a piece of rock-climbing for 40 or 50 feet where hands must be used, and where articles carried have to be passed from one man to another. On this path is the cell of Yusuf Rahman, a former Christian hermit; it is a natural cave in a precipice, fronted and sub-divided internally by artificial walls ; and it is resorted to and venerated by Muhammadans as well as Christians. The top of the Shaqlawah mountain can hardly be described as a plateau, though it is open and not very rugged, for it declines rapidly from east to west and is cleft longitudinally by a great ravine going down westwards—possibly the upper part of that which comes out at Darband Safin near Korrai. Being intent on sport I did not quite reach the top of the mountain, which I now regret, especially as I found none of the wild goats or leopards which I was told were numerous. In one place I saw, on damp ground, what seemed to be recent marks of a leopard. On the higher parts of the hill the snow was still lying in large patches, and there were quantities of red tulips and some yellow primroses in flower. The Kurds are unsatisfactory, both as huntsmen and mountaineers, in com parison with the hillmen of India. I found them very lazy and by no mean intelligent, noisy at the beginning of the day, and readily succumbing to difficulties and fatigue. The village could only supply one man, a Kurdish gendarme, who knew anything about game animals and their habits. Judged by Indian stan dards even he was a very mediocre shikari, being hasty and careless.20 Shaqlawah village is situated on the talus below the northern precipices of the mountain. Magnificent clear springs aqlawah vi age. burst from the hill side and water abun dantly the orchards, vineyards, and woods which extend downwards from the village into a valley that passes across its front from west to east. There are 230 houses of Muhammadans (Kurds), 130 of Christians (Chaldsean Catholics), and 5 of Jews. The Jews are weavers ; the Muhammadans and Chris tians are cultivators and muleteers and also weave cloth. There are three Chal- daean Catholic priests in the Christian community. Poplars are grown for the sake of the wood which they yield, and there are other large trees. I noticed 3 great planes (chinars) of which the smallest was 18 feet in circumference, also a mulberry with a girth of 13 feet. Cereals grown are wheat, barley, mash, and arzan ; there are also cotton, sesame and a little tobacco ; fruits include grapes, apples, pears and mulberries. There are 5 flour mills worked by the water of the springs. Notwithstanding all these resources the place has a poverty-stricken appearance. The Amir or principal man of the village was Bayazid Baig, a Khushnau Kurd, who seemed well-to-do and still enjoyed a considerable measure of feudal authority. The Turkish Mudir of Shaqlawah, a Rumelian named Taufiq, had evidently no local influence and seemed rather a dependent and protege of the Amir ; nevertheles8 r he was the thin end of one of the many wedges with which the Committee of Union and Progress Government were seeking to break up local autonomy. The Amir’s eldest son was Mahmud Baig, a lad of about 17. The Amir made us his guests and treated us with much attention during our stay. He appeared, unfortunately, to be afflicted with dropsy or some similar disease. Shaqlawah is occasionally used as a summer resort by Europeans at Musal who can get away from there for a few days. It can be reached from Musal in three marches, viz., two to Arbil and one beyond. I spoke to Nazim Pasha, Governor- General of Baghdad, afterwards about Shaqlawah, and he seemed at one time to have some idea of making a summer station and opening a telegraph office there; but nothing was done. The place is at present too inaccessible for a regular summer station; but if the Baghdad Railway were carried through Arbil (as it ought to be) instead of down the west side of the Tigris, Shaqlawah would be brought within 24 hours of both Baghdad and Musal, and the whole summer life and habits of the wealthier classes in Mesopotamia and of the higher Turkish officials would probably be changed. But officialdom in Turkey has no imagination, and without imagination there can be no progress. The visitors’ settlement would be somewhere on the hill above the village, and it would have much the same character as the summer station of Sakesar in the \Y estern Salt Range (Panjab, India). One of the principal objects of my tour into Kurdistan was to discover, if possible, a tolerable hill station in Turkish territory within reach of Baghdad. But there is none such,—a want which can be remedied only by the improvement of internal communications, or by the Turkish encroachments on Persia being con tinued on lower parallels of latitude than those to which they have as yet extend- ed. The country about Shaqlawah is inhabited by the Khushnau tribe of Kurds. They are said to have come in the begin- Khuahnau tribe of Kurds. ning from Sinneh in Persia. The Khushnau are said to rank, among Kurds, below the Jaf, but above the Dizzai and the Gardi. They have no connection with the Jaf. The Khushnau are themselves divided into 3 sections; the Mir Mahmali whose head is Bayazid Baig, Amir of Shaqlawah ; the Mir Yusufi, whose head is Khidhr Baig ; and the Pushtgali, whose head is Ahmad Baig. The Amir of Shaqlawah admits that the following Kurdish chiefs in his own neighbourhood enjoy precedence over himself: ’Abdullah Pasha of Rowanduz, head of the Oghaz Baigi Kurds, and Shaikh Hamud. Both of these are said to be really of Arab descent, from the tribe of Tai. The villages recognis ing the authority of the Amir of Shaqlawah are these : Shaqlawah (or Shaqlawi), Sufldgilah, Garotah, Hiran, Kamusak, Fariz, Blrokah, Sulauk, Ziyarat, Darband Gomaspan, Karaslnd Sufla, Karasind ’Uliya, Kiiirzhah, Hujaran, Kawani, Kasrok, Giraiwan, Shaikh Mahmandi, Sisawah, Shinawah, Shawais, Ari Sidak, Sursurah, Khattai, Tutmah, Barisani Mir Mahmali, Shlaimuk, and Bala Malakah ; butCl ir 21 3 of these are at present deserted. A number of other villages are subject to the Amir’s influence without recognising his authority. Shaqlawah to Batas. (30th April 1910.) We leave Shaqlawah by a very stony lane descending between hedges to the valley below the village. There are hawthorn in bloom, dog-roses in bud, and quantities of poppies. Near the foot of the descent we cross a foaming stream which comes down l»t Station (DarbandSorak). (30 minutea.) from Shaqlawah ; and at the end of it, in halt an hour, we reach Darband Sorak a gap in a red ridge which is parallel to the hills behind Shaqlawah: all the drainage of Shaqlawah and its valley appears to escape through the gap. The highest point of Safin is to the south, at a distance apparently of about 3 miles. After 23 minutes we cross from the left to the right bank of the Ru Sorak, „ , ^ + . /M .. , ... the stream issuing from Darband Sorak. minutes.) v ' * It is of varying depth, flows rapidly, and has a breadth of 5 to 10 yards : it goes west wards, presumably to join the Zab River. An easy ascent brings us in 23 minutea more to the pass over the Mirawah ridge, parallel to that of Sorak and not much lower, but of a whitish stone. From the pass Darband Sorak lies to the south-south-west, the top of Safin to the south by west, and Shaqlawah (invisible) to the south-west. To the west, at 2 or 3 miles distance, is the village of Mawaranah, 60 houses of Rowanduz Kurds, situated on the Ru Sorak below our crossing place. To the south, at 3 or 4 miles, is the village of Tilgarah, 10 houses of Mir Yusufi Khushnau Kurds, situated in the Shaqlawah basin. Batas, our destination this day, is invisible; but its direction is pointed out as north by west. To the north-east, at 1 mile, is Mamazailkah, a village of 20 houses of Mir Yusufi Khushnau Kurds. Our road, during the next stage, runs in a general north by east direction for half an hour. Ten minutes before reaching the 3rd station cultivated land begins, reaching to the foot of the barren and steep Harlr hills in front of us ; while a road to Rowanduz, different from that which we are following, breaks off to the right. Just before reaching the station a small stream with a good flow of water is crossed. The place where we halt is the ruined village of Mir Rustam, which was acci dentally destroyed by fire in the autumn of 3rd Station (Mir Rustam). (1 hour 46 minutes.) 19 09. The present village is a little to the north-west, but we are assured that the people will return before long to the former site. In half an hour another station is reached at Kolkah, where the track crosses 4th Station (Koikah). (2 hours 16 minutes.) ano !her ridge, and where there are the ^ , . remains of a village deserted a vear ago. Ine observations are taken from a place 100 yards to the right of the road. Looking backward we see the crossing of the Mirawah ridge to the south-south-west To the south by east, is Shavaislyah, a village of 10 houses of Mir Mahmali Kurds' and to the south-east by south is Shlnawah, a village of 8 or 9 houses of the same'- we passed these villages 10 minutes before reaching the station, Shavaislyah beini then ov&gt;() yards to the right of the road, and Shinawah in line beyond it and about 1,000 yards from the road. Both villages are under the Amir of Shaqlawah. hrom oiu present point of observation we see, slightly to the right of Shlnawah but about 2a mfles off, the village of Shaikh Mahmudiyah, 60 houses of Mir Mahma u Aurds ; it seems to lie immediately under a hill which closes the upper end oi tue valley up which we are now looking. ^ C223GSB22 From that direction come two streams which close in towards one another and again separate under the point of the ridge on which we are now standing ; the nearer is called Shavaisiyah, the further Shinawah. Due east, at 500 or 600 yards, is the village of Sisawah, consisting of 10 houses of Mir Mahmali Kurds. North wards, beyond the streams, on the road by which we shall pass, is the village of Ari Sirak, 10 houses of Mir Mahmali Kurds. It is 20 minutes beyond the point where we now are. To the north-north-west, at about 11 miles, is Motrawah village, 30 houses of Mir Yusufi Kurds. To the north-west by west, at some miles, is Sursurah village, 30 houses of Mir Mahmali Kurds. There are some good fruit orchards hereabout. Since entering the hills between Arbil and Shaqlawah we have seen oak trees of two kinds. In many places they make up the greater part of the wooding. One of these is the ballut, which is not always easily recognisable, as its leaves vary greatly in colour, substance, and even shape, from place to place, perhaps with their age or the age of the tree. The other is the ’afas, which yields the gall- nut of commerce; it resembles the English oak, the leaves being scalloped and crimped at the edges, while those of the ballut are serrated. Above Shaqlawah there were tulips and primroses. To-day our eyes have been gladdened by the sight of buttercups, dwarf-may, a kind of anemone, poppies, forget-me-not, English thistles, a ground convolvulus, and ground ivy. Some of the meadows and fields are ablaze with flowers of one colour. There is almost all the freshness and delicacy of an English spring, with greater profusion and variety. We notice that the Kurds place wood which they have collected on graves. The explanation given us is a superstition that if anyone but the owner removes it he will become blind. Quarter of an hour beyond Ari Sirak we halt for observations, having crossed an irrigation channel immediately after 5th Station. (2 hours 51 minutes.) • 4.1 J ... passing tne viiJage. I rom the new position Motrawah, already mentioned, bears west-north-west at quarter of a mile’s distance; the stream crossed just before Ari Sirak is seen to pass to the left of it. Koikah now lies to the south by east, and Ari Sirak to the south-south-east. Bawiyah, a village of 100 houses of Rowanduz Kurds, lies north-east by east, three quarters of a mile off, upon foot-hills. In half an hour we reach the village of Karwatanah, which is upon the road ; it consists of 40 houses of Rowanduz Kurds. 6 th Station. (3 hours 21 minutes.) 0ur r?ad has been g radually converging on the foot of the Harir range of hills, which is steep and high. The pass over the Ko kah ridge, where we halted, is now to the south-south-east; and the Safin hill, behind Shaqlawah, is to the south. Nineteen minutes more, on a path which slopes gradually and obliquely 7 th Station. (3 hours 40 minutes.) , U P. to the to P of a rid g e P aralle l t° Harir. brings us to a water mill, the water from which goes down in a brawling stream by the left side of the wav on which we have been travelling. The n .ill belongs to Agha Baigi, an officer of Gendarmerie at Rowanduz. Near the mill is one house, also a ruin called Kalatu Sor, which is said to have been the stronghold of Sulaiman Baig, unoccupied since 40 or 50 years. Probably he was a Kurd sh chief whose power wr.s brought down by the extension of Turkish influence to the hills, as that of the Shaqlawah A hit will le brought down ere long. The ruin consists of square blocks of stone set in good mortar. To the north-north-east, three-quarters of a mile or one mile distant, is the village of Harir ; it lies just under the range of hills to which it gives its name, and it boasts of about 100 houses of Rowanduz Kurds. Our last station bears south-east or very slightly south of south-east. In 23 minutes, travelling along the south-west side of the ridge we have as- Batas, (4 hours 3 minutes.) cended, just below its crest, we reach Batas, the end of this stage. It is a village of a hund red houses of Batas Surkhi Kurds. From here Harir lies 1 o t] e east by south ; on the other side we overlook a fine valley descending, and broadening as it goes, to the23 north-west; and Rowanduz is said to lie about north-east behind the Harir hills and other ranges. (Batas is probably a little south-east of the place marked “ Sinsira ” in the War Office map, Sheet 33.) Batas to Rowanduz. * (1st May 1910.) This was a hard day for men and animals. We started before dawn, yet the baggage did not reach Rowanduz till dark. Observations were postponed to the return journey, which is less difficult. I shortened the way by climbing over the Harlr range, while the caravan went round by an easier route to the west. The top of Harir, where I crossed it, was a pleasant tableland called Morgah with pear trees in full bloom ; some hospitably disposed Kurds encamped on it supplied mv party with milk, cheese, etc. On the other side I descended into a valley, parallel to the range, at the bottom of which was a fine rushing stream, following which downwards I rejoined the baggage about the middle of the day at a flat halting-ground called Cham-i-Khal fanj There was some stiff climbing in crossing the HarTr range, and the son of the headman of Batas, who accompanied us, became knocked up and delayed progress. These Kurds, at least, are not in the same category of hillmen as the tribes of the Afghan frontier; and Simla villagers are better walkers. The only large animal seen, though wild goats were expected, was a pig; but the familiar chikore, the red-legged partridge of India, was heard calling all round. In the valley after crossing the Harir hills I came, with delight, upon the ordinary English daisy. Rowanduz. (2nd and 3rd May 1910.) Rowanduz is remarkably situated on a sloping tongue of land, very abrupt in parts, which runs down to the canon of the Rowanduz River or Rubai (i.e., Rudbal or Rudbar); this tongue is separated from the country eastwards by the Khaland, a great gully with precipitous sides, which joins the Rubai just above the town. All around, but nowhere very near, were at the time of our visit snow-topped mountains. The town is long, steep and straggling; it is in two parts, of w r hich the upper is the larger. Above the upper town are gardens, and down its one street runs a gurgling brook. The telegraph office and winter Sarai are in the lower town, between wdiich and the upper is an open tract less rapidly sloping than the rest, with the summer quarters of the Qaim-Maqam and the palace of ’Abdullah Pasha, Kurd, the present head of the old ruling family of Rowanduz. Under the lower town the Rubai is spanned, at a deep and narrow gorge, by an uninviting wooden bridge without parapet, which caravans however can cross. There are said to be 2,500 houses in the town, but 1,000 would appear a more probable number, giving a population of about 5,000 souls. The people are u.ostly Kurds, called “ Rowanduz ” Kurds when settled elsewhere, but Rowanduz is not the name of a tribe. There are some 40 households of Jews in the place, most of them very poor ; and about a dozen Christians are to be found, unaccompanied by their families, who have come for the sake of trade. Trade is mostly in gall-nuts, sheep’s wool, and goats’ hair. Grapes are grown, and are eaten fresh, or dried for raisins ; a little wine is made, but practically none is exported. Rowanduz is the headquarters of a mountainous Qaza, said to contain 350 villages, nearly all Kurdish. The Qaim-Maqam, when we were there, was a Moslem Greek, the Qazi a Syrian from Latakia. The former did not know the name of his own Mai Mudiri (principal assistant), with whom he had been working for 14 months.24 There are about 80 households of Jews, similar to those of Rowanduz town, scat tered over the outside villages ; and there are 3 or 4 entirely Christian villages. Rowanduz is a base for Turkish military action in Persia. At the time of our visit the Nizam infantry battalion by which it is ordinarily garrisoned was on field service against the Shaikh of Baraizan. The two Radlf battalions, probably nominal, of which Rowanduz was then the headquarters, had not been embodied. The local Jews were beginning to be conscripted for the army ; 16 had been taken for the Nizam and about 70 enrolled in the Ihtiyat. The principal man at Rowanduz is ’Abdullah Pasha, Kurd, a descendant of Muhammad Pasha, the last native ruler of Rowanduz. As ’Abdullah Pasha is now 60 years of age or more and does not remember Muhammad Pasha, the supersession of the latter’s authority by that of the Turks must have occurred long ago. ’Ab dullah Pasha is an agreeable old gentleman, with considerable knowledge of the world, and full of local information which he imparts with a readiness unusual in this country; he gave me a quantity of data about local routes, etc., which are re produced in an annexure (Appendix B) to this report. He was in the Turkish service for many years as a civil Qaim-Maqam, and he combines the urbanity and trained intelligence of an official with some of the good qualities and advantages of a hereditary chief in his own country. His son Sa’id Baig, who has a separate house, is arrogant and seems less intelligent than his father ; he too was in the Turkish service for a time, but had to leave it on account, it is said, of his having caused the death of a Turkish military officer. On the second day of our visit to Rowanduz I crossed the Rubai by the bridge, accompanied by the Mai Mudiri of Rowanduz, himself a Kurd, and climbed and explored the high Zozik hill on the other side of the river. The ascent was made from a village named Goan, where there was great difficulty in obtaining an inhabit ant to act as a guide to the top. The Mai Mudiri pointed this out as a proof of how authority (his) had been weakened by the grant of the Constitution ; to me it ap peared rather an instance of Kurdish laziness, “ constitutional ” perhaps, but in a different sense. Goan lies a mile or two back from the Rubai up a small valley; on the way to it after crossing the Rudbal we passed a four-cornered bastioned fort, ruined, upon an eminence, which we were told had belonged to Muhammad Pasha, Kurd, the last of the great chiefs of Rowanduz. Up the same valley, about a mile above Goan, lies Diyanah, a small Christian village. On one part of the Zozik hill we found Kurdish villagers living in tents. It is their custom to camp out at this season for a month or so, partly for the sake of pasture, and partly to escape the fleas which now infest their houses. This day we heard the homely voice of the cuckoo, locally called bilbil. Rowanduz to Ashkar. {4th May 1910.) Before leaving our quarters, which were in the summer Sarai between upper and lower Rowanduz, the following were observed:— To the north. —The valley of Garmuk running down towards us on the other side of the Rubai or River, to which it is tributary, with Dashtah Diyan behind it. North by eas*,—The ruined fort of Muhammad Pasha, also beyond the Rubai. To the north-east.—The Zozik hill, likewise across the river, 2 to 3 miles distant. To the east by north.—The valley of the Rubai above Rowanduz, as it comes down from Rayat. To the east by south. —Hindarain, a big sloping hill, the most closely connected with Rowanduz of the surrounding mountains.( 5 ) V 25 To the South hy West. —The Annushah hill; a valley coming down from the east between it and Hindarain is called Dolaku. * To the South-South-West .— Baijan, an isolated, very sharply pointed hill, divid ed by a cleft on either side from the hills next it. From South-West to South-West hy West. —The Kurak hill. None of the above hills are many miles from Rowanduz, and some of them are quite high. Armushah, Brijanand Kurak had snow on them when we saw them. Baijan has a striking appearance. In 25 minutes, moving with the baggage, we reach the pass, called Garda- . o. x- ^ * v 8 ar(i ’ from w hich the road descends into lrt stat,on &lt; 23 Rowanduz town; thi 3 is the way by which we arrived also. Far off, to the north, are the high snow hills of the BaradSst district. To the north-east is Zozik, with Sari Hr.sambak, a bold conical mountain, showing over its left flank. To the east is Hindarain. At the head of the Dolaku valley, which, as seen from here, comes from south-east and turns north, is a mountain named Sari Sawusiwokah. The highest visible point of Kurak is to the west- south-west at about H miles distance. North-west, about miles off, is a hill, Balakyan, just above the Gali or gorge of the Rowanduz Rubai and just beyond LeavingGardagard we descend into the Kanijuz ravine or valley, which we must cross ; there is a stream at the bottom of it, which appears to be the drainage of the east and north-east faces of Kurak. The Kanijuz valley opens, through a gap on the right of the road, into the gorge of the Rowanduz Rubal , &gt; which is near. ^ The descent to the bottom may be 300 feet, and it is steep ; but the going is good. The ascent on the other side is greater, perhaps 400 feet, and the path is bad ; part is very rocky or stony, and in places it consists of disintegrated shaley rock. In 59 minutes we reach the pass on the other side, called Darakasab, a shoulder Jnd Station (Darakasab). (1 hour 24 minutes.) Kurak ; but the baggage takes an hour and forty minutes to get there from Gardagard. Balakyan, across the Rubai, now appears to lie 2 miles to the north ; and to the north-north-west is a hill named Garwaibiran. Quarter of an hour beyond Darakasab we attain a commanding point, fro m 3rd station, (i hour 39 minutes.) which, we can look both up and down the liowanduz Rubai valley, or rather gorge, as well as right over to Balakyan. The road now winds and zigzags very steeply down hill, and the surface is often very bad. There are stretches of flat rock and stretches of earth which afford welcome relief to men and animals; but the rest is vilely rough, with natural rocks and stones or artificial cobbles. The rock is hard, and, where worn smooth, is apt to be slippery. The cobbled parts are ridged across at intervals of 2 to 3 yards, and the packing between consists of large unshaped stones of half a cubic foot to one cubic foot in size. In 40 minutes, the baggage being again behind, we reach a turn overlooking 4th Station. (2 hours 19 minutes.) ^ i Unc ^ on ^6 Khalifan Stream, lip rp, ' 0 - 1 -, which our route lies, with the Rowanduz Rubai. The Rubai gorge, we are told, is called Baikhar above this point Be- tween the two waters near their junction, on the proper left bank of each, is a coni cal green hill called Birdamiyan. In 30 minutes, having now entered the Khalifan valley, we pass above the 5th Station (Cham-i-Khalifan). (3 hours 29 wat ™ fal l °f Lablai, in which the minutes,but baggage took 6 hours.) whole volume of the Khalifan stream pre- i • i, Tx. 1.1 i ii cipitates itself, undivided, from a gr^at height. Its thunder can be heard from the road, but the descent from the right of C223GSB26 the road towards it is difficult, and a satisfactory view of it cannot be obtained without crossing to the other side of the stream, which at the time of our visit would not have been possible. Beyond Lablai the road runs for 40 minutes up Gali ’Ali Baig, as this narrow part of the valley of the Khalifan stream is called. At a short distance from the top it crosses to the other side by a bridge, and so reaches the open camping around of Cham-i-Khalifan. The bridge referred to has no parapets, but is ht for the passage of caravans. It stands on two stone piers, partly of natural rock, and consists of strong timbers overlaid with brushwood and earth. There was some delay in the arrival of the baggage. Kbilifan village (7 houses) is on the opposite side of the stream from the camping-ground. Above this village the stream is called Bilai. In 18 minutes we are iust entering some hills on our right. Looking backw ards, . we see Khalifan village about three quar- cth Station. (3 hours 47 minutes.) ters of a mile oS to the south-south-east, while the head of the ’Ali Baig Gali, or gorge, lies to the east-north-east at about 1 mile. Just after leaving this station we pass a Kurdish graveyard and fine grove of oaks. In 24 minutes, ascending a valley by which a tributary comes down to the Khalifan stream, we reach a point quar- 7 th Station. (4 hours 11 minutes.) £ er 0 f a m q e south of the village of Khan- i Batman The villa«e consists of 20 houses ; the people are Kurds of no particular tribe. Behind us the last station is visible to the east-north-east. We halt again, after 25 minutes, and note that Kurak mountain now lies east vv e nai . g &gt; ^ ^ t j iat ttie g enera i direction of our 8 th Station. (4 hours 36 mmutea.) course since leaving Cham-i-Khallfan has been from east-south-east to west-north-west. Five minutes beyond the 8th station we cross a watershed and find ourselves in the basin of a valley which, instead of going down eastwards, runs westwards between us and the HarTr range on the south In 23 mmutes more we pass a vd- laoe above us on the right, about half a mile off, it is kalakin, consisting o i ’ hmicps of Surkhi Kurds. Three minutes further on we cross a brook whkn runs down from the north on its way to join the stream at the bottom of the valley on our left; the stream, after receiving the brook, turns away leftwards from our road down a gorge. Six minutes later we halt. At this station the direction of our journey is still to the west-north-west, and Kurak is now to the east by south. On 9th station. (5 hours 13 minutes.) s tage we have crossed two or three armll rivulets besides the brook mentioned ; and ever since we left Khalifan there have been frequent springs spoiling the road. _ The lulls among and over which we have been passing have been well wooded with leafy oaks of both sorts (Ballfit and ’Afas). After 8 minutes we reach a pass or ridge-crossing called Spilik, from which we get a fine view ahead towards the Zab loth Station. (5 hours 21 minutes.) Kiver and backwards to Kurak. Kurak bears about east, and the ’AH Baig gorge seems to lie to the east by north It is a little bevond Spilik that the road to Batas, followed by the caravan on the day that we marched to Rowanduz, goes off to the left. A stony descent lies mfront and we dismount. Here we see the telegraph fine which connects Rowanduz and Dairah Harir, apparently not the village of Hanr near Batas ; we learn that it crosses the Khalifan stream above Khalifan village and traverses the hills to Rowanduz beyond Kurak, i.e .,east of it. In 25 minutes we reach a point at which the road we have been following runs straight on to Dairah Harir (and so llth Station. (5 hours 46 minutes.) t() while the track tkat we must now follow bears to the right.27 Five minutes beyond the point we cross a ravine coming down from our right; we have had a stony descent of it all the way. We now push on up a green but almost treeless valley, forming a trough between the continuation of the Harir range (from which we have come down) and a range of outer gravelly hills. In half an hour from the last station, rising all the way, we surmount a trans verse watershed which crosses the trough 12 th station. (6 hours io minutes.) valley and look back ; the Spilik pass, with Kurak appearing over it, lies to the east by south. After crossing the watershed we travel along the outer side of the trough, not the Harir side as hitherto. We go on for 21 minutes and halt again ; the last station lies to the south east by east. Our path was down and then 18th Station. (6 hours 37 minutes.) again. Eight minutes’ going brings us to a gap in the outer range of hills through which we pass outwards, in the direction 14th station. (6 hours 45 minutes.) 0 f pl a i ns&gt; close to a graveyard and a grove of trees. Just before reaching the gap there was a small hamlet (Ashkaftu, 7 houses of Surkhi Kurds). A few minutes’ descent brings us out on a grassy but stony plain, where we encamp close to the half dozen tents of Ashkar (about 7 hours, but the baggage ^jpad Agha, a Surkhi Kurd. The place took about 9^). ^ called Ashkar, which name is said to mean “cave”. The Shaqlawah hills are visible, bearing about south by east, and the gorge by which the Zab River issues from the mountains is to the north- north-west, one or two miles distant. This gorge reminds one of the opening by which the Indus makes its final exit from the hills at Kalabagh and the general lie of the country is not dissimilar. Ashkar to KandIl Ferry. {5th May 1910.) We intended to cross the Zab without going further down its bank than ne cessary, and to make for ’Aqrah, then a centre of political interest because of the operations in progress against the Shaikh of Baraizan. W e accordingly made for Kandil, which is marked in the War Office map. One and a half hours, at a foot pace, brought us to Kandil; it was a continuous descent, first over stony hills, then over grassy downs, and finally over rich meadows of white clover. There were numerous springs, on the way down, making the ground soppy. At 35 minutes from the start, at about the steepest part of the descent, we passed Barzln, a village of 20 houses of Surkhi Kurds. Kandil itself is a group of 4 or 5 houses of Surkhi Kurds, with a fruit garden containing figs, vines, etc. The meadows Ist Station (Kandil). (1 hour 30 minutes.) a bout were full of black tents, and plough ing was going on. At Kandil the exit of the Zab from the hills lies noith-east, on the east side of its gorge stands the high Galaizai hdl, on the west Bairat, sti higher. The ferry was not at Kandil at this time, but a mile or so below. To reach it we move along cliffs formed by a projec- 2nd Station (Ferry). (1 hour 53 minutes.) ^ on 0 f higher dowms. At 8 minutes from Kandil we cross a small stream running down a gully to the river. In 23 minutes from Kandil we reach the crossing place. A little below' it the Zab is joined by the drainage of the Batas valley; the place of junction, or perhaps the lower part of the valley, seems to be called Hamadibash Rubat. About halt a mile up the Batas valley from the Zab is Khara, a village of 40 houses of Surkhi Kurds. On the opposite side of the Zab some half or three-quarters mile down stream, to the west by south, was Astrlland, a village of more than 20 houses^ of Surkhi Kurds. On the Astrlland side of the river could be descried a tine collection of animals grazing—cattle (mostly black), mares with foals, and sheep.28 In summer the Zab is fordable a little way below the ferry, and at many other places. It was now in flood, having recently risen about 3 feet, and presented a formidable aspect. The breadth of its single channel was only about 150 yards, but I estimated the velocity of the current at 6 miles an hour. There was only one raft, a kilik buoyed up on 18 skins, and capable at most of carrying 4 passengers at a time with a little baggage. We more than once drove our unloaded transport animals and riding horses into the water, but they could not be prevented from turning back after swimming a short way. It was perhaps as well so, for the strong est of transport ponies was drowned afterwards in making an easier passage further down. The raft made one crossing, in the course of which it was carried half a mile downstream ; and it had to be carried a mile up the opposite bank in order to make sure of regaining the point from which it started. At length, after 4 hours’ ineffectual expedients and efforts, it was decided that Mr. Gaskin should proceed with the caravan to Musal by an easier route lower down, while I with Nasir, the Dragoman of the Musal Vice-Consulate, made the tour to ’Aqrah with our horses and such belongings only as we could carry on them. The Dragoman and I accordingly crossed on the raft, our horses being towed behind by the bridles, and reached the other side without mishap. Incidents such as this on routes by which many travellers pass are largely accountable for the unfortunate reputation of the Turkish administrative services outside Turkey. In any new but civilised country a river like the Zab would be bridged in a few years ; but here, in Turkey, centuries have not sufficed. Kandil Ferry to ’Aqrah. {5th May 1910.) The remainder of the journey to ’Aqrah had to be performed in haste, and proper observations could not be taken. Darkness fell before our destination was reached. Our road lay, for the first two hours after leaving the Zab, over gravelly con glomerate hills covered with grass and clover. The path generally wound along watersheds between complicated valley systems, all apparently draining to the Zab ; it was steep and narrow in places, but there was no difficulty in getting the horses' along. At 1 hour 15 minutes from starting we found our route converging on a range which seemed to be a continuation, on this side the Zab, of the Harir hills. At 1 hour 25 minutes we saw to our right, on the outer slopes of this range the village of Susnawah (30 houses of Surchi Kurds). At 2 hours 35 minutes we passed the ruins of a castle, on our right; it was described at the castle of Ahmad Agha. Near it is the village of Qalati (60 houses of Surchi Kurds), of which the headman is, or was, Muhammad Mahmud Agha. At 2 hours 50 minutes the village of Gulsair (50 houses of Surchi Kurds), is on the hills to our right. For the last hour, or hour and a half, the track has been running up and down across valleys with small clear streams. At 3 hours 30 minutes we reach the wooded valley or ravine of Bijil, which is crossed on a narrow stone bridge without parapets. Immediately beyond the bridge, above the road and on the right, is part of the village of Bijil, viz., about 40 houses of Surchi Kurds. At 4 hours 5 minutes we reach Bijil proper; it is divided into two parts by a great ravine in which is a waterfall. On the east side of the village, that first reach ed is a smaller ravine with a water-mill in a cave. There is not much cultivation at Bijil, but the fruit gardens appear luxuriant, especially the fig trees. There are 80 houses of Surchi Kurds here ; the owner of the place is Shaikh Muhammad Bijil, who lives at ’Aqrah and owns here a long low Qasr, with two tiers of loopholes, on the top of a rock on the west side of the large ravine. The houses of the place are piled up one above another upon the hill side.29 At 5 hours 5 minutes, we reach Zinta village, 15 houses of Surchi Kurds. Just beyond is a tremendous cleft in the hills on the right, from which a stream emerges; this is Gali Gibair. Ten minutes beyond the village we cross the stream ; it is about 10 yards wide and a foot deep ; the water is pale green and clear. At 5 hours 45 minutes Jodah, a village consisting partly of caves, is seen to the right; here are some 15 houses of Surchi Kurds. It is getting dark now, and the road is wild and lonely. At about 7 hours we reach 'Aqrah, after painful stumbling about in a deep gully with dark gardens and a rushing stream of unknown depth, which we eventual ly succeed in crossing. A long stony ascent from the gully brings us into the town. If we had been a few minutes later we should not have found our way into 'Aqrah this night. ' e are received by ’Ali Niyazi Bey, the Qaim-Maqam, a native of the Hauran (Syria), who has been a year here. 'Aqrah. {6th May 1910.) There are said to be about 1,000 houses m 'Aqrah, and these are mostly of Kurds, but 50 of Chaldgean Catholics and 10 of Jacobites are included, also some 20 of Jews. The Christians are blacksmiths, joiners, and artisans; the Jews are traders and weavers. The place is poor: a regular hill village, but a large one. Some tobacco and rice are grown for local consumption. 'Aqrah stands partly on a steep col, connecting an outer and lower hill called Giri with a higher one on which is a QaTah or pre-historic fort, and partly in two valleys which come down from the hills, one to the east (Gali Kanyarash), the other to the west (Gali Shaikh 'Abdul Aziz), of Giri and the Qal'ah. Running southwards to the plains these two valleys unite below Giii to form the Rubar Samllah, which is said to reach the Zab at Zairao below Garmak. The Jews in 'Aqrah live on the left bank of the western Gali, and the Christians on the right bank of the eastern. * I think Baraizan may nevertheless be the same as “ Rizan '* in the War Office map. An Anatolian battalion was in garrison at ’Aqrah at the time of my visit. An hour’s climb up Gali Kanyarash brings me to the pass of Sar ’Aqrah, from which I can see to the east-north-east the pass over Pirish, the next range in the direction of Persia. I learn that it is 3 hours' journey from where I stand to the Pirish pass, called Gali Shairwani, and 2J hours' journey from that place to Birikaprah ; also that* Baraizan, properly so called, lies at Ij hours’ distance from the further bank of the Zab, nearly opposite Birikaprah. Baraizan is said to have had 150 houses before its destruction by the Turks. Behind and above all are seen the snowy mountains of Shirin. Birika prah and Baraizan are both in the Mudiriyah of Zaibar, which is under ’Aqrah. (These places were important, at the time of my visit, on account of the campaign then proceeding against the Baraizan Shaikh. In regard to the campaign itself much information was obtained, but this is now obsolete. The Shaikh had taken refuge at Babsaifah, a place said to lie behind Shirir, and to be eight hours’ journey from Baraizan, where he considered himself safe from capture. There were Turkish g -rrisons at Birikaprah and Baraizan proper.) From Sar ’Aqrah can be seen to the south-west Jabal Maqlub, behind which is Musal. Gali Kanyarash, which I now again descend, contains some beautiful gardens. The uppermost belongs to the Jacobi teChurch. Before returning to ’Aqrah I examined the remains on the top of the Qal’ah hill above the town. They are sufficiently remarkable, including various passages, wells, and a large chamber, all hewn in the rock. But the most striking w T ork is a cutting which comes down from a neighbouring hill and rises again to the fort in which we are ; the explanation given locally—and it seems a not impossible one— is that it carried some kind of siphon by which water was brought into the fort from C223GSB30 the other hill. The cutting is about 400 yards long; at the middle it is perhaps 100 feet lower than at the ends ; it is cut cleanly through the rock, wherever neces sary, with sufficient breadth for a man to walk through and to a depth, in places, of more than 6 feet. I had not time to ascertain personally whether there was water on the other hill, or whether water might have been brought to it once from some adjacent valley. The cutting did not look like a covered way connecting two fortifications. There was nothing to fix the age of the QaTah remains, and the inhabitants of 'Aqrah had evidently no authentic information about them. At ’Aqrah I was told that there is a valley called Garmiik which joins the valley of the Zab from the north at a point 3 hours below Baraizan; that there are caves in it inhabited by the Dlwaneh tribe ; and that the direct road from ’Aqrah to Rowanduz lies that way. ’Aqrah to Bardarash. {7th May 1910.) After 40 minutes’ travelling by a rough and stony path, generally downhill, not the one by which we entered ’Aorah but lying to the west instead of the east of the Giri hill, we reach a point where some bearings are taken. The Shaqlawah hill is to the south-east by east, Kurak is very slightly to the south of east. On the left front is a hill, 1st Station. (40 minutes.) n j t u i a- u • , -i • r called Jabal fSurchi, extending from a little east of south to a little west of south-south we t; it is at several miles distance from us. In 1 hour 5 minutes after leaving this point we reach the Kani Karwan, a valley, which we enter and follow; it runs from north-east to south-west and passes between Jabal Siirchi and a detached portion of the same. Hereabouts we see an encampment of the Harki tribe, another of which we passed not long after leaving ’Aqrah. In 28 minutes more we reach a green mound, in the middle of the valley ; and 5 minutes later we pass by another camp of the Harki which is on the right, that is on the further, bank of the Kani Karwan stream. The Harki are a Kurdish tribe who wander in these parts and as far as the con fines of Persia. They keep horses as pack animals' for carrying their belongings and they sell a few; but they do not work as caravan men. Scores of mares and young stock are to be seen about their camps. Their chief is Haji Agha. They are said to number 700 tents. In 30 minutes we reach a place at which the valley turns from south-west to west or west-north-west, and the hills 2nd Station. (2 hours 48 minutes.) v u ’i. r. i i between which it runs become lower and further apart. A canal now runs on each side of the valley, and there is culti vated land. ’Aqrah is seen behind to the north-north-east. To the west is Ruwiyah, a fort on a mound with a village of 6 houses inhabited by mixed Kurds (Sab’ah ’Ashair, Gaiz, etc.); it may be 3 miles away. To t! e west by south is Jubal Maqlub. After 10 minutes we cross the Sardarya stream, a tributary of the Kani Kar- 3rd Station (Sardarya crossing). (2 hours 58 Wan | its I ed is of shingle 60 yards Wide, minutes.) but the water running in it was at this time only 3 yards broad and about 6 inches deep. Across the Kani Karwan, to the right, are 2 mills driven by a canal on that side. Just beyond the Sardazya is another Harki encampment, which 10 minutes later we shall pass. At 25 minutes beyond Sardarya our path turns away from the Kani Karwan to the south-west. Five minutes later we are abreast of Ruwiyah, which is half a mile to the right 4th Station. (3 hours 28 minute,,) of the road. The Ruwiyah fort belongs to Isma il Agha, a chief of the Gaiz Kurds. To the north-west and west-north-west is a great open plain with mounds and villages. Rice is being planted here.(0 31 In 18 minutes we arrive at a point between the villages of Jujar Kabir and Jujar Saghir, the former of which (50 houses) 5th station. (3 hours 46 minutes.) north-west at half a mile, the latter (20 houses) south-east at 500 yards. The people are ’Ashair Sab’ah Kurds. After 15 minutes we reach another observation point. ’Aqrah lies behind , „ . . , . , , exactly to the north-east. To the right of our road, at about ^ of a mile distance, is Jujar Tappah, a mound. To the south-south-east at 2 miles is Dostak, a village of 20 houses of ’Ashair Sab’ah, a hamlet belonging to which is nearer to the road. Jabal Maqlub extends from west-south-west to nearly south-west. From the Kanl Karwan valley as far as this point the road has l.an over high country, mostly through fields of barley not of heavy growth. Five minutes further on we .reach a clear pond, formed by springs, and con taining fish of some size; it is surrounded by grassy slopes; its overflow goes south or east to the plain as a small stream. In 20 minutes from leaving the last station we arrive at a place where our road turns more to the west, tie., to south west by west. 7 th Station. (4 hours 21 minutes.) Half an hour more brings us to a mound, 30 feet high, on the left side of the 8 th station. (4 hours 51 minutes.) road ' Just before the mound there is a small spring, feeding a marshy reed-grown stream ; just beyond it is a strong clear spring with a few willows, close to the reed-grown stream. This place is called Mamozin. The going for the last few miles has been difficult owing to luxuriant vegeta tion almost concealing the path. Even at this early season it is hot and steamy here. The country of the ’Ashair Sab’ah is notoriously unhealthy. Quarter of an hour brings us to a second mound, similar to the last, on the 9th station. (5 hours 6 minutes.) left of the road ; on the right of the road there is a pond. This place is called Qura Baig. _ The MudirTyah of Bardarash is now seen on low hills which join on to Jabal Maqlub ; Bardarash is to the south by west, and our road now turns in that direction. The marshy stream already mentioned has accompanied us as far as this on the left. In another quarter of an hour we cross this stream, then another, after which loth station. (5 hours 21 minutes.) we bnd ourselves at about 1,000 yards from Bardarash Walad, as it is called, a village of 60 houses of Ashair Sab’ah, etc. About f of a mile to the right of the Mudiriyah, on the same hills, is Bardarash Yunas village (50 houses of ’Ashair Sab’ah, etc) One mile to the left is Khailaki (50 houses of ’Ashair Sab’ah), also on the same hills. I rom here to the village is cultivation of wheat and barley. Looking back we see Aqrah to the north-east, and the highest part of the Surchi hill, called Surchi Bardasur, to the east-north-east. In about 10 minutes more we reach the Mudiriyah, and are received by the Bardarash. (5 hours 31 minutes.) Mudlr. In the plain to the westward .. . light is reflected from numerous collections of water: the whole of this lush plain seems to ooze with water, yet not to be marshy. A European prospector for liquorice root from Messrs. MacAn- drew and Porbes Co.’s Baghdad branch is encamped before us at Bardarash. Bardarash to Musal. {7th May 1910). In 20 minutes after leaving Bardarash we reach the top of the ridge, called 1 st station. (20 minutes.) Jabal Zirg Bardarash, on -which it is . . situated ; this ridge runs to the Zab River. t rom here the position of ’Aqrah is about north-east ; and in the northern hills32 about north, is a deep gorge like the letter V, known as Bazai which seems to be the exit of some river. Jabal Maqlub is now to the west and a reddish hill called Kani Zardak to the south-west. One hour and ten minutes after leaving the top of Zirg Bardarash we arrive at „ , + . ,, , on • * x the left bank of the Khazir river at the village of Katisi (20 houses of Bot Kurds). Jabal Maqlub lies north-west; Kani Zardak south-west. The ford of the Khazir is a little above the village; at the time of our visit the stream was 50 yards broad and in places as much as 3 feet deep, with a faiily strong current; we were told that the river at this time was neither high nor low. The Khazir here comes from the north through a breach between Jabal Zirg, Bardarash and Jabal Maqlub; below Katisi it circles roui d to the south-west. At 1 mile to southward, on cliffs on the left bank of the Khazir, is Dusarah&gt; a village of 50 houses of B6t Kurds. About 20 minutes before reaching Kat'si we crossed a ravine with a small stream in it. Beyond this point there was cultivation of wheat and barely. Thus far the road from Bardarash has not been very good, and we have ridden at a walk. We cross the Khazir by the ford and after 17 minutes see the village of Saikani „ , ... (40 houses of Bot Kurds) about H miles to our right, in the direction of Jabal Maqlub. Nine minutes later we strike a bend of the Khazir on the left side of the road; from here the river appears to go off to the south. Our road has run up hill and down, but has not been stony, since crossing the river. After 43 minutes we reach the top of the high land which joins the hills of o* ,«v oa • f i Maqlub to those of Zardak; Maqlub 4th Station. (2 hours 39 minutes.) . 1 i r ^ extends from nearly north-north-west to beyond north-north-east, and Zardak from nearly south-south-west to beyond south-south-east. The Katisi ford now bears east by north. On the slopes_of Maqlub are various villages ; one of these, on the right looking towards Maqlub, is pointed out as Dubardan and is said to consist of 40 houses of Bot Kurds and to stand at the head of a valley of the same name which runs down to the Khazir. The angle between north-north-west and west-north-west is subtended by hills called Jabal Naoran, of reddish colour, divided by a valley from Jabal Maqlub. They have the appearance of running more or less parallel to the Musal road. We travel for three-quarters of an hour to a point just beyond a mound on the , „ A . right side of the road; behind this mound tatiou. ( ours mum s . lies the village of Taizkharab (60 houses of Shabak Turkmans). The crossing place between Maqlub and Zardak, where we last halted, lies now about to the east-north-east. [In getting to our present station we passed, at 20 minutes, Bir Kalian (a village of 15 houses of Kurds and Arabs) on the right side of the road; also, at 28 minutes, the shrine of Imam Riza on the left side of the road; the latter is built of round stones and mortar and has a dome.] After 16 minutes’ going we reach a point at which the 4th station lies behind , „ . A . to the north-east by east and the direction 6 th Station. (3 hours 40 minutes.) i / - • \ • j- j. j of Musal (not visible) is indicated as be tween west by south and west-south-west. Here, on the left of the road at 600 yards distance, is the village of Topizawah (50 houses of Turkmans). In 18 minutes we halt again, abreast of a small light-coloured mound lying . . /0 , . Q . .. 300 yards to the right of the road. The 7 th Station. (3 hours 58 mmutes.) , T _ _ £ ,. n &amp; j- r t Naoran nilis are receding from us and seem now 5 to 6 miles off. North, at | of a mile or a mile, is Tarjillah (30 houses of Turkmans) ; and north-north-west at about 2 miles, is Darwlshan (50 houses of Turkmans). Quarter of an hour later we reach a point at which there is a village Bazwai (60 houses of Turkmans) about | of a mile eth Station. (4 hours 13 minutes.) from the left side of the road The Naoran ridge now appears to die away towards the north by west, and far-off hills are33 visible beyond it. To the north by west, some 1J miles off, is Upper Tahra-wah (40 houses of Turkmans); to the north-north-west, at about 1 mile, is Lower Tahrawah (15 houses of Turkmans). 26 minutes’ going brings us to Gogjali, a village of 80 houses of Bazhwan Turk*- mans, on the left side of the road. The eth Station (Gogjali). (4 hours 39 minutes.) pags between MaqlQb an(i Zardak is HOW to the east-north-east ; the highest point of Kani Zardak is to the east with Bazwai village in line below it; and Musal is to the west by south. We reach the river at Musal in about an hour from Gogjali; but we travel faster in this last stage. Before passing Co“ttit y nL^ h E”:dri e “n Nabi Tunas, among the ruins of hours on the way from Bardarash.) Nineveh, we cross an outer gravelly ndge, a hollow, a central ridge, and an inner ridge; these great ridges lie parallel to one another and seem artificial—perhaps connect ed with the ruins of Nineveh. The river is high and, in order to get at the bridge, we have to flounder on our horses through some deep water. The stone bridge does not reach to the Musal bank, but is supplemented at that end by a bridge of boats. • • On the present tour there have been frequent crossing of streams and rivers, but nowhere has a respectable bridge been met with except that at Khan- aqln which was not constructed by the Turkish Government. The greatest need of this part of Turkey is better communications ; it is greater than the need of admi nistrators, troops, or even money. Mr. Gaskin and the baggage caravan, whose route rejoined mine before Gogjali, arrived almost simultaneously with me at Musal. Musal. {7th to 17th May 1910.) Musal has a British Vice-Consulate and is too well known to need description. I was much struck by the backwardness of education among the Chaldaean Catholics, whose chief schools are here, and by the superiority of the teaching in the Jewish (Alliance Israelite) school under M. Sidi, and even in the small schools connected with the Church Missionary Society’s Mission. The academical results in the Jewish school were almost startling, the boys in the highest class (age 14 or 15) being quite at home in the history of the Crusades, Coeur de Lion, Charles I of England, Frederick the Great, the French Revolution and its principal characters, etc. ; the questions put to them were mostly suggested by myself with out reference to the school curriculum. The tone of the school did not appear so satisfactory, however, as that of the Church Missionary Society’s School, where a brighter and more domestic atmosphere seemed to prevail ; but the Church Missionary Society’s School had only pupils below the age at which character begins to declare itself. It was said that M. Sidi, the head of the Jewish School, had caused some alarm among parents, in the beginning, by subversive tendencies in regard to religion and morality ; but that latterly he had veiled them, in deference to public opinion. The education of the Jews in Turkey is an important question for the country, as they are among the few thinking elements in the population ; and, from what I have seen at Baghdad and elsewhere, I fear that it is proceeding on mainly negative and even destructive lines. Musal to Baghdad. {17th to 22nd May 1910.) Mr. Gaskin and I arranged to travel to Baghdad by a Kilik, or raft, on the Tigris ; this is the most rapid as well as the most comfortable means of transit C22 3GSB?A when the river is strong; and we are favoured by a rise of 12 feet above the normal atMusal, whatever “ normal ” may be. A Kilik is a platform of crossed layers of poles supported on inflated skins. Under our Kilik there are 240 skins. Only sheep skins are used for this purpose, goat skins being too thin, and cattle skins too thick and hard to handle convenient ly. The necks of the skins are tied with liquorice fibre or hemp. The wood work of a Kilik, collectively, is called Malban. The lowest layer of poles, called Chlq, consists in our Kilik of 5 only. The next layer, Tatblq, is here 62. Above the Tatbiq layer is Dhahr, with us 23 poles ; and on the top of Dhahr is Sillim, in our case 6 poles. The lashings of the pole frame work are of tamarisk or w illow bark. The poles of the upper layers are larger than those of the lower. A Kilik may have either two or four sweeps, or oars; these are lashed to upright posts at the corners, called Shakkah, with tamarisk or willow bark. They are fixed at the comers from ’which the rows of submerged skins run longitudinally backwards and forwards ; it is easier to pull the Kilik through the water in the line of the skins than across it. The use of the sweeps is not to propel the Kilik—they are too clumsy and it is too heavy for this—but to keep it lying across the current m the best part of the river. In Kiliks carrying only goods the cargo is piled on the Sillim layer of poles ; but for the convenience of passengers a sort of deck, Farsh, may be laid down on the Sillim, and an ’Arshah or shed erected over it to serve as a cabin. Our Kilik is decked with slabs of Musal marble which we are carrying to Baghdad, and on the top of this we pitch a tent. The dimensions of our Kilik are about- 15 feet by 12 feet; and it carries 6 persons, besides the 2 Kilikjis or boatmen, and their luggage. At the start it is said to draw less than a foot of water ; but it settles down a few inches in the course of the voyage, owing to slight deflation of the_ skins which cannot be conveniently blown up again. The largest Kiliks in use have about 800 skins and their carrying power varies with the size of the skins, but may amount to 36 tons. A Kilik of 1,000 skins has been tried, but was not a success ; it was found unmanageable and part of the cargo was damaged. New skins cost on the average, tanned, about 13 pence each. Our Kilik cost £T. 9 and 1 Majidi (about £8-5-0), of which £T. 1 was on account of the hire of the poles, to be delivered at Baghdad. The hire of the poles in the case of a large Kilik may amount to £T. 15 or even 25. Musal to Qaiyarah. {17th May 1910.) At 37 minutes from the place where we embarked at Mfisal, below the bridge, we passed Yarimjah on the left bank (150 houses of Turkmans, Kurds, and Shi’ah Arabs). Yarimjah is 1| hours from Musal by land. At 1 hour 9 minutes we pass A1 Bu Saif and a Qasr (walled enclosure) called Sairauun, on the right bank ; here are 60 houses of Jibur Arabs. The Qasr belongs to the Jalil Baigs of Musal. Down to this place there has been cultiva tion on both banks ; and there have been low hills, not far inland from the right bank, which now approach closer to the river. At 1 hour 31 minutes the river divides round an island called Hawljah Shamsiyat. On the left bank are the villages of Shamsiyat, upper and lower, each about 100 houses of Jibur Arabs ; the upper village is opposite the upper end of the island, the lower J of a mile down. The island itself is about 4 a mile long. The low limestone hills on the right bank continue near the nvei. At 1 hour 57 minutes is A1 Bu Juwari on the right bank, half a mile inland, consisting of 50 houses of Jibur. About f of a mile before this was another right bank village, lying back on some highish hills and not seen in passing. A small alluvial flat now begins on the right bank between the river and the adjoin ing hills, which latter are not more than 100 feet high.35 ' f ‘ At 2 hours 10 minutes the river is going east, but immediately turns to south east Here on the left bank is Umfli-al-Qusair (100 houses of A1 Bu Husain Arabs, Sunnis). On the right bank, opposite, is Lazzaqah (50 houses of Jibur Arabs). There is also a conspicuous fort belonging to the Baigs of Musal. Here the hills on the right bank recede from it considerably. At 2 hours 32 minutes the river changes its direction from south to south- south-east, and hills begin on the left bank and run along it. Near the first hill, called Hamiru, a strong smell of sulphur pervades the air. On the right bank opposite, or a little further up, and l mile inland is Aral] (70 houses of Jibur Arabs). The hills on the right bank are now nearly 2 miles inland. On the risht bank, h a mile down from where we are and some distance inland, is Qabr- al-’Abd (13 houses of Jibur). On the left bank, f of a mile below us, is Safi] (25 houses of Jibur), on the hills on that side. An island on the right side of the channel begins between ’Araij and Safij. The right bank hills appear to be limestone, the left bank hills at first con glomerate, changing later to limestone or sandstone. At 2 hours 48 minutes we reach the lower end of the island. At 2 hours 57 minutes the left bank village of Havi Arsalan is passed (15 houses of Jibur); it is situated at the water’s edge below hills. There are islands now on both sides of the channel. At 3 hours 13 minutes, on the left bank, is Little Hamairah (50 houses of Jibur). Here the river turns to south-west. At 3 hours 22 minutes is Great Hamairah (70 houses of Jibur) on the left bank 4 a mile inland ; it belongs to one ’Abdul Jalil of Musal The river is still going south-west. Here the hills retire from the left bank, leaving an alluvial stretch. , • i i i i? tt - At 3 hours 31 minutes is the landing place, on the right bank, for Hammam 'Ali which is 4| hours by land from Musal. It is at the lower end of a right bank island and is marked bv two dome-shaped hills ; the larger of these, about 100 feet hieh is called Tall-as-Sabat. To the west by north, at 300 yards, is one Hammam ’Ali Village to the north bv west at 500 yards is another ; the former consists of 50 houses of Lihaib and Al Bu Hamadi Arabs, the latter of 20 permanent houses inhabited by miscellaneous Muhammadans and 7 or 8 shops. Five islands are in siaht 3 unstream and 2 down ; and here the channel shifts from the left to the light bank ofTe river. The site of Nimrud and the Qarah Chogh hills are in line to the south-east. The Musal-Baghdad road passes through Hammam ’Ah. We visited the hot springs of Hammam ’Ali, which have a great reputation ; people come from as far as Zakho in the north, Kirkuk and Sulaimaniyah on the east and Baghdad in the south to take baths here. There are said to be 10,000 visitors in a season ; the season is from the middle of June to the middle of Sep tember The course is one of 3 baths per diem, lasting 10 to 30 minutes each, and continues' for 40 days. The visitors inhabit mud huts and temporary shelters (’Arlsh) paying £T. 1 or 2 as rent for each for the period of the course. The water in the springs, which are built over, is of a dirty green colour, has a bitu minous scum floating on the surface, and smells strongly of sulphur During the season a Municipality (Baladiyah) is constituted. Two licensed coffee shops here bring in £T P 200 a season, and the bitumen yielded by the springs is col lected and fetches about £T. 20. At 22 minutes after leaving Hammam ’Ali, where we have spent f of an hour, we pass Salahiyah (30 houses of Jibur) on the right bank. At about 36 minutes, on the right bank, is Jahainah (100 houses of Jibur). The Jibur hereabouts are Jibur-al-Wawi. At 53 minutes, on the left bank, partly on the river bank and partly at some distance behind a hill, is Salamlyah, 60 houses of Turkmans and Jibur Arabs. At 1 hour 16 minutes we reach the first ’Awayah or rapid which we have to pass on our way to Baghdad. The river is too high to disclose the nature of the object forming it, and it gives no trouble. There are again hills close to the right bank.36 ,, ] At }. hou f 26 minutes comes, on the left bank, Naifah (50 houses of Jahaish), the landing place for the Nimrud site. The left bank is low, shelving and gravel ly , on the right bank there are stony hills. There is a raft ferry here. Thechief mound at Nimrud, which we visited, is situated about 2 miles east- south-east of Naifah ; there are fine crops of ripe barley all the way thither. n* 0 nV he We See to the west ’ at about l i miIes » the village of Nimrud (150 houses of Shammattah and Jibur). Camps of Wawi and Jahoni are visible to the west across the Tigris. .. ’Awayih SfMuna^at again&gt; and “ 25 minUteS W6 paSS &amp; rapid known f , ?? ru i !ul,es a called Wadi Jahannam comes down to the rivei on Wt wTf ln i medla 1 tel y below a small island, similarly named, near the same k. Not far from this point, on the left bank, we saw the village of Saiyid Hamad, consisting of 60 houses of ’Ajl Jibur and Jahaish. It is near the river u an island called HawIjat-al-Hisan intervened between it and us. richtWnl-^Tklfn W6 P « SSed , a ca ! 1 , ed .

There is an island here dividing the n o two , we follow the north-eastern side of it; the south-western channel also contains a rapid. Just below this place there are considerable rock cliff* on the right bank of the river, rising in places to 20 or 30 feet. At 1 hour 30 minutes, comes the village of Umm-al-’Asafir ; I omitted to note on which side of the river it was. It is in two parts of almost ^uaTsize divhled by a gully, each containing 20 to 25 houses of Wawi Jibur. 1 ’ d At 1 hour 37 minutes on the left bank is Jaifah, a village of Jibiir TW. . iTnT t£ 0 T T tbe nv , er - and 100 more are said to fie less than a^mileif land. Here the direction of the river changes from south-east to south-west. At I hour 48 minutes there are sunken rocks near the right bank makino broken water.

Opposite to it, on the right bank, is Talul-ash-Shok, 30 houses i Tihfir A small island has its head between these two villages, and on both ° ^ the banks down stream appear low. The average width of the Tigris stream, thus far, has been perhaps 200 to 250 yards ; much greater breadths will here after be met with. At 2 hours 55 minutes the river, here about 500 yards broad, again divides ; we take the left hand channel. Immediately afterwards we see on the left hand about f of a mile inland, the village of Hasan Tashqal, 100 houses of Jibnr. At 3 hours 3 minutes, after the island on our right has ended, is Manqubah, 'll rro 9^ houses of Jibur. Two minutes later cliffs again appear within ablut half a mile of the right bank, and the QarahChogh hills show up to the east by south. from which gmiu bought at Shamimah la shipped. This gram afSolo^o, ^“vVSl^h-Sh.-,, for Baghdad; about ft of the quantity is said to be wheat and barley. ' At 3 hours 25 minutes we pass the deserted site of Tammah on the right bank, which here again inclines to be high and bold. On the left bank is the village of Sultan ’Abdullah, consisting of 50 to 60 houses of Jibur. At 3 hours 38 minutes there is an island on our right with large Gharab (Euphrates poplar) trees. At 3 hours 55 minutes Zawiyah is left behind on the right bank it is a settle- ment of ’Ajl Jibur, composed of 50 permanent houses and about -00 tents. At 4 hours 3 minutes Makuk, a village of 100 houses of Jibur about 2 miles inland from the left bank, was said to ^opposite us ; and at 4 hours 27 minutes Khabbatah, a village of 50 houses of Jibur occurs on the left ban£. • At 4 hours 53 minutes we reach what we take to be the landing place for the Oaivarah bitumen springs and tie up ; here are cliffs on the left bank and a low eravel island near the right bank. The place, however, proves to be the wrong one and we go on for 10 minutes more to a spot where there is a considerable encampment of Jibur on the right bank. We thus take 5 hours and 3 minutes from Nimrud to Qaiyarah, or (3'31+l-26+5-3=) 10 hours in all from Musal to Qaiyarah. Qaiyarah. (18th May 1910.). Before continuing our voyage towards Baghdad we paid a visit to the Qaiyarah bitumen springs and oil refinery. fiT 'ttf A?20minutes tmHe ^an'ily t^m tcrostT-at°30 minutes an old Qa^ o^ fortified enclosure is passed ; and at 35 minutes the new oil works are reached. The bitumen springs are situated in the beginning of some low hills, where they ±ru ^ fe ,. , , , form an* expanse of bitumen, irregularly in : y * Shaped, with an average diameter of about 100 yards. The surface is all bitumen, in places hard, in places viscous, in places soft; C223GSB58 and there are oozings, here and there, of sulphurous water. The bitumen is collect ed soft in the open watery spots and packed in skins ; what is taken away during the day replaces itself in the night. The crude bitumen sells at the springs for half a Beshlik per skin of about 40 lbs., or approximately 81bs. for a penny. The oil produced here is distilled from crude bitumen of the consistency of stiff treacle. Twenty tins of bitumen yield 10 tins of oil, of which 2 are of the first quality, 2 of the second, and 6 of the third. The first quality is colourless, the second yellow, the third black; and the third quality must be refined a second time before it is fit for any purpose except anointing camels against mange, but more bitumen is mixed with it before redistillation. The fuel used for distillation is crude bitumen ; and the residue left in the retort is bitumen, and is allowed to flow away. Some 40 to 50 tins of oil are distilled at Qaiyarah daily. The oil is sold at the distillery at the following rates :— Per gallon. 1st quality ^ ^ 2nd quality ....... 5d. 3rd quality ... .. ^ 3}d. Even the 1st quality oil smells strongly of some impurity : the odour resembles that of benzine. In the time of’Abdul Hamid Qaiyarah belonged to the Sultan’s Civil List, for which it was worked by Ibrahim Pasha. A French expert was brought from Constantinople, and about £T. 5,000 was spent in experiments, probably borings, but without increasing the yield of the springs. In 1908 there were various com petitors for a lease oi the springs, including a European firm. The present con tractor is said to pay £T. 500 a year to the Turkish Government, but on the data given above as to output of oil and price this would seem to leave no margin for profit; there is therefore probably some sale by him of crude bitumen. The present plant is primitive and the buildings are of little value. There were about 200 tins of refined oil in the store at the time of my visit, of which more than half were of the first quality. Qaiyarah to Khandidah. (18th May 1910.) After seeing Qaiyarah we started again down the river. At 20 minutes we passed a village on the left bank, viz., ’Osajah, 25 houses of Jahaish Arabs. Here the hills retire from the left bank, but 14 minutes further on low conglomerate cliffs appear on the right bank, with something similar on the left bank opposite. At 36 minutes Wadi-al-Massal comes in on the right bank and brings some water to the river ; it appears that it does not come from Qaiyariyah, as might be supposed. At 49 minutes there is broken water due to rocks. At 55 minutes the village and mound of Hajj ’AH are passed ; I omitted to record on which side of the river they lay. The village consists of 25 houses of Jibiir. The mound looks artificial and there are marks of digging in it; below it was a considerable Arab encampment. At 1 hour 4 minutes is Tall-ar-Raqubah on the right bank; it is a conglomerate mound about 50 feet high. At 1 hour 17 minutes is the right bank village of Ma’tuq, 20 houses of Jibur, with an island in front of it. The bank is comparatively low hereabout. Just after this cliffs of mud, conglomerate, rock, etc. begin on the left bank ; they are called Chahalah.24 39 At 2 hours 32 minutes, the cliffs having ended some time before this, we reach the left bank hamlet of Qan’us, 5 houses of Jibui. A little below it, on the same side, is a mound bearing the same name. At 4 hours 2 minutes rocky bluffs topped with conglomerate begin on the right bank : these are called Jabal Mataq. At 4 hours 45 minutes, some time after the bluffs have receded from the right bank, we are opposite the village of TalQl-al-’Aqr on the left bank. Here is a ferry called Ma’bar-ash-Sharqat, with one boat. There are only 7 houses of Jib fir at this place. The mounds from which' it takes its name are 22 minutes further on. At 5 hours 42 minutes we reach Sharqat. Just above it a hollow called Wadi- ash-Shababik comes in on the right bank. Sharqat. At Sharqat we w-ere hospitably received and shown over the excavations by the German archaeological staff. The ancient site of Sharqat is a steep hill on the west side of the Tigris, which it overhangs. The ruins go back to early Assyrian times, ciz., about 2000 B. C.,but earlier relics of the bronze and even of the stone age are found under them. A Parthian palace and a poor Parthian town existed on the same site in later times, and there are Muhammadan remains dating from about 1200 A. D. Sharqat possessed one of the great towers dedicated to superior divinities of which only two others are known to have existed in Assyria, viz., those of which the traces remain at Nimrud and Khorsabad. The only possible indications of ancient foreign relations discovered are, we were informed, some metal articles which may be from Cyprus and some objects of ivory. With reference to the last it may be noted that elephants existed on the Khabur, not very far from here, in early times The Sharqat excavations are managed by a Committee connected with the Berlin Museum ; and the funds are provided, in part at least, by the Prussian Gov ernment. It is not known how long the work will be continued. Excavation work is not congenial to archaeologists ; it is therefore carried on here by agents who are primarily architects or engineers, and most of the deciphering of inscrip tions is done in Germany. I gathered that the early British explorers of this and other sites had been very successful in finding and removing most of the striking articles of interest, and that attention is now chiefly concentrated on disentangling the foundations, and working out the ground plans, of the build ings of different periods. Inscribed bricks, etc., are also found which yield some information. The ruins are so completely flattened out that nothing can be known from them regarding the roofs of the ancient houses, etc. After a three hours’ halt at Sharqat we resumed our joumey. At about 27 minutes some low bluffs on the right bank, which have their begin ning a little below Sharqat, become high and cliffy ; eventually they attain perhaps 150 feet. They are part of what is called Jabal Mak-hul. At 56 minutes we came on two rocks projecting out of the river in mid-channel; the water was breaking over them. They are called Abu Sharib. The left bank is pretty high hereabouts, of mud and conglomerate. At 1 hour 33 minutes the hills retire again from the right bank. Four minutes later a low verdant strip, known as Shati-al-Jidr, occurs on the left bank. At 2 hours 3 minutes is a rock near the left bank, called Sakhr-an-Namal. At present it is submerged and invisible, but in summei it stands 5 or 6 feet out of the water. Steep clay banks have begun on the left, and stony bills are againapproach- ing the river on the right. At 2 hours 17 minutes was a rock, Farraj, making rough water near the right bank which is here high and broken. There was some talk about rapids, and it seemed to be the opinion of our boatmen * They now said that those were only true only* those of Jahainah and Sanadlq •Awayaha or rapids on the nver. ^ ^ ^ were due to artificial obstacles in the river ; at both of these places, they said, cut stones and building work are visible when the river is low. Jahainah is the more40 complete of these two constructions, each of which has a passage f° r ra ^ 8 through the middle of it. The boatmen opined that they were sills made by Nim- rud to raise the level of the river near his town, and it would seem natural to sup pose that they were dams of some sort rather than bridges. At 2 hours 36 minutes there was a mound with an Arab encampment near the left bank. The place is called Qubbat-al-Hadidi, but we saw nothing suggesting an “ iron dome.” This reach of the river is called Sabaik. At 2 hours 51 minutes we reached the Qal’at-al-Bint or “ Maiden’s Castle, which stands on the right bank at a sharp bend of the river, here only 150 yards broad, or even less. The sun had set, and it was growing dark, so we passed on without landing. The castle is remarkably situated on an isolated rock and com mands two reaches of the river, looking up the one and down the other. We could distinguish what appeared to be a masonry bastion and part of a curtain, the latter loop-holed at the top. At 3 hours 6 minutes there was a sound of rushing water towards the left bank, but the boat men denied the existence here of any ’Awayah or real rapid. The place was called Traishah. At 3 hours 31 minutes began on the left bank a permanent camp of the Jibur, called Hawi Dindi, said to be an hour’s walk in length, and to extend from this point to the junction of the Little Zab with the Tigris. It was too dark now to see, but we could hear the barking of dogs. At 4 hours 1 minute the confluence of the Little Zab with the Tigris was passed. Just below it, was a place called Shajarah, but no permanent village. At 4 hours 19 minutes were mounds and broken water called Hamra, at the right bank. At 4 hours 51 minutes was passed Tall Marmus, a mound on the left bank. At 6 hours 21 minutes there was a sulphur spring on the right bank. At 7 hours 26 minutes the Tigris entered a cutting through the Hamrin hills, which it here traverses, a place called Fat-hah being on the left bank at the entrance. A police post w’as said to exist on the opposite bank. Five minutes later came rocks and broken water. At 7 hours 51 minutes it being now about midnight, the raft was moored to one of a group of islands called Khandldah on the right side of the main stream of the river. Khandidah to Samarra. {19th May 1910). At 30 minutes after starting from Khandidah there was broken water near the left bank caused by rocks called Suwair. At 40 minutes the land on the left bank is called Umm-al-Lilah, and that on the right bank Sufairlyah. At 45 minutes the village of Umm-al-Laqlaq, consisting of 50 houses of ’Obaid Arabs enclosed within a wall, is passed on the left bank. On the right bank, a minute or two further down stream, is a white-looking police post known as the Skaraimlyah Nuqtah : near it there is said to be a Khan (caravanserai), but the latter is not visible. • Between Umm-al-Laqlaq and Sharaimiyah is a broad island bearing the name of the second of these. The river here must, on account of the island, be nearly a mile in width from bank to bank. At 1 hour 10 minutes there is a village of 15 houses of Jibur Arabs on the right bank ; it is known as Ba’aiji. At 1 hour 50 minutes we are passing what is described as the head of the Naif ah canal, said to run to Samarra ; it shows as a hollow between two mounds.41 A Khan called Kharmmah, on the Baghdad-Musal road, is said to lie inland from the right bank hereabouts, perhaps two miles off. All this morning we have been passing islands between us and the right bank. They are grown over with tamarisk and harbour francolin. At 3 hours 25 minutes a conspicuous object known as Qal’ah Raiyash is seen on the right bank. It consists, according to our informants, of masonry remains , and it is situated on the top of rocky cliffs which, having begun £ or 3 miles further back, here approach the right bank. On the left bank, nearly opposite, are en campments of the Al Bu ’Ali tribe. At 4 hours 40 minutes there are camps of the Jibur Arabs on the right bank abreast of us and also downstream. At 5 hours 30 minutes steep conglomerate cliffs called Jabal ’Ajzan, rising to as much as 80 feet, adjoin the right bank ; they have already accompanied it for some distance, say 2 miles. Five minutes further on a low strip of knd known as Hawi Mataridah begins on the right bank between the cliffs and the river, while the left bank opposite is cultivated and goes by the name of Moh-al-Hisan. (Moh is said to be another name for the vegetable also called Lubiyah.) At 5 hours 58 minutes we reach a locality on the left bank styled Tall-as-Suc[ where there are ruins on land, and in the water rocks said to be uncovered in the low season. A little further on there is an island in the river. ^ On the right bank the hills continue ; they are said to be all one range from Kharmnah to Tiknt and beyond, but opposite Hawi Mataridah their name changes from Jabal * Ajzan to Jr.bal Sa’luah. At 6 hours 10 minutes we reach the end of Hawi Mataridah, and conglomerate cliffs on the right bank come down to the water’s edge. At 6 hours 35 minutes the right bank is called Qaim, and its high cliffs are of mud and conglomerate. On the left bank the date palm, long unfamiliar, reappears. At 6 hours 45 minutes we arrive at Tikrit, the reputed birth place of the great Saladin, whose tomb is at Damascus. Here we again see in the river the Quffah, a round basket-work coracle smeared with bitumen, which is one of the most cha racteristic objects of the Baghdad country. Tikrit stands on the right bank of the Tigris on conglomerate cliffs, which at the middle of the town rise to a height of Tlkrit ‘ 50 or 60 feet. The left bank opposite is low • and at the time of our visit the river appeared 500 to 600 yards broad, but on the Tikrit side it was shallow, people wading out as much as 100 yards from the shore The frontage of the town on the river is 400 or 500 yards. The place has about 950 houses and is the headquarters of a Mudirate under Samarra. Wheat, barley wool and skins are exported, and merchants come from Baghdad to buy these Sheep are exported overland to Syria. We learn that the men of Fikrit are largely employed as raftsmen on the Tigris, and that some are settled at Musal in connection with this profession, which very few natives of Musal itself adopt. We are told that a tax is levied on rafts by the Turkish authorities : the skins sup porting each rafts are counted when it is finished and half a Sagh piastre (or approximately one penny) is levied per skin. After an hour’s halt we continued our journey, and at 1 hour approximately from the start reached the end of the Tikrit cliffs. Here there was an encamp ment of Baijat Arabs on the right bank. At 1 hour 27 minutes, there is land called Hatrah on the left bank, and 5 minutes later we pass rough water caused by some rocks which are said to stand out of the river “ as high as a camel ” in the low season. A raft carrying 100 bags of grain was lost here in 1909. At 2 hours 7 minutes we reach a rock called Dahri and more broken water. It is said that this rock does not uncover even at the low season. At this point there are, on the right bank, some temporary cultivators from Samarra. Three minutes C223GSB42 later come more rocks called Dahri which are said to uncover to the extent of feet in the low season. At 2 hours 19 minutes are the rocks of Dor, near the left bank ; some of them show, some are invisible. Those at present submerged are said to rise 6 feet above water in the low season and to divide the river into various channels. At 2 hours 30 minutes we have opposite to us, on the left bank, the village of Dor. It has about 500 houses and is the seat of a Mudir. Next to us is a small island ; beyond it a large island with water lifts and cultivation ; and beyond that again the branch of the river on which Dor is situated. Between Dor and the river is Imam Dor, a high square, dark-coloured building, with round bastions slightly indicated, and a top shaped somewhat like the point of a shrapnel but diminishing in diameter by 5 stages, the lowest of which has flat faces. The build ing is covered with storks’ nests. Dor is a scorched-looking place ; there is no greenery about it. The people are all Sunnis. Below Dor both banks are low for some way. At 2 hours 42 minutes there are rocks called Haraqiyat near the left bank ; they are said to project 5 feet in low water. Various streams into which the river has divided recombine here and give it a breadth of about 400 yards. At 3 hours 2 minutes low conglomerate cliffs begin on the right bank. Eight minutes later there is an opening called “ Rasasi ” in conglomerate cliffs upon the left bank. It is evidently the head of an old canal, but the bottom of it is now some 15 feet above even the present level of the river. On the right bank here, half a mile inland, is a mound called Mahaij ir. At 3 hours 27 minutes there are water lifts and cultivation stretching down the right bank. At 4 hours 45 minutes we pass mud ruins on the left bank : they are insignifi cant, but are described as “ Old Baghdad ”. The left bank is of conglomerate and raised, the right bank is cultivated and has many water lifts. At 5 hours 14 minutes we reach a place called Qafas Shinas on the left bank. Before it we pass round a large bend of the river which does not appear in our maps. A little futher down are trees, marking the site of Bisat, a village of 25 houses of Samarra Arabs. On the right bank opposite Shinas is an A1 Bii ’Abbas village, consisting of 30 houses of Samarra Arabs. At 5 hours 22 minutes is Hawai Sullat, a village of 20 houses of A1 Bu ’A 1 bas, a tract extending from the first A1 Bu ’Abbas village, above mentioned, for about 3 miles downstream all bears this name. Since passing “ Old Baghdad ” no cliffs nor hills have been visible near the river on the left bank. At 5 hours 36 minutes the left bank still bears the name of Bisat. Some houses are visible on it. There have been various islands since passing “ Old Baghdad ” and the main channel of the river, which lies towards the right bank, has seemed to wind a great deal. At 5 hours 43 minutes the well-known ruin of Qal’at ’Ashiq, “ the Lover’s Castle,” is seen' standing a short way inland from the right bank. The walls have fallen down in lengths, leaving high standing portions, which almost resemble pillars ; but it is growing too dark to see. At 6 hours 3 minutes there is a small village on the island of Quwair, which is between us and the left bank. Seven minutes later we reach the end of Quwair island, and the ruins of Qasr Qal’at-al-Khabfah (“ The Caliph’s Fort Palace”) are visible some distance inland from the left bank. Therb are islands about, carrying some small trees or bushes. At 6 hours 19 minutes is the village of ’Abid on the right bank ; it consists of 20 houses of “ Sawamirah ”, that is Samarra people. There are good high banks now on either side of the river. At 6 hours 37 minutes our raft is tied up at the landing place for the town o f Samarra, which last is at some minutes distance inland from the left bank.IM \ 43 Samarra to ’Ausajah. (20th May 1910.) The antiquities of Samarra need no description here. Accurate accounts of them have appeared, since our journey, in and Dr. Herzfeld’s “ Somarra,” and the latter authority's researches are not yet finished. Samarra is enclosed by a fine brick wall in perfect preservation, and there is ample space within the enceinte for a considerable increase of the town. The streets are comparatively wide and, fora town in this country, remarkably clean. There are about 900 houses and 90 to 100 shops. The revenue of the Municipality is said to be only £T.200 a year. Drinking water is brought from the river ; water for other domestic uses is drawn from wells. Some Persians and a few Jews are settled here, and there is a small British Indian colony, mostly Kashmiris, none of whom were registered at the time of our visit. The importance of Samarra depends on its Shi ah shrines and the pilgrimages in pencil the following indictment of the Khadims, which is the more interesting as probably not having been intended far any European eye: appointed the previous year. The Kilid-dar has power over the Khadims, whom he can exclude from the sacred precincts. The Khadims, some of whom exercise their calling regularly and some occasionally only, belong to various Taifahs or tribes. Only about 15 are officially recognised by the Turkish authorities, but the others who work without recognition are very numerous. Those who show the Sardab Sahib-az-Zaman, or underground place where the Mehdi is supposed to have disappeared, belong to the A1 Bu ’Abbas and A1 Bu Nisan Taifahs, which, oddly enough, are Sunni. Those wffio sh'ow the ’Askariyain, or burial place of the Imams, are of the Taifahs Al Bu Salih Shaikh (to v r hich the Kilid-dar himself belongs), Al Bu ’Abbas, and Al ’Ashashah. There is much fine Daim land about Samarra, that is land on which crops are grown by rainfall without the help of irrigation, and it bore a fine harvest in the year of our visit. Most of the land in the district is Miri, i.e., owned by the Government, which leases it to individuals on rent. There are no large free-hold proprietors in the neighbourhood. Our raft was got under way again in the afternoon. At 55 minutes we passed Tinah, 10 houses of the Al Bu Nisan, on the right bank. Here are good ripe -crops. At 1 hour 13 minutes, at Qaim, there is an opening in the conglomerate of the left bank marking the head of a canal. At 1 hour 37 minutes the right bank shows ruins called Istabalat, situated on high ground also a police post, seemingly in perfect order, but said to ha\e been unoccupied since an attack upon it by the Shammar tribe 3 years ago. At 1 hour 51 minutes the head of the Dujail canal is shown on the right bank ; it is cut through high earthy ground and is narrow and deep, with great mounds of excavated silt beside it . Below this the banks appear low, and the tract on the right bank is called Qubban *, there are Arab camps, but no permanent vil lages. Samarra. Miss G. L.

There were many* * A A guide for Indian pilgrims, paid by the dis- complaints of the ill-treatment of pilgrims room in a house some Persian had scribbled “ Nous sommes arrives a cette Sainte Place le 16 Rebieh-el-Aval 1326 apres pelerinage. Nous partons le 18 de ce mois, mais helas que les Khuddams nous ont fait beaucoup de mal : ce ne sont les justes Khuddams, mais ils sont des brigands et des malfaiteurs.” The Kilid-dar or key-keeper of the shrines was Saiyaid Hasan, who had beeniff' Will 44 At 2 hours 25 minutes, we see on the left bank the head of the old Jals'yah canal. The canal seems to be a very large one, and the huge piles of silt clear ance along it resemble high railway embankments. At 2 hours 49 minutes we reach a ferry where there are 3 boats, capable of carrying 50 or 60 persons each. On the right bank are a hut and 2 or 3 sheds ; a very few gendarmes are stationed here in summer, and in winter are transferred to the opposite bank. By crossing here from the right bank to the left travellers from Baghdad to Samarra can reduce the remainder of their journey from 6 hours to 4, i.e., can save 2 hours. The telegraph wire here crosses to the Samarra side. Here we noticed 14 large Quffahs which had come up from Baghdad to collect Juss (gypsum mortr.r) and firewood. At 3 hours 5 minutes we passed A1 Hawai, a village of 25 houses of “ Sawa- 4 mirah ” and A1 Bii Daraj Arabs, on the left bank. Opposite, on the right bank was an encampment of Mujamma’ (possibly “ miscellaneous ”) Arabs. At 3 hours 17 minutes the river divides ; the land between the branches, at this season an island, is called Barqah. The left branch passes the caravanserai of Khan Mizraqchi, one to two miles down it; the right branch passes Tall Jab- ba -at on the right bank at 3 hours 27 minutes. The telegraph line is to the west of the river. At 3 hours 40 minutes we are opposite Khan Misraqchi, but at a great distance from it. Khan Sawiyah is mentioned as in the same direction ; it is apparently not another Khan, however, but the locality in which Khan Misraqchi is situated— so at least say our informants. The banks of the river are now of the same character as about Baghdad, that is to say they consist of firm alluvial soil, stand 10 to 15 feet high, and carry numerous water lifts. The breadth of the river is now generally about 300 to 350 yards. At 4 hours 9 minutes we arrive at the head of a right bank island called Jazl- rat-ad-DarawIsh. Here are several Charads (water lifts) in full swing : the culti vators are Sawakinah. On the left bank of the river, opposite, is a camp of the A1 Bu Daraj. At 4 hours 30 minutes w^e are at the lower end of Darawlsh Island, and at 4 hours 53 minutes at the middle of Tuthah, another right-bank island. At 5 hours 35 minutes we are passing through a reach called Ba’rurah, after which there is an island called Bahairlyah on the side towards the right bank. At 6 hours 16 minutes comes the end of Bahairlyah Island, and 8 minutes later Dalai’ah, a camp of Jibur Arabs on the left bank. At 7 hours 3 minutes, on the right bank, in a tract occupied by Al Bu Han- dhal Arabs, is Safinah, a square enclosure where the Turkish authorities receive and store agricultural rents paid to them in kind. At 7 hours 41 minutes, on the right bank, is Habbab, a walled camp of ’Azzah or ’Obaid Arabs. At 7 hours 59 minutes we pass ’Ausajah, a camp of ’Azzah Arabs on the right bank ; and 7 minutes further on we halt for the night. ’Ausajah to Malluh. {21st May 1910.) In 40 minutes from getting under way the next morning we arrive at the end of the reach called ’Ausajah. At 1 hour 10 minutes there is a temporary cessation of the water lifts on the right bank. At 1 hour 30 minutes we are at Qubbah Shawali which seems to be the end, on the right bank of the shingly zone of the Tigris.45 (Tt V v At 1 hour 43 minutes the *Adhaim stream flows into \&gt;he Tigris on its left bank. At 2 hours 16 minutes we enter a reach called ’Aqab. At 2 hours 27 minutes we enter the reach of Sufait, on which there is a camp of Al Bii Haiyazah (’Obaid) Arabs. We are informed that in this district each ordinary water lift of 2 pulleys pays £T. 5 a year to the Turkish Government. At 2 hours 66 minutes .we are in the Ahmad-al-Faiyadh reach, where there are 25 to 30 water lifts on the right bank. Somewhere hereabouts, near the left bank, is said to be another Khan-as-Safinah, like the last a Government grain store. At 3 hours 42 minutes we are passing through the Kuwar reach, so called from some brick kilns. At 4 hours 18 minutes the reach we are in is called Dojmah on the left, and Khadhairah on the right bank. Khadhairah directly follows Ahmad-al-Faiy&lt;idh, i.c., presumably, Kuwar is confined to the left bank. At 5 hours 12 minutes we pass Himma, opposite to which is Zambur; I for got to note which of these two was on which side. At 6 hours 7 minutes is the head of the Husai reach, so called on the right bank ; and 35 minutes later we are passing water lifts on the right bank which are still called Husai. At 7 hours 2 minutes the banks on both sides of the river are quite low, and the river seems as much as 500 yards broad. At 7 hours 14 minutes we are at the middle of a reach called (on the left bank) Dagharah, and the breadth of the stream is about quarter of a mile. At 7 hours 35 minutes we are opposite to the date plantation of Jaizani on the left bank. Jaizani village is said to lie a little way inland and to consist of 50 to 100 houses of Shi’ah Arabs. At 7 hours 57 minutes the date groves of Sindlyah begin, and quarter of an hour later we reach Sindiyah itself, which is on the left bank of the river It was here that Mr. Tabor, one of Sir W. Willcocks’ engineers, was fired at by Arabs with rifles while surveying in the bed of the river m the winter of 1909-10, and it does not appear that his assailants have ever been brought to justice ; it was pretended that they were strangers from elsewhere. Sindiyah consists of 100 houses, perhaps rather less, of Shi’ah Arabs belong- J • ing to the Bani Tamim, Dilaim, and Smdiyah. other tribes ; there are only 4 or 5 house holds of Sunnis. There are no shops. Opposite it, on the other side of the river is a grove of gharab (Euphrates poplar) which serves as a halting place for caravans from Baghdad. Sindiyah is included in the Mudirate of Daltaya. There are some lands in the village assigned “to the Prophet, that is to the Makkah shrines, and these were held on lease, at the time of our visit, by Anwar Baig, one of the Haidarizadah family of Baghdad. Here we met the first grain-purchasing boats of the season coming up the river from Baghdad; they were running before a fair wind which greatly retarded our own progress. At 37 minutes after leaving Sindiyah we were in a reach called, on the right bank, Tuwair. Nine minutes later we passed a ferry of one Quffah. At 1 hour 11 minutes, detached date groves belonging to Sa’dlyah village beean on the left bank. It is at Sa’diyah, written by the Germans Sadije, that the Khanaqin branch of the Baghdad Railway is intended to cross the Tigris ; the name is therefore likely to become better known. At 1 hour 34 minutes we nass Sa’dlvah itself ; it is on the left bank and consists of about 100 houses of \rabs Shi’ahs, as are all the inhabitants of the Khalis tract, or that watered from the right bank of the Diyalah. Behind Sa’diyah are date groves, and ]ust below it is a tomb said to be that of the Banat-al-Hasan. At 2 hours 10 minutes we pass the pump of Haji ’Lmr, in a reach styled (on the right bank) Shaikh Jamil. C223GSB46 At 2 hours 40 minutes a tract called Tarrmyah begins on the right bank ; it is marked by the end (head or tail) of a high silted-up canal which has been cut away by the river ; this landmark is called Ishan Tarmlyah. At 3 hours we are said to be opposite Mansuriyah on the left bank, but the vil lage is hidden by date plantations. It consists of 200 houses of Shi’ahs. Below it is a tomb, said to be that of the Bani-al-’Abbas. At 3 hours 6 minutes we pass the head of the Tarmiyah canal on the right bank. It is above the present level of the river, and we are told that water now very seldom passes into it. The width of the river here is 400 to 500 yards. Just below Tarmivah are signs of the head of an embankment, or possibly another canal, having been cut away by the river. At 3 hours 56 minutes the river is more than usually broad; the breadth seems about 600 yards. At 4 hours 10 minutes we reached the end of the reach called Tarmiyah on the right and Mansuriyah on the left bank. A strong wind from the south-south west now drove our raft on to the left bank, and for more than an hour we could not move. Forty minutes after starting again we had the tract of Has-hus, with numer ous water lifts, on our right. On the left bank opposite was Raqqah, a locality without a village. At 1 hour 35 minutes Qaisariyln, a village of 100 Shi’ah houses, was on the left bank. At 1 hour 49 minutes the tract of Has-hus ended, and that of Suwaidiyah began, upon the right bank ; while on the left was the village of Hawaish, 300 houses of Shi’ah Arabs. At 3 hours was the end of Suwaidiyah on the right bank. At 3 hours 27 minutes we passed on the left bank Jadidah, a village of 200 Shi’ah houses ; and on the right bank a reach called Malluh began. At 4 hours 2 minutes a reach styled Yahudiyah began on the left bank, Malluh still continuing on the right. At 4 hours 27 minutes we tied up for the night in the Malluh reach. Malluh to Baghdad. {22nd May 1910.) Starting early we reached the end of Malluh (right bank) in 20, and that of Yahudiyah (left bank) in 25 minutes. At 35 minutes a tract called Babi began on the right bank. At 55 minutes we passed Rashdiyah village on the left bank; it seemed to consist of a two-storeyed house and a few cultivators’ huts. At 1 hour 5 minutes the tract of Babi ended and that of Mashahidah began upon the right bank. At 1 hour 23 minutes we passed Sawakin on the left bank, consisting of 10 houses of Shi’ahs and 2 brick kilns. About this time, not long after sunrise, the southerly wind, which had fallen at sunset on the previous evening, began again. A raft, having considerable surface and no means of propulsion, is greatly retarded by contrary winds ; at bends it is driven on shore ; and, when the wind is sufficiently strong, the current will no longer carry it along even in midstream. At 2 hours 3 minutes Dawudiyah, a village of 15 houses of Shi’ah Arabs, passed on the left bank.47 At 2 hours 30 minutes the wind compelled us to tie up at ’Awaijah, a village of 30 houses of Mashahidah, opposite to which there is an enclosure on the left bank. Forty-three minutes after getting under way again we passed Hasaiwah, a hamlet of 6 houses of Mashahidah, on the right bank ; here the tract called *Awaijah ends. On the left bank opposite there are poplar trees and the tract is still called Dawudiyah. It should be noted that the Mashahidah of the right bank villages are Sunnis, and so differ from the inhabitants of the opposite bank. At 1 hour 8 minutes, further progress being impossible owing to the wind, I disembarked just above the head of a small canal called the Nahr-al-Pasha, intending to save time by walking to Baghdad. At this point is a little village, with another a few minutes walk above it; both villages are Waqf, i.e., held in trust for spiritual or secular purposes. The inhabitants are Dilaim, but no tolerable riding animal could be procured. The Nahr-al-Pasha is about 5 yards wide and several feet deep ; it is spanned near its head by a brick bridge. Even in the present favourable state of the river it is high and dry. Before going many miles I had the fortune to fall in, at Fakhamah, with friends who hr.d a carriage. Mr. Gaskin, who remained by the raft, brought it safe to Baghdad about nightfall, the wind having fallen in the meantime. On the next day occurred the greatest storm known at Baghdad for a generation. We were fortunate in getting off the river before it happened. J. G. LORIMER.50 APPENDIX B. Information about Routes, etc., in the Rowanduz district, communicated by ’Abdullah Pasha, hereditary chief of Rowanduz and ex-official of the Turkish Government, 4 Shaqluwah to Rowanduz. —There is a more direct road from Shaqlawah to Rowanduz than that by Batas, but it is also more difficult for mules. It is that through Baizan. The dis tance is 10 hours. In winter this route is blocked by snow. Rowtinduz to Koi San^dq. —The 3 stages on this road are : Rowanduz by Darband Ali Baig to Binavi (7 hours) : Binavi to Siktan (8 hours); Siktan to Koi Sanjaq (5 hours). Rowanduz to Rdmyah. —The easiest way is to follow the Koi Sanjaq route to Binavi and one hour further to a place called Khata. The further stages are : Khata to Chlwah (7 hours, easy, along a valley) ; Chlwah to Sarwisawa (6 hours, easy) ; Sarwisawa to Raniyah (3£ hours, easy, over a plain). There are more direct routes from Rowanduz to Raniyah, but they are more difficult, and in winter they are blocked by snow. Rdwanduz to Rdyat and beyond. —The stages are : Rowanduz to Dargalah (5 hours, a good useful road) ; Dargalah to Gal'ilah, where there is a Mudir under the Qaim-Maqam of Rowanduz (4 hours pretty easy going, but stony); Galalah to Rayat (G hours pretty easy going). At Rayat there are a quarantine station, a telegraph office, and a post of gendarmerie. Beyond Rayat there is a hill, Garwi Shaikh, to be surmounted ; after that the plain of Lahijan is entered. The next stage is reached at Shlnawah (3 hours, fairly good going, presumably after coming out on the plain). At Shinawah there is a cross-roads. • One route runs thence, through the Mangur country, in which the chief place is Narain, to Sardasht and. Banah. Another runs as follows to * . , c „ . . “ Saui bula.q Shinawah to Lagbal (6 hours easy, t.e. “Suj ala . oyer p i a i n ) ; Lagbal to Maidan Bulaq (2 hours through hills, but easy) ; Maidan Bulaq to Saujbulaq (3 hours, hills, but easy) This latter is a caravan route. Paswah, a Turkish military station, is 3 to 4 hours from Lagbal; the road is to the left of that going to Saujbulaq, and is easy, running over a plain. it should be noted that the passes between Rayat and Shinawah are sometimes blocked by snow in winter for one, two, or even three months. The natives then use a kind of snow shoe for crossing them. ... . . . ... . . . . - Rowdnduz to Urumiyah, etc—The stages are : Rowanduz toBadilyan (2 hours, easy); Badil- yun to Sidakan (4 hours, some hills, but easy) ; Sidakan to Bainkmah (3 hours, easy); ascent of the Kuh-i-Chailashin pass ; to Shno, | a small f t.e. “ Ushnu.” town where there is a Qaim-Maqam. From Shno one road goes to the right to SundusJ and Saujbulaq. Another goes to the left to Margawar, where there is a lurkish X i.e. “ Solduz.** Nahiyah, and so to Urumiyah. The Chailashin pass is sometimes under deep snow for three months in winter. Rowdnduz to 'Aqrah.—The stages are : Rowanduz to Shaitnah, where good tobacco is grown (5 hours, fairly easy but through hills); Shaitnah to Baidarun (8 hours a difficult road), Baiba- v ’ J run to Raizan§ on the Zab (3 hours, all down hill § Evidently the same as Baraizan, see page 29. ^ stee p anc l stony); crossing of the Zab no il Or Birikaprah, see page 29. ^ ra f t . f rom the ferry to Bir-i-Kapran[| (3 hnurs easy going) ; BIr-i-Kapran to ’Aqrah (7 hours, up and down, mostly up ; two bad hills).

Waznah is reached by turning to the right at Maidan Bulaq or from Paswah ; it is distant 1 day from the former and H days from the latter place. Waznah stands m a plain with low hills and is about the same size as Batas. Sav,jbulaq is as large as Arbil. Sardasht has about 200 houses. Lahijan, when used as the name of a place, means Paswah. Naghadah is the headquarters of the Sundus district; it is about the same size as Altu Ndhiyahs of Rowdnduz.—The Qaza of Rowanduz comprises the following 4 Nahiyahs with headquarters as below— Nahiyah.

In the low season the Tigris is fordable at the following 8 places between Musal and Baghdad :— 1. At Jahainah (see page 35); 2. At a place called Shaqq, immediately above the junction of the Little Zab with the Tigris (see page 40) ; 3. At half an hour’s walk above SaTuah (see page 41), 4. At quarter of an hour’s walk above the Dahn rocks (see page 41) ; 5. At the middle of Bisat (see page 42 ); 6. At Tinah (see page 43 ); 7. At Darawlsh Island (see page 44 ); and 8. At Bahairlyah (see page 44 ). All of these fords are pebbly, and there is always a part in each where the water is breast hi „ h (,v B —This disagrees from what I was told by one of the German archaeologists a Sharqat that, in using the steam launch belonging to the Mission below Sharqat, he had found a tdace^'n the low season there was not more than half a metre of water anywhere m the river.) There is never a ford where there are rocks. No native sailing boats go above Simarra. Even in the low season they could no doubt get to Tikrit but only by carrying half cargoes. In other seasons than the lowest the current would be too strong to tL'above Simarra. The largest vessels reaching Samarra itseU only carry 8 tons. In the height of the floods a raft may get from Musal to Tikrit in 24 running hours, and from Tikrit to Baghdad in the same. But, as above Tikrit it is dangerous to run by night, the least that the whole journey can be performed in is about 60 hours. J. G. L. r,. M Press, Simla. —No. C. 223 G. S, B. 21-1-13 .&gt;0.
