B, S' Boundary between Persia and North- West Baluchistan. In the year 1870-72, General Goldsmid was em ployed in determining the Persian boundary (1) with Afghanistan in the direction of Sistan, and (2) with the Khan of Kalat’s territories in South western Baluchistan. A gap was left between the southernmost point of his Sistan award and the northernmost point of his Mekran delimitation. These points are de termined by the following passages in the two awards:— 6r' il Eastern Persia, 1870—72,” edited by Sir F. J. Goldsmid, p. 413. * This place is of course distiuct from the Kohuk named in the Mekran award. Enclosure to Government of India, Secret Letter, No. 82, dated 20th December 1871. Sistan .—“ The main bed of the Helmand there- “ fore below Kohuk should he the eastern boundary “ of Persian Sistan, and the line of frontier from “ Kohak* to the hills south of the Sistan desert “ should he so drawn as to include within the “ Afghan limits all cultivation on the banks of the “ river from the Band upwards. The Malik Siah “ Koh, on the chain of hills separating the Sistan • c from the Karman desert, appears a fitting point.” Mekran .—“ Commencing from the northern- “ most, point or that which is furthest from the sea, “ the territory of Kalat is hounded to the west by “ the large Persian district of Dizzuk, which is “ composed of many dehs, or minor districts, those “ on the frontier being Jalk and Kalagan. Below “ these two last named is the small district of “ Kohuk, which, together with Panjgur, comprising “ Parum and other dependencies, is on the Kalat “ side of the frontier, while on the Persian side is “ Bampusht.” Letter from Foreign Secretary to Major- General Goldsmid, dated 20th May 1871. (Enclosure 12 to Government of India Secret Letter No. 61, dated 20th September 1871 ). This letter gives a resume of the past relations of Kharan with Baluchistan and Afghanistan. A still fuller resume of Azad Khan’s relations with Kalat, Afghanistan, and Persia will be found in an Indian Foreign Office Memorandum, dated 21s£ May 1876, on page 05*7, of Home Correspondence, No. 11 o/1876. Prom these passages it will he seen that Malik Siah Koh was chosen as the limit of the Sistan award because it was a suitable site between the Sistan and Kerman deserts and necessarily the limit of the “ Sistan ” dispute. It is not stated or implied that south of this point the Persian frontier marches with Kalat territory. The Mekran boundary decision shows that General Goldsmid considered the northernmost limit of the Kalat territory marching with Persia to lie just east of Jalk. The reason why General Goldsmid did not lay down the boundary north of Jalk was that Azad Khan of Kharan was then independent, at least of the Khan of Kalat. The following is an authoritive statement on this point:—“As regards Punjgur, “ and indeed all his lands except Kharan, Azad “ Khan has, I am to remark, always been con- “ sidered a feudatory of that State (i.e., Kalat); “ but as regards Kharan, the Government has left “ his allegiance to Kalat or Cabul an open question, “ on which it does not seem to His Excellency in S. 42. Amm- 2 “ Council to be advisable now to initiate a dis- “ cussion. In any case, be is certainly not in any “ respect a feudatory of Persia.” General Goldsmid did not directly consider the claims of Kharan. Hence subsequent grievances of the Khan of Kharan that we assigned to Persia his right over Jalk and Hizzuk, and allowed his further rights over Kohuk to be usurped by Persia (though General Goldsmid had drawn the Persian frontier west of the Kohuk district). The Kohuk question is a very thorny one, and led to endless negotiations and correspondence after Persia’s first acceptance of General Goldsmid’s boundary, which it must be remembered gave Kohuk to Kalat, though practically independent of the latter. What took place is thus summed up in Aitchison’s treaties. “ A request* was subsequently “ preferred by the Persian Government that the “ small district of Kohuk, lying below the Jalk and “ Kaiagan subdivisions of the Dizzuk district, and “ which had been included on the map within the “ Kalat frontier, might be made over to Persia. “ This was so far agreed to by Her Majesty’s “ Government that the line forming the western “ boundary of Kalat was drawn to the east of “ Kohuk, 'but no opinion was expressed as to the “ position of the Persian frontier. Kohuk was “ occupied by Persian troops in May 1874.” The following is a description of the Chiefship of Kharan. “ The principal tribe and ruling family “ are Naushirwanis and their present head is Sardar “ Sir Nauroz Khan, K.C.I.E., who succeeded his “ father Azad Khan, when the latter died in 1886 “ at the reputed age of 99. The chiefs of Kharan “ have at different times acknowledged subordi- “ nation to Kalat, Persia, and Afghanistan; they “ are, however, in reality, Baluchis, and in 1884 “ Sardar Azad Khan acknowledged allegiance to “ the Khan of Kalat by taking his place among the “ Sara wan Sardarsata durbar held by the Governor “ General’s Agent at Panjgur. . . . Besides “ Kharan, the Sardar holds land in Panjgur, and he “ lays claim to Jalk, Dizzuk, and Kohuk.” General Goldsmid thus states his views as to “ the best means of bringing the boundary {i.e., of “ Persia) to be laid down in Sistan into corre- “ spondence with that of Baluchistan, so as to give “ one general line of eastern frontier to Persia from “ Lash Jo wain to the sea.” . . . “If the “ matter at issue were merely of a geographical “ nature, undoubtedly the line suggesting itself is “ one from a point above, i.£., south of, Kamal “ Bandar at the elbow of the Helmand to the “ Mashkidf east of Jalk, and from the elbow of “ the Mashkid, between Kohuk and Panjgur, to “ Gwattur Bay, agreeably to last year’s settlement. ’ . . . “ Data have been supplied for defining a “ permanent line in Sistan, also for rectifying, ^ if “ thought fit, the already accepted line in Mekran ; “ and the connection of the two by intervening “ demarcations sufficiently specific and practical to In consequence of his services to the Persian Army against the British in 1856, Jalk, Dizzuk, and Sibb were made over to Azad Khan, who had acknowledged himself a subject of the Shah.

Kohuk was in the possession of a Nau- shirwani chief, the head of whose clan would therefore be Azad Khan.

Supposing all doubt and discussion on “ the two boundaries* investigated fairly set at rest, “ there appear to me to remain two ways of eom- “ pleting the work begun :— “ 1st. By wording the terms of mutual under- “ standing, in whatever form conveyed, so as to “ restrain Persia from advancing eastward of a “ certain line drawn between the Helmand and “ Jalk, rather than to invest her with full or 45 sovereign authority over all people and lands “ within that line. This arbitrary line could not, cc it is true, divide the territories immediately in &lt;c dispute, hut an umpire State, adjudicating “ between countries such as those concerned, may “ reasonably provide that the flank of either litigant &lt;c be not turned by aggressive movement, as for the cc non-transgression of the actual boundary line “ declared. “2nd. By sending an officer of Engineers to “ survey the intervening tracts in question, awaiting “ his report of the tribes and people before linking u the two boundaries in one. &lt;c I most respectfully suggest adoption of the “ former way.” The Government of India adopted this suggestion and urged that the Persian Government should be pressed to accept a modification of General Gold- smid’s decision of 1871. In an “Amended Note” they proposed to concede Kohuk to Persia, and to add the following clause :—“ It is moreover understood “ that the Persians assert no claim, right, or title “ to the tracts north of Panjgur, or on the right “ bank of the Mashkid (= Mashkel) river, from Kohuk upwards.” This note was never accepted; it was communicated to the Persian Government, hut further negotiations came to an end when Lord Salisbury declined to give way in regard to Persia’s claim to Kohuk. The difficulty of sending engineer officers to survey the intervening tracts, according to General Goldsmid’s second suggestion, was exemplified by Colonel Macgregor’s reconnaissance in 1876-77 along the Mashkel route, during which he had apprehen sions of attack from Azad Khan, then regarded as an enemy. The country between the northern point of General Goldsmid’s line and the Helmand was at this date absolutely unknown. To return to Kharan affairs. Azad Khan, after assisting the Persians against the English in 1856, and receiving in return possession of Jalk, Dizzuk, and Sibb, joined in the following year the rebellion of Baluch Sardars against the Khan of Kalat. On the failure of this rebellion and of his subsequent attempts on Panjgur, Azad Khan took refuge at Kandahar, and declared himself an Afghan subject. When the Khan of Kalat sought in 1859-60 to subjugate Kharan, the Amir Dost Mahomed inter vened so energetically, that the British Government, after having called upon the Amir not to “ allow “ any of Iiis officers at Kandahar to interfere “ between the Khan of Kalat and his rebellious4 ** sul)j6cts 55 (i.G.y Azad Khan), GxplainGd their request by assuring the Amir that they had not intended to declare Kharan a dependency of Kalat, hut had simply advised His Highness not to permit his officers to interfere in the differences in regard to Azad Khan’s possessions in the territories of the Khan of Kalat. In 1865 Azad Khan was again aiding the rebels against the Khan of Kalat, and in 1870 he was again a refugee at Kandahar; and he was claimed as an Afghan subject by Amir Shir Ali in a letter he wrote to the Khan of Kalat regarding Azad Khan’s claims. Yet again in 1871-72, Azad Khan joined the rebels against the Khan of Kalat, and again withdrew to Afghanistan, where he was once more acknowdedged as a subject by the Amir. For the next few years Azad Khan contented himself with raids upon Jalk, Dizzuk, and Kohuk, in consequence of which complaints were made hy Persia to the British Government. His position in 1876 was thus described by the Government of India: “ He is virtually in- “ dependent, but owns nominal allegiance to “ Kabul.” In 1884 Azad Khan, under Sir Robert Sandeman s auspices, obtained a reconciliation with the Khan of Kalat, as one of his Sardars. Previously, he had written to the Amir of Afghanistan to_ ask if there would be any objection in Kabul to his submitting to the British Government, and the Amir gave his consent.* Azad Khan’s motive was to obtain the recognition by the British Government of his son Naoroz Khan as his successor. By this means he prevented fratricidal quarrels at his death, which the Persian Government would have taken ad vantage of for encroachment on his territories. Sir Robert Sandeman strongly advised the acceptance of Azad Khan’s submission. He thus describes Persian frontier policy :—“ Sir P. Goldsmid did not “ define the whole frontier from the sea. up to the “ pointf in Sistan where the three frontiers of “ Baluchistan, Afghanistan, and Persia meet. “ Prom the latter point the boundary for some two “ hundred and fifty miles, bearing more or less “ due south, to the point where the Mashkid, or as “the Baluch call it, the Mashkel river, escapes from “ the hills, was, for various reasons, left unsettled. “ This includes the stretch of country where the ‘‘ Kharan boundary marches with that of Persia. “ I have no doubt that the latter Power would be “ exceedingly averse from having a hard and fast “ frontier defined. Her conduct in 1870-71 shows “ that we should have to deal with a tortuous and “ irritating policy. It is far easier for Persia to “ encroach on Kharan when she finds opportunity, “ and to hurry with her complaints to the British “ Minister at Teheran directly Sardar Azad Khan “ attempts to retaliate. It is certain that she has “ at different times endeavoured to encroach most “ unjustifiably, she has attacked Sardar Azad Khan’s “ fort at Gulagah, and aided Sabika Reki in his “ attempts to destroy the feudal tie existing between “ the Rekis and the ruler of Kharan. And yet # In a very characteristic letter. See p. 83, of India Political [Proceedings for for Decembtr 1884. Pages 39-43 of India Political Proceed ings for December 1884. t Malik Siah Koh.5 “ any one studying the case from the correspondence recorded in this Office would he forced to the “ conclusion that Sardar Azad Khan was a mere “ robber chief, raiding on his innocent and unoffend- “ ing neighbours from a sheer loye of plunder and outrage. I believe the true facts of the case to “ be very different. “ It appears to me that the very reluctance of Persia to have the boundary fixed, is a strong “ argument in favour of the delimitation being carried out without delay. Persia’s game all “ along has been to try alternately to harry and “ cajole Sardar Azad Khan into becoming her “ subject. The Sardar must have been sorely if tempted at times, but he has refused the overtures “ made to him.” Sir Robert Sandeman then refers to the Sardar’s claims to Kohuk, Talk, and Kalagan, and goes on :— “ A settlement of the nature which I have had the honour to propose, would not only prevent any e undue advance by Persia in the direction of Baluchistan, but would do more than anything “ else to preserve peace in the country. Sardar “ Azad Khan’s raids on Persian territory have been “ almost altogether of a retaliatory nature. When “ for instance the Persians took revenue from his It is to be remembered that Kalagan was li district of Kalagan, he made good his loss by declared to be Persian territory by General “ plundering in Jalk and Dizzuk. In the same GoltUmid - . “ way he has protested against Persian interference “ with the Rekis and Damnis who inhabit the Reki “ country. “ Sardar Azad Khan promises to stop raiding on “ Persian territory if Jalk, Kohuk and Kalagan are restored to him. I have stated my views as to the former place ; and I can see no objection “ to any inquiry being held with regard to the two latter, and a decision being given in conformity “ with the evidence produced. Until this is done, “ I see little hope of peace on the frontier, or of the “ cessation of Persian complaints against Kharan “ and vice versa.” Letter dated 6th November 1884. The Poreign Secretary to the Government of Political Proceedings for December 1884, India, in replying to Sir Robert Sandemau, wrote : P - 169, “ In addition to your report upon the settle- “ ment, you represent at length the advantages of “ bringing Azad Khan within the Baluch con- “ federacy. You suggest the payment to him of a subsidy, the rectification of his frontier, and ap- paiently some sort ot guarantee to the execution “ °f bis will. As a reason for incurring these “ obligations you dwell on the strategic importance “ of Kharan. The Governor General in Council is “ not, however, prepared to accept without quali- “ fication your views upon this last point, nor does “ he think it desirable to undertake the respon- sibilities which you advocate. The demarcation of the Baluchistan frontier towards Afghanistan “ and Persia would at present be specially incon- “ venient; and if the proposed guarantee were “ given, it appears possible that the British Govern- “ ment might find itself bound to enforce the terms S. 42, b6 “ of a will which professed to dispose of lands now “ in the possession of Persia. In any case the “ British Grovernment would incur a responsibility &lt;c which might be exceedingly difficult to discharge. &lt;c At the same time, the Governor General in cc Council fully recognises the expediency of “ bringing Kharan, if possible, under the control “ of Kalat and the influence of the Baluchistan “ Agency.” The results of Sir Bobert Sandeman’s inter vention in Mekran affairs in 188S were mostly temporary. Another effort was made in 1890—92. The then condition of affairs is thus described :— “ In Kharan we have a powerful chief, nominally “ a vassal of the Khan of Kalat, and under the con- “ trol of the British Government, which pays him a “ handsome yearly allowance. He is, however, also “ in friendly relations with, and in receipt of allow- “ ances from, two other neighbouring States (Persia “ and Afghanistan). In Panjgur the Naoshirwani “ interest, which I have shown to be not un- &lt;c favourable to Persia, has been steadily increasing “ in power, and that of the Gitchis and of the Khan “ of Kalat has been as steadily dwindling. The cc country has been devastated by raids, in which “ Persian subjects have taken an active part.” The “ danger of Persian aggression ” was con stantly before Sir Bobert Sandeman’s eyes in writing this report, and he strongly recommended “ continued British intervention” by the presence of a European officer and British force in Panjgur. He concluded his report by saying : “ In order “ that the full benefit of these arrangements should “ be felt, it is extremely desirable that a definite “ understanding should be arrived at with Persia “ regarding the part of the frontier which has not “ yet been settled. Such an understanding would “ at once remove all grounds of controversy “ between our officials and those of the Persian &lt;c frontier, and would go far to promote the cordial “ relations which it is so desirable to establish. “ Our position at Panjgur and Kharan will greatly “ facilitate negotiations to this end, and I trust “ that the necessary steps may be taken to obtain “ the assent of the Persian Government to Com- “ missioners meeting to settle the boundary during “ the next cold season.” But the matter had already engaged the atten tion of the Government of India. Persian com plaints against Sir Naoroz Khan of Kharan (before he had come to an understanding with the Persian frontier officials) were thus dealt with by the Government of India. It was pointed out that “ the disturbances of which both the Persian “ Government and Sir Naoroz Khan complain “ have their origin in a dispute as to the owncr- “ ships of the country inhabited by the Beki “ Baluch tribe on the Mashkel river, who occupy “ what is known as the Mashkel district.” The Bekis had been claimed by the Persian authorities of Karman and Bampur as Persian subjects ; See Sir Robert Sandeman’s Report, dated 22nd April 1891, in Political Proceedings for October 1891,/?. 109.

Correspondence followed between the India Office and Foreign Office, in which the proposal for demarcating the frontier was pressed; but on 5th February 1890, at the instance of the Foreign Office, it was decided to let the matter drop for a time, as the demarcation simultaneous with the arbitration in the Hashtadan dispute was considered inopportune. In connection with the appointment of Russian agents in Kain and Sistan, the question of demar cation has again been mooted by General Gordon. In forwarding General Gordon’s memorandum the Director of Military Intelligence writes, “ the sub- “ ject is one of importance, and begs most strongly “ to recommend it for the Earl of Kimberley’s “ favourable consideration.” The subject of this frontier has also occupied the attention of the Secretary of State this year in connection with complaints by the Persian Govern ment of raids by the Rinds, a more or less inde pendent tribe to the east of the line laid down by General Goldsmid. Further, when the Government of India an nounced the withdrawal of the British civil and military establishments in Mekran, the Persian Government asked if there would be any objection to their taking such action as they thought tit against the Rinds and also towards the Sardars of Kharan and Panjgur, seeing that the British Government had “ evacuated ” the country. The Persian Government was informed that the Government of India had not withdrawn their political control over the country. On this point the Governor General’s Agent wrote : “ I am most “ strongly of opinion that no more dangerous “ course could be adopted than to allow Persia to “ interfere in South-Eastern* Baluchistan.” . . . “ When Mir Mahmud has somewhat consolidated “ his power, I see no reason to doubt that the “ dispatch of a portion of his troops to Mekran “ may result in the restoration of order in that “ district. Since the removal of our troops, Mekran “ has fallen into a state of anarchy, very shortly “ to develope from the partial into the complete. “ Should Mir Khudadad Khan be retained in power, “ nothing can save Mekran from falling entirely “ under Persian {i.e. Russian) influence, au oh-.“ viously most undesirable result from an Imperial “ poiut of view, or from being restored to order “ by the return of the British regular troops, which “ have been lately withdrawn.” Meanwhile the Persian Government have been See H. merely told that it is hoped that arrangements for securing order may shortly be made. It is not the first time that the Persian Govern ment have shown their inclination to extend their empire over the portion of Baluchistan which lies under British protection. In 1876 when new h. ( arrangements were being made with the Khan of Kalat, the Persian Minister “was instructed to “ inquire what were the inteutions of the British &lt;e Government in reference to Kalat. Was it intended “ to annex it wholly or in part, or was there any “ design of rectifying the frontier of British India “ in that quarter ? He asked further whether we had “ interfered in the internal affairs of Kalat, and if “ so, to what extent ? Malcolm Khan went on to say “ that his Government had in former times claimed “ Kalat as belonging to Persia, that of late years “ that claim had been waived, as it was thought, “ on the understanding that the independence of “ the territory in question should be respected by “ both Persia and England, but that if Her “ Majesty’s Government asserted territorial claims “ over it, those of Persia would also revive.” At Lord Salisbury’s suggestion, the Persian Govern ment was given to understand that the policy of Her Majesty’s Goverment in regard to Kalat was not liable to be affected by the assertion of any reversionary or contingent claims of Persia to the territories now ruled by the Khan. It was held that the Sbah’s formal acceptance of Mr. Alison’s letter of 1st September 1871, submitting General Goldsmid’s boundary decision, was a final aban donment of Persian claims, of whatever value these might be, based on the short-lived and long- dead empire of Nadir Shah. The terms in which the Shah accepted Mr. Alison’s note are curious. Mr. Alison’s words were:—“The undersigned, &amp;c., “ acting on the part of his Government, has the “ honour to submit for the approval of His Majesty “ the Shah a map in which the boundary line “ between the territories possessed in Baluchistan “ by Persia, and the territories forming the ex- “ elusive property of the independent State of “ Kalat,” &amp;c. The Persian Minister in acknow ledging Mr. Alison’s note wrote:—“ Your Ex- “ cellency’s letter of the 1st instant, together “ with the map of General Goldsmid, the British “ Commissioner, respecting the frontier line be- “ tween the Persian possessions in Baluchistan “ and the Baluchistan dependencies made over “ to the independent State of Khalat, have “ been received, and have both been submitted “ to His Majesty the Shah. In obedience to “ His Majesty’s orders I beg, in reply, most “ respectfully to state that the Persian Govern- “ ment, notwithstanding the clear right which a, 826 of 1893 , 287 of 1876.v* H.

St. John’s map, with the amended note, was never accepted by the Persian Government. See Sir E. Hertslet's memorandum of 19th December 1889, enclosure to Secret Despatch to India of 24th January 1890, No. 3. have oyer Baluchistan, to the wishes of Her Britannic Majesty’s Government that the ques- “ tion should be brought to a satisfactory con- “ elusion by the definition of a boundary line, has “ hereby accepted your Excellency’s letter and the “ map.” Till 1871 the history of this portion of Baluchistan had been a history of constant Persian encroachment. General Goldsmid’s line assured to Persia those districts of which she had placed herself in de facto possession, but it estopped (excepting as regards Kohuk) her further en croachments. It is a bar, as she herself has recognized, against her occupation at the present time of Tump. But there is no settled line to act as a barrier to Persian encroachment north of Jalk. Here her traditional policy is still unchecked. She is seeking to “ harry or cajole ” the important chieftains, such as the Khan of Kharan, into submission to herself (it would appear that she has so far succeeded as to arrive at some working understanding with Sir Naoroz Khan); and she is nibbling at tracts which are only loosely dependent on the Khan of Kalat or the Sardars of the Baluch confederacy. Such tracts are the Mashkel and Dehgwar. Persia is averse to delimitation. She has nothing to gain by it. When it comes, it will, following General Goldsmid’s precedent, probably confirm all de facto Persian possession north of Jalk. There fore, the more she can encroach before delimitation the larger the possessions she will eventually secure. Again, delimitation would be a final bar to any hopes of ultimate acquisition of Kharan. And finally, when delimitation begins to be discussed, her right to continue to occupy Kohuk is sure to be questioned. Meanwhile her occupation of this district, of now nearly twenty years’ standing, though unauthorized, is not likely to be dis turbed. When delimitation was last proposed, the disinclination of the Persian Government to accept it was shown by the terms of the Persian Minister’s reply of the 23rd November 1889, “the origin of the above complaint” (i.e., “of “ the oppression and excesses of Naoroz Khan”) “ was taken to be a difference as regards the border, “ which difference was identified with the district “ 0 f Mashkel, the sole solution of the question “ being deemed to be by the appointment of sur- “ veyors on both sides; but whereas in these near “ years the question of the frontiers bet ween the “ two Governments by means of the Goldsmid “ map and St. John’s corrections, which lawfully “ left Persia the district of Kohuk, was finally “ settled, and room for necessitating the appoint- “ ment of surveyors on both sides does not remain, “ and it is not necessary to delimitate new frontiers “ daily. It is clear that the district of Mashkel, “ the name of which so far was unheard of, but “ which was brought forward by the other side, S. 42. G /1 * 10 “ should it be within the Kolmk district, or should it “ he identical with the Kolrak district, or else west “ 0 f the Goldsmid line, is undoubtedly dependent “ on Persia, and the settlement of this is apparent &lt;e hy reference to these two maps. ^ . But if Persia is averse to delimitation, is the Khan of Kharan more likely to he inclined to it P Sir Kaoroz Khan would no doubt like delimitation if it would give him all he claims, viz., Dizzuk, Jalk, Kalagan, and Kohuk, as well as the Mashkel. But it cannot give him the three former; if weight is to he attached to twenty years’ occupation, it will not give him Kohuk. It may not give him all he claims in the Mashkel district. It will probably put a check on his intrigues with, and may put an end to his allowances from, Persia and Afghanistan. Anv general settlement accompanying delimitation would also stop further encroachments of the Kharan family in Baluchistan. ^ The policy of the Kharan family in effecting their encroachments is described in Colonel Beynold s report of 13th May 1890. Sir Naoroz Khan is therefore not likely to be eager for delimitation. If an end is to be put to the anarchy now rampant in this part of Baluchistan, the deli mitation of the boundary from Jalk northwards and a final settlement of the Kohuk question, however difficult, are absolutely necessary. Perhaps it would be better not to propose delimitation to Persia until the new regime at Kalat has got into work, and the Agent to the Governor General^ in consultation with the Khan, has been able to arrive at some reasonable scheme for establishing peace and order in Panjgur and the frontier districts. But the question of delimitation should not be long delayed. The extension of Bussian influence to Persian Sistan might complicate the question if long postponed. The letter from the Government of India of the 23rd September 1889, and Mr. Duke’s memorandum enclosed in it, deal with the Persian claims to the Mashkel tract, which would be the most important issue at stake in delimitation. At present in our maps the approximate boundary is shown by a broken straight line from Malik Siah Koh and a point just east of Jalk. Attached is a memorandum on this subject, written by Captain Macdonald (who has lately returned from Mekran). His arguments in favour of speedy delimitation are thus summed up:— “ (i.) It will put a stop to intrigue between ‘ c Persia and Kharan for the possession of “ Mashkel, and prevent Persian aggression not “ only in Mashkel but at Kohuk. (ii.) It will “ enable us to settle definitely the relations between “ the Held chief of Mashkel and Sir Naoroz Khan, “ and thus enable us to interpose a trustworthy “ barrier between Kharan and Persia, (iii.) It will u reassure the people and the rulers of Mekran, and convince them that we have not lost interest in It is not one of these, it is north-east of the Goldsmid line.

H 19th September 1893 * * A ¥12 Confidential. Memorandum by Captain F. W. P. Macdonald on tlic Perso-Baluch J^oundaiy. Before noting on tlie advisability of appointing a Commission to delimitate the Perso-Baluch boundary, I think it well, for the proper under- standing of the arguments which I shall advanc in favour of such action, to give a brief sketch of Mekran politics as they stood when I left India. I presume that the history of IVIekran, its chiefs and people, and of our action m the country for the last three years, is well known, and I will theic- fore write very briefly. The rulers of Mekran are the Gitchis who have held the country since ley overthrew the now extinct Bohdi dynasty. They are closely connected with the Khan of Kalat, and are accounted of high rank. Hating the Persians, they are thoroughly loyal to us, but internal - sensions and a somewhat indolent character have so weakened them that their power is now over shadowed by that of Sir Nauroz Khan Tsaushirwani, the Sardar of Kharan.f The H 8 ® ° f i he wani power dates from Azad Khan, the father o the present chief, and the influence which he acquired has been extended by the energy of the familv generally, their clannish spirit, and by b Nauroz Khan’s astuteness and aptitude for intrigue. Sir Nauroz cannot be said to be trustworthy, but the members of his family are not united, and some of them would prove loyal to us. Ac the end o June 1893 I submitted to the Indian Poreign Office a note, in which I showed that our proper policy m Mekran would be the support of the Gitchis, and how it would be easy to sow dissension among the Naushirwanis to the disintegration of their power. I should state here that early m March 1893 the Agent of the Governor General in Baluchistan proposed to me to support the Naushirwams, and to hand over the whole of Mekran to Sir Kauroz Khan, his argument being that by advancing Sir Nauroz Khan’s interest we should bind him to us by of gratitude. When this scheme was suggested to me, I strongly opposed it. Since then and up o the 31st May 1893 (when I handed over charge of mv Agency i) I was not favoured by Sir James Browne with any communication on the subject o Mekran affairs, and I do not know what Ins views may now be. But I am as strongly opposed to the policy of heaping favours on Sir Nauroz Khan in the (I am sure vain) hope that we shall thus secure his loyaltv, as I am certain that an increase m the Naushirwani power will prove a source of dangei to us in Mekran, and I am convinced, from my * I here note that when I refer to the “ Persians ” or the “ Persian Government,” I mean the Persian Frontier officials. Their actions, objects, rights, and obligations are, I am sure, misrepresented by them to Teheran, and I am equally sure that His Majesty the Shah knows very little of the true state of affairs (if indeed he knows anything at all) on the borders of Baluchistan. | I wish to bring notice here that the Naushirwanis as a family have nothing to do with Mekran. Sir Nauroz holds certain lands in Panjgur, but as a “ jagirdar” of the Khan. Other members of the family have acquired lands in Panjgur and in Mekran generally (for their methods, see Sir R. Sandeman’s reports of April 1891), but they have no rights as a family. South-Eastern Baluchistan. *313 * Dated 22nd April 1891. V J personal knowledge of the late Sir Robert Sandeman, that he trusted Sir Nauroz Khan as little as I do. Indeed, a perusal of his later reports^ on Mekran affairs is all that is necessary to show that he earnestly desired to check the growth of the Kaushirwani power. Sir Nauroz Khan receives a subsidy from the Indian Government, he and his stoutest adherent and near relative, Mir Baluch Khan, receive pay from the Persian Government, and he is on the very best terms with the Amir Ahdur Rahman, though I have not been able to discover that he receives any fixed income from Afghanistan. Letters, messengers and “ khillats ” continually pass from Kharan to Persia and Afghanistan, and from these countries to Kharan, and every such interchange of civilities was duly reported by me to Quetta. I do not think that Sir Nauroz Khan has any fixed or definite object in carrying on an intrigue with Afghanistan, but his intriguing with Persia is, very certainly, with the object of ob taining possession of the fertile district of Mashkel, which lies between Kharan and Persian territory where the Perso-Baluch boundary has not yet been delimitated. But Persia also covets this district, and had advanced a ridiculous claim to the whole of the country as far as the Mashkel river. I make no doubt that she would take immediate possession of it could she but buy off Sir Nauroz Khan sufficiently cheaply; but Sir Nauroz has not yet been able to make up his mind whether he can drive a better bargain with the British or the Persian Government. Hence these intrigues, in which each side hopes to get the better of the other, and which will never cease until the boundary is definitely laid down. I have said that Persia has advanced a ridiculous claim to land as far as the Mashkel river, and it is hut right that I should give some explanation of this. Mashkel is inhabited by Rekis, who, it is well known, are feudally subject to the Khan of Kalat, through the Sardar of Kharan, whilst the country to the west of Mashkel undoubtedly belonged to Kalat until Sir P. Goldsmid’s boundary was laid down. Mir Khia, the chief of these Rekis, is a very upright, honest man. Both Sir Robert Sandeman and Sir James Browne were very favourably impressed with him, and for him I have the greatest esteem. He naturally fears both Persia and Kharan and is thoroughly friendly to us. I am intimately ac quainted with him, for dreading Sir Nauroz Khan he fled from his country and settled in Panjgur, whence he accompanied me to Quetta and Sibi, and I would undertake to be responsible for his loyalty. In a note which I submitted to the Governor General’s Agent in Baluchistan in August 1892, I pointed out the very great importance of settling the affairs of Mashkel, and the necessity of having a thoroughly loyal and well disposed chief between Persia and the untrustworthy chief of Kharan. The settlement of the boundary between Jalk and S. 42. D/ 14 the Koli-i-Malik-i-Siah would secure all this. It would secure Mir Khia against Persian aggression. It would put a stop to Persian intrigue with Nauroz Khan, and, until the Mashkel question is settled, it is vain to hope that Sir Nauroz will cease from intriguing. It will enable us to define the relations between Sir Nauroz Khan and the Reki Chief; until tins is done, Sir Nauroz will never cease from creating disturbances in Mashkel;* and it will confirm Mir Khia in his loyalty to us. But there is another reason no less (perhaps even more) important why the settlement of this boundary will serve our interests in Mekran. The decision of the Government regarding the with drawal of the troops from Panjgur was heard by the people (always excepting a few malcontents) and by the Gitchis with dismay, and this, followed by my departure on furlough, was regarded by them as a sign that the Government had lost all interest in Mekran. It was in vain that I pointed out to the chiefs that the troops having been withdrawn, I could be of no practical use to them from India. They protested that I knew them, their language, and their country, that they knew and trusted me, and that it was impossible for any one else to be in such sympathy with them as I was. All this, and the fact that no arrangements were made for the maintenance of peace in Mekran, convinced them that they had been abandoned to their fate, and they left Karachi deeply dejected. Now the down fall of Khudadad Khan and the elevation of his son Mahmud Khan, while it may be turned to the greatest account and should prove of the greatest value in shaping the future and in controlling the politics of Mekran, need of necessity make no difference in the status of individual chiefs, but, on other hand it may. Khudadad Khan (for good and sufficient reasons into which I need not enter here) has always detested the Naushirwanis, and Khudadad Khan and Mahmud Khan have been on bad terms for many years. Now, Mahmud Khan and the Sardar of Kharan are near relatives (the exact degree of relationship I forget, and I have not with me the genealogical tree which I compiled in Mekran), and it will be seen how large a field is open to Sir Nauroz Khan for intrigue and advance ment, the more especially if Sir James Browne adheres to his policy of supporting the Naushir- wani interest until their chief becomes a sort of second Khan of Kalat. I cannot exaggerate the bad results which I foresee from any increase in tho Naushirwani power, and in the note which I submitted to the Indian Foreign Office I put my views upon paper. This I can do again, if necessary, but 1 fear to make this note unnecessarily and tediously long. The result then of the deliberations on Kalat affairs may or may not prove of the greatest value to us in controlling Mekran politics and in strengthening our interests in the country, and may or may not alter the status of individual chiefs according to the policy adopted. Now we * In July 1893, Sir Nauroz invaded Mashkel with an army, and I was forced to write very plainly to him to prevent him from turning the whole country upside down. I succeeded in inducing him to withdraw, and he subsequently visited me at Panjgur, but it cannot be supposed that he will forget that he was thwarted, and he will, without doubt, take advantage of our absence from Mekran! The Government of India is very anxious that some such arrangements should be made, and Avhen I left Simla a report on the best means of maintaining the peace was expected from Quetta.15 may be perfectly certain that this is thoroughly well recognized by every man in Mekran and the adjoining districts, and I make no doubt that the whole country is on the tip-toe of expectation, for the immediate action of the Government will show the chiefs whether or not their belief that they have been altogether abandoned is well or ill founded. If a Commission were appointed during the next cold season to delimitate the Perso-Baluch boundary, I am convinced that it would have the effect of reassuring those who wish us well. It would show them that while we do not consider it advisable to continue the troops in Mekran, we have no intention of permitting Persia to swallow up the country, that we take an interest in its affairs and will not allow disturbances to take place. On the other hand, if we delay, they will lose, while those who see their advantage in our absence will gain, con fidence; the border chiefs may be driven from their homes or forced to make terms with Persia, and every day that passes will increase the difficulties of a settlement which must some day be effected. Another reason for the immediate settlement of the boundary is the activity of Russia. It was only on the 22nd of last June that His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief in India told me that the * Sir George White had for the moment Russians had established a new post “ somewhere”* forgotten the exact name of the place. in my direction. This, of course, is well known to the India Office, and I only mention it to draw attention to the fact that the post was established immediately after the evacuation of Mekran by British troops. The movements of Russia in Khorassan and Sistan are well known, and though the reports which I heard in Mekran during 1891, 1892, and 1893 were, without doubt, exaggerated, equally without doubt they were based on truth. If, then, we make no counter-move the people will be confirmed in their belief that we have lost interest in them and abandoned the field to Russia, and we shall alienate our friends while we forward the interests of our enemies. Thus far I have argued for a settlement which I have frequently urged on the Governor General’s Agent in Baluchistan. What his views may be I do not know, as I have not been favoured with them, and I imagine that Sir James Browne was so anxious to obtain a settlement of Mekran affairs that he paid little attention to the boundary ques tion, and in the circumstances thought it advisable not to press it upon the Eoreign Office in India. While at Simla last June I myself urged the neces sity of a delimitation of this boundary upon the Deputy Eoreign Secretary, but he replied that ee it raised such thorny questions about Kohuk “ that it was thought advisable to let it alone.” I venture, however, most respectfully to point out that the difficulties connected with the Kohuk question will not lessen as time goes on; rather they will increase, and I think that the fact of the Shah’s having ratified Sir E. Goldsmid’s boundary S. 42. E16 (wliicli gave Koliuk to Kalat) ought cortai nly to help and not to hinder us now. While on the subject of Kohuk, and in order to explain why “ the Kohuk question ” will become more difficult as time goes on, I may here note that in May 1892 Persia ad vanced an impudent claim to the revenues of Parsoli in the Panjgur valley, on the ground that Parsoli belonged to Kohuk. I replied that it was was impossible for me to recognize such a claim, hut that I was quite willing to examine any proofs which the governor of the district might think fit to produce, if he would visit me at Panjgur. Ihe circumstance and the action taken by me were duly reported to the Agent of the Governor General in Paluchistan, but I received no reply from Persia. This little instance will show the greed of Persia which pressed on me a claim to land belonging (according to Persian statements) to a district which she has no right to claim. With regard to the exact line of boundary between Jalk and the Koh-i-Malik-i-Siah we must remember that Mashkel is Peki country and within the territory of the Khan of Kalat, that it is very fertile, that to it one* good road leads from Panjgur and from it two*}* good roads lead to Sistan; that its chief, while hating the Persian, is thoroughly friendly to us, that he is widely and intimately connected with the chiefs and tribes of Sarhad and Sistan (who also cordially detest the Persians and look to us for help, and who would he very useful to us). If we remember this and are careful to protect his interests, I do not know that it matters much exactly where the boundary line is drawn, but we should, of course, take care to prevent Persia from making good a baseless claim to the whole of Mashkel. Pefore I close, I would make a few remarks on the Persian question, “Whether there would be “ any objection to the Panjgur chief putting “ himself under Persian protection ?” There is not the least chance of any chief in Mekran doing this voluntarily, and I have not the slightest doubt that this question is asked to cover some aggression on the boundary. In all probability, Persia will encroach on Parsoli in the Panjgur valley (the district referred to by me above), or will invade Mashkel, perhaps do both. Persia is hated in Mekran, she is hated and feared throughout Perso-Paluchistan, and I have received several letters from the chiefs of Sarhad inviting me to march into their country and administer it. I have also received letters from that excellent and highly respected chief, Mir Kadir Pakhsh, and from * other influential headmen of Dizzuk (a district once admittedly belonging to Kalat, see old Gazetteers, hut now administered by Persia), begging me to go and deliver them from the Persians. The only man in Kalati Paluchistan who in any way intrigues or is friendly with Persia is Sir Nauroz Khan, and his object is the possession of Mashkel. * There are several, one is good f There are others too.17 In conclusion, I will sum up the arguments in favour of the speedy delimitation of* the boundary:— I. It will put a stop to intrigue between Persia and Kharan for the possession of Mashkel, and prevent Persian aggression, not only in Mashkel, but at Kohuk. II. It wiU enable us to settle definitely the relations between the Eeki chief of Mashkel and Sir Nauroz Khan, and thus enable us to interpose a trustworthy harrier between Kharan and Persia. III. It will reassure the people and the rulers of Mekran, and convince them that we have not lost interest in them, and that we do not intend to let them he absorbed by Persia or Kharan. It will indirectly tend to check the growth of the Naushirwani power. V. It will serve as a counter-move to 'Russia, and will show the people (and this is of the very greatest importance) that we have not abandoned the field to Russia and do not fear her. Against the Commission I can give no argu ments, except that of “the thorny question of Kohuk.” But, as I have said, I do not see how time will make this less thorny, and the faet that the Shah has agreed to a boundary west of Kohuk should prove a help to us. In 1889 the Indian Foreign Office addressed a letter to Her Britannic Majesty s Charge d Affaires in Teheran, suggesting the speedy delimitation of the frontier between Jalk and the Koh-i-Malik-i-Siah, and if the Teheran Government is now agreeable there should be no difficulty in appointing the Commission.
