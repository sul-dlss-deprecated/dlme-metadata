We have no comments on the plans put forward by the Koweit Oil Company for the construction of their new aerodrome* The question of the renewal of the Koweit Civil Air Agreement is, as you know, bound up with the position of the R*A*P. in Iraq* If we are cou 5 &gt;elled to relinquish Shaibah, we might wish to build an alternative base in Koweit. However, although we have failed so far to persuade the Iraqis to ratify the revised Treaty, I understand that the Foreign Office and our Ambassador in Baghdad still feel that, given the time, -die Treaty will be ratified. This will give us the right to continue to base air forces at both Habbaniya and Shaibah. Failing ratification of the Treaty, presumably will then stand firm on the present 1930 Treaty which holds good for 23 years* Notwithstanding the above, we should like to see the Koweit Civil Air Agreement renewed, purely as an insurance if things go badly for us in Iraq* You will understand, however, that in view of the considerations set out in paragraph ^ above, the R.A.F* interest in the renewal of the Agreement cannot be said to be very strong, and although the Air Ministry would be prepared to pay a large share, if not all, of the £500 paid annually to the Sheikh, on the assumption that the Ministry of Civil Aviation feel unable to contribute, we could not agree to any obligation to meet the cost of improvements to die aerodrome. Such improvements are mentioned by the Political Resident, in his letter of the 29th January, as being necessary to the renewal of the Agreement* I am not sure, however, whether this holds good any longer in view of the fact that the Koweit Oil company proposes to construct an entirely new aerodrome, which will, presumably, include the facilities and improvements mentioned by Hay* A F.A.K.

(m.w. im) \From C A R Southwell' S Office Teu: Paddington 14-53/9 14-5Q CONFIDENTIAL. 1 Great Cumberland Place, London, W 1. 1st April, 1948. ^ Dear Sir, Mr. Southwell is at present in Arabia and I am therefore writing to acknowledge your letter of the SOth March, enclosing a copy of the Air Navigation Rules and Civil Air Agreement for Kuwait. These will be placed before Mr.Southwell on his return. Yours truly. Secretary to Mr. Southwell. F.A.K. Harrison, Esq., Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street. London, S.W.l.2. You will appreciate that the management and control of civil air facilities at Kuwait as Agents of is a responsibility which lies outside the normal scope of operations of this Company, and that for this reason it is essential that we should know precisely what the proposal made in Mr.Donaldson* s letter No«Ext»2118/47 of the 16th Oc tober, 1947, entails* I should, therefore, be grateful if you could furnish me with a more detailed exposition of the proposal which would define the obligations and responsibilities which would devolve upon this Conpany in the event of acceptance. I should like to receive detailed information as to the relationship between H.M.G-* and their Agents, particularly so far as these would concern the implementation of International Air Agreements and instructions and advice issued by the I.C*A*0. In addition to this the following points also occur to me sis needing clarification. (1) Would the Coup any be under any obligation to adop- 1 - ' r ^ ^ standards concerning meteorological reports, wir&lt; communication, aerodrome lighting, etc? (2) Would civil air lines using the Conpar)y*s aero dr claim against the Conpany in the event of an acc: cause of which was alleged to be attributable to negligent management of the aerodrome?1 Great Cumberland Place, London, W 1. (3) What authority would the Company have as H.M.G- 1 s Agents, to ^enforce discipline? For Instance, what disciplinary action 'jould be taken against pilots either for dangerous flying or for disobeying flying control instructions? ( 4 ) What authority would the Company have for checking aircraft papers load sheets, etc., and to what extent would they be responsible for seeing that these papers were in order and that no dangerous practice, such as the overloading of aircraft, was allowed to take place? (5) What would be the position if operating companies require to introduce at their own expense facilities additional to those provided by this Company? We ourselves would not wish to see the introduction of additional amenities and facilities over which we had no adequate control (6) What do H.M.G. suggest as a suitable reimbursement for our undertaking this responsibility It is possible that the number of air lines wishing to use Kuwait will increase and that this increase will necessitate the substantial reinforcement of the aerodrome staff. It seems unlikely that landing fees will cover such expenditure or form a reasonable contribution towards the maintenance and up-keep of the aerodrome which any substantial number of aircraft unconnected with the Conpany^ operations would justify. 3* I should also be glad to know whether H.M.G. contemplate the arrangement proposed being covered by a formal undertaking either in the form of an agreement or an exchange of letters. If this is contemplated, you will doubtless be forwarding a draft to us in due From C A R Southwell Tel: Paddington 14-53 9 14-50 -2-From C.A.R Southwell Tel: Paddington 14-5 3/9 14-50 course for our consideration* It is possible that the Ministry of'.^-vil Aviation have precedents for commercial concerns acting as w.ieir Agents for the management of civil aerodromes and, if so, it would be very helpful if we could be given details of the agreement reached in such cases. 4* Our examination of this question has, of course, been based on the eissumption that the Civil Air Agreement between the Ruler and H.M.G. will be renewed more or less in its present fonn* Are you yet in the position to confinn the correctness of this assumption? If the Civil Air Agreement is to be renewed, presumably some amendment w ill necessary to allow for the establishment of an aerodrome by us for the purpose of our operations* It is possible also that some amendment of the existing Air Navigation Rules for Kuwait may be necessary. Incidentally, X should be grateful if you could let me have a copy of these Rules as we do not appear to possess one in our London Office and would like to avoid the delay in obtaining the Rules from Kuwait. 5. As this matter is one which may take time to settle, I trust that you will be able to treat it separately from the question of approval to the construction of the landing strip. This latter question is one on which we are particularly anxious to secure an early decision. 'J t*^C' P.A.K.Harrison, Esq., Commonwealth Relations Office, Downing Street, S.W.l.il L.&amp; Tel.

INDEXED With reference to the correspondence resting with your telegram No* 74 of the 6th March to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, about the stop at Koweit on the U*K*/Bahrein flying boat service, we have now heard from B*0*A*C. that they propose to introduce calls at Koweit commencing with the service leaving U.K. on Thursday 18th March for Bahrein, calling at Koweit on 20th March* Calls will be made twice weekly in each direction at Koweit by the services leaving the U*K. on Thursdays and Fridays and departing Bahrein on Sundays and Mondays. The Corporation recognise that the spacing of this schedule is by no means ideal from the postal angle, but for technical reasons on which I need not enlarge, this is the best they can do for the present* They hope, however, with the introduction of their summer schedules to operate the service from the IKK. on Tuesday and Thursday or possibly on Tuesday and Friday* This letter will confirm my telephone notification of the 9th instant.

I now enclose for your information a plan of the new airstrip which we propose to construct for our purposes at Kuwait and also a map showing the site which we consider to be the most suitable for its establishment. You will see from the plan that our proposals (which are based on expert advdce) envisage the construction of the following (a) A single runway 6,400 ft. long and 150 ft. wide (b) Taxiways (c) Aprons; and (d) Hangars and ancillary buildings. The runway, which will be paved, is orientated within close limits into the prevailing wind and will be constructed to give the following strength requirements - wheel load 54-&gt;000 lb., wheel spacing 30 ft., tyre pressure 80 lb. per square inch. These strength requirements are 2CJi$ less than the X.C.A.O. requirements for a Class C aerodrome and are considered adequate for the type of aircraft which this Company will require to operate at Kuwait. Provision is made for the levelling and consolidation of landing strips on either side, and at the ends of the runway, to allow the maximum safety for any aircraft accidentally leaving the runway during take-off or landing. As shown in the plan, the 1 of these landing strips is 7,o00 ft,From C.A.P Southwell Tel: Paddington 14-5 3/9 1450 1 Great Cumberland Place, London, W 1. 2 - The drainage of storm water from the runway and landing strips ^.s also provided for. 3. Taxiways are arranged to allow the main runway to he entered or left at three points. These points have been chosen to correspond approximately with the average length of landing run in each direction. The size of the main apron is sufficient to allow up to four large aircraft simultaneously on the loading bays. In addition, small aprons are provided in conjunction with hangars. Buildings include one to house the usual aerodrome services and administrative offices, an annexe for the hangar, aerodrome maintenance buildings, a garage for vehicles and a store for inflammable materials. k* Careful consideration has been given to the question of siting the airstrip and the position indicated on the map was selected after close examination of a wide area. The reasons for the selection of this site atre as follows (a) It is reasonably level and conparatively little grading is required. A main runway of adequate length can be set out in the prevailing wind and, if it is considered desirable at a later stage, a subsidiary strip roughly at right angles to the main runway is practicable. (b) Inspection indicated that the bearing value of the sub-grade would be adequate. (c) As far as could be ascertained the area is relatively free from sandstorms.4 1 r% From^C.A.P Southwell Tel: Paddington 14-53/9 14-50 3oS lilTtlr? ebru ary 1948. 1 Great Cumberland Place, London, W 1. 11 I understand that Donaldson has non- left the C.R.O, and I am therefore vnriting to Ty' you in reply to his letter No,Ext,308/48 of ib • the 3th February about air facilities at Kuwait.

We are now in a position to do this. 2. Article I of the jknris of Agreement between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait, datec^ilay^ 1934 (the Agreement is still in force) reads as follows:- 'The SVj^ikh agrees to grant to His Majesty's Govemmait exclusive rights to establish and maintainas his Agents,, and subject to the provisions of this Agreement^ and of the Air Navigation Regulations for Civil Aircraft issued by him, an aerodrome or aerodromes and ancillary services within the Shaikh* s territory^and to charge fees in respect of the use of the aerodrome or aerodromes such •and aimilar services'* * ion No^4 of the Shaikh* s^Air Navigation Regulations reads a4 follows:- ”The aircraft shall not use as a place of landing or departure^ any place other than the aerodrome a t Kuwait”* 3. It is true that Articles5 (A) and 9 of the ti'* i Commercial Agreement of ^December 1J51+ between the S^pfikh and your Company might be interpreted as t grant the Kuwait Oil Company the light to construct and operate aerodromes, but in our opinion this Agreement must be read subject to the^Jivil Air connection that Article 6 of the Political Agreement T ,C oflMaich 19^4 between His Majesty's Gtovemment and your Company/ 3A - 2 - Company states that ’’the right given to the Company by its Agreement with the Shaikh to utilise means of transportation by air shall be subject to any general regulations for civil aircraft made by the Shaikh on the advice of His Majesty’s Government', The regulations referred to must^be ini^egpreteA ae the Air Navigation Regulation^ for Civil Aircraft made by the Sheikh, which form part of the Kuwait Air Agreement^ No&gt; 4 of which is quoted in par ugru i tr”2 ab u 'v ^ ‘ ' 'Tfi rights of your Company in regard to the construction of an aerodrome contained in Articles 5(A) and 9 of the Commercial Agreement musyalso be read as subject to Articles 5/(as regards A L the selection of site) -aad Article 8 of the Political Agreement of 5th March 1934. Ct,U 5.'' The general effect of^this seems to be that the Kuwait Oil Company cannot claim any right to establish or maintain an aerodrome under/under^/their Commercial Agreement at least so long as the grant of exclusive rights to His Majesty’s Government^ under Article I of the Civil Air Agreement with the Shaikh remain operative. It will, therefore,be necessary for your Company to obtain the agreement of His MajestySGovemment (and through them, of the Shaikh of Kuwait) before undertaking the construction of a hew aerodrome in Kuwait territory to serve the needs of your Company, ^e should hope, however, that by joint consultation it will be possible to reach an agreement for the construction of a new aerodrome or landing ground to take the place of the present one, which will be acceptable to all parties. 6.

Both versions would therefore appear to be equally authentic and we can refer to the Arabic version to assist us in interpreting the English. In the Arabic version of Article 1 there is a dash after 'maintain' and another after 'issued by him'. This to our minds, makes it quite clear that the Agreement granted to His Majesty's Government exclusive rights to establish and maintain an aerodrome or aerodromes and that the words 'as his agents' simply define the capacity in which His Majesty’s Government shall exercise these exclusive rights. 3.

Kemp's tentative opinion that H.M.G-* s sole rights in the matter relate only to their C .V acting as the Shaikh's agent s in the operation and maintenance of aerodromes is somewhat upsetting, the more so as a similar wording has of course been adopted in the case of the other Gulf Air Agreements.

Shaikh in proposal in its prA * y v u p In May,1934, under the 'Civil Air Agreement' the Sheikh granted to 'exclusive rights to establish and maintain as his agents and subject etc an aerodrome or aerodromes and ancillary services....', and any right or facility which he may subsequently have granted to the Kuwait Oil Co. or to anyone else must be read as being subject to the grant of the above exclusive rights. If, therefore, the above wording can properly be construed as a grant of the exclusive right to establish aerodromes, there would seem to be no room for argument, and the K.O.C. could not claim to do anything in contravention of the rights of H.M, G. I am inclined to think, hov/ever, that the words 'as his agents' must be read as .qualifying the whole expression 'to establish and maintain', and that what in fact was granted, whether that was the intention or not, was the sole right to act as the Sheikh’s agents in the establishment and maintenance of aerodromes, - leaving it open to him to allow other persons to establish aerodromes on their own account. The question is, has he in fact done so ? The relevant passages in the concession seem to me to be contained in articles 5(A) and 9, whereunder the Sheikh allowed the K.O.C. certain facilities 'for the purposes of its operations hereunder', i.e., the operations snecified in article 1. These were the rights X inter alia l; (a) to construct and to operate various specified works 'and anv other facilities or works (i.e. of a^similar nature^' which the Co. may consider necessary: (b) to utilise all such means of transportation by land . air or water communication or operation as may be necessary in the effective conduct of its operations: (c) to select in consultation with the Sheikh areas of land.. with exclusive surface rights upon which to erect., terminal and ship-ping facilities and any other works required for the Co’s. operations. The above rights seem to me prima facie to be wide enough to justify the construction of an aerodrome - subject, no doubt, in regard to the selection of a site, to the provisions of articles 5 and 8 of the Political agreement of 5. 3. 34, but subject also, it must be noted, to article 6 of that agreement, v/hich runs as follows:- 'The right given to the Coy. by its agreement with the Sheikh to utilise means of transportation by air shall be subject to any general regulations for civil aircraft made by the Sheikh on the advice of H.M.G.' If, as I assume, the regulations referred to are those printed as Part I to the 'Civil Air Agreement' of 23. 5. 34, there would seem to be some difficulty - which cannot be got over by mere reliance on the words 'without hindrance'. Under these regulations, aircraft are not to use as a place of landing or departure any place other than 'the aerodrome at Kuweit', and must, further, observe the published conditioi governing its use - a provision repeated in the form of special authorisation issued by the Sheikh to fly over his territory. Z., UqCJM / I gather from OeOan^L H^y*s letter/of the l#th November that, save in the cases of the airway companies there mentioned,the above regulations are to some extent a dead letter,owing to the difficulty of enforcement. But the establishment of a ne,. aerodrome at which to land would be a different natter. /V/ ’ ■ v - irHrsT 153V.Ext* 27 1x3/kl.

It was thought that tho former sito would probably bo bettor owing to there being less likelihood of sandstorms* Tho length of the strip would be 6,000 foot in order to permit the landing of four-engined aircraft* Natural foundations would apparently be strong enough to boar tho' weight of aircraft of this size. Mr. Southwell added, that he would like to soo Idwcit put on the civil air map as a port of call on a main route from this country. Iho operations of the Oil Company had expanded rapidly and would soon reach a considerable magnitude and ho thought that tho amount of traffic offering would be substantial.

The existing Civil Air. agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit was due for renewal in May, 1948 and the question now arose whether H.M.G. should enter into negotiations for its extension. 2. Mr. Southwell stated that the Koweit Oil Company relied extensively on air transport for the movement of both personnel and equipment to Koweit. At present their traffic was carried partly by aircraft operating under charter to the Company, partly ty their own aircraft, and partly^ between Basra and Koweit) by Iraqi Airways. The Sheikh had intimated that the air strip imaediately to the South of the town which the Company were using and maintaining (which had tR* *■—» originally been prepared by H.M.G.) would have to be abandoned o./ing to its oJ-^u^S eJnu^ 4f ^ /]- position outside one of the main gates of the town, and of the oonaoquont interference t-o ground-trai'fio thereby canoed. The Company were accordingly proposing to construct an air strip for their own purposes either/to the west of the town between uimwaikn and Ahmedi or near the new harbour at Fahaihil about .20 miles to the south. It was thought that the former site would probably 4-&lt;s be O'ving to the loooor likelihood of sandstorms. The length of the strip would be 6,000 feet in order to permit the landing of four-engined aircraft. Natural foundations would apparently be strong enough to bear the weight of aircraft of this size. Mr. Southwell added that he would like to see Koweit Cay , X put on the air map as a port of call on a main air route from this countly. The operation}of the Oil Compary had expanded rapidly and would soon reach a /considerable0r~ considerable magnitude and he thought that the amount of traffic ^/ J /■ offering would H£mentioned that tnere would shortly be as many as 1,100 American and British employees of the Company at Koweit. 3 . Mr. Ratcliffe-Cousins stated that the Ministry of Civil Aviation did not consider that^ in view of the facilities already available at Margil, Dhahraa and Bahrein, there was at present justification for H.M.G. financing the construction of a large international airport at Koweit. Koweit was linked with the B.O.a.C. traffic lines by the Iraqi Airways Koweit/Basra service. Reference was made to the possibility of developing a flying-boat base at Koweit and to tne possibility of / B.O.A.C. arranging a call there by the U.K./Bahrein b£-weekly flying-boat service. This was understood to be at present under investigation by B.O.A.C. but it was pointed out that radic^navigational aids would be required for any regular service. 4 . Mr. Ratcliffe Cousins added that the B.O.A.C. over-all planning for trunk services for the next few years did not include Koweit. The Ministry of Civil Aviation would naturally welcome the provision of an emergency landing strip in Koweit territory, but would not be prepared to pay for its provi-84-en and upkeep. _ 5. Mr. Low explained that the seumineiftaHfc*- of the Air Ministry iM* solely / xeoAAA. * avt&gt; ^ ui+^r**?*** — in iiho nat -itt an option^ i.e. that whatever airfields were constructed in Koweit, the R.A.F. should have the right to use and develop them i«r-an -Cii emergency. Ov ^ The question of renewal of the Civil Air Agreemen t was next considered. It was thought that the Sheikh might raise his price but would be principally interested in securing an assurance that, if renewed, proper aerodrome facilities would be provided. Unless we could promise this.the Sheikh might /&amp;U not be willing to renew the Agreement. H.M.G-. would then lose^exclusive rights as regards management of aerodromes in Koweit territory, and^unless separate arrangements could be made, the R.A.F. would lose their military rights attached to the Agreement by exchange of letters. If we did not renew the Agreement we could scarsely object to the Sheika according similar /rights0 ® c 4^ ^^9. dkj&lt;i rights for management of aerodromes to any other oountry.

The present .^position is that under the existing civil air agreement with the oheikh of Koweit (which is due for a renewal In May 1948) H.M.G. have the exclusive right. In return for an annual payment of£500 to the Sheikh, to establish and maintain aerodromes and ancillary services at Koweit. In addition to this, H.M.G. have the sole discretion under this agreement to appoint Agents, whose duties would be, inter alia:- 1. To manage and maintain the aerodrome, or aerodromes. 2 . To exercise the supervision necessary to the carrying out of the Koweit Air Navigation Rules (with the exception of air sanitary formalities and passport and customs regulations). 3. To collect landing fees. 4. To supply fuel and lubricants. 5. To operate any wireless station which may be established and communicate with aircraft and collect any charges made for such service. 6 . To supply meteorological reports if possible and to collect charges for them. So far no agents have been appointed and no proper arrangements exist for the collection of landing fees and for the control and management of the airfield generally.46r. ^ ( r AY tv» *-&gt; * In our letter of the l 6 th October to the Koweit Oil Company, .ve suggested to than that, as they were the principle users of the aerodrome, a convenient arrangement might be for the Koweit Oil Company to act as agents on behalf of Mr. Southwell has replied ncm-commitally to t ds letter and has mentioned that the Sheikh nc^* _ considers the existing aerodrome dangerous in view oi its proximity to Kowiit Town and of the fact that a main desert track runs across it. We therefore have to consider not only the question of agents, but also the establishment of a fresh airfield. A meeting is therefore being held here at 11 a.m. tomorrow to discuss this*, questions', at which representatives of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Koweit Oil Company will be present. Before arriving at any conclusion it seems likely that the Koweit Oil Company will want to consider the following points:- 1 . The selection of a site for the new airfield. 2. Whether plans for a new airfield will have to. be submitted and approved by H.M.G. before construction can begin. 3. If H.M.G. insist on the provision of facilities which occeedf those required for purely company purposes, whether they will contribute towards the cost. A. The relationship between H.M.G-. and their agents. In regard to 1 and 2 above, we should perhaps bear in mind the fact that as the future position of the R.A.F. in Iraq is not yet known, it might be advisable to select a site which could be developed for services purposes— - 2 - if this should prove necessary. It might be best to avoid making any mention of this to the Company, but to insist on the selection of the site being done in conjunction be a matter between the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the Kuwait Oil Company. As regards 4, we might mention the proposed appointment of a civil 4 tir Attache to the staff of the Political Resident and decide on the most satisfactory way of bringing him into the picture. Mention might also be made at the meeting* of the possibility of the B.O.A.C. flying boats calling at Kuwait and of the desirability of utilising whatever wireless facilities they may establish^ for contact with land planes using the Koweit aerodrome. with the Ministry of Civil Aviation 3 appears toT X 1 JIV-' M UOta \lv-i copy fc;: :: .c::t.':ati 5 n Inward Telegram to Commonwealth Relations Office Dove aircraft No* G-.

As I expect you know, the Kbv/eit OiJ. Company already employs a lar^e number of 3ritish and .American operatives and it is certain* that this number will be substantially increased in the near future - possibly to as many as jCO, So fap ^s the carriage of air mail is concerned, it vaould of course be preferable for this to be handled by a British Company .employing British air crews, and before considering whether we should accept the Political Resident’s proposal that an airmail contract might be placed with Iraqi Airways, we should like to know whether it would not be possible to make Kbweit a calling place for aircraft of the B.C*A*C. service U«K./Bahrein* Oil development at Kbv/eit is likely to be on a greater scale than at Bahrein and in consequence the linking of Kbweit with a regular air service is, from our point of view, most desirable# Not only would this . peimit an airmail service to be introduced on the most satisfactoiy footing, but it ’rould also give the Oil Company the greatly improved facilities for the movement .of their personnel which they so much desire.

Bahrain 27th September, 1947. * Postal mails between Kuwait and Basrah are at present transported by car twice weekly in each direction by the Kuwait Zubair transport Company (a Kuwaiti concern) under a contract with the Indian Postal Administration. The charges for the service are Rs.400 per month and the contract is terminable at four months notice on either side. 2. Iraqi Airways, who operate thrice weekly between Kuwait and Basrah, have offered to convey mails between Basrah and Kuwait at a rate of 84- gold centimes per kilo. For existing mail load (both air and surface) this would cost the postal administration approximately Rs.ll60 per month as against the payment of Rs*400 to the Kuwait - Zubair Transport Company for transport of mails by car. It is estimated - that the carriage by air of air mails only would cost Rs.200 per month of mails from Kuwait to Basra and Rs.260 per month from Basra to Kuwait. 3« The rapid growth of Kuwait due to oil development has created a demand for an improved postal service. The carriage of air mail between Kuwait and Basra by air would be more frequent and much speedier than the existing service by car and the feasibility may be considered prior to the arrival of the G-.P.O. expert of terminating the existing mail contract and entering into one with Iraqi Aizways as soon as the postal administration of Kuwait is taken over by His Majesty*s Government. Surface mail would then have to be carried by sea but this would not involve much delay as Kuwait is now served by four mail steamers a month in each direction.

The establishment of a large scale military air base at Kuwait would .presumably in any case have to be the subject of separate negotiations with the Shaikh since the Annexuro to the present Air Agreement merely gives the R.A.P. full rights to use civil aerodromes within the territory without additional paynent. Should the establishment of such a base become necessary it would clearly be difficult, if not impossible, to secure the existing airfield for this purpose . if the Civil Air Agreement were to have lapsed and the Shaikh were to have granted rights for its operation to the Iraqis or Americans. I do not know however whether you would regard the present airfield (which is close to the town of Koweit) as necessarily the best site for an R.A.P. base. 3. We cannot, of course, be certain that the Shaikh will agree to a renewal of the existing agreement especially in view of the Political Residents report of the 23rd July, a copy of which was sent to you under our Ext. 1625/47.

Division ' F.G-.2. • 18 ' Planning Secretariat ” The Chairiran stated that the purpose of the meeting was to consider 'the grounds for a renewal of the Kuwait Civil Air Agreement, due to lapse in Ivixy 1948, with a view to formulating a policy which could be discussed with Sir Rupert Hay,Political Resident in the Persian Gulf who was at present in .. London. A question for consideration was whether the position at Kuwait offered any parallels to that .which had -..risen earlier with regard- to Masirah and Salalah, where civil air agreements had been negotiated with a view to providin ; a civil facade for possible Royal Air Force requirements. 2. The meeting discussed the present airfield at Kuwait. Little was known about its present characteristics, although it was thought that it consisted merely of a desert strip without v/ater or accommodation. It was agreed , after further discussion. Conclusion!i) that Air Ministry would send to Planning Division, M.C.— any information j (Action: .xir which they possessed on the subject. Ministry.D.D. Pol(a.S.)3.) | Conclusion(ii) that the Kuwait Oil Company should be asked for any information which &gt; I (action C.R.0.) they might have on the present airfield. ILl, Ly ^ The Chairman stated that purely civil aviation interests at Kuwe.it were w i aT yer y small. It v/as unlikely that the airfield would eve* be required for trunk * route purposes and it had scarcely if over been used as eui emergency landing ' ^ ground; B.O.^.C. were not interested in its retention. It had however some slight value as a possible insurance in the event of expectations at other aerodromes in the area not being realised. T his vu^ ue was to some extent dependent on theTpresent characteristics of the airfield and possibilities of development. 4. Mr. Low (Air Ministry S.6.) stated that the ..ir itnistry interest at Kuwait was also' slight. The position of the R.^.F. in tha'area was uncertain pending the final outcome of discussions for the renewal of the treaty with Iraq. Kuwait had, for the ^ir Ministry, a certain value as an insurance in i the X event cf other arrangements failing although the cost of development of the airfield to the standard of a R.A.F. base would amount to several million pounds. 6~ 'ZJ % civ. 13054 /ItIt was noted that if the present agreement wore allowed to lapse and control of the airfield passed to some other agency, it might be difficult if not impossible for the RuF to negotiate a Defence agreement for use of the present site. • , I:Ir. Hallows (C.R.Q. ) stated that the retention of civil aviation rights ' at Kuwait had a political and prestige value. The cessation of such^righta might leave a dangerous vacuum. already enquiries had been i;ade by IT d\n airways and Indian airways in the x^ossibility of ox)erating services to Kuwait. After some discussion 6. It was agreed Conclusion (iii) that while civil aviation interests alone were not such as to warrant a renewal of the agreement, there appeared to be a sufficient case for its renewal for reasons of prestige, political desirability, civil aviation . and Royal ^ir Force insurance, combined, provided (a) that the Kuwait Oil Company would continue to act as airport managers, and (b) that there -was no additional commitment to beyond a sum of the order of the £500 annual rental, now being paid. The incidence of cost as between the Departments concerned would require separate consideration. 7. The meeting discussed the present arrangement whereby the Kuwait Oil Company managed the airfield under a completely informal arrangement. It was felt that this was unsatisfactory both from the point of view of the U.K. and the Sheikh, Llr. Hallows stated that the Oil Company was an ^nglc-Amorican concern and that they maintained two aircraft at Kuwait at the present. It was agreed Conclusion(iv) tv that before any approach Was made to the Sheikh for a renewal of the treaty the Kuwait Oil Company should be approached with a view to ensuring that t hey would ba willing to continue the present arrangement on a formal basis.

The meeting discussed the obligations of H#M#G-. us signatory to the Chicago Convention on behalf of the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms, including Kuwait. It was felt that H.M.G. did not incur any responsibility for providing additional facilities and that the position as regards responsibility would be the same as for Masirah and Salalah. 10.

There is no strategic requirement for an air base in Koweit so long as we retain the use of Shaibah. If, however, as a result of the Iraq Treaty revision we are con^elled to relinquish Shaibah, then we may wish to build an alternative base in Koweit. Our only requirement in Koweit is, therefore, to ensure that we shall be able, if we wish, to construct a military air base there in the event of our losing Shaibah. However, in view of the inevitable delays which we must expect in reaching agreement with the Iraqis on a revised treaty, we consider that it would be unwise to await the outcome of the negotiations before deciding on the question of renewing the Civil Air Agreement with Koweit. Before expressing the view as to the necessity or otherwise from a strategical point of view of continuing the present agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit after it has lapsed next May, we should be grateful for your views as to whether the continuation of the present agreement is necessary to enable us to retain the option to construct a military air base in Koweit. Dunnett has pointed out that if we do not continue the Agreement, Iraqi Airways may secure the right to operate the airfield, and we should like to know whether this would prevent us subsequently negotiating an agreement for a military base. I imagine that if we did want a military air base we might in any case have to negotiate a new agreement and be unable to rely on the present Civil Air Agreement. I am sending a copy of this letter to Dunnett. Yours sincerelv- (M.W. low) F.A.K.

The statement in our telegram that H.M.G. ^were considering the possibility of letting the Koweit Air Agreement aotlapse after May, 1948' was in fact based on a remark of yours made at the meeting we had here and the f question has^so far as I am aware^not yet been considered outside the Ministry of Civil Aviation. The Air Ministry are of course also concerned because, as you know, there is an _* s L /Annexure ^ ft j\r ^Annexure to the Kowext Air Agreement which gives aircraft full rights to use civil aerodrcmies without any additional payment* A As the Political Resident points out^this^may x be important if the deterioration of relations with Iraq tha^ it difficult for^fiT to continue to use Habbaniyah and Shaibah.

I enclose herewith a copy of a letter I have received from him on the subject. Though one or two of his statements require some qualification I fully agree with his main contentions. 2. One point he has not made which is perhaps the most important of all. is that should a deterioration of our relations with Iraq compel the Royal Air Force to evacuate Habbaniyah and Shaibah they will almost certainly want to establish them selves at Kuwait. This matter was, I know, under consideration last year though I have no correspon dence on the subject. 3. While I appreciate the fact that in present circumstances His Majesty^ Government wish to avoid any commitment that may involve them in expenditure, I do consider there are very strong arguments in favour of our retaining our control of air-fields in Kuwait and I hope it may be possible to reach some arrangement whereby we can do this with a minimum of expense at any rate for the time being. 4. The matter is one that perhaps might be discussed while I am in London. E. P. ✓ Donaldson, Esquire, C.M.G., India Office, LONDON./~s CONFIDENTIAL No. C/419. POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT. Dated the 5th June, 1947. From To The Political Agent, Kuwait. /~ Tin} \. rl 4 ki ;i9^ r . The Secretary to the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BAHRAIN. Subject : Kuwait Air Agreement , Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegram No. 625, dated the 28th May, 1947, paragraph 3. ~ 2. ^ It seems certain that aircraft of many nationa lities will wish to land in Kuwait in the future : the Iraqi Airways service appears to be enjoying considerable success; and an Indian service dXiYrf, is contemplated. There seems a possibility that Kuwait might become the starting point for pilgrimages by air to Mecca. Sooner or later the countries concerned may designate Kuwait as an airfield required for international traffic. Should they do so the obligation to bring the airfield up to International standards would appear to rest upon Great Britain by virtue of her signature of the Chicago Convention on behalf of territories under protection. It does not seem that this obligation could be evaded by allowing our Air Agreement with the Shaikh to lapse. 2* Should we not renew the Air Agreement and should we manage to divest ourselves of all obligations under International Air Conventions regarding Kuwait, a dangerous vacuum might be left. The Shaikh desires that an airfield should be established, and might well receive favourably a proposal from a foreign state or air-line desiring an airfield under their own control. There is presumably no necessity to dilate on the dangers in herent in such a possibility - the fact that His Majesty^ Government have concluded in the past exclusive air Agreements with the Shaikh indicates that they are aware of them. 4. The problem of bringing the airfield up to the standard required should not be insuperable if the co operation of the Kuwait Oil Company is enlisted; and, after maintaining for many years an exclusive right to establish an airfield when no one else wished to do so, it would seem inadvisable to abandon this right at the present time.

Dear Harrison, Ciis is to acknowledge your letter No. EXT.977/47 of the 6th May regarding a suggested increase in the scale of landing charges at Kawait. We are not quite clear what is happening in Kawait. The airfield was abandoned by the R.A.p. over a year ago,, . and although the agreement with the Sheikh is cover no civil advisor was left in charge to administer the airfield or to collect the prescribed landing fees. It now appears from other papers that the Kuwait Petroleum Company has been operating the airfield, andlms arranged, subject to official sanction, for Iraqi Airways to operate a service between Basra and Kuwait. The existing agreement with the Sheikh expires next year, and as we have ourselves no use for the airfield, we were not proposing to renew it.

Reference correspondence ending with Prior’s telegram No. 592, April 18th, 1946. 2. Royal Air Force, Iraq Command, have intimated that they cannot continue to maintain Kuwait aerodrome. Kuwait Oil Company are prepared, if Royal Air Force hand over aerodrome in good condition, to maintain it for so long as it is used by Anglo Iranian Oil Company aeroplanes and casual visiting aircraft. I am informing Royal Air Force accordingly. The Company stipulate, however, that in the event of a commercial air line making Kuwait a regular stop, necessitating much additional work and facilities, it will be necessary to review the position and to arrange for an adequate organisation run on commercial lines; they declare that in this event they would be only too willing to render any reasonable assistance in their power.

'ear Harrison Thank you for your letter No. EXT. 943A5 of the 7th March, with enclosures, about tne renewal of the' 10 A Koweit Civil Air Agreement In our view Koweit and Bahrein are not exactly parallel cases, ±or while B.O.A.C. use the latter for regular services now and will continue to do so in the post-war period, they seldom use the former and will only need to call there in an emergency, in the future. Furthermore, as you have pointed out, the Koweit Oil Company do not enjoy exclusive rights at Koweit as do the Bahrein Petroleum Company at Bahrein. Nor are the Corporation indebted to them for any services. None the less, on the assumption that the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has in mind the difficulties at Bahrein which we have been considering recently in connection with the erection there of the oil storage tanks, we agree that the definition of M aerodrome ,, given in the Indian Aircraft Rules, should be applied in the case of Kcweit and embodied in the Agree ment or the Air Navigation Regulations, if this can be done without difl iculty. We do not, however, feel sufficiently strongly about the matter to press the point unduly, and are content to leave it to the discretion of Sir Geoff^ry Prior.

Li 1 By Air Lail » P.Z.7941/34. 9th January 1935. ]V]y dear Fowle, I venture to bother you on one or two points which have arisen on the 'special authorisations' recently issued in favour of Imperial Airways, etc. hy the sheikh of Bahrein, copies of whicn you sent us under cover of your printed despatch No.1170-s of 10th December. 2. In the first place the word 'British' appears to have been omitted before the word 'nationality' in paragraph 1 in all three cases. This is no aoubt merely a clerical error. 3. secondly, paragraph 2 does not lay down a time limit for the validity of 'special autnorisations'. It was originally intended that there should be such a time limit (as is, I think, clear from the form of the draft 'special authorisation' prepared here after consultation with you), but I am afraid that owing to an oversight we failed to suggest what the actual period of validity should/ The Hon'ble Lt.Col. T.C. Fowle, C*B;E., The Residency, Bushire.- a - • should he. After informal consultation with the Air Ministry we now suggest that the period in question should he one year. This will of course mean that companies operating air services will have to apply annually througn the usual channels for a renewal of their '‘special autnorisations”. Paragrapn 2 should therefore read 'This authorisation is limited to the period from /Insert ciate of issue of authorisation/ to /T __7 inclusive and is granted...' 4. l/iihile the points referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 above are of relatively minor importance, we think, in the light of discussion with the Air Ministry, that it would he desirable to obtain amended 'authorisations' from the sheikh of Bahrein and to ensure that any 'authorisations' issued by the sheikh of Ko-weit and the sultan of Muscat are in similar form. If you see no objection we should be grateful if the necessary steps might be taken. Meanwhile, the Air Ministry will postpone ariy communication to Imperial Airways. 5. The Air Ministry have also raised a point in regard to paragraph 2(iii) of the 'authorisation', which./-i. ■■■ n i 0 © which lays down tnat the 'authorisation' or a. certified true copy of it shall he carried hy the aircraft. I am not sure that it has ever been made clear that it was desired that the original 'authorisations' issued under this paragraph in Bahrein (ana similarly in the case of Muscat and Koweit), should he sent to the India Office for transmission via tne Air Ministry to imperial Airways and in the present instance copies only have been received. The Air Ministry feel difficulty in certifying 'true copies' in the absence of the originals and we should therefore be grateful, if no objection is seen, if we might have originals of the authorisations now under discussion (with the amendments referred to in paragraph 3 above); and if in future originals might be sent home of any 'authorisations' issued in respect of the Gulf states. 6 .

If you will refer to the 'Conditions laid down to govern the use of the aerodromes' set out in Part II of the Bahrein Agreement and Part III of the Koweit Agreement you will see that paragraph 2 reads as follows '2. The fees payable in respect of landings end accommodation are as specified in the First Schedule hereto. Landing fees will he assessed according to the maximum permissible weight authorised by the certificate of airworthiness of the aircraft.' As regards paragraph 2, I note, however, that the fees for landing and for accommodation have been separated under Schedule I and Schedule II respectively.

My dear Laithwaite, 1. ^ill you please refer to Colonel Fowle's despatch No.539-S of 7th June,1934, under cover of which he forwarded correspondence relating to the Koweit Civil Air Agreement. 2. In paragraph 6 of that despatch the Resident suggests that our oner for an option on the quarantine site at Koweit should be raised from £100 to £120 p.a. As the Treasury authority allov/ing us to make the offer enables the Air Ministry to pay a sum of about £100 a year for the resei vation ox the site we will certainly not allow the negotiations to fall through over a small addition of £20 per annum if the Resident and Political Agent consider it necessary to offer the higher figure. That being so, you can inform the Resident that we will be prepared to pay £120 P er annum lor reservation of the quarantine site on the terms previously agreed between us in correspondence ending with my letter S.31084 of 24th April,1934. 3. As far as paragraphs 4-6 of Colonel Dickson's letter and paragraphs 2—4 ox Colonel Fowle’s letter are concerned the latter explains very clearly the difference between the position at Bahrain and Koweit. 4. Koweit is obviously much more likely to require R.A.F.assistance than Bahrain and has, in fact, been given such assistance on more than one occasion, and, therefore it was quite as much in the interest of the Sheikh of Koweit himsell as ox the R.A.F. that our landing ground was established in his territory. 5. Moreover, there is a further consideration which has not been mentioned by the Resident and that is, that the civil base at Bahrain is much more important than the civil landing ground at Koweit. Koweit will provide less traffic than Bahrain and owing to its proximity to Basrah will probably be used much less than the latter place. That being so a smaller sum will be collected at Koweit in respect landing fees than at Bahrain, but nevertheless the Sheikh Oj. ohe former place is being paid the same amount in respect of the civil air agreement as the Sheikhs of Bahrain and' Gwadur. T .7e certainly do not consider the Sheikh has any grievance and agree, as suggested by Colonel FtyDde, that full use might be made by the Political Agent of these arguments when an opportunity presents itself. 6. II, as suggested by Colonel Fowle, in paragraph 5 oi his despatch, the Sheikh proposes charging duty on R.A.F. xael, we agree tnat tne casewill have to be dealt with on its merits, but we regard it as important that the Air Ministry J.G.Laithwaite,Esq., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. should/should have a further opportunity of considering the matter when the Sheikh has shown his hand. As far as fuel required for aircraft passing through Koweit on passage up and down the Gulf is concerned, this duty would probably be quite negligible, but it might be pointed out to the Sheikh that he would, in any case, hardly be justified in charging duty on fuel in respect of flights of an operational character which might be undertaken in his own interests, 7. There is another aspect, however, in connection with this question of duty which I would like to bring to your notice. In the event of our eventually establishing a R.A.F.base at Koweit the sum involved in payment of duty on fuel might be quite considerable and it is possible the Sheikh might also wish to charge auty on other classes of R.A.F. stores, the bill for which would, no doubt, be considerable. That being so, it is obviously desirable to avoid establishing any precedent in the matter of payment of duty on B.A.F.fuel at this stage if at all possible. 8* I am sending copiesof this letter to Rendel at the Foreign Office, Seal at the Admiralty and Starling at the Petroleum Department. fours sincerely, ¥.A.McClaughry.P.Z. 4125/34.

' j 'r .J . ^ l • ^ Z' No.539 - S of 1934. ^ ~\ Of* British Residency &lt;Sc Consulate-General, ?{\1^) Bushire, the 7th June, 1934. C J From To Sir, The Hon’ble Lieut.-Colonel T.C.Fowle,C.B.E Political Resident in the Persian Gulf His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India • t I have the honour to enclose copy of letter No. C-199, dated the 29th May 1934, from the Political Agent, Kuwait, with enclosures, from which it will be seen that the Shaikh has signed the Civil Air Agreement. This reflects credit on Colonel Dickson’s persuasive powers as the Shaikh at first evinced a certain amount of suspicion towards the Agree ment, chiefly I think on account of its unavoidably voluminous nat ur e. 2. v/ith regard to paragraphs 4-6 of Colonel Dickson’s letter. The reason why Bahrain in the first place (paragraph 6 of Colonel Dickson’s letter) came to be given £ 120/- per annum, and Kuwait nothing, is I imagine quite simple. The Shaikh of Bahrain asked for £ 120/- per annum and the Shaikh of Kuwait asked for nothing. The reason, too, why the Shaikh of Kuwait gave the use of his landing ground rent-free, and the Shaikh of Bahrain asked for rent, is I think not far to seek. Kuwait being part of the mainland in case of emergency is largely dependent on the Royal Air Force for protection, and Bahrain being an island is not: as long as His Majesty’s Sloops are in the Persian Gulf no force can invade Bahrain from the mainland./mainland. In other words the coming of the Royal Air Force to Kuwait was more in the interests of the latter than of the former, while in Bahrain it was the Royal Air Force who chiefly benefited since Bahrain is an essential link in the strategical route to India, and no corresponding advantage of defence accrued to the State. 3# Moreover Bahrain and Kuwait in the matter of landing grounds are not on all fours. At the former there are two landing groundsj (a) On Manamah Island, for use of which the Royal Air Force pay the £ 120/-rent referred to by the Shaikh of Kuwait, and which is now practically a military aerodrome. Further the £ 120/- not only covers the use of the aerodrome but also the site for the Royal Air Force base, quarters for personnel, Rest House, etc. which is situated on Manamah. (b) On Muharraq Island which is the civil aerodrome, the use of which by the Royal Air Force is given free under the terms of the Civil Air Agreement. At Kuwait there is only one aerodrome, corresponding to that on Muharraq, and no base. 4. I am not of opinion therefore that the Shaikh has any claim to the £ 120/- in connection with the Civil Air Agreement, and I suggest that I be authorised to send him the attached letter. I have not mentioned in my draft the arguments contained in paragraph 2 above but the Political Agent, Kuwait, when presenting the letter might at his discretion elaborate these _en titre personel . The Shaikh is not backward in stressing His Majesty’s Government’s obliga tions to him and it does no harm, I think, from time to time-3- m&gt;t to point out to him the corresponding benefits which he receives• it is quite possible that while relinquishing the request for the £ 120/- rental he may state that he wishes to charge duty on Royal Air Force fuel ss is done by the Bahrain State. If he does so this point can be taken up on its merits. 6 # in connection, however, with a possible future Royal Air Force base at Kuwait,(vide correspondence ending with Secretary of State for India’s telegram No*1193, dated the 6th May 1934), for the option on the site of which £ 100/- yearly rental to the Shaikh has been suggested, I think that this might be raised to £ 120/- which, as x ar as bases are concerned, would then place Kuwait on a level with Bahrain, and satisfy the Shaikh. enclosures (except sub-enclosure (a) of which only one spare copy is available) to the Government of India. From the last paragraph of the Shaikh’s letter I am sending a copy of this letter and of its I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.mm -z- sr£ xioirlw ^n^noqye 100 aiij- nuif oi Jjjo ^uxoq od . ,'i , V * .-3 OB T *ieid9l e^^xsrfE oxld* *io rtqsTg&amp;’iBq d’asl 9iid iiiot^ ,d deauysi add - '^nirfsiupnila*! sliiiw $ incf elcfiBacq ad’iyp ai Ji « ‘i -'c Qi us-isiv: J:i oJ -^^b im d/ -\0:U r arid' *ioi 'ixxsiii.stl ohj ^3 aaoX) sx bb IslI oo'io'i 'll t, L&amp;xo H no ,d&gt;- £) n ■■ viiioq ai.ij od h9od axf I .ajisdS . 2 J y-uJui 9Idxeeoq 3 r ; jiv. ^ic.'awoxl t noxdo ^nctoo nl .3 gaii)ii9 soaaijnoqsaTTOo siDiv) t di^v/u&gt;I d,B 9 8 3d 99 * 10 'I iiA iDsdBi) t £CII*o/i r.ix5TJ.9l3d 8 f *iSnI *xol 9^9J 3 1 * rioin'w xo 9 dxG arid no noxdqo aiid 'iol vsJi iidu oiid I &lt;.bad 39 v 3 iJa ii99d 8J3ri rfid arfc arid od I :&gt;dn9i ^Ixss z -\0 jI X'x 8 is ,fi9iii\v -\ 02 I 2 . od bssi-i'i oa dxi^iiii 2. . .3 dsnd &gt;ifixrd IsvoI o no dxsivuX ao^Iq norid Mnov. ^berriaono0 91 b seesd sb • ' ' 5 t sdi r io bnis id d da I a iri d 2 o V'joo 3 -nibnea hub I eno '41 no rlonivv 2o { ) 3*.i •dOl'jna-cfjja dqsoxa^ 29 3.0 scions . ox .nl lo dnaimiiavOx) aiid od (gld jsIi.svb ax \;qoo on^qs ,9d od *xuonorf ond avnri 1 . t:xo t d na i: be do d aon ‘ujo Y . d its v *iy a aidXiliJliPol.

We now confirm that they the military aeroplanes, shall also enjoy priority in the use of any aerodrome, and without any prior permission or being charged anything. We, however, should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Bahrein Government charges on account of the said aeroplanes an annual rental of £120 amrt from the customs duty which it levies on benzine. We prav therefore that Majesty’s Government will very kindly put us on an equably with others in this respect. Usual ending.

I am directed by His Majesty s Government to thank Your Excellency for this. r, , 2 - . In 2 h f same .¥ ter Your , Excellency draws attention to the fact that the Bahrein State are paid an annual rental of £120 in connection with Royal Air Force aeroplanes, and asks to be put on an equality with that State. 3. His Majesty’s Government have directed me to reply as follows: It is possible that Your Excellency has not appreciated the difference between conditions at Bahrein and Koweit At Bahrein there are two aerodromes, one on Manamah Island for which the Royal Air Force pay the £120 referred to, and which is a military aerodrome, established before the civil route was opened, and the other on Muharran winch is used by cml and Royal Air Force aircraft, for which the same Agreement has been signed by His Excellency Sheikh Hamad as has been signed by you 4. Moreover the £120 already referred to also includes the site for the Roval Air Force base, quarters for personnel, Rest House, &amp;c., which is situated on Manamah. 5. At Koweit there is only one civil aerodrome, and no base. His Maiestv’s Government regret, therefore, that they cannot pay Your Excellency the £120 which is paid to Bahrein, and Your Excellency, in the light of the above facts will doubtless gee that conditions in the two States are materially different. * These letters are confidential and are not for publication.

Copy (English and Arabic) of this Agency’s Confidential Letter No.C-193, dated the 23rd May 1934 to H.H. the Shaikh, giving priority to His Majesty’s military aircraft in the use of Kuwait Civil Aerodromes etc. Translation of H.S.the Shaikh of Kuwait’s letter No.IU/1518, dated 26th May 1934 to t© H.M’s Political Agent, sent in reply to (b) above, 2. I am also enclosing for your records and for distribution as may be necessary, extra copies of the abov to)above as under: One spare copy of (a) above, Four spare oopiee of (b) above, Four spare copies of (c) above. 3. For your information, H.K.the Shaikh asked that a complete duplicate oopy of the Civil Air Agreement (a) should remain in his possession. This I gave him after he and I had signed the five parts, in the same way as we had done the 'original* copy. 4. You will notice that the Shaikh in his letter (o) above, while 'confirming that all military aircraft belong ing to, or in the service of His Majesty*s (rovemraent, should enjoy priority in the use of any aerodrome etc*', has put forward a request that he should, if possible, receive equal treatment with Bahrain in the matter of the £.120/- per annum, which the latter State receives fran the Royal Air Force. 5. As the Shaikh, I know, feels deeply that preferential treatment has in seme way or other been won by Shaikh Hamad for the Bahrain Government, at the expense of hlmaalf, who (to use his own words) before Bahrain was ever visited by any R.A.F.aircraft, always did every thing he possibly could to assist Military machines landing at or making use of the aerodrome at Kuwait, I should be grateful if the matter could, in some way, be put before the Air Ministry in l4&gt;ndon for their consideration. 6. I personally am unamre as to how Bahrain in the first place came to be given £.120/- per annum, and Kuwait nothing, but no doubt there were good reasons.

I am directed by His Majesty^ Government to thank Your Excellency for this. 2. In the same letter Your Excellency draws attention to the fact that the Bahrain State are paid an annual rental of £ 120/- in connection with Royal Air Force aeroplanes, and aske to be put on an equality with that State. 3. His Majesty’s Government have directed me to reply as follows. It is possible that Your Excellency has not apprecia ted the difference between conditions at Bahrain and Kuwait. At Bahrain there are two aerodromes, one on Manamah Island for which/which the Royal Air Force pay the £ 120/- referred to, and which is a military aerodrome, established before the civil route was opened, and the other on Muharraq, which is used by ^ivil and Royal Air Force aircraft, for which the same agreement has been signed by His Excellency Shaikh Hamad as has been signed by you, 4. Moreover the £ 120/- already referred to also includes the site for the Royal Air Force base, quarters for personnel, Rest House, etc. which is situated on Manamah. 5. At Kuwait there is only one civil aerodrome, and no base. His Majesty’s t Government regret therefore that they cannot pay Your Excellency the £ 120/- whxch is paid to Bahrain, and Your Excellency in the light of the above facts will doubtless see that conditions in the two States are materially differ ent|NDEXED’ , CONFIDENTIAL.

Dear Sir, As you may well imagine, the recent damage to one of our aircraft at Kuwait has caused us very considerable concern. It has been decided to give the very fullest discretion to the Commanders of our aircraft to avoid calling at Kuwait if they are of the opinion that the weather conditions are such as tb risk damage resulting to their charge. 2. In the meantime we are endeavouring to investigate the Meteorological conditions in the Kuwait Area with a view to seeing whether it is possible to forecast the likeli hood of these storms. With further knowledge I feei that the days on which this danger exists will be more closely defined and a higher percentage of calls made possible. 3. In the interim I am afraid that it will naturally follow that the call at Kuwait will be omitted more often than in the past. ^ fs^l sure that with this information you will be in a position to explain to the Shaikh that there is no lessening in our good will and keenness to co-operate but that circumstances have, temporarily we hope, intervened to make the present decision inevitable. 5. To cause the minimum inconvenience to the people at Kuwait 1 am wondering whether you wjua should not until furth notice route your mail through Basrah. er 6. I should be very interested to hear of any local decisions taken to instal a telephone between Kuwa.it and Basrah, aa increase in telegraphic facilities, or the introduction of any wireless or similar installation.

Her left top wing was badly ripped, before steps could be taken to get the machine head on to the wind. (b) A breakdown Hannibal arrived on the 6th April from Cairo with spares, mechanics, etc., but more material will have to be brought from London. (c) Passengers and mails were taken on to India by the relief (breakdown) aircraft after a delay of S4 hours, during which they were put up by the Political Agent and A.P.O.C. representative. (d) The damaged machine will probably be some 15 days in Kuwait, as the repairs to be done are extensive.

Pjy dear IvicCIaughry, Many thanks for your letter of the 39th January, No. S*31084/Part 2, about air facilities in Kov^eit. We note the views expressed by the Air Officer Commanding. 2. .Permission for the free use of the existing land ing ground will presumably be covered by the arrangements which tiie Political Resident has been instructed to endeavour to make with the sheikh of Koweit in regard to civil and military aerodromes in his territory. 3. as regards additional facilities to meet possible future requirements, the attitude of the Koweit Oil Company is, I think, an important factor. In their conversations with us they have emphasised their desire that we shoulu, so far as possible, have selected any areas we may wish for defence etc. purposes in advance, and while the suggestion made by you in the Qatar facilities, that the phrase ' Wing Commander W.A. Me Claughry, DSC., MC#, DFC., Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, W.C. 2. connection with any sites wnich may/mmay have been selected' in Clause 5 01 the Government Agreement should he strengthened, e.g. on the lines '’any sites which may he required', was discussed with them a few days ago, they took the line that the revised wording would place them in an impossible position. Unless, therefore, the Air Ministry see strong objection, we think it would be desirable to take immediate steps to select the actual sites which will, in the Air Officer Commanding’s opinion, be required near Jhaira and Subaihiya. Once the sites have been selected the desirability of acquiring them ana also the site described in (a) of the Air Officer Commanding 1 s telegram of 26th January, as an insurance against the future, could be considered. Pending a decision on this point it will probably be desirable not to let it become generally known locally that we may be requiring certain sites in the near future, since if the areas referred to by the Air Officer Commanding are not Government land tte effect may be to put up the price against us. 4- The position in regard to the points dealt with in paragraph 2 of your letter under reply is generally similar to that in regard to Qatar* An assurance has been/seen obtained from the Company as regards wireless ana other methods of communication; difficulty should not presumably arise as regards the point referred to in (b); point (c) is one for consideration, as is point (a); point (e) is a matter for local discussion ana agreement ox financial terms once any new landing grounds have been acquired; (f) is equally for local discussion in the first place, as is (h); the position in regard to (g) is as stated in respect of Qatar in paragraph 5 of my letter No. p.2*7 27/34 of 1st February. 5* I am sending copies of this letter to 7/arner at the Foreign Office, Seal at the Admiralty, and Starling at the Petroleum Department. Copies will also go by the next air mail to Fowle, to whom a copy of your letter under reply ana of my letter of 1st February, p.z.727/34, to you about Qatar, were sent by the air mail of 2nd February. We understand that the Resident, accompanied by Colonel Dickson, is to visit Bagbidaa about 15th February to discuss anti-smuggling measures in Koweit, and we suggest that the opportunity might be taken for a/- 4 - a discussion between ?ov/le, Dickson and the Air Cfiicer Coiiimanding, on the subject of Koweit air facilities. Yours sincerely, J.G. LAITHWAITE.P • z &lt; 11th August, 1933 . AIR KAIL. CONFIDI^TIAL.

As will be seen from the correspondence in question, there is now general agreement, in the light of discussions with Lieutenant Colonel Pa/le, among the interested Departments of His Majesty’s Government as to the advantage of adopting a uniform procedure in dealing with the provision »f air facilities in the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf. Agreement has also been reached as to the general basis of such a procedure. The broad features of the procedure proposed are that the Arab rulers concerned should be advised to mak« air navigation regulations of their own in terms drafted by His Majesty’s Government; to issue a special authorisation in respect of/ &gt;reign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department,4 -/ ♦ \y rr a of aircraft permitted to fly over and land in their territories; to lay down in terms to bo approved by Government conditions to govern the use of their aerodromes; and finally to enter into agreements with His Majesty’s Government under which His Majesty’s Government shall have exclusive rights, subject to certain conditions, to establish and maintain, as the agents of the Sheikh concerned, and subject to the terms of the air navigation regulations, etc* referred to above, an aerodrome or aerodromes and ancillary services within the ruler’s territory, and to charge and retain fees in respect of the use of such aerodromes and such ancillary services. As will be seen, the broad principle underlying the proposed new procedure is that, while full control should in fact rest in the hands of His Majesty’s Government, it should, so far as possible, appear to rest with the local ruler* J. I am now to enclose copies of (1) Air navigation regulations for civil aircraft- to be made by the local ruler concerned* ( 2 ) Draft heads of agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh (Sultan) of the principality concerned; ( 3 ) Conditions to be laid down with tho approval of the Ruler to govern the use of the aerodromes; ( 4 ) Draft special authorisation, for issue by tho Ruler, for aircraft to fly over and land in tho territory of the local ruler concerned* The second schedule to the Third Document referred to above is still under consideration by Imperial Airways* Every effort will be made to obtain with the minimum of delay the information required, but it is thought undesirable any longer to postpone a communication on the general question for this reason.4 * I am to request that, if no objeotion is seen, the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf may now be instructed to secure the consent of the Sheikh of Bahrein, the Sheikh of Kov/eit and (in respect of Gwadur) the Sultan of Muscat to the adoption of a procedure of the nature suggested and to the completion of agreements in the terms of the drafts which have been agreed. Shargah is already covered by a separate agreement which will not expire until 1942. Minor facilities such as emergency landing grounds in States other than those referred to above can best be dealt with separately on terms to be approved in the light of the special circumstances of each case. 5- A oopy of this letter is being sent direct to the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf.

We are being pressed by the oheik of Kuwait and the Political Agent, Colonel DicKson, to make a regular call at that place. We have agreed to do so for six months experimental ly on the occasions on which no delay to the schedule would be involved by maxing the call. The Sheik of Kuwait has offered to build a small resthouse at the aero drome, provided we will undertake to make a regular call. So far we have no agreement of any sort in regard to our landings, nd it seems that it is desirable for us^o conclude an agreement, just as we are trying to do with Bahrein. I believe the India Office do not approve of a direct approach to Bahrein and negotiations are going on through the Air Ministry. Rre the circumstances in regard to Kuwait the same, or may we in this case deal with the Sheix of Kuwait? Since in this case at any rate the agreement would be between two willing parties, I believe that the agreement could be concluded more quickly if we could negotiate direct. F.G.L.

The Eastbound air mail managed to reach Kuwait on the 15th January, but having tried to make Bahrain was forced to return to Kuwait and Shaibah after proceeding 80 miles to the South. The pilot described the fog as of remarkable density 50 miles South of Kuwait. (c) A pleasing feature was the way the Kuwait aerodrome stood up to the bad weather - The heavy aircraft mentioned in (b) above, though it landed and tooktook off twice within two hours on ground which had been steadily rained on for 72 hours and was thoroughly soaked, suffered little inconvenience, the wheels of the machine only sinking a couple of inches or so.

Sir, In continuation of my letter No.715-S, dated the 28th September 1932, I have the honour to state that X subsequently received a letter from Messrs.Imperial Airways Limited, London, stating that the possibility of dropping mails over Kuwait by parachute was engaging the Company’s attention, and requesting an estimate of the amount of mail for which they might be required to cater. I replied that I would communicate the information, when received, to His Majesty’s Government. 2. The Political Agent, Kuwait, after consulting His Excellency the Shaikh and local merchants estimates that the weekly air mail from either direction ( if it is decided to drop the inward mail by parachute, and not pick up any mail bagsj will not at first exceed 8 lbs. in weight, but that it is likely later to rise to approximately 16 lbs. after mails have been dropped regularly for some time. 3 On the other hand, Colonel Dickson thinks that.

Please see previous submission on P.Z.5440/32 below on the subject of the making of occasional landings at Koweit with aircraft on the England-India air service by Imperial Airways. It will be seen that the Resident had taken action on his own on the strength of the request made by the local representative of Imperial Airways and that arrangements have now been made for occasional calls and for the exemption of the Company from landing fees by the Sheikh. 2. Imperial Airways have since been warned by the Air Ministry that we should prefer that they should deal with questions such as the/I the present through the Air Ministry and the India Office and not through the political authorities in the Persian Gulf, -fesa 'ihe terms of the Government of India's letter of 28th September, on P.2.6207/32, it=wmild appear that they too vyould prefer that action should he taken by the Gulf authorities in matters such as this only on definite Instructions from the secretary of State (or the Government of India). No harm has been done in this instance, but the position is rather Complicated by the fact that we have received an enquiry from the Dutch as to whether we will be prepared to allow their civil aircraft to use landing grounds at Koweit and also at Yas Island. Papers &amp;fc*e basn submitted separately about this. To some extent the permission for occasional calls now granted by the Sheikh to Imperial Airways constitutes a precedent. But it need not perhaps be an embarrassing one, for the circunstances are quite different - Airways are calling to oblige the .Sheikh and not as part of a regular arrangement.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to oorresponaenoe forwarded under India Office Printed Letter F.2. 5440/32, dated ^5th September 1932, on the subject of permission for occasional landings at Kuwait by Imperial Kirways. 2. The Shaikh of Kuwait was very desirous that Imperial Airways machines should call at Kuwait and it was on this account that Sir Hugh Bisoce discussed the question with Lieut-Commander Galpin. I received Colonel Burehall 9 s letter Ho.HB/P3/10V2, of 23rd Au- -gust on 5th September. 1 concur that it would nor- -mally be better for Imperial Airways to address such communications to the Air Ministry. In view however, of the Shaikh 9 s attitude and the certainty that he would be only too willing to afford Imperial Airways every facility, and having regard to the short period re- -maining before the opening of the air route, I for warded.. •forw*ird«&lt;l a oo y of Oolonel Burohall # 8 letter to th« lollt oal Agent, Kuwait, and asked him to •xpl&amp;in the Company's position to the Shaikh and to request the latter to confirm the Company's assumption - which seems reasonable - that no landing fees should he charged* I suggested that this could heat he done hy an exchange of letters. I am expecting shortly to hear in re*ly from Colonel Dickson. 5. As regards the desirability of asking His High- •ness' permission for British CItII Aircraft to land at Kuwait.

September, 1932 Sir I am commanded by the Air Council to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, a copy of correspondence with Imperial Airways Limited, concerning occasional landings at Koweit of the Company’s aircraft operating on the England-India Air Service, officially advised of the desirability of submitting applications of this nature to the Air Ministry in the first instance, give his consideration to this proposal of the Company and will arrange for any necessary instructions on the subject to be sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. For their part, the Council see no objection to the Company making occasional visits to Koweit, as proposed. The Council are, however, not clear whether it 3s necessary or even desirable, as perhaps creating a precedent, to ask the Sheikh for permission for British civil aircraft to land at Koweit, This aspect of the question will no doubt be before Sir Samuel Hoare.

HB/PS/1073 23rd August, 1932 Dear Bertram, I enclose herewith a copy of a letter despatched to the Political Resident at Bushire, which I think is self explanatory. I hope in writing to him we are not cutting across the proper channels of communication, tut you will notice that we are only carrying out the request made to us by the late Political Resident.

Commander Calpin, was staying with the late Political Resident in Bushire while making arrangements for the transfer of the air route from the Persian to the Arabian side of the Persian Gulf. It transpired at that time that the Shaikh of Koweit was very keen for us to make a regular stop at Koweit, although from our point of view there appears to be no reason for it. No decision was made at the time, but Sir Hugh Biscoe said that, if we would infom him of our decision at a later date, he would advise the Shaikh and obtain the formal permission necessary to observe the courtesies. In view of the expressed wish of the Shaikh of Koweit, we are agreeable to stop at Koweit on the same basis as shipping makes occasional calls, i.e. 'if inducement offers and conditions permit'. We should also be glad to have the necessary p rmission to make occasion calls there to pick up fuel in adverse weather conditions, even though no load was being carried to or from Koweit. We would propose, subject to the pa mission being granted, to employ an agent at Koweit who could secure the reservations of acconimodatlon by telegraph from our Station Superintendent at Basra* We should be grateful, therefore, if our position in the matter could be explained to the Shaikh of Koweit and to Colonel Dickson. It Is assumed that, in view of the Shaikh's express wish that the service should be made available to passengers to or from Koweit, no charges in the way of landing fees, etc. would be raised against us.

While we note that your letter to him arises out of a suggestion of the late Sir Hugh Biscoe, we cannot help thinking that time will as a general rule be lost rather than gained by such direct coniminicatlons. It is probable that in most instances the Political Resident will feel unable to act without seeding instructions from London, as political considerations are nearly always involved in these matters.

The primary focus is the negotiation of a Civil Air Agreement between the British Government and the Shaikh of Kuwait, Shaikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir al-Sabah [Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ] in 1934, its subsequent renewal in 1938, 1945, and discussion related to its possible further renewal in 1948. Draft and final copies of each agreement can be found within the file; a 1934 copy contains both English and Arabic versions of the document (see folio 185-187). Correspondence related to occasional amendments has also been included.Also discussed in the correspondence is the granting of permission for Imperial Airways (later the British Overseas Airways Corporation - BOAC) to land in Kuwait in September 1932 for a period of six months, and the establishment of an airmail service in 1948. It also contains some correspondence relating to British military requirements in Kuwait, and the transfer of the maintenance of the Kuwait Aerodrome from the Royal Air Force (RAF) to the Kuwait Oil Company.The file also contains proposals from the Kuwait Oil Company for the construction of a new aerodrome in 1948, including two plans for the proposed airstrip (see folios 20-21).In addition to the copy of the Kuwait Civil Air Agreement (1934), the file contains a limited amount of correspondence with both English and Arabic translation.The main correspondents are as follows: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Political Agent at Kuwait. The file also contains correspondence with the following departments of the British Government: the Air Ministry, the Foreign Office, the India Office (the Commonwealth Relations Office from August 1947), and the Ministry for Civil Aviation.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Landing grounds</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Airways</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Commonwealth Relations Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Overseas Airways Corporation</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Oil Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Kuwait</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001f3#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
