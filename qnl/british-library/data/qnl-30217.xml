If any practical result is to be obtained, preparation and action are probably over due already and it migjit be possible to arrive at definite decisions regarding the matters which are most likely to lead to a practical and fruitful result and to discuss these while I am to Teheran. 2. I would divide the matters under consideration under four heads;- ' A - Commerce. B - Works. C - Industrial assistance. D - Cultural exchanges.

He will be given a short term of attachment to the Commerce Department before he cones out. It seems to me most.important that the set-ap of the Indian Trade Commissioner^ office in Teheran should be considered. Before he comes he ou^xt presumably to have a good office and showrooms and we must consider what his relations with Consulates will be. In particular it seems to me f that it may be necessajy to have a Branch office at XEfi Ehorramshahr which will be the mpon port of trade between India and Persia. ^ (ii) Use of existing British publicity facilities in Iran and of indy’s own propaganda vehicles lor cogmer cial ahggj' tisement f to puch Indian export trade. - It should be possible to divide commercial publicity into - (a) Advertisement c£ what India is already doing to supply essential raw products, e.g. tea and textiles; and (b) A section clearly labelled 'Post-war* indicating what she hopes to do to increase (a) and to open up other lines as soon as the Quota system has been superseded.

(i) Appointment of In dian irade Conmissioner. - It was agreed that Major Hassan would be a very sintaBle choice and it was hoped that hia arrival may not be long delayed. Major Savidge undertook to examine the premises which have been suggested for the Trade Coamissioner f s office. It was strongly advised that furniture of good Quality should be brought from India. It was felt that the Trade Commissioner’s office should be thoroughly well set up from the outset and that the Ghvt. of India should be prepared to incur this expenditure. Furniture in Teheran is extremely bad and extremely expensive and it would be worth while bringing good furniture all the way by road. It was agreed that the Commercial Secretariat would examine proposals for a branch office for Additional Vice Consul at Khorramshahr or alternatively at Bandarshahpur. (ii) Use of existing British publicity facilities in Tran sr lb puatnntnan ^p°^| a ^'| cl Q ei:uciea lor cairaercial' advertise~^nt ^ (a) It was realised that M.E.S.C. was not in a position to ^dian trade but that the Ministry of Information should be able to do it if the picture v?as oade clear to theca. Their iacilities Doth at headQuartera and in the Consulate showrooms /were excellent. India was in every way entitled to push its ?^ r S ia ^ even during the remaining ^'part oi hostilities it should be posable to adjust a policy of expanded Indianexpoct wi th the M.fi.S.Ct programme. It was mentioned that the consent of the concerned Department in India had been obtained to the expert of 1.000 tons of seed wheat to southern Persia and when the details were clear, it was agreed that this would form an admirsble subject for practical publicity. It was also mentioned that the Embassy’s aclvice had been asked regarding the allocation of a portion of the textiles Quota to southern Iran. It was strongly urged by H.M’s Ambassador and others that if a small additLon could be made to the Quota oi textiles for southern Iran, this would be far the oest and have a considerable propaganda value in an area in wmch India was particularly interested. m It was stated that regional self-sufficiency was not a lor^ term programme but a necessity for M.E.S.C. a^ present Generally Mr .Hobson stated that he thought he would be correct in saving that M.E.S.C.. would not be opposed to increase in IndiaTs exports though it would be necessary to adjust items of proposed increase against their programme. .That was needed was to work out a programme oi expanded exports, aid then to consider adjustments. As regards ahippirdfc. Secretary, External Affairs Deptt. informed the M.E.S.C. that there was'reason to-- QV l believe that some thouaajds of tons were at present held up in Indian parts and shipping up the Gulf remained a very considerable problem, ir. Hobson stated that this would be tackled from their 6 end also. M.E.S.C. had been given to understand tint shipping, would t£t 1 thi.*hS dS«. &amp;r8 “ am India b '‘ 14 gagrjjaif&amp;e in aid of Indian p ob t-war expert drive snd ^rErally to advertise Indian coiimercial as si stance to Persia* i£ miAht be necessary, however, to ask India to increase her contribution to publicity in Persia which at present stands at Ha. 50,000/- having been reduced from its former figure of Hs. 1 lakh! «i . A s regards India;s own propaganda vehicles, it was felt ohat an Indian puolicity organization in Teheran itself was needed to supplement what was done by the Indian Foreign Publicity organization in Delhi. The need for this would be emphasised when Major Savidge ]e ft his present post. Mr. Binglev of the British Oouncil stated his conviction that there was ^ v endless scope for work of this kind both in the commercial and cuitjUTcix lisids# +„ fran r’ersia to Tn^a r - At present the balance of noo so important as Persia would want anything sne could get and in any case there were few items that Per , s ^-f could expert. The possibilities were sulphur, antimony ana also /anes anu vegetable oils. Mineral oil fias of course been left out of this calculation. 4. 2 - TORES. . . (1) Irrigation. - It was explains d that a project for a Jar^e irrigation scheme near Shustar from the Karun river had already been prepared by a PjA.I.C. Engineer, but it was generally ^ realised that large irrigation works could not be embarked on without cneck and counter-check aid it was agreed that India welihcthen-ht source for obtaining an advisory report ^ad aiready been done. The importaice of the Khuzistan area to British and Indian interests as the point where oil, railway and shippinginterests,converge and where the PersLan aovt. was likely to be faced with disorder from the Arab tribes, and the need for finding employment for demobilized labour, ma++fr r ? n ^ ly v. s ?'? ss u d ’ j . a ? d lt wa f suggested that the whole matter ^eQuired to be taken up at a very hisji level. aientioned the names of possible choices for the Irrigation Engineer including Mr. Oddin Ihylor, who was employed in a responsible capacity on the Sukkur Barrage and has since been working on Quetta Reconstruction. ^ Pgfi^tructi?n f - H*M f s Ambassador stated that Persia already has as many roads as she could pay for and he saw no hooe for much development in this direction. * The possibility of using Indian assistance for airfield construction was mentioned but the sense of the meeting was that Persia had probably already constructad through foreiji agency all J u 6£©stiors for the extension of the Indian ai lines tnrougji Al^nanisfin to PersL a and IraQ were mentioned in this^ connection and it was noted that one of the chief obstacles likel} to be the obtaining oi Afghan agreecent. t .(?)

'.B.S .0.“ suggested what.the result of the repxt would be interesting to India and it was agreed that this was so* It w*s doubtful whether India could assist in this direction.ItT'' -7 fa J- 0 *■ i No, D&gt;45Q5-N/44 dear Bullard, Sxternal Affairs Departments-^ New Delhi.

The tour of the Persian Cultural Mission and the strong demand for Indians to te»ch English, go to show that the reputed prejudice against Indians was to some extent at least an oificially imposed product of the late Shah r s policy and need not be regarded as a permanent feature of Persia’s national mentality. f&gt;o z o p 05 D &gt; o § rn ioj % O fa W Cn m ; r; m ro -&lt; *-7 i 1 r~ 2 | C71 S ^ 5 _L &lt; H &gt; : cc m ^ | -F. Q 33 2. There is of course no suggestion that India should enter into competition with United Kingdom technicians. Far from it. The object wpuld be that in spheres in which Indian techni cians have acquired a higji degree of experience and training they should fill a complementary role to United Kingdom technicians in Persia (as also, we hope, in other Middle East countries) in the post-war period, thereby presenting a united ^Commonwealth front* against the penetra tion of Axis, Russia or other foreign specialists. 3. As one example India could not compete with United Kingdom technicians in the Persian aigar-refining industry: for Indian experience is confined to cane-sugar, while Persian sugar is practically all derived from beet. Similarly, in i ish-canning, India is still herself insu fficiently advanced to have men to spare for other countries and in any case could not presume to compete with Scandinavia. But there may be an opportunity, which the M.E.S.C. might canningof Persian fruit. I note f» from the last annual report of the National Bank of Persia, that Persia’s exports of fruit dropped by 27,000 tons m 1942-43 m comparison with the previous year, presumably because the fruit was consumed in the country by the Allied forces. This indicates that a large surplus will be available for consumption or export on the expirt of the Treaty and the withdrawal of the Alliea troops. In . r\ the absence of sufficient means of distribution. there will, it seems probable, be wastage of this fruit, unless steps are taken now to plan a prpgramme of canning it. India has now considerable experience in fruit-canning and could probably* spare a few experts. 4. The particular spheres in which Indian techniciatjs could be of use^e* Persia|i would oe • — (a) Textile factories. Cotton &amp; Wool (i) spinning, (ii) weaving, (iii) dyeing* (b) Public Works. (i) irrigstion, (ii) road construction (iii) house-building. Under (a) India has now a certain number of men fit to work as sub-Managers and foremen in the various branches. Under (b) her Irrigation Engineers have constructed the greatest canals in the world, and a vast amount of new experience has been acquired on roads and buildings during the war. Irrigation projects are already being considered at ahushtar and on the Mund River near Bushire, and if it were thou^xt worth while the Industries and Civil Supplies Department /migjib...*might possibiybe able to apare their Industrial Adviser, Yesugar, for a short surveying tour in Persia* 5* The further suggestion has been made that India mi^it make a valuable contribution to the development of the film industry in Persia* The Indian film industry is rapidly reaching a gjk ^ higji degree of technical skill* while Persia has a wealth of material, poetry* song and legend, ' that is eminently ’•filmable** Northern India r s cultural and linguistic connections with Persia are sufficiently close to make the Indian film industry the obvious mentor for Persia* It would be a thousand pitita if Persia* with her magnificent background* should tread the primrose path to Hollywood* 6* We should be grateful to receive your comments on these suggestions in due course* I should perhaps explain that this letter is of course exploratory only and clearly the first thing would be to stimulate in the Persian breast a desire for technical assistance from India in certain spheres* Perhaps your Commercial Attache’ could indicate the industries in respect of which it would be useful to try and find technical personnel from India* We would then do our best: although war pressure and expansion tend to keep Indian technicans fully employed, we would hope to find a few even in present circumstances and to expand supply when war pressure begins to be relaxed* Yours sincerely.

Extract from Telegram No. 143 SAVING from Tehran to Foreign Office, dated the 5th October 1943* 6. ( e) Publ ic Works a nd Industrial Development. There is enormous scope for irrigation and hydro-electric development in which British firms might participate. The first would help Persia’s basic industry, agriculture, and at the same time provide water power for industrial development. The Tehran area has good possibilities of this kind which are being investigated by American irrigation adviser to the Persiap Government. Furthermore tne capital has not yet a piped water supply. Similar development can be carried out in and near other large cities. With cheap power available industry (especially chemical), mining and transport could be developed with profit. \ (f) Tech n ical Help . (i) The ex-Shah's programme of industrialisation required the help of European technicians to build and run factories. Many of these were Germans. It will be some years before the Persians are good enough engineers and administrators to be independent of foreign help; and we now have an excellent opportunity of getting rid of German influence, which is still very strong in the ccmnercial community, by placing British technicians and machinery in the industries and factories. The Middle East Supply Centre has a nucleus of British specialists who are working to keep Persian industry operating and would be an excellent channel through whom permanent appointments of this kind could be made. (ii) Experts are needed for the textile industry (especially the cotton section) to improve methods of production and to advise on the maintenance of existing equipment and the ordering of more machinery. They would also select young Persians for training in the United Kingdom. The railway needs trained men to take over from the Americans after the war. These should receive their training in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, these young technicians would be able to replace British technicians if the latter should go. Their training in England could be effected by means of British Council scholarships.
