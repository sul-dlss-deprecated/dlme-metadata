I enclose copies of correspondence between the Director of Customs and Yousuf Kanoo* It is true that Yousuf Kanoo has no staff or craft for undertaking this work and Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Company are fully qualified to do it* If any importance is attached to efficiency in handling these steamers I think Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Company would be more competent and effective than Yousuf Kanoo. I am reluctant however to deal with the matter myself as foreign interests are concerned and also I feel quite sure that Yousuf Kanoo would regard any suggestion of this kind from me as a personal matter so I would be grateful if you would give an opinion on the matter. E. B. Wakefield, Esquire, I.C.S., H. B. M*s Political Agent, Bahrain.My dear Belgrave, I am aorry for the delay in replying to your D«0«letter No*433-13/23,dated the 16th March,1942. If the Shipping Companies referred to in the enclosure to your letter want to employ K*S-Haji Vusu' Kanoo as their agent I can see no objection to t heir being allowed to do so. If their business is handled inefficiently, they will no doubt pppoint another agent in due course. If necessary,i.e. if inefficient handling of their steamers affects adversely work in the port, they could be advised to change their agent.
