I enclose a summary of the major cases of arms trafficking which have come to the notice ol this Agency in the last two years. 3 . phe summary discloses that the traific in arms and ammunition is very active and that it occurs in Bahrein, Qatar and the Trucial Coast and that persons in Persia are the buyers. 4. As regards Bahrein. This-island is, unfortunately, the worst offender, though the Government have taken steps to arrest and punish culprits when they have been able to. The worst case of all (No..ll) is under investigation and I shall report fully later. Suffice it to say now that, prima facie, the incident is due to the neglect of the Bahrein Government in not taking proper security measures. 5. There are two bad cases in the Trticial Coast, ^ (Nos.6 &amp; 12), both due, in the main, to the non-reliability of service guards at Sharjah. 6. In Qatar the Darwish brothers are implicated and punitive measures have been taken against them. The^ source of their supply is not known but in all probabilit,y they are in touch with both the Bahrain and the L rucial Coast trafficiters. ATTESTED.

He 'wrote off' the ammunition (apparently showing it as having been expended) and dropped the matter.

MEMORANDUM Reference Case No.12 in enclosure to my Express Letter No.c/1144, dated the 27th of*December, 1945. 2. The political Officer, Trucial Coast, reports that the Officer Commanding, R.A.F. Levies, at Sharjah, took exception to the allegation resulting from the evidence of the Sheikh's tracker that his Levies were involved in the theft of the two boxes of ammunition and 'wrote off' the ammunition (apparently showing it as having been expended). A proper enquiry was not held, nor was action taken to recover the ammunition and trace the responsible parties. It appears that the Officer Commanding, R.A.F., agreed to this, prima facie, irregular procedure. 3. He adds that the Officer Commanding R.A.F. Levies has since been demobilized and that the R.A.F. Station Commander concerned and his Adjutant have left Sharjah, and that in view of their departure and the lapse of time he does not consider that any useful purpose would be served by re-opening the matter. 4. I do not agree with his views since the dis appearance of ammunition automatically reflects badly on the Trucial Sheikhs and certainly provides material for highly dangerous contraband traffic. Furthermore, if British authorities do not vigorously pursue cases which come to their notice the political authorities cannot expect the Sheikhs to co-operate in cases of theft,etc. 5. I, therefore, suggest that the matter be taken up with the R.A.F. Political Agent, Bahrain. NS.-a '''a— — ■H i&gt;l( ■&gt; GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. Department.

The B.A.F. inform me that no Courts-martial were convened in the cases referred to. The proceedings of the Courts of Inquiry were sent to B.A.F. H.q. They replied in rarch 1945 apparently attributing the loss of the ammunition to gross neylect of duty on the part of the R.A.F. locally recruited Levies and recommended that the question of their replacement be considered. The stolen ammunition was 'written off' at G-overnment expense. 3. As regards the extent to which the Shaikhs askaris were implicated in the theft, it is difficult for me to express an opinion because there is no one in Sharjah now who has any personal knowledge of the case, with the exception of course of Conf^S-hds^P-(M-i723)-4-2-36-200. 000 .

Levy Company was posted* The Officer Commanding Bo.44 Staging Post, R.A.F. subsequently informed the Political Officer, Trucial Coast, (a) that a Court of iinquiry was held and (b) that a further theft of some 1100 rounds took place from the Levy SA store on the ni^it of the 20th November 1944. A further theft of 2500 rounds of 5A ammunition is reported to have been stolen from the R.A.F. camp on 14th November 1945. 2 . I should be glad if you would inform me what steps are being taken to prevent these recurring thefts of British ammunition as their appearance on the Persian Coast - to which they are eventually smuggled — results in protests from the Persian Government that we are not taxing adequate steps to check the smuggling of arms from territory under our control, and, indeed, to the accusation by interested parties that we are actually conniving at the contraband arms traffic.

Reference my memorandum No. 344-25/l dated the # 7th December 1945. Aoai Ibrahim Rezapur (son of Doctor Habib Rezapur), v&gt;lerk of the novernor of L^r, has in tlie past been visiting Gabandi and Charak frequently but I connected them with his ofjicia1 duty. His Urother Abdur Rahim Rezapur, who is ccarrying on a smuggling trade with his headquarters in Dubai, has also been visiting Bastak and Lar. , In October last I gathered that Ibrahim Rezapur had received large sums of money from Bhaikh fassir Nassoury and others as bribes. It now transpires that these sums were against the delivery of arms and ammunition along the Shibku ports and Gabandi. They were also sold in Bastak. An informant recently stated that (l) the Rezanur brothers are trading in arms via Qais, Charak, Kalat, Shiyu, i^alatoo, Bustanoo and Kangan and that Abdur Rahim Rezapur in November 1945 despatched ten rifles (British and German) which were ultimately sold in Gabandi; (It is regretted that more definite details are not available); and (2) Ghhikh Mohammed A1 Ali, of Charak, Shaikh Abdullah A1 All of Qais, and Mohammed Azam Beni Abbasian, Deputy Governor of Bastak, are also imolicated. It may here be noted that Aqai Farni, Governor of Lar, is said to received his share from Ibrahim Rezapur. L• Shaikh Mohammed A1 Ali (Charak) admitted to me that arms were being imported via Qais and Charak but said that neither he nor his brother Shaikh Abdullah A1 Ali (Qais) had any definite information. I left the matter at that. Aqai Jaqad Rezapur (uncle of the persons named in paragraph 2 above) belongs to Lingah but is practicing dentistry in Dubai. I doubt, with Doctor DeSouza also in Dubai, if he could be carrying on a Paying practice. That he is assisting his nephews under the guise of dentistry I am now inclined to credit. I therefore venture to suggest that the necessary enquiries may be elicited. Sd. D.J. Stephens.

Zair Ahmad Khan of Ashkanan arrived in Dubai about 5 months ago with the object of buying su^ar and tea and returned to Persia after staying here one month but exported nothing. Salih bin Muhammad al Mabili, the arms broker in Dubai, denies emphatically having sold any arms to Zair Ahmad Khan or hnving even heard of him. There is no one in Dubai with the name of Muhammad Re^apur. The information received by the Consular Agent, Lingah, appears to be untrue and highly exaggerated as it is every unlikely that such a large number or rifles should be available in Dubai for sale and subsequent export. The Rulers of the Trucial Coast themselves, and particularly the Ruler of Dubai, are after a-ms and would not miss any chance to buy any good rifle that the^r can come aceross and pay good prices for the good ones varying from Bs.1000/- to Br.1500 for each. It is probable that small numbers of old rifles secretly find their way into Persia from the Tmcial Coast but I am quite certain that at no time can a large consignment # such as the one reported, be exported from Dubai without being noticed. 3. Arms and ammunition are usually imported into the Trucial Coast and Persia from the following places:- Arms are, of course, smuggled from these places but I am told that those coming from TT ukalla are accompanied by export manifests; they come to Mukalla from the Yemen. Small arms ammunition are sold in the above places at P ? .30 to 35 per hundred and fetch Rs.60 to 80 in Dubai. Ammunition v/ith black lend for Martini type of rifles have a better demand on the Trucial Co-st and can sell at P?..200 per hundred. A part of small arms ammunition are from those dumpbd into the* sea by the ^.A.t. but these invariable are sold' - at a cheaper price. vessel' arrived from ? T ukalla to TTiissat with a consignment of 36 rifles and about 29,000 rounds of ammunition said to have been exported on a manifest, the owner being a native of Dubai named Sa’id bin Abdu^ Rahman bin Khalfan. The arrival of this boat coincided with the visit to Muscat of one Obaid bin Ghubash 'ho irnd been sent by the Ruler of Dubai to buy 'trms end ammunition for him.

After compliments: I beg to inform you*that last year I was involved in disasters which after being a rich man converted me into a very poor man, thus : I was the proprietor of a dhow which used to sail between the Persian coasts as a freighter. Once one of the British Consuls at Dubai (*) directed me to take some goods and men to Jask, which I undertook to do. But before reaching the destination a heavy storm broke out and we had to take refuge at the port of Makran. On the same day a number of Baluch thieves attacked us and looted all the goods as well as my own property which amounted to Ps.16,000/- (goods h cash), and in addition to this they sunk my dhow. Fortunately, our 1 ives were saved by a small boat which we hired and. escaped. In view of the fact that I have, afte v ’ this problem, lost all property and hardly hav° anything to support my family with, I have referred my cas- to you requesting that you may please accord assistance in rescuing my family poverty. rv Usual ending.D.Q.

In 1944 P.A.B. received many complaints from P.R. and P.A.M. of the use of the T.C. as a centre of arms traffic. P.A.B. replied that while there undoubtedly was smuggling of arms there were mostly ^of old rifles, and few in number, vide p.202 and 207 ibid. There seems little doubt however that fairly large quantities of arms and ammunition were reaching T.C. fron&gt; East Africa and the raiding of R.A.F. dumps was another source of supply to the arms smugglers. 3. Bahrain was held responsible for some of this arms smuggling but the real centre of this traffic was Dubai, Sharjah, Khor Fakkan and the Batinah Coast, vide p.238 ibid. . 4 . in 1945 there seems to have been.a diminution of this traffic. On T.C. only two thefts of arms and ammunition were reported during 1945. An American carbine was stolen in Oct. from U.S.A.T.C. Camp at Sharjah by bedouins of the Beni Qitab, (reported at para.137 of T.C. News No.19), but was recovered with the assistance of the Shaikh and the culprits apprehended, and 2,500 rounds of S.A.A. were stolen in Nov. from the R.A.F. Camp at Sharjah, the culprits being identified by a tracker as R.A.F. Levies. No further details have yet been reported. ► h 1 5 . 6. 7. In Qatar smuggling of arms and other commodities is organised by the Darwish brothers, vide s.14 and 17 of F.l/A/5, and recent references to their activities are at s.80, 85, and s.6 of this file. s.90 of F.l/A/5 names Bahrain as the headquarters of one of the 4 arms smugglers mentioned but the only activity that has come to notice this year is the theft of l # 8OO0rounds of S.A.A. from Jidda Island, vide F.41/3 below. We have still to reply to P.R.'s X.L. at s.10 on this file. Fewer cases of arms traffic were brought to light this year than last year. R.A.F. dumps were more carefully guarded and supplies from East Africa were not forthcoming in as large quantities as before. The many requests for arms and ammuni tions we have received from the T.C. Sheikhs also seem to bear out the supposition that there is little arms or ammunition to be had there. The Persian Government, however, are still anxious about the smuggling of arms into Persia and we have recently been asked by P.R. to induce the Sheikhs to adopt a system of arms licences for the arms carried by dhows in their voyages about the Gulf. The Bahrain Government see no objection to such a system and we are addressing other Sheikhs asking them to adopt the system. i it P.A.
