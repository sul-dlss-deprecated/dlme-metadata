Sanderson , Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, To—The Under-Secretary of State for India. I am directed by the Marquis of Salisbury to transmit to you a copy of a despatch from Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople reporting that the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs has called attention to information which is said to have reached the Porte of the appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Bahrein, and has requested that Her Majesty's Government will apply to the Porte for his Exequatur. Lord Salisbury has no knowledge of such an appointment, and he will be obliged if the Secretary of State for India will inform him whether he is aware of any proposal to appoint a British Agent in the district in question. I am to add that Lord Salisbury proposes, with the concurrence of Lord G. Hamilton, to approve the reply which Sir P. Currie suggests should be returned to the Porte, if necessary, namely, that Her Majesty's Government cannot admit the right of the Porte to insist on Consular Officers in Bahrein being provided with an Ottoman Exequatur. No. 2 (Consular), dated Constantinople, the 19th January 1898. From— Sir P. Currie , Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, To—The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Some days ago the Secretary General for Foreign Affairs, acting under instructions from the Minister, called attention to the fact that information had reached the Porte of the appointment of a British Vice-Consul at Bahrein, and requested that Her Majesty's Government would apply to the Porte for his Exequatur. He was informed that Her Majesty's Embassy had heard nothing of such an appointment, and that, if the Porte desired further information, it would be well to make application through the Ottoman Ambassador in London.

I am directed by Lord George Hamilton to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th February, on the subject of a representation made by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Aifairs to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Con stantinople, regarding an alleged proposal to appoint a British Vice-Consul at Bahrein. In reply I am to say that the Secretary of State for India has no knowledge of any proposal for the creation of an appointment as Vice-Consul or as British Aijent at Bahrein ; but in any case it has been the consistent practice of the British Government to repudiate any right on the part of the iurkish Govern ment to interfere in Bahrein, and Lord George Hamilton entirely concurs ir the reply which Sir P.

Dated Fort William, the Qth March 1899, I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letters cited in the margin regarding the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. 2. You have perhaps discussed with Hear-Admiral Douglas the question of what further assistance can be given by Her Majesty's ships towards stopping this illicit trade. The Government of India will be glad to consider any suggestions which you may be able to make after consulting the Naval authorities. 3. You should endeavour, if opportunity presents itself, to arrive at some arrangement with the Chief of Koweit for checking the arms trade there. 4. During the visit which you are now making to Bahrein, you will, no doubt, prosecute any necessary further enquiries in the matter of the trade there and the claims of Messrs. Fracis, Times &amp; Co. It will be convenient if the result of the proceedings pending before the Sheikh can be reported at an early date. A reference is being made to Her Majesty's Government on the subject of the disposal or storage of the arms and ammunition seized and attached at Bahrein and elsewhere, and instructions will be sent to you as soon as possible. 5. The report received with your letter No. 69, dated the 21st November 1898, contains unsatisfactory disclosures respecting the attitude of the subordinate staff of the Residency in respect to the arms trade at Bahrein. I am to request you to consider this matter in connection with the question of how British interests should in future be represented at Bahrein. If you can see I your way to doing so, you may submit proposals for a reorganisation of the 'Residency staff. I have the honour to be, S ir, Your most obedient servant, (Sd.) H.

No.616 E.A.dated 24th April 1899 Bahrein, I have the honour to report for the informat India that as the letter of the 6th March was received after my return to Bushire I determined to send Mr F.F. Prideaux my 1st Assistant to Bahrein to make further enquiries on various points which had not been disposed of during my own visit to the plac 2, ■ Mr Prideaux was specially directed to endeavour to ascertain from Sheikh Isa to get his contract for farming the Customs with the syndicate of Bunniahs cancelled, and also to try and induce the Sheikh to ask for the services of an Official to manage them for him.# • 3, I enclose for the information of the Government of India a copy of a report Mr Prideaux has given me aid I think it is clear that the Sheikh is not disposed to get off his contract with the Bunniahs ,or to apply for the help of the Government of India in managing themMe has however promised not to enter into any fresh engagement without informing us ,and when the present contract expires in April lCj02 we may he able to induce him to ask for the services of an Official. 4, I do not think however that we shoula wait till then to improve our present political arrangements • « • at Bahrein,and the presence of an able and reliable Official on our part at the place.will probably result an the Sheikh carrying out our wishes as regards the control of the Customs that is if our representative is able to gain a proper influence over him. d. I do not think that it would do to have the Political Charge and the control of the Customs vested in the same indiviaual.The Customs Officer will he to % some extent in the employment of the Sheikh t his services being lentyand will probably have enough to do in the discharge of his own immediate duties.'Oiere is on the other hand I am convinced quite enough work to employ a Political Officer fully especially if,as I would suggest hehe is also to visit Koweit and the Arab Coast, 6, Improved management of the Customs must unfortunately hold over for the should I think be lost in arranging for the appointment of i a suitable officer to represent us at Bahrein,and I venture to recommend the desirability of creating such an appointment for the favourable consideration of tae Government of India. 7, Agha Uohamed Raheem is over 55 years of age,and is not in good health.He ought therefore to be retired;but as reported in my letter No 77 dated ISth Dec ember 1898,1 aid not think it advisable to recommend his immediate retirement just now 0 He has been of consicierable assistance to me in recent negociati ons with the Sheikh of Koweit t and as there seemed a prospect of an English Officer being appointed to Bahrein I did not think it worth while to make recommendation^for a change which minht he only a temporary one%In recommending however the crzati 0:t n -f a post in which we will be represented by an English officii! I think I had better advise that Agha Mohamed Raheem,and his family should no longer be associated with us at Bahrein,and I think this can.be connection with the Arms Traffic against the Agha whose services might perhaps receive some sort of recognition fromfrom the Government of India^The British Official will require the services of a competentfNative Assistant or ffunshi ,and he will at first no aouht have to depend to some extent on his advice,! thought at first of recommend - ing that Agha Mohamed Rahim's nephew Khaleel might he employed in this duty as he is an intelligent and able man who can read and write as well as speak English,and who is well versed in the local politics of the place. It\ds however teen represented to me that the attitude taken of late years by Sheikh Isa and his undoubted leanings towards the turks are aue to ill-feeling between our Act en t ana himself .hfohamed Rahim has no doubt used his position to advance his own interests ,and has made the Sheikh feel that he is in his power to the extent that he can report unfavourably about him to us if he does not do what the Agent wishes.There reason to think that this is V with Sheikh Isa will become more satisfactory if Agha Mohamed Rahim and his family have nothing further to say to them.Our Agent at Shargah who was formerly the Arabic mnshi in this Residency and is well reported on would probably be a good selection for Bahrein ana if it is thought desirable to ao something for Khaleel he can be offered the post at Shargah. The Officer posted to Bahrein will be easily ableK able to visit Koweit and the Arab Coast if the British India Steam Navigation Company run steamers along the 6 Arab Coast,as I have heard confidentially they are think - -ing of doing f and I think the advantage of heaving an officer available for this duty will be quite as great as regards Koweit as it will be in respect to Bahrein itself. There will be a considerable amount of work to he aone, ana as the officer selected should be able and experienced and should know something of Arabic I venture to recommend that his pay and travelling allowances may be fixed on a liberal scale*1 will submit proposals on these,and otJier points such as house accommodation^Office hstabhshment etic if the Government of India decide on the appointment 9 and w w ish me to furnish further information I would also ask permission to submit my recommendations as to the officer I consiaer most suitable for the post if it is created. As regards the directions in para^ of your letter No 360 E.A.of the 6th March last I would ask permission to defer submitting proposals for the reorganization of the Residency staff till I can see if it not possible to provide elsewhere for the Assistants whose names appeared in the enquiry into the Arms Traffic. There is no immediate necessity for any change^and 1 wih not lose sight of the matter. MNo: 128 of 1899. Bush ire, 24th September 1899. To The Secretary to the Govt of India in the Foreign Department Simla, Sir, I have the honour to submit the report on questions connected with Bahrein callea for in your letter No: 991-E.A., dated the 4th July 1899, . 2, I consider that the presence of an English Office is aesirable at Bahrein in view of the great increase in British interests which has taken place there of recent years. The whole trade of the place is virtually British, and the increase during the past 20 years will be seen from our trade returns during that per id . Imports which in 1878 amounted to Rs 2229177 stood at Rs 88,27,6o0 in 1898, while exports had risen from Rs 21,81,995 in 1878 to Rs 79,40,880 in 1898. These figures I think speak for them selvesthemselves ana shew that Bahrein being generally regarded as under British protection is becoming more anu more the emporium for the trade of the adjacent Arab Coast. /'.t 3, In 1881 Colonel Ross writing to the Govt \Letter No 203,aatecL^ j 14th October 1881, of Inaia observes that * A gooa deal of inter-K est Commercial, quasCommercial and Political is centering or is about to do so, in the coun~ tries adjacent to the Gulf. Fresh Steamship Companies English ana Foreign are being orgnized; the attention of foreign officers is directea to the S. W, of Persia dca- These remarks referred to the Persian Gulf generally but I think they apply with special force as anticipating what has occurred at Bahrein in particular ana there is no doubt that the prediction has been fulfilled, Our interest in Bahrein are far more important than they were ana as the Govt of India are aware other nations are graaually up to the importance of the place. 4, At present there seem to be specially strong grounas for strenghtening our position atat Bahrein . Sheikh Esa is an old man, who, « during his earlier years, used to ant in confor- mity with the advice he received from the British Residency. Of late however he seems to have become more susceptible to the influence of persons from other nations and his chief adviser# are now French or Turkish. This change in his attituae is probably due in part ^o dislike to Agha Mahomed Raheem who has for some years been our representative in the place* t d. Prior to the reduction of the Residency Staff in 1879 the First Assistant Resident resided constantly for a portion of the year in the island but since then the Chief and his people only see the Resident or his Assistant occasi\onally and much more is consequently left in the hands of the Native Agent who is unpopular with the merchants as his CormerciCLl dealings clash with theirs, and with the Chief If whose actions he has to bring to the notice of the Residency, The appointment of will be confined to his attract more British Firms to Bahrein for already therethere are two or thvee open up dealings with the place and the numle-r will certainly be increased represented on the Island. such an Officer will inspire the Chief with greater confluence than he has at present in the motives and actions of the representa- tive of the Gout of India,. An increased sense of security will no doubt follow and , the Sheikh will be obliged to attend more to the wishes and advice of our Govt than he ' has been aoing of late. The rights of our traaers will be less interferd with and they will know where to aplly for assistance and redress. There will be fewer fraudulent tran sact ions in which British subjects are .concerned Cliams whether arising out of business trans- actions or from thefts a ■ be settlea more promptly, and there will be an end to the squeezing of British subjects by the Sheikh ana his Officers, and of the intrigues which now go on between the Bunniahs ana the Sheikh either over Customs contracts3% B- contracts , or in business matters between them selves . 7. I think the above remarks deal in part with your enquiry as to the duties of the Political Officer but in addition I would point out that he will be the accreditea channel of communtiation between the Residency and the Chiefs within his Political Charge, He will be their adviser, and will report all matters of interest that may come to his notice. He will have to see that the Treaties dealing with the Slave Trade, Piracy, and the Maritime Peace are strictly enforced, and he will have to give all the authorized assistance in his power not only to British subjects in Commercial and other matters but also perhaps to the subjects of other Powers with a view to avoiding the inter ference of their own Governments on their behalf S, The want of regular tribunals has long been felt in Bahrein and along the Arab Coast and I would suggest that the Political Officer may with advantage be invested with certain Judicial Powers Civil and Criminal Subordinate to those of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. LLf If the aepenaance of the Chiefs vn the British Government is accepted he may also endorse passports issued by them to their subjects, and might authenticate other- documents if requested to ao so. Other duties for him to . perform at Bahrein would be those carnea on in all seaport Towns in connection with shipping incluaing the compilation of Trade and other Returns, notarial records etc:. 9. None of the duties I have referred to seem to be purely ana simply Consular, and as most of them are performea in India, in Native States, by Political Officers it does not seem that the Political Officer at Bahrein should be given any Consular aesignation or Juris diction. This will however depend on the aegree of subordination which the Chiefs to whom he is accredited hold in regarcx to the Govt of Inaia, and it may perhaps be advis able to give the Officer some Consular rank which will be recognized by the Naval Officers with whom he will be brought in contact10. The Political Officer's charge will he an extensive one if, as I propose^e is employed in visiting the whole of the Arab Coast from the Mussendum Peninsula to Koweit, ana it will I think he necessary to provide a liberal allot ment for travelling which he shoula he encouraged to do constantly. 11, I am of opinion that the post should he held hy m Officer cw the Graded List of the Political Department: hut he ought to know Arabic at any rate colloquially, and it may he necessary to bring in some one from outside the Political Department. There are undoubtedly strong objections to employing natives of India or Eurasians in ports like the one I am propos- ing as the Arabs never have the same respect for them as they have for English gentlemen and I am confident that it is better to employ an officer who can be depenaed on to enforce res~ pect even if in some respects he is not souell qualified as a man of inferior position. 12. As regards the additional cost of the pro- posed appointment I have the honour to submit for favourable consideration a proposition statementstatement showing the yearly increase which it will entail together with a statement show- ing the in it i al *Mj&gt;end iture which will have to be incurred the first year. 13. As regards the latter I would observe that it will be necessary to buila a suitable residence for our representative as there are no houses available. While a house is being built he can remain in tents as the climate is neither hotjnor cold during the winter but eventually he and his office establishment and escort must be properly housed, and J do not think the amount I have suggested for this purpose is excessive. The incumbent will of course pay the usual rent assessed on the value of the house the cost of which will not therefore be an actual loss to the Govt, 14, A small Guard of Native Infantry for tAe Political Officer will I think be necessary, If one of the strength noted in the margin 1 Havildar be grantea the annual expense thereby 1 Naik 2 Lee Naiks incurred will be including that for the 9 Privates /3&gt; passages of the annual relieving parties t about Rs 3,800. As the charges for a guard ■^i . ! will however he connected with the Military Department ana will.not Ire subject to any local control I have not included it in my Tabular Proposition Statement t which only deals with charges which would come under the Head of 25 Political in the Residency Budget Estimates . The sum of Rs 18,000, which I have estimated as required for the building of the house, will I think he sufficient for the inclusion of Quar ters .also of the Guard, lo t It will be observed that my proposition statement includes certain proposals for changes in the Office Establishment &amp;ca: at the Head Quarters of the Residency, and I would in suhmi tting them for the favourable consideration of the Govt of India invite attention to the fact that there was a reduction in the number of / Asssistants here in 1879 before which there were 2 Assistants belonging to the Political Dept on 1000/ and 700/ respectively. Colonel Ross being asked if some reduction made in the cost of the Persian Gulf Residency suggested the reduction of1 I L on 1000/ ana it was then settled there should only be one Assistant from the Political Dept on 800/ Practically however the First Asst hvw rarely draws this and the pay of the Residency Staff, exclusive of the Residency Surgeon '■+ .t which prior to 1879 came to 2,000 p, m. is at present only about Rs 1,350, The First Assistant generally gets some temporary grade promotion for serving in the Persian Gulf: but he does not always really benefit from this, and I think a local allowance of 200/ woula be more suitable and induce officers to remain here longer than they do at present I think with the creatixwi of the post at Bahrein that the designation of Uncovenanted Assistant may be changed and that the incum bent may he instead be styled Super intenaent of the Residency Office on a reduced pay of 200/ rising to 250/, An average saving of 62/S a month would be maae by this change and as the First Assistant should not I consiaer receive house allowance if he gets the local allowance of 200/ a montljth.e actual increase charge IstAsst ,Rs 1,000 • • 2nd AsstRs 700 U.C.AA T.OB s 300 Rs 2,000 m ■ Icharge to Govt on this account uiil be 87/8 a month, which will probably be saved by the First Assistant netting no special grade promotco-n 16, As regards the status pay and alUancej of an English Officer for Bahrein I think the appointment should be held by a 2nd Class Political Assistant on 600/ a month with a local allowance of 250/, This will be sufficient to attract a good man especially if he is given hopes- of succeeding eventually to the more lucrative appointments at Muskat i Bushire and Baghdad. 17, I have already written that the incumbent / should know Arabic at any rate to extent of speaking it fluently, and it may perhaps be made a condition of his remaining that he qualifies in other respects up to the Higher Standard or even Proficiency Examinations. An Officer with A this qualification will no doubt be often very useful to the Govt of India in the performance of duties outside his immediate ones at Bahrein and on the Arab Coast, and he may also be able to assist the Resident occasionally when necessity arises ii 4KS. \/~7 O arises in disposing of Arabic work at the r ' \ ' \ ' Head Quarters of the Residency» I have etc: (Sa) M.

India Office to Foreign Office. India Office, Sir, 7th June 1901. I am directed by Lord George Hamilton to forward, for Lord * ^ ^Lansdowne's information, a copy * No. /2 (Secret), dated 9th May 1901, f i aj . * r ,, ^ with enclosures. 7 of a letter* from the Government of India, on the subject of their relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein. With the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, his Lordship proposes to approve of the action taken by the Govern ment of India in the particular matter now reported. As regards the general question. Lord Lansdowne is aware of the terms of our agree ment with the Sheikh, dated the 22nd of December 1880, and of our recent recognition of Sheikh Harnid as his father's successor, which formed the subject of your letter dated 9th December 1898. The Sublime Porte has been repeatedly informed that the Chief of Bahrein is under the protection of the British Government, as in the )iote verbale delivered by Sir Philip Currie, No. 16, dated 8th February 1896, and it is presumed that, in the correspondence w r ith the American Ambassador ending with your letter dated 18th December 1899 relative to the Missionary Mr. S. M. Zwemer, the same position was taken up. In these circumstances, it would seem that no diplomatic steps need he taken to place our position on a more definite footing as desired by the Viceroy, and that the proper course is that suggested by Sir N. O'Conor in his Despatch, No. 168, dated the 5th of May 1901, namely, to give on our own part a material proof of our authority over the island, as, for instance, by inducing the Sheikh to appoint a British subject Director of the Bahrein Customs This suggestion has been forwarded to the Govern ment ot India, and has been commended to them for favourable consideration. In this connection I am also to notice the fact that, although the Native News Agent at Bahrein has been replaced by a British official, no permanent arrangement has yet been made there by the Governor-General in Council, as will appear from this Office letter dated 27th February 1900, forwarding a report from the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 19, dated 18th January 19JO, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. Lord George Hamilton is inclined to think that when the Government of India are adequately represented at Bahrein, and if the Chief should be induced to appoint a British Director of Customs, a considerable advance will be made in securing the object which the Viceroy desires.

S imla, the 21st April 1904. S ir, We have the honour to address you regarding the affairs of Bahrein and the arrangements for British representation at Manama. The situation is peculiar. The protection of the British Government has converted the island trom a scene of chronic external aggression and intestine feud into a peaceful and flourishing centre of industry and commerce. We have not only secured the stability of the present Chief's rule, hut, at the Sheikh's entreaty and with the approval of His Majesty's Government, we have recognised his son, Ilamed, as^his heir, and have thus practically guaranteed the succession on Sheikh Isa's death. Yet we have never declared a formal protectorate; we have demanded no tribute; and we have abstained from interference in domestic affairs, except at the Sheikh's request. Secure in the gratuitous enjoyment of the benefits thus conferred upon him, the Sheikh has^for^otten the past vicissitudes of the Khalifa family and the exactions and the loss of independence to which his ancestors submitted at the hands of the Wahahi House and of the Imam of Maskat^ during the period immediately precedina* our intervention ; while our moderation seems to have induced the belief in the Chief's mind that his relations with the British Government are of a kind that involve no corresponding obligations on his own part. . The incorrectness of the Sheikh's attitude has been consj)icuously noticeable in connection with the question of his Customs revenues. His Majesty's Government are aware of the existing system whereby the Customs are farmed to Britisli Indian Banias, and of the inadequacy of the income which is obtained undpr this arrangement. So far back as 1898, our Political llesident in the Persian Gulf broached the subject with the Chief, who gave Colonel Meade to understand that he would not renew the Jease which had then about fourteen months to run, without first communicatino- with the Resident. Later in the same year, in pursuance of a proposal approved by your predecessor. Colonel Meade visited Bahrein with the object of inducing the Sheikh to receive a qualified officer to manage his Customs. Despite the previous understanding, however, the lease had in the meanwhile' been extended for a further period of two years; and no action was taken beyond an expression by Colonel Meade of his disapproval of the Sheikh's bad faith, ihree months later the Sheikh, though still indisposed to revise his Customs arrangements, again promised not to enter into any fresh agreement on the expiry of the existing contract in April 1902, without first informing- the Resident. But in January 1900 Colonel Meade reported that the Sheikh had again departed from his engagements, and had prolonged the lease tor a fresh term of two years, without previous intimation. A remons trance was made; and the Chief expressed regret; but nevertheless, when in1901, at the instance of Sir Nicolas O'Conor, it was again suggested that lie should employ a British subject to supervise his Customs, he once more declined to accede to the wishes of His Majesty's Government. In November of the same year, the Sheikh appeared to become more amenable, and declared his intention of assuming the direct management of his Customs on the expiry of the lease then current. Within a fortnight, however, he had renewed the contract for a further period of two years. No further action was taken until, during his recent tour in the Persian bulf. His Excellency the Viceroy spoke seriously about the matter to the Chief, and pointed out to him the necessity of a change in the existing arrangements. The Sheikh asked tor time to consider the matter with his brother and sons; and the Resident was accord ingly instructed to report further after renewed consultation with the Sheikh. In his letter of the 18th February 1904, of which we enclose a copy. Colonel Kemball has recounted the failure of his further endeavours with Sheikh Isa, who steadily declines to revise the arrangements under which his revenues are at present collected. 3. The need for reform is clearly indicated by the figures given in Colonel Kemball's letter. The Chief's present income from his Customs is Es. 1,16,200, while the revenue which may be expected under an efficient system is estimated at Rs. 3,50,000. The practicability of the change is proved by the example of Maskat where, in partial compliance with our wishes, the Sultan has taken the Customs administration'under direct management, and has already reaped considerable benefit from the arrangement. The matter is obviously one to which we cannot remain indilferent. Committed, as we are, to the support of Sheikh Hamed, it is incumbent on us to take measures to ensure that, on his accession, he may find his house in order, and may not be burdened with a heavy legacy of debt accumulated by the improvidence of his predecessor. For this reason we consider that the question is not one which can be allowed to drop, even if it were possible to overlook the Sheikh's repeated breaches of faith and his persistently contumacious attitude with regard to it. In fact, the reform of the Customs administration of Bahrein has become a test case of the nature and degree of the influence which the British Government may reasonably claim to exercise over the ruler of those islands. 4. To coerce the Sheikh would be a simple matter. He possesses no troops or ships, and the towns of Manama and Muharrak, where the Sheikh himself resides, are completely open to attack from the sea. But the adop- tion of forcible measures would be liable to arouse unnecessary suspicion and alarm as to our intentions in the Gulf; and we prefer, therefore, to effect our object by means which, if slower, may, we trust, be not less effective. During the Viceroy's recent visit to the island. His Excellency was impressed with the fact that our Assistant Political Resident at Manama does not carry that weight with the Sheikh which should be expected in the representative of the British Government. That Mr. Gaskin was not entirely suited for the post has been recognised from the outset; we think that Lord George Hamilton was right when he expressed the opinion in 1901 that the appointment was one which should be held by an officer of superior status; and we propose, with the approval of His Majesty's Government, to select an officer of the graded list of our Political Department to take the place of Mr. Gaskin, for whom we hope to be able to provide elsewhere. To emphasise the change we would send a small guard of native infantry as a permanent escort to our new Agent. It has been recognised as desirable that a gun-boat should visit the island frequently during the pearling season to check the piracies which then occur. During the present year it can probably be arranged that the gun-boat shall make a more prolonged stay at Bahrein. It will also be necessary to provide the Assistant Political Agent with a boat of some descrip tion, so that he can at intervals visit Katif and the outlying portions of his charge, and this boat could, perhaps, be utilised for the suppression of piratical outrages in the shallower waters which a British gun-boat cannot reach. In this way we think that the difficult question which has been raised, of allowing the Sheikh to arm and equip a dhow for this purpose, might be satisfactorily met, while an additional proof of our title to police the pearl banks would be secured.r 5 3 1 (V 6. The Sheikh will probably not be slow to recognise the significance of the action which we suggest, and we anticipate that it will not be long belore a suitable officer is able to secure a proper influence over the Sheikh and to find an opportunity of bringing pressure to bear on him in connection with the Customs question or any other matter. Apart from alfairs of domestic interest, the need for a more definite assertion of our position has recently come into greater prominence owing to the establishment of a German trader on the island, and by reason of the growing' interest in this quarter displayed by foreigners of other nationalities. We also contem plate that the officer posted at Bahrein should be invested with Vice- * Consular powers for the Turkish district of EI Hassa, and should be charged /rf ' ' with the superintendence of our commercial interests at Katif rcardTn^ which we have recently addressed you in a separate despatch. r AYe have the honour to be.
