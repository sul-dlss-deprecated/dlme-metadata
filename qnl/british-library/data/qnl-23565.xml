Dear Belgrave, I have just had a letter from the Oollector of Cuetoms in Karachi asking me to discover whether a sailing craft 'Jafari' that is said to have sailed for „atar with 400 bags of sugar actually arrived there or not. The shippers name was ! uhammad and Jasim al i'arzook. I have no doubt that it will be found that it was delivered there and 1 notice that the cargo is described as trans-shipment cargo’’• If this is going to develops into a trade it is going to hit us very hard and I thought you would be interested to hear of it.

Generally speaking the position is this: kuhummad and Jasim si I'erzuk ere the keraohi averts -Per a ^umh°r ^e.^di tre^e^s, of whom A.A.Bassam and S.H.Bassam in Bahrain are the most active in trading on the mainland. For some time past this agent has been asking the B.I.S.F.Coy Ltd., to reduce their rates of freight to^ Bahrain; and as a counter-blast to their refusal, he is now sending up cargo, mostly rice, by native craft, which comes to Bahrain, and tra^oiiips at sea, within the port limits into smaller craft which remove the ce.rgo to the mainland ports, and pay us no duty at all. It is no exaggeration to say that during the past three wee!s pro ably ten thousand bags of ballam rice have been so transhipped ..or the mainland. In regard to sugar, the same remarks apply, with the additional ^irmise that the sugar is re-shipped from TJatar to be smuggled into Persia, by the activities of Eussain Eaama, the Eudir of that port, who is said to be the local leader in this venture. The position may be summed up in my re-iterated demand for the imposition of Customs Duty upon cargo transhipped at sea within the - oort limits. I do not ask for duty on cargo transhipped outside the port limits, as that is ruled by treaty; but my conten tion that cargo transhipped within the port limits should pay a. least two per cent can be maintained by the statements of many local notao^es who have on various occasions talked to me about this position, otp-Mnr that before the re-or^erisrtion 'o + fen**insert permitted within the port limits. I believe too, that I can add that the transhippers would not have any very great objection to paying such duty, as heretofore.

Tor- Sir, The Secretary, Calcutta Marine Insurance Association, Calcutta. &lt; I have the honour to refer to your letter ilo:613.P dated tne 3ord December 1933 regarding craft losses at Persian Gulf Ports. 3. I regret that there should have been delay in replying to your letter,but I was anxious to make certain enquiries on the subject. 3. The following are replies to your specific questions (a) Registration of craft is carried out by the Bahrain Goveraaent,but there is no regulation regarding the amount of cargo which they are permitted to carry. (b) Protests can be lodged before the Political Agent,Bahrain,and {cj there is an Agent of Lloyds at Bahrain,to whom Insurance Companies can address engines in regard to losses. 4. It may,however,assist your Association if I explain that Bahrain has an open hsrbour and that at certain times of the year ^hamals 1 (a northerly wind) are apt to spring up suddenly,so that losses between steamers ana the shore may occur,especially if the goods are lightered in small boats. 5. There is,however,a Landing Company,a branch of the Persian Gulf Lighterage Company ( a subsidiary Company ( 2 )of the British India Steam Nrvigation Company Limited;,who carry out the lighterage of the British India Steam Navigation Company T s steamers and also of certain other Lines. I think that your Association may safely assume that,in the case of Ships lightered by this Company,every reasonable precaution is taken to ensure the safe carriage of the gooas. The Com any have large lightering boats, trained men ana supply paulins for the protection of goons. 6. I have discussed your enquiry with Lldyas agent at Bahrain and understand that he had occasion to comment adversely on the landing arrangements in connection with a certain independent steamer,not belonging to the Lines which call regularly at Bahrain,in August 1932. It seems • possible that this case may have given rise,in part,to your en L uiry,ana it seems likely that such vessels would find it difficult to arrange for as good landing facilities as those provided by the Landing Company for the lines which they serve. V. In conclusion,! would add that when protests are registered in the Agency,the Political Agent would naturally consider whether the story bore the general stamp of truth,having regard,for example,to the state of the weather at the time,but he is not m a position to guarantee the accuracy of a protest.

The Collector of customs who collects the dues payable to the Shaikh is an Arab. xhe Calcutta insurance Association is doubtless aware that foreigners are only allowed to land on the irucial Coast after specific sanction of the Shaikh has oeen obtained. As you will doubtless appreciate, the risk of damage to cargo while in transit from ship to shore at ports such as Dubai is boupd to be considerable wwing to the very exposed nature of the roadstead and the rapidity with which severe storms arise in the Persian uulf. xours faithfully ihe Mesopotamia Persian Corporation Ltd.

During the year 1355, i.e. from 24th March 1936 to 12th March 1937, this port was visited by fifty-seven native craft from India, of which 45 brought cargo, and 12 came here in ballast. These latter were for dry dates, shipped usually from Katif; but if the quantities were not available, the craft would proceed on to Basra for the same commodity, which would most probably be taken back to Karachi.

The file’s principal correspondents are: the Collector (and Assistant Collector) of Customs at Karachi; the Political Agent at Bahrain (Captain Charles Geoffrey Prior, Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch, and staff from the Agency’s Vernacular Office); the Director of Customs at Bahrain (Claud Cranbrook Lewis DeGrenier); the Ruler of Qatar (Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī).Much of the correspondence is routine, and follows an established pattern: 1) enquiries from the Assistant Collector of Customs to the Political Agency at Bahrain after specific vessels, listing the contents of their cargo and requesting confirmation of their arrival at port and the landing of their cargo; 2) letters from Political Agency staff, in English and in Arabic, forwarding enquiries about inbound vessels to the Director of Customs at Bahrain (for vessels headed to Bahrain), the Ruler of Qatar (for vessels headed to Qatar) or the Residency Agent at Sharjah (for vessels headed to the ports of the Trucial Coast); 3) replies from the Director of Customs at Bahrain, the Ruler of Qatar, and the Residency Agent at Sharjah, either confirming the arrival of vessels and the landing of their cargo, or writing that the vessel has not yet arrived in port; and 4) letters from the Political Agency back to the Collector of Customs at Karachi, replying to the original enquiry, occasionally making reference to enclosing landing certificates, which are accepted as proof of the landing of the cargo. Some letters from the Assistant Collector of Customs at Karachi to the Political Agent at Bahrain, dated 1936 and later, make reference to enclosed export manifests, and enquiries about the authenticity of their endorsements.In addition to the routine correspondence, the file also includes:correspondence between the Political Agent at Bahrain and the Director of Customs at Bahrain, concerning the shipment of goods to Bahrain via Qatar as transhipment cargo (ff 12-15);correspondence between the Political Agent at Bahrain and the Secretary of the Calcutta Marine Insurance Association, relating to loss of vessels at Persian Gulf ports, and regulations at Dubai for registration of vessels (f 28, ff 30-31, ff 46-50).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs and Port Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Sind, Collector of Customs, Karachi</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Maritime legislation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Transshipment</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Customs duty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00006e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
