Note by Sir O. St. John. Two such authorities as Sir Henry Rawlinson and Mr. Walter Baring holding sufch different views as regards the Karun route, I trust T may not be considered presumptuous in differing from both. The first point is the use and practicability of opening the Karun river to steam navigation from the sea to Shuster by removing or turning the natural dam of rocks at Ahwaz. The most material evidence as to the practicability tit c&lt; ^ l ^ ne ^ ^ report by Captain Wells, B.E., who visited Ahwaz with Mr. Haring. From this report, and the careful detailed drawing attached to it, 1 am led to the conclusion, in which it would appear Captain Wells j?!l cur 1 s * both Sh* Henry Rawlinson and Mr. Baring over-estimate the difficulty of opening a navigable channel. The total length of the rapids is no more than one mile, and the fall in the length 8 to 10 feet only. Captain Wells considers that it would be easier and cheaper to dig a canal from a point above to a point below the rapids, and he gives the length of such a canal at 2,350 yards, with a maximum depth of 35 feet below the present level of the soil. This does not seem a very formidable undertaking, if the rock, as 1 understand, lie soft sandstone; and locks of sufficient capacity for small river steamers, say 100 feet by 20 (two would be required), are not expensive works. Moreover, I am not at all satisfied that it would not be easiei and cheaper to make a navigable channel in the river itself; for it seems to me that the assumption, that the removal of so much of the natural weiis of rock as to make navigation possible would materially lower the level of the water above, is rather a hasty one. However, 1 would suggest that Captain Wells’s plan and report be submitted to a competent hydraulic engineer for an opinion and rough estimate of the probable expense of making the present channel navigable for small river steamers, or of di^^ino- a new one. This would clear the way for the second point in dispute, which is the feasibility of opening a practicable commercial route between Shuster and Isfahan or Tehran, supposing the Karun opened to navigation as far as the first-named town. ^ Both Sir Henry Rawlinson and Mr. Baring, looking to the establishment of a road for wheeled traffic, consider the direct route over the hills to Isfahan to be impracticable. Mr. Baring advocates one or other of the roads through Khoremabad to Tehran, while Sir Henry Rawlinson considers even these as bad or as long as the present highway from Bushire through Shiraz, to the improvement of which, so as to fit it for wheeled traffic, he would devote all available energy. Now I venture to doubt the use of spending money in making carriage roads in a country like Persia, for which, I think, it can be shown that there is no useful via media between a light railway and a mule path. Parts of t&gt;pain and the whole west coast of South America are examples in point. Carts were latterly largely used in Southern Afghanistan for military transport; but as regards original outlay, time taken in trans port, and proportion of forage and food consumed per ton conveyed, they were less economical than camels. In fact, it was only the absolute impossibility of obtaining camels that necessitated the use of carts. I know the roads irom Bushire to Shiraz well, ami I should estimate the cost of making a good cart-road by any of them at no less than 1,000/. a mile, or nearly 200,000/. for the whole distance, and, even supposing the * These are not included in the file, but 1 have been allowed to see them in the Indo-European Telegraph office, by Colonel Champain.cart-road made, where are the carts, drivers, bullocks, or horses to come from ? In India, where cart-roads have been made penetrating a few miles into the mountains, the adjacent plains furnish an inexhaustible supply 0 f rolling stock, hut in Persia all would have to he created just as much as that for a railway. The longest mountain cart-road in India is, I believe, that to Simla, 57 miles in length, but even on this camels do as much work as carts. The introduction of wheeled traffic for commercial purposes into Southern Persia would be as purely artificial as that of railways. The only use that a metalled road of low gradients from Bushire to Shiraz would be put to would be to serve as foundation for a light railway, which might as well be made at once. Setting aside these roads for wheeled traffic, the question of opening trade routes from Shuster to the interior takes a different aspect. It is astonishing how simply and inexpensively the most steep and rugged path can be made not only practicable but easy for mules and camels. Mr. Baring compares the road between Shuster and Isfahan to the teeth of a saw. That between Bushire and Shiraz is more like a staircase, though it has a certain amount of steep descents as well as ascents. It is these abrupt declivities that are such formidable obstacles to mule and camel carriage, gentle slopes affect them not at all, or at least infinitesimally. Comparing Mr. Baring’s and Captain Well's reports on the Shuster-Isfahan road with my own knowledge of the Bushire-Shiraz road, I find the sum of steep abrupt ascents to be 12,000 feet in the one case, and 9,000 in the other, as follows :— Shuster-Isfahan Road. Feet. Mai-Amir to Karun - - - 900 Rudbar to Hillisat - - - 3,600 Hillisat to Dopulan - - - 3,000 Dopulan to Ardell - - - - 1,500 Ardell to Chaher Mabel - . . 3,000 12,000 Bushire-Shiraz Road. To Konartukhteh - - - 2,000 „ Kamaraj - - - - 1,000 ,, Kazerun - . - - 500 „ crest of Pirizan pass - - - 1,500 ,, Sinali Safid - - - - 1,000 9,000 The distance saved by the Shuster road to Isfahan is 200 miles, against which has only to be placed the 3,000 extra feet to which the roads have to be lifted. Under these circumstances there would, no doubt, be a con siderable saving in the transport of goods by opening a mule path from Shuster to Isfahan, and an equal or larger gain by doing the same through Khoremabad to Tehran. Much stress is laid by Sir Henry RawTinson on the unsettled and uninhabited condition of parts of the country to be traversed by these new routes, and this is, no doubt, a most formidable obstacle, though not, I believe, an insurmountable one. Since I went to Persia, nineteen years ago, the condition of the country as regards safety of travelling and communications generally has been steadily improving, in spite of the serious check caused by the famine. The capacity for mischief of the wandering tribes is yearly lessening, and I agree with Mr. Baring that the Zhil-i-Sultan, to whom the Shah has confided the government of all southern Persia, is well able to open and keep open the roads from Shuster to the interior if he chooses to do so; while the present uninhabited con dition of parts of the routes would not prove a more insurmountable difficulty than it has elsewhere, £.&lt; 7 ., on the Shiraz-Isfahan roads, from Imamzadeh Ismail to Yezdikhest, and from Meshed-i-Surmek. On the other hand, I greatly doubt whether any thing will induce the Shah’s Government to consent to the opening of the Karun to navigation.
