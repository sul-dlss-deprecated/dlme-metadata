Your letter dated 31st May has reached me only to-day and as I am not sure whether you will he at Bahrain or in Baluchistan, I am addressing this letter to both places. I have asked our Kasauli office to send you a copy of an article on 'hatchery** both to your Bahrein and Baluchistan addresses. This refers to 'Q-ambusia' fish but the contents should apply to the local fish just the same. In the case of Gambusia, however, we do not need to feed them at all but it is possible that local fish may require additional feeding of the type usually given to goldfish. I do not think you will get value for your money, unless you supplement your 'fish control scheme ' by an efficient drainage system for the date-palms groves andXtown sullage and I know of no place which is so well fitted for vertical drainage. I wish that aspect could be explored and applied for it will be the cheapest in the long run. Gan you manage to send someone to be trained in malariology next year? If so, the application should (P.T.O.)V reach hers before December 15th. I honestly think that to be a very important step, as once yonr/Local doctors get keen on it, the control will follow automatically. It is such a localized problem that, given the usual degree of persistence and energy, the island should be made into a ?t mosquito-free enclave t? in 2 or 3 years at a very moderate cost. I may here remark that it is not often that I can make such an assertion at any rate, not in 90,0 of the places I have studied.

The Secretary, Moharraq municipality. Syed Ahmed bin Sayed Alawi, Superintendent of Haj Abdul Aziz al Ali. Mr Salim al Arayedh, Headmaster, Manama Boys School. Other members of the committee were unavoidably Shia Wakf Department absent?Q) Vo &lt;0/^ v ~ -V The meeting opened with a brief statement by the Politi cal Agent of the need for anti-malarial measures in Bahrain* It was explained that the malaria expert from India had found a very high percentage of malaria infection in Bahrain, partic ularly in Manama and that statistics taken in the schools showed as much as 60^ prevalence • This must obviously have a serious effect on the physique and well being of the whole population. The expert stated that it should be possible to eradicate malaria altogether in these islands so it was clearly necessary to take energetic steps to that end, on the lines which he had suggested in his report. It would, however, be necessary for everyone, rich and poor, to coroperate if the effect was to be successful. 2. Prom every point of view it seemed necessary to begin operations in Manama. Malaria is carried by a particular type of mosquitoe and that mosquitoe breeds chiefly in shallow wells in compounds, in stagnant water in swamps, and in irrigation ditches and drains in the gardens in and around the municipal area. The action to be taken in regard to these three types of breeding places was then discussed. 3. Shallow wells in compounds, (galeeb). (a) Practically every house and barasti in Manama has one of these wells, the water is used for bathing and washing clothes and cooking utensils, etc. The malaria expert has stated definitly that for the prevention of malaria all these shallow wells must be filled in. (It was decided at this stage that the expert’s detailed recommendations both for temporary and permanent control, should be translated into Arabic for the use of members of thhecommittee, Baladiya^ and Schools). (b) It was recognised that if these shallow wells were to be elimated an alternative water supply must be provided. This could be done by piping water from existing artesian wells (in the municipal limits) to each section or district of the- 2 - of the municipal area and the people would thus be able to draw water from public hydrants. It might be necessary to invite the co-operation of owners of private artesian wells by permitting part of the flow of their wells to be used for the town water supply scheme. It was recommended that the State Engineer,should at onee work out the details of such a scheme, providing for the linking up primarily of public wells and secondly, so far as necessary, of private wells by laying of pipes, location of pumps stand pipes etc. Meanwhile it was regarded of primary importance that the indiscriminate drilling of artesian wells (which is causing a general reduction in the le#el of artesian water in all parts of Bahrain) should cease; and in particular no new wells should be permitted in municipal areas till a public water supply had been assured. (c) It was recognised that the planning and execution of such a scheme would take at least a year and possibly two years during which time possibly the house wells could not be filled in. Meanwhile steps must be taken to control the breeding of mosquitoes in shallow wells. The expert has recommended for this purpose the use of small fish which eat mosquitoes. The/tifcare many thousands of these fish in the springs and water channels in Bahrain and arrangements will be made to breed them. These fish should be put into the shallow wells by the malaria staff (to be recruited) of the Medical Department and it is essential that the public should allow this staff access to compounds both to put the fish in the wells and inspect them at intervals. (d) The hatchery should be constructed in the Manama Municipal garden (the Municipal Secretary being responsible for it) and it was recommended that the State imedical Officer should have his plans ready for the collection of fish from other sources also and for their distribution shortly before the Autumn malaria season. /-3- (e) The State Medical Officer asked that large sc&amp;le maps should be prepared of Manama Municipal area and the pre peripheral area of about a mile in depth. These maps should show all wells and stagnant pools, irrigation channels and drains and should be contoured for levels. 4. Draining of Stagnant V,ater. The Committee were informed that attempts were being made to deal with swamps by means of vertical drainage,i.e. by drilling holes from 50-70 feet deep, in the hope that the water will drain into layers of sand. This tas failed in one place but appears to be successful in another swamp, south-east of Manama. Pending further information on this experiment more elaborate and expensive schemes need not at present be considered. 5. Irrigation ditches and drains in gardens. These are prolific sources of mosquitoe breeding, due partly to over irrigation and partly to the failure of landlords and tenaits to keep their ditches clean, ill owners should be informed that they are responsible for k keeping their ditches clean, in good condition and properly graded, that their gardens will be inspected by the officials of the Medical department and that if they are found not to have carried out their responsibilities the work will be done under government supervision and the landlords will be charged heavy rates, as much as ten times the actual cest. 6. The necessity for effective propaganda was discussed and agreed upon. This should include newspaper article, discussions at Baladiya meetings, magic lantern, lectures in Schools and strenuous efforts by the Arabic speaking members of the committee to impress upon their fellow-citiaaBS zens the dangers of the situation and the need for action and co-operation by all classes. With this object in view it was decided that the committee should be enlarged by the addition of about 20 gentlemen of goodwill and good standing in Manama.U -4- in Manamac A small sub committee can then be formed of those who are actually responsible for carrying out the work and for reporting results at meetings of the general committeeo 7* Funds for expenditure on malaria control will be provided by a special grant under 'Public Health' in the Budget of the Bahrain Government, 8. It was considered that the decisions reached so far represented an adequate programme of work for the immediate future and that further plans should be considered at a later meeting.No: isj^-2 /7.

Red Cross are the only people who do so. I made enquiries from the Secretary who was unfortunately unwilling to let the film go out of India. He said he had had lots of difficulties with the customs people over it when/sent tt out previously. You may however succeed m persuading him by meeting his points. His address is.— 'Secretary Indian Red Cross Society, Talkatora Road, New Delhi. 3 # I am sending you a number of pamphlets which I have selected out of those in use in the various Provinces here. I have no duplicate copies of these and would be grateful if you could return them to me after use. 4 . i think it was rather clever of the Bahrein Govern ment to appoint you as the Chairmanl After all you stirred them up a whole lot. I will be very pleased indeed to helpD*C. Ho. Z/28 Ziarat f the 16th August 1939. I think I told you before I left Bahrain that I had written to Afridi to ask if he could send ue any cinema films t lantern slides or literature in regard to malaria control. I have now had a letter from o say that the Red Cross people in India have a malaria film but that they ere very unwilling to let it go out of India owing to difficulties with the Customs. I am prepared to try to fix this up with the Customs people in Karachi| but I imagine there will be some charges and obviously I cannot commit the Bahrain Government to these without your approval. Would you let me know if you would like to have this film for a week or two if T can get it ? It will orobably be rather Indian in nature but may be useful in Bahrain also. Lantern slides seem to have bean abandoned nowadays. 2. I enclose herewith the pamphlets which Afridi has sent me, and which are used in the various provinces in India. They are not all suitable by any means for use in Bahrain, but I have marked in blue pencil those parts which T think might be helpful to ua. The health dialogue and the lectures on malaria could I think be used almost bodily. I would suggest that Davenport Jones A Dalrymple Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, BahrainJones might go through this literature and advise which parts seem to be suitable f and that the Manama Head Master or some one Arabic. Four or five separate pamphlets might be rehashed out of these pamphlets and distributed pretty widely; the lectures might be distributed through the Baladiyahs: and \ perhaps the Boy Scouts could put on a play made out of the health dialogue. \ 3. Do you think that it would be possible to make more If they could be taught what the mosquito larvae look like f they might become valuable assistants to the mosquito-searching squad. 4. Afridi wants these pamphlets back as he has no spare copiesi so could 1 have them again when J got back to Bahrein ? of that sort might then set about making translations into use of the Boy Scouts in Bahrain for this malaria campaign ? Yours sincerely fr-~\ D. 0. No. Dear Weightman, With reference to your D.0.No.^/9 dated the 8th August 1939 about the work of the malaria Committee, the following progress has been made;- 1. Steele is experimenting in a water scheme. He has linked several wells together and is now putting dov/n pipes to some points in the centre of the town^where previously there was no water supply. These points are to be fed from the combined supply of the four wells. It is too soon to say whether the scheme will be success but if it works it can be adapted in other parts of the town and will enable us to provide water points in neighbourhoods which are not served by wells. 2. The Hatchery was completed some time ago and is full of fish. 3. Vertical drainage has, for the time being, been abandoned. It was only partly successful in one place. 4. ^ Kozaibi, Mansoor al Arayth, Shaikh Ali bin Ahalifah bin Daij and Syed Hashim have been invited to become members of the Committee. 5. The map is not ready yet. Davenport Jones has been appointed as Secre tary of the Committee. The drain from Palace garden to the sea is almost complete and appears to be very effective.

Memorandum: - Anti-Malarial Campaign Further to my notes of 20th July,1939 (copy attached, the work of connecting up the first group of wells is proceeding, three wells having been inter connected to date. Every effort is being made to complete this first section of the general scheme as soon as possible. On completion of the new v/ashing and drinking places, it is assumed that the Government will take the necessary steps to close all house and other surface wells in the area (A B C D). The city plan accompanying these notes shows the area under discussion, and the location of all wells within the Municipal.boundary. The plan (1926) is somewhat old, but substantially correct as far as the older portion of the city is concerned. After seeing the result of the first stage of the scheme we shall be better able to detail a comp rehensive Municipal water and drainage system with the usual reservoirs, pumps, etc. I should like to remark that, at present at all events, there is more water available from existing wells than is required to r the normal requirements of the population of Manama h G ity, leaving a good supply for other purposes, such as watering gardens, roads, feeding ice plants, etc. P.T.O.Enc1...••• GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN.

A test hole was sunk to a depth of 80 feet on the edge of a large stagnant pool lying to the south of the American Mission in Manamah. The result at first seemed favourable, as the pool commenced to drain at the rate of approximately 2” per day, but gradually slowed up, ceasing altogether in approximately 15 days. The bore has been kept clean, but the flow has not re-commenced. Three more test holes were sunk, round the pool, but without success, water being encountered at approximately 30 feet, which commenced to flow upwards. A considerable quantity of water, however, was drained off during the fifteen days mention^ the surface of the pool being lowered by approximately I«6' - representing, say, lOOpOCTgallons of water. Two test-wholes were also sunk (one on each side) at the pool near the D.F.Station of Messrs. Gable &amp; Wireless Limited, but without result, v/ater being encountered at 50 and 75 feet. The land surrounding this pool is water logged to a depth of I«6' - 2*0” below ground level due to seepage from surrounding gardens, etc. State Engineer, Government of L a hrain. LUDated: 20th July, 193S BAHRAIN. 2nd J/Thani,135£ As a trial measure I suggest linking up wells Nos.13,29,10 &amp; 9. From observation taken,these four wells,between them,produce approximately 23000 gallons per hour,i.e.23,000 x 24 = 552,000 gallons per day. Assuming that 10,000 persons live in the section of the town bounded by a square formed on A B C D in the city plan, then 552,000 f 10,000 * 55 gallons per head per day. As half of this amount would be sufficient, there will still be a surplus of water for other Municipal purposes. Three new washing places could be arranged at suitable points within the section A 3 C D and fitted with, say,four S' taps. Arrangements could be made to cut off the supply between certain hours if this was thought desireable. Drainage For drainage purposes soakage pits would have to be used,and a drainage system installed later,if the scheme is found workable. Approximate Cost:- To connect the wells as stated, approximately 2800 feet of G.I. pipes 2' and 1' would be required, which would cost approximately Rs.2,500/-/- (for material only), or with labour, sundry valves,etc., approximately Rs.3,500/-/- The construction of the additional washing places would also be necessary.

With reference to your letter No. 22/21/39/2-R. dated the 9th August 1959, I have the honour to state that I do not consider it advisably to have jeioadars recruited in India. They will be employed chiefly on supervising the anti-larval work of coolies for whicn no special training is necessary. Indeed a local ram who knows the language would be able to get better work out of the coolies and secure more co-operation from the inhabitants than one importeu from India. (i) With regard to the supervisor, none exists on the stafi of tne Malaria Institute of India, those workin^ in the Anti-malaria Operations in Delhi being the employees of the municipalities. I ooubt if the local bodies would release them, nor is the deputation allowance, viz. 20^i a sufficient inducement for an individual to risk the loss oi a permanent appointment. My suggestion, therefore, is that a good jemadar in the Delhi Anti-malaria Operations shouldjbe taken in hantjfand instructed into the duties of a supervisor. I have one such person in view wnose work for the past four years has been known t |me personally. With a little training I considei that he will oe capable of performing the duties of a supervis r efficiently. He is at present employea as a temporary jemadar in the Notified Area, Civil Lines, and his name and address is as follows:- Lehrasab Khan, care of Mohd. Sadiq Sowar, Barrack No. 2, police Lines, % Delhi,or tiirou^h thia office. He ia unniarried and ia prepared to accept a starting aalary of Ks.50/- p.m. (ii) The inaect coilectora on the staff of the Malaria Institute of India are posted either at Bazpur or at Oriaaa except one who ia assisting in the iSntomological research in Delhi. I do not think it will|be possibly to depute any of them, without causing serious disturbance to the course of inquiries. There is, however, a batch of unpaiu apprentice inaect collectors who will complete their course of training during the next fortnight, and I surest that recruitment be made from amongst them. I have made inquiries and they are willing .to proceed to Bahrein on Rb. 40/- per month as their starting pay. At present I am unably to give tneir names as their instruction has not gone on sufficiently to allow of a selection. (iii) It is understood that apart from the pay these individuals will be eligible to receive all expenses on transportation f^ora Delhi to Bahrain and back. 2. It is requested that the decision regarding the ©hgagement of the supervisor be communicated to me as early as possible as it will be ncesaary to arrange for an intensive training for him for at least a fortnight prior to his departure to Bahrain.Telegram From To Copy by post to - No. GTC Political, Bahrain.

To consider the report of the S.M.O. 4. To decide the future programme of work. 5. To form sub-committees to control the progress of Anti-Malaria work, and to disseminate propoganda. To arrange regular meetings. 6 . To consider provision of funds, equipment and staff for Anti-malaria work. 7. To discuss any other business. The President decided that minutes of the meetings shall be printed in Arabic and English and sent to members of the committee after each meeting.- 2 - Th 0 State Engineer then gave his report with regard to the progress made with the linking up of artesian wells in the municipal area. (1) The State Engineer said that, in connection with the proposed grouping of artesian wells in Manama city, he had, -^s o. trial measure, linked up four wells in the central part of the town near the bazaar area, and he demonstrated to the committee the exact area on a map of the town. It now remained to conscruci the new washing and drinking places at suitable points, and then to fill in all domestic wells in the area served. After seeing the results of the first part of the scheme the committee would be in a better position to detail a comprehensive municipal water and drainage system with the usual reservoirs t pumps etc., lie widhed to remark that at present at all events, there is more water available from existing wells than is required for the normal demands of the population of Uanama City, leaving a good supply for other purposes such as watering gardens, roads, feeding ice plants etc. With regard to the area, under consideration, observations had indicated that the four wells between them produce approx : 23,000 gallons per hour i.e. 23,000 x 24 - 552,000 gallons per day; this was at least twice as much as was required by the population of that area. For drainage purposes soaking pits would have to be used, and a drainage system installed later, if the scheme is found workable. The president then asked the committee to decide upon the maximum distance which should separate any dwelling house in Manama from the nearest source of water supply when the domestic wells were filled in. After some deliberation the committee decided that no dwelling should be more than 600 feet from a source of supply. It was further recommended by the committee that each terminal should supply wash-houses with 6 taps for either sex. It was recommended thfet arrangements-3- should be made to supply private houses, when required, with a direct supply which should be under municipal control and meterage : the work of installation to be carried out by the Municipality and charged to the landlord. (2) The State Engineer then described the experiments which had been carried in order to test the efficacy of vertical drainage in the municipal area. He said that attempts ut vertical drainage etc., have been made, with a measure of success. A test hole was sunk to a depth of 80 feet on the edge of a large stagnant pool lying to the south of the American Mission in Manamah. The result at first seemed favourable, as the pool commenced to drain at the rate of approximately 2 M per day, but gradually slowed up, ceasing altogether in approximately 15 days. The bore has been kept clean, but the flow has not recommenced. Three more test holes were sunk, round the pool, but without success, water being encountered at approximately 50 ft., which commenced to flow upwards. A considerable quantity of water, however, was drained off during the fifteen days mentioned, the surface of the pool being lowered by approximately l 1 6'- representing, say 100,000 gallons of water. Two test holes were also sunk (one on each side) at the pool near the D.F. Station of Messrs. Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd., but without result, water being encountered at 50 and 75 feet. The land surrounding this pool is water logged to a depth of 1* 6' - 2 1 C n below ground level due to seepage from surrounding gardens, etc. The State Medical Officer reported that, with regard to the plan to introduce top - feeding fish Into the shallow domestic wells in the town, an experiment, which had been carried out to test the possibility of this measure had been fairly successful 2 fish had been introduced into the wells of twenty houses two months previously, and up to the day of the meeting were to be seen in 17 of these wells ; they appeared to have died in 3 wells.!• The ComniitteQ agreed that the work of filling all the domestic wells in the town should be carried out without delay ; a hatchery in the Municipal gardens haring been constructed, to facilitate the work* The committee decided to appoint a member to supervise the work. 2. The State Medical Officer reported that breeding of mosciuitoes in swamps around the municipal continued and urged that as attempts at vertical drainage had failed # immediate nearures should be taken to fill in the large swamps, particularly that one lying near the new wireless station and the swamp south of the Mission hospital : and that the more vigorous distribution of oil to other swamp areas should be proceeded with. These measures were approved by the committee. 3# Tho State Medical Officer proposed that an anti-larval nnuad should be organised to start operations in the gardens in the periphery of Manama. The duties of this squad were to clear drains and irrigation - channels of weed etc., and to distribute Paris - green mixture in all places where breeding is talcing place ; they would also carry out any other necessary work. The owners of gardens were to be asked to co-operate in this work which would at first be performed free : later on, they would themselves be made reponaible for the work, under penalty. No news was, at present, availabel concerning the trained anti-malaria staff, as recommended in Major Afridi’s report^ Appendix III , whose services had been requested from the Government of India, but it was hoped that they might be avsd available to supervise the work of the anti-larval squad later in the season. The formation of aub~committees to deal with various aspects of the work was then considered, und three sub-coimarttees were formed as follows sGOVERNMENT OF BAHRAIN. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT.

Out of this amount it was proposed that a motor pick-up should be acquired to facilitate the v/ork, both in the town and in the gardens. It was not considered advisable to purchase a new Vehicle because the prices of new cars has risen sharply in response to a rumour df political disturb ance in Europe : The Adviser however considered it possible that an used vehicle might be released from the Government transport service and the cost of this vehicle debited to the Anti- malaria fund. Any residue would be devoted to the travelling expenses of Indian staff, propaganda and incidental expenses. (4) Filling - in Swamps in Manama Lunicipal : It was considered by the committee that the cost of filling-in or otherwise permanently eradicating swamps should be borne by the municipal funds, because this work v/as in many ways beneficial to the iu municipal/apart from that immediately under consideration. rs moreover the Secretary of the Municipality disclosed that 'j for several jears the municipal/had received large grants from 's. the Government for this purpose. &amp; 1,000 had been granted for 1558 of which approximately F* 500 was still available. An estimate of 1500 had been made to cover the cost of rendering the large pool by the new Wireless station innocuous by building a wall around it, (this being a more economic procedure than filling in ) and other sums would be required for dealing with other swamps. To expedite this v/ork which the committee3 iff 'W0*?’' regarded as of paramount importance, it was suggested that the municipality should devote towards it, funds which they had put by for the erection of a municipal hospital. Such a hospital is no longer required, because the Government is now building the State hospital in the town of anarna itself. A sum of no less than h6,000 would thus be released for this and similar work. The Secretary of the ’ anama unicipality agreed to put forward this suggestion to the 'anama municipality indidating to them that the money would be spent only on work of permanent benefit to the mimicipaltiy not only from the anti-malaria point of view but from other aspects both practical and aesthetic. The Adviser stated that he would render his support to this very reasonable project and would use his influence with members of the municipal*^ to secure its adoption. The State kedical Officer said that the work of stocking wells with fish, and the organisation of an anti-larval squad would be proceeded with immediately and the meeting was then terminated.•v GTC Telegram OTC From Political, Bahrain To - Public Health Commissioner, Government of India, New Delhi.

R.A.F. ground near Busaitin was inspected by the Medical Officer and Shaikh Abdulla bin Isq and the anti-malaria Supervisor on Wednesday 10th January 1940. It was found that heavy larval breeding occurred on the wet R.A.F. ground. The water comes from a leak age in the Artesian well. Could this water be controlled? It will also be necessary to drain off the surface water by constructing a drain and later/als from it beginning a hundred yards from the well and joining Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa’s drains down to the sea.

The difficulty is that no stocte are at present available and Such stocks as are in the country have been appropriated by the Army Department. We have, however, instituted enquiries all round and have succeeded in unearthing a small lot in Lahore. I do not know what the cost is likely to be but I expect it villi be 3C-5C% above the pre-war prices. If I get °a hold of it for you I will send you a wire asking for your approval to clinch the bargain on your behalf. I would seriously advise you to lay by a stock sufficient for at least two years, say 8 to 10 cwt., in case the position becomes worse than it is to-day. As far as our own supply is concerned, we luckily have enough for two years and have not therefore been obliged to rush around for more just yet. I am so sorry to hear of the failure of verticle drain age. Still, with temporary antilarval measures and filling of swamps etc. I feel confident you will ultimately succeed.

Name and date Subject. otatement read at meeting Anti-malaria measures, of landowners of gardens in mile radius of Muni cipal boundary on 9th March 1940. Reference to previous correspondence : s.z.Statement read at meeting of landowners of gardens in mile radius of Municipal boundry on 9th March 1940. The object ox this meeting is to inform the owners of gardens and cultivation?near the town what is being don© by the Government to prevent malaria and also to aak the owners of gardens to assist in the work which is being done. As you are aware malaria is more common than any other desense in Bahrain and almost every person who lives in Bahrain has been ill with malaria either ocoa*&gt; si&gt;nally or frequently. Many people do not know that the illness is malaria, they call it'homa'- swlehona or waham and they do not consider what is the cause of the illness. Some people say it is an illness which comes in certain seasons or in certain places in iiahrain during certain seasons, but the cause of malaria and the spreading of malaria is mosquitoes. Mosquitoes breed in water especially in stagnant water and the gardens around Manama are full of stagnant water where mosquitoes are breeding daily. As long as this stagnant water remains mosquitoes will breed and malaria will continue and the health of the people of Bahrain will be bad. lor a long time the Government has been working, against malaria, fhe first step was to bring an expert doctor from India to examine conditions in Bahrain. He visited Bahrain twice and found much illness and many mosquitoes. He made a long report advising the Government about measures to prevent mosquitoes and, therefore^ malaria. A committee was formed and three Indians were brought from the Government department in India which is always working against malaria. These men with gangs of fifty or*-V or sixty coolies have been working here for about six* months. They have worked in the town and in all gardens within one mile of the Biladya boundary* In the town they have inspected every house and compound, in the last two months £5,000 inspections were made* They have put fish in every well In every house. They fish eat the mosquito© eggs and prevent breeding. They have cleaned drains and made drains to carry off stagnant water and they have put oil on water where mosquitoes are breeding. But all this work in the town Is useless if mosquitoes breed in the gardens because mosquitoes fly a long distance. The work which has been done in the gardens consists % of spreading oil on stagnant water and dogging drains to carry away stagnant water Into flowing channels and cleaning the edges of channels. All this makes it difficult for the mosquitoes to breed. It is in this work that the Government wishes help from the landlords. The Government is spending much money on labour for draining off stagnant water and spreading oil on ponds. 3ome landlords have helped by providing labourers to work with the Govermlent labourers, in their own gardens. This is a great help and we hope that all landlords will lend the labourers in their gardens for a day or two when the drains in their gardens are being cleaned by the Government. This last matter is more important than every thing else. The Government wishes to Clean and drain all the gardens where mosquitoes are breeding, with the help of the owners, but when this has been done, once, the owners will be personally responsible for keeping their gardens clean and free from mosquito© breeding places in the future. Malaria is injurious to all people who suffer from it. Malaria is caused by mosquitoes. Mosquitoes can be preventedby preventing any stagnant vrater. People wbo do not taxe steps to prevent mosquitoes breeding in their iiou&amp;es or in their gardens are (musing their neigh bours to become ill and are causing jAst as much injury to their neighbours as though they beat them with a stick and both these injuries should be oonsi- aor^a as criminal. We request your help and your co operation in preventing breeding of mosquitoes in your gardens.Minutes of executive Committee meeting held on 4th March 1940. The following members were present r.

'To The meeting was called fer discuss the following agenda To reconsider the decision to close house wells within 600 feet from 6 Artesian wells in Manama, in view of a future water suddIv scheme reducing the radius of 600 feet to This new scheme was explained^and was put forward as a suggestion to overcome the original 600 feet well area difficulties. It was found that under the old scheme iiany people would have to go for water up to a 850 foot radius in that circle area, instead of 600 feet. This was causing much dissatisfaction. The meeting agreed that the amendment to reduce this area of water supply for 600 feet to 200 would be good. Th. population of Manama was then approximately estimated at 35 to 40 thousand. About 4,500 houses are in this town, and • ; is estimate /as based on a average number of inmates of 8 per house. It was then proposed and agreed on,to ask the State Engineer to prepare a water and drainage scheme, and to estimate the average consumption of water per head per 24 hours for thehot weather. It was thought that 15 gallonswould he a probable estimate, and even then 70^ of the water would run to waste* It was also decided to face the difficulties of such a scheme such as the upheaval of land and removal of barastis to facilitate straight drainage. Meanwhile it was agreed that the houses of those people within 200 feet of the six main wells in Manama, should be ordered to close their shallow wells within a month, and the order to be issued immediately* RKBStfEMZ —Secretary, Anti Malaria Committee/V/ s PROPOST® MTOICIPAL WATER SUPPLY b to'. v or W'i **# *■ r^,:. t£» V-- I**#®'’ *' Prelininary Schene I suggest that the l^unloipal Garden in i&amp;nawh be utilised as a site for the puraplag station and overhand storage tank* The garden in question is centrally situated and the land is free from any restrictions.

Quotations are being obtained for (a) a pressed steel sectional tank, mounted on a steel framework (b) a concrete tank mounted on reinforced concrete pillars. The tank would be covered in by maima of light plates and the usual wood (ventilated cover placed over the whole* 3. fl jriS r :- Mains to radiate from the tank controls as follows:- North, to Eastern Jume l.osque East, to sea near Dhawadi Mosque South, to Shaikh Esa hoad West, to point near Husainl iiosque at cross road of liani and Sh&amp;kh Homed Hoads. These would be 'trunk' mains (say 6') quartering the town area, and acting as main juipply pipes. At intervals of say 800 feet, nib-mains (say 3') would be run as shov/n on the accompanying town plan, and thene would feed the four sections of the town. Assuming E00 feet to be the nuixinum distance persons should walk to fetch water, it will be further necessary to run (say l£') local feed pipes to points as shown on the plan. P*?*o«2» ihe v/ater pressure At these points would be a proxiin&amp;teljr cO»dZ lbs* per s;uare inch* Reducing the area to be 'walked' by water carriers, means that no re v/ater supply points would be necessary, but of less output per point. X suggest that four i' taps, i.e. two for the male section and two for the female section, would be sufficient to each watering point. Iipes already run from artesian veils ^.or grouping purposes could be utilised, where they exist, fox distrl Hit ion, as also could the three washing places already constructed. A supply of water for the pumps would be obtained rom the well in the Municipal Garden and two {or more) other wells in the vicinity, which would produce, collectively, 30,000*40,000 gallons per hour. For purposes of calculation I have assumed the total population of * 4 &amp;namah to be 30,000 (although rora observation over a considerable period, 1 am of the opinion that it is less), and tliat 12 gallons per person per day would amply cover consumption for all purposes. The storage tank suggested could, contain enough water for eight hours supply, without pumping, ^ ITilOU «» I suggast that four master v/ater meters be fitted n each 6' main which will indicate the consumption in th© areas supplied, and act as check meters later, when service meners exiat in th© town. Master valves would also be placed on each main, and these could be aut&amp;matio to either cut off or reduce the flow at certain times of the day, or be hand-operated by th* pump house attendant. When the scheme is in operation, the existing artesian wells (say 37/8) after allowing for the main suctions could be gradually closed in. A certain number could be used to supply water for the proposed public 'dh.bi ghats' which would, I presume, be situated as near the sea as practicable.

An estimate of JO to 40,000 Gallons per hour pumped from the 3 wells of supply, was the output given as being more than sufficient for Manama town. questions were raised as to water being laid on in houses. The reply was that the water supply was sufficient, and that each house should bear its own cost of piping. Mr. Steele further explained about the water tower which was only for reserve purposes, and if necessary - for example in hot weather-, water could be supplied direct from the wells without having to circulate through the tower. A lengthy argument, led by Mr. Abdulla A. Al-Zayid now took place, as to the advantages of using the Zinj lake with its sweet water, as a source of supply as well as a permanent reservoir. Mr. Weightman finally summed up by saying that its dis advantages were 1. Its impurity. 2. The extra cost involved to bring the water in to Manama (approx: i lakh). 3. The diminution of water supply for the local date- He suggested that samples of water should be brought from Zinj and other wells in Manama to be tested by members personally at the next meeting. The relative merits of each kind of water could then quickly-be ascertained. II * The recommendation that the three Indian anti-malarial experts should remain for a further six months from Oct:1940, to extend anti-malarial measures to Muharraq island and Sitra, was carried unanimously.

The work of the island as a whole, comprises fishing, oiling and cleaning of channels, and one drainage scheme in the Basatain. Drain commenced Dec: 1940. The latter has been successfully constructed round the lower and side borders of the Basatain of gardens of :- Basatin rain - Siyadi, Ghirazi, and Sh: Abdulla. This lateral drain goes “ 'straight to the Sea with a good flow and its purpose is to trap all the waste of those gardens, preventing any accumulations on the R.A.F. ground.

Notes on the Agenda :- It is easier to control breeding in the date garden than in the average big house in Manama. Some houses are untenanted, and some are locked up for the day. Many more shallow wells have been found to be superfluous, and have been recommended for closure. Most shallow wells ordered to be closed have not been sealed off from the outside air and breeding takes place inside. Original limit boundary area of work suggested was to Sinabis through Bilad—i—Qadim to the sea. This was extended almost immediately because the 1359 boundary was found to be further advanced. The boundary now extends from The Portuguese Fort to Adari. Villages between the Badaya road and the sea show little breeding. Similarly so in the gardens, where the soil is porous and harbours little water. The worst area is Bilad-i~Qadim and its environments. The main work is channels, allowing them to dry once weekly, and in ensuring good drainage to the sea. A great deal has been done and the villagers have already commented on the reduced incidence of 'fever'. The success of the Basatin drain on the R. a. F. ground has proved one of the greatest benefits to Muharraq. The iropaganda Minutes still await the approval of the General Committee. May 18th, 1941.

Belgrave was in the chair. AGENDA. I. The Problem of combating breeding in Manama Town . The chief hindrances which are Holding up the work, were discussed, and certain remedies proposed. These are tabulated as foll:- (a) Houses locked during the day only ( 108) To treat these houses by«.special coolie gang once weekly on Fridays, when all owners should be present. (b) Houses locked and untenanted (101) Keys to Fe obtained in eacli case from the owners, and examination for presence or absence of water to be made and noted in a register. (c) Houses refusing inspection . The Bala&amp;iya discussed this previously, and decided that no objection to entrance should be made as long as a male member of the family is present. (d) Shallow wells . A list of superfluous ones has been drawn up. Most of them are in houses and barastis. A few are big ones for public use. A small Sub Committee was elected to look into this. Their names are Haji Khalil Kanoo. Syed Hashim. Mr. A. Fakhroo. Mr. Abdulla Ali Al-Zayid. The S. M. 0. In the prescribed area where shallow wells were ordered to be closed last year, a few still remain non-filled. A list of names was prepared and given to the Adviser who will deal direct with this through the court. Others are partly or badly filled in. It was reed: that only filling up to a little above the water level would be sufficient, and a well secured and sealed sand surface on top of the stones. II. Review of Manama outside work for the 1st quarter I 36 O . The note's on this previously sent oulf, were 'read and discussed in brief. Decided that no further advance be made till September. III. Muharraq . There wa's little to add. Malaria is easier to control in the town as compared to Manama, owing to there being comparatively few shallow wells. The Basatin drain has reduced Malaria considerably in the village and environments there. IV. Propaganda . The minutes of the Committee meeting were examined and approved. The following schemes were reed: to be put into force as^ soonjr Pa&amp;e Ho. 2 as possible 1. To try out one of the Delhi Bed Cross filxas on Malaria. These can be hired or bought. 2. To give practical demonstrations on the riosquito and Larvae to the masters of panama and Muharraq, if Mr. Vallence can conveniently arrange this.

An answer from Delhi has been received outlining the scheme for loaning out films on Malaria and other diseases. A copy ©f this letter is with Dr. Macdowall. In brief, a film called 'Mosquito Menace' will be released for 10 days in Bahrain when available. Another film, on Trachoma is being sent and is on the way now. This will be shown nightly in the Cinema as a 'short' and will give some idea as to what their films are like. An arabic speaker will be necessary to explain the film. On May 27th and June 3rd, a picked number of the school masters of Manama, Muharraq, Hidd, Sitra, Badaya, and Rifa’a met to listen to a short talk on Malaria given by one of the Indian experts. A demonstration illustrated this talk, and all stages of the life history of the Mosquito were shown, and also the effect of oil on larvae and pupae. The masters were asked to give short talks to their classes on this subject, before the term closed. They also took away with them stamped copies of the Mosquito, larva and pupa to illustrate their talks. The following talks have so far been broadcasted this year. In conclusion I propose that one member of your Committee be chosen as a Propaganda Officer, to whom we can apply for help when in difficulties. Every now and then misunderstandings arise between our anti-malarial staffs and the inhabitants, and most of them can be put right by a little talking, explaining the reasons for doing these things.

Memorandum : Re: Mosquito larva-eating fish for Muscat . 1. 'The gambusia' and 'Aphanius (Lebias) dispar' are the best local fish for this purpose. 2. A hatchery in Bahrain was made in 1939 for the purpose of breeding Aphanius dispar. This we now use as a reserve supply only, because all irrigation channels in Bahrain,are full of them, and usually we take from them. 3. An anti- malaria survey report for Muscat was written in 1916 by Major C. A. Gill I.M.S., but I find no mention in it of the local kinds of fresh water fish. There should be some present I imagine, because date gardens are there. 4. I suggest therefore that if any local fish are there, to try them. Otherwise a nucleus can be transported down by B.I. boat from our hatchery, if a ready made hatchery can be prepared in Muscat to receive them. STATE Copy sent to P.A. Muscat under P.L. 14-10-41.

A.F. ground. Its drier soil and the comparative small number of date gardens. Sitra’s figure of lOg would have been increased if no anti- malaria measures had not been done there. Rifa’a and Badaya cave the worst figures, because little control work is done there Studying the monthly incidence of Malaria, May an.. June were again fou£d to be the months for severe infection, seconded by December. On the whole the high infection of Malaria for 1360 was disappointing, and can only be explained by the severe rainlall of Hovember and December of 1359. Additional very strict and intensified measures were carried out in Manama one month befor the known bad months of May and June, so one can only conclude that an epidemic of major importance would have resulted but for the anti-malarial work. P. T. 0.( Page 2. ) I. II. The work of 1360 was now reviewed as shown on the enclosed papers. The following were the chief lines ol discussion Brianama Town . To combat the shallow well problem, the sub—-committee should again be used in an advisory capacity 2 months before the malarial season commences, and as many more superfluous and disused wells be closed as possible. Outside areas . The oiling of certain garden channels still calls forth much criticism. The position is — Eow far will the garden owners eneure their channels being regularly inspected ? No oiling of channels would ever be necessary if i~ The edges were kept cleanly cut and weeded. Dried once a week for 12 hours. Or Kept continually well fished. 1. 2. 3. In the past only some exit channels were oiled, but irrigation methods and lack of regular garden inspections necessitated further oiling. If the garden owners will always fully co-operate, little further misunderstanding or oiling will ever result. As far as possible local coolies and advice are being used. III. Propaganda . 1) A vote of thanks was passed for the work of the Propaganda Committee. 2) Dr. P. A. Harrison very kindly agreed to become a member as medical adviser in place of Or. M. McDowall. «L 3) The Newspaper W'8~s voted as being a better medium^ tnan the wireless for spreading anti-malarial information of this kind, as more people saw it. 4) Hand-bills should be distributed,and brief information by wireless and newspaper made known to the public at regular periods,before the Malarial season of May - June. 5) More direct talks and propaganda to the main villages, Example Sitra. , SECRETARY, ANTI-MALARIAL COMMITTEE. 4-' V 4-w- /z K \ nl 'vork 1^6 w..

ON aUNUARY 12th, 1^44 V _ S' Sheikh Mohamed hin Easa al~Klialifa was in the Chair The Adviser was unfortunately detained from being present, 14 Members were present, The following questions were discoused 1. Is Malaria likely to be inc/reaeed in 1944, and can more Quinine be imported ? It was thought that Quinine was adequate in the Hospitals only, certainly in the Govt.- Hosf&gt;iti.l for 1944, if people can attend them* The incidence of Malaria is likely to rise in the villages. Further supplies of Quinine with difficulty could be imported for Hospital use only. 2. Why, out of nearly 4000 house wells in Manama, do anti-larval fish die in 20$ of them ? 3. Is any other method efficacious in dealing with these wells ? It was thought not, except a town water scheme originally planned in 1940. The house wells, the most fruitful source of breeding, could then be eliminated. This could not take place till after the War. 4. The S.M.O. suggested cutting down the outside area work and concetra- ting all work in the towns, owing to lack of transport. The work in North East Manama stretches as far west as the Portu guese Fort, Abu Saiba and Tubli. Curtailed transport has weakened the supervision, and made it difficult to ensure regular supplies of oil* The question was left open for the executive Committee’s decision. Finally the chief aids towards Anti-Malaria are stressed 1 * Co-operation of garden owners in keeping their channels weeded and clean 2. Co-eperation of house owners in inspecting their own water If house owners will inspect onee a week their own kitchens and house water for breeding and the garden owners keep their channels clean, so that the fish can destroy the breeding larvae, this would certainly be of the greatest value possible. This is mostly due to pollution by the house-owners, and ? due to different grades of salinity of the water. These wells will now be petrol sprayed once a week, which will kill all larvae, and do no harm to the water. Petrol and not all will be used. sources. STATE MEDICAL OFFICER.

M0SQT3IT0 CONTROL Dear Sir, With the virtual completion of The Bahrein Petroleum Company’s installation on Sitrah Island it is naturally desired to assist with the control of mosquito breeding in that area. It is accordingly requested that authority may be given to include the whole of Sitrah Island within the area where control is helped by gangs operated by the Company. 2. It would also be appreciated if arrangements could be made for some Government Official to be available to accompany the Company’s control gangs when they consider it necessary to enter the compounds of -houses in order to check for breeding in shallow wells etc., the importance of which was emphasised in Colonel Afridi’s Report of 1938. V/hile free access is given in a large number of cases opposition is frequently met with , part icularly in Ma’mir, Nuwaidrat, Sanad and Sakhir. It is thought that it might be arranged for the Company’s Medical Officer to get in touch with the State Medical Officer on these occasions when the latter could arrange for this assistance to be_forth coming at the time and place concerned. t&amp;ll-JL} A 3* As a further measure of control in an endeavour to prevent infiltration of mosquitos into Awali, the Company intend to institute spraying posts at the Zullaq/Sakhir crossroads and on the main Manama road at the Refinery road junction where all Company equipment heading towards Awali will have the interior sprayed with insecticide. In order for this procedure to be fully effective it would be desirable that all' other vehicles should be sprayed as well. Your assistance is, therefore, requested to obtain the co-operation of the Bahrein Government in this respect by the issuing of instructions to all owners and drivers of vehicles that their vehicles are going to be sprayed at these points in the interests of general safety from Malaria. Here again it would be of assistance if some2 i*. Political Agent, Manama 6th February, 194-6.

Dear Sir: Our Malaria Control Section has found definite evidence of Anophelene breeding in the garden of Sheikh Ibrahim bin Mohamed Alkhalifa just north of Zellaq on the coast. For some years now, our anti-malarial efforts have not been welcomed in this particular garden, and we have therefore taken no steps to eradicate this breeding although we have surveyed and taken measures in the adjoining gardens. We should be grateful if representations could be made to Sheikh Ibrahim and his permission obtained for anti-malarial measures to be taken in his garden. Tours very truly. Original Signed by W. P. ANDERSON, W. P.

J j ^ Dear Sir, \ v C&gt; File: 037. With reference to your letter No. 2308-42 SF dated Srd/October, 1947, and further to our letter FA-106 dated 3rd September, 194?, the Company Entomologist, Mr. H.S. Chubb, had an interview with Sheikh Ibrahim bin Hamed A1 Khalifah on the 14th, regarding his complaint that our anti-malaria unit has been pouring oil into the v/ater drains of his garden and causing Injury to his young date plants. During this interview, Mr. Chubb explained he was confident our method of spraying with P.luT., which contains a very small amount of oil, did no damage to date plants, as the ditches only were sprayed and the amount used was no more than two gallons per acre. He also offered to show Sheikh Ibrahim his actual spraying process and other gardens where this method had been adopted and no damage had been done, but he was not able to convince him. Sheikh Ibrahim went so far as to say that even though we sprayed ditches only, the odour might damage the trees. Sheikh Ibrahim stated that his garden sustained a loss of Rupees 1,400 a year due to our anti-malaria methods and suggested that the Company nut up Rupees ?00 a year and he would guarantee the other half. If damage was done, these amounts would be used as compensation and if no damage was done then the Company’s contribution would revert back to the Company. We are not in favour of this suggestion, as we forsee endless complications, especially if this system spread to other gardens as it would be bound to do. v hilst we ourselves are confident that the spraying of ditches does no - harm to date plants, we do not want to feel this confidence is not shared by the owners of gardens. V/e have, therefore, done our best to explain and demonstrate our methods at every opportunity.The Quarantine Regulations in general for the Gulf are the Indian Port Health Rules, which are followed as far as is practicable and applicable to local conditions. The C.Q.M.O. Persian Gulf issues special regulations or measures to be adopted in times of epidemics, if necessary. 2. As regards Yellow Fever, the. Station Manager may please be asked to refer to 3.O.A.C. letter No.B.A.H/ll/lSO/M-Q dated 3rd May 1942 forwarding 'extracts, from the report of the Inter departmental Committee of Yellow Fever Control, December 1941 n a copy of which was forwarded to me under the above quoted number. In Bahrain as an intermediate small port, the regula-* tions can apply only in as much as local facilities permit, e.g. we have no Yellow Fever segregation camp or stock Yellow Fever vaccine. As the demand is smaall and the vaccine manufactured in doses for large numbers at a time occasions waste to inoculate a single or a few persons,' and have to discard the rest, further the vaccine can keep only a liraited time, and has to be tested for its vimiorfoy ‘from time to time - facilities for which do not exist here. We presume unprotected passengers from endemic . areas would not be allowed- to embark by air and*are bound to stop at Cairo and Baghdad where fully equipped Yellow Fever Quarantine Camps are maintained. The chances of any one slipping through is small. If one did, he would have to sta^T in the plane and not be allowed to land, unless the period between his departure for an epedemic area and Bahrain exceeded 6 days. Passengers from Bahrain travelling to 'epedemic areas, or on planes from epedemic areas would have to be in/oculated in accordance with the regulations. BAPCO. hospital are frequently inoculating for Yellow Fever and if due notice is given, it is possible to have an inoculation, for a single or a few persons, who would be included in the batch being done at the time. {9cLJ tq.L.A. 5*. 0 /i b* 'Cy ftp * ckjl /) 'h) C-&amp; 'f'l-C ft'L-n n NZPara_100. # 1 1 Tiie % P a P er in nuestion waw registered only on the 10th July, and was docketed and put up on the 2nd Aug, Although it was registered on the 10th -ched rae only on the 11th as was wont titoe.
