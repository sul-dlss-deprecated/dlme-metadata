The 48th and 62nd degrees of East Longitude form roughly the western and eastern limits of this section. The system of arranging the routes has been as far as possible to work up from the sea base to a line drawn from Burujird, in tbe west, to Lash Juwain (in the south-west of Afghanistan), througn Isfahan, Yazd, Karman and Neh, and to connect the framework thus defined by means of cross-routes. Alphabetical indices of all routes and stages are given at the beginning of the book. An index route map and one shewing the limits of each of the three sections of the Persian Route Book will be found in the pocket of each book. Detailed descriptions of places and districts are to be found in the Persian Gazetteer. In this compilation the following authorities have been consulted and their reports incorporated with those on which the 1887 Edition of this work wan founded :— Captain Bailward, R A.; Hon. G. Curzon, M.P. ; Captain H B. \aughan, I.S.C.; Captain Jennings, R E. ; Lieutenants W. D McSwiney, 7tli Dragoon Guards; Hon. H. D. Napier, C 1. H.; P. M. Sykes, Queen’s Bays; E. A. W. Stotherd, 4th Lancers, H. C. ; Consul Preece ; Mr. S. Butcher, I. T. D. ; Surgeon-Major Brazier Creagh, A. M. S.; Major H. S. Massy ; and Captain A. G. Medley, 19th B. L. The real basis of the work is, however, the 1887 Edition above referred to ; but duplicates have been omitted, some short routes have been merged into longer ones, and a few which had become obsolete owing to more recent explo rations have been omitted altogether. The work has been compiled chiefly by Captain E. F. H. McSwiney, D. S. O.. D. A. Q. M. G.; and under his direction by Captain R. G. Egerton* Q. O. Corps of Guides, and Captain G. F. Napier, Oxfordshire Light Infantry. Captain J. A. Douglas, 2nd B.L., Staff Captain, Lieutenant E. A. W.I. B. Diary No. of 1897, Persia, 11 Stotherd, 4th Lancers, H. C., Officiating Staff Lieutenant, and Captain F. Tweddell, 28th Punjab InfantiT, have also assisted in the revision of this section.

Towards the 9th mile we entered upon a level tract of soft ground, and passed at 10| miles a watch-tower on a hill. The path then wound in a general direction south, across a small plain leading ns towards the 12th mile to the village Godiz, a ruinous looking place of scattered houses sheltered amidst groves of palm, orange, and lemon trees. Passing through it we reached in a few minutes the walls of the castle of Andujard, crowning a height. The place is now hardly inhabited, and we crossed another small tract of land in direction S.S.W., reaching the village of Andujard, situated at some distance from its castle, at the end of the 14th mile. Gowk or Gok . 26 40 From Andujard we travelled southwards across the plain, presently descending into the broad bed of a mountain stream, probably 300 yards wide, flowing from Sarak, but at that time consisting only ot little streamlets, which are absorbed by the villages of this plain. We ascended it for nearly 2 miles, and then proceeded S.W. by west, crossing some low hills, from the top of which towards the 6th mile Khabis was visible, hearing N. 5° W., and the castle of Andujard N.N.E. From the N.E., and extending to S.E. of the compass, one vast sandy waste, heaped into waves and having the appearance of a dark expanse of sea, was apparent. Au isolated mountain bearing north by west, at a great distance off, was pointed out as belong ing to the district of Kavere. A steep descent through a very wild and rocky countrv brought us at miles into a deep valley, called Rudkhiz, possessing a small stream and abounding with wild trees. Thence the road led south up the valley for f of a mile, the trees disappeared, and we quitted the stream, which here flows from the S. E. At the 11th mile we entered a narrow pass through a range of snowy mountains, extending from N.W. to S.E., and proceeded by a winding path. This pass presents a variety of rock, amongst which limestone and coarse green porphyry are observed. At the 12th mile we proceeded S. by east by a gradual ascent up a broad stony valley. At the loth mile the village Hashtal Tan bore N. 15° W., situated under some rocks at about 2 miles distance. Advancing up the valley, we got amongst snow, with which the ground was partially covered, the soil beneath being soft and salt. Here my compass getting out ot order, I alighted at the 18th mile at the village Fandaka. The snow increased in depth as we proceeded S.S.E, up the valley, the head of which we attained at the 21st mile, and then descended rapidly in the same direction into a vale, in the centre of which lies the large village of Gok, where we alighted after a ride of about 27 miles. Our baggage was more than 11 hours on the way from the state of the roads. Tehkud 38 78 Direction down the valley S.E. by east, reaching its extremity at the end of about 2| miles. Then f of a mile in direction S.S.E., past Deh Malik, a hamlet S.E. by south, by a gentle ascent leading presently among low hills, and then at 4| miles by the dry bed of a mountain stream, called Kud-Khanah-i-Nask, from a village of that name about 7 farsakhs distant. Towards the end of the 10th mile we quitted the bed of the mountain stream leading from hills to the S., and . proceeded as before by a broad valley, which is a continuation of that of Gok, only that it is in one part broken into low hills, as I have already described. From the broad valley we entered at the 24th mile a narrower one, leading through low hills , and reached the top of the ascent at about 27| miles. Then traversing other valleys and hills, descended at the 31st mile into a great and very uneven plain. Here we passed a few wretched hovels, where we inquired our way to Tehrud, and reached this most ruinous little fort in the obscimty of the evening. In all this distance no water is procurable excepting in the plain of Tehrud. E 24 * Fur this aud the next march, see also No. 1 Bam to Kurman, stages 1 and 2, page 1. No. 1A.

At the 2nd mile pro ceeded along a wide valley. At the 3rd mile we again crossed the Tehrud stream, which then flowed to our right through hills in its course to Avark and Bam. We reached the former at the end of 8 miles ; it is sometimes called Abarik, and is a small village of about 25 miserable hovels, situated near a mound crowned by the mud walls of a fort. It stands on the skirts of a vast plain stretching from S.W. to N.E. From this point is seen a high range extending westward from S. 30° E„ 19 farsakhs or 57 miles distant. Kuh Hazar, west by north, is 42 miles off, or about 6 miles west of Rayin. Bam 3,480'. 30 116 Proceeded along the bed of the Tehrud stream, which, I believe, is called Rud Khana Pul. This stream has a broad bed occasioned by heavy torrents which sweep down from the mountains of the south. At the 14th mile we alighted at some ruined hovels called Daharzin, and entered the district of Bam. The plain, as seen from thence, presents a wide expanse from S. 30° E. (the point of a high range running east and west) to east by south, another point or termina tion of a low range running about N.W. and S.E. from near Avark. Afterwards we passed some reed huts of a small tribe called Avil, and at the 22nd mile we came to Bihderun a village situated on the left bank of the stream, and having several hamlets about it. At the 28th mile we reached Deh Ushtar, a village on the right bank of the stream ; and at the 30th mile alighted at Bam. No. IB. Khabis to Bam, via Rashit. Authority.— Mohi-ud-dtn, K.

Tum-i-Rig, or “ hillocks of sand,” is the last camping-ground before entering the desert that occupies the greater part of the distance between Narmashir and Sistan, and here all preparations for the desert should be completed, including the engagement of men for the march as diggers of wells in the rare spots where salt and brackish water may be found. The water at Tum-i-Rig is fresh and good ; and all that may be required for drinking, at least for Europeans, should be laid in here for the three stages to Nasratabad. There is a layer of pure salt, of sufficient hardness to turn the tent pegs, at Tum-i-Rig. It is 6 inches below the surface of the ground. 2i.B .—Goldsmid also describes a route from Bam, joining that described above at about the middle of stage 2 vi&amp; Kruk (24 miles), Azizabad (18 miles), Khar Manzil (18 miles), and Tum-i-Rig (4 miles) ;—total 64, which, though good, is devious. Shdb Gaz 22 72 General direction north-east. The road runs over hard, stony, somewhat undulating desert, showing no signs of any kind of life. This desolation is unbroken, except by occasional sandy patches on which stunted tamarisk and small kahur trees are found. This desert stretches on the west right up to Tihran. At ninth mile the road passes a remarkable tower called Mil-i-Nadiri, height 55 feet. It is built of oven-burnt bricks, and has a spiral staircase ascending to the top from which an extensive view can be obtained. Shcr Gaz.—A halting-place in the desert. 5 feet, but brackish and bad. 5 I Gukg Water obtained by digging to a depth of 35 107 The characteristics of the route are the same as between Tum-i-Rig and Shur Gaz. At eleventh mile the companion tower to that already passed is reached. It is now completely in ruins. At twenty-second mile the ruins of a considerable fort and caravansarai are passed. Gurg.—A camping-ground in the desert. Here, as at Shur Gaz, bad and brackish water can be obtained by digging to a depth of 5 feet. Gurg is situated in a valley running from south-west to south-east (?). It lies at the foot of a range of hills which separates it from Isasratabad. There is a stream here, the Rud-i-Mahi, but its waters are so salt and bitter as to be undrinkable even by animals. It is a brook of considerable size at Gurg. Its course is not certainly known, but it is believed to work its way through the Nasratabad range and other hills into Sistan. The old road into Sistan used to follow the Gurg valley eastward, and turn the hills in front, but robbers have caused that route to be abandoned/ There are about here the remains of a caravansarai and of numerous kanats and mud huts. The climate here in winter is bitterly cold ; but in summer it is so hot that it is necessary for a rider to wrap bandages round his stirrups to prevent his horse or camel from being wound ed by the contact. The line of waterparting of the range of desolate and barren hills separat ing Gurg from Nasratabad is crossed at an elevation of 4,900 feet. This march is a very trying one, being mainly along the stony bed of the water-course that drains the range of intervening hills. At twenty-ninth mile is passed a curious ruin of a gate situated In a narrow gorge. Copper is said to abound in the hills around. 6 Nasratabad . 37 144 Between Gurg and Nasratabad we passed through a low mountain range, the greater part of the way along a narrow pass, whence we emerged by a “ darwazah ” or gate, of which From this defile Nasratabad was discovered in the low country, in the form of two brown castellated buildings, which on approach proved to be the old and new stations respectively, each with a walled enclosure for protection.

We had now entered a wild mountainous region, and some of the peaks were of great height and covered with snow. After passing the watershed, our actual marching road was tolerably level. From Turshab we pushed on in a general east-north-east direction for 35 miles, i.e., 10 miles to the passage leading out of the hilly country. 1 mile farther to a low range, and 10 more to the plains of Sistan, unmistakably distinguished from the stony slope by which it is reached from the south-west. Another 6 miles brought us to the dry bed of a canal. Being late, we had to bivouac, and next morning we proceeded 4 miles to Khak-i-Muhammad Darwesh 10 Sehkuha. . 30 262 Our route was for the most part across low inundated lands as before, and we passed many tumuli and heaps. At about 7 miles before reaching our camping ground, we rose to the Dusht-i-Sangbar, a tract which appeared in the distance like a range of pale cliffs of consider able extent, and finally we found Sehkuha itself, the modern capital of Sistan, amid utter desolation, across a country so rugged and cut up as though it had been purposely rendered roadless and difficult of transit.

There are two roads, one to the N. of the cultivation, and one which goes through the cultivation. The latter is described here. The tracks bifurcate at 1 mile, the southern track going direct to Nasri, which is ou the right bank of the river. Nasri is a squalid hamlet of serfs. At 8 miles the dam. After passing the dam, the track hugs the river until 12 miles, when it bends more to the N., reaching the new fort of Pahraj at 15 miles. This so called fort in common with the tort at 'Washt in Sarhad is merely a sarai fitted up with barracks inside.

Traverse the same sandy plain, thickly covered with brushwood, camel-thorn, and oleander. Cross a broad river, the Rudkhaua-i-Shur, whose waters are quite salt ; then turn nearly due N., and reach a higher tract of land with rich soil, bearing extensive fields of wheat, in which is situated the village of Kala-i-Kazi. This village consists of a series of very extensive date plantations, and fields of wheat. The water is good, though rather muddy, and is obtained entirely from wells, called by the natives “ Ab-i-Kahinat.” 3 Shamil 20 46 From Kala-i-Kazi the road leads across a plain thickly strewn with stones, which causes great inconvenience to horses. Low brushwood and the usual camel-thorn and mimosa cover the ground, and after 5 or 6 miles of most unpleasant riding, come upon clusters of date palms, and two or three swift, clear streams, whose course may be traced by the trees and shrubs that clothe their banks. From this point the date-palms begin to thicken till the large village of Takht is reached, standing in a forest of date plantations, with extensive fields of wheat and henna. So far the route is the same as that described in No. 13, stages 1, 2, and part of 3. After leaving Takht, the same plain stretches in front. There is not a stone to be seen ; all is rich, alluvial soil. The road now again enters extensive date plantations, known by the name of ‘ chastun.’ The ground becomes extremely marshy, covered with dense masses of tall reeds, which form an apparently impassable barrier between the road and the sea. The country is thickly wooded with well-grown trees of mimosa and the wild caper, interspersed with large fields of wheat, which belt of wood continues up to the village of Shamil, lying at the head of the valley entered at Kala-i-Kazi. Winding through the jungle, cross from time to time many deep and broad water-courses, whose intricate wind ings cannot be threaded without the aid of the guide. The easy and usual path for camels runs a little more to the N. In a direct line this place is only 3 farsakhs from the sea coast. It possesses a mud fort on a hill, about a quarter of a mile to the rear of the town. The village or town of Minab lies to the S. W., about 8 farsakhs from Shamil and 2 from the sea.

After cross ing a river of sweet water, which flows through the village, the road follows the bed of a water course, and for 4 miles winds in and out, when it±2 No. 12. Bandar Abbas to Bam, via Khanu. No. of stajre. Distance, in miles. Names of stages. Inter mediate. Total. Remarks. leads across a hard, stony plain, about 2 miles wide, lying at the foot of a range of barren hills. This plain, a great camping ground for the Iliyats, appears to be a network of water courses that carry off the water from the hills beyond. The path which was very narrow, in some places only just wide enough for a mounted man, enters the hills by an opening which is known as the commencement of the Gudar-i-Naurgun, and is the bed of a water course filled with a considerable amount of pure, fresh water, and with many deep pools. For 7 miles we rode along this rocky bed, till we ascended a higher plateau, from which we could still catch a glimpse of the Sig-i-Jandan in the far horizon to the N.W. The constant ascents and descents, added to the stony nature of the path, made this a most trying day’s work for the horses. The camping ground at Fariab, unusually good, dry and lofty, with excellent water and abundant firewood, and shaded by fine jambul trees. We again had to follow the bed of a water course, until by a sharp turn the road led us through a very steep and difficult pass (Gadar-i- Shuran) to a high plateau on the summit of the hills whose base we had been traversing. From this point to our halting-place at Rudkhana-i-Duzdi (16 miles), we traversed an undulating plain, clothed with the usual low brushwood. About 5 miles from the Gudar-i- Shuran, we reached the small river known as the RMkhana-i-Ghishkan, so called from the poisonous shrub (ghish or oleander) which fringes its banks, and is said to be fatal to men, horses, and camels. Four miles beyond this river we came to a small hauz, or tank, for the storage of rainwater, of great antiquity, and 7 miles further brought us to our camp pitched on the N. side of the Duzdi river. The village of Rudkhana-i-Duzdi, consisting of about 500 mud huts, lies in an amphi theatre bounded by hills, and is surrounded by thick date plantations. For the alternative road from Rudkhana-i-Duzdi via Ahmadi, see the next route, No. 13. 5 Rudkhana-i- 23 88 Duzdi. 1,680'. Ispid 22 110 The valley narrows and passes between two ranges of hills, that on the right known as the Kuh-i-Garak, that on the left as the Diwan-i- Murad, which is a somewhat lofty chain running N. W. and S. E. The road to Bam or Jaruft passes by the left of these hills. Khanu 1,580'. 12 122 From Khanu to Dosari, 37 miles, the road runs over a fertile plain, and presents nothing worthy of remark, save the range of snow-capped hills, known equally by the name of the Dosari and Jamal or Jabar Barid range, which present a truly magnificent appearance. Far away to the S.E. lies the plain stretching to Bampur. The supply of water was excellent and abundant. 8 At 16 miles from Khanu the village of Soran is passed. At 4 miles the river Halil, the ban ks of which are thickly fringed with tamarisk. The route from hence again lay over the same plain—in this direction bounded by the hills, which, running from Jiruft, join the Deh Bakri and Dosari chain. At 8 miles (?) we passed a solitary hill rising abruptly from tbe level of the plain called Kharpusht (or the Porcupine), from whence we got a view of the snow-capped Ahmadi mountain, rearing its head.

We had passed early in the day the village of Dasht-i-Kuch,* which, as its name implies, l | marks the limit of cultivation on this side of Deh Bakri, and coming upon the stony, barren slope of the mountain range, had continued our ascent for 10 miles, when we found ourselves at the entrance of the pass, from whence a very fine view of the Jiruft and Rudbar plains is obtained. Our path then followed the course of a mountain torrent, between rocky cliffs, till we commenced the very difficu ascent known as the Gudar of Sakhtdar. The summit of this pass, which is 38 miles from Dosari, we reached with difficulty, and passing through a winding valley, came into the open plain of Sakhtdar, with the Rudkhana flowing through it. EJo’ht miles from the river we came upon the first snow we had seen, and pursued our oii/t nut*,* s+.pen and desolate hills for about 2/ miles, and found ourselves, at 5 o’clock, at the desolate caravan- sarai of' Maskun, situated in a hollow on the highest point of the pass, about 7,300 feet above the level of the sea. Two miles beyond the caravansaraithe road makes another steep ascent to the extreme summit of the pass of Deh Bakri, for which the aneroid registered a height of 7,800 feet. Descending by a steep and slippery path, we reached, a mile further on, the caravansarai of Deh Bakri, which closely resembled that at Maskun, and had been evidently built near it to afford certain shelter to travellers on both the sides of this dangerous pass in severe weather. Entering a narrow valley with traces of summer cultivation, our road led into the stony bed of a water-course, which is the outlet for the streams of the high land around ; and after 2 miles of very rough ground it forked oft' into two branches—one to the N.-W. leading by Sarvistan to Karman {vide Route No. 8), and the other to the E., leading to Bam. Choosing the latter, we ascended some hills, from the summit of which we first saw the plain of Bam lying at our feet, with Darzin to the N.E., and Bam E. by S., the aneroid giving an altitude of 6,400 feet. An easy and gradual descent soon brought us to the plain. We rode for 18 miles to Bidirun, across a barren, stony plain, affording neither water nor firewood. N.B. —Abbott made the last five stages of this route as follows Deh Pesh, 13 miles; Dosari, 23 miles ; Sarjaz, 20 miles ; Sarai, 30 miles ; Ladva, 24 miles ; Bam, 12 miles.

N. to gain the crest of a very low ridge, from which another plain stretches to the foot of a huge mountain called Kuh-i-Naiyun (Jabal Shamil of the Admiralty Charts). These mountains do not appear to be connected so as to form a chain, but rise separately up from the plain almost as steeply as the side of a house to a height of some 7,000'. 'this plain slopes gently to the VV., and at this time of year, looks green from the babul bushes and scrub that grow tolerably plentifully. There are extensive date gardens at Kala-i-Kazi, and not much else, besides a few flat-roofed, mud hovels. Kush-Kuh . 17| 50! At 3 miles 6 furlongs a fine irrigation stream swiftly running with plenty of clear water, but slightly brackish. This stream waters a date garden called Dozu where there is a very small village. Then miles 1 a wide stony plain, a wide dry bed of a water-course, another irrigation cut at 4 furlong, and all that repeated several times till at 9 miles the village of Takht is reached. This is a large flourishing village ; many houses of mud with flat roofs ; but there are also many of the date palm leaved huts. There are large date gardens here, and some henna is grown on irrigated ground. Hence over an undulating plain gradually approaching the Kuh-i-Naiyun. The plain became flat and swampy, and smelt miasmatic. It was covered with very low tama risk scrub and looked gi-een, but there were no trees till we reached the next date grove. The village of Kush-Kuh is a large and rather straggling village on stony, sloping ground near the foot of the Kuh-i-Naiyun, Many of the houses are of mud, but the greater part of them are date palm leaf huts. There are 400 people in the village. The cultivation is chiefly dates and henna, but there is also a little wheat and barley. The water is good and plentiful. From here the mountaineers can reach the summit of the Kuh-i-Naiyun in half a day by a road round the E. base. They can take their animals up to the top. Brazier Creagh makes the distance from Bandar Abbas to Kush-Kuh 38| miles. ) Mian-i-Tang 845'. 21 71! The road stony and flat close to the base of the Kuh-i-Naiyun. There are here extensive date groves, a few babul and tamarisk shrubs, and some henna; hut no other cultivation. At 4 miles 1 furlong passed a few huts in a date grove with a water-mill (called here Asiab), reached the bed of the Sulu river at 5 miles 4 furlongs. Smith estimates the distance from here to Bandar Abbas at 57 miles. Went E. for about a mile to turn the base of a spur from the^Kuh-i-Naiyun. There is a foot-path over the spur, which must be the track by which Smith says he scrambled with his horses. Turning N. the road enters an extensive plain surrounded by high mountains with an open valley running up to the S.E. The road is up a valley that lies to the N.E. This plain is known as Do-Tang (the two passes), because the two roads- one from Ahmadi, and one from Jaruft—here unite. There is no village here nor any of this name ; but the village of Sulu Ghar lay about ! a mile to the W., and another village, called Kor, lay 2 miles E. at the foot of the mountains. The mountains are bare, steep, and craggy, and are chiefly composed of sandstones and slaty shales. The geology seems to be much the same as that of Baluchistan. Altitude of Do-Tang 427'. From here we marched due N. over the stony plain. The mountains are utterly bare, and a, tew wretched babul, ber, and tamarisk bushes were all the plain produced. At 15 miles 4 furlongs we again struck the stream. It is here a wide, rapid, and clear stream rippling over a stony bed, but is excessively salt. Horses will drink it, but it produces intense thirst. At 16 miles 4 furlongs entered the pass. This is called Dahana-i-Tang. The bed of the stream is now shut m by huge, steep mountains sloping sheer down to it. Near this point a small spring ol perfectly sweet water comes out of the rocks on the left bank of the salt* For roads from here to baulatabad and Saidabad. vide No. 17, pages 60 and 64.' 50 No. 13.

The rocks here are chiefly red and green sandstones veined with quartz and shales. The people say that there is always water in both stream and spring even at the end of the driest summer. The stream has, in many places, cut its way through a deep deposit of clay and stones. The scenery now becomes wild and savage. This place has no name other than Mian-i-Tang (the middle of the pass). There was no fresh water here. twisted Ahmadi* 3,060'. 39 HOi The road immediately left the main stream, which comes from Ahmadi, and turned up a narrow and quite dry gorge. The precipices seemed to rise sheer up and overhang the road. The gorge v.. and turned, but the general direction was N., between great masses of bare rock ; the road was rather bad occasionally, being strewn with great stones and boulders, but most of it was fair enough and the ascent easy, though rapid. At 4 miles 2 furlongs the road became bad and stony. At 7^ miles we came to a spring of sweet water on the right bank. There had been up to this a good many pools of bitter water, but none fresh since the spring passed on the preceding march. At about 9 miles (altitude 1,750') the valley became a little more open, and the hills were not so steep nor so high ; the scenery was bare and wild. Every now and then to the N. W. a huge peak of bare rock was visible through the openings between the hills. This is' the Kuh-i-Sih. At 11 miles 6 furlongs the valley again closed in, the bed about 15 yards wide with steep slopes coming right down to it. The road was not bad nor steep till 14 miles 4 furlongs when the commencement of the final clamber was reached. (Altitude, 2,348'.) rmon afterwards there was a magnificent view of the precipices of the Kuh-i-Sih close to us. Beached the summit of the pass (2,710') at 15 miles 4 furlongs. Then a steep descent of about 350' brought us by a not very bad road to a spring of water by the side of the track. 1 his spot is called Takht-i-Nadiri, and the name is probably applied as much to the moun tain as to this place. Ihere is no village or hut or cultivation of any kind whatever. (Alti tude, 2,367'.) At 19f miles again struck the stream we had left when we started this morning—it was still salt and bitter. (Altitude, 2,205'.) At 20^ miles came to a point where the river divides into 2 channels, in both of which there is water ; we followed the W. branch for 10 minutes, then left it on our left (to the W.) and entered a dry undulating country. Marched through this till 24 miles when an open plain, about a mile across in every direction, was reached. Up to this point the road was good and flat. Now we wound amongst low hills of bate^ sandstone till 25a miles, when we again reached the plain of the Ahmadi river. The plain is here about a mile wide with a good many date groves, and some babul and tamarisk shrubs. From here a high mountain to the N. N. W. was pointed out at the foot of which Ahmadi lies, the place itself is hidden by the spurs that bound the valley. Crossed the plain, and gained the river at 27 miles 1 furlong. The water salt and quite unfit for man or beast. Rounding a spur we followed up the river valley, our course trending a little more W. At 29£ miles reached a good camping ground for caravans with plenty of grass. babul trees, and date groves. At 31 miles 6 furlongs left the river, which was coming from the N.E. Crossed a spur on its right bank, at the S.E. end of which were some palm leaf huts amongst date palms. We afterwards regained the river valley, crossed the stream, and left it again—this time on the other hand. ^ At about 38 miles came to an irregular stream of sweet water and reached the fort of Ahmadi at 39 miles. At Ahmadi there is little cultivation except dates. There are a few grapes grown in the gardens, there is a fort into which we were not permitted entrance.

Bandar Abbas to Minab, via Kulagan (Southern route.) Authority .— Galindo, November 1888. For about miles on the sea beach, after which the track diverges slightly inland, but still continues at no great distance from the sea. As far as Kulagan the route would be quite practi cable for traffic of any kind, were it not for several muddy and swampy streams which are crossed. There would be no doubt some difficulty in dragging guns or wagons across some of these, as their bottoms and banks are composed of soft yielding mud. Kulagan is a miserable little group of huts in a small palm grove- The water-supply is from wells anil is very brackish. Road about exactly like last stage, level and god, with the exception of 2 river crossings the second of which was extremely swampy. So much so that camels had difficulty in crossing. Near Hajiabad the country gets more sandy, and the village itself, with its extensive date groves, stands in the midst of a large tract of loose drifting sand. It is a more flourishing place than Kulagan, though still only palm leaf huts, and a certain amount of supplies were procurable without difficulty. Good water-supply from canals. Hajiabad 70'. 14f 4lf Minab 90'. 121 54 The palm groves and cultivation extend almost without a break the whole way to Minab. Th« country is still perfectly level, the only obstacles to traffic of any kind consisting of some narrow irrigation channels which intersect the road at a few points but which could be easily bridged. Just before reaching Minab a very wide strong river bed is crossed with a small stream of water flowing in it. It is shallow and perfectly easy to cross. Minab stands on the eastern or left bank of this stream and looks a fairly flourishing place. About 2,500 houses. Said to produce 5,000 Kharwars of grain. The following is Captain Jennings’, R.E., description of this the southernmost route Starting from Minab, and travelling to Bandar Abbas : — For the first mile and-a-half the road crosses the river-bed, then enters dense date palm groves, which extend some 3 or 4 miles to the W.; I left Minab at 2-40 a.m. ; entered date palm groves at 3-5 a.m., having crossed the broad stony river-bed then partially in flood; at 4 a.m. we passed the Manuri village; at 5-25 a.m. Hajiabad village; 6 a.m. Dudeh, cultivation ; 8 a.m. a small arm of the sea, and at 8-40 a.m. the Gazrit river, distance to this crossing from Minab 22 miles; there is a good deal of arzan and other cultivation on the banks of this river, the bed is sand, and care must be taken, in selecting a crossing, to avoid quicksands ; at mile 27 we reached Kulagan. I left Kulagan at 5-10 p.m., and we passed numerous palms, wells, and cultivation at 5-45 p.m. ; at 8-30 p.m. we crossed the Sor river, water brackish, and I halted on the bank ; in a few hours, viz., at 10-30 p.m , I again started reaching Bandar Abbas at 2 a.m., distance 54 miles from Minab. In selecting the best route from Hurmuz or Bandar Abbas to Minab, the old rule that “circumstances alter cases57 No. 15. Bandar Abbas lo Jask, vid Minab. Distance, in No. of stage. MILES. Names of stages. Inter mediate. Total. Rkm&amp;bks, must not be forgotten : it is impossible to say which is the best route ; after heavy rain or in times of high spring tides the southern route is impracticable, then the middle route must be taken; if excessively high floods are prevalent, the northern route must be adopted: all three routes are available for” all arms at their proper seasons, and the plain contains numerous villages, wells, and cultivation ; also grass, wood, and grazing, so the selection of good halting- places would not be difficult. General direction W., i.e., parallel to the coast. For description of Minab and of landing-place, Shahbandar or Khor Minab, vide page 206-7, Persian Gulf Pilot, 3rd edition, 1890. Continuing from Minab : Kalavi 22 76 Gebu 20 96 For some little distance the road passes between some low sandstone bills on the left, and the date grove on the right ; it then cuts into the plain bearing nearly due S.; about here not much cul tivation, the plain, however, is covered with camel-thorn and low scrub. At 5th mile pass through the bed of a small stream without any water. Country very flat, and the going soft. At 10 a.m. halted close to a river and near to a small village called Chah Kambar. Cross the river at a place called Ju Mahallah, a small village of 3 or 4 houses. On the hill top, nearest to the ford, is a small round tower in ruins. The stream is broad, but not deep. This stream rises in the Basbakird hills, and winds out of the plain to the sea. The rest of the way the ground is very soft. Eoad across a very bad bit of ground, generally soft, and in some places deep. At 3rd mile out of the bad ground on to some good hard-going at the back of a date grove and along the base of some small hills. At 5th mile Kuhistak, a village on the coast, with a fort situated on a small isolated hill, about 80 feet to 100 feet high, close to eastward of village. Inhabitants chiefly fishermen. Cross at its mouth a small stream, called Chalak. After leaving this, the road goes along the sands quite close to the sea ; course due S. ; the Arab coast to be seen to the W. and S. W. At 9^ mile cross another stream. At 14th mile pass a village in the sandhills to the left, about a mile off, called Ziarat. The road still on the sands, with the sea about 100 yards off. Geru is a mile inland among sandhills. Water from a small stream. Population 400 or 500. For about 2 miles follow the line of sandhills. From this point out on to an open plain with lots of camel-thorn and low scrub all about. At the 3rd mile the village of Tahrui ; at 6 miles another village called Serik. On the left, hills of fairish height, about 3 miles off. On the right a succession of date groves, and the sea in the far distance. The ground all about soft-going. A number of small streams full of muddy water to be passed. These streams are evidently the draining of the bills to the left. None of them of any importance. At 11th mile village of Kardar ; at 14th the Gaz river, a deep, swift-flowing stream, about 60 yards across and running about 6 miles an hour. Very often impassable for days together. The village of Gaz is about 2 miles beyond on the further side. It only contains about 20 houses. Through a small date grove into the plain. The road in places very bad. At 4th mile Gawan. At 8 miles cross a shallow river between steep high banks; bed 160 yards broad. At 10th mile Karat is a Baluchi village of 20 houses. S.-E. for about a mile under the hills. The ground in the centre of the plain much cut up by rains, and bad-going.

(Abbott went by a different road, to the N. of that by which I marched.) This lasted till 3 miles 3 furlongs where we entered a narrow valley shut in by hills of no great height. A few tamarisk trees gave shelter. There is no water here, but fuel can be gathered. No habitations or cultivation since leaving Ahmad i. Camp 2,560'. 27 143£ Continued to ascend in a general N. directioo till about 3 miles 3 furlongs, when we entered at open plateau, bare and sandy, without a tree oi bush, bounded by hills of no great height. (Altl tude, 3,420'). The plateau is apparently quite flat, at about 15j-miles the valley closed in, and we descended gently by an excellent road. We continued marching without variation till we reached the fort of Nisa at 18 miles. Here is a fort and a few palm leaf huts, date groves, and a little tobacco cultivation. The water is good and there is a fair quantity. No supplies could be obtained except a small quantity of grain. (Altitude, 3,078'.) From Nisa the road was quite level, except for one or two very slight ascents over loi spurs. At 20 miles 2 furlongs entered a rather thick tamarisk jungle, then another wide, stony plain, almost bare. No water at our camping-ground, but a little scrub for fuel. Dara Bagh 2,860'. 20 ^ 163f Marched over a wide plain, on which there were no trees. At 5 miles turned more northerly. Road up to here quite level and good. At miles entered a little gorge, and turned N, between low cliffs, where there was a good stream of very salt water. Followed up thi- stream for 3 miles when we halted. From here the peak of Kuh-i-khabar, on which theri was a little snow, bore 15°. There was a little bit of bad road just before halting. It was on the side of a steep slope of clay, but was very short, aud could easily be made good by a very few men in a very short time. In the valley there is a thick growth of reeds and tamarisk. No fresh water here, and none since leaving Nisa. Then N. over a stony plain where there ii a good deal of tamarisk and shrub; the plain extending a mile or two to the W, At 13 miles 5 furlongs there is a mountain road to the W. to the village of Lardigar and Hajiabad. After this we began to wind about amongst low hills and undulations, bare and craggy with the rod rather stony. At 17 miles 2 furlongs the fort and village of Dara Bagh was visible. Al 17 miles 4 furlongs entered a clayey plain, where there was a good deal of cultivation. Dara Bagh is a poor hamlet with the usual grove of date trees and a small amount of cotton cultivation. The water here is good and plentiful from wells. Plenty of supplies for a small party ; eggs, flour, chickens, hay, and grain. 8 Camp 3,550'. 21 184f Marched over a flat plain, where there v considerable signs of cultivation, and a g many people about; and at 2| miles reached flourishing village of Sultanabad with a mosque Here there was a nice-looking garden enclosed in walls with dates, tamarisk, and willow-trees Keith Abbott’s route joins in here. He crossed our road and marched to Kala-i-Nao (thenev fort), which we left a mile or two to our left. Continued our march to a place called Mazar i-Pir-Aghaib, 6f miles. This is the Ziarat of Abbott. Here there is a Ziarat with the tom!) of an Imamzada. Mazar-i-Pir-Aghaib lies at the foot of a steep rock, and is prettily situat ed amongst gardens of figs and dates. The building has a blue tiled roof. Kala-i-Nao* lay a mile to the W. S. W. off the road. We continued our march over a flat plain.

The soil is of clay, and there is a good amount of cultivation, cattle, sheep, and goats. The road was good and level. At 9 miles reached an irrigation stream of running, sweet water, and at 10 miles arrived at Dasht-o-bar. This is the Dasht-bir of Abbott. In the time of that traveller there were only some huts and a ruined fort. It is now a large place with good houses and forts, by far the most important place between Bandar Abbas and the vicinity of Saidabad. It is in a plain about a mile wide, hounded on the N. by very red hills, at the foot of which there is an old ruined fort. (Altitude, 3,080'.) Prom here marched over a cultviated plain, 13 miles, when we passed on our right a tomb amongst some trees where there is also a watermill. Soon after this we left the cultivation and entered a country most appropriately called Dasht-o*bar. At 16 miles the road became rather stony. At 18 miles (altitude 3,400') came to an irrigation stream with plenty of fresh water, and followed it up for 3 miles. Passed no houses since Dasht-o-bar. Here the water was clear and sweet There were some rocks and a good-sized babul tree to camp under. Fuel can be gathered. Camp 5,890'. 28 212 ! Marched 6 f miles over one of the bare, wide plains covered with scrub. The snowy peak of Kuh-i-Khabr being to the N.E. At 8 | (altitude 4,100') turned through little gorge about 200 yards wide bounded by low hills, the road still quite level. This took us into another wide plain, the counterpart of all the others. At 10 miles the well of Kala-Anjir. Here the water is sweet. (Altitude, 4,610'.) The country now is rather undulating, the geological formation still of the same sand stones, and the country covered with the usual tufts of grass. At !4i miles, altitude 4,920'. At 15 miles descended slightly into another open plain (altitude 5,030'). At 17 miles we meandered for a quarter of an hour amongst rocky, low hills. These did not last long, and we again found ourselves in another immense' plain stretching miles to the W., and seeming to run right up to the foot of the Kuh-i-Khabr on the E. Later on we began again to ascend very slightly, and the plain became a flat valley about a mile wide shut in by low hills about 400' high on both sides. At 24 miles the valley narrows. Here there were a great number of bennah trees and a shrub called locally pad an. We now ascended gently; the valley closing in, and bounded by rocks and crags. At 265 miles reached the waterparting (6,010'). We then descended a precisely similar valley to that ascended, bounded by low hills with tufts of grass and thorn. At 28 miles camped about a hundred yards or so to the right of the road under an over hanging rock. No water here. 10 Pakistan 5,450'. 33 245f We descended a valley and gradually entered the open plain. When we found ourselves in a valley some 3 or 4 miles wide, bounded by craggy hills , and g rad ually running into another immense plain—no trees or bushes-nothing hut scrub and thorns. The snowy flanks of Kuh-i- Gugird visible in front. Peached the well of Nao-Kand at 12 miles. There are no habitations and no cultivation none ot which has been seen since the neighbourhood of Dasht-o-bar. The water here is good. At Nao-Kand a snowy peak bears 60°. This is called Lalazar. The ran&lt;m seems to stretch from Kuh-i-Gugird to Mount Lalazar. At Nao-Kand there are a few scrubby trees which would provide fuel. Altitude, 5,290'. Before reaching Nao-Kand, there were hills at no great distance running down on the E. side to a point at Nao-Kand, beyond which an immense plain stretched to the front and to the right (E. side) many miles to the foot of the hills, the outliers of a snowy range, which seems to connect Kuh-i-Khabr with the snowy* For road from Saidabad to Rayin vid Baft, tee end of this route, page 65. 62 No. 17.

From Nao-Kand the road to Daristan lies all the way over this great plain, bounded on the W. by mountains, at first many miles distant, but afterwards coming to within not many miles of the road. The road is at first over a mile or two of sand, then a soft clay road with thorns and scrub. At 23? miles the village of Shila-Haidari lies about 3 or 4 miles to the right. Here the road gets gravelly. At 30f miles Abbasabad lies half a mile to the left with trees and gardens. At 31§ miles the road passes through Anurabad, a square fort with towers. At this point another fort lies 2 or 3 miles to_ the left. Beyond Abbasabad there is on the left of the road continuous cultivation to Daristan with carefully irrigated fields. To the right the plain is uncultivated, and there is a growth of tufts of grass. Passing several ruined villages Daristan was reached at 33 miles. This place is close to the white rock mentioned by Abbott. It lies on the plain about 3 or 4 miles distant from the mountains on the right. It contains 40 houses. Grapes, figs, apricots, and peaches are grown in the gardens. Cotton is cultivated, but the chief crops are wheat and barley. Dadstan contains 40 houses. The water is good and plentiful. Supplies of all kinds abun dant. Over a plain where there is much cultivation and avast number of kanat wells. Soon after leav ing Daristan there are more gardens enclosed in walls, a quarter of a mile to the left. The hills on the left again recede from the road. To the right the plain is uncultivated and extends many miles. At 2| miles arrive at Malikabad with walls and towers, and a little square fort on the left of the road. At 4? miles Ozidabad lay a little to the right with walls and gardens. At 6? miles pass Ibrahimabad. From this point on a bearing N. 25° E., there is the Ziarat of Shah-Firoz and a tomb, 3 or 4 miles distant. On the same bearing is the end of a range of hills that runs N.K. and circles round by E.N.E. and E., and apparently on to the range in which mount Khabr is. This is also apparently connected with the other snowy range seen yesterday. On the left the mountains run down to a point 6 or 7 miles distant, and beyond this another great plain runs up many miles to the left. At 7 miles pass a ruined village. At 10£ miles Kala Sang bears N. 40° E., half a mile distant. There is a fort here and s tomb with a blue tiled roof. On the map plotted from Abbotl’s route Kala Sang is placed on the W. side of the road; so he must have followed a different track. At 12 miles Kamalabad, a village with walled gardens, lies about half a mile to the left. At 14 miles, the village of Najafabad with walls and gardens. The road goes through this village. Hence the road is over sandy, uncultivated ground. Saidabad is the principal town in the Sirjan district.

At 8 miles the road descends some 15 or 20' into the drv bed of a water-course, where it becomes rather stony. Ihis water-course is now ascended, but the ascent is easy and the road is good. At miles a stream, with irriga tion channels, is reached. There was some cultivation here. At 12 miles there is a cave on the right bank of the stream which might give shelter if required. The road m now fairly in the mountains ; about a quarter of a mile further is a mud hovel, known as Bid.a-Khab. The stream is still ascended, being closely shut in by steep hills. In the bed are a good many trees. Then a more open country (somewhat billy) amongst the mountains is reached. The hiUs are gently sloping, and there is a good deal of cultivation, but no habitations of any kind. At 19 miles the road ascends easily amongst bills, but is very good for travel line. At 21 miles the solitary and uninhabited caravansarai of Sang-i-Tu is reached. No inhabitants here, or supplies of any kind. Fuel can be gathered. At 22 miles gained the audar or pass. The pass is called Gudar-i-Kuh-i-Surkh. The summit of the pass is about 8,540' above the sea. The peak is about 400 yards distant to the B.., the ascent easy all the wav. The road now descends easily amongst gently sloping hills following generally the bed of a dry water-course in a northerly direction. In the bed of the water-course there are tufts of grass, bushes, and thorny trees. From the bed of the water-course, the point of a spur on the right is rounded, a somewhat large valley running N.E. and S.W. is gained, and immediately afterwards the caravansarai of Khan-i-Surkh is seen a little in front. There are no inhabitants here, nor supplies, nor forage of any kind whatever. Some fuel can be gathered heie. The water is from a well and is good. At first down a somewhat narrow valley in h general direction N.E. by E. between low hills. At 3 miles there is an irrigation stream with plenty of water. At 9^ miles there is water near the road and a good deal of tamarisk. At lOj- miles the valley opens a little, and afterwards a wide valley opens to the left, run ning up towards the N.W. and W. At 14 miles the road is between low hills; there is some scrub and some small thorny bushes. The road now leads directly on the W. peak of the Kuh-i-Mashish. This mountain is a long one with several peaks ; the village of JVIashish lies to the E. of it- The road still continues down an open valley, bounded by low hills with scrubby thorns. At 17 miles reached a ruined fort known as Mohunak. The valley there opens out into a wide plain where there is a good deal of cultivation, chiefly wheat. At 19 miles the little village of Deh-Darvesh lies a quarter of a mile to the right of the road. The road then turns due E., and leads directly to the village of Mashish, which is visible from here. The road hence gradually descends over a wide plain. At 22 miles the ruined fort of Girang near some good water and an irrigation stream with cultivation. At 30f miles reach the village or cluster of villages of Mashish in an open plain.

At 4 miles enter low hills, and ascend easily till 6f miles, where a little pass leads into a small plain ; this is about a couple of miles wide, and is crossed in a N.E. direction. It is a bare plain with a few tufts. At 8-^ miles the plain is left by another small pass, and then the road is amongst low, rockv hills, still rising steadily, but easily to the first crest of the Gudar-i- God-i-dokhtar (7,280'above the level of the sea), then rather a nasty, stony descent. The bottom, which is 290' below the crest, is reached in 10 minutes, and another 10 minutes64 . No. 17. Bandar Abbas to Karman, rid Sailahad, No, of stage. DiaTANCR, IN MILKS. Names of stages.

This was gained at miles, then down a narrow and rocky defile to the caravansarai of Khan-i-kuh. This was reached at 11^ miles. (Altitude, 6,570'.) Hence the road leads down the defile, the road to Baghin branching off to the left directly beyond the caravan sarai. At 13§ miles an immense plain is reached stretching E.and W., to a vast distance, and to the N.E., to Akbarabad and Baghin, the former of which is visible from here, 11 miles distant. At 17| miles a long line of kanat wells is reached, stretching away up and down the plain as far as can be seen. (Altitude, 5,600'.) At 19| miles another similar line of Icanats, and an abandoned fort about a mile to the right of the road. The plain up to this is utterly bare, there is not a tree in the whole of it, now it is clothed with thorns and tufts. At 23 miles cultivation begins ; and the village of Baghin lies 2 miles to the left at the base of a mountain which runs N.W. and S.E. The S.E. end of this mountain is close to the village and a little to the N. of it. At 24 miles an irrigation stream of fresh water. Hence the road turns sharp round to the E. to the two villages of Akbarabad. The caravansarai is at the E. one. The villages of Akbarabad are wretched places, where supplies of any sort are with difficulty procured. The water is good—better than at Baghin. The caravansarai also is well built, and has one or two rooms in it that are clean. From Mashish to Kaman the halt might be made at Baghin. The road would be a trifle longer, but Baghin is a lar^e village with Chaparkhana and supplies. 16 Karman . 13| 379| 5,680'. i The march was over a bare, sandy plain where the going was generally heavy, and progress rather slower than usual. On the left is a moun tain whose base is about a mile distant. This is the end of the mountain above Baghin. The road is now skirting the E. end. To the ri°fit of the road, the plain stretches a great distance to high mountains. At 5 miles cultivation begins, and there is a good irrigation stream of clear water. Here also the plain of Karman begins to open up to the left at the back of the hill we have skirted, the road still over heavy sand. At 9 miles, a well from which Karman is first visible. Hence the cultivation is continuous to Karman. The following alternative route from Ahmadi to Kala-i-Nao {vide stage 8) was traversed by Abbott. Dattlatabad 3,450'. 30 IdOl us about N. N. a path stony in Our route from Ahmadi led W. towards the mountains by parts. At 1^ miles we entered a deep pass leading at first N., and here I observed some large fossils, funnel-shaped and fold within fold ; the pass greatly expanding as we advanced and containing bushes of various kinds and a few benneh trees. At mile we ascended the rocks by a difficult and dangerous path, in which some of our baggage mules fell, occasioning us much delay in unloading and re-loading them ; 8 or 10 minutes would otherwise have sufficed to take us to the summit, from whence we descended immediately into a small plain, the surface of which, at first perfectly sterile, was further on sprinkled with tufts and bushes, but exceedingly stony. The plain stretches E. and W., and is apparently of no great extent. Our way across it led us N. 30° E. and N. 25° E. to some low hills, where we proceeded along the dry bed of a salt stream, where fossils resembling a honeycomb are abundant. At 9£ miles we entered a pass through red hills, winding through which, by a gentle ascent, we cross, at the 14th mile, the valley side and immediately afterwards proceed N. 10° E. over hills. At the 15th mile we turned off the road to our right to a sulphurous spring of water, which, though extremely nauseous to the taste, is still used by travellers for want of better. We continued due N. over the hills for a space, and at the 16th mile proceeded up a narrow rugged ravine, in direction between 85° and 50°, presently reaching its summit; thence by a gradual descent 55° E. and N. and down a valley between the points W. by N. and N.

Kala'-i-Nao . 30 170! Direction 300°. Four miles and a half brought us up to a copious hanat stream, close to the fort of Kadirabad. Passing an encampment of Afshars at the 8th mile, we proceeded parallel with mountains | mile distant to our right. Towards the 12th mile these mountains receding to the N. form a wide recess of the plain, of which at this mrt and at Daulatabad the width is the greatest. At the 14th mile, Allahabad, a lately abandoned fort, bore due N., 1 mile distant; and N. 10° W. were the snowy mountains of Khabr, a division of Akta, which, notwithstanding its mountainous character, abounds with fruit groves, of which the pomegranate, almond, pistachio-nut, grape, and fig are the principal productions. The habitations there are of mud and stone. At the 15th mile we reached some rocks, several high ridges of which interrupt the plain at this point, running N N W« and S S E. The juniper trees had becvine scarcer m this part. At lo 3 miles the deserted fort of Orzu bore N. 5° W. about 2 miles distant. Presently afterwards we passed the ruins of two small forts and some fruit gardens. At 19! miles the fort Kala Muhammadi belonging to Afshars, who speak Turkish. IN. 20° E. from thence was the ruined fort of Orzu, the people of which occupy huts near it. A good deal of land was under cultivation in this part of the plain, watered by copious kanat streams. At the 26th mile we reached the small fort of Sultanabad and at the 30th that of Kala-i-Ivao. The range marked in our maps as the Jalalabad mountains is no doubt that of Jamalabad of Akta. Beyond the mountains, bounding the plain in which Kala-i-Nao is situated to the 8. is the country of Lar.

Not far beyond and a mile to the south is the famous Kala i-Sang, the ancient capital of Kerman. Izzatabad is a village of 80 houses under the Buchakchi. The march opens with a gentle ascent, Karimabad being passed at lg miles to the south. At 2g miles, and also to the south, is a black hill with a mined shrine to Shah Firuz, near the village of Shahabad. At 9 miles is Kamkird, an old garden with fine trees, but there are no inhabitants ; thence there is a gradual ascent to Aliabad which is a hamlet with gardens. There are eight fami lies here. A few miles to the north lies Balvard. A small district owned by the Buchakchi. The track ascends a wide wafa known as the Bud-i- Maruni for three miles when the hamlet of Istcr is seen to the north. Five miles north of the road lie the village and district of Zamzirk, and the village of Farian, both belonging to the Buchakchi. Further on, and about 2 miles south of the track, is Rohniz with 10 houses. After passing one or two more hamlets, the nala is crossed at nine miles, at Muhammabad.

At 8£ miles on the hill side to the left is “ Ab-i-Shikar ” a perennial sweet water spring, at 9 miles we leave the main stream which flows from Ahmadi and turn up into a narrow deep gorge to our right, through which flows a small shallow stream. This gorge winds considerably, but the general direction is north. In parts the track is bad bemg strewn with rock, and bold precipitous jagged hills surround us on all sides! Between the 10th and 11th miles is a particularly bad bit, and again at 12| miles. Skeletons of camels and donkeys testify to the laborious nature of this road-way, which is called the Tang-i-Zmdan.

Suitable grounds for camping available. Koad difficult and only practicable for small bodies of troops like last march. Leaving Pur the road runs over a stony track’for a short way and dips into a deep dry nala along which we proceed for one mile. Leaving the nala the track runs along the skirts of a zone of lofty hills which separates Daulatabad llrom Pur and Ahmadi districts.

Along this stony track several small shallow nalas are crossed, a few containing sooi spring water these join the deep nala running parallel on the left. The slope of this valley is to the south, the hills on either side have an east and west direction. The general direction of the road is west by north and runs over undulating shingly going.

At six miles we leave the salt pan and turn north into another nala flanked by Shur hills. The road follows along thm nala ^ several miles till we reach the Tang-i-Gilak, a broad open nala running east and west. Here is snrin^ of sweet water. Crossing this Tang, the road runs up a difficult, rugged, rocky, narrow Jota/crossing the watershed separating the Daulatabad from the Ahmadi drainage.

The road lay across a plain, which extends from E. to W. for upwards of 29 miles, and has a black, fertile soil, to the village of Kai Kaus, 7^ miles N.-W. of Behbahan. About 3| miles from the latter place, we crossed the river Kurdistan, which is fordable at this spot, leaving on our right, a little up the stream, the village of Kazim, and on the left the villages of Horestan, Kurdistan, and Husainabad. Baba-Ahmad . | 24 87| Started at a quarter-past 6. At half past 7 ve came to an old square building in the form of a Musalman Imamzada. After we had crossed a low range of calcareous hills, we reached at 8 o’clock the village of Chahar-ru. Continuing in a N.-N.-W. direction, at 9 a.m. I reached Tashun (9 miles). Here there is a spring of very clear water where sacred fish are kept. We now moved N.-W., having to our right stupendous mountains,bearing from S.-E. to N.-W., and another range of calcareous hills of less altitude, in a parallel line, on the left. The road soon became very rugged, and the country around us dreary and entirely devoid of vegetation. We crossed the dry beds of several mountain streams, and arrived at the entrance of Tang-i-Saulak at noon after a tedious march of three hours. We entered the narrow defile, hemmed in between lofty rocks, which overhang the way. A mountain stream flowed below. As we toiled on by a steep ascent, among loose stones, we came at times upon an old pavement, the polished stones of which were so slippery that the horses could with difficulty advance. The path soon widened, and we found ourselves in a grove of oaks, cypresses, and a tree peculiar to the southern parts of Persia, called the kuhnar. There is said to exist a communication between this spot and Isfahan ; and, though the road be very steep and rugged, still, to judge by the slippery worn-out pavement above alluded to, it formerly must have beeu much frequented. It was nearly night when we emerged from the defiles of Tang-i-^aulak, and the Imam, zada of Baba-Ahmad was still 1| farsakhs (6 miles) distant. The road lay through an uneven country. At first we skirted the mountain of Nauzar, and proceeded, after having rounded it, over uneven ground, much resembling that which we had passed over the previous day, consisting chiefly of gypsum hillocks, entirely destitute of habitations, but offering here and there patches of green turf and brushwood, especially along the valley of a mountain stream which we crossed. Baba-Ahmad has some clear springs, and is surrounded by high reeds and grass. Sarila 32i 120 The road now winds over a hilly country in a N. W. direction. We soon crossed the river Moghar, coming from Tang-i-Moghar, and soon after another river. Both are greatly choked up with bushes, in which lions are said to hide themselves during the day. At three-quarters-past 7, crossed another mountain stream. At 9 an ascent, and then a steep descent—the country much broken into hill and dale. At quarter-past 9 the village of Bul-fariz, discernible to the N. N. E. At half-past 9 crossed the river of Bul-fariz. At a quarter-past 10 a.m. turned tc N. N. W.. and passed by the remains of some stonewalls. At three-quarters-past 10 crossed two rivulets—the second was a stream of some size, but both were overgrown with high reeds {kamish). At 11 a.m. ascended a hill and went along a high table land with traces of cultivated ground and former habitations. At a quarter-past 11 a.m. crossed a stream covered with reeds, the country still hilly and the mountains of Nauzar discernible to the S. E. At noon we were toiling up a very steep and craggy ascent winding among high mountains, which commanded it on the right and left.81 No- 19- Bandar Dilam to Shustar, via Behbahan. No. of stage.

At three-quarters-past 1 P.M. we came down on the plain of Patak and reached the village of new Patak, leaving the ruins of the old one behind. At three-quarters-past 2 p.m. we crossed the river of Allar, of Ab-i-Talh, a considerable stream running from E. to W. between high banks. The village of Dalun, with an Imamzada, was left on the right. At three-quarters-past p.m. we arrived at Sariia.

Forded the clear waters of the Tazang, a broad and noble stream, with a hard, gravelly bottom. A fortified Janaki village stands on its right bank, and another surrounded by war dens on its left. J ° We now ascended a steep hill by a circuitous path, and entered a hilly country. The road first led to the N., then turned to the E., the general bearing being by compass N.E. At 9 a.m. we came to an arched gateway, called Rahdar-Darwaza-i-gach. From Rahdar-Darwaza-i-gach the fort of Mangasht lies due E. After a tedious march of hours over the high and uneven country of the Shara-gach-i- darwaza, we began the steep descent into the plain, leaving Mangasht to the S.-E., the road before us leading due N. At U a.m. we crossed the river Tala, coming from the’valley of Mangaon on the S.S.E., and in half an hour reached the ruins of Manjanik. At 1 p m crossed the Ab-i-^rd. At 2 p.m. we ascended a hill, and in half an hour came down on the plain of kala-i-Tul, which place I reached at 3 p.m. 8 Sab Asia . , 13 169 9 Gubgib . . 20 179 10 Shakabab • 14 193 Vide Route No. 38-A., stages 13-16. 11 Shustab • • 30 223 No. 19A.

W., by three miles in the centre, which is its broadest part. This peninsula is separated from the main land by the Mashileh, a salt water swamp, 12| miles long by 4 to 6 broad, inundated by the sea at high tides. To the south of the village of Kishir, distant about half a mile, are the mounds of the earth-work called “ Kala Rishir,” which was taken by assault by the British troops in 1856. A few hundred yards N. bj' E. of Rishir village are the British Telegraph buildings sub stantially constructed of stone and mortar. From this place a good road, fit for wheel traffic, leads into Bushahr. In the villages of the peninsula the houses are for the most part built of stone. Plentiful supplies from the town of Bushahr and villages. Water good and plentiful. Fuel very scanty. Cultivation poor owing to rocky soil. Bate groves numerous. Grazing in hot weather almost nil; in cold very scanty. Camping-grounds good and convenient in and about the villages of the peninsula. To the eastward of Rishir, distant about 27 miles, is seen a range of mountains of heights varying from 4,000 to 6,500 feet. This range, which is visible from all directions, and for many miles down the coast both to north and south, would seem to afford great faci lities for signalling parties. Note. —In the following route the rate of travelling with baggage mules, over ordinary ground, is 2 miles 6‘4 furlongs per hour.

At about 400 yards we cross a main road from the town of Bushahr, leading to a village about £ mile south. Two hundred yards to the north of this point are large stone buildings, called “ Imarat-i-Malik,” the residence of the Governor of Bushahr. In the road-way, immediately to the west of these buildings, are sunk many wells containing good water. Shortly after crossing the main road, the track, which passes along under the telegraph line, becomes a mere bridle-path, and continues thus to stage. Country open; troops of all arms might move in any direction across country. At 1§ rmles the road, which had been rising gently, descends at a slope of about 5° to the Mashileh. At 1| miles the villages of Imam Zada and Sabzabad, distant respec- G u i&gt; an ^ U1 ^ es sou ^ - Close to the latter village is the summer abode of the British Resident. Shortly before reaching the Mashileh, the telegraph line diverges from e road, and runs off in a north-easterly direction.

To north are long stretches of barley, and clumps of date trees; to south a grassy expanse of plain to the low range of Delwa, distant about 7 miles. This continues for l mile 3 furlongs, when the direction changes to N. E. by E., and we enter among low billowy sand mounds sparsely sprinkled with grass. At 1 mile 7 furlongs the road trends east. At 3 miles 1 furlong the general course is S. E. by E., and continues so to stage. At 3 miles 2 furlongs the sand mounds, through which we have been passing, open out into a circular area, about a ^ mile in diame- ter, surrounded by sand mounds. Barley is sown in part of this space; the rest is clothed with very thin grass. At 4 miles 1 furlong the sand mounds terminate, and the road tliej passes over a level plain covered with very short grass, with clumps of date trees on either side, The ground now consists of a whitish clay, and continues so to stage. At 4 miles 3 furlongs the village of Buneyghes immediately to north of the track. It possesses several small square tafanghi towers, and, by native report, 30U houses with about 200 men fit for service. The village, being surrounded by vegetable gardens and clumps of date trees, would afford a good camping-ground. The low hills of the range Delwa are to W. S. IV, of the road, distant about l£ to 2 miles. At 6 miles we are passing through tracts of wheat and barley, which continue for about half a mile. Six furlongs further on, the village of Baghak, surrounded with a mud wall about 8 or 9 feet high, forming a square enclosure, with round towers at the corners. Here also is a good site for a camping-ground, At 7 miles 2 furlongs groves of date trees, surrounded by earth bunds, about 3 feet higli, border the south side of the road. At 8 miles 5 furlongs the river Ahram, about 200 yard) to north of the road, runs between steep banks to north-west. At 10 miles 3 furlongs the river Ahram touches the north side of the road. It is about 100 yards broad with very steep banks 20 feet or so high, and now runs parallel, but in an opposite direction to out course. At 12 miles 6 furlongs the road crosses the river; water in bed about 30 feet broad, and a foot or so deep; flow to north-west by west; north-east banks precipitous, of tenacious white clay ; south-west banks, however, are less steep, and in most places shelve. From the village of Baghak tracts of wheat and barley alternate with stretches of grass-land. At 13 miles 1 furlongs the road descends a gentle grassy slope towards the town of Ahram, which lies ii the hollow between this slope, and that from the foot of the mountains to east. Large groves of date trees flank the town on north and south, and partially mask its west face, At 14^ miles the road is between these groves of date trees, distant to north about f, audio south mile. The road is good for the whole stage, but the clayey ground is liable to become heavy in rainy weather. Ahram is the principal town of the Tangistan district, there is a stone fort on the sontb west side of the town which is about one mile long by half a mile broad, and is crowded witii mud and stone houses, a great number of which are in ruins and uninhabited : it contains many mat huts. The fort has walls about 40 feet high, with round turrets at the four corners. Houses inhabited, about 250. Population about 1,000.

The road, for the whole stage, consists of alluvial soil or clay, liable in wet weather to be very heavy, and skirts the base of Kuh Khormuj, through a district clothed with green grass, and numerous tracts of wheat. There is always a gentle slope to west from the foot of Kuh Khormuj. At 2^ miles the village of Galuki, about 1| miles to south-west. At this point, close to the north side of the road, is a grove of date trees which would offer a good halting ground. From 2£ to 3 miles 6 furlongs rivulets about 2 to 6 feet wide, apparently containing sulphur in solution, cross the road at short intervals, and run off to the low ground to west. At 9 miles 6 furlongs the village of Arabi, containing 4, or 5 houses and tafangchi towers of mud and stone, with some mat hovels, touches the road on west. Khormnj is the chief town of the Dashti district. The fort, a substantial stone building with lofty walls, is on the out-skirts of the town, which contains about 350 houses. Of these a third are built of mats and the rest of stone and mud. Population about 1,400. Barley and wheat plentiful. Mutton and beef procurable, but not in large quantities.

Within three miles the road crosses three dry valas, which run to south from Kuh Khormuj. At 1 mile 4 furlongs a low range of hills, called “ Kuh Kar,” rise gradually from the plain at a distance of 2 miles to the south of the road, and with Kuh Khormuj to north form a valley about Smiles broad. As we advance this valley becomes gradually narrower. The ground slopes gently from Kuh Khormuj southward. At 3 miles 1 furlong the road crosses a dry nala called “ Gandu,” flow westward, and, skirting the low hills to south, runs through a defile about 300 yards broad.

We then pass thioughwic.it an bailey growing tracts for 7-4 furlongs. The ground now is neither stony nor sandy but consists only of a rich alluvial soil. At 10 miles furlong we pass a village lying to tie south, at the foot of Kuh Kar, called Banaiyeh Derazi, distant about ly miles. A 1 miles we pass between low rocky hills jutting out, as spurs, perpendicularly irom the range of big hills to north, and then radiating in every direction across the valley. At If miles 4 hr- longs wo clear these spurs, and emerge on the valley about 2 miles broad as betore. At 11 miles 6'4 furlongs the road leads through the ruins of a town. These ruins continuetffl we arrive at the fort and hamlet of Lava. The road, for the whole stage, is a mere tract, at times scarcely traceable. The fort is simply a stone wall, about 12 feet high, enclosrag a square court-yard, with turrets at two corners only. There are about 10 mat huts scattered round it, also a water-mill, and a garden of fruit trees, including the lime, pomegranate!®, date. Supplies very limited. A small quantity of barley or wheat might bo obtainable. I saw neither sheep nor cattle. Water good and plentiful, brought by small open conduits from the hills to east.

The road traverses a grassy valley, about 2 mils broad, commanded by hills on either side; tbose to south low and generally rounded in outline, whereas those to north are lofty, rugged, anl precipitous. Within 3 furlongs we cross two dry nalas, and at one mile a water-course, bed dry and varying in breadth from 25 to 80 yards, flow of all southerly. At 1 mile 3 fur longs the road touches and skirts the low hills on the south side of the valley, which is no* thickly dotted with kanar bush. Advancing another mile we cross a dry flow to south. Low hills now rise from the valley, distant a quarter of a mile to north of the road. At 2 miles 7 furlongs we cross a water-course, bed dry, about 80 yards broad, flow southerly. Within another mile the road is passing along a basin or ravine below the general level oi the ground. Low gravel hills rise directly from either bank ot this basin, which is about 300'yards in breadth. At 4 miles 6 furlongs we cross a network of rivulets flowing south ward. These, when in flood, form a shallow stream varying from 100 to 200 yards in breadtu. On the eastern bank of this stream there is rich pasture, and a grove of trees affording* most pleasant shelter. r l'he locality and stream are named Bidistan, and would offer a suit able halting place.

At 9 miles 2 furlongs the ravine, previousty crossed, touches the road on the west side, the eastern side of the ravine forming a cliff about 150 feet high, and the western sloping up to the foot of the range Kuh Kar at an angle of from 15 to 45 . The road then passes a water-mill. At 9 miles 5 furlongs we cross the very shallow basin of the stream Bid, bed 20 yards wide, with 10 yards breadth and 9 inches depth of water, flow south-easterly. The road, for the whole stage, is a mere track, at times scarcely traceable.

Camping-grounds good. From Chaga the road trends slightly to east of south-east, and runs midway between the river Mand, and the range of hills to the north, distant on either side about 1,000 yards, through a valley with frequent tracts of wheat and barley alternating with rich pasture. As we advance, the valley becomes narrower, so that, at 4 miles 6 furlongs, the range to the north is distant from the road about 500 to 600 yards, and the low hills to the south of the river Mand one-half to three-quarters of a mile. A low jungle of brushwood now covers the space between the road and the river. At 6 miles 3 furlongs the river, quarter of a mile in breadth, runs at a distance of 200 to 300 yards to west of the road. The bed of this part of the river is, by native report, unfordable, consisting of mud and quicksand, with very little depth of water. The ground is now stony and gravelly, but one mile and three-quarters further on it is of a fine clay and clothed with rich pasture. At 8 miles 6 furlongs the valley has again widened out, the hills to north being distant about 2 miles, and those to south 3 to 4 miles. At 10 miles 1 furlong the road, traversing the middle of the valley, passes a pond of good water overshadowed by low bushy trees. From this spot, till within one mile of stage, we advance through alternating groves of date trees, and fields of wheat and barley. After this the ground becomes very stony, and slopes gently upwards. Shumba consists of about 200 mat huts and a large stone and mortar building, the residence of the Khan. On the low range of hills, about half a mile to east of the village, are rivulets of good water, as also three water-mills, two of which are in working order, and the ruins of a town and ancient forts. Between this low range and the village, a broad shallow water-course, called “ Darya-a-Marsain,” bed, now dry, about 120 to 150 yards broad, flows to south by west into the river Mand. Between this water-course and the hills to east lie large plantations of date trees. Inhabitants about 500, including 100 men fit for service. Supplies in proportion to population.

The road is at first stony over good grazing land dotted with small tamarisk and bramble bush. At half a mile the dry bed of the water-course Darya-a-Marsain, after which the ground consists of clay. At one mile we pass the low range of rocks (sulphate of lime), called “ Khani Gatch, by a short defile, the rocks on either side being precipitous. A small rivulet, with sulphur in solution, flows for a short distance close to the west side of the road, and thence south-westerly to the river Mand. From the defile the rocks of Khani Gatch ruii close to the east side of the track, and the ground is devoid of vegetation and coated with a salt efflorescence. At one mile 6 furlongs the road leaves the foot of those rocks, and runs diagonally across the valley^ which is thickly dotted with a very small bush. At three miles the salt efflorescence disappears, and tracts of wheat and grass alternate till stage. The valley is now about 2| miles_ broad. At 6 miles we pass through the village of Darwe- sheh, altitude 540 feet, containing about 100 mud and stone or mat houses. Inhabitants about 400. Supplies barley and wheat, good ; no flocks or herds to be seen. Water plenti ful, but very brackish. Fuel brushwood, scarce. Cultivation good. Grazing fair.

Note.—F rom Darwesha a road branches off to Pasruduk, and from the latter village two roads lead, the one to Firuzabad, and the other to Jahrum. There is also a foot-path over the hills (for infantry only) to the sea-port Dayyir, general direction S. by. E. £ E. From native information. At 6 § miles we strike the banks of the river Mand, which are steep and about 15 feet high. The current is very rapid, the flow being from the eastward. At 120 yards from the high banks the actual water channel, which is about 60 yards broad, commences. The south ern banks slope up gently for 100 yards, from the water to the foot of a low range of hills. The ford, at this season, is about 4 feet deep, but very slightly lower down the water deepens rapidly, and man and horse would be carried away. I observed a few fragments of masonry near the ford, which were said by the natives to be the remains of an ancient bridge that once spanned the stream. Having forded this river, the water of which is saltish, the road ascends, and crosses a low range of hills of stony gravel and sandstone. The road, with a little broadening in the case of field artillery, is practicable for all arms. At 8 miles 5 furlongs we enter a green grassy vale, about 100 yards broad, dotted with Icanar bush. At 9 miles 3 furlongs the vale contracts to a narrow gorge, the west side of which is like a wall. This continues for I 3 furlongs, when the road debouches on to a grassy valley. We now cross the rocky bed of a stream “ Tang-i Bellas (?),” 20 yards broad, with about 15 feet breadth of water, and pass through tracts of wheat and barley. At 10 miles 2 furlongs a water course called “Tang-i-Nakhl (?),” bed dry and about 20 yards broad, is crossed. The road now passes the hamlet of Kerdilan, altitude 632 feet, consisting of about 30 mat huts, and a grove of date trees. The rate of travelling for loaded mules from Darwesha to Kerdilan is 2 § miles per hour. Supplies insignificant. Water good and plentiful. Fuel moderate from Icanar bush. Cultivation little, barlev and wheat. Grazing good. Camping-grounds good. Note.— From Kerdilan a road over the hills branches off to the sea-port Dayyir. General direction S. by E. £ E.

To east are the rounded, gravel, and sandstone hills of the range Kuh Kaal or Kasab, and to west the precipitous and rugged range of Kuh Kolonguk. Rivulets of running water, and small dry water-courses crossing the road are of frequent occurrence. These, however, offer no difficulty whatever. At 14 miles 5 fur longs we are abreast of Tang-i-Chakchak, and, half a mile further on, of Tang-i-Bachaki both of which are passes through the range bounding the east side of the valley. At 15 miles 6 furlongs low gravel and sandstone hills commence to close in on the road, and to block the south-east end of the valley. A quarter of a mile in advance the road, for a distance of half a mile, is crossed by numerous rivulets of good water. At 16| miles the road enters, and as cends for a quarter of a mile low sandstone hills by what appears to be the dry bed of a tor rent. This pass is not difficult. We then descend by a gentle slope to the main valley, about 6 miles broad, covered with grass, and dotted with Icanar bush. Six furlongs bring us to a belt of date trees, which we enter, and at 17 miles 7 furlongs we ford the river Riz or Baghan, as it is here called, which is about 20 yards broad, 6 inches deep and flows to north- wqpt. Baghan is situated at the north end of a narrow spit of land not more than 100 yards broad, the west, north, and east sides of which are cliffs from 15 to 36 feet high. To the west of this spit runs the river Riz at the foot of a cliff 36 feet high. The hamlet contains 60 to 70 mat houses. Inhabitants about 200. Supplies insignificant. No flocks or herds are to be seen. Water good and plentiful from the river, and from a well 36 feet deep. Fuel : fair amount from kanar bush growing in the valley. No cultivation excepting the date groves. Grazing very good. Camping- grounds good. Note. —There are, by native report, the two following alternative routes from Baghan to Darwesha vi&amp; the river Riz valley, between the ranges Kuh Kaal or Kasab on the south, and Kuh Kantara on the north side:— ( 1 ) Initial bearing of the road from Baghan to the village of Kantara slightly N. of N. W., and thence to Darwesha. (2) Initial bearing of the road from Baghan to Khumbaruk village slightly W. of N. N. W., and thence to Darwesha. From Baghan also branches off a road over the hills to the seaport Dayyir. General direction S. 5 E. Distance 25 miles. From native information. General direction S. E. \ E. The road, traversing a grassy valley, runs along the spit of land, about 200 to 300 yards in its broadest part. The river Riz flows on the west side of the spit at the bottom of a cliff, which diminishes in height as we advance southward. At 2 miles the cliff to west of the road has merged in the plain, and we cross the dry and shallow bed of a water course, called “ Kalabadu,” about 20 yards broad, draining westward to the river. At 2 ^ miles we ford the river Riz, shelving banks, same breadth and depth as at Baghan. At 3 miles 7 furlongs the road ascends Kuh Tarjemi, a spur from the range to south-west barring the south-east end of the valley. The ascent is difficult owing to its steepness and ruggedness. At 4 miles 5 furlongs we reach the summit of the pass (roughly estimated height above the valley 400 to 500 feet). The descent is comparatively easy. The pass is not broad enough for field guns. It might probably be turned by following the course of the river Riz, of which the bed, being gravelly or stony, is always firm, and the depth of the water, usually a few inches only, does not, I believe, in any case exceed 3 feet. At 5 miles 5 furlongs we finish the descent, cross a rivulet called “ Daria Mirza Kuh,” flow to north-east,'and enter on a grassy valley about 4 miles broad, dotted with small bushes. In crossing Kuh Tarjemi, the rate of travelling for loaded mules is If- miles per hour ; we now resume our usual rate, viz., 2 miles 6’4 furlongs. The ground is broken at times, and covered x with ruins. At 9 miles 4 furlongs the road crosses the dry bed of a nala, and enters a defile between a range of hills barring the south-east end of the valley. The rate of travelling for loaded mules now Riz . 19-F2 119-0*8 1,495'.90 No. 20. Bushahr to Bandar Abbas. Remabks. slows down to 2J miles per hour. The defile, called “ Tang-i-Eshkamay Kalat,” is at first from 20 to 30 yards broad, and its sides, either perpendicular or very precipitous cliffs rise to the height of 100 to 300 feet. At 10 miles 3 furlongs the north side of the defile slopes up at an angle of about 20°. On the top of this slope is a small plateau among the hills nainei “ Guru Kalat,” where a thousand men might encamp. Altitude 1,186 feet. Supplies n\\, Water procurable, but quantity uncertain. Fuel very scanty. Grazing fair. Thence the road, by an easy ascent, passes up the defile, which now varies in breadth from 50 to 200 yards, the rate of travelling becoming 2 miles 2 furlongs per hour. At 11 miles 7 furlongs a rivulet of good water runs down the defile. One mile in advance we reach the summit of the ascent, altitude 1,556 feet. The road through the defile now descends, and is only from 20 to 30 feet wide. At 13| miles the perpendicular cliff, about 200 feet high, forming the north side of the defile, finishes abruptly in a broken precipice. Three furlongs further on the road enters a grassy vale strewn with the ruins of houses. Here the Tang-I- Eshkamay ends, and we pass through a chaos of hills. At 16 miles 1 furlong the road runs i along the dry, sandy bed of a water-course, about 15 to 20 yards wide, flow to east; on the | north side of this channel is a cliff from 100 to 200 feet high ; on the south are low hills. Three furlongs in advance we ford the river Riz, about 2 to 3 feet deep, flow from south to north. Another half mile, and we are entering a grassy valley, which is here about half a mile broad ; ground gravelly, sloping 2° or 3° to the south-west. The usual rate of travelling is now resumed. At 18 miles 3 furlongs the river Riz flows on the south side of the road at a distance of 20 yards. The basin of the river, fringed with 1 a jungle of tamarisk trees, is about quarter of a mile broad. Five furlongs further on the j road crosses the dry, stony bed of a water-course, about 60 to 70 yards broad, flow to south- • west to the river Riz. The road then passes through groves of date trees, and fields of wheat and barley, which continue till we enter the village of Riz, situated in a grassy valley about 3 miles broad. The range of Kuh Bahram Shah on the south side of the valley, is rocky, and I presents for the most part a cliff-like section with a lower range of gravelly hills 500 feet in height at its foot. To north of the village, distant one mile, are low-rounded sandstone hills. Riz contains a small mud and stone fort with about 150 houses, some of mud and stone, and others of mats. Population about 500, giving 100 men fit for service. Supplies, barley and wheat considerable ; also some small flocks of sheep and goats. Water plentiful and good from the river Riz. Fuel plentiful from hanar bush. Cultivation, barley and wheat, good; also extensive date groves. Grazing very good. Camping-grounds good, f A good road from Riz to Pasruduk, distant 15 miles, via Kuh Baraftab, enters the hills E. N. E. A road from Riz to Dadelmezan, distant 18 miles, enters the hills, slightly E. of S. E. by E.

The road, at an average distance of about 300 yards from the hills, skirts the southern side ., „ „ , « iii • a S rass y valley thickly dotted with hanar bush. At 2 furlongs we ford the river Riz, depth of water about 6 inches, breadth 20 feet, flow E. to W., and for the next quarter of a mile traverse a bare, stony tract, inundated by the river when m flood. Another 2 furlongs, and we cross a branch of the river Riz, depth of water about 6 inches ; all the bed, except the actual water channel, is choked with reeds and grass. At 2 miles 3 furlongs a well named “Mahmud,” and a line of hanaU are close to the north and south side of the road respectively. The valley slopes gently from south to north.

As the place is named “ Tang-i-Man,” it would appear that there is a pass (Tang) through this range of hills either here, or in the immediate vicinity. Altitude 1,790 feet. The road now trends east across the valley, heading for the range named “ Kuh Tital.” At 6 miles 7 furlongs we pass a garden called “Jamalabad,” close to the north side of the road, and 2 furlongs further on a line of kanats on the same side. At 8 miles 2 furlongs the road crosses the river Riz, bed dry, 50 to 60 yards broad. The west or near bank is a cliff from 30 to 40 feet high. At 9 miles 2 furlongs the small hamlet of Gandum Zar close to the north-east side of the road, consisting of a small mud and stone fort and about 20 mat houses, surrounded by fields of wheat and barley. At 10 miles a dry gully or ravine, with perpendicular banks, runs parallel and close to the west side of the road. Six furlongs in advance we again cross the river Riz, bed dry, about 60 to 70 yards broad. The east or further bank slopes, but that to west is perpendicular and 10 to 20 feet high. Another 2 furlongs, and close to the south-west side of the road appears a small stream 9 feet broad and 6 inches deep, breadth of basin 20 feet, flow to west.

Ford the river Riz, breadth of water about 30 feet, depth 6 inches, flow from east to west: the further bank forms a cliff about 60 feet high. The road then enters a short defile between low bills, through which flows a rivulet of good sweet water. Ascending from the defile by a short and steep ascent, at 6£ furlongs, we cross the dry bed of the Riz river, and traverse a district called “ Parchega,” cultivated with wheat, barley, and date trees. At 1 mile 3 furlongs we again cross the river Riz or Jam, as it is here called, consisting of two or three rivulets flowing in a bed about 200 yards broad. The road then rises gradually, and passes along the top of a cliff about 200 feet high, at the bottom of which, on the south side of the road, flows the river. At 2 miles 2 furlongs the road once more crosses the river Riz, depth 6 inches and breadth 25 feet, basin very shallow and wide with its southern side covered with a dense jungle of tamarisk, etc. Within a mile the road crosses a branch of the river Riz, depth 6 inches, and traverses a valley, about 3 miles broad, thinly covered with grass, but with frequerit fields of wheat, and dotted with numerous kanar bush. Low hills of stony gravel border the road dose on either side. At 3 miles 5 furlongs the road crosses a small stream called “ Jellali,” flow to north, and 1 mile further we pass a picturesque water-mill worked by a rivulet called “ Cham-i-Chashmeh,” which flows to the river Riz. At 5 miles 6 furlongs the hamlet Husenabad, consisting of a mud and stone fort with 10 or 12 mat huts, touches the south side of the road. Within the next 300 yards we cross the rivulet Nilo, with high steep banks, breadth of water 20 feet and depth 6 inches, flow to the river Riz, and on the eastern bank pass a hamlet of about 10 mat huts. At 6 miles 6 furlongs the road touches the south hank of the river Riz, which here forms a cliff varying from 50 to 100 feet high. We then traverse a very fertile plateau, grassy and undulating, covered with date groves and fields of wheat and barley. At 8 miles 5 furlongs the road crosses a ravine with steep banks, about 50 yards broad and 100 feet deep. The mouth of the ravine, 200 yards or so to north-east, opening on the bed of the river Riz, is blocked with a plantation of date trees. At 9 miles 2 furlongs the hamlet Nargissi with 20 mat huts immediately to north of the road. At 10 miles 2 furlongs the road descends by an abrupt slope from the plateau to the pebble-covered basin of the river Riz or Jam. Over this basin, which is very shallow and about 500 yards broad, a few narrow rivulets trickle.

The town, containing about 150 inhabited houses, and a population, roughly, of 600, is covered on the south-west side by the ruins of old houses. The fort of Asir is large and substantially built of stone, with towers at the four corners. There are 12 cisterns, near the foot of Kuh Zalemi, immediately to north of the town. Of these four are fit to hold water, but at the present time, two only are in use.

The road now winds round the hill, and, at 2 miles 1 furlong, enters the mouth of a gorge or defile,which here cuts the range of Zalemi in twain. The rate of travelling decreases to 2 miles 2*5 furlongs per hour. The mouth of tbo pass is about J mile broad, but, as we ascend in a direction north by east, decreases to about 20 or 30 yards, the hills on either side sloping up very precipitously, or in cliff-like section. The defile slopes gently upwards, and presents no difficulty, till, at 4 miles 3 furlongs, it is barred by an abrupt rise of about 60 feet in 100 yards, giving a slope of about 30°. On surmounting this slope we find a small level space, covered with good grass, from which we can see down the gorge for some distance. At this point the rate decreases to 1 mile 6 furlongs per hour, and the pass becomes more difficult and rugged, and continues, for 6 furlongs, to rise by alternate ascents and descents. At 5 miles, looking southward down the pass, a portion of the valley and the range of Haftchah is visible between the precipitous sides of the gorge. Two furlongs further up, this vista is again afforded us. The pass, now, becomes very steep and difficult, between huge jagged rocks, _ so close together as hardly to afford room for loaded mules to pass. On nearing the summit of the pass called “ Gardana Zalemi,” we ascend over smooth rocky strata, sloping gently upwards, and pass an uncovered and empty cistern close to the east side of the road. At 5 miles 4 furlongs, the summit of Gardana Zalemi. Altitude 4,430 feet. From this point, also, a portion of the valley to south is visible between the walls of the gorge. To northward we have an uninterrupted view down the northern slope of the range Zalemi, and across the valley lying at its foot. The pass, called “ Zargozadun,” down the northern side of the range for a short distance winds round the brink of a deep crevasse or chasm, which splits this slope of the range almost from top to bottom. The path is both narrow and steep at times, just leaving sufficient room for loaded mules to pass. At 6 miles 5 furlongs (1 hour 38 minutes occupied in the descent) we reach the foot of the pass, called “ Demimansur,” a green grassy spot dotted with a few icanar and other bush, ground undulating, with low hills round about. The pass over the range Zalemi is practicable for infantry and mule batteries, but not so for wheel transport or field artillery. This pass might be turned by marching round the S. E. extremity of the range Zalemi, which route, I believe, presents no difficulties. The range on either side of the pass is rocky and precipitous, and would be difficult for infantry to cross, at least for any considerable body. The road, after leaving Demimansur, trends E. N. E., fairly easy going, at 2| miles per hour, with a slight downward slope, between the low foot hills of the range Zalemi. At 8 miles 1 furlong the road crosses a small rivulet, water brackish, flow to N.

On either side of the canon is undulating ground, and tumular hills clothed with grass, over which infantry and pack animals might pass. The canon continues for about 6 furlongs, when it merges in a green grassy valley, thickly studded with Icanar trees. Usual rate of travelling now resumed. The ground is of a limy stony clay, and slopes gently northward. At 11 miles 6 furlongs, we cross a dry water-course, width 15 feet, and half a mile further on a stream, bed stony, water very brackish, about 1 foot deep, and 20 feet wide, flow to N. E. At 13 miles the road again crosses a water-course, and in the next mile two others, beds dry, flow to W. The track then proceeds for a little more than half a mile, when it is crossed by a small open irrigation ditch, in which good drinking water flows. Wardawan is situated about 1 mile from the foot of the range Zalemi, and consists of a large, but very dilapidated square mud fort with towers at the comers, in which the villagers live. The valley, at this point, roughly about 4 miles broad, presents a green grassy expanse, dotted with Icanar bush, and is bounded on the north side by the range called, “ Kuh Hawa.” Inhabi tants about 60.

The road now traverses frequent fields of wheat and barley, alternating with expanses of rich high grass, covered with a thick and at times, even dense kanar jungle. This aspect of country continues to stage At 9 miles the ground is again stony and gravelly, and the road slopes up gently in tU forward direction. At 9 miles 5 furlongs we cross a small dry nala, in the bed of which, kanar bush is very thick, and, advancing another 3 furlongs, pass through the ruins of the old town of Alamardasht. Within 200 yards the road crosses a dry nala. Alamardasht con tains about 100 stone and mud houses, and 350 to 400 inhabitants. The fort consists of a substantial stone wall, about i2 to 14 feet high, enclosing a large square area, with rather dilapidated towers at the corners, there is a large grove of date trees to E. and N.

At 4 miles 2 furlongs the road crosses a small irrigation ditch, in which runs a rill of good water, and on the further side we come to an empty masomy cistern about ten yards in diameter. The ground, becoming stony, consists of the limy clay found in the valley, but is now mixed with a large proportion of fine gravel. At 5 miles 3 furlongs the road enters the pass Tang-i-Zangu. Ou the west side a deep and broad ravine, and on the east low hills border the road. The latter, sending out spurs to the S. E., form a series of very narrow parallel valleys. The ravine, as also an artificial conduit of good fresh water, continues to run tor three furlongs, on the west side of the road, which up to this point is good and fairly broad ; tor the rest of the pass, however, it is a mere track, at times scarcely traceable. At 5 miles 7 furlongs the road is passing through a chaos of low earthy hills, utterly bare of vegetation, and crosses a small rivulet of good fresh water, flow to west. Rate 2 miles 2 furlongs per hour. At 6 miles 6 furlongs the ascent becomes steep and rocky (rate now 1 mile b furlongs), and furlongs in advance we cross another rivulet of good running water. At / miles 2 furlongs the road, which, although stony and rough, is not difficult, ascends a rocky hill. Ihe track over the lulls is open, that is, is not enclosed on either side by rocks or steep lulls, and continues to rise for three furlongs, when we descend, and again risinu attain the summit of the pass at 8 miles 5 furlongs.

The pass down the northern slope of the range Hawa is generally steeper, more rugged, and difficult than that up the southern slope, ihe first two-thirds of the descent is tolerable, but the last third is very rough, difficult, and almost unrideable. This last bad piece brings us to the bottom ot the pass.

Before clearing the village we pass two cisterns, one on either side of the road. The valley, which is covered with grass and about 4 miles broad, slopes very gently from the range Marz on the south to that of Khunj on the north. The road, over ground of a whitish clay, skirts, for the first three and-a-half miles, the southern range at the foot of which is an abundant growth of tamarisk and kanar bush. At one mile the low limestone hills on the north side of the road, that had commenced at the village of Chatus, sink into the valley, and we pass a date grove, and a few mud and stone houses, situated at their eastern extremity. At 2 miles 2 furlongs the south side of the road up to the foot of the hills is cultivated with wheat and barley. Low tumular semi-detached hills then spring up close to the road on the same side. At 3 miles 3 furlongs we pass a small hamlet called Aliabad, surrounded by date groves, lying near the foot of the hills to south. The road now strikes diagonally across the valley towards the range Khunj, and, passing through some tracts cultivated with wheat and barley, brings us to the village-fort of Tishabad. This place, situated on the north side of the road, consists of the customary mud and stone fort, wherein dwell about 60 people or 20 men fit for service. Supplies insignificant. Water good from a cistern. Grazing good. On the south side of the valley are to be seen numberless irrigation wells, apparently not at present in use. Low limestone hills now rise from the valley 200 yards to south of the road. Some tracts of wheat, barley, and tobacco, are then traversed, and we observe frequent date groves extending along the foot of the northern range Khunj. At 8 miles 2 furlongs we pass a small fort and village, distant about 1 mile to south at the foot of the low limestone hills. Tracts cultivated with wheat, barley, and tobacco, now alternate with grass-land, till at 10 miles 1 furlong, we come to the outskirts of Arat, a fairly well built town of about 900 inhabitants, lying near the foot of the range Khunj on the northern side of the valley. Altitude 2,625 feet. The houses, of stone or sun- dried bricks, are substantially built. The fort, a square building with turrets at the four corners, is just beyond the eastern outskirts of the town. There is also a cistern full of good water. Supplies moderate.

The valley to south of the road, which is over gravelly ground, is green with alternate tracts of cultivation and grass-land, and is about 3 miles broad. Having advanced 2 miles 1 furlong we pass a date grove on the south side of the road, and at 13 miles cross a small stream, called “ Chasavil,” which is the name also of the locality. This stream has a shallow basin about 30 to 40 feet broad with shelving banks, breadth of water 10 feet, and depth a few inches, now to S. W. by W. At this point there is a water-mill. The road now enters among, and passes through, low hills. At 14 miles 1 furlong the road crosses a dry nala, that has, for the last mile, been running close to the south side of the road, to W. S.

At 6 miles the road ascends a limestone hilKKuh Kelat-i-Otar). The pass, called “ Gardana Mabada ’ is very short, but rather steer, and narrow, and in its present state, only passable for pack animals We ascend the paTs for about 3 furlongs, the rate of travelling for loaded mules being 1 mile 6 furlong* per hour. The ground then opening out, aud the ascent becoming easy, the ordinary rate of travelling is resumed. At 6 miles 7 furlongs we attain the summit of Kuh Kelat-i-Otar; altitude, 3,355 feet. We are now on a grassy plateau, ground stony and gravelly, and, proceeding half a mile cross a dry nala. At lO miles 3 furlongs the road passes between _ low tumular nlk and U furlon-s further on we are passing along the north bank of a cutting or ravine, oOor 60 feet deep. 'Low hills touch the road on the north side, and also rise from the south bank nf the ravine. At 11 miles 2 furlongs we descend by a steep slope into a shallow and narrow ravine, and commence the ascent of the pass called “ Tang-i-Lizdar.’ The rate now de ceases to 1 mile 6 furlongs per hour, and the direction changes from E. to N.E The road ascends the ravine for about 2\ furlongs, when it crosses a narrow torrent water three fee deep bed rocky, How westerly. It then passes up the dry bed, apparently, of a torrent between low hills of gravelly limestone. After this the ascent continues over rocky ground and is fairly easy, open, and not steep. At 13 miles the ascent takes a zigzag course in a generally N . by E. direction, till, at 13 miles 3 furlongs, we reach the summit of pass, alti tude, 4,969 feet. The pass, called “Gardana Khudu,” leading down the northern slope of the range (locally named Kuh Boneshkatu), although not difficult for infantry and pack animals, would' be very much so, if not altogether impracticable, for field artillery and wheel trans port. Steep, precipitous, and frequently perpendicular rocks, rise^ from the edge ot the pass! which is fairly steep, and in parts rugged and narrow.

Avaz is an open town with clean broad streets, bordered on either side by small but well built houses of stone or sun-dried bricks, neatly plastered with mud or lime. There are several large and commodious houses, and many shops, some of which are conducted by Muhammadan traders from Bombay. Inhabitants, about 3,000. Supplies considerable. Water tfood and plentiful from cisterns. Fuel scanty. Grazing poor. Cultivation little. Camping-grounds good. The dry bed of a large water-course, apparently, issues from a gorge in the cliffs, which bound the north side of the Avaz valley, and flows to eastward at the foot of these cliffs. General direction S. E. ^ E. The road traverses generally the centre of a valley about a mile broad, covered with thin grass and a scanty furze. The ground consists of a stony gravel, and slopes to north. At miles we cross the dry bed of a na\a, flow to north. At 3 miles 2 furlongs the road passes a small white musjid on the top of a low mound close to the south side of the road, and within another 100 yards two good cisterns, one on either side. Two hundred and fifty yards further on we cross the dry stony bed of a nala, flow to N. At 4 miles there is an abrupt rise of about 15 feet in the level of the valley, which rise the road ascends by a sharp slope. Another half mile and the road ascends a similar slope, resulting also from a change of about 15 feet in the general level. 'We are now approaching diagonally the low range of Boneshkatu on the south side of the valley. At 8 miles 1 furlong the road passes a cistern close to the north side of the road and within another 250 j T ards enters a defile, called “ Tang-i-Masjidn.” At its entrance the pass is about 20 yards broad, but at once opens out into a broad space between the hills. We then pass 'by a very good and level road between low hills, which are close to the track on either side. At 8 miles 2 furlongs the defile opens out into a level vale, about 100 yards broad, stony and very thinly covered with grass and small furze. The low hills on either side are steep, precipitous, and bare of vegetation. At 8 miles 6 furlongs we are at the southern entrance of the pass, which is here about 200 to 300 yards broad, lined with hills practicable for infantry and mountain batteries. At this point we sight, for the first time, the fort and rock of Girash. At the south-west extremity of the base of this rock nestles the town of Girash. At 9 miles 2 furlongs wo have cleared the defile, and are descending a gentle slope towards Girash. Within the next mile, the road crosses two dry nalas, flow to S. E. The ground, as in the defile, is of a stony gravel, and thinly covered with grass and small scrub. At 10 miles 7 furlongs a dry water-course, called “ Jangi,” touches the east side of the road and runs with winding course towards Girash. Proceeding another 2^ furlongs, we cross this water-course, very shallow sandy bed about 25 feet br&lt;&gt;ad, flow to west. The fort of Girash is perched on the crest of a lofty and isolated limestone rock, which springs up from the valley, abrupt and precipitous, to the height of 436 feet. The ranges Kuh Kermez bounding the north side of the valley, and Kuh Sia the south, are distant from the fort-rock about one and a half and three miles respectively. Near the summit of the rock, and within the outer walls of the fort, are numerous cisterns for holding water. The town also contains many cisterns, one of which is 15 yards in diameter. The houses are well built, either of stone or sun-dried bricks. Inhabi tants about 3,000. Altitude of the town 3,427 feet. Supplies fairly plentiful. Water good and plentiful from cisterns.

The city possesses a fort built of the latter material, also two good caravansarais, and a handsome and commodiou bazaar, in which latter all the necessaries, as well as many of the luxuries of life are to be obtained. The eastern outskirts of the city are masked by a thick pingle of tamansk trees. The fort of Lar, situated at the south-south-west end of the ridge of a steep and precipito hill, called “ Kuh Kala,” altitude above the valley, 336 feet, is completely comman by a hill, named “ Kuh Kadam Ga,” distant about 500 yards to north-north-east, and partly so by Kuh Kermez the same distance to north-west.

The road, traversing the Lar valley, passes between frequent irrigation bunds, and through fields of very poor wheat; and for the first mile skirts, at a distance of about 600 yards, the south-eastern outskirts of the city. We now, leaving the city in our rear, pass a large grove of date trees about 80 yards to south, and immediately after, on the same side, a caravansarai falling into ruins, said to be not now in use. At 1 mile 3 furlongs the irrigation bunds and trenches, which had been gradually becoming Ijess frequent, cease, and we pass through tracts of wheat and barley with frequent tamarisk frees. This is succeeded by short thin grass, tamarisk bush, and a few scattered date trees. At 3 miles 5 furlongs the road passes the village of Birak, 30 yards to south of the track, containing about 100 houses, small, neat, and mud plastered. Good halting place. Since leaving Lar we have been approaching the range Birak on the south side of the valley, from which we are now about 600 yards distant, and from the range, called “ Gatch, ” on the north side, about 2 miles. At 4 miles 3 furlongs we pass, 150 yards or so to south of the road, a series of rectangular areas, about 150 yards square, surrounded by earth mounds at least 10 feet high. The road now trends away to the middle of the valley, which is here well tilled, and green with cultivation. The ground of a whitish clay is, when uncultivated, covered with short thin grass. Larg«e irrigation wells and cisterns near the road-side are frequently passed. The ground now becomes stony, and slopes at about 3° to south-east. The valley is gradually narrowing in as we advance, till at 10^ miles, the hills to north are distant about 450 yards, and those to south about 150. At 11 miles 2 furlongs the valley has become almost a defile, which is called Tang-i-nao. Within the next 3 furlongs we twice cross the dry stony bed of a water-course about 20 yards broad, flow generally eastward. At 11 miles 7 furlongs the defile, about 200 yards broad, is bordered by low hills on either side. Advancing another 5 furlongs, we again cross the dry bed of the water-course previously passed. The further or eastern bank is here perpendicular, and forms a cliff about 20 feet high, but is broken down at the point of crossing, so as to form a steep slope. About 20 yards to east of this low cliff we pass the caravansarai, called “ Basti Pariab. ” The cliff, formed by the further bank of the stream, runs round and covers the south, as well as the west face of the caravansarai, which, with stone walls two feet thick, is 30 yards square, and contains about 19 lower rooms. Close to the caravansarai are three cisterns, all in good repair. At about 2| furlongs, after passing Basti Pariab, we cross the water-course previously encountered, bed as before dry, but now very shallow and shelvino-, overgrown with grass and tamarisk bush, and 150 yards broad. At 13 miles low tumular hills descend directly to either side of the road, which is very stony, and becomes more so as we proceed. Within another mile the defile is opening out, the low stony hills being now 30 to 50 yards distant from either side of the track. We observe several big and small kanar trees scattered about the pass. At 13 miles 7 furlongs the road crosses the dry stony bed of a nala, flow S. to N. The low hills have now cleared away, and the road is passing midway between the range of big hills to N. and S., distant about 600 yards. Advancing another mile the road enters the bed of a water-course, flow eastward, and immedi ately after passes along its very stony bank. The channel is about 100 yards broad, dry, and incrusted with salt. Prom this latter fact the water, when in flood, must apparently be brackish. At 15 miles 5 furlongs we again touch the south bank of this channel, and follow its course along the southern side of a grassy valley devoid of bush or tree. At this point named “ Piri Bala,” where the road touches the river, a road branches off to Kaana-Duzd. The valley widens out as we advance to 7 or 8 miles. At 21 miles, after crossing a deep ditch containing good fresh water, we arrive at the village of Aliabad. The houses oi mud and stone, with flat roofs, open inwards, .and form the sides of a large square104 No. 20. Bushahu to Bandar Abbas. ' Distance, in MILES. No. of stage. Names of stages.

Immediately to south of this village-fort is a large pond, through which good sweet water flows in from a ditch on the western side, and out to east by a similar ditch. There is also a oaravansarai, rather dilapidated and dirty, with but one upper room, all the others being on the basement. Population about 300. Supplies limited. Water plentiful and good. Fuel moderate. Grazing good. Cultivation small. Camping-ground good. General direction S. E. by E. The road, traversing the southern side of a grassy valley, approaches diagonally the range of Kuh Badeni. The ground of a whitish clay, thinly covered with patches of dried up yellow grass, and dotted at rare intervals with email bush and furze, slopes generally to S. E. At miles the south side of the road is bordered by gravelly clayey mounds, and dose to tbe north side a shallow rivulet flows toS. E. At 1 mile 6 furlongs the road crosses a very shallow stream, 25 to 30 yards broad, breadth of water 7 to 8 feet. Into this latter the rivulet, that had been running alongside the road, empties itself, and the united stream. 40 yards broad with 15 or 20 feet breadth of water, flows with winding course to E. N. E. The ground is now sandy, and at 2 miles has sunk into ravines, through which the road passes. These ravines, known by the name of “Chahar- Birkeh,” are generally bare of vegetation, and intersecting like a labyrinth, extend away on either hand to south to the foot of the hills. At 4 miles we ascend from the ravines by a steep bank about 40 feet high. At 4 miles 7 furlongs the road passes a ruined caravansarai and cistern named “ Shamszangi.” About here there is good grass, and an abundance of Tcanar bush. The road then becomes very stony, and at short intervals crosses three small shallow water-courses. At 7^ miles we descend, by a steep slope, a sudden fall of about 40 feet in the general level of tbe valley, which is now covered with a thin yellow grass dotted with furze, and occasional bush. Three furlongs in advance the low earth hills, called “Fildani,” spring up from the valley about 2 miles to north, the big range to south being distant 1 mile. The ground is of a stony whitish limy clay mixed with gravel. At 9 miles 5 furlongs we are passing a very large and well built cistern full of good water. A large flock of goats belonging to Iliyats, is observed here. Immediately after we come to a small caravan- earai possessing two small cisterns. This place is properly named Badeni, and vulgarly Duzdga. Supplies mutton, dependent on the presence of wandering Hi vats. Water good and plentiful from large tank. Cultivation nil. Grazing good. Fuel rather scaniy from kanar bush. Camping-ground good. After passing this cai'avansarai the road ascends a steep slope, and on this higher level traverses the valley, which is here plain and smooth as a lawn up to the foot of the hills. At 14 miles 7 furlongs we pass an unfinished caravansarai, walls about three feet above ground, also four tanks. The latter, however, are empty. Proceeding 6 furlongs we commence the ascent of a spur, jutting out across the valley from the southern range. The pass is called Gardana Bezan, and although rocky is not very steep or difficult. For the first 7 furlongs of this pass, the rate of travelling for loaded mules is 1 mile 6 furlongs per hour, we tbeu cross at a rate of 2 miles 2 furlongs per hour the rocky* but fairly level and open summit of the spur, which extends in breadth for about half a mile. For some part of this distance a ravine with precipitous sides, varying from 20 to 100 yards broad, runs alongside the road. For the next half mile the road descends a fairly steep slope over smooth, slippery limestone strata, rate of travelling being 1 mile 6 furlongs. Having reached the bottom of this slope, we traverse an easy and level road, and then ascend for a little over 2 furlongs, rate now being 1 mile 6 furlongs per hour. We next, for lj furlongs, proceed over the level but stony summit of this last hill, and finally, by a fairly steep, though smooth and open slope over rocky strata, descend into a grassy, stony valley. The height of the pass Bezan above the valley may be roughly estimated at 400 to 500 feet.105 No. 20. Bushahr to Bandar Abbas. No. of stage. DlSIAN CK, IS MILES. Names of stages. Inter mediate.

At 18 miles 5 furlongs, that is. about 2 furlongs from the foot of Gardana Bezan, we nass two cisterns to south of the road, one of which is empty, and the other full of good water These cisterns are styled, “ BirUeh zar-i-Gardana,” and sometimes, “ Birkeh mal-i- x. -J Abdul Hormuzi.” The village of Hormuz, containing about 30 houses, some of mats, but the majority of mud and stone.

E. to S. W.; breadth of bed, which is firm, and covered with small stones, 27 yards; hanks very shallow. When water flows in this channel, it is, by native report! saltish and not drinkable. , , *The valley slopes gently to the foot of the range to south. From one to one and-a-half miles to south of Hormuz are extensive date groves, extending nearly to the foot of the hills and also tracts cultivated with wheat and barley, etc., irrigated by means of large wells. Supplies very limited. Water good from one tank. Fuel scanty except from date trees. Grazing fair. Cultivation fair. Camping-ground good. General direction S. S. E. £ E. Traverse a grassy valley over clayey ground. At 3 furlongs the road passes a caravansarai containing 20 lower rooms, and, close by, another which is smaller and more ancient. Three furlongs in advance we cross the dry and shallow bed of a water-conrse named “ Par-i-Khan,” breadth about 40 yards, flow from E. to W. The ground is now stony, gravelly, and undulating, A dry water-course, styled “ Hajamal,” runs to southward at a distance of 20 to 30 yards, on the west side of the road, at the bottom of a deep ravine or cutting about 100 yards broad. At 1 mile 1 furlong the road descends abruptly by a steep slope into this cutting, which has now widened out into a basin 500 yards broad overgrown with kanar bush. The banks of the water-course, on the west side of the basin, are lined with date trees. We traverse the cutting, which is called “Bagh-i-Paroshur,” for half a mile and ascend by a steep slope to a smooth grassy valley sloping southward. At 2 miles 1 furlong, we again descend into the river-formed ravine or basin, about 100 yards broad, bordered by low gravel hills, or rather mounds. Seven furlongs in advance, a wall 3 feet high, of loose, rough stone, borders, for the next half mile, the east side of the road. This place is named “ Bagh-i-Parobardin,” and, although now neglected and abandoned, was formerly the site of a garden or cultivated enclosure. There are still to be seen the remains of an open irrigation conduit or ditch. The stream Hajamal, on the west side of the ravine, runs between steep gravel banks to southward, and is here 30 yards in breadth. At 4§ miles we cross the Hajamal, banks shelving at point of crossing; the bed, which is very stony, and about 120 yards broad, contains only salt water in pools. The nearer or northern banks are lined with tamarisk bush. The stream then runs on the east side, and out of sight of the road, between high cliff-like banks. Five hundred yards after crossing the stream, we pass a large cistern, full of good water, and a caravansarai containing 24 lower rooms. Having left this caravansarai, which is called “ Hajamal,” the road, still passing through the ravine, is very stony, and goes up and down between low gravelly hills. The rate of travelling, accordingly, decreases to 2 miles 6 furlongs. At 5 miles 5 furlongs we strike the river Hajamal, about 150 yards broad, nearly occu pying the whole breadth of the defile, and pass along its western hank. The river then narrows to 30 yards, and the road passes over its pebbly, sandy bed. At 6 miles 1 furlong the road emerges from the bed of the river, which continues to run close on the east side. We then cross two water courses, the dry beds of which, about 20 yards wide, are incrustated with salt, flow eastward to the river Hajamal, At 6 miles 6 furlongs the defile is 300 yards broad, with the river running on the east side at the base of cliffs about 60 feet high, and the106 No. 20.

Remabks. road, on the west, skirting low gravel hills or mounds, which at times form cliffs 60 feet or so in height. At 7 miles 1 furlong we cross the dry stony bed of the river Hajamal, here about 80 yards broad. The ordinary rate of travelling is now resumed. From this point to stage the road very frequently crosses shallow rivulets of salt water, which, however, offer no difficulty whatever. We are now clear of the defile, and the road, trending S. S. E., crosses for 5 furlongs an open and fairly level space, a mile or so in diameter, surrounded by low hills. This place is named “ Derahi.” We then pass over level ground between detached hills, or mounds from 30 to 100 feet high, the tops of which are level like tables. Beyond these are low ranges of hills distant to east about 50 yards, and to west about a mile. At 8 miles 6 furlongs the road is crossing small mounds of earth for over 100 yards, then level spaces between small mounds or hills, the latter, at times, opening out or dis appearing, leaving an open space to the low ranges on the east and west. At 9 miles 6 fur longs we cross the dry bed of a shallow water-course containing pools of salt water, varying from 100 to 200 yards in width ; flow westerly. The road then, passing along its south-west bank for half a mile, enters among low dried up mud hills. These continue for about 1 5 furlongs, when we cross a level open space, and, at 10 miles 5 furlongs, ascend a short and slight slope,_ and pass between a chaos of dried mud hillocks. The hillocks rise directly from the side of the road, which is not, in places, more than 6 to 10 feet broad. It might, however, be easily widened. At 11 miles 3 furlongs the defile, bordered by barren, bare hills, dried mud and gravel, has opened out, and varies from 100 to 200 yards in breadth. The ground, at times gravelly and stony, at other times earthy, is bare of vegetation save for some scattered furze. Two furlongs in advance the road passes the old and rather dila pidated caravansarai of Bastu-Komaku. At 12 miles 6 furlongs we strike the river Hajainal, salt water running, a few inches deep, and 30 to 40 feet broad ; bed varying in width from 150 to 200 yards. The basin is shallow, and banks generally shelving. The road now enters a defile called lang-i-Shuk, about 200 yards broad. The ground is of a stony gravel, with small furze and occasional kanar bush, but devoid of grass. The river Hajamal, distant about 40 yards from the south side of the road, runs at the bottom of a sandstone cliff 120 feet in height. The north side of dafile is bordered by gravel hills 60 to 100 feet high, sloping up at an angle of 20 to 30°. At 13 miles 7 furlongs we pass Sartang caravansarai, and two cisterns, the latter being full of good water. Altitude, 1,144 feet. There is a grove of date trees about a quarter of a mile to N. E. of the caravansarai, also a rivulet of water, the banks of which are overgrown with tamarisk jungle ; a short distance to the eastward the ground rises in steep and precipitous hills. Supplies nil. Water good. Fuel moderate, from tamarisk jungle and date trees. Cultivation nil. Grazing fair. Camping-ground good. The road then runs south-east, and at 1 furlong from the caravansarai, crosses the river Hajamal, which is here called “ Shurwater very shallow, a few inches only in depth. At 14 miles 2 furlongs the road, which is the bed of the river Shur, enters the pass called “ Tang-i- Dalan, ” at this point 60 to 70 yards broad, with perpendicular cliffs on either hand. The breadth of the pass never much exceeds this, and is simply the bed of the river Shur, over which meanders a small stream of salt water. The hills on either side of the Tang are rocky, and either slope up very steeply, or rise in lofty precipices. When one side slopes, the other is perpendicular. The slopes on the eastern side are generally practicable for infantry and mule batteries. The surface of the pass, or river bed, presents a smooth, firm surface of white sand. After traversing the pass for one mile, the total breadth of the gorge is only 30 yards. As we near the eastern mouth of the Tang, the sides of the gorge gradu ally decrease in height, till at 17^ miles they merge in a vale, sparsely covered with grass, upon which, on surmounting a short and gentle slope, we enter. The two dilapidated cara- vansarais of Pas-Par-Dalan, with two cisterns, and a grove of date trees, are close to the south side of the road, and 400 yards to north of a low but steep and rocky range, about 200 feet high, over which a path, for infantry only, leads to the village of Balan, distant107 No. 20.

The village of Dalan possesses a partly ruined caravansarai, and is surrounded by date groves. Supplies little. Water both at Pas-Par and Dalan, plentiful and good, from an aqueduct and three cisterns. Fuel very scanty. Grazing poor. Cultivation little, near village of Dalan. Camping-ground good. General direction E. by S. The road, after 1|; furlongs, crosses the river Shur, water salt, about 6 inches deep, bed 100 yards broad, flow generally to S. E., and then for 7 furlongs skirts the low outlying hills of Kuh Zad Mahmud on the north side of the vale. The ground to the south of the road is covered with stones, and appears liable to inundation from the river. The depth of water would, however, in any case, be very shallow. Kanar bush is now frequent. At 7 furlongs the road leaves the low hills, and crossing two dry and very shallow branches of the river Shur, about 70 and 150 yards broad respectively, passes over very stony and sandy ground, evidently swept by the river at floods. At 2 miles we cross once more two dry and very shallow branches of the river Shur, the united breadth of which is from one-half to one-third of a mile. The ground, stony, and sparsely covered with thin dried up yellow grass, kanar, and furze bush, slopes always south-easterly, and for the next 4 miles 6 furlongs is crossed continually by a succession of small and very shallow water-courses, all of which are dry, and in most cases appear to be worn by mere surface drainage to the river Shur. At 4 miles 2 furlongs we pass the ruins of a caravansarai, named “ Bampan,” and two or three cisterns, the latter containing no water. The hills, on the south side of the valley, are now distant from the road about 2 or 3 miles. At 6 miles 6 furlongs the ground is no longer stony, but consists of a fine sand, and is sparsely clothed with clumps of camel-grass, and a very thin sprinkling of poor yellow grass. The valley here presents a greener aspect, owing to the frequency of kanar trees, and thickets of prickly bush and furze. At 8 miles 7 fui’longs, after crossing the dry sandy bed of a water-course, we pass the cara vansarai and two cisterns of Jihun. The former contains four lower rooms. Supplies nil. Water good, from two cisterns. Fuel moderate. Cultivation nil. Grazing very poor, but camel fodder good. Camping-ground good. After this the valley is bare of vegetation save for a few kanar hushes, and scattered clumps of short coarse grass, the ground consisting of a stony gravel. Low tumular gravelly mounds border the road. At 9 miles 3 furlongs we cross a dry ravine or canon, about 40 feet in breadth, with sides either very steep or perpendicular. Within the next 1 mile 2 furlongs we twice cross the dry, sandy bed of a water-course about 40 feet broad. Low hills, showing a cliff-like section, now run on either side, distant from the road about half a mile to north and one mile to south. At 11^ miles we are passing between low gravel hills or mounds, between which ravines and nalas wind and twist. This continues for 1 furlong, when, ascending a steep bank, we rise from the ravines, and, passing for half a mile over a level surface, again descend, by a steep slope, into another labyrinth of ravines similar to those previously passed. The road lies over mounds of dry mud and gravel. At 12 miles 5 furlongs we ascend from the ravines by a steep ascent, cross some undulating ground, and at 13 miles 2 furlongs, traverse a level part of the valley with the ravines, on either side of the road, at a distance of a few hundred yards. The ground is now stony and sandy, sparsely covered with very thin yellow grass and small scrub. This continues for 2 furlongs. Within the next 5 furlongs the road twice descends into, and ascends from, a labyrinth of stony ravines. At 14 miles we once more descend into a ravine, about 175 yards broad, of which the south side is bordered by a clayey sandstone cliff, and the north by low tumular mounds. A water-course, 40 feet in breadth, containing pools of brackish water, flows to north-east on the north side of the defile, which narrows in as we advance. At 14 miles 3 furlongs the road passes along the bed of this water-course. The defile at its north-103 No. 20. Bushahr to Bandar Abbas. Distanck, iw No. of stage. MILKS. Names of stages.

At 15 miles 2 furlongs the ravine suddenly trends eastward, and we ascend by a steep and stony slope to the general level of the valley. The rate of travelling, when tra* versing these ravines, decreases to 2 miles 2'3 furlongs per hour. The caravansarai and one cistern of Birka Noh, are both in good repair, and the latter is full of good water. There is a large extent of open ground about the caravansarai. To north of this open space the ground is cut up by a net-work of dry water-courses, and mounds covered with grass and thickets of hanar and other small trees. On all other sides the surface of the valley is much broken by ravines, low gravelly hills, etc. Wild pigeon plentiful Supplies nil. Water good, from one large cistern.

The road, which is stony, proceeds at first along open ground ; but this gradually slopes downwards, till we are passing through a shallow basin with sloping sides. The road runs along the north side of the ravine, which is 250 yards broad, and narrows in as we advance, to 70 yards. On the south side the ravine is bordered by very stony, low, sandstone hills or mounds, 50 to 100 feet high, sloping up at angles of 10 u to 45°, and at times presenting a cliff-like section. On the north side there is a low bank gently sloping up to the level of the valley. To the south of the road, the ground slopes down steeply to the bottom of the ravine. Within 1 mile 7 furlongs, the road crosses two dry and shallow water-courses, and 2 furlongs further on a small rivulet of good fresh water, flow of all from north to the bottom of the ravine, which slopes gently downwards in the direction of the course. At 2| miles the ravine has again widened out, and is now about 150 yards broad. A glacis-like slope from the level of the valley now touches the road on the north side. At 3 miles 2 furlongs we twice cross the stony bed, con« taining water in pools of the stream Shivirawun, that had been running down the ravine, immediately to south of the track. Within another 200 yards the road passes the caravan- sarai and cistern of Taki Khani, both of which are in good repair, and the latter full of sweet water. On the south bank of the stream Shivirawun is a second cistern containing, by native report, good water. Supolies nil. Water good and plentiful, from a cistern. Fuel moderate, from small bush.

Half a mile in advance this breadth diminishes to 7&lt;) or 80 yards, and the cliffs give place to low tumular undulations. After leaving the caravansarai of Taki Khani we pass along the north bank of the stream Shivirawun, breadth of water, which is saltish, about 30 yards, and depth 6 inches, banks perpendicular, about 3 or 4 feet high. This stream we twice cross, and at 4 miles ascend by a steep slope to the level of the valley. The road, now good and hard, but not excessively stony as it has been hitherto, traverses a vale about half a mile broad, sparsely covered with short dried up grass, bounded to south by a labyrinth of deep and broad ravines backed by low ranges of hills, and to north by a spur from Kuh Zad Mahmud, formed of inclined sandstone strata dipping southward, and called “ Kisbi.” Proceeding thus for two miles and a half the road becomes stony. At 7 miles 3 furlongs we pass the caravansarai, and two large cisterns of Kishidari, all in good order, and the latter full of water. Altitude, 423 feet. The summit of the spur Kishi, to north-east of the caravansarai, is 430 feet above the ground level of the cisterns. Supplies nil, but might be collected from surrounding villages.

Note. —From a mound immediately to north-east of the cisterns of Karistan a pass named “ Tang Abad,” leading through the range Gishu, bears E. by N. ^ N. We are now traversing the main valley, distant from the low rocky bills to south about 1 J miles, and from the lofty, rocky, and rugged range of Gishu to north about 3 miles. The ground is of a limy clay mixed with sand, and is sparsely covered with thin, dried up, yellow grass. The thickets of kanar, kahur trees, etc., which have dotted the valley rather thickly since Birka Sultan, now, as we advance, thin out, and finally disappear. At 5 miles a line of kanats, conveying good water from the range Gishu crosses the road from the north side, and 1 mile 2 furlongs further on, these kanats again cross our track from the south. At 6 miles 3 furlongs we cross a huge, dry nala or water-course, flow to south east. The basin of dry clay, utterly devoid of stones is about 150 yards broad, and 16 feet deep in the centre. The southern bank shelves, whereas the northern is steep. The road now traverses, for about 200 yards, fields of wheat and barley. We then pass a dilapidated mud and stone fort, called “Kala Poro,” inhabited by a few villagers, and cross a tract covered with short grass, generally level, but scored and furrowed, apparently by the action of running water. At 10 miles 2 furlongs, descending, by an abrupt slope, to a level lower, by about 15 feet, than that we bad been traversing, we come to a cistern, called “ Birka Daraz,” in good repair, and full of water. The road now crosses a level and even tract covered with very short grass,—apparently an ancient river basin. At 10 miles 7 fur longs a dry nala, 10 feet deep, is crossed ; flow to south ; banks of friable clay, 4 or 5 feet high, and perpendicular in places ; breadth of bed, which consists of fine sand, 20 to 30 feet. At 12 miles 1 furlong we pass a caravansarai and two cisterns known as “ Jungui (?),’* and one and-a-half miles further on the two cisterns and village of Beraemi, close to the south side of the road. At 13 miles 7 furlongs two large groves of date trees are on either110 No. 20. Bushahr to Bandar Abbas. Distance, in miles. Names of stages. Inter mediate. Total. Eemabks, M. F. M. F. hand, distant about 50 and 100 yards to north and south respectively. Another 5 furlongs, and, descending the banks of the river Shur, we cross the dry portion of its bed, covered with an efflorescence of salt, and consisting of a limy clay of a whitish yellowish colour. The large date groves lying near the foot of Kuh Gishu, are distant about 1| miles to north. These groves are skirted, on their southern side, by the river Shur. At 15 miles 2 furlongs we ford the river ; bed firm and sandy ; breadth of water, which is upd,o a horse’s girths, about 60 yards. The eastern banks of the river, composed of a fine, deep sand, and, in places, of sandy clay, slope up, for the distance of 200 yards or so, from the water’s edge, at an angle of about 7°, and then merge in an undulating, and billowy, sandy plain. There is a substantial stone bridge, with about 33 piers and semi-circular arches, half a mile down the river to south of the ford. At the time of our passage, the bridge happened to be impassable, owing to damage caused by recent floods. Having passed the ford, we traverse, to the southward, the eastern bank, till we strike the main road, which crosses the river by the above mentioned bridge. The road then trends eastward, and passes through an outcrop of sandy limestone strata about 15 feet high, running S. W. by S. and N. E. by N. which here, for some hundreds of yards, lines, like a rampart, the summit of the eastern bank of the river. The caravansarai and two cisterns of Latitun are in good repair, and the latter full of water. Opposite to the caravansarai, and lining the south side of the road for about half a mile are date groves, surrounded by high earth bunds forming redoubt-like enclosures. These date groves extend southward., for at least 2 miles, along the eastern bank of the river. The scattered hamlet of Latitun, consisting of about 40 mat huts, is situated on a green, grassy plain, screened from the road and caravansarai by date plantations, and bears from the latter b. S. E., distant about three-quarters of a mile. Here, by native report, drinkable water is found four fathoms below the surface. Supplies, excepting dates, very scanty. Water good and plentiful, from two cisterns ; also from wells, said by natives to be drink able. Fuel from date trees, otherwise only furze and scanty brushwood. No cultivation observed, except dates. Grazing fair ; camel fodder apparently plentiful. Camping-ground good. Note.^ —From the ridge of an outcrop of rocky strata bearing from the caravansarai of Latitun S. E. ^ S., distant about 250 yards, Tang Abad, a pass through the range Gishu, bears N. N.

To south low, gravelly hills, dis tant 1£ miles, extending eastward from the river Shur, approach the road diagonally. The path lies over a level tract consisting of a whitish limy clay. Advancing 3 furlongs we clear the date plantations, that had lined the south side of the road for the last half mile. Another 3 furlongs, and the low hills to south are distant about 300 yards, and so continue. At 1 mile the road crosses a narrow, deepish gully, containing no water, flow to N. W. and, 5 furlongs in advance, is passing among low mounds of whitish limy clay. At 2^ miles the ground between these mounds is deeply coated with fine sand. ^ ellow, dried up grass, sparsely scattered here and there, with occasional hahur , furze, and scrub, is the only vegetation to be seen. Since leaving Latitun, the road has crossed about eight dry water-courses, choked with sand, and not more than 1 foot deep. Of four of these, the breadth was about 15 yards, that of the rest insignificant. The slope of the ground, generally, is from S. E. to N. W. At 6 miles 1 furlong the road crosses a very shallow water-course, choked with sand and about 60 yards broad. On its eastern bank we pass the ruins of a caravansarai, and a well, which latter, by native report, contains drinkable water. Another furlongs brings us to an old and dilapidated caravansarai, and at 6 miles 3| furlongs we pass the large cistern of Gatchin. Altitude, 3 feet.Bushahr to Bandar Abbas. Distance, in miles.

To south of this cistern, distant 1 mile, is the scattered village of Gatchin, containing about 100 houses, half of these, perhaps, being built neatly of mud and stone, and the rest of date mats, etc. To north of the village are date groves : a short distance to east the low rocky range called “Gatchin,” with numerous Am?* trees at its foot. Inhabitants about 400. Supplies proportional to number of inhabitants. Water good and plentiful, from large cistern. Fuel moderate, from kahur and date trees, etc. Cultivation, none observed.

Note. —From a mound bearing from the large cistern of Gatchin W. ^ S., distant about 160 yai-ds, the pass called Tang Abad, through the range Gishu, bears N. by W. | W. ; and Tang Kalpurahi or otherwise Tang-i-Khur, through Kuh Pal-i-Khamir bears S. S. W. Having passed the cistern of Gatchin, we approach diagonally the low range, of the same name, to east. At 6 miles 6 furlongs the road crosses a dry gully, or rather canon, banks perpendicular and 20 feet deep, width 2 feet flow to south; and 100 yards further on a small water-course from N. N. E. to W. S. W. This latter at 1 the point of crossing is joined by another water-course from the east; banks of both perpendicular, 2 or 3 feet deep, cut in the fine limy clay soil ; beds 25 to 30 feet in breadth, strewn with fine sand. A large, dry water-course, flow from E. by N. to S. W. by W., now appears about 30 yards to south of the track ; north banks perpendicular, of limy clay ; depth of basin 8 feet, and breadth 40 yards. Since leaving the Gatchin cistern the ground is sparsely dotted with small brushwood, neither trees, large bush nor grass being met with. At 7 miles we cross a small, dry water-course, 20 feet wide, flow to S., and 200 yards in advance the larger one mentioned above, flow now from N. N. E. The road then skirts, in a north-east direction, the foot of the low range Gatchin. At 8 miles 1 furlong rounding these rocks, the direction changes to easterly, and we enter the main pass, called “ Tang-i-Chakabak,” cutting through the range Gatchin. The entrance of the pass is about 2,300 yards broad. The hills to north and south, distant from the track 2,000 and 3,000 yards respectively, are perfectly bare and barren, and present either a perpendicular section or a very steep slope. The ground, now hard and sandy, is perfectly destitute of vegetation save for a few small bushes thinly scattered. At 9 miles we cross a dry, shallow water course, about 27 yards wide, flow to N. W. Half a mile in advance the ground is of a very light bluish clay, mixed with such a proportion of gravel as to make the road gritty. On the north, the pass is flanked by a nearly perpendicular section of the range ; on the south, the range Gatchin slopes up steeply, and from its foot low hills or hillocks crowd the ground, gradually decreasing in height, till, at the road side, they merge into pyramidal or conical heaps of loose limy earth from 20 to 40 feet high. At 10 miles the ground becomes very broken, and the road mounts, for the next 170 yards, by a short but steep and rugged pass to a small, open, stony space, in which, at 10 miles 1 furlong, we find a cistern called “ Birkeh Mirzai,” full of good water. Altitude, 121 feet. The pass, which is here much broken and blocked by a labyrinth of dried up limy clay mud hillocks, pyramidal or conical in shape, is about 1,700 yards in breadth, the cistern Birkeh Mirzai being distant 200 yards from the steeply sloping or perpendicular hills on the south side. The range on either hand reaches an altitude of about 300 feet. Supplies nil. Water dependent on one cistern, which was full at the time of our visit. Fuel nil. Culti vation nil. Grazing nil. Camping-grounds good for any number of men. Note.— From the top of a hill bearing from Birkeh Mirzai S. E. i S., distant about 440 yards, the pass, Tang Abad, through the range Gishu bears N.W. 5 N.; and Tang-i- Khur or Kalpurahi through Kuh Pal-i-Khamir W. by S. | S. On passing Birkeh Mirzai (cistern) we traverse a fairly easy road between dried up mud hillocks of earthy gypsum. At 10 miles 7'5 furlongs the pass, for the next 150 yards, alternately rising and descending, becomes more difficult, though still not bad. Another 2^ furlongs, and the small mud hillocks clear off, leaving a broad, open space of 1 mile extending to the hills bordering the north side of the pass, and another of 600 to 800 yards, to those bordering the south side. At 12 miles 3 furlongs the road ascends a low upheaval* For road from Lingah to Bandar Abbas, along the eea coast, «ee end of this route, page 113, 112 of limestone, and then descends oyer the glacis-like slope of the strata, for a distance of about 30 feet, to a smooth, gravelly, and stony plain stretching to the sea. As we advance and clear the hills of the pass, the gravel and stone disappear, and give place to a fine sand. At the point of exit from the pass (the upheaved limestone strata just crossed), the hills to south are distant about 600 yards, and those to north 1,100. These ranges, as we advance gradually sinking into the plain, form the horns of a crescent, which is open to the eastward. At 12 miles 5 furlongs a dry water-course appears to north of the road, and then runs off to east. One mile 6| furlongs in advance, the road crosses this water-course, flow to south-west, bed shallow, of a sandy whitish clay, and about 20 yards in breadth. The caravansarai and cistern of Chesterneh, are both in good repair, and the latter full of sweet water. Supplies nil. Water from one cistern. Fuel moderate, from small bush and brambles. Cultivation nil. Grazing very poor, from thin, dried up, yellow grass. Camping, grounds good. 30 Bandab Abbas* 30'. 15-4 438— 3-4 General direction E. | N. The road over a sandy, clayey ground, thinly clothed with dried up, yellow grass, passes for 1 mile through a low jungle of very small bushes. At 1 mile we cross a shallow water-course, flow to north-east, bed dry, and about 20 yards wide. Another 2 furlongs, and rocks, formed by the out-crop or upheaval of strata, rising to the height of, say, 30 to 50 feet, touch the south side of the road. These outcrops, strid ing in a N. by E. direction across the plain from the southern extremity of tiie low range of Kuh Gatchin to south, dip, i e., slope, at an angle of about 30° to the east. The western faces of the upheaved strata are abrupt and precipitous. We then pass through a labyrinth of such upheavals. On the north side of the road, distant 800 to 1,000 yards, low mounds stretch away to the north-east, to the foot of the range Gatchin. At 1 mile 5 fur longs the road, over very sandy ground, enters a defile, 60 yards broad increasing to 150, running north-east between upheavals of rocky strata similar to those already described. The whole plain, hereabouts, is broken up into similar defiles, running parallel to one an other, and varying in breadth from 50 to 200 yards. At 3 miles these rocky feature-', on the north side of the road at least, are merged in the general level of the plain, though they still continue to south at a distance of 150 yards. We then pass over a level plain, dotted with small kanar and other bush. Two hundred yards to north of the road extend large groves of date trees. Advancing thus 3 furlongs, the road crosses a dry water-course, 10 vards wideband 170 yards further on, another, bed about 30 yards broad, containing pools of brackish water; flow of both southerly. At 3 miles 5 furlongs we pass a carayansarai arid a large cistern, called ** Khana Surkh,” The cistern contains good water, but its roof is in a broken and ruined state. Supplies nil. Water good and plentiful, from one large cistern. Fuel moderate, from furze, bramble, and date trees. Cultivation nil Grazing poor. Camping-grounds good. At 4 miles we are traversing a sandy tract, dotted with furze, bramble bush, and sparse clumps of coarse grass. To south, at a distance of 600 yards, date plantations border the road. To north a low ridge of upbeaved strata, distant 200 yards, approaches our path diagonally. At 4 miles 2 furlongs a long, low, sand and gravel hillock, or rather mound, runs along the south side of the road. This is succeeded by a plantation of young date trees fenced off by a low stone wall. One mile 1 furlong further on, the sandy maidan and low jungle cease, and we enter upon ground broken up by low mounds, nalat, etc. A dry water-conrse, on the north side of the road, runs to east. At 6 miles this nala, turned by slightly rising ground, trends to north-east. We then pass the cistern and rumed caravansarai of “Band Ali,” the former apparently in good repair, and, for 100 yards or so, traverse broken ground, intersected by gullies, amid low hillocks’of sand and sun-baked clay. The mounds of sand to south of the road then merge in the113 No. 20. Bushahr to Bandar Abbas. Distance, in miles. No. of stage. Total, Rbmabks. M. f, M. F. surface, and afford a view of the sea, distant about half a mile, and of the adjacent islands of Hormuz and Kishm. The former appears as a white rock, with peaks rising to the height of 700 feet. The ground, now, on either side of the road, is dotted with shrubs and low jungle, that to north being broken and intersected, as described above, by upheavals of inclined rocky strata. As we advance, the road, which is very sandy with a substratum of whitish limy clay, gradually increases its distance from the coast. At 6 miles 4 furlongs we cross a dry shallow water-course, about 60 yards broad, emptying into the sea. Another 1^ miles, and we come to a large date grove, and 3 or 4 mat houses, named “ Gulistan,” immediately to south of the track. Supplies practically nil. Water believed to be procurable, but quantity and quality uncertain. Fuel moderate from brush-wood and date trees. Cultivation, dates ; wheat and barley by native report, poor and of small extent. Grazing very scanty indeed. Camping-ground good. At 11 miles 1 furlong a grove of young date trees, called “ Murkh Zarri,” or “Murgh Garri,” touches the north side of the road. Proceeding another 1 mile 3 furlongs we cross a very shallow water-course, bed, about 350 yards broad, of sand, damp with the recent passage of water, apparently salt or brackish, flow to sea close by. At 12 miles 3 furlongs the village of Saru, about a quarter of a mile to south of the road, from which it is screened by groves of date trees, and, at its south-east corner, by a thick growth of tall kahur trees. Immediately to south of the road is a long, low mound of some considerable area, covered with a jungle of kahur, etc., and to north small, well-kept plantations of young date trees, surrounded by neat mud-brick walls. The village of Saru is open to the sea breeze. Its bouses, glancing white through the screen of trees, are apparently constructed of stone and lime. The village seems to be the garden of Bandar Abbas, and to be used by the well-to-do inhabitants of the latter place as a summer or suburban residence. Supplies plentiful, from the neighbouring town of Bandar Abbas. Water by native report, plentiful. Fuel plentiful. Cultivation poor. Graz ing very scanty. Camping-ground good. The ground on either side of the road is sandy with a very slight sprinkling of grass. The broken ground, and upheavals of gravelly limestone strata, forming low hills, are now distant to north about half a mile. Four furlongs after leaving the date groves of Saru, the road traverses a track of ploughed land, and at 15 miles passes the cistern called '* Bandar,” in good repair, and full of water. Two hundred yards further on there is another cistern, which appears, however, to be in a ruined state. At 15^ miles we enter the ancient, but now ruined, walls of Bandar Abbas. A full description of the town is to be found in the Persian Gulf Pilot, and the Gazet teer of Persia. Supplies plentiful. Water plentiful, from cistems. Fuel plentiful. Cultivation, excepting dates, little, and what there is, very poor owing to the sandy soil. Grazing scanty. Camping-grounds very good. No. 20A.

One well, good water : several others fit for animals. Firewood rather scanty. Good camping ground everywhere. Road to this point easy going for all arms. Nothing to retard rate of marching in dry weather. Peak of Khormuj good landmark. Gurak ridge, which the road is shown as crossing in the map, is important as offer ing a position facing south-west to a force advancing on Bushahr from the east or south-east. It commands the low-lying sandy grounds towards Bushahr, and has a mean elevation of about 300' above the level of the plain. The northern or right Hank is the weakest, and is open to a turning movement under cover of date plantations. This same ridge would also afford a position facing north-east to a force covering Bushahr against a force advancing from the east. Its extreme length would necessitate, however, a very strong body of troops to occupy it properly. It would afford some good artillery positions covering the plain towards the main mountain ranges. The lower ground is also very suitable for the movement of cavalry, an unusual thing in this part of Persia.

Valley well cultivated as before, chiefly with barley. At 4$ miles rounds spur of a range of hills to the north, and then turns nearly due east, leaving small village of Bedar 1| miles to the south. At 6 miles reaches small na7a with deep bed. Up to this point there are no difficulties to retard marching; but the track from now on broken and very bad in places. A large nala with high precipitous banks is passed at miles. Road ascends slightly through a country covered with scorched-up grass and dotted with low thorn bushes. Passes at 8£ miles another smaller nala, and continues on towaids a peculiar shaped precipitous bluff, which makes a good landmark ; kept halt left. About this point 2 miles to the south commences a high rocky range of hills. The track continues to ascend gradually through country broken up into small hillocks and ridges. At 8f miles another nala which would retard artillery. Track arrives near bluft above mentioned at 9 A miles. Road to Farashband here branches off to the north. Rounding ti e bluff, tins road is better than the direct one, and so more generally used, but it is a/brsaH longer. The direct road descends from this point.

A small brackish stream crossed at 7* miles, flowing into a larger one, which follows the line of road closely for some distance on the south side, and is fringed with a growth of high rushes. Gradual, but steady, descent now commences down to valley of Kumryakh. Ranges of hills about a mile oflfon either hand running nearly parallel. Level valley reached at 8 miles, triangular in shape, surrounded by hills, covered with scattered bushes and cultivation. Road through valley up to village very easy and good. Village of Kumryakh, only 15 houses. Moderate supplies. Cows, sheep, barley, bhusa and firewood. Plenty of camping ground. Water good. Road at first very good, and leads along valley east to foot of low range of hills, which it ascends by a very rough stonv track. Fairly easy gradient. Top of pass at If miles. Ruined caravansurai nearly buried in sand. Descend from here by gentle slope towards the next pass seen in the distance. Road, broad, level, and good. A fine plain stretches away to the north-west.

Road rounds the end of an outlying rocky ridge at 5f miles, and from now on condition becomes worse and worse. At 6 miles steep ascent commences to top of pass. Great masses of rock and loose stones everywhere. Rate of marching slow; totally unfit for guns. Average gradient 7°. This side of the range of hills precipitous and inaccessible cliffs. Top of pass reached at 8 f miles. Descent from here for first mile good and easy going though stony in places. Bottom reached at lOf miles. A small stream crossed, water of which fair. Road now crosses a rocky ridge running down centre of valley, and then ascends the opposite range, zigzagging up, steep and very bad, unfit throughout for field guns. Rate of marching, even for very small body of troops, would not exceed 2 miles an hour. At entrance to Kolpzaanum pass ruined caravansarai and spring of excellent water with stream for animals. Very little camping ground, as ground is much broken. Firewood obtainable in small quantities. No inhabitants anywhere near. Height about 3,600 feet.

General direction south-east. Firuzabad, a small town, 600 houses, popn. lation 2 , 000 ; including outlying villages 3,000. Inhabitants mostly engaged in fiuit farming and cultivation A few carpet makers. Supplies here good, far above the average, Rice, gram and barley are exported into surrounding country, and fruits and rose water to Bushahr. There are about 50 horses and a few ponies, but some thousands of donkeys could be collected here, as there are large numbers employed on the caravan routes, mules being very rarely seen in these parts. There is excellent camping ground for a very large force here, and abundance of good water for men and animals. Firewood in large quantities could be procured from Maitnan, where they say there is any amount of wood of all sorts. The ruling Khan of the district, resides here in large wailed house on the outskirts of the town. The whole of the plain around the town is extremely fertile, and for Persia well inhabited. Total value of exports annually does not exceed R4,000, Altogether this is the best place along this route. The heat is never excessive, and climate generally healthy. The peoole are civil and disposed to be friendly. Its chief important from a military point of view would be that it is admirably suited for a halting place and supply depdt. 9 Arab. 14J 133| Most direct route to Jahrum leads south-east down broad valley, open country, easy going; Ion? ridges of hills on either hand.

High precipices on either hand. Path not verv rough, but narrow and winding.* Road emerges from defile at miles. A spring and stream of good water here, and a garden belonging to village of Rudbar, which is situated high up on the hill side, about 1 mile to north-west of this point. Road doe&lt; not pass by this village, but leads down valley. Ground rough and undulating; track a mere footpath, very narrow and difficult in places. Down in the low ground to south runs the river from Firuzabad, the course of which about this point is identical with that of road. Village of Arab is situated on right bank of river about 200' above it on hill side. The chief cultivation here is rice. Small supplies of cows, sheep and rice.

Road still follows its course on right bank crossing the range by a very rough steep pass unfit for field guns. At miles village of Madkun, situated on the opposite or left bank of stream, enclosed in square of mud walls. Large patches of rice cultivation around it. Road emerges from defile at 6 miles, and crosses stream. Only about a foot of water at this time of year. Banks at this point steep and high. Bed of stream stony. On the high ground above the left bank caravansarai in good repair. From here road keeps a north-east direction, and gradually descends towards the centre of an open stretch of country situated between two parallel ranges of hills. At 8 miles steep descent of an underfeature to low-lying ground. At 9| miles village of Tullamataki, lying ebout 1 mile to north. Small and poor enclosed in mud walls. Half a mile further road crosses fine stream of good water flowing south-east. About 50 yards broad at this point. Banks low, bed gravelly, only 2 to 2£ feet of water in hot season, but likely to become impassable after rain. Current swift. At 11 miles village of Manun, consisting of a few huts enclosed in square of mud walls. Supplies small. From here road bends in a south-east direction, and follows general direction of main valley. Numerous small underfeatures and knolls. Nothing to retard marching. Village of Yarg similar in character to the three villages just described. About 30 families. A small fruit garden and a good stream of water. Other supplies indifferent. From Firuzabad to this point there is an excellent supply of water the whole way. About the villages the chief cultivation is rice. 12 Jahrum.* 22 191| Leaving Yarg, road to Jahrum continues south east alonir valley over undulating underfeatures.

Road now descends to Jahrum plain,122 No. 22. Bushahr to Nihiz, via Jahrum and Fasta. No. of stage. Distance, in MILKS. Names of stages. Inter mediate. Total. Remabks. which is very extensive, quite flat, barren, and rather stony, but quite fit for all arms to move freely about it. Good road. Leads up to west gate of Jahrum. From Firuzabad the road presents no great difficulties, but in its present state it is not to be recommended for field guns, as it is in many places so narrow as to barely permit -of a single loaded mule passing. Only very moderate supplies can be depended on. Stages are long, but water-supply good throughout, except in last stage into Jahrum. All the gradients, however, are so very slight that the road might easily be made a good one. Jahrura, situated in an extensive plain close under northern slope of Kuh Bafra, enclosed in mud walls in a very dilapidated condition. The numbers of date gardens inside the town walls give it a green appearance from a distance, and also make it appear larger than it really is. It is very hot and dusty here during the summer months, and even in winter no snow remains on the hills around it. Population said to be 10.000. Considerable supplies could be collected here. Cattle, sheep, goats, grain, bhusa, dates, and vegetables ; firewood scarce in the immediate vicinity, but procurable at moderate distances. Good camping ground for a force of any size. Water here requires care, as, though there is a fair supply of good water, there are several wells which contain very bad water. Post office here, with Postmaster, native of Tehran. Two posts weekly—one to northern and another to southern places. A Persian garrison here of 50 infantry soldiers under the command of a captain. Two large caravansarais—one outside the town walls; the other in the centre of the town. Bazaar fairly good, but not so extensive as might be expected in so large a place. Por transport there are numbers of donkeys available here, but very few mules. There were a few ponies also of the right stamp employed in caravan work. 13 Bab Abab 13 204| Leaving Jahrum, road to Fasa and Niriz branch* es off immediately from road to Shiraz, and leads up the plain in north-east direction. Condition good. Rate of marching quick. Troops could move on broad front. Village of Haidarabad at 3J miles about one mile to west of route. Large gardens and date groves near it. At miles road turns east and crosses small ridge, leaving small village of Dasir about 3 miles to north. Half a mile further small stream of fresh water flows across road into large circular huoz. Country still open. Track level and good going. Ci'oss large stream of brackish water at 9f miles. A small stream, which joins it here on the left bank, is, however, fresh water. Leaving this stream, country improves. There is a fair amount of cultivation and a system of surface irrigation channels used for rice cultivation, also appeared to have been grown in places. Village of Bab Arab enclosed in a square of high mud walls, about 100 yards to a face with small turrets at intervals. Small date grove to east of village. Water here in plenty from stream, slightly brackish, but drinkable. Water mill in good order near the date grove. Fair supplies of grain here. Rice, barley, bhusa, znijutvari. A few cows and sheep. Kelat Tawa, with a garrison of 100 Persian soldiers, is about 11 miles to the south-east. 14 Zahbdeh 13i 218 Road very good. Slight upward gradient. Direction at first east. Passes north of small village of Kamshi and Chahartagh. Direction gradually changes to north, and track passes through low range of hills, and enters another broad plain, stretching away to south-east. Perfectly open and fit for all arms to move anywhere over it- At Gy miles village of Khusk, situated about 1| miles to east, with ruins of a former village close by. At 8 miles an outlying spur is crossed, ascent quite practicable for field guns, which could be got in position here so as to command the low lying ground descending from here. At 9| miles a stream of water crossed which comes right down from Fasa. Road here bifurcates, the most direct track passing straight over the hills ; but this is rough and little used, though 4 miles shorter, except in the wet season, when the other track becomes very swampy. This latter takes a westerly direction, leaving villages of Kasirabad and Miandeh to north.123 No. 22. Bush ah r to Niriz. via Jahtum and Fusa. Distance, in MILKS. Rkmabks. No. of stage.

Zahrdeb is a large village, with Lit gardens and a few date palms, and a quantity of cultivation around it so that ''lies of grain are assured. There are also at least 100 cows, and from 300 to 400 sheep and goats available. A large white domed tomb close to village on north-west side forms a good landmark for these parts. 17 i 235 Leaving Zabrdeh road leads north of west. Passes conspicuous white dome of a tomb. Condition of track very good at this Imt time of year ; but owing to superabundance of water-supply, liable to become impassable during rainy weather. Whole country well culti vated. Village of Ferdisbkuh at 4 miles. This is a large village, with extensive fruit gardens and excellent cultivation. Supplies here very good. Water abundant. About 1 5 miles to the east is the smaller village of Cbannakuh, also thriving and prosperous. Leaving b erdishkuh, road turns north Condition still good. Reaches entrance to smah pass. A little difficult m places during the passage of this, owing to the numerous water-courses which intersect, but Jo steep gradients. The ground rises very gradually right up to Fasa. On emerging from pass the fertile plain of Fasa is reached, well cultivated and dotted over with numerous small vidages and camps of lliyats. At 11 miles village of Mardabad enclosed m a square of mud walls. Continue on north over the open plain Cross small stream at 13, miles and reach Kelat Zuhak, a small village with 40 inhabitants. Track crosses bed of deep nala with shelving banks, from which most of the water has been drawn off for irrigation purposes On ri-ht bank of this nala is the village of Deb Dashtak or Khairabad. Road passess through it, and goes due north to Fasa Fairly easy going, but the surface irrigation channels occasionally present obstacles, and would hamper the movement ot held guns. Road throughout from Jahrum very good. No steep gradients or stones ; m fact the whole way is over a succession of plains, rising with an almost imperceptible slope. Troops could move easily on this route. The only things to impede artillery are the irrigation channels which cross the road. These, as a rule, are only spanned by a bridge about 1 yard wide. Some places also in wet weather get very deep and sticky, basa has a population of 4,000. Its principal trade is in onium and tobacco, which go to Shiraz.

Supplies are excellent. There is a very good bazar thatched in with boughs, with stream of water running down the centre, t ruit, vegetables, and lucerne grass are especially good here, and all the ordinary supplies are obtainable in considerable quantities from the surrounding country and villages. There aie two caravan- sarais, and a po&gt;t office was started ; but as no one used it, it was done away with, ihe t&lt; wn is governed by a 'noib, who also governs the neighbouiing small villages.

At the ani mountains by a bad and difficult pass, called Gudar-i-Nal^ Shikan ?the Destroyer of Horse-shoes), from whence Jahrum bears 75°. A few minutes labour brought us to the summit. These mountains extend N. W. and S. B., and ^ths of a mile north of them is a parallel range ; but neither is of great height. The descent l^d us through a broad valley, which finally terminated in a country of low hills and valleys. The IO 3 mile brought us to another pass, called Kasalu, which led us by a descent into the district of Karzin. One mile farther brought us to a second descent over very rough ground, and we entered a narrow, rough valley over the worst piece of road I have ever encountered. Our horses, though led, were scarcely able to maintain their footing, and plunged violently. At* the 16th mile we descended towards the small but pretty vale of Muharakabad, extending E. and W., and generally covered with green turf and bushes of kanar. It is several miles in length, but of inconsiderable width, probably not more than 1 ^ miles.

Occasion ally a few black tents of the Kashkai tribe were passed and, at the abovementioned distance, the small village Gherghaoun, 1 mile to the left, inhabited by a race called Kulu who are said to he descendants of negroes. The 12th mile led us to Aliabad, a ruined village con taining only five or six families, and an Imamzadah. 1 i. The 183 mile brought us to a river, flowing north and south for a short space, about 100 yards in breadth, and in parts nearly up to the horses’ girths. . , , After fording the river, we presently came again to its right bank by a bend it had taken, and proceeded near and parallel to it, but with a high ridge of rocks between it and us for about 2 miles, when we passed the remains of a fort in those rocks, called Pir An, and the village Lifarjan. Thence we skirted the hills on our right for ftbs of a mile, which brought us to the village Pedam. This jart of the plain is extensively cultivated, and has a very pleasing appearance with its fields and groves. The 18| mile brought us to the gioves and ruined village of Kala Kulu Kellahi, near which rises a remarkable-looking rock ; then passing more groves we reached, at about the 20th mile, the village Kurshu, paitly in ruins, but possessing also extensive plantations, and | a mile beyond, the village of Sagdawan. Thence we made about frds of a mile to the camp of the 11 Begi. Babbonej . 25 62 To the village Kir, and thence over stony ground, the plain lessening as we advanced westward, and may be said to terminate at about the 6 | mile W. of Kir. We then ascended between parallel ranges of hills for about 4 miles; then descending about 2 miles by an execrable road through a valley, entered a partly cultivated vale, possessing palm groves, a little stream, and a growth of reeds, etc. The 12§ mile brought us to the village Bagh Pisarlar, then deserted. Shortly after we crossed hills and undulating country, more or less clothed with bushes. At about the 20th mile we ascended through a pretty vale, in which there was abundant pasturage, and consequently numerous scattered encampments of Ilijats. The little hamlet of Barbonej, with garden land attached, occurred at the 25th mile. 4 Fibuzabad 30 92 At the end of the 2 nd mile, we ascended through hills by a stony hard road; and towards the 3rd mile commenced a great ascent over mountains, the road varying so much as between N. and126 No. 22A.

E. across the hill for a distance of about 3 miles. This is a very difficult pass, the road leading generally over bare, slippery rock, on which the cattle scarcely maintain a footing, and where ledges of rock crossing the path, or steep rises and falls, add to the difficulty. We descended towards the end of the 6 th mile. Close by our left was a broad and mag nificent chasm, through which the Piruzabad stream flows southward, the sides of tiie gulf in some parts several hundred feet in perpendicular height. The scenery, as we descend ed, increased in grandeur, and the path, leading constantly over bare, slippery rock and dangerous inequalities, made it frequently necessary to dismount. Towards the 11th mile we reached the termination of the descent, where the Firuzabad stream enters the deep chasm. This is a fine, clear rivulet, pretty at this part, and perhaps 30 paces wide, and is here joined by a streamlet from the N. W. All the country we had passed thus far to-day was more or less sprinkled with hushes. We made a slight ascent, and then got into the vale through which the stream flows, and ascended by it. The vale itself is under cultivation. The 20th mile brought ns to a small ravine fall of trees and myrtle bushes, close to which is the small village of Rudbar. We then proceeded through a fine and very remarkable mountain pass, some 250 yards in breadth, the rocks on either side rising to an elevation probably of 500 feet, and for the most part nearly perpendicular. This led into the vale of Tidasht, at the 22| mile It is I 5 to 2 miles in breadth, runs from N. W. to S. E., and is for the most part under cultivation. The district of Maiman lay between N and N. E. of this, beyond high mountains. The vale is interrupted towards its N. W. extremity by a line of hills running a short distance through its centre longitudinally ; and at the 27mile we came abreast of a high rock rising at the extremity of the vale, to the N. E. of which, at a mile distant, is the small village of Tidasht, lying under the hills. Then about 2 miles across the plain to Firuzabad. No. 22B. Darab to Jahrum.

Subsequently the road led through ravines, into a fine plain belonging to the district of Fasa, extending in length some 15 miles from north-west to south-east, by about 5 miles in breadth.

I _The ordinary coast route from Abram vid, Khurmij along the low lying ground under the mountain ranges. . XI.—Into the Kahviz valley .—The character of this valley is peculiar, lying between the high Khurmij range and another precipitous range. The intervening space is filled up by a succession of sharp limestone ridges, gradually decreasing in height towards the centre of the valley. Numerous streams, many of them salt, flow between the ridges, and drain down to Ahram. The village of Kahviz is situated high up on east slope of Khurmij, perfectly concealed among the lower underfeatures. A fine stream of fresh water flows past it, and most ex tensive date plantations are situated in the hollows of the hills around it. There is excel lent grazing in the ravines about the streams and fair supplies. Some 50 cattle and 300 sheep. Bhu*a, barley,dates, and firewood. About 120 donkeys available for transport purposes. The small village of (lashi, about 1 mile distant, is really an outlying part of Kahviz. There are about 200 houses in the two villages. These are the only inhabited places in the valley. The gardens of Mydun on the opposite side also belong to Kahviz but no one lives there. All the routes through this valley are mere foot tracks, though it is possible with difficulty to get a loaded mule over some of them. Cavalry and artillery would be quite useless here. The only arm that could move and act efficiently would be infantry. Kahviz is reached from Ahram by two tracks — (1) Branching off to the right from main road almost immediately after leaving Ahrain, ascends the hills towards the peak of Khurmij, and zigzags up and down among the ridges. Narrow, steep, and toilsome throughout. Fit only for foot traffic. No fresh water obtainable. Kahviz reached at 16 miles. (2) A slightly easier route obtained by keeping to the main road from Ahram, a little further up the gorge. This is two miles longer, but has the advantage of fresh water being obtainable during its latter part. From Kahviz there are tracks— (1) To Lava, connecting there with route along the coast, said to be only 4| farsakhs distant, but so difficult as to be only passable on foot. (2) To Tahluk, distant 13 miles. This track crosses the valley to Mydun date grove. Thence by the steepest (gradient in places 22°), roughest, and most difficult pass I have ever seen, loaded mules cross to Tahluk near Tang-i-zard on the main route.128 No. 22C.

The importance of Tahiri lies in the fact that vessels can be brought quite close in shore instead of having to lie a long way out, as is generally the case at places on the Gulf; but Tahiri Itself, being only a small and poor fishing village, can be depended on for very little of anything. It is doubtful if even donkeys could be procured for transport purposes. It is noteworthy that theonlv wav of penetrating into the intenor is by two passes; so that if these were properly held by an enemy, a° force landed here would be confined to the narrow strip along the sea coast.

Abbott did the distance in two stages as follows :— 1 ISHFABJAN 25 Ruins of villages close by at the foot of the hills to our right and old burying-grounds. Two and three-eighths miles brought us to the village Awiz, which consists of mud houses and huts. Proceed ing onward, we passed two warm springs, one of which was sulphurous, and the 5th mile brought us to the village Gumbaz. The road which had hitherto skirted the hills to our right, now led us away from them, the cultivation on this plain giving way to grazing land sprinkled with kunar bushes. About the 10th mile occurred a small stream, and | a mile further we passed the eastern extremity of a line of low hills, which cross the plain in a direction E. and W. At 11| miles we passed through low hills, extending from the east wards, and entered another plain belonging to the district Kuh Mara, and extending E. and W. The village Kanik, with its vast mound, bore at the 13th mile 50° about 1 mile distant. The 18th mile brought us to the village Naojin, which has also a large mound and palm trees. The plain we were traversing is little cultivated ; its surface is covered with turf and sprinkled with the thorny Icunar hush. It extends S. E. to N. W., and is about 2£ miles wide, and is well watered by small brooks. Descending through a valley for a couple of miles, we entered the plain of Jarah, where the land is cultivated. The road led near hills on our right, and brought us, at the end of the 25th mile, to the village Ishfarjan. The distance is reckoned at 7 farsakhs. Kazabun Kazran. 2,850'. 371 62i* From Ishfarjan we proceeded about a mile to the village of Hasanabad, skirting the hills. When at the 3rd mile, at the broad bed of a shallow stream known as Rud Khana Shirin, the rice-grounds obliged us to make a short detour to the ruined village Bala Deh. A low line of hills separates the plain into two longitudinally, towards its north-western extremity, leaving on one side a vale of some width. The 15th mile led to the village Eobat, a collection of huts and hovels, near which are two neatly-built stone forts. Continuing up the vale we ascended, at the 24th mile, over hills for 2 miles, when we came in sight of the lake of Famur, a long narrow sheet of fresh water stretching N. W. and S. E.; its south-eastern extremity was not visible on account of intervening rocks, but it extends to 60° from this point, and there is situated the village Famur. We made a trifling descent, and thence to the margin of the water; then for a mile and a half parallel with it, on a bearing of 310° ; the water then trends to 330° for £ a mile, when it terminates in marsh extending about half a mile to the north-west. At 33£ miles we passed the village Kumur Keshi, situated a mile to our right, and 2| miles further brought us to the garden Bagh-i- Nu. At the 36th mile we passed the ruins of a fort called Kala Jinan, touching on the road and arrived at the town of Kazaruu at the end of 37 5 miles; the distance is accounted 8 farsakhs.

Parao 16-50 16-50 From Chahbar telegraph office the road runs in a northerly direction oyer sand-hills for 2% miles, when the Tes (or Tiez) hills are reached ; these are rock with flattish tops. A camel track is kept in repair by the telegraph department and is suitable for laden camels, although a few places are somewhat difficult. The road winds considerably and debouches from the Tes valley on to the sea beach about 7 miles from Chahbar. Thence low flat sandy ground for about 4| miles, whence for 6 miles low and high sand hills and thence ior 2| miles, to Parag river, flat. Distance by telegraph line 16£ miles, by camel road 20 miles or more. A shorter route would be along, or near, the beach, from where road leaves the Tes valley, but some difficulty for laden animals crossing mouths of creeks. The better way and „wbich would avoid the hills would be by the original telegraph alignment from 13| miles east of Chahbar, skirt ing the hills on their east face, and cutting the telegraph line at 2| miles east of Parag. Provisions at Parag plentiful, sheep, fowls, milk, etc. Water from river bed brackish, but better can be obtained from well further up the river. Sibgan hillocks. 13 34 29-84 For a short distance from west bank of river the ground is flat and very salt; then for 4£ miles high sand-hills; thence for 4miles salt clay plain ; thence to Sirgan flat and sandy with small Sheep, fowls, milk, etc., obtainable and cheap.

Camel road avoids this latter part by going south and skirting the sand-hills south of plain. These salt clay plains are dangerous for laden camels in wet weather ; in dry weather, however, they are good and safe. On this stage is a peculiar salt clay peak surmounted by sandstone ; the latter is called “ Sapt ” or “ Sabat,” i.e., basket. At a distance the whole resembles a mosque. Water sometimes to be obtained to south of line, near this peak, in pools. Kair river brings much water when in flood ; overflows banks to some considerable distance east and west ; ford usually under Tele graph line, but when this is impracticable there is one If miles lower, but river sometimes impassable for 5 or 6 days together at any place. Fowls, eggs, milk procurable.

There is another road, but not so good, which skirts the plain 4 miles south where sand-hills meet the plain. At 14 miles from Kair the ground is flat and sandy for some distance, then high sand-hills to within 2 miles of Bir, when salt plain again commences and continues to beyond Bir river. This river is unimportant. Water obtainable, by digging in cool season, but brackish, at several places; in summer doubtful, but, as many trees about, water could possibly be found.

The same remark applies to the several alternative portions ot the route described below:— Bala Bud . 16 16 Cross the Ab-i-Diz by a brick bridge of 21 arches, 430 yards long. Then over the Sahra-i- Lur, a cultivated but treeless plain, by a hard broad road. At 6 miles Salihabad, a small mud village surrounded by irrigated fields. At 12 miles cross the dry bed of a river 200 yards wide The plain now becomes stony and slopes upwards ; enter low hills about 14 miles. At 15 cross grassv undulations, about 1 mile S W. of Kala Kasim, the same probably as Rawlinson’s Kala-i-Tangawan. Strike the Bala Hud at 16 miles. The river here is 100 vurds wide and flows in a deep bed with steep hanks; the bed is of pebbles and boulders. The descent to the river is easy, and usually it is easily fordable ; after ram it will be rapid and about 3' deep. Kemains of a bridge, a short distance below the ford.

Ab-i-Zal 1 , 200 '. 17 45 At 1 mile cross the deep valley of the Tiktik Ah by difficult rocky path ; then over the Waran Tushmal mountains and through several ravines. The valley of the Tiktik is a pleasant site for a camp, with good water and splendiu grazing. At 7 miles reach the Bidruze plain, from wkh-h there is a direct but difficult path to Khtiramabad aid Kirab and the Kuh-i-Gird, which is described by Rawlinson ; but he gives no distances ; and as it crosses several rocky ranges and is only a footpath quite unfit for troops, further reference to it appears unnecessary. It is the most easterly and perhaps the shortest route between Dizful and Khuramabad. The road now improves and rises gradually through intricate rocky hills. At 13 miles traverse the Kala-Reza valley (1,560'). Water from streams, forage plentiful, and room for a large camp. At 14. pass the ruined Kala l\eza. A deserted telegiaph office close by. At the northern end of the valley runs the Ab-i-Zal. Camp on the left or near bank. I he Zal is here a rapid stream 20' to 60' wide in a deep valley between perpendicular cliffs 100' high in places. The river is quite unfordable after rain, and there is no bridging material at hand. The valley in which it Hows is 2 or 3 miles wide. 4 Jaokau 15 60 4 miles Cross the river, and over the stony bed of the valley ; then by a bad bit of road into the stony Theodor valley, which is watered by a small stream (3 miles). Up its stony bed for about then by an easy but rocky gradient over a spur (1,950'), descend gently and cross another spur ; another mile brings one to a small stream with good grazing. Ascend a stony hill and skirt the almost perpendicular sides of the Kialah or Keolan range (2,060'). Descend into the rich pasture valley of Jaokar (1,840') watered by a clear brook. The gradients over the spurs of the Keolan are easy enough, but the rocks and stones render the march difficult. The valley is very suitable for a camp. The Karkbah river is about 2 miles to the left and any part of its valley, (here called Saimarra), is fit for both matching and camping. Near Pul-i-Tang (4 or 5 miles distant), the Karkhah contracts from 80 yards to 5 or 6, and is bridged by a single arch. The best road to Z«&gt;hab and Karmanshah leads up the right bank of the Saimarrah valley, as well as that by the Kashgan river to Khuramabad. The latter is described below, at page 150. From the Pul-i-Taug there is also a road over the Kailnn Pass to Khuramabad, which rejoins this route at Nasarabad (stage 11 below), but it is little more than a footpath and is most dangerous for pack animals and so quite useless for troops. Descend the Jaokar valley, and turn up the Saimarrah valley, here 1 mile wide ; at 2 or 3 miles some low undulations narrow the valley to 400 yards. Cross a couple of streams with difficult descents and ascents ; then over a grassy plateau to the foot of the Kailun range. At 7 miles low undulating hills with easy gradients, then up a long valley to the Lailun stream, a tributary of the Saimarrah.

At 5 undulations by cross a grassy gentle grassy miles cross a grassy plateau about a mile square ; then through a low pass to the pastures of the Hasanwand tribe. From here a road practicable for artillery is said to lead across the Jaidar plain by the Shapur bridge, the Tang-i-Dubashi, and the right bank of the Kashgan river to Khuramabad. From the Jaidar plain, a steep and rocky path also leads down the right bank of the Kashkan river to the Karkhah valley, a mile above Pul-i-Gatnaskan. The Tang-i-Penawar Valley is watered by a plentiful stream. The country so far from the coast is treeless and produces no firewood ; a force moving along this road would therefore have to carry about 3 weeks’ supply of charcoal. 9 Badamek 9 109 Ab-i-Saud 8 117 4,670.'

Ground on either side of road very broken further by de*'p ravines. At 2 miles, road passes through a cltft or fissure in a low ridge of rock and little on descends a few steps cut in conglomerate rock. Descends at 3f miles by easy gradients of 4° to 5° and &lt;Tosses a stream running south-vest. Notwithstanding broken nature of country which consists of rows and rows or tiers of hummocky hills, there is con* siderable cultivation. The soil is of a rich red colour with a quantity of slate appearing on the surface. The ground now falls towards the north-west, as the valley of the Ab-i-Diz, distant some 6 or 7 miles, is approached. At 5f miles cross a stream running north-west; water, good. Camp close to a stream in the deep undulating plain of Duma Eail which is considerably cut up by ravines. After deducting halts, actual time taken from Tabiran to Duma Kail = 4 hours 35 minutes. Only mountain batteries and infantry can manoeuvre here. Except for scouting, ground too broken for cavalry action. About 7 miles to the north-west is the Kila Ab-i-Diz (Kila Shahid), the strongest place the Ilkhani has. Khan-i-Satfed (camp.) 241 Bearing of general direction to spur of the Sikeria mountain is north-east. From Duma Kail a guide from the “ ilyats ” encamped here, he is abso lutely necessary as the road or track now becomes a mere goat path, often becoming invisible where it passes through long grass and patches of cultivation with com or barley just ready to be cut. Ground very much broken up by ravines. Soil is a rich red clay. Surface of ground now travel sed is of slate stone rock, in which there are a few deep steps. A little further on track leads over a spur of the Sikeria mountain at a height of 2,600 feet, and descends into the head of a small valley and across a stream; and thence ascending, again up another spur becomes very stony and rough. Supplies.—None. Water.—(&gt;ood and plentiful at this time of year; June, July, August, and September scarce. Forage.—At this time of year the grazing is excellent although the ground traversed is rocky, stony, and broken. On return journey from Pul-i- Knl one stage was made from Nurabad to Duma Kail. Time taken from Duu a Kail to Khan-i-Safed = 2 hours 5 minutes. Nubabad 12k 37 Passed over the north-east spur of the Sikeria mountain, the bearing of general direction being easterly, across the valley between the two moun- - tain ranges of Sikeria and Lungar. The descent mto the valley is difficult as it is over large boulders of conglomerate rock and loose stones, dhe gradients are not very steep, excepting where the track descends to cross the beds of several streams, which could easily be bridged over. Here and there a steep bit is met with of about 9° gradient. At about 7 miles the track is bad for nearly thirty minutes as it passes al&lt;mg the side of the hill, the surface of which is of flint stone and verv slippery. It v i ^°. mules over this portion of the track. At about 8 miles an old Kala (or fort) called Barnesar, quite in ruins. A little further on the principal stream of the valley is crossed flowing north-west to fall into the Ab-i-Diz. The nature of the soil changes to gntrh (gypsum) and for an hour and a half ridges of gatch are constantly crossed. During the last 2 miles the track lies over rich grassy undulating ground wpen the camping ground of Nurabad is reached, at the foot of the Lungar mountain.154 No. 29B. Dizful to Pul-i-Khl.

After deducting halts, actual time taken from Khan-i-?afed to Nurabad=o hours 40 minutes. Pahraj 4,*250'. 46 Bearing of general direction is easterly. Track crosses some low hills near foot of the Lun&lt;&gt;ar mountain. Gradients of the track are not steep, but it is bad going as it is over large loose stones which makes it heavy for animals. Track now passes over hillside of slippery sand-stone rock, where several mules came to grief. A little further on the track becomes fairly good, and descends to a river-bed, down a steep spur of a hill of slope of which is 15°. Track goes along the river-bed, which is 150 to 200 yards broad with only 2 feet of water in the centre (height 2,900'), for about 4 miles, when it leaves river bed and ascend* up side of hill by steep gradients of 8° to 12° to 4,300', and then descends into a valley where the remains of numerous “ ilyat ” camps are found ; this spot is called Pahraj. Country very mountainous, woody, and very stony. The whole distance from Nurabad to Pahrai would require to be considerably improved by a pioneer battalion before any large transport could be sent np, as with only ten mules great difficulty was experienced in getting them over the difficult portion of the track. Supplies.—None. Water.—Good supply from small stream near camping-ground. Fuel.—Plentiful, mostly oak trees. Forage.—Grazing ex cellent. The great length of time taken in this day’s march, in proportion to the actual distance, is owing to the difficult ground traversed. After deducting halts, actual time taken from Nurabad to Pahraj, 4 hours 40 minutes. Ground only fit for infantry and mule bat teries. 6 Chalun 12 58 Bearing of general direction of route northerly. Track very stony over some small hills and down a steep pass or dry watercourse, 35° slope, ‘ n t° a deep ravine, then ascends up the side of the Salun mountain, also up a dry watercourse 15° slope, but more difficult as the boulders are larger, seveial times ramps had to be built to get the animals over these huge masses of rock, one mule having rather a bad fall backwards. After leaving the top of the watercourse continue up a zigzog path, the general gradient of which is about 5°, passing at the same time through a thick forest of stunted oaks. The soil here is a rich, red clay. About 2| miles further the forest ceases, and the ascent becomes very steep again, having a slope of about 20°. Ground surface of grey sandstone rock, which is very slippery. Several mules here come to grief, and the ground is difficult even for men. At about 10 miles the first water is met with, since leaving Pahraj, in a spring on the left hand of the track. Surface of the ground is of white sandstone rock, very difficult to walk or ride over. Bearing of general direction of track now changes to easterly and descends to the head of a narrow valley, thickly wooded with oak, by a zigzag path, gradients of which are 5 to 6 , and then follows the general course of a stream flowing easterly, which is crossed and recrossed several times, until the “ ilyat ” camping-ground of Chalnn is reached. After deducting halts, actual time taken from Pahraj to Chalun = 4 hours 15 minutes. Supplies.—None. Water.—Plentiful and good from stream. Fuel.—Plenty of oak and other trees. Forage.—Grazing excellent. Nukdar 4,350'. 15 73 The track stony and crosses and reerosses stream fourtimes during half an hour. Depth of stream 18 inches to 2^ feet.

Slope of hill 25°; the gradients of track about 8 °. Descent difficult as the surface of the ground consists of grey sandstone rock, which is very slippery. After crossing a stream (o, o ) in middle of valley track ascends the other side, very bad. Track bad along very tons slopes, descends again slightly. Camp on a small open spot near a spring, whic is called Nukdar, on an “ ilvat ” encamping-gronnd. After deducting halts, actual time taUen from Chalun to Nukdar=4 hours 15 minutes. No supplies. Good water from several springs. Fuel.-Good supply. Oak and other trees. Forage.— Giazing not very good as ground very rocky. Pearing of general direction of route northerly. Track very rough across several deep ravines for first hour when it passes along the precipitous sides of numerous detached hills, where one mule slipped and rolled nearly two hundred feet and was with difficulty recovered, and eventually descends by steep gradients of to the bank of the Ab-i-Diz. Camp about 9 mile from two broken briilges. No supplies. Water.—From river. Fuel. Very scarce. Forage. Grazing at this time of year (June) very poor. About 2 companies only of Infantry with 2 mountain guns could encamp near river bank. Best camping-ground for a larger force would be uear the route about half way from ]Nukcl.&amp;r* • Ab i-Diz, here 100 yards broad and very rapid. A few minutes’ walk brings us into the gorge through which the river Ab-i-Diz rushes at the rate of about 10 miles an hour. The’ path lies along the edge of the water on slippery slate-stone rock sometimes scarcely broad enough for a man to get a foot-hold. The ** ilyats stated that they lose a considerable number of their animals yearl}' along this route when going to and from their summer quarters. There are two ruined bridges about j of a mile apart.

Track lies along a high ridge for some distance and then follows the course of a small stream and parses through a deep ravine. A large stream is then crossed 20 to 30 yards broad, flowing south-east. This is the worst part of the road as some of the descents into the stream ar s very steep, 3°. Steps are very deep, otherwise the stage is an easy one for mules. Near the end of the march the now nearly dry bed of a large stream is crossed. Sar-i-Dasht is on the river Donoban, the bed of which is 40 to 50 yards broad with high perpendicular banks. Ford at this time of year about 1^’ to 2' deep, but banks show signs of water rising 8' ami 9' higher. Current not very swift. Actual time taken, deducting halts, from Dumakail to Sar-i-Dasht = 7 hours. Population about 40 to 60 people. Huts principally of mud and stone with thatched roofs. There are two forts here—one in fairly good repair ; the other in complete ruins, surrounded by numerous mounds; there are also the remains of an ancient reservoir and a beautiful level piece of ground with goal posts of stone a: either end Supplies.—Can be estimated by the number of inhabitants; they have, however, very large herds of goats and cattle. The country round is well cultivated and irrigated. Fuel.—Scarce. Water.—Plen tiful and good from river. Grazing.—Good. Salwati . . 14 , 47g Bearing of general direction of route, south 1,800'. Track for an hour lies over a gentle, undulating and fertile plain, then passes a Ziarat on the left hand. Ground now becomes again broken on either side of the track, which for a couple of hours passes in and out of deep ravines and becomes very stony and leads over tiers of limestone ridges. For half-au-hour the track now lies over open ground, and then rises gradually up the side of a mountain. After descending again a river (name unknown) is forded. Width at crossing 75 yards, current very rapid ; depth of water up to horse’s girths, banks show signs of water rising to considerable height above present level. Bed of stream pebbly. A steep climb up the other bank of 30° slnpe leads on to an undulating plain. For another 21 hours the track lies over the abovementioned plain, when another scream is reached, the bed of which is a deep one and about 70 yards broad ; at the present time of year easily fordable as there is not much water. About 500 yards from the right bank of the stream is the ruined fort of 8alwati. It is surrounded by a deep moat of some 60' to 70' deep ; and must have been a place of some strength in days gone by. Supplies.—None. Fuel.—Scarce. Water.—Excellent from stream. Forage.—Grazing at this time of year (May) very poor as most of the grass is dried up. Note.—Cure should be taken to prevent servants or followers lighting fires on the dry grass as in few minutes the country for miles round will be in a blaze unless the greatest efforts are used to extinguish the first outburst of a flame. Mosquitoes here were perfectly unbearable. 59 Bearing of general direction of route, south-east. The track is broad and well defined over an extensive undulating and fertile plain, but after half-an-hour it falls nearly 1,000'. A little further a stream is crossed and a few mud huts are seen on the left bank about half a mile up. An hour later the bed of a very large stream is crossed, width 250 yards, with per pendicular banks, gradients of which at point of crossing about 6° slope. Road still over an extensive undulating plain thickly covered with kanar bushes. After another hour, two more large deep beds of streams are crossed. At 10 miles, three cross-roads, the centre one is taken, bearing of which is south-east. Track passes within two miles of the main range of hills and becomes stony in parts in descending into a broad well-cultivated valley. Camp 5 Babadi. 11 * 1,900'.No. 30.

Cross roads from Dizful and Shustar here join our track which now becomes broad and plainly defined. Here and there stony, but no obstacles for mules. About half a mile from the cross roads can he seen the Ziarat and village of Sar-i-Shah, situated at the foot of some low hills to the westward. An extensive cemetery is then passed on the right of the road. The ruins of the town of Baba Ahmad are now passed. The place bears signs of having at one time been of considerable importance, as there are remains of two-storied houses, lar&gt;;e reservoirs, and a fort of some size. The Tungi or Pa-.s through which the Chulbar river flows is now entered. There are some remains of fortification on the right bank at the first bend of the river after entering the “ Pass ” of B iba Ahmad. Breadth of river 40 yards, stream very rapid High hanks thickly covered with rushes. Two fords at this time of year (May) just inside bend of river, about half mil - apart. Depth of water up to horse’s girths, but hanks show siijns of water r.sing considerably higher. Track then passes along the right bank of river. Ground opens out a good deal on either side of river, and slopes of hill sides not so pre cipitous. But If- hours further on, the hills close in arrain and track passes along ledge of rock overhanging stream. Path for last hour is very stony, but could soon be made a good one. After entering the “Tungi ” of Baba Ahmed, the bearing of general direction of route changes to north-east. At the easterly end of the Tungi the track ascends a hill by a stony zigzag path for about 400’ and then descends the other side into the picturesque valley of Ohulbar by a path with a gradient of t'°. Camp on the right bank of the river about half of a mile from the “Pass” or “Tungi.” At, the end of the “ Tungi ” there are the remains of an old bridge. A few huts to be seen here and there on the hillsides, but no village. There is a water-mill at the mouth of the pass from which a certain amount of Hour can he obtained. A Her deducting halts, actual time taken from Eabadi to Chulbar=7 hours, 35 minutes. Sunplies. — None. Water.—Plentiful and good. Fuel.—Oak and other trees and hushes. Forage.— Excellent grazing.

Tiiis is said to be one of the battle-fields of the celebrated Bakhtiari Chief, Muham mad Taki. A descent is now made into a narrow valley and the course of a stream is followed through a narrow mountain gorge, numerous springs of beautiful cold water being passed on the left; thence a sharp turn is made to the right along a very picturesque and fertile valley of about half mile broad. Another sharp turn is then made to the left (north) and track passes through some small hills into the large picturesque and fertile valley of Shimbar.

From mile 11 the road ascends the Jalk river-bed (here called the Nahu nala) to Nak U miles. Road good all the way. At Nahu fort plenty of excellent karez water, a large grove of date palms, considerable cultivation, wood and grass fairly abundant, but plentiful some 10 miles to S.; grazing abundant; inhabitants Baranzais, Salars and Rais, nearly all Balu chis ; 100 houses and some 500 sheep owned by village.

At 2^ miles the road descends into the Sargaz nak (called also the Pahura wa/a, a tributary of the Jalk river), and ascends its bed till mile 8 . Here the road crosses a low clay kotal and descends into the Nokdar nala at mile 9 (this is a tributary of the Mashkid river). The road onwards ascends the valley of the nala to tlie halting place. At mile 10 , at a place called Patkuk, sweet water is obtained 3 feet from the surface, and several wells exist. Here grass and grazing abundant and wood obtainable. At mile 12 the J ohldar nala runs into the big nala we are ascending from the left; perennial water exists^ a few miles up. At mile 17 the Mozaraf nala joins the Sargaz nala from the left; perennial water also to be found in it a few miles up. From mile 9 to the halting place the valley is 2 to 3 miles wide.

At Daf-i-Durokan no water exists, but plenty is found 7 miles up the river-bed on our left; also in the Talab river-bed, 10 miles on our right. Note. —A glance at the map will show that, were an army to go by this route, it would naturally strike more N. from Naraf, until it hit the Talab river (this would increase the length of the route by 5 miles); it would then march up the left bank of this river either to Bug on this route or to Mirjawar.

At this place the road to Khonsar and Gulpaigan branches off ; it leaves Dumbuna to the left, and passes between the Dar Bala and Chak Sari mountains. The streams of Faridan all run S. E. The little village of Dumbuna stands at the ex tremity of the Dalan range on the boundary between the Tirun and Faridan districts. The first village of Faridan is Ashgird ; 3 miles further comes Damn, with the residence of the governor and 300 families. 2f- miles beyond that again the Armenian village of Nimagird. The fields of Faridan, especially those of the Armenian villages, are well cultivated. 'The Armenians employ high two-wheeled carts for transport ; the others pack-animals. The Armenians here are warlike and of fine 'physique, differing greatly from the cringing specimens encountered in other parts of Persia.

This place used formerly to be called Asaraki. General direction N. W. Road good. The plain slopes down to about the little village of Son-i- Bidi, and then ascends gradually to Burujird. Many villages, more especially the older .ones on the river, are built on artificial mounds, as a protection against miasma and Bakhtiari attacks. The town of Burujird is 6 miles in circumference ; the walls, the five gates, and generally all Government buildings are in ruins. The houses are well built; the inhabitants, some 4,000 families, fairly wealthy. The neighbourhood is extremely rich in cereals. The road from Isfahan to Burujird could he rendered available for carriage traffic, at a slight outlay. The only difficult places are near Tirun, where the high plateaux are ascended, and at Dara-i-Shiraz and Shengun, where there is a descent into the Silakhur valley. 10 Bprttjibd 5,420'. 40 | 2m * From Malnkabad there ia a branch route to Khonsar (McLachlan ’89) as follows : Hindi Kush 8 fariaUi.

At 8 miles there are a post-house and caravansarai at Marg, both small mud buildings with an abamhar of good rain-water. Curzon makes this distance 13 miles, and the total from Isfahan to Mayar, 32 miles. About a mile further on the road passes through a small range of precipitous hills, entering at 11 miles the pass known as the Kotal-i-Urchin. The hills here are generally precipitous, with the exception of the range at right angles to the road, which almost closes the mouth of the pass, and is easily accessible by infantry or mule guns. The road through the pass is rather steep, the rock in places, as implied in the name Urchin being cut into steps. It would not be impossible to drag guns over it, but I heard there is a better road known as the Camel Road, avoiding the pass.

From Abadeh a cultivated valley is traversed, in which, under the hill on the left at 3 miles, is the village of Husenabad, similar to that of Karimabad, with gar dens. At 5 miles there is a stony, walled village, called Yakubabad, on the road, and a few miles further is Aminabad, a brick-walled enclosure, with buttresses and extensive gardens. At 12 miles stony hillocks begin on tflie right, and cultivation beyond this is confined to the left of the road, where villages and gardens are almost continuous to Surmek. The latter is a large village, with post-house built with high walls rather out of repair, in the shape of a parallelogram ; each face has four round towers connected by curtains of about 50 yards. A weakly-walled suburb outside the main wall on the S. side contains a few houses.

The village, called after the tomb, which is passed at 5^ miles, consists of 50 or 60 flat-roofed huts surrounded by tents. The inhabitants are Iliats, Turks and Arabs mixed, who own large herds of cattle, and engage a good deal in cultivation. They have a bad reputation as thieves. Beyond this, the road enters a remarkable pass between precipitous hills, through which flows a small stream, a tributary of the Polwar, towards Kovamabad. The water is good, knee-deep, with a swift current after two nights’ rain at the end of October. The road at first follows the bed of the stream, crossing it several times; bottom good ; and after 1 mile runs along the right bank. The hills on both sides are precipitous limestone cliff’s. Those on the right are tremendously high, except in few places where they are lower and might possibly be occupied by an enemy. The top of the cliffs on the left is too far off and too high to be so occupied. There is an alternative narrow path for the first mile cut out of the cliffs on the right bank. At 10 miles the ravine opens out on the right bank, and the road runs over a level valley 1,000 yards wide. At 11 miles precipitous hills again approach on the right bank, and for 100 yards the road is again narrow and rocky. Thence an open plain on the right bank to 12^ miles, stretching away for 2 miles to the right. The hills round this valley are not precipitous, and are covered with a thin jungle of thorn trees. At 12£ miles there is a third rocky passage for 100 yards between the river and the hills. Here, and at 11 miles, it would be difficult to make an artillery road without blasting to a small extent. Beyond this the road and river run through the rough valley covered with a thin jungle of thorn trees, and bounded to the right at 1,000 yards by a lower range of hills. Kanats along the right of the road from about 12^ miles take water to Amirabad and Kovamabad. At 16 miles the valley opens up left and right, and the road passes over a richly cultivated plain, more than a mile broad, between bold rooky ranges, near the base of which there are colonies of Bakhtiaris in huts. Gardens and poplar trees follow the course of a canal up the middle of the valley, near which the road to Kovamabad, at 18 miles, is heavy with mud after rain. Kovamabad is a large walled village 500 yards square, with big round buttresses of brick and a gateway at the S. end. It is situated at a mile from the end of the valley, and al though only about 80 houses are inhabited, possesses a considerable number of cattle. There is a post-house outside the village. 12 Saidan* . 15 264 5,500'. General direction S.W. The road rnns through the same valley for 1 mile, and then along the right bank of the Polwar through a gorge to the left between high precipitous hills. At 8 miles it crosses the river by a masonry bridge of five arches. Roadway broad and steep, beside which there is a ford just passable for infantry after rain in November. After passing the river, the road, which up to this point is frequently heavy with mud, passes along a fine level valley, 1,000 yards wide, with precipitous limestone hills on each side. Part of the water of the abovementioned river is diverted along this valley, and being joined by other springs, forms a considerable stream. The valley runs about E., is well cultivated throughout, and is about 1 mile wide, with precipitous hills to the right. At 6 miles the large unwalled village of Savand is passed, built on the slope of the high rocky hills on the left side of the road. There are about 200 houses with flat roofs, inhabited by Lurs. There is a telegraph station at Savand f; and from here the more direct route to Shiraz runs S. leaving Saidan to the E. and making Puza (16 miles from Savand) the halting place ; here is a chaparlchana on the banks of the Murghab stream, but no supplies. From Puza to Zargun, the next stage, is 20 miles. But this short cut from Savand to Pnza can only be used when the river is low. At 8 miles a road on the left comes from the old village of Savand, now in ruins, and is said to cross the hills to Kovamabad, but to be steep, stony, and unfit for laden mules. At 10 miles there is a small village of Lurs, called Rashtoba, * Saidan is now never used even as a Caravan stage.

Thence the nnain road crosses the stream at a small tower-like windmill, and the road to Saidan, keeping at the foot ot the hills on the left of the valley, passes through the village of haidan to the post-house. This is an unwalled village, inhabited by Lurs and Shirazis, consisting of about 100 houses of mud brick, many of them two-storeyed, with flat mud roofs. It is built close under the rocky mountains on the N. side of a cultivated vadey, 1 | miles broad, in which there are several villages in sight, and large herds of cattle and goats. The walled gardens of the village run along the foot of the hills for some distance to the east. 13 Zarghttn 5,400'. 28 f 292 General direction S. VY. The road from the post-house takes a short cut back towards the main road across the valley, passing over several . deep and muddy irrigation channels, roughly bridged with poles and reeds, and just before joining the latter, crosses the river, which runs sharply, more than knee-deep, over a pebbly bed ; water about 18 feet broad. It thence o- 0 es through a graveyard with a few trees, and passing a large walled deserted village on the ?eft, and the village of Haj.abad, under the hills, on the right, follows a flat irrigated valley with the river on the left, and the hills on the right. At 8 miles the road again crosses the river, which is here a small stream, muddy bottom, knee-deep, slow current, and banks high, except at the ford; and after passing some sculptured rocks on the left, enters the Persepolis plam or plain of Marvdasht. Takht-i-Jamshid (Persepolis) is about 2 miles off the road to the left. Here the route given below as No. 37 B. rid Simarun to Isfahan branches off from Puza post-house. At 11 miles the road passes the large village of Khusht, and there are seveial other villages in sight with a good deal of cultivation. The whole of the Persepolis plain is watered by tcanats, and both it and the road are heavy with mud after rain. At 20 miles the Bandamir river is crossed by a masonry bridge with 3 high arches.

On the Ardal side the hill is steep and precipitous, but the road goes by easy gradient alono sides and is here practicable. The road is soft after rain. Village ; water ; supplies. Also see Route No. 35 for alternative route up to this point. The road passes over good but undulating ground for 4 miles, when reach Kotal Gul Mirza, where there is a steep descent of 1,000'to 5,350' to a fine stream, feeder of Karun river. The road then follows the course of this through a very narrow valley with high precipitous mountains on either side. Road passable for mules, but requires making for carriages, especially on Kotal Gul Mirza. Village ; water; no supplies. The road crosses bridge at Dopulan, and imme diately after another, over a feeder of the Karun and proceeds due W. for 2| miles along a good road to a small village on the river at the foot of a steep hill. This march is very arduous from constant ascents and descents, but the road is good. The ascents are—(1) ascent to 6,450', descent, 5,050'; (2) ascent, 7,350', descent to 6,050'; (3) ascent to 6,650', descent, 5,050'; (4) ascent to 6,950', descent to 5,55C'. At 7\ hours village of Sakhun is passed, which would make a better halting place. Village; water; few supplies. Road descends sharply to a small stream, about 6' wide and a foot deep. At 6 miles arrive im mediately above the Pul-i-Amarat, by which the Bazuft or Rudbar river is crossed. The river flows down a narrow gorge between very steep slopes. The old bridge was destroyed by a landslip and the river is now crossed by a wooden bridge of about 20' span. The approaches from each side are difficult and dangerous, steps in places having been cut in the rock which is smooth and slippery. It is usual to blindfold and lead each mule over. In flood time the water often mounts sufficiently high to carry the bridge awa} 7 , but as wood is plentiful it is easily repaired. This road is only used in the earlier mouths of the year, later on the river is fordable lower down and thus this bridge and the pass beyond it are avoided. The ascent on other side is very bad ; for of the way, about 100 feet, steps have been cut in the rock, in other places the road leads across the bare rock and is slippery and dangerous. At the top of this slope is a spring called the Chashma-i-Mawarid, and immediately beyond it a ruined castle. The summit of the pass is reached 2^ hours later. Altitude 5,900'. From here the road which is good and broad descends by an easy gradient for about 1,750', the last few hundred feet being steep. From here the ford of the stream, above referred to, is seen, and the two roads join soon after. The road now rises by a steep ascent to the Cheft-i- Dehdiz (altitude 6,450') and is bad in places. The road now descends by an easy gradient to the village of Dehdiz, the last 300' being steeper. There are 2 villages, one on the hill side and the other about | a mile away in the valley. 200 houses, 1,000 inhabitants. Grain and provender abundant. From here to Shustar, see below, page 202.

Leaving Isfahan, fol low a road to the right of the Takht-i-Rusta to a point where it crosses the Zaindarud river at the village of Pul-i-Wargun. Level road, through a rich country, crossing numerous watercourses. The Pul-i-Wargun bridge is of brick, with stone piers, rising somewhat towards the left bank. The clay banks are low, the river forming here a wide trench, which in flood time shews a good expanse of water. Near the bridge is a mill. General direction S. W. by S. for 10 miles, then S. W. The road lay through rice-fields. We had perpetually to cross irrigation channels of water led from the Zaindarud. Villages were Ten miles from Pul-i-Wargun, we left the rice grounds and commenced the ascent Chiemini (Chaejii P) 25i 351 easy slope; passed a village Bagh-i-Wahash, so named from an old enclosed bunting i of Shah Abbas, remains of the walls of which are still to be seen. Two miles of plentiful, of an ground slope, and we enter the small pass named Gardan-i-Gao-i-pisar, at the entrance to which is a hut used as a custom-house, from it a road goes north to Najafabad, which is distant 12 miles. Gao-i-pisar is so called from marks on the hills supposed to resemble a cow. Five miles from the pass by a gentle slope, we again reach the river, which has made a great bend. It is here flowing E. to W., whilst at Pul-i-Wargun it was N. W. to S. E., the Gao-i-pisar range had to be thus turned. It divides Upper Lenjan from Lower Lenjan. Unlike Lower Lenjan, where the rice-fields are of wide extent, the upper is a valley of 300 yards in width with high banks. All beyond these banks is desert; between them are rich well cultivated rice-fields. Villages are very thickly scattered along the banks. The contrast from the desert above to this fertile strip was very striking. The villages contain numbers of pigeon towers like gigantic pepper boxes ; they are cylindrical and tall. At Pul-i-Kala the road crosses the rapid river which is everywhere fordable, but the water-courses leading to rice-fields are difficult to pass. The bridge consists of 8 arches, one of which has fallen in and is replaced by a most ricketty arrangement of piles. The right bank is worse even than the left. From this point a slight ascent brings you to the village of Chirm ini, where we halted. The road is good throughout and supplies plentiful. Chirmini consists of about 100 houses, with a few trees about it. General direction W. by S. for 9 miles, then S. by W. From Chirmini we began to ascend the slopes of the hills which bound the right bank of the Zaindarud; some gardens are passed—altitude 6,150 feet—and the village of Liahabid, where a steep zigzag commences, quite impassable for guns, as it nears the top of the Icotal named Tang-i-Rukh. This pass over the hills is known as the Gardan-i-Rukh. The ascent took us three-quarters of an hour. Altitude, 7,723'. The view from the top is over desert and rough, hummocky ground to the N. and N. E., the stream of the Zaindarud being scarcely visible. The descent on the S. W. is easy, and 8 miles further on is the village of Kahv-i-Rukh, the first of the district of Chahar Mahal, and under the jurisdiction of the Ilkhani, or Chief of the Bakhtiaris.

The stream at Shamsabad is 10' broad and 3' deep at ordinary tiims. At Id miles the defile known as Tang-i-Karji, shortly afterwards the river is crossed by a fair brick and stone bridge, about 40' long. The road then follows the right bank of the rirer The whole of this defile is dominated by the precipitous cliff of Jahan-Bin. At 18| miles the thriving village of Karaji. The valley opens out below the village of Karaji, where there is a rough brick and stone bridge by which the road returns to the left bank, and skirting the hills for a few miles, having left the stream, a sharp ridge of rock, some 300 teet in elevation, has to be crossed before^ the valley and the village of Shalamzar aw reached. This ridge could he turned. There is a stream flowing past Shalamzar which joins the one from Shamsabad and they combine ; they flow N. W. for a short distance before piercing the mountains surrounding the plateau of Ardal. Preece makes this stage only 21 miles. He avoided the Gardan-i-Zara by travelling from Shalamzar to Dopulan JNangun. Vide end of this route No. 38C. General direction S. for 5 miles, then S. W, Leaving Shalamzar we went straight to the mountains to the S. and crossed the Gardan-i- ... , , ,, , , „ Zara ’ a r °ugh and very steep track, only passable tor mules, and blocked even for them in winter. Tbe descent on the S. side is not difficult, and two small lakes are seen on the left. One lake is named Albolaki, and a stream from it waters the villages of Nagun, where the Ilkhani has a house. From near this lake the road follows the direction of the ridge it has crossed, and the stoen way is between that ridge and one of the short hills that runs parallel to it. The open plateau of Ardal is thus reached by a stiff descent. The configuration of the ground is very remarkable. To the S. E. is a mighty mountain, the Kuh-i-Kala, with perpetual snow, having, I believe, an elevation of 12,000' or 14,000'. Between it and a considerable range (the Kuh-i-Sabz) is the Tang-i-Siah. From S. E. to N. IV, flows the second tributary, that the Karun gains on its left bank. To the S. W. is the mighty mass of mount Garreh, which must he over 14,000' in height. Between this last and Kuh-i-Sabz the Karun escapes from the valley of Ardal through the tana or gorge of Dopulan. Turning one s back to Tang-i-Siah and looking N. W., one sees tbe valley of the Kanin pioper with the mountains of Zarda, which are said to be higher than either Garreh or Kala mountains. Looking N. is the comparatively insignificant range crossed by the Gardan-i-Zara, and through it the river from Shamsabad and Chabar Mahal is seen to break, which joins the Karun here in the plain of Ardal.

Doubtless, however, this name of Kuh-i-Rang is the origin of the name Karun. At Ardal, Raza Kali Khan, the second-in-command, so to speak, of the Bakhtiaris, has his head-quarters. The plateau of Ardal is devoid of trees, though the lower spurs of the Kuh-i-Sabz are covered with oaks. The level part of tlie plateau showed marks of cultivation, but now of course was deserted, as all the Iliats had marched south for the winter. The huts clustered under the hills looked dismal and deserted. The snowfall here in winter is described as tremendous. Baring says the road across the Gardan-i-Zara is the shortest from the Khariji valley to Ardal, but is never likely to have any commercial importance, as in winter it is closed. Ardal he describes as a miserable Bakhtiari village with one good house. 6 Dopulan 4,900'. 104 General direction S. Crossing the plateau of Ardal to the S. descend into the deep cut gorge of the Tang-i-Siah river which flows at a depth of IjOOO' below. The plateau lies between perpendi cular cliffs of fine limestone and conglomerate. At the foot of the cliffs and wherever thero is holding ground, oaks, ash trees, and pistachios are plentiful. The mules come rather to grief over the descent. After meandering for some two miles at the bottom of the gorge, reach the picturesquely situated village of Dopulan on the left of the river. The road is certainly a very bad one, especially at the descent to the river. Dopulan is a miserable village with no supplies except firewood. 100 houses, 400 inhabitants, 1,200 sheep. Just below Dopulan the river of the Tang-i-Siah falls into the Kuh-i-Rang river, forming, as before stated, the second tributary on its left bank. The former is spanned by a wicker bridge, the latter by one of brick lately built by tbe Ilkhani, at the point where the river emerges from a deep gloomy gorge. The bridge is narrow but serviceable, and spans the stream in one large and one small arch, length, say, 20 yards. Hilisat. Camp on left bank of Stream. 4,850'. 19 123 General direction S. for 14 miles, then S. E. Leaving Dopulan cross first the very shaky wicker bridge over the Siah river, and then the brick bridge, over the Karun river and ascend the side of a N. W. spur of the Gara mountain. Hoad is rough in places though as a rule good, and leads through thickish oak forest with a steady ascent to an elevation of 7,850', where cross the watershed, a saddleback between the Gara and Arman mountains, and descend by a steep track to some cultivated ground. The forest here is of oaks, 40 feet high, and one and a half yards girth. Altitude, 6,350'. From the patch of cultivation the descent is through a narrow gorge, with precipitous sides, which could easily be turned into a nasty obstacle to an enemy. The road is rocky and goes downwards, but only to again rise steeply to 6,600' and again descend to 6,400', when it once more rises to 6,750'; then crossing the saddle of a spur from the Arman mountain, it descends into a gorge which leads down into the valley of the Hilisat stream which we followed. There are 3 roads from Dopulan westwards : one high along the upper slopes of the hills, only used in summer, a middle road, and a lower or winter road which follows the river along tW hills immediately above it. This latter is much the longer and is said to be the more difficult. Preece took hours by the middle road. Hilisat is a fair village but the people are poor and no supplies are obtainable. The road is certainly very rough and the frequent up and downs vary trying. No supplies obtainable except rice. General direction W. by S. The road imme diately crosses the stream (!5 yards wide, deep with rapid current) by a wicker bridge and then ascends a steep spur of the mighty Gara (Girreh), 8 Rudbar.

Its southern slope is then descended to the valley of the Rudbar stream. The top of this offshoot was of rolling country covered with fine oaks. The road good and open. The springs here were brackish. The view looking S. and W. was very fine. On the left the Karun, deep down in precipitous gorges ; here and there are seen tributaries coming into it from the W. from the Kashgai country, which country showed more open vales than that we were in. Far away N. W. is a snow-capped mountain, which it seems must be the Kuh-i- Dinar of the Kashgais. Looking S. the Kuh-i-Mangasht, with its long ridge, snow-capped and rugged, shows as yet no way out for us to the plains. On the right is Gara with its massive head frowning on the Rudbar, which flows along its southern base. A few miles farther and we are on the top of the almost precipitous cliff that forms the left bank of the Rudbar. The descent into the Rudbar valley was abominable ; nothing but mules and carefully led Persian horses could accomplish it without accident. It is quite as bad as the Kamanj kotal on the Bushire road, but fully twice as long. A road here would indeed be difficult, and for wheel traffic impossible. It remains to be seen whether such a road could be made further up the Rudbar at Shalil, where there is said to be a bridge. The Rudbar was easily fordable, 150 yards in width and 2|' deep; it is a rapid and picturesque stream. We encamped on its banks. Preece marched from Hilisat to Shalil. After crossing the above- mentioned spur of the Garas the road descended gently through oak forests to Shalil. 9 Deh Diz . 12 150 General direction W. The road up is simply terrible, it is rough, steep, and slippery. The Sha» lilroad* must be better than the one we traversed, as Mr. Mackenzie, who followed it, writes thus:— “ Shalil to Deh Diz, altitude about 5,150', easy and gradual descent to a main feeder of the Karun at about 3,250'; crossed by a wicker bridge across a fissure in the rocks; dangerous crossing for animals ; old bridge above in ruins ; thence ascend to 3,850'.” E vidently the route vid Shalil is the beaten track and is much better than the one rfd Rudbar. On the high ground the road is good and descends by an easy gradient of 1,000' to Deh Diz. At Deh Diz there is an old fort roughly built of unhewn stone with mortar. Around are nomad huts and a few houses of poor people ; a large open upland is in front of the village dotted, as usual, with oaks and patches of cultivation. The village contains about a hundred houses. Deh Diz 12 150 5,150'. 10 God-i-Balutak 2,960'. 10 ^ 160i General direction W. Easy road the whole way. From Deh Diz descend steadily down a water course to the banks of the Karun, through wooded country. At 4 miles pass the village of KalaSard, about 100 houses. About 2 miles further the Stream of Rekal. Thence continual descent to the God-i-Balutak, a deserted village being passed on the way. The road not bad for mules. The river here was deep and flowing, say, 5 miles an hour, and at this^ season it is 40 yards in width. Its bank showed marks of a rise of 10' or 12' during spring floods when the width would be 60 yards. Men and goods cross on inflated skin rafts, animals are swum across. This situation of God-i-Balutak is admirably adapted for a flying bridge, and there is nothing to prevent the working of such a bridge if a good stout boat were built for the purpose. Laden mules could then make the passage in a few minutes. The left bank requires a road made to the water’s edge, as it is precipitous for a height of 50'. A bridge is being built about 20 miles lower down. Supplies scarce, except water and firewood. General direction W. by N. The road rises gently from the river bank and is good ; it makes for a gorge, and passes through it, following a valley between the S. E. end of the Mangasht 11 Mae AMIEf 24 1841 3,930'. * Vide page 198. _ ... t Preece travelled due west from Mai Amir making the following stages: Mal-Saidi (village $ mile iro Imamzada of Shah Reuben) 14 miles, Gurgir 24 miles.

The course is little better than a cleft at an altitude of 3,000'. Some way up this gorge a side o-ulch is followed to the left and a curious old paved way, the Kah-i-Sultani. leads to the open plain above. Then a very difficult piece of road is encountered, as a descent has to be made over the face of a limestone hill rounded in form and to all appearance smooth until reached, when the terrible rifts and rubble stones that break up its surface prove to form one of the worst bits of road yet encountered. A way would have to be built lip this face, and for wheel traffic this would cost a large sum of money. There is no avoiding this hill nor any of the gorges. The Malamir plain once reached, all is easy to_ the “ teppe.” Altitude of plain 2,930'. It is overgrown with camel-thorn, but is cultivated in the centre and at its western end, where it is irrigated. The village consists of a group of reed huts on an eminence. 600 inhabitants. Supplies plentiful. 12 Kaia-i-Tul 15| 200 3,542'. General direction S. by E. At M alamir one is fairly out of the mountains, though there is still some hilly country to encounter, yet it is all of one description, mz., gypsum and marl, or “gatch- match,” as the Persians say. Quitting Malamir plain at its S. E. corner, by a valley with many tall reeds scattered about, turn sharp to the S. of the valley between rocky hills, but for which rocky hills and the absence of a stream down it, it would be like an English park. Tall grass, now somewhat dry, surrounds the stately oaks which are dotted here and there. The road emerges from this valley on to a barren stony plain, in the centre of which is seen a barrow or “ teppe” crowned by the fort of Kala-i-lul. ^ Ihis is the stronghold of a certain Mirza Aga Khan, who looks on the Ilkhani as his suzerain, though he is more or less independent of that Chief. This Khan’s subjects on the left bank of the Karun are called Chaharlang, and wei’e formerly at deadly feud with the Haft-Lang, or those who dwell on the right bank ; but the Ilkhani has altered all this. From the N. at a distance the fort of Kala-i-Tul is like Quetta, but from the S. side it looked like an unfinished church. It could not be taken without artillery if held by resolute men. It would hold a garrison of 3,000, and has a well inside the ramparts. The door is well protected by flanking fire and from direct attack—a remarkable thing in Persia. Mirza Aga Khan is repairing this fort, which is built in two tiers, that to the N. being the lower. The road may be called good, and supplies are tolerably plentiful; but there is no water along this stage. General direction S. Leaving the fort, go S. W. over the barren plain; cross a low spur, descend into another portion of the plain still with no signs of cultivation. On the far side one poor small village 'of Bagh-i-Malik, where there is rice cultivation on^ the banks of a stream, and the wild myrtle clumps look fresh and handsome. Leave the ruins of Man-Zanik on left, and following the course of the Ab-i-Zard and crossing it, go through a pass in some low patch (gypsum) hills, and then S. for 3 farsakhs oyev a vile road to Sar-Asia or Kud-i-Zard. Just before reaching this Iliat village, recross the Ab-i-Zard. It is here 20' wide and 3' deep and turns several mills. There are some patches of rice cultivation on its banks. Sup plies scarce. General direction N. W. There is a slight rise through the low hills of roughish patch. To the S. the country is a hummocky mass of gypsum hills. Cross the upper courses of several streams draining down from the watershed of the Kuh-i-Asmari, which from Gurgir extends to Kud-i-Zard, though it is only near the former place that the hill gains the elevation which 13 Sabana or Rijh- 13 213 i-Zakd or Sae- ASIA. 2,430’. 14 Gubciib or Gul- 20 233 GIN. 1,480'.204 No. 38A.

The streams are sluggish, with deep pools cut out of the gypsum beds. Fish 14 inches long. The road not bad to the highest point, but beyond this to Gurgir it is stony and terribly rough. Gurgir is a wretched place in an open patch amongst the gatch hills and at the foot of the bare Kuh-i-Asmavi; the people are Sayads, and consequently of course inhospitable. The crops here and there look quite insufficient to support the population. 80 bouses, 320 inhabitants. 15 Shakab Ab* 14 247 General direction N. W. Cross a sulphurous stream, which, apparently coming from the direc tion of Malamir, passes at the N. E. of Gurgir. Despite the nauseous taste of the water, rice-fields flourish on its banks, which we follow to Tambih. A small stream of fresh water falls into the sulphurous river, and there is some cultivated ground about Tambih, after leaving which no cultivation till Shustar. The road recrosses the sulphur river and turns due S. for 2 miles ; then quitting the neighbourhood of the river, ' E. by S., goes through gypsum hills for the remainder of the day’s march, descending by a very had zigzag into a broad open valley, through which a tributary of the Karun flows. This is also brackish, but some just drinkable water is reached at a spot named Shakarab— “ sweet water.” The water is only just drinkable and tastes of naphtha. 16 Shustar 410'. 30 277 General direction N. W. A good level road the whole way. It first goes down the open vale bounded on the N. by the plateau of gyp sum, crossed in the previous march, and on the S. by a ridge of sandstone, which running E. and W. divides this valley from the plain of Ram-Hormuz. Every now and then the road crosses the brackish stream, and the junction of the Gurgir stream is seen to the N. E. There are ruins showing that this valley was for merly peopled. The spring water still brackish and barely drinkable. Amongst these hills were well built masonry retaining walls, evidently intended either for the storage of water or to terrace the hill-side. The earth at present is level with the tops of the retaining walls, which show skill and labour far in advance of those of the present inhabitants, who now entirely neglect their country. No. 38B.

Close to it is the large spring of “ Sardab ” (cold stream), which, gushing out of the rock £ mile off, pours as a foaming torrent straight into the Karun just below the remains of a large and ancient stone bridge. This would mdicate the importance of the road over the Gurab pass in former times. A temporary structure of wood near Rustami answers its purpose now. At 7\ miles pass hamlet of Shahzada ; thence into Ali Kuh, at this time a city of the dead. All the inhabitants have disappeared partly for want of water, partly as Ilyats.

On the left bank of the “other” stream is seen another severe rift, the Tang-i-Kufia, through which wends a small stream allowing room fora mule track leading from the “ Duab” valley over the Gardan-Gil-i-Surkh (i.e. Red earth), close to a very red-looking hill top to Birigun and onwards. Throuo-h the rift is seen a cultivated upland valley, Mish Mal-i-Kuh. Another cultivated habitation high up the Kuh-i-Kaisru is known as Esbauer. The track continues up the right bank of the Duab to its source, which is at the foot of the pass over the Cherri range ; but this track is stony, and is only used by those wishing to proceed to the cultivated plots and tree plantations in this long valley near the water’s edge known as Dez Darun, in the centre of which, out of the foot of the still snow-clad Kuh-i-Milli (or Esbione), gushes another of those ready-made magnificent streams, adding much to the volume of the river into which they boisterously fall. The through route (that taken to the Gardan-i-Cherri and Bazuft), fords the stream Duab at the 8th mile, and leads up a spur (the Gandawa) from the Cherri rano-e, and hugging it for 3 miles, re-crosses the Duab near its source at the 11th mile.

At the 7th mile from the Gaukun a col is reached (Gardan-i-Kamarun). Here camp was made. A capital mule tiack, stoneless, and still within a few feet of the top, over smooth spurs well covered with vegetation, enables the Shahun peak to be reached with ease riding on horseback. The central peak is 12,900 feet, a few feet higher than the Kuh-i*Rang, and from it the two highest peaks of the Zarda Kuh are estimated as between 13,000 and 14,000 feet ; the last named figure is certainly not reached. 12 Masir Mogoi . 12 129 Continue down the Mogoi valley westwards, known as the Pashandegan or Samistan valley from two hamlets of that name situated in it. , At the 3rd mile from the col a streamlet is struck which flows through a narrow, but highly cultivated valley with both banks enshrouded in bushes, the path follows it down for 5 miles, when another stream is crossed, flowing from the Shahun range through the higher valley and hamlet of Samistan. At the 9th mile the hamlet of Pashandegan is reached. Hence the stream takes a more southerly course, emmed in by precipitous banks. From here, passing through the hamlet of Samistan, a mule track leads over the high range by the Chukashan pass into the Faraidan lowlands beyond. The main track now leaves the valley and hamlet of Pashandegan (7,700'), and at once ascends a spur by a zigzag smooth path for a height of 1,500 feet. From a knoll close to this col (9,2u0') a good view is had of the country to the south.

Following an excellent track, passing now through corn-fields, now along the hank of a stream shaded by pollard and elm, the village of Tursa is passed at the 5th mile, that of Sarkala at the 6th, Dehnao on the left bank at the 8th, and the village and cross valley of Gowah at the 12th mile.

It is situated at the foot of a large spur from the Talanda hill, and is visible from all parts of the open valley. Numerous springs in the neighbourhood and good grazing. Armenian villages scattered about here. From Huma are two good tracks, one a few miles shorter over a col ; the other following the water course through a tangi in a chain of low hills. The latter track chosen. An excellent drv weather one over stoneless mud spurs. At 3 miles passed the remains of a village burnt down in a raid. At the 5th mile the Iwaz Tangi (6,900') is entered, and the track changes to the left bank of the stream (the Ab-i-Garmak,). The defile, about,100 yards broad and bounded by steep mud hills (400'to 500'), is 2 miles long. At the southern end, on a conspicuous crag, the abrupt end of a spur, are the remains of a castle or stone building of ancient date known as Kala-i-Dukhtar. It is in a commanding position, and in former days might have been made impregnable. At its foot, 800' below, runs the stream, here joined by another watercourse from the west, named Darrah Shikaft. These two streams make the Wanawi for a few miles, which when joined by the Ab-i-Safed, 2 miles lower down, becomes the Kakulistan, and when joined by the Gaukun and Gawa at Basnawi, the Ab-i-Diz. The track now descends into the Makkadi (7,600') valley, the first Zallaki possession encountered. Makkadi, 8 miles from Huma, is a small village prettily situated near a spring possessing an ancient imamzada, and surrounded by waving cornfields. Thence the track descends more than a thousand feet to the bed of the Kakulistan (6,300'), which stream, now 20 yards wide and 3| feet deep, has cut for itself a channel through mud hills and rocky ranges regardless of natural formations, and forms an important physical feature of this country. Owing to the low altitude of its bed and immediate vicinity, and its narrow defiles here and there, it is discarded as a habitat, and possesses no track along its course. The high, flat, broad mud spurs alongside form the cultivable portions on which the Illyats from neighbouring villages reside. After crossing to the right bank, the track to Sangkala moves up a high spur at once, and makes for a col on the Kali Kuh range. 16 Abjanak . 7,100'. 14 (approx imate). 176 The Isawand summer headquarters.

Trees only remain in a stunted form near the hill tops. The stream which was followed till now changes its name to Zal-i-Ab, and the valley thus named is the first possession of the Sagwands met with. The track moves up the Zal-i-Ab for 3 miles, and then ascends for one mile to a low spur kotal (6,700'), the watershed between the Ab-i-Bnrujird and the Khuramabad basin.

Remarks, over hilly ground, the continuation evidently of the great range of hills that passes by Kum, Kashiin, Kuhrud, and Natanz ; and 3rd, 120 miles in a south-easterly direction over an offshoot of the great plain of Khorasan. Coining from Tehran to Yazd by Isfahan, one is consequently obliged to cross the Kuhrud range twice, first at Kuhrud itself, where the hills are high and rocky, and frequently impassable from snow in winter; and secondly, 50 miles to the east ward of Isfahan, where they are much lower and less precipitous ; whereas the direct road from Tehran, by Kashan and Nain, is over one continuous plain. Starting from Julfa, we rode nearly 4 miles along the southern or right bank of the Zaindarud, which we crossed by the lowest of the five fine bridges of Isfahan. Thence our road passed over 7 or 8 miles of a well cultivated district irrigated from the river, and containing several villages surrounded by trees and pigeon towers. From the fields and gardens we gradually ascended above the level of the irrigation in the direction of a prominent peak at the northern end of an isolated hill, which we afterwards passed close to our right. This peak is nearly east of Julfa, and is distinctly seen from Isfahan. From this point we again descended to an extensive plain on the level of the irrigation, in which was situated, some 4 miles off, the village of Gulnabad. The road is over a perfectly flat desert plain with large patches of white salt excrescence on the surface. On the northern horizon are the hills in prolongation of the Kuhrud range, and on the southern, beyond the Zaindarud, the lofty range containing the well defined peak of Kala-i-Kazi. Sagzi is a considerable fortified village, with a good caravansarai outside the wall. The road, which is very good, passes over a bare flat desert, with a slight gradual rise towards Knpha. Ten miles fromSagzi, on the road-side we passed a small haoz or tank of rain-water The caravansarai at Kupha is one of the finest in Persia. Sagzi 15 29 5,010'. Kupha (Tele graph Station).

Six miles from Kupha we saw a few houses close to the road on our right and a village about a mile off to our left. Within 4 miles of the entrance to the hills, and about 11 miles from Kupha, we passed the larger half-ruined village of Mashkinun ; a mile and-a half to the S. by W. a small domed tomb called Imamzada Kasim. Close to the foot of the hills, 3 or 4 miles to our left, we saw a number of cultivated places and small villages At the point where our road entered the hills (4 miles from Mashkinun), we passed the village of Tudasht, whence we wound along a valley deeply covered with snow and containing many small villages ; among others Sadikabad 2 mites, and Papetanna, 5 miles, from Tudasht. When passing the crest we observed some 12 or 15 miles to our right, an extensive sheet of water, which doubtless was the lake surrounded by marshes, in which the waters of the Zaindarud are dispersed and lost. At Tudasht the road leaves the line of telegraph which follows a more northerly course to Naiu, where it bends S. E. and the road joins it again near Naogumbaz, stage 6 below. Bambiz 16 96 From Laghirak the road descends, winding along between the hills until it emerges at their foot on a glacis slope facing the eastward, on which some 4 miles from the last of the hills, is situated the large village of Bambiz, at which we halted. In the valleys between the hills w’e passed a good many villages each provided with a small tower. Podar, the largest of these villages, situated about 7 miles from Laghimk, has a good sized square fort. Most of the villages, we were told, are the property of inhabitants of Nain.

Bambiz is a village of perhaps 80 or 100 houses in the open plain, with no trees or gardens and but very little cultivation. No caravansarai. At 2 miles in this stage a road branches off N.

Ihe water is salt, and there is almost no cultivation. Akda or Agdu 3,890’. 26 134 Road over 12 miles of flat gravelly desert to a newly built tank of rain-water. After halting for breakfast, we continued our journey over a very similar country, passing 4 miles from the tank the new carayansarai of Chah Nao, and 7 miles further the village of Shahrabad. about 3 miles irom Akda, where we halted for the night. The road is over a flat desert the whole way, until within a few miles of Akda, where the ground is much cut up with water courses and Akda is a small walled town of somewhat picturesque appearance, provided with a good post-house and a new caravansarai and telegraph office. Four miles from Akda we pass on our left the village of Shamsabad, containing some 20 or 30 houses ; and 3 miles further on a small tank, - ' where a road branched off to our left. Two miles from the tank another road leads, at an acute angle, to the right. Twelve miles from Akda we arrived at the ruined caravansarai and deserted post-house of Chafta. The road from Naogumbaz to Cbafta is over an extensive plain, with the Akda range about 8 or 10 miles to the right, and high hills, some 20 miles, to the left. For the first 6 miles from Chafta the road m level as before, and then crosses some undulating ground, with prominent low hills to the right, which stand isolated in the middle of the plain. Some 9 miles from Chafta, a road branches acutely to the left, leading in the direction of the small town of Batru, about 4 or 5 miles from Maibut. From the point of bifurcation the road is flat and Vj 1 7 Wl ^ m Z 1 miles of Maibut, whence it goes over ground much broken and cut up with old kanats. At this part of the road the soil is well cultivated, and there are numerous gardens. About a mile from the post-house we passed an old castellated-looking village on our right, called Bideh.

Emerging from the broken ground, we passed a large village marked by a cypi ess tree, about 2 miles to our left; 4 miles from Himatabad we passed on both sides of the road, the ruins of what must have been an extensive town, and beyond it, on our left, the large modern village of Shamsabad. The first part of the way was along a heavy sandy road, among low sandy hills; then came a little cultivation at the village of Ashkizar, and ^ , then sand again up to within 5 or 6 miles of Yazd, where we passed the village of Till Omar, and soon after a large village on our left, with a crenelated castle.

Village of Ziarat at I 5 miles, river of Bebilun at 2 miles, and the village of that name at 3 miles. Road now leads west along the slopes of the Roshan Kuh. These hills are so called because they are said to give out a glow on a clear dark night. At 4 miles village of Shah Abdul Kazim is passed on the right, among low hills. The lulls here are covered with a jungle of almond and thorn and are somewhat precipitous. At 5 miles reach the outer slopes of the Sated Kuh. Road continues due west.

The pass runs between the spurs of the Safed Kuh and the Kuh-i-Khan. At 12 miles the road bends south-east, making direct for the village of Khawaja Jamali, which lies in a valley on the southern slopes of the Roshan Kuh, joining the lake. Nearly opposite this point the lake is very narrow, and up to the first rains was to be crossed on foot. At 14 miles an imamzada.

Tasht is a cluster of reed huts on the shore of the lake. After leaving Tasht, the road, still keeping the same bearing, enters the bill, and is somewhat rough and very up-and-down. At 4 miles the , Gardana Kuchizun, thence very bad going in-and- out of hills and along beds of streams, till at 12 miles a small plain is reached, at the end of which is the seemingly prosperous village of Gumun. Thence a somewhat rough road through the hills to the Gardana Chab Abbas Ali at 16 miles. Thence the road, still con tinuing through the hills, leads into a sort of canon and comes out in the Jamalabad plain.

At 10| miles we reached the edge of the kavir. We proceeded by a hard, smooth path worn in the otherwise soft) rotten soil ; in rainy weather the Jcavir becomes impassable and the whole tract a mere morass or bog. As we advanced, the path for a while lay through a deep layer of loose salt, and then the loose salt gave place to a sheet of the same substance, hard and highly crystallised, and not yielding to the tread of a horse, though at first only one or two inches in thickness; beneath it was brine, mud, and water. Poles or stumps of trees placed at intervals guided us on our way; but presently we lost all traces of a path, and travelled over one wide expanse or field of salt, on which the horses’ tread left no impression, and which resembled the surface of a frozen sea. The length, as reported, is, from north to south, 6 farsakhs or 24 miles; but to the south-east it spreads out into a very wide expanse. Its breadth at the part -where we crossed was about 6 miles. After getting again upon the hard plain, at the 20th mile, quitting the main road, we struck across the country in a direction of 310°, after closely approaching the hills. At the 21st mile we reached another hill-road, and presently afterwards, leaving it, turned towards the small fort and village of Khairabad, where we alighted at the end of the 27th mile, having been obliged to travel about 5 miles out of our way to reach an inhabited spot (Abbott). A small village of 6 families with a fort. Water from cultivation near village. Pass Tarabad en route, and generally traverse cultivated country with numerous villages (Lovett.) N.B .—In this and most succeeding stages the distances are those given by Lovett; those given by Abbott are clearly under-estimated. Beshna 5,73u'. 43 177f Proceeding on a bearing of 220° and crossing a broad recess of the plain, we entered the moun tains. At the 6th mile two roads occurred, one leading direct to Katru, and the other on a bear ing of 260°, by which we proceeded through a broad valley, more or less clothed with bushes and the henneh tree. At 17£ miles, having reached the head of the valley, we found a deep well of good water, this being the first water we had met with since the morning. Here we entered the territory of Pars, and proceeded by a gentle descent still through a valley shal lower than the preceding one. Gradually we got into a more open country by continued descents, and at 28| miles we alighted at the small village of Beshna, possessing some towers of refuge. The distance is § farsakhs (Abbott). Passing small village of Dasht (30 huts) at 23 miles; brackish water from w T ell and no fodder. Thence stony, but fair road through low hills to Beshna; a square fort with towers at corners ; 30 houses and a garden. Water from stream a;.d wells. (Lovett.) 8 Katru 5,200'. 22 £ 200 I We proceeded on a bearing of 280° down a valley watered by a salt stream. At the 3rd mile proceeded on a bearing of 210° over a plain of great length, north and south ; the mountains on the western side forming a vast amphitheatre, the convexity of which points about south west. The plain more or less studded with low bushes, but in part salt and sterile. At 15£ miles we alighted at Katru, beyond which we could not proceed that day, there being no inhabited place for m&amp;xiy farsakhs on our way beyond it (Abbott). Forty houses; water from kanats. (Lovett.) Niriz 5,685'. 39 239 From Katru we proceeded on a bearing of 260° and 275°, the plain clothed with the gum tiaga- canth plant. At the second mile we entered a deep and wide ravine through the mountains, and pro ceeded by a gradual ascent in direction 275°. This pass abounds with bushes and the henneh, and wild almond trees. The 6th mile brought us to the top of the pass, from whence we proceeded by a gentle descent over an open tract between hills, the country still clothed with251 No. 46. tufts and bushes. At 12£ miles we descended through a narrow, tortuous valley, by a very rough road and considerable slope, towards the end of which occurred some plantations of pomegranate, walnut, and other trees, nourished by a streamlet of very clear water. At 151- miles ascended again a quarter of a mile, when we came in sight of the Lake of N riz, or Khir, stretching nearly north-west and south-east apparently, though only a part of it was visible. We descended by a bad and rather steep road, on a general bearing of 270°, reaching the bottom of the pass at the commencement of the 17th mile, and then proceeding along the plain over very rough ground ; at the 19th mile alighted at a circular pond. We reached Niriz at the end of 21^ miles of difficult road. From Niriz to Irij across the mountains is a distance of 'ifarsakhs or 12 miles. Though this place is on the high road between Shiraz and Karman, such is the limited nature of the traffic between the two places, that we had not encountered a single caravan in all the distance between Sirjan and Niriz (Abbott). Road good beyond pass ; water procurable half-way ; at eastern extremity of pass, two forts of Deshan. Niriz is a large town, 3,500 houses ; water from kanats ; supplies of all kinds. (Lovett.) 10 Khib . . 21 263 From Niriz we proceeded over an uncultivated plain, passing at 4-| miles the village of Khojah Ahmad, situated 1 mile off to our right, at the foot of a lonely rock. At the 5th mile the vil lage of Kala Nu bore due north *10 miles distant; that of Rustak, 350°, 2 miles off ; and Kala Skur, N. 5° E., 3 miles distant. We were then travelling parallel with mountains some miles off to the south ; 6| miles brought us close to some rocks rising from the plain, and here was a considerable tract under cultivation, belonging to the abovenamed villages, and small encampments of Ilyats. At 9| miles occurred the small fort of Ai Yovan, unoccupied, but surrounded by black tents. From hence the eastern extremity of the lake bore N. 30° £., but the water then reached only to N. 10° E., it beinsr low at this season. A high range of mountains called the Kuh Khojah Malli, 30 to 36 miles off, bore from Ai Yovau between the points 335° and 350°. The 16th mile brought us close to the water. Thence the road led parallel and close to the lake for some distance, a range of mountains on our left running in a line with it about 1 mile distant. At 22 miles the village Mubarikabad. The lake now about If miles distant but hidden by some high rocks. At the 23rd mile the ruined mud village Kala Serai, surrounded by cultivated land. Thence, 305° direct to Khir. Lovett followed a more southerly and circuitous route apparently vid Nafargan aud gives distance as 39 miles. A sweet spring here. In the neighbourhood of Khir there is a considerable amount of cultivation of wheat and opium, and some good gardens of fruit trees are scattered over the plain, which here juts out into the lake in the form of a nromontorv. Quitting Khir, continued westward, near the mountains on our left, and parallel to the lake on the other hand. The 4th mile brought us to the foot of the former, when we proceeded on a bear ing of 300°, and reached a spring of tepid water at the 6th mile. The henneh tree, ghez, and wild almond abound in this part. At the 12th mile the shore took a bend northward. Hitherto from Khir the water bad appeared to be from 2 to 3 miles across; subsequently it became much diminished in width, but apparently less shallow. Water from a stream brackish but drinkable; no supplies except firewood. This march and the next are excellent tor wheeled traffic. Khana i-Kird consists of a tower, a ruined caravansarai, and a well 2 miles from the margin of the lake. 12 1 Kerama . 18 300 A gentle ascent over a hard stony road to Galu- gah, where there is nothing but a deep pond of muddy water.

The direct road passes a little east of this village, and continues on over a perfectly level plain, covered here and there with saline deposit. A well at 8 miles with a small supply of water. At 9 miles a small rid^e running east and west. Road crosses it and descends into a broad valley on the other side, the bed of lake Niriz being visible about one-and-a-half miles to west. A road branches off to north-east at 11^ miles, and goes over the higher ground. This is preferable in rainy weather, when the lake is full, and lower road apt to be impassable. Lower road ascends at 14| miles and crosses another outlying spur, and on the top of this reaches a small spring. Scanty supply of water. Descending again from here, track passes close along the edge of the lake. Another smaller spur crossed at 16 miles, borne conspicuous white peaks visible to east. Track continues north-west over some low ground by the lake. At 17f miles the road rounds the end of another ridge and turns north. Road passes a small well at 19| miles about one mile from the lake edge. Water here very scanty and bad, not to be depended on. Leaving here, road crosses level open valley, covered with patches of scrub jungle. Small mud fort of Do Dashtak contains about 30 houses. Inhabitants camp close by in hot season. Moderate amount of cultivation and supplies,—wheat, barley, and chopped straw. A good stream of water. 2 Kushkak. 2H 42f Track leads at first over level ground, with frequent patches of saline deposit, not to be recommended here for field guns, as it is very sticky in places, and in rainy weather probably under water from overflow of lake. Road passes some small outlying hills at 5 miles, and crosses steep and stony ridge impassable for field guns. Descends into an extensive open valley stretching away up to village of Kushkak, visible in the far distance. A peculiar isolated white peak between this point and the village makes a good landmark, as the road passes close under it. Road up this valley very good and easy marching.

Inhabitants (Lashanis) live in tents lower down by the edge of lake. \ ery good stream here, and a garden with domed tomb. Leaving here 'track becomes very rough, narrow and stony. Impassable for guns. It crosses three very steep ridges. Rate of march slow. High range of hills on north and a long high ridge on the south make it a defile throughout. Between second and third ridges a small spring of good water reached on left side of road. Top of last ridge is readied at 12| miles. From here road descends towards edge of lake again. Fairly easy gradient and very few stones. At 16| miles crosses stream of fresh water flowing into lake, and then leads over level ground on the lake shore. Still keeping west, re-enters the hills at 18| miles. Ascends by an easy slope, and crosses some high ground. Track here narrow, only room for one loaded mule at a time. Begins to descend gradually at 20f miles. !No obstacles here. Marching fairly easy right on down to valley. Huseinabad is one of a cluster of small walled villages, which are dotted all along this valley, each having an average population of about 100 inhabitants. In a good year supplies of all sorts obtainable, but for some years past swarms of locusts have done great damage to the crops. There is a good water-supply and plenty of good camping ground. Abundance of firewood on the neighbouring hills. A ESIN JAN. 5a 867 Leaving here road to Arsinjan takes a northerly direction, and is easy marching.

There are three public baths. Bukun 14 100^ Leaving Arsinjan, road continues north-west, threading a series of extensive gardens. Leave gardens behind, and proceed on up a broad open valley rising with a very trentle slope. A stream of good water flows on^ the right side of road. Patches of cultivation at first, and then the whole valley is dotted with stunted trees and thorn bushes. Water mill passed at 2 miles. Road good and easy. Another water mill at miles. Road here branches, rejoining further on near top of ridge. Continuous slight upward gradient. Track reaches its highest point at 8 miles, and begins to descend towards a broad valley dotted with numerous villages. Road to Cyrus tomb vid Kamin here branches off. Continuing on and taking a more westerly direction, Bukun road crosses the valley. Good, but stony. Road to Saidaa branches off to south-west at 13^ miles. Villages of Kamin and Aliabad visible in the far distance to north. Village of Bukun fair-sized, affording supplies of all sorts, though for some years past swarms of locusts have caused a great deal of loss to the inhabitants. The whole of this valley is well inhabited and supplied. OAVAND 10 f- 111: Leaving Bukun, an easy road proceeds along the level valley in west direction. Small mud fort of Daulatabad passed at 2 miles. Continuing on, another small fort passed at 5J miles and villages of Kasarabad and Akbarabad visible in the far distance to north. Small stream of fresh water crossed at 7§ miles. Road here commences to rise, and is a little rough and broken in places. A caravavsarai seen on the far side of a large stream which flows just north of track. This raravunsarai is on the main caravan route, and the poles of the telegraph line can n &gt;w be distinguished. Close by the south side of road is a high range of hills.

The ground is rather broken as Shims is approached. Shims lies close to the northern base of a black hill seen from Khush-kuh. Here there is nothing but the post-house and a half-ruined caravan- sarai; no cultivation; and only a little very salt water. 9 Karmanshahan 4,910'. 154 1574 The road now skirts the black hill on the left, gently ascending towards the right edge of a red- colored mountain seen from Khush-kuh. At 74 miles the road runs between low hills, with the red mountain seen from Khush kuh close on the left. At 10| miles the road again enters the plain, having crossed over the end of a spur from the mountains on the south. From Anar to Karmanshahan there is no cultivation, but from Shims the plain is covered with tufts. There is no village here ; no cultivation. Besides the post-house there is a new caravansarai by the side of an old and ruined one &gt; there is also a telegraph office, water bad. Karman shahan lies close to the hills on the west and from it mountains and hills are seen in every direction. To the north-east the plain slopes gently downwards to the village of Baiazdarun, 3 or 4 miles distant. Beyond that village there is again a gently-ascending plain to the mountains, a mile or two further, that bound it on that side. 10 Zain-ud-din . 144 172 The road at first skirts the foot of the hills on the left. To the right the ground slopes down very gently towards some kavir, some 2 or 3 miles distant; beyond this it again slopes gently upwards towards a low ridge at no great distance. On the right there is a rugged hill whicli the road skirts. The road is over a plain, where there are no signs of cultivation, and no habitations until the ruined caravansarai and ruined post-house at Ziin-ud-din are reached. The plain bears a growth of tufts and camel-thorn. There are kanais visible at the bottom of the plain. At 6| miles, the plain is divided by a ridge on the right that begins here. The road is still close to the hills on the left. At 14| miles arrive at Zain-ud-din. The ridge on the right comes to an end here. The road from Karmanshahan is in some places rather stony, but it is level and good. There is no cultivation and no water on tho road. At Zain-ud-din itself there is no cultivation.

The post-house is now no longer used, and is in ruins. No one lives here now, and no supplies of any kind can be obiaineu. At this point the plain slopes some 10 or 15 miles downwards to the right, and is bounded by mountains. This plain has a good growth of camel-thorn, etc. There is no water between the salt water at Zain-ud-din and Sar-i-Yazd. From Zain-ud-din the road skirts a low ridge on the left, behind which are some high mountains rugged and bare with snow on them, from Anar onwards there are no signs of cultivation, except at Baiazdarun, till 7 miles beyond Zain-ud-din. At 6 miles the road ascends to the summit of a low ridge, which is .just high enough to give a view of Sar-i-Yazd. At 7 miles there are some habitations 4 mile to t le left. They are occupied by some wild mountain people called Shums. At 8 miles on the left there is a fort and garden, with more dwellings of the Shum people, who are pastoral in their habits, selling milk and wool. Sar-i-Yazd signifies the boundary 0 Yazd district. From a little distance this has the appearance of a large and important place, but a closer inspection shows that three-fourths of what appear to be houses are bu heaps of mud, and that the town is a miserably poor place. There is a good caiavansarai, and the water is sweet. 12 Yazd 4,020'. 22 210-4- Over a desert plain about 2 or 3 miles from the mountains on the left. Those on the right being invisible, as the air was full of dust haze, but the plain seems to extend some 10 or 12 miles in that direction. Just outside Sar-i-Yazd there were some abandoned fields with a low wall on the western side, which had been built to prevent the sand drifting over the fields. Ihere were also long lines of kanats which, however, do not now bring sufficient water tor cultivation. At 5f miles the small village of Takiabad lies half a mile to the right. At 8f miles a dry tank lies a little to the left of the road. At 13r miles the large village of Muhammadabad with caravansarai and post- house. Here is much cultivation and many mulberry trees. Water-melons and opium are much cultivated. Ou the road we had seen hut one solitary camel carrying chopped straw to Yazd. But at this latter place everything suddenly changed. Ileie is the junction ol the roads to Shiraz-Saidabad and Karman. Here was plenty of good sweet water, and imme diately beyond the village cultivation begins. The roads were suddenly peopled with men and animals coming and going. At 14f miles a good irrigation stream of sweet water. At 22 miles arrive at the Governor’s bouse at \azd, which is a large enclosure or fort. From Sar-i-Yazd to Yazd there continues cultivation the whole way. Amongst other things potatoes are grown. Smith estimates the distance to Muhammadabad at lb, to Yazd at 2(5 miles, and the total distance from Karman to Yazd at 237a.

Along it is a tamarisk grove, with a little grazing, while nearer the hill is Asuman, a spring of sweet water. Bending round the hill we can see Fathabad to the north-east on the Tabas road, and with a slight but steady ascent over the barren stenue, we at length reach Haoz-i-Dak, a tank of sweet water with a tiny sarai. * For road from Sang t wards Anar, tee end of this Route, No, 48E.26'2 No. 48.

The village rises tier upon tier, and above it all is a magnificent chenar tree. This is the first village in Yazd. Ketracing our steps, we proceed once more to the middle of the plain, camping in the desert at 20 miles. Of course, for troops the march would be 18^ miles, as only a party would visit the village. The stream comes down to the main road. At the camping place no water, etc., so either Khudran or Haoz Dimar should be made the stage. 9 Bafk* . 18 143 A continued descent. At miles we reach the 3,167'. end of the range, and rounding it see Haoz Dimar, a tank with fresh water, the last on the road to Bafk. Soon after leaving we come into sand, and see the town of Bafk far below, but it is not until 18 miles that we actually reach the outskirts of the town, camping on the kanat with the sweetest water. We were told that six out of the 26 kanats were quite salt, while the others are not too sweet. There are plenty of supplies, which are not, however, cheap. Branch tracks to Tabas and to Anar (two routes). 10 H aoz-i-Tabar- 24^ 167§ The track lay through Bafk, which seemed like kuh a city of the dead, so few people appeared. Clear. 3,224'. ing the town at 1| miles we again come upon a stretch of sand with guiding pillars. To the north of the road, Bakalabad and Dasht Akun. Gradually descending, at 6£ miles, we cross for the last time the salt stream (2,932') so often mentioned. It is here dignified by the name of Rudkhana Aishlumi, and, with its companion kavir, can be seen stretching far away to the north where the ground must be very low indeed ; during the rains it forms a very serious obstacle to traffic. After crossing this kavir the road again ascends, passing a ruin, Chau Sarai, at 11 miles, and reaching Khan-i-Panj at 13f mile. Here we find two tanks of bad water. Pressing on we passed through broken country said to be the favourite spot for brigands to pounce on caravans. At 18f miles Haoz-i-Abdul Malik, a tank in course of construction, and, at 24^ miles, Haoz-i-Tabarkuh, a tank of sweet water, whieh we all enjoyed. 11 Pharaj or Fahraj 26| 194 Road up a river bed with low cliffs to the south, 3,915’. At 10 miles Cbah Kavar, a sarai with running- water. Thence, with the snow peaks, in full view, which bound the Yazd plain to the south, we steadily ascend until, at 16 miles, we cross the watershed, (4,320'). Just below Haoz-i-Gulu, another tank with sweet water ; from it we can look down upon the distant city of Yazd, lying in the middle of a mountain-girdled plain. Descending an arid slope, composed of hard, black gravel, we pass Sirizu, Herifta, and Takkiabad, under the hills to the south. Finally, at 26^ miles, we reach Pharaj or Fahraj (the same word as Pahraj in Baluchi) and camp on a kanat near the little village. A fair amount of supplies obtainable. * For road from Bafk to Anar, see end of this Route No. 48F.No. 48. Karman to Yazd, via Zarand and Bafk. No, of stage. Names of stages. Distance, in miles.

The navigation of the Karun river is very simple compared with that of the Tigris as the channel of the former is more permanent and less subject to variations in the posi tion of the sand banks than is the case with the latter. The season of high water com mences about the middle of November and lasts till about the end of July ; the rises from snow-water being higher and lasting longer than the more sudden rain rises from Novem ber to February inclusive ; the rain rises or freshets are generally followed by a small fall. Kui ISMAILIA Kut-ul-Amaba practicable by a rain rise of 18'. From is reported as being 6 to 7 knots per hour. In November 1888, before the snow rise had commenced, only 4' to 4’5' of water was found right across the river except close under either bank where the depth ranged from 6' to 8'. At the same season, between the large island, near the loft bank, and the right bank, only 3’ to B’S' were found and the passage of the steamer (the Arab, drawing 4’5') was only rendered here up to Ahwaz the current in the high season (Note. —This must be an exaggeration : 12' per second would render the navigation impossible.) According to Curzon the velocity of the stream is put at 4 to 5 miles per hour in flood, and at 1 to If at low water, which is more credible. Kct Abdulla . A depth of 4' to 4 , 5' was found across the line of sunken stone buildings in mid-channel.291 No. 55A. Muhammerah to Dizful, via Shusfar by Rivers Karnn and Diz. No. of stage. Distance, in miles.

Anchorage in mid- of rapids below Ahwaz, opposite called Bandar-i-Naseri, 1 mile south of Ahwaz. The Karun river at Ahwaz is so obstructed as to render transhipment necessary. The river bed is here crossed by a series of sandstone ridges striking from W. by S. to E. by N. and starting from the Ram Hormuz plain some 20 miles VV. by S. of Ahwaz. These ridges are five in number, and the river in passing over them forms a series of rapids which render navigation difficult if not absolutely impossible. Just above Ahwaz and above the line of the highest ridge, the river is again navigable. The difference in water level above and below this series of ridges is from 8' to lu\ It was along the line of the highest (up stream) ridge that the new ruined bund for holding up the waters of the Karun for irrigation purposes, originally existed ; traces of it are still visible. These rapids were successfully crossed by Sir H. Layard in the paddle-wheel steamer Assyria in March 1842, with the assistance of a tow-line. The Susa and Shushan also ascended in 1889 and 1890. The stretch of river which is thus rendered unnavigable is from to 1^ miles. Curzon is of opinion that there is no risk in taking a steamer up this bit of the river, in a favourable state of the water. A tramway is being constructed to facilitate transhipment from the lower to the upper reach of the river. Commander S. C. Plant of S.S. “ Shushan ” describes the Ahwaz rapids as “ a formidable barrier to navigation, and they can only be crossed by powerful light draught steamers during the months of April and May, with any degree of safety. Native boats can be brought over at any season. Vessels about to cross should have on board a man thoroughly acquaint ed with the channels, etc.” Telegraphic communications with Shustar, Muhammarah and Ram Hormuz. From Ahwaz, starting from above the rapids, the Karan is a fine broad river, navig able throughout the whole year for large light draught steamers. At present (1893, Com mander Plant of S. S. “ Shushan ”) there are only three native crafts on this part of the river (Ahwaz to Band-i-Kir), each capable of carrying about 45 tons or 100 men, and a small screw steamer belonging to the Persians, called “ Susa”, capable of carrying 30 tons or 100 men. Wais 35 152 Above Ahwaz the Karun is confined between lofty banks from 1C' to 30' in height, with vertical profile of marl; the river bed is from 200 to 350 yards wide. The course of the river is very ser pentine (Curzon). There is a ferry at 4Vais. Provisions, such as meat, coarse flour, wheat and bailey can be obtained here.

Shustar (ii) 48 211 to the W. of the “ Ab-i-Shateit ” which is therefore the centre of the three. The village is on the tongue of land between (i) and (iij and on the right bank of the latter. It is sur rounded by ruins of a large and important city, the bricks of which were being used, (Curzon, 1890), to construct a fort and telegraph station, on the banks of the Shateit (i). By (i) Ab-i-Shateit, 22| miles by river to Char- ding*, thence 14 miles by road. This stream is navigable by light draught steamers from January to August up to Chardinga. Above that point navigation becomes dangerous owing to shingle bed of stream, shallow water and very strong current. About 1 mile N. of Band-i-Kir, a reef of rocks extends across the river and prevents navigation during September, October, November and December. The^ princi pal village passed is Arab-Husen, where the road (western one followed by Curzon in 1890) touches the river ; distance by this road being 32 miles from Band-i-Kir to Shustar. This village contains 200 inhabitants; 50 to 60 horses; 50 to 60 mules; 70 to 80 donkeys; harvest about 800 tons. By (ii) Ab-i-Gerger, 42 miles by river to Shelai- lieh, thence 6 miles to Shustar. The stream is nar row and winding, about 50 or 60 yards broad, some turns are so sharp that a boat of over 100' length would be unable to get round them. Navigation open from January to August for small light draught steamers. During the low season a good sized steam launch could proceed. Bevond Shelailieh navigation is impossible at any season owing to^ rocks and shingle. Village passed, Kut Sayad Hassan, 150 men, 40 horses, 20 to 30 mules, 50 to 60 donkeys. Dizfitl (iii) . ... ... By the river Diz from Band-i-Kir. During 60' the spring rises of the river, navigation is possible for a large light draught steamer as far as Deh-i- Nao, about 100 miles by river, and 20 miles from Dizful by land, but there is no surveyed route, on record, between these points. As far as Kut Bandar, the river is navigable throughout the year for small steamers ; distance from Band-i-Kir between 70 and 80 miles. The course of the river is very tortuous, through flat uncultivated plains, and extensive jungles. The Arabs on the banks muster about 2,000 strong ; about half are armed with M.-H. rifles. Provisions, such as meat, wheat and barley and perhaps some mules might be obtained at Sayad Ahmad Tafik s encamp ment on the right bank. At present no native boats trade on the river.^ On March 18th, 1893, the stern-wheel steamer “ Shushan ” ascended the Diz as far as Jisir, about 14 miles from Dizful, in a direct line. The river is from 100 to 250 yards wide. The current runs at 3 knots below and 5 knots above Kut Bandar. (Plant.) The following is Commander Plant’s report on the passage of the Diz from Band-i-Kir up to Jisir:— Berate Island. —Channels intricate, snags at top end of islands. Sayad Ahmed Tafik. —Channels intricate. t , , Kut Bandar. — Rocks extend across river. Good channel on 8. side. Shingle bed from here up stream ; no holding for anchors. Good landing place for troops, covered by series of mounds. Kut Lavi or Kut Kalawi. —Bend in river very sharp and small; current very strong. High mounds to S.-W., running N. W., afford commanding position on right bank. Tiytaka Island and Kut Gastir. —Numerous snags in river and shallow water a both places. ZTm-o-Ne/K—Shingle bank stretching across river. Channel very narrow and watei extremely powerful. , Ab-o-brais and Jisir. — Rapids extend across the river at these two places an navigation very difficult and dangerous.293 No. 56. Regan to Minab.

Just beyond this point is a camping-ground called Khar-i-Yagun, 300 yards to the right of the road, with a small stream of running water ; its position is marked by a solitary date palm. At 13f the road is very narrow for 20 yards, but can be turned by a detour to right or left. There is a spring of water here, which is only just drinkable. Now commence a second ascent, which the guide called Danuneshkan. At J5£ miles very rough for about 15 yards. About a furlong further there is another point where improvement would be required, for about 25 yards, before field guns could pass (tlev. 1,700'). The road now descends gradually to Gino.

Out of the town by the Isfahan gate, then turn ing to the right, following the road alongside the ditch of the town for three-quarters of a mile, tak ing a direction S.-E., proceeded to the village of Jafarabad, 4J miles from the gate. The road is quite flat, and for the most part passes through cultivated ground. Jafarabad is a small village, with a private house and garden belonging to a Shiraz merchant. Pul-i-Fasa is 6 miles beyond. It is a bridge of nine small arches and crosses a small stream, which runs into the salt lake some few miles further on. It rises in the marsh of Karabagh, some 6 miles to the westward. At present its waters are sweet, but as the season progresses, they become brackish and undrinkable. The road from Jafarabad to the bridge ran through a perfectly level plain, marshy in places, with a slight salt efflorescence here and there. During heavy rains it becomes very soft, and the going is bad. Distance, in No. of stage. MILES. Names of stages. Inter mediate.

From Pul-i.Fasa the road goes along a level plain skirting the outlying spurs of Mahal u until a point of the hill, projecting into the plain, is reached (14 miles), llirection to this point E., afterwards S.E. On the one hand, the road runs very close to the hills; and on the other, to the salt lake. At 8 miles from the bridge, reach a second point. This is the one seen from Shiraz. The road for some distance continues near to the hills, but afterwards the plain opens out, the road following the line of the lake. About 8 miles from the village of Mahalu passed a place which is known as Dobanah. There is no habitation, but several disused wells and a couple of trees. About 5 miles before reaching the village, passed through cultivation which continues up to the village. Just before entering it, there was a small stream of water, clear and sweet. This stream is used to drive a mill. Mahalu gives its name both to the lake and to the hills above it. These are fine bold limestone bluffs standing some 4,000 feet above the plain of Shiraz. The village is in rather a tumble-down condition, built on each side of a dry water-course. It consists of about 80 houses, built of mud and stone, inhabited by some 350 people; revenue 11,500 krans. Wheat and barley beyond that kept for home consumption, are sent into Shiraz for sale. No mules, but about 1,000 donkeys, 40 oxen for tillage, and some 2,000 sheep. Sarvistan Btmzu. 5,200' or 25^ 49i For the first mile or two the road somewhat stony. Just outside the village cross a small stream, strongly impregnated with sulphur. At 3| miles pass a village under the hills to the right about 2 miles off, called Pusht-i-Par, consisting of about 20 houses. Direction of road here somewhat more easterly; pass a road on the right going to Kharanjan, a village in the plain, Road now on a smooth plain, bearing S.-E. again. Going very easy. Pass a village and gar den close to the road, called Bukat, about 100 inhabitants. At 7 miles end of the salt lake, and shortly come on ground resembling the Bushahr Mashilah, but not quite so bad. Follow this for 4 or 5 miles ; then a smooth plain with some little scrub. At 12 miles Khairabad. The village consists of about 20 houses built of mud bricks, the whole surrounded by a high wall, with towers at each corner; 100 inhabitants. From here the road leads over easy coun try, covered with short brushwood. At 18 miles pass the small village of Kanao. Several kanats of good water. At 20 miles village of Husenabad, then Kala Gumbaz. Here also good water. After leaving this village, country well cultivated, a small canal of running water running close beside the road the whole way up to Sarvistan. The whole road is per fectly flat and easy-going, being part of the Shiraz plain. To this point wheeled carts could be easily brought. Sarvistan is a thriving place, consisting of about 300 houses, with a population of 1,000 people; 2,500 donkeys, no mules or camels, 52 oxen for tillage. Maliyat, 1,500 tomans. Water good. Road S.-E. through a level plain, somewhat stony in places. At 4| miles a deep gully, with a small stream of water at the bottom. After another three-quarters of a mile pass a second stream, and immediately enter some low hills, and gradually ascending for some 2f miles reach a tower on the side of the Kuh-i-Siah, another tower being on the top of the spur. The whole of this piece of country resembles the bit of road on the top of the gatch hills between Ka- marij and Kazrun. A short, easy ascent to the top of the pass. Thence the road takes a south-south-easterly direction, and, winding for some 4| miles among low hills, crosses a small stream. The country between the road, which runs almost along the side of the Kuh-i-Siah and the hill on the left, is completely seamed with gullies and water-courses, and a very tumbled-about appearance. A little pick and shovel work in places would make this portion of the road available for wheeled traffic. It is, however, the roughest part yet crossed; it is on the whole fairly level, and there are no abrupt ascents or descents. The hills are everywhere more or less wooded, with wild almond and wild pistachio. After crossing the stream, the road passed through a semi-sort of jungle of the above trees for 4 miles, until reaching Mian Jangal. This is but a ruined caravansarai in the middle of the plain, as its name indicates. Mian Jangal 5,710'. 16* 65 i308 No. 60. Shiraz to Bandar Abbas, via Darab and Furg. No of stage.

The whole road practicable for two-wheeled carts. Direction S. S. E. About a mile beyond is » deserted and almost ruined caravansarai by the roadside. Just behind the caravansarai is a good spring of water. The snow line seems to be some 500' above this point. After leav ing the caravansarai, the road gradually descends, skirting the bases of a series of low gravel hills, until it comes out on the Fasa plain. Fasa seems to be in a most flourishing condition; the houses well built, and the street somewhat cleaner than the generality of Persian towns. Great quantities of wheat, barley and opium grown. There are no special industries in the place; the whole of the working population appear to be engaged in agriculture. Tem perature here much milder than that of Shiraz. Provisions of all sorts very plentiful. Water good and in fair quantity, chiefly brought into the plain by kanats. The gardens about the town and villages are filled with fruit trees of all descriptions. The date-palm here bears fruit. JMaliyat, 180,000 krans. Population 5,000. Naebandagan . 13 96 4,280'.

Pass Harun (5 miles). Shortly after leaving this village, the road goes S. E., and the dry bed of a stream is crossed. Still keeping to the plain, and through heavily cultivated ground, pass by the village of Ghiasabad- the road here getting somewhat more to the S. At 13 miles village of iNarbandagan. Narbandagan is a large and prosperous walled village. It contains 700 houses with a population of 3,500 people. The village owns 88 oxen for tillage, 4,000 sheep and 4,000 donkeys ; no mules, Carts could be brought here from Fasa without any difficulty. The village, however, is about half a mile from the main road, which runs along the base of some low hills nearly straight to Jelyan. Water is plentiful along the whole road. The plain has numerous villages dotted over it, and also a number of watch-towers ; but the latter are falling into ruin. The plain of Fasa is completely surrounded by hills, and presents somewhat the appearance of an elongated diamond. It is probably about 20 miles long E. to W., and 12 broad N. to 8. Abbott describes a more southerly route from Fasa Kala Zuhak and Muhammadad to Narbandagan. Shashdeh 12 108 4,670'. For 3| miles the road continues along the plain up to the village of Jelyan, which pass on the right hand. After going another mile, rounding some low hills, the bed of a river, about 80 yards across, is passed ; there is scarcely any water in it. Shortly after wards (three-quarters of a mile) a fair stream, crossed by a very primitive sort of bridge ; three-quarters of a mile further on, and the village of Murdi is reached. The stream runs by the side of the road the whole way, and is known by the same name as the village. The village only contains 50 houses ; 20 oxen and 600 sheep are owned by the village, but no donkeys or mules. After going another 2 miles along the base of some low hills, enter a somewhat narrow defile, the road here rather stony. The defile extends for about a mile, the hills on the left side being somewhat precipitous for the last half mile ; those on the right sloping and broken. Having passed through, the road comes out on the plain of Shashdeh. An easy ride of 3 miles, along a level and good road, brings one to the village of that name. Shashdeh is a large and prosperous place with about 200 houses.309 No. 60. Sttiiiaz to Bandar Abbas^ vid Darob and Fnrq. No. of stage. Distance, in milks. Names of stages. Inter mediate, Total.

This consists of a large tower surrounded by four high walls wells of good -water. It belongs to the Kawam-ul-Mulk. The plain has numerous water courses, some dry, some with running water, also numbers of wells about this portion of it. 'J he soil appears to be exceptionally good. At 2 miles pass a small open village called Tangabad. This may be considered to he at the entrance of the defile called Tang-i- Bulaghi. From this point the hills close in rapidly. Darakueh is a small and somewhat dilapidated village. It contains 100 houses. ’ Dabab 4,045'. 24 145 Before reaching the top of a small kotal, the road passes through some low hills, and over somewhat stony ground. It then follows the side of the hills on the left-hand for half a mile; then a short turn to the S. S. E. of a quarter of a mile brings one to the top of the descent into the Darab plain. Twenty-one minutes’ walking down an easy, hut in places somewhat rocky, descent brings one on to the plain. This portion of the road would present some difficulties to wheeled vehicles, but a little work would soon make it practicable, except at the small kotal. Close to the foot of the descent into the Darab plain pass two conduits. At 9 miles pass the village of Husenabad. The plain here is covered with kanar trees, and also clumps of myrtles. The soil appears to he alluvial, giving crops of great richness. The plain is well watered by numerous small streams of good water. Villages and gardens in every direction. The hills on the left hand, along the bases of which the road runs, present to the eye a succession of rugged crags with perpendicular sides. For the most part they appear to be pure limestone. Along a road at times slightly stony near to the base of the hills. At 13£ miles cross the Chashma Gulabi, a fine spring ; the water is beautifully clear and limpid. Pass a hill which consists of fine salt. It is called Kuh-i-Nimak, it is a very remarkable object in the landscape. At 16 miles pass another stream ; then the village of Bakht-i-Gird on the right about a mile ; at 19 miles come in sight of the Kala Darab. Soon afterwards, passing between two small hills, reach the town (23 miles), and passing through the whole length of the town, at 24 miles reach the Kala. The garden is full of date, orange, lemon, and rose trees. The plain of Darab generally resembles that of Kazarun, but the trees are more fully grown. Owing to the mild temperature of the place, lemons are found on the trees ripening all the year round. Iliats pitch their camps, and remain here all through the year. From the foot of the pass the country again admits of wheeled carriage being used. The hill above the town is called Kuh-i-Maadan, because of the number of mines in it. It is said that copper, iron, and silver are all to he found here. None are worked at present nor have they been for a great number of years. The popula tion of the town is about 6,000. Supplies are plentiful. The climate is mild. Numerous gardens producing various fruits surround the town. Abbott makes the total distance only 141 miles, while Ouseley makes it 154, but the latter seems to have wandered off the track and diverged S. during the last 50 miles and traversed some difficult country. 9 [ Deh Khaib .1 10 I 155 i Round the hills to the S.

About an hour’s ride further on, along the same hills, which have many beautiful springs, brings one to the place known as the caravansavai, a place cut out of the solid rock. The stone quarried out has been used for building up portions of this place and for part of the roof. It may have been used as a mosque, a house, or caravansarai, or perhaps a church. Deh Khair is a prosperous place with many gardens, and also some signs about that once it bod been a big place. Passed in the plain several remains of the water-course above referred to.

At 2 miles some low hills, and passing through them for half a mile, reach the Dasht-i-Taskat. A long level plain, about 50 miles in length and some 15 broad. At the far end (N. N. W ) is the Baluk-i-Fardanin ; 7 miles off, somewhat more northerly is the village of Dasht-i-Konar; opposite, nearly due S., a long range of hills called Galagah. This range seemed to bound the southern side of the plain for its whole length. Follow the plain along the base of some low hills on the left hand. Distance 19 miles. The plain is covered in nearly every direction with salt efflorescence, and in some parts the going is very soft, but easy. Carts could be used without difficulty, except during rainy weather. Just before turning to the N. E., around a point of the hills, is the direct road to Furg. After passing this point, the plain opened out to the N.

About the plain, date topes seen in every direction. At 6 miles passed the road from Tarun to Lar; then the direct road from Furg to Bandar Abbas. At 9 miles cross a small stream; then a larger branch of the same river, both quite salt; the latter about 10 feet wide with a depth of 6 or 7 inches. The plain is all more or less salt, very soft, and after heavy rains would be very bad going indeed. It is cut up by several water-courses. The Kala of Sadatabad is completely in ruins, the people all living in date huts. There is a very fine stream of water running through the place. The latter part of the plain within some 2 miles of the village, is covered with a semi-sort of jungle of gaz trees. Here the most direct route between Saidabad, (stage 11, Route No. 17,) and Bandar Abbas is entered upon and followed onwards. 15 Ghabah Gttba. 2,000'. 33! 289§ The road for the first 2 miles somewhat up hill slightly stony; then enter the Tang-i-Lambi winding for about some 20 minutes among low hills, and then out on to a small plain about 6 miles long by 4 wide. The Tang in no place difficult; in some places a bit stony, but other wise good. Crossing the plain, by the side of the road on the left hand, is a small canal of water called Khunab (bloodwater). At the end of the plain the road makes a short sharp descent into the dry bed of a river, and then upon mounting the other side immediately enters the Tang-i-Zagh. This is a difficult place; the windings of the defile very consider able ; the hills on each side often nearly perpendicular, exhibiting at times most wonderful colouring and queer shapes. After getting through the defiles, the road bends to the S. W., and gradually ascends; highest point by aneroid 26‘30. Then giadually descending, it enters the dry bed of a river, and, following this for some 5 miles, passes the village of Abmah, about a mile to the left. For some way the road runs between highish hills, and no distant view is to be got. The whole of the latter part of the way is stony, and by far the worst going yet experienced. It would be difficult to get vehicles through either pass or over some parts of these river beds, but not by any means an impossibility. A very little labour would render the whole route quite practicable. The hills hereabouts are more like mud heaps than hills. Many flourishing date topes about. Gharab has no proper village oi houses. The houses or huts of date palm leaves are erected all over the place under the date trees, which are very numerous. There are 350 such huts.312 No. 60.

The Kuh-i-Zaratu, cut up by water-courses, leads down to the little village of Zaratu, a small place nestling under the hill. Excellent camping place, nice patches of green turf under fine date trees, with a good spring of fresh water rushing from the hill side. This spring continues good all through the year. Although the road now is not available for vehicles, owing to the numerous deep water-courses which intersect it, yet a little work would soon make it fairly practicable.

The road goes over level ground. 300'. Near Shustar the few cultivated fields show what could be done if this country were inhabited by an industrious people. The alluvial plain would be impassable after rain, the soil is so deep and clayey. Here and there are large patches of jungle.

Band-i-Kir has about 80 Arab inhabitants. Supplies plentiful. 27 52 The Gargar, 50 yards wide and very deep, has first to be crossed by boat. The road thence is level and good.

To the north and east the ground is undu lating; the way (there is no track) soon meets the Gopal river as it meanders slowly between mud banks 18' in height. It has a taste of naphtha, and is the same brackish water that is found in the marsh, which in fact is fed by it. On the banks of the stream are the “ Bowie tribes summer grounds. There are signs of cultivation. The Gopal showed marks of flood 6 highei than its normal level. It was 30' broad and 3' deep when crossed. McGowan (in February 1895) describes this river as 40 yards wide, and very deep, and rapid. _ Ihe road, tor a trac has commenced, leads through marly and gypsum hills to a raised plain, and the head waters of one of the branches of the Gopal is crossed. The way is along the plain to the village ot Mir Bacha, which is situated on a “ teppe thence the plain slopes gent y down to Ram Hormuz. We halt half way down. Samples of the naphtha from the well on the road to Shustar shown on St. John’s map were examined, and prove to be excellent there is no much of it they say, and the spring has been known to fail entirely after catching fire, ine water here is slightly brackish. .

Kurdistan (Jarahi) river, bounded on the south by a low range of hills, not shown on St. John’s map, and on the north by a lofty range. We are marching upstream and 2 miles parallel to and north of it, so have to cross the deep cut courses of many mountain torrents. Their sides could be ramped for the passage of vehicles. Six and a quarter miles (two farsahhs) from Rustamabad is Sultanabad, a small village with a few date palms and some bean cultivation. The valley is here about miles broad, and the river only 1| miles to south. A few miles further on the road comes right to its bank. There are large quanti ties of Icanar trees in the plain, and aspens along the river side. This would be a fertile spot if it had a settled population. After passing the fourth torrent at right angles to the road, we come on some cultivated ground, and halt. Deh Kobaiseh 25 161 Direction E. About 4 miles east of Jaizun the valley narrows considerably, and the road, no longer able to follow the river, strikes across the spur from the mountains, which spur here closes the valley. The road, though rough, could easily be knocked into shape, having no steep gradients, and the rocks mostly being conglomerate. From the north-east side of the spur a fine view of the Behbahau plain is gained. The town is in the middle distance, with a fine range of mountains to the north, with their snowy caps bounding the view in that direction. A low range of hills to the south divides the plains of Behbahan from that which runs down to the Persian Gulf, and turns the river Jarahi west into the valley, up which we have been travelling. On the left the road from Potek is seen, with the plain on that side a deep green from Icanar clumps. St. John’s map shows the Potek road as joining at Kai-Kaus; but this is incorrect. There is no such place on the Ram Hormuz road. Deh Koraiseh has only about 15 inhabitants. 8 Behbahan 1,300'. 11 172 Direction E. A stream from the direction of north has first to be crossed, and 3 miles from camp the river Jarahi itself forms a for midable obstacle. From bank to bank it is 70 yards wide, and in flood would be at least 6 feet deep; it is a rapid stream, and even when only 45 yards wide is only fordable by strong men, being up to the horses’ girths. In spring it would be a nasty flood to pass. Fine cover of tamarisk and oleander marks its course, whilst beyond palm groves, villages and cultivated ground present an unwonted sceno of prosperity and security for this part of Persia. The rest of the road easy and level. The town has practically no walls; the population is between four and five thousand; it seems thinly peopled and tumbledown, yet delightfully clean compared with Dizful and Shustar. The water-supply is poor. Water has to be stored in abambars or subterranean chambers for summer use. There is a regiment of infantry and a few guns here. McGowan made the marches from Mir Bacha as follows:— Hormuz, 2, farsakhs, Sultanabad, 4 farsakhs, Jaizun, 4 farsakhs, Koraiseh, 7 farsakhs, Behbahan, 2\ farsakhs. 9 Khaieabad river 15 187 Direction E.

Camp near the river, which is 30 yards wide and easily fordable, though in spring it would be a formidable obstacle, being rapid with a stony bed. The road is easy with a slight ascent. McGowan reports the river (in April 1895) as deep with strong current, and only fordable under guidance of experts, and states that, during the rainy season, it would be unfordable. There is a good bridge a little below the ford, one or two of the centre arches of which are broken down. It could, however. Direction S. E. The road commences well— gradually ascends to the plain of Lishtar, 4 miles wide by 10 miles long—a grand pasture.

Icanars give shade, whilst the Shams-ul-Arab stream, which bounds it on the south-east, supplies good water. The above-named stream is small, except in time of flood. After crossing it we enter rounded gypsum hills, and are amongst them for 4 miles of road ; after which, crossing the water-parting between Shams-ul-Arab and the Do-Gumbazan stream (altitude 2,480'), the road become? level with hills on either side. That of Shah-Kuh on the right front is remarkable in shape. The mountain on the left, marked on the map as Kuh-i-Kuma, but known as Kuh-i-Dil, must be at least 10,000' in height. They say the stream from this plain is lost in a marsh. The water from the snows of Kuh-i-Dil mostly goes down the Shams-ul-Arab. At Do-Gumbazan is a ruined caravansarai and a small village, the first we have seen since Behbahan. 11 Basht 2,730'. cultivation.

A little of almost perpendicular limestone rise from it, and form the The road runs to the N. E., and turns the east end of the mountain without much difficulty by threading between the knife edges of the re markable limestone formation, and ascends a slight kotal called the Tang-i-Narik (altitude 3,230'). To the east of the mountain the country is quite parklike with the oaks, which have again appeared. On nearing Basht the road was so bad, following a zigzag for 1| miles, that we had often to dismount; but a better track exists. The small stone fort of Basht would hold 70 men. There is a permanent garrison. At Basht^ is a fine open valley running W. by N. to E. by S. with small stream capable of becoming an awkward flood. This in its normal condition trickles over a stony bed down the centre of the valley. The people (there are only about 100) are at feud with all their neighbours, and never dare wander out of sight of home. Large clumps of wild myrtle dot the plain. A road goes from here to Mian kotal, and is reported to be good. The snowy peaks above Dasht-i-Arjin were visible from Do-Gumbazan. Direction E. by S. From Basht the road leads down and across the valley, past mounds evidently sites of ancient fortified places, and enters the low hills on the N. W.; it ascends only to descend again, so as to hit off a water-course, which must be occupied by a considerable torrent at times. Thence through a parklike valley with fine oaks. ^ At the head of this is the first serious obstacle to vehicles since Behbahan, viz., the Guzinjan ridge, which is of limestone rocks. The ascent, coming from the west, is nothing, hut the descent of half a mile into the Chal-i-Mora plain is steep, rough, and difficult. The view from the Guzinjan ridge (altitude 2,780') is fine. The Chal-i-Mora valle}', almost perfectly flat, has its alluvial soil standing level up against the stony hills. A narrow gorge admits the river, which meanders from the N. E., escaping by an equally narrow gor'e to the W. The plain extends to the E., like an arm of the sea, the sluggish stream of the Sar-ab-i-Siah (locally called Tang-i-Sher) draining this arm, and falling into the main stream 2 miles from the ridge. The fords of the main river and that of the Sar-ab-i- Siah are easy. McGowan (in April 1895) describes the Ab-i-Siah as follows Its bed is very wide and is banked by thick jungle. In winter it must be quite impassable, now it is fordable and that is all. The fori is just above where a remarkable mound, evidently artificial, is now crowned by a ruined mosque. The mound is circular in shape, has 40' of steep scarp, and 70'diameter. The Sar-ab-i Siah evidently was formerly led round the E. side of the mound as well as the W., and a wet ditch was thus secured ; but now there is only water on the W. Tal-Espid plain is similar to that of Chal-i-Mora in character, only more circular than oblong, which is the shape of the former. One’s attention is attracted by the square mud towers of the Lur inhabitants, all placed on artificial mounds command ing the tents or huts at their feet. These Lur people stay here all the year round, but prefer not to build houses for fear of the tax-gatherer getting a firmer hold of them by means of their fixed residences.317 No. 61.

The valley is pretty and well wooded, though narrow and steep banked. The road could be made very good, as the gradients are not very difficult. Rice cultivation is seen near the water wherever the valley widens, and now and then clumps of myrtle appear. A solitary mill is the only habitation. The track, leaving the head-quarters of the Sal or Sul, turns east through a narrow gorge capable of carrying a good road, and by easy gradients the watershed that divides us from the^plateau of Tang-i-Rudian is reached. (Altitude 6,950'). Having crossed this, the descent to the banks of the Tang-i-Khast or Fahliun river, which here is called the Tang-i-Rudian river, is easy and gentle. We are now on an extensive plateau, bounded on the north by the Kuh-i-kum-Firuz, on the south by the lofty range that runs west from Dasht-i-Arjin, and on the east by the Kuh-i-Barafi of Shiraz and the 'Kuh-i- Kelat; on the west the plateau dies out in the hills that bound the Sul river. The village of Tang-i-Rudian is situated at the bottom of a narrow valley carved out of the plateau by the Fahliun river, which is here, ,as at Kala-Safed, perfectly sweet. 15 GtOYitm . . 24 322 Direction S.-E.

From lal-Espid to Kazarun there is a road down the valley of the Shahpur river vide en 1 , ^ute. This Tal-Espid plain is watered by the fFahliun river, as I prefer to call it (alter the principal village and tribe of Tal-Espid plain). It is shown as Ab-i-Shur to- ii S “ a P’. and as the Rudian river and Tang-i-Khast or Shashpir on my sketch. Rice fields seem to absorb the whole of the rapid stream, for not a drop could we see in the watei-course which leads from the plain to the south-west; but numerous irrigation channels were to be traced, notably the one leading to the head of the Sar-ab-i-Siah valley. 13 P o L .'n/ T * 16 273 5 Follow the Tal-Espid plain to N. E., straight 3 ’ 630 • to a steep rugged kotal (altitude 3,830'). Ob viously there must be a better line for a road where the river enters the plain. Having des cended the other side of the kotal, reach the river again, and 2 miles further up stream the root ot the precipitous hill, named Kala-Safed, from the white colour of its rocks, and its being used as a stronghold in time of disturbance. There is only one way to the top, and that no easy one. The sides are scarps of perpendicular rock. This hill should be on the left bank ; it is marked on the wrong side of the river in St. John’s map. Just by Kala- bafed the Fahliun river is joined by the Sul stream from the north, the main stream from the east, being hero called the Tang-i-Khast river. It is 18 yards wide and 3' deep, flowin 0 ' very rapidly. It gets the name of the Tang-i-Khast stream from a narrow gorge, through which it flows. _ This gorge would be the natural direction of the road to Shiraz ; but for some reason the Sul is followed in its north-easterly direction, and along it a very rou°-h bit of country is encountered. ° The road crosses the Sul stream no less than four times in 3 miles, and is bridged at the fifth crossing by the Pul-i-Murt (“ Bridge of the Myrtles ”). At this Pul we rested for the night, there being an old caravansarai. The Pul-i-Murt is named after the extraordinary fine myrtle that flourishes in groves near at hand. Oleander and wild almond too flourish in this narrow valley, shut in and protected as it is from winter blasts. The people on this side of Behbahan are totally different in appearance from the Bakhtiari, the fine-drawn Arab, or the flat-faced Kuh°-elu Lurs we have been accustomed to. Here the Mamaseni Lurs are the finest looking men I have seen in Persia. They have a handsome, Jewish cast of countenance, with very aquiline noses and long beards ; the moustaches drooping and lighter coloured ; the hair also light brown ; the eyes often are black but sometimes grey.318 No. 61- Shustar to Shiraz, vid Ahwaz and Behbohan.

As this route has been travelled over by Scbin'Ih'r and Gill, it is quite unnecessary to make a road report. As, however, I am the only European who has travelled by both of the Karman—Yazd routes, a comparison may not be out of place. I would, firstly, mention that, for an army marching by the Southern route, there are three desert stages if the postal route be followed. Coming from Kanuan the tirst of these is Shams, where there is only a post house, a dilapidated caravanserai and indifferent water. This march cannot be avoided, but the next two stages of Karmanshahan and Zehn- u-Din, where the conditions are slightly worse, can be escaped. In order to effect this from Shams the march must be directed to Mehdiabad, which lies a/arsaA’A to the north of Karmanshahan. There, instead of filthy and foul water, together with no supplies, the force can he distributed among the three fair-sized villages of Hosseinabad, Bandarun and Mehdiabad. This march is 18 miles. Next day Girdkuh, the centre of another cluster of villages, can be reached in 13J miles. This village is to the north of Kuh-i-Girdkuh and not where shown in the I. D. W. A. map. The road is excellent on all these marches. The main route will be rejoined by a march of 16| miles to Sar-i-Yazd. Passing Mazra Ali Beza Khan at 2 miles, while near Sar-i-Yazd numerous villages and hamlets are found. This deviation is only some 6 or 7 miles longer, but its immense advantages have, I hope, been made tolerably clear. To turn to the Zarand-Pafk route, between Bafk and Pahraj—a distance of 51 miles, the water-supply is entirely dependent upon a few tanks, which, at most, could supply a force of five hundred men. During my journey in March 1894, these haozes were full, but in May 1895 I was informed that they were dry. Supposing that the deviation from the Postal route, described before on the Southern route, be followed, together with the fact that there is a Telegraph line, no doubt can be felt that the Bahramabad-Anar route is the best. A reference to my routes will show that I have compiled the details of twelve roads connecting the two main routes, so that, in the case of a large force, a percentage could use the Zarand-Bafk route, especially as their northern flank'is pretty secure, the great desert stretching for a great distance in that direc tion. I would also mention that at Bafk, the altitude sinks to nearly 3,000 feet, whereas by the Southern route there is no reading below 4,000 feet until the plain of Yazd be reached. No. 2.

Then enter the Sarpaniran valley, between the Miyan Mullah and Tang-i* Bnlaki hills, about miles wide. This valley is occupied in the summer by the semi-nomad Nish Mast, who cultivate a narrow strip down the centre of the valley and own a village, about 3 to 4 miles off the road, which is deserted in winter. Water from kanats. A track from Sarpaniran to Kala-i-Kurshul and Kadarabad starts from the point where the road enters the Sarpauiran valley. Jawa Khan 8 12 Road crosses the valley by an easy descent and ascent and then crosses a continuation of the Miyan Mullah hills, winding round spurs to an unimportant pass; then down a short defile, with rocky sides, to a small opening about f mile wide. At the opposite side of this the road turns sharp east through a defile about ^ a mile long, with high rocky sides. The road from Arsinjan to this point is everywhere commanded. From the end of this defile till near the bottom end of the valley, which extends to the Baonat hills, the country is undulating. After a steep descent, of about ^ mile over rock and boulders, a small stream is reached, flowing from kanats near by. To the west a low spur from the hills obstructs the view, but to the east is a continuous inclined plain. Four Arab katas visible to the right and Bagh-i-Siah to the left. After crossing the stream the road ascends slightly and passes many kanats during the next 4 or 5 miles. At about 6 miles from Jawa Khan low hills approach the road on either side and gadually close in, till, at about 1| miles from Jawa Khan, they are barely 200 yards apart. The hill to the left then recedes, leaving a small open space, miles long hy | mile wide, near the top end of which Jawa Khan is situated. From Arsinjan a track runs to the east of that described above, by the Tang-i-Eshkan to Husenabad and Jawa Khan. It is about a farsakh longer. Mazvan 16 After ^ a mile the road enters the tortuous defile of a mountain stream, with high precipitous sides, passing up the boulder-encumbered bed for about ^ a mile. Then, rising gradually, the road follows the right bank of the stream almost to its source. Half a mile further it turns north-west and descends sharply for 2 to 3 miles passing a small stream, the Ab-i- Garm, half way, where boulders form a somewhat serious obstacle. At the foot of the descent the road keeps along the foot of the hills it has just crossed till an Arab shrine, the Pir-i- Kudu, is reached. Here there are several clear springs and a clump of large trees. Ine road now turns sharp to the right down the centre of a valley, between two spurs of the hills. Badvar is passed to the right, almost hidden amongst trees, and from this point to Mazyan there is almost continual cultivation. 4 SlBIN 4 20 Road turns west, across the end of a spur, and is narrow, winding and stony. Sarbistan lies below in a narrow valley, and further on, but not visible, is Kadamgah, The road now descends gradually, for about 3 miles, into the Baonat valley. From the point where the road enters the Baonat valley a low spur continues due north for about 2 miles; Baz is situated at the end of it, and Shidan lies further away to the right. Jamalabad is situated near the foot of the slope, and from there to Sirin the road keeps near a stream, which flows down the centre ot the valley. The road is undulating and fair, but at one or two points it crosses cultivation, and at others it is encumbered with stone. The stream is crossed bv a ford a mile from Sirin.325 No. 5.

Up to this point the road is narrow but not obstructed. After passing the summit the road turns south-west and descends over undulating ground till it reaches the bed of a mountain stream, the right bank of which is followed to a walled village called Tangan. On the south side of the summit there is an underground winter shelter. Just beyond Tangan there is a steep ascent for 20 minutes and then a gentle descent of 2| miles, when a sharp turn suddenly brings Sema Khan into view. Serna Khau is clustered round a tower, on the top of a detached rock, in the centre of a narrow valley. There is another road from Sirin, said to be 2&gt;farsakhs shorter, but much worse for animals. Kadarabad 6,250'. 6 12 The road for the first 3 miles is undulating, with a very gradual descent; then for the next 6 or 7 miles it crosses a valley, passing the katas of Khan Jan and Abbasabad, other kalas being visible in the distance. At the bottom end of the valley the road crosses the Serna Khan stream and, turning east, enters low hills. Road very bad indeed. After passing through a rocky defile, 1| miles long strewn with loose stones, the road becomes more open. Kadarabad consists of a small kala with a larger one built round it. Kamin, 5,800'. 161 The road skirts the low hills, enclosing the Murghab—Madr-i-Suliman plain, and would probably be muddy in winter. One or two small spurs are crossed and Kurdashal is passed to the west of the road, At the entrance to the Tang-i-Kamin the road turns sharp to the right, and for the first half-mile this defile is very narrow, with precipitous sides, the road crossing the stream several times. After that the defile becomes a trifle more open, till, at 1§ miles from Kamin, the hills on the west side fall away rapidly. There are a great many kanats here.

Tudashk is a large village, and is the usual stage from Kupha At 11| miles a salt hanat crosses the road, running south, and shortly after the Nain-Varzunna track crosses. At 18| miles low hills are entered. To the north Bad Fashun lying some three miles away under the hills, and, after a couple of mnes througn hills and over a stony track, Mazra Yakab. Thence it was but a few yards to our camp, below the remains of the fort of Guchkun. Here we tasted sweet water for the first time since leaving Natanz, a distance of nearly 100 miles. Guchkun is the head of a district composed of small hamlets. It contains 200 houses. From it there is a perfect view of the great kamr locally termed Kavir Isfandiaran from a large village of that name on its west edge. The Guchkun district pays £400 in taxes. The ruined fort is very ancient and wonderfully pic turesque, being situated on a spur that runs down from the mam range, and completely commands the road. ^ j« or gorae distance we kept rounding spurs of the range lying to the north. At | mile, Marghab lying to the north of the road, and Kahun to the south. At 1| miles Sisna and Lamastuna to the north, and Husseinabad and Yek Baghi to the south. All these hamlets are very small, and lie close to the track. They all have salt or brackish water. At 4 miles Khana Shor to the north, at 6 miles Mazra Takki some three miles to the south, and at 7 4 miles kala Var a tumble-down old fort, inhabited by a very old couple, who complained of the locusts most bitterly. The water, brackish as usual. Shortly after we reached more open country, and could sight villages lying along the kavir, viz-. Hossemabad, Ramshan, (a large village on the west side), Luru, Isfandiaran. These villages were some 30 mi es distant. We stil con tinued to skirt the same range, but to the south-west a wide plain stre ched down to the kavir while Kuh-i-Chiras 7,400' rose to the south east, a splendid landmark. At 11 miles Ishratabad, a village to the north, and, shortly after we quit the mam road and turning the corner of the range, suddenly come upon Ushk, a fair-sized village with drinkable watei ; supplies procurable, but not in large quantities. Hence roads lead to Akda, Nain, and Naogunbad. Ushk 13| 29 6,500'. Mazka Amib Khan. 5,850'. the west of the track. 71 1 4 36! A very short march, with a gentle descent during the whole distance.

At miles the road to Kala Yagmahh and Isfahan branched off, and later on we saw the little fort which is one of the stations on the Isfahan road. For 8f miles we steadily descend- our lowest point being 4,650 feet, drainage flowing east. Here the Jcavir was rather bad, and after rain would be almost impracticable. At 10 miles another road branches off to Akda. The grazing was very rich and we found a large flock of camels. Their owners, who at first were afraid that we might be Bakhtiari raiders, told us that on the previous day some 400 sheep had been carried off dose to Serv by these enterprising freebooters. Gradu ally ascending, we crossed a road from Akda to Isfahan at 13| miles. At 18 miles the tiamlet of Kala Shor to the north of the track, and at 18f miles the important village of Serv. Water and supplies fair. From Serv there are routes leading to Isfahan, Nain and Akd 6 . Nodushan 6,300'. 22 771 186, being distance some 4 miles. At needed piece of work.

E. up the rough low hills until at 2 | For many miles the track skirted the Kuh-i- Beduk, the country to the west being open for some 6 or 7 miles, and then broken up with low ranges. At IO 5 - miles the village of Surk bore llj a new haoz is being constructed—a much- road from Akda joins in, and the main direct stage with fair water, branches off. There is a haoz at this spot—dry at the time of my visit. Another 8 miles across a level plain brought us to Nodushan, a small and old town, containing some 500 houses. Its water is brackish, but fresh water is procurable from Bagh-i-Robat, some 3 miles to the south. The town is built on the banks of a wide nala. Branch Abarguh, Ardakan, biain and Maibut. Our track at first lay S nala and, rising through miles, we emerged upon a wide plain, which we marched up, hugging the hills to the east. At 3 miles we passed Bag-i-Robat close to the road, on the west side, whilst we were told that Tulgistan lay some 6 miles to the east. Shortly after, a track came in from the east running from Kom-i-Siah, also some distance off. Continuing on, we passed Khoshab, 4 miles to the west, Hassanabad about a mile, and Sadrabad also to the west, this last being passed at 6 | miles. Gradually ascending at 11^ miles we reached the first spurs of the magnificent range that has no adequate existence on the maps. At 11| miles from a hill to the east, (altitude 9,400') we had our last view of Kuh-i-Fashark and the Isfahan ranges. Close by was a well of sweet water to the west of the road. For 5 miles the ascent continued through unrivalled snow scenery, which we have taken a week to map in detail, so numer ous were the snow peaks. At 14 miles Baid Hari, at 14^ miles Kosuk and at 16| miles Khut, all hamlets with tiny patches of cultivation. A stream of delicious water ran down the valley, the first really good water for many march. At 17f miles we at length reached the Godar-i-Khut 8,500'. From it we had a wonderful view down the valley that leads to Taft. At 20f miles we began to pass hamlets, with excellent water and from this point, down to Nasirabad, cultivation was practically continuous. At 24 miles the small town of Nasirabad, equal in size to Nodushan. The Governor of Yazd generally passes the summer in the gardens above, and indeed they form the best hill station I have yet seen in Persia. This march was rather stony, but the gradients were very easy. Garden Taft. 5150'. above 15f 117x Our route lay down the fertile valley, which at first was some three miles wide, but gradually closed in. The following is the list of hamlets: Zainalabad, Chinarak, Aliabad, Khudabad, Ibra- himabad, Hujetabad, Khushk, Tulum, Haji Ali and Akhun. These hamlets are to the west of the track up to 3 miles, at which point is Kariabad on the track. Descending we331 No. 9. Kupha to Yazd, via Ushk and Nodushan. Distances, in miles. No. of stage.

Shurab at 5^ inilos, Faizabad at 6 miles and Sadikabad at 7 miles, all to the west of the road. At 7 miles Haji Ramazan on the road. At 9| miles the main Shiraz road joins in, and so finishes the large stretch of unexplored country. At 12 miles we pass through the^ large village of Korasha, and after passing Mazra Nawab at 14^ miles, and Mazra Misn Mahomed at 15 miles, we camp at 15f miles in a garden about a mile and-a-balf above Taft bazaar. We bad descended 2,000 feet during the day, and so the climate felt very mild. Owing to being in a narrow gorge, Taft is not as cool as its elevation would lead one to suppose. At 1^ miles we passed through the bazaar, and out into the nala bed, which is very stony. At 2| miles we clear Taft, and the hills end at 6 miles. At 3 miles Husseini to the west of the road, with Mobarka and Cham to the east. Quitting the hills,‘^throush which we had seen Yazd for some time, at 6|- miles we reached Zainabad, at 9| miles Bagh-i-Khan, and so on through Khairabad, Aristan, and Dardaran to Yazd. 8 Yazd . .1 14| 132 4,020'. Note.—T he great advantage of this route for a summer campaign, compared with that via Nain, is its altitude. Nowhere does the route sink to 5,000 feet, whereas by the other route 5.000 feet is nowhere reached. Taking the whole journey from Kashan to Yazd, if the direct route from Natanz to Kupha be followed, this route is but a few miles longer. It is certainly much rougher, and supplies are less plentiful, hut still, as an alternative route, it would he inva- 1 uable Columns using both roads need never lose touch of one another. To take the case of an advance from Yazd on Isfahan, there is a route which hugs the Zamdah Rud, but it has three desert marches before the fertile string of villages commencing with Varzunna be reached. The route then by which I travelled would be much preferable, both on the score of supplies as well as for climate, if the campaign were a summer one. The only road shewn on the map from Yazd to Isfahan runs uid Nain, thus passing by two sides of a triangle, and so being very much longer. The route I followed is used to a considerable ^extent by caravans, and, as the brackish water did not seem to cause sickness, the route is not without importance, especially as the Nain route has one or two stages with very bad water.

At 4 miles the nala bends N, W. and continues in a general N. W. direction n'dil 7-^ miles. At 41 miles a track from Piran joins in on left bank. At 5 miles the track passes throngh a small tangi, 30 yards long and 10 yards broad with low rocks projecting from the bed. The track could be made to go round E. hill of tangi without much difficulty. The rocks would have to be blasted out of the bed, but it is practicable now for laden camels. The nala up to the 6th mile is between low hills, with high mountains in the distance. At 6th mile to the W. the right bank opens out, and there is a large stony, undulating plain, with a thick growth of “garangai” bushes. These are excellent camel-grazing This plain is bounded on the W. by a range of reddish coloured hills, distant 3 miles, and running N. and S. close under which the track from Kutchi and Kejmekran runs. At 7| miles the highest point is reached (3,800 feet), and the track now descends with a slope of 1°, bending gradually N. and enters the Wawaila Nala which runs along the western and northern bases of Kuh-i-Malik Siah. At miles the track from Kejmekran joins in. The track continuing in the bed of the vala. At ll^ miles the ziarat of Malik Siah is reached. The banks of the nala are from 15 feet to 20 feet high, and the ground on left bank is open and undulating. On the right bank Koh-i-Malik Siah rises abruptly. The track still keeping to the nala bed, now bends gradually N. E. until 15 miles and skirts the base of Kuh-i - Malik 8iab The grouud on left bank is open and undulating- On right bank low hills with higher hills beyond. At 15th mile the track leaves the nala bed. turning N.-W., and ascending the left bank, 100 yards further on enters a small plain covered with “ shora plain, f mile long ^ mile wide. A small stream of brackish water runs through the centre of plain. This is known as Maki-Chah. After crossing this plain the track crosses over the low hills to the N. This spot i s known by Jang Jah, and was the scene of a fight between Assad Khan (Naosherwani) and the Muhammadsanis from the Helmand. A good many men seem to have fallen, as the small piles of stones marking the place where each man fell are numerous. After crossing this rising ground the track drops into another nala bed and now leads due N. until the 17th mile, when it ascends the left bank, and 200 yards further on drops into another nala bed in which it continues until the Hurmak springs are reached at 18| miles. The road is good going for all arms, except wheeled traffic. Hurmak, height, 2,800 feet, is a small sandy plain at the junction of two nalas and is surrounded by reddish coloured hills. It is about 1 mile long, | mile broad. It is a favourite halting place for kafilas trading between Seistan and Kachi. Water .—An abundance of good water issuing from springs - 2 in one place, 6 in another The water was slightly warm. Tanks could be made and tbe water collected.

It is essential, however, that it should be Persian, otherwise the Afghans would have the means of stopping any trade between Baluchistan and Persia Shelag River 20 38| The track leads down the nala bed slope 1°, and issues on the daman close on 1 mile from camp. The hills on either side are low and of a light red colour. Mouth of nala, 500 yards wide. The bed is stony. # . At 1 mile the track, still keeping to the nala hed, leads in a northerly direction. The bed here is stony and much cut up with small rain watercourses, some « inches deep and 3 feet broad. A good road could soon be made by clearing awav larger stones, the sub-soil being sand and gravel. The track descends with a gradient of 1°. At 10th mile the plain is reached which is practically level. Up to here there has been an abundant growth of “ lana ” all along the track, and now “ tagaz ” commences. From 10th to 17th mile the track is generally N. Prom 10th mile the stones and gravel give way to sand and fine gravel with “ pat ” sub-soil a few inches beneath. From 12 to 15| miles the track winds in and out of low sand-hills, and the view is very confined owing to the surrounding thick growth of “tagaz. From 15£ to 20 miles the track leads over au open “ pat ” plain, with a soft crust and scattered “lana” bushes. At 17 miles the track leads N. N. E. and the right bank of J'helag River is reached at 20th mile. The road np to 12th mile, though stony, is good going for all arms, except wheeled traffic. From 12 to 15| miles there is no track, and it is heavy sand. From 15| to 20 miles the rate of march would be delayed owing to the soft crus'. SHELAG RIVER. Here the river is 400 yards wide between the crests of the bank. The right bank is 20 feet high and steep. The left bank is sloping. Both banks would require to be ramped, the soil is easy. The water, which is extremely salt and bitter, lies in long pools from 3 feet to 5 feet deep. The water holds so much salt in solution that as it evaporates it leaves a thick deposit on the bed of the river. The natives cut this oat in big blocks for their own use - The soil of the bed is always more or less moist, and is covered with a salt efflorescence. In crossing care should be taken to choose a sandy place, as the soil is so spongy that a very little traffic cuts it up and renders it impassable. After a flood the bed would be im passable for some days. There are flood water-marks some distance from the crest of both banks, so that sometimes there must be 30 feet of water in the river. The river is shewn in the map as flowing the wrong way. When the Helmand gets in flood, as it does once every four or five years, the country to theN., *.e., around Nasirabad and Koh-i-Khwaja and Ramrod, becomes inundated. The water drains into the Shelag River, which then flows into the Gaud-i-Zirieh.344 No. 33. Kuh-i-Malik Siah (Robat) to Nasirabad (Seistan). Distancs, in No. of stage. MILES. Names of stages.

Gibdi-Chah . 12 5(H From the ground where we camped the track went down the right bank for about a mile until there was a suitable place to cross. After crossing the track leads nearly N., with a little E., for 11 miles when Girdi*Chah is reached. The going for whole distance was over pat,” and what was once cultivated lands. The country is open, perfectly flat, good view, and is covered with a sparse growth of tamarisk bushes, or in some places “lana.” After crossing the river at If miles some ruined tombs are reached, the Gumbaz-i-Keg. There are four here and another ^ mile to the S. E. Near this one is a small well, bolding a few gallons of water, it is intermittent in its supply. At 9th mile, f mile to the E. of the road and ^ mile to the S. W. of a tall pillar looking thing, are 3 wells in a “ narwar.” They are shallow, holding only a few gallons each. Some Muhamu adsanis were encamped near here, and it was their whole day’s business to water some 200 or 300 head of sheep. The name of the wells are Miluk, and the pillar like thing is called Mil. The Mil on closer inspection turned out to be a remaining piece of wall of a ruined build ing. It is a good land-mark. The building looks as if it once had been a toll-house on a canal. Girdi-Chah is marked by a mound some 5 feet high, close to which the track runs. The well lies 300 yards W. of this mound in a “ uarwar.” Capacity, 250 gallons, refills slowly. Water muddy, but sweet and potable. Camping-ground .—U nlimited. Supplies. — Nil. (Some flocks of sheep and goats are certainly in the district, but would be difficult to find). Fodder.—GixAs,i, nil.

At 12 miles it rises over a low bank, 5 feet high, running for miles E. and W. on to ft plftt©ftu» From 7 to 12 miles the track leads over hard “ pat,” with scattered tamarisk and “ lana ” bushes. The country to the S. of this bank is called Chapchot, to the N. of it Mishki. The country up to 12 miles shows the signs of inundations, aud the natives say, when the Helmand is in flood, this country is impassable. At 14| miles the ruined walled village of Kundar is reached. From 12 to 14^ miles the country is a hard bare “ pat ” plain, with scattered “ lana ” bushes. The track leading N. N.

At 15£ miles passes three low mounds, £ mile to the E. ^ At 16| and 18 miles the track passes two mounds, mile to the W., these are called Akhor-Raksh-i-Kustam (the stables of Rustam), and it is said he used to keep his horses From Hauzdar the track crosses a bare “pat' plain until the Assak-Chah (wells) are reached at 22| miles. ASSAK-CHAH. There are 30 old wells or pits here, 6 with water in them. The water is 15 feet from the surface, and there is 2 feet of water in each well. The water is brackish and putrid from standing. These wells require a good deal of clearing out before the water is fit to drink. These wells have been dug by herdsmen as a convenience for their flocks. It seems to be the practice, when a well goes salt to dig another. Water is said to be found anywhere on this plain, about 15 feet down. No reason could be given for selecting this spot, especially, except that it was one march. Camping-ground —Unlimited.

The track ascends by a gentle gradient, just to the E. of a promontory crosses a neck of the plateau for 300 yards, and descends by a gentle gradient into a small valley. A large valley of which this is a part extends to the N. and the village of Vremal (Ormal ?) can be seen, distant about 7 miles, to the N. W. The bed of this valley bears the marks of recent cultivation, and there are several small water channels now dry. At 9| miles the track turns N. E. At 9f miles it rises again on to the plateau, and at the 10th mile crosses a depression, some 300 yards wide. Until the 11| miles crosses over the plateau which here is slightly undulating. At Ilf miles the track turns due N. for 600 yards and reaches by a gentle gradient a large level plain when it turns N. E. over this plain which had recently been under cultivation until 12f miles. At 12f miles the track now leads N. until 14th mile (con tinuing N. E. you could reach Sehkuha, which is to be seen 4 or 5 miles to the JST. E.). This portion is very bad going, much cut up by small irrigation canals. At present dry. At 14 miles some white clay cliffs, 30 feet high, are reached. The track skirts these westwards, and at, 14.^ miles a small pond is reached, which is fed by an irrigation canal feet wide, 2 feet of water, and 4 feet deep from, top of banks, which are raised above the level by earth thrown out of the canal. The track now turns N., keeping close under the cliffs between them and the canal. At loth mile the track passes the village of Pusht-i-Dasht, f mile, to the W. It consists of 70 mud houses, mostly domed, all jumbled together and is unfortified. It is built on a low mound. At 15f miles the track crosses a headland of the plateau (to avoid the canal), then takes a bend due W., passing close to the N. of Pusht-i-Dasht and crosses the canal twice. This canal is rather troublesome for laden camels, but the bottom is firm and sandy. Prom the village the track leads N. E. until Husainabad is reached at 19j miles. This last portion of the track is over a level plain, with scattered patches of cultivation, “shora” and “dhub” grass. The going is rather rough, and several irrigation channels are crossed. At 17 miles a small village of mud huts is passed, J mile to the E. The road is perfectly good going for all arms until the cultivated area is reached, when the irrigation channels are troublesome. They would all have to be ramped. No wood available for bridging in the country. The bottom of all the canals is sandy and firm. HUSAINABAD. An unfortified village of some 150 to 200 small mud built huts, built on a low mound. A great many of the huts are domed.

Bearings 123°), con« sists of a fort, built on a hill and the town of 700 or 800 houses, mostly domed, built round it. Part of the town is on another mound to the W. of the fort. Is garrisoned by 40 infantry, and has 2 muzzle-loading 9-pounders, and a few artillery men. The fort is built of mud bricks and is of a flimsy character ; a few shells would soon bring the place down. It has the appearance of falling rapidly into decay. The most westerly mound has a precipitous face, and from the W. at a distance has the appearance of being part of the fort. A good position for guns to shell it would be from the E. on some low hills; guns could be taken there without crossing any irrigation canals. There are some walled gardens to the north. Nasikabad 20 112| The path leads to the village of Daulatabad (beaiing from Husainabad, 335°), distant 2 miles, over a level cultivated plain. At l|- miles a small irrigation canal is crossed. At If miles a smaB irrigation canal is crossed. Daulatabad, 450 to 500 houses, is unfortified, built On a low mound, some small walled gardens surround it. Water in abundance from canals. Supplies of all kinds obtainable. Camping-ground to the W. of village un limited. At 5 miles the path passes through the village of Sadaki. Sadaki .—150 houses, unfortified, built on a low mound. Small walled enclosures and gardens surround it; walls, 4 feet to 5 feet high, mud, 1 foot thick. Supplies of all kinds obtainable. Water (canals) abundant. Camping ground unlimited. At miles Chiling is reached. The road up to here has passed over a level cultivated plain, and the track crosses many irrigation canals which are mostly 4 feet to 5 feet deep from top of the banks and feet wide. Width from top to top of banks which are made by the soil dug out of the canal, 5 to 6 feet. The water in these canals is from the Helmand and flows from E to W. The current is not rapid. The canals would have to be bridged. This would be difficult, as there is no wood suitable in the country for it, or dams made above the crossing place which could be ramped. The bottom of canals is sandy and firm. The soil is light aud easily worked, or parties could be sent and dam the head of these minor canals where they issue from main canals, and then the crossing places could be ramped without difficulty.348 No. 33.

The country between is during the winter months inundated. This year it was a series of lagoons, and was difficult to get across. The water in many places being over the horses’ girths, and some of the baggage camels failed to get across. Some years the water reaches to the base of the walls of Nasirabad Fort, but the depth cannot be over 5 feet in the deepest part. There is no material wherewith to construct rafts, etc. This water begins to recede in April, and as it recedes so is the ground exposed brought under cultivation. Nasirabad.—tUhe residence of the Sartip of Seistan, consists of a fort and an open village, 800 houses, 600 yards to the S.E. There is no bazaar in the village, but certain com modities can be procured, such as kerosine oil (Russian), candles, sugar, cloth, boots, etc.; all these are of Russian manufacture or sometimes German. The trade is almost entirely with Russia at present. Carpenters and blacksmiths of a rough description can be procured. The fort is 600 yards by 350 yards with walls about 20 feet high. The residence of the Sartip is in the N. W. corner, and is walled off from the rest of the fort. The three guns are parked outside his residence at the S. E. corner. The inside of the fort is a mass of small domed buildings and a labyrinth of small narrow alleys. There is a clear space between these buildings, and the walls about 5 feet wide. The corner bastions and the bastions at the gateways have gun platforms, embrasures and ramps leading up to them. The walls are some 6 feet thick, built of mud bricks. The walls of the Sartip’s residence are some 5 feet higher than the walls of the fort. The N. E. portion of the residence is occupied by the audience hall and harem. Io the centre is a duck pond, surrounded by dwellings A parapet, some 6 feet high (this varies in places), is outside the walls at 15 feet distance ; beyond this again at 9 feet distance is a wet ditch, 12 feet broad. The walls of the bastions do not appear to be as thick as the rest of the walls. The gateways are closed by massive wooden doors, which are shut at sundown. No sentry-go is kept. The fort is said to be garrisoned by 800 infautry, 200 cavalry, 3 guns. I could see no lines of any kind. The guns are kept in sheds.Appendix II. No. 1. Mand to Gwadar. Authority —R. A. E.
