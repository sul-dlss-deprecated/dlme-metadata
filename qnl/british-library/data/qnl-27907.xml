Your Royal Highness, I have the honour to inform Your Royal Highness, in reply to the letter No. 7/1/24 which was addressed to this Legation by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on October 17th, that His Majesty’s Government are prepared in principle to agree that the proposed conference concerning the Hejaz Railway should open January 11th. and that an estimate of the cost of reoair should be made by British and French engineers. They state that they would appoint me to represent them in the matter, to assist the conference to the best of my ability but that owing to the demands made upon the staff of the Palestine Railways by the present disturbances it is not possible to state at this moment that the Palestine Railway Administration could send experts to assist me at the conference, and without experts I might be unable to furnish all the information which the conference might require on a variety of technical noints. For the same reason it is unlikely that the said administration will be able to arrange for the estimate of the cost of reoair to be made before January. The said administration have recently made a rough estimate to ascertain what is the very lowest sum for which the part of the Hejaz Railway which lies in Saudi territory could be out into working order, and this estimate, which appears to be in the His Royal Highness, The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mecca.i—jregion of two hundred thousand uounds sterling, at the most could be used by the conference, His Majesty's Government suggest, as a working basis for a general exchange of views as to the best method of procedure. A detailed survey of the line could if necessary be made later. The exact figures of the survey are being sent to me by air and will be communicated to Your Royal Highness in due course.

The first of the High Commissioner’s points (that financial assistance should not be offered in the name of Transjordan) has been dealt with in my telegram No.109 of the 14th October, and as it is not one which is likely to concern you directly, I do not think you need do more than bear it in mind. 3. The second of the High Commissioner’s points concerns the Bompard Declaration. Paragraph 11 of my letter E 1237/1237/23 of the 1st April to the Colonial Office was not intended to suggest that His Majesty’s Government should depart in any way from their present attitude, which is that they cannot accept the contention that the line is on indivisible whole, to be both ov/ned and controlled by the Moslem Advisory Council to be set up/ Sir Reader Bullard, K.C.M.G., C.I.E., etc. , etc. , e tc. , J e dda.&gt; I ■ 6./ k up under the Bompard Declaration. On the contrary, it was intended that if this contention were put forward from any quarter, it should, as in the past, 'be made clear that Kis Majesty's Government could not agree that they were under any obligation to hand over the administration of the Palestine or Transjordan sections to this Council or any international body* 4. This does not mean, however, that His Majesty's Government can refuse, having regard to the terms of the Bompard Declaration, to agree to the establishment of an advisory council of Moslem representatives to make recommendations for the upkeep of the line and the improvement of traffic conditions for pilgrims, even if such a Council is likely to prove an annoyance to the Amir of Transjordan. But His Majesty’s Government need not themselves take any active steps to promote its establishment and can leave these steps to the various Moslem interests concerned. 5. I trust in any case that if the Saudi Arabian representatives at the proposed conference show any disposition to pursue the question of the joint administration of the railv/ay, it may be possible to persuade them of the futility of wasting their energies upon these sterile controversies, which have brought to nothing all previous efforts to provide for the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section. The immediate problem which faces the Saudi Arabian Government is the task of reconstruction and when this has been accomplished and the line is in full working order, it will be time enough to discuss such questions.6. With regard to the third of the High Commissioner s points (the desirability of offering the services of the Palestine Railways Administration for the reconstruction of the line and its operation when reconstructed), I agree that the services of the Administration should be offered to the extent he suggests i.e. for reconstruction only and that the Saudi Arabian representatives should be pressed to accept. But if these services are not accepted, I doubt whether it will be possible to insist on the work being given to a British firm, since it is unlikely that the whole of the funds for reconstruction, or even the greater part of them (so far as the Saudi Arabian section is concerned) will be provided by His Majesty’s Government, 7. I also agree that no offer should be made, at any rate at present, of the services of the Administration for the purpose of the operation of the Saudi Arabian Section of the railway when once the v/ork of reconstruction is finished, and that the offer should be confined to assistance in finding technical and administrative staff, providing facilities for repairs etc., on the lines suggested. 8. You may accordingly put forward at the moment you think most appropriate the suggestions made in paragraphs 9 and 10 of Foreign Office letter E 1237/1237/25 of the 1st April to the Colonial Office, as modified by the two immediately preceding paragraphs of the present letter. 9. You should also repeat at the moment and in the maniier you think most appropriate, the general warning set forth in paragraph 6 of Foreign Office letter E 2113/1237/25 of the 29th April to the Colonial Office, making it clear tha t/that while His iiajesty's Government are anxious out of regard for Ihn Baud to assist him within the limits of their ability in a project on which he has set his heart, they feel considerable doubt as to whether the fulfilment of the project may not prove a disappointment to him. 10. In this connexion it should also be made clear that His Majesty's Government cannot make their financial contribution to the work of reconstructing the Saudi Arabian section or begin work upon the Maan-Mudawara section until the whole of the money necessary for the Saudi Arabian section has been raised and made available. The most satisfactory arrangement would no doubt be for the money to be lodged in some reliable Bank somewhere in the Middle East in the name of a committee of trustees representing the contributors and the persons to be entrusted with the work. The same considerations apply to the supervision of the work on the Saudi Arabian section by the Palestine Railways Administration, who would require to be assured that arrangements had been made for the repayment of theii expenses as and when thsse expenses were incurred. 11. I trust that the information contained in the enclosure to the High Commissioner’s despatch will be of assistance to you in the event of the conference being held in January and no expert being available to assist you. as a matter of fact many of the technical aspects of the question, such as the running of through trains when the line is reconstructed, were considered at the Haifa Conference in 1935 and it will presumably be unnecessary to cover this ground again. Moreover, if the detailed examination/examination of the line by British, French or other engineers has to wait until after the conference the conference may in fact have little to do but make arrangements for the examination to be carried out subsequently, and to consider how the money needed for the work of reconstruction can best be raised, on the assumption that the result of the examination will be to confirm generally the approximate estimate of £f 200,000 given by the Palestine Railways Administration. 12. In this connexion, you should recollect that the offer of £30,000 for the Saudi Arabian section and the reconstruction at their own expense of the Maan-Mudawara section is the limit to which His Majesty's Government are willing to go at present and that the question of how to raise the remainder of the necessary funds is one for the Saudi Arabian Government to solve in the first instance. I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) (Signed) C. V/. BAXTER,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT /r November 7, 1938. Section 1. Copy No. Sir R. Bullard to Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs.—(Enclosure in Jedda Despatch No. 196 of October 12; Received in Foreign Office, November 7.) (Confidential.) Your Royal Highness, J edda, October 12, 1938. I HAVE the honour to inform Your Royal Highness, with reference to the note which was addressed to this Legation by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the 12th January last, that the question of the repair of the damaged portions of the Hejaz Railway has been most carefully considered by my Government, who have been in communication with the French Government on the subject. While I was in London I had the opportunity to take part in various discussions of this problem, and I am now authorised to inform you that His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom agree to the proposal of the Saudi Arabian Government that representatives of the four countries concerned should meet in conference at Jedda with the object of reaching an agreement as to the repair of the Hejaz Railway, on the understanding that His Majesty’s Government, like the Saudi Arabian Government, maintain their former views as to the ownership of the line. I have pleasure in adding, in strict confidence, that His Majesty’s Government intend to authorise their representatives to the conference to announce that they are prepared to repair at their own expense the Mudawwara- Maan section of the railway and to contribute £30,000 sterling towards the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section, provided that the Saudi Arabian Government can raise from other sources the remainder of the estimated cost of restoring the section lying within their territory. I am to state that, according to the estimates which have been made, the repair of the Mudawwara-Maan section will involve His Majesty’s Government in expenditure which may extend to £100,000. In making this offer His Majesty’s Government feel bound to record that they feel considerable doubt whether the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section of the railway can be regarded as sound from the economic and commercial points of view, and they feel obliged to make the reservation that, while they are prepared to offer the above-mentioned sums towards the reconstruction of those sections of the railway which are not at present in working order, they would be unable to make any further contributions even if the working of the Saudi Arabian section of the railway should result in a financial loss for the Saudi Government, The doubt which His Majesty’s Government feel as to whether the railway when rebuilt would be self-supporting, results from their belief that the cost of reconstructing the Saudi Arabian section would be greater than the Saudi Arabian Government have suggested and might be as much as £300,000, and from their hesitation to believe that the number of pilgrims and other passengers who would use the line, and the freight likely to be carried, would even cover the cost of current working of the line, let alone the amortisation of the capital sunk in the reconstruction. If, however, notwithstanding these difficulties, the Saudi Arabian Government still consider it necessary or desirable to proceed with the reconstruction of the portion of the line which lies within their territory, His Majesty’s Government will, subject to the conditions laid down above, assist to the extent of the above-mentioned sums in the initial work of reconstruction.

Your Excellency Mecca, ()ctobei 17, 1938. WITH reference to your Excellency's confidential note of the 12th October, 1938, concerning the question of repairing the Hejaz Railway, I inform you that the Government of His Majesty the King present their thanks to the British Government for their above-mentioned note regarding the repairing of the Hejaz Railway and their consent to take part in a conference to be held at Jedda to discuss the repair of that line. They also thank them for the statement that they intend to declare at the conference their readiness to repair the line from Maan to Mudawwara and to contribute £30,000 towards the repair of the line within the Saudi Arab Kingdom. . . , ^ , The Saudi Arab Government fully appreciate the observations oi the British Government as to the economic difficulties which beset the project, and thank t le friendly- Government for their useful advice. My Government think it bettei to study such difficulties at the conference. But in order that the facts of the matter may be clear, my' Government think it better that there should be a tec finical committee to estimate the exact cost of the repairs. The Syrian Government have suggested that English and French engineers should be selected to make an esfimate, and my Government would like to know the views of the British Govern ment in this respect: are they of the opinion that such a technical commission should be selected and that it should be sent to make its report before or after the conference ? My Government think it desirable that the conference should be held in Jedda on 20th Dhu’l Qa’da 1357 (11th January, 1939). The reply of the French Government has not yet been received, but we wish to know the views of the British Government as to the selection of a technical commission before sending the invitation for the conference to meet at the above-mentioned date.

But ^wing to demands made upon staff by damage caused during present disturbances, it is not possible to say nav that Palestine Railway Administration could send expert to assist you at conference (it is in fact probable that they could not) 0 Although you would as representative of His Majesty's G-overnment assist the conference to the best of your ability even without experts you might not be able to furnish it with all the information it might require upon a variety of technical points. (b) that estimate of cost of repairs should be made by British and French engineers. But for same reason Administration are unlikely to be able to arrange for this estimate to be made before January. 2. You may add, however, that according to an approximate estimate recently made by Administration total cost of repairs from Maan to Medina may be about 200,000 Palestinian pounds and suggest that if conference is held it should, using this figure as a working basis, attempt no more than a general exchange of views as to best method of procedure, after which detailed survey of line can if necessary be made. 5.

Note remarks that economic obstacles can be discussed at the conference and supports suggestion made by Syrian Grovemment that estimate of cost of repair should be made by British and French engineers. M R n begins: Saudi-Arabian Government ask whether His Majesty's Government approve this suggestion and whether they thinK estimate should be made before or after the conference. Suggestion seems sensible but estimate ought clearly to be made before the conference.

Sir, With reference to my despatch No.1516 of the 11th July and previous correspondence, I have to inform you that His Majesty’s Government have been giving careful consideration to the question of the Hejaz Railway and to the proposal, mentioned in Sir Reader Bullard’s despatc h No.26 o f the 12th February last, that His Majesty’s Government should offer to contribute financially towards the cost of restoration of the railway. 2. In present circumstances, and particularly in view of the situation in Palestine, the good-will of Ibn Saud is of especial importance to His Majesty's Governments who consider that no reasonable opportunity of retaining it must bo neglected. The fact that Anglo-Saudi relations have in recent months - chiefly as a result of the situation in Palestine - tended to be less cordial than hitherto renders it more than ever desirable that something should be done to check the process of estrangement, even though any measures that it might be possible to take, short of an actual revision of His Majesty’s Government’s Palestine Policy, must be rather in the nature of palliatives and are unlikely to be of any lasting benefit. The purpose of such measures would be mainly the purely political one of tiding over the dangerous period of the next year or so, during which the friendship of Ibn Baud will be of paramount importance to His Majesty's Government. 3. It happens, however, that almost the only question of importance on which His Majesty’s Government are in a position to give Ibn Saud substantial satisfaction is that of ... R. I. Campbell, Esq., C.B. , C.M. G. , e tc|, etc., etc., Paris.■ &lt;r -T—l .1 IM IIH ■ ■■ n of the Hejaz Railway. The conclusion reached in the light of the considerations mentioned above has therefore been that an effort should be made to meet as far as possible the requests put forward in the identic notes recently addressed to His Majesty r s Minister and the French Minister at Jedda by the Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs, copies of which 20^1 |3£ were enclosed with Sir Reader Bullard’s despatches Nos.26 and H'loo/' February and the 14th June respectively. Although therefore His Majesty’s Government do not admit any responsibility on the grounds suggested by the Saudi-Arabian Government, they propose to authorize His Majesty’s Charge d ! Affaires at Jedda to inform that Government, in reply to these communications, that for their part they agree to their proposal for holding a Conference at Jedda, to be attended by representatives of Great Britain, France, Syria and Saudi Arabia, with a view to reaching an agreement as to the repair of the damaged portion of the Hejaz Railway. His Majesty’s Government furthermore intend that at the Jedda Conference the British representative shall be authorized to inform the representative of the Saudi Arabian Government that they are prepared to contribute £30,000 towards the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section of the Hejaz Railway, provided that the Saudi Arabian Government are able to make satisfactory arrangements for obtaining from other sources the remainder of the estimated cost (i.e. some £300,000) of restoring this section. They recognize, however, that the contribution of His Majesty’s Government could not stoy at £30,000, since the restoration of the Maan-Mudawara (Transjordan) section of the Railway (without which the restoration of the Saudi Arabian section would be useless) would necessitate further expenditure tentatively estimated at £100,000. The amount of His Majesty’s Government • • •Government’s total contribution to the work of reconstruction would therefore be at least £130,000. 4. As you are aware, it is the wish of His Majesty’s Government to co-operate with the French Government over this question, with a view to the adoption as far as possible of a common attitude by both Governments, and it seems desirable that this co-operation should be maintained in the present instance. You should, therefore, provided you see no objection, acquaint the French Government with the terms of the reply which it is proposed to address to the Saudi Arabian Government and in confidence with the attitude v;hich His Majesty’s Government intend to adopt in the proposed discussions at jedda, and invite the French Government’s observations thereon. You should add that His Majesty’s Government sincerely hope that the French Government will see their way to accept the proposal for holding a conference at Jedda to be attended by representatives of the countries concerned. 5. As regards the question of a contribution towards the reconstruction of the railway, His Majesty’s Government .o not wish to take any action which might have the effect of prejudicing the position in this matter of the French Government, who will, no doubt appreciate the compelling reasons which have prompted His Majesty’s Government to decide to make such an offer. In any case it does not seem to His Majesty’s Government that their action need commit the French Government to taking parallel action, since their positions are different insofar as there is in Syria a Government v/hich has already, it appears, considered the question of a contribution and to which the responsibility of making or refusing a contribution can in any case be left. In the case of Transjordan on the other hand, it is His Majesty’s Government who must, having regard ...regard to the fact thot it is out of the question for the Transjordan Government to make a contribution from its own resources, take the responsibility of a decision, 6. In making the above communication, you should intimate that His Majesty’s Government would be grateful for a reply at a very early date. The question of the precise attitude to be adopted on rjoints of detail should the conference be held can if necessary be considered later. .

The Cabinet resumed their consideration of Conclusion 7(c) of the draft Minutes of the 329th Meeting of the C.I.D., on the subject of a proposed contribution of £30,000 towards the reconstruction of the Saudi-Arabia section of the Hedjaz Railway, on which a decision had been reserved by the Cabinet at their previous Meeting pending the S/S for F.A. ascertaining whether H.M.Minista at Jedda, who was now in London, realised the conditions attached to the proposed contribution. The S/S for F.A. said that the F.O. had communicated by telephone with Sir R. Bullard, who was at Oxford. He adhered to his opinion that the £30,000 proposal would be most helpful. Both the possible difficulty for Ibn Baud of raising the larger sum (roughly estimated at £300,000) and the risk of the Railway being useless were present to his mind, but he felt strongly that those points had best be brought out at the meeting at Jedda and explained to Ibn Saud. In the meantime Sir R. Bullard much hoped that the £30,000 proposal might be approved. The Cabinet agrees:- To approve the following recommendations made by the C.I.D. at their 329th Meeting on the 19thJuly: '(b) To authorise the F.O. to inform H.M.Minister at Jedda that H.M.G. agree to the holding of a Conference at Jedda, to be attended by representatives of Gt.Britain, France,..'Syria and Saudi Arabia, with a view to reaching an agreement as to therepair of the damaged portion of the Hedjaz Railway: (c) That at the Jedda Conference the British representative should be authorised to inform the representative of the Saudi Arabian Gvt. that H.M.G. were prepared to contribute £30,000 towards the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section of the Hedjaz Rly., provided that the Saudi ^rabian Govt, were able to make satisfactory arrangements for obtaining the remainder of the estimated cost (i.e. some £300,000) of this section from other sources:% r~\ (d) To note that the contribution of H.M.G. could not stop at £30,000, since the restoration of the Maan-Mudawara Section (without which the restoration of the Saudi Arabian Section would be useless) would necessitate further expenditure, tentatively estimated at £100,000. w^ ' % O' EXTRACT FRCffyl CABINET CONCLUSIONS 35 (38) DATED 27th JULY 1938.

The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Minister Mil -.E east &amp; NORTH EAST for Co-ordination of Defence (C.P.178(38)) circulating for AFRICA. the information of his colleagues at the request of the C.I.D. (Previous Reference: a Report by the Standing (Official) Sub-Committee for Cabinet 9 (38) Questions concerning the Middle East (C.I.D.Paper No.l447-B) Concl.4. ) on the measures which might be taken to influence those minor Powers and Arab States whose assistance or even benevolent neutrality might be of value to us in time of war: together with the relevant extract from the draft Minutes of the 329th meeting of the C.I.D. (minute 7). In the course of the discussion some doubts were expressed as to conclusion (c) (That at the Jedda Conference the British representative should be authorised to inform the representative of the Saudi Arabian Government that H.M.G. were prepared to contribute £30,000 towards the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section of the Hedjaz Railway provided that the Saudi Arabian Government were able to make satisfactory arrangements for obtaining the remainder of the estimated cost (i.e. , some £300,000) of this section from other sources). Questions were asked as to whether Ibn Saud realised that the contribution of £30,000 was only to be given on condition that he was able to find the remainder of the £300,000 required for the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabia Section of the Hedjaz Railway ? Was it likely that Ibn Saud would be able to raise so large a sum ? If not, was this proposal likely to be of much help ? If, as stated in para.11 of Enclosure No.l to C.P.178 (38), the railway was likely to prove an economic burden, would not Ibn Saud’s satisfaction be converted into resentment ? The Cabinet were informed that what had influencedthe C.I.D. was that the proposal was reported to have originated with Ibn Saud himself. The Committee had been influenced to a considerable extent by the immediate situation in Palestine. Ibn Saud might prove a very important factor in that situation so that the present proposals were perhaps more important from a short than from a long point of view. The idea of the C.I.D. has been that someone should go to Jedda to talk with Ibn Saud with authority, if he found it advisable, to make this offer of £30,000. The Cabinet were informed that Sir Reader Bullard, H.M.Minister at Jedda, on whose judgment the P.0.relied, had been immensely pleased to hear of this proposal and had said that it would be most helpful. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said, however, that if the matter could be placed on the Agenda again on the following day, he would like the opportunity to make sure that Sir Reader Bullard had realised that the promise of £30,000 was conditional on Ibn Saud being able to raise the larger sum. Referring to conclusion (f) of the C.I.D. on the South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia (That, with a view to the settlement of the S.E.frontiers of Saudi Arabia on lines acceptable to Ibn Saud, the Foreign Office and India Office should be authorised to take up the question of the cession by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi of a strip of territory in the Persian Gulf known as the Khor-el-Odeid: and that, should compensation in the form of a cash payment prove necessary, the expenditure of a sum tentatively estimated at £25,000 for this purpose should be provisionally authorised, subject to the usual arrangements for obtaining Treasury sanction), the Secretary of State for India warned3. the Cabinet that the Government of India saw strong objections to the proposal to take up the question of the cession by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi of a strip of territory in the Persian Gulf known as the Khor-el-Odeid, as they thought that this would have a serious effect on the Trucial Chiefs. He was prepared, however, to discuss the matter further with the Government of India. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, in reply to the Prime Minister, said that apart from conclusion (c) which had been reserved, the Cabinet need only take note of the remaining conclusions of the C.I.D. The Cabinet agreed: (a) To take note of the conclusions of the C.I.D. at the 329th meeting, subject to - (b) The reservation of conclusion (c) on the subject of a proposed contribution of £30,000 towards the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabia Section of the Hedjaz Railway until a meeting to be held on the following day: (c) That in the interval the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should ascertain whether H.M.Minister at Jedda, who is now in London, realised the conditions attached to the proposed contribution of £30,000.N °- and address —not to any person by'namk, but to—/ / “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, r.ondrli X W P.

Section 2. Copy No. Sir R. Bullard to Viscount Halifax.—[Received June 27.) (No. 120 .) My Lord. Jedda, June 14. 1938. I HAVE received from His Majesty’s consul at Damascus a copy of his despatch to the Foreign Office No. 27 of the 1 st June, in which he reports the voting by the Syrian Parliament of (probably non-existent) funds towards the cost of repairing the damaged portion of the Hejaz Railway. This decision has moved the Saudi Government to send me a note, of which I have the honour to- enclose a translation. My French colleague has received a note in similar terms. The notes ask whether the British and French Governments are prepared to contribute towards the cost of repair in consideration of the fact that the damage was effected by the Allies during the Great War in their military interests, and propose that a conference of British, French, Saudi and Syrian representatives should be held at Jedda with a view to an agreement as to the repair of the line “on the basis proposed. It is not clear whether “on the basis proposed refers simply to the suggested method of raising money, or includes the scheme for working the line as a single unit which was mentioned in the Saudi note sent to the Foreign Office under cover of my despatch No. 26 dated the 12 th February. 2. If, as I hope, the proposal contained in the letter which the Foreign Office sent to the Colonial Office on the 29th April is approved, it will provide a reply to the two main points in the latest Saudi note. If it is not. I hope that the Saudi proposal for a conference will not be rejected out of hand (though a more suitable place than Jedda could be selected for the meeting), and that His Majesty’s Government will feel able to enter into discussions on the subject. A suitable basis of discussion would perhaps be the cost of repair and of working the line and the amount of revenue to be expected. It would not be unreasonable for His Majesty's Government to say that, before replying to the Saudi note, they felt it necessary to have more exact data. But in some ways this might be taken as involving His Majesty’s Government more deeply than the proposal of the 29th April, under which they would get off with a fixed contribution and the responsibility for the rest would be thrown upon the Saudi Government and their Syrian friends. 3. I do not know whether the Saudi opinion as to the ownership of the line, viz., that it is a Waqf, has ever been dealt with fully in any document communicated to the Saudi Government. If it has not, this course might perhaps be taken at some convenient moment. It should not be difficult to show that,, although Moslems in many parts of the world contributed to the cost of the railway as a means of facilitating the performance of the pilgrimage, the line was a State railway and must have been built largely out of State funds raised, by the issue of a Hejaz Railway stamp, not only from Moslems, but from non- Moslem subjects of the Porte, and even from foreigners; and that consequently ownership has passed to the succession States in which the respective sections are situated. But this has perhaps been communicated to the Saudi Government in some paper which I have not been able to trace. I have, &amp;e. R. W. BULLARD. EASTERN (General). CONFIDENTIAL.

ON the 30th Dhul Hijja, 1356 (the 1 st March, 1938), Fuad Hamz^ mentioned to his Excellency Sir Reader Bullard—and Yusuf Yasin confirmed (what Fuad said) in his talks with his Excellency—the conversation that took place with his Excellency Shukri-al-Quwatli, the Syrian ex-Minister of Finance, during his stay in the Hejaz, about the Hejaz Railway, namely, to the effect that the Governments of Saudi Arabia and Syria should contribute a sum of money for the repair and operation of the line, and that a general contribution should be proposed in which Governments and individuals could participate. Our Government have been awaiting the Government of Syria’s approval of the suggestion of their Minister of Finance in order to lay the proposal before the English and French Governments. His Majesty the King has now received a telegram from the President of the Syrian Chamber of Deputies, saying that the Chamber has unanimously decided to open the credit for the repair of the line which the ex-Minister of Finance had suggested. The Saudi Arabian Government therefore bring this to the notice of the Government of Great Britain, and await their reply and that of the French Government, to whom a similar note has been addressed, on the following points :— 1 . It is hoped that the British and French Governments will have no objection to the repair of the line being effected with the contributions to be collected. 2 . Are the British Government, on their side, prepared to pay any monetary compensation (as a contribution) for the repair of this line m consideration of the fact that the destruction thereof was effected by the Allies during the Great War and in their military interest? 3. Do the British Government agree to the holding of a conference at Jedda, to be attended by representatives of Great Britain, France, Syria and Saudi Arabia, with a view to an agreement as to the repair of the line (being reached) on the basis proposed, on the understanding that our Government maintain their former views as to the ownership of the line?

A report from the High Commissioner for Transjordan is also awaited regarding the probable cost of the work of reconstruction and the assistance which might be rendered by the Palestine Railway Administration as managing agents if the scheme were carried into effect.

[E 3487/1237/25] Copy No. Consul MacKereth to Viscount Halifax.—(Received June 13.) (No. 27.) My Lord, Damascus, June 1, 1938. I HAVE the honour to enclose herewith translations of cuttings from the Damascus newspapers, Alef Ba and Echos, reporting the approval by the Syrian Parliament of the principle of sharing with King Abdel Aziz-bin-Saud the cost of the repairs of the Hejaz Railway, in accordance with a report sub mitted to Parliament by one of its members, Shukri Bey A1 Quwatli, of his conversations with the Saudi Arabian ruler in Mecca last February. 2. As you are already aware, the proposals of Ibn Saud and Shukri-al- Quwatli (then Minister of Finance of the Syrian Government) were that the Syrian Government and the Saudi Arabian Treasury should share equally the cost, estimated at £T. 120,000 gold, of putting the whole of the line in continuous working order. It was suggested that each country should provide half the amount out of its resources and issue loans for the remaining half. Since then there has been a curious disinclination on each side to exhibit implicit faith in the other. Now, although the Syrian Parliament has approved the principle of the transactions, it was careful to add a rider “ provided His Majesty King Ibn Saud do likewise.” During the debate one Deputy raised the question that everyone else has so far burked : “ What is the attitude of the French and British Govern ments to the arrangement V' I gather that a rather uncomfortable silence greeted the query, to which no answer was given. Some time ago, Shukri Bey A1 Quwafli, in the course of a conversation I had with him when he touched on his negotiations with Ibn Saud, asked me how His Majesty's Government would be likely to view the matter. I answered truthfully that I had not the slightest idea, but 1 added that it occurred to me that the complacent attitude of Syria towards the peculiar difficulties of the British authorities in Palestine did not appear to me likely to engender any particular warmth in the hearts of Englishmen for Syrian projects. 3 . Examined in its practical aspect it does not seem probable that the Syrian Government will find it possible to raise in the near future £T. 30,000 gold for railroad reconstruction of very doubtful economic value, which is to be carried out entirely in a foreign country, albeit an Arab State. Indeed, until some extra ordinary revenue in the shape of oil royalties, still hypothetical, is forthcoming, it is hard to see how Syrian economy can provide for the defence forces required of the country under the terms of the Franco-Syrian Treaty, much less enjoy the luxury of bearing half the cost of an enterprise which to-day is little more than a mirage of religio-political gratification. There is, however, another thought at the back of the minds of Shukri-al-Quwatli and his supporters. They believe that the completion of the line will force the British and French authorities to relinquish, without compensation, what are thought to be highly profitable sections of the line (Damascus-Deraa and Deraa-Maan) and the improvements effected thereto since the war for the benefit of an “Arab Wakf,” a first tangible sign of Pan-Arabian union. 4.

Sir, ^ s In reply to your letter 79086/38 of the 27th May, regarding the reconstruction of the Saudi-Arahian section of the Hejaz Railway, I am directed hy Viscount Halifax to request you to inform Mr. Secretary MacDonald that His Lordship does not propose to 'pursue the merits of this question further in interdepartmental correspondence pending consideration of the question hy the Committee of Imperial Defence, as a result of the report which tne Middle East (Official) Suh-Gommittee will shortly he submitting to the Committee on the question of possible ways of influencing in favour of this country the attitude of certain Minor Rowers and Arab States. 2. In the meanwhile, however, Lord Halifax will Le glad to learn - if Mr. MacDonald agrees - how the High Commissioner regards the suggestions made in paragraph 9 5 3 3 q of Foreign Office letter E 1237/1237/25 of the 1st April that the services of the Palestine Railways Administration should he offered to Ihn Ssud as managing agents for the reconstruction of the Saudi-Arahian section of the line, and temporarily at any rate for its running after it had been reconstructed. Mr. MacDonald may also he willing to invite the High Commissioner to furnish any observations which he may feel able to offer on Ihn Baud's own suggestion for an international company designed hy the sense of security which it would engender to/ The Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office.to facilitate the raising of the capital necessary for the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section. 3. It will he remembered that the Treasury have, in 34.C3 their letter S 32540 of the 14th May, made certain comments upon the suggestion that the operation of the railway should be entrusted to a body other than the Saudi Government, and it would be useful to know whether the High Commissioner shares the doubts expressed in that letter. 4. I am also to express the hope that the High Commissioner may be asked to furnish an approximate estimate of the cost of restoring (a) the Saudi Arabian section, which was put at £l90&gt; 000 in 1935 but which it has been suggested might now be as much as £300,000 and (b) the Maan-Mudawarra section, which it has been suggested might be as much as £ 100 , 000 . 5.

Sir, Your obedient Servant, (SignedCOPY THANS- J OIU)AN , S:;,CRaT . kLFiP. hcii; NO.^c/sg/as . HIGH GOMMISSlOIBIi POE TRANS-JO ID AN, Sir, I have the honour to refer to your Secret despatch n of the 14th April, 1938, and my Secret telegram No.7 of the 4th May, 1938, regarding a suggestion that His Majesty’s Government should contribute towards the reconstruction oi the Saudi Arabian section of the Hejaz Railway. 2. The arguments in favour of such a contribution are based upon political expediency and they are so fully set out in the first two enclosures to the despatch referred to above that it would be a work of supererogation for me to restate them. I desire, merely, to associate myself with them, whether or not the projected restoration of the railway can be regarded as justifiable on economic grounds, and even though there is some risk that it may never materialize. As regards this latter point I would express my agreement with paragraphs 3 and 4 of Mr. Downie*s letter No.79086/38 of the 11th April, 1938, which formed the third enclosure to the despatch quoted above. 3. That His Majesty's Government should retain the good will of Ibn Saud is obviously of the greatest importance to Palestine and Trans-Jordan and it is from this restricted angle that I approach the present proposal. I would add, speaking again from the same angle, that the policy followed hitherto by Ibn Saud has been helpful as contrasted with that of other neighbouring 'Arab” States. Though THE RIGHT HONOURABLE W.G.A. QHMSBY GORE, P.C., M.P. , HIS MAJESTY^' PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES.Though placed in a very difficult position, with his Syro-Arab political advisers on the one hand and the more religious-minded of his followers on the other, and with his own strong predilections and antipathies to contend with, he has done what he could to avoid undue embarrassment to His Majesty’s Government. So far as relates to Palestine, his influence has been upon the side of sobriety and moderation and opposed to the extreme counsels by which he is continually beset from his own and neighbouring States. 4. I suggest therefore that the advantage of extending to him concrete assistance at this juncture is not to be measured only in terms of the gratification which such assistance would give to him but that account needs also to be taken of the disappointment and exasperation which he may be expected to feel if no recognition is accorded to his friendly efforts. I note in this connection that His Majesty's Government, in contrast to the Italian Government, have been unable of late to afford him satisfaction in various matters, unrelated to Palestine, to which he attaches importance. 5. At the same time there are indications that, notwithstanding his general attitude of support to His Majesty's Government, Ibn £&gt;aud is by no means averse to action which is irritative - or stimulative - in its effect, and which can be disowned or discounted if necessary. I would instance certain signs and portents apparent in Trans-Jordan:- e.g. his disposal of certain detained Trans-Jordan opposition leaders, who recently escaped from Aq ab aAqaba into Saudi Arabia, by smuggling them into Syria, where they can work against the Amir Abdulla and this Government, and the secret collection, which is reported, of a large number of rifles and ammunition near the Trans-Jordan frontier for conveyance either to Syria or Trans-Jordan (reference paragraph 2 of Major Glubb ! s Report on the Deserts of Trans-Jordan for the month of April, 1938). For such clandestine activities we owe Ibn Saud * no gratitude, but I am convinced that it is well worth our while to do anything which might have the effect of stopping them and of reducing the chances of serious trouble breaking out in Trans-Jordan during the highly electric period to be covered by the labours of the Partition Commission and the deliberations subsequent to them. 6. I would only add an expression of my hope that, if a contribution is to be offered towards the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section of the Hejaz Railway, it should be offered at once if its political value is to be assured. I have, etc., (Sgd.) Harold MacMichael. HIGH COMMISSIOifSR FOR TRAITS-JORDAN.phone No. : WH 1 TKHALL 1234. Any reply to this letter should he addressed to THE SECRETARY. TREASURY, WHITEHALL.

Sir, I have laid before the Lorda Gomnisaioners of Hla Majesty's Treaaory Mr. Maggallay's letter of the 1st April (S 1237/1837/26), together with the suoaequent correapondenoe between your iJepartment and the Goloni&amp;l Office, on the subject of the restoration of the Heja* Railway, and i am to request you to convey to Viscount Halifax the following observations. 2. My oords share the views expressed in the golonial The Office letter of the 11th April as to the probable cost of restoration. If these views were found to be correct, the contributions foreshadowed from the Saudi-Ar&amp;oian and Syrian Governments would be altogether insufficient to lull11 the conditions which it is proposed to attach to an of a er from His Majesty's Government. in these circumstances My Lords fear that the gratitude caused by any offer such as is proposed would be evanescent, and would give place to a feeling of dissatisfaction when it became clear that the conditions Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.condition* to *hich the orfer w*s sudject could not be fulfilied. If this were to occur, Hie Majeaty’e Government would oe i'eced with the altemHtives* of having to find the greater part of the coat of reconstruction, or leaving the matter in a more unsatisfactory position than it now is. 6. Even if the railway were to be reconatructeu # it wou*d, in Their itfroehipe’ view, be a political asset only if it were successfully operated without loss to the o&amp;udi /raoian Government. Hie Ha^esty’a Minister at oedda, in hie despatch of the let March, 1937 and its enclosure, referred to the difficulties likely to arise from the primitive character of that Government and its ignorance of the needs of an undertaking such as a railway. My Lords are not satisfied that these difficulties could be removed by entrusting the operation of the railway to a body other than the Government itself. The baud!- Araoisn Government would hardly be likely to dissociate itself from questions of policy arising from the railway.6 » in regard to the employment of Seudi-Arablan peraonnei end disagreements on such points between the Management and the saudi^Arabian Government might well become a source o£ embarrastiment to His Majesty's Government, 4, in any case, the ultimate responsibility oi the Gaudi-Arabian Government for any deficit on the wording of the Saudi-Arabian section of the railway wouxd give them reasonable ground to interest themselves in its admini stration, There seems to be little prospect that the railway would pay its way even if no interest were charged, on the capital. If the wording of the railway resulted in a deficit, it appears to Their Lordships to be somewhat improbable either that funds for the maintenance and renewals necessary for successful operation would oe forth coming, or that the saudi-Arabian Government would continue to entertain feelings of gratitude for a railway that caused a constant drain on their limited P£source 5. In these circumstances My I*orde consider that any reply sent to the daudi-Arabian Note, of which a copy was enclosed with Sir Reader Bullard's despatch of the 18th February last, should refrain from offering any contribution towards the reconstruction of the railway, at any rate in regard to that section of the line which lies in Saudi- Arabia #6.

FOREIGN OFFICE S.W.l 29th April, 1938 Sir, I am directed by Viscount Halifax to request you to submit to Mr. Secretary Ormsby Gore the following observations upon your letter 79086/38 of the llth April regarding the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section -)f the Hejaz Railway. 2. Lord Halifax agrees that there need be no question of any contribution being offered by the Government of Palestine or by the Government of Transjordan towards the capital or current cost involved in this enterprise except, that is, in so far as a contribution by I/Ls Majesty’s Government might be paid through grants-in-aid to either of those Governments. 3. His Lordship realises that the restoration of the Saudi Arabian section of the railv/ay can hardly be regarded as an economic proposition and the Foreign Office letter of the 1st April was, indeed, meant to show that in advocating an offer of assistance towards its reconstruction, he was cono^rned only v/ith the political, may be nearer £300,0^0 than £190,000 shows that it may be necessary in any reply eventually given to Ibn Saud to draw as opposed to the economic, aspects. 4. The fact, however, that the cost of reconstruction his The Under-Secretary of State Colonial office.his attention mere specifically than was previously suggested to the difficulties which lie in the path of his enterprise. 5o With regard to the form of communication which should be made to Ibn Saud, Lord Halifax still foela that it is desirable to offer a definite sum at the outset. It is, in hie opinion, the gesture which is important, even though it may not lead to great results. The immediate future is the period during which the goodwill of Ibn Saud is likely to be of the most value to this country, while the working out of the details of the reconstruction of the railway may take a considerably longer period. It is true that if the project cannot be carried out - or can only be carried out at a working loss - notwithstanding tho assistance which His Majesty’s Government have been able to offer, this may lead to considerable disappointment ^n the part of Ibn Saud. But His Majesty’s Government can protect themselves against the results of this disappointment by telling Ibn Saud frankly from the beginning the doubts and hesitations which they feel regarding his project. 6. In these circumstances Lord Halifax suggests that the communication to Ibn Saul should run as follows:- 'Hiq Majesty’s Government are pleased to be able 'to inform the Saudi Arabian Government that they are ’’willing to enter into discussions, as proposed by the 'Saudi Arabian Government, about the reconstruction 'and reaper:'■ng of tne Saudi Arabian section of the 'Hejaz/M Hejaz Railway and to be able to announce that the ’’Government of Transjordan will provide £x ’’towards this work, as a contribution on behalf of ’’Transjordan, as soon as they are satisfied that the M remaind«r of the money required will be forthcoming ’’from other sources for the construction, to a ’’satisfactory standard, of the Mudawwara-Medina section ’’and that adequate arrangements have been made for the ’’carrying out of the work. 'The Government of Transjordan will also be ’’willing on the same conditions as are indicated ’’in the previous paragraph to carry out the 'reconstruction of the Maan-Mudawwara section in ’’Transjordan at their own expense. ’’But in making this offer His Majesty’s Government ’’feel bound to record that they feel considerable 'doubt whether the reconstruction of the Saudi 'Arabian section can ever be regarded as an economic 'commercial proposition and they feel obliged to make 'the reservation that apart from the sums which they ’’feel able to offer towards the reconstruction of ’’those sections of the Railway which are not at 'present in working order, they would be unable to 'make any contribution should the working of the 'Saudi Arabian section of the Railway result in a 'financial loss for the Saudi Arabian Government in 'future years. 'The reasons why His Majesty’s Government are 'nnable to regard the reconstruction of the Railway as/'as an economic proposition are as follows: (here 'would follow reasons for thinking that the cost of 'reconstruction will be as high as £300,000, and 'that the numbers of pilgrims and the amount of 'freight likely to be carried would not cover the 'cost of current working, let alone the cost of 'amortising the capital sunk in the reconstruction). 'If, notwithstanding these difficulties, the 'Saudi Arabian Government still feel it necessary or 'desirable to proceed with the reconstruction of the 'Saudi Arabian section the Government of Transjordan 'will, subject to the conditions indicated above, 'assist to the extent of the sums specified above in 'the initial work of reconstruction.' 7, Lord Halifax would still be glad if it were possible to join to this communication the suggestions contained in paragraphs 9 and 10 of the letter of the 1st April. 8. Copies of this letter are being circulated to all Departments represented on the Middle East (official) Sub-Committee. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Sifncd) C. \'J. CAXTER.IP. J-i - 79086/38 ij rr ’ &gt; ?? / o i / ! r&gt; i IMP0H7AKT j Downing street, April, 1938. Sir, I ftm directed by Mr. Secretary Ormeby Gore to acimowledge t e receipt of your letter K# 123^/1^87/85, of the 1st of April, and tc request you to inform Viscount Halifax that the High Comaissioner for Palestine and Trans-Jordnn has been esKed to furnish his observations on the proposal that Hia Majesty’s Government should ma^e a contribution towards the restoration of the iaudi Arabian section of the Hejaz Railway. In the meantime, r.Ormeby Goi*e desires to offer the following preliminary observations on the subject:- £• 3o long as it is understood that there can be no question of any contribution either by the Government of Palestine or by the Government of Trans-Jordan t&lt;wards the capital or recurrent cost involved in this enterprise, Mr.Ormsby Gore feels that the merits of the proposal are hardly his concern and that it is for the becretary of state for Foreign Affairs in consultation with the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury, to decide the nature and the amount of the financial assistance to be granted to Ibn 8aud in the light of the political advantages which it is hoped to obtain. He would, however, venture tc express hia doubts as to whether the abject in view is li ;ely to be achieved by action on the lines suggested in your letter* 3 # The restoration of the orudi Arabian section of the Hejaz Railway c*m hardly be regarded as on economic proposition, THS Jjm&amp; idSC KTAPY OF 3TATB» FGI ,I0!T FPICK.proposition, whether or not the reconstructed section ie controlled by the baud! Arabian Ooveximent. In the first place, it ia not possible to rely upon the estimate of capital cost (£190,000) mentioned in paragraph 3 of your letter. This estimate was prepared in 1935 in the light of a hasty and superficial survey carried out by a dnudi Arabian engineer of uniaiown qualifications and in any case requires revision in the light of the present day prices of material. It is suggested that in the circumstances, an estimate of £300,000 would not be unduly cautious. In the second place, the estimate of pilgrim traffic, which was entertained at the Haifa Conference of 1935, viz. 7,000 pilgrims a year, would in any case fail to supply sufficient revenue to cover the coat of renewals, and has since been questioned both by the High Commissioner for Palestine (in the despatch of which a copy was enclosed in a semi-official letter to Ur.Rendel of the 7th December, 1936) and by dir Reader Bullard in his telegram No,5 of the 5th March, 1938, (Foreign Office letter E.lid37/1237/25 of the 16th March). 4. Prima facie, therefore, the re-opening of the Saudi Arabian section is not an economic proposition and is unlikely to materialise unless His Majesty's Government are prepared to provide by subsidy or guarantee, not only a considerable proportion of the capital expenditure but for the meeting of a recurrent deficit, 5, In Mr• Ormsby Gox'e's opinion, it would be advisable to give no undertaking as to the amount of assistance forthcoming from His Majesty’s Government until reliable estimateseatimatea have 'been prepai^ed. both of capital and. recurrent costs and of prospective revenue; but if it is ft;lt necessary without further delay to xasite a gesture to Ibn aaud, the secretary of iitate can only suggest that Ibn iiaud should be informed that, on being satisfied that funds will be forthcoming from other sources for the construction, to a technically satisfactory standard, of the Mud aww ar a -Med ina section in Saudi Arable and that there ifj a reasonable prospect of the new section being run on a self-supporting basis. His Majesty's Government will provide the necessary funds for the reconstruction of the section Maan-Mudawwora in Trrns-Jo^d. n» 6« Mi^Giinsby Goi‘e feels, ho ever, tixat the antecedent conditions suggested above are so unlikely to be iulfilled that the action of His Majesty's Government would remain limited to a gesture and would fail to secure the political objects in view* A iurther letter will be addressed to you when the views of the High Goi&amp;ail sal oner have been obtained* 7* Copies of this letter have been sent to the Treasury and to the other Departments represented on the Middle Kast (Official) Gub-Committee.

In order to facilitate the examination of the problem which this suggestion presents, a brief summary of the Hejaz Railway question, which does not claim to be in any way exhaustive, is enclosed herein, 2. The Hejaz Railway question has two distinct aspects, the one financial, the other political, 3. So far as the financial aspect is concerned. Lord Halifax is aware that the merits of the proposal that the Syrian, Palestinian and Transjordanian Railway/ The Secretary to the Treasury*Railway Administrations should finance the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section of the railway are not, taken by themselves, sufficiently great to justify any action on the part of His Majesty’s Government. If this aspect alone were involved, His Majesty’s Government might well inform the Saudi Arabian Government that, if they desired to restore their section of the railway, they should themselves raise the required sum (which has been estimated at about £190,000), by subscriptions from devout Moslems or by other means, and that if they were to do so His Majesty’s Government would co-operate as regards the operation of inter-connected services, accept the Moslem Advisory Council foreseen by the Anglo-French (Bompard) Declaration of 1923, and use or pay over for the benefit of the railway as a whole, or of the pilgrims who use it, any profits which might as a result of the re-opening of the Saudi-Arabian section accrue to the Palestine and Transjordan sections. 4. But, while the financial considerations which have been adduced by the Saudi Arabian Government in favour of a contribution by His Majesty’s Government towards the cost of restoration of the Saudi Arabian section may not seem to His Majesty’s Government sufficiently cogent to warrant a contribution, they might nevertheless furnish a useful basis for action if it were decided to make a contribution on political grounds:- d)/(l) as providing some public justification for what would he mainly a matter of political expediency. Any contrihution which might he made would pi^esumahly he in the form of an increased grant-in-aid to the Transjordan Government given for the ostensible purpose of improving the future prospects of the Transjordan section of the railway. It would at any rate he a contrihution for a specific economic purpose. (2) as affording at least a possibility that the proposed contribution might he re-paid and thereby conferring upon it some of the qualities of an investment, of however speculative a character. 5. So far as His Majesty’s Government are concerned, however, the question of the Hejaz Railway derives its importance from its political implications. Tfteir Lordship* will he aware of the increasing necessity, owing to recent developments in the Near and Middle East, of devising some means of assisting Ihn Saud. This aspect of the question needs no stressing, hut so far His Majesty’s Government have not been able to assist Ihn Saud except in quite minor ways over the various questions outstanding between the two Governments. The need for doing so has, however, been recognised in principle in one of the Cabinet Conclusions of the 22nd December 1937 which laid it down, in connexion with the despatch of the 23rd December to the High Commissioner for Palestine, that inter alia the possibility of financial assistance for Ibn Saud should be explored. Lord Halifax is of the/the opinion that the reconstruction of the Hejaz railway presents an exceptional opportunity of giving such assistance in a matter on which Ihn Saud has set his heart and which he thinks, rightly or wrongly, will “benefit his country. 6. • If the provision of financial assistance in the reconstruction of the railway is, as Lord Halifax hopes it will he, approved in principle, it will he of special importance that the offer should he communicated to the Saudi Arabian Government at the earliest possible opportunity. Thereafter it will he of less consequence how soon the actual work of reconstruction is put in hand and delays in execution are in any case to he anticipated, especially if the report that the Syrian Minister of Finance has agreed to contribute £30,000 should prove to he illusory. 7. Similarly, it will he unnecessary to reach any definite decision, before the offer is made, as to how or by whom the Saudi Arabian section is to he rebuilt or the whole railway eventually managed, and as to whether it is to he administered as a whole or in sections. His Majesty’s Government have always held certain views, which have been frequently expressed in the past, about the status and control of the railway, and the Saudi Arabian proposals for the establishment of an international company to operate the railway are presumably unlikely to prove acceptable to any of the other Railway Administrations in their present form. Subject to the observations in the following paragraphs, these and similar questions can best be reserved for later consideration/consideration. 8. At the sane tine, if an offer of a contribution towards the work of reconstruction is to he made, it should he accompanied hy some stipulation to the effect that the contribution shall he properly used and applied to the purposes for which it is intended* The vievfs of His Majesty’s Government might he expressed in some such terms as the following:- ”His Majesty’s Government are pleased to he ’’able to inform the Saudi Arabian Government that 'they are willing to enter into discussions, as 'proposed hy the Saudi Arabian Government, about the 'reconstruction and re-opening of the Saudi Arabian 'section of the Hejaz Railway and to be able to 'announce that the Government of Transjordan will 'provide £ towards this work, as a 'contribution on behalf of Transjordan, as soon as 'they are satisfied that the remainder of the money 'required will be forthcoming from other sources and 'that adequate arrangements have been made for the 'carrying out of the work'. 9* To this might appropriately be added a constructive suggestion to the effect that, while His Majesty’s Government will be prepared to consider any alternative suggestions which may be put forward by the Saudi Arabian Government, His Majesty’s Government think the Saudi iirabian Government might do well to appoint the Palestine Railway Administration to be their managing agents for the carrying out, through a contractor or contractors to be mutually agreed upon, of the work of reconstruction/reconstruction and thereafter for the operation of the Saudi i-irahian section, for the account of the Saudi iirahian Government, until such tine as other arrangements can he made. (The contractors might have to he Moslems). 10. The Saudi Arabian Government might also he informed, hy way of comment upon the foregoing suggestion, that in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government the first object should he to provide for and carry out the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section and bring it into operation in accordance with the technical arrangements agreed upon hy the Conference held at Haf.fa in 1935; and that the question of an international company or other system of joint management should he left for further discussion once this object has been achieved^ 11. As His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government have in the past attached different interpretations to the Eompard Declaration of 1923, it would probably be inadvisable to make any mention of this Declaration in the first instance; but, if the point were subsequently raised by the Saudi Arabian Government themselves, they should, in Lord Halifax’s opinion, be informed without hesitation that His Majesty’s Government have no objection to the formation of the Moslem Advisory Council foreseen in the Declaration, and that they will in any case devote any future profits of the Palestine and Transjordan sections to the benefit of the railway as a whole or to the welfare of the pilgrims who use it.12. iis regards the amount of the contrihution which His Majesty’s Government might he prepared to make, Lord Halifax considers that an initial offer of not less than £30,000 would he appropriate, this sum, which is slightly less than one-sixth of the total estimated cost of reconstruction, being the equivalent of the sum which Ihn Saud and the Syrian Minister of Finance are each reported to have offered* But in making this suggestion His Lordship feels obliged to do so with the reservation that this sum may have to he increased appreciably at a later stage, since the political advantages of assisting Ihn Saud in this particular manner can, in his opinion, he assessed at a much larger sum than £30,000. Meanwhile, the suggested contribution, with those from Ihn Saud himself and from the Syrian Government, would leave about £100,000 out of the total amount required to he found from other sources, such as, for instance, subscriptions or investments by devout Moslems in Arabia, Egypt or elsewhere. The question whether the additional sum can be raised in this or other ways is one for the Saudi Arabian Government to consider in the first instance. 13. It would probably be necessary before any communication was made to the Saudi Arabian Government to inform the Frehoh Government of what His Majesty’s Government proposed to do, but, provided the French Government are not asked to subscribe money themselves or to press the Syrian Government to do so, it is unlikely that they will raise objections. 14. Lord Halifax would be glad to receive Their Lordships’ observations on the above proposals, to which he attaches great/great importance, at an early date. 15. ^ similar letter is being addressed to the Colonial Office and copies are being sent to the other Departments represented on the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee) I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,Copy. (E 1237/1237/25) THE HEJAZ RAIl/A Y. The Hejaz Railway, which runs from Syria to Medina, was ■built before the Great War for the purpose of carrying pilgrims from Turkey and Syria to Mecca. 2. As a result of the Great War, during which large parts of it were damaged by Colonel T.Ec Lawrence and others, it became split into sections lying in Syria, Palestine, Transjordan and the Hejaz (now Saudi Arabia) respectively. 3. At the Lausanne Conference the British and French Governments declared that they desired to recognise the religious character of the line and were prepared to accept an advisory council of Moslem representatives, to sit at Medina, to make recommenuations for the upkeep of the line and the improvement of traffic conditions for pilgrims. 4. The British and French Governments also declared that so far as the Syrian, Palestinian and m ransjordan sections were concerned, any profits realised by those sections would be devoted to the upkeep and improvement of the whole line and that any sums left over would be devoted to the assistance of pilgrims. 5. The reason for this declaration (known as the Bompard declaration) was that the line is regarded by Moslems generally as a Wakf or religious foundation. ,|1 he other discussions about the division of the Railway, which were long and complicated, are not relevant in the present connexion. 6. During the years following the Lausanne Conference, the Syrian, Palestinian and Transjordan sections were restored, but none of them has ever made a profit. 7. The Hejaz section, however, which was the most damaged of all, has never been restored, mainly because the Hejaz and SaudiSaudi Arabian Governments have never had any money. 8. This is not for lack of conferences. The authorities the inter-working of the different sections. ^hese have, however, come to nothing: (a) partly because the Saudi Arabian Government refused for a long time to discuss technical details unless the principle that the line was an indivisible whole to be owned and controlled by the Koslem Council to be set up under the Bompard declaration was first admitted; the British and French Governments have never accepted this view of the legal position or the functions of the Council; (b) partly because the Saudi Arabian Government have claimed that the Syrian, Palestinian and Transjordan sections should, under the Bompard declaration, assume the financial task of restoring the Hejaz section; the British and French Governments have always maintained that the non-Hejaz sections are not obliged to contribute to the Hejaz section unless and until they make profits. 9. The last conference, in 1935, did, however, agree upon a number of technical questions connected with inter working and reached an estimate of £190,000 for the restoration of the Hejaz section. 1©. On the question of profits the Saudi Arabian Government argue that if the non-Hejaz sections make no profit, this is because the railway at present leads nowhere, but that if it led to Medina the profits made over the whole line out of pilgrim traffic and possibly freight (e.g. corn going from Transjordan to the Hejaz) would soon pay back the money used for the restoration of the Hejaz section. They also allege • that concerned have met on several occasions to discuss schemes forthat the Syrian section has never paid because it has been mis-managed in the interest of other Syrian railways. 11. The British and French Governments take the view, which has not, however, been specifically communicated to the Saudi Arabian Government, that it is highly problematical whether a profit would be made even by the whole of the line. In fairness to the Saudi Arabian Government, however, it must be admitted that it is unlikely that the railway can ever pay while it stops at the Transjordan frontier, but that it might pay if it extended to Medina. 12. The British and French Governments moreover take the view that as the Syrian, Palestine and Transjordan railway administrations have no money of their own, funds for the restoration of the Hejaz section could only be furnished from the treasuries of the Syrian, Palestinian and Transjordan Governments, which they, as mandatories- cannot recommend, or from the public, who would only be likely to subscribe on the guarantee of those Governments, and that they cannot, again as mandatories, properly pledge the credit of those Governments, especially at a time of possible impending changes in their status, in regard to a venture of which the financial success is not assured. 13. Both Governments would, however, welcome the restoration of the Hejaz section and are willing to help in any way except by the actual provision of funds. 14. The Saudi Arabian Government on their side have from time to time made vague assertions that the money needed, or a great deal of it, could be obtained from financiers in Egypt and elsewhere. 15. That is the position until political considerations (i.e. the desirability of supplying funds for the restoration of the Hejaz section in order to help and please Ibn Baud) enter into the juestion. 16. His16 . His Majesty's Minister at Jedda was consulted about this aspect of the question a year ago. He then advised against assistance over the railway Tor various reasons, but especially because in his opinion it would not really benefit Ibn f3aud in the long run, but would, owing to the incompetence of the Saudi Arabian (rovernment be a drain upon his resources. 17. Sir R, Bullard has now, however, revised this opinion, partly it seems because the Saudi Arabian Government have put forward a proposal for an international company to manage the whole railway (which would mean that they themselves would have nothing to do ’with the management of their own section or its finances) and partly because of the increasing need to do something for Ibn Saud on account of the Palestine question. 18. The point has therefore been reached when His Majesty’s Government must decide whether they should, on purely political grounds, make a contribution to the restoration of the Hejaz Railway. The need for helping Ibn 3au in some way has already been recognised in principle, the Cabinet having decided on December 22nd 1937, in connexion with the white paper about the Palestine Technical Commission, i n ter alia the possibility of financial assistance for Ibn Saud should be explored. 19. It may be added that His Majesty’s Government are more or less committed to informing the French Government before they make any move vis-h-vis the Saudi Arabian Government in connexion with the railway. But there is no need to supoose that the French Government will mind His Majesty’s Government giving financial assistance towards the restoration of the Hejaz section, so long as they are not asked to ao anything, or to press the Syrian Government to do anything, themselves. Foreign Office, 14th March, 1938.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAJ1HJ 1 STY’S GOVERNMENT ^ EASTERN (Arabia). -March 7. 1938. I Q“7 CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [E 1249/I237/25J Copy No. Sn R. Bullard to Mr. Eden.—{Received March 7.) (No. 26.) Sir, Jedda, February 12, 1938. T HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a French translation of an identic in Jedda. The translation has been accepted as correct by my French colleague and myself. It seemed to me that it might be convenient for His Majesty’s Government to have an agreed French translation for use in case of discussions with the French Government on the subject, and I have therefore thought it unnecessary to send an English translation. 2. I gather from M. Maigret that he regards the matter as of no practical importance, and, indeed, in view of the attitude of the French and Syrian Governments and the declared lack of funds as revealed in various despatches from the Foreign Office, the last of which was No. 457, and dated the 30th November, his opinion is not surprising. Nor is the Saudi letter very convincing since it professes to see no difficulty in the question of raising the money required for the reconstruction of the line, but only in the way expenditure should be effected. The suggestion that the Hejaz Railway should be administered by an international company operating over all the parts as the International Sleeping Car Company runs its coaches through many different countries over railways belonging to different authorities is apparently designed to get round the question of ownership—at least, so I gather from Fuad Bey, who communicated a copy of the note to me confidentially in advance. The scheme also involves the conclusion, again confirmed by Fuad Bey, that the Saudi Government would have nothing to I do either with the management of the line or with its finances. ‘ii'ISp'f. 3. In my despatch No. 20. dated the 10th February, 1937,( 1 ) I reported against the suggestion that His Majesty’s Government might perhaps be justified on political grounds in meeting the cost of restoring the damaged portions of the Hejaz Railway. The situation has, however, changed in two respects : ( 1 ) The Saudi Government do not now propose to have anything to do with the management of the line or with its finances; and ( 2 ) the political arguments call for reconsideration. 4. If it were possible for the railway to be managed in such a way that the Saudi Government had nothing to do with it, most of the arguments under the valid. An argument that still stands is that which refers to the dissatisfaction which Ibn Saud would feel if the railway, after beginning to run, had to cease again for lack of funds, but the line would be less likely to cease running if the Saudi authorities had nothing to do with the management. 5. It is, however, on political grounds that I have been reconsidering this question. A year has elapsed since my despatch was written, and during that time we have been unable to give Ibn Saud any satisfaction in regard to Palestine, and he has found himself, owing to his identification of his interests with those of His Majesty’s Government, in a position of increasing difficulty. Moreover, on another question on which he feels very strongly. His Majesty’s Government have been obliged to be discouraging, viz., the territorial ownership of Jabal Nakhsh, Safaq and Khor-el-Odeid, on his eastern frontier. Nor does the help we have been able to give or to promise Ibn Saud in the matter of arms and aviation compare favourably with the assistance given or offered by the Italians, who have not ceased to make strenuous efforts to draw Ibn Saud over to their side. I suggest that His Majesty’s Government should now consider whether it would not be worth while their contributing the whole or part of the cost of note which the Saudi Government have sent to the British and French Legations fourth of the five heads under which I set forth my objections would cease to be (1) March 1, 1937, Section 1.

Syrian Minister of Finance discussed Hejaz Railway with Saudi-Arabian Government while here on pilgrimage and according to Ministry of Foreign Affairs he promised, with confidence in result, to urge those concerned to authorise contribution of £50,000 sterling from Syrian revenues towards reconstruction of damaged portion while Ibn Saud also promised 30,000. 2. Fuad says that if Syrian portion of line has not paid hitherto it is because it has been bled to increase profits on other railways in Syria and that this practice is to cease. 3. See enclosure to your despatch ho. 0 oi January 12th, 1937. It cannot he said that of pilgrims who came this year even 7,000 would have travelled by railway had 'die line been working. Number is perhaps four or five tnousand. But Saudi-Arabian Government argue that many more would come if they could travel by rail. This seems reasonaole. 5. If we could agree to reopen discussion it would make a good impression. Contribution by Ton Saud and perhaps Syria make it more difficult for us to refuse to participate and at the same time reduces financial call on us. 5.

My dear Minister, Your letter of' the 28 th October (the receipt of which I acknowledged on the 4th November) about the proposed declaration by the Saudi Arabian and Syrian Governments on the subject of the reconstruction of the Hejaz Railway has been engaging our attention. I am now able to let you know that His Majesty’s Government do not wish to object to a declaration if the Saudi Arabian Government think that this will serve a useful purpose. His Majesty’s Government will always be prepared to receive and examine in a spirit of friendship and cooperation any proposals about this question which the Saudi Arabian Government may put forward, and I do not wish to pre-judge what their response to such proposals might be. It is at the same time only fair to add that the practical difficulties, financial and otherwise, in the way of the re-opening of the railway are still likely to prove formidable* Yours sincerely, (Sgd.)

I enclose copies of these two documents for convenience of reference. Saint-Quentin telephoned this morning to eay that he found it difficult to believe that the Syrian Government were contemplating making any declaration of the kind alleged by the Saudi-Arabian Minister in London and that he had therefore telegraphed to Beyrout to ask what their real intentions were. He saw no objection to the course we proposed, but would prefer to defer replying in that sense until he had heard from Beyrout. In the circumstances, I am to telephone to him on 19th November for his substantive reply. Incidentally, Saint-dentin observed that the views of the French Government on the whole matter of the Hejaz Railway remained as set forth in the inictry^ note of 31st «,'uly (Paris despatch No. 954 of 3rd August).

Sheikh Hafiz agreed, and implied that the Saudi-Syrian agreement was really in the nature of a preliminary understanding* He did not seem to think that the Transjordan authorities would have any reason to object to it. 3* The Minister then asked me whether there would be any objection to the agreement or understanding being published in the Syrian press* I replied that I thought that this would be a mistake, since it might be that the Transjordan authorities, whose participation in it would presumably be necessary, might wish to suggest certain alterations. It would be more difficult to arrange this after publication than before* In reply to a further question/question from the Minister, I said that I thought it would also he greatly preferable that the agreement should not be published until the French Government had consented* 4* The Minister said that he would inform the King of what I had said as regards publication, and promised that the text of substance of the agreement would be communicated to us as soon as possible.

IN accordance with the instructions conveyed in your despatch N q^l4 da ted the 12th January, I have the honour to submit as an enclosure to this despatch my observations on the question of the reconstruction of the southern portion of the Hejaz Kailway. I may say that until your above-mentioned despatch was received, in so far as I had considered the question, I felt vaguely that it would be a good thing if the line could be rebuilt, and that His Majesty’s Government might even be justified in contributing something towards the cost. Now that I have examined the problem more closely, I have come to the contrary conclusion. 2 . The arguments set forth in the enclosure to this despatch may be summarised thus. The railway is not necessary, and if it were rebuilt the Saudi authorities could never keep it running properly for more than a short time. His Majesty’s Government are under no moral obligation to pay for the rebuilding of the line; they would get little credit if they did pay for it; our help would weigh for little in the mind of Ibn Saud, among other important considerations, and would be forgotten if the railway did not pay its way and became a burden; it is not to the advantage of His Majesty’s Government that Ibn Saud should be saddled with another financial obligation; and the possibility of our being allowed to use the railway in time of war is so remote as to be, by itself, of very little weight. 3. Some of the arguments which I have adduced against the proposal would fall to the ground if it could be shown that the railway receipts would cover the cost of maintenance and renewals—and that they would be used for that purpose. It is difficult to estimate the number of passengers that there would be, but it is quite certain that the passenger traffic would depend mainly on the pilgrimage, and would therefore be seasonal to an extent hardly known anywhere else in the world, and it seems to a lay mind that a railway is the most uneconomic method of dealing with such traffic. What revenue might be expected to accrue to the Saudi exchequer from the carriage of grain from Transjordan can better be calculated there than here. But of one thing we can be certain, i.e., that there is no ground for supposing that the railway receipts would be set aside for maintenance and renewals, or that the line could be run wuth tolerable efficiency over a period of years. I have quoted the Jedda condenser as an analogy, and that is an example favourable to the Saudi authorities, since the condenser is simple compared with a railway system, it is under their eyes, and its possible profits are known to a dollar. But not only are repairs not executed when they begin to be necessary, but the money for essential spares, which it takes months to obtain from abroad, cannot be extracted from the Minister of Finance, who deals with the condenser personally, until the machine is in danger of breaking down or has actually stopped. The railway revenue would be used as general revenue, the smallest possible sums would be spent on the line, and the railway employees would be months in arrear with their salaries and would be selling spares and material to keep themselves alive. The Saudi Government would never offer the salaries required to secure well-trained railway experts, and if they had such experts at their disposal they would not give them the authority, still less the financial powers, necessary for the proper administration of the line, but would run it themselves by the penny-farthing methods which they apply to all commercial and industrial activities. I have, &amp;c. R. W. BULLARD. f [956 a—4]2 Enclosure. The Hejaz Railway. SHOULD the line from Ma’an to Medina be rebuilt, and, if so, should His Majesty’s Government pay part or the whole of the cost of rebuilding 1 The main considerations, for and against. (1) The line is necessary. The line would be convenient for some pilgrims, but it cannot be considered necessary, for pilgrims manage very well without it, either sailing from Syrian or Palestinian ports or going by rail to Suez and taking ship from there. When the Hejaz Railway was planned motor transport was hardly thought of. Lo-day pilgrims can travel from Nejaf to Medina quite easily by car, and although the journey from Ma’an to Medina by car is at present very difficult, it has been accomplished, and the route might perhaps be improved for much less money than would have to be spent on a railway. The passenger traffic on the line would be seasonal, with a very low level for three-quarters of the year and a rise with two tremendous peaks in the remaining quarter. The Hejaz Railway would be particularly useful for pilgrims from Turkey, but for the last ten years the number of Turkish pilgrims has not exceeded 200, and this low figure, which is due to the financial and religious policy of the Turkish Government, is not likely to rise considerably for a long time, if ever. How far a railway is required for transport ing grain from Transjordan to the Hejaz must be left for experts. The transport of grain is effected somehow at present, and it must be remembered that a railway would deprive of their livelihood many people who now live by animal transport in that area. (2) His Majesty's Government should rebuild the line because it was they who destroyed, it. In the first place it must be remembered that the line was built in the teeth of the Sharif (afterwards King) Husain. He and his tribes did, in fact, prevent the extension of the line to Mecca. It is no excuse to say that the Hejaz did not want a railway connecting it with Turkey, but does want one connecting it with the Arab States to the north. The fact remains that if the Sharif Husain had had his way the line would never have reached Medina. Then, while it is true to say that His Majesty’s Government destroyed the line, the destruction was accomplished with the assent and enthusiastic co-operation of the Arabs in com bined operations for a common end, and the Arabs gained enormously as the result of the war, and at extremely low cost to themselves. Besides, what of the other countries allied to or associated with Great Britain for the purposes of the war ? To represent the destruction of the railway as effected by His Majesty’s Govern ment for their own ends is unreasonable and unfair. (3) His Majesty's Go comment would gain credit in the Moslem World if they paid for the reconstruction of the line. We do not seem to have incurred blame for the obvious part we took in the destruction of the line, and discredit is easier to acquire than credit. Our credit in the Moslem world is likely to rest upon more essential matters, e.g., our policy in Palestine. We might even be attacked in some quarters for interfering in the Holy Land, for constructing a railway with strategical and imperialistic aims, and so on. To meet, or to forestall, such criticisms Ibn Saud would probably have to minimise any part played by His Majesty’s Government in the business, just as at present he is carefully keeping the name of Italy out of all references to Saudi aviation, which is indebted to Italy in many respects for such little activity as it is showing. To sum up : the credit gained would probably be small, and there would be criticism which would counteract it, at least to some extent; and his position in the Moslem world might even compel Ibn Saud to minimise the part His Majesty’s Government had played in the restoration of the line.3 (4) The railway would be of advantage to Saudi Arabia, and we should therefore earn the gratitude of Ibn Saud by paying for it to be rebuilt. It is submitted that Ibn Sand's attitude towards His Majesty's Government will be decided by so many important considerations that such gratitude as we might earn (at heavy financial cost) by rebuilding the railway would not weigh very heavily in the balance. Moreover, unless the railway receipts covered main tenance and renewals. Ibn Sand’s gratitude for the past might soon be forgotten in anxiety for the future, and he might even look to His Majesty’s Government to meet the deficit and be more dissatisfied at their refusal than he seems to be with the situation as it is at present. Whether the railway could be made to pay is a question for experts. We can be certain that people who only ran the Jedda condenser with great difficulty would run a railway with the same centralised inefficiency, and that it would speedily deteriorate for lack of essential repairs and replacements. Unless it is quite certain that the railway would not become a burden to Saudi Arabia its reconstruction is not to be recommended from the British point of view, for nothing that causes the financial situation of Saudi Arabia to deteriorate would be to the advantage of His Majesty’s Government in the long run. A self-supporting Ibn Saud is less likely to covet oil-fields, ports (with custom-houses) and taxable populations that are either under our control or at least kept out of his control by our influence, than an Ibn Saud who is always pulling the devil by the tail. (5) The railway might be of strategic value to His Majesty's Government in time of war. This would only apply if Saudi Arabia was our ally, and that seems, from the observation post of Jedda, to be a very remote contingency to work to. In case of a European war, Saudi Arabia would be in a position similar to that of Turkey in 1914, when the Central Powers could offer Turkey important territorial gains at the expense of the Allies, and the most the Allies could hope for was to persuade her to maintain neutrality. His Majesty’s Government would have reason to be satisfied if Saudi Arabia remained neutral, and to spend money on the railway in the hope that we might be allowed to use it in war time would seem to be a highly speculative investment. But, of course, if there were other important con siderations which were in favour of the reconstruction of the line, that faint chance of our being allowed to use it in war time would be an additional induce ment, provided—a point which must be left to experts in strategy—the railway could not be made an important weapon against us if Saudi Arabia should join the enemies of His Majesty’s Government.'• » \ I 1 ' Li .

CONFIDENTIAL Colonial Office, Downing Street, S.W.l. 7 December, 1936. My dear Rendel, With further reference to your letter (E. 1133/205/25) of the 7th of May on the subject of the the High Commissioner containing his observations on the conclusions reached by the Haifa conference, consideration of which in the Colonial Office has had to be postponed on account of many more urgent preoccupations. method of financing the reconstruction of the line from Ma*an to Medina, the High Commissioner points out that the Palestine, Syria and Trans-Jordan sections are all running at a loss, and there is therefore no money out of which those sections of the line could finance the repair of the Saudi section. There are, of course, reasons for regarding the line as a single unit, but in the absence of any profit from the sections of the line in Trans-Jordan, Syria and Palestine, there is little likelihood of getting any contribution from any of those territories. There are no funds belonging to the Railway out of which contributions could be made, and the only way, therefore, in which a contribution could be obtained would be if the Governments concerned would provide some money out of general revenues. Since there is a considerable loss on the Palestine and Trans-Jordan sections, those Hejaz Railway, I now enclose a copy of a despatch from With regard to the crucial question of the Governments G.W. RENDEL, ESQ., C.M.G.Governments could reasonably say that they have already done their share in respect of the Railway by keeping the line open in their own territories and incurring a loss i: so doing. There seems to be little likelihood of either Palestine, Syria or Trans-Jordan contributing anything towards the scheme, save that Trans-Jordan might undertake some responsibility in respect of the small section in its ov/n territory, if the whole scheme were adopted. It seems to be equally unlikely that the Saudi Government will find the money at the present time. There appears to be no chance that the line will be a paying proposition, and one can hardly see the Saudi Government, which is notoriously short of money, providing £150,000 on which they would get no return. The unattractive commercial possibilities in turn seem to make it most unlikely that any private syndicate would undertake the work. It therefore appears that the only possible way of raising the money is that His Majesty’s Government should provide it. They certainly could not justifiably provide it on the grounds of the scheme’s commercial attractions, but it is conceivable that it might be possible to justify the expenditure on political grounds. The Railway was destroyed during the Great War and it might be argued that, having regard to the history of its destruction and to its general interest to the Moslem world, and as a gesture to the Moslem world, His Majesty’s Government should undertake to repair it. Such a gesture might have considerable advantages at the present time. It would show the Arabs that we are very much interested in their welfare and it might be a means of counteracting the spread of Italian influence in that area. ItIt may finally t&gt;e v/orth consideration,whether the Railway could he regarded as of possible strategic value to His Majesty*s Government. In the event of a war with Italy, if Saudi Arabia threw in their lot with us, it might conceivably be a link in an alternative route to the Suez Canal. Do you think in the circumstances that there is a case on general political grounds for His Majesty f s Government undertaking to pay the cost of repairing the Railway? If you think that there is a case, the next step would presumably be to bring the Treasury into consultation on the matter. If, on the other hand, you consider that there is no case, it is probably a waste of time to pursue the matter further as it seems extremely unlikely that any other source will assist to a sufficient extent to enable the money to be raised. The Railway has remained derelict for the last fifteen years without causing any great disturbance in the Moslem world and presumably it can remain derelict for a further period without any untoward results. As time goes on, the need for the Railway will probably become steadily less, since pilgrims will tend to go to Mecca more and more by motor routes.

KlygaR.MCK N0.TC/69/3S. High Contnissioner for Palestine, Jerusalem 12th May, 1936. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your Confidential despatch of the loth January, 1936, regarding the conference held at Haifa in October, 1935, on the subject of the reconditioning of the Hejaz Railway. 2. Of the conclusions reached by the conference on the five points which formed the agenda, I have no comment to make on Nos. 1, 2, 4, and 5, save to endorse the recommendations of the conference. 3. As regards the third point, namely the manner in which the expenses necessary for the reconditioning of the line are to be met, I would observe that I am unable to endorse the recommendation of the Saudi representative, Fuad Bey Hamza, that the reconditioning of the damaged sections should be effected at the expense of the line as a whole. Apart from the political aspect arising out of the question of the ownership of the sections of the railway in different territories, there is the practical consideration that both the Palestine - Trans-Jordan section and the section in Syria have no surplus funds whatsoever, while heavy expenditure for renewals will soon become necessary. The General Manager, l&gt;alestine Railways, informs me that if 7,000 pilgrims, each paying £P.12 for a return ticket, were carried annually by the railway the costs of the restored line might iust be covered and provision The Right Honourable J.H. THOMAS , P.O., M.P., His Majesty’s Principal secretary of State for the Colonies.provision made for some maintenance# but there would be no margin for renewals. I think, however, that the estimate of 7,000 pilgrims put forward by the Saudi delegates is much exaggerated, for only relatively few pilgrims, from Syria, Iraq, Palestine and Trans-Jordan, with a few in transit from India, pass by this route. Consequently I cannot suppose that His Majesty’s Government, or indeed any other source, would be willing to provide a sum of nearly £P.200,000 for the repair of a line which could be expected to earn so inadequate a return. And if restoration of the railway has any value commercially it is almost exclusively as a means to develop the northern Hejaz and to revive Medina, and to that extent any financial liability should rest entirely on the Saudi Government. 4. I need hardly say that I should be very glad if an agreed means could be found for the provision of the required capital. Apart from the incidental benefits which might be expected to accrue to Palestine and Trans-Jordan, as explained in my despatch Confidential B of the 14th June, 1934, I think that an agreement leading to the restoration of the line would favourably affect the political relations betvreen His Majesty’s Government and King Ibn Saud. But His Majesty’s Government are better able than I to judge what weight should be given to this consideration. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) Arthur Sfauchope.

(No. 49.) Sir, Jedda, February 16, 1936. WITH reference to my despatch No. 41 of the 4th February, I have now the honour to forward a translation of the note addressed by the Saudi Government to the British and French Legations here regarding the outcome of the technical conference held at Haifa last October to consider questions concerning the Hejaz Railway. This translation was agreed with that made in the French Legation. My French colleague now tells me that he has not found it necessary to amend the latter, except in the matter of French phraseology. The enclosed translation may, therefore, be regarded as similar, allowing for the difference between the two languages, to that which will be submitted to the French Government in the near future. 2 . You will observe that the Saudi Government make capital, under the third heading in their note, out of a statement made by the principal French delegate at the meeting of the Haifa Conference on the 17th October. They conveniently ignore the fact that, while the Lausanne Declaration did, as M. Vasselet stated, provide that surplus profits accruing from particular sections should be devoted to the upkeep and improvement of the whole railway, the Declaration did not in any way contemplate an unification of the various sections for all purposes, but very much the contrary. It appears to me that the Saudi Government’s suggestion that the railway should be considered a single entity is merely a particular application of their old thesis that the railway is one because it was in their view a Wakf. 3. My French colleague expressed general agreement with the view stated in the last sentence of the preceding paragraph when I discussed the matter with him on the 13th February. He showed, however, very little interest in any aspect of the question. He said that when he left Jedda early in October it was intended that he should attend the Haifa Conference. In the event he did not do so. He had not even read the minutes in Syria nor had he received them here. His attitude was that all proposals with a view to reconditioning the line for through services were so unpractical as not to be worth bothering about. I may add that he was equally contemptuous of the idea that motor-services from Damascus to Medina could be successfully organised by any inland route, although he thought that a coastal route from Aqaba might be practical politics. I quote these views, not because the personal views of my French colleague count for much, but because they probably reflect the opinion of the French authorities in Syria with whom he is in much closer touch than he is with the French Government at home. 4 .

Your Excellency, {January 20, 1936). I HAVE the honour to inform your Excellency that I have received a copy of the minutes of the meetings of the conference of Haifa which was held from the 10th to the 17th October, 1935, and was attended by representatives of the [656 b—3]2 Saudi Arab, British and French Governments. I am glad to inform you of the following :— Firstly .—The conference held five meetings. Its discussions were technical, as was determined prior to the meeting, and in accordance with the following agenda :— 1 . Examination of the degree of reconditioning which the railway requires. 2 . Preparation of an estimate of the cost of the necessary work. 3. Establishment of the manner in which the necessary expense is to be met. 4. Consideration of a project for the organisation of a train service along the whole length of the railway. 5. Consideration of a project for the eventual distribution of rolling-stock among the different sections of the line. Secondly .—I am glad to state that the conference succeeded in drawing up a basis of agreement in respect of items 1, 2, 4 and 5 of the agenda, as you may observe from the report; but it is regretted that the conference declared its failure to reach an agreed solution in respect of item 3, regarding expenses and how to cover them, and left the question of raising funds to the Governments themselves. Thirdly .—I give you hereunder a copy of the text of the paragraph in the report regarding the decision of the conference about item 3 :— “While recording the proposal of Fuad Bey Hamza to the effect that the reconstruction of the damaged sections should be effected at the expense of the line as a whole, the conference regretted that it had not been able to reach an agreed resolution on this important question. In these circum stances, the conference could only commend the matter to the consideration of the Governments concerned.” I also wish to mention the reply given by the representative of the French Government to his colleagues in the conference concerning the conditions on which he believes it would be possible for one portion of the line to help the other in its expenses. The text is as follows : — “ M. Vasselet, speaking for the Syrian section, said that contribution by this section to expenditure in respect of sections situated outside its territory was envisaged by the Lausanne (Bompard) Declaration. At the present time, however, the conditions provided by that Declaration had not been realised. During recent years, far from realising any profit and despite the reduction in expenditure which had now reached its lowest limit, the working of the section had resulted in a deficit. The settlement of the question submitted to the conference must, therefore, necessarily be sought in a different manner to that which has been proposed.” Fourthly .—The Government of His Majesty the King appreciate the many economic advantages which would accrue to this country, and all other countries through which the line passes, as a result of the reopening of the unserviceable section. They therefore wish to draw the attention of the French and British Governments to the only solution which would, in practice, assist in the reopening of that part, viz., the line should be considered as one and should bear as a whole the expenses to be incurred on the damaged sections south of Ma’an. In the event of your Excellency’s Government agreeing to accept this fundamental principle now, there will naturally be occasion to discuss how the necessary funds should be raised for the repairs, whether by loan or by other means, to be studied later. I shall be glad if your Government will assist in the settlement of this outstanding question by agreeing to the principle of the unity of the line, as mentioned above. I am sending a true copy of this note to your French colleague. With highest respects, FEYSAL.r TJ' L 1 Notes. Register No. V P. z. / SECRET. Minute Paper. 340/36.

G. and the French Government accepted the suggestion of the Saudi Government that a conference should be held to discuss technical questions connected with the Hejaz Railway, and particularly the reconditioning of &lt;’ ■ 1 the section between Maan and Medina, &lt;M^/condition that the agenda should be prepared beforehand so as to exclude any question of the ownership and status of the railway. On the latter point it will be remembered that H.M.G. and the French Government on the one hand and the Saudi Government on the other take divergent views which neither side is willing to detract (See Minutes at P.Z.4277/34 and P.Z.3207/33). Briefly, H.M.G. and the French Government consider that the status of the railway is governed by the Lausanne Declaration of 1923 upon the basis of management/management of the different sections of the line by the separate administrations in Syria, Palestine, Transjordan and the Hejaz^ whilst ibn Saud regards the railway as a unified whole and a religious institution whose ownership is therefore vested in the Hejaz. The conference attended by representatives of the mandatory powers and Saudi Arabia met at Haifa in October to consider the following points. (1) To agree as to the reconditioning which the railway requires; ( 2 ) to prepare an estimate of the cost of the necessary work; (3) establishment of the manner in which the necessary expense is to be met; (4) consideration of the project for the organisation of a service along the whole length of the railway; (5) consideration of the project for the distribution of rolling stock amongst the different sections of the line. The report of the proceedings of the conference will be found immediately below and the conclusions reached are flagged. Points (1), (2), (4) and (5) were satisfactorily settled, but no agreement was reached in regard to the method for meeting the expense necessary for reconditioning the Hejaz sections of the line. as the Syria and Palestine sections are already running e«*c at a deficit, it is unlikely that either of the mandatory powers wo-ulrd be willing to put up the necessary funds; more especially as the projected service on the Hejaz line is unlikely to prove a profitable concern. Unless, therefore, Ibn Saud, for reasons of political or religious prestige, is prepared to find the whole sum himself, it seems unlikely that anything will come of the scheme. «&lt;Y, 'N SEEN POLITICAL COMMITTED 21 JA^! 1936r i duplicate copy i BY AIR MAIL l-t VAgCH .

He referred to the technical nature of the Conference but thought that, in the early stages at any rate, it would be preferable to avoid too much technical detail* ITEMS 1 &amp; 2 (1) EXAMINATION OP THE DEGREE OP RECONDITIONING WHICH THE RAILWAY REQUIRES AND (2) PREPARATION OP AN ESTIMATE OP THE COST OF THE NECESSARY WORK* On the suggestion of M* Vasselet the Conference considered these two items together as they were closely related. Mr. Webb said that the section between Maan and Mudawara had been examined in 1934 and that two estimates had been prepared; one of the cost of the absolute minimum repairs necessary to allow a train service to operate and the other the cost of reconditioning the line completely to its pre-war standard. He gave the costs as approximately £P.25,000 and £p.50,000 respectively and the time of the work as six months and eighteen months respectively from the time the material was collected. M* Vasselet asked for some details of the condition of the line and Mr. Webb said he would supply the Conference with copies of the report of his Engineer. This report was hended in later in the day. Mr. Webb said that an Inspector who had previously been in the service of the Hijaz Railway in the South had just been over the line between Medina and Mudawara and had arrived in Haifa with his report the previous evening. ThisThis report was now being translated and Mr. Webb suggested that in the meantime it would be interesting to hear a brief verbal report from the Inspector. The Inspector was then introduced to the Conference and gave some information as to the condition of the line. It was decided to continue with the translation of the report and it was noped that Puad Bey Hamza and his technical experts would be in a pcs ition the following morning to give estimates similar to those supplied for the Maan-Mudawara section and the Conference would then be in a position to complete items 1 and 2 of the agenda. Puad Bey Hamza thought the ultimate aim should be to restore the line to its pre-war condition but in the first p]a ce it would only be necessary to effect such repairs as would permit the running of trains. Mr. Webb explained that the smaller estimate for the Maan-Mudawara section provided for the re-opening of only two stations&gt; the filling in, instead of the repair, of many bridges and the use as far as possible of cut-down damaged rails. Puad Bey Hamza agreed that a number of stations on the Mudawara-Medina section should also not be re opened. He thought it would be possible to base the cost of reconditioning that section on the estimate for the cheaper scheme for the Maan-Mudawara section. The Conference agreed and decided to resume the discuss! on of Items 1 and 2 and also Item 5 which was closely connected therewith on the following day. TheTne Conference adjourned from 1.15 p.m. until 4 p.m. when item 4 of the agenda was discussed. ITEM 4 . CONSIDERATION OP A PROJECT FOR THE ORGANISATION OP A TRAIN SERVICE ALONG THE WHOLE LENGTH OP THE RAILWAY. It was considered that one through mixed train service a week throughout the line would suffice to 'begin with hut that during five months of the year comprising Rajah, the Pilgrimage season and Ramadan more trains should he run as required. The Saudi Arabia delegates thought that during these five months 7,000 pilgrims might he expected to travel in each direction. The Conference agreed with tne suggestion of the Syrian delegates that this proposal should not necessarily envisage a new train in addition to the present services on the sections now operating hut that the timetable should he designed to reduce the time of the journey between Damascus and Medina and vice versa to a minimum. The Conference thought that was a matter which might he considered in due course between the Railway Administrations concerned. It was remarked that occasional service trains would he required. Mr. Wehh considered that the train service would he a matter of experience and that one train a week, while not making a very strong case for the reopening of the line, would he a sufficiently good basis on which to inaugurate the service. While he had no grounds for proposing a larger service he remarked that«a tliat in considering the matter beforehand ne had envisaged two trains a week as being more likely to meet public needs and attract traffic. He realised, however, that this would involve twice the number of engines and stock required. Puad Bey Hamza said that before the war the time taken between Medina and Damascus was 54 hours and it was thought that* provided trains ran at night, this time could be resumed* Mr. Webb considered that the degree of reconditioning might affect speeds and night running. The Conference adjourned at 6.15 p.m. until 10 a.m. the following day October 11th, item 5 to be discussed should the report of the Saudi Arabia experts not yet be ready. October 11th, 1955. The report on the Mudawara-Medina section having been translated the Saudi Arabia technical experts left the Conference in order, with the assistance of the Chief Engineer of the Palestine Railways, to produce an estimate of the approximate costs of reconditioning the line between Medina and Mudawara and the Conference agreed in the meantime to proceed with the discussion of Item 5 of the agenda. ITEM 5.ITEM 5. CONSIDERATION OP A PROJECT FOR THE EVENTUAL DISTRIBUTION OP ROLLING STOCK AMONG THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OP THE LINE. On a question raised Ly Mr- WebL, M- Vasselet tHought that as in the case of the division between the Syrian* Trans-Jordan and Palestine sections in 1926 the terms of Article 108 of the Treaty of Lausanne would be a suitable basis on which this question might be decided. This basis was the length of track and nature and amount of traffic in August 1914 as measured by train kilometrage the division to be on the last inventory of stock prior to October 30th* 1918- Fuad Bey Hamza said that although Saudi Arabia was not a party to that Treaty he agreed that it would form a suitable basis on which the redistribution could be arranged. He felt, however, that this division might result in an insufficient and inequitable apportionment to the Saudi Arabia section of the railway and ne wished, therefore, to reserve his complete agreement until the figures providing the divisor for each section of the line were available and until he had received a reply to a telegram which he proposed to send to his Government. M« Gasc stated that from the timetables and other information available in his office he could produce in 5 or 6 days the necessary particulars to enable this divisor to be arrived at from the train kilometrage on the Mudawara-Medina section in 1914. This information would0 r-\. would te subject to agreement “by the Saudi Arabia and Palestine representatives. Mr* Abcarius suggested that had the division between the three countries taken place in 1926 the probability was that Saudi Arabia would have accepted division on the proposed basis. Mr. Webb remarked that any division of stock under present conditions v/ould leave the Palestine and Trans-Jordan sections short of serviceable rolling stock and would involve expenditure on replacement by reconditioning or purchase. M* Vasselet said that the position would be the same on the Syrian section. as he had thought the Hijaz Railway had originally been very generously equipped. distributed and that some remained on the Mudawara-Medina section. He also said that much of the stock was destroyed or damaged and consisted only of old frames. These would require almost complete rebuilding. Mr. Webb referred to the number of derelict engines on his section compared to serviceable engines. M- Vasselet and Mr. Y/ebb mentioned that they had already reconditioned a considerable quantity of stock and M« Vasselet suggested that following the practice which had always been in force on the Syrian, Trans-Jordan and Palestine sections, each section should Fuad Bey Hamza expressed some surprise at this Mr. Webb replied that the stock had been bebe responsible for the repair and reconstruction of its own stock. The Conference spent some time examining details of the division in 1926. As the estimates for the reconditioning of the Mudawara-Medina section were not yet ready the Conference proceeded to a tentative discussion of Item 3. ITEM 5 . ESTABLISHMENT OP THE MANNER IN WHICH THE NECESSARY EXPENSE 13 TO BE MET. M* Vasselet said that each section had hitherto undertaken its own reconstruction and repair and he would have no suggestions to offer if this principle were to be modified. Mr. Webb also found it difficult to make a useful propcB al as to the manner in which the cost of reconstruction should be met. He thought it would be as well briefly to explain the financial pos ition of the Palestine and Trans-Jordan sections. Although the Palestine section was at present busy with short distance traffic and, following a good harvest in Trans-Jordan , there was a temper ary traffic in grain, the normal traffic in Trans-Jordan was light as shown by the small train service and the position was that the sections of the Hijaz Railway under his administration were in debt to the Palestine Government. The Railway showed a deficit of some £p.27,000 on the last year f s working and the accumulated deficit amounted to about £p.71,000. The lTile Railway was now some 30 years old. and the time was approaching when they would be faced with heavy expenditure on renewals for which no fund existed. M* Vasselet said the Syrian section was in a similar position and had no surplus funds. Fuad Bey Hamza did not care for the reference in this connection to the different sections. He said the line had been built as one railway and he thought the Conference should consider the line as a wnole and not as divided into sections. He considered tnat if it were decided to recondition and re-open one part which had been closed the cost should be borne by the whole line. He agreed that in this instance his proposal amounted to a suggestion that the cost of reconditioning the line South of Maan should be borne by the line now open namely the line in Syria, Trans-Jordan and Palestine. M« Vasselet contended that hitherto each Government had maintained the section in its territory and if any departure from this principle was proposed reasons for the change should be advanced. The Conference adjourned at 1.30 p.m. and as it was learnt that the estimates for the reconditioning of the Mudawara-Medina section could not be ready until the following morning and nothing further could be done without these estimates it was decided to re-assemble at 10 a.m. on that date October 12th. OctoberOctober 12th 1935 The Conference met at 10 a.m. Fuad Bey Hamza said that for the reconditioning of the line between Mudawara and Medina his expert advisers had arrived at an estimate of £P.121,075.146 mils which he suggested should be rounded off to £P.125,000. Khalid Bey Hakim explained that in making this estimate he had allowed for the reconstruction of bridges and for the use as far as possible of material on the ground and in the vicinity of the railway including the use of cut-down damaged rails. He had eliminated all stations except those required for watering purposes. He remarked that this degree of reconditioning would involve more maintenance than would normally be necessary. M. Vasselet said it was a logical assumption that the bridges had been considered necessary on construction and that necessity must be taken to remain. He was strongly of opinion that the bridges should be repaired and should not be filled in. Mr. Webb agreed with M. Vasselet*s remark regarding the necessity for the bridges on construction and had himself been about to make a similar remark. He wondered, however, whether, in view of the small train service envisaged they would not be justified in taking some risk of the line being damaged and temporarily put out of action occasionally. M. Vasselet considered that no such risk should be taken, human life being involved, and the Conference agreed that the line should be repaired to a minimum extent compatible with safety bearing in mind the regular running ofof one train a week and additional trains when required especially during the five months of the heavier traffic. It was agreed that this minimum reconditioning should include the reconstruction and repair of bridges hut that it should eliminate all stations except those required for watering, engine changing and train crossing purposes. Mr. Webb said that his lower estimate for the Maan- Mudawara section had been for very light reconditioning including the filling in of many bridges and culverts. The higher estimate was for the complete restoration of the line to its pre-war standard. In order to bring the reconditioning of that section into line with the recommendation of the Conference he thought it would be suitable to take an approximate figure of £P.35,000. The Conference considered that 20% should be added to the estimates for the two sections for transport of material and for contingent and unforeseen expenditure bringing the figure to £P.42,000 and £P.150,000 for the Maan-Mudawara and the Mudawara-Medina sections respectively or £P.192,000 for the whole work. It was desired to emphasise that this estimate was based on present conditions and information and was only to be regarded as approximate. The Conference then resumed the discussion on Item 3 'Manner in which the necessary expense is to be met', but as it became apparent that they would not be able to arrive at any agreed recommendation on this question it was decided to adjourn until 10 a.m. on October 17th to enable the delegates to&lt; 0 &gt; to refer to their respective Governments for instructions. Fuad Bey Hamza proposed that the Governments should he asked if they were prepared to consider the Hijaz Railway as a whole for the purpose of finding funds for the restoration of the line between Maan and Medina. He asked to be supplied with information as to the financial position of the Hijaz Railway at the signing of the Armistice and in subsequent years to date. Both M. Vasselet and Mr. Webb thought they would be unable to supply the information except for the more recent years as the railway had continued under military control for some time after the war. Fuad Bey Hamza then said he would be satisfied with information giving the receipts, expenditure and excess or deficiency each year for as many years back as possible. Fuad Bey Hamza further made reference to the possibility of the use of the funds collected by means of the Hijaz Railway stamp duty. The Conference adjourned at 1.30 p.m. October 17th, 1935. The Conference re-assembled at 10 a.m. In reply to a request by Fuad Bey Hamza at the previous session Mr. Webb regretted that, as he had first thought, he was unable to give particulars of the receipts and expenditure prior to the financial year 1924/25 but he handed to the members of the Conference a statement giving the information for and subsequent to that year. M. VasseletFuad Bey Hamza M* Vasselet supplied a similar statement in respect of the section in Syria. M. Vasselet also handed in a summarised statement of the stock on the whole line in 1918. The Conference then reverted to subject 5, ’’Consideration of a project for the eventual redistribution of rolling stock among the different sections of the line”. As promised at the session on 11th October M. Vasselet gave the following train kilometrage in 1914 on the different sections as follows based on information the accuracy of which was assumed :- Palestine and Trans-Jordan 414*000 Syria 391,200 Hijaz 300,800 which, for the purpose of division of stock, gave the following approximate percentages Syrian Section 36.5% Palestine and Trans-Jordan Sections 36.5% Saudi Arabia Section 27 % 100 % M. Vasselet remarked that the figures for the Syrian and Palestine and Trans-Jordan sections differed slightly from those used in the division in 1926 and explained that this was due to the fact that the figures agreed with Colonel Holmes in 1926 were approximate whereas the new figures were exact.Fuad Bey Hamza li Fuad Bey Hamza then withdrew his reservation on this subject made at the session on October 11th and agreed in principle to accept the conditions of Article 108 of the Lausanne Treaty as a basis for the division of stock. He could not, however, accept without examination the figure 01 train kilometrage in Saudi Arabia as given by M. Vasselet because these were based on information obtained from one-sided and unofficial sources and not on any official timetable in operation at that time. Fuad Bey Hamza wished the official timetable to be used as a basis. M. Vasselet pointed out that the timetable gave the maximum number of trains which it was possible to envisage and this was greater than the number of trains which actually ran. Fuad Bey Hamza said he was not in a position at this juncture to give the actual figures of train kilometrage in Saudi Arabia in 191L but having agreed in principle to the method of division he preferred to defer the question of the actual figures to be adopted until a later date. The Conference then resumed the discussion on Subject 3 ’’Establishment of the manner in which the necessary expense is to be met”&gt; Fuad Bey Hamza repeated his previous proposal that the reconstruction should he paid for by the whole line and he waited any other proposals from the representatives of the Syrian and Palestine and Trans-Jordan sections. M. Vasselet, speaking for the Syrian section, said that contribution to expenditure in respect of sections situated outside its territory was envisaged by the Lausanne (Bompard) Declaration* At the present time, however, the conditions provided by that Declaration had not been realized. During recent years, far from realising any profit and despite the reduction in expenditure which had now reached its lowest limit, the working of the section had resulted in a deficit. ,7 i Settlement of the question submitted to the Conference must, therefore, necessarily be sought in a different manner to that which had been proposed. Mr* Webb referred to his previous explanation of the financial position of the Palestine and Trans-Jordan sections and regretted that in the circumstances he also was unable to suggest a manner of profiding funds for the reconditioning of the line. It was decided, therefore that while recording the proposal of Fuad Bey Hamza that the reconditioning of the line should be paid for by the Railway as a whole the Conference must with regret admit their inability to arrive at an agreed conclusion on this important point and state that they had no alternative but to propose that the matter should be left for the consideration of the Governments concerned. There being no other points to discuss Mr. Webb thanked the delegates for their co-operation and expressed his pleasure at meeting them and at the interesting and amicable discussion which had taken place. M. Vasselet .M. Vasselet and Fuad Bey Hamza responded and the Conference terminated at 12.45 p.m. SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS. EXAMINATION OF THE DEGREE OF RECONDITIONING WHICH THE RAILWAY REQUIRES. The Conference considered that the line should be repaired to the minimum compatible with safety, bearing in mind the regular running of one train a week and additional trains when required especially during the five months of the heavier traffic. It was considered that this minimum reconditioning should include the reconstruction of bridges but it should eliminate all stations except those required for water, engine changing and train crossing purposes. ITEM 2. PREPARATION OF AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST OF THE NECESSARY WORK. The approximate estimates of reconstruction in the degree recommended under Item 1 are £P.35,000 for the Maan- Mudawara section and £P. 125,000 for the Mudawara-Medina section. To these figures should be added 20^ for the transport of materials and contingent and unforseen expenditure giving figures of £F.42,000 and £P.150,000 or a total for the whole work of £P.192,000. \ Thewas based on present conditions and information and should only be considered as approximate. ITEM 3. ESTABLISHMENT OP THE MANNER IN V7HICH THE NECESSARY TTl’V* T'fcTmVT O Tf** rri /*&gt; T-v t-» r, EXPENSE IS TO BE MET. While recording the prox^osal of Puad Bey Hamza to the effect that the reconstruction of the sections damaged should be effected at the expense of the line as a whole, the Conference regretted that it had not been able to reach an agreed resolution on this important question. In these circumstances, the Conference could only commend the matter to the consideration of the Governments concerned. (La Conference ne peut que laisser aux Gouvernements interesses le soin de poursuivre 1 T aboutissement de cette question). ITEM 4. CONSIDERATION OP A PROJECT FOR THE ORGANISATION OP A TRkIN SERVICE ALONG THE WHOLE LENGTH OP THE RAILWAY The Conference considered that in the first place it would be sufficient to arrange for one mixed train a week in each direction between Maan and Medina, this train to connect with existing services on the Hijaz Railway in Trans-Jordan, Syria and Palestine. Additional trains to be arranged as required Ramadan in the five months of Rajab/and the Pilgrimage.4 ITEM 5 CONSIDERATION OP A PROJECT FOR THE EVENTUAL DISTRIBUTION OP ROLLING STOCK AMONG THE DIPPERENT SECTIONS OP THE LINE. The Conference considered that as in the division of stock Between the Syrian, Trans-Jordan and Palestine sections of the Railway in 1926 the stock on the whole railway according to the last inventory before October 30th. 1918 should be distributed in accordance with Article 108 of the Treaty of Lausanne 1923, namely on the length of track and the nature and amount of the traffic as represented by the train kilometrage on each section operated in August 1914.Downing Street, I K m:;sTXH2 V\ ' il’’ID3XNTIAL January, 1936 V 0 Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your confidential despatch of the 29th Hovember, 1935, transmitting copies of the minutes of a conference held in Haifa in October last on the subject of the reconditioning of the Hejaz Railway. 2* Before taking any further action in the matter, I shall await any conrients which you wish to offer.

Mr. Case is an official of the Chemius de ?er Danas, Hama et Prolongememts and acta as general manager for the section of the Hejas railway in Syrian territory. 2. After stating that the part of the line between Damascus and joman was in perfect order, Mr. Case said the acute problem lay in the reconditioning of the 730 kilometres of track in Se’udian territory, and that no accurate idea of its cost could be made until the heavy drifts of sand, which in many places covered the line, had been removed. Provisionally, the conference thought that two hundred thousand pounds sterling would be required to put the whole length of line in working order. (Privately, Mr. Gasc told me that he, personally, considered that it would cost very much more) tfhen asked what share of the burden Syria would have to bear, Mr. Gasc replied evasively, saying thet it had been agreed that the four governments should arrange to provide what was required proportionally.Jy INDEXED In any further communication on this subject, please quote No -£ bi.

R. ajesty’s Government fully bhare the desire of the Saudi Arab Goveroment for tne re-opening of the southern section oi the He^az Railway, and they ere aleo confident that if this object were achieved great benefit would be conferred upon all the territories through which the railway runs. 3. His Majesty’s Government therefore accept the proposal of the Saudi Arab Government that discussion of the technical matters connected with the reconditioning of the damaged section of the railway and x,he resumption of traffic thereon should again be umertaken. 4. His ajesty’s Government in the United ingdom have taiien note of uhe reservations aade by the Government of Saudi Arabia in regard to the ownership and status of the His Royal Highness The Minister for Foreign Affairs11 * the Hejaz Railway. They consider it necessary, however, for their part also to place on record that their own position with regard to these matters remains unchanged and is based upon the Declaration made at Lausanne on the &amp;7th January, 19^3. 5. It will, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, be of advantage to all parties to agree in advance on the precise and complete agenda for discussion at the proposed conference, and they accordingly propose, for the consideration of the Saudi Arab Government, that the following agenda be adopted:- 1. Examination of the degree of reconditioning which the railway requires. Preparation of an estimate of the cost of the necessary work. Establishment of the manner in which the necessary expense is to be met. Consideration of a project for the organisation of a train service along the whole length of the railway. Consideration of a project for the eventual distribution of rolling-stock among the different sections of the line. If this agenda is acceptable to the Saudi Arab Government I have the honour to suggest, on behalf of my Government, that the proposed conference shall assemble at Haifa in Palestine on the 10th October next, and that the chief Palestinian delegate shall preside over the discussions. 7. 111 . IV. V. 6 .7. I have the honour to request that Your koyal Highness will inform me as soon as possible whether these proposals meet with the approval of the Saudi Arab Government, in order that the necessary arrangements may be male for the holding of the conference.

Please see Foreign Office official letter of 22nd February at P.Z.1276/34 and the previous submissions at P.Z.7319/34 and 4277/34. The Saudi Government have now addressed an identical Note to the British and French Representatives at Jedda putting forward official proposals for a conference to discuss technical matters in connection with the Hejaz Railway. The text of the note is flagged ’A’. It will be remembered that the Saudi Government had already been informed that the British and French Governments would be prepared to entertain proposals on these lines on the understanding that the conference would be confined to purely technical questions and that if the Saudi Government wished to make a reservation regarding the ownership or character of the railway they must do so in the correspondence leading up to the conference and not during the conference itself. In these circumstances the Saudi Note, although it reiterates the refusal of the Saudi Government to accept the Lausanne Declaration (by which in the view of H.M.G. and of the French Government the status of the Hejaz Railway is governed) and although it makes a very definite reservation regarding the ownership, unity and privileges etc. of,'the Line', seems quite satisfactory. It is true that the Saudi Government were informed that it must be clearly understood that any discussion would have to be conducted on the basis of the Lausanne Declaration (i.e. on the basis of the management of the different sections of the railway by the separate administrations in Syria, Palestine, Transjordan and the Hejaz and not as a whole), but this did not presumably mean that we expected the Saudi Government to accept the terms/ 2956 6000 7 34terms of the Lausanne Declaration itself and indeed it was clear, in view of their previous attitude, that they would never agree to do so. On the other hand it seems desirable in replying to the Saudi Governments Note to define the attitude of H.M.G, quite clearly by making the counter reservations suggested by Sir Andrew Ryan in para. 8 of his despatch of 27th January (copy enclosed in Foreign Office letter of 22nd February), If this is done and if, as already suggested by the French Government (P.Z.7319/34), a precise agenda is agreed upon with the Saudi Government in advance of the proposed conference^ the position of H.M.G. should be satisfactorily safe guarded. The next step is to consult the French with a view to returning identical replies to the Saudi Government’s Note and the F.O. propose that a meeting should be held in the near future to decide the terms in which H.M.G. should now address the French Government. From the papers at P.Z.1028/35 it will be seen that the Government of India are taking an interest in this question in view of its possible reactions on public opinion in Muslim India and that arrangements have been made to keep the Government of India in close touch with developments. A draft letter to the F.O. agreeing with the views expressed in their letter of 22nd February and to the attendance of an India Office representative at the proposed interdepartmental meeting is submitted. tr~Kx^ ' LakttOUiti r -T &lt;*oi tLx^JL &amp; 7t M \ ( ■ ?I &gt; Draft Paper.

We do not ourselves see a very great deal of difference in the alternative readings which he suggests. At the same time if by any chance your Librarian, whom we know to be an expert on Arabic, could possibly find the time to look at the enclosed quotation from the Saudi note and could let us have his views on the point raised by Ryan, we should be exceedingly grateful.

With reference to Foreign Office letter No* £ 588/588/25 of the 29th January regarding the Heje.z railway, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, the accompanying copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Minister at Jedda, enclosing a translation of a note from the Saudi Government formally proposing that a conference should be held between representatives of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom ,the French Government and themselves, to discuss, from the technical aspect, the possibility of reconditioning the railway. A similar note has been addressed by the Saudi Government to the French Government. 2. As Sir Samuel Hoare is aware, from the previous correspondence on this subject, the proposal contained in the Saudi note is only the first step in a procedure, the main lines of which have already been agreed upon with the French Government. As the next step in this procedure, His Majesty's Government must now reach agreement with the French Government on the terms of the identic rei)ly which the two Governments will return to the Saudi note. 3. It appears to Sir John Simon that there is considerable force in the observations made by Sir Andrew Ryan in paragraphs 4-8 of his despatch on the attitude of the Saudi Government towards/ The Under Secretary of State, India Office. COPY SENT BY A4R MAW- 2 8 FEB 1935 of.towards the Lausanne Declaration. The importance of that Declaration in the eyes of His Majesty’s Government lies in the fact that it is an embodiment of their views on the status of the Hejaz railway. But in Sir John Simon’s telegram No. 148 of the 20th November to Sir Andrew Ryan, copies of which were enclosed in Foreign Office letter No. E 6874/1277/25 of the 22nd November to the India Office, His Majesty’s Government specifically agreed to allow the Saudi Government to make a reservation regarding the status of the railway, though on tne understanding that that reservation would be made in the correspondence leading up to the proposed discussions and would not be introduced into the discussions themselves with the fatal results experienced at the Haifa Conference of 1928. So far as the terms of the actual reservation contained in the Saudi note of the 18th January are concerned, Sir John Simon is inclined to consider that they do not exceed the limits which His Majesty’s Government have already agreed to admit and that His Majesty’s Government need therefore do no more than take formal note of the reservation in replying to the Saudi communication and add the counter-reservations suggested by Sir Andrew Ryan in paragraph 8 of his despatch, without further pressing the Saudi Government to agree to the Lausanne Declaration as a basis of the proposed conference. 4. Further, in the opinion of Sir John Simon it will be desirable, before approaching the French Government in this matter, to consider whether His Majesty’s Government wish at this stage to make any suggestions either to the French or Saudi Governments as to the time and place at which the proposed discussionsdiscussions should he held or as to the scope of the agenda. So far as the list of subjects for discussion is concerned, Sir John Simon presumes that this will he generally on the lines of the technical agenda proposed for the Haifa Conference of 1928, (see Foreign Office letters No. E 2673/475/91 of the 20th and 28th June, 1927, to the Colonial Office), namely, an examination of the degree of reconditioning which the railway requires; an estimate of the expense of the work involved; an arrangement as to the manner in wnich that expense is to he home; a project for the organisation of a train service along the railway; and possibly an arraiigement as to the distribution of rolling stock. 5. Sir John Simon would suggest that a meeting of representatives of the Departments concerned should he held in the near future with a view to deciding the terms in which His Majesty f s Government should address the French (Government. Meanwhile, since it is highly desirable that a reply should he returned to the Saudi Governments note as soon as possible and since a certain amount of delay must inevitably he caused by the necessary consultation with the French Government, Sir John Simon will he grateful if he may receive at the earliest possible opportunity any preliminary observations which Sir Samuel Eoare may wish to offer on the points raised in this letter. 6 . A similar letter is being addressed to the ColonialCOPY (E 962/588/25) British Legation, Jedda.' 27th January, 1935. No *19 . (192/149/3) Sir, h 1 date, I have the honour to forward herewith a translation of the identic note addressed to my French colleague and myself hy the Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs on January 18, regarding the proposal to hold a conference to deal with technical problems connected with the Hejaz Railway. Fuad Bey Hamza handed this note to me on January 20, saying that he had delivered a similar note to the French Charge d*Affaires the evening before. I delayed reporting until I had time to compare notes with the French Consulate, which M* Maigret left in charge of his Syrian assistant on January 21st, in order that our translations should agree. 2. The translation nov/ enclosed agrees in all material particulars with that made by the French Consulate and I have reason to hope that it is at least as accurate in detail. I am a little doubtful however about two points. The first relates to the words rendered 'from its 'establishment' in paragraph 2. An alteration of the pronoun might relate the material word to the preceding word 'question and give the sense 'the question of the line from its 'foundations' or 'in its fundamental aspects'. This The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., K.C.V.O** etc*. etc*. etc*This distinction is not worth pursuing hut the second point is of great material importance. My translator preceding the reservation formula and the word 'reserve' in the formula itself* The French translator takes the same view and uses the conventional 'fait toutes ses reserves' in his version of the formula. The Arabic words, however, are inflexions of two different verbal derivatives from the same root and it might conceivably be held that the word used in the actual formula meant 'preserve' rather than 'reserve'. I attach sufficient importance to this that I enclose a copy of the Arabic formula in case you should wish to consult experts. regarding the Lausanne declaration and the definiteness of the reservation, especially if the meaning I have suggested can be read into it* 4. The language of the Saudi Government regarding the Lausanne Declaration must be read in conjunction with their note of March 16th 1929 a copy of which was enclosed in Mr* Jakin’s despatch No* 83 of April 10th, 1929* In that note they contested the validity ol the Declaration on various grounds, the most important of which were that it did not take account of the Wakf character of the line and the Sharia law and that they had not themselves been a party to it. They now express readiness to modify their attitude but I do not think that this means that they abandon the position which they took up in 1929* It means rather that they abandon the position which they took up in 1928, when they sought to insist on a discussion of has used the word 'reservation' in the phrase immediately 3. The two most striking features of the substance of the note are the evasiveness of the language used i—of the fundamental questions of the ownership and the alleged Wakf character of the railway, as a condition of discussing the technical questions. 5. I confess my own inability to see how the British and French Governments can on their side insist on the acceptance of the Lausanne Declaration as a necessary preliminary to a technical conference. They did not do so in the note which their representatives addressed to the then Hejazi Government on January 12 1928 in pursuance of the instructions in Foreign Office telegram No.52 of December 29 1927. What they did later was to say that, if the question of ownership etc. were to be discussed, they could only be discussed on the basis of the Declaration but the third paragraph of Sir Austen Chamberlain^ despatch No. 234 (E 5604/407/35) of November 28th 1928 shows that they were still prepared for a resumption of the purely technical conference without laying down other conditions than that it should have the limited scope contemplated in their proposals of January 12, 1928. It appears to me to be difficult now to enforce a different view and I think that the Saudi Government have some ground for considering that they could not accept the Lausanne Declaration without prejudice to the question of the status of the Railway, which they wish to reserve. 6 . Quite apart from these considerations it seems to me that the British and French authorities might be considerably embarrassed, if, after a technical conference had taken place on the basis of that Declaration, Ibn Saud then held us to the strict letter of the Declaration and insisted on an advisory board at Medina. 7. It is all the more important to examine closely the form given to the Saudi reservation in the enclosed note, asA as their own contentions regarding its status and character have in the past 'been more positive than any counter statements 'by the British and French Governments in correspondence with the Saudi Government. The two Governments have relied on the Lausanne Declaration “but that Declaration did not in terms define the status of the Railway* It merely affirmed its religious character and assumed that its ownership had passed to the succession states. I am aware of the strong arguments in favour of this assumption 'but I am now concerned only with v/hat has passed 'between us and the Saudi Government. 8 . My conclusion, which I state with some diffidence, is that the question of acceptance of the Lausanne Declaration as a 'basis of the technical conference should not 'be pressed; 'but that the reply to the Saud.i reservation should 'be most carefully considered so as to make it clear (a) that it is allowed to stand on record as a reservation and nothing more; (b) that His Majesty’s Government and the French Government do not accept the claims implied in the reservation; and (c) that if the Saudi Government should at any time reopen the question of the status and the character of the line, they would be on their side entirely free to contest tnese Saudi claims. 9. I am sending copies of this despatch and enclosures to His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan and to His Majesty’s Consul General at Beirut. I have, etc., (Signed) Andrew Ryan.Translation I. J 11/1/7. Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mecca. 13th Shawal 1353. 18th January 1935. Your Excellency, The great importance which the question of the repair of the Hejaz Railway Line and the resumption of train services thereon to Medina holds in the eyes of the Moslem world and in the eyes of the Governments through whose territories the line passes, and more especially in the eyes of the Government of His Majesty the King, is not unknown. Nor is it unknown that the question of the repair of tne part of the line located within the dominions of His Majesty tne King and its reopening has already 'been discussed. For this purpose the Conference of Haifa was held and was attended hy representatives of the Governments concerned; hut the divergence of their views on political matters relating to the unity, status and the future of the privileges conferred on the line, prevented their reaching a satisfactory result. The line has since that time remained in its ruined state and no benefit could he derived from it, neither could the objects for which it was originally established be realised. My Government had suggested in the correspondence exchanged between them and the British and French Governments immediately after the break-up of the Haifa Conference His Excellency H.B.M’s Minister at Jedda.Conference, ending with Note No•19/7/31 dated 15th Shawwal 1347 (16th March 1929), that the conference should he resumed hy plenipotentiaries deputed hy the Governments concerned and empowered to discuss and settle the question of the line from its establishment and not limited, as was the case in the Conference of Haifa, to the consideration of the technical part relating to the repair of the line, the resumption of train services and the details that come under the same head. The British and the French Governments, however, did not agree to that suggestion and insisted upon the point that any discussions my Government desire to enter into regarding the Hejaz Railway should be based on the Lausanne Declaration of the 27th January 1923. The result of the adherence of each party to its point of view was that the question has till recently been relegated to one side. My Government have already explained their definite attitude regarding the said Lausanne Declaration, but, being desirous that their persistence in this attitude of theirs should not be an obstacle in the way of the repair of the line and the resumption of train services and being convinced of the great advantage which will be enjoyed by pilgrims generally and in particular by the countries through vrtiich the line runs, have found it better to modify their former attitude and to accept an intermediate solution in order to reconcile the view-points of all concerned, and have decided to agree to the separation of political matters relating to the line, namely its ownership, unity, privileges and the like, from the technical matters relating to the repair of the line and the resumption of services. In accordance with the readiness shown by the British and French Governments by the oral communications conveyed by Your Excellency, to agree to a renewal of discussions on technicaltechnical matters, as had already been decided before the Conference of Haifa was held, the Government of His Majesty the Ming desire to make the following reservation in regard to other than technical questions;- 'The Government of His Majesty the King reserve their full rights in the matters relating to the ownership, unity and privileges etc. of the line and (their right) to raise these questions at a suitable time with the authorities concerned and agree now to the holding- of a conference of which the time and place will be fixed for the discussion of the technical matters upon which depend the repair of the line and the resumption of train services'. 1 should be very grateful if Your Excellency would be good enough to communicate this to the British and French Governments and to inform me in due course of the place and time which they suggest for holding this conference, in order that the Government of His Majesty the King may tame the necessary steps for their participation therein. I have the honour to add that a true copy of this has been sent to-day to your French colleague and I taxe this opportunity to offer my best compliments and highest respects. (Signed) FBYHAL.

This council will include four Moslem members appointed respectively by Syria, Palestine, Trans;)ordania and the Hejaz and will itself choose its president and two other members amongst the nationals of other Moslem countries interested in the pilgrimage. It will sit at Medina. 'The recommendations of this council must not be contrary to the provisions of the international sanitary conventions.

Proposed conference concerning the Hejaz Railway). Unless you see objection please reply orally to Saudi government on the following lines. 2. His Majesty’s Government for their part see no objection to the Saudi government putting forward to His Majesty’s Government and to the French government a proposal for a conference. His Majesty’s Government will be prepared,if such a proposal is put forward, to consider it in consultation with the French government, provided it is clearly understood that any discussion resulting from the proposal (a.) would be conducted on the basis of the Lausanne Declaration, and (b) would be confined to technical questions as at the Haifa Conference, if the Saudi government wish to make a reservation regarding the ownership or character of the railway they must do so in the corresporhsnoG leading up to the conference and not during the conference itself. You may also if you think it desirable make it clear to the Saudi government that if the proposal is put forward and agreed to in principle, His Majesty’s Government and the French government will probably consider it necessary, as suggested by the French government, to make sure that the precise agenda, is agreed upon in advance. * Addressed to Jedda, repeated to Transjordan No.75.Draft Paper. Department. The next subject which came up for discussion was the Hejaz Railway. Fuad Bey enquired the views of His Majesty’s Government on the proposal which he had made to Sir A. Ryan at Jedda for the calling of a technical conference to discuss the reconditioning of the railway. It was explained that at first sight His Majesty’s Government had no objection to the Saudi proposal, but that it had, of course, been necessary to consult the French Government, and that it was still necessary to consult the Transjordan authorities. There seemed likely to be no difficulty so far as the French Government were concerned, and although, pending the receipt of the views of the Transjordan authorities, it was still impossible for His Majesty’s Government to make a definite statement on this point, it did not seem likely that there would be any objection to the present limited proposals of the Saudi Government. It should be clearly understood, however, that His Majesty’s Government could not depart from the attitude they had always taken up on this subject, i.e., that such wider issues as that of the ownership of the railway could not be brought into the discussion. The proposed conference could, therefore, only be agreed to on the clear understanding that it should confine itself to technical and practical points. 2800 5000 5 34 2( 7^ Ojif /*-?. -ro7i'» Jf / )) Hejaz Railway.

In the anticipation that Hie Majesty’s Government toay desire to learn ay views on the proposal of the Saudi Government that the question of reconditioning this railway should be reopened I have consulted my advisers. The General Manager, Palestine Railways, informs me that the reconditioning of the derelict portion of the Hejaz Railway and the resumption of train services with the i:eja* ehoulrf be of considerable advantage to the Railway. The British Resident, Amman, advisee that when the Railway was working prior to the War it served as a means of exporting large quantities of grain from Trans-Jordan to the Hejaz: consequently its reopening would benefit Trans-Jordan from this point of view as well as on account of the pilgrim traffic. 3. .12 JUL Jd4 The Right Honourable Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, G.D.S.,M.p., etc., etc. Hie Majesty's Principal Secretary*of State for the colonies.

Please see Foreign Office letter of P5th June below to the Colonial Office from which it will be seen that the Saudi Government have ag;~in raised^the question of the Hedjaz hil.. j.y /lit JeddahjT In the view of His ISajesty's Government and the French Government the status of the Hedjaz Railway is governed by the declaration made by the two mandatory powers at the Lausanne Conference in iyP3,in which they recognised the religious character of the Hedjaz Railway, and with a view to ensuring the proper working of the line and facilities for the transport of pilgrims, declared that they were ready to accept the constitution of an Advisory Council to make recommendations to the management of the different sectionsof the line lying in Syria, Palestine, Trans jordan and the Hedjaz. Largely in.order to please Muslim world opinion Ihn Saud has in the past expressed himself as desirous of entering into negotiations for the reopening of the line for pilgrim traffic, 'but he wished first of all to discuss the question of the ownership and unity of the Railway, the whole of which he claimed for the Hedjaz in 1926 on behalf of the Muslim world. Per fear of offending Muslim opinion Ibn Saud has been unable to accept the Anglo-French declaration which deals wdth the Rail., ay on the basis of the management of the different sections by separate administrations in Syria, Palestine, Trans-Jordan and the Hedjaz. The view of His Majesty’s Government is that the Railway is not a ¥aqf or Muslim religious trust, but the Colonial Office have been reluctant to make an open declaration to this effect for fear of mobilizing Muslim opinion against His Majesty’s Government, and this Office lias also been afraid of the effect of such a declaration upon Muslim opinion in India sire e,although the Hedjaz Railway was built by the Turks primarily for strategic reasons, ^bout a quarter of the cost of construction was defrayed out of the voluntary contributions of pious Muslim's including Indian Muslims, and there is a wide-spread belief in Muslim circles that the Rail, ay is in fact a religious foundation. In this connection please see the submission at P. His Majesty’s Government have in the past been prepared to enter into negotiations wibh the oaudi Government regarding the question of the reopening of the line and the repair of the section lying in the Hedjaz, but only on the condition that the discussions were of a purely technical nature, the question 01 ov.nership being completely excluded from their scope.Minute Paper.

There has bssn no important development in connexion with the Hejas Hallway as between His Majesty’s Gover aent and the Hejaai Government since the attached memorandum was written;- On February 6 th 1921 the Acting Kejsz Nejd secretary for Foreign Affairs expressed a wish in very general terms to discuss the matter at some later date with Sir A« *yan. Upon this steps were taken to ascertain privately whether I bn Baud's personal attitude had changed since 19&amp;6, when he made his secret communication disclaiming any desire to pursue the matter seriously. The King explained in a reply sent through his Ministry of Foreign Affairs last June that, he had merely wished to postpone the question, not to disregard or renounce Islamic rights in the Hailway. His language foreshadowed a reopening of the question by his Government, but they have not in fact reverted to it since. The question of what our attitude should be, if the question is reopened, has been considered in consultation with the India Office and Colonial Office; H.Mtlmbassy at Angora have also been consulted as to the validity of the contention, which has been much relied on by the iiejazi Government and other exponents of the Moslem claim, that the Hallway Is a Wakf, i.e. property expressly dedicated to religious purposes* As a result it appears that, while there was a religious motive for the construction of the Hallway, there is nothing to show that it was ever constituted a Wakf. It is submitted that, if and when a re-statement of H«M*Government's attitude on this subject to the Hejaz-HejdSOYernnmnt 1 * nco#»«ary # ii # u*aoY«rnsMmt •hauid maintain the attitude taken up at Lauaanne. and ehouXd exprees readlnese to arrange for a conference, on the conditions of that held at Haifa in 19E8i i.e, that diacuaaion ahould be confined to purely technical flotations and that the question of the owner eh Ip of the Hallway should not be raised. But before making such a reply, we should consult the French Gower time nt, with whom we have in the past invariably acted la collaboration on this question. Should it be raised by the Hejaa-Nejd Mission therefore, it would be beet to defer a definite answer.

I have no knowledge of any such discussions, nor has i’ebb, and it appears that the report was a complete fabrication, at least in so far as concerns Palestine or His Majesty’s Government. As regards the French Government, you probably know that Fuad Haasa spent some weeks in Syria on leave after the conclusion of the Jerusalem negotiations for the frans-Jordan-Saudi Treaty and it is possible that while there he endeavoured to sound the Syrian authorities on the subject.

U~ T^-'t &gt;,n T rC ~ 3 •&gt; y Cb? il/( They informed the Courts in this sense in Nov.1930 hut this only came to the notice of the Mandatory authorities last year. The Hejaz railway was built by Sultan Abdul Haaid in order to strengthen his hold over the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire by providing rapid means of communication. It was therefore primarily a strategic railway but about a quarter of the cost of construction was defrayed out of the voluntary contributions of pious Moslems, including Indian Moslems, subscribed in response to Abdul Hamid* s appeal for funds for his 'Pilgrim' railway. The view of His Majesty’s Government is that the railway is not a Waqf, but at the Lausanne Conference in 1923 the Mandatory Powers, Great B ritain and Prance, declared in r espect of those portions of the railway running through Syria, Palestine and Trans-Jordan that they recognised the religious character of the railway and with a view to ensuring the proper working of the line and facilities for transport of pilgrims agreed to the constitution of an Advisory Council to make recommendat ions to the managements of the different sections of t he line. (A note on the religious character of the Hejaz railway by His Majesty’s Consul, Damascus is flagged 'D') t The Advisory Council has not yet been formed and l meanwhile the line is held *n trust by the Mandatory Powers, the section lying in territories under British Mandate being administered by the Palestine Railways but the accounts of revenue and expenditure being kept separate. x The Trans-Jordan Government have recently taken up the attitude that the Hejaz railway is a department of the local Government, apparently on the ground that it is a waqf, in spite of the contrary opinion of their Judicial Adviser though they have not as yet contested the administration of the line by the Palestine/ 1212 5000 0/32^ f Palestine authorities. The Judicial Adviser^ opinion is at pp*4-6 of the enclosures to the Colonial Office letter. The British Resident is entirely opposed for practical reasons to permitting the Trans-Jordan Government to obtain any control over the section of the railway lying in Trans-Jordan and this view is supported by the High Commissioner who instructed the Resident last March to inform the Trans-Jordan Government that the High C©mmi8sioner ,, could not agree to an organization which His Majesty’s Government hold £n trust being treated in &gt; Trans-Jordan as a department of the local Government and that for the purposes of Articles IV, V and IX of the Trans-Jordan Agreement, the Hejaz Railway must be regarded as a foreign concernIt is presumed that the British Resident conveyed this advice to the Trans- Jordan Government. The Colonial Office considered the question of following this ,up by a declaration to the Trans-Jordan Government that in the view of His Majesty’s Government the Hejaz Railway cannot be regarded as Waqf property but the High Commissioner anticipates that such a declaration would raise a storm of indignation from Moslems in Palestine, all of whom look upon the railway as a Waqf, and would play into the hands of the Istiqlal Party. There can be little doubt that it would cause a similarly unfortunate impression in India and in other Moslem +■ countries. In these circumstances the Colonial Office consider it undesirable to make any further statement now to the Trans-Jordan Government on the subject and ask us whether we concur in this view. A draft letter to the Colonial Office concurring is submitted. »- ^ ' 2. +' r. p h V - $ r l 0~ •r . s* A ^ ’ C. ^ d r,^i 1 ar N FR 3 f ^ xa + Co ^ i i 6-^ T -1 ! 11 Jr r,v ~ II t*; m. 1 A MaL rr iP.Z.3207/33 Draft Paper. political Department.

On receipt of that despatch a telegram, of which a copy is enclosed, was sent to the High i Commissioner informing him that the Secretary of State had under consideration the question of making clear to the Trcns-Jordan Government that, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, the Hejaz Railway cannot be regarded as Wa‘qf property. 3. THE ITHDER SECRETARY OF STATE, IEDIA OFFICE.X. 5. A copy of e subsequent despatch from the High Commissioner dated the 6th May, enclosing correspondence with His Majesty’s Ambassador at Baghdad, is also enclosed. From this it will be seen that the High Commissioner anticipates that there will be considerable difficulty if an announcement is made by His Majesty’s Government that the Hejaz Railway is no longer to b w regarded as Waqf property. 4. In £ letter sent by the Hi^h Commissioner to the Secretary of State by the same mail as the t despatch of the 6th May, he writes es follows:- ’’During a farewell interview with me, _ the Mufti raised the question of the Hedjaz Railway. I refused to be drawn, but there is no doubt that whatever the legal rights may &lt; « be, every Moslem in this country, and I believe many in India, looks upon the Hedjaz Railway as Wakf property.

Your Excellency, I hare the honour to submit, for your consideration, the following question which has arisen in connection with that section of the Hedjaz Railway which lies in Trans-Jordan territory. 2. Some months ago a certain person sought to bring an action against the representative at Amman of the Hedjaz Railway and so revealed the fact that the Courts had been informed, in November, 1930, by the Trans-Jordan Government that the Hedjaz Railway should be considered as an official Department belonging to the Trana-Jordan Government. This statement, of which I was unaware until the present case arose, conflicted with an opinion expressed in August, 1930, by C.R.W. Seton, Judicial Adviser to the Trans-Jordan Government at that time, to the effect that as His Majesty’s Government had retained possession of the Hedjaz Railway, the organisation should be treated as a foreign concern. 3. On the 16th of July, 1932, I drew the attention of the Trans-Jordan Government to the evident conflict of opinion and asked them to reconsider the question in consultation with the present Judicial Adviser. The Judicial Adviser drew up an opinion, of which I enclose a copy, and submitted it to the Trans- Jordan Government but the Executive Council of the Trans-Jordan. His Excellency The High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan, JERUSALEM.Trans-Jordan Government confirmed the previous attitude of the Government hy a decision dated the 10 th December, 1932, of which I attach a translation. 4. The Judicial Adviser does not consider the argument of the Trans-Jordan Government in support of their decision to be legally valid and I am, moreover, entirely opposed from practical administrative considerations to permitting the Trans-Jordan Government to obtain any control over the section of the Hedjaz Railway lying in Trans-Jordan, The Palestine Railways have been entrusted by His Majesty's Government with the administration of the whole of the Hedjaz Railway lying in territories under British Mandate and any arrangement in Trans-Jordan in the nature of dual control could only lead to confusion, 5, As Z am unable to induce the Trans-Jordan Government to change their decision and as they disregard the opinion of their own Judicial Adviser, I cofasider that some formal communication should be made to them on the subject, I would suggest confining the communication to a statement that His Majesty's Government cannot agree to an organisation which they hold on trust being treated in Trans-Jordan as a Department of the Local Government and that, for the purposes of Article IX of the Trans-Jordan Agreement, the Hedjaz Railway must be regarded as a foreign concern, X should be glad to receive Your Excellency's Instructions on the matter, I have, etc., (iigd.) CJiDJ 1 . COX. BRITISH RESIDENT.It is not necessary to give an account of the history of the constitution of the Hejaz Hallway which was built before the War. The fate of all property, rights and interests taken over by the secessionary States formerly forming part of the Ottoman empire was dealt with by the Treaty of Lausanne, which was signed on the 24th of July, 1923, and came into force on the 6 th of August, 1924. The fate of the Hejaz Railway was not finally determined by the Treaty, but Great Britain and France made a joint statement before the financial and economic Commission at the Lausanne Conference on the 27th of January, 1923. This statement represents the attitude and Intentions of the Mandatory Powers, Great Britain and Prance, in respect to those portions of the Hejaz Railway running through Jyria, Palestine and Transjordan respectively. In this declaration the two Mandatory Powers stated that they recognized the reli^ous character of the Hejaz Hallway (to which large aums of money had been contributed w^Wjtqf by Muslims,) and with a view to ensuring the maintenance and proper working of the line and the improvement of the conditions of tranax^ort of pilgrims agreed to the constitution of an advisory Council, the functions of which would be to communicate to the Managements of the different sections of the line any recommendations they might have to make. Mo objection was taken at the Conference to this declaration of intention by any other members of the Conference and the declaration is therefore to be consi deredconsidered effective and an integral part of tiie Peace Settlement. The Council referred to in the declaration! however, has not yet been formed. Its formation seems to me clearly to he the first step towards any definite settlement of the future status of the Hejaz Railway, in the ahoenej of any other arrange ment; and no such arrangement has been made up to date. It is therefore clear that the only possible result is that the two Mandatory Powers remain responsible meanwhile for the proper working and maintenance of the line, holding it on trust for those persona, juridical or otherwise, who may eventually be held to be entitled to maintain and administer the line. This view,which is the view of Uis Majesty 1 s Government, was communicated to His Highness the Amir in a letter dated the 21st of April, 1924 signed by His Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine in which the following paragraph occurs ‘‘His Majesty’s Government is responsible for all those portions of the Hej&amp;z Railway which run through the territories for which Great Britain has taken responsibility under the Mandate and it is there fore necessary to secure that this Hallway is properly administered until such time as a general arrangement is arrived at, in accordance with the declaration made by His Majesty’s Government on this subject 11 . This question was again dealt with by His Excellency the British Resident in a letter dated the 11th of January, 1950 addressed to His Highness the Amir. In this letter the British Resident stated that: 'The sections of the Hejaz Railway lying within thethe Mandated areas of Palestine and Transjordan are held on trust ‘by His Majesty 1 s Government pending a final decision as to the proprietorship and administra tion of the whole line. His Majesty*s Government in turn decided that the Palestine and Transjordan sections should he administered hy the General Manager of the Palestine Railways although the accounts of revenue and expenditure on the Hejaz Railway are separated from those of the Palestine Railways, The management of the section lying in Transjordan is, therefore, identical with that of the sedtion lying in Palestine •' The British Resident concluded hy stating that the attitude of the Mandatory Power continues to he that indicated to His Highness the Amir in Kis Excellency the High Commissioner for Palestine’s letter dated the 23rd of April, 1924, I am therefore of the opinion that since no decision has been taken regarding the future status of the Hejaz Railway the Mandatory Power can hold no other view than that the Railway is held and administered hy it on trust pending a settlement as to .vho ia finally entitled permanently to hold and administer the line. The decision of the Council of Ministers is entirely arbitrary and in clear conflict with the expressed intentions of the Mandatory Power, I am therefore of the opinion that the decision is illegal and should immediately he cancelled, I invite your attention in this connection to the very clear terms of Articles 4 and 17 ofthe Agree ment concluded between Great Britain and Transjordan on the 20th of February, 1928, (Sgd.) JUDICIAL ADVIJSSH.(2) TRASXAXXOa. fleclaion ifo. 427. 10th December, 1932• His Excellency the British Resident’s letter Ho. 3356 of the 16th July, 1932, stated that the Hedj&amp;z Railway section in Transjordan is held on trust by His Majesty's Government pending &amp; final decision as to the administration of the whole line and that the management of this section is vested in the Manager of the Palestine Railways in his capacity as Agent of His H*j ea tytB Government and the Railway must therefore be regarded as a foreign concern. The Decision of the Executive Council Issued on the 23rd November, 1930, stating that the Hedjas Railway Administration in Amman is considered an official Department of the Trans-Jordan Government having an independent budget was perused and the comments of the Judicial Adviser stating that said Decision should be considered irregular was also perused and after discussing the matter it approved that: (1) The Ottoman Government had on the 29*12.1329 (1913) Issued a provisional Law sanctioned by both of Houses ”Ayan” and N Mabouth&amp;n” by a final law issued on the 19th of July, 1330 (1914) provision to detach the General Administration of the Hedjaz Railway from the Grand Vesir's Office and to attach same to the Ministry of Wakfs and this Law is one of the Laws *hich are still in force in Trans-Jordan.(2) The declaration issued by both Great Britain and France admits the religious status which the htdj&amp;z Railway has and this supports the provisions of the aforementioned Law* (3) The Hedjaz Railway Section in Trans-Jordan if considered by conclusion and by agreement with the legitimate parties entitled to the Estates of the Ottoman iimpire, there should be no remonstrance in considering its administration as one of the official Departments of the Trans-Jordan Government, (4) If this section is to be considered by the conclusion that it is a ”Wakf' (Endowment) then the Administration of Islamic Wakfa are considered, under the pro/isions ofthe Organic Law, to be as one of the Governments Departments. (5) That leaving the line to be worked by the Palestine Administration on trust does not prevent the above observations from being considered. Therefore the Trans-Jordan Government is unable to admit that the Administration of the Hedjaz Railway section in Trans-Jordan is a foreign concern.

It can only be sa’d that the examination of ^the ouestion by 91s Majesty’s Oowe nment In con- w Bultation with the Embassy in ^irkev in 1°31 ^is- ’*closed no evidence whatsoever th«t the railway v had ev&gt; r been constituted a aof. T t i° true 'that in August 1914 the Ottoman Government rroarer 'a law transferring Its administration to the 'Ministry '’anfs, but such an sdoinis+retive 'change could not of itself have altered the 'character of the railway. ^he constitut'on of a '’'aof is essentially « proceeding wh^oh reouires ”an express act having that for Its object and 'executed 1 n accordance with the provisions of a 'rigorous system o'* religious law .

This correspondence was ignored (see your official letter Do* JS.1886/87/65 of the 26th April cuid our letter Do. 98036/32 of the 27th nay). In any case it merely recorded a protest and did not call for any reply. however, is not quite on all fours with the previous communication, since, as you will observe, the You will recall that the executive Committee The letter regarding the Hejas railway, x C.J.A.

It is not unlikely that ve shall get other similar commonlentions in the future, e«g. about ^ionifti in Palestine, and any ction we may take in the snresont ease may well be cited as a precedent* Our view is that His Majesty’s Government is under ne obligation to take any notice of resolutions passed by the Congress and communicated to us by the Executive Cosanittee at the instigation of the Congress* The Congrees was a self-appointed body without any official standing, and, while Hia Majesty’s Government raised no objection to their meetings, they deliberately abstained from giving them &amp;ny formal recognition* If we now reply to this or any future similar communication, it might encourage the Executive Committee and the Congress to argue that they possess some sort of recognised status* As you know, the question of the Government** attitude towards a further meeting of the Congress ha* recentlyrecently received careful coneideraticn. The conclusion reached was that it vaa not desirable to take a decision at this rta&amp;e, but that we should watch developments, and in the event of another meeting of the Congress being called take such action as might seem desirable In the light of the circumstances then obtaining* In this connection a reference is invited to your official letter ho«£.250fi/ 87/65 of the 4th June and the connected correspond once* In our view this is an additional reason for ignoring any communication received from the Executive Committee, since even a reply to the effect that his Majesty 9 s Government is unable to take any action in regard to this resolution might lead the Cferallttee to infer that they had some sort of recognised status and might conceivably prejudics our position if it is eventually desired to prohibit further meetings of the Congress, i'roa every point of view, therefore, we think that this, and any further communication from the Executive Committee, should be ignored.

At the sarce time we think it would be desirable to let them know what is happening and we suggest that they might be informed serai-officially that we hare received this letter and that we propose to ignore it, so that they can take * similar line should the Committee communicate with them direct on the subject of the Hejaz railway.

A decree No.IX)44 bis of he 19th July 1936 reorganised .he whole of the departraonts supervising he various concessions granted by the Ottoman Government or the French M ndate and constituted the present Service de Control©, hlch is immediately attached to the High Commission through the Financial Adviser. At he suggestion of this Department, the convention of February 19i^4 w s drawn up, entrusting he Societe D.H.r. ?;ith the management of the He^az Railway. Three decrees were promulgated (Nos. £466 , 466 and i 467 of the t£nd February, 1924)• the first constituting a commission to Administer the properties end endowments of the railway, the second bringing into force a convention signed the 6'me day handing over the management of the line to the Societe D.H.

It may the ret ore be ar ued that that sum constitutes a reasonable n^mun ration for their a nagement of tlie line. In point of fact the coefficient F hrs never fallen below 400, OCX) francs, although in the years 1928 and 1930 profits have been so small that the lion’s share of nett revenue has gone to the D.H.P, On the other hand he sum of the first four terns has frequently exceeded 600,000 francs, in fact, he sum of the first t o terms alone exceeds it In 1926,1927, 1928,1929 and 1930. In 1928 and 1930 some attempt at 'revision' cnn be traced, b^t in at least three years (1926-1927) the • has made very large payments to Itself over and above the Fra. 600 ,X)o mark, and during the first seven years of its administration has received an avera e of over Prs. 1,400 ,000, or a clear annual profit of eight hundred thousand francs. lEhe year 1931 h f e shown a nett income of Pr8.28,&lt; 00 only, the 'coefficient d*exploitation' rising to 99.67; . the D.H.P. is however protected by the fomula and claims half a million francs, to which the Hejaz Railway is called upon to contribute from its other sources of revenue 474,600 fr; ncs. There are thus reasonable grounds for criticism of an agreement, by the terms of which the D.K. • takes complete charge of a competing railway system, is guaranteed against any loae but allowed to make a profit, and hirnishes no accounts to anyone except the French High Commies* n, with whom The convention was concluded. The Ainct ons of the local Commission aduiinistexdng the waqfs are confined to acknowledging receipt of the sum whichwhich the High Comraifis^on each year cl? cea to? ite credit at the Bftn H ue de Syrie.

The French Company refusln an offer of about £S6C',000, a new line to Deras was buUt and opened in 1903. Railhead reached Zerqa, SOS kilometres from Damascus, in 190?, Oat ran©, 3t)6 kilometres, in 1903, Ma’an, 469 kilometres, in 1904, Dhat el Ha33, 610 kilometres, in 1906, el Ala, 993 kilometres, in 1907 and Medina, 1,5130 kilometres in 1908. The continuation of the line to Mekka was prevented by the Bani Harb, at the Instigation of the Sheriff. The Deraa-Haifa section was completed in 1906, an 'to lish concern vtoieh had constructed a few miles at the Haifa and being bought out for about £60,(XX). I am informed that litigation in this resoeet If still pending.

In April 1924 Mr.Philby, at that time Chief British Representative at Amman, presumably ineoired by the Anglo-French declaration of January r7th, 19i3, handed over the Aiman-Ma*an section to Amir All, President of the Council of the Ma'an-Mcdina aeetion. This action was not authorised by Hie Majesty’ a Government. The whale of the Hejaz Railway seems to have been patched no at this time and rendered available for # oilgrira traffic. The Palestine Report for IQ^ record* that four thousand Pilgrims travelled on the northern Trans-Jordan section, and a profit was made of i,500 gyotlam pounds, s against prcprious dead loss* I am informed by Jemil bey, now Inspector o ' the D.H. r*, that one Shawky bey exploited the Ma f an-Medina sect! n about that time and made a profit of 60 , )00 Turkish gold pounds on behalf of King Hussein. Shawky bey hired locomotives and tolling stock 1 rora the Syrian section, of which two engines and some trucks have never been relumed. Since 1924 the Syrian section has been managed by he Societe D.H.P* , the Trans-Jordan by the Palestine Railways, while the Southern section has ceased to function. In 1928 an attempt was made to recondition the whole line and make it **valiable for pilgrim traffictraffic. The British and French GoTemrnents invited Ihn Sa*ud to send renresen stives to discuss the technical ornblema and a Conference met at Haifa on August 6th,1988. Dr.Damlu^i acting for Ibn Sa'ud then stated that before anything else could be diecusaed the question of t}\e ownership and unity of the railway must be considered. These subjects being explicitly excluded by the terms of the invitation the Conference was adjourned and h^s not since reassembled.

The contention freouently advanced that the Hejaz Railway is &gt;urely a Moslem pious foundation and that its cost was defrayed by the voluntary subscriptions of Moslems thr ughout the world, is not entirely in accordance with be facts. The line was built by Abdul H mid in order to strengthen his hold on the rab provinces by providing rapid lines of communication situated entirely in Ottoman territory. The primary object of his anneal, as Caliph, to the faithful for subscriptions for his ’’Pilgrim Railway”, was to parry the opposi tion of the Arab tribes, against whom the enterprise was really directed* the contribution of Islam, though welcome enough, were a secondary considerationNot all subscriptions were voluntary.

Mr.i irie-Oordon, probably drawing his information from Auler P aha’s^Hedschasbahn' assesses voluntary contributions at about £1 9 K0 9 s 00 and the levies on Ottoman officers and civil servants at £250,000. The cost of the railway was about £4,000,000. v The Hejaz Railway was not described as a pious foundation so far as I can ascertain, before the summer of 1918: it would appear that some declaration that it w'as a universal Moslem waqf wasmade hen It was annarent that the Ottoman Kmnire as comoletely defeated* The only reference to the Hejaz Railway In the Records of Proceedin s of the Lnusanne Confer nc© occurs in a Turkish counter-draft regarding property, rights and interests handed In on January 7th, 1923 (Anne: C to No. 38, p. 662; s in the second paragraph of Article 3 to the Hejaz R^lway is Boeclfically declar 'd to belong to the Turkish Civil List and the Crown.

The principal evidence of the religious character of the railway is thus furnished by the /nglo-French declaration at t ussnne. British Consulate, (sa.; E.C.HOLE, H.M. Consul. a. Oamaacus, Sy ri a. January 18th, 1932# Report of the Defence Committee for the Hedjazian Railway. The Ottoman Government was well cognisant of the intolerable hardships which Moslems throughout the world had to contend with on setting out upon their religious pilgrimages, on camels, through arid wastes, from their various places of residence scattered all over the globe, ^ple incentive was thus given for the inauguration of a line which should bring the holy city of Mecca within reach of pilgrims living in distant places. There were two principd reasons for which this scheme has ripened into reality. Turkish Authorities, under Sultan Abdul Hameed, to shorten the journeys to and from Mecca, to mitigate the hardships attendant upon distant journeys and to bring the places of worship within comparatively easy reach of old men and women, children and others suffering from infirmities of the body. Secondly, religious motives were not less instrumental in hastening the accomplishment of the project. of this enterprise being such as no single individual or even a single State could make available, it was decided to appeal to Moslems all over the world with a view to inducing them to lend their support for the financing of this huge project. People were thus made to subscribe to a fund specially raised for this purpose and gifts consisting in money and in kind were gratefully accepted. The names of the benefactors were published in local and foreign papers and subscribers were rewarded with medals which bore an appropriate inscription designating, the object for which they were awarded. The also found inadequate the Turkish Government issued Hejazian scheme with a view to meeting a long felt need for a Railway Emphatic representations had been made to the The amount of the funds requisite for the completionRailway revenue stamps with instructions that these stamps should be affixed on documents such as receipts, petitions, etc. and the revenue derivable therefrom should be appropriated to the above mentioned project. The validity of these stamps extended up to the year 1923. Before the World War representatives of foreign nations m Turkey protested against the use of these stamps on documents affecting foreigners and the principal reason urged against the applicability of these stamps to foreign documents was that these stamps had been introduced for religious purposes. It was therefore decreed that the use of these stamps on documents affecting foreigners should be optional and not obligatory. The Hejazian Railway is Moslem Waqf pure and simple and the net proceeds of the Railway are spent on repairs and improvements and fcr the comfort and convenience of pilgrims. Property which is subject to Waqf is administered for the benefit of the public and is inalienable and is incapable of being conveyed by way of gift and every Moslem wherever he may be resident, is entitled to take part in its administration and may assert his rights in relation thereto. These cardinal rules affecting the Waqf are invested with the sanctity and inviolability of an enacted Statute. When, in 1914, the Ottoman Government obtained a loan from the French Government, the latter stipulated that, as security for the loan, the Hejazian Railway should be given over to them as a pledge. The Ottoman Government refused to give their consent to this stipulation on the plea that the Hejazian Railway was Moslem Waqf and did not admit of being conveyed by way of pledge. The Hejazian Railway and its ramifications in Palestine and elsewhere were, during the Great War, impressed for military purposes but on the termination of the War and the restoration of the status quo, the former administrationof the Railway took over its management and control but the railroads, in Palestine, which form part of the Hejazian Railway are still under the control of the Palestine Railways in violation of the terms of International Laws and the recently enacted Treaties, e.g. the Treaty of Lausanne. Part of the railroads in Palestine were constructed before the War and part of them during the Great War. Part of the Railway line in Palestine has been dis mantled and part of the material was sold by public auction at ridiculously low prices while another part was consigned to the Railway Authorities in Damascus with a view to enabling them to extend their railroads within their territory. An appreciable part of the railway material was left to the mercy of the disintegrating processes of the weather while the Holy City is in great need of having its railway line improved upon and maintained in a satisfactory state of repair. It may be concretely exemplified by figures that the ramifications, within Palestine and S^na, of the Hejazian Railway are as essential to the maintenance of a regular traffic, as the normal gauge Railway in these territories. As regards the part of the Railway which lies within byrian territory it may be added that there were workshops in Kadam Station for the repair of engines, carriages and other rolling stock and that these workshops were provided with up- to-oate machinery but the Syrian Railway Authorities laid hands on these workshops and disposed of the outfit and machinery arbitrarily and in a most highhanded manner. Pursuant to an agreement entered into with the French High Commissioner for Syria, the Railway Company at Damascus took over the administration and control of the Hejazian Railway in Syrian territory. There was a general outcry in all Moslem countries against this usurpation of Moslem rights and shops were closed in Damascus for three days. Protests were sent to the League of Nations but no redress was given. An examination/(0 examination of the terms of the agreement and of the accounts of the Railway Company will show to what extent the income and has been reduced^he assets depreciated. The most noteworthy feature in the terms of the agreement concluded between the French Government and the Railway Company at Damascus is that concession is made to the Company to distribute more than 60% of the net income by way of dividend amongst its shareholders while an infinitesimal portion of the income is left for repairs. Part of the rolling stock of the normal gauge Railway line was sent to the Hejaz line workshop for repair in order to enable the Company to earn profit in respect of these repairs. Lest the manifestly illegal conduct of the Railway Administration should be exposed to public censure it was decided to re-engage 88 workers instead of the 75 workers who were dismissed on the reconstruction of the Company and who, at that time, were paid exorbitant gratuities which were charged on the funds of the Hejazian Railway. The cost of repair of carriages and other rolling stock, amounting to about 40,000 francs was charged on the savings of the former Hejazian Railway although these assets were taken over by the Railway Company at Damascus in good running condition. Recurrent expenses incidental to repairs, etc., ought therefore in all fairness to have been charged on the current income of the Company and not on the savings of the old Company which were specially reserved for constructing additional railroads. Before the reconstruction of the Hejazian Railway the Railway Company at Damascus obtained nine locomotives, fifty-three trucks and ei^it carriages from the Hejazian Railway on loan but failed to pay the charges which had become payable thereon. The Railway Administration sent the Damascus Company frequent reminders asking for payment of the arrears of the charges, but instead of obtaining satisfaction for what was ^ue tothem they received an official letter from theAuthorities at Beirut ordering them to supply the Railway Company with an additional number of carriages and other rolling stock free of charge although that Railway Company was at that time receiving ample consideration for their services from the Military Authorities at Beirut. In 1920 when the Military Authorities were obliged to apply armed fore* against the bandits which were operating in the Hauran territory, damage was done to some permanent structures of the Hejazian Railway. A Commission was detailed to make enquiries into the extent of the losses and the damage which was inflicted was estimated at 187,000 Syrian Pounds but the indemnity which was paid amounted to only SP. 37,000. Likewise tne Hejazian Revenue Stamps which were brought into use in aid of the Hejazian Railway were declared ineffective. It is astonishing that the Damascus Railway Company whose inefficiency and incompetence has been proved to demonstration, should not be deprived of its grant. Further proof of the maladministration of the Hejazian Railway is the fact that the shares of the Railways whose nominal value is 000 francs are now worth only 240 france. If it is considered that frequent misappropriations on the part of officials were brought to light it is little surprising that the value of the shares has thus depreciated. There are still many ruinous bridges and stations, especially in the southern part of the railroad which require only small outlay in order to keep them m a satisfactory state of repair but which, from the Great War onwards were left in tneir ruinous state and are thus a great danger to lives and property. (Sgd.) Amir Said * Abdul Kader al Jaza-i-ri.Extract from Police report on the General Islamic Congress held in Jerusalem 7th - 16th December, 1931. 9. Discussion on the Hedjaz railway line was accompanied by strong utterances, describing the action of Ins Majesty’s Government and France in administering the line as usurpation and robbery. Mention was made of the Moslem lives lost and of sums of money expended on its construction. Special stress was laid on the fact that the line was essentially a Moslem Wakf. Abdel Rahman Azzam, Sheikh Abdel Kader Muzghar and others were prominent in their speeches. 10. The report of the Committee was submitted by liinir Said Jazayerli, who heads the Damascus Committee, and by Ahmad Hilmi Pasha, the former Inspector. The report stresses the point that the line was originally Islamic Wakf and commended to the Congress that active steps should be taken to restore it to the Moslems and place it under the supervision of an absolutely Islamic Commission. 11. Various proposals were made by the speakers such as boycotting the line, boycotting the European Powers concerned economically and instituting legal proceedings before the International Hi^i Court of Justice. 12. Abdel Rahman Azzam delivered a speech, stating that the line was essentially an Islamic Wakf and constructed with Moslem funds. It was clear he said that the Moslems were deprived of it by force. The Congress should declare its resentment of this usurpation and take steps in order to provoke enthusiasm in the spirits of the Moslems. The Islamic Governments and the foreign Governments, which ruled Moslem subjects, all had duties in this regard. Every Moslem had a share in this line. It was the duty of the Governments which ruled Moslem subjects to defend the right of proprietorship of their subjects. The members of the Congress desired that the Congress should submit their resolutions to all Government, and if the League of Nations was found to be in a position tocause the restoration of the line, the Congress should open negotiations with the League; if necessary, should bring a case before the International High Court of Justice; and should give sufficient powers to the Committee appointed for the purpose. 13. Mohamed Ali el Taher supported the motion of Abdel Rahman Azzam. The report of the Hedjaz line Committee, he said, should mention the thousands of Islamic sacrifices. The League of Nations, the High Court of Justice and others should not be approached as they had no cogniance of Justice, unless it be guns and airships. The best means was to elect delegations to tour Loslem Countries and make the matter clear to them, on the basis of the reports of Said Jazayerli and . ^hmed Hilmi Pasha. Europe would not respond in any other way. 14. Taftazani said that the line was the backbone of the Islamic world and its revenue, therefore, belonged to Hedjaz, where the inspector concerned should be able to bring a case against this usurpation. Moslem Kings should start the movement in defence of their subjects’ rights and the King of Hedjaz should interest himself in his capacity as the supervisor of the line. 15. Abdel Kader Muzghar referred to the decision of the League of Nations to the effect that the line was an Islamic iVakf, saying that this decision was adopted when it was thought that the Moslems were strong, but these and their rulers and Governments neglected the matter; their neglect was exploited by the Foreigners. h e suggested the translation of the report to the Islamic languages most prevalent. The Congress held that it was the duty of England and France to hand over the line to an Islamic Committee; neither of these Powers could deny the decision of the League of Nations. This was an outrage on loslem rights. He suggested that a Committee should be appointed to approach these two Governments on the strength of the decision of the League of Nations, and failing a /''“N satisfaction/satifliaction within a period of 6 or 12 months, the two Governments should be boycotted economically. Colonization, said, was exploitation; the Moslems were the consumers and could dispense with the West. 16. Finally the following resolution was adopted:- After hearing the report of the Committee on the Hedjaz Railway and perusing the documents relating thereto, the Congress declares its resentment of the usurpation of Moslem property, which is essentially a Wakf. The Congress should approach Islamic and other Governments in this regard and should empower the Executive Conmittee to discuss other means for the recovery of this line.EGRET. tft-fo-'Xfj) $&lt;&gt; Eastern Department . - Proposed Congress at Mecca . With reference to paragraph (6) of CX/12051 of the 15th inst., we have received from a first hand source the following account of remarks which were made, towards the end of December, by Jemal Pasha el Ghazi, the Wahabi Minister of War, who was in Jerusalem during the Moslem Congress, in an unofficial capacity. Jemal Pasha said that Ibn Saud knew quite well that, in view of his Wahabist tenets, he would not be regarded by other t sects of Islam as a suitable candidate for the Caliphate. Ibn Saud had been mainly interested in the Moslem Congress from the point of viev; of the Hedjaz Railway, and he had hoped that the Congress would decide to entrust him w ith the control of the line on be half of the Moslem world. He was therefo~re extremely dissatisfied that the solution of this question had been delegated to an unim portant committee. As a result, Ibn Sa’ud had decided to support the attempt of the anti-Mufti faction to hold a rival Congress at Mecca during the coming pilgrimage. He could not take any official part in convening this Congress, for fear that his pres tige would be impaired in case of failure, but his agents in Pales tine were already co-operating with the anti-Mufti faction and had begun to disseminate propaganda in favour of this Congress. These latter were also in touch with an influential Indian Moslem named Sirdar Suleiman Kassem, a keen advocate of Moslem unity, who had been very dissatisfied with the conduct of the recent Con gress and had consented to assist in securing support for the pro posed Congress at Mecca. (2) Information obtained early this month from members of the anti-Mufti faction indicated that this faction was making strenuousr *5Z 2 strenuous efforts to bring about the convocation of this rival Congress at Mecca, and was particularly heartened by the support &lt;t was receiving from Ibn Sa f ud. It was hoped by this means to deal a strong blow to the Grand Mufti f s prestige. The anti- Mufti faction was laying great stress on the consideration that there would be complete freedom of speech at Mecca, and that no one would run any risk of deportation if he should speak his mind.

(E 5781/688/25) r wo.ai. A (28v9/2879/14) DAliAiiGU 3 Confidential. October 27th, 1931 My Lord, It will he remembered that in his despatch To No.39 of the 4th March 1924, Mr. dmart had occasion to initiate correspondence upon the taking over of the Syrian section of the Hedjaz Railway by the Conrpagnie Lamas-Hama et Rrolongements , and I now have the honour to inform you that this question, after a lapse of years, has again become the subject of popular demonstrati n at Damascus. 2. The immediate occasion of recrudescence of public feeling was the transfer of the main station and offices of the D.H.P. to that of the Hedjaz Railway. Taking into consideration that the former Company have always been regarded as uninvited guests, that their previous headquarters compared very unfavourably in appearance and facilities with the relatively imposing building they have now occupied, and, above all, that the rights of property - more particularly those vested in 'pious foundations' - are sacrosanct, it is not surprising that this rather tactless move v/as regarded as a further instance of flagrant usurpation. 3. On the 21st instant Emir Said Jazairly, whose activities as a leader of public movements are becoming His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State For Foreign Affairs, etc., etc., etc.■becoming increasingly conspicuous, called a protest meeting in the Central Mosque, which was very largely ^ attended. Thanks to the admirable precautions taken by the Public Security there were no demonstrations of violence, althou h, for a few hours, the bazaars were closed. 4. The Emir Said, who was accompanied by one Yehya Kazim Aboul Sharaf, an ex-Turkish officer, whose political activities are identified with the aspirations in Syria of the Hashimite dynasty, demanded, in his speech, that the whole of the Kedjaz railway should be handed over to an independent Moslem administration. He pointed out that as a result of mismanagement the line stopped at Maan, and that the pilgrim traffic and trade between the Hedjaz and Syria was completely dislocated. It will be observed, therefore, that he did not confine his grievances to the D.H.P. 5. I am not competent to express an opinion on the political aspect of this question as defined in the Anglo-French Declaration of Lausanne, but would venture to suggest that, in the light of the concluding sentence of paragraph 2 of Foreign Office despatch No.40, (E 2664/221/89) of the 3rd April, 1924, the economic grievances of the public may be worthy of consideration. 6. It would seem that the D.H.P., in assuming charge of the Syrian section of the Hedjaz railway, were not actuated entirely by altruistic motives, and, according to the last paragraph of Mr. Smart’s despatch • No.42 of the 5th March 192o, this fact was admitted by the Adviser of Public Works to the French High CommissionCommission. Even assuming that the profits are scrupulously returned to the public - and I have as yet no evidence that they are not - the fact of controlling a line which w s previously in competition cannot fail to he advantageous to the original scope of the company 1 s activities. In raising their freight rates, it is believed that they have diverted considerable traffic from the port of Haifa (which should normally have had a great future for imports for Damascus as well as for Arabia) to that of Beirut. In this connection, it would be well to remember that the latter port and the D.H.P. function under the common auspices of the Regie G-enerale des Chemins de Fer. 8. Now, supposing my thesis be correct, it follows that the concession to the D.Ii.P. v/hich has resulted in a gain to French private enterprise has had the incidental effect of restricting the receipts of the Palestine Railways to the detriment of a state-owned concern. 9. And, assuming that the Palestine Railways have not been in a position to 'contribute their quota to the upkeep of the whole of the line, it is possible that His Majesty 1 s Government may lay themselves open to invidious criticism on the part of the Moslem world. 10. Without deviating from the strictly economic, I would elaborate the Emir T s suggestion that the termination of the line at Maan had diverted considerable prosperity - in the shape of trade and pilgrims - from Damascus to other channels. Realising as they do that unless the line to Medina is completed, the projected road from f Iraq toto Mecca would spell the doom of a profitable source of income, agitators are only too ready to exploit the religious ideals of the man in the street for the purposes of pecuniary advantage both public and personal. 11. I am sending copies of this despatch direct to His Majesty’s High Commissioners at Jerusalem and Baghdad, the British Resident at Amman, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Beirut, and His Majesty’s Consul at Aleppo.

We have, however, thought it advisable to ascertain the views of the local authorities in Palestine, and I am writing confidentially on the subject to Young, who will be the Officer Administering the Government of Palestine after Chancellor’s departure at the beginning of September. We will write to you again when we have received Young’s reply. Yours sincerely, (Signed) O.G.R.Williams. G. W. RENDEL, ESQ &gt;&lt;t Copy. 89153/31. SaCKiiT. r Dear Young, Will you please refer to our despatch Confidential of the 3rd of January, 1930 and previous correspondence on the subject of the Hejaz railway. far as the Hejaz Government is concerned the matter rests with their note of the 16th of March, 1929 (a copy of which was sent to the High Commissioner under cover of our Confidential despatch of the 16th of May, 1929), and that it was decided, with the concurrence of the French Government, that His Majesty's Government should take no further action in the matter unless and until Ibn Saud raised it again. Government may reopen the question in the near future, and the Foreign Office have thought it advisable to review the situation in order that His Majesty’s Government may be in a position to return a reply to any further official representations on the part of the Hejaz Government without undue delay. For this purpose they have asked for the views of the Colonial Office on the following specific questions. (1) Whether, if the Hejazis revive the question, the attitude of His Majesty's Government should be one of readiness to discuss it with them in co-operation with the From this correspondence you will see that so There are now indications that the Hejas French M. A. YOUNG, HSQ,. , C.M.G.(H c French Government. (The latter would not be consulted unless and until the Hejazis do revive the question): (2) Granted that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to reopen discussions, whether they still take their stand on the Lausanne Declaration (see page 19 of the Treasurer’s report on the Palestine Railways): (3) Whether His Majesty’s Government are willing to carry out the programme of the Haifa Conference (in this connection see Luke’s despatch Confidential of the 14th of August, 1928). As regards questions (1) and (2) we think that the reply is in the affirmative. So far as we know here, nothing has happened since 1923 to weaken the claim under lying the Lausanne Declaration that the various sections of the railway are the property of the respective states in which those sections lie, unless the Hejazi claim that the railway was a Y/aqf under the Ottoman regime can be established. We understand that the only definite text that has been cited in support of the Hejazi Government’s contention is the Turkish Law of August 1st, 1914, which placed the higher control of the railway in the hands of the Ministry of Y/aqfs, a Turkish State Department; but this in itself would not appear to make the railway Waqf property. Steps are being taken to ascertain whether the Hejazi claim as to the Waqf nature of the railway can be definitely refuted. Incidentally it was the possible revival of this debatable point which prompted the amendment to the section of the O’Donnell Report dealing with the Hejaz railway reported in our telegram No. 172 of the 8th of August. /'■'NAs regards question 3, we presume that the Palestine Government would he prepared to carry out the programme of the Haifa Conference. It seems to us that the Hejazi Government could not consider the reconditioning of their section of the line without a conference of this nature, and without the information which such a conference would supply. On the other hand we feel that our own and the French view of the ownership of the railway being what it is, the conference must still be limited to technical questions. We are writing to the Foreign Office provisionally giving our views, but telling them that we have thought it advisable to consult you on the questions which they have raised. We should, therefore, be very glad if you would let us have your observations generally, and in particular on the specific points discussed in the preceding paragraphs of this letter. Yours sincerely, (Signed) O.G.R.Williams.4 Copy* 89153/31. rs bnlCRST. Downing Street, ££nd October, 1931. With reference to my letter of the 26th of August, numbered as above, we should be very glad if you could soon let us have your views on the subject of the Hejaz Railway as the Foreign Office think that the Hejaz Government may raise the question again officially at any moment and we are anxious to get our plan of campaign settled. In my letter of the 26th of August I told you that steps were being taken to ascertain whether the Hejazi claim as to the Waqf nature of the Railway could be definitely refuted. I now enclose a copy of the corres pondence on this point between the Foreign Office and the Embassy at Constantinople which supports the view of His Majesty’s Government that the Railway has never been a Waqf. The question of the Hejaz Railway is also one of the subjects said to be on the agenda of the proposed Moslem Conference to be held at Jerusalem in December. This is another reason why we should like to clear our minds on the whole question at an early date. Yours sincerely, (Signed) 0.G.R.Williams. M. A. YOUNG, ESQ,. , C.M.G.2 COPY . ' (E 3999/688/25) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.V/.l. / 29th. August, 1931 Dear Chancery, ! 3ince the .completion, of his conquest of the Hejaz in 1925, Ibn Scud has contested the right of the administrations of the non-Hejazi countries concerned to 'hie disposal of the portions of the Hejaz Railway in *heir territories. From 1926 6o 1928 this question of the proprietorial rights in the line stood in the way of attempts to arrange that it should 'be reconditioned ior through traffic. At one moment it was agreed that a conference of representatives of the administrations concerned should he held for this limited purpose, hut, when the conference met at Haifa in August 1928, Ihn Saud ! s delegates sought to extend its scope hy reverting to the question of ownership. On this the conference ended abruptly. there ensued a correspondence in which His Majesty’s Government and the French Government took their stand on the declaration made at the Lausanne Peace Conference on January 27th, 1923, (see Lausanne Conference blue admit that that declaration barred them in any way, indicated that the line was the property of the Moslem world, and suggested that the whole question of its future ciisposal should be gone into ab ovo . For reasons into which it is unnecessary to enter, the last communication from the Hejazi Minister for Foreign Affairs, dated March 16th, 1929, was left unanswered. The question has since remained in abeyance, but as tnere » have After the breakdown of the K ifa Conference Book page 604). The Hejazi Government refused to/ic-ve recently been signs of its coining to life again, we ';o consult you on one particular point. It is a main plank in the platform of Ibn Sa/ud, die. various other people like the H Syro-Palestinia.n Delegation* 1 at Geneva., who have cilso concerned themselves v/ith the matter, that the Railway is a Wakf, created for che beenlit ot Moslems and a.s such inalienable and indivisible. The question which we e.re at present considering is whether it was in fact ever made Wakf, a material point which the Hejazis take for granted but which has never been threshed out v/ith them. The only legal text within our knowledge v/hich suggests that the Railway might be Wakf is a Turkish law dated A ugust 1st, 1914, which transferred the control and administration of the line to the Ministry of Evkaf. Ryan, wiuh whom we have been in consultation, considers that such a lav/ could not of itself invest the line with the character of a Wakf. In his opinion all that the law could do, if the line were not already Wakf, would be to plrce it under the control of the Ministry of icvkaf, an ordinary department of state, albeit one specially qualified, having regard to its other function^ lor the direction of a religious or quasi-religious enterprise. He holds that in Sheri law a Wakf can only be created by a specific act, usually a formal deed of consecration, executed by the owner or owners of the property v/ith the express object of transforming it into Wakf. It is significant that when the question of the future of the railway was raised at Lausanne, the Turkish delegation made no mention of its being Wakf but confined themselves to the contention that on religious grounds it shouldshould he treated as an appanage of the Caliphate. In a subsequent arbitral award given in 1925 in connexion with the allocation of the Ottoman Public Debt, the Swiss jurist Professor Borel held that the railway fell to be regarded as Ottoman State property. It seems to us that you may be able to help us to clear up the matter on the following lines (a.) Could you let us have the authentic text and an accurate translation of the law of August 1st, 1914? (b) Can you throw any light on the reason why the railway was turned over to the Ministry of Evkaf at that particular moment, i.e. on the very eve of the Great V/ar? (c) Would it be held in Turkey that the law in question could and actually did invest the line with a now-acquired Y/akf character? (d) If the answer to (c) is negative, is there any evidence of steps having been taken before or after the date of the lav; to make the railway Wakf in accordance with the forms of Shari law? We should be glad if any enquiries which you may find it necessary to make could be made unofficially and discreetly. We do not want to draw attention to the fact that we are considering this aspect of the matter. If we were satisfied that the railway had in any way become Walcf we should not necessarily accept the Hejazi deduction that the interested administrations were thereby debarred from dealing with the portions of the line in their respective territories in the exercise of their sovereign rights. The position is that if we could contend confidently in case of need that it never had been Wakf, we might cut the ground from under the feet of the Hejazis in any further discussion.

Dear Williams, With reference to your Secret letters No.89153/31 of the 26th August and the 22nd October on the subject of the Ilejaz Railway. I give below my observations (in reverse order) on the three questions about which the Foreign Office have asked for your views. 2. As regards question (3) we are prepared to carry out the programme of the Haifa Conference and we agree that the Conference must still be limited to technical questions. 3. As regards question (2) I assume that there can be no question of His Majesty’s Government and the French Government going back on the Bompart Declaration Nothing has happened, is you way, to weaken the claim underlying that Declaration “that the various sections of the Railway are the property of the respective States in which those sections lie'. (See in that connection the first four lines on the second page of the second enclosure to Lord Passfield’s despatch No. 901 of the 17th November, 1930, regarding the petition of the Emir Chekib Arslan to the League of Nations on the subject of the Hejaz Railway and page 80 of the Award). 4. As regards question (1) I find it difficult to see on what basis His Majesty’s Government can discuss this question with the Hejazis should they revive O.G.R. WILLIAMS, ESQ.^9 revive it. If we take our stand on the Bompard Declaration there will not be much room for discussion. The whole tenor of Fuad Hamzah 1 s note of 16th March, 1929 (enclosed in the Secretary of State’s Confidential despatch of 16th May, 1929) is that the matter ought to be discussed »in all its aspects’, and that a necessary preliminary to untrammelled discussion is the tearing up of the Bompard Declaration. Consequently I think it may be diflicult to agree to r- discussion without giving o.e impression that we are not going to quote Bompard and so raising an expectation which will be falsified when the discussion comes on. Alterm.tively if we tell Ibn Saoud that we are prepared for a full aiocussion, but that we tske our stand on the Bompard Declaration, I take it that he will say that he does not want a discussion on those terms. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) M.A. Young .■*\ ’***£' l ’ Downing StrSe€, 24th ilovenDer, 1931. My dear Rendel, \7ith reference to my letter of the 26th August, numbered as above, about the Hejaz Railway, I enclose a copy of my letter of the same date to Young and of his reply iiiereto. You will observe that in paragraph 4 of his letter, Young suggests that if we are to ta e our stand on the Lausanne declaration (in which course he agrees), there will be no room for discussion with the Hejasi Government. We are not sure that this is altogether correct. It seems to us that while His 2/Iajesty 1 s Government must melee the Lausanne declaration the basis of any further discussions, it will be open to the Hejazi Government, should they so desire, to discuss with us methods of carrying out the proposals made in that declaration, e.g. the establishment of an Advisory Council. In any case, the point made by Young does not appear to affect the general position;* and you may talce it that we agree with the views expressed in your letter of the 17th of July, namely, that we should be ready to discuss with the Hejazi Government questions relating to the Hejaz Railway on the basis of the Lausanne declaration, and that we should be willing to carry out the programme of the abortive Haifa Conference of 1928. Our position seems to be a good deal stronger as the result of your correspondence with the Embassy atat Constantinople, a copy of which was sent to us under cover of Warners notes of the 9th and 15th October.

So far we have been unable to trace any specific act making the railway a V&amp;kf at or about the time of the law above-mentioned. Yours ever, Chancery. t«6« Since writing the above we hear from Angora that the Director-General of railways has confirmed his previous information that the Hejaz Railway did not b ecome a V&amp;kf by virtue of the law of 19th July, 191'*; nor was there any indication of any measure endowing it with that character either before or after thft date.

Tfe have heard nothing of importance about the Hejaz Railway since 1928-9. 2. The history of the question is conveniently summarised in the Foreign Office memorandum enclosed in Mr. Rendel’s letter. This should be read with Sir A. Ryan’s memorandum of 3rd April&lt;^ 3, The question as a whole is of only indirect interest to this Office, at any rate at the present stage. The questions for decision are - (a) whether, if the Hejazis revive the question in the near future, we should be prepared to discuss it with them in co-operation with the French (who would not be consulted until the Hejazis actually revive the question); (b) if the answer is in the affirmative, whether we should still take our stand on the Lausanne Declaration; (c) whether we should then still be willing to carry out the programme of the Haifa Conference; (d) whether, if and when negotiations are resumed, we should discuss m detail the contentions advanced in the Hejazi Note of 16th March, 1929. ^ As regards the first of these questions, please see paragraphs 2-4 of the Foreign Office letter, and paragraph 7 of Sir Andrew Ryan’s Note of 3rd April. I think that in the light of Sir Andrew Ryan’s observations, there is no question that we should be bound to assume, in the event of the He^'az^Government raising the question again in the comparatively near future, that Ibn Saud did definitely wish to reopen it. At any rate we should put ourselves in an unsound tactical position (compare paragraph 6 of Sir Andrew Ryan’s note) were we without good reason not to do so. I submit, therefore, that on this point we may agree wit the Foreign Office. F* Point (b) : For the reasons given by the Foreign Office in paragraph 5 of Fr. Rendel’s letter, I think here, too, the answer should be in the affirmative, and that, as they say, ’’from our point of view it would be a great mistake for us to recede from the offers made in the Declaration”, ^e are not, fortunately, called upon in this Office to examine closely the difficult questions raised by the Hejazi claim that the railway was a Wakf under the Ottoman regime (compare on this the Hejazi Note of 16th March, 1929, and paragraphs 10-14 of Sir Andrew Ryan's Kote). Point (c N : Please see paragraph 6 of the Foreign Office letter. I submit that we may agree with foreign Office. 7 Point (d): paragraph 7.- It would be as well, as the Foreign Office suggest, to investigate more closely the proposition that the railway w^s a properly constituted Wakf, with a view to our being able to dispose of the contentions advanced in the Hejazi Note oi 16th March, 1929, in the event of the Hejazi representat reverting to these if and when negotiations are reopned.^- I do not think we are called on to express any views.

Rondel, Rsn., FOREIGN OFFICE, T y dear Rondel, Many thanks for your personal and secret letter of 17th July, No. E 2235/688/25, about the Hejazi Railway question. We note the Foreign Office view as expressed m paragraph 3, and/we' are disposed generally to agree with it. On the specific points raised in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 we share views. We note from paragraph 7 that the Foreign Office propose to take such steps as are possible to ascertain whether the claim that the railway was a properly constituted Wakf can be refuted. I am sending a copy of this letter to Williams. ——(E 2235/688/25) 17th July, 1931 PERSONAL and SECRET. A My dear Laithwaite So far as we can ascertain none of the correspondence regarding the Hejaz railway question has been sent to you since you received direct from the Colonial Office a copy of their secret letter to us No. 51050/28 of the 12th September, 1928. We should now like to have your views and those of the Colonial Office on various aspects of the question, and I therefore enclose a copy of a Foreign Office memorandum prepared about a year ago, which, together with the Colonial Office letter referred to above and with the enclosed copy of a note of March 16th, 1929 from the Hejazi Government, will I hope, adequately explain the position up to May of last year. 2- The only development since then has been that on February 6 th, 1931, Yusuf Yasin told Ryan that he wanted to discuss Hejaz railway questions at some future date. As it J.G.Laithwaite, Esq.it was not clear whether Yusuf Yasin was acting with the King’s approval, we thought it desirable to ascertain Ibn Baud’s personal attitude before embarking on discussions with his Minister. In view of the secrecy with which Ibn Baud cloaked his action in 1928, this was no easy matter, but on March 2nd, when he had a few minutes with the King alone, Ryan handed to him a personal and secret letter in which he referred to the 1928 conversation with Antonius and to the wish expressed by Yusuf Yasin on February 6 th, and enquired whether Ibn Baud had modified the view which he expressed to Antonius in August 1928. I enclose a copy of a despatch from Ryan describing what happened on this occasion. 1 So far neither Ibn Baud nor his ministers have made any fresh move. Ryan has, however, intimated that he is rather uneasy about the question and feels that we should not indefinitely postpone an answer to the Hejazi note of March 16th, 1929. I enclose a copy of a memorandum which he has sent to us on the subject. We on our part do not share Ryan’s uneasiness, since our failure to answer that note is duedue solely to the wish so secretly expressed in 1928 by Ibn ^ Saud whose personal feelings, so far as we are aware, have not changed since that time. We do feel, however, that, if the Hejazi Government were to raise the question again in the comparatively near future, we should have to assume that Ibn Saud now wished to re-open it and that, in that event, it would be desirable that we should be in a position to make a reply without undue delay. We think therefore that it might be well to review the whole question. 4 . Our general feeling is that, if the Hejazis revive the question in the near future, we should be ready to discuss it with them, in co-operation of course with the French Government whose interests and ours are identical. We would not, however, propose to consult the French until the Hejazis do revive the question. ^ Granted that we are ready to re-open discussion*, the A question arises whether we still take our stand on the Lausanne Declaration. We are inclined to think that we should do so, though the French would of course have to be consulted. So far as we are aware, nothing has happened since 1923 to weaken the claim underlying the Lausanne declarationdeclaration that the various sections of the railway are the property of the respective states in which those sections lie. Ryan in his memorandum shows that the Hejazi claim, that the railway was a Wakf under the Ottoman regime, appears to he unsound, a view which is supported by the Borel award. He further expresses the opinion that the contentions in paragraph 8 (a), (b) and (d) of the Hejazi note of March 16th, 1929, are untenable, or, in the case of the last, extremely doubtful. On the other hand we feel that from every point of view it would be a great mistake for us to recede from the offers made in the declaration. t The question then arises whether we are still willing to carry out the programme of the Haifa Conference. It appears to us that the Hejaz, as owner of one section of the railway, is entitled to ask that we should discuss the technical questions affecting it with Hejazi representatives. The Hejazi Government could not indeed consider the reconditioning of their section of the line without such a discussion and without the information which such a conference would supply. On the other hand we feel that, our own and the French view of the ownership and status of the railway being what it is, the conference must still be limited to technical questions. Apartremains that whether we should, if and when negotiations are re-opened discuss in detail the contentions advanced in the Hejazi note of March 16th, 1929* On this point we have no very definite views, but, since the fundamental assumption behind these contentions is that the railway was a properly constituted Wakf, we propose to take such steps as we can to ascertain whether that claim can be refuted. This is, however, a relatively minor point for the moment, and the main object of this letter is to ask you to let us have your general views on the Question of the railway, and to enquire whether you share our views on the points of policy dealt with in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 above. I am v/riting a letter on the same lines to Williams at the Colonial Office.Ik (a. ^313/52/91) Tf- i; Blut 'Me of firsv Sasanne Conference p* 604. K 8X05/73/91 1925.

In reply the following statement was made on behalf of the British and FrencJ Governments, and the Commission toota due note of it:- ’•The Governments of France and Great Britain, acting on behalf of Syria, Palestine and Transjordania, and desiring to recognise the religious character of the Hejaz Railway, declare that they are ready to accept the consti tution of an advisoi’y council with power to submit to the administrations of the different sections of the railway lying in Syria, Palestine, Transjordania and the Kingdom of the Hejaz recommendations for the upkeep of the line and for the improvement of the conditions of the pilgrim traffic. This council will include four Moslem members appointed respectively by hyria, Palestine, Transjordania and the Hejaz and will itself choose its president, and two other members amongst the nationals of other Moslem countries interested in the pilgrimage. It will sit at Medina* 'The recommendations of this council must not be contrary to the provisions of the international sanitary conventions. The French and British Governments declare that in so far as concerns the sections of the railway lying in Syria, Palestine and Transjordania, any profits realised will be devoted to the upkeep and improvement of the whole of the railway. Any sums left over after such improvement will be devoted to the assistance of pilgrims.” In the view of His Majesty’s Government and the French Govern ment, the status of the Hejaz Railway is governed by this declaration. 2. In an arbitral award regarding the distribution of the annuities of the Ottoman Public Debt, given at Geneva on the 18th April 1925, Professor Borel held that the Hejaz Railway was tne property of the Ottoman empire and that its ownership passed to the btates in which it is now situated. 3. In December 1925 Ibn baud raised with Mr. Jordan, the Acting British Agent and Consul at Jedda, the question of the repair and opening up of the whole railway. Under instructions from His Majesty’s Government, Mr. Jordan, while informing ^ Til ..Asit£ 476/475/91 1927 £ 5477/476/91 1927 Informing Ifcn baud in reply that Hia Majesty’s Government were considering his suggestion sjmpathetically, explained to him the view of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the status and control of the railway set forth above. A' 4. In December 1926, during the negotiations preliminary to the Treaty of Jedda, which were conducted by Mr. Jordan, and Mr. Antonius, Ibn Saud brought up the question of the railway. He at first claimed the whole line for the Hejaz on behalf of the Moslem world; but when the position taken up by His Majesty’s Government at the Lausanne Conference was re-affirmed, by Mr. Jordan, he drooped this claim, although without accepting the Anglo-French Declaration. Instead, he requested an advance of £50,000 from the accumulated funds standing to the credit of the railway in Syria and Palestine, which he guaranteed to spend on reconditioning the section of the line which lay within his territory. 6. As a result of discussion with the French Government, Ibn Gaud was invited by the two Governments jointly through their Representatives at Jedda to send delegates to a con ference to discuss purely technical questions connected with the railway: was made clear, in issuing the invitation, that the conference was not to deal with the question of the E 3941/407/91 ownership of the railway. The invitation was accepted and 1928 the conference duly met at Haifa on the 6th August 1928. At the first meeting, however, the Hejazi delegate, Dr, Damluji the Minister for Foreign Affairs, declared tnat he was unable to discuss technical metiers until the question of the owner ship and unity of the railway was first determined. As His Majesty’s Government and the French Government regarded this question ad decided by the Lausanne declaration referred to above, and as the Hejazi delegate refused to change his attitudeifi 4638/407/91 attitude, it was impossible to proceed* 6. On the 8th August, 1928, Ibn Baud, with whom the late Sir 0* Clayton was at that time carrying on negotiations for the settlement of certain other questions at Jedda, explained to Mr* G* Antonius, a member of Sir Gilbert Clayton’s staff, in circumstances of considerable secrecy, that he wanted the whole question of the He^az Railway dropped for the moment; he had given to his delegation at the Haifa conference instructions to raise the question of tne ownership of the railway 'as a n gesture for the edification of Moslems in other countries who 'are always badgering me'* In reply to a question by Mr*Antoniusj Ibn uaud stated that his request for an early settlement of the question of the repair and opening up of the railway was to be treated as withdrawn: he was too busy with other things. He added that he wished Sir G. Clayton and His Majesty’s Government to be informed, and that he had spoken to Mr. Antonius alone because he wanted no one outside the British Government to know what he had said. 7. Before information of this incident had been received by Kis Majesty’s Government, a joint communication had been made to the Hejazi Government by His Majesty’s Government and the French Government through their Representatives at Jedda, in wtflch it was pointed out that no progress could be made with the technical matters for a settlement of which the Haifa conference had been arranged, so long as the Hejazi Government persisted in their attitude regarding the question of the ownership of the railway. To this communication the Hejazi E 4518/407/91 Government replied in a note dated the 10th September 1928 1928 re-stating their view,, and requesting His Majesty s Government and the French Government to appoint representatives empowered to discuss the whole question of the railway or to proeeed to an exchange of views through the normal diplomatic channels* by iBy agreement with the French Government (to whom the secret information possesbed hy His Majesty’s Government regarding Ihn Sand’s own attitude on the question was of course not divulged), the British and French representatives at Jedda made a joint reply to this note to the effect that unless the Hejazi Government would accept the terms of the Lausanne declaration, no useful purpose would he served hy holding such a conference as they proposed; the French, Palestine and Transjordan Governments would doubtless, however, be prepared to send delegates to a conference, limited to the objects of that recently held at Hbifa, provided it were clearly under- f stood tnat the status of the railway could not be discussed. 8. In a note addressed to the British and French Hepresentatives at Jedda anddated the 16th March 1929, the Hejazi Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs again refused to accept the Anglo-French declaration made at the Lausanne conference and requested tnat the whoxe question of the Hejaz Railway should be discussed in full. It was agreed with the French Government that no reply should be made to this communi cation. In November last Sheikh Fuad Hamza asked H. M. Agent and Consul at Jedda orally for a reply to this note. There is no reason to suopose that King Ibn baud’s real attitude in the matter has changed since his statement to Mr. Antonius, and it seems probable therefore that aheikh Fuad Hamza has never been taken into the King’s confidence on this matter. Mr. Bond was instructed to take no further action with the Acting Minister for Foreign Aff*irs, but, when an opportunity occurred, to explain the position privately and orally to the King. So far as is known, he has not yet done so. (bd. ) C.F.A. Earner. 3rd May 1930.Copy* TRANSLATION, No. 19^7/31 6/10/1347. (16th March, 1939) After compliments: I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of Your Excellencies* joint memorandum No.29/29/2 of 21/7/1347 (2nd January, 1929), relative to the attitude of the British and French Governments towards the question of the Hejaz Railway, and to their insistence on the Declaration of Lausanne regarding this railway. In reply to this memorandum I have the honour to inform Your Excellencies as follows: 2. I am unable to understand how the Hejaz Government can accede to the request of your Governments that it should agree to the declaration made at Lausanne on 27th January, 1923, Is it intended to confront the Hejaz Government with a fait accompli in an important religious question on which it has given no opinion, and is in no way bound by what has been done in that connexion by the other authorities? 3. If it is the intention of your Governments to have this question settled in a just manner, which will satisfy all parties and ensure that the terms of the Waqf texts are carried out, this can be obtained by their accepting the suggestion of my Government and agreeing to a discussion of the matter in all its aspects. Then the authorities concerned should meet in order to arrange a real settlement which will secure the attainment of the end for which the railway was constructed, and at the same /time To H.E. The Acting British Agent and Consul, Jedda. H.E. The Acting French Consul, Jedda.time guarantee to the countries through which it passes the rights which they cannot abandon. If* the British and French Governments have other intentions than these, and desire the He^az Government to agree to a thing the acceptance of which is prohibited by religious laws, and only dictate their wishes, I do not think that this is their desire, because they know well that this is undesirable, and will cause much embarrassment and doubt. 5* In order that the British and French Governments may be aware of the position of the Hejaz Government with regard to the declaration of Lausanne of 27th January, 1923, I consider it my duty to make the following observations and explanations: 6 * I made clear to Your Excellencies in my memorandum of 26/3/1347 (10th September, 1928) the reasons that led to the construction of the Hejaz Railway. I clearly pointed out that the causes were not based on any economic or commercial motives, but that it was the desire to facilitate the accomplishment of a primary religious duty which stirred the promoters to construct the line. It is for this reason that they gave the line a religious character, so that this might be the best guarantee against any occurrence which might interfere with the object for which it was constructed. This religious character was continuously and fully respected during the whole time of the Ottoman Administration, and nothing occurred to disturb this character. The British and French Governments have also recognised the religious character of the line, and by /thatthat recognition naturally undertook to take no action likely to affect this religious character, to change anything in the text of the Sharia Waqf laws relating thereto, or to place any obstacle in the way of the performance of a religious obligation for which the line was created. 8. But it appears to me that those who drew up the declaration of Lausanne have overlooked the points set forth above, and have made a declaration in which I consider that the principle of the preservation of the religious Waqf character has not been taken into consideration. Moreover, there were other authorities concerned who were not consulted, and had no share in the declaration. It is clear that the declaration of Lausanne referred to is open to comment, which may be summarised as follows: (a) It was drawn up by two Governments whose fitness to settle the question of a religious Islamic Waqf may be disputed. (b) It was made without the participation of all the authorities concerned. (c) It was made before verification that it did not contradict the Sharia laws which form the basis of the matter. (d) It lays down the principle of the partition of the line, which from its nature is contrary to the Sharia Waqf laws. 9. It will be evident to Your Excellencies that it is a most difficult question for the Hejaz Government to agree to a declaration in the drawing-up of which they took no part, but which is moreover contrary to religious10. I am confident that the British and French Governments do not in the least desire that there should he attributed to them and to my Government a charge of making no effort to settle the question of the Hejaz Railway on a just basis. I therefore hope to receive from Your Excellencies a reply to the effect that they have reconsidered their previous decision and agreed to bring forward the question in full for discussion, in order to arrive at the desired settlement. After respects sgd) FAUD HAMZA. Acting Minister of Foreign AffairsCopy, SECRET, JEDDA, No.82. (E 11*3/688/25) 7th March, 1931. Sir, With reference to my telegram No.38 of February 19 relative to the Hejaz Railway, I have the honour to state that on March 2 I was able to carry out your instructions to make a private communication to Ibn Sa’ud more easily than I expected when I suggested the possible alternative of using Mr. Antonius. Foreseeing that my interview with the King on that day to discuss the Trans-Jordan frontier question would be of an unusual character, I prepared a private and secret letter in Arabic and I found an opportunity of handing it to His Majesty when Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, the only member of his entourage present, had gone out of the room to look for papers. 2. I enclose a copy of the English original of my letter. The King read it without comment. He took no pains to conceal it and I think it more than likely that it was passed after I left to Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, who probably enjoys more of the King’s confidence than any one else at present. Neither of them mentioned the subject in subsequent conversations. It is possible that, if the King wishes to re-open the matter, he would prefer to leave it until the Trans-Jordan frontier situation has been cleared up. I have, etc., (Sgd) ANDREW RYAN. His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Copy. PRIVATE AND SECRF.T. BRITISH LEGATION, JEDDA, February 28, 1931. Your Majesty, After Compliments, Your Majesty stated privately and confidentially to Mr. Antonius in August 1928, when Sir G. Clayton was in Jedda last that, although You had for certain reasons instructed the Hejazi dele gation at Haifa to raise the general question of the status of the Hejaz Railway, You did not wish to pursue that question and that Your Majesty wished Your earlier request regarding the repair and opening up of the Railway to be considered as withdrawn, as You were too busy with other things to give attention to the matter. It is owing to this statement that my Government have not pursued the question since March 1929, when Fuad Bey Hamza last addressed the British Agency at Jedda on the subject. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin recently expressed a wish to speak to me on the subject. This created a new situation and my Govern ment have instructed me to ascertain privately from Your Majesty whether You have modified the view which Your Majesty expressed to Mr. Antonius in August, 1928. ^Tith highest respects, (Signed) ANDREW RYAN. His Majesty King Abdul Aziz ibn Abdurrahman A1 Faisal al Sa’ud.r i ry coi&gt;y. (E 2225/688/26) sec. ;. BOTE OB THE HKJAE HeIIWAI QUESTIOB TO HE BEAD IB COBJUNCTION V-ITH TKt: FOHEIQB OFFICE KEMOBEBDUM OF MB WAHKES.B OF MAY 3RD, 1930. I think that eome of the true inwardneee of Ihn Sa’ud^s attitude when he spoke to Mr* Antonius on August 8th, 1928, has been lost sight of with the passage of time. There were two factors in that attitude, viz:- (a) Ihn Sa'ud no longer really wished the railway to he opened un for through traffic; and (h) The Moslem Conference at Mecca had recorded a resolu tion in June 1926 asserting the fakf character of the railway and laying down a course of action viz:- (1) that the Executive Board (? of the Conference) and the Hejazi Coverhment should he asked to approach the authorities in Jyria and Palestine with a request for the handing over of the parts of the line in their territories; (2) that, if this produced no result, an appeal should he made to the League of Rations; (2) that, if this again produced no result, a case should be brought in the Hague Court; and (4) that, when all parts of the line were recovered, a general Moslem council should he constituted to administer it. At the time of the Antonius conversation Bhekih Arslan and company were doubtless already at work, as they petitioned the League on November 5th, 1928. 2. As regards (a). What Ihn Sa^id said was that he was busy with other things. What he probably had in mind was fear lest the ooening up of any railway should facilitate nenetration into his dominions. 2 .3. As regards (b), Ibn Sa^d said he was being badgered by Moslems. Doubtless he was. He had no use for Moslem Conferences after 1926. 4. In my opinion, Mr. Stonehewer Bird got the true balance when he said in his letter to Mr. Oliphant of September 19th, 1928, ^Hie policy (i.e. Ibn Sard's policy at the Haifa Conference) therefore waa to act in such a way as to appear in the eyes of Islam to have done his best and yet to ensure that the status quo remains undi8turbed rt . 5. Ibn Sa*ud torpedoed the Haifa Conference by rais ing imoossible issues. But he could not keep on saying to his badgering Moslems that he had done his best, if he left it at that. Great Britain and France gave him his chance by remons trating before His Majesty^ Government knew of the Antonius conversation. Fuad Hamsa weighed in with his note of September 10th, 1928, to which Great Britain and France replied. Fuad Hamaa then delivered his further attack of March 16th, 1929, which was specially aimed at the Lausanne declaration. 6. It was decided not to answer this last note on the supposition that Fuad Hamaa was not in the King’s confidence. My view is that Fuad could not have written notes of such impor tance without the King’s approval and that Ibn Sa ! ud was playing his own game i.e. pursuing the shadow of an assertion of Islamic rights, while not wanting the substance that he would have got at Haifa and could still get, namely the reopening of the line. He knows how to bide his time. If we go on ignoring the note of March 16th, 1929, he may one day say that it was unanswerable. It may be difficult for us then as it would be now to publish our reasons for not answering it. Lven if we could do so It would not be apparent why those reasons, if valid, did not pre vent us from answering Fuad’s earlier note of September 10th7. The position now is that on February 6th Yuasuf Yasin, who probably enjoys more of the icing's confidence than anyone, expressed a wish to discuss the subject with me at eomo future time; and I made a secret communication to the JCing on March 2nd reminding him of the Antonins conversation# When Yussuf came back into the room the King made no effort to con ceal the letter. If, after this, Yussuf Yasin returns to the matter, I think: we should assume that he is acting with the King's authority and face up to it, else we are taking a risk of being accused later and publicly of having hung on to the Hailway without being able to reply to Fuad Hamsa's last note. This danger is all the greater because we have no record of the exact words used by the King to Antonius, except second hand versions; and because of the activity of persons like Shekib Aslan, Bjabri and Philby. 8. I am assuming two things on which I may be wrong viz:- (a) that we should still be willing to carry out the programme of the Haifa Conference and (b) that we should still be willing to live up to the lausanne declaration, subject to insistence on the tmrely advisory functions of the Medina Council. If these assumotions are correct we can get the boot on to the other leg and shew, whenever necessary, that it is Ibn Sa'ud who stands in the way of making the railway available for through pilgrim traffic, because of his insistence on an impossible contention. 9. We have abundant material for a reply to Fuad's note of March 16th, 1929 especially if I am right in thinking that the Wakf character of the railway cannot be proved. It may not be advisable to use all this material in writing but it could all be used in oral discussion.X0« far as I know the only definite text that ha a teen cited la eupport of the lieefertion that the railway was a &amp;afcf i» the Turfcieh law of Attpuet let, 1914» That law placed the higher control of the railway in the honde of the Minietry of Wahfe* a furkieh atate leoertiiient* In my opinion that of itself could no more make the railway Matt than it would have made ay hat wakf* if I had hung it up in the fciniatry There le am enormous body of difficult law about i afcfs, but the fundamental principle, as I understand it, is ai^pla i*e, that the owner of property makes it or&amp;r to the almighty by an ex press and voluntary set, recording at the same tima his wish as to the purpose to which it is to be devoted, the manage ment etc. In a pure Islamic system, religious and civil lew are indistinguishable# In nil countries In which thsre are wakfs, certain aaoects of them become the concern of the civil authority, if it is divorced from religious authority, God and Caesar both have their pert in the matter* In Constantinople for instance, practically all urban property was akf and was none the leas largely governed by modern legislation, 11, I xmv«? not seen the Borol award but on my present Information I agree with the conclusion that the Hejas Railway ©cold onl^ be regarded In 1914 as Turkish state property• T.ven if it were proved, however, that it had been made fcakf by a valid form of consecration, I should still hold tst the sec tions of the railway in different territories were the legiti mate concern of the elvll authority in each, subject to their observing the wishes of the founder for the sanctity of suoh wishes is again one of the fundamental rrlnciples, 12, I cannot speak with authority on the alleged principle that all fakfs are indivisible, but I very much doubt the existence of such a nrinciple.13. Fuad questioned the capacity of the British anci French Governments to deal with the question of an Islamic ?akf• This is moonshine. The law on Wakfs can he ascertained for particular rurposes hy non-Mosleme just as any other alien law can he ascertained by those responsible for matters affected by it. The law is in its origins Islamic hut it is so little a purely Moslem preserve that fc.aicfa can be and have been created by Christians for Christian purposes. 14. Fuad further said that the lausanne declaration was drawn up without the participation of all the authorities concerned. The answer is that the authorities concerned were the successive states in whose territory the line lay. The declaration was made in reply to an untenable Turkish claim on behalf of the Caliphate. The then sovereign of the Hejaz was a consenting party to it according to page 70 of the Hand Book to the Lausanne Treaty. I do not remember how Hussein's concur rence wag obtained but I could not have made the statement in the Hand Book unless there*had been authority for it.

Bagge g»q. t C.M.G.,i * *T » ■' - &lt; w gBOQKP 0^ OOHyi^aATXOl , ; J 31 Mr. Cyril V. Uavson and Mr. Paul H. Mangin of the firm of lowent &amp; Wilkinson, Limited, oalled upon me to-day at the suggestion of the foreign Office, where they were recently reoeired by 3ir B. Vansittart, in order to discuss a railway building scheme in the Hejas. 2. These gentleman told me that the object of their visit was primarily to enquire. what measure of support they could rely upon from His Majesty^ Oovernment if they proceeded with a scheme which had reached them apparently from Mr. philby, but which waa said to have originated with King Ibn 3aud: (a) for the oonstruotion of a railway from Jedda, to near Keoca, and on to Medina; and (b) for the thorough overhaul and repair of the existing Hejaz railway from Medina to Ua’&amp;n. 3. It appeared that the seheme waa to be financed by a special tax to be imposed on pilgrims in substitution for the dues whieh they at present pay to the guides who are supposed to look after them, but in fact exploit them. They therefore began the Interview by saying that the finance was arranged fend that the only vital point with which they were preoccupied was the questionsubject to a sat received on this point, it bad already been arranged that Messrs. Erlangers would aet as tbe financial house in connection with this scheme and that Messrs. Paulings, the well-known contractors, would undertake the actual construction. All plant involved would be ordered in England* 4 . I said that the question of the degree of support which the Foreign office might or might not be willing to aooord them was a question for that Dsp&amp;rtment to decide. I could only comment, if they wished, on the commercial aspects of the scheme. They desired that this should be done, and I began by explaining that more than one scheme of this nature had come to our notice during the past ten years, but had not proved to have anything in it. X then explained the circumstances in which Mr. Fhilby resides in the Hejas, and the somewhat unbusinesslike nature of previous schemes which had come to &gt; «. _ „ _ A. A — ~ M A. fc_ a L. — a L. W 4 an means certain, if the new railway was built, that they would be properly compensated, and such vested interests might, therefore, prove a potential source of trouble. I explained, moreover, that until recently the Hejaz an&lt; hejd had been separate countries and that it might not be eo easy for the King extremely powerful and that it was by noto keop the pilgrim lafrarest quiet as they appeared to think* I then touched on the difficulties of technieal construction in a Uoslem country, and pointed out that even if the railway did not go into the forbidden areas of the holy elties, it went very near them, and that apparently for certain portiona of the route an entire Moslem personnel would he necessary for oonstruotion purposes* 5* 2o this they answered that Hit Highness the Siearn of Hyderabad would attend to that aspect of the business, and they thought it unlikely that difficulties would arise, owing, they said, 'to the great gratitude which this soheme would arouse in the Moslem world'* 6 * To this I could only reply that gratitude was a tender plant, eren in festern countries, and that I rather questioned whether it would be strong enough to obriate all the numerous possible causes of friction which might exist in a somewhat primitive country such as Arabia. Moreover, there would be little doubt but that our foreign competitors would eagerly eeise upon and exploit any incident during the course of construction which might profitably be used to discredit British contractors* 7. Lastly, there remained the question \ of the financial condition of the ooumtry* I pointed out that it was clearly our Minister's view that it was becoming increasingly difficulti J v for the country to pay its debts. Hight it not be heJtd, therefore by some of the older creditors that this scheme, although it was designed to improve the economic position of the country, really involved pledging certain assets which morally belonged to prior creditors ? Even if the scheme was so drafted as not technically to involve any revenues which wsre already pledged, the effeet would be that if the contractors were to be paid at all they were being paid by revenue obtained from a nation which owed money extensively elsewhere. ?here remained the question of the continuity of the regime, fhle was primarily a political question for the foreign Office, but the King was well past middls life, and there was no indication regarding what might happen upon his death. 8 . these remarks were all reeeived in good part, and the interview was conducted with the most friendly spirit throughout# it appeared that apart from Mr. Fhilby, another moving spirit in the scheme was another renegade, a certain Sheikh Mohammed Crabtree, of whom the Department of Overseas Trade htiil Messrs. Lowenz &amp; Wilkinson, ltd. had no dlredt oonnsetion with Mr. Philby at present, I advised them to talk to Messrs, lell&amp;tly gankey^ in Jedda* True, I explained, Messrs# Oellatly no record. It Co.,ltd., who were merchants of old standing Hanksy^ f' &amp; j 931 ; . Honkoy &amp; Company wer* to ao*o“ixtent ooapotltore of rhilbya, but they had an unrivalled experience of the Heja« t besides a firet-rate business standing. 1 . It was fimilly agreed (a) That they should talk to that company; and (b) That we should send them statistics of the number of pilgrims entering the Hej&amp;s during recent years. 11 . By the end of the interview it was quite clear that their original optimism was to some extent shaken and that some of the practical considerations adduced had not occurred to them previously. 12. It is, perhaps* worth recording that in the desultory conversation which took place at the end of the meeting* both partners showed considerable interest in oil mutters* both in Egypt and in the Farsan Islands, although the subject was only quite lightly touched upon. •IEOH- O, FAflK?- ’ 12th June, 1931.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000268_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2078</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000268</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2078</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 6/12 'Railways: Hejaz Railway: Reconditioning of.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1931/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-04-24T13:09:36</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (515 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1 and terminates at the last folio with 516; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located at the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 2-515; these numbers are also written in pencil and are circled, but are crossed through.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This volume largely consists of copies of Colonial Office and Foreign Office and correspondence. The correspondence concerns the possibility of the Hejaz railway being reconditioned and extended. A large part of the correspondence discusses the issue of ownership regarding the Hejaz railway. Much of the correspondence documents attempts by the British to dismiss claims that the railway had been legally recognised as a
                           waqfduring Ottoman rule. Matters discussed in relation to the railway include the following:The history of the Hejaz railway.Details of the proceedings of the Muslim Conference in Jerusalem in 1931, and of its resolutions regarding the Hejaz railway (not formally recognised by the British), in which it is argued that the line is a
                              waqf.Reports that the Saudi Government is prepared to put aside the question of ownership in order to discuss with the British and French the restitution of the railway.Details of a Hejaz railway conference between the British, French, and Saudi governments, held at Haifa in October 1935.The issue of whether the British Government should contribute towards the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabian section of the railway.Correspondents include the following: His Majesty's Minister at Jedda (Sir Andrew Ryan, succeeded by Sir Reader William Bullard); His Majesty's Chargé d’Affaires, Jedda (Albert Spencer Calvert, succeeded by Alan Charles Trott); His Majesty's Consul at Damascus (Edwyn Cecil Hole, succeeded by Gilbert Mackereth); the High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan (Arthur Grenfell Wauchope); the Secretary of State for the Colonies; His Majesty's Ambassador in Paris (Eric Phipps); the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs; various officials of the Colonial Office and Foreign Office.In addition to correspondence, the file includes the following items:A copy of a memorandum by the British Consul at Damascus on the history of the Hejaz railway and its management by Compagnie Damas-Hama et Prolongments (DHP).A copy of an extract from the proceedings of the aforementioned Muslim Conference.A copy of the minutes and two copies (one in English and one in French) of the resolutions of the Hejaz railway conference.As well as the aforementioned resolutions, the file contains a number of letters written in French.
