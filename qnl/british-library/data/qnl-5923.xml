The system has been in vogue for very mny years, in fact is a 'life necessity* for the people of Kwait, whose local 'well' supply only suffices for about one fifth of its population, which as you are aware numbers some 60,000 souls* 5. In practice water boats proceed to the spot where the water is found to be just sweet, and this naturally varies with the flow or ebb of the tide, and whether the Shatt- al- &lt;tt rab is in flood (early summer) or is running dead low (winter) 0* It follows therefore that water boats at tln&amp;s {v times fill their tanks on the Fao Bar # out of ai$it of land, and at other times he?7e to enter the mouth of the river and get their water between Fao Village and the mou2x of the river* on very rare occasions they actually have to fp north of Fao and draw water between that place and Abadan* I do not know the reason for the introduction of the new regulations, whereby the Customs authorities require that ^uwait water boats should proceed up the river and go soue 8 miles up stream to Fao Village* Presuzaubly Preventive Of: ioers are afraid that water boats might engage in contraband traf ’ic, and desire by examination of s^icti boat to insure against this* I would submit however that while there raay be rare cases of contraband running on the part of such boats, any daring nakhudar wanting to engage in this risky business, would clearly do so in boats unenctEibered with large water tanks which fill up the whole body of the boat ( and would certainly for preference choose the Shor Subiyeh or Khor Abdulla route and land hts cargo on the many lonely reaches lying between Cm Qaar and the mouth of the Shatt-Al-Arob* 9* You will notice that His Excellency the Ghaikh makes no complaint against the payment to the Iraq authorities of 1he monthly tax which water boats p«qt (port dues), nor does he raise the question cf the new 9 annas per boat which 8 months ago was apparently further demanded of them* Ills Ixcelle- ncy clearly recognises that Iraq is within her rights in Imposing any taxation she chooses within her ter itorial waters* ’hat he does complain of, and I cannot but think with justice, is (a) the farcing of water boats that possibly may bo drawing water actually out of sight of land, to sail up to Fao to report themselves, even though wind and tide be against them* (b) The delaying of such boats many hours opposite the Fao Customs Office, until it pleases some petry official to allow them to leave* 10* The new regulations have undoubtedly already caused the price of water to go up in Kuwait and will bear very hardly on this town during fcha coming sumer months unlessunless cancelled or modified 11.

His Excellency has also verbally explained that the m**' Gulaiman bin Araar bears an exemplary character, and would not dream of offending against any Customs or other regu lations existing within the frontiers of Iraq. 5 . There would appear to be a growing tendency at the present moment on the part of junior officials in the Fao 4•3- Fao region to lend themselves to acts of 'frightfulnes ' where Kuwait subjects and interests are concerned. This I view with some concern, and trust yen will leave no stone unturned to bring about better treatment for Kuwait subjects. After all Kuwait end Iraq are friendly neighbours* and their subjects should be able to live in peace, but small incidents like the one under reference, have a way of poisoning the atmosphere, and result in eocag erated stories getting round, which do great harm to good relations.

Sievwright, Esq.., M.B.E., Director of Customs &amp; Excise, BagMad. SuTdj ec t: - Koweit . Your D.0.3181 of 9tii June, 1932. On my visit to Eao yesterday, I enquired into this matter and find as follows:- In September last, there was a change of the officer in charge at Fao and one of the first steps the present officer Preventive Officer Philip Eff. Ell owe, took was to order that water hooms must call at the Custom House and file an arrival report, to which a revenue stamp of one anna is affixed. The remaining eight annas of the alleged extra taxation is the writers* fee for writing out the arrival reports. There is no objection to nakhudas making out their own arrival reports, if they can write and so save themselves the writers fee. I think you will agree that it is quite reasonable on the part of this Department to insist that all craft entering ’Iraq, waters should put in at Fao Custom House for examination. It is only during the flood season that water boats can take water out at the bar and at all other seasons, (practically nine months in the year), they have to come well into the river for a supply of fresh water and at times have to go well above Fao to obtain it. Except therefore for a short period of about three months, these water booms have to come up to Fao or above and so no hardship is encountered. I enquired from the Preventive Officer in charge whether water booms were subjected to any delay and he assured me that no undue delay occurs. In-coming booms are inspected twice daily on each in-coming tide and water booms are the first to receive attention.o . ■*'' -■j ■ 1 l*~’ / As to the necessity of water booras calling at ?ao I think there is every justification for making them so do. as you know, smuggling is rampant at Sfeo and though nakhudas of water booms may not be the principal offenders, there is no doubt whatsoever that they do indulge in smuggling as a few of them nave been caught. Furthermore recently we have caught a number of small boats (hooris) loaded with sugar etc., and as these small boats could not possibly make the passage to and from Koweit, there is every reason to believe that the goods caught in them are discharged into them for bigger craft and why not from water-booms* Smugglers from Koweit into ’Iraq, have been a thorn in the side of this Department for years and little if anything has been done by the authorities in Koweit to assist this Department in the suppression of this smuggling and I would even go further and suggest that it is secretly encouraged. I think then that there is little reason to assist the Koweit authorities in this matter of water booms until and unless tney agree actively and whole-heartedly to control this whole-sale smuggling* That smuggling via Fao is rampant is proved by the fact that since January there have been 12 cases in which the value of the goods did not exceed Bs.lOQ/- nine cases in which the value was between Rs.lOQ/- and Rs* 500/-. Five cases in which the value was between Rs* 500/- and Rs* 1000/- and one case in which the goods involved exceeded Rs* 1,000/-*£k&amp;S &amp; Ho* Secretarial of Higii (Joiflmissionor for ’ir&amp;g# Bagdad, f* &lt;f' June, 1932* To The Ministary for foreign Affairs* B&amp;gMad (2 copies). Subject:- k-await Wcter 3 o^ts» Memorandum . His Excellency the High Commissioner has received representations preferred by tils Exoa!l&lt;may the Shaiicn of Auwait on behalf of the masters (naxhudas) of tihe water boats which draw fresh water for zvuwait from the mouth of the ihe tt-al-^rab. 2. It appears that last Autumn toe ’Iraqi Customs authorities issued an order that these water-boats must report at tae ifao Ouatcsns post* which incidentally involves a payment of nine annas for each boat on each voyage additional to the monthly dues normally discharged. His Excellency the Shaiith is much concerned at the delays occasioned by this new order. During recent months, it would have been possible for the water boats to take their requirements of fresh water close to the mouth of the river* without proceeding up tike river as far as i’ao. Compliance with the instructions of the ’Iraqi Customs authority has* has thus put them to muoh additional trouhie and delays especially when the wind i© in the north and the tide on the el&gt;b. .hey are liable to be subjected to farther delays on reaching i?eo; sometimes boats arriving in the morning are not allowed to leave until the afternoon. His ixoellenoy the Shaikh represents that unless these delays to the water boats can be reduced, the people of Kuwait will suffer during the summer months, and he trusts that the • Iraqi, government will see their w? y to withdraw the new Oustoras order requiring the water-boats to report at ?ao. S. his lixceilency the High Cormnissioner understands that Kuwait draws four-fifths of its water supply from the mouth of the Ghatt-Al-Krab, and some forty-two dhows, containing greet storage tanks, are permanently engaged in the traffic. The system has been in vogue for very many years, in fact is &amp; ' life neoeaaito * for the people of Kuwait, whose local •well*' supply only suffices for about one-fifth of its population, which numbers some 60,000 souls* in practice it is the object of the water boats to proceed to the spot where the water is found to be just sweet, and this naturally varies with the flow or ebb of the tide, and whether tli© 3hatt-al-Arab is in flood (early summer) or is running dead low (winter). It follows therefore that water boat© at times fill their tanks on the ?ao Bar, out of sir.ht of land, and at other times have to enter the mouth of the river and get their water between&amp;r 3 - between fao Tillage and toe mouto of toe rtrer. un very rare oooaslons toey actually have to go north of ?ao and draw water between that place and Abadan. 4. His Bxoeilenoy toe High Oamissioner is not aware of toe reason for toe introduction of toe new regulations, whereby toe * Iraqi CJustoms authorities require that Kuwait water boats mi at proceed up toe river and go some 8 mile* up streara to ?ao village, presumably preventive Officers are afraid that water boats might engage in contraband traffic, . nd desire by examination of each boat to insure against tais. It is submitted however that, while tnere may be rare cases of contraband running on toe part of such boats, any daring naichada wanting to engage in this risky business, would dearly do so in boats unencumbered with large water tanks which fill up toe whole body of the boat, and would certainly for preference choose the j&gt;hor Jubiyeh or Kiior Abdulla route and land his cargo on the many lonely reaches lying between J» Q.asr and the mouth of th© Ghatt*Ai-Arab. 5. ills Excell enoy toe Shaikh of Kuwait makes no complaint against the payment to toe ’Iraqi authorities of the monthly tax which water boats pay (port dues), nor does he raise toe question of toe new nine annas per boat which is now apparently further daaan&amp;ed of them* He dearly recognises that ’Iraq is within her rights in imposing any taxation she chooses within her- 4 - her territorial water®. fhat he does complain of, perhaps with justice, is (a) the forcing of water hoata tliat possibly may be drawing water actually out of sight of land, to sail up to ?ao to report themselves, even though wind and tide be against them. (b) Ihe delaying of such boats many hours opposite to the fao Customs Office, until the officials there allow them to leave. 6. his Excellency the High Coy^issioner is assured that the new regulations have undoubtedly caused the price o^* water to go up in Kuwait and must bear very hardly on that town during the summer months unless cancelled or modified. the Shaikh and people of Kuwait consider that long established usage has given them the right to draw drinking water from the 3fe&amp;tt~Al-Arab estuary without interference from Customs officials, especially as they do not attempt to evade the payment of dues. 7. In drawing the attention of the f Iraqi Government to these representations, His Excellency the High CorTHaissioner recormsends them to favourable consideration, and suggests that the possibility of cancelling toe new Custom® rules be examined. If cancellation is not entirely possible, ne trusts that only toste boats which are obliged to enter toe river will be required to call at Fa©, and that it will5 will l&gt;e sufficient for otiiers, drawing water souti of the actual entrance, to he visited from time to time by motor patrol boats if such course be nought necessary* ;0;}C-,$mpzou.

The real facts if I may be permitted to make somewhat of a vague statement on this difficult subject, are that many small and widely scattered hamlets exist on both sides of the ohatt al ^rab near its mouth* mostly inhabited by fellahs”. These find it cheaper to try and get their petty supplies from Kuwait where the duty is 4r fc $ than to go and do their shopping In expensive Mohazaaerah or Basrah* both a long distance up stream* It is these people who do any contraband running that exists* but what they do try and get through is only for their immediate household needs* consisting as it does of small quantities of sugar* tea* and clothing* and is not to be compared to the systematic contraband running that say goes on between the Arab Coast and Persia, where big and valuable cargoes are involved* 4* Kuwait on the other hand Is definitely engaged in running the blockade into Hejd* Here everyone is trying to do his best and the Shaikh encourages it* but why not with Bln Baud's blockade operating against them all the time* 5* I apologize for the length of this note-3- note but I am most anxious to try and try and remove mis- conceptions t as these only lead to bad feeling t which I am ever out to counteract* 5 , It may interest you to know that the Shaikh told me this morning, that Tangistani Dhow with a small cargo of sugar and tea from Bahrain for the Persian Coast had, because of the yigilenoe of the Persian Coast Guards decided to try its luok in the Khor Abdullah, and that it had exchange! shots with a Fao Customs motor boat* The latter had apparent ly got the worst of the encounter and had been beaohed* The Shaikh could not rouoh for the details he said, as only fishermen had brou^it the story# *&gt;ut he hoped that the # incident would not be placed at Kuwait s door* The Dhow got e clean away apparently* ur / V 3 Ayr A- 3-7-1932.

I have made full inquiries regarding the statement made by the Nakhuda Sulaiman bin Ahmad aq Amar and beg to submit the following report On the 28th of May, 1932, S.P.O. Kadhim Eff. Moosa accompanied by Watchman Mahmoud Ishak, Bellamchi Zaalan Mohd. and a Nakhuda from Fao to act as pilot proceeded on patrol to Khor Abdullah, not in an Ashari bellam as stated but of the kind usually used in Fao and Kuwait. They were not disguised in any way except that S.P.O. Kadhim Eff. was wearing a dishdasha (arab robe) instead of a uniform as it y/as more comfortable for sitting in a bellam. Watchman Mahmoud had his uniform coat on over his dishdasha and Bellumchi Zaalan had his ordinary clothes on, as Bellamchis are not supplied with uniforms. None of the officials here have ever been out on patrol in disguise. When they had reached the mouth of the river, they saw a water boom anchored. As they did not have enough fresh water with them, they steered towards the said boom to take a supply. When they had approached within a rope’s thro?; of the boom, they called on the crew who were looking on to catch the rope, but they were ignored. so they anchored a short distance away and asked them to lengthen their anchor rope to come alongside^ AfterAfter some time they did so, and the officials hoarded the hoom and examined it, after which they asked for 3 or 4 tins of fresh water which were given them and left. IVhad heen denied hy the said officials that they heat any of the crew, although they admit having spoken to them rather sharply, for not allowing them to hoard the hoom at first. The nakhuda’s excuse was that he did not recognise them at first, and thought they were pirates. Is it not rather strange that he did not recognise them when they were within a rope’s throw, hut admits having recognised them when their hellam was anchored farther away. It may also he noted that watchman Mahmoud and hellumchi Zaalan have heen posted for duty at Fao for the last five years and there are few nakhudas plying between Fao and Kuwait who do not know at least the latter. Now if this nakhuda was really illtreated hy the said officials, why did he not come and complain to me about their conduct, when I would ^inquired into the matter there and then. Further this man, who professes to he lav; abiding and of whom it has heen stated as hearing an exemplary character, know: fully well that the lav; stipulates that as soon as he entered ’Iraq territory, he was to report at this post for the necessary declaration and examination Now that the question of these water booms has come up, I beg to state that the nakhudas of these craft are the prime offenders here, so far as rules and regulations are concerned. Owing-3- * OY/ing to fresh water 'being available at the mouth of the river during the months of April - June, I have come across these water booms, times without number, having arrived from Kuwait, and anchored between this post and the mouth of the river, when the wind and tide was in their favour. Often I would meet them having arrived loaded with water and leaving for Kuwait v/ithout calling here. When they see the Customs launch on patrol, they come up for examination but when no patrol is in sight, they quitely leave without calling. In fact they have been leading us into a sort of hide and seek business. On the other hand, considering the humane business in which they are occupied, they have been enjoying exceptional treatment. Water booms arriving here have had their formalities completed and released with as little delay as possible at all hours of the day and night . In fact every facility has been afforded them and I do not see that they have any grounds for complaint. Nakhudas of water booms have also been known to engage in smuggling and two or three of them are quite notorious in this line. Many of them carry passengers, with baggage as well a s dutiable goods. In my opinion, what these nakhudas of y/ater booms are actually aiming at is to evade coming up to this station for the sole reason that they consider, that as they do not carry any dutiable goods, they should be free from direct Customs supervision so that they may smuggle goods whenever an opportunity presents itgepf. TheyThey also take into consideration that hy not calling here, they would he saved from payment of port dues and writer’s fees. I./4.ur 0.8. o HC. IQ (3 cf 1932.

His Excellency the Shaikh is much concerned at the delays occasioned hy this new order. luring recent months, it would have been possible for the water boats to take their requirements cf fresh water close to the mouth cf the river, without proceeding up the river as far as Fac. Compliance with the instruc tion cf the ’Iraqi Customs authority has thus put them to much additional trouble and delays especially when the wind is in the North and the tide on the ebb. They are liable to be subjected to further delays on reaching Fac: sometimes boats arriving in the morning are not allowed to leave until the afternoon. His Excellency the Shaikh represents that unless these delays to the water boats can be reduced, the people cf Kuwait will s^'fer during the summer months, and he trusts that the ’Iraqi G-cvernment will see their way to withdraw the new Customs order requiring the water- boats to report at Fac.3. nis Excellency the High Ccmmissicner understands that Kuwait draws fcur-fifthj cf its water supply from the mcuth cf the Shatt-Al-Arab, and seme forty two dhcws # containing great storage tanks, are permanently engaged in the traffic. The system has been in vogue for very many years, in fact is a'LIFE NECESSITY' for the people cf Kumt, whose local 'well' supply only sufficed for about one- fifth cf its population, which numbers some 60,000 souls. In practice it is the object cf the water boats to proceed to the spot where the water is found to be just sweet, and this naturally varies with the flow or ebb cf the tide, and whether the Shatt-al-Arab is in flood (early summer) or is running dead low (winter). It follows therefore that water boats at times fill their tanks on the Fac Bar, cut cf sight cf land, and at other times have to enter the mcuth cf the river and get their water between Fac village and the mcuth cf the river. On very rare occasion^ they actually have to go north cf Fac and draw water between that place and Abadan. 4. His Excellency the High Ccmmissicner is not aware cf the reason for the instruction cf the new regulations, whereby the ‘Iraqi Customs authorities require that Kuwait water boats must proceed up the river and go some 8 miles up stream to Fac village. Presumably Preventive Officers a^tre afraid that water boats might engage in contraband traffil and desire by examination cf each boat to insure against this. It is submitted however that, while there may be rare cases : contraband running on the part cf such boats, any daring nakhuda wanting to engage in this risky business, would clearly do sc in boats unencumbered with large water tanks which fill up the whole body ct the boat, and would certainly for preference choose the Khcr Subiyeh or Khcr Abdulla route and land his cargo on the many lonely reaches lying between Urn ^asr and the mcuth cf the 3hatt-Al-Arab. 5 . His Excellency the Shaikh cf Kuwait makes no complaint against the payment to the 'Iraqi authorities cf thecf the monthly tax which water heats pay (port dues), nor dees he raise the question cf the new line annas per heat which is new apparently further demanded cf them. He clearly recognises that Iraq is within her rights in imposing any taxation she chooses within her territorial wateu. What he does complain cf, pei^naps with justice, is (a) the forcing cf water heats that possibly may he drawing water actually cut cf sight cf land, to sail up to ^ac to report themselves, even though wind and tide he against them, (h) The delaying cf such t^Ots may hours opposite to the Fac Customs Office, until the officials there allow them to leave. 6 . His £xcellency the High Commissioner is assured that the new regulations have undoubtedly caused the price cf water to go up in Kuwait and must hear very hardly on that town during the summer months unless cancelled or modified. The Shaikh and pedple cf Kuwait consider that long established usage has given them the right to draw drinking water from the Shatt-al-Arab estuary without interference from Customs officials, especially as they do not attempt to evade the payment cf dues. 7 . m drawing the attention cf the ’Iraqi Government to these representations, His Excellency the High Commissioner recommends them to favourable considera tion, and suggests that the possibility cf cancelling the new Customs rules he examined. If cancellation is not entirely possible, he trusts tnat only these boats which are obliged to enter the river will be required to call at Fac, and that it will be sufficient for others, drawing water south cf the actual entrance, to be visited from time to time by motor patrol boats if such course be thought necessary.^ %y / n \0 y\ of 1932.

On general principles the right of the ’Iraq authorities to take measures against smuggling in their waters cannot be disputed. As you will see, however, they are willing to relax their restrictions with regard to the water boats if His Excellency the Shaikh will guarantee that these boats do not engage in smuggling. This seems reasonable enough, I do not know exactly what sort of guarantee His Excellency can give, and you v/ill doubtless point out to him that if after giving a guarantee smuggled goods were found on a water boat it would be most unpleasant, 3. You say (paragraph 6 of your letter) that ”water boats at times fill their tanks on the Eao Bar, out of sight of land ”, Are these boats at such times within ’Iraq territorial waters?- 2 - ^ti 4* With regard to the case of Sulaiman bin Ahmad al Amar, you will note the reply of the ’Iraq Customs Authorities to His Excellency the High Comnissioner. Two points strike me: One that it would be better for the ’Iraq Customs S.P.0,8 to wear their uniforms instead of disdashas so that they could be easily recognised, and second that - according to their own account - the Customs bellam . finding themselves short of water, took four tins from the Kuwait boat 4 presumably without any payment ? If so in stopping the boat the S.P.O. was not conducting a customs search,but trying to get ”something for nothing”. I do not know whether these points are worth taking up, but I will tal k these over with you, as well as the matter of the l and smugglin g from Kuwait - mentioned by the ’Iraq authorities - during my approaching visit.

In order to illustrate how much money tne Ira^i pending duties) charged in Ira^Treasury is losing on account o^ this smuggling, it is sufficient to give the quantity cf smuggled goods con fiscated oy the Ira pi Customs Department during the first half cf this year. Codds to the value cf 2,100 dinars have/have been confiscated, during that period. The Collector cf Customs and Excise, Basrah, assures us that the goods confiscated are less than one tenth cf those smuggled into Iraq.. All these goods, such as sugar, tea, coffee, saccharine, gold thread and matches are liable to high customs duty. The question cf smuggling has become an ex treijaely serious one. The smugglers have now aimed themsel ves and do not hesitate to fire at Customs Officials when they meet them. Both sea and land smugglers are now armed. An incident occurred recently when a boat smuggling goods from Kuwait fired at a steam launch belonging to the Iraq.! Customs, which was chasing the smugglers. 7e do not claim that sea smuggling is restricted tc water boats alone. Smuggling is now doing practised uy ail ocats including water boats in which smuggled goods have actually been confiscated. The measures now adopted by the Iraq.i Customs Department in this connection do not apply only tc the water boats, but tc all boats alike, It was not the Intention cf the Customs Department tc cause inconvenience to the people cf Kuwait by taking severe action against the boats which carry water tc them, their sole object is tc safeguard the interest cf the Iraqgi Treasury within Ira^i territory. The smuggling in question is not a new thing as it has been engaging the attention cf the Customs Depart ment since 1924. The arrangements made recently with the assistance cf armed motor cars along the Zubair road have, to bax a certain extent, reduced smuggling by land This led the smugglers to concentrate all their efforts on sea smuggling. As strict control over boats at Fac hinders the activities cf the smugglers, the latter have taken the water coats, and the vitai. service they render tc the people cf Kuwait, as an excuse for demanding the re moval/^ 3 Foincvcii cf tli© Iraiii cust»crns ccnticX* In view of the above,, we believe that ■ the Hi b -h Oonunissloner will agree with os that the measures adopted for the protection of tie interests of the Iraq.!

The latter gave it as his opinion that the ' boundary ' of ’Iraq territorial waters towards the open sea, must be considered to be 3 miles from the southern edge of the MARAKAT Abdulla Mud Flat which, he said, at dead low water (neap tide) is exposed as per sketch (3ee blue at hi$i tide line). This gives us/a distance of fully 10 miles of open ‘water from Fao promontory to the limits of ’Iraq’s terri torial water, ./hether Lieutenant Thomas’ estimate of the size of the mud flat is correct and whether his viewpoint as to the extent of ’Iraq’s territorial water is the right one, I am not expert enough to say, but I should imagine that he is not far wrong in his views. III. You will recollect that His Excellency the shaikh when discussing this matter with you October last, gave it as his opinion that drinkable though perhaps not entirely sweet water could be obtained all the year round (in an emergency) from a point outside ’Iraq’s 3 mile limit - that is to say from a point approximately at the western entrance of the Rocka channel. He, evidently, like myself, had no idea of the enormous extent of the Marakr t Abdulla muo. xlat, or that such aC&lt;Av 4 ,&lt; flat was ever entirely exposed which he says itis at/ t ;at extreme neap tides I have the honour to be, Sir , Your most obedient servant, &lt;aT Lt.-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait.NOT?, ON THfl DRTNKIIjG .VA T:]R AYAIXA£L^-IN T A^P IMMEDIATE VTCINI T£. Inside the town proper of Kuwait, there are many salty and brackish wells which provide water for washing purposes, but only one exists which give good sweet water, but this only in small quantities* Immediately outside the town walls and close to the official Bedouin camping grounds, there are two groups of wells known as (a) Al Dasma (b) Al Shamiyeh. The former need not he considered in this note as these are only 40 wells , in poor condi ti on. The latter i.e. the 'Shamiyeh' wells, consist of nearly 600 small wells. They are situated in several groups to the South West of the Town, and from/a mile to a mile from the walls. Though the number sounds imposing, the wells themselves are poor affairs, scooped out by hand, and in some cases lying only a few feet apart. Hone of the wells are lined, and mostly are under a yard in diameter. The wells vary considerably in yield and quality, and also, to some extent, in accordance with the seasons of the year; some becoming rather brackish towards the end of Summer. One recently tested was 40 feet deep, and had 2 feet of water, yielding 45 gallons which, however, soon r efilie &amp;» In former years these Shamiyeh wells used to supply practically the entire population of Kuwait with water, but with the great increase in population during Shaikh Mubarak's reign, they began to prove insufficient, particularly after a scanty rainfall. The rainfall during the Winter of 1907-1908 was particularly bad and in the2 in the Summer of 1908 the water problem may, for the first time, be said to have become acute. It occurred to one boat- owner to try importing water for sale from the Shatt-al- Arab, and, as it was found that water so brought could be sold very cheaply, and yet retain a good profit, a regular fleet of water carrying boats, has grown into existence. At the present day there are 49 boats, of the type known as a 'Bum', employed exclusively in this trade, of these an average of 6 arrive daily, each wiiii about 8,000 gallons of water worth roughly Rs.lOO/-. Many more people, especially the poorer classes now drink imported river water than water from the 'Shamiyeh' wells, as in view of the high rates of donk^r and csrae 1 carriage from the latter, they find it cheaper and easier to do so. For a British force stationed at or operating from Kuwait, there would probably be .sufficient water available from the Shamiyeh wells to supply all needs especially if such force were camped near to the wells themselves. As in the case of the townspeople, however, trans port has to be considered and it mi^it be found more con venient and economical to use imported water, which could boats always be made available in reasonable quantities,/being brought to any part of the foreshore desired. No pumps or piping are available, as the water is always landed from the boats in skins or in kerosene oil tins. Large numbers of locally made wooden water tanks are available. One or two sweet water wells exist at Raweli (5 miles) and Sirra (10 miles) but the cost of bringing in the water would certainly be prohibitive for the great majority of the population.' B w &amp; NOTE ON THS VABIQUS POINTS IN TH3 SHATT AL ARAB ESlU AgY WHERE ^SWEST DRII^KIHj WATERS CAN BN OBTAINED AT DIFFERENT SEASONS OF THE YEAR BY KUWAIT WATER BOATS, (i) Ear purposes of determining the approximate sweet water 'points 1 * required, taking into consideration, tides, winds, current, full stream, half stream and empty stream, it will be necessary to divide the year into 3 seasons, which I shall call (a) High Flood Season (normal) when snows are melting. (b) Low Flood Season (normal) when river is empty. (c) Half Flood Season (normal) when the f Iraq rainy season is on. (ii) At the same time it must be realized that other minor factors also affect the question under discussion, which it would be inconvenient to discuss here. (iii) Taking each item separately we get the following results During (a) Normal High Flood Season (March, April, May, June) sweet water can be obtained anywhere in the river estuaiy between the extreme southerly point of the Fao promontory and and the southern end of the date belt on the Persian shore. This during ordinary flood years. Should the 'floods' be exceptionally hi^ i that is to say well above the average, swettt water can be obtained as far south as the western entrance of the Rooks Channel. This is however rare. The above rule applies for 'mean” tides. Should the tide be high and at the same time a strong south wind b« &gt; .r wmmmmm - E - .s'* (£3/ be blowing, the sweet water limit, will move two miles upstream, while vice versa for a low tide anc north wind we. can add a couple of miles in a seaward direction. During (b) Kormal Lew Flood Reason. (July, August, September, October) sweet water canbe obtained under the following circumstances and at the following points: At High Tide and with north wind blowing five miles south of Abadan, (I^addaghiyeh Estate.) At High Tide and with south wind blowing in the vicinity of Abadan itself. At Low Tide and with north wind blowing a little below the half way point between abadan and Fao (Dora Estate). At Low Tide and with south wind blowing 12 miles be low Abadan. Note. For a n still’ , day the mean between the above figures may be taken. During (c) Normal Half Flood Season , or during ’Iraq’s winter rainy season (November December, January, February) sweet water can be obtained as follows: If rains up country have been good , between Fao and a point 3 miles below it, taking into consideration wind and tide. If rains up country have been poor, between Fao and a point 3 miles above, according to wind and tide. Note(a). It may be worth mentioning that the inhabitants of Fao for approximately 6 months in the year have their drinking water brought them in boats3 (b) During the above 6 months each Kuwait water boat, as it calls at Kao to be exa mined by the Customs authorities before departing with 'full tanks' for Kuwait, gives local officials 4 keroseiie tins of sweet water as a good will offering. This is an old privilege of the Customs Depart ment . (c) Dvery Kuwait water boat is required to report twice on each trip at the ^ao Customs House i.e. on **irst arrival (when empty) and when ready to return (full)- A nine annas fee is charged on first report in/Confidential. No.19 78-S of 1935 British Residency &amp; Consulate-General Bushire, the 27th December, 1933. From The Hon f ble thLt.-Colonel T.C.Fowle, C.B.3., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. To His Majesty’s Ambassador, Baghdad. Subject: Smuggling between Kuwait and ’Iraq* Sir, I have the honour to refer to paragraph 8 of my despatch No.569-8, dated the 29th May 19 33, in which I mentioned the pressure which ’Iraq could bring to bear on Kuwait by exercising restrictions on the movements of the Kuwait water- boats. The point is of importance as it is not only in connection with smuggling, but in other matters also, that this pressure could be applied. I asked Colonel Dickson to investigate the matter and I enclose a copy of his Report No.298, dated the 16th December 1933. 2. Briefly, the situation would appear to be as follows:- Local wells exist which were sufficient for the local population in pre-war years. ThSse wells, however, depended largely on rainfall, and owing to the increase of population under Shaikh Mubarak’s reign, in about 1908 their supply began to prove insufficient, especially when the rainfall was poor. Water then began to be brought in boats from the Shatt-el-Arab , and there are now some 50 boats employed exclusively in this trade. Inan emergency the local population would be able to carry on with the local supply, but they could perhaps only do this for a short period. Artesian wells could probably be sunk with success which may render the local population completely independent of the Shatt-al-Arab water, but this would cost money and throw out of employment the men employed in the water-carrying trade.3. 7ith regard to the actual supply of water from the Shatt-al-Arab. Apparently under the most favourable conditions, which only exist for four months during the year (March to June) fresh water can be obtained at the western entrance of the Rooka Channel. Whether this area is in f Iraqi waters may be doubtful, but as fresh water could only be obtained from this ares for the comparatively short period already mentioned, this point is not of much practical importance. For the rest of the year to obtain fresh water the water-boats have to proceed above a line drawn from the extreme end of the Fao peninsula to the southern end of the date belt on the Persian shore i.e. well within f Iraqi waters.

In view of the coming 'smuggling” conference to be held in Baghdad, I think the above information worth re porting, especially as Mr.Williamson frequently gets timely and accurate news of coming events from friends in Basra. 3. It is not outside the bounds of possibility, I think, that the ’Iraq Government is already contemplating and plan ning the imposition of a prohibitive tax on Kuwait Water Boats, as a retaliatory measure in the event of the Shaikh of Kuwait being unable to see eye to eye with them in the matter of the prevention of the so called 'smuggling” from Kuwait.

Sir KUWAIT WATER SUPPLY FROM FAI I have the honour to forward two letters letters (with enclosure) from His Excellency the Ruler of Kuwait on the subject of what appears from his description to be tiwesome behaviour by an Irani official, the Fao Customs Officer. attitude towards Kuwait ae noted by the Charge D* Affairs, Baghdad, for example in his despatch No.365 of 16th. July, it would seem useless to represent *the matter. Kuw«t t would I feel do better to abandon the use of the Fao water, relying as it did formerly until about the period of the Great War, on its own resources. 3 . The practice of bringing water from Fao regularly and in quantity began only when certain masters of pearling vessels ^feeling the ftost War ISconomic Crisis, and their boats* crews in consequence idle, turned to this as a makeshift in bad times and found it paying. Kuwaitis have thus come more and more to rely upon the Fao Water, many of their wells having in recent years been allowed to fall in. 5 # The re-exploitation of the wells in the interior, the purchase of a Condensor and the use of such artesian water as may exist, would I think be more profitable than representations to Iraq as well 2 . In view of the present Iraqi official- 2 - *s more desirable from a militarj^strategic point of view than the present increasing reliance on an exterior source for water. with His Excellency the Shaikh, stressing the former rather than latter reason; at the same time pointing out that there is no clear evidence of improper action by the Iraqi Official in the case which he has brought to notice to warrant representation.

They are in fashion in the Red Sea Ports and Hejaz as I well know. I believe that In the end the use of artesian water in which the Oil Company will probably give the Shaikh a lead will be the most satisfactory. 3 # Meanwhile the Shaikh himself uses the wells of Adallya, only as you may remember, 6 miles from Kuwait. Ther^ are several good wells formerly much more used and all near Kuwait town e.g. Fathi (on the coast). There is water in Falaicha Island which 1 have a feeling might furnish a very much greater supply than now if properly exploited like Bahrain. (It bears traces of having once in ancient times supported a qite large population.) The Oil Company have found good water at Bahra in quanti sufficient for their needs. 4 .

Reference (a): The Shaikh of Koweit, whose first object was to discover wells suitable for use by a frontier post, has taken no action, because on second thoughts, as he says, a post, even with water, if without rapid communications would be no use. His intention is to wait the establishment of Cable and Wireless here, when he will approach them about a wireless set for the post and the training of personnel to work it. He feels fairly sure of finding water near and south of Bafwan, and anyway there are existing good wells at ^ashaniya, not very far away in Kuwait territory from the frontier. I have however little doubt that the overriding consideration in his mind has been economy. 3. Reference (b). The Kuwait Oil Company agreed to help the Shaikh by leaving down any piping to water they mignt discover during the geophysical survey last winter. No water was found, but officials of the Company, so they have told the ohaikh, believe it might be found at points at which their work did not necessitate their drilling,in pa. ticular V/est and N.,Y. from Kuwait town i.e. between the al Batin and Jahra village, and about the al Liyah. with the Shaikh recently he told me that he thougl&amp;he might, with Iraqi permission, allow a company to be formed which would pipe water from the shatt al iirab to Kuwait. When I expressed my surprise he said that this would be only 'in the last resort', but I am inclined to think - since to dig wells here, he would have to expend iponey, and if a company were to form he would receive at once concession payments from the company, and possiDxy a percentage on its profits - that he would prefer the company. ^’o His Highness, I notice, economy is an increasingly important criterion. 5. I think that you, considering the strategic aspect, would prefer that Kuwait be made independent of outside water supplies, by pipe line or otherwise, and that full exploration of local resources should be mace. I shall therefore, unless I hear from you that you wish otherwise, encourage the shaikh in such exploration. 4.

In answer to the Shaikh*s letter No. 6/5/650 dated the 22nd September 1937, you should reply to the following effect. (a) That you have referred the matter to me and that I am extremely sorry to hear of the inconvenience to which the boatmen and the people of Kuwait are being put to by the delays caused by the action of the Iraqi authorities. That, as His Highness knows, I am always willing to press any of his cases against the Iraq Government through His Britannic Majesty*s Ambassador, Baghdad. That in this case, however, I feel that it would do no good to represent the matter. In the first place, the Iraqi authorities are acting within their rights and in the second, their action is most pro bably influenced by their feelings towards Kuwait in the matter of the smuggling. In these circumstances I am afraid that any protest would have no effect. (b) You might add in your letter that as long ago as June 1935 His Highness was informed (verbally or in/-in writing, as the case may be) by Dickson (vide Kuwait telegram No. 208, dated the 24th June 1935) that the Iraqi Government might, at some time in the future, act as they are now doing.

CONTRACT ?OR SUPPLYING KUWAIT WITH FBR3E 7ATK R YROM_IRAQ^ Since a week some merchants are discussing the question of* supplying Kuwait with fresh water from Iraq, hy boats. After that some of those conractors are AMur-Rahman bin Bahar, Khalid az-Zaid and Abdul-Mohs in al-Kharafi, who have been holding the Landing monopoly. They tried and transferred these discussions with the 'Baladiyah' in the name of the Landing Co., so that they could exclude any other investors, who want to take shares in the future contracts of water. The Landing Co. first offerred to sell the tin (half anna) of water at 6 pies^ and the Baladiyah refused them, because they want it to be sold at 3 pies/(quater of anna). The result of yesterday # s session of the Baladiyah is that the Landing Co. accept to sell the water at 4i pies (one quarter and one eighth of the anna), but still the Baladiyah refusing. They have not reached—an ui^riTiaturn, ^so that they may present the case to H.H. to hold the contracts. H.H. got the news from outside, and he said that if they want to do this they can try and collect a big sum of money with which they can buy a big engine for making fresh water for the town, and by this means, when the engine worked well and produced the^ater, they can dispense with the water from Iraq.

Yours very truly,-2 No. fas' POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT# Dated, August 5th, 1938. To Messrs. A. Beeby Thompson &amp; Partners, 18, St. Swlthin’s Lane, London, E.C.4. Dear Sirs, Thank you for your letters and the book. Major Holmes has no doubt given you a brief outline of the water situation here. A book which has a brief geological description of Arabia and some notes on Kuwait is Sir Arnold Wilson’s 'The Persian Gulf', which I think is to be found in most reference libraries. There is also a book on the 'Geology of Mesopotamia' which has relevant remarks. There was last year an American Seismic Geophysical Exploration Party here, under the auspices of the Kwait Oil Company, whose local General Superintendent would probably be kind enough to supply useful information. In the course of their work the Seismic Party made some shallow drillings (about 200 feet in maximum I think) but had no luck with water. Holmes seems to think that the Island of Fnlaicha, in the Kuwait Bay, in which some good water is found near the shore, might be worth exploring. The existing wells at Kuwait town and in the interior of the Kuwait territory which only extends some sixty miles inland, are -the usual limited Bedouin kind, but you will no doubt observe on the maps the rather interesting two features ( 1 ) The Wadi (dry usually) which runs from near Medina right across Arabia to near Basra, passing along the frontier of Kuwait and ( 2 ) the sharp declivity which extends along the north side of the Kuwait Bay and westward of it into the desert.-2 There are sweet submarine springs off the Coast of Saudi Arabia i.e. below Kuwait territory, and a great head, of very sulphurous, water pours down into the sea from a point seven miles inland in the Kuwait-Saudi Neutral Zone (the source is shown as AIN ABD on the maps), the water in Bahrain Island, which he struck, comes from Persia (Iran) and not from the Arabian Hinterland, and I gather he thinks the same thing might be found to apply here but possibly deeper. Having given you the above rather brief notes could you now make, a proposition, which I could put to the local Government? is rather a problem still, and the (first exploratory) proposition should be made on economical lines, or I fear it will have to be unacceptable. Europeans working in the open is between about October 15th and about May 15th. Holmes may have told you that his theory is that Money, which may well be freer in the future I should add that the best season here for Yours faithfully : Captain Political Agent, Kuwait.Telephone: MANSION HOUSE 7925 (2 lines) Telegrams: “ABTROLOCIC, CANNON, LONDON.’ ( Bentley’s, liebers.

Capt.C^.S.de Gaury. Political Agent. Kuwait. ARABIA. Dear Sir, We are obliged for your letter of August 5th. and will endeavour to trace the references to water in the books you name. Holmes gave us very little information about the district. One way or another we expect to be able to obtain some useful data concerning the geology of the region which, after an, is not very different from that of Iraq on the North, where we have done much work. Doubtless some kind of rainfall firrures are available. We are aware that the financial resources of the smaller States are very much restricted and one realizes the hesitation felo in advising expense when the results of our study might be disappointing. We also know full well that it is useless to recoranend schemeb involvinp a heavy expenditure. If arrangements are made for a visit to the Hadramaut now under consideration by the authorities it would not be difficult to proceed to Kuwait from there, and naturally the cost of both trips would be reduced by sharing on some equable basis the charges incurredin reaching Arabia. ,,T e will endeavour to get sone decision reached abouo Hadramaut and then write you fully. ’/e presume that suitable arrangements would be made in Kuwait for accommodation and movements about the country in comoeny with a guide and interpreter. Our usual charges for Crown Agents work are 10 Os* r day and out-of-pocket expenses whilst away from London, but it may be that a round charge would be more acceptable to the authorities covering both fees and expenses except such as are incurred in Kuwait, and which we have no means of estimating. This will give you some idea of the costs involved, but if the Hadramaut investigation is decided there would be some substantial benefit to both in sharing expenses and fees on journey. Some date before Kraes would likely prove most suitable if a visit was decided upon* We hardly think the investigation would be abortive of results after our experiences in other desert countries, and at Aden upon which I reported early in the war. He should imagine that two or , three weeks in the country would suffice to form a fair opinion as to what course to take. Yours faithfully &lt;2. ficu^ O,. ft r t • P.S .

I enclose for your information a copy of correspondence on the subject with the Service Departments and the Foreign Office. You will see that the former agree with your opinion of the desirability of making Ko.eit independent of Iraq for its water-supply but that none of them considers the strategical argument strong enough to justify expenditure from the funds at its disposal. The Foreign Office pertinently observe that if the Treasury are to be approached an explanation would be required the reasons why the Sheikh or his Council cannot be expected to find the comparatively modest sum required to pay for the preliminary survey. would it not be possible to represent to the Sheikh that the suggested expenditure is in the best interests of Koweit and could be regarded as an investment which if the survey were successful and a company formed to develop the local water supply would be amply repaid The Hon’ble Lieut.Col.Sir T.

As you will know, we are averse to the possibility of any increase of ’Iraq influence in Koweit since, in the admittedly somewhat unlikely event of the ’Iraqis turning against us in an emergency, Koweit when developed, mi#it provide us with a very useful base for Air Forces at the head of the Persian Gulf. e would, therefore, welcome any scheme which offers the possibility of securing an adequate and independent w^ter supply within the Sheikdom* At the same time so long as ’Iraq is our ally and our present relations are maintained the question seems to be almost entirely political. We think therefore, that while it is desirable that the sum of ap &gt;roximately £500 sho Id be made available for the puroose indicate d, it would be difficult to justify any charge on strategical grounds or against Royal Air Force funds.

On general grounds, -therefore , we should welcome the development of an independent water supply within 1 owe it State* On the other hand, we consider that the matter is primarily political, and that, so long as Iraq is our ally, the strategical implications ai’e not sufficiently definite or serious, so far as the Army is concerned, to justify a charge against Army funds* I am sending copies of this letter to Baggallay, Jones and Coryton* Yours sincerely, (8gd*) * *d. allaby* R.7.

It has occurred, however, to Sir Trenchard that perhaps the Kuwait Oil Company might like to contribute either wholly or fifty fifty with the Kuwait Government. The cost of Beeby Thompson’s services would be nothing compared with the benefits which might accrue to both and both would then have their own water supply instead of being dependent on Iraq. In making this suggestion Sir Trenchard has not forgotten paragraph 3 of your letter of 20th September, No. C-302, but if the Company’s operations extend over a large area in the interior they may require wells at a considerable distance from Kuwait town.

'On My return from The Hadhramaut by air on Saturday, I fiound your registered letter of January Ibth on which H.H. the Ruler of Kuwait proposes a fee of £ 150/- for a visit to study the water supply question. The work here has entailed a somewhat longer stay than anticipated due to more extended investigations and I am leaving for -‘■ndia on February 8 th on professional duties for the Maharajah of Nawanagar. The Colonial Office have expressed a wish that I should meet the newly appointed Governor of Somaliland and he is expected to aPi'ivQ in e aarly March about the time X return from India. Should these arrangements materialize a visit to Kuwait would be too late in the season for field work in the Gulf. As regards fees I have always given prior consideration to Governnent policies and have many times when it has been difficult to obtain various grants, left matters in the hands of officials. If any services rendered are likely to reflect some credit on the smallish administration the satisfaction derived is some compensation of a relaxation of professional duties. From the fees drawn for services must be deducted the ^ cost of an expensive office and staff in London, and 25^ is demanded on income tax. Perhaps this aspect is often over looked by those living abroad as well as the time spent on preparing the report after leaving the country. Judging by the work here where quick decisions could be made a great deal of ground might be covered in 10 to 15 days provided there are no delays and hindrances and hospitality is not too Should die new Governor of Somaliland delay his arrival beyond early March I shall feel constrained to abandon that trip and couln then proceed to Basra from Bombay cr Karachi.

In that case a suitable time mi^ht be arranged for visiting Kuwait to look into water matters. Obviously under such conditions it would not be possible to agree tb such terms as £150, as travelling expenses alone would involve considerable outlay, but if the Ruler is still anxious for A water investigation, it might be possible to arrange this later in the year on same equitable basis of remuneration. At the moment there is some uncertainty about the Syriwi work, but I thought it desirable to let you know what was on foot so that you could discuss with the Ruler his ideas of the subject, I had a very strenuous time in Arabia and was with Ingrams in the Hahdramaut for a month before doing the Western Aden Protectorate.

ARABIA 30th June, 1942. My dear Hickinbotham, I forward a prelimenary report on the alternative sources of supply of Drinking water to the Town, I am sorry to say that it is by no means an ’’open sesame”* The subject is obviously an extremely difficult one to solve without quantities of pipe and equipment, otherwise the Arabs would have solved it long ago. The chances of a small bore drill hole, to 100* or 150* in Adailiyeh, being of any material assistance are of the slightest, but in view of your request and H.H. the Shaikh* s feelings on the subject, the Con$&gt;any will drill a well in that area as soon as the drilling machine has completed the work it is at present employed on. I anticipate that this will be in about 10 days time* I hope that we may be able to use the drill to advantage to ascertain the limits of an additional well area at Nigara, if one exists. I forward herewith three bottles of water from our Eocene Limestone water well No. 8 ,located at Sulaibiyeh, if you are going to taste it yourself, I advise boiling it beforehand. Yours sincerely. Major T.Hickinbotham, O.B.E., H.M* s Political Agent, KUWAIT.- 2 w / 1 ^ Consideration of va.vicus alternative sources of supply, (i) By boo:!! from the Bahmashir River (old mouth of the Kanin River, east of the Shatt-al~Arab) . This trip will take longer than the trip to the Shatt-al-Arab. (ii) By arrangement with the authorities who control the piped water supply, to Efmm Qasr, thence by boom to Kuv/ait via the Khor Subiya or by route round Bubiyan Island. (iii) Irrigation water from Jahrah by boom from Kadhamah bay. A sample of this water was obtained on 27/6/42, it contained 1770 P.P.M chloride lotal of 6045 P.P.M. dissolved solids. In its natural condition horses and other animals drink it, but it is very doubtful if even a 66-2/3 ^ dilution with water from i or ii would make it drinkable for the Townspeople. It is of interest to note that there are upwards of 14 large irrigation wells in the Jahrah Oasis each of which produces about 12000 gals per day. Any scheme to utilize water from Jahrah would require:- miles 4” pipe and a pump capable of delivering about 3000 G-.P.H. against 15 O 9 head ^^ or ^ • 52 ~ miles 3 ” pip© and a pump capable of delivering 3000 G.P.H, against $00 ft.head and small quantity of valves hose etc. (iv) Wells near Haggai jah produce a quantity of drinkable water and it is thought that sufficient water to enable 1 boom load per day ( 12,000 gals) could be obtained from this source if it were developed. A covered trench well of requisite length would be the best way of developing it. A quantity up to one mile of 2 ,f or 3' pipe and a pump would be required as handling by animal transport would make the price prohibitive. Mr .Yusuf al Ghanim who will be visiting Haggai 3 ah shortly, has kindly undertaken to collect samples and to examine the productivity, of existing wells. ^ r • 2, gurther development of surface sand waters in the vicinity of the Town. (i) The Shamiyah, is the major area at present in use, the production is said to be declining slightly but the writer visited it on the 28 th and thore are undoubtedly very large quantities of good water being drawn from it still. It is probably developed to its fullest capacity. The average v/ater contains 370 P.P.M,chloride and 1830 P.P.M, total dissolved solids. It is advisable that some attempt be made to record the amount of water drawn from the Shamiyoh daily, in order to see to what extent, if any. it is declining. It is suggested that this could be done fairly easily by the local authorities on, say, 1 day in 10 , by estimation of the amount used by the average camping family in the vicinity and a count of tents, plus a record of the number of donkey and camel loads of water brought in by the Naif and Jahrah gates. The Nifflra area is also in use to a certain extent, but does not appear to be exploited to even a small percentage of its capacity. Accounts regarding this area are conflicting some say that wells in it go bitter or salty if drawn on to any extent, others praise the capacity of the wells. The area is of large extent and should have plenty of dapaoity for enlargement. Sables have been taken and range from practically pure rain water to some 500 PPM chloride. The quality of tho various waters will be reported on later. Prom preliminary examination it would seem that this is the area thatshould be developed by the local authorities and held in reserve in case of a shortage. This view however may be subject to modification when our Resident Geologist has completed Ilia investigation. The Adailiych Area. There are only a few wells in this area presumably because the water is at a depth of about 44 ft. from surface, and it is situated some distance from the Town. Samples have been drawn which show a chloride content of 550 PPM. 5. Utilization of sub surface water from t he So cone limest one. The water from this reservoir rock in the south eastern part of the State is of a quality that renders it quite useless for drinking or detergent purposes* No. 8 water well, situated at Sulaibiyah approx 12-g- miles S.W. of Kuwait produces water containing 3415 PPM dissolved solids of i which 1432 parts are sulphate, it is used by the bedouin for watering animals. Mr .Frank Marsh, A.I.O.C. pathologist reported on this water as ' undrinkable without qualification'. He classified a water of similar characteristics, from our Iio.6 water well, situated 3^i miles S.W. of Kuwait, and containing 2553 P.P.M. dissolved solids, as 'undrinkable for Europeans, might be found drinkable by the indegenous inhabitants of Arabia or India'. Water well No.8 produced on air lift at a rate of 1000 G-.P.H. and No.6 at the rate of about 500 G-.P.H.(contd.) M a g w a, July 11, 1942, On June 26, 1942 the writer was asked to make a s’orvey of the hand- dug wells in the vicinity of Kuwait town with the object of; 1. finding out the probable potable life of the wells; 2» attempting to increase the supply of water by recommending new locations for exploiting the sands feeding these wells; and 3 tiying to determine if a new source of supply (deeper sands) could be found and successfully exploited - this, in order to be prepared in the event that present wells went dry anchor water supplies from the Shatt-al-Arab be denied to the inhabitants of Kuwait# Three areas near the town were suggested, these were Shamiyah, A1 Nigara and Adailiyeh. At present many hand dug wells, whose depths vary from 15 to 50 feet, are exploiting these areas and samples were collected, from a number, in an effort to determine the general quality of the water and also to see if variations in quality harmonized with general tonography and preconceived ideas of the underground picture# The water samples were given a brief chemical examination which only included Total Dissolved Solids (T#D.S#) and Chlorides(Cl)* Conclusions contained in the body of this report were made from the results of these analyses together with the meagre information available about the areas and general knowledge of Ground Water# Information had to be obtained on :- 1, Amount of water drawn per day from the collective areas 2, Drop in static level of water during past month 3, Increase in salinity (T.D.S) of water since winter rains 4# Arab f s conception of a potable water. The following are the conclusions drawn for these questions - obtained thru questioning the well owners and also by personal measurements in wells before and after water was withdrawn# 1 . Average capacity of wells in the Shamiyah area(most prolific of the three), when static level is reached, is only 90 gls. The fluid flows into the bailed well at the rate of about 12 gallon^/hour which necessitates the use of from two to four wells for each repeated camel load. Gross daily take from the three areas (and this includes the water used by animals) is estimated at not being over 20,000 gallons/day. 2. No information concerning the static level drop for the past month could be ascertained but it was probably less than ■§• foot. 3. Relative figures could not be obtained on increase of sali nity however it is steadily getting worse for wells which were used for drinking Ytfater last month are now abandoned or only used for animals. 4. Determination of what an arab calls potable water is and remains the hardest information to obtain. In one case a man will state that the water in his well is only fit for animals, yet on examining the water, it is found to be apparently better in quality than that from another well which is called 'sweet’• by the owner# Frequent inconsisten cies of this sort were found. Samples were taken from a number of wells whose owners were definite in saying that only animals could drink the water - parts per million(HM) in these wells ranged from 2785 to 5850 for IDS and 295 to 715 for Cl - yet Abdulla Mulla sent in a sample which contain ed 5200 IWl T.D.S. and 870 Cl - and stated that this(contd.) Page 2nd. water is just about the limit that is drinkable by numans, If we use Abdulla Islulla's sample as our limit of potability there is not more than ten wells thruout the areas which are undrinkable and there is not much chance of the vast majority of wells ever reaching this impotable limit before the winter rains start. The figure seems high for potability however and therefore an arbitrary limit of 3000 PF$£ TDS of which not more than 600 FBd are chlorides has been set as a working basis. (The writer lias seen Bedouin drinicing the water freely) The water from all the hand dug wells in the Shamiyah, Al Nigara and Adailiyeh areas has its source in the WATER TABLE (top of the saturated Ground V/ater Zone) so before discussing the areas separately, a few general facts on GROUND WATER are given The term Ground 7/ater is given to the water in the saturated zone of the soil, and the depth to the top of this zone varies from a few feet to a few hundred feet depending on the locality. The depth not only varies between arid and humid regions but, because of topographic and other features, varies from place to place within a given area - depth to the water table in the three areas in question varies from 10 to 46 feet (determined from wells). The ground water is not stationery but has a movement caused by gravity alone, - this movement is in slow motion like that of a viscous fluid but not generally in the nature of an underground stream. The rate of movement depends upon a number of factors of which total porosity, pressure gradient in direction of flow and temperature of the water are the more important - experimental work by the United States Geological Survey has shown tnat in areas of moderate relief the movement is on an average of from 2 to 10 feet per day - since the relief near Kuwait is low we can assume that the water here is moving at a much slower rate and this is borne out by the fact that the hand dug wells can be easily bailed dry, after which, the rate of flow back into the hole is only 12 gallons per hour. The surface of the water table is generally not level but is rather a reflection of the land contour’s, however, surface and subsurface conditions may cause a rise or fall which is entirely out of harmony with the land contour. For instance, a location which on surface indications appears favourable for topping the underground water at a reasonable depth, may be directly underlain by a thick, impervious gatchy streaky which prevents percolation of the rain water, causes rapid run off and forces the water table down. On the other hand a high catchment basin may be devoid of gatch below the surface so the water which collects in the basin during rain quickly percolates thru the top soil and brings the water table, at that point, nearer the surface. ’’After a rainy period the water table gradually drops due to the flowing off of the water from the surface of the saturated zone and it continues to sink at a constantly decreasing rate until more rain causes it to rise again toward the sur-iace. ° Altho the movement of ground water is slow, some leaching is done to the sands and thus the salinity of the water gradually builds up. It is diluted and refreshed to some extent by rainwater but since the flowing off oi the water is that nearest the surface and since this water IS the rain refresher, we have a cycle started in which the ground water gradually becomes more saline unless the rainfall is sufficient to keep the system in equilibrium. If rain is plentiful, the water at the water table (and for some depth below) is sweet but id the yearly supply of rainwater refresher decreases, the top sweet layer becomes thinner and the water gets saline with only &amp; small drop in water table — the arab has worked this out to his own satisfaction ioj. he stops his wells as soon as he strikes water, claiming that ix he digs deeper the water gets saltier. The above discussion serves as a basis for understanuing the generaj. underground conditions which one may expect to find. shaj-i now discuss the three areas and try to show how the investigation ox the various hand dug wells fits in with the picture and if there are any possibilities for obtain ing a reasonable supply of good water in parts oi the areas not yet under exploitation. SHAMIYAH AREA: The wells in this area are about 1 kilometer beyond the Naif and Jahrah Gates of Kuwait and are located in a series of erribayments. (Embay- ment is used here as a descriptive tern rather than as a natural conditionPage 3rd. (contd.) for they were probably formed in the following manner - The first wells of the area were located in small natural depressions in the intermittent stream beds. Thru the years (area claimed to be in use for 150 to 200 years) the mounds of earth, accumulated by the di gg ing and cleaning out of the wells after rains, gradually built up until they were quite high. Wind borne sand thickened these mounds into walls and at present they reach a height of almost 18 feet. They enclose areas varying from 75 to 200 ft in length and are generally narrow at the mouth but widen inside. The floor of these embayments slope toward the base i.e. the mouth is the highest part, but even here it is lower than the outside terrain. The mouth of each embayment is an intermittent stream channel, so, during the rains, the water flows into the first or highest embayment until it becomes flooded at which time the water is diverted around it and into the second, or next highest, when the same thing happens. Consequently the upper traps get more run off than each succeeding lower one and altho some of the rain is lost by evaporation and use,probably the larger amount percolates down enriching the ground water supply. Summing up we would then expect, after a few months use, that the first embayment would contain the best water while each lower one would be more saline because 1. Wells are privately owned and since each embayment roughly has the same number of wells, as long as the water remains good, the rate of withdrawal is approximately the same for all embayraents. 2. Since the upper embayment collects the larger amount of rain water, the layer of “sweet” water at the water table is thicker than that of the others - thus unless this trap is more heavily drawn upon than the others, this sweet water will last longer. 3* Flowing off of the water is slow and probably does not greatly exceed the amount withdrawn from the wells. Thus the lower traps do not “steal” much of the good water from the higher ones, and, since their layer of good water is thinner and the rates of withdrawal are approximately equal, more quickly approach the salinity of the parent stocks Then too, the uppermost embayment also gets the benefit of a very small 'sweet” water replenisher from up dip areas in which no wells are dug. The following tabulations give the result of the examination of the waters collected from the various wells (Total dissolved solids are correct to the nearest 50 and chlorides to the nearest 5 Et&amp;)« EMBA7MMT NO: 1. Sample No. 1 - collected from mouth - used for drinking and contains 1850 EBi T.D.S. of which 370 EFM are Cl. Sample No. 2 - collected from middle - used for drinking and contains 678 EEM T.D.S. of which 110 FBI are Cl. EMBAYMENT N0&lt; 2.

As can be seen, the results of the water examinations show to a great extent Just what one would expect to find. Conclusions that can be drawn are as follows :- 1. The water feeding the Shandy ah wells is ground water and the sweetness depends upon the amount of meteoric water that percolated into the soil during the entrapment period following the winter rains. 2. The water in the main part of Enibayment Ho. 1 will probably remain within the potable range for the remainder of the summer. 3m Waters in Embayments Nos. 3 &amp; 2 are, in given order, rapidly approaching the undrinkable limit and will probably not last out the summer unless necessity causes the population to drink water which they now class as unfit. 4* Drinkable water for animals will be able to be withdrawn from any and all of the wells thruout the summer months. 5* Since the sample near the mouth of embayment No. 1 is as high as 1850 FTM T.D.S. further wells in the stream bed and up dip outside the trap, would probably get water as good or even better in quality, however, any wells so dug would not remain of this quality for any great period and once deterioration starts, salinity would increase quite rapidly. This would also hold true for any well dug out- side of the embayment area. 6 .^ The only chance for a large , added supply is this area is from a considerably deeper horizon - about 300 feet ^|but i to get this deep supply we would have to top a sand which, a) is not closely connected with the upper zone of saturation. b) has an excellent total porosity thus allowing it to give up the water freely c) has a sufficient pressure to force a considerable rise of fluid in the hole - if it doesn*t flow, mechanical methods of recovery are necessary. d) has to be, at the most, within the neighbourhood of 2500 to 3000 mi T.D.S. are slim, l The chances of finding such a water bearing horizon.' for since the inauguration of the K.0. C. water search 2 years ago iio such combination of requirements have been located in the large portion of Kuwait Territory already explored. ( The closest we*ve gotten to this ideal was in Water Wells 2, 3 &amp; 7 where the following results were obtained W.W. 2 W.W. 3 W. W. 7 production probably from 300-325 feet. Produced on air lift at the rate of 2000 gallons/hr. Static level 62 ft subsurface. Total dissolved solids 5140 PB! of which 1861 PBl were chloride. production from somewhere between 244-350 feet. Produced by pump at a rate not exceeding 250 gallons/hr. Static level 200 feet subsurface. Total dissolved solids 7500 HFM of which 2978 EEM were chloride. production from interval 444472 feet. Production on(contd. ) - air lift at a rate of some 700 gallons/hr# Static water level 60 feet subsurface* Total dissolved solids 4685 of which 975 HM were chlorides. Water Well No* 7 approaches what we want but even here the salinity of the water is too high for consumption* AL NI&amp;ARA AREA: The wells in this area are approximately 3 kilometers from the Brasi Gate and 4 kilometers from the Naif Gate. Since the area is farther removed from the town, exploitation has not reached the advanced stage that it has in Shamiyah and for this reason one might expect a more fertile field for a potable ground water supply, however, knowing that the amount of good water in the water table is directly proportional to the amount entrapped on the surface, this same lack of exploitation has been a detri ment to the capacity of the area for no embayments have been developed. The only catchment areas noted was a small natural depression above Khan Bahadur Mulla Salehs house, which, because of a few wells in it, is developing into an embayment similar to those of the Shamiyah area, and a surface earthen dam constructed directly across the stream bed as it approach es the sea. The absence of the catchment areas naturally allows a great run off so except for the two mentioned above, we would expect to find the same conditions for water in the entire Al Nigara area as we do outside the embayments in the Shamiyah area - i.e., only a thin layer of good water at the water table caused by normal percolation. The Al Nigara area is in a gently rolling country, of low relief sloping toward the sea and covered in places by gatch or gatcly sand* Intermittent stream beds meander thruout the upper part of the area but finally join about 1 kilometer from the sea. Just below the juncture the populace have erected an earthen dam to entrap the water and this forms the only large catchment locality in the area. Wells are spotted at the base of this dam and as one might expect the water contained in them is very sweet and has a high static level* Below the dam the ground slopes with approximately the same gradient as above the dam until just before the sea shore is reached, high dune sand presents a break. These dunes probably form the only natural obstruction to the run off and a few wells at their base may yield some good water - this is largely a guess, for since the dunes are close to the shore it is probable that the saturated zone is interconnected with the sea and the underground water is practically sea water; a well or two will soon tell. The following are the results of the samples collected from this area. Sample No. 1 is from the highest ground and each subsequent sample is from lower - all approaching the dam and the sea. Sample No. 1 - Sample No. 2 Sample No. 3 - Oollected from well in stream bed above and behind K*B. Mulla Saleh's house. The well is located in a small natural depression in the stream bed and since there are about 6 wells here, the locality is building up to a small embayment. Used for drinking and contains 474 PEM T.D.S. of which 145 HM are Cl. Collected dam slope from K.B. Mulla Saleh's house. Water used for drinking purposes and contains 1721 FFM. T.D.S. of which 510 PTM are Cl. Qollected from well near lone tree approximately half way from Mulla Saleh's house and dam. Stated by Abdulla Mulla that this water is the limit of what the arabs will drink but is normally only used for animals. Contains 5205 EtM T.D.S. of which 870 HrM are Cl.(contd.) Sample Ho, 4 4' Page 6 th* Sample No* 3 Sample No* 6 Collected from well approximately 100 meters above dam (half way between dam and tree)* Used 1 or watering animals and contains 5850 T*D*S* o_ which 715 ERA are Cl. Collected from well at base of dam. Used for drinking purposes and contains only 5^0 EBa T.D.S. of which 70 PEM are 01 . Collected from well approximately 100 meters below dam. Water not used and contains 8585 PSM T.D.S. of which 1780 FBI are Cl. It takes only a glance at the above sanples to show the effect of the dam in storing rain water at the water table. Water from the well at the base of the dam (sample No. 5) has been drawn since the end of the rains and it is still almost as good as Shatt-al-Arab water (4lt&gt; FFk T.D.S. &amp; 105 FBI Cl) not withstanding the fact that the water in the wells above and below it contain more than 10 times as mary dissolved solids* Obviously nothing can be done now to replenish A1 Nigara's potable water supply for this Sumner, but, if a senes of these dams were spotted, across the stream beds, at say 500 yard intervals, before tne next rainy season, they would prevent an excessive run off to the sea during the rains ana build up the following summers potential of good water. Conclusions drawn from the examination of A1 Nigara* s water wells are 1. The water feeding the wells in this area is grcxind water - the prolificacy of the sweet water in the wells is directly proportional to the amount of meteoric water that perco lated thru the top soil/ during the winter rains. 2. The water becomes progressively worse as we. go down, dip to the sea - notable exception being the water at the base of the dam. 3 . Amount of good water at dam not known but it does not extend back 100 meters. However it will probably last thru the summer. 4. Wells above dam, with the exception of the one above K.B. Mulla Saleh’s house, will probably deteriorate much more and by end of summer will only be used by animals. Note:- This is of course dependent on rate of withdrawal and the arabs potability scale when be becomes thirsty. 5. Area below dam does not appear favorable but it is recommended that one or two hand wells be dug at the base of the sand dunes to check their possibility o^ having acted as a trap. Chances of getting good water here are in the ratio of 30 to 70 but the water shortage situation warrants the digging. 6 . A line of hand dug wells should be spotted in the stream bed above the dam in order to determine the area ot sweet water. If it proves reasonable a checkerboard pattern of wells could be dug thru the good area and then padlocked and kept as a reserve until necessity forces their use otherwise the rapid withdrawal from this pool would quickly bring its salinity ±h up to the surrounding wells. 7. See Conclusion No. 6 under the Shamiyah area.Page 7th* (contd.) A D A I L I Y S H AREA: This area is located about 4 kilometers from the Naif G-ate and is even less exploited than the A1 Nigara area, A water sample was collected from only one well (45 feet deep) and it contained 1437 PfM r i 1 *D*S* of which 550 HEM were Cl* The water is only used for animals ana aitho a number of wells could be dug in almost ary part of this area with good chances for finding a similar water, the salinity would probably increase rapidly* Then too, the absence of suitable surface traps makes the chances of finding an adequate supply of better water table water quite slim* Unless an increase of water for animals is desired this area can be disregarded, GENERAL CQNCLUSICNS: Aitho conclusions were drawn for each individual area they are combined below in general :- 1. Further exploitation of the three above mentioned areas, for potable purposes, would not greatly increase the total recoverable good water unless a new trap was lo cated — larger amounts could be drawn within a given period but deterioration of the reservoir would be pro portionately more rapid. 2* Apparently the only chance for a new trap is the sand dune area of Al Nigara - possibility is small. 3* Best locality for increased exploitation in a proven area is at the base of the dam in Al Nigara. 4* Further exploitation or exploration of the ground water zone should be ty hand dug wells - Rate of flow of water into these wells is roughly 12 gallons/hr whereas the rate into the much smaller holes dug by our Sullivan Outfit would probably be less than 5 gallons/hour. While drilling, we would lose approximately 400 gallons of drilling fluid in the sand so an equal amount would have to be recovered before the quality of the formation water could be obtained. At 5 gallons/hr this would take a long time. Then too with a rotary rig it is impossible to tell when we have topped a water sand, consequently we may drill past the 'good water' layer and thus obtain mislead ing information* 5* Only other possibilities for water in these areas are from deeper sands or the Eocene limestone* - a) Deeper Sands - discussed under Conclusion No* 6 of Shamiyah area. 1* Aitho the possibilities of any deep sand meeting the above mentioned requirements are remote, on the far chance of striking a structural trap or a very porous stratum carrying potable water, one, or at the most, two deep test wells are recommend ed. No* 1 definitely ±tk Adailiyeh in the off chance that lesser exploitation has permitted the building up of a potable supply and No. 2 in either Al Nigara or Shamiyah - Shamiyah is favored because of its proximity to Kuwait. Dependent on the results of the Adailiyeh well, the second (in Shamiyah) may be omitted. b) Eocene Limestone - In the vicinity of Kuwait town the water in the underlying limestone is highly saline and sulphurous carrying some 100,000 HEM T.D.S. of which 60,000 HEM are Cl. The quality improves to the west ward but the closest limestone well which may beutilized in case of a water shortage is WW.8 - about 12§- miles Southwest of Kuwait town. Bedouin have been using this water since the well was conroleted early in 1941; it contains 3520 HM T.D.S. of which 765 PBI are Cl. PtlRTTISR N0T3S: '»Vhen the prospects for success of the survey, in the vicinity of Kuwait town, became slimmer and slimmer with added information, other localities near the sea shore were visited. They Included Jahrah, Dimna and Ras al Ardh and it was hoped that the areas might prove favorable enough to warrant exploration in the hope that at least one boom load of water per day could be obtained. Results of the investigation are : — JAHRAH - The locality is the major watering place of Kuwait Territory. It has the optimum conditions, from a water aspect, and except for quality would be the answer to our problem; — the water bearing horizon is close to the surface, is apparently unlimited and has a high total porosity. A number of boom loads could be easily obtained per day, however, since the water carries 6045 T.D.S. of which 1770 FEM are Cl, this area must be ruled out. DHTNA - Exactly the same conditions apply to this area as to Shamiyah, Al Nigara and Adailiyah areas - quality and amount of potable water is directly proportional to the rainfall absorbed by the soil. The population realise this for they have picked an area about 100 feet in diameter on sloping ground in a stream bed and enclosed it by a mud wall (height of wall on up stream side - 3 feet, or down stream side - 10 feet). Outside of this walled area a semi circular area is enclosed by a foot high wall in order to catch most of the over flow. Y/ells inside the large walled area are used for drinking purposes while wells outside the wall, are used for animals. A sample was collected from one of the two wells inside the wall; it contained 615 HrM T.D.S. of which 215 were chloride. A sample from a well outside the wall, but in the semi circle, contained 2730 T.D.S. of which 990 PHI were Cl. Obviously wells dug outside the semi circle would be a waste of time. RAS al ARDH - Only one well was sampled in this locality and it is situated on a promontory overlooking the sea. There are no other wells in the near vicinity and since the water is still potable (1935 FB£ T.D.S* of which 835 H^T are Cl) other wells would mean an increase of supply. However, the capacity of the well is only about 84 gallons per day so an enormous number would be necessary for boom hauling. Any attempt to exploit the area with this purpose in mind would be impractical because this water is also tied in with rainfall and thus the size of the reservoir is probably small - this is realized when one considers a statement made by one of the inhabi tants i.e. that wells are drilled in the summer and then, because the water is usually N. G» , are allowed to stand at least a year, after which, the water becomes sweet. In other words the water gets potable after the rains. HAG/JV.

The v/ater boring operations being conducted by the Kuwait Oil Company near the Shaikh's house have proved a complete failure. The Eocene Limestone water was tapped but on being blown out by compressed air was found to be almost black in colour and stank of Sulphureted Hydrogen. The well has been plugged and abandoned. It is most disappointing but by no means unexpected. The limestone water improves as one moves west, the wells on the coast being quite impossible while the water from some of the more westerly experimental wells is regularly drunk by the local inhabitants. The water from well No.6 is not at all unpleasant and the Political Agent is not in accord with the Abadan experts view that this water cannot be drunk by Europeans. At the request of the Political Agent the Kuwait Oil Company have been examining the possibility of obtaining an adequate water supply locally for a temporary period in the event of a temporary or perman ent stoppage of water borne traffic with Basra and the poss ibility of digging wells in a new area into the surface sands is being considered.

To - The Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to forward for your information a copy of a report on the water situation at Kuwait prepared by Mr. H.H. Guntz, the Resident Geologist of the Kuwait Oil Company together with a letter dated the 13th of July from Kr. Guntz to Mr. L.D. Scott, the Company f s General Superintendent at Kuwait. The recommendation made under General Conclusions ' 1 5 of Mr. Guntz* report was recently carried out a copy of a report on the Adaliyah test v/ell is also enclosed. 2 As v/111 be apparent the Kuwait Oil Company have tafcen a great deal of trouble in their search for water and there can be little doubt that all possibilities of finding an adequate supply of potable water in the vicinity of the town have be«n exhaustively examined. It is indeed disapp ointing that these efforts should have met with so little success. The picture these reports portray is a somewhat gloomy one. 3 # Of the two reeom: endations made in para 3 of Mr. Guntz* letter dated the ijth the first has been tried with out success (see report on Adaliyah well) and Mr. Scott has given his considered opinion that no useful purpose will be served by maicing further tests in the deep sands. 4 # As regards Mr. Guntz* second recommendation it seems that the only possibility for an adequate and independent supply/- 2 - supply of water for the town, the future needs of the Kuwait Oil Company when In production, and of the Sulphur Exploitation Company, is the use of the sub soil water from the Eocene Limestone.Test wells sunk by the Kuwait Oil Company have shown that the quality of this water improves rapidly South West of Kuwait# In the vicinity of the town it is undrinkable, even by aninals, but the water from water well Wo .8 situated 1E£ miles S#W* of the town is regularly used for drinking purposes by Bedouin. This water before being used for a general supply would however still require ✓i considerable purification. Consideration of such a project involving the sinking of a number of large bore wells, the establishment of a power house and pumps, a purifying plant and pipe lines is out of the questio’n at the present time. 5. For the present therefore v/e shall have to content ourselves with recommending to the Shaikh, action on the lines sug ested at the sections marked A B and C of Mr. Guntz f re ort which deals with the possibility of increasing the supply of surface water in the Al Nigara Area. It is clearly important t. at the construction of the dams as sug gested at A should be com. enoed as soon as possible in order for them to be completed by the next rains. It is desirable also that the w 6 rk should be planned before the staff of the Kuwait Oil CompMsmy leave in case technical advice should be necessary, and as a precautionary measure I have asked the Company^ General Superintendent to let me have a note show ing in detail, the way he recommends that these dams should be constructed. 6 . I have therefore written to the Shaikh explaining in simple language the contents of Mr. Guntz* report and I enclose a copy of my letter. As soon as the Shaikh has had tiiae to digest its contents I will discuss the question with him. I feel that some difficulty may be experienced in in ducing him to act upon the recom endations made. Accustomed to leaving the question of water to the Oil Company, he will probably/tfg; - 5 - probably not view with equanimity the necessity of having to spend money himself on the construction of dams to form new catchment areas. 7. It is difficult to estimate the storage capacity of the town but the tanks built by the Kuwait Y/ater Company for water brought from the Shatt A1 Arab would not hold more than four days supply. This does not take into consideration the underground tanks which exist in most of the bigger houses, but it is clear that if anything were to interfere for any length of time with the water supply from the Shatt A1 Arab the situation in Kuwait would soon become critical. 8 . The only other source from which water might be drawn in case of such an emergency is Umm Qasr. I am told that there are storage tanks of some 600,000 gallons capacity fed by a 6 ' pipe line at a maximum rate of 60,000 gallons a day, from the Shatt A1 Arab. This supply is certainly in excess of present requirements at Umm Qasr and I should be grateful if this suggestion could be taken up with the Military Authorities concerned. At present so far as I can ascertain on an average approximately 65,000 to 70,000 gallons are brought daily from Fao but with severe rationing the town’s daily requirements for water brought in from outside could probably be reduced to half this figure. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, for Political Agent, Kuwait. ^7a v S»f\, J I ARV-! ! Code USED: BENTLEV’S YUSUF AHMAD AL-GHANIM TEL.

The blocking of the deep-water channel v/ould not affect them, mine-laying would not be likely to interfere with them for any length of time, and it is improbable that they would form the object of sustained air-attack.

Sir, The question of the provision of water for vessels awaiting a berth in the Elver at the Bar has several times recently been discussed by the Basra War transport Committee. This need is a new development - in peace time it has been unheard of that a vessel should be detained at the Bar through lack of berthing room in the River. The Port has no facilities with which to cope with this situation. No craft are available which can water ships in the weather conditions that may obtain outside the Rooka Channel. •I &lt; The suggestion is that either the Port, the I.W.T. or some other authoritative body, should charter or if necessary even build or assist in the fitting out of two or more water dhows of the type used for the supply of Koweit # s needs. I believe that at present the existing Koweit water boat fleet is very fully engaged owing to the increase in the population and business of the port.

I refer to my letter of ?&gt; 8 th October and your cabled reply. I am most grateful to you for investigating this matter and for the suggestion you make for the over-coming of our water provision difficulties in this area. ■fhe best solution that Kuwait can offer is, as I am sure you will agree, an extremely expensive one, but I fully under stand the exaggerated value that dhow owners are at present putting §n their craft, although £500 or £600 a month fcfcce* for craft ^together could carry but 100 tons of water is, on any commercial basis, impossible. This could not have been allowed to be decisive if there were no other solution to be found. I have been re-examining with the pert Authorities and the I.W.To the whole problem of water supply in the Shatt-al-Arab and while the solution that we have evolved is only a partial one, it does # I think,promise sufficiently well to justify me in procrastinating over the offer you put before us - though I realise that its rep4tition if we ask for it later may be a matter of difficulty. The Port have agreed to make available about one dozen moorings between here and Khorramshahr for vessels ranging in length from 500 feet downwards and the idea is to place vessels at these moorings rather than leave them outside the Rooka Channel andtheefore few if any vessels should be kept waiting there if our programme goes as it should. in the Shatt itself water supply difficulties can be solved by the easy conversion of existing barges • Having involved you in some trouble over this matter I have felt that I owe it to you to tell you the full story. It may be that we shall have to ask for your good offices again in this matter. I have the honour to be.

The freight per bag of grain from India to Kuwait is 13.6, these two vessels between them can carry 3,055 bags of grain, there is ample cargo waiting to be lifted in Karachi, thus assuming the vessels leave here or Basra in ballast and only maKe three voyages in five months the owners will make 13.54,990 in freight whereas in the same period of time they would only receive Rs.40,000 from the Ministry of War Transport.

Information came to our notice in 1942 of an apparent attempt to liquidate the local firm, which impelled Vtfeld-Forester, who doubtless knew the firm and its partners well, to minute the proposal as sounding commercially somewhat fishy.

IXUL/t-llL , No Sol Dated /A' Kuwait Receipt CT^IBENTIAL 4 th Jun° 1943. / Wit^ to my confidential letter Wo. 1360 (17/3/11C) of ?%y 9Rth, naragranh 6, T learn from one bank here that the firm of F.Suben (Rasra) Ltd., is a subsidiary of F.Suren, London, and from another bank that S.Suren 4 Co., (Basra) Ltd., is not connected with Suren, London, but that the late Mr. B.Suren was a sleening-nartner in the firm B.Suren (Basra) Ltd., and acted as their agent in London. In the circumstances, the second oninion is more likely to show the real facts. 2. Without prejudice I enclose cony o^ two ooinions on the firms of 'B.Su^en (Basra)’* Ltd., and of one on ’’The Gulf Trading Co., Ltd.”. Non will notice that although Mr. Leon Bssaye and Mr. William Meinel are British subjects, the firms annear to be registered in Iraq and so to be deemed Iraqi firms under the existing laws, the nationality of the shareholders not affecting the issue. 3. ^his oninion seems to be slightly at variance with the contention referred to in your letter of May 22nd that n essrs Suren are a purely British concern, unless n^rhans your informant was thinking only of capital and the nationality of the partners. 4. I hav^ not yet received a competent opinion as to whether the firm, or firms, can build a water distillation plant within the next two years, but according to information from another source I leam that Joe Bssaye, brother of Leon, is representative of the IJ.K.C.C. in Few York and that Leon Bssaye’s father-in-law owns a liquor(?) distillery in Bagdad, while another brother, John, is in touch with the U.K.C.C. in London. This goes to show, together with Meinel*s hydro engineering knowledge, that the possibility of achieving the necessary combination of technical qualifications and shipping transport may not be so remote as it seemed at first sight. ?/ajor T.Hickinbotham Political Agent, Koweit.' q !*Suren (Basra^ Ltd., is a subsidiary of B.Suren, London. fi^n was incornorat^d on 25.1.55 in Iraq with a capital of Tr ).90 r '0 conmrising 9000 ordinary shares of TO. 1 /- held as follows: 4000 B.Suren, London. 5000 L.Sssaye (Basra). 2000 J.Bssaye (London). Thi^ firm did a very larp;e business in dates and grain, the finance of whic^ was forthcoming from Mr. Suren in London who enjoyed a ^irst-class renutation in financial circles there. Mr. Suren died in June 1942 and the nosition has become consequently obscure, ^he firm under r^e^ence is still in being but annarantly is doing no business. T do not know who has inherited Mr. Suren’s shares in the Basrah concern. 5. Th~ Oulf trading Co., Ltd., was incorporated in Iraq in 1942 with a canital of ID.9000 fully subscribed. The Partners are Mr. Leon Sssaye and Mr. Y.Meinel, British subjects. 4. # Owing to the comparatively recent incorno' r 'ation o- p this firm, it is not possible to giv* detailed in^o-mnation on their financial status. It is clear however that they have no connexion with the successors to B. Suren, London, 'h-ir London agent is Joe Bssaye, 9/15 ^enchurch Buildings, U.C.5. Mr. L. Bssaye is reported to be possessed of consider able personal means but it is impossible to assess his exact worth - this especially because finance ^or his date and grain business was forthcoming from London. a) With regard to th^ last paragraph of vour letter, as the fi-nns are both registered in Iraq they ar^ deemed to be T^aqi firms under th- existing Laws, the nationality of the shareholders being of no consequence. b) Although B.Suren (Basra) Ltd., was a company incorporated independently it appears to me that in view of the financial assistance obtained in London there must have been a v a ry close connection. B. Suren (Basra) Ltd. nr e are informed: D ^ivate Limited Liability Company registered in Iraq on 25th January 1955 with a capital of ID.9000 divided into 9000 shares of 71).l/- each taken up by the following:- B.Suren, Middlesex (deceased) Joe B.Bssaye, New York.
