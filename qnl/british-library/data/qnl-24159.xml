I have the honour to inform you that I have a Nash car, model 3$, which I purchased for Rs.8,000/-. For its repairs I spent Rs.1,000/-, but I regret it has not been repaired satisfactorily. I want to sell it but I find it necessary for me to request you to favour me with a permit for its export. I am doubtlessly confident t that you will help me. Especially when you see the . number of cars exported last year and the year before, you will find that some people permits while others got two permits each, but your friend did not so as the others did. I have put up this application for the above reason. Your decision is preferred. A.G. only half of its cost or even less has been offerred. U.E. /‘fMMPolitical Agency ?

M*s Political Agent, Bahrein. Most Kespected Sir, I Most humbly and respectfully beg to submit the foilwing few facts for Your Honour’s Kind consideration, and pray for redress. Sir, I have come here as a representative of my firmj Hoor- bhoy Allibhoy Halai &amp; Sons,Karanchi, just to export the iron scrap to Abadan, which was purchased by my firm for the same purpose, before nearly six to seven years, and which is still lying here. In this respect, I personally went to the Director of Custom &amp; Port Officer, and asked him to give me the Export License, who informed me that the same cannot be granted as same of the Iron scrap was useful to Bahrein public. I, inturn, also consented with his argument, and told him of my willingness to sell it here. In connection to the selling price, the Controller fixed the rate at Ks .10/- per cwt, for all kinds of scraps. I, informed of the sane to my firm in Karachi, and asked their advis?, who replied me by the letter, telling me not to sell the same at controlled price, as it was considerably low, and ales told me of the differ ent expenses incurred on it uptill this time, whcih letter,! enclsse herewith for Your Honour’s disposal. With tnis letter, I a^ain approached the Controller and explained him all the facts written im my letter, but he did not feel to cnange the price. i iiow, I will be£ to state tne following facts for Your Honour consideration. A heap of scrap was purchased without weighing as a lump sum and it contains various kinds of meterials. The goods have been lying here,in Manama, in heap unsorted for about six years and lot of goods have been completely rusted and be come o f no use• Out of these meterials some are suitable to this market, of course in a very limited quantity and majority of tne goods are unsellable in this market and also abroad. The goods which are unsellable here should be allowed to be exported to Abadan(Iran)• Considering all the above facts, if I am forced to sell the meterials at the fixed rate, my firm will have to suffer a very high loss, as all the valuable quantity will be taxen away by the customers. In the end, I hope Your Honour will do your utmost to help me in this matter. j am Honour to be , Respected Sir, Yours Most Obediently, v Hakim. i. ; ^ ; *APPLICATION FOR EXPORT LICENCE ( To be prepared in triplicate; to be retained by the exporter; one for record m the Agency; and one to be given to the Director of Customs, Bahrain.)

H. B. M* 3 Political Agent, Bahrain. ■&lt;\ 'h &gt;7 Please permit me to submit these few lines. I applied for the renewal of a permit which was granted for the export of my car by your predecessor. I was told by one of your staff that there was no hope. My last letter was very short, so I could not explain the position fully. permit was for a Pontiac car. Only three Pontiac cars have ever come to Bahrain. These® were imported in or before 1938. Two of them were exported by others recently and mine is the only one left. It is very old and there are no spare parts for it. It is not running and will never run. Perhaps it is only Pontiac in the whole of the Persian Gulf. Pontiac is not one of the makes the export of which is forbidden. Permission was granted to me while I was on the Haj. On my arrival I worked on it extremely hard buying at exhorbitant prices certain spare parts or getting them made at heavy prices. I made it work and it can drag itself along, but it is not capable of doing any continuous running. It is useless to me lying in the garage and it will result in heavy loss for me. If it is allowed to be exported the position of transport in this country will not be affected. This car has been in the g arage and has not run on the roads for nearly three years. JWhen I obtained the permit for its export I sold the car, but the purchaser would not take it over except in running condition. You are well known to give every matter all the consideration it deserved, so I am requesting you to consider this matter of mine as its export while doing no harm to any one will save this humble petitioner from a serious loss. The permit has been granted and what I ask is only a renewal. I am confident that you will not disappoint me as I have been always praying for you and the British Government. I remain your obedient servant. Hassan bin Saleh. /uc&amp; u ^Ko.C/ US'* Political Agency* Bahrain, the 9th April 1944, To Mr. Hassan bin Saleh, BAHRAIN . Memorandum Reference your letter dated the 4th April 1944 asking for a licence to export Pontiac car from Bahrain. 2. It is regretted that no new permits can be granted nor old ones renewed.
