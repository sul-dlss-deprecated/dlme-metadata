Mesopotamia and Middle East: Question of future Control. (Memorandum by Secretary of State for India.) 13 V ^he war has brought us into special relationship with various areas in the Middle Kast formerly included in the Ottoman Empire. The character of this' iflatjonslnp \aiies in tlie diflerent areas. It is closest in Mesopotamia and Palestine for which we have accepted a ' mandate' ; less close in the Arabian peninsula (excluding the Hejaz;, where we merely enjoy a •' predominant influence ' • loosest of all in the Hejaz, which has been recognised as an ' independent ' State. But all these varieties have one feature in common: they all differ from anything that existed before the war. Even in the mandated territories, our position falls far short of sovereignty or even suzerainty, and our duties will, it is hoped, be transitorv and diminishing. It does not amount to a ' protectorate ' as hitherto understood.' On the other hand, it differs entirely—even in the ' independent Hejaz—fiom the ordinary diplomatic connection between nations of equal status. The novelty of this relationship is the measure of the need for some new controlling,agency at head quarters. The India Office and the Colonial Office are accustomed to administer and to 41 protect ' ; diplomacy inter pares is the business of the Foreign Office. No Depart ment of His Majesty's Government has hitherto conducted (at any rate on any considerable scale) the delicate relations which circumstances have now imposed upon us. 2. It has always appeared to the India Office that the proper solution of the difficulty lies in the creation of a new Department (the ' Middle East Office ' might be a suitable designation) to control our relations with all the areas in the Middle East with which w T e have now been brought into direct contact. These would comprise Mesopotamia, the Persian Gulf, the whole Arabian peninsula (including the Gulf littoral, Oman, the Aden Hinterland and the Hejaz). Palestine, Syria (in so far as concerns British interests in that area), Armenia and Kurdistan. Egypt and the Sudan would naturally pass under the control of the same Department. Probably also Persia, with whom the agreement of 1919 has brought us into a new relationship 10 1628 120 6.20t a 2 which while it certainly does not amount to a protectorate, falls short of tho diplomatic equality that existed (in theory at any rate) in the past, ihe aavantage of co -ordinating all these spheres of activity under a single controlling agency needs no demonstration. It has, in fact, become an urgent practical necessity ihe only question is what the agency is to be. The Parliamentary and financial objections to the creation of a new Ministry are fully appreciated; and it is possible that, in the circumstances of the time, they may prove to be insurmountable. But the India Office feels so strongly that the best solution lies in this direction, that it cannot refrain from pressing the suggestion once more upon the consideration of the Cabinet. 3. Failing a new Ministry, it remains to consider which of the existing Depart ments of State is best qualified to undertake the task. Of all the practicable selections, that of the Foreign Office appears to be the least appropriate. The Foreign Office does not possess, and would not pretend to possess, administrative or quasi-administrative experience. It is not organised on an administrative basis ; nor are its training and traditions such as to qualify it for administrative work. If it were to undertake the direction of Middle Eastern affairs, its personnel and machinery would have to be completely reorganised, with results that might seriously impair its diplomatic efficiency without providing a really adequate instrument for the discharge of its new liabilities. The point need not be laboured ; so far as is known, it has never been in serious contemplation to entrust the new task to the Foreign Office. 4. Next in order of consideration conies the India Office, which has already supervised the civil administration of Mesopotamia for over three years. The manner in which this task has been discharged comes in for severe criticism in a recent memorandum circulated to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for War. It may not be out of place to offer a few comments on some of Mr. Churchill's strictures. In the first place it should be,emphasised that the India Office, and not the Foreign Office (as Mr. Churchill suggests), is primarily responsible for what has been done, and must bear the chief blame if the w T ork has been done amiss. Mr, Churchill, in the second paragraph of his memorandum, quotes various examples of what he regards as ill-advised activity on the part of political officers in Mesopotamia. Of these, the survey of a pipe-line to the Mediterranean was merely an appanage to the Haifa-Hit railway project—a purely military affair which in no sense derived its inspiration from the civil administration or the Secretary of State for India. The care of the Chaldean and Assyrian refugees was also undertaken by the military, not the civil, authorities; but in any case the duty of providing for people who had fought for us, and had in consequence been driven from their homes by our enemies, was a debt of honour which it would have been disgraceful to repudiate. What is meant by the ' general reconstruction of the Turkish province' is not clearly understood. This is not the place to discuss the general considerations affecting administrative action in Mesopotamia. Perhaps the best answer to criticism is to be found in the actual situation as it stands to-day. Peace reigns in Mesopotamia, and law and order are effectively maintained there. Of what other area in the Middle East can the same be said ? 5. Turning from the past to the future, it is not contended that the India Office is a suitable Department to control Middle Eastern affairs. It is true that, so far as Mesopotamia is concerned, the local authorities are in favour of remaining under the Secretary of State for India. But the India Office has its hands quite full enough already. The supervision of Mesopotamia has subjected its resources to a heavy strain, which has only been bearable because it was believed to be temporary. Increase of staff, or the creation of new Departments within the Office, might ease the situation, but would not go to the root of the difficulty. India is an all-sufficient preoccupation for a single Minister of State. To throw in the Middle East, with all its novel problems and complications, would impose upon the Indian Secretary a burden too great for one man. Moreover, Indian opinion would probably be all against the innovation. We should be told that India expected her Secretary of State to mind her own affairs, that it was derogatory to her dignity to be treated as a part-time job, and so forth. There would also be practical administrative difficulties. In India the Secretary of State in Council is the final financial authority ; in the Middle East the Secretary of State (the Council would have no authority ?) would be subject, like other Ministers, to Treasury control.
