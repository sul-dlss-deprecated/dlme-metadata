Confidential. 1903 PERSIAN LOAN. Telegrams, 20th January—1st April. From Secretary of State to Viceroy&gt; 20th January 1903. P. —Proposal to make loan to Pei'sia, contained in Sir A. llardinge's private telegram to Foreign Office of 13fA January. Having regard to letter to Foreign Office of \2th November 1901, enclosed to you with Secretary's letter, No. 55, ofVoth idem, please telegraph your views. From Viceroy, Oth February 1903. p.— Following is our opinion regarding Persian loan, asked for in your telegram of 20th January. Situation has been carefully considered in the light of later recent telegrams. The imminence of a third loan by Russia renders a British offer, in our opinion, still possible and desirable. jf assistance is given, it should be shared by British and Indian Governments, and must not be given by Indian Government alone. Nor should the transaction be confined to a single loan of relatively small amount, but future extension should be contemplated so that value and permanency of our stake in Persia, thereby to be created, may increase. As to channel through which to make loan, there icould be a difficulty in the way of using Indo-European Telegraph, which is a department of Government of India, but it is one that might be evaded if a Perso-Indian Company for special purpose of new line were formed. An analogy for such a Company is to be found in the concession for the Julfa-Easvin road, see Sir A. Hardinge’s Despatch of 30th November 1902. There seems to me to be no solid objection to the loan being made through the Imperial Bank, as I proposed in October 1901. . As to security, the first Russian loan is secured by the Persian Customs receipts, excepting those of Pars and the Gulf ports; the security for the second includes all Customs houses to be established in the future, a reference of an unmistakable and dangerous character to the Customs line irlnch it is proposed to establish along the Perso-Baluchistan frontier from Seistan to the sea, and at other places within the British sphere. case of both loans these conditions are in direct conflict with the promise made by the late in October 1897, not to place the Customs of Southern Persia under foreign supervision and control, a promise by which His Majesty s Government hare held the Persian Government to be bound. The discrepancy between it and the conditions attached to the Russian loans was pointed out to the CronT Filer by Sir A. Hardingeon May 1902, but no reply appears to have been received to his communication. TFe hope that Su Majesty s Government will insist upon this obligation of the which case the Customs of the whole of Southern Persia are available as conditions. S. 19. At}J/^litkmfhJ 8 vT UHt \ Me Custom*of Southern Persia, I would suggest the condition that Persia should undertake not to give effect to any concession political, territorial, commercial, or otherwise, in those to anv '^a variation ^of ^thT' havul! 'Jj rst 0 ff ere * U to ourselves. This condition is a varrntion of that proposed by me on 26M October 1901, and is preferable to that suggested by India Office in the following month. ^ lour per cent, interest might be charged on the loan. Whether the loan should be payable and repayable in Krans is a question that might he worth considering. * Whether the above proposals are feasible depends upon the question whether Persia desires to free herself from complete Russian control, and whether ILis Majesty s Government is willing to stake something for British interests m Southern Persia, and to insist subsequently on the fulfilment of the obligation entered into by Persia. From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 20th February 1903. P.— Your telegram of 0th. There appear to us to be very formidable difficulties in the way of making a simple loan to Persia. Her treaty arrangements with Russia are opposed to it. The loan could only be made, if it could be made at all, through the Imperial Bank, for the permanent continuance of which as a British institution we have no security. It might, however, be possible by some such plan as outlined below, to safeguard our interests in Seistan and South Fast Persia ; and ice should be glad to have your opinion whether your Government think such a plan—the only object of which is the defence of India—is of sufficient importance to make it worth while fur India alone to lend the necessary funds. The Parliamentary difficulties in passing any Bill, at least during present Session, employing British funds for this purpose would probably be great. The plan is as follows :—That in return for the payment of a lump sum we should obtain from Persia the sole right to construct roads and railways, and possibly other commercial undertakings, in Seistan and South Fast Pci'sia, perhaps also in addition similar definite rights in the Kaimn Valley and between Mohammerah and Kerrnanshah. By a treaty with Russia Persia has bound herself not to allow any railway construction till 1910, a period that may possibly be extended for a further 10 years. A provision might therefore be made that Persia should pay interest on the purchase money until we can exercise the right to build railways, of which we have purchased the monopoly. The Southern customs would be security for payment of interest. This plan has the advantage that it woidd make it impossible for Russia under any circumstances to absorb the territory in question by the process of building roads and railways requiring, as she would allege, to be guarded by Russian trooops. In fact, except from overt invasion the territories would be safe. It is probable that no form of loan could secure more than this, if as much. From Viceroy, 2&amp;h February 1903. p _ Tertian Loans. The plan you describe your telegram 20 th MeZracfg as it does, the protect of Karan Valley and region between Mohammlrah and Kermanshah, which are matters, as we have often argued, of Imperial rather than of Indian importance, is clearly not3 exclusively concerned with the defence of India. Nevertheless it con tains m our opinion, the ger to of a valuable suggestion, and subject to one condition it is a plan which we should be prepared to recommend your Lordship to pursue. The condition is that no gap is left between the Kanin river and what is very vaguely defined as Seistan and South Eastern Persia Otherwise Russia would be left free to reach the sea anywhere through the intervening territory, and to build railways to Bunder Abbas Bushire or other ports. It is only on the condition that the proposed monopoly includes the entire belt of Persia south of the line, Khanikin, Kermanshah Ispahan, Yezd, Kerman, Seistan, that we consider that Indian revenues should be used for advance to Persian Government. We should be willing in return for such a monopoly to find a sum not exceeding 1,000,000/., in one or more instalments, interest at 4 per cent, being payable thereon until the amount due as interest is covered by net revenue from railways, roads, and other works that may be constructed, the security being the entire customs and excise revenue south of the proposed line, in so far as these are not already pledged. Care would have to be taken to define accurately these revenues so as to preclude taxes being raised or hypothecated in future for other and unfriendly purposes ; also to prevent any third party being brought into the monopolised area, should we be unwilling or unable to construct railways or other public works there. Until, however, we know more of the situation, we reserve our comments on these smaller points. i5i- From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 4/A March 1903. P. —Scheme for Persian loan suggested in my telegram of 20th February was the outcome of a general conference between Foreign Office, Treasury, and India Office. A similar conference, having considered the scheme pro posed in your telegram of 20th February, have arrived at conclusion that its extent would be likely to cause Persia to reject it, and that it is desirable, as India is, according to the proposal of His Majesty's Government, to bear the whole expense, that our plan should be limited to area strictly required for defence of India. Could you give me an idea of minimum area which icould be sufficient for this purpose in opinion of your Government. From Viceroy, 1th March 1903. p.— Your telegram of 4&gt;th March asking our views in regard to Persian loan proposals. As far as defence of India is concerned, no one portion of Southern Persia is, in our opinion, much more important than another. A Russian port on the Gulf, connected with a Russian railway, involving the Russification of the territory through which it passes, is the main danger to be feared. We object to Russia having any Gulf port or any railway to it. Our objection is not appreciably diminished by increased distance of such a port from Baluchistan. Consequently, we are not disposed to contract monopoly area recommended bi) us on 26th; but, as a possible suggestion, if His Majesty's Government are prepared to in terpret the promises, made by late Shah in autograph letter of \6th September 1888, and confirmed by present Shah on 12th April 1900, as conferring on Great Britain a monopoly in the country north of Shuster, then our line might be from Ispahan to Shuster {thereby giving us claim to Ahwazdam), instead of from Ispahan to Burnjird and Kermanshah. The Shah's promises were as follows :— ( a \ priority to British for construction of railway from South to Teheran. . , 7 A _ x , (b) That whenever a railway concession was given to others in the i\orth, V we should receive the concession of a line from Teheran to Shuster or a similar line. . n - (c) T h a t without consultation with the British Government no foreign company should be granted a concession for a line in the Soutn.

Naus tells me confidentially that Russianswe still delaying conclusion of Caspian Fisheries Loan, and that he may have to ask fo/my ielp towards operation m Lonaon, as it is rather a lar^e one for Imnerial Bank of Persia to effect unassisted. He adds that Russians prefer the 1 plan ot a regular loan, with, of course, political conditions. My idea of neutrali zing the Russian financial tutelage would he that His Majesty’s Government should acquire, by purchasing a sufficient block of shares in the Imperial .Dank or Persia, a, control of that institution which would prevent ever- present danger of its [? losing] its British character, and would enable us to !nAAnf!I lanCla ; , hep t0 Persia '' itllout involving her in trouble with Russia. 'lUU.OO ff. would give us such a control with majority of Directors named by C rown, and the investment in itself would he good. India might find the money originally, as secrecy would be essential, and, once position secured, might he repaid, part or whole, hy Parliament. The operation would be analogous to Lord Beaconfield’s purchase of Suez Canal shares, and would a long vay to checkmating M. de Witte, without any financial loss or risk to His Majesty’s Government. Once we get power of making direct loans we can obtain political Con cessions by giving them on exceptionally easy terms, but our first loan must not be directly political, or we shall frighten Persian Government. 11 your Lordship thinks that this scheme is feasible, the man through whom to work it is Mr. Walpole Green well, Stockbroker, Birchin Lane, who holds a large block of shares, and can arrange it. I believe that he made an offer last year to M. de Witte, who declined, but he must be sworn to secrecy till all is settled. If above plan, which I think by far the simplest and most effective, is considered impracticable, shall I sound Grand Vizier about a lump sum down in return for some definite engagement ? They are very hard up just now, and have borrowed 40,000/. from Imperial Bank of Persia for urgent needs. Seistan affairs are a proof of the power of injuring which this Russian control gives. If we could arrange the Caspian Fisheries Loan the situation would, I feel sure, improve. (Sent to Viceroy.) (Extract.) Private telegram from Viceroy to Sir A. Hardinge, 12/A March 1903. I do not think Government of India would favour purchase of shares in Imperial Bank of Persia with Indian money for no quid pro quo except power of making further loans in future. W r e could not justify such a use of Indian funds. If latter are to be employed, we should have to point to positive and immediate return. From the Marquess of Lansdowne to Sir A. liar din ge, 12/^ March 1903. Your telegram of the 8th instant. We share the view expressed by Viceroy as to purchase of shares in Imperial Bank, and we prefer an arrangement of the kind discussed in his telegram of 7th March. We are sending him a reply which will be repeated to you, and we should be glad of your comments upon the proposals made therein.From Secretary of State to Viceroy, 13M March 1903. Conference similar to that described in my telegram of Uh havina considered your telegram of 1th on Persian loan proposals, held that it was advisable to send following instructions to Sir A. Rardinge That in return for money payment he should attempt to obtain from Persian Govern ment exclusive rights (1) throughout the whole area described in your telegram of 26th February ; if he cannot obtain this he should try successively for (2) area indicated in your telegram of 1th March; (3) that indicated in my telegram of 26th February, by which we should get a valuable security for our money in Western Persia; and (4) a triangle of territory, including Seistan, Kerman, and Bunder Abbas, in South-Eastern Persia, so as to render it impossible for Russia to construct a railway to Bunder Abbas or any port east of Bunder Abbas. With our practical possession of Mussendem p?'o- montory, the Admiralty think that this would obviate any serious danger from any Russian port in the Persian Gulf It teas the opinion of the Conference that if India, by the payment o/ 1 400,000/. or 500,000/., on conditions stated in my telegram of 20th February, could obtain this and nothing more, she would be making a good bargain, as it might save her from largely-increased naval contribution and military expenditure in the future. Please telegraph your views. Probably Treasury would be willing in event of default to guarantee a moiety of any deficit of interest that there might possibly be. P.— The proposals of your telegram of YSth March respecting Persian Loan appear to me suitable, except that I hope we may not have to fall West Provinces, perhaps we might regard these as protected by pledges referred to in my telegram of 1th, and ask instead that Persian Government 1896 by Sir H. M. Durand. By these means we should be securing our own interests as well as fortifying the authority of the Persian Government, thus killing two birds with one stone. From Sir A. Hardinge to Marquess of Lansdowne, Ylth March 1903. (No. 55.) Your telegram of 12th March. Viceroy has repeated to me Secretary of State for India s telegiam of 13th March and his own reply. Chief difficulty to me seems that proposed payment is in fact a loan from His Majesty’s Government, bearing interest till an uncertain date, and that Grand Vizier can only accept loans fiom us in two ways :— 1. Through Imperial Bank of Persia as nominal lender, which is method he prefers, because Russians admit that they cannot object to it. 2. Through Indo-European Telegraph Department as a nominal discount on royalties and receipts due to Persia, but lor which othei icvenues can be made collateral security. a siivoof rvivmpnt not bearing interest would, no doubt, prove very From Viceroy, Y6th March 1903. back on third alternative. If Persia objects to grant of monopoly in South- should allow us to raise, upon strict analogy of the Persian Cossacks, corps of Bakhtiaris and Lur tribesmen under British officers, as was proposed in we should ask in return might so incense Russia as to C S. 19.6 to w»ck f rc ,h political Si cr«.1si 1, ““; control. From the first our loan projects havr feiM from h^rT 31 ambitious, and as you have j’skerl fm- rmr nrm x being too think this is its weik point; ^ 1 as I receive definite instructions to do so. ' P 4 on (Repeated to Viceroy.) From Marquess of Lansdotone to Sir A. Hardinqe l%th March 1903. (No. 26.) Tour telegram No. 55. I do not understand how we could make a loan through Bank of Persia as lender in view ot objections raised in November 1901 to our proposed advance through Bank. On what do you base your statement that the Russians admit that they cannot object to it ? As to scheme described in Viceroy’s telegram, do you believe that Persian (jovei nment can accept from any source other than Russian financial assist ance which carries with it payment of interest over a number of years, and if you do, what form would you suggest that it should take? hrom Sir A. Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne* 19^ March 1903. (No. 36.) Your telegram of yesterday. Russian objection [in] 1901 was to direct advance by His Majesty’s Government: whether it was made or not through Imperial Bank of Persia was not before Russians, but if avowed lender was British Government, they would doubtless have objected whatever the agency. So lorur, however, as Imperial Bank of Persia is nominal principal they cannot object as they have grudgingly admitted to Grand Vizier Persia’s right to borrow from that institution, and she has, in fact, done so since loan contract of 1900 up to 240.000J., and would have borrowed more if Bank’s capital had allowed it. Thus Grand Vizier asked me in the autumn of 1901 to obtain for him 300,000/. from Bank, and directors at first told your Lordship that they could provide it, but afterwards failed to do so. Had they succeeded, and had Russia asked questions as to how, with a capital of 650,000/., Bank could lend Persia 200,000/. in spring and 300,000/. in autumn, Grand Vizier would have replied that he did not know. He might suspect that we had helped either by purchasing shares or guaranteeing loan to Bank from other financiers, but, unless he had official knowledge of this, it would be no concern of his. He cannot deal direct with us or with a foreign Syndicate; he can with Imperial Bank of Persia, and he is not obliged to know or ask what is behind it. If, therefore, we could utilise our Bank as the Russians have done theirs, finance it, and if it is desired to [group omitted] its permanent British character, buy shares as suggested by me in it, I believe we could neutralize Russian loan monopoly, besides saving the Bank itself from succumbing to Russians, which would be a great blow to our position here. # . . . 'With regard to your Lordship s second question Persia could, I imagine, borrow from Indo-European Telegraph Department (as she has done from Indo-European Company! in the form of discount on future receipts with, perhaps, other guarantees as collateral security; and the same applies to Darcy’s Oil Company. As regards fresh loans it does not matter who the real provider of the funds is, so long as nominal lender is not foieign Government or financier.ABM4 7 From Sir A. Hardinge to Marquess of Lansdowne, \Qth March 1903 . (No. 37.) M. de Witte has granted advance on the Caspian fisheries, ownership of which thus passes for 22 years, and probably for ever, from Shah to Russian Government. Being as yet unauthorized to make a counter-offer I could not prevent this, hut I still beg to urge that we should have a proposal ready, as I expect relief to Persian treasury will be only temporary. I have little faith in the financial reform now under discussion. Only condition of fisheries advance, so far as I know at present, is repayment of 40,000/. lately borrowed from Imperial Bank of Persia. M. Naus will, however, I suspect, re-borrow it shortly. (Sent to India.) Sir A. Mar ding e to the Marquis of Lansdowne, 20th March 1903. (No. 38.) My immediately preceding telegram. M. Naus, who stated yesterday that fisheries Agreement was concluded, informed me confidentially to-day that Russian Bank has not yet received authorization to pay advance, and there is evidently tresh hitch about details. Application to Indo-European Company has failed, latter asking excessive conditions. (Sent to India.) From Marquess of Lansdowue to Sir A. Mar ding e, 20th March 1903. (No 29 ) If method suggested in your telegram No. 36 is open to us we are quite ready, instead of the scheme suggested in telegram to Viceroy ot 13th March, 'to consider an advance of 500,000/. through the Imperial Bank, provided that we get a sufficient quid pro quo.

Still, if you are perfectly clear from your local knowledge that our plan is impracticable, and if arrangements can be made for securing advance now contemplated by you, and for preventing future advance on security ol southern, poits to any other institution, as well as to any other Govern ment, we die prepaied to recommend plan to Indian Government and Indian Council. (Repeat to India.) From Sir A. Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne, 28M March 1903. (No. 42.) Your telegram No. 29. It is difficult to say off-hand what conditions could he obtained, but no doubt we could get more for a payment than for a regular loan by Bank. I sounded Grand Vizier, as though from myself, as to former solution, but he answered very guardedly, that he could express no opinion till he had a definite proposal before him, and, in absence of precise instructions, I shrank from saying more. As your Lordship knows, I have always been in favour of beginning by a small advance by Bank, say 200,000/. or 300,000/., without political conditions, effect of which would simply be to prevent further loan from Russia, to get hold of entire southern custom-houses, and to strengthen position of English Bank. I would then, a little later, w r hen our position was stronger, ask for some more formal guarantee about southern roads and railways, as suggested by India, intimating that if this were given, a larger loan or payment on very easy terms might be given. \Ve must get Persia a little more into our debt and under our influence before we can negotiate for substantial gains insisted on by Viceroy; other wise we shall simply repeat mistakes of previous years, and miss our end by over-shooting the mark. The situation is one of great delicacy, which can only be dealt with, as it was by Russia in 1900, by very patient methods at first. Cau your Lordship tell me why His Majesty’s Government object to my proposed purchase of Bank shares; this would render Imperial Bank of Persia, which is our principal political lever here, indestructible as a British institution, and place us at once on same level as Russia ? Its disappearance is a constant danger. . . I think if loan is made through it as nominal [? group omitted | principal plan of placing securities in Legation or so ear-marking our loan as to prevent its passing into foreign hands quite feasible, there are, however, details of which Persian Government must know nothing.

Hardinge, 28 ^ March 1903 . (No. 31 Secret.) Your telegram No. 42. The following objections have been mentioned in different quarters to proposal to purchase Bank shares :— 1. Bank is said to be concerned in transactions which, from an English point of view, would be regarded as usurious and somewhat shady. 2. If such transactions were discontinued shareholders’ profit would be largely diminished, and they would have a grievance. 3. Result of confidential inquiries is to show that it would be extremely difficult to secure a large number of shares. Price of shares would certainly rise if it became known that British Government was a buyer. 4. Prospect of the Imperial Bank being wound up is said to be remote. Upon what do you base your statement that its disappearance is a constant danger ? As under the Charter majority of the Directors must be British subjects, we are fairly protected from predominance of foreign interests. If, on the other hand, the Government acquire the right of nominating a majority of the Directors, the Government would become responsible for the management of the Bank both towards the shareholders and to Parliament. (Repeat to India.) From Sir A. Hardinge to Marquess of Lansdowne^ 2^th March 1903. (No. 43. Secret.) Russian Government have consented to make Caspian Fisheries Loan, but on conditions which Persian Government is unwilling to accept, and which are, therefore, I suspect, political, since the Russian bank’s financial terms are usually better than those of Imperial Bank of Persia. M. Naus has to-day applied to Imperial Bank of Persia for an advance from 200,000/. to 300,000/. (latter preferred), which can only be effected if the money is provided or some sort of guarantee given by Ilis Majesty’s Government. Grand Vizier has sent to ask your Lordship’s assistance, and to beg you, on occasion of this first operation, to make no political conditions which may alarm or be misunderstood by Shah, and so upset arrangement. I venture strongly to urge this opportunity should not he lost ; if we haggle, and the thing falls through, it may not recur again. Rapidity and secrecy are essential. Caspian fisheries by themselves cannot be regarded as a sufficient security, since it is in the powder of Russia to diminish their value by higher duties under new tariff. The southern customs must therefore be made a collateral, and it would probably be more advantageous in view of our interests in the south that they should become the main security. Interest 'would have to be at L mdon rates, and should not exceed 4 to 5 per cent., including agent’s commission. I believe that if His Majesty’s Government will assist this transaction, it may be first step to recoverv of our political position here, and pave way for all the other concessions you desire. But it is essential that it should be in form of a business and not of a political transaction, and that Imperial Bank of Persia should be nominal principal, though precaution suggested in your telegram No. 29 might be adopted. (Addressed to Foreign, Simla. Repeated to Foreign, with Viceroy.) S. 19. EFrom Sir A. Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdoicne, 30^A March 1903. (No. 44.) Your telegram No. 30. There is not, properly speaking, such a thing as a draft upon the Southern Customs. Local Custom-houses pay their receipts into the Imperial Bank of Persia in the south and into Russian Bank in north, and these credit Persian Government to their amount, that Government making payment of interest to each Bank out of those funds. Southern Customs would be the security proposed, as the northern are of the Russian loan, and it should be stipulated in case of repayment of capital or payments of interest falling in arrears that the advance should be the first charge upon these Custom-houses. The Persian Government are precluded from pledging the Southern Custom-houses or placing them under foreign control, but there is nothing to prevent their giving a draft on them to anyone they like. The above pledge would, however, be greatly strengthened by the operation I propose. I have not yet discussed with M. Naus the guarantees to be desired against the reimbursement which I personally think remote, as Persia’s total debt to English Bank will then be 500,000/., but I can do so as soon as I am authorized to treat with entire question. (Sent to India.) F'om the Marquess of Lansdowne to Sir A. Hardinge, 30/^ March 1903. (No. 32.) Your telegrams Nos. 43 and 44 of 28th and 30th March seem in general harmony with proposal in our No. 30, of 28th March, and as we understand your present proposal, it would provide effectually for tulfilment of our conditions. We are, however, doubtful as to there being any advantage in requiring security of Caspian fisheries. This seems to be needlessly provocative of Russia. We wish her to leave us alone in the south, and are prepared to leave her alone in the north. We attach great importance to guarantees against reimbursement. (Repeated to India.) From Secretary of State to Ficeroy , 30/A March 1903. Foreign Office telegram, No. 30 of 28//* March, to Sir A. Hardinge, regarding loan to Fersia, crossed his telegram No. 43 of same date, which seems to strengthen necessity of some such policy as is suggested, in the Foreign Office telegram, and renders it more than ever desirable that our action should be rapid. The matter seems of great importance, and the earliest possible expression of your views is desired, with a mew to which I repeat to you Lord Lansdowne s reply to Sir A. Hardinge: ' There appears to be general harmony between your telegrams Nos. 43 and 44 of 28th and 30th March and my telegram No. 30 of 30th, and your present proposal, as we understand it, would provide for effectual fulfilment of our conditions. We attach areat importance to guarantees against reimbursement.

Latest proposal appears to be that Indian F unds should be advanced to Persia for no political return whatsoever, but solely in expectation of securing bigger loan with possible quid pro quo later on. We have all along contended that, to justify exclu sive loan from Indian revenues, we must be able to point to material protection (?) of Indian interests; this condition is absent from the proposed transaction. We therefore think that, if loan is to be made on terms now suggested, it should be shared by His Majesty’s Government with ourselves, vide our telegram of 9th February. Opportunity seems to be exact replica of that which His Majesty’s Government has always regretted having missed in 1900, with difference that Indian Government is now prepared to share responsibility.

Proposals include using revenues from customs houses in southern Persia as security against the loan, eliciting political agreement not to allow foreign road or railway construction projects in southern Persia, and a plan for the Indian Government to purchase a large stake in the Imperial Bank of Persia in order to facilitate similar loans in the future.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Bank of Iran</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Russian Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Loans</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0000f9#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
