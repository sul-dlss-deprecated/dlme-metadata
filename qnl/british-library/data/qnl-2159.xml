It should be suggested to him that it would be in his own interests to choose lesser of two evils and agree to meet Iraqi wishes over suppression of smuggling in order if possible that some comprehensive settlement might be arrived at between him and Iraq which would at least provide for continuance of legitimate trade and make it help for His Majesty's Government to bring about an earlier settle ment of date gardens question. ry yf 3.

The economic rate for motor transport in this part of the world is six annas a mile/ton, and Basra the nearest large town in Iraq, is 150 miles from Koweit. iSven goods conveyed by camel to i&gt;asra would cost Rupees forty per ton for transport only. The Ruler of Koweit could not be expected to forego customs dues (5^4) unless reciprocal arrangements for free or reduced, transit were made by Iraq, so that expense on account of Koweit customs must be added. Landing charges in Koweit, owing to the long distance carry by landing boat, and subsequent The Hobble Lt-Colonel, Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.^•, C.B.S., Political Resident in the Persian Gufl.man-handling, are high, being Rupees five per ton. Therefore to convey a ton from Koweit to Basra would cost between Rupees &amp;0/- and Rupees 60/-, which incidentally in the latter case is as much as is charged ^or transporting it from London to Koweit. Whereas the Basra Port dues on merchandise landed at ^asra is about Rupees four per ton and landing charges are ten fils per bag or twenty fils per case. Moreover, I am informed by the Agent of Gray Mackenzie and Company and the British India Steam Navigation Company and the Strick Line Steamers, that the cost of transporting a ton from Karachi, CI.?. Basra or C.I.F. Koweit is exactly the same for either place. I am therefore forced to the conclusion that merchants are unlikely to see advantage in the suggested divergence of goods for Iraq via Koweit. Indeed had there been any advantage, I have no doubt that it would have already discovered, and merchants, Iraqi ana Koweiti been legitimately importing their goods that way, before now. 5&gt; i have thought that it might be as well to make the impossibility of legitimate trading of imported goods from Koweit to Iraq quite clear, as it seems, from various remarks I hear, that the idea is gaining ground that Koweit could trade legitimately, but will not. Nothing could be more untrue than that legitimate trade of imported goods from Koweit to Basra is possible, or that Koweitis prefer selling to Iraqis smugglers to legitimate trade. On the contrary I am constantly being asked by His Highness the Ruler and the merchants 01 Koweit what news I have for them about the end of the Saudi Blockade, to which all, without exception look forward, to X/0. t CJ.c^ 3 i ^ CL\&gt;. io P'^'$1- 111 ' / i/v nhbS (47/2/58) British Embassy, Bagdad 8th January, 1938 &amp;-V \ Sir t With reference to Mr. Garoe s express letter No. 728-S of 1937 dated October 21st last, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith, the names and other particulars of the two tribesmen who were arrested in July 1937 near Busaiyah on a charge of smuggling, which have 'been given to me 'by the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 2.

It will toe seen that the ira ^i Government maintain that after careful enquiry have established that this encounter occurred within Iraqi territory and th .it the/ advance the theory that the e^uipmant, blood, cartridges and other evidence found at Idairat al xlullah within iCo^eiti territory were traces, mt of the fight itself, but of a halt mde by the smugglers after they had retreated across tiie frontier into iCoweit. I am unahle from here to form an independent judgment on this clash of evidence, although there seerna to me to be some force in the Iraqi contention that their police would have collected the fallen equipraent if they had actually been on the spot. But in view of the fact that, so far as I am aware, five months have elapsed without any repetition of the incident, I am inclined to doubt whether the affair, even on the worst construction, indicates thit the Iraqi Government have a regular plan of amed infiltration into Ko^eiti territory to catch simigglers before they reach the frontier* £t0 ight Honourable The Viscount Halifax, £.3., a«CU$«I., &amp;.C. etc*, etc*, etciMlrfWHl KHGLOSm® m BAmAD DESPATCH Ml iM OF 26, 1938, If o» 4550/^475/10 &gt; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Bagdad» Sord March, 1938. r, ha ^ iniBtr:/ of Forei^m Affairs present their eoirpliments to Bin Britannic Ma^eaty^ Kofeaaay, Bagdad, and? with reference to tha correspond an ce and in c with the Hiniatry*^ nnt# Mo. 15651 dated lath Daceaiber, 19S7, have the honcnr* to state that t^ia Xr^oi authorities concerned lent the qxieation thf ; tr refill attention, an- issued inatructiora for strict encmiriea to be carried out on the snb t 1ect, fha Ministry e.xplni.n below the manlt of theae enqvti ri ea; - X* In the f^venin^ of 15th October, 1937, Iraqi patrol motor gbvb Mos. 11 and 15 met at a place called , A1 Bat in f , wit nin Iraqi territory* aouth west of Sftf «en and at a distance of 100 kilorietres from the latter pl ^ace, a caravan of smugglers with a nwrt)er of camel a loaded with good© in the course of eemggling. hen the patrol came close to the caravan the amug&amp;lera opened fire at thera, and consequently a clash took place bot^een the t^o parties which resulted in the flight to Kowelti territory of the smugglers who left behind a wounded man by the name of Mutair bin Snaitan, 87 cawols, three tone of goods, and three Knglish rifle®. 2. as to the occurrence of the incident within Iraqi territory, this is proved by the careful enquiries undertaken at the place of the incident by the following bodiesi* (a) Inspecting Officer of Customs and Kxoise, Basra, and ) olice Station House Officer, Eubair.

It appears froi?? the reports prepared toy the above mentioned bodie? # ae a result of the enquiries undertaken b# them that the incident toolc place at 'Bhu 'aib al Batin* where were found, in several places, traces of blood in the form of black patches. Th re were also fovaid clear traces of motor car wheels in the form of circles from which it is observed that motor cars ware driven several times around and within the place of the incident* There were also found in the same place camel refuse nd ompty cartridge© etc., which prove that a caravan had encamped for eome time in that place.

Pie revived the proposal that the Iraqi Government should take over control of the Koweiti customs, impose the Iraqi tariff and compensate the Shaikh for whatever he might lose through such an arrangement. I made little or no comment other than to say that I would consider the matter. I see now from the Embassy archives that similar suggestions were put forward 'by the Iraqi Government so long ago as 1932 # The Shaikh, however, v/as obstinately evasive and avoided giving a direct reply. In the early part of 1934 an effort was made to persuade him to send a representative to a conference at which inter alia ideas of this kind were to be discussed, but he wriggled out at the last moment and the conference was abandoned. In the autumn of the same year two highly-placed Iraqi officials visited the Shaikh and discussed the same proposals with him, but he was quite unable to accept them # Variations of the same proposals were put forward once again by the Embassy in February 1935, but the Foreign ' p 1 * ^ Hhiy «.«y • Office, in their telegram No. 77 of March 1st, 1935, indicated that they were open to the gravest objections from the political point of view, 'since they would lead to the acquisition by Iraq of a degree of influence in Koweiti affairs which is quite incompatible with the declared policy of His Majesty's Government as regards the independence of Koweit. w Baggallay, Esq, In/8 In these circumstances, it does not seem that it is possible to offer to Taufiq Suwaidi any hope that his idea could be received favourably either in London or Koweit and, subject to any suggestions which you may care to make, 1 think that the only thing I can say to him is that His Majesty's Government are still trying hard to have the Saudi blockade of Koweit raised and that, once this has been achieved, there is good reason to hope that smuggling from Koweit into Iraq will be really stopped (see paragraph 5 of Kendel 's letter to Olar^c Kerr dated Koweit, February 22nd 1937, a copy of which was sent to you with •- V-J-' ^ v Clarl: Kerr's letter (54/30 /37) of March let, 1937). I have sympathy with the Iraqi point of view in the matter of smuggling from Koweit. Iraq is put to a lot of trouble and expense maintaining frontier control, and the continuance of smuggling embitters Traqo-Koweiti relations and alternately Iraqo-Eritish relations for we have a special position in regard to both the countries concerned.

Subject:- Smuggling of arms from Kuwait into Iraq. , 10 Memorandum. yr Reference your Memorandum No,G/282 of 28th April 1958. It is true that owing to the distribution of last winter* s rainfall there are larger numbers of Nejdi Bedouins all armed, in the Iraq Southern Desert, and in the Saudi- Iraq Neutral Zone this year than there have ever been before in the memory of man. (A detailed list of these tribesmen ■ -many are from the far side of Arabia- and their locations will be given in my Intelligence Summary for the period , 'S* ^ ' t C- *• ending 30th May) v c It is also, I hear, now incontrovertibly proved in the last few weeks, that arms are being moved up from Hejd northwards, as I suggested in my Intelligence Summary No.10 of 1936, Para 95, was at times the case. The local Kuwait authorities however maintain that there is no such smuggling from Kuwait, and I have not received any report to substantiate this, or the many former statements from Iraq, that it exists. 3. Kuwait is a well known name, and a lively political topic in Iraq, in which no doubt some politicians would like to see it incorporated, and therefore I believe that the report, like others from Iraq may be found to be unsubstantiated, and that the arms traffic from Nejd is attributed to Kuwait for these reasons i.e. Iraqi ( it OI / h Afn J g .3£C: -2- politics, ignorance about other centres in Nejd, and of desert economics# 4» Moreover if Saudi Arabians are smuggling arms out y am*****-*' ' » , of Nejd it would of course suit them to let it be thought that the arms come from Kuwait in order to turn away attention from the true source. 5. Kuwait is certainly not the source of an abnormal arms traffic, and as I have previously pointed out the greatest import of arms into Arabia takes place at Jedda, and other places on the Red Sea Coast, where there is no British control of arms imports as in the Persian Gulf, 6. A computation and comparison of the number of arms imported annually into Arabia (a) via the Red Sea ports and (b) via the Persian Gulf will I believe give a very different and remarkable result. 7. Apart from this it would seem useless to try to investigate a general report of this nature, completely at variance with the information available locally, without some facts to go on, - places, dates and names of people or tribes engaged. Perhaps the Royal Air Force Intelligence Department, could obtain a report in greater detail?.

Reference India letter No•P.Z.2929/28 of 5rd May 1958, My comment is as follows. The whole incident took place at Idairat al Kullah. v3. 2. Reference Para 5 of the Iraqi note. The Iraqi police had evidently detached a man, from the cars, to drive the smugglers camels, but the arranging and loading of camels takes sane time, and many loads had to be abandoned by the police as they were distributed over a wide area - where they had dropped from the panic-stricken animals as they galloped about during the firing. It was these fallen loads that I found, and which, I think, the cars I reported as seeing approaching from the North, had come to fetch. 3. The witnesses I had with me, the actual smugglers, taken back to the place, and questioned as . r j they were by me, seperately, could not have concerted their story, and they have not' the histrionic ability necessary, to convince me as they aid, of the truth of their account, had it been untrue. ? 4. Even the places where men had lain firing for some time were clear e.g. a little dip behind a bush, ( u ^ \) ■-2- where would be half a dozen empty cartridge oases, a torn piece of shirt, with which, when wounded, the firer had stemmed his blood. One man told me that he had dropped a revolver in a certain spot, and he went off to find it, which he did, another went to look for other objects, he had lost in the fight, a small bag with tobacco, and so on. 5. It is impossible to believe that these men had merely rested on the spot, and had then deliberately planted all these objects to prove, on the off chance that the Political Agent would come out to visit the scene, and with nothing to their gain by so doing, that a fight had taken place there. They had many details to give, as men just out of a fight always have# 6. In my opinion, which was supported by that of a Commander in the Royal Navy, there is not the least doubt that a fight took place between the Iraqi Police and Iraqi smugglers at Idairat al Kulla in Kuwait territory. 7. Incidentally 'The Shuaib al Batin', given as the scene by the Iraqi officials, is a vague term, and not the name of the place. Shuaib means ^the little confluence**, and Shuaib al Batin merely anywhere on either slope of the Batin valley, where its confluents run after rain. It would be interesting to know where exactly the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs places ohuaib al Batin?. 8. That the Geographical knowledge of the officials concerned is weak, seems disclosed by the reference to the meeting 'at a place called al Batin within Iraqi territory', since al Batin is not a place, but the great and well known water course which, rising near Medina, runs the whole length of the Iraq-Kuwait frontier, except near Safwan, andftn, . v •. t\&gt; ^06 f/ a ri -3- yt is generally speaking, half in Kuwait and half in Iraq. 9. In addition and with reference to Para 3 of the Ministry's note I point out, with reserve, that the respect for frontiers therein mentioned may, I fear, in the case of junior Customs police officials on the frontier, be offset by tne temptation to capture contreband, for which a reward is offered, and in the sale of which at Zubair, if I am not misled by my informants, there is considerable financial profit to the Customs Police. The non arrest of the smugglers would seem, if anything to prove the contrary to the deduction made by the Ministry. Captain, Political Agent, Kuwait.81 No . 409/1/58.

For some years past the Iraqi Government have continued to oring accusations of arms smuggling against Kuwait, hitherto without producxri; an/ evictence whatsoever. In fact, in November 1936 Haj i Asil, the foreign Minister of Iraq, who had visited Kuwait, declared to the Political Agent, tnat after discussion witn tne shaiKh, he was convinced that the Mutasarrif of Basra's report, and other reports about arms ^ere eutirely (Signature) erroneous.^ if S. 14.

Since that date the Iraq Groverniaent have a^ain occasionally brought up the accusation of arms smuggling against Kuwait, but as usual without any eviaenoe in support of their allegations* 4. Captain de Gaury in his memorandum states, briefly, that there is no smuggling from Kuwait as alleged in your Intelligence Summary quoted above. On the o-cner nand he points out that there are larger numbers of Hejdi bedouin, all armed, in the Iraq Southern insert ana in the Sauai- Iraq Meutral Zone than ever before in the memory of man, and that it is not unlikely that Saudi JU^abs are engaged in smuggling arms through Kuwait territory. In this connection fa 1 Captain de Gaury's remark (paragraph 6 of his letter) as to the number of arms imported into Arabia via the Red Sea ports is of interest. D. I entirely concur with Gapxain ae Gaury's „ Mu remarks in paragraph 7 of his letter, that it is quite impossible to investigate a report of this nature without some facts to work on.

Y Sir, I.CU &gt; I have the honour to reply to your letter 342-S dated 7th June, 1958, animadverting to an item in the Intelligence Summary, produced by Air Headquarters British Forces in 'Iraq, dated March, 1938 and referring to the question of the smuggling of arms into 'Iraq via Kuwait territory. ^ ^ y 2. The reports, on which this particular para graph was based, were received from a variety of sources, normally considered of good reliability and all in close touch with tribal affairs in the Southern Desert of 'Iraq. Bone of them suggested that the arms had orig inated in Kuwait, or were dealt wit h by Kuwa iti middle men, but all stated categorically that these arms, presumably in transit from Sa'udi Araoia, had passed through Kuwait territory. 3. These reports are precised below;- (a) Report dated 17/2/38 states that on 6/2 a caravan of Hussainat and Ghazzi tribesmen returned from Mr'' Kuwait with 400 rifles. Two members of the Hussainat were arrested, and six rifles confiscated by the 'Iraqi police. (b) Report dated 19/3/38 states that a large consign- ^ ment of rifles had been smuggled through Kuwait, and had arrived in the Muntafiq for distribution 'W to the Shuraifat, Budur, ana Jawarin. (c) Report dated 12/4/38 states a large caravan arrived Samawa, having come through Kuwait and thence via ^OTTalmiya, with a large number of rifles and other smuggled goods. The caravan was in charge of Dhafir and Az Zaiyad tribesmen; the date of its arrival at Samawa being given as 4/4/38. (d) On the same date 200 rifles with ammunition were seized by the 'Iraqi police near Luqait; these were likewise reported to have arrived via Kuwait. Official confirmation of this report was not obtainable. 4. Under existing conditions in 'Iraq, it will be readily understood that it is no longer possible for us to investigate the veracity of these reports through official 'Iraqi sources without danger of compromising our own intelligence system. Agents are interrogated in person, but there is no possible cross-check on the accuracy of their information. /5 The Honourable Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, The Residency, Bushire.5. In paragraph 4 of your above-quoted letter, you state that the P.A. at Kuwait admiLs the possibility of arms having been smuggled by Najdis through Kuwait territory. We have not exceeded paragraph o± our March Smmmary o^| now under discussion. this statement in the 'ntelligence, which is Efforts are now being made to obtain the in formation askea for in paragraph 5 (sub-paras, (a) to (e)), but I doubt if it will be possible to do so since nothing is more difficult to keep tracic of than the ram ifications of the arms traffic among the tribesmen of the Southern Liwas of 'Iraq, The paragraph of the Intelligence Summary was intended to, and did, emphasise the fact that arms were being imported into 'Iraq in very large quantities; that the tribes v/ere re-arming; ana that this constitutes a potential danger to the 'Iraqi government, in view of the weak administrative control in the majority of the Southern Liwas. If the reports that arms have been pass ing through Kuwait can be disproved by the responsible authorities in Kuwait, bearing in mina the known laxity of police control along the Kuwait—'Iraq frontier, we shall be free to prosecute subsequent investigations over a much more limited area. The Samawa rifle market was reported as particularly active aur''m and, ii the possibility of arms reaching 'Iraq via Kuwait is ruled out, it may be possible to trace their origin to either HAIL or JAUF.

Sunder Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. |refer- political Agent, Kuwait. Hence. Subj ect s Alleged smuggling of arms from Kuwait into Iraq. ^th reference to your letter Mo.S. 10815/6/Air I, dated the 23th June 1938, I have the following comments to offer. 2* It ig&gt; quite correct of course, as pointed out by you that, in the paragraph of your March Summary of Intelligenc- under discussion, it was stated that the arms la question had passed through KMwait ,|i. e. did not emanate frm that State. In viev/^however of the importance which the Ambassador attached to your summary I considered it . ole t j Vi £ :v:. the matter investigated as fully as possible, and it was withthis purpose in view that I put the long questionnaire, contained in paragraph 5 of my Express Letter ab.542-3 of 7uu June. ^situation as shown by your reports appears to (Signature) be ^ s (Designation) M^P 1374 S&amp;P—(M-2043)—15-1-SO—10,00!).be as sumarized in paxagrapii 2 of your letter, *irone of them suggested that the arms had originated in Kuwait, or were dealt with by Kuwaiti middlemen, but all stated oategorically that these arms, pre sumably in transit from Sa'udi Arabia, had passed through KUwait territory,« Even admitting for the moment that these arms pass through Kuwait territory, nobody in Kuwait, from the Shaikh downwards, obtains any profit from this traffic, or is in any way engaged in it. The responsible quarter appears to be the Saudi Government, whose duty it is to stop this smuggling. In this connection I should like to emphasise the remark made at the end of paragraph 4 of my Express iDetter quoted above, as to the number of arms imported into Saudi Arabia via the Red Sea Ports. It would be interesting to know the numbers of such arms, and to what extent they are for the legitimate use of the Saudi Govern ment. It seems to me personally that with the information ^rhicii must be in their possession, as well as in yours, as to this traffic in arms from Saudi Arabia, the Iraq Government might be well advised to make a strong protest to the Saudi authorities. This however is of course a matter which is outside my sphere. 4 * I do not understand, however, why this traffic in arms should go at all through EDuwait, except perhaps in very small quantities. a glance at the map of northern Arabia will show that Kuwait territory covers only a small triangle in the north-east corner. The main routes, which the gun runners must confine themselves to in order to find water, from such Saudi areas as those of, Aniza ,Boreida, Hail/0./ -3- ^ 7/ r ... . / Hail ©to., to the places mentioned by you on the ' Suphratest such as Samawa, and the Muntafiq area, pass well to the west of Kuwait territory. I do not see therefore why the gun runners should proceed some hundreds of miles out of their way for the purpose of passing through Kuwait territory. fi 5. another point which I do not understand is why the Iraqi authorities themselves do not ta)ce more active measures to deal with the gun running, especially since some at least of the gun runners are actually Iraqi tribes men (e.g. the A£ Zaiyad, paragraph 3(c) of your letter, Hussainat and Ghazai» paragraph 3( a) of your letter). The Iraqi - Saudi frontier is of course of considerable extent, but as the gun runners approach their destination, e .g. Samawa, they enter territory which presumably is under the control of the local Iraqi authorities. 6. I note, vide paragraph 6 of your letter, that efforts are being made to obtain the information asked for in paragraph 5 of my questionnaire. I quite realize however, as you point out, that this may be impossible. 7. To sum up. A. There is no traffic in arms from iCuwait into Iraq. This is precisely what the then Foreign Minister of Iraq stated in November 1936, and is what I have always maintained. I trust that all concerned will now be able to accept this as a definite fact. B. There appears to be a brisk trade in arms from . 3audi Arabia into Iraq. This, however, is outside my sphere.c. Reports received by you state that traffic under B passes ttirough Kuwait• In vlew^however, of the reasons given in my paragraph 4 above, subject to any other evidence which can be pro duced, I must maintain that this is not the case. 3d.

Prom the tent they pointed out the scene, 'Hadr as Saihad Hadha' (just below the dune over there). After the raid some of the Muntafiq had come to their camp for the night. 4. Tilth regard to the case which I had set out to investigate, they added the information that the light which the Police fired had set fire to the dried grass.

The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs may have given some indication of at least one strong motive for Iracti interest in Koweit when he asked me yesterday if it was true that of a population of about 50,000 some 20 ,000 were Iranians and whether the latter had objected to the Shaikh's new Council. I said that I could not answer hi® off hand, but having looked things u I told him, when I happened to sea him this morning, that I found that there were about 20,000 Iranians in Koweit and that it was true that a certain amount of absolutely insincere agitation against the Council h u been got up among some of them by a certain disgruntled official. and view with the utmost concern any signs of Iranian penetration on the Arabian side of the Gulf. return from seeing him last week, I had had a good look at the map and had made a few informal inquiries on my own about smuggling. It seemed to me, from study of the map and from talking to people who had been down there, that the prevention of smuggling through Al Batin, where whole armies could hide, was an almost superhuman task.

It is not possible for the Political Agent, Kuwait, to make any useful further enquiry. The Intelligence Report Ho.72 - Diwaniyah - is dated Basrah 17th July 1938 and the India Office coiamunication under reference was not received by ua until the 15th September, i.e. 2 months later. The correct people to make enquiries would seem to be the Iraq authorities and it is to them that the report might have been sent in the first instance, but perhaps the Rqyal Air force do not care to pass on their information to the Iraqis. If the Report is correct, including the ^squaring 11 of the A.O.P.Safuan, then it confirms the opinion which I have 7'/ always held (e.g. paragraph 6 of my Express Letter $0,427-3, dated the 21 st July 19 38) that some of the local Iraqi officials are hand in glove with the gun-runners. Safwan, as you are aware, is the headquarters of the Special Iraq Frontier Customs Police on the Iraqi-Kuwait frontier. There are there some 10 cars, mobile wireless outfits, and a remarkable natural feature, the Jebal Sanan, which gives observation in daylight for a considerable distance. It does not seem to me likely therefore that thi« point should have been ohosen by the gun runners near which to smuggle the^r arms. iit ^ ' j- Ssquire, M.O., , Tae India Office, Jiondon. ^ / ■ ■ f ! 1 3./3.

With reference to that part of the conversation which dealt with Kuwait 1 have the following comments to offer. * Mr. .Baxter referred to the reference in Taufiq Suwaidi 1 s aide-memoire to Kuwait as a centre for extensive arms traffic and smuggling. He would like to consider, in the first place, the statement that there was an important illegal traffic in arms into Iraq. Hitherto, he believed. His Majesty's Government had not received any evidence to show that any such smuggling of arms was, in fact, taking place. In fact, the British authorities in the Persian Gulf seemed to be fairly sure that no arms were now entering Kuwait, at all events by sea. He asked whether the Iraqi Government were able to produce any evidence to show that smuggling of arms did, in fact, take place through Kuwait.* With regard to the sentence: *The British authorities in the Persian Gulf seemed to be fairly sure that no arms were now entering Kuwait, at all events by sea. 11 The British authorities / ?eel Isquire, M.O., Tine India Office, London*j bUr. 3 : ■, ^ r t rj. ■ zUuk • » • Li I 'J mi v ^ii . t -2- authorities in question consist of the Senior Maval Officer and iayaelf» The Senior Haval Officer was certain that very few if any -f.si arms enter Kuwait by sea - vide Admiralty letter to the Foreign Office, tfo.M,03097/38, dated the 4th August 1938. I am equally certain that no arms ^re smuggled from Kuwait to Iraq by land - ^h c \ yide my Impress Letter H0.427-S, dated the 21st July 1938, to the Air officer commanding, British forces in Iraq, especially para graph 7 in which X summed up the situation. In these circum stances could not the Gulf case have been put a little stronger ? |hat I feel is that unless our case is put strongly the Iraqi (Jovernment will continue to return to the charge with their customary vague accusations for which they can produce no proof. 3 # * Maj or Sdmonds added that, to his personal knowledge, as a result of his conversations with Iraqi tribesmen, it was quite a frequent occurrence for an .Arab to buy a rifle in Kuwait for £ 5 or £ 6 and to travel with it to Iraq, where he would sell it for about twice that amount. The fact was that Kuwait had become a recognised market where Arabs, whether would-be smugglers or not, went to purchase arms. He was quite prepared to believe that the British authorities in the Persian ^ulf were right when they said that no anas entered Kuwait by sea, but it was absolutely certain that somehow or other these arms were available for sale in Kuwait.* You will see that Edmonds seized upon the point that no and implied arms entered Kuwait by sea, ^OJS^iWg^that arms did enter by iand. lith regard to the rest of his remarks. I have no doubt that he is perfectly correct in stating that an odd rifle or two can now and then be picked up at Kuwait. It is not this,however,against which / I^ vi ; ; , • ■ I -s- whioh the Irakis complain but against a regular traffic on a large soala from Kuwait. Edmonds 1 implication that Kuwait to.?n Is now a t&amp;riring arms traffic centre is entirely without founda tion* • V 4. With regard to other forms of smuggling. ^ Mr. Baxter informed His r^xcelleiacy that Hie Majesty^ (Jorerranent had, in fact t received an expert report, from which it appeared that the Iraqi authorities might be able to give smuggling frcm ICuwait a decisive blow if they were to taice certain additional measures, e.g., control by aeroplanes and armoured oars, together with drastic measures against those organisations or individuals in Iraq who must be assisting in smuggling on such a large scale as had been suggested by His Excellency.* I was glad to see that Baxter pressed the point that the Iraqi Oovernraent should take anti-smuggling measures in Iraq itself. These measures the Iraqi Oovemment could easily put into practice but refuse to do. In this connection please see paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of my letter Ho.316 -3, dated the 27th March 1937, to Olark Kerr. You will see that Edmonds himself, Sargon of the Iraq Police and UaJ i al Asil, the Iraqi foreign Minister, were all of the opinion that the Iraqi authorities could take certain anti-smuggling measures behind the lines in Iraq itself. In point of fact the Iraqi authorities have taken A -C J:: I ij ■ ^ ! • U»j. U no such measures. , . ^j v | if ■ ^ ^ ^ M J)-' I presume that the w expert report 11 is that of #ard given in Bagdad Savingram No»140, dated the 4th December 1937, to the foreign Office. It has always been the line of the Iraqi Govern- ment /ii mm /■33 : 5 . — 4* GoTemment that they could not stop the smggling except by Fjf meaaures which are prohibitively expensive, t In this connection please see paragraph 13 of my letter Ko ,a64 -3 # dated the llth Horember 1935, to the India Office. The position as it appears to me is that the Iraqi Government can well deal with the L - '■ smuggling by the employjaent of a few armed cara t as they are doing i ^ ii ■ at present^assisted by measures behind the lines which they refuse to put into operation. 6m I must confess that after our unfortunate experience over the tea question 1 am inclined to suspect the Iraqi Government of exaggeration in their statements of losses from smuggling. In that case the Iraqi Government stated that the import of ^smuggled* 1 tea from India into Iraq via i^uwait was ^paralysing 11 the tea trade in Iraq. te accordingly took the matter up with the Shaikh of Kuwait who imposed an embargo on the tea in question into his State. The Iraqi Government took no steps whatever to prevent the tea entering into Iraq. The consequence was that dhows instead of landing tea at Kuwait merely landed it at Basra. By his embargo both the Shaikh of Kuwait and ourselves were unpopular locally (vide correspondence ending with my letter $o # ■ 'PCt l^| v / 503, dated the 18th larch 1933,to Metcalfe). f' P ^ ^ 6? ] fj j'.fO J. ! , tT.-: v tU 1 fir ii 'n ah' : ' IS 1;: til; («: ■j tt-im' ; , ki! v soil: ■1/7 !, ' ' ^ nf'' T 3-' ' lla OVii /'• I * I am sending copies of this letter to Peterson, Metcalfe and de Gaury.

[E 5841/1982/93] Copy No. [Amended Copy.] Record of Conversation with the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs held at the Foreign Office at 6 p.m. on October 4, 1938. Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs. Major Edmonds (British adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior). Mr. Baxter, Foreign Office. Mr. Crosthwaite, Foreign Office. Mr. Baxter enquired whether the Iraqi Foreign Minister wished to begin by discussing in detail the matters which formed the subject of the aide-memoire handed by his Excellency to Mr. Butler at Geneva, or whether there were any other matters arising out of that morning's conversation with the Secretary of State which his Excellency wished to discuss. The Iraqi Foreign Minister said that he would like to discuss in detail the subjects dealt with in his aide-memoire. Aerodrome Guards. As regards the question of aerodrome guards, Taufiq Suwaidi referred to the delay which had taken place in giving effect to article 4 of the annexure to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of Alliance. It was true that various proposals had been made since the entry into force of that treaty in 1932, but some of these proposals were not in accordance with the provisions or the intention of the treaty. Discus sions had taken place at Bagdad in 1935, and a certain measure of agreement had been reached, but there were still two outstanding points on which the views of His Majesty's Government had never been received. It was with a view to providing a solution of the whole problem that he had now suggested that the aerodrome guards should be detached either from the regular Iraqi army (in which case the commanding officer would be a British officer attached to the British military mission) or from the Iraqi police. In either case, the Iraqi military or police forces would be placed under the control of the British Air Officer Commanding, and in addition, if the forces were to be provided by the Iraqi army, there would be a British commanding officer. He thought that a solution on these lines would be entirely in accordance with the treaty. Mr. Boater drew attention to the provisions of the treaty article, stating that the special guards should be provided 1 upon such conditions as may be agreed upon between the high contracting parties,' and that the Iraqi Government would '' secure the enactment of such legislation as might be necessary for the fulfilment of the conditions referred to above.' Various efforts had been made to reach agreement as to the nature of this legislation to be introduced by the Iraqi Government. The last proposals, it would be recalled, had been handed to the Iraqi Government by Sir M. Peterson in May last. It did not appear that the Iraqi Government had yet replied to that communication, and it was there fore only now that His Majesty's Government learnt that these proposals were unacceptable to the Iraqi Government. As regards the proposals now put forward by Taufiq Suwaidi, it was regretted that neither was entirely welcome to the British authorities concerned. The main difficulty was, to speak perfectly frankly, the problem of the control of these aerodrome guards. His Excellency had stated that they would be under the control of the Air Officer Commanding, but in certain respects these guards,, being part of the Iraqi military or police forces, would also be under the direct control of the Iraqi Government. It seemed to the British authorities concerned that this divided control might lead to difficulties and disputes between the British Present: [430 e—2] B. and Iraqi authorities, which it would be in the best interests ot both the British and Iraqi Governments if possible to avoid. . , 1 His Majesty's Government, however, realised the dimeulties m the way of reaching* an agreed settlement on the lines hitherto followed, and had therefore been givin o ' active consideration to an entirely difierent solution oi tne problem, which, if it proved practicable, would no doubt be welcome to the Iraqi Govern-fP' 1 ® ment; that was that His Majesty's Government should waive their right to ask the Iraqi Government to provide special guards, and that the Royal Air Force should themselves provide for their own ground defence without maintaining the present levies or any other force composed of Iraqi subjects. Before definite proposals to this effect could be made, however, various practical difficulties would L have to be examined. During a recent tour of the Middle East undertaken by the Under-Secretary of State for Air, a senior officer of the Air Ministry accompanied him to discuss this problem with the authorities in Iraq, but unfortunately, ow T ing to the international crisis, they had to be recalled when they had got as far as Palestine. But the British authorities would continue to consider the question as rapidly as possible. Taufiq Suwaidi said that this was an entirely new suggestion, and he could not say how the Iraqi Government would regard it. He would at once telegraph to Bagdad and might possibly receive some indication of the Iraqi Government's views in the course of a day or tw r o. forab ii$i ® arm the P el ' s but it f ale in ^ jt.Wet* jovern# 11 ] tions would ia t in Musca 'ialwarehou Registration of Land Occupied hy the Port of Basra. The Foreign Office representatives regretted that they were not yet in a position to discuss this problem, and that if it proved impossible to give his Excellency a reply before he left London a reply w 7 ould, in any case, be sent to him at Bagdad at an early date. Taufiq Suwaidi said he was sure that, if the Iraqi Government repaid the outstanding instalment of the port loan, there could be no objection to registering the land in the name of the Irani Government. He hoped that it miffht even be ;ls ear ;, e ] sai . r • f r* ' ' . , 0 . - .

This di( itw, since such ai feleioweitmig it«, possible for His Majesty's Government to agree to his proposal without insisting upon the immediate repayment of the loan. Such a gesture on their part would be much appreciated in Iraq. Koweit. (The Secretary of State, in the course of his meeting with the Iraqi Foreign Minister in the morning of the 4th October, had told his Excellency that His Majesty's Government would find it difficult to admit any Iraqi claim, if the Iraqi Government were ever to put fonvard such a claim, to sovereignty over Koweit ; and the Iraqi Foreign Minister had agreed not to insist on discussing this point, to which a reference had been made in the aide-memoire w^hich he had communicated as a basis for discussion.) Mr. Ztawtfer-referred to the reference in Taufiq Suwaidi's aide-memoire to Koweit as a centre for extensive arms traffic and smuggling. He would like to consider, in the first place, the statement that there was an important illegal traffic in arms into Iraq. Hitherto, he believed, His Majesty's Government had not received any evidence to show that any such smuggling of arms was, in fact, taking place. In fact, the British authorities in the Persian Gulf seemed to be fairly sure that no arms were now entering Koweit, at all events by sea. He asked whether the Iraqi Government were able to produce any evidence to show that smuggling of arms did, in fact,- take place through Koweit. Taufiq Suwaidi replied that the Iraqi Government were convinced that arms smuggling from Koweit into Iraq had, in fact, assumed serious proportions, and he thought that the Iraqi Government could produce evidence of this. He was, in any case, quite certain that arms were on sale in Koweit in large quantities and at very cheap prices, and that there was nothing to prevent 'anyone who liked from buying arms freely in the open market and trying to smuggle them across the Iraqi frontier. Ma]or Edmonds added that, to his personal knowledge, as a result of his conversations with Iraqi tribesmen, it was quite a frequent occurrence for an Arab to buy a rifle in Koweit for £5 or £6 and to travel with it to Iraq, where m postal admi lie political posit: if tl iitration.

The fact was that Koweit had become a recognised market where Arabs, whether would-be smugglers or not, went to purchase arms. He was quite prepared to believe that the British authorities in the Persian Gulf were right when they said that no arms entered Koweit by sea, but it was absolutely certain that somehow or other these arms were available for sale in Koweit. Mr. Baxter said that His Majesty's Government would certainly be prepared to give the whole question their earnest attention if the Iraqi Government would, in fact, be good enough to produce all the evidence in their possession. At a later stage in the discussion. Major Edmonds suggested that His Majesty's Government might be prepared to consider a solution whereby substan tial restrictions would be placed on the sale of arms in the Koweiti market. He thought that in Muscat, before the war, His Majesty's Government had insisted that all the arms available for sale in that territory should be collected and stored in one special warehouse under Government supervision, and that the sale of these arms should be subjected to some form of Government control. He suggested that some such system in Koweit might be the most effective method of dealing with the situation which had arisen. Mr. Baxter said that this suggestion would receive further consideration. As regards other forms of smuggling, Mr. Baxter wished to point out in the first place that it was really entirely for the Government of a country to see that smuggling into its territory did not take place. The Iraqi Foreign Minister had put forward three suggestions. The first was for a customs union between Iraq and Koweit. This did not seem to His Majesty's Government to be an acceptable solution, since such an arrangement between a large State like Iraq and a small State like itoweit might be expected to undermine the independence of the smaller State. Taufiq Suwaidi said that he did not think that there was much foundation for this fear. He said that for many years now the Iraqi authorities had run the Koweiti postal administration. This had not, he thought, made any difference to the political position of the sheikhdom, and he did not see why it should make any difference if the Iraqi authorities also took over the Koweiti customs administration. Koweit would, of course, be offered a fixed annual sum in lieu of its present customs revenue. He thought that the Koweitis themselves would be very ready to accept such a suggestion. Mr. Baxter said that the Iraqi Foreign Minister's second suggestion, that the northern frontier line of Koweit should be fixed further south so as to give the Iraqi preventive services more space in which to operate, seemed also to be unacceptable. This suggestion would apparently involve the cession to Iraq of about one-third of Koweit, and it was difficult to see what compensation could be given to the sheikh elsewhere. Taufiq Suwaidi said that, if the suggestion of a customs union between Iraq and Koweit were found to be possible, it would not be necessary further to consider this alternative. Mr. Baxter proceeded that, as regards the Iraqi Foreign Minister's third solution, he understood that the proposal of combined preventive operations hac already been put forward some months ago. The Sheikh of Koweit had stated on that occasion that he was willing to negotiate with the Iraqi Government w en he had reached an agreement with the Saudi Government regarding the raising of their blockade. These negotiations had been proceeding fairly satistactorily of late. Taufiq Suwaidi interjected that he did not see what these negotiations between Koweit and Saudi Arabia had to do with Iraq. In reply to the question whether the Iraqi Government had any special measures in mind m connexion with the proposed anti-smuggling agreement with Koweit, Taunq Suwaidi seemed to think that it might be possible to induce the sheikh, who had no armoured cars, &amp;c., to contribute to the proposed joint preventive operations, to share the cost of these operations. It was pointed out to him that the sheikh w ou d no be likely to agree to any such proposal. [430 e—2] B 2 f 7. &gt;1 'rj ; • SO r U ■j I 'li! -'I i M i hm \m • j.Mr. Baxter informed his Excellency that His Majesty's Government had, in fact, received an expert report, from which it appeared that the Iraqi authorities might be able to give smuggling from Koweit a decisive blow if they were to take certain additional measures, e.g., control by aeroplanes and armoured cars together with drastic measures against those organisations or individuals in Iraq who must be assisting in smuggling on such a large scale as had been suggested by his Excellency, | gS Taufiq Suwaidi thought that the Iraqi Government had already taken all such measures as were in their power. There were numbers of armoured cars troops and police engaged in anti-smuggling measures, and all this was involving the Iraqi Government in serious expenditure. The position apparently was that the Sheikh of Koweit would take no action whatever, because, of course, he had nothing to gain from doing so; on the contrary, he was, if anything, making a large profit, for a large part of the customs levied on goods entering Koweit (which might subsequently be smuggled into Iraq) went into his own pocket From the Iraqi point of view it was an unbearable situation. Major Edmonds suggested that the difficulty might be overcome if the Koweiti customs tariff were increased to the level of the Iraqi tariff. The main cause of the smuggling was that the Koweiti tariff was so low. He thought that possibly the Sheikh of Koweit was precluded from raising it by his treaties with His Majesty's Government. If it was impossible to agree to a customs union between the Sheikh of Koweit and the Iraqi Government, could it not at least be arranged that the two Administrations, even though remaining entirely independent, should impose the same tariff, i.e., the Iraqi tariff? long There d fies of ^ Jjl! jtMP 1 w sjiig frontier) w 1 aufiq Suwaidi added that in that case the Iraqi Government would no doubt wish to assure themselves that the higher tariff was being applied in Koweit in fact as well as in theory, and also that smuggling into Koweit was not taking place on a large scale. He thought that this difficulty might be overcome if an Iraqi customs official, perhaps one of the British officials attached to the Iraqi customs administration, could be attached to the Koweiti customs administration. Mr. Baxter undertook that this suggestion would be examined further. Iraqi Government's Wish for a new Port on the Persian Gulf. Mr. Baxter drew attention to the fear expressed by the Iraqi Foreign Minister lest there should be serious interference by Persia with navigation on the Shatt- el-Arab. He enquired the nature of the Iraqi Government's fears on this point. Surely they did not expect some hostile act on the part of Persia, at all events in peace-time ? Taufiq Suwaidi replied with references to the violent tendencies of Persian policy as directed by the present Shah. He referred to the difficulties that had already arisen with Persia regarding the Shatt-el-Arab, and to the use of that waterway by Persian warships. Mr. Baxter suggested that in time of peace it was improbable that Persian warships would commit hostile acts against Iraqi shipping using the waterway between Basra and the sea. buch an act of aggression seemed very unlikely, at least so long as the Anglo-Iraqi Alliance was maintained. In time of war, also, the Persian Government seemed to be unlikely to adopt a violently hostile attitude towards the British and Iraqi Governments, since they would be anxious to maintain the revenues resulting from their sales to us of Persian oil. On the other hand. His Majesty's Government fully appreciated the desire 2^, , Government to secure an additional commercial outlet on the sea. ey had no desire at all to stand in the way of such a proiect, and they had carefully gone mto the Iraqi Government's wishes. The information at the disposal of the British authorities concerned showed that Koweit itself was not sui a le tor development as a modern port, and such development would be very expensive, it would involve dredging on a large scale, and the construction of a ong breakwater, m addition to the provision of ordinary harbour works. Any other place m Koweit Bay would be even less suitable, since at present ships could not anchor nearer than 3 miles from the shore, and when the south-east wind blew lighterage would be impossible. On the other hand, Khor Abdullah appeared from the charts (which would, however, require confirmation, since they were based on a jt to decide exac ley wished the rbah ai iKdldhaveto: fould be desira sciifeaspossibl jjj quite evideii iffiton this que; Ir, tor re i approach si ifq Suwai a to approach 'itter private! reaeliiiig agree ter to the sheik iwold like to t a with the ki kEwterw i lie made th of!and or s Govern 5 t the T^i; W if a survey made so long ago as 1911), to be very well suited to development as a modern port.

' seemed t0 be much the b€st Slte from tl[ie P oint of view of tlle Iraqi Government. f %i ; Jts development would almost certainly be less expensive, and it would be nearer t he Iraqi railway system. The Iraqi Government would, therefore, do well, in the /first place, to examine the possibility of meeting their requirements by the con- e rs of Z struction of a port at Khor Abdullah. pIUV ^ Taufiq Suivaidi replied that the Iraqi Government would certainly examine 1 a Ppareiitl^ the possibilities of Khor Abdullah, but if they decided to develop a port on that J se 'of coi inlet they might require certain concessions from the Sheikh of Koweit, and they a *g, t would like to be assured in advance, before embarking upon any expenditure, &amp;c., entei that the Sheikh of Koweit would be prepared to agree to an alteration in the iflto his 0^ existing frontier, in so far as this might be necessary. U !■ Mr. Baxter suggested that first it would be necessary for the Iraqi Govern- ^rcoineiflj ment to decide exactly what they would have to ask from the Sheikh of Koweit. L Themaij If they wished the sheikh to cede to them a part of his territory, e.g., the small tM U ui island of Warbah and the navigable channel between that island and the open sea, treaties f they would have to make an offer to compensate him elsewhere. For this purpose ustomsmiioii it would be desirable that the Iraqi Government's offer should be made as tat least ic attractive as possible to the sheikh; it would be well that the compensation offered yindepeir should quite evidently exceed in value the territory which they were asking the sheikh to cede. Taujiq Suwaidi asked if he might get into direct touch with the Sheikh of Koweit on this question. Mr. Baxter replied that His Majesty's Government would prefer that any Jit be overt® : official approach should be made through them. Taufiq Suwaidi urged, nevertheless, that he might be allowed in the first items admit p lace to the Sheikh of Koweit, whom he knew personally, and discuss mined furik the matter privately with him. He was sure that this would be the best procedure for reaching agreement. He, as a fellow Arab, would know how best to put the df. matter to the sheikh, and induce him to accept some reasonable arrangement. But 'aai Foreigni ^ would like to be able to tell the sheikh that this private approach was being nation ontlr Inade wit h the knowledge and approval of His Majesty's Government. The , f ears 02 [li; official proposals would be made later, and through us if we wished. irsia.atale® Mr. Baxter replied that he must maintain the view that any official approach should be made through His Majesty's Government, and added that further con sideration would be given to the proposal that a preliminary private discussion should take place between Taufiq Suwaidi and the sheikh, with the knowledge and approval of His Majesty's Government.

THE Iraqi Foreign Minister called on me again on the 10th October at the end of his official visit to this country. 2. His Excellency first mentioned the problem of smuggling from Koweit into Iraq. He had, since his previous conversation with me on the 4th October, '(iiscussed this difficulty with the competent Department in the Foreign Office, and he wished to press for the adoption of a solution, one of several that had been discussed, whereby the tariff in Koweit should be increased to the level of the Iraqi tariff. He reminded me that I had at our previous interview expressed the hope that, if legal issues concerning the status of Koweit could be set aside, it mi edit be found possible to reach some agreement on other points affecting relations between Iraq and Koweit, including this question of smuggling. I assured his Excellency in reply that his suggestion would be carefully examined. 3. Taufiq Suwaidi then referred to British policy in Palestin e, and said that he had been a little disappointed with the result of his recent conversation with the Secretary of State for the Colonies. He appreciated that the Woodhead Commission had not yet completed their report, and that it was therefore impossible for His M.ajesty's Government now to reach a final decision as legai us their future policy. At the same time, he thought that His Majesty's Government ought now to decide on the policy which they would adopt if the commission were to report that partition was impracticable. He had put forward his own suggestions to Mr. MacDonald, but had received no indication that they were likely to be acceptable. Alternatively, the Woodhead Commission might report in favour of partition, and he wished to enquire whether, if His Majesty s Government decided to proceed on that basis, it would be possible oi ia Palestine to join with some neighbouring Arab State. He thought it was clear that a small Arab State in Palestine would not be able to stand alone. 4 I replied that I had read with interest the record which the Secretary ot State for the Colonies had made of his conversation with his Excellency regarding Palestine. It was true that His Majesty's Government were not able to take a new decision regarding their Palestine policy at this moment, before e y ac received or considered Sir John Woodhead's report. The whole situa ion, however, would manifestly have to be considered m the near future, and 1 thought, if I might say so, that his Excellency s recent conversation at the Colonial Office had been most helpful. The suggestions which he had put forward would certainly receive full consideration in due course, and 1 personalnaa every hope that a solution of this difficult problem might be found, which would be reasonable and fair to all concerned. As regards his Excellency s ur ei Question respecting the position of Arab Palestine after partition, 1 t oug i would be premature to consider this aspect of the problem at the present stage. 5. I proceeded to refer to the remarks which his Excellency had made at our previous conversation regarding Alexandrett a. I explained that His Majesty's Government would not feel able^ to take the initiative m endeavouring to secure a final settlement of the Alexandretta problem on the basis of partition between Turkey and Syria; but I added that, if it were at any time found that partition was acceptable to Turkey and France, as the parties chiefly concerne , His Majesty's Government for their part would not see any objection to such a proposal.^ wag anot | :ier p 0 i nt which his Excellency had raised at our previous conversation; he had asked that His Majesty s Government won use their influence with the French Government in favour of the eaily i ati: ca ion of the Franco-Syrian Treaty, and against any suggestion for the establishment of special regimes in Syria. His Majesty's Government would be prepared to [480 1—1]bring to the notice of the French Government the anxiety which his Excellency had expressed, more especially as regards the position in the Jezireh, and to ask for any information which the irench Government could give them as to the progress of negotiations. Taufiq Suwaidi observed that he had hoped that His Majesty's Government would have felt able, not merely to pass on the Iraqi Government's views and misgivings, but also actively to endorse them. I replied that an enquiry on the lines suggested would no doubt suffice to induce the French Government to examine carefully the Iraqi Government's point of view, and that I thought that he would regard this as satisfactory. 7. I then raised the question of the Iraqi Government's participation in the Empire Air Mail Scheme. I said that I did not intend to go into details, but only to say that this question had now been under consideration for a very long time, that the original British proposals had been modified on several occasions to meet what were believed to be the Iraqi Government's wishes, and that I understood that the latest British offer represented the limit to which the British authorities were prepared to go. We therefore hoped to hear soon that the present proposals, which were thought likely to benefit the interests both of Iraq and of this country, were acceptable to the Iraqi Government. Taufiq Suwaidi replied that he would certainly look into the matter on his return to Bagdad. 8. Finallv, Taufiq Suwaidi expressed his thanks for everything that had been done for him during his week's visit, which he had greatly appreciated. I am, &amp;c. HALIFAX./ / 3 8. i. . 58/38 • rfH NO.

The continued registration of the lands occupied by the Port of Basra in the name of His Majesty 1 s Government as owner, is an anachronistic survival from the days of the Mandate. It is considered that registration in the name of the Iraqi Govern ent should no longer be delayed. I therefore request His Majesty's Government to agree unconditionally to the change of registration. If the fact that the Port loan has not yet been completely repaid is considered to he an obstacle, the Iraqi Govern ent is prepared to make arrangements to repay the balance of the loan without delay.NO. 3 KUWAIT. 1, - Kuwait presents a two-fold problem for Iraq. (a) it has 'become an entrepot for extensive arms traffic and smuggling; (b) it 'bars Iraq's access to the ooen sea. 2, - His Majesty's foreign Office is already familiar with problem (a). The activities centred in Kuwait have for many years caused grave financial loss to Iraq in the shape of loss of customs revenue and extraordinary expenditure on preventive measures. The arms traffic also gravely complicates the task of maintajning law and order, particularly in the tribal areas of the Euphrates. 3, - As regards (b), Iraq's only channel of access to the sea is at present the Shatt-al-Arab. The Iraqi Oovernment feels that it is of vital importance to secure an alternative for the following reasons: (a) the recent dispute with Iran has emphasised the unreliability of the Shatt line: Iran is in a position to interrupt it at any time; (b) the Shatt tends to become more and more congested with the development of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company. If oil is discovered in the Basra Wilayat, developments of equal magnitude may be expected, and these must not be restricted by the Shatt—al—Arab bottle neck; (c) after completion of the Tell— Kochilf-Baghdad section of the railway, the Government proposes to extend the line as far south as possible with ayiew to inaugurating a fast passenger service to India, and shares the view of the original promoters/- ■ • As '•tii WfiH/3b 2. promoters of the Baghdad railway, that the terminus should be on the sea and not on the Shatt-al-Arah. 4 # - just 'before the War of 1914-1918, Kuwait was an autonomous qadha of the Wllayat of Basra, The Iraqi Government, as the successor of the Ottoman Government in the Wilayats of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra, considers that Kuwait should properly be incorporated in Iraq. If Incorporation should take place, Itaq would agree to maintain the local autonomy of Kuwait with a guarantee in the form of a special statute, but of course without prejudice to Iraqi sovereignty. 5, - If His Majesty's Govern ient will agree to the incorporation of Kuwait in Iraq, the two problems referred to in paragraph 1 will be automatically solved. If not, the solution of each must be found separately. 6. - Solution of the smuggling and arms -traffic problem can be sought by one of the three following methods, arranged in order of effectiveness; (a) A custons Union between Iraq and Kuwait, Kuwait to receive a fixed amual sun in lieu of its pre sent cus toms reve nue: (b) the northern frontier line of Kuwait to run from west to east at about lat.290 35' instead of about 30O N. as at present, so as to give the Iraqi preventive services more space in which to operate south of Zubair, Shaiba and other villages south of the Hammar Lake; (c) combined preventive operations. 7. - As regards direct access to the sea, t..- alternative positions for a port and railway terminus sug-est themselves for investigation?~ (a) a suitable site to be selected on Kuwait Bay; (D) the inland extension of the Khor Abdullah, named on/4i 3. on the map Khor Zubair. If the first alternative is found preferable, it would he necessary for Iraq to lease from Kuwait a site for a port on the Bay, and a corridor for the railway line. The second would involve a slight rectification of the frontier - that proposed under paragraph 6(h/ ahove would be more than ample - at the eastern end - so as to give sufficient room at Umm c^asr (a probable site ) and leave the whole of the Khor Abdullah in Iraq. Pending further investigation the Iraqi Governnent would be glad to be assured that His Majesty's Government, in principle, would be disposed to consider favourably either alternative.1 1 38/38. NO* 4 PALKSTINE. 1, - The Iraqi Government believes that the real interests of the British Empire and of the Arab world coincide so closely that co-operation in the Near East is both possible and desirable. As the ally of are at Britain, Iraq in particular would wish that in a time of world crisis, His Majesty's Govern tent should be able to count on the loyal and active assistance of all the Arabs, and not have to divert any part of their forces to that region to repress disorder or to counter a threat from any Arab element. The Palestine affair is poisoninf- what might be a most healthy political condition of the Near East. The Arabs, the Sa'-adabad Oovernnents and the whole of the Islamic world look upon the policy hitherto followed with feelings of dismay. 8. - Even the Royal Connission, which, for the first time, suggested partition and the formation of an independent political Jewish State in Palestine, did not claim thatthis was an ideal solution. They clinched their argument in favour of it as against, for instance, cantonisation, by expressing the opinion that partition offered ''one supreme advantage - the possibility it offers of eventual peace • The event, however, has shown beyond all argument that the premise on which the Royal Commission based xts conclusions was false. The very suggestion of partition has fanned the flames of race—hatred to a degree ol heat ne ve r be f o re re a che d. 3. - The Iraqi Government has on numerous occasions made representati; ns to His Majesty's G-ovcrn itnt in this connection, both on behalf of the original Arab inhabitants of Palestine on whoa it believes the policy hitherto followeo to be inflicting the gravest injustice (representations v/hich it is// 3 ^ 2. is not proposed to repeat in the present aide-memoire) and also on the general political grounds summarised in paragraph I above. His Majesty's Government have been good enough to assure the Iraqi Govern ient In replyj that these representations would he considered with the greatest attention, 4. - The Iraqi Government is therefore genuinely perplexed and disturbed - (a) to note that, in spite of the considerations set forth in the three preceding paragraphs, on every occasion that a spokesman of the United Kingdom has occasion to make a declaration on Palestine, the uncompromising statement is repeated that His Majesty's Government adhere to the view that partition offers the best solution; and (b) to le^rn, on what it 'believes to be respectable authority, that the Woodhouse Technical Commission styled itself ^Partition Commission' and refused to hear any evidence intended to show that no scheme of partition could be practicable or equitable. 5. - There thus appears to be a grave danger that after the Woodhouse Commission has reported, the only solution in the field will be one for partition, i.e. a solution that could only be forced through at great cost in blood and treasure, and with unfortunate political consequences. 6. - I ask to be enlightened as to why His Majesty's Government (in soite of the reactions to the proposal for partition, which of course they could not forsee in July, 1927, when they issued their statement of policy?but which nave since become msnifest) have continued to concentrate on the study of partition to the exclusion of any other proposal which might offer possibilities of an agreed solution. Two such schemes can be mentioned: - (a) the scheme sponsored by Colonel Newcombe, and already agreed to by many inlluential Arabs and Jews of moderate views (details have already been Majesty's comniunicated to His/Government) and (b) a scheme for the division//if 3. division of Palestine into a number - perhaps 'between 12 to 20 - of small federated cantons (rather on the lines of a scheme understood to have 'beenpropounded at one stage 'by Lord Runcirnan for Czechoslovakia), 7, - I earnestly 'beg Hla Majesty's Govern-nent to have detailed schemes worked out on these two 'bases in addition to any scheme for partition i fhich may have 'been worked out by the Woodhoxise Commission, in order that all possible alternatives may be simultaneously studied by a conference of representatives of all interests involved, in the hope that an agreed and durable solution may emerge.NO. b. ALEXANDRKTTA . X, The Iraqi Government maintains its opinion that the 'best solution of the Alexandretta quest! m, 'bolh for oractical reasons and also in the 'best interests of Arab-Turkish relations, would be division between Syria and Turkey, 2. During the course of ;ny visit to Paris early in Septe briber, 1938, I ascertained from Monsieur Georges Bonnet that the French aovernxnt, though unwilling to take any initiative in this direction, would have no objection to the Iraqi Government's doing so at an opportune moment, and also that it had no objection in principle to division. 3. The Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me this month at Geneva that while Turkey considered the reopening of the question at the present moment inopportune, they would not attempt to bind the Syrian Government and would continue to consider the Iraqi Government as eventual mediators in the matter. Monsieur Aras further promised to use his influence with the French Government, to ratify the Franco -Syrian treat:/ not later than November, 1938. 4. In view of these assurances and the declaration of Monsieur Paul Boncour in the Sixth Committee on Septe iber 20th 1938 that France intencled to ratify the treaty shortly, and that the delay wao due/only trivial points of detail, I refrained from raising the embarrassing question of the irregularity of the arrangement regarding Alexandretta, made direct between Prance and Turkey, an arrangement Silt -rely inconsistent with the previous decisions of the Council of the Leagu-. 5. The Iraqi Government trusts that His Majest,/ s government will use its go -Jd offices, whenever a suitable opportunity offers, to secure the reopening of this question with a view to settling it finally on the basis of division.No, 6. SYRIA . X, - The Iraqi Gove nment is seriously perturbed by the delay in the ratification of the Franco-Syrian treaty. It understands * that this delay is due, not to minor matters of detail as Monsieur Paul Bone our gpve it to he understood in the Sixth Committee of the ifiBRembly, but to fimdamentPl additions end alterations which the French Oovernment wishes to impose, and to which the Syrian Gove rn ent can never rrree, The date for the complete emancipation hes beers fixed for January 1940, the preparations for -fhe taking over of complete responsibility by the Syrian G-ovorninent ere in certain essential particulars, notably, the formation of a regular national army, far less advanced than they were in Iraq at the corresponding date - viz.

S ^ ^ f&lt; I t / .-v Sir, I am directed Ky Viscount Halifax to transmit to you herewith for the consideration of the Marquess of Zetland a cox^y of ^ memorandum which the IraQ_i Minister for Foreign Affairs communicated to the United Kingdom Delegation at Geneva 'before his recent visit to London to serve as a 'basis for his discussions here with His Majesty's Governmento It will 'be observed that in Section 3 or this memorandum Taufiq. Suwaidi raised the question of the legal status of the Sheikhdom of Koweit and made certain alternative suggestions for the solution of the problem of the smuggling and illegal arms traffic which is alleged to take place from Koweit into Iraq; these were: / (a) A customs union 'between Iraq and Koweit; ('b) The cession to Iraq, of the northern part of Koweit in order to facilitate police operations, and (c) Combined preventive operations. It will be seen from the enclosed copies of the records of the three conversations which Taufiq. Suwaidi had in this department that His Excellency indicated that he did not wish to insist on discussing the question of the international status of Koweit, but that he strongly urged that a further effort should be made to remove what the Iraqi Government considered, as their legitimate grievances in the matter of smuggling and arms traffic from the Sheikhdom* 2c/ fie Under-Secretary of State» India office.1*1 2. It will further 'be seen that Taufiq Suwaidi, while ready to accept the statement of the British authorities in the Persian Gulf that no arms are imported into Koweit 'by sea, maintained that there was at present nothing to prevent the purchase of arms in Koweit and said that it was common knowledge that arms traffic from Koweit into Iraq, takes place on a large scale. The Iragi Government may possibly in due course produce the evidence of this for which Taufiq Suwaidi was asked, hut it appears to Lord Halifax that in view of the positive statements on the subject made not only 'by Taufig, Suwaidi 'but also 'by Major Edmonds, the adviser in the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior, who accompanied His Excellency on the second of his visits to the Foreign Office, there is every likelihood that Koweit is in fact used as a centre at which arms can conveniently 'be bought. This is a position which causes Lord Halifax some disquiet, having regard to the serious view which His Majesty's Government have in the past always tai^en of their responsibility for checking the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf and to the harmful effect on security in Iraq which illegal importation of arms into that country must be expected to have. His Lordship trusts, therefore, that early and sympathetic consideration may be given to the suggestion, made by Major Edmonds, that the sale of arms in Koweit should be subjected to some strict form of Government control. 3# i^s far as other for as of smaggling are concerned, it will be seen that it was not possible to give Taufiq vjuwaidi any promise of satisfaction along the lines which he had suggested in his memorandum, and that Major Edmonds/Edmonds then made a further suggestion to the effect that, sinoe the main cause of smuggling into Iraq is the low level of the Koweiti tariff, the difficulty might 'be overcome if the Koweiti customs tariff were increased to the level of the Iraqi tariffo I am to add that in a subsequent conversation Major Edmonds expressed the opinion that if it proved impracticable to raise the tariff level of all goods imported into Koweit, it might remove at least the main causes of friction if an increase of tariff were made on the products, such as tea, sugar, etc., which are at present smuggled in the greatest quant it ies. 4. . Lord Halifax is of course aware that it is for the Iraqi Government in the first place to ensure that smuggling into their territory does not take place, and he has not failed to impress this fact on them, 'both through His Majesty's Ambassador at Bagdad and now in London, Nevertheless, it is impossible to deny that the consistent refusal of the Sheikh to take, or even to discuss, any practical measures to cooperate with the Iraqi Government in this matter is not consistent with the relations which normally exist between neighbouring •ountrles. Nor can it be denied that His Majesty's Government must accept some degree of responsibility in the matter since, but for their protection of the Sheikh, the Iraqi Government would no doubt find the means of inducing him to adopt a more accommodating and friendly attitude. In view, indeed, of the special relationship of His Majesty's Government to Koweit, and of their alliance with Iraq, His Lordship regards the existing position as particularly unfortunate, since it inevitably raises doubts/! doubts in Iraq as to the extent to which it is possible to rely on the friendship of His Majesty^ Government, end their willingness to provide their ally with reasonable assistance in the protection of Iraqi interests. I am therefore to express the hope that careful consideration may he given to the possibility of taking some action on the lines suggested by Major Edmonds. If no such action proves practicable, Lord Halifax will be grateful for any alternative suggestions that Lord Zetland may be able to maive with a view to checking smuggling from Koweit, and thus removing what the Iraqi Government undoubtedly consider to be a legitimate grievance. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, . . *■: w. BAXT2.K. Mf.noc)INDIA OFFICE; WHITEHALL, S.w'.l. 168/38 9bh November, 1938 a • Sir, I am directed loy the Secretary of State to forward for the consideration of the Government of India, a copy of a letter from the Foreign Office relative to certain conversations recently held with the Foreign Office 'by the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of Koweit, with particular reference to the prejudice to the security of Iraq and the loss to Iraqi revenues stated to 'be caused 'by smuggling of arms and of dutiable goods generally from Koweit into Iraq. 2. On the subject of the alleged smuggling ox' arms from or through Koweit into Iraq the views of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf have recently 'been expressed in the correspondence resting with his demi-official , tf ic5 letter of the '7th Octoher, No. 0/744. It is clear from this corresDondence that the smuggled arms do no c enter Koweit 'by sea 'but come (if they enter Koweit at all) from Saudi Arabia. The information available to the Royal Air Force in Iraq does not suggest that the arms are dealt with by Kov/eitimiddlemen, while the Political Resident finds it difficult to understand why arms traffickers on the way irem Saudi Arabia to Iraq should enter Koweit territory at all. Even if it is the case that the alleged illicit arms traffic is carried on by isolated parties passing through the desert parts of Koweit on their way from Saudi Arabia 150 Iraq ic 'retary to the werament of India, External Affairs Department.2. seems unreasonable to expect the Sheikh, with the moans at his disposal, to control traffic across the Saudi- Kov/eit frontier when the Iraqis, with their greatly superior resources and the frontier customs police organisation which they now maintain, are apparently unable to check the illicit traffic in arms across their own frontier. 3. It will however be seen from the enclosures to the Foreign Office letter that the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs and the British Adviser in the Ministry of the Interior are convinced (though definite evidence was not adduced by them) that the smuggling 01 arms across the Kowo it-Iraq frontier has assumed serious proportions, and assert that it is facilitated by the fact that Kov/eit has become a recognised market for the sale of arms where they can be bought freely and cheaply. The Secretary of State feels that it is impossible to dismiss lightly this very definite conclusion formed by the Iraqi authorities, contrary though it is to the views expressed by the Political Resident in his letter of the Tth October, referred to above, and should there be any foundation in fact for their description of the situation in Kov/eit, he would share the disquiet with which it is viewed by the Foreign Office. x^ven tnou^h it may be admitted that the responsibility for the control of their own frontier rests with the Iraqi Government, it is clear that His Majesty's Government could not expose themselves to the reproach -that they are tolerating the existence, in a State under their protection, of a traffic in arms which directly or indirectly/4./ indirectly contributes a menace to the security of a neighbouring State. I am therefore to request that the Political Resident may 'be asked to make further investigation into the matter in the light of the Iraqi Minister's contentions^ so far as may 'be possible pending the production of any detailed evidence which the Iraq authorities may he ah1e to supply. Even if further examination tends to confirm the statement made 'by the Political Resident in his express letter of the 21st July No. 427.3. to the Air Officer Commanding Iraq that nohody in Koweit from the Sheikh downwards? obtain any profit from this traffic^ or is in any way engaged in it? the Secretary of State feels that it is desirablej if only to provide an effective answer to the Iraqi allegationsj that we should satisfy ourselves that the control of the sale of arms in Koweit is adequate? and it will 'be observed that the Foreign Office have promised that further consideration should be given to the suggestion made by Major Edmonds to this effect. The Secretary of State will therefore be glad if the Government of India v/ill consider? in consultation with the Political Resident? whether some stricter form of control is necessary and if so what measures can be devised for the purpose. In seeking the consent of the Sheikh to action of this nature it would be relevant to remind him of the proclamation issuedby his predecessor in 1900 in pursuance of his undertaking to prohibit absolutely the importation of arms into Koweit or the exportation of arms therefr 'om (vide Aitchison XI pp« 262 f.)&lt;■?&gt; 4. The representations of His excellency Taufi-q* b- Suv/aidi on the general question of smuggling irom Koweit into Iraq are discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Foreign Office letter. The complaints of the Iraqi Government against the Sheikh on this account are of long standing, and the failure of the repeated attempts to 'mediate a settlement v/hich were made in the past? and particularly in 1934 and 1935 5 does not greatly encourage the hope of a solution 'being found until the hi ochade imposed 'by Saudi Arabia ^ Tl. x _i - '' on imports from K owe it has 'been removed. 'He is aware in particular, that oh Section has 'been raised in the past to proposals ? such as that of Major Edmonds 3 to raise the Koweit tariff to the level of that of Iraq? on the grounds that it would conflict with the treat; ohligation (arising from the Bunder iL Shweikh lease of 1907) to limit the Koweit duty on v / , goods imported hv British subjects to 4;&lt; ? that ib * would cause discontent in Koweit through the resulbant rise in prices? and that it would seriously affect legitimate trade with the interior. But the situation in which a State under the protection of* His Majesty's Government profits from smuggling goods into the territory of an ally of His Majesty's Government is patently unsatisfactory, and as the negotiations for the removal of the Saudi 'blockade are 'bound to take some further time the Secretary of State would glad if the Government of India in consultation with the Political Resident would review the question and state whether in their opinion any measures can usefully he/5. 'be suggested at this stage for adoption loy the Sheikh with the object of reducing the extent of smuggling from Koweit into Iraq. 5.

The mistake has probably risen through the water hole having given its name to a tract of the same name. It is quite likely that part of the tract is in Iraq.

Nearly every Bedouin from Saudi Arabia then 'brings 100 rounds for sale, as it is a convenient and easily convertible stock on which there is profit^ j / The main sources of ammunition supply to tribesmen in Iraq are therefore (a) through the underpaid servants of Ibn Saud and thence through Saudi tribesmen, and (b) from soldiers of the Iraq army. ' Saudi Revolvers also come to Iraq and Kuwait from / Bedouin, who have acquired them from the Nejdi servants of the King, and this is proved because they are German revolvers, taking ten rounds, which Ibn Saud bought in large quantities and gave to his men as everyone knows.

(a) The reason why nlnglish ammunition is cheap in Iraq is because it is plentiful, and it is plentiful because it was the ammunition in use by the British in the past, and is the ammunition of Iraq forces today. Old dumps and present day theft account for the quantity to be had. Some soldiers in the Iraq army sell clips. (b) The immediate source, for Iraq, of the Turkish and Grerman rifles and ammunition is both from Saudi Arabia via Wejf area and from Syria via the Jebel Sen jar area; but the majority of good weapons and ammunition come from Nejd. In Syria the bad or 'imitation 1 * Turkish ammunition is made secretly in the towns, from old lead. In Northern Saudi Arabia the servants of the Provincial Governors sell arms and ammunition, but arms are obtainable in all (^asim and Jebel Shammar towns, in each of which there are armourer's shops. (c) Zilfi and Shagra in qasim are in particular centres / H.T.Peel Esquire, M.C., The India Office, London,,I -1 '-i -2- centres for arms and ammunition traffic. In z.ilfi Muhammad Ibn Has hid is an active merchant, and in Bhagra, Nasr and Ali al Asus Kharaiji, are purveyors. They buy rifles, from the quantity always in circulation and available, for example when replaced by newer ones received by individuals, from the 3audi Govern ment, either in the form of a 'service igaue H to Hoyal servants and soldiers, or as presents to Shaiichs arid other Bedouin followers of the Xing. These qasim merchants also sell to qataris and Omanis, but most arms go to Iraq by one of the many desert paths or one of the aix caravan routes in use to that frontier. (d) They correspond with Hejefi merchants about their trade, but apart from consignments, which are not great, there is a continual drift of arms and ammunition towards Iraq through the tribes, particularly at the time of the restocking of the Saudi Bedouins in Iraq. Hearly every Bedouin from Saudi Arabia then brings 100 rounds for sale, as it is a convenient and easily convertible stock on which there is profit. (e) The main sources of ammunition supply to tribesmen in Iraq are therefore (a) through the underpaid servants of Ibn Baud and thence through Saudi tribesmen, and ( b) from soldiers of the Iraq army. * 3 # I am sending a copy of this letter with enclosures to Hetcalfe and to de Gaury, without. 5# ♦ sent under printed letter N0.4&amp;-S of the 12th January 1939.Si in it?

I / ,fi?8 f 0^ 15^ slWi n«i I have the honour to refer to your letter No.F.l 14-N/38 of the 20th Oeoeiaber 1938 on the subject of the alleged sale of arms in Kuwait. 2. I am proceeding to Kuwait on tour next month and will then in consultation with the political 4gent make enquiries into the points raised in paragraph 3 of your letter. 3. In regard to the statement made by Major iSdmonds, referred to in the same paragraph of your letter. Personally X would be more impressed by it if Major Edmonds had produced any evidence for his allegation that Kuwait was a recognised arms market for arms smuggling into Iraq. It is indeed this entire absence of evidence on the part of the Iraqi (Joveanment for their statements, whether now or on previous occasions during the past four years or ®Of in regard to arms trading from Kuwait, which in my opinion is the most unsatisfactory feature of the whole question. It is inconceivable to me that if the arms smuggling exists *0 the extent alleged oy the Iraqi Qovernment further details are oot in their possession» and there is the additional important point /«- 2'- polnt that the production of such details by giving a basis for our further enquiries would maice these considerably easier. I note that Hr. Baxter in his conversation with the Iraqi minister for foreign Affairs on the 4th October 1938 asiced if the Iraqi government were able to produce any evidence '♦to show that smuggling of arms did, in fact, take place through Kuwait*. (See paragraph 2 of my letter Ho c 64B-S of 29th Hovember 1938 to the India Office, copy sent to the Government of India under my Printed Letter S0.649-S of the same date). To this enquiry Taufiq Suwaidi replied that '♦he thought that the Iraqi Govern ment could produce evidence of this. H I venture to suggest that the Iraqi Government might be reminded of Mr. Baxter's query, and asked to produce any evidence which may be in their possession, such information from our point of view could be most usefully given in the form of replies to a questionnaire as followsi ■r (1) What roughly is the number and make of rifles and amount of ammunition smuggled (say) in the past year ? (2) *hat were the dates on which especially large consignments of arms and assftunition were smuggled ? (3) What are the names of the individuals in Kuwait whom the Iraqi Government suspect of being concerned in the arms trade ? (4) The are the individuals, or tribes, who actually smuggle the arms ? (b) mat are the routes by which arms are smuggled and to what centres in Iraq ? (6) vThat tribal Shaikhs in Iraq actually receive the arras ? It /It aeems to me that the Iraqi Gorernaant should be well able to give some sort of answers to the above queries. Kuwait is only some 100 miles from Basrah, there is a constant flow of Iraqis coming and going between the two places, and at Safwmn on the KUwait-Basrah motor route there is an important Iraqi frontier post. 5, Mr. Baxter in the course of the same conversation with Taufiq Suwaidi pressed the point that the Iraqi Ooverrinerit themselves should taice anti-smuggling measures in Iraq itself# In this connection the opinions of Major Bdmonds himself, Major Sargon of the Iraq Police and Kaj i al Asil# the Iraqi Foreign . ^ Minister, (see paragraph 4 of my letter quoted above) f are of importance* It is true that some of these measures apply to forms of smuggling other than arms, but there seems no doubt that the Iraqi Government could exercise a much closer control than they do over the entry of arms a&lt;^r^Bs the Iraqi frontier (e.g. paragraph 5 of my Express Letter Ho.427*3 of 2lst J 1938 to the Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in Iraq). I venture to suggest that this point aleo might be ftgain brou s ,nt to the notice of the Iraqi Government. 6.

JSo bedouin is permitted to bring a rifle into the town without a written permit which is only given when a rifle is in need of repair. Rifles which do not need repair are left in charge of the guards at the gates. There are three armourers in the town who do not manu facture arms but only repair them. All incoming and outgoing merchandise is examined inmaediately on arrival at the Customs House which is situated just inside the main gate.

Meanwhile it will be seen that Sir T. Fowle again emphasises the absence of any concrote evidence in support of the repeated allega Lions by tne Iraqi authorities that arms are being regularly smuggled Under Secretary of State, foreign Office, S.W. 1.\c\h ff 2. . . ^ -'T 4 ' from Koweit, and in paragraph 4 of his letter of the 2lst January to the Government of India he has suggested certain points on which it might 'be useful to ask for information from the Iraqi Government on this subject. Lord Zetland feels that there is much force in the views expressed hy the Resident in his ahove-mentioned letter and ho would suggest that the Iraqi Government might he asked; with reference to Taufiq 3uwaidi T s remarks to which Sir T. Fowle refers, to furnish the desired information so far as they may he able 5 hoth to establish that their allegations are well founded and to assist the British and Koweit authorities in devising means to suppress such traffic as may he shown to exist. 3. In his letter of the 21st July, No. 427-3. (vide enclosure to my demi-official letter of the IVth August, No. P.Z.5537/38), the Resident endorsed the view that the source of the arms smuggled into Iraq lay not in Koweit hut in Saudi Arabia, and further colour is , ^ p nh given to this belief in his recent letter of the 12th January. It is not clear why smugglers from Saudi Arabia should pass through Koweit territory a t all, but even if they do so Lord Zetland would suggest that it rests with Iraq and not with Koweit to institute adequate frontier measures to check the traffic, if the Saudi -Arabian Government are not prepared to take steps to stop the smuggling at its source. 4, On the question of smuggling generally the views of the G -overnment of India and of the Political Resident, which were called for urgently at the request of your Department, are conoained in the Government of p ♦ /A ^ India's tologram of the 2nd Votruary, No. 203, and the3. ****'' f Resident's telegram of the 29th January, No. 80. Lord Zetland agrees with them that the Iraqr authorities might 'be again reminded of the Sheikh's willingness to discuss the question when the Saudi-Koweit blockade has 'been lifted - the prospect of which, as Lord Halifax is aware, is now much brighter - and that they might he informed that, if they so desire, His Majesty's Government are prepared to approach the Sheikh again with regard to measures (i.e. a system of manifesto hy land as well as 'bjr sea) which he was prepared to introduce over threo years ago hut which were then refused hy the Iraqi Government. Finally^ Lord Zetland would commend to Lord Halifax's consideration the views expressed in ^ t paragraph 5 of the Resident's telegram of the 29th January regarding the repeated incursions of Iraqi police into Koweit territory, and his suggestion that the opportunity should he taken to propose that the frontier between Kov/eit and Iraq should 'be demarcated.

In a short conversation over a cup of coffee, it was clear to me that he knows little or nothing a1x&gt;ut the desert, although I must admit that he was upset at the time, and that it is just possible that I may have 'been mistaken, (He and the garrison had 'been waiting for inspection 'by the new Mutassarif of Basra and I had come in for all the salutes and official cringing 'before the mistake was realised). 4. As it is important that there should not 'be more trouble given to us all, and relations again deteriorate^ perhaps the authorities concerned could 'be asked to satisfy themselves that the man is experienced and q. lite suitable for desert frontier work. r % Hon^le Sir Trenchard Fowle, KCIE., CEE., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, (L (111. ^ I i:*i , 111 m i Bushire. v s''r •a 15 Translation of letter No,H-8/ll58, dated 17th Maroh 1939 from Hie Highness the Ruler of Kuwait to the Political Agent, Kuwait* A/C, I have to inform Your Exoellenoy that two armed Police oars crossed the frontiers, and, according to the eye-witnesses* statements enclosed, came to a place not far from Jahra # As this (incursion) is against International Laws, and is an unreasonable violation of the honour of an independent and peaceful State, in spite of our preserving the dignity of neighbourhood, which we have been and still are respecting with much care and attention, we put this fact before His Majesty^ G-overnment, because she is the protector of Kuwait independence against such attacks from outside# We have reported what we think necessary. m 11 ■ _■ I mm r ■ ■hi \Translation of the enclosure to His Hi^m ess the Ruler of Kuwait's letter No.H-e/llSE, dated 17th March 1939 to the Political Agent, Kimait.

Copy by bag to Political Agent, Kuwait. Bated 25tii received 26th March, 1939. As it happened Just after Bus hire telegram No *149 to India Office reached me on March 2ord I was summoned to the Palace and was received by King Grhazi in the presence of the Prime Minister Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of Finance. After discussing nearer matters King and Prime Minister stressed His Majesty^ friendly feelings for Shaiich of Kuwait and pressed me to expedite acceptance of overtures mentioned in Ambassador's telegram No. 66. Having heard them out I said I thought Shaikh would need lot of convincing as to friendly sentiments ^hich His Majesty had told me that he entertained towards him and proceeded to protest with as much force as I could command against ?dis^raoefal behaviour of Iraqi police whom I said had evidently been encouraged to commit these outrages by unrestrained and harmful propaganda which had mut. been conducted in this country. Kin^ and his Minister expressed astonishment and denied knowledge of these events. His Majesty said that he would cause offenders to be punished. I said thr t was least he could do. Prime Minister observed that these incidents only showed how necessary it was that no time should oe lost in despatching an envoy from here to Kuwait and tnat individual whom they had in mind was well equipped in every way to under- take such a mission. He would be able to advise the Shaikh / 'f / on . i^ MM—Bli -2- on how to administer his country and to convince His Highness that King of Iraq's sole idea was to render assistance in bringing that backward territory up to date. King then alleged that )l ; i Shaikh employed Persians as police and encouraged Persian Immigra tion in order to enable him to control his own people. I denied this and when Prime Minister went on to say how pleased His Majesty would be to send Iraqi police at any time to help the Shaikh to keep order I obserTed that I should have thought that Kuwait 's recent experience of Iraqi police would have been enough. ( omission ?Hothing ) I could say would shaice King and prime Minister from their idea of sending envoy and later of inviting Shaikh to Bagdad to be flattered anu. decorated, rhey again begged me to seek your approval for project. But I mut. , Shaikh will be discouraged from responding at any rate until he has received apology for these three latest violations of his ] territory. If and when apology has been preferred and Iraqi Government have given proof of good faith by show of cessation of propaganda it will be for consideration whether it might not be impolitic to discourage despatch of King's messenger of friendship. Poasibly if as one hopes his relations with Ibn 3aud are shortly to be put on a more regular footing the jhai'Kh yould be in a stronger position than he would seem to be today to object to Iraqi blandishments. Impression left on me by ? proceedings at Palace was that Iraqis are aiming effectively to take over protection ol Kuwait while nominally leaving Shaikh and His Majesty's Government in their present position. Protests from this ISmbassy regarding propaganda have hitherto had little effect. I spoke to Prime flnister arcn 22nd / about•v 'V -3- I MM about broadcasting referred to in your telegram Ho.87. 1 also expressed disappointment that Kinti in a mesaage to Nation on His Majesty^ birthday in sending greetings to other Arabs in whose future welfare he was interested had seen fit to mention those of Kuwait together with those of Palestine and gyria. Hepresentative pointed out that he had deleted the three names t*™ original draft and from account issued to Preia. I said that nevertheless Oriental Secretary had heard broadcast. (There was nothing offensive in broadcast but 1 thought it well to menti on it.) I have today reinforced my oral representations about JAHRROA with a note requesting an apology (copy ox wnich forwarded to you by air mail) but I do not expect any concrete result. - Houst oun-Boswall. l«% i c f z .
