Circular addressed to Her Majesty s Diplomatic and Consular Agents aorouu. gj rj Foreign Office, February 23, 1854. THE communication wliich has recently been made to you of the corres pondence on Eastern affairs which has been laid before both Houses of Parlia ment will have shown you that there is every probability of an early commence ment of hostilities between Great Britain and France on one side and Russia on the other. That correspondence will also have shown you that the British and French Governments, throughout the difficult and complicated negotiations which have preceded the existing state of affairs, have earnestly and cordially acted together, with a view to avert the calamity of war, and that they are equally prepared to act with the same earnestness and cordiality for the preservation ot the Ottoman Empire, if the Emperor of Russia should still be unwilling to negotiate for peace on fair and reasonable terms. The time has now arrived when it is incumbent on the two Governments to prepare for all the contingencies of war ; and among those contingencies it has been impossible for them to overlook the danger to which their subjects and their commerce on the high seas may be exposed by the machinations of their enemy, who, though unable from his own resources materially to injure either, may seek to derive means of offence from countries whose Governments take no part in the contest which he has provoked. But it is a necessary consequence of the strict union and alliance which exists between Great Britain and France, that, in the event of war, their conjoint action should be felt by Russia in all parts of the world ; that not only in the Baltic, and in the waters and territory of Turkey, their counsels, their armies, and their fleets, should be united either for offensive or defensive purposes against Russia, but that the same spirit of union should prevail in all quarters oi the world, and that whether for offence or defence the civil and military and naval resources of the British and French Empires should be directed to the common objects of protecting the subjects and commerce of England and France from Russian aggression, and of depriving the Russian Government of the means of inflicting injury on either. # For these reasons Her Majesty's Government have agreed with that of His Majesty the Emperor of the French to instruct their civil and naval authorities in foreign parts to consider their respective subjects as having an equal claim to protection against Russian hostility ; and for this purpose, either singly or in conjunction with each other, to act indifferently lor the support and defence of British and French interests. It may be that, in a given locality, one only o{ the Powers is represented by a civil functionary, or by a naval force; but, in such a case, the influence and the power of that one must be exerted as zealously and efficiently for the protection of the subjects and interests of the other as if those subjects and interests were its own. I have accordingly to instruct you, Sir, to act in conformity with this prin ciple. You will consider it your duty to protect, as far as possible, against the consequence of the hostilities in which England and France may shoitly beengaged with Russia, the subjects and interests of France equally with those of England ; and you will make known without reserve to the French civil and naval authorities, with whom you may have means of communication, any dangers to which the interests of either country may be exposed, or any opportunities with which you may become acquainted of inflicting injury on the common enemy. %} Instructions to the same effect will be sent by the Government of France to its civil and naval authorities in foreign parts, and Her Majesty's Government concur with that of France in anticipating the most favourable results from this decided manifestation of the intimate union which prevails between them, and which it is their earnest desire should influence their agents in all parts of the world at a moment when they are about to engage in a contest with the Empire of Russia for au object of such paramount interest to Europe as the maintenance of the Turkish Empire.

I HAVE the honour to acquaint your Lordships that Her Majesty's Government and that of France have agreed that tlieir civil authorities and naval forces in all parts of the world should co-operate, or if necessary act singly, lor the protection of the interests of the subjects and commerce of the two nations, wherever the same may stand in need of assistance, against the hostile machinations of Russia. I have accordingly addressed to Her Majesty's Diplomatic and Consular Agents abroad the instruction of which I inclose a copy,* and I am to signify to your Loidships the Queeu-s eommands tlmt uu iuatructiou to the same etiect be forthwith issued by your Lordships for the direction of Her Majesty's naval forces in all parts of the world.

Le Soussigne, s'en referant du reste aux explications verbales qu'il a eu 1 honneur d'echanger a ce sujet avec son Excellence M. le Comte de Clarendon, croit devoir se bonier a constater ici le but que se sont propose les deux Gouver- nements dans cette occurrence, qui est non seulement de procurer a lours sujets et a leurs navires, sous toutes les latitudes, une complete security, niais encore de rendre plus eclatant le grand fait de leur alliance, en commuuiquant a leurs Agents dans toutes les parties du globe I'esprit qui anime les deux Cabinets. Le Soussigne, &amp;c. (Signe) A. WALEWSKL (Translation.) London, February 24, 1854. 1 HE Undersigned, Ambassador of His Majesty the Emperor of the French, has been directed by his Government to transmit herewith to his Excellency the Earl of Clarendon, Her Britannic Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for * \o. i.4 c \ r (Translation.) ^ ,r ' Paris, February 1854. FORCED to admit tlie possibility of hostilities between themselves and Russia, the Government of His Imperial Majesty and that of Her Britannic Majesty have thought that the alliance which they have contracted, in si'j.ht of a common danger, ought to cover all those interests which the consequences of the war may affect or place in jeopardy. Whatever may be the extent of the resources which each of them has at its disposal, especially by sea, they have to t take into account unexpected contingencies. / It may chance, if war breaks out, that in localities where the naval forces of each of them may not be constantly present, occurrences may be produced where iheii fellow-countrymen and their commercial Hag may not have, at the necessary moment, all the support which will be indispensable for their security. The two ^ Governments need only to be impressed with the spirit which governs their present iclations to find the means to provide fur such contingencies; and they recognize those means in the adoption of a mutual system of protection embracing those inteiests which are spread over every part of the globe. The Diplomatic and Commercial Agents, together with the commanders of the naval forces of both countries in every part of the globe, will then consider it to be their duty to give their support to the subjects and commerce of the other in all supposable cases in which they may be menaced by the common enemy. \ on will therefore. Sir, look upon the subjects and ships of England in your locality, in such cases, as having the same right as the ships and subjects of I'ranee to all the assistance which lies in your power, and you will communicate this injunction to the naval authorities of His Imperial Majesty who may be in a position to join in the measures which events resulting from a state of war may appear to you to demand. The Agents and naval authorities of Her Britannic Majesty will receive identic instructions, and thus the subjects and commerce of the two nations may rely upon reciprocal protection from the Consuls and the ships of the two Powers. ^ on will understand. Sir, that I do not seek to determine by anticipation all the cases which may require your intervention. It is for you to direct yourself, h y y our own judgment, in the application of the principle which is destined to serve as the rule of your conduct. The two Governments hold it of much less value to lay down with precision the circumstances and the forms in which this protection is to be exercised, than to mark the character which it should assume. But in giving to the world this fresh evidence of the unity of their views and of the sincerity of their alliance, they are persuaded that, in order to insure for this common measure every desirable efficacy, their Agents have only to be thoroughly imbued with the spirit of solid union which has dictated this measure to the two Cabinets.

MA depeche du 18 Fevrier a appele specialement votre attention sur les graves complications qu'a fait naitre en Europe la question d'Orient. Les negociations entamees pour denouer pacifiquement le differend qui s'est, eleve entre la Russie et la Turquie sont demeurees sans resultat, et tout porte a croire que de nouveaux efforts demeureront impuissants. J ^ L'Angleterre et la France out resolu de proteger I'Empire Ottoman, et de s'opposer, meme par la force, aux projets envahissans de la Russie. Ces deux grandes nations sont intimement unies dans leur politique et se sont mutuelle- i ment donne les gages les plus certains de leur alliance. Leurs escadres croisent de concert dans la Mer Noire ; elles se pretent reciproquement le plus loyal concours; les deux Gouvernements, apres avoir adopta une politique commune, se sont mis egalement d'accord sur tons les moyens d'aclion.8 Cette alliance de la France et d'Angleterre ne doit pas so reveler seulcmcnt dans les mers d'Europe. Le Gouvernernent de Sa Majeste Imperialc et ccltu de la Heine de la Grande Bretagne desirent que la mcme union, le meme accoul, regnent sous toutes les latitudes. Les forces navales de I'Angleterre et de la brance doivent done so pictei un mutuel concours dans toutes les regions mcme les plus lointaines- Immediatement apres la reception de ces instructions, vous aurez s ^ n ( ^ 0 vous mettre en relation avec les commandants des stations on des batiments de la Grande Bretagne. Vous devrez combiner, de concert avec eux, toutes ics mesures qui auraient pour objet de proteger les interets, la puissance ou I'lionneur du drapeau des deux nations amies.

Vous devrez accorder votre protection aux batiments du commerce de la Grande Bretagne au meme titre que les batiments de guerre de 1 Angleterre preteront aide et protection aux navires marchands de notre nation. En un mot, les deux Gouvernements de France et d'Angleterre desirant que leurs forces navales armees agissent comme si elles appartenaient a une seule et meme nation, jecompte que, pour ce qui vous concerne, vous ne perdrez jamais de vue cette regie de conduite, et que vous saurez la pratiquer de maniere a cimenter davantage encore, s'il se pent, I'intime union des deux pays. Tant que les hostilites entre la France et 1'Angleterre d'une part, et la Russie de I'autre, n'auront pas commence ou que la declaration de guerre n aura pas ete faite, vous vous dispenserez de prendre Tinitiative des mesures agressives, et vous vous tiendrez sur la defensive. J'aurai soin, aussitot que le moment sera venu, de vous transmettre toutes les instructions necessaires pour 1 attaque. Recevez, See. (Signe) DUCOS. (Translation.) Gentlemen, ^ Pari ^ February 1854. MY despatch of the 18th of February has specially called your attention to the grave complications to which the Eastern question lias given lise in Europe. The &amp; negotiations entered into in order to produce a pacific solution of the differences which have arisen between Russia and Furkey have not produced any result, and everything tends to the belief that further etlorts will be equally u sclcss. England and France have resolved to protect the Ottoman Empire, and to oppose, even by force, the aggrandizing projects of Rusbia. These two great nations are intimately united in their political course, and have interchanged the most positive assurances of their alliance. Their squadrons are cruizing togetiiei in the Black Sea, and reciprocally extend to each other the most enectual support ; the two Governments having agreed to one common political course, have equally agreed upon all the means of carrying it into eftect. This alliance on the part of France and England must not be confined to the seas of Europe. The Government of His Imperial Majesty and that ol the Queen of Great Britain desire that the same union, the same agreement shall exist in all latitudes. , . . The naval forces of England and France must therefore give to each other a mutual support in every region however distant. Immediately upon the receipt of these instructions you will take care to place yourself in communication with the commanders of stations or vessels of Great Britain. You must, in concert with them, adopt such measures as may be necessary to protect the interests, the power, or the honour of the flag ot the two friendly nations. You will, in this sense, give to each other mutual assistance, whether it be in an attack on the enemy, when hostilities have commenced, or when a declaration of war shall have been made, or whether you may from this moment be compelled to defend against attack. ^ i • • You are to give protection to the merchant shipping of Great Britain, on the same grounds as English ships of war will assist and protect the commercial vessels of our nation.9 In odg ^void, the two (jovernments of Lranco and England being desirous that their naval forces shall act as if they belonged to one and the same nation, I am sure that, in so far as you are concerned, you will never lose sight of this iiile foi youi conduct, and that you will know how to enforce it in a. manner to cement still further, if possible, the intimate union between the two countries. So long as hostilities between France and England on one side, and Russia on the other, shall not have commenced, or that a declaration of war shall not have been made, you will avoid aggressive measures, and act upon the defensive. I shall take care, when the proper time arrives, to forward to you the necessary instructions for attack. Receive, &amp;c. (Signed) DUCOSPART IV.

The Native Princes in alliance with Government will be invited, thiougli the acciediteci Political Authorities, to co-operate in this important undertaking, by transmitting to the[ 634 ] Exposition, through the Local Government, the best specimens of the productions of their respective countries. All persons who may be anxious to avail themselves of the permission accorded in para. 10 of Mr. Secretary Grey's letter, to place under the charge of the Local Government, for transmission to the Exposition, on their own private account, any specimens of country produce and manufactures, should communicate their wishes, together with full particulars, to the Central or Local Committees. An equally favourable occasion will not often present itself for making European nations acquainted with the resources and skill of India. Men of Science, Merchants, Manufacturers, and Artists, will all be prompted to visit the Exposition of 1855, not merely by curiosity, but by interest. Each and all of them will find their account in encouraging a demand for such productions as may appear to be valuable from their properties, or likely to be brought into request by the ingenuity or the delicacy of their workmanship. In every case in which this may happen, whether the specimen preferred shall have been transmitted by an individual contributor, or by one of the Committees, a step will have been made towards developing the resources of the country, and improving the condi tion of its inhabitants. By order of the Right Honorable the Governor in Council, C. J. ERSKINE, Secretary to Government. Bombay Castle, 19/7/ April 1854. -V * PUBLIC DEPARTMENT. Ko. 2 of 1854. OUR GOVERNOR GENERAL OF INDIA IN COUNCIL. 1. With our Despatches in this Department dated the 24th May (No. 30) and 20tli July (No. 48) of the last year, we forwarded communications received by Her Majestv's Secretary of State for the Foreign Department, notifying that the French Government had determined to throw open to all nations an Exhibition similar to that held in London in the year 1851. The articles from India included in the Exhibition of 1851 excited the admira tion of the best judges for correctness of principle in design, and in ornament, as well as for unexampled skill in* harmony of colouring ; and India having, on account of the success which then attended its collections, been specially invited to contribute to the ' Exposition Universelle,' which is to be opened in Paris in the spring of 1855, we are desirous of ren- deiing oui assibtance in afloidirTg to the Natives of-that country another opportunity of displaying to t he people fSf Eu rope the varied products of our Eastern Empire, as well as specimens of their manufacturing sklir and taste. 2. The collection of Raw Products, as well as of Tools and of Models, having been retained by us, it is unnecessary to make a fresh collection of such products or of tools and models, except in cases where articles of interest, and such as are likely to be of commercial value, appear to have been omitted on the last occasion, or unless individuals may desire to exhibit on their own accdlmt such products as indigo, lac, silk, sugar, tobacco, hemp tea nr* 1 ' ' cotiee. 7 he collection to be formed must therefore consist principally of the manufactured articles for which India has so long been famous, and which elicited so much admiration in ss [ 635 ] the Exhibition of 1851, such as inlaid arms and metal work, textile fabrics, Dacca muslins, plain and flowered silks, shawl-works, embroidery and carpets with Mosaics, inlaid ivory and sandal-wood, ivory and other carvings, ebony and blackwood furniture. 4. Keeping in view the necessity of giving a full Indian character to the collection, care should be taken to make a selection of the best Indian patterns and workmanship, and chiefly of such articles as have been found to be most admired. 5. As it is probable that Native Princes and Merchants may be disposed to contribute specimens of the manufactures of their respective districts, you will communicate to them the nature of this Exhibition ; and in case of their becoming exhibitors, it will be necessary to obtain precise instructions respecting the final disposal of their contributions. 6. As some guide we forward a INo. in the packet a list of such articles as seem best suited to this Exhibition, though it is not intended to exclude others of which the places of manufacture are not mentioned, or which were omitted on the first occasion, or which indi viduals may desire to send. 7. It occurs to us that an interesting collection might be formed of the several works in various languages published by the Governments in India for the education of the Na tives, or for the study of the languages of India ; to these might be added any similar works published by societies or individuals. 8. The mode in which these various objects can be best effected will remain for your determination, and you will consider whether, in addition to General Committees at the Presidencies, it be necessary or desirable to establish local Committees as before, and if so, as the objects are now more specific, whether a smaller number of Committees would suffice for the object in view. The expense to be incurred we must, as in our instructions of the 7th January 1850, ' commit to your judgment and discretion, premising that it is our desire, whilst any extravagant or unnecessary outlay is avoided, that the collection be such as shall be creditable and serviceable to the country from which it is received.' 9. The several articles, besides being well packed, should be carefully labelled, and, when possible, both in the English and Native character, with the name of the article, and that of ttre manufacturer or merchant by whom sent, or from whom it may have been purchased; or the latter information may be entered in the invoices, together with the prices at which the articles may be purchased, if they should be required for commercial purposes. We wish the attention of the parties to whom the formation of the collection in India may be entrusted to be particularly directed to these matters of detail, as the want of such information and of labels in many instances caused much inconvenience in the Exhibition of 1851. 10. The Exhibition is appointed to open on the 1st May 1855. The contributions from India should be despatched so as to allow ample time for their transmission to and proper arrangement in Paris, and the invoices should be sent to us by the Mail as soon as they are received from the several stations. 11. We transmit to you herewith a copy of a Memorandum by Dr. Royle on the subject of this Despatch, with a view to show the estimation in which the Indian productions were held at the Exhibition of 1851, and the encouragement afforded by that Exhibition to Indian Arts and Commerce ; and any further information which we may be able to procure upon this subject, which may be useful to you, shall be duly communicated.

LIST OF ARTICLES WHICH SEEM DESIRABLE FOR THE PARIS EXHIBITION OF 1855, A rranged according to the Classes of the Great Exhibition of 1851. The general collection of Raw Products is unnecessary. New articles or choice specimens can be sent, but in samples not exceeding a few pounds weight; as also specimens of indigo, lac, silk, sugar, tobacco, hemp, &amp;c., il individuals wish to do so. Specimens illustrating the properties of raw products would be interesting, as, for instance, skeius of cotton-wool or si Ik dyad with dift'erent dye-woods, roots, &amp;:c. in use in India, also a few specimens of Natural History, illustrating commercial articles, as horns, skins, silk, and lac, beetle-wing insects, See. A collection in small pieces of such Asiatic exports and imports as are mentioned in Indian Price Currents would be extremely valuable, if the different synonymes known at the ports of Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, &amp;c. were added. For many of the names mentioned in Indian Price Currents and Tariffs are unintelligible, even to those who have studied the subject. Dr. Royle formerly made such a collection for the Bengal Presidency, and Dr. Stocks more recently for Scinde. Mr. Underwood proposed sending such a one from Madras in 1850; similar collections were sent from Liver pool and from Hull to the Exhibition of 1851. Models of machines and tools unnecessary, except in cases of models of Native carriages or other conveyances, and such as were not sent before. Models of shipping unnecessary. Swords, daggers,'] tj i -i p • battle-axes, spears, shields, armlets and gauntlets, 0 U CU1K ' , chain and plate armour, helmets, matchlocks P 0 ' taria ' atl&lt;l a ' ^ ace&gt;ii 11 enKTfTT^ Were- , aml Casil - :e, Sciudc, and Cutch, Hyderabad. especially the inlaid and enamelled kinds, bows and arrows painted Agricultural implements or models unneccessarv.

In sending collections from different parts of India, it must be remembered that when arranged to gether , it will be impossible to distinguish the several articles unless each is carefully labellecir This siioula b'e dorftr wTt+r-thr? name-t&gt;£-Uie~alTldT?, and if possible, both in the English and Native character, also with the name of the manufacturer, or with that of the merchant or proprietor, or the latter information may be entered in the invoices, from which it could be transferred to the catalogue. It will be desirable also that only one set of numbers should be used to mark the packages from each Presidency, including the con tributions from Native Princes. Care should be taken to have the articles packed as compactly as possible, and the more fragile articles, such as pottery, in saw-dust or some similar substance. The prices at which articles may be obtained should also be given either on the labels or in the invoices. Attention to these several points would, it is believed, in many instances, lead to the transmission of orders direct to India, which would be beneficial to the producers.[ 641 ] Observations on Baron C. Dupiris request that the Court should co-operate in the Exhibition to be held in Paris in JS55. In considering the invitation of so excellent a judge as Baron Dupin, that India should, if possible, take a more distinguished place at the proposed Exhibition in Paris in the year 1855 than was so generally accorded to its productions in the Crystal Palace of 1851, I refrain from noticing what may be called the p 'litical aspects of the question, or what might be considered due to the courteous alacrity with which the 1'rench nation contributed to the Exhibition in Hyde Park, nor whether after the success achieved by India on that occasion its absence from the national concourse of 1855 would not be more remarkable than the presence of others. It will be remembered that without special preparation, indeed with barely time enough for its arrival, the Indian collection was universally acknowledged to be more complete than any other—its raw products being as varied as the Empire is extensive, and its manufactured articles, though made with tools as simple as they seemed rude, were remarkable for beauty of form, and for correctness of principle in design, as well as for unexampled skill in harmony of colouring ; or, as Baron Dupin describes India, as distinguished ' par la richesse incomparable et par la variete des productions natnrelles, par les ceuvres d'art si remarquables par I'intelligence, pour le gout et la beaufe du travail.' It is not surprising, therefore, that upwards of 200 articles were purchased out of the Indian collection by the Board of Trade for the use of the Schools of Design in this country, and now form so conspicuous an ornament of the general collection in Marlborough House. Instead of such questions, it is preferable to consider the benefit likely to accrue to the Government and people of India from another exposition of the natural and manufactured products of the country, or from the inspection of still more critical, because better-informed, examiners. The tendency of the age is certainly in favor of such Exhibitions, from the benefits which have already been experienced, because, as in a well-arranged Museum, much information is gainedrand subjects of inquiry are readilv snggeyied tu the gencridi public, while manufacturers are enabled to advance from the points which only a few may have reached, and thus general improvement is ensured. Though Indian Artists have not had the advantage of being present at such assemblages, and inspecting the works of others, and thereby improving their own, India (I hope to be able to show) has yet benefitted by the exhibition of their works. I therefore continue to value highly the advantages of ' an occasion when the latent resources of distant provinces and the skill of the least known Artist may compete with the produce of the most favored regions or the works of the most successful genius.' The results of the Exhibition of 1851 have fully confirmed the correctness of this view, for some of the least known parts of India sent pro ducts which are likely to become valuable articles of commerce, while the lace of Nagercoil was supposed by some to be a product of France, and the Mosaics of Agra were considered by the Jun r of Class XXVII. as ' at least equal to the best of those which have rendered Florence so justly famous, while the taste and design exhibited in them are greatly superior.' —Jury Reports, p. 568. As facts are more convincing than general statements, I will here adduce a few instances (and in order to save space, only a few) of the effects of the Great Exhibition of 1851. The raw prorlnrtg n rp^yTTi Vnnwn to- Lavc^ attracted 'TTrnrh tfffention. Among these I informed Dr. Hunter that Messrs. Ransome and May, of Ipswich, had said they could use Korun- dum in ship loads if it could be procured. He now writes me (23rd September 1853) that a Liverpool house had offered to take 1,000 tons annually, at 150 Rupees per ton; a London house at 500 Rupees, and another at 1,000 Rupees per ton, for different qualities. Inquiries have been made whether some of the numerous fibres were not suitable for paper making. Bast from Arrakan has been pronounced equal to that from Russia, and the Rhea fibre from Assam, which is identical with China grass, has been sent to the Court, that its commercial value may be ascertained. With regard to manufactured goods, I will refer to the high prices which the various articles realized at the auction, with the exception of such chiefly as from their size[ 642 j were unsuitable to the rooms of this country. I may also adduce the numerous imitations of Indian fabrics in the fashions of the day, and what is still more to the purpose, that from the &amp;reat admnatiou elicited for Indian manufactures, Messrs. Kisdell aud Ashcombe were induced to order a quantity of goods of different kinds from India, for sale iu this country, and have established a depot for the sale of such goods. With regard to the great admiration excited bv the Indian carpets at the Lixhihition, I may mention that having' lately visited a gentle man, who has just built-a new house, and had it furnished by Webb, of Bond Street, I saw ludirin caipet^, apparently of Mirzapore nianufacture, in the dravvinrr rn mrm ; while,Mr. Williams, the Superintendent of the Sehool HTrlhe Reform of Thugs at Jubbulpore, informs me that Jlessrs. Watson and Bell, of Bond Street, have agreed to take as many carpets of Indian patterns as lie can make. This is important, as India does not afford a sufficient domand for the suppoit of the School as far as the*carpet-makers are concerned. It is from a consideration of these facts that I entertain no doubt of the advantage to the Natives of India of their displaying the results of their taste and skill in a fresh field, especially as it is one where their excellences will be so readily appreciated, and one with which there are already considerable commercial relations, susceptible of still greater exten sion, and where also it will be gratifying to the Exhibitors to know that their merits, as he pi onuses, will be watched over by the Baron Dupin himself, and recognised in a more liberal spirit than in the Exhibition of 1851. Assuming it as desirable that India should contribute to the Paris Exhibition, the next point to consider is, how this can best be effected. The Society of Arts having attempted to induce Native manufacturers and European merchants in India to contribute on their own account to the Indian Exhibition which they propose to have held in London during the past season, it would be useless to rely on a similar plan, as few sent contributions from India. Hence it would appear incumbent on the Government of India to adopt measures similar to those jo^successtul Oil the hisr nee.ision. and-wkw4&gt; sppm t.n ho to the present state of India and its inhabitants. In adopting such a course it is necessary to consider the expense which must necessarily be incurred, but this I believe need be much less than would appear credible. From the experience which I had at the last Exhibition, as well as at the Indian Sale, I am of opinion that such an Exhibition may be made, nearly, to pay its own expenses. This I say after having compared the prices at which the several articles were brought and sold, arid the sum total which was realized after the separation from the collection of the whole of the raw products, tools, models, and the articles for the Museum, as well as the presents for Her Majesty. It would be unnecessary to have a fresh collection of raw products, of tools, of models of shipping, &amp;c., many of which were bulky, aud cost much in freight. A much smaller space would probably be allotted to India, a less numerous staff would therefore be sufficient, and the Police or Soldiers would probably be supplied by the French Government, while the double payment for the Custom House inspection could easily be avoided. Fur- ther, by confining the selection to such articles as were most admired, and do most credit to Indian taste and i?kill, as well as by multiplying the smaller articles for which good prices were realized, and which by their greater number would produce as good an effect as fewer of the laige and least saleable products, I am of opinion that a sufficient sum could be realized by a judrcsmi3 sale tu jm y « gitui ji.-uot~Uie vdi«i^^T^lTT(r&amp;rpcnses of strch an Exhibition. It is not probably necessary to enter into the details of the arrangement, but if required, I could.prepare such instructions as would bring together a collection such as would be creditable both to the Government and people of India. It might also be as effective and moit instinctive, even if moie compact, from our increased experience and greater time for preparation, and at the same time more directly beneficial to the Native Artists and Merchants. For in the first place it would be essential for each article sent to be accurately labelled in India, not only with the name of the article, but also with that of the manufac turer or merchant from whom it was purchased. This, I believe, would have the advantage, if at the same time the prices of the goods were made known, that many orders would be scut diiect to India, and thus be directly beneficial to the producers. I believe.[ 643 ] 4* inoi oovlt , that orders would also be sent for the execution in India of many commissions in winch delicacy of manual labour and taste in ornament are rec|uired. By adopting such a course, 1 believe tiiat both the Government and people of India would bo greatly benefitted by the varied natural and manufactured products of the countrv, and the taste and capabilities of its people being made more generally known to the nations of Europe. ,, _ ~ (Signed) J.

S. lo save space I have omitted references to many other subjects, but the inquiries which are pressed upon me for information regarding the raw and manufactured products o4 India, but especially regarding the former, are very numerous, and proceeding as they do from foreigners as well as'from our own merchants and brokers, furnish a favorable indication of the effects of the late Exhibition, the more-so, as I have every reason to believe that some of tue results will speedily appear among the exports from India.

Sir, I am* directed to forward, for submission to the Right Honorable the Governor in Council of Bombay, one hundred printed copies of a Despatch and its enclosures, received from the Honorable the Court of Directors by the last Mail, respecting the Exhibition of Arts and Industry proposed to be held in Paris in 1855. 2. It is the desire of the Most Noble the Governor General in Council, that full notification of the design to hold such an Exhibition should be made, as was done in the case of the Great Exhibition held in London in 1851 ; and it occurs to His Lordship in Council, that the most probable mode of ensuring success to the measures to be adopted here, in furtherance of the wishes of the Honorable Court, as expressed in the above Despatch, will be to observe the same course of proceeding, and as far as possible the same agency, that was found so well adapted to the purpose in view on the former occasion. I am accordingly directed to refer to Mr. Officiating Secretary Grey's letter to your address dated the 22nd February 1850, for a general exposition of the views and wishes of the Supreme Government on the subject of The present reference from the Honorable the Court of Directors ; and to request that the Right Honorable the Governor in Council of Bombay will give full effect to them, and promote by all possible means the success, so far as India is concerned, of the proposed Exhibition in Paris in 1855. 3.

I am directed to forward, for submission to the Right Honorable tne Governor in Council, one hundred copies of a Despatch audits enclosures, received irom the Honorable the Court of Directors by the last Mail. 2. It seems to the President in Council, that the object which the Honorable Court have in view, in connection with the projected Grand Exhibition of Industry to be held in London in 1851 will be most effectually obtained by entrusting to «he su pervision of the several local Governments all the details of the arrangements which it may be necessary to make; such general points only being fixed by instructions from the Supreme Government as may ensure a certain degree of uniformity in the procvec - ings of the local Governments, and also may enable the Supreme Government to retain an effectual control over the expenditure to be incurred, and prevent the needless transmission - -- 3. The general plan of operations which has suggested itselt to the President in Council, is the establishment of a Central Committee at die seat of each Government, and the appointment of as many Subordinate Committees, in different parts ot each Presidency, as may appear in the judgment of the local Government to be called tor. 4. The'Subordinate CommitUes, as well as the Central Committees, should each be furnished with a copy of the Honorable Court's Despatch, and its enclosuies. 5. The Subordinate Committees should be instructed to prepare with all practic able expedition, for transmission to the Central Committees, reports similar to that tui- nished by Mr. Taylor on the District of Dacca, with lists of articles ol every des-ciip- tion which in their opinion it would be desirable to transmit to the Exhihition from the circle of country placed wilhin the range of their report. Opposite to every article in the lists should be placed, as nearly as it can be ascertained, its price, and at the foot ol the lists there should be an estimate of the probable cost of carriage for the conveyance ot the whole of the articles to the Head Quarters of the Central Committee. 6. It should further be stated, in respect of the more elaborate kind ot manu factures, what length of time will probably be required for the preparation of a perfect specimen of each; and in any case wher e the time required for the mannfaefnre of an article Is so great as to make it aclv'sabl^f^nr^e an immediate order for its commence ment, the Central Committee should request the authority of the local Government for doing so, and should note the circumstance upon the face of the list. 7. As respects the bulk of the articles, however, the Central Committees, after receiving the lists from the Subordinate Committees, should proceed to theii careful revisionrremoving from all such articles as they may not deem of sufficient interest to make it desirable to send them to the Exhibition, and also all duplicates of articles of the same nature which may have been included by two or more Committees in theii lists, unless for special reasons comparison of the same article trom^dillerent distiict? should appear desirable.[ 645 ] 8. The lists thus revised should then be embodied into one general list (the particulars as 10 the estimated cost of the respective articles being still retained), and should be sent to the local Governments, by whom they will be transmitted to the Government of India, without any further delay than may be necessary to enable the local Government to record such remarks as it may be considered desirable to offer. 9. The lists rendered to the Supreme Government will thus comprise all the arti cles which it is proposed to forward to England from the whole extent ol territory situ ated within, the limits of the four Presidencies of Bengal, Agra, Madras, and Bombay. They will also show roughly t he cost of procuring the articles, and the Supreme Government will thus be able to form some definite'judgment in regard to the expense which it may be necessary to incur in this undertaking. 10. Some few of the articles, and those probably the most expensive, will, it is true, have been previously ordered under the discretion allowed by para. 6 of this Despatch ; but with regard to those articles not ordered, which will constitute the great mass of the proposed Collection, it will be for the Supreme Government to determine, with reference to the aggregate of the expenditure estimated from the four Presiden cies, as well as to other considerations, whether the whole number of articles selected by each Central Committee shall be purchased and transmitted to England, or whether it may he considered necessary to direct a curtailment of any or all of the four lists. It will probably, at all events occur, that in comparing the four lists, many of the same articles, or articles closely resembling one another, will be found repeated in two or more of them. Many of the things named, also, it may not he necessary for the Government to pur chase, owing to the same or similar products and manufactures being sent for exhibition by private individuals, or, in some instances, perhaps, by the Native Princes of the country. With regard to the probable readiness of many private individuals to send articles for exhibition, it might be advisable for the local Governments to request, by public NotIficai ion, that ail -de^prttches Lkj coimumtitewfed to-t4»e-4jfOvcrrt- ment ; and it might possibly even be worth while to encourage such private trans missions, by offering to send the articles with those despatched by the Government, and in tiiat case they should be included in the lists of the Central Committees, the owners' names being duly inserted. 11. The lists, after undergoing such revision as on any ground it may appear to the Supreme Government necessary to make, will be returned to the Central Commit tees, who will then immediately proceed to procure all those articles the purchase of which may have been sanctioned. The requisite funds will lie supplied by the local Government, under such regulations as they may prescribe, and no further reference on any fmint will be needed to the Government of India. The articles may be at once packed, as soon as they are procured, and transmitted direct to England, either to the India House, or to such other address as may be hereafter indicated. 12. Copies of the four lists, as revised by the Supreme Government, will be sent to the Honorable Court at the same time that they are returned to the Central Com mittees, in order that timely intimation may be made to those appointed to conduct the arraup-ements of the Exhibition in regard to the extent of contributions which mav be r&gt; o _ .. - v expected to arn ve^Trg m-this country. 13. The most important point to be considered, in connection with the above plan of arrangements, is obviously whether the plan will leave sufficient time for the pur chase and transmission of the articles to England, subsequent to the return of the lists from Calcutta to the Central Committees. 14. The President in Council does not apprehend that the Exhibition is likely to take place till towards the close of the summer of 1851, but granting that the bulk of the collections should not be despatched from this country late^than the 1st of January in that year, there are ten clear months from this date, and that time seems to His Honor in Council to be sufficient for -carrying out the arrangements for the supply of[ 646 ] articles in the manner suggested in this letter. If six months are calculated to be occupied from this date before the Subordinate Committees are fairly set to work, ano two months are allowed to those Committees for the preparation ol their Reports, the lists should be in the hands of the Central Committees at latest by the 15th of June; more than six weeks ought not to be occupied in the revision of the lists, their trans mission to the Supreme Government, and their return to the Central Committees. This would bring the time up to the Ist of August, which would leave five clear months for purchasing, packing, and despatching the articles to England. 15. But although it may be desirable that the great bulk of the collection, in order that it may arrive in England some weeks previous to the time fixed for the Exhibition, should be despatched as early as the 1st of January, the President in Coun cil does not apprehend that there will be any risk of articles not reaching England in time, which are despatched at subsequent dates, certainly up to the middle of February ; and light goods might even, if necessary, be transmitted at a still later date by the Overland Route. By that route also, advice should be given of all despatches which are sent round the Cape, accompanied by a list of the articles shipped in each vessel. 16. By keeping as closely as may be practicable, in each stage of the undertaking, within the limits that have been indicated above, and making at the same time as exten sive a use of the discretion allowed by para. 6th of this letter as may seem expedient, the President in Council sees no reason to doubt that the several local Govern merits will be able to complete and transmit to England, in time, such collections of the products and manufactures of this vast Empire as will constitute a striking and interesting feature in the Grand London Exhibition of 1851. 17. It is, however, obvious, that every possible exertion must be made, and every precaution taken, to prevent the slightest unnecessary delay in any one stage of the proceedings. Much will depend, in particular, upon the time occupied m oiganizing the CommTureKand still more,' pcrhap^, on LllU CUicJ U'liidi may Uf uikf-u in organizing them. If care is taken to select Gentlemen for the local Committees who are well qualified, both by their attainments, their tastes, and their inclinations, for the task allotted to them, many of those Committees will doubtless be able to prepare their Reports iu a shorter period than two months, and thus enable the Central Committees to submit their revised lists to the Government at an earlier date than has been calculated. 18. Tlie selection of Gentlemen for the Committees—the Central as well as the Subordinate Committees—will, of course, rest with the local Governments, and the President in Council cannot doubt that, independently of the Officers of Government, any Gentleman whose services it may be thought desirable to obtain will be ready to afford them upon such an occasion. 19. It is probable that it may be necessary to afford the Central Committees the temporary assistance of one or more English writers, and possibly, also, some assifttauce of the same kind to the other Committees. Any small expense of this sort the President in Council authorises the local Governments to incur, without previous reference to Calcutta, reporting, however, in the usual form, that they !ia\e (.lone so. 20. In conclusion, I am desired to say tha t an y points which are unprovided for by this letter, or regarding which doubts may arise, shou 1 tPbe decided by the local Government, without reference to the Government of India. I have the honor to be, &amp;,c. (Signed) Vv. GREY, Officiating Secretary to the Govt, of India. Fort William r the ttnd February 1850. • (True Copies) (Signed) C. J.

However, the various enclosures within letters naturally pre-date the letters to which they are attached. Aside from these exceptions, there is one stand-alone letter, dated 20 February 1855, which is out of sequence with the rest of the file.The second section of the file (folios 51-77) generally proceeds from early to late 1854; however, it is not in strict chronological order: many of the items are followed by those of an earlier date.</extent><extent>Pagination: There is an original pagination sequence, which is written in ink, in the top right corners of the rectos and in the top left corners of the versos.Foliation: There is a foliation sequence, which is circled in pencil, in the top right corner of the recto of each folio. This sequence begins on the front cover, on number 1, and ends on the inside of the back cover, on number 78. The following anomalies are present in the sequence: f 1 is followed by f 1A and f 1B; f 36 is followed by f 36A. The foliation sequence is the sequence which is used by this catalogue to reference items within in the file.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file consists of letters sent from and to the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. The two officials corresponding on behalf of the Residency are Arnold Burrowes Kemball, Resident in the Persian Gulf, and Herbert Frederick Disbrowe, Assistant Resident in the Persian Gulf, who is stated as being in charge of local duties at Bushire.The file is divided into two sections: '1854/55: Bushire Residency, Persia' (folios 1A-50), and '1854/55 Bushire Residency, General' (folios 51-77). A large proportion of the first section of the file consists of letters written from the Residency to William Taylour Thomson, Her Britannic Majesty's Chargé d'Affaires at the Court of Persia, Tehran. This section also contains one letter addressed by William Taylour Thomson to the Resident.Other figures engaged in correspondence with the Residency include: Meerza [Mirza] Reza, Persian Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and Mirza Hassan Ally Khan (also spelled Meerza Hussein Ali Khan), Governor of Bushire (also referred to as the Durya Begee). Most of the Residency's correspondence with the Governor of Bushire is enclosed within the letters addressed to William Taylour Thomson. These letters, and their enclosures, primarily concern two subjects: the Governor of Bushire's proposal to erect a bastion in front of the Residency (deemed unnecessary by the Resident); the reported oppression and molestation, by some of the Governor of Bushire's sirbaz [foot soldiers], of British dependents connected with the Residency (particular attention is given to an incident in which a sirbaz allegedly mistreated a waterman employed by the Residency).Other subjects covered in the first section include the liberation of slaves imported from Africa into various ports in the Gulf, and relations between the British and the Persians.The second (and smaller) section of the file contains the Resident's correspondence with the following British officials: Edward Eden Elliot, Accountant General at the Government of Bombay; John George Taylor, Her Majesty's Consul and Honourable Company Agent, Bussorah [Basra]; Henry Creswicke Rawlinson, Political Agent in Turkish Arabia and Her Majesty's Consul General, Baghdad; Lieutenant Edward Francis Tierney Fergusson, Indian Naval Draughtsman. Kemball's correspondence with Rawlinson, which makes up the bulk of this section, discusses aspects of the Crimean War, including the Russian army's operations in Armenia and the state of the Turkish [Ottoman] army.Also included in this section are the following items of printed material: papers issued by the Foreign Office entitled 'Part IV, Eastern Papers: Instructions of the British and French Governments for the Joint Protection of British and French Subjects and Commerce'; a notification from the Bombay Government concerning the appointment of a central committee to arrange the collection and eventual transmission to England of selected specimens of the raw produce and manufactures of India (included in this document is a list of articles deemed desirable for the Paris Exhibition of 1855).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Governor of Bushire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Persia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Turkish Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Slave emancipation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Crimean War (1853-1856)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000073#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
