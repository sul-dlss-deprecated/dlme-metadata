                           Firoze. Kemball encloses to Anderson a letter (folio 234) received from Commander Drought, commanding officer of the
                           Firoze, dated 14 June 1854. In his letter Drought reports that after the grounding, he sent a request to Shaikh Jaber I Al-Sabah, the ruler of Koweit [Kuwait], seeking assistance in the unloading of guns and cargo to refloat the
                           Firoze. Six boats were sent to assist the
                           Firoze,by which time the British vessel had already successfully refloated. Drought recommends financial reward for the Shaikh of Kuwait and the boat crews that sailed out to assist the
                           Firoze. In his own letter to Anderson, Kemball requests that Government make available 500 rupees for this reward.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x000035#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
