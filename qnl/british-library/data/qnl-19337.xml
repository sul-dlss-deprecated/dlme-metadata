                           Queen. Disbrowe’s letter includes a copy of letter no.95 of 1855 (folios 138-41) from Commodore R. Ethersey, Commanding Officer Persian Gulf Squadron, addressed to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated 10 September 1855. Ethersey reports on a positive outcome in both affairs: the giving up of two boats for destruction at Abu Dhabi (though not the boats involved in the original act of piracy), and the pledge to pay a fine for the act of piracy committed, and a written apology from the Shaikh of Dubai for the stone-throwing incident. The second attachment is a copy of letter 316A of 1855 (folios 142-43) from Disbrowe to Ethersey, dated 24 September 1855, which is a formal response to Ethersey’s report.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024052050.0x00002f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
