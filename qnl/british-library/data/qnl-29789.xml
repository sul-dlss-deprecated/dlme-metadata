Hie British Consulate, MUSCAT. 16th Majr # 1930* d) l^Iy dear Sir Rupert, ffoen I saor the Saltan in Salalah I asked whether he would be prepared to extend the same courtesy ugaln as regards supplying a copy of the budget* Ae Sultan has replied that the Muscat Government are contemplating the publication of an Annual Administration Report, in which information about the budjet will be included, and this will be made available to His Majesty* s Government. Ke does not wish to continue to supply the budjet as formerly as this is reminiscent of loan days. Prom this it may be concluded that the Sultan will be very chary about accepting any loan for any enterprise, _f .lo means any tiind of financial supervision. Complete Independence is becoming a complex with the Sultan, it seems. Yours sincerely. H{ His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIS., CSI.
