Memoranda. Assab Bay. Demi-official Note from Sir W. Merewetiter to the Private Secretary to the Secretary of State. My view of the case is that it is most desirable to prevent other nations meddling’and causing difficulties along the coasts from Suez to Guardafui, not from any selfish restrictions on trade, hut to prevent future political complications. Egypt or the Porte may not be the best managers of countries or governments to deal with, but they are only two. We are now getting Italy added, and Prance is again actively showing at Obokh, con sequently on the success the Italians have gained at Assah Day. W. L. Merewether. 30th September 1880. Sir Henry Rawlinson. I confess that I attach very much importance to the principle of keeping the other European powers out of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, and that not from any selfish consideration as to British trade, but with a view to the permanent safety of our communications with India. Hitherto we have been able to push forward the Porte and Egypt as the parties mainly interested in preventing European interlopers from “ Sipiatting on the shores of the Red Sea, but the time may come, and perhaps has come, when this vicarious opposition can no longer he offered, and we shall thus be con fronted with the main question in all its naked difficulty. Can we buy up local claims, as they are offered, at Assab, or Obokh, or Tajura? Can we boldly tell Prance and Italy that we will not allow the route to India beyond the Suez Canal to be dominated by their armed settlements r Can we ourselves obtain the cession of Suakim or Massowa and establish ourselves there in such strength as to swamp the French and Italian settlements in the neighbourhood ? In the immediate case under discussion I think the safer course would be to deny categorically the right of Italy to Assab, but at the same time to say that for the present we are satisfied with the engagement that no Italian troops or fortifications shall be established there. And before anything definite is arranged, I think we should call on the Indian Government for a full statement of their views upon the general question. ^ q Rawlinson. 6th October 1880. Sir R. Montgomery. I do not see how we can keep the European powers out of the Red Sea, unless wc are prepared to use force. c a n ^ We have resisted as long as we could, but the opening ol the Suez Canal has necessitated other nations, in the interest of commerce, to obtain coaling stations and supplies for their ships. In case of a war with any of the powers who may form stations, we are so powerful as compared with them in these regions, that we could at once take possession of their stations. For the sake of consistency as to the past, I think we ma} fairly say that wc have always held that the coast line is under the Turkish and Egyptian 471 alway I. 2400. M?Governments, but so long as the Italian Government acts on the note ol the 19th April last, viz., “That no Italian Government establishment of a ■“ military character will ever be formed at Assab, and that &lt;it no time will “ either troops or fortifications be maintained, on the islands oi the 13ay, we shall not interpose. We might then send to India copies of the correspondence. 11 . Montgomery. 7th October 1880. Sir E. Perry. The practical question arising out of these papers seems to be that stated by the ^Resident at Aden on the 24th July last, viz., it must now be decided whether our Government should put any pressure on the Khedive to assert his territorial rights. I should he disposed to answer this query decidedly in the negative. The question of the Sovereignty of the Red Sea Coast, including Assab Bay is evidently a very entangled one, on which probably the arguments of the British Government in favour of Egypt may be the most weighty. But the Italian Government have also forcible grounds to rely on in support of their pretensions. And Egypt, to whom the duty of assertion of right immediately belongs, appears somewhat indifferent on the subject, and, indeed, we learn * T T , ^ T from Mr. Malet* that Egypt is not dis- * Letter to Lord Granville, 1st June 1880. i • i. c i 0,7 hi i posed to interfere unless they have a &lt;&lt; positive assurance that, if necessary, they will receive mot'e than our moral “ support.’ , If Her Majesty’s Government is not disposed to give any such pledge would it not be better at once to say so, and to frame a despatch in the sense suggested hy Sir R. Montgomery. It has always appeared to me to be an unsound policy to attempt to thwart other European powers in their legitimate attempts to extend their com merce. It is a policy that no English statesman would venture openly to avow, and it is a policy extremely difficult to carry out. With respect to the danger to India of commercial ports being allowed to rise up which may hereafter become important strategic positions, I do not blind myself to the fact that the present prosperous position of England is looked on with a jealous eye by many continental powers and that probably no great love to us is borne by any, but such feeling would be much and justly increased if it he shown that in our international relations we are entirely governed by selfish motives. The power of England, to my mind, is based on the following conditions, in none of which can I trace any symptom of default. 1. Her insular position. 2. Her free institutions. 3. Her industrial energy and resources. 4. Her ability and desire to maintain a navy sufficient to protect her interests in all parts of the world. If it should be our misfortune to enter into hostilities hereafter with Italy, Trance, Germany, or other power, it might be of great advantage to us to find points on which our navy could operate with effect, and the dreaded coaling stations on the African coast and elsewhere might become useful auxiliaries to us. 8th October. E. Perry.3 Sir Frederick Halliday. I entirely agree with Sir R. Montgomery and Sir Erskine Perry, and would reply accordingly. J I would decidedly refuse to push Egypt forward to fight our battle • for this is what it means when it is suggested that the Khedive should assert his rights. We are supposed to think it against our interests that Italy should establish a station on the African coast of the Red Sea, on territory which is not ours. Therefore, it is suggested that we should incite the Khedive to assert what we say is his claim to it. The Khedive says, “ Very o-ood, but if it comes to blows will you stand by me ? ” Whereupon we are silent. All this seems to me petty. If we think it our interest to keep Italy off, we ought to tell Italy to keep off. Rut this we have neither the right to do nor, apparently, the inclination. In fact, we can’t pretend to do this as to Italy, or any other power ; nor do I think we need do it. Let us deal fairly and above board now with all Powers, and if ever a time comes when force may be needed, we may trust our power to use it, all the more that we have not, previously, been led into petty display of selfishness. 12th October 1880. F. J. Halliday. Sir Henrv Maine. There does not appear to be any difference of opinion as to the answer which the Secretary of State should be advised to give to the Forei°-n Office It should be— 1. That the Italian Government be informed that we adhere to our view of the sovereignty over the west coast of the Red Sea being in Egypt as representing Turkey. 2. That the Khedive be not required by us to assert his sovereignty actively at the disputed locality. 3. That we tell the Italian Government we have no intention of inter fering, so long as the engagement is maintained to take no steps towards the military occupation of Assab Bay. It is impossible not to see that the opening of the Suez Canal has rendered it difficult or impossible for this country to persevere inflexibly in the policy so vigorously asserted in the occupation of Perim. It was exactly because Lord Palmerston foresaw the consequences now showing themselves that he opposed the construction of the Canal. But I see considerable advantage in maintaining theoretically the Egypto-Turkish sovereignty over the west coast of the Red Sea, which, moreover, seems to me to have international grounds of some strength in its favour. As far as the signs of the times can be read, they point to the dissolution of the Turkish Empire. But they seem to me to point also to the survival of Egypt as a substantive State, not, however, independent, but under the joint protectorate of the greater European Powers, and possibly neutralized. Such a State might be a valuable instrument in obtaining a new condition of the Red Sea as a neutral sea, with coasts open to the commercial settlements of the European Powers, but incapable of being used for military occupation. It seems to me that our own interests, and those of Europe generally, would be served by our seconding, in theory at all events, the claim of Egypt to sovereignty over these coasts, and that these interests would be injured by dissolving the sovereignty among a number of petty chiefs, each ready to sell his whole territorial rights to the first pushing European Power w ho will pay a small sum of money for them. 12th October 1880.
