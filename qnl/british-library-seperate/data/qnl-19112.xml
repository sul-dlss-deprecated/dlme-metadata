Some of the named individuals appear with birth and death dates, as well as brief biographical information.A section of 'Notes' is included that gives the year of compilation as 1907, as well as other details concerning the arrangement of the table, including: its completeness; the omission of all females; 'issue' means 'male issue'; the ordering of sons from the same father according to seniority from left to right; dates of birth, and in some cases death, are approximate only; when the fact or date of death is not mentioned the person was probably alive in 1906; persons shown in the table reside in Qatar or Hasa unless otherwise stated.
