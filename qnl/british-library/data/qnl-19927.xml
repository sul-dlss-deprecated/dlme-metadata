Item R, Expenditure. Since the introduction of reforms &amp; the formation of the Bahrain Court a number of cases have arisen in which it was . ' a O ^ ound that Shaik Elisa had, in late years, sold plots of land twice over, or sold land belonging to others without their knowledge.The only fair settlement in a number of cases has been for the State to compensate one of the parties. The Deputy Ruler has settled a number of such cases during the last year.It is considered probable thatii in connect- t ■ * • ion with the land settlement 8c record of rights a number of fresh cases may come to light 8c it has be n thought prudent to allow a sum for such purposes.

The Adviser, Bahrein State has furnished me with 2 copies of his Budget for the ensuing year. As the Hoia»blo the Political Hesident aay wish to see it, I enclose one copy for his information* The Budget has been framed on a very conservative 'basis and actual takings already exceed the estimate by Rs. 1,0i3,000/- although three aonths only have passed. Mr. Belgrave, however, points out that account must be taJten of the fact thAt income during the last 3 months of a year are usually very meagre. A certain margin has been left in the expenditure side but this will probably be required to meet outgoings on account of tee disbanded LAvy Corps, the raising of the new Police Force and the Government of India's charges for the detachikent . of the Indian Army bow in Bahrein. kr.Belgrave points out that no provision has been made for compensating Arab owners nhose property has been confiscated by the Bahrein State. As, however, the Dowasir have I hitherto shown no desire to come to any terms with shaikh Hamad* s Government, I think that this point may safely be ignorec. political Agent, Bahrein. ^ ^ s&amp;crmS- —/f/flt Ho. 519-S of i.926 Britibh Kesidency &amp; Contiulate-General $ Bush!re 9 t^he 6th December 1926« To The Political Agent, Bahrain MEMOHMDUM Reference your memoranaum No. 112/9/%t ciatecL the ii5rd October with which were enclosed two copies of Uio Bahrain L»ta4e iiud^et iistiiiiates for 1346, the Hon'ble the poli^ical Resident has noticed that no jbistimates were submitted to this office for the year x544. He accorain^ly wisnes that the actual figures for that year shoulu be sunmarised unaer the usual neaas, ana suomitted to him, so that he may compare the figures for the last 2 years. 2. Your attention ia also invited to the fact that in September last, when trie Hobble the political Resident was in Bahrain, Mr. Belgrave furnished him witn a cash statement for 1344 uhowing an opening balance of Rs. 8,00,320 ana a closing balance of Rs. 5,38,467. 3. These figures aiffer materially from those shown as the closing balance in the 1343 estimate, forwarded by Major Daly with hib memoranaum No. 169/9/2, aated the lith July 1924, ana as the opening balance now shown for 1345. 4. It is understoca that the former discrepancy is due to an excess of Rupees two lajihs in the Customs Receipts and to the fact that a balance of Rupees three lakhs in Bombay was brought into account, but the second discrep ancy in the opening balance for 1346 is not understood. 5. Your attention is also invited to the fact that though the income for the year is only estimated at Rs. 6,69,478, the expenditure totals Rs. 17,72 ,926.- 2 - The Hon 1 ble the political Resident conbiders that borne at least of the balance in hand at the begining of the year should be retained as a reservet as it v«ill te quite impossible to maintain anything approaching this rate of expenditure in immediately succeeding years. 6* 1 am also to draw your attention to the item Civil List, allowances to Kuling Pamily, which seems unduly high, and is actually more than that shown in the estiniates for 1343.

Dated the 21st January 1927 To The Secretary to the 7 (c 1i 'IDEtlTIAL RECORDS. fV Hon''ble the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, BI j SHIR j.j . liemoranduin „ Please refer to your raeraorandura lTo.519-S. dated the 6th December 1926, The reason for the omission to furnish Budget estimates for the year 1344 is given in the enclosed letter No.469/11 dated the 17th January 1927 from the Adviser to the Bahrein Government. I understand from iJ.Belgrave that the compilation of figures relating to past years has been a matter of great difficulty as accounts were not audited. He informs me of one case in which a sum of Hs.3,800/- was carelessly entered on three separate occasions as Rs.380/- and incorrect totals were thus reached. Such mistakes naturally make /accounts unreliable, reallv i.y predecessor 's/astounding energy established a certain amount of order, but minute personal supervision of ail departments of the State administration, in addition to the heavy work which om i nnwi i j' falls to the lot o. the Politi-al Agent at Bahrein in the ordinary course, was too much even for a man of liajor Daly's outstanding industry unassisted as he was byi.a trained subordinate staff. I think in the circumstances it would be better to ignore any estimates based on the Bahrein State Budget for 1345 as it is by no me ^ns a reliable guide as to the actual state of affairs. 2. Kr.Belgrave has now again scrutinised the figures ior 1344, ab a result of his scrutiny he confirms the figures2. Rs .8, 00, 320/- ag the opening 'balance 'but ^ives Rs .9,Go,443/- , * as the closing balance. 5 % The estimates for 1343 are (.^uite unre-iaule, line rigure of Rs .5,38,487/- quoted Toy kr.Bel^rave to Colonel rriaeaux is a bij^ underestimate of the actual position as disclosed when he pre oared the figures for this Budget, us.o, v,,7:^/- oi the difference is due to the fact that, he did not inc I ide the Stctww money held hy Lloyds Bank in Bombay. 4„ a total expenditure of Rs.17,72,926/- for the current year is not now expected, as explained 'by Lr..^el^raver tne expenditure for the current year 1345 v/as estimated at a ver^ high figure owing to the expectation that payments would have to 'be made for several public Works commenced in former ye£.rs. It is noly expected that very considerable savings will ue made so that a large sum should remain in reserve on the com pletion of the year. In future years 1'r.Belgrave will budget for a reserve. 5. ^.s explained by 1. r .Belgrave the increase in the allowances paid to the Ruling family is due to the acceptance during the current year of the Rs.4000/- payable to . , . S'-aikh oir Isa \ bin ^li, which he had refused to touch it* past years. This although a disadvantage from a purely financial point oi vi'_-w is a distinct political gain. The allowances paid to the aI Khalifa family are cat of all proportion to the revenue from the point of view oi an European administration and I am quite sure the ^taV- aoes not reap a commensurate advantage froi- this heavy expeno.iture, These allowances are, however, part of the system oi Government which has been in force since the Knaliia lamily estaclished themselves in Banrein. The underlying iaea appears to oe tnaL the islands were conquejfred bj the family and tne ruling administers them for the benefit of the iaL-ily as a 'wnole, each member of which considers himself entitled in virtue oi his birth to a share oi what I mignt describe as tne plunuer. In the past a single suuorainate memoer has on more than oneoccaaion received more than naif the revenuet of the island. This conception of tne unity o£ the hnalifa faiuily is oorne out by the system under which, as Shailda Hamad inform me, it holds its lands. The ruling Shaiidi gilts lanas to various memoers of the family, but on the deatn of the holder tne property aoes not necessarily descend to his legal heirs 'but is resumed hy the ShaiKh and re-granted to such members of the j\1 hhalifa as he considers most deserving. The ruling ShaiJm is no douot guiaei in such matters by a family council. If the State is to prosper on modern lines this large alienation of revenues will have to be curtailed. Shaikh Hamad has promised that he will not grant any further allowances from public funds to members of the ^1 Knalifa without consulting the Political Agent ana I have assured n-r,Belgrave of my support in preventing any further ai additions of this sort to the Bahrein Civil List. Political x^ent, Bahrein,V* GOVERHKEHT OF BAHRAIM Offioe of the Adviser, Government of Bahrain. Dated 17th Jany '£7/l3th Eajab '45, Ho.489/H. To \ The H. B. M 's Political Agent, Bahrain, Sir, With reference to letter HD: 519/S of 1926, from the British Residency and Consul General, Bushire, forwarded 'by you for my information, I have the honour to make the following remarks.- 1. With reference to paragraph one; no annual Budget was made for the Bahrain State for the year 1344. At that time and until sometime after my arrival, all the financial work of the State was in the hands of H. B. M 1 s Political Agent, who dealt with it partly at the Government Office and partly at the Agency. Major Daly was on leave during part of 1343 and part of 1344, and it appears that the acting Political Agent made no Budget, but authorised expenditure roughly on the Scale of the Budget for 1343. Major Daly on his return to Bahrain made a provisional Budget for the remaining seven months of the year, dated 27th Jamadi A1 Awal, 'but this Budget was cancelled and substituted by another one dated 12th Shawal, for the remaining three months of 1344. When I began to do the financial work of the State, the second of these Budgets was in force. Owing to all this, it has been extremely difficult to verify records of all the accounts for 1344. A corrected statement of Revenue and Expenditure for that1 -2- that year, as far as can''be ascertained from the existing records, is attached. I would mention that during this time there was no regular accountant clerk in the Government Office, and much of the work and accounts were done hy Major Daly himself. 3. With reference to paragraphs two and three. In the Budget for 1343, the estimated closing 'balance was put at Rs. 2,46,310/-, hut the actual closing 'balance was greatly in excess of this estimate for the following reasons. (I) Only Rs. 56,173/- was spent out of the three lacs which were allocated to Water Supply. (II) An increase of Rs. 2,17,661/- over the estimated Rs. 10,25,000/- received from the Customs. This large increase seems to have resulted from the war in Arabia which closed Red Sea ports and so increased imports into Nejd, via the Gulf; also from a good pearling season in 1342. 4. The saving from I and the increase in II, would result in an additional Rs. 4,61,488/- to the estimated closing 'balance from 1343. The 1343 Budget is stated to have been a very conservative one; the difference between the estimated closing balance and the actual closing balance was about Rs. 5,50,000/- . 5. During the years 1343 &amp; 44, various amounts were transferred from the funds in Bahrain and put into deposit account at the Lloyd 1 s Bank, Ltd., Bombay. The closing balance shown in the attached statement does not include the three lacs which were on fixed deposits at the end of 1344. 6. The opening balance for 1344 was made up as follows. Cash in Fixed Deposits Rs. 3,00,000/- Current accounts, Bombay 82,789/- Bahrain. 1.09,189/- 1,91,9 78/- Survey Account .. .. .. 51,786/- Deposit Account 3,59,684/- Rs. 9,03,448/--3- 7. T 7hen the second Budget was made for 1344, the separate aooounts then existing, which nuinbered about a dozen, were all merged into three., the Consolidated Fund, the Deposit account, and the Survey Account, Various amounts which were held in the custody of the Government, such as deposits made by Brokers, Police, and monies due to the various Oourt Gases, are included in the Deposit Account, For this reason the total cash in the deposit account is shown as an asset and certain amount is shown on the Debit side of the Budget as due to the Deposit Account, 8. With reference to paragraph 4; the estimated expenditure for 1345 is necessarily large owing to payments for several important Public 7 /orlcs falling due during the year, such as the Shaikh 1 3 Hew Palace in Manama, the Sea Road, and the State Offices, and also payment for most of the wells under the well-boring contract. 9. At the same time I would point out that the amount of Rs, 1,00,000/- set apart for the Electric Pov/er Scheme, can be considered as a reserve, as it is unlikely that the State will be committed to any such scheme during the year. It is certain that at the most only half of the allotment for the upkeep of Roads will be spent, and it is also sure that a saving of atleast half of Rs, 25,000/- for compensation in Land CJases, will be effected. The expenditure on Education is shown at Rs. 36,000/- whereas the total expenditure is Rs, 12,000/- and the balance is merely set aside for future developments in this direction, 10. It is quite understood that the expenditure for 1344 is out of proportion to the Revenue, This is owing to the various Public 7orks mentioned above.They were deoided,in most oases actually oomraenoed^ 'before my arrival. increase under this head is accounted for 'by the allowance now made to H, E. Shaikh Isa Bin Ali, of Rs. 4,000/- per month. During previous years, I under stand that he refused to accept this, and so no provision was made for it in the Budget. I am forwarding a separate letter on this subject. for the half year ending 30th Jamadi A1 Thany 1345 - 28th December 1926, from which the financial position of the State can be clearly ascertained. 11.

Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith the nev/ Bud get for the year 1346 together v/ith attached explanatory notes 'by the ^.dvieer to the Govtrnment of Bahrein. f- will be noticed on perusal, the finances of Bahrein- y' are in a most satisfactory condition and the estimated re- current expenditure is within the estimated revenue, the actual revenue will, however, undoubtedly 'be much more than the estimate while the expenditure v/ill not change. There is also a substantial amount of money on ha-nd to allow for schemes, public works etc., still leaving Hs,2 lacs in deposit as a reserve fund. There are still improve ments in the matter of increased efficiency in the educa tion system and agricultural experiments which are very desirable and are being carried out on a small scale but any serious effort in this direction is impossible until further economies are effected on the expenditure side whick. ic still much too great. On 'li^t'ning to page 7 of txit Budget it will be noticed that cut of the total recurring expenditure of about Rs• 9-i- lacs nearly Re ,5 lacs arc spent on the Civil List -md Allowances of the Ruling lamily, this anuunt is excessive, far more than is paid in Muscat State, most of the reci pients are in possession of large date gardens seized ori ginallyoriginally from the Bahrani owners and ar« in addition lazya^-X indigent ignorant of and unwilling to learn any sort of trade to support themselves. It is on this iteni that reductions can be made and I am addressint: you a separate communication on the subject. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, ain.

Sir, I have the honour to forward herewith the new Budget for the year 1346 together with the annual returns and explanatory notes showing particulars of revenue and expenditure for 1345. The Budget. 1346 . The Budget is, as usual, on an extremely conservative hasis. The receipts are estimated low and the expenditure is estimated high. Last year a revenue of 2s 7,50,000/- was estimated for Customs Receipts which actually amounted to Hs 9,6^,051/ . therefore for the new year I have estimated Customs Receipts at Rs 8,50,000/-. Last year was admittedly a very poor year owing to a bad pearl season. ihis year the pearl season is, so far, better than it has 'been for the last three years. it can be safely expected that trade will improve to a corresponding extent. At th* the same time a margin of one lakh, as against lastpyea^s actuals, has been allowed in the estimated revenue to cover any unforseen falling off.The only other considerable difference between the estimated rerenue for 1345 and 1346 is a decrease of 13,000/- from rents of Gorernaient Lands etc., owing to the restoration to the Dawasir of their property which was previously let by the Gorernaient. I would point out that the annual revenue, apart from Gash Loans, assets etc. as estimated in the Budget is about fis 9,19,646/-. Expenditure . The first and heaviest item on the expenditure side is allowances to the Ruling Family, which amounts to 4,69,344/- that is more than half the estimated total of the annual Revenue. The amount appears, in my opinion, to be excessively large but constant requests have been made by H.E.Shaikh Hamad, ever since I have been here that it should be increased. At the time that the scale of allowances wa« laid dowfi, some four years ago, it was stated that the s^ale was liable to revision. i beg to suggest that the time has come for a revision to be made and that this revision should consist of a reduction. I am writing separately on this subject. II. ESTABLISHMENTS This covers the various departments of the Government.

Considering that the year was a bad one the rerenue results seem satisfactory* / There was an increase of Rs. 79,147/- in Customs Receipts oyer the previous year. There was a decrease of Bs 43,795/- in other revenue which can be accounted for, and which is explained in my notes, over the previous year. The nett result is an increase of Rs. 54,253/- from regular annual revenue sources over the previous year. This does not include amounts realised by royalty on oil concession and sales of Government Land, which naturally, cannot be counted upon as recurring every year. The balance of State Funds at the end of 1345 was Rs. 5,43,544. At the end of 1344 the balance was Bs 9,03,448/- but this included the Deposit Account, Ks. 3,59,684/- which was not a real asset, as it ✓ consisted mainly of money held in trust by the btate which was subsequently paid out by the State during 1345. The expenditure for 1345 of ks . 17,65,434/- ^ would appear to be extremely large considering that the estimated revenue for 1345 was only fis 8,35,065/-. It will be seen though that during the year 1345 the State paid off the final balances for the-5- the large pablic works and schemes entered into during the previous year, such as the water supply, Sea Koad, falace and Offices, and also the State paid out all the money which it held in trust for the public^ so that at the 'beginning 1346 it has no liabilities such as building contracts etc. and all the funds shown in the Budget are the actual cash assets and real property of the State. The financial position is of the State/therefore considerably better at the beginning of this year than it was at the beginning of 1345. It is a curious fact that the balance at the end of 1345 is only Ss 120/- less than the balance at the end of 1344 after deducting the deposit account. I hare the honour to be. Sir. Your Obedient Servant, Financial Adviser, Bahrain State.I ey Notes on Hevenue Comparison. 1. Customs. There Is an increase of Es. 79,147 over the o«+-na1 rp^pfnts for 1344. The Customs show a general increase on all imports the most conspiouous being as follows.- Increase over 1344 to^ nearest hundredl^. Rice Wheat Flour ———————— Sugar Loaf sugar Coffee ^s. 32,000 1,300 2,500 8,500 6,000 24,000 Tea 16,500 Considering that the pearl season daring 1344 was admittedly I poor one; this increase is very satisfactory. The increase, under sugar and tea has possibly some^connection with uhe increased taxes on these commodities in Persia. 2. Motor Licenses. An axtention of the time allowed ror paving these licenses was made at the end of 1345 aco ording o which the licenses for 1346 fall due on the end of Maharam 46, and therefore only a few are included in 1345. 3. Rents. Owing to the 'badness of the pearl and t;he poor - drHTe harvest In 1344 the Huler granted a 20$ reduotion from the leases of all dategardens. Tftis, and the sales of various gardens which previously belonged to the Government have resulted in a smaller revenue during 1345. Ahoat hal^ of the dategardens 'belonged previously to the Dawasir, and have now 'been returned to them which result in a further decrease of revenue in 1346. 4. Judicial Receipts. are made up as follows The total receipts under this head Rs. 22,094 1,973 2,363 1 # Gourtfees and Fines 2. Land Registration fees 3. Stamps on Leases of Dategardens The total increase over 1344 is Rs. 8,050,/-, which is due mainly to the ever increasing amount of litigation. 5. Miscellaneous. This item includes sale of certain surplus 'building material. I have not shown a compari son between the Revenue of 1345 and the Estimated revenue of B 45 because, asjbreviously stated, the estimated revenue was made on such an basis. The total estimated real revenue for 1345 was Rs. 8 50 978/-« The actual revenue amounted to i\s. 11,^^ ,olo/- a■Dart , from such items as amalgamation of accounts and deposit accounts, which shows an increase of Rs. 2.88,840/- over the estimated.13 57 Notes on Expenditure for 1345. f Items 1,2,3, 8c 4, Expenditure under these heads finally oompletes the payments for four Important public works entered upon last year and the year before.

The 'Deposit Account' consists mostly of deposits in various criminal and civil suits pending in the Bahrein Court. The cases are heard and judgments delivered, without long notice and it is impossible to know when payments will bo made, jt has therefore been difficult to place any portion of the Deposit Account on deposit for any fixed period. The amounts l^eep changing from time to time, as old &gt; cases are settled, and fresh deposits received* in new on fixed deposit in Bombay yielding interest varying from^. cases. i?our lacs of the Grovernment funds are at present ^ /£• It is hoped that another lac will shortly be added to the above, owing to satisfactory receipts. muchj have tho honour to be, Sir, Your moat, oheclieiit servant, 3:1.0 .Dalryraple Beln;rave, Financial Advjger to the Government of Bahrein. r/ • -V ^ ^, v OL * 19/176.

The Secretary to the Hon'hle the Political Kesident in the Perbian Gulf, Bushire• Sir, I have the honour to forward in 'triplicaoc the 'budget of the Bahrain State, together with a most interest- -ing review of the past years working 'by kr. Belgrave, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. There i« much that I should like to say regard- ■•iyj;- 'this oud^ct, but in. the absence o^ a stenogra^fuLer, it will, I fear, be impossiole to do more than draw attentior to a few points. This appears also to have been the practice in the past, and critical surveys have not been called for. 3 # A disquieting feature is the fact that total revenue for the past year was less by some 26,000 rupees. This decrease would have been greater but for increased vigilance in the Customs department which enabled the amounts recovered from passengers uaggage wo be increased from Rs 57,662 to Rs 53^990. An explariati oxi .)i how this was achieved is given in the llotes on revenue collected. The collections this year have been dis- -appointing so far, and there is little doubt that the maximum of revenue at the present rates is being collected. Any 1^ A ■ Any drop, cuch as a dtop in 'thft Cubtoras, ( v/iiich would inevitably occur ifj for instance, the pres ^iit Director werf replaced by some one leoa qualified, ) would liavc a most serious effect as the expenditure has fully kept pace with the increased revenue, ana would 'be very difficult to retrench, 4. It will 'be noticed that there is an item mcution- -ed in the notes on revenue called ' ilanama Baladia tobacco tax of 2 % upon imports. • I have discussed this tax with the Adviser, who agrees with that it is contrary to the Treaties which prescribe a 5 ^ duty. It is also objectionable in that it gives the B&amp;ladia the idea that they have a position in the Customs which they are not entitled to and enables them to tax the rest of the Islands indirectly. I can find no trace of this tax ever having been sanctioned by the Agency, and so I suggest that it be cut out of next years budget. The State will not suffer as the Adviser intends to pass the loss on to the Baladia ( who already have more money than they can spend and have deposits of over a lakh.) and possibly to reduce one or two other of their smaller taxes. 5. liegarding the allowances of the Ruling family I nave much to say, and am submitting a separate letter on the subject. As Mr. Belgrave says, at the present rate of progress they will soon absorb the entire revenues of the State. 6. The amount shown for education is now 9©,000 rupees, a sum consideretbly greater than that usually spent by States with similar incomes in India. I hope that it will bo found by reorganisation in the Shiaii ^aqfs, { which arc now under popular control ,) to arrange for more primary education being undertaken by them from funds hit lerto misappropriated by the clerics who previously handledhandled tiienic I think the Bahrain Governiaent have made a great mistalce in sending 8 boys at a cost of Rs lS ,000/- so far a field as Beyrout. These boys do not appear to have been selected by examination and their parents are well able to pay for their education themselves, three of the boys being the sons of members of tne ruling family who are already in receipt of allowances of Rs 6,000/- and Rs 5,500/- per mensem from the State, Had this sum been sp^nt on a well qualified head master and a science master, one of the existing inefficient lower middle schools could have been made into a real3.y good secondary school and these boys educated in Bahraino One at least has already managed to acquire a marked American accent and I think the State could have achieved good results with far less expenditure by sending them to (X Baghdad. Nor is Beyrout, which concentrates in small A area the most unpleasant attributes of the Levaiit, the place 'tos which one would choose to send a child at the A most impressionable period of his life. 7. Mro Belgrave deserves great credit for the transfer of the Shiah tfaqfs from the Q,adhi&amp; to a popular committee. They have already made great strides, and have discovered by personal tours that there are many Waqfa in outlying villages whose existence was unknown. Members of the committee are usually housed free in villages they visit, * and the new arrangement has proved so satisfactory that there is little doubt that the Sunnis will soon bestir themselves and take over their Waqfs from the three ^adhis. When this is done it should be possible to open many primary schools all over the island at no extra cost to the State, 8. The amount spent under the head f Medical 1 is, I consider, iar too small, I am told by those who chouldL^ I*, in a position to know that the obst/etrical barbarities described'uartoaritioe deacrited by Mies Katheriue iiayo in rer well known work are exceeded oy those to be cot with everywhere in Bahrain. The apathy of the State, particularly in matters of gynaecology and child welfare playu into the -hands of the American Mission and there seems no reason why the State ohould depend indefinitely on the cac.ntv oi tlu citizens of the Mid West. I should be glad to learn the views of the Hon'ble the Political Resident upon thig i point. q # The State has done good work ac regards puu3-ic buildings U^rs yvdi, and will take another step forward this year in the installation of felsctric light ana the construction of the Itenait^Muharraq Sea road.

G, Prior, I .A., *7^ JO 'J' ^ To Political A^ent, Bahraiti, Tlie Secretary to the Hoii f bl€ the Political Resident in th« Persiaii Gulf, Buahire• Sir, I have the honour to draw the attention of the Hon'ble the Political Resident to the ceriouy situation in Bahrain caused toy the ever increasing civil list, and A -t- U the dangerous results that will onsue unless early an vigorous action is taken in the mutter. 2. In his report on the Budget, Mr. Belgravc shows that the civil list during the past four years has risen as follows Ks 4,44,000 H 4,34,000 ' 4,62,000 M 5,15,000 It will 'be seen that in the last year the civil list lias grown by some 12 % and inspite lir. Belgrave^a persistent efforts an addition of over half a lakh has Leen made to an already inflated civil list. The matter has come to a head now, because Mr, Belgrave is again being pressed to increase it and he has told me that his powers are exhausted and that failing definite action v. . be obliged Dv the political authorities he will awsffc to relajc his efforts 1344 1345 1346 1347/ Is L W- efforts whicli acieve nothing and only Diake hib pobition A extremely difficult, 3. S© far tht; 'brunt of keeping the civil list at a reasonable figure has been borne by Mr. Belgrave^ Ee has consistently w&amp;rnad the political authorities of the situation and while doing his best to check increases has poiiited out that he can not do so without strong support * I have on my file a demi-official No, 5«ci7/S of 6th December 1926 in which Captain Horner forwarded to my predecessor a list showing the allowances of the Muscat ruling family and saying that 1 this may help Belgrave in determining questions of allowances to the al Khalifa family.• It is well known that Mr, Belgrave's chief trouble lies in restricting the Shaikh's generosity to himself and his sons, and I submit that it is not for Mr. Belgrave, the Shaikh's paid servant, to determine what his master may or may not take from the State funds, ana in suggesting that he should do so we have shirked our responsibility and have attempted to saddle Mr. Belgrave with an unpleasant duty which shoula bt borne by broader shoulders which may well make his position untenable. 4. V/e can not aivest ourselves of this re^ponsi- ' -bility, for Shaikh Hamad left to himself would rapidly «ii,t up the entire revenues and the work of the past six years would be undone at once. The Bahraiii allowances generous in the first place and only fixed as a temporary measure at 4,44,000 have now risen to 5,15,000, and, if other payments to the ruling family be considered, nearly, 5,50,000. These other amounts are an elusive total and inc-iude His iixcellency*percentage on sheep and goats la.nded at Bahrain, free education at Beirut for three sc^is oi thft ruling family at a cost of nearly 5,000, additional sums for entertainment of visiting . Shaikhs/t Sia&amp;ikhfc and other, items which ne«d a trained dwtectivc; to diacover. This 5^- lakiis is roughly three times that paid oy the Muscat State to its ruling furiily and is more than half the bud^cttcd income for thw year, and the time has come tc tctke action. 5. His Excellency has just approached Mr, Ijel^rave for an increase of his allowances. Last year hie total income was 2,25,000 of which the amount from the State was 1,81,000, oi.',000 from his market property and the rest from garden rents. He should have received another 16,000 but a tenant went bankrupt. His expenditure during the year was 2,58,000 of which 25,000 was distributed as prtsEcnts, Mr, Bel^rave pointed out to His Excellency that his income from Banrain was roughly the same as that of the Viceroy's, but His Excellency who saw in- -congruity in th^ir relative positions immediately said that the Viceroy almost certainly had land in England, I quote this to show how little he realises what a drain he is on the State, and how little he does in return for his pay. He might perhaps be told that excepting his sons ana daughters, only six of King George's relations are supported by the State, 6, As regards the rest of the al Khalifa the situation is infinitely worse, I find that thia horde of idle mouths reccivo 28,07iyper mensem from the State, This does not include the sums paid to certain of them to act as magistrates, for the al Khalifa consider that they should be handsomely compensated to give up the sloth that is their birthright, ana will do nothing for the State unless suitably remunerated. In his letter C 21 dated the 2lBt oi January 1927 my predecessor informed you that all tii' memoers of the al Khalifa considered t] ems elves entitled by virtue or their birth to a share in the loot of Bahrain., I v/iati to point out, however, that I am xiot disputing with them the meat ol' the ox, but merely the hones and the hooro for they are already the owners of practically all the agricultural Icjids* in the islands which they have looted from the Bahrainas and from which they wrin^ the last penny, and in addition to this they own very valuable bazaar property and markets« In view of this, ii we allow them to cat up in addition 50 % of the gross revenue, we are in my opinion failing in our duty. Mr, Bclgrave inforii-B me that out of the civil list ot 108 persons, many do not live in Banrain and are personally unknown to him, and merely come here to receive their doles and retire. The principal recipients are of course Shaikh Hamad, IS.,500/- and Shaikh Abdullah, 6,000/- ana Shaikh Muhammad, 2,500/- per mensem and Shaikh Salman who draws 1,400/^ per mensem. I therefore make three suggestions. 7. An all round reduction of ten per cent except for Shaikh Isa and Shaikh liamad, whose allowance of 1^,500/- is somewhat small in comparison to the pthers. 3 # To reduce certain salaries* This would be difficult^as the first to be reduced would undoubtedly be Shaikh Abdullah^s as his 6,000/- is out of all pro- —portion to the others. Sliaikh abuullah is undoubtedly the ablest man in the State,^ ar^ action which might un- -settlc him now that he appears to have turned over a new leaf would not in ny opinion bt worth the trouble involved. 9 # To leave the salaries as they are and to cut out the summer move allowances of 6,000/- to Shaikh, Hamad, 2,000/- to Shaikh Muhammad and 15,00#/- to Shaikh Shaikh Hamad's pay might then be brought upto 15,000/-. 10* The main thing however is to get the Shaikh to/I 5 / to respect the undertaking he has several tim«s v feiven and as frequently disregarded viz, tiiat he shouldn not m.^ke increase without taking the advice of tl^e A Political Agento Kc should also agree that in the event of the death of an al khalifa^his sons should only receive a quarter or half his allowances, and that for the present that no further increases should be given without a a reduction elsewhere to pay for it, and also, preferably by proclamation, announce that the State will not be bound indefinitely to pay allowances to meiabere of the al Khalifa who do not work for it. At present the al Khalifa are breeding like rabbits and the unfortunate State has to support a rapidly increasing brood of utterly idle and worthless Shaikhlings• 11. I would have taken action before but I feel it is better that I should first refer the matter to the Political Resident as, so far as I am aware, tue Residency have given no clear and authoritative orders on the subject, and it is obvious that I should have the full support of the Resident if any action of mine is to je successful^ I consider the situation is serious. Last ysar the revenue showed a slight shrinkage, and this year hae opened badly, and it also appears certain that the pedaling season will not live up to the hopes raised by the Khanchia; against this we have an extra half lakk of unproductive expenditure to meet. 12. I should be glad if orders could be conveyed b me before my departure to Karachi as it will be more productive of result though less pleasant for me to dis- -cuss the matter with the Shaikh before I go # I have the honour to be.

At the same time the fltate ie in a prooperoue condition with income far exceeding expenditure and leav ing a handsome surplus each year for investment. From ny experience of other Arab States of similar type^ranging from JjaJ^eJ to nuwait^it in clear that the members of the ruling family regard themselves as equally entitled with the actual ruler, to share the booty originally earned by the exertions of their common pro genitor. It is quarrels over t}ie sharing of this booty, as they regard the State revenues, that lead to the regrettable series of fratricides which have always marked the history of these snail States. It is a natter of sincere congratulation that Bahrain, under British guidance, appears to have passed this state of development, and that its rulers are realising that they owe a duty to their subjects as well as to the roembers of their family. At the sane time the idea that the revenues of the/ • the f^tate are the proi)erty of the family docs not appear wholly to have vaniahed^ and \se have to realiBe thie mentality. It is for ub to guide the Kulcr by advice and not to order him. we do not want to appear in .he lime light. Luckily rhaikh Hamad^ though wcak / ie auoceptible to the advice of the Political Agent viiich, he knows, iiae the aupport of the Political Heuicent. 1 authorioe you to explain the pooition to which hit heedleuo generosity must ultimately lead; to remind him of his promises to l. f aJor Daly regarding additions to uie allow ance; and to say that 1 have noticed the increase in the civil list with serious misgivings. His allowances and those of his family are already fixed on a very generous scale, and he and the Al Khalifa, who in addition draw considerable revenue from private gardens and town property, mimt contrive to live on their present income. A ruler has duties to his subject8 t as X an sure that Kin Fxcellency who has visited London ^must realise. His Majesty King Heorge is particularly careful to live within hio income and none of his family draw any incomes except a fixed yearly sun granted to them by Parliament. This Rum ill not susceptible of increase except with the concent of 'arliament and such consent has never been asked for by His Majesty the King. In the same way the Al Khalifa must act. I tsust that Shaikh Hamad will now make a start by reducing instead of increasing expenditure. In the first place he should withdraw the annual grant made to him self and various members of his family for the summer move, which should be paid for out of he mofltfeA/ allowance he and his brothers receive. At the same time 1 must ask His r.xcellency to make no fresh allowances to the Al Khalifa, unless he can make some corresponding reduction in the total grant to t&lt;he familyfl - 3 - family eitlner ovring Jx) a death or curtailraent of the allow ance of another raeraber. You should tell the Shaikh that it ie not my wish to interfere in the affaire of the r &gt;tate # but when X aee a dear friend heading for ruin, ttXKf. it ic my duty to warn him and to take meauuree to avert the cataetrophe, and 1 fee^- sure that he will accept thie advice. d- &amp; ... ,, ^ Lieut.-Colonel, Political Heaident in the Persian Oulf. i (. i/i- * % p- - TW )3o The expenditure on the Clirll List has again in creased^ largely on acounmt of an additional grant to the old Shaikh Sir laa, and to the restoration of the allowances to certain A1 Khalifa hitherto in exile* It ie certainly time that Shaikh Hamad realised that he cannot continue increasing the allowances to his family indefinitely. Mr Belgrave is impressing upon ^lm that I the tine has now come #ien no grant should be made to a member of the Al Khalifa without a corresponding savr ing being shown either owing to the death or curtail ment of the allowance of another member of the family. At the same time it is satisfactory that the State is in a position to bear this heaY|i drain and still show a surplus. In other less favoured States in the Gulf it is the resentment of relatives at what they regard as an inequitable division of the booty, owing to the Hultr's appropriation of the major share of the revenues, that leads to the regrettable cases of fratricide, which are a feature of Gulf history. 4* It is hoped that the State will noW turn its attention to the medical and sanitary problems vtiich, in spite of the excellent work of and great improve ments wrought by the Municipalities, still remain to be tackled. b.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter lio.33l/S dated the 8th August to the Government of India, and to say ti.at the statement regarding Shaikh Sir 1 Isa tin 'Ali is not entirely accurate. He has been drawing his allow ance at the rate of Rs 4000/- per mensem since the 1st of Ramadhan 13^4 (lotM March 1926) and at the enhanced rate of Rs 5000/- since 1st Muharram 1347, equivalent to 19th June 1928. As the last financial year for the Bahrain Government started on or about the 23rd of May 1928 it wi3| be seen that he drew this allowance at the enhanced rate for practically the whole of the year 1347, and that 1 ittl of the increase over last years budget can be attributed to him.

Sir, I have the honour to forward a petition addressed to you 'by certain members of the A1 Khalifah family. You will recall that His Sjccellency Shaikh Hamad mentioned this at his conversation with you before your departure, and the letter had not then been received. Upon receipt, I forwarded it to Mr.Belgrave as I knew little about the applicants. I enclose, herewith, a copy of his reply, with which I agree, and also a copy of a genealogical tree showing their relationship to Shaikh Sir Isa bin Ali. It will be seen that the petitioners are second cousins of Shaikh Isa and related to him in the Sixth degree. I suggest that I may be instructed to reply that there seems no reason^ why any male member of the Al Khalifah should receive allowances from the State if he does noi work for it, but that the question is one for Shaikh Hamad to settle and that they should apply to him if they feel they have a claim. You will notice from the petition that Shaikh i .amad is stated to have said that h^ considered them just as his sons but that he was forced by Major Daly to cut their ^ „ allowances, and it is a A fact■-2- fact that His Excellency places the onus of every unpleasant step, he is obliged to take, either on the Political Agent or the adviser or hoth.

This par anagraph reads rather as though Col. Barrett had been an enthusiastic supporter or TtKx rtrench- A ment in this direction. As a matter of fact, as Russell ■A will tell you, he disbelived my forecast of a bad year, and it was only after two months pressure that he agreed to lorce r reduction on t.e Shaikh, in this connection please { y/ sec my CA 0 datec* the 20th -July 1920 } in fact v'h^n he came here on the 14th of Kay he was actually contemplating giving the She ikh an increase ths t he was clamouring for. 3. Then again in para 3 if his despatch Ho. 33I-S n dateo the r -th August 1929 to the Government of India, he • stated that the increases in the 'ivil List were principally due to can increase in Shaikh Isa^ grant. This,as I point- ( ' ^ 0U ^ ; ^ n dated the I9th September 1929, was not the case. Xor could either Belgrave or I understand who the al Khalifa in exile^referred to were. t 4. ?;Iy forecast of a bad year has been fully borne t out. I had anicipated i possible drop of half a l^kh, but the s^ump in the earl market h s made matters worse; ar^e- ^ we shall be a lakh dov/n on last year for certain, anc next year Telgrave will be obliged to budget for an amount ^not more then this years receipts. An increase in taxation would cause great discontent as dozens of merchants are n going bankrupt every month. y subsequent remarks regard-lij'k' e 2 • ing Shaikh Hamad should be read in the light of this para graph. 5. For the last two months. Shaikh Hamad nas been bothering Belgrave about his money affairs, and raaicin b attempt after attempt to extract more money from him. .fter an interview/ in which Shaikh Hamad became somev/hat heated, Belgrave informed me that the Shaikh was 6000/- overc.r.-wn • -n(: that lie v.'ould be glad if I would take up the matter. I went out to Sakhir, and found him in a very tx tiresome mooc. e trotted out all his stock arguments 1 ■hen he went to India, the customs paid him 56,000/- sim- P - ^ 1upr's chit, without any questions asked, and why could he get nothing like that now ' •• in Ivlajor Daly^ time he was allowed to pocket all cou% fees, f nd they ^lio Id on p ic to nim now ' and so on. I very much doubt the truth of the last contention and have written to Daly to see WUl the' practice really was arid what his pay at that time was. 6. e told me of the great demands on his purse, and I told him that he was so generous that^if his pay was co olr?c he ould still be hard up. I ^ Iso brought to his notice some of the more glaring instances where he w: sted mon-y recently, quoting the gift of his fish market to Daij, a property which I believe brings in about 3oo/- a month. n argument that he never tired of was that you had s r id he should have more money and 1 why did not tne dviser produce it. ' I had. been warned that he would s- y this nnd consequently had brought along a copy of the letter in which I told him that you had indded said xh tL t you considered he should have a high^e pc^portion of of the Civil List, but that the 5 lakhs could not in any circumstances be exceeded. 7. I then suggested that he should take tlr amounts which have been cut from certain persons, but on hearing3 . ti at it only amounted to a few hundred, rupt es a month he toox no notice of the suggestion. I then produced as a final suggestion, the proposal that he should lease a plot of land or a promontory that he has in Muharraq to Government for the Quarantine, at a rate of 400/- 0 &gt;J ^ ~ r ; '' :1 this case a year in advance as he was so hard up. This idea he approved of, but the difficulty lies in- = ^ i Co that it is inhabited by some of Shaikh Isa's ser vants, and that although the State will give them lodging or ground elsewhere, he fears his father's displeasure. owever he finally agreed to accept the sum and any cutlngs that might become available. mortunately we now discover that the Ci^ii is' ill oe 5,^07,000 this year in spite of the deductions, r some of v .hich will not really take effect till next year, a and so there will be nothing available from cuttings at the !!l0ment&gt; - -e jhaiJch h; a, however accepted the 4300/- and I have written to him urging him try and keep his expendi- L ^ v.ithin limits, pointing out that it will be a very bad for t,p Uate, and that nexjr year it might be necessary to reduce the al XhaUfa allowances even further if matters r'ld not improve. I also said that 3300/- per annum would, be available from cuttings, and that he could take this and still kepp below the five lakhs, and add to it any further sums th.t be available by th deaths or otherwise of mem- bers of the family. Of course, the whole trouble is that so long a 8 Sliaikh lea remains with us, m si ^n be never able to give him a really solid increaase and I feel that we should cling to „his five lakh limit as to the horns of tar. Once we exceed it, even by a little, we shall be faced by even more insistent demands for more money than at present. The quarantine site is not worth 400/- a month, but it seemed impossible to find any other source of income without ad''- ing it to the Civil hist, am' the sitePage 4. is thp most suit-^tTe for our purpose as it has deep water up to the edge of it. 9.

Sir, I hare the honour to report that I recently visited lahrain and found the economic situation there very I'ad. 2 # These islands are almost entirely dependent on l.he pearl trade and the catch this year has been below the average while the market is lifeless. Great hopes were placed on the visit of Ur. Victor Rosenthal ; the iarisian pearl mer chant, but he only bou^ ht about 4 or 5 lakhs worth of pearls. 3, I met him recently in Buehire and he told me that the Hew York buyers who were usually in Paris by this time had not yet arrived and were holding back and therefore he restricted his purchase in Bahrain, but mi^ht possibly buy on a more extensive scale in omoay, it was difficult to ascertain the value of the pearls which had been soldi the political A^ent estima ed it at about £ ^00,000/-, but one or two merchants with whom I discussed tihe matter put it at considerarly less and estimated the sales^about 30 lakhs. 4, It is the custom at this time of the year at Bahrain for divers to receive advances, locally known as ' tiskam' ....•SI. w ti»kam' to keep them going through the winter* The amount is usually fixed at about Ra.lOO/- for a diver and AB.tiO/- for a hauler. This year however the merchants say that they have no money, and cannot possibly give the customary advances. Some of the divers can, of course, earn their living by fish ing, carrying passengers between v ^anamah and J uharrmq, trans porting stone, etc*, but the State is confronted with the prospect of having a large proportion of the population unable to obtain employment and deprived of their customary means of support* 6. ior some time past a project has been under con- sideraticn to cormeot the island of .anawah with the island of .luharraq by a causeway, and a beginning was made last year, but it was the intention to proceed with it slowly as funds beoaiue available. In view however of the distress at present prevailing the State propose this winter to push on with ths project as an unemployment relief work. Further, eleettic light has been installed in .lanamah and it is proposed to extend it to Muharraq and tlxis will employ a certain amount of unskilled labour. This latter work will ultimately ue productive and to meet the expenditure involved the Utate will be compelled to utilise some of their reserve. As this latter project should m course of time pay a satisfactory dividend, 1 see no objection to this. There is no doubt however that until the pearl market revives, the State will have to exercise the strictest economy in its administration if it is to avoid a serious financial crisis* 6.

Financial Adviser to tha Government, Bahrain. End-Revenue. For the last four years owing to steadily increasing revenue it has been possible each year to estin te en in crease in receipts. In my last annual report I wrote that it was generally thought that the trade prospects for the coning year ware not promising. Owing to trouble on the mainland and the Persian question it wes thought that trade would be adversely affected. Unfortunately this predic tion was true and in addition to these reasons en abnor mally bed year on the nearl market has resulted in general trade depression which is reflected in a serious falling off in revenue. In my opinion and in the opinion of the mercantile community in Bahrain the prospects for the new year are even worse then those of the past yeer. Onlesa there is a comnlete change in the condition of the pearl ^sirket the financial position in the new year will be very serious. For these reasons instead of budgeting for an increased revenue I have reduced the estimated customs cclie ctione to Es 8 ,30 ,000/- which is one Isc less than the estimated collection for 1348 and kh,00less than the actual amount collected during that year. It is hoped thet the revenue will exceod this amount but 1 feel that it would be dangerous to expect any more. The Customs collections are the main revenue of the State, its other ao'irces of income are almost negligible. Wisnnllsneous. Es 20,000/-. This heading includes various Toss and duties colleotod by tlio oustons sue es tobacco tax, harbour dues, etc, and also passport fees, the last two items did not exist before this year.I l-V -S- Judioiel . eoeints. Bs 20,000/-. This includes oil fees collected the Land Department on registretion and sales of property. These registrations ere to be made com pulsory in the new year and some changes are also being made in the collection of court fees which should result in an increased revenue from both these sources. Rents from Govornment Land. This includes Rs 10,000/- which is paid by the Eastern General indicate as rent on the oil concession, also £ 120/- per annum being rent of aerodrome and leases of Government ground ¥ihich was formerly occupied freely by squatters. The last item is a steady and increasing revenue which has only conmen- ced this year. iiilectricitv . The receipts from electrical supply are somewhat problematical and depend partly on the weather, but according to the present load the costs of the staff snd of running the engines should be covered by the pay ments made by the consumers, which include the payments made by Government departments and by the Municipality for street lighting. Loans recoverable. This large sum consists of money lent to members of the Ruling Family and others for the period of the Diving season. The amount would have been consi derably larger but owing to shortness of funds H. S. Shaikh agreed definitely to refuse all further applications for loans. The money is lent without interest and in soae cases with no security except a personal guarantee. In previous budgets the money which is on deposit and current account in Bombay has been shown in the annual budget and has been allocated on the expenditure side to soae particular objects. In the 1349 budget this has not been done. As there is every prospect of en extremely3- extremely bed yeer it is not proposed that any of this « amount shall be expended so the present budget shows nothing except the ectuol revenue end loans recoverable. The amount on deposit in Bombay is shown on the balance sheet of the State. Recurrent exDenditure^ Allowences to Ruling feaily. The Civil list and ellowance have now been definitely limited to not more then five lees. Aotuelly the present payments amount to about two thousand rupees under the five lees. Tutor. The tutor to the Shaikh's sons is shown separately ss his services do not fall under the general heading of ublic Education. His cost is considerebly fry increased provision he« to be made for passages, leave and pension contributions according to Government of India rules which ere more generous than those applied to other officials employed by the Goverrjaent of Bahrain. Protection. Although the number of the Indian Police has been considerably reduced, there were originally 110 and there are now 83, their cost is only slightly less then it wes last yeer. This is because a large proportion of them are now due for leave and allowancesT have to/made for the cost of their pessages. It is not possible to reduce the number of naturs in Manamah and Muharr k but it is expected that some reduction can be made among the naturs in the outside villages. Customfi. This depertiaent shows en^increase of Hs over lest yeer. This accounted for partly by the regular increments to the staff, the Provident fund, end an additional number of house allowances which are paid to clerks enlisted from abroad who are permitted to have their families in Bahrain. The firit two reasonsrefisona slir^htly increase the cost of ell the Govern: ent departments, each year, but aftainrt this may be urged the Advantage of increased experience and loyalty, secretariat. This department shows en increase of ^ /2&gt; i6 mT tiy accounted for by the provi sion of leave fares for the Adviser who becomes entitled to leave, with passages during the sunnier of 1349. I,-' a.J Depfcrtroent. surveyors are now working in this department as well as the ordinary office staff. The work is steadily increasing and will increase still more when registrations ere made compulsory. It is m? possible that in the coming year the collection of fees will cover the expenses of the department# . u;icir' end %kf8. This amount was over estimated in trie last budget owing to some uncertainty as to the cost of the newly established shia Wakf department. ass port department. This depsrtiaent was started at the end of 1348 end is now under the control of the Police, not, as formerly, e part of the customs. The receipts will easily covor the cost of the Deport- ment, staff and printing. ^ub l ic .vincation. The 3tate provides free education. It has been suggested that fees should be charged but undoubtedly the greater proportion of the parents are too poor to pay and to descriminate between their fin ancial condition would be almost impossible. The amount this year has been reduced from its 90,000/» to Hs 60,GOO/-. Various economies are to be effected by a change in the rates of the masters T pay and no new schools will be opened during the year. A detailed report on Education is enclosed. Mnniciralities. The montl ly subsidy to Manamah Muni cipality has been reduced from Es 2000/- per month to1 r 0^ •5- to ki 1000/- ]^©r aonth as the Marjaman Uunioipality has becon» a comparatively wealthy institution. The sub sidy to Muharrak Muuioipeiity remains at ^ 2000/- per month. In addition to theee suss they receive between KcUj them the tobacco tax and iwre the motor tax which amounts roughly to about ^ 4000/- per annum to each municipality. Electric Supply. This includes entire cost of running including selery of Engineer who is to be lent to the State for one year by Messrs. Callender's Cable and Construction Co^. Ltd. f Bombay. Public ,r /orks # The provision for repairs to roads and Government buildings, which includes the Customs, has been reduced to the least possible amount. Compensation. This covers payment orders, which are frequently made by orders of H. £• Shaikh Hamad to des erving persons whose cases are heard by Lim and to victims of fires, wrecks and also to persons whose pro perty has been wrongfully sold under the late rejime. pecial projects.- Kuharrak Road. The Government promised to assist the Muharrak Biledya with a special grant of Hs 40,000/- to pay for the sea road which was built along the Muharrak foreshore. Of this amount Rs 20,000/- was paid during 1348, the remaining fts 20,000/ is to be paid in two instalments, half during 1348 and half during 1350. Crane. a crane has been required by the Customs for scrae time. The import of motor cars and of heavy cargo is increasing and the lack of a crane causes much inconvenience and delay. A f&lt; e will be charged for its use and the cost of purchasing it should be re covered in course of time. Manamah-Muharrak Road. Owing to lack of funds, it has been impossible to allocate a larger amount to' —6— to this inportent umierteking. Should the revenue exoood the estimated amount en adJitionel sum will be pet esidc towards building the roed# Agriculture* It is proposed that some experiments i in agriculture should be made on a fairly arge scale by the sinking of several artesian wells in a suitable area. The State nov. ov-ns a well boring machine and the nmonnt shovn under this heading is to coyer the cost of boring end preparing the ground. ********Tkj B r«T. M e for 1348 shows 8 rery serious falling off. The decrense/moiaiy in the Custom collections, the ch5f revenue of the State. The reason is apparently general trade depression, eb - ormai y J '-- ■ 641,1 ce -son, which shows no sign of recovery, and, to a lesser extent, the disturbances on the Finland caused by the recent rebellion. There has been a noticeable decrease in the actual wholesale ccet of ffost imports, except rice. Shortage of money occasioned ^ the bad pearl season, has reduced the local purchase of most fonas of luxuries. The following is a comparison of the revenue for the last five yoars.

This year it has fallen back to almost as low as it was in 1344, an admittedly bad year. although the revenue was estimated in the 1348 Budget on a very conservative basis the actual receipts fell short of the budgeted amount by Rs. 32,000/-, Beremje colIeoi,aJ by the Customs Department includes boat, pearling ^nd notor licenses and also^up till now, passport license These items have not decreased seriously.The reduction in the wholesale cost of coffee and sugsr hati runulted in a decrease of Fs. 15000/- and Rs.

Previoua state of Education# The Government schools, wi.ich previously consistod of one school in Muharrak ^nd one school in Vfinimeh % were founded about ten years ago by Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa al Xliolifah, after his return from hio first visit to England. Both schools were Sunni, Until this year they were nominally under Shaikh Sbdullah's direction, assisted by a Council of education consisting of merchants chosen for their wealth rather than their learnimr. In practice they were managed by Haji Yusuf Fakhroo, the ireasurer, mk ! ^aid Othraen liurani, the Syrian headmaster of the Muharrak school. sum which finally reached lis 1370/-, was paid monthly by the Government to the Treasurer, and no questions were asked as to education or accounts. Interference by the Government in school matters was considered impolitic. Originally about three lacs of rupees were collected from the public to start the schools. Tne building of the 'uherrak school was supposed to cost two lacs, an incredibly large amount. Much publicity was given some years ago in the Egyptian press to the gross mismanagement of rub- lie money by the Treasurer but nothing was definitely proved. Most of the teachers v/erc appointed by the Miiherrek headmaster, who introduced a number of his own relations; another member of the Council, the son 01 the notorious Chaikh Abdul ^ahab Ziayani-, supplied a large proportion of the teachers from his own relations. Nepotism flour ished to an extra ordinary de.cqree and salaries depended not on the ability of the teachers but on their friendship with the headmaster and one or two members of the council.-2- It is hardly smrDrising that the standard of education wes low and boys who had attended school for several years were incauable of doin^ the most simple work in any of the Government offices. At various time incidents occurred which were comisented upon in the foreign press which has always taken e some what impertinent interest in Dahrain educationel affairs, probably owing to the nunber of foreigners who have held posts in the schools. An exararle of one of these 'Incidents' was the dismissal and repatriation of Shaikh Hnfiz ahba, who was a Faster in Mrharrek, about twelve years ago. This gentleman, who r/es thought at that tiiae to be orgrtnising anti-iinglish propagunda in Bahrain, now holds the important post of representative of King Ibn Saoud in Lngland, ^ointment of Inspector of ^ducetion. Toward! the middle of the year, after the dismissal of the headmaster o; the -/anamnh school by the Council under some he t irregular circumstances, ohaik &gt;.bdullah bin Isa asked that the admin istretion of the schools and the accounts should be under the direct supervision of the Government who should also appoint a suitable Insnector Kducation to supervise the t•aching• Mr. Faik ^dham, a Syrian, was well reconunenaed by the President of the Beyrout University and appointed to the post. lie holds a B.A. degree from the TTniversity and a degree from the Islamieh College of Beyrout. He brought with hi® his vife, a qualified teacher, who was appointed as headmistress of the new kanamah girls 1 school. School masters strike . The appointment of an InsDector wns bitterly resented by Othaan uurani and many of the masters as well as one or two of the Council. ] reviously they had mishandled educational affairs and accounts.withwith impunity. 'lien certain irregularities in the eocounts were discovered the Treasurer of tie Council resigned, A regular system of accounts and paynjents was instituted# All these changes were very unwelcome to the headsissters of the schools. On find Remadhan, 1348 without any warning, the head- masters of Manwaah and lluharrek declared a strike of masters and boys. The students were harangued by the two head masters, the schools were closed and for several days the boys paraded about the to^ns making wiolent speeches in the bazaars which they admitted afterwards they had been taught by their nasters. ihe ia^tcrs took a solemn oath that they would stand lorefier en! several members of the Council were undoubtedly in favour of the strike and secretly encouraged it. ;ttemrts were aade to per suade the other schools to join the strike, but vithout success. Shaikh Abdullah immediately sent for the tv.o headmas ters to call on bia at the Government offices. They refused to come. Lf ^ter they sent a long letter raking s number of impossible demends which incluaed ro^ueets that their retention should be guaranteed and that they should be appointed members of the council. They were promptly informed in an official letter tiiat unti- tney returned to their duties none of their demands could be considered. They refused to go back to vork unless every thing that they asked for was granted. They v .-ere both dismissed, their selories were p ®id f and they were sent back to their homos in the Lebanon | via I.-us cat, Karachi and Busrah as there happened at the time to be a boat in the port on its way down the Oulf. a proclamation was issued closing the two schools ior ten days. The dismissal of the two masters causedcoused a rrreat deal of oxciteiTient. lublic petitions were orgmised, denutstions called the Shaikh end schoolboys broke into the taberrdk school and destroyed a quantity of furniture and fittingr.. The Kozeibis and others sug- j^est^d ) as a threat that they would open e new school in opposition to the Government schools. 4 In ten days the schools voro re-opened^at first the attendance vas s mil but within a aonth it reached the aorratl number. Throu ^out the affair moat of the parents of tiie boys protested that they did not approve of their sons 1 behaviour but they v ere MO ^erles i to stop it or to send thei*! back to school. It is an actual fact that v- here in ahrein, v .ith a few exceptions, from the family of the Puling Feaily downwards, quite s^all boys are absolutely independent of their fathers' wishes. NewsDQt er attcckc- . The departure of the two masters was ?ronntly followed by e series of abusive and anti- English articles in Iraki, Persian and Syrian newspapers, rheir vitupf^ration was mostly directed arainst the poli tic L agent in Bahrain end the British policy in Bahrain. The ee* reason for the rasters dispissal was given as being their refusal to make . n ^lish the teaching laaf ^uage of the schools, jealousy of the nglish at the snccess of the irab schools and the wish of the In -'lish to forbid the teaching of religion. These, and other causes, all of them equally untrue, were circulated by the masters who remained in Bahrain. Sheikh i-bdulle ae : resident of Kd^cetion, published a brief notice in 'Al-Iraq' and contra dicting the newspaper etat rente and stating the reason for the masters dismissal. 3am articles were also pub- # lished giving a trie account of the circumstances in respectable newsaaaers..^rcmosed P.efor^ The chiof fault in edtioetion uptill now h&amp;s been «n etteprnt to teach too wsny end too advcnced subjects, which even if they are understood will be of no use to boys who will mostly become 'livers, boat owners or petty shopkeepers. The present ctirrioulum includes: A1 ^ebra , 'geometry, Chemistry, hysics, -'usic and English in five out of eight classes. iot only are these subjects useless but in most cases the teaching of them is badly dene. ohaikb - bdu lah, who, althoti^h he has only the elements of education himse f, is a raan of unusual intelligence, in consultation with the Inspector of education and myself has decided to make radical changes at the beginning of the next school year. The services of raost of the present foreign masters will bo dispensed with. By 'forei^ is meant persons from outside the Gulf. They will be replaced by four o? the young Bahrain iarn ho ure bein^ educated at 'Overnnent expense at Beyrout TT niversity« Two new headmasters will be imported for ?^8nanah end uharrak, if possible one of tnese will be an n Aalim n of some reputation but holding modern views. The na es of two well known religious and educational persona^es in Syria have been mentioned. The rest of the masters will be local mipil teachers from the schools t /xemselves. Lfforts are being made to obtain a man to teach practical caroentry and another to teach agriculture. ^nglish will only be taught in the two or three top clases, the other subjects will be religion, xrabic grammar, reading and writing, history, ^o^iaphy, arith metic drawing and singing.

The seven boys from Bahrain schools who have been educated for two years, at Govern ment expense, at Seyrout TTniversity have been well reported on. T ree of them, sons of Shaikhs, spent the last sum mer holidays in Bahrain. Their knowledge of .n^lish seemed to have imrrcved considerably. Doubtless the success of this experiment will be a^r.arent when the boys return here at the end of the present terra. Four of the will then enter the schools as masters. The cost of this experiment has been heavy as Although several of the boys ar* sons of wealthy oerents every thing has been paid for them by the Govermicnt.

In Bf hrain, &lt;'.s in many other places, education is resented by the unprc-ressive religious party, esuecially by the 'adis and Mullahs. Their own know ledge is so slight th. r :t they are afraid of losin ; whet prestige the ■ huve if the community becomes more edu- tec. Gn several occasions ^thy 'adis, who re appo inted and paid by the Government have preached against education in the mosques. Otherwise iducation is generally appreciated by the public, especially by tb:?. evrir increasi number of ^rabs who travel abroad. Unfortunately tiae 'aling family, with a few ^-xceptions, do not appreciate the necessity of educating their w o &gt;ons. The very sli ^itest knowledge of reeding and writing was sufficient for them in the past, and they seem to think that it will be sufficient for them in/f? . j&gt;nr -11- in the future. One of their argimenta ag inst the need of education is thot moat of the biggest pesrl merchants ere uneducated and illiterate. This is trie but it is \«ell known that much of their money disappears in the hands of clerks and agents. The same applies to the Khalifah; if they had even sufficient knowledge to be able to keen accounts properly they would bo very much richer than they are now. One of the most romarkable differences in the lest year or tv o, which is not only confined to school boys, ie the iacreaaing pcrjularity of out door games. All the schools here football teem? which constantly play against each other, and there is also at least one regular football club. Two or three years a o people playing football would have been held up to ridicule, now they play every evening outside the towns. a most iEnortent result of the increase in education is ita ten ency to minimise the bitter animosity that exists between the Sunnis and the Shias. Before the present L&gt;iiiiikii came into uower the intense hate of the shias for the Sunnio was concentrated in the Shia feeling ag »inst the Khalifah family. This feeling still exists, but mostly among the older men. That the Shaikh has given schools to the Shias, as veil ss to the bunnis, and that he pays for their education, is genuinely appreciated by them, and the mixing on terms of equality of Sunni and bhi© boys raust eventually diminish the bitter feeling that uaed to exist between them.

'olice invoati^tions revealed that the same men were implicated in a series of nmrdors and dacoitry terminatinp with the attack on Shaikh Lamed and a Jraid on a village two miles from ''anrneh shortly eftenards.

The son of the murdered man refused to accept it, demanding a life for a life, and though he was urged many times to take the money he persis-persistently refused to receive it.

The previous judge- ment was aabigious end though a fine was imposed, there was some doubt as to the mesning of the judgement. The Court examined the whole oase again, found -he aocuaed s ^jilty and ratified the previous judgement ordering peyment of blood i^oney. The relation.- of the victin&gt; refused to take the money, Shaikh Sbrahim Bin Khelid was found guilty of instigatii the at i tented murder of Shaikh t 'oned.

The question of his punishment was re'erred to shaikh liamed. For political and family reasons, and because the attempt had been made egainst his ovn life, Shaikh Hamed grant him a pardon. It is a matter of opinion whether this b -eBeroi; act of clemency was altogether well judged. Throughout the trials the Shaikhs adopted an insolent attitude imdioating that they did not consider the court qualified to deal with them. Their only defence wes obstinal denials of all evidence that implicated them. ihe trials caused a great deal of local interest.

The MaaaM Municipality, notwithstanding an inclination to interfere frequently in matters which in no way concern it, has done a good deal of useful work during the year. Apart ' xroin the ordinary work of town cleaning and upkeep of roads the following iraproTements have been carried out. jjazgar IaproTewi»ntR- Seweral roads in the town and in the bazaar hare been widened end opened up. In order to do this poritions of buildings and shops were demolished; In cases where much of the building is appropriated compensation is paid, otherwise the building is only repaired. During the last three or four the Mawaa bazaar has changed to a remarkable extent, many of th« narrow lanes have given way to brood streets where motor traffic is possible. The owners of the shops appreciate these improve- onts, even though they hove to sacrifice part of their property, cs m every cose the rents have improved where the streets have been widened. In addition to the work of the Municipality a number of handsome well constructed new shops and offices have been built by private individuals especially in the neighbourhood of the j earl Bazcer. he road from the Municipal Offices to the Sea Road was rebuilt end macadamised. For this work an expert was hired fro® asra. So far the result seems to be very satisfactory but the coet of the work was very high, the roed 750'X 21' cost Rs. 7601/ Local stone was used, but the tar was imported and the high cost or oiel in Bahrein rdded greatly to the cost of the work.

This^now fcng been for- n bidden and four Slipways hay© been built which are used for carrying stone up from the sea shore into the town. The boats now unload stone on the shore below the road and it is carried Ml up on donkeys directly to the place where it is required. A pier has been built on the centre of the eastern side of the road on which gutch and other building material can be stored until it is removed into the town. Six fire stations equipped with alarm bells have been made in various parts of the town. Previously when a fire ocurred it was the practice of the Naturs to raise the alarm by firing their rifles, a dangerous and unsatisfactory method. Cawetyy .'all, A disused cemetry behind H. E. Shaikh Hamed's Palace was surrounded by a stone wall. The work was done by contract.

EXectrjc A separate note ©n this subject is attached. The Manama Municipaiity contributed 20^' of the total cost of the installation. Elect^Qfi, The election^took place towards the end of the yeer and for the first time they were organised according to a regulai system. All property owners in the Municipal area are eligible to vote. The different communities, Arabs, Baharana, Persians, Kojdis etc. each elected members, and a certain proportion were appointed by the Government. The system of ballot box and voting cards was instituted. An intense amount of interest was taken in the elections and 99' of the eligible members of the community voted. The new Mujlis is a thoroughly representative-s- representative one and includes most of the leading men of I anama. ^embers who haiM sat on the retiring Mujlis were debarred from being re-elected by the Public but the GoTernment retained the right of re-appointing them. Eventually only two of the old members returned. An indication of the interest taken in the elections was the fact that in some cases large sums of money were spent in endeavours to obtain votes. It was found that in the Hindu Community only three \ persons were entitled to vote, and in the Mohammedan Indian and Jewish Comiuini ties only about ten persons were eligible to vote. A letter was written by the President of the Mujlis to the members of these three communities informing them that owing to the smallness of their numbers their communities would be allowed to nominate a member from each community who would be accepted on the Council subject to the approval of the Government. The .Tews accepted this concession and nominated a representative who was accepted, but both the Indian com munities refused to nominate anybody unless the clause in which the approval of the Government was mentioned was with drawn. The clause was not withdrawn so there are now no Indian members on the Municipal Council. In spite of their own refusal to elect members it is understood that the reason for their non representation is being escribed to political motives on the part of the Covernment. The Muharrak Municipality is a newer and a less wealthy institution than that of Manama and its work, although very useful, is less consp^cious. It will take several years of regular scaMen.^ing before the back part of Muharrek town becomei really clean. :)eal Road. The most noticeable work carried out during the year was the construction of a sea road, similar to the one in Manama, along the foreshore of the town north of the Customs.ii -4— 1^1 M Custom^, The length is 1360 feet and the width is SO feet, the total cost of the road was Rs. 41,300/~.

It relieyes the narrow b' zaar roads from much of the traffic and altoghether it greatly improves the tovn. v.it Bezsar ? and Streets. Meiiy Gi the roofs in the ba aare have been rebuilt and raised and several streets have been widened both in the bazaar and in the town itself. A contractor is employed for street cleaning and the result of his efforts has caused a very great chanrr© in the general cleanliness of the town.

The catch wls a poor one and the market was abnormally bad. the foreign buyers Bade unusually saall purchases and when they returned to India most of the Bahrain merchants had not sold their pearls. The Bahrain merchants followed the buyers down to Bombay, failing to obtain better prices they refused to sell, the prices of pearls fell, the Bahrain merchants,instead of cutting their losses, held IlilOi on, waiting for the market to im?ove. The market became worse and the foreign buyers sailed for Europe leaving the Bahrain merchants with most of the year's catch in their hands. It is a fact that in many cases people who at first refused an offer were eventually unable to find buyers who would pay half of the original amount. When the new season drew near most of the Bahrain mer chants instead of coining back having sold their pearls and bringing the first instalment of the price returned with money which they h dpp received by mortgaging their pearls with Indian qioney lenders in Bombay. Only three or four of the leading Bahrain merchants} sold their goods, these includes Salman bin Mattar, Jabar bin Mussale: end Ali bin Sagar, the second of these was the tajar who finance in the boat which brought/the record pearl. The pearl was even tually sold in Bahrein for £ 15,000/- to Mr. Habib, it changed hands in Paris for £ 35,000/-. The position is most serious for the small and meduim men who have no capital to fall back upon. The wealthy mer chants such as Kanoo and Gosaibis can afford not to sell for a season and by being able to lend money at a time when it is ve difficult to obtain they can acquire an even greateifcontrol inin the diving trade which increases their prestige and power. T^h/state of pearl aarket is said to be the result of the iisturbed condition of India t the recent financial crisis in jaerica, end the increased production of cultured pearls. • It is to be hoped that conditions in India and /onerica will soon iairove, but the .uestion of cultured pearls is not a temp orary matter t The authorities in Bahrein cannot prevent this trade, but they do all that possible to prohibit the inportation or circulation of cultured pearls in Bahrain so that Bahrein may ac jiire and retain the reputation of exporting only real Dearls. The general condition of divers is gradually improving tnd this improvement is due entirely to the diving reforms whose beneficial results are now beginning to appear. Most of the older divers are so heavily in debt that only death will free them, but the youger men who started to dive shortly before or after the diving reforms are no longer heavily in debt. iue; frequently earn enogh to cancel their debts so that they can div with whoever they wish to, and quite a large proportion owe only fouB or five hundred Purees which under the present system they should be able to ey Wt off in three or four yenrs. The merchants dislike the freeing of the divers very mud indeed end I am sure that very shortly determined efforts will be made to revert to the old system. It is when the effects of the refonss become apparent that the critical time oz ill occur. A very harmful practice has crept in lately by which Nakhudas evade the regulations. The merchants make edvances of money and to their divers charging heavy interest on a side account which is not checked by the diving clerks en. is not entered in the divers books. The courts do not regard tfc debts as binding the divers to dive but the men themslrts are ignorant and many of them beleive that these side debts are a^ binding as the regular advances. The time for the Sallaf, which is the advance before season ocurred c t the end of t e year. After the usuallAf consultation with the heads of the diving community the amount was settled tit Ps. 80/- for a diver end Rs. 60/- for a puller, in each case Rs. 20/- less than last year. a proclamation was issued but the divers refused to go out on this amount. The persons who had first asked for this amount to be laid do^n requested from the Government that an increase should be made. There was a certain amount of trouble and some danger of disorder, though none actually ocurred. Finally it was settled that each diver might take an advance, up to Rs. 20/-, from his tisgam allowance at the end of the season. At this time a number of Nakhodas urged Shaikh iiamad to revert to the old state of things and to allow unlimited and unregul ated advances. The prevention of the unlimited advances and the institution of regular amounts laid down by law were two of the most important features of the ieformS. A significant proof of the value of the Reforms is the fact that ^uite lately the ihiler of (.atar instituted diving laws in his country on the same lines as those in Bahrain. In connection fith the diving question it is interest ing to notice that Lady Simon, in her book 'Slavery' quotes from Dr. Harrison's '^rab at Home' stating that divers never/ get out of debt and that in seven years he never met a diver who had freed himself. Dr. Harrison's book was written about five years ago HI ; his remarks on divers debts, and various other matters, were probably true at that time but they are not the case now. Electrification of ¥anamah. * The Drojeet of introducing electricity into Manamak has been under HOlt consideration for five years or more and for some time funds were set aside in Bombay for the purpose. ^ntil 1928 nothing definite was done 3^ the matter. In that year the Bahrain Government obtained from the Governmen of India the services of Mr. Stevenson, Electrical Inspector in oind, who spent some time in Bahrain and prepared a scheme for the lay out with planis and a rough specification. TheThe question of supply end demand was gone into end it was ascertained that about 2600 laaps and 200 fans would be quired, including street lights and Government buildings. The ^ happened to be a good one, fin^ially' since then two of the local merchants whose requirements/among the larg est have gone bankrupt, and many others are now in a somewhat critical Sirid financial position. A Public meeting was held in Maaaaak and it wa» decided that a company should be formed in which the Ccvernment an:! the ' cnamnh L'unicipality and the general public were each to hove an e^uol share and e^ual control. The local merchants, cs representing the public, declared their willingness to purchcse shares. Later on, for various reasons, the idde of company was found to be unfeasable and the suggestion was cancelled. Copies of the plans and the specifications 'repired by Mr. Stevenson were forwarded by the Government tc the leading electrical firms in India and Irak with a re itiest that if the undertaking interested them they should prepare tenlerB. lost of the firms replied that they could not tender^the whole scheme but could undertake purt of it, tms did not suit the requirement of the state, others appeared *0 consider that Bahrain was too far off the beaten track for them to work in. Jlessers. Callender's Cable Construction Co. ltd,, however were prepared to tender for the whole scheme anj on their own initiative they sent ^epresent- j ative to visit Bahrain. * Tn the summer of 1928 I was in England on leave. 1 had a number of meetings with Mr. Stevenson and with him I called upon several of the firms with whom we had corresponded through their Indian agencies. Finally Callen- der's Cable k Construction Co. Ltd., submitted a complete tender for the whole scheme which was carefully examined and a t ;proved by v r . otevewon upon whose expert knowledge I relied-vi 3 knowing nothing whatever about Elecricity or engineering myself. After some slight modifications were made in the contract I brought it back to Bahrain at the end of the summer. In tre spring of 1929 011eneder f s sent another of thei engineers to examine the place, and during his visit the tendei was definitely accepted by the Government of Banrain, subject to a slight MffiotiM revision in cost of building the Power House depending on the nature of the soil on the site. The tender was for £ 20,607/17/8. It included Power House, plant, consisting of two three cylinder Mirrless-Diesel oil engines of 150 B. H. P. each, auxiliaries, alternators, switch gear, high tension feeders, three sub stations. Kiosks, low and high tension overhead and underground distribution#, etc. etc. In August, 1929 the first instalemnt of the contract was paid, being one tenth of the total. In Sepetember, 1929 Mr. Jordan of Callender f s, arrived as their Resident® Engineer with some of his workmen, others arrived later. The site of the Power iiouse, which had not been definitely settled, was finally fixed. The change of site necessitated a change in the lay out which cost an additi al £ 79/-. Soon after the arrival of the engineer the Electric sche was again discussed in the Municipality Council and it was agreed that they should contribite 20^ of the capital cost of the scheme. The rete^to be at as. 8/- ver unit for lighting and As. 4/- per unit for Power, subject tt reduction sj^uld the profits allow it. The building of the Power House was started soon after the engineer f s arrival. In December, 1929 the entire material and machinery in connection with the scheme had arrived and the second instalm 80^ of the whole, was paid. After estimates had been submitted it was decided that interior wiring and fitting in Government premises should be carried out by the contracting company. The Public. The Public were informed tiiat they were at liberty to obtain and employ any workmen for wiring their houses etc. es long ■s theykeld certificates from some recognised authorities such os Tniian Tinicipelities or Electrical Departments. lentil now no such people have been imported and the Public hade nlaced all their orders in the hands of Cnllender's Cable &amp; Construction Jo. Ltd., The wiring of Government buildings, alece. Customs etc., including an Arc light on a seventy five feet standard to be placed on the pier, amounted to about X Rs. 15,000/-. It had been proposed at first that the Shiakh's Palace, which is only occupied for about four months of the year, should be provided for, by a subsidiary engine. On further consideration it was decided to extend the main supply ' to the 'alace. The eitre distance was about 2000 yards, some surnlus material was utilised lut, the extra poles and cables cost Rs. 10500/-, including the work of erection and un addition al transformer Kiosk inside the Palace itself. Ammgements were made with the A. P. 0. C. for a regular supply mil of fuel to be shipped monthly from Abadan to Bahrain on S. 3. ''Suzistan', but unfortunately we were informed by ti-em that no voyages would be made during July and August. It wos therefore necessary to purchase an extra oil t«nk which was obtained from Karachi.A small tanker was built in Bahrnin consisting ol a Jaliboat with a wooden tank which so far,seems to be a success, 'essrs. Cullender's offered io provide en adequate sti.ff, including an engineer, for twelve months, charging 10^ over their actual pay. The offer of Asiatic staff was refused. A Power House suprintendant and two engine drivers who were personally known to and recommended by the Engineer were pbtained froa ladia direct. t ! &gt; The services of Mr. Jordan were offered for six months or a year @ Rs. 1500/- per month.

In Vebruery ii. &amp;. -ving Ibn Snoud paid a sudden visit to o;ir .in leaviag a iew hours after his arrival. Towards the end of the year Slwikh Mohaaed bin Afcalflfaa, oi ^aulow, came to Bahrain and remained for tibout ttw months, .is purpose was to borrow aoney.

In other words,on the only portions of the State budget. A ^r.3eljrave pointed out to him that no work had been done on tie roads for two months,that he ~ad already e'lected consicerable economies and that the expenditure for the ill Khalifa aad been some ^|.-/'?/- in the ^ ee o'* t .e last -8 months revenues and that by the end of the year this disproportion would be much jreater. 4. xx is excellency then sujjested that a tax on tobacco should be imposed - an import duty,in fact - and further suggested that duties should be imposed on coffee,on tea and on gramophones. ^r.]3el 0 rave pointed out t at tie Customs di ties were fixed by treaty at S/a l d t at in view of the low rates collected at ^ubai it rauld be prejudicial to Bahrein interests to raise any duties aere. 1' is impressed him,but ilis Excellency 0 tneithen suggested one or two other sources of revenue none of llien calculated to touch tue pockets of Limself or I e rest oJ' tae a J.

Unfortunately the visit was short and I had not time to discuss fully with Your Excellency certain matters that were in my mind and I am therefore writing this letter and senciiit through Captain Prior. Your Excellency will remember that in the course cf our conversation I impressed upon you the necessity - or strict economy in the administration of the state at the present time. As in almost every country in the world Bahrain is going through an economic crisis and I under stand that during this year the expenditure has exceeded the income. Unless drastic measur es ...

It is clear that this state of affairs cannot continue indefinitely and that unless prompt steps are taken the present excellent order and administration will certainly suffer. It is not only in - | Bahrain that the necessity for the reduction of the expenditure has arisen. States all over the tforld, great and small, and other states in the Persian Gulf are also being compelled to revise their budgets. When I was in Bahrain a year ?^go I expressed the view to Your Excellency that the allowances of the ruling family should in no circumstances exceed five lakhs per annum. This statement was made on the assumption that the normal revenue of the state would be' about 10 lakhs, and the allowances would therefore amount to 50 :3 of the income. This is a very large amount, higher than in any other country, I believe. If however the revenue falls, then the allowances of the ruling family will considerably exceed 50% and in such circumstances it seems to me essential that they should be reduced. I would therefore suggest that a reduction of 10^ should be made in all the allowances of the .... -jr ~ * «UU d . IX Vc- L&gt;j &lt;S.s\ ' 'W\ «v c, _ _ 'J 1 .J^ „ r w w, !

Allowances granted for specific duties might be left untouched, I also understand that Your Excellency, with your well -known generos ity of heart, sometimes makes large loans to prominent persons who happen to be in need of money. However laudable and praiseworthy such actions may be m normal times, at a crisis such as the present, 1 feel that Your Excellency should, as far as possible, refrain from such generosity, and, further, that the special allowances granted to various members of the Al -Xhalifeh during the year for f Ids and the purchase of dates and their summer moves might suitably be discontinued. These measures will, I am afraid, be distasteful to so generous a person as Your Excellency, but I would not urge them upon you did I not feel that they were absolutely necessary, but it is essential that the state budget should balance, and I think it is for the ruling family to lead the way, and show their readiness to share in the burdens ...-4- '-r L l 5&gt;1 U) burdens that the present crisis imposes u P on a11 Usual Ending.

The oir, I rave the honour to forward an interesting report 'by i'r. T elgrave jFinancial Atlviyer to the Bahrain otate during the 'oast Arac ic year. Last year I prophesied a bad financial year,and the prophecy has unfortunately 'been fulfilled,but next year will x 1 ear, 'be v/orse^ as the irajority of tie pearl trerchants lr;cive exLaus -ed ^heir capital in fitting out such boat^s as they lave been ab-e to send to the Banks this year. The advent of -he Bahrain Oil orpany has {riven a spurious sense of confidence to the public,but nothing but a revival of the pearl trade can effectually assist Bahrain and the only effect so far has been to raise the price of labour. 2. I regret I do not consider that the present budget will balance and I estitrate that the year will see a further reduction in the State reserves of at least a lakh^. The budget is clearly a starvation one, save for the Al Khalifa who wtill receive trore % than half the total revenue,and it is to be deplored t^at Trore roney was not spent on productive works during the years of plenty. As 1 pointed out last year,the Custoirs receive but a fraction of the ironey they earn and the installation of a crane xc a belated recognition of their iirportance to the otate. The extension of the pier to deep water is beyond the resources of the otate at present but should be undertaken at the first opportunity. 3. The passport revenue I consider far too Mgh.and the cn S t » of h'' J '-v' Political Aeency, RECEIPT^ Hn ^ /&lt;r —' \fcahrain,the 28th, June 1931. « *r ies (AN Political Agent, Bahrain. c/ , 2f 6'3 f Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. ,Bushire,2. of pasdporta and subsequent visas bears hardly on poor people. It will be noticed that the Bahama at yuhamrerah have contributed largely to this revenue. 4. I concur with the view expressed by the Adviser that the Indian Police could be gradually supplanted by local iren,but they wi11 require much more serious training than they are given at present if they are to be of value. The Comirandant of Police does not display great industry in this respect,and it recently transpirea that- the Indian Police,who are supposed to be on a lilitary fceting,have only fired a course once during their five years in Bahrain.. 5. The situation in the schools deteriorated after kr.Delgrave 1 s depai-ure ior England and one of the religious teachers began to give trouble. Fortunately the end of the terir was at hand and since his services are being dispensed with it is to be hoped that next year will be freer from these difficulties. As Vr.Belgrave says,the school comrittees are quite useless and do nothing except intrigue with the teachers and the schools would be better off without them. L ' 6. The figures given under Transhipment cargo for the past year are misleading. Owing to a change in the system of collection much transhipment cargo is now shewn under the main heading of 'otearner Cargo' and 'Native Craft',but the actual volume of much transhipment cargo to the mainland remains/'the same.

The situation regarding the artesian wells is still very unsatisfactory. As a result of considerable pressure by the Political Agent the indiscriminate sinking of wells has ceased and Government sanction is required before new ones can be sunk, but immense quantities of water are being wasted and there is litt doubt that much damage haa been done to the flow by the introduct_ ion of shoddy material into the bores. ¥ajor Holmes stated recently that according to his calculations the head of the watc.rhad already dropped froci 24 to 17 feet and that if the pressure was further reduced it would soon be necessary to pump water. 6. The shrinking incciLe has provided Ir.Eelgrave with irany difficulties and he deserves every credit for the deteririination with whidkhe has tackled them.. Indeed,it is largely due to his efforts that the situation is not worse than it is.

B # M's olitical .-gent, Btbrain. ir, I have the honour to forward herewith the annual report oi the iiahrain iitate for 134S together with new i'udf et for 1350 # This is the sixth budget which I have had the honour of submitting to you. rhe year 1249 has been a very disastrous one finan cially, tne revenue of the St; te has decreased to an '• /Tr.in * extent. ith the exception of work on the rc nu;r- nh,- rraq road, the building of the uaran tine an tiie ^yinont -S the balance of the ' ^^naiaah Klectrio scheme, no important new works hove been carried out. ✓ It has been necessary to.draw on the funds, which are invested in Bombay, to the extent of fcs 1,70,000/... at the end of 1348 the total balance of the State's x unds was its o f 4 J, *:6b /- not inc Luding ka 300, 000 /— reserve • the end of 1349 the total balance was Bs 1,13,856/-/2. and a reserve fund of h 3,00,000/-. hen making the budget i 'or 1349 1 was aware that the year was likely to be a bad one and therefore I allowed for a decrease in the revenue of K* 83,000/- less thanthan the actual recei ts of 1348. Trifortunately the decrease in 1349 exceeded my estimation by Ks 2 ,33 ,000/-. Che reason for this serious falling off in revenue is not a local one but has been caused by the effects of the ^resent world wide trade degression which parti cularly affects a luxury trade such as the pearl industry on which depends not only the prosperity but almost the vrry existence of Bahrain. J feel confident that when trade conditions improve in Lurope and jmorica there will bo a similar improvement in Bahrain but until this occurs the revenue of the Bahrain otate will decrease. The estimated expenditure in the new budget has been confined to the narrowest limits consistent with carrying out the bare administration of the Gtate out in order to obtain the revenue for doin;: this it has been necessary to increase the Khanchia duty by an amount which is estimated as bein ; likely to produce one lac of r pees as a temporary emer ency measure. This matter is fully explained in the notes on the new Budget for 1350. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your obedient servant.

Cuatoms receints inolude the b% cnstoins duty, which is the min source of revenue, pier fees, biladys tax (nd the royalty i^aid by the Lend lag Conpnny to the State. The budgeted figures hrye been esticr ted by r.e after considering the actual receipts of the first ten months of 1349, 07.in^ to my prccv^r'ding on leave before the end of the eleventh month I om unable to examine the figures for the whole year. For the. lirct ten months of 1349 the customs receipts, excluding Khrnchic , were Es 4,6^,U0G/-. I have estimrtrd in the Budget for 1350 that the custoitts receipts excluding Khanchia, will show a decrease of b Ks 14 .000 ^ throughout the completed yer^r, when comj^red ith the 1849 collections, &gt;resuriin - thtt the last two months ^ 1349 produce a similar average to the first ten months of thtt year. On customs receipts of Es 5,40,000/- which is the esti mated amount for 1350, the Khanchia at the existing rate would amount to lis 60,000/- thus bringing the total customs receipts un to six lacs only for the whole yaar. This six lacs, with the addition of the other items of revenue which the State derives from all other sources would then ft 11 short of the required sum which is absolutely necessary to cover the ordinary recurrent expenditure, which has been reduced to the very minimu amount, by one lac of rupees. ithout drawing again heavily on the Reserve fund it would be impossible to cover the ordinary experuiiture during the coming year. The Kevenue mist be raised by one lac of rupees. On examining the State's present sources of income, evert (armrt froin customs, I fiad tiu .t therf» are none which o^n be reoaonebly reiar or which oonld produce r .nythin ; near the amount of cjtra revenue which ia retire!. These othfr sources of revenue in theraaelves only amount to . bout one sixth of the estimateii oustour, revenue. I c uisider it inf.jvissble to with the present 5^ ad v* loren oin Ur-r dut y on imn arts. a fh-1 rate hrs nuch to recommend it; it hrs been fixed by treaty and also being a low rr te it creates a satisfactory impression aaon : intending im ort rs, though this is tx rhaps som-jwhat of an illusion as including all inoi&lt; ental dues and fees to the Landing company etc. almost 7]&amp; is now paid on imports before they retch the market. There ran? ins the Klianchia. The Thanchia fee is somewhat in the nrture of Demurrage, or e Warehouse due. It is in the first -uace collpcted on sll imports which are then allowed to remain in the customs v\'rehouse for ten c]-^r Mridn? days excluJinK holidays. On the expiration of this ten .ays if the imports are not I'e- moved anotue r 'h- nchia cb? r e is levied and t;ie f «:oods mty iX rer in 'or r f^rt ^r ten ir • r., in ractice thir ^i^e.^iently done. The Khanohia is levied according to a liit of set rates which were decided upon many years n^o by the local merchants, the rates are very inconsistent and eppe?r to heve been made with no if ; 1 v r c&gt;ys ten. It is proposed to chr r e a new rate of one anna per n:aund on all bag c-r p from the be ginning of 1.'50. ihis increase will produce an additional lac of rupees which ill balance the budget. It will be clearly indie? ted that this is entirely an emergency measure. If trade improves after 1350, or if the necessary amount is realised before the end of 1350 this addition will be withdrawn and the rate willwill revert to a ooi ied form or to the previous r^te. impart from the ^resent necessity of increasing the Khnnchia there is a rea^ ueed of revising the charges on other cargo as we: 1 oa .a, Ci .rgo and during this emevency period thia revision will be dealt with. ihc increase 'ill undoubtedly oanse a general outcry aaoag the iserohents but it will scarcely rtdse the cost of 1 i/in r i. or instance in the Cf4ae of rice, which is tiie largest i«port afTected, the adilitional duty will only add 2 annas to the cost of one bag of rice. nresent it is proroaod to apply the increase only to bag car^o, which foras 70% of the whole car^o but when th^ rates are nermanently revised the revision should apnly tc r 11 sorts of cer;-o. It is uniortunate that it should be necessijry to increase Uiiation but a^ t. e sa ^ie time it is a well known fact that Bahrain is no re li-htly taxed than any other State in the ■^' &gt;L * • itii the exception of the customr- duty and a 1 oc 1.1 (S) house tax in ' anamah and tuharrak which collected by the bnicipalitiee t ere are no local taxes whatever.
