Will you please refer to paragraph 134 of Bahrain Agency Intelligence Summary No. 12 of 1947? 2. I do not know what the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah thinks he is playing at giving away plots of land to Dubai. I should have thought every inch was of potential value these days. 3. Besides #iich it is Dubai’s possession of similar plots in Abu Dhabi which have been such a bone of contention and a cause of trouble in the past and we do not want the same sort of thing arising between Dubai and Ras al Khaimah. 4. I should be grateful if you would look into the matter, though I don’t suppose there is much we can do now. G.N. Jackson Require, M.B.E. , Political Agent, BAHRAIN . RHL. bahrm*CONFIDENTIAL .

Dear Colonel Galloway, POLITICAL AGENCY BAHRAIN. The 27th of August, 1947. Please refer to your denii-official letter No.l369-S, dated the 21st July, 1947. 2. I enclose a list of date gardens owned by the Shaikh of Dubai in Has al Khaiia&amp;h territory. Items Nos. 2, 5 and 6^ are established gardens acquired by Shaikh Said recently - possibly as security against further difficulties with his Buraimi gardens. Item No. 7, which was the subject of your deni-official letter, is a large undeveloped plot of land in the Jirri which Shaikh Kashid obtained as a gift from the ShaiKh of Has al Khaimah primarily as a grazing ground for his camels. Shaikh Rashid is now developing its latent v/ater supplies and has started cultivating lucerne, in addition to planting 1,600 date palms. 3. If you have no objection, I propose to suggest to the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah that he should not in future alienate any land at all without specifically reserving the oil rights to himself and without causing a copy of the deed of transfer to be recorded in the Agency at Sharjah. I do not think we can, at this stage, do much more. Yours sincerely, The Hobble Lt-Col. A.C. Galloway, C.I.Iii., O.B.E. , Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain. NS.— — (9 CONFIDENTIAL '.0.
