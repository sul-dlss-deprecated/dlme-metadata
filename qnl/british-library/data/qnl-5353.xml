The official English translation will be forwarded to you as soon as the text is published in the English version of the Gazette. 4. In handing my note No. 349 of the 9th July to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I reminded him that the board of management must, under article 2 of the agreement of the 31st March, be constituted immediately and that the transfer of the railway system would not be complete until this had been done. I also reminded him that payment of the sum due to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom must be made before the 29th July next (article 1 of the agreement). In reply, his Excellency informed me that the constitution of the board was at present the subject of active discussion by the Council of Ministers, but that he expected a decision within the next few days. He also stated that payment of the sum of £400,000 had been duly authorised. I have since heard from Mr. Hogg, adviser to the Ministry of Finance, that payment will be made in London. I have, &amp;c.

It follows from article 3 of the agreement that any diminution of the powers of the board during the period of twenty years from the date of the transfer of the railways would be a breach of the agreement. In these circum stances His Majesty’s Government trust that the Iraqi Government will consult [756 dd—1]\7V 2 ^ them if there is any question of amending the law referred to above so as to affect the powers of the board, and will not, during the period of twenty years, repeal the law or modify it in a manner which, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, would undesirably diminish the powers of the board.

(No. 199.) Sir, Bagdad, Ajyril 20, 1936. WITH reference to my telegram No. 82 of the 14th April, I have the honour to furnish you with the following further details of the passage through Parliament of the law for the ratification of the Anglo-Iraqi Railway Agreement signed in Bagdad on the 31st March. 2. In the Chamber the agreement was hotly attacked by two Deputies, Mahmud Ramiz, an ex-Turkish officer on pension, who has been conspicuous for his attacks on the Government throughout the session, and Ali Mahmud, a Nationalist lawyer, Deputy for Bagdad. But the Government were stoutly defended by the Prime Minister and Nuri Said, and the ratification Bill passed its third reading by 65 votes to 3. In the Senate the agreement was also debated with spirit and strongly opposed by Naji Suwaidi, Jamil Madfai and Maulud Mukhlis. Its defenders were again Yassin-al-Hashimi and Nuri Said, and on its third reading twelve Senators voted for and three against the ratification Bill. 3. You will remember that Nuri returned to Bagdad from London just before the conclusion of the agreement and signed it at the instance of the Prime Minister. He was not able, therefore, to escape the duty of defending it. But the fulfilment of this duty must have cost him much play-acting, for in his heart he disapproved of the agreement, holding that no payment of any kind should have been made to His Majesty’s Government. 4. The chief points of criticism levelled at the Railway Agreement in Parliament were :— (1) That effective control still remained in the hands of His Majesty’s Government through the posts reserved for British officials. (2) That the price of transfer was too high, and that the railways should have been obtained for Iraq without any cash payment at all. (3) That the new arrangements concerning the liabilities of the railways (article 5) were far less favourable to the Iraqi Government than those contained in the notes appended to the Treaty of Alliance of 1930. The Government speakers did not have much difficulty in exposing the hollowness of this criticism. 5. In the press the terms of settlement have been well received, and in some instances applauded as a further success for the Government. Only one paper, the Bayan, belonging to Hikmat Sulaiman, attacked the agreement. The arguments used were similar to those which had been voiced in Parliament, and with these there was mixed a good deal of personal criticism of the Prime Minister. Hikmat’s paper is, however, of little importance. Only two issues were published during the past year, and after its brief appearance to attack the railway settlement it has again vanished. This evanescent excursion of Hikmat Sulaiman into politics is generally regarded as a rather good joke and was probably not intended to be taken seriously. 6. Public opinion, on the whole, is well satisfied with the agreement, but the more suspiciously inclined are disposed to think that there must be a catch somewhere, because they find it difficult to understand why His Majesty’s Govern ment should have consented to dispose of their rights in the railway system for so little.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 75 of the 1st April reporting the signing of the railway agreement on the 31st March, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith the undermentioned documents :— (a) The actual text of the agreement in English and Arabic, as signed by Nuri Pasha and myself. (b) Two extra copies of the English text of the agreement. (c) Certified copies of my notes Nos. 177, 178 and 179 to Nuri Pasha.

(e) Certified copies of my note, No. 176. to Yassin Pasha and his signed reply in Arabic, together with a certified English translation. 2. I did not ask for a reply to my note No. 177, relative to the powers to be given to the board of management, as it contained no proposal to which the agreement of the Iraqi Government was required, but merely a statement of the intentions of His Majesty’s Government. 3 The special wording of my note No. 176, relating to the purchase of railway materials in the United Kingdom, and the reference which it contained to conversations which had taken place and letters which had been exchanged between Yassin Pasha and Mr. Bateman, made it unsuitable to be addressed to Nuri Pasha. I therefore arranged that the Prime Minister should accept this note and sign the reply thereto. 4 As you are aware, it is intended that of the above-mentioned documents only my note No. 179 and Nuri Pasha’s reply thereto shall be published with the agreement. 5. The current session of Parliament has been prolonged from the end of March to the 15th April to facilitate the passage of the law for the ratification of the railway agreement, and Nuri Pasha has informed me that the Bill will be sent to the Chamber within the next few days. In order to avoid any delay in the exchange of ratifications once the Iraqi law has received the Royal assent, I shall be grateful to receive the necessary instrument of ratification from His Majesty’s Government as soon as possible. I shall be glad to be furnished at the same time with the final text of the note to be addressed to the Iraqi Government at the time of ratification, to which you referred in the last paragraph of your telegram No. 61 of the 26th March. 6. As regards the question mentioned in the last part of your telegram No. 63 of the 26th March, I have made it clear that His Majesty’s Government would be unwilling to assent to a method of payment which would entail any appreciable diminution of that part of the liquid resources of the railways which should properly be devoted to renewals, replacement and betterment. As a result of conversations with Colonel Ward and Mr. Hogg. I am satisfied that His Majesty’s Government need have no anxiety on this score. I have, &amp;c. ARCHIBALD CLARK KERR.

NURI SAID. Annex IV. Exchange of Notes regarding a Preference to British Railway Material. ( 1 ) Sir A. Clark Kerr to Yassin Pasha. (No. 176. Confidential.) My dear Prime Minister, Bagdad, March 31, 1936. YOUR Excellency will recollect that, when Mr. Bateman first informed you on the 28th August, 1935, of the new proposals of His Majesty’s Government for the transfer to the Iraqi Government of their ownership of the Iraqi railway system, he explained that His Majesty’s Government would look to the Iraqi Government, if and when the transfer of the railways has been effected, to give preference as far as possible to British railway material. Mr. Bateman confirmed his remarks on this point in his letter to you of the 31st August, 1935, and in youi Excellency’s reply to his further note of the 28th September you were good enough to put on record that you regarded the principles and conditions which had been communicated to you as a suitable basis for the final settlement of the railway question. 2. Now that we have happily been able to conclude a formal agreement for the transfer of the railways, I shall be grateful if your Excellency will confirm that, in all cases where United Kingdom manufacturers offer suitable material on reasonable conditions (due regard being paid to factors such as quality, performance and durability, as well as to price and terms of payment), material of United Kingdom manufacture or production will be purchased to meet all future requirements of the railway system. 3. Should there be grounds for supposing that conditions offered by United Kingdom suppliers cannot be considered reasonable, the Iraqi Government will have 1 the right to bring the facts to the notice of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in order that thorough investigation may be made into the circumstances of any particular case.

ARTICLE 3 of the agreement which we have signed to-day, relative to the transfer to the Iraqi Government of the rights possessed by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom in respect of the ownership of the railway system of Iraq, refers to powers with which the future Board of Management is to be invested by Iraqi legislation. 2. I have been instructed by His Majesty’s Government to inform your Excellency that the adequacy of these powers is a matter to which His Majesty’s Government attach great importance, and that they will therefore require to be satisfied, before ratifying the agreement, that the relevant Iraqi legislation will in fact give to the board adequate powers effectively to control and administer the railways as provided in article 3 of the agreement.

Your telegram Yo. 55c irrf n. . lime iiinisteij whom I saw yesterday, raised no objection to procedure proposed nor to exchange of confidential notes about purchase of material in the United ningdom (see your telegram hoc 47 of the 27th of February). _____— -■ —■■&gt; In the course of conversation I reminded him of the assurance he had given me in December about reserve and renewal funds (see paragraph 4 of my Saving telegram ho. 55 of the 14th of December). He said that I must have misunderstood him, for it had always been his intention to draw on accumulated resources of the railways in order to meet part of the payment to be made to j..cis hajesty s Government. He saw no reason why he should not do so, since these funds were not required for current needs. He would of course take Colonel Ward’s advice as to the extent to vniich uhese lurds could be safely drawn upon. He ¥/as prepared to piovide uhe new general manager with ail the liquid resources he needed and to take legislative measures to raise a loan for such new capital as might be required. -xe pointed out that the last balance sheet showed liabilities uixdei the two heads (a) His Lajesty’s Government’s Liquidation Account (b) General Reserve, which in the past had been used for capital developments. The claim to (a; lapsed with the agreement and2. 39 ( ^—G / and (b) was quite inadequate for the extensions contemplated as a result of the Agreement and would be replaced bp loan funds. As these two items disappeared from the liabilities he felt fully justified in utilising the*cash resources released to the extent which Colonel hard might consider reasonable. I have consulted Kogg, who is to be the second British member of the Board. he is satisfied. There has been no time to consult Colonel ward but Hogg has explained matter to ward’s finance officer who happened to be in Bagdad yesterday and he too is satisfied. If when I am able to consult him Colonel hard raises no objection, I assume that in the circumstances we need not attempt to interfere with Prime hinistar’s plans. I believe the Prime Minister to be acting in good faith, for Hogg tells me that when he wanted to insert full figure of £400,000 in capital works programme Yassin was taken completely by surprise* Moreover, justification for his contention is to be found in his conversation with Mr. Bateman on the 28th of August recorded in the minute enclosed in Mr. Bateman’s letter to Mr. Mendel Ho. 245/39/55 of the 12th of September.4o X' r / /. * r ! 9 1^ 9 NO jJl8TRIBU r fIU&gt;i Telegram (en clair) from oir A.

It follows, therefore, that4 / %z I j s y 2 . that any diminution of the pov/ers of the Board during the period of the agreement would be a breach of the agreement. 3. In these circumstances His Majesty's Government trust that the Iraqi Government will consult them if there is any ques tion of amending the legislation so as to affect the powers of the Board and will make no amendments which, in the view of His Majesty's Government, would undesirably diminish the powers of the Board* 1 .Decode, fPT 12139 NO DisJRl i ffijgQif .

Although agreement as it stands will with exceptions of Article 1 and 5 come to an end in 20 years' time, it is possible that some of the arrangements made in virtue of it will in fact be allowed to continue either provisionally or on some new basis (see Article 11 of Treaty of Alliance) c Such continuance would be made more difficult by Iraqi amendment categorical nature of which would lend itself to contention that all the machinery set up by the agreement must cease to exist on the date of its termination. /.J r.

Re-draft to read as follows 'The board of management referred to in Article 2 shall be constituted, and invested by legislation with adequate powers to enable it effectively to control and administer railways and shall continue to possess such powers. The railway budget shall continue to be a budget annexed to the general budget'. ihe.....5! 2 . The Prime Minister objected strongly that there would be no hope of his getting through Parliament any reference to legislation the terms of which had been agreed to by the two G-ovemments (see my immediately following telegram). Article 4* Delete the whole of second paragraph. Article 5. Delete whole of article. Prime Minister when first discussing these Articles reverted to his original proposal for a private exchange of notesc When I reminded him of Iraqi Government’s treatment of Nuri Pasha’s private letter about the air defence force he at once admitted that this procedure would not work and after con sulting council of Ministers he has now proposed that the substance of these tv. r o Articles should be embodied in an exchange of notes to be attached to the Agreement, submitted to Parliamere and published. When I asked what was to be gained by this he explained that Article 4 was bound to have rough passage through Parliament and that the Cabinet thought that by an exchange of notes now, proposed number of posts reserved for British officials would be less apparent, for they believed (this will a smile) that the most sceptical could be counted upon to read no more than the Agreement itself. Article 6. Delete words from ”in the case of any u to words ”remained in force'’ inclusive and substitute ”if any such liability, the subject matter whereof existed before the date of transfer, does not come to light until after that date”. ^, He said that he would find it extremely difficult to explar meaning of your text to Parliament and that he had been advised b v Drower that formula now proposed fully covered liability in question, and that he thought # that it would be less likely to open up unwelcome discussion in Parliament.■■■■■■■■ I)ecypher.

Proposed Agreement for transfer of Iraqi railways]. Phrase to be substituted for 'railway lands' in article 1 should be 'lands in possession or control of railway administration'. Otherwise His Majesty's Government accept all the Prime Minister's amendments, including his proposal that substance of second paragraph of article 4 and whole of article 5 be embodied in exchange of Notes to be attached to the Agreement and published. Drafts of Notes on this point and on that arising out of article 6, enclosed in your letter of February 26th to Mr. Rendel are approved, except that phrase 'relating to the railways' should be inserted after 'liability' where the word first occurs in paragraph 1 of the latter Note. If, however, reference to agreed legislation in article 5 is to be dropped, His Majesty's Government propose (a), to address a Note to the Iraqi Government at the time of signing the Agreement, stating that it will be observed that article 5 refers to adequate powers which are to be defined by Iraqi legislation, and that His Majesty's Government attach great importance to these powers being adequate and will therefore require to be satisfied before ratifying Agreement that the Iraqi legislation will give adequaoe powers. (This should ensure consultation since it will clearly be useless to present to the Iraqi Parliament legislation which nis Majesty's Government consider inadequate); and (b) to address a further Note to the Iraqi Government at the time55 tine of exchanging ratifications, stating that it is a condition of the rgreenert that the Board shall have adequate powers: that His Majesty's Government have seen the powers which the Iraqi legislation confers on the Board and are ratifying the agreement hecause they consider these powers adequate; that it follows that any diminution of the powers of the Board during the period of 4 he Agreement would he a breach of the Agreement; and that His Majesty’s G-o^erament therefore trust that the Iraqi Government will consult them if there is any question of amending the legislation so as to afreet the powers of the Board,, and will make no amendments which, in the view of His majesty's Government, would undesirably diminish the powers of the Board. You should inform the Prime Minister of the procedure proposed in the preceding paragraph and explain that it is designed to safeguard position in a manner which will not expose the Iraqi Government to Parliamentary criticism.\ 1 5 c; q i \.J fv O O 'J» 57 3 (Eo 501/25/9^) NO DISTRIBUTION.

The position la that His Majesty’s Government have node on offer to the Irari Government, and it is clearly likely to lead to more speedy and satisfactory results if the subsequent negotiations take place on the basis cf a document prepared by the irarty which has taken the initiative. Apart from this general consideration, the i'rnni draft ia imnnitable in form and in and 3 0 of the 14th Mocen'ier, 1935, forwarding and commenting upon the text of a draft note prepared by the Jtidicial Adviser to the Iraqi Government and designed to form the Exchange of notes. The receipt of the Iraqi draftmany respect a in substance* As recnrdo fom, it doeo indeed preouijpooe ratification end in this respect accord with the views of His Itodcsty # o Ocvcranent (see paragraph ll of Mr* Batenan’o note r!o,/?04 of tho COth September to Yasin Pasha). But for the purpose of rrtificatian an Exchange of notes is inappropriate^ and further tho Ir*a^i constitution and practice up to date seen to point to nn a^reonent between Heads of States* as records substance I need riention only two points* Firstly^ the Iraqi draft leavee room for considerable doubt as to when the transfer of tie railways is to take place, and provides that the period .if control by the proposed Board of rian- genent is to borin from the date of the signature of the note and not Iron the date of the effective transfer of the railways# secondly, the draft contains no provision for* satisfying His Tla^esty’c Hovernnent that the powers of the Board of TTanagenent will be and will remain adequate* The Iraqi draft is thus imacceptaMs to Hia 3 la peaty’s Govemrient and I request that you will row put forward the enclosed draft as the basis for future negotiations* 3* I appreciate the point that the eventual agreement should be worded in ouch a way as to be easily translatable into Arabic* I do not consider that this io a valid reason for leaving the preparation of the text to the Irarrl Government; but the cone-: deration hne been borne in mind in preparing the enclosed draft, and every effort has been nude to keep the language as simple as possible and to avoid involved legal phrase clog;*. 4* Turning to tho tens of the enclosed draft agreement I have no observations to «A?cr on the Jrcanble a vzhieh has been dravm up on the usua*. - tnes for an agrecncsnt bettTeen Heads of states* Article 1/£&gt;3 &lt;3* Thio /article nnlceo it clear t?^at the tmnsrep of* the i*a.i It/ayG io rtopcnciont on the pfiynent in f*u3.1 of* the purohnoe price and on the constitution of the Board of TVmngenent* and it eets a tine limit for the payment of the purchase price* ^ou Tzill observe also that the T 7 orda n includinc f all railway lands and reserve and renewal funds H have been inserted to clarify the 'rights” possessed by Ifio Majesty’s Ooverniaent which are to be tr/msferred to the Irani Government. The phrase ♦railway lands“ in this enumeration is intended to cover all %hc lands possessed by the railway administration whether or not such lands are actually used for railway purposes* i draw attention to this point because the draft note prcx&gt;arcd by Mr. broker refers to the transfer of 'immovable property... used for railway purposes' and implies that land not so ised is not included* But by their attitude towards the desire of the Irani Government to eroot a museum on Iona not so uccdf His ?.!aje8ty t o Government are committed by implication to making over to the Irani Government the whole of the land belonging to the railway administration. 6. In Article n of ths draft the words 'which shall be 'attached to one of the *'i liotrieo of His Government' have been inserted to meet the tlesire of the Irani Government to emphasise the ultimate dependence of the proposed Railway Board upon a Government Department* His ya^eoty 1 © Government much prefer this wording to the provision inserted by the Council of '/inistars in the Ira^i draft note (Bagdad telegram No*208 of ir^B) t&lt;» the effect that 'the railway Arti ;;lo S department/'depnrtncnt chall be considered to be n oovomnent *x;pnrtnont to one of the 'iaiotriea *• and repeated in substance in the draft law prepared by ”)rower.

BY AIR LhJL. ?? k) My telegram No. 50 Saving of November 7th. 1. jrime Minister has now agreed to following key posts: (1) G-eneral Manager. (2) Inspector-General of Traffic. (5) Chief Engineer. (4) Chief Mechanical Engineer. (5) Deputy for (5). (6) Deputy for (4). 2. He is unwilling to include two district engineers, as he maintains that Iraqis will bo able to fill these posts before end of period of 2u years. He would, however, be prepared to enter into gentleman’s agreement with me to effect that these posts should be filled for at least 5 years by British officials. 5. Prime Minister claims, I think rightly, that post of Chief Accountant is one which Iraqis are capable of filling now. This view is shared by Yheatley and Hogg, who tell me that in other departments post of Chief Accountant is adequately filled by Iraqis. Prime Minister is, however, prepared to include in proposed gentleman’s agreement stipulation that British official shall be employed for at least 10 years as Chief Auditor. This would ensure a large measure of British control of the accounts for 10 years. Hogg, Wheatley and Co onel Tainsh suggest that Chief Auditor should act as Deputy and Financial Adviser to General Manager.*6 2 . &gt;\ /'K -rime liinister has disclosed that reason for change of designation of Traffic Manager to that of Inspector-General of Traffic and of his unwillingness to include Deputy to this official among key posts is as follows. Pie plans to appoint an Iraqi at once to post of Deputy Traffic Manager and in due course to assign to him the executive duties now performed by Traffic Manager. Thereafter duties of Inspector-General of Traffic would he advisory. He is prepared to guarantee that British Inspector- General shall continue to perform executive functions for 5 years and to include tills point in proposed gentleman's agreement. 5. I shall be glad to learn whether His Majesty's Government are prepared to agree to these compromises. They are the result of prolonged discussions and represent, I think, the most favourable terms to which Prime Minister is willing to agree. His idea is that gentleman's agreement embodying them should take the form of an exchange of notes, which would not be published. 6. In support of his plan regarding Traffic Manager, Yassin i Pasha explained that, in time of trouble it was essential that railway traffic should be controlled not by a British official, but by an Iraqi staff Officer. I am not clear whether he intends that Staff Officer shall in due course be permanent Traffic Manager. This point does not, however, appear to be relevant to the main issue, which may be put in the following question: are the duties of Traffic manager technical enough to justify the closing of this post to Iraqis for 20 years? In my opinion the answer to this question is no. Please see my immediately following telegram.3 o c a o e .

At request of Prime Minister I have discussed ques tion with Hogg who described the position of the Iraqi Government in this matter to be as follows: They would accept no liability for compensation for loss of concessionary rights* In the event of a claim in respect of tangible assets they point out that under the Treaty agreement His Majesty’s Government accepted in form full responsibility for any claim: the consideration of transfer having been agreed to be payable in shares., payment for any liability arising under this heading also to be made in shares. Iraqi Government see no reason why the substitu tion of a cash payment for the issue of paper should be held to alter the principle that the liability falls on His Majesty’s Government and they hold that they could argue that reimbursements in this case should be in cash c They are however, in view of all the circumstances, prepared to share in any liability which may arise, and they offer one-fifth.'V 0)0 €&gt; 2 Q 3^ I held cut little prospect of His Majesty 1 s Government heinp prepared to accept either the standpoint or the offer of the Iraqi Gcverirrent, But, as Hogg felt convinced that the Iraqi Government would not give way, I promised to acquaint you with their views. 4 0 Hogg considers Iraqi Government’s argument to he sound and, in view of the very doubtful cash value of the shares which were to he held by His Majesty's Government under the Treaty agreement, i an inclined to share his opinion. In any case it would he unfortunate if the whole Railway agreement were wrecked on this comparatively minor issue and I venture to suggest that His Majesty’s Govemmeni should agree to accept at least a half of the liability, especially as His Majesty’s Government appear to believe the prospects of claim maturing to he slight, 5 0 Prime Minister has suggested that any agreement eventually reached on this point should not he embodied in main agreement out snoulo. form the subject of a separate excnange of notes, a. proposal in which I see considerable advantage,r T&gt; z 9298 93 f ^ NO DISr^Ii0 3KE T eie G rran (on clair) from Sir A.

Prime minister would like His Majesty’s Government to assume liability for higher proportion on the ground that usufruct of Begdad-Smnarra line has been enjoyed exclusively by His Majesty’s Government and present value of rolling stock end material to Iraqi Government is not great enough to warrant their bearing the lion’s shore of liability.

September 30, 1935.^ n CONFIDENTIAL. Section 4. [E 5862/163/93] Mr. Bateman to Sir Samuel IIoare. ~ (Received September 30.) (No. 502.) Sir, Bagdad, September 19, 1935. WITH reference to my despatch No. 425 of the 1st August, I have the honour to report that Mr. Ashton, the local manager of the British Oil Development Company, having returned from leave in the United Kingdom, called on me yesterday to give me the latest information about his company’s activities. 2 . He said that the capital necessary for the construction of the company’s portion of the proposed railway had now been found. He could not say who the lenders were, but the total amount required would be about one and a half million sterling. 3. The financial group had pointed out that, according to article 35 of the concession agreement, the Government had the right to foreclose and take over the company’s property in the event of their defaulting in the payments due to the Government. The group therefore required, as a pre-condition of their loaning money for railway purposes, that the new line should be regarded as distinct altogether from the company’s other property, and that it should not fall within the province of article 35 of the concession agreement. They also desired to receive an assurance that the Iraqi Government would not insist on their right to take over the railway if it is not managed to their satisfaction; and also that if for any other reason the Iraqi Government decide to dispossess the owners, it shall be on the understanding that they are adequately compensated. Mr. Ashton has put definite proposals in this sense before the Iraqi Government, who are now considering them. 4. My German colleague (who seems to be an coura?it with all the latest British Oil Development Company’s developments) gave me very similar information a few days ago, and the Prime Minister, whom I questioned on the subject, told me that he had temporised with the company until some arrangement was in sight for the future of the existing Iraq railways. 5. Meanwhile, I gather from a letter from Lord Glenconner that agreement was reached in July with the Syrian authorities concerning the rates to be charged for the transport of oil and asphalt from the company’s oilfields to Tripoli, and that a group of French refiners had come forward with an offer of additional capital— presumably to help the company’s drilling operations. 6 . Mr. Ashton could tell me nothing in answer to questions regarding the source whence the material for the construction of the new line would be forthcoming. I have, &amp;c. C. H. BATEMAN.

The first oonoeroe the composition of the nixed Anglo**Iraqi board of aanagef&amp;ent to toe appointed toy the Iraqi Oovcrnnent. 4. You will have noted fros Yaaln Pasha*a letter of September 11th, which fomed the enclosure in my despatch Ho. 490 of September 18th, that the Iraqi Clovemnent want the Mans enent Board to become a Department under the Ministry concerned (presumably, the Ministry of Kconomioa and Communications) and also that it should toe ooaposed of senior railway officials, of when the majority should be Iraqi 'officials*. There would appear to be a good deal of confused thought in these suggestions - probably due to the fact that the letter *ae drafted in a hurry Just before the departure Hurl Pasha for Oeneva. The Right Honourable Sir Samuel J.a. Hoar*, Bt., etc., etc., etc. O.G.S.X., O.b.B 6. They ($(&amp;&gt; 6.

On the other hand, when the railways paaa into the poaaeaalon of the Iraqi Government, preaunahly all the off lours in the railways will he Iraqi 'officiala*, no natter what their nationality* Points such as these will heed to he cleared up before detailed discussion aa to the composition of the alxad hoard of nanagaaient begins* I presuae, howewer, that Mia Majesty 9 s (toveraaent will raise no objection to the proposal that the railways shall he adnlnlatared sa a Govommnt department, prowided that reasonable financial and adninistratisa independence la secured and that railway funds are kept distinct* In the light of the shore reaarks, however, I as not clear how the board could he formed if those serving on it are to he chosen froa railway officials only* $or do I think that it would serve ite purpose if it were so composed* 7. Hitherto, the railways have been an organisation apart* This has lad to friction and ulsunder*tending* it the administration is to run smoothly in future, it seems to me that the Board should he so construeted as to he sole to suggest lines of policy to the Qovernaeat and to interpret the Oovernment’s policy once it has bean laid down* The general manager should he given euffleiant power and latitude to make his own arrangements within these limits* g. Thia leads me to the conclusion that the Government itself should he directly represented on the Board* If you agreeAgr*« with this wiww, I would propose that th© ohsiman of the Board should# froa the beglnalng# ho on Iraqi Miaistor* Xt Is of course aost do sirs hie that the Board should ye as ^poraanoat os possible sad that its members should he tabued with e sense of responsibility end have an inoentiws to asks the i railways &amp; suooess* Perasnency is not s characteristic of the tenure of Iraqi ministers} hut this may not he wholly disadvantageous# since *temporary* chairmen will probably he more ready and willing to listen to the advice of their more permanent advisers* 9* For the rest# I think it will be well to res ©amend that the mixed Board he kept as asmll as possible* It should be composed of not more than five members* On the British side# the Qencrel Manager must obviously serve# and as regards the other member# it would perhaps he scvisable to suggest that he should be nominated by the Iraqi Government# but in agreement with the General Manager* So far as concerns the other two members# it will perhaps he best to leave the Iraqi Government to make their own proposals* It le possible that they '&lt;x&amp;ht wish to nominate officials auch as tha Director-General of Bconomloa and Communications and the Director-General ot Finance# hut it is equally possible that they would not object to the nomination of one of the British advisers or s representative of the Chamber of Commerce* 10. I shall he glad to be furnished with your views on this side of the question as soon as poasibla* 11. km regards the key posts to be retained for British personnel# I anticipate a certain amount of discussion on this point* There are# at present# 80 British officials in the Iraq Railways* The acting Director is strongly of opinion that# for the next five years at least# 8b of these should he mtatMd. He points out that hitherto It has prove* •xoeedinifljr difficult to recruit young Irakis of tha required standardstandard of •*mcaUon t who wore willing to start at the nation rang of the ladder and work their war through the various gr- of their profession until they hecono expert* Thi^# X fear» 1» unfortunately true. The general feeling amongst Iraqi students la that 'Jonny's as good as his :aaatt*r ,f as soon as he has passed an examination. Mr. alachwood adds that the number of Hritiah officials to be retained will therefore depend largely on (a) the progress of the Iraqi staff and &lt;b) the future development of the railways. Fop example # s permanent milway ^vUii^ over the Tigris to replace the present wagon ferry would tend to reduce the expert supervision now required, whereas extension* of the lines would have the opposite effeet. JUs suggestion is that all the posts in the attached list should oe r iiied oy aritish personnel for at least five years. he has left it to as to suggest whieh of the posts should be retained for twenty years. 12. It weens clear to me that, of these, the following at least must be regarded ae teey posts for twenty years* (s) Oeneral Manager. (b) Traffic Manager. (o) Chief Mechanical Engineer. (d) Chief Engineer. (#) Deputies for (b), (c) and (d). (f) Two Senior Diatrict Engineers.

But thane, I gather, are poets for which Iraqi* may be found well fitted long before the lapse of twenty years, and it may be difficult to insist on their being regarded aa key posts for the full period. 15. I think the ease will be met (after settling the post* to be filled for twenty years) by stipulating that as many as possible of the remainder in the list be given contracts for five years, on the understanding that the poets should continue to be filled by British personnel for varying periods up to « maxi um of fifteen years or so long as competent and qualified Iraqis are not avallabla. 16. I would propose that in dimssing thee# details with the Irani Oovarnment in the near future, I should be guided by the advice of the higher Railway cfflelala and the advisers to the Ministries of Finance and Economies and Gomaunications. It will probably be necessary to call then into the actual conversations. neither the Iraqi niniatere with when I shall have to disous* the subject, nor I ayself, have the technical knowledge to argue the case adequately. 17. Sc far ae I can Judge at the moment, there le no thought in the minds of Iraqi ministers of wholesale dlanisaele from the railways.

His Majesty's Government have reconsidered proposals for new settlement of question of Iraqi Railways, and you are now authorised to approach Iraqi Goveriimexit on lines proposed in my immediately following telegram* Matter should in the first instance he discussed informally with competent Ministers, and proposals only put in writing if you have reason to believe that Iraqi ^overume^t will not take serious exception to any of the propose a berms. 0up ppimary objective is hhat effective management should remain in British hands and for this reason it is most desirable that there should oe a joino Anglo-j-raqj- Boa d of Management* His Majesty’s Government are, how- eve r, prepared to a-gree that Brioish as well coS Iraqi members should be appointed by the Iraqi Goverri;ent in view of the proposed transfer to them of absolute ovvner- dn.ip« For your information, His Majesty’s Government might also, in the last resort, agree to British members being in a minority. A British General manager is, in any case, essential. This is not to be taken to mean, however, that His Majesty’s Government will insist on the retention of the present British manager beyond the term of his existing contract, and if you think that acceptance of condition would be facilitated thereby, you may drop a hint to this effect. Provided.....1 117 Provided sufficient keyposts remain in British hands toensure essential cortrol and efficiency, His Majesty 1 s Government would raise no objection to an overhaul of posts now occupied by non-Iraqis, with a view to a re duction of their total number br to an increase in the numbers of Iraqis in 'officer' grades 0 This suggestion may appeal to the Iraqis and you are at liberty to make it* It seems, however, preferable to postpone specifying the requirements of His Majesty’s Government in regard to key posts until the preliminary reaction of the Iraqi Government is known* If it is not definitely hostile, I shall be glad to receive your suggestions. As regards material, proposal to seek form al under taking that the Iraqi Government should purchase only British materials for railways has been dropped, partly because it seems impossible to bind Iraqi Government to purchase material in what may not prove most economical market, but also because wording of Article 11 of Iraq’s Declaration of Guarantees seems to make it difficult if not impossible to draft an undertalcing which would not lead to strong protest from other Powers. The utmost importance is still attached to maintaining the purchase of durable British material (e.g., locomotives, rolling stock, rails and bridge material). In the course of negotiations you should endeavour to secure from the Iraqi Government an informal promise that whenever possible preference will be given to British materials, out the fact that the promise, even if obtained, would be informal makes it all the more important that British management Strategic 0 0 0 9 0 0 should be maintained.■ — *,defended,,«*«« A n Strategic considerations constitute an effective As justification whicli the two parties can use for insisting on and accepting requirements regarding management and materials, tut you should he careful to avoid any language that could he construed as increasing or defining our strategic obligations, (See Colonel Adams remarks on page 5 of enclosure in my despatch No 0 419 (of June 18th), Finance is regarded as a secondary consideration, and if the other desiderata can he obtained by any a o ate rent of price, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to go to very considerable lengths. As regards the figuie of £650,000 you can point out that His Majesty's Goverrmenihs present rights are to preference stock as laid down in 1930 Agreement, and that they are prepared to surrender these rights for a relatively small cash equivalent.

In the first place Iraqi Government should he reminded that the provisions regarding railv/ays contained in financial agreement attached to 1950 Agreement xemain binding on both parties. His Majesty’s Government do not accept Iraqi Government’s contention that arrangements for future of railways provided for therein are impracticable and unworkable, and are still prepared to pro ceed with them. In view however of the Iraqi Government’s objections and of the mutual obligations and interests of the two Governments which of themselves render desirable a settlement of the future of the Railways without further delay, His Majesty s Government, in furtherance of their desire to assist the Iraqi Government to the utmost extent consistent with their own obligations and interests are prepared to agree to the following alternative arrangement which they now propose to the Iraqi Government. The latter will appreciate that if this alternative arrangement is not acceptable, at any rate in principle, the arrangements agreed to in 1950 will necessarily stand until they are superseded. Alternative arrangement which His Majesty’s Government propose is that on its entry into force, Iraqi Government should be placed in absolute possession of existing railways as a going concern, i.e. including all railway land, reserve and renewal funds, debts and credits of v/hatever nature, and that in return Iraqi Government shouldo o should (1) undertitlce- in writing e.g. in an e^c.ho.nge of no- that for a period of 30 years the railway shall be managed by a mixed nnglo-Iraqi Board appointed oy L-aql «ovex»i...ent that the General ilanagership and a limited number of key posts requiring technical knowledge and experience will be reserved for British subjects, and also that such other Kon-Iraqi personnel as may be required for the railways will, as is provided in the third exchange of notes attached to the 1900 i’reaty, be recruited from among British subjects, provided suitable candidates are available (2) make to Eis Majesty’s Government an immediate cash payment of £650.000 and (5) assume responsibility ior any liabilities connected with the railways waxen have arx^en or which may arise in furiire.

(No. 304 E.) ^i r &gt; Bagdad, June 5, 1935. WITH reference to Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes’s despatch Ncl 6_31 of the 27th October, 1934, I have the honour to submit the following brief report upon the working of the Iraqi railways during the financial year ended the 31st March, 1935. 2. I enclose herewith the following statements of receipts and expenditure for the year under review :— (a) The revenue account, which gives details of the receipts and expenditure during the year.^) (b) The net revenue account covering sundry receipts and payments not arising directly from the working of the railways. These are accom panied by an appropriation account, a capital account and a general balance-sheet of the entire railway system, showing the position on the 31st March, 1935. All figures are given in Iraqi dinars, which may equally be read as pounds sterling^ 1 ) 3. Revenue receipts totalled I.D. 572,107, which exceeded the estimated figure by I.U. 70,107. Earnings in the previous year had been I.D. 524,037. Expenditure stood at I.D. 512,714—an excess of I.D. 11,854 over the estimate of I.D. 500,860. 4. The revenue surplus on the year’s operations was I.D. 59,392, against the very modest estimate of I.D. 1,140. This amount is the net surplus after provision for depreciation and renewals has been made. 5. The increase in revenue over the previous year was derived mainly from passenger receipts and freight of the “ other goods ” class. Third-class passenger receipts were higher than anticipated and stood at I.D. 12,000 more than in the year 1933-34, wTich, as a result of lower fares, showed a considerable advance on previous results. General imports showed little change, although a retrogression in this section had been expected. Receipts from this source were actually I.D. 40,000 above the estimate. Receipts from the carriage of agricultural produce and petroleum products were higher by some I.D. 20,000. This was due to a relatively good grain season, which, coupled with favourable barley prices, led to a considerable volume of export trade. The movement of oil products was well maintained, and consignments to Northern Persia by the Rowanduz route improved. Owing to the construction of the new Anglo-Persian Oil Company refinery at Kermanshah, the movement of petroleum via Khanaqin is likely to cease during the present year. To some extent, however, this will be offset by the development of the traffic via Rowanduz, but it is as yet impossible to say whether the new outlet will compare with that by the Khanaqin-Kermanshah route. 6. Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes’s despatch under reference contained the sentence : “As in previous years, the profit made by the railways is attributable to good fortune in obtaining a heavy volume of traffic of a special and temporary nature.” In the year 1934-35 this was perhaps less true than in previous years. Imports of material for Dhibban and for the new refinery at Kermanshati did contribute to its profits, but to a less extent than the very large Iraq Petroleum Company importations of previous years. The continued increase in passenger receipts is a genuine improvement, and though agricultural produce is a rather wayward factor, it is a legitimate one on which to count in a predominantly agricultural country. In the future one outlet for the oil-transit traffic will inevitably close, but another, involving a longer haul, may well be developed. In the circumstances, while it would probably be unfair to the railways to consider that the whole of their surplus was fortuitous, the future cannot, in my opinion, be predicted with any certainty. 7.

I cannot say vmat is lii:ely to be reaction ol Iraqi sover.raent but the lolloping considerations occur. to me. 1 . If railways are not now a wasting asset tney may soon become so if earning capacity is reduced from the present level which just enables them to pay their way and which has recently depended mainly on freights for Dhibban/pipe line material for Iraq petroleum Company and high rates for transport of oil products which at any time may have to be reduced as a result of pressure of public opinion* 2 . If therefore railways are not lihely to prove a going concern purchase as suggested may not be particularly attractive to the Iraqi government who will wish to know ’whether figure named is or is not based on revenue earning capacity, mven tnougn oney desire to secure ownership ox system, it m^ay pay tij-^m to adopt Fabian tactics. 3 . If however there are reasonable prospects that railways will pay their way during the whole treaty ... ——f A|45 4 treat 3 ^ period Iraqi government may agree to annual payments tub they nay claim that these should he earned hy railv/ays vrhich are already in debt to them to the extent of £340,000, But as it seems unlikely that railways will make a nett profit of £50,000 a year proposed rate of interest of 5% appears too high. 4. In any case we must anticipate bargaining over figures for in reality system is at present of doubtful economic or commercial value. It's main value is strategical (although this is now somewhat diminished by abandonment of Haifa scheme) and it is this strategical consideration which could throughout be stressed with most prospect of success as main, if not the only ground for attaching conditions to sale, and therefore as regards point 2 of 3 /our telegram best method of approach in order to secure acceptance of Iraqi government would probably be to insist that in case of war rapid replacements and efficient running of railways built to British specification could not be accomplished unless proposed condition is accepted. Generally speaking making many conditions is to be deprecatedo 5o As regards point 3 of your telegram value of properties taken over from Bagdad Bailway by British forces was assessed in 1922 at £120,000. If and when claim is made it would lie against owners of Iraqi railway system. I understand figure of assessment is capable of adjustment and if as I presume this is chief liability anticipated no undue difficulty should arise 0COFY (E 8926/163/93) Xi.lt OHTaHT, x 7 p, q FORM SB OFFICE, 3. *7.1 935 ( E5th May # 1935&lt; Sir t The The I aiu directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to invite a reference to Foreign Office letter No.E 705/163/93 of the 1st February, and to connected correspondence in regard to the future of the Irci^i rwilnaye. 2. As the Air Council are the Army Council are Olhe Lords ooi^gBypnerB of Hie Majesty^ Treasury are Secrettry Sir Philip bunli^fe-iiater is av:are, His Isla^esty^ Government have decided that the settlement of this question should now be sought independently of that of the proposed Haifa-Bagdad railway. In the light of this decision, the Secretory of State has hcd under consideration the general lines on which an agreement regarding the railways could be made with the Iraqi Government, He has reached the conclusion that the only solution of the question which will be acceptable to the Iraqi Government will be one providing for the transfer to them of full ownership of the railways. If, as seems to Sir John Simon to be the case, there is no alternative to accepting such a solution, the fundamental question which presents itself is that of the terms on ?jhich transfer of possession should be made, 3 C On paper the interest of His Majesty^ Government in the Iraqi railways is a large one, and it seems clear that the terms for the transfer of the railways to the Iraqi Government must / Secretary of the Air Ministry. Under-Secretary of State, War Office, The Secretary to the Treasury. The Under-Secretary of State, Colonial Office.1 4-2 must in any case include the payment by that Government to Hie Majesty’s Government of a substantial amount. As the result of detailed study of the correspondence relating to the Iraqi railways, Sir John Simon considers that His Majesty’s Government should aim at securing the payment of at least £500,000 in cash in return for the transfer of the rail T .vaySc But, while considering that this is the sum which His Majesty’s Gov rnment should seeh to secure as a minimum, he would suggest that the initial request to the Iraqi Government should be on the basis of a cash payment of £650,000. 4. A very material consideration is, however, the necessity, from the point of view of strategic requirements, of doing everything possible to ensure that the Iraqi railways are efficiently run in the future. With this end in view, it seems desirable that the Iraqi Government should be induced to pay whatever sum may be agreed upon not in a signle lump sum payment, but in the shape of annual payments spread over a period of years. Such a period could conveniently be limited to twenty years, whioh would ensure the completion of the purchase before the normal expiration in 1957 of the Anglo -Iraqi Treaty of Alliance of 1930. In this event, it would seem reasonable to seek to obtain from the Iraqi Government the payment of twenty annual instalments, each of £50,000. It is understood that the present value of a total sum of £1,000,000, if paid in equal instalments over a period of twenty years with interest calculated at 5&gt; : i, is approximately £625,000. 5. Should an arrangement on these lines be acceptable to the Iraqi Government, His Majesty’s Government could legitimately claim that, pending the final liquidation of their debt, the Iraqi Government should agree to the Lianager of the Iraqi railways being a British subject, or if not, someone/mmm someone appointed by Hie Majesty’s Government and the Iraqi Government in agreement* that any non-Iraqi railway staff should be British; and that all non-Iraqi material required by the railways should be purchased from the United Kingdom* Sir John Simon feels that the acoeptanoe of these terms by the Iraqi Government vould provide as adequate a guarantee as is likely to be obtainable in present circumstances against the deterioration of tne Iraqi railways during the validity of the 19hO Treaty of Alliance^ 6. The Secretary of State is further of the opinion that, in the event of full ownership of the Iraqi railways being transferred to the ira^i Government, the latter should undertake to assume responsibility for any liabilities regarding the railways vjhioh may arise subsequent to the transfer. In this connexion he has in mind more particularly the possibility of the Bagdad Railway Company’s lodging a claim for compensation in respect of the section of the Bagdad railway constructed by the Company in Iraq before the war. The possibility of such a claim being made was discussed in the second enclosure in foreign Office letter BOoE 6043/5774/89 of the 11th January, 1933, referred to above* 7„ Briefly, therefore, the proposals which the Secretary of State has in mind, and which he would suggest 9 subject to the concurrence of the interested departments, that His Majesty’s Ambassador Bagdad should put to the Iraqi Government, are that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to transfer to the Iraqi Government full possession of the Iraqi railways on the following conditions: (l) that the Iraqi Government should make to His Majesty J s Government twenty annual payments of £50,000, (2) that throughout this period (a) the General Manager of the Iraqi railways should be a British subject, (b) all/150 /S' (b) all non-Iraqi railway personnel should be British subjects, (o) all railway materials required from abroad should be purchased in the United Kingdoms and (5) that the Iraqi Government should assume responsibility for any liabilities regarding the railways which may arise in the future, 8, In recent months members of the Iracji Government have frequently represented to His Majesty^ Ambassador at Bagdad their desire for an early settlement of the question of the Iraqi railways. Moreover, Sir John Simon is of opinion that it is in the general interest of His Majesty’s Government that such a settlement should be reached without delay. It is therefore his desire that Sir Archibald Clark Xerr should be in a position to enter upon negotiations with the Iraqi Gov. rnment in the near future, and with this end in view he suggests that the question of the railways and the general lines of the agreement concerning them to be sought with the Iraqi Government should be discussed by the representatives of the departments chiefly concerned at an interdepartmental meeting. I am to suggest that such a meeting be held at the Foreign Office on Thursday, the 6th June, at o.SO p.m,, and I am to express the hope that the the the Sir Ai.?- may see their Army Council tlieTr lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury tlleir Philip 0 uni iff e -Lis ter ** hf^ way to delegate a representative or representatives to attend. Sir John Simon has thought it desirable that the suggested meeting should be in possession of the general observations o± His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad on the suggested terms of/of settlement summarised in paragraph 7 above, and he has accordingly sent to L&gt;ir Archibald Olurk £err the telegram a copy of which is enclosed. 9, Similar letters are being sent to the V/nr Office, the Treasury and the Colonial Office and Air Ministry, the Treasury and the Colonial 6ffice Air Ministry, the T-qr Office and The Colonial Off ice Ai r Minis t ry, the Vd r Of ii c e and the 'Treasury copies of this letter are being sent to the India Office, Admiralty, Department of Overseas Trade, Board of Trade and Committee of Imperial Defence.

Mr. Ogilvie-Forbes to Sir John Simon.—(Received November 12.) ho (No. 631.) Sir, Bagdad, October 27. 1934. I HAVE the honour to submit the following brief report upon the financial operations of the Iraqi railways for the year which ended on the 31st March. 1934. The report for the preceding financial year is contained in my despatch N o. 53 7 of the 19th August, 1933 :— 2. The undernoted classified statements of receipts and expenditure for the year accompany this despatch : — (a) The revenue account, which gives full details of the receipts and expenditure during the year,!} 1 ) and (b) The net revenue account, which disposes of sundry receipts and expenditure which are not the direct result of railway working^ 1 ) In support of these is an account of capital appropriations and a balance sheet of the whole railway system as at the 31st March, 1934.(') The figures given in the accounts are in Iraqi dinars, but can equally be read as representing pounds sterling. 3. Revenue receipts during the year amounted to I.D. 524,037, as compared with the figure of I.D. 493,500 shown in the sanctioned estimates, an improvement of I.D. 30,537. The normal expenditure during the year totalled I.D. 491,985, an excess of I.D. 2.235 over the sanctioned estimate of I.D. 489,750. 4. The revenue surplus on the whole year was I.D. 32,051, which is a substantial and welcome improvement on the estimated surplus of I.D. 3,750. This result has been achieved after full provision has been made for depreciation and renewal charges. 5. The volume of traffic during the year was greater than had been antici pated. Third-class passenger traffic, encouraged by the reductions in fares, again substantially increased, 337,000 more tickets being issued during the year than during the previous year. Upper-class receipts continued to diminish despite experiments in the way of reduced fares. The large surplus has, however, been derived almost entirely from the carriage of imported goods. The movement of grain failed almost completely as a source of freight revenue and the quantity moved during the year was the lowest on record. The quantities of other local produce moved were also very low and had there not been a heavy flow of imported goods the revenue picture would have been a gloomy one. 6. Two main factors contributed to the heavy volume of general imports carried by the railways. Persian transit trade revived temporarily because of the strained nature of Russo-Persian trade relations, although it is to be feared tha,t this improvement is transient. The transfer of oil by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company from Southern to Northern Persia through Iraq proved to be lucrative traffic, and no less than 38,000 tons of oil were so moved, for which the company paid the railways I.D. 53,379 in freight and other charges. A further large quantity of pipe-line materials was carried for the Iraq Petroleum Company. As in preceding years, therefore, the profit made by the railways is attributable to good fortune in obtaining a heavy volume of traffic of a special and temporary nature. 7. Although the volume of superior passenger traffic in Iraq is steadily diminishing, there was a considerable increase in the receipts and the profits derived from the Iraqi portion of the Simplon Orient Express Service. This [256 m—1] O Not printed.result was also achieved by reducing the scale of charges, which had ceased to be attractive since the fall in value of sterling. 8. The net balance of surplus revenue, which is brought up to the sum of I.D. 34,876 by the addition of revenue derived from operations not directly the result of railway working, as shown in the “Net Revenue Account,' has been allocated entirely to the reserve account. 9. Full provision for depreciation has been charged in the accounts under ^ the heading of ‘ ‘ Renewals, Replacements and Betterments, 5 ' and a sum of I.D. 72,763 was transferred to that fund during the year. The actual expenditure during the year from the fund was I.D. 23,361. 10. The cost of capital works during the year was restricted to a net amount of I.D. 296, of which I.D. 237 was spent upon the construction of a rest-house at Dglat on the Nisibin route. Some details of this work are given in paragraph 2 (a) of my despatch No. 518 of the 10th August, 1933, and the expenditure was authorised in your despatch No. 578 of the 14th September, 1933. The small balance remaining represents the additional amount paid for a plot of land in the circumstances described in my despatch No. 91 dated the 13th February, 1934, less a small amount recovered on land account in another connexion. The expenditure on capital account has, as is customary, been met by the transfer from reserve of an equal amount. 11. The capital account shows a debit balance of I.D. 27,668, which is the same as at the end of the previous financial year. The balance is being left over for adjustment when the balance sheet is recast on the formation of the Railway Corporation. 12. Two accounts adjustments call for special mention in connexion with the main balance sheet :— (a) A sum of I.D. 47,828 has been shown in previous balance sheets as a credit suspense item representing the value of serviceable railway material recovered from the Baiji-Shergat section of the line when that portion was dismantled. The purpose of creating a special suspense item for this credit was that the material and the credit would be available for use when the projected Kirkuk-Mosul extension was put in hand. This project shows no signs of materialising in the near future and there is no reason for maintaining the credit as a separate item. It has therefore been absorbed into the general reserve account. (b) The amount to the credit of the reserve account has been reduced by a sum of I.D. 47,678 on account of obsolescence of stores on hand. This is due to the fact that on the transfer of the railway from military to civil control a large quantity of stores was taken over at a valuation far in excess of their market worth to-day, and many of them were of a standard which would not be acceptable as first-class stores now. A committee of railway officers examined these stores with the object of revaluing them so that the prices at which they are carried in* the stores account should bear a closer resemblance to their true value. The committee recommended that the stores should be written down to the extent of I.D. 47,678, and, as the obsolescence has occurred over a period of years, this amount has, pending the sanction of the Iraqi Government, been charged against the reserve built up from revenue surplusage. The adjustments at (a) and (b) practically cancel one another out as far as the figure of general reserve is concerned. 13, The railways were in an even better financial position on the 1st April, 1934, than they were a year earlier. The balance sheet, although it takes no account of the capital outlay on the system or of the present value of the assets, shows that the railways are more than solvent. There is a liquid reserve fund of I.D. 71,293, and the fund for renewals is in credit to the extent of I.D. 190,096. Full provision has been made for the balance on the liquidation account due to His Majesty's Government of I.D. 185,820, which is due to be capitalised under the Railway Corporation proposals and constitutes a hidden reserve. Cash balances are substantial and total I.D. 285,804, while the value of stores on hand, written down as described above, is I.D. 131,375. Despite the peculiar adminis trative difficulties under which the Directorate labours in controlling, as a quasi-3 Government Department, a system which is the property of another Government, and the severe financial restrictions imposed by having no funds available for capital developments other than by the appropriation of fortuitous revenue surpluse 8 , the railways can still be considered as a valuable Imperial asset 14.

The file opens with a small amount of correspondence regarding the decision to dispense with the services of Edward Ralph Perry, the Agent of the Iraqi Railways in Bombay, and also to appoint Mr A Rawlinson to the position of Iraqi Railways Agent to England.The majority of the file consists of correspondence between the Foreign Office, HM Ambassador to Iraq, and the Government of Iraq, concerning the sale of the Iraqi Railways to the Government of Iraq. The correspondence discusses: the economic viability and strategic value of the railway; the need to ensure its effective future running; the retention of key posts for British personnel under new arrangements; and the establishment of a joint Anglo-Iraqi management board. A draft agreement written by HMG can be found at folios 76-86, with extensive comments by George William Rendel of the Foreign Office, at folios 61-75. A copy of the final agreement, plus notes exchanged between HM Ambassador to Iraq (Arthur Clerk Kerr) and the Iraqi PM (Nuri Said Pasha) can be found at folios 15-26.The file also contains material regarding a proposal by the British Oil Development Company to construct a line from their oil fields at Qasab to the existing rail system at Tel Kotchek [Al Ya'rubīyah], and also a proposed contact for the southern line from Qaiyara [Al Qayyārah] to Baiji.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is found at the end of the correspondence (folio 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Oil Development Company</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Railways</topic></subject><subject><topic>Railway construction</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Iraq</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x00019a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
