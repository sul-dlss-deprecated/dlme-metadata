The asiJect of comparative prosperity and spaciousness which a few good buildings, avenues and gardens confer upon the town is belied by the ?/BGtohed condition of the bazaar. -‘■he little bread available costs 6 rials per kilo. The better off inhabitants have stocks of wheat which they keep intact by drawing bread from the bakeries which reduces the amount avail able for the poor. However, the latter havo rarely been able during recent years to obtain bread regularly and have become accustomei to a diet of dates and fish. The supply of dates is dwindling as tbe date season recedes but fish is plentiful and comparatively cheap. °*lnoe 1939 even fish is dearer with $he opening of the fish Canning Factory. 3. Locusts are still on sale at 3 rials per Kilo but the supply is running short and vigorous anti-locust measures in this area appear to be prejudicing future supplies of at least one foodstuff which has not yet been cornered. 4. The official source of fi pply of wheat is Bushire wh^re the Finance Department %llots periodically small quan- ! Vv • v 16 500 which arrived from Bushire in early February is running short. The licensed bakers have sold a lair amount of io to the highest bidder instead of to the n U b- i.i the form of bread and at a fixed price. H.

Yesd merchants in particular have been buy ing large quantities of tea and sugar nonchalantly instructing ^ their agents to buy # at current rate*. 7. Transport . Transport is short owing to the complite breakdown in traffic between Bandar \bbas and Kerman during the second half of February. This was caused by the exceptionally heavy rain. Yerchanto are competing violently for available transport. The effect of the new transport monopoly on the situation is being' studied anxiously by merchants. The fixed lower rate should tend to attraot traffic to the routes whore lorry owners will be prepared to pay highly to monopoly officials to obtain prof itable loads and a q[uiok turn round on the easier roads which will be less exacting on their lorries and tyros. On the othef £and$ merchants off the most profitable routes who are will- to pay for allotment or transport will no doubt sc ure it.

On 17th March the stock of wheat held by the Food department (vide para. 2 of diary for lst-l5ih March) ran * short and thereafter the bakeries supplied small quantities of bread made from wheat obtained from casual sources. Only one bakery, a 'free' one owned by an x ndian British subject, supplied bread in any Quantity and this was barley bread. Though intended to benefit the poor anej. sold at the price of 2 rials io shahis per kilo there l 'mSiy of the stronger and more vociferous coolies of the town who won more than their ahare and sold it at a profit to those who could not afford to stand all day outside the bakery. 3. The dwindling stocks of dates in the hands of the Food Department are being carefully conserved, a small £iSS§, a M§H&amp;S 1 B£eg# d 4*tiy6&amp;i tfijFsi&amp;fiy is negligible in compax'ison with the demand. 4. The Food Department withold wile supply of tea and matches to the public from 22nd Febraury to 2ist March (the month of island) owing wo the non-arrival of instructions from Tenran. Due to shortage of transport no cigareote^s have arrived for some ^oeks and the price has doubled to rials five per packet. 5 5. A committee of local officials and landlords met on 17th March to discuss whether the Government*a offer to supply seed 'Zur.rat' could be utilised.

Speculation in tea and sugnr contijiuec, the price of sugar per 2 cwt bag fluotuating from 570 to 600 tomans and that of tea from li to 14 tomans per kilo. Rumours that special powers wore to be granted bo the American Financial -dviscr have not yet had a lowering effect on market prices. Trade and Shipping 8. Three B.I. steamers called during the fortnight, one arriving from Indir. uni tiio from Basra. The majority of trade (which is almost entirely import) continues to be carried in country craft. Public Healtii 9. There has be n much sickness and a comparatively large number of deaths in the town. Unfortunately local medical opinion differs as to the cause of the deaths. The local medical officer asserts that the deaths are due partly to the food shortage and partly to the unseasonably cool weather which together have caused a large number of the poorer people to go bown with a severe type of influ enza. The doctor attached to the Persian Garrison consid ers that many of the deaths are due to both typhus and ty phoid. His opinion is shared by the Indian doctor attached to ohis Uonsulate. H.i^s Consul has attempted to persuade the local authorities to organise proper diagnosis of the urevailing illnesses, to see that the local hospital^ is used to capacity and to pay particular attention to impro ving sanitary measures in the Khunji Cotton Spinning Mill where there has been a great deal of sickness and a number of deaths. F.H f s Consul has inspected v.he local hosnital at tne invitation of the local meaical offerer. General tO. Tith the visit of the Public Relations Bureau cinema van performances were u.iven every night for a fort night in Bandar Abbas and neighbourhood. xhis was the first occasion on which a cinema performance had been given in Bandar Abbas. Th^ “season' opened with a reception at / the Consulate3 - the Consulate on the evu or Naurut'. to which eighty of the leading officials and merchants were in/ited and which (unllka some similar occasions in the p^st) all the guests invited attended. The films which, with the help of films loaned iro,a the cinena van at Puchire, were shown in the proportion of one Mickey Mouse or cartoon film to each news reel, were much appreciated. Apart from nightly shows held in the town special performances were also arranged fcrr the officers and men of the local garrison, the employ- cos of the O-ovornment Fish Hanning Factory and local school- children. The state of the roads unfortunately did not permit the van to visit ? inah (the only other town of impor tance accessible by mofror road) but the van on its return journey to Kerman ^ill five performances at the main villages en route.

Tribal and Politioal Oolonel ToomaJ, 0.0. Gendarmerie, Kerman, Servan Assadull&amp;h z&amp;deh and Aqal Ibrahim Gellahdary returned on 16th April from the negotiations with Ali Jalal at Minab. (Vide paragraph 5 of diary for iat-i5th April.) Shaikh AbMullah Gellahdary who was one of the prime movers in arranging for a-rapproaohement with Ali Jalal visited His Majesty 9 s Oonsul after the return of the negotiators and reported the various steps whioh preceded the initiation of negotiations as well as the terms of settlement. It is reported that Ali Jalal has delivered 30 of his 90 rifles to the Gendarmerie and the remaining have been kept for sixty of his men who have agreed to enter the Gendarmerie. They will be stationed at different vil lages in their own areaof Blab an. Oolonel ToomaJ and Lieutenant Oolonel 3ehqi, o.O. Troops, Minab. have both as sured Ali Jalal that in future neither the military nor the Gendarmerie will give him cause for complaint. Ali Jalal for his part has promised to lead a peaceful life and look after his properties.- 2 - ®) It remains to 'be seen how long this agreement will last. It is something that all parties, except Hohim Khan fiudhari, took part in it and it may last some time. But there is no real confidence on either side and the old Gendarmerie-military rivalry and local intrigue, both of them the product of rapacity,| may soon produce dis sensions. However, Shaikh Abdullah Oellahdary whose in terest in the negotiations is that of a prospeotive candi date for the Vajlis anxious to show talentas a negotiator as well as that of a wealthy landlord interested in secur ity in the Vinab area, was congratulated by His Majesty f s Consul on what was probably on his part at least a sincere attempt at settlement. 4. Settlement is in the fcir. S^rvan Paroham, 0.0. Gendarmerie, Bandar Abbas, left for Keshar on the 16th April to meet Mustafa Lashkari, a petty brigand, and return ed to Bandar Abbas, after a short period of negotiations befitting Mustafa^ stature, on the 17th. According to Servan Paroham Mustafa Lashkari and his 16 followers have also agreed to Join the Gendarmerie and wear the notorious blue uniform. 5. Anti-locust aampalgn The campaign against hoppers by the poison bait and other methods continued to be very active. The R.a.F. dusting plane was utilised to carry out a number of suot oessful eiperiments with various insecticides against hop* pars and young flying locusts. Much useful information was obtained. In the more accessible areas destruction of hop* pers is fairly complete but it is feared that in the more difficult country numbers of hoppers have been able to escape. damage to crops has however been negligible. 6. Security On 20th April a dhow suspected of piracy was captured by a British naval patrol vessel 15 miles south west of Jask. On board were found 12 rifles, 586 rounds ammunition in belts, spare rifle springs, and rifle repair ing tools. The dhow was brought to Bandar Abbas. After an inquiry in the naval vessel concerned attended by His Majesty's Consul the dhow and captives were handed over to the Persian Gendarmerie. It transpired that two of these captured were the notorious Hussein bin Morad and his brother Abdul Rahman bin Morad. x he trial is expected to begin shortly and the prosecution is not likely to be short of material. 7. Public Health A committee of offioals and raerohants met in tib© ^overnorate on 24th April to discuss measures for the relief of siokness in the town. The Governor and mer chants sent telegrams to Tehran requesting the sending of ^xtn doctors and 15,000 anti—typhus ic^ection ampoules The decision to send for anti-typhus injections was made without the local medical officer (who is merely a promoted compounder) having given a clear decision that / the■■■■ ■ S) (5) malady from whloh the local people were generally aufferr ing was typhus. In order to put a stop to the Giltoart- lan situation in whioh the Governor and notables were sending telegrams to Tehran reouesting injections for a disease which the local medical officer refused to admit to he the prevailing illness. His Majesty*s CJonsul arrang ed for test diagnoses to he made hy a Qomjntttee of doctors composed of the local medical officer, one other looal doctor and the British Medical Officer attached to the Anti-Locust ^light. After seeing a number of oases the loo&amp;l medical officer appeared finally to ddmlt that he was required to deal with a typhus and not a typhoid or influenza epidem- ic. Next day, however, to allow perhaps his independence! he forbade the sale of vegetables and fruit in the bazaar owing, allegedly, to the typhoid epidemic in the town. Little more notice is now taicen of him, however, and the committe^has arranged for a new hut village to be built outside the town in order to isolate and treat the slok who are given new clothes. This is a good move provided there are effective washing arrangements. His Majesty*8 Consul and the H.A.T. Medical Officer inspected the new quarters. 8. Transport The transport problem has been rendered even more difficult by the large supplies of foodstuffs brought in this fortnight together with the ^00 tons of bitumen which is being taicen to Kerman for the C.B. 8*s department. It is perhaps unfair to blame the Iranian authorities too much for the fact that there were only 6ne or two trucks in Bamdar Abbas when the foodstuffs arrived though a fair number of trucks had been going up the road in the preceding few days loaded with merchants * cargoes. There were still one or two of these going even after the foodstuffs arrived and in spite of the fact that priority had been ordered to be given to zurrat and barley. His Majesty*s J onsul has tried to bring pressure to bear in this matter. In the main the orders to give loading priority to foodstuffs have been carried out. But stricter and more unified control of transport than at present exists is desirable. Maximum (B8th) 103 avorage 95.4 Minimum ( 16th) 68 average 79.5 Rainfall nil. (Sd) T. K. Rogers.

This is probably largely due to the hot weather which is unfavourable to lice because of the heat gas well as the fact that the poorer people bathe more and wear less clothes. •‘•he measures reported in the two preceding diaries taken to organise an ♦isolation* village and im prove sanitary conditions in the cotton factory and in ihe town have however had some share in the improved situation. 6 • A nti-locust Campaign Anti-locust operations are now at an end in the area and the various experts have left hot foot for Kerman en route uo the tiabui area where the unexpected phenomenon of a second breeding in the same year has brought about a serious situation* An d.

Li^en Noar ^ decoyed town of only four or fire thou sand inhabitants Lingeh still hears the stamp of its for mer prosperity in the hugs, mas give- doored, derelict houses of its former merchant princes who escaped from Lingers eclipse to Bombay, nihai or Bahrain. fhe long Ar^h connection is still ovident. Thera is the tutfble- down fort of the irah Shaikhs who ruled it within the last hundred years. '-he merchants and people speak Arabic as readily as Persian and still keep irabio time. For all the signs of decay the bazaar compared very favourably with that of Bandar ^bbas for rice, dates, broad and foodstuffs generally. Piocegoods was the main exception. Prices of all commodities were about the same high level as in Bandar Abbas. Ihe barley bread sold from seven municipal bakeries wan poor but plentiful. Two 'free* bakeries were also selling a good wheat bread at a high price to poor-looking buyers which seems to show that there is money in the town. It might well also show that poor people flnli.ig clothes har£ to buy are spending more money on food. ills hajjesty*s Consul called on the Bakshdar and mc^t some of the leading merchants including members of the allegedly pro-Axis 'aadi family. TTis Uajesty's '■'on&amp;ul visited the new and the old aerodromes and Kung, a small port near Lingeh whioh rose as Ling eh declined because, it is of its free dom from the trade and other restrictions whioh stifled ling eh. Though Kung he.s grown tc almost t3io size of Lingeh it prides itself on having kept free from the oppressive attentions of Oovemiaent officials. 'lse» where villages of the same size are staffed with perhaps ten representatives of the different C-oveminent depart ments. TTise Kung contents itself with two, carrying its phobia of bureaucracy to the point of doing without a school, ich would entail the presence of one Govern ment official the more. Self-reliant Kung is largely self-sufficient, its seafaring popitiAtion bringing in their requirements from as far as A^an and ^ast Africa, the fbirtheras lim its of the prosperous carrying tads engaged in by the perhaps eighty boafra owned locally. 10 • J ask At Jask His Majesty’s 0 o naul found in conver* sation with a number of officials and others that the recent capture of Hussein bin Morad by a naval patrol vessel halt had an excellent effect. Mirza bin Birkat, who is doubly related to Hussein (they having married each other's sister) is probably thinking that he himself lid well to take to peaceful ways again oven though the pa ments due to him (see paragraph 15 of diazy for 1st - 15th March) are badly in arrears and far from munifioi- ent. Hussein bin Morad about a fortnight before his capture had met both the 0.0. Jask ^arrison and the 0.0. / GendarmerieOend&amp;rmeria .Tgj&lt;9 and had 'been advised to follow Mir- fia # 3 example ^nd mak^ his paace with tho dovernraent• Hiraa wlso had atterdod the meotir^ and had “been asked to hring presspjro to hear on Hussain. But the latter hadj^ given evasive answers and bent only two rifles to the 0.3. Garrison. one report says he sent no more heoaus-s he had not received a promised written guarantee of his safety. Then captured he carried lectors from the 0 . 0 . Oarrison auking him to deliver up a proportion of his rifles. Kis Majesty’s Oonsul called on the new Bakshdar (who had just oompleted an interestIn^ if arduous Journey hy o am el across Mahan from Bandar dbhaa via ^inah), the 0.3.

Aq.ai £rdashir Vafudar, representative of the Barbari Bali, left for x whran on 30th May. 2. x-uod Cjouation The stock of flour of the Food department, Ban dar Abbas, ran out towards the end of' the month and the supply of' flour to the bakeries was discontinued. ^he military and the Gendarmerie pressed the food Department for flour and wheat, representing that they were having great difficulty in feeding their men. The Governor held a committee at which it was decided that a portion of the flour consigned for Kerman be used to meet local require ments and replaced later. from 3ist Fay flour was again supplied to the bakeries and bread sold at rials 3 per kilo, the flcwr being of a superior quality to that prev iously supplied at rials 2.50. No dates are being sold to the public by the Food department. The price of dates has reached rials 6 per kilo. 3. Public Health Although the town is not ye^t clear of typhoid and typhus the general condition is much improved. Some cases of these diseases have also been reported from sur rounding villages. Throughout the recent epidemic the services of the Consulate Indian doctor have frequently been in demand and appreciated. Properly he should not / treat[treat patia&amp;ts in the town 'but only at the Oonaulate dispensary. However # the Goremor hiiasi^r requested that his Berrioss should he made avsdlahle and it has leeu arranged. all calls for him will he made through (the Governor. ^ 4.

There have hson soma oowplaints from dri- vers of lorries who hare oontraoted to carry foodstuffs for the Government that thocr have not received their dues, for which they have heea told by the transport department in Koman to ax&gt;jly to ^elirm. -*110 drivers are, of course, vociferously in favour of 'free* transport arrangement which would he moro profitaoi© to tlioa. It i* fcrvie that merchants are so eager in Bandar ^bhas to secure transport that thiij are prepared to pay very high rates to attract more lorriou. The deputy for Bandar Ah has, Aq.ai Haji Kuahir, h&amp;c. h »ar appointed Bandar Alhos agont for the VI1 ard trans- port o^wapany. 5. Pinaij oial Before the Hlllspaygh order 'freusing 4 goods in Oustonu was announced, most of the merchants appeared to hayo liad prior information and wore able to clear nearly all valuable goods, especially sugar, from tiir Oustosa. •‘.he ''hag* 1 of the Cfustcms Department was rathar d la appoint ing. Tlie market at present is at a standstill and the merchants aro anxiously awaiting clarification of the new regulations. 6 * Trioal and Political Sax-wan Pax-oham, 0.0. Gendarmerie, Bandar IBhas, visited Minah ( ride paragraph 1 (h) ahove) in order to discuss Vith ^Xi. Jalal details of the enroluient of the lattcr # a men in the G*niaraeri*. Whether tlX Jalal took fright at tha Impressive array of ^aadar Ahhas officials, including H # M # s ^onaul, gathex-ed together at Minah towards the end of the month, is not dear, hut he did not come forward from his prooent retreat some twelve miles away and ^arwan Par wham had to return to Bandar Ah'oas with only a routine inspection of the Minah Gsndaxmerie and an (almost equally routine) oautianing of the 0 . 0 . Gendami- erie, Minah, for his over oonoom VAth trade to his credit. Another reason for Ali Jalal # s shyness may have heea that rapacity forecasted as a possible ostuse of fric tion in paragraph 3 of diary for leth-bist April, 1943. It was reported by more than one res^Goaible person at Minab that Ali Jalal had been obliged to present the special officer depuwed by the Genex*al Offioex* ^nmia ^»nri^ ng, Kerman, to negotiate with him, Lieutenant-Oolonel ^shqi, withrials 1^,0C0 cash, 400 maunds wheat, b miscals gold and one Petromax lantern. The am** offloer some time ago/leaving that portion 01 All Jalai^ house which his host had set aside for him, proceeded to roll up the / carpets} M - 3 - / oarpets spread in hbk honour intending to consider them also as ^art of the hospitality offered. ^li Jalal, whose favourite oarpets they were, was so anxious to es cape the apparently natural consequences of his rash dis play of than that he is reported to have offered to pay their price to Liwmt.-Ool. Bshqi for the privilege of re taining them. The two have not met since thii incident which must he accepted as largely correct. Mirza hin Birkat has addressed a petition to H.M # s Consul complaining of the continued retention of his properties hy the Persian authorities and requesting assis tance in the redressal of his grievances. 7. Security No rohheries have heen reported hut alarming ru mours range the town concerning an almost fabulous 'child- eating animal•* (sic) which is popularly Relieved to have carried off a number of small sleeping children on whose hearts it is said to feed. A number of small children sleeping out in the open have certainly been reported missing and probably more than one wolf has been respon sible. Howards are being offered for the slaying of the monster and a wolf (whose identity as the animal conoerned is disputedfi has been shot. 6. Mlnab The road from Bandar Abbas to Minab via Sarkhan and Shamil was found to be a road in name only. The road was hastily driven through some six years ago by order of the Shah in order to pass troops through to Budan and Bashkard. It must always have been a bad road and after this year # s heavy rain is next to impassable. It is reported that even jeeps driven by a British military re- oonnaisance party took three days for this Journey. H.M^s Consul, after being held up times without number in river beds and sand and after covering only three miles on the second day, was prepared to agree with the opinion of most people he met at Minab (with the perhaps natural ex ception of the director of t he Hoad Department) that it is the worst road in the world. There is, however, a much shorter route suitable for animal transport and the mer chant or trader visiting Bandar Abbas from Minab does the journey comfortably by dtonkey in two days. Minab itself has declined in prosperity since the beginning of the new regime. Bor two or three years before owing to the 'l^amilat ^arhadi' - a dispensation by which certain small U ulf ports were -oractlcally exempt from Customs restrictions - it had been a flourishing place for imports (particularly pieoegoods) which were taken up to Keraan and also to Bandar Abbas where their import was prohibited. Tith the new xB&amp;joKS freedom of trade this profitable trade has stopjjed. However, Minab # s wealth has always lain in the surrounding date gwadens rather than in the town itself. Ihe date fcxxfltxHJt crop, the gathering of which will begin# in three weak** time. vdll be a bumper one but as gardens have been hired out at a much higher rate than last year the price will probably remain high. / Tyab- 4 - Tvat. 12 miles away at the head of the KhAr is the port of t'inah.

Food Situation The Millspaugh order 'freewing' all goods in the Customs (vide paragraph 5 of Diary for l5th-3ist May, 1943,) has resulted in the removal of quantities of food stuffs from their shops by local 'grocers' who are now hoarding stocks until the new regulations have been clari fied. An order recently received from Tehran releasing the new crop of wheat and barley in the Bandar A^bas area from Government monopoly has, h wever, eased the bread situation and the price of wheat has fallen from rials 7.50 to rials 5.00 per kilo. Small quantities of grain are now being imported to Bandar Abbas from the surround ing villages. At the close of the month, the price of a bag of sugar (100 kilos) suddenly rose £ com rials 5800.00 to rials 7 200 00rials 7200.00 2 - * Bazaar prices for essential foodstuffs &amp;c. on 1st July were as follows:-- Bread Rials per kilo. 6.00 TTheat Rials per kilo 6.00 Bice 15.00 Ghee 42.00 Sugar 65.00 Tea 144.00 Dhal (not available) - Potatoes (not available) Onions 2.00 Mutton 9.00 Beef 8.00 Butter 36.00 Milk 6.00 Firewood 0.50 Fish 4.00 Dated 4.00 Charcoal 1.50 Coffee 35.00 3. Trade and Ship-ping 3s. Wosang (B.I.) called at Bandar A'b'bas on the 26th f en route to Karachi from ‘'asra. Ss. Kweiyang (B.I.) called on the 28th, en route to Ahadan from Karachi. Neither of the al&gt;ove-mentioned vessels landed any cargo at this port hut the latter brought sea mails from India which had been held up in Karachi since the latter half of January, 1943. Trade has continued to be at a standstill apart from some business transactions in sugar during the last three days of the month. 4. Transport Motor transport has been extremely scarce and those vehicles which did arrive from Kerman returned north with Government foodstuffs. The lorry owners have been refusing to load Government consignments to their full capacity as they are not paid any advance for the purchase of petrol and oil, and in most oases a compro mise was reached whereby lorries loaded to half their capacity with Government stores and for the rest, private merchandise was carried. Merchants are said to be pay ing the following approximate prices for the transport of their goods:-- Bandar Abbas to Sirjan * to Kerman ^ to Yezd *• to Isfahan Bials 4000 per ton 6000 • 10000 • 19000 ' KM / / iw 5. Public Health The improvement in public health continues and there has been a fuller decline in the death rate. As a result of the hot weather which has now set in, a large number of locals have moved out to surrounding villages, a factor which has helped considerably to improve the health situation. 3 eourity Mention was made in paragraph 6 of -lary for 16 th-30th April, 1943, of the capture by a British naval patrol, of a gang of pirates led by the notorious Hussein bin Morad and his brother (Abdul Bahman bin Murad). The total number of individuals captured was 24, including / one3 one worn an t and they were all subsequently handed over to the local Gendarmerie who held a preliminary enquiry before referring the matter to Tehran for further orders. Instructions werieventually received from the Capital that the accused should be handed over to the Police and that they would be tried by a military court in Bandar Abbas. The Military court have recently started spasmodic hear ings of the case but the accused are still in the custody of the Gendarmerie as the Police state they cannot accomo date the prisoners, their cells already being full. The 0.0. Gendarmerie is in a quandary as he has no suitable accomodation for the prisoners, neither has he any budget allotment for their food &amp;o.--and that this is very prob ably true is reflected in the fact that out of the origin al fcfc captives three men and the woman have died in cus tody. H.M's Consul has discussed this case with the Gov ernor and other loc?il authorities concerned, and has press ed for early action in this matter. Numerous promises have been given that the case will be completed with all oossible despatch but at present there ks are no signs that the trial will be brought to a spfedy conclusion. There seems little doubt that fcfc at least 13 of the accus ed will be found guilty as the prosecuting evidence, ac cording to the original Persian investigating officer, is quite conclusive. There have been no incidents in which lorries or caravans have betan held up on the Kerman-Bandar Abbas road during the period under review. It is understood that goods to the value of rials 400 f 000 were looted by robbers in the raid on a aaravan near Tang-i-Dalan during the first half of the month (see paragraph 6 of ^iary for 1st - 15th June) and negotiations are now in progress for the return of the plunder. 7. General Now that the hot weather has started in real earnest, there has been a marked decrease in the activ ities of local officials. Appendix A to this summary contains a list of local officials in Bandar Abbas. Meteorological Maximum 112.0 (29thJ average 102.8. Minimum 74.0 (16th) average 84.0.

Bnndax Abbas Consulate Diaries for July, August, September and the first half of October. 19^-3. Points of interest in these diaries are:- 1. Pood situation. The wheat supply was precarious througliout the period but the diary for the first half of October reports^ that'the town is at present fairly well supplied with cer eals. The date crop was good inspite of damage byj^pcusts, which wete- particularly bad in the Minab area. K *£i5ates were being stored and hoarded A against a rise in prices. The price of sugar rose steadily throughout July and August, fell at the beginning of September when the Government ordered the release of goods held in the Customs, rose again,and dropped at the end of the month on the news of the allotment of a quota of sugar for Iran by the British Government. The price was still fluctuating in October. Ration tickets were issued during September but by October 15th no rations had been forth coming. 2. Transport and security on the roads. Details are given in these diaries of lorries leaving BtmdavAbbas for the inter ior and of their loads. There was a certain amount of robbery on the roads. A note on the Bunda/Abbas-Kerman road is attached to the diary for August 16th to 51st. 5. Jask. Mirza bin Barkat, notorious as a priate, smuggler and slave trader, was trying to recover his family property in the Jask area, but had met with little success at the beginning of July; he was then a member of the Jask gendamerie. The food situation in Jask was very serious owing to the failure of the Pood Department in BtJnda&lt; Abbas to/■;h r to forward consignments of flour and barley allotted to Jask and to the rapacity of local officials etc, •. The situation was eased, however, by the arrival on September 19th of a long overdue consignment of cereals from Bushire, The landing ground is protected by an Levy Company, some 120 strong, composed of Baluchis from British Mekran who have been very, well ’received locally. On the 17th September the'^wireless station re opened and started operating on the 25th September under the control of Captain Z.

Dates from the new crop are now plentiful in the bazaar. The price of sugar has risen to rials 9060.00 per bag of 100 kilos and merchants are offering to buy from owners of sugar 'frozen** in the Customs at the rate of ri^ls 6600.00 per bag. 3 . Tyado and Shipping Owing to the trade restrictions which are still in force (vide paragraph 6 of diary for l6th-3lst May, 1943) imports have been on a very small scale. The following commodities iere imported from Muscat and the Truolal Coast during the period under review:- 306 bales emrty b^gs. 40 • cotton. 4. • Jute twine. Se. Ssang arrived from Basra en route to India on the 12th and landed 10 tons of dates for the Anglo- Iranian Relief Committee, Bandar Abbas. A.I.0.0. tug Taraqgi arrived from Abadan on the 6th and discharged a consignment of lubricating oil.

(Paragraph 6 of the last diary refers.) 8. Recent arrivals by dhow from Tub oat have been spreading stories in the J&gt;oc^l bazaar of the sinking of a British ship in Muscat harbour. The faot that this news has coincided with the return of the convoys to Ban dar Abbas had lod to rumours of all sorts and speculation is rife as to the possibilities of future enemy action in the Gulf of Oman. The Allied attack on Sicily has not as yet a roused particularly wiuespreaa interest most of the looal Persians being too busy sympathising with themselves over the heat which they have to endure in Bandar Abbas to v.or y about world or war news. 9.Jask Wirza bin Barkat and his four brothers, Jalal, Jan tfohammed, Haasan and Hu sein, recently visited the village of Kahooti near Jask and parleyed with the loo d Persian Army and Tendarmerie authorities on the subject of a number of arms which the Persian Government are de manding that Jalal should surrender.

In 1932 one of the younger sons, Mirza, returned to Persia from Oman where he had taken refuge, and attempted to rooover some of hie family property. He has not, however, met with inuoh success and his territory or sphere of irifluence is limit ed to a stretch about 33 ulles long in the vicinity of Jask, where he is now a member of the Gendarmerie (para graph id of dinry for 1st-15th March, 1943, refers). it) The Persian locust officer in Jask, Ariai -&gt;ayed Ali Zand, has closed his of fice and proceeded to Bandar Abbas, The Bakhshdar of Ja k, Aqai Adhami, has also proceeded to Bandar Abbas and it is understood that he is now doing his utmost to avoid returning to his post. Both the above have arrived here accompanied by Aq&amp;i ralimpur of the A, 1.0,0. who has been transferred from Jask to Bandar Abbas. A.1.0.0. interests in Jask are now in the hands of their Agents, Sayed Mohammed dal eh &amp; dons. during the last few days of June there was a very strong smell of oil at Jask and rumours have been heard in some quarters that tl&amp;s *as cossibly due to the sinking of a tanker in th vicinity of the coast, '’ateorologisalA Maximum (1st) 112.

S. General l«ev/s of the Italian Armistice aroused consider able interest among Persians in Bandar Abbas, the main reason for the enthusiasm shown being that all consider this latest development will undoubtedly shorten the course of the war and augurs well for an early return to normal living conditions, with prices at a reasonable level. The announcement that Iran had declared war on the Axis, however, almost eclipsed the news from ^taly and the poorest classes in particular have been showing some anxiety that this move will entail widespuead con scription .and that further hardships will have to be en dured if A ran is going to give material assistance to flbhe Allies. xhe best comment on this news made by a local Persian, an Influential figure in these parts, was “God help the Japanese now that Persia is in the war', but it must be admitted that the individual spoke with his tongue in his cheek. The interpretation put on this latest move by local educated classes, is that their Government feel they will now have more ohanoe of obtaining assistance irom the British to counter itussian designs on their country.¥ - /&amp;*&gt; /&gt;?. \Hv *- / Jt9M»m B .VN :)AH ABBAH OOHMUL ATK Ul &lt;V«f A - aotn boptodDer# 1* Moveni^its of ofrl^lals ( a) mnn H.m’s ro'nm.l X'em^.')P J .gV: on tlie 16th epte^nbor returning to BHiiifti* Alt*as on Ui** hiu! ^1^»o Tl8lt®d Konwiia on the 2£4tti« Oaptain Zahiruldin /Uiiood, Tmilan signal uorpe, arrived at Bandar M)Das rrom x»acra Dy sea on the 10th and aubssciusntly procoadad to Jask on the 16th where he took charge or the Persian wlrele^« station (see para- g reph 5 t) ©1 ow) • B j a'ut a In A • od * u tel eg r aphl c address is -Briwagent jmk m .^7 yr H.

Mr Barling, ^ocust Officer, has been in bandar Abbas since Boptember avth maidng preliminary arrangements. Vr Lean, -ooust Of 11 cor, arrived on ^o/emDor iiist.

Anti-Locust flight with headquarters at Jask. A snail detachment has oeon stationed at Bandar Abbas. ^ decent reports iidioate that the influx oi locusts from India will be much less than originally expected but there is a serious danger of a heavy invasion from Oman in January and it is thought that the combined force will be fully organised by this time. 8.

Perhaps some 50 tons of merchants cargo (sugar, piec^-goods, and tea) were despatched by lorry to iezd and Tehran. Merchants continue to protest against the short age of transport ana to evaae the priority regulations. There is some excuse ror their trying to ao this in that the representatives of the Transport B o no poly are in efficient and corrupt, ana are apt to manipulate the regu lations to suit their pockets. It would possibly assist the proper working of the transport priority system if copies of the more important orders were sent to H.M.Con sul by the Central office in Tehran. nittle good will be done by local representatives while they remain of the present worthless type. 5. laihlio health There are a very few cases of small-pox ana ty phoid in the town. j-he Municipal * eoicai Officer has vaccinated a large number of people ana inoculated many with T.A.B.serum received from Tehran. 6.

It was examined after the he^vy rain which fell in the early days of the month and found to have one or two soft spots. But it is understood that the aerodromes at Jask and Sharjah were also unserviceable after these rains and it appear® that the serviceaHlity of the new landing ground will be as good after rain as that of most other aerodromes in the tfork is on hand on two other landing grounds to be used for anti-locust work. ^ne is ib miles from Ban dar Abbas at tne junction of the bandar -abbas - Kerman and Bandar Abbas - Isin roads, providing runways of 1000 and 800 yards, another lies 10 miles west of Isin ana promises vecy long runways as yet unmeasurec3 8. g.i slim H*i:.Goruui ana k?

Dargawan is a fishing village of perhaps 1500 innaoitants. -»-hQr9 is also some Doat-Duilaing and cloth weaving or the coar#e out gailj coloured '^ishm cloth which is proving the standDy of the poor in the hanuar ^toas area, now that finer quality cloth is almost unprocurable. -»-he greatest centre of the industry lies in Halur, one mile to the east of Da rg a van, hut weaving is carried out in practi cally every village of oishra, the finest quality oloth coining from Kusheh, half-way between and Lart, but even this is a coarse weave made on small ha ia-li&gt;oms. Odd ly enough, not women wastEa out boys and youths carry out the laborious work of throwing the shuttle to and rro as they sit in the shallow pits in which the loom is set. ihe thread is obtained from the Khunji Dot ton Spinning Mills in Bandar Abbas ana a maund of it, which a few year# ago cost rials 50.00, now costs 600.00. Ihe cost price or this oloth in ^ishni is rials 5 or 6 per metre but oy the time miaalemen have taken profits the price is u, i*&gt; and lb rials at Ban- lar. Abbas. H.F.Consul was examining the possibility of buying large quantities or this cloth at cost price from Anglo-Irani an ttelief *unds for distribution to the poor, ihe difficulty is that the workers are usually tied'to work for certain merchants who supply their working capital - this is the old * outwork r system of the medieval English woollen industry. -^hit it is hoped to secure a cheaper rate than the present inflated retail cost in Bandar Abbas . Ploughing was in progress at many points, wheat and barley seed being sown broadcast ana then ploughed into the ground. All five villages or plshm referred to above, which are typical of the 66 villages of ^ishm, appeared prosperous, possibly because the^ are largely seir-suiTic- ient, tut partly also, perhapo, because they are not offici al-ridden. ••■n ^argawan and Suseh were one or two customs fn the others no officials at all beyond a few itinerant men of the ^enaannerie. nhe absence of officials unfortunately extends to the nealth department and there is no doctor in the whole Island. 9. iien.i am At Henjam H.W.Consul aistriDuted wheat, barley, rind cloth fron -^nglo-Iranian holier JUna stocks to about 150 people. A report lad come from the lir hting and buoy ing vessel “Nearchus' that the people of the island were in very bad straits. In fact, the condition of the people was found to be no worse than at many other places in the consulate area. x here is now, or course, practically no tr&amp;de and no vorA on the Island but most of the menfolk have gone to Khcr Tuvai to work as coolies. 10• rhe Election There is great activity on the part of the sup porters of all three candidates, ^heikh Abdullah ^ellah- dari, vr ^isbahzadeh, and *aji Mushir. hut the activity Is in string-pulling, locally and in Tehran, rather than in speech-making or the elaboration of any plank or programme. 1 Director oi j -osts ana telegraphs has painted an amusing picture to H.M.tfonaul of the local election / agentsagents thronging the telsgra^n olTica each day and. vying with eaoh other I'or time on t he telegraph line* hse the ’huzuri’ sysLem ana ajont nora .and canaldate in iehrau have tappea through to each other the latest moves and de velopments. x his lone, the agents depart spreading the ne-s that their particular employer has apparently obtain ed the favour or the rriine minister, the home ^inister, the Shah, the pally Press, the British, the Sussions, and the Americans, and that there can be no nossiDle acuot whatever of his Doing returned. *^n Bandar \hDas a whi a peri ng caru- palgn centred in the te'. : on of rice aoe^ ‘Vide for radio, press and platform propaganda of -’lore sophisticated constitii* enmi es.

It appears that the new .oad Transport IiiSpectors (one of whom, Captain Wilson, is at Bandar Abhas) are only oon- cemed with the oheoking ol* particulars of lorries and their loads. That is to sa?, if a lorry is proceeding with the correct waybill and with the proper authority, the insjeotort have no further Interest. This no doubt is a very useful servica but even befora the arrival of the inspectors way bills were usually in order. What is still required is striot supervision of the Persian local representatives to secure that priority orders for loading of (rovornment cargo are carried out, despite the temptations of mere .ante 1 bribes, and that space allotted for merchants* cargo is awarded on some fair principle instead of to the highest bidder* 83. Another abuse th&amp;u requires rooting out is the soeclal license system which allows, for instance, a lorry owner to have, say, three or four lorries ostensibly wording eKolusive ly for a factory or business house. This allotment is far beyond the requirements of the factoxy and enables the owner of the lorries to eaiploy these frequently carrying merchants• cargos exclusively without being required to carry Goveiment cargo. Public Health 90* there are still a few oases of typhoid and typhus in the town. Cases of smallpox have also been reported from the village of hum* 91.

There were five small boats laid up on the beach. ?heee are used for in shore fishing in the warmer weather. There are a number of wells and some cultivation of vegetables but the aruall area under wheat and barley has lacked rain.

In the opinion of K.M.Con sul, the Gellahdaris would be most unwise to agree to a new committee being formed. ±lie possibility of dlsputeft and de lays uould thereby be mui&amp;iplied and, asove all, they would do best to hold firm to the argument that all thwy have de manded was non-interference wi&amp;U the election from the centre and that therefore they now x erely want the clock turned back to the point where the ex-Goveruor commenced Ids open inter ference.L 0 3U£&gt;t»» 97* fct labt locusts have raaterialised and moral® In the Xransjordaii frontier ii'oroe ha*&gt; soared ai^er over three monttia of a 'phoney war' In which ihe eiiemy was noo even seen.

Some rumours are current that Sheikh Abdullah, by virtue of his position as a Deputy, is obtaining unilateral trade concessions (such as permission to export dates, hither to a Persian Government monopoly) beneficial to his own and affiliated businesses in Bandar Abbas. These rumours, how- everi are said to originate from Haji Kushir, no &gt; only the defeated candidate in the las*’ election buo also Sheikh Abdullah*s oo-fimercial rival, and it is therefore more tnan likely that these contentions, even if fully or partially correct, are activated by personal feelings of jealousy and revenge. 390. It is understood that the Director of Customs had received orders from Tehran not to allow the release of cotton imported from India by the Khunji Ootton Spinning Mill, as the ovners were obtaining suoh cotton cheaper than the fixed rate for Persian-grown ootton, and had refused to pay the difference involved between the two prices to the Persian Authorities. 391. on the 23rd the Electric Supply of the town again failed and it was ascertained later that the shareholders of the Company, had without warning, ordered tne closure oi the power station, ,so as to strengthen their hands in demand ing an enhanced rate for the new municipal contract, which had terminated in March and which had not been yet -enewed. Their action v/as successful as at a meeting held at the Govemorate on the next day to discuss the matter, the Municipality agreed to raise the cost of electric current S ii£s Llo to Dials 1.00 per kilowatt and to advance a suit of Dials 60,000.00 to the Company against consumption of current during the last five months. b92.

After the de- f arture of erakanl, the Govexnorate remained vacant until he appointment of Husaffbrl, tho present Governor, with strict Instructions to see that the election proceedings were Impartially carried out. vuasffarl, before his posting as Governor, had bson sent to Bandar Abbas by the Gov erne r-den e- ral In Kerman as an election inspector, but at tho aama time iuhani, another inspector had bean despatched hero fros&gt; Tehran by tha Ministry of tho Interior. This 'OUbertlan* situation, unfortunately aono too rare In Persian affairs, was solved as previously stated by the appointment of Kusaf- farl as Governor. Both tha latter and Huhanl sought the advise of this consulate regarding the wisdom of forming a new aleotion oomKittes, the previous one having been tech nically disolved, to w loh both ware given the reply that ss the o iginal committee had been properly constituted and Its dissolution obtained on the in correct and biased reports of th# ex-Governor, Gerakanl, It should stand. Both of these officials a,;re«d with the opinion expressed by this &gt;onaulat« and stated that they would report to higher authority accor dingly. After tula advise had been given, reports were received In larch from Tehran that two of the oontastlng oandldates, hr Miabahdadeh and Bhslkh Abdullah « ollaMdarl, had effected a compromise, whereby tae former agreed to withdraw from tha contest and to advlaa hie supporters to vote for tho latter. fhin agreement was later confirmed but although tha aotual tarns between the two parties were / notnot OlruigoA, it *m reported thnt one of the oonditioaa owe tbo re-appointment of HnMen Wlatoah, the brother of Ur His* behgodeh, so Oorernor of Ban^inr «vbbaa. It la more probable, honorer, that the main baala of the oompronlae waa a ftnanola agjuetaent, eharebjr the rloher party, the OeUaMLar&amp;s, bought out their poorer opponents. The reoult, however, was to tnlto tho tunnl voto m&amp; to aaauro an almost osrtain vlotory for Shaikh Abdullah OsllahAarl. la the meantime both tha tovemor of Bandar Abbas and tha Election 'napeotor, mhanl, had reaaivad Inatruotlons that tha original almotion ooamlt&gt; tsa should stand, and tha position at tha and of Varoh was, therefore, that tha eoaaltroa &gt;ir* basn dsslgnatad as lagal and that Shaikh Abdullah OailahdaA and Hxjl Wushlr now ra- *mined to oontest tha saat. 4. Bajl vushlr who by tha bsglanlng of April bad raa- llsad that his defeat was oertain nada a final effort to ■wit:raw* gracefully from tha oontaet, without tha loss of prestigs. Re, therefore, appealed to tha novernor-ftsnoral in Kanmn, and eugneeted or evolved with the latter a pint, whereby in defsranes to his age and IS ears’ standing a* a deputy, ha should be adjudged as having been *elected* first in the returns and would then, after the publioatlon of tha result, withdraw In favour of his sore youthful opponent, Sheikh Abdullah Salladdarl. The latter, as a sonaesuenoa of this agreement or understanding received a summons to proomed to Kerman, but fortunately for him ha had bean In* formed of his opponent’s intentions, and was naturally sus picious of tha outcome, the sore so as his Ai otlon had by now been virtually seoured. Ra, therefore, delayed him departure to Karaan until the last possible moment (April *tt havlnr first made certain with the Oovernor and his own alsot ion agents, that voting would proceed aoeording to tho scheduled dates, via, 10th to 18th April. Before his de parture h* also took tho precaution of *intimidating* tha local telegraph authorities not to deliver any telegrams having a bearing on the election and arranged with his own supporters to out tho telegraph line between Bandar Abbas and Kerman, both of which wane auoaaasfully aooompliahed. Ha then left for Kerman and took aa long as possible to raaoi there, by which time voting had already started In this eras and postponmant orders, if issued, oould or did not reach Bandar Abbas. By this ruse nothing was heard In Bandar Abbas of tha oompromiss talks In Karmen until tha l&amp;th April, by which time It was too lata to atop the election machinery or to enable Raj 1 Mushir*s supporters to abstain from voting as they had already eoamltted themselves to tha oampaign. Thus nhalkh Abdullah oellahdar&amp; avoided the possibility of a last minute compromise end assured his own sleetIon. 8. Respite these doubtful practises in obtaining thel. object, tha fiaLlahdarl family, (although i heikh Abdullah had spent several years in Germany, share his interests ware I probably acre oommerolal than polltieel) have had British oonneotlona dating from tha Great ar and the era of tha ’ 'outh Persian tti-fles. These interests, provided they do mot dash with business or flaanoial considerations, may be generally assessed as pro-British rod sympathetic to the Allied amuse. Rajl Vushlr and his adherents have been non committal rod reserved In their relations with this OonasSnt while the Rlabehsadah faction, personified particularly by his brother, whan in office as Governor, had shown little inollaatl -&lt;n to adopt a friendly attitude rod lass to oonoeal it.

Kanaffarl, ths fovsmor, had aorv than ones expressed his fe^rw to thin Ooneulsts, tliat ono of ths^onditions attondat to tho withdrawal of viabab- sadoh from tho eleotlon platfoni was his own roplsooasnt by tba ox-(K&gt;voraor, Hassan Hisbsh, brother of tho uootor. on tbo 9th July his apprehensions appeared to hove boon justi fied, as on that date he received telegraphic Instructions fro* tho ministry of tho Interior to prooood to Lar, after handing ovor charge to Hassun tiebah, a ehnoge that would have been moat undesirable, as ths lattsrb previous tenure in office had boon anything but a raoo nendation for a fur ther period in harness. However, tho assertion thst Hassan bisbah's reappointment was aam ono of tho conditions of tho Oellehdaxl-isiobahsnaeh compromise appeared to bo either un founded or subsequently oountereended, since Sheikh Abdullah evidently supported the retention of hunaffari as Severn ir of Bandar tbbas and although Haoean Misbah actually arrived here to assume charge, his appointment was cancelled and tho present incumbent was confirmed la his position at the mi of July. i 7.

In feet, it is with tho greatest difficulty that they San be persuaded to visit tho Consulate for business or social reasons| this is probably due, not to n return to the Pehlevl regime ef social ostra cism of foreign subjects, but to the general hot weather routine in Bandar abbas during which offioi Is and others aak&lt; little effort to stir out of their own smell environ ment, or go anywhere that causes more then a minimum of physical effort. fhle and tho universal laok of transport is probably the root ef then&gt;parent *unfri.madly* attitude which is mhskksmkmd substantiated by the feat that when meetings do ooour at central places, which occasion little hardship to reaeh, tho bwerlng of those of loials is always oordlal. Ths same remarks apply, although to a lesser extant to tho loaders of tho merohant community, but la their ease many of tho more influential have taken the opportunity afforded to them by their wealth te leave Bandar Abbas for a mors salubrious climate. 8.

At the request of some looal merchants the Central Customs, Tehran, have sanctioned the export of 2,000 tons of dates of last year # s orop from this area. Kaji Kukhtar Ihishir, the ex^Deputy of Bandar Abbas, was the only person to oppose this deoision and protested to Tehran that there would be a scarcity of dates during the ensuing winter if this export was permitted. However, as the yield of the present orop is estimated at 30 to 40 above average, there will be little or no demand for last season's dates, when the new crop is released on the market. Kaji Fushir's action is probably prompted rather by his growing dislike and jealousy of the Oellahdarl faction, who are rapidly ousting him from his erstwhile position of influence and affluence in Bandar Abbas, than any real interest in the welfare of the community In this area. 411. Haji Mushir having failed to obtain election even on the Funicipal Committee and finding also that his position as a leading factor in looal politics is being eclipsed, has now, with the hope of regaining some of his influence, started propagating for the Hizb-i-Adalat (Justice Party) which was first introduced in this area by Sheikh Abdullah Dashtl, the cousin of Sheikh All Bashti, the Tehran oeputy, during the Bandar Abbas elections.

The issue of Government sugar and tea has produced a substantial iaii in the market price of these articles which has now decreased to Rials 6700 per bag and Rials 260 per kilo respectively. The price of cigarettes has further drooped to Rials 5.60 per packet of ton* while that of ghee from Rials 80 to Rials 70 per kilo.

Reference paragraph Mo. 63 above, curing his visit to Korans, ' 5 is Majesty’s Consul visited the salt mine on the west of the Island and the red oxide mine on the south. Both are not being worked at present, owing to lack of shipping to carry stocks already mined away. The installations are, however, being kept open for post war development. vx.

The reason for its state of preservation appears to lie in the quality of the cement, with which the walls were built, and there is no doubt that it was a looal product of ,T oniius. vr. Bulakh is very interested in the future of this natural Hormuw cement which is obtained from a white mountain to the north - west of the oxide mine, wot only is the cement Impervious to sea water, but it appears to need little processing in cor parisan to that required by the normal limestone used in Tndlan production. Tf this ^ormu« cement is efficiently exploited after the war, It should prove a more valuable industry to the i si ana than even the red oxide. Pr. Bulakh informed Fis Majesty’s consul that a British Captain had been to Hormuz to examine the cement and had later asked for two tons of it to be sent to Basrah. local 73.

The road to Minab is in Tory bad condition* Munerous water channels are crossed by date palm bridges, which are newer repaired until they collapse entirely. A eudty Irrigation channel (usually overflowing its banks) amo 6 foot wide by 4 foot deep s enned by a half collapsed bridge Is a formidable obstacle to all but Jeeps* 4 160. The grain harvest In this area should be a record. The whole road from Shamil to Mlnab, a distance of some £&amp; miles, is flanked to the south by com fields stretching away almost to the sea* There must be some thousands of tons of surplus wheat available from this area, where harvesting has already begun. There is no government scheme for cornering any portion of this crop* -ad bad communications and laok of transport when added to this fact, will make it interesting to note whether any appreciable fraction of the crop will find Its way to Bandar Abbas. l&amp;l. The last 4 miles of the road pass through a forest of date gardens, which if properly exploited should yield great wealth to the district* Mlnab itself yields a fine oro &gt; of lemons and mangoes.

Aaai Mahmoudi of the Mines Department arrived on the 11th to examine the case between Bui lakh and his two subordinates Maldanlpur and Shirani. from the outset it was obvious that his line was to support the Persians. Mot only was he a personal friend of Shiranis, so that ni^s of his arrival delighted the insubordinate pair, but he went straight to their house and stayed with them for the first 2 days of his visit. 216. Sheikh Abdullah Geliahdari brought him to see His Majesty*s Consul to discuss the ease. Mabmoudl had the Maldanl^ pur - Shirani side of the case pat. His Majesty*s Consul main tained the attitude that as long as there was no Mtoh in the loading of red oxide on the Striok ship, he did not wish to intervene. He knew Bullakh was absolutely honest, and advised Mahmoudi to get Bullakh* s side of the story before he made any decisions. Mahmoudi said that as far as he knew no permission had been given Strloks to remove the oxide, but as a gesture of co-operation he would let them take 1,500 tons providing they paid the present price of £ 4 per ton a s opposed to £ 4 P«r ton prevailing when they made their first shipment. 217. After five days it emerged that Mahmoudi had not yet seen Bullakh, and in response to requests from both sides His Majest- y*s Consul brought them together at the Consulate. There Mahmoud i announced that he had already dismissed Bullakh In ! RECa. F afrbsentlo and indeed it was clear from the directive he had f received In Tehran, which he showed His Majesty* s Consul, that 2 he had been primed to do this before leaving. In the oiroum- NDIA CstauowS His Majesty*s Consul said he saw no point In his being brought/J into the ease further. If the Vines Department wished to dismiss an honest and experienced man in farour of a pair of lnsuhordln~ ate rogues it was their affair. Mahmoudi gave an undertalcing that the organisation on Hoxmus would he put in order hy himself and Shirani and that there would he no delay in loading the steamer when it oame. The outcome remains to he seen. * 218. Sheikh Ah dull ah Oellhdari* s role in the affair became — clear when he asked His Majesty 9 s Consul whether he did not think the Mines Department ran Hormuz so badly that it would he better for a private company to take it over. His interests are obvious ly to encourage inefficiency and corruption on the island, until the Government will he only to glad to dispose of the mining rights for a ndmlnal sum. 219. Beference aragrftph 76. Mr. Khufud the irrigation adviser to Sheikh Abdullah Geliahdari informed His Majesty's Consul that he had been asked to prepare plans for a prison on Hormuz to accomodate 1,000 prisoners, the contract for which was to he giv«i to Mahomed Khan Geliahdari hy the Government. He could not vouch whether the scheme would actually go through hut it appears that His Majesty 9 s Consul's prognostications as to the future role envis aged for this neighbourhood hy the Persian Government may be~eorreet. 220. As a result of an attempt hy the Vinanee Department to assess the real profits of traders in Bandar Abbas and to impose the relevant income-tax, all shops and business have been closed since the 15th in protest. The post office has been thronged day and night with outraged merchants sending telegrams to the capital and a room has been set aside for the consumption of tea and water melons by those waiting to affix their names to joint tele grams or to send their own. i • 221.

Mr. Lean 9 s visit was made in a two-engined Douglas trans port 9 plane which experienced no difficulty in landing and taking off/.the caleb-i-qazl landing ground (formerly known as Baalu). Certain works are necessary to the aerodrome markings to make them sac stand out better. 225. It is unfortunate that this excellent natural landing ground is 30 miles from Bandar Abbas and that the road to it is so bad. Timsar Sha&amp;ri has, however, promised to send a section of sappers in the autumn to try and improve the difficult river -bed crossings.MgfflHB- 226, The fortnight saw the approach of a warm of hoppers, about 4 miles long by a mile ^ide to near Bandar Abbas 9 The Consulate ^as completely covered with the pest8 9 and Mr* Lean and His Majesty** Consul spent tv r o days covering the surround* ing desert with poisoned bran* A most satisfaotory kill was ^ achieved, and it was hoped that the saving of the town from invasion and the sight of neoMMaarim* satisfying ; lies of dead hoppers all over the ground in the vicinity of the town might do something to tone down the growing volume of Persian critic- j ism levelled at the Locust Oautpaign* Critic ism has however increased and the apoearance of a hundred hoppers in a landown er* a date garden is sufficient to set off outraged inquiries lx • ( from the Governor as to what the British are doing about it. 22?* Although there is no doubt that the unprecedented scale of the Locust invasion found the Anti-Locust axithorities with a smaller organisation than was necessary, a large measure of success has be*) achieved locally* Mr* Lean even estimates total killings as high as 70J&lt;. However, the Persians are more impressed by 10 hoppers that escape than by a swam that is destroyed, and it is certain that loud criticiaa of the British organisation will be heard in the press, oritloism fanned by if not actually originating from Persian officials of the Agricultural Department loaned to the AhtL-Looust Unit* lattjg AMAims- 228* About 50 local officials and notables of the distriot were invited to dinner at the Consulate on May 9th to celebrate T*B.

The postmaster has replied that at present the aerodrome is occupied by# the B.A.F. and hence no plans are available. 255. Security at the aerodrome Is very slack and the local population wander onto it at will. There is also a great deal of breaking bounds at night by levies and B.O.Rs to meet women in the town.

These have been most successful and the Persian Officer responsible, Kutallabi, appears to have fulfilled his functions satisfactorily, in the first two weeks of May more hoppers were destroyed than in the whole of the preceding month.

As these can only be from Kerman officials already sweetened by Musnir Diwani, it la is not expected that much will be done. . The gravest aspect of the affair, is thet Musnir, having bean caught ought in his unofficial censorship of official mail (see pare- rxi * graph £64), has arranged for the inspectors to arrest the last post master, Qaemi, ana instal a creature of his own, Mubashiri.

These inspectors started Operations by accusing the ex-acting-Governor, Mosanenzadeh ana Mohd Khan Gellahdari of implication in a case of robbery and arson committed by wandering Baluchis in Mushir’s vlUage of Hassan Langi. Various officials suspected of partiality to the Gellahdari party were summarily impris oned, though Mosanenzadeh managed to evade arrest by a few hours by leaving on the B.I. steamer for Khorramshehr..

Hsi Majesty 1 s Consul, Bandar Abbas.Events of* worEiimportance in the last six montns have made little difference to the general life of Bandar Abbas* All clashes seemed genuinely pleased at what was considered a British victory over Germany and the sudaen end of the war with Japan appeared as very mucn of a second best to the victory celebrated such a short time before it* ’ • ; # Relations with officials have been extremely cordial, and it na* c remained very much oi c ice ture oi the post, that all manner of /a matter questions which are purely/lor the Persian Government are reierred to the Consul for his opinion. I have endeavoured not to encourage this attitude^among Persian officials too much, and to point out tnat, although this Consulate is only too pleased to listen to local news and views, the ultimate organisation of government must remain a matter for Persians themselves. Trie stock of the government and government officials especially is extremely low v.ith tne mercantile cles es and these in particular tend to regard the Consulate as the ultimate seat of direction for local affairs. For this reason it is extremely necessary* for .the Consul to De on his guard against becom ing involved in all sorts oi local squabbles. 3. A Governor, Sepehrnia, was at last appointed and arrived in September. He speaks good English and has had much to do with the British and is an Anglopnile. His main ambitions at present are to visit England and to escape from the back water of Bandar Abbas. The comparatively honest and energetic Garrison Commander, Ghaffari is also still here, and tnc new Rais-i~Genaarmerle, Salehshur, is popular and well spoken of, succeeding as he does a stream of arrant rogues, who never stayed for more then six weeks. Tne Customs administration is also reasonably 7 * popular. The Finance and Justice Departments, however, continue to wallow in tneir nabitual mire of corruption, while the Posts enu Telegraphs Department has become increasingly inefficient. In October this Consulate discovered that telegrams sent to Jask over a period of two montns previously had not yet been received, telegrams from Tehran were received after ix twentyfive days and the average time for telegrams to Kerman was two to tnret days, while a Consulate clerk who managed to penetrate the inner recesses of the Post Office discovered parcels for this Consulate dating from 1041. 4 . The administration of outlying areas sucn as Jask ana Minab lias sunk to unbelievable deptns of inefficiency ana .corruption, and the British Liaison Officer in tne iormer place reports that of the 14-15 officials who iniest tnat umortunate village, only/ tne Garrison Commander can be said to fulfil his functions at all. Newly posted officers arrive and maite a show of energy and honesty, but give up tne unequal struggle after a couple of montns and settle down to e career of extreme extortion. The cause of this state of x alfairsiis two fold. Firstly, places like Jask, Minab and to a lesser extent Qishm are extremely inaccessible ana nence there is no supervision over the officials posted to tnese places. Hence no credit is gained for good work done, ana no punishment is given for corruption. Secondly, Heads of Depertments in Kerman have come to regard this area as a field for personal exploitation, and nothing else. Sartip Sha'ari, the former O.C. troops Kerman paid flying visits to Bandar Abbas 'on inspection”. Officers vno o, their own exactions had accumulated enough to buy tne general off were f&amp;vour«i| ably reported on, while those who had endeavoured to live on their 9 ! pay were threatened with imprisonment. The present O.C. Gendarmerie, Kerman, on nis recent visit, by his rapacity astonished even local subordinates, accustomed as tney are to tne exactions 01 their superiors. b. P brighter side of the picture, however, can be set.n in v hat a o •ears to be an increased interest in tne district on the part ol thf Governor in Kermtn. His visit to Bsnuar Abbas vvss reportea to oe tne first occasion on wnicnsnoideroi tne^post 1 or mer * 1 Governor ate S'Tne^uif ££ X wL beiinitely the first till* / ifc time in nistory a Governor General h&amp;u visitea Minab. Agh&amp;L biie^iruchi proiesrea to De horrii'iea at the inadequacy of the means placed at tne disposal oi tne local administration for visiting tneir respective charges. The Governorate, though responsible for Hajiabad, ftCinab Cisnm and Jask has neither motor vehicles nor a launch. The Gendar merie nave no transport at all, arm tne military have only one decre pit truck wnich is mechanically unsound. .Tnere are moreover virtu ally no roads in the district v/hicn are practicable for vehicles other than a jeep. Another welcome visitor has been Aghai gepenred, the fatner of the present Governor, who, it is understood, has been empov.ered Dy the Ministry of Interior to inspect and report on the general administration of many towns in Persia, and who, having made the journey to Minab and failed to get to J ask for Isck of transport, is recommending tnat urgent steps be taken to improve the communicat ions of the district. Both the above officials agreed tnat the corruption of.minor focal ofiicials arises from their virtual indep endence from any central authority. Tne ultimate putting into force of the suggestions, maae uy these two officials will however of ramer course depend on Tehran. 6 . Anotaer heartening sign is that the question of provision of a water supply for the town has been re-opened by tne recent gifts from the Shan, Sheikh Abdullah and leading merchants. It is under stood much more money would be iortncoming locally if an assurance coula De had that the entire work would De entrusted to some British or Indian compnay, and not undertaken oy some Government Department. Springs and underground water channels are reported to be abundant in the footnilxs of Ginau and a sufficient supply of water could be assureu. It is noped that wnen the work is emoarked upon attention will be paid to local opinion, ana the entire project will not be allowed to become merely a source of income to the so called ^engineers' of tne Persian Government; 7. The end of the war has brought no relief to the trading inter ests of what was once a flourishing port. It is still impoBsible for merchants to ootain goods from India or the United Kingdom without going througn tne devious cnannels of Tehran and exports from the interior now go oy rail to Indie from Hahidan, instead of oeing snipped from nere as wes done Defore trie war. The number of British * Indie steamers xxx calling at tne port has dwindled to two, witn tne result tnat goods and passengers are being shipped by country craft, retner than wait for two months between tne cells of steamers. d. Local industrial concerns nave not fared well, with the exception of tne Khunji Spinning Mill which nas increased output under Mr. Knowles, a laneashire Cottone engineer. Tne Fish Canning Factory closed down in June ana has not yet reopened, possibly because of losses last year due to the reasons given in ny last six montnly appreciation. Rumours are again current tnat Knunji is in Tenran negotating with the Government for tne leas^ oi this factory. No work is being carried out in tne Hormuz mines, but 15 &gt;0 tons of rea oxide from tne huge dump of already mined material were lifted by a Strick steamer last month and it is possible tnat furtner large consignments will be lifted to India and tne U.X. in tne near future, j Nothing however is known locally of any plans to restart operations on tne mines. Tne electric factory nas somehow managed to carry on despite lacK of machinery and spare parts, and non payment of dues by tne municipality, who are now rials 500,000 In arrears. Owing to the failure of tne f.I.O.C. to send gas-oil supplies tne factory has bem closed for tne last month out should commence work witnin a' day or tvo when sullies arrive. At one time the electric company nao said they i oula not start wor* in any case until arrears were paid up, but local merchants have agreed to a sell' imposed tax ton.imports and exports to keep tne factory running. The question of the payment oi%r-ears r* msi is unsolved. In Minab a company nas been formed by merchants with a capital of Rials 10,100 to provide electricity ior the town.Local oolitics flarea up frain as the hot weather receded. Heji » n -i.

Mushir has announced his intention of not stand ing for Bandar /bbas in the coming elections but oi using his inxln- ence on behalf oi 'an^ r one' opposing Gheikh Abdullah. 11 The liKel^^ course of the elections has not yet taken del inite sha&gt;e. in tne summer there were signs of many of the Gellehdari party falling away from gheikh Abdullah, with whom they were dissatisfied for his Irek oi interest in local affairs, but the recent clash with M Jishir has served to arouse their partisan spirit once more and to close their ranks. An interesting rumo'ir oi recent origin nas it that Apnai Khunji, the absentee owner of the spinning mill intends tc contest tne seat. Re would not be a cad candidate from our point ofll view as he is v-ell disposed towards us, is a shrewd business man and educated. I fear^ however, thah: his main interests lie in Xermen em Tehran, and unless he could be persuaded to visit Bena« fbbas more often than he does, he would pay li^ le attention to the interests of the district. In any case if the election comes to a straight fight between Gellanaari tixi Knunji, our policy oi complete non-intervention will save us irom tne emcarrassment oi having to chose between two men, botn of vhom are our irlends, ana eliner of vhom voula make a reasonable candidate ior Bandar A^^as. It mist remembered, however, that there are certain to De otner candidates. 11 Although there have been numerous cases of petty robberies of donkey men ana small caravans, security on the whole has not been unsatisfactory. gervan Qhaffari the O.C. troops spent live ao^ns of the summer out in the mountains by Fin in an eliort to Ali Mahomed ill and his gang , to book. All Mahomed Ali managed to escape to the neighDourhood of Bastak in Fars, but twelve oi his gang kilted over tnirty prisoners were t£iken and 4D rifles recovered, as I a result? tnis roboer gang has virtually ceased to exist. Tne Taher Lis under ;li Jallal, a reasonaule and capable leader have remained - 5 et t-ithougn attemots were made by Haji Musnir to involve in his ^ccusati^ against the Gellahdaris, whose firm supporters they 2re There may however be trouole from them in the iuture due to the'recent anointment of Mirza Berks t Naushirwani to oe responsible for tribal security around Jssk.

Once ne is strong enough it □resused that he will try to stage a show down with the Teherzais -probably after the R»A,F. have evacuated Jask. H ; . V.ith the em of the war, the imperial aelence interests oi this consulate have come to an end. The naval base at Khor Quwai has declined into a mere communication!s base manned by signal staff. The R.A.i • ground establishment at Jask is in the process oi wiixiing uo its affairs, and our control of tne wireless station there uas ceased, plans are however affot to establish a baloon observatory at jask under the Indian Meteorological Department. IS. as was said in ay last six monthly report, the immediate future is of tremendous importance to Bandar A^khS. Trade and snipp ing are all that give life to tnis barren coast from chanbar to J Tingah, and for these to flourish good administration by tne Persicqfi Government and cooperation by the Indian Government are vital. Most peQnie here have little optimism as to the possibility of ths former but a great deal as to tne latter. Tneir trade with India has been killed by tne restrictions imposed during the war and only tne sneedy whittling down of those restrictions can restore former orosoerity. Four nundred years of connections witn the Britisn have assured that tneir eyes are turned to us alone. Il in the next five /ears we cannot make free tne trade between nere and India, those m eyes will turn elsewnere. Sd/-~K.M. Hadow. His Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas.MOVEMENTS: BRITISH OFFICIALS. 30.

He went to Rudbar on the 8 th and returned on the 10th when he called on His Majesty’s Consul. He visited Hormuz on the Igth. He dined at the Consulate on the 13th and finally left for Kerman on the 14th. It is reported that the Sartip has said that although he could get Sarvan Ghaffari punished on numerous charges he would prosecute him only on the charge of forgery which would bring a maximum penalty. The forgery consisted of making fictit ious signatures on the soldiers pay lists. 35. Setvan Ahmed Naheed arrived from Kerman on the 10th and took charge of the Conscription Department from Ostoward Yacobzadeh. 36. Sarhang Gulpeera, Chief of Conscription Department for Kerman province arrived from Kerman on the 13th on a visit of inspection and returned on the 17th. 37.

The Governor offered Haji Mushir’s party one more seat in the Election Committee, but Ghulam Ali Mushiri stuck to his demand for at least 3 out of the six members nominated. The Governor thereupon withdrew his offer and the election committee stands as before. The Mushiris have been inundating Kerman and Tehran with petitions against the way the elections were being run, and it is now clear that they are out to cause all possible trouble by stirring up local animosities. Ball- otting is to take place on March 1st. ' ^ 39* It is reported that Dr, Misbahzadeh, who was a candidate fnr Bhnd&amp;n^Abbas in the last Majlis elections, is again to contest the .to Y seat. He has already sent instructions to start propaganda on his ■&gt;! ^ and this is being done by Dr. Zarnegar, the head of the -tliocal hospital, wh 6 is in some way connected with him. Doctor O T, ^arnegar is an 'Awazi, who was brought up in Bombay. He is an ^ .'^/intelligent and pleasent individual. It was reported that he was \d\ ( yly considering opening a reading room for the young ’Awazis of the —'-y town, but has dropped the idea on being told by the Governor thfct his act would have political motives attributed to it. 40. Numerous anonymous letters signed by the 'Hizb-i-Marmooz' or ’’Mystic League' have been circulating. They chiefly attack the Gellahdaris and Aqai Mosanenzadeh, the ex-Acting Governor, who has returned /2 returned here pending transfer. It is assumed they are the work of the Mushir party. 41. Reference paragraph 11 of 1946. The Fish Factory has start ed work with local dhows as their fishing fleet, as the trawler promised from Khorrmashahr has not yet arrived. SECURITY.AND TRIBAL. 42. His Majesty’s Consul with the O.C. Gendarmerie, travelled to Kuhistak and saw All Jallal Nik-khah, the chief of the Taher- zai Baluchis. Ali Jallal is responsible for the security of the Biaban coast and is subsidised to maintain 60 gendarmes. He appears to be extremely successful, and to be doing something for the inhabitants of his area by encouraging Irrigation and cultiv ation. He has recently opened a school in his garden at Bumani near Kuhistak. 43. Reference paragraph 19 of 1946. The ex-^bandits' have returned to their villages and have agreed to hand in their arms, their livelihood is,, however, still precarious as their livestock was driven off and sold by Sarvan Ghaffari to his own benefit. Sarvan Salahshoor has promised to try and trace this livestock and return it, but the task is difficult as most of the cattle are now among the herds of the wealthy landowners of the area, who bought them cheap off Ghaffari. FINANCIAL. 44. Money is very tight and there are no buyers. Reference paragraph 491. The Customs duly collected the surtax on all the sugar to be ’’unfrozen 1 ' and then promptly refused to allow its removal. Local merchants whose money is tied up In this sugar are naturally incensed at what.they consider a swindle by the Government. 45. Indian currency notes are now being sold at the rate of Rials 12.50 per Rupee, and a further rise is expected shortly owing to lack of Rupees in the Persian market for exports from India. No Rupee drafts can be obtained from the market at a reasonable rate. PUBLIC HEALTH. 46. Reference paragraph 22 . Pneumonia was responsible for 15 more deaths this month. 47.

Reference para 4- r 5 of 1945. The Electric ^ight Company has finally cut off all street lighting until suchtime ’as arrears amounting to Rials 342,117 are paid by the Municipality^ A sum of Rials 40,000 sent by Tehran to the Municipality has been spent, half on paying off these dues and half on the arrears of pay of Municipal sweepers. Supply of current to private houses continues. 66 . ' Sheikh Abdullah Gellahdari explained to H.M»s Consul - that the Rials 2,500,000 donated by the Shah for the provision of a water supply for Bandar Abbas, were in fact to be recovered /Ministries from the/of Finance and Agriculture, in the form of a write-oii of debts owed to the Pahlevi family. As these Ministries are chronically bankrupt they have been unable to pay over the money, although a reluctant promise to pay up Rials 300,000 has been wrung from them. The hopes of a water supply have receded accordingly. jn an effort to raise funds the Municipality has erected a toll-gate at Naiband which charges Rials ISO on all laden lorries passing. The A.I.O.C. who are the chief sufferers,^ have questioned the legality of this step in Tehran, and their ' local reuresentative somewhat unwisely advised the chauffeurs * under contract to the company not to pay. This led to incidents at the toll-gate, and the threat of firing by the police in charge. On further orders from Tehran the A.I.O.C. have now instructed chauffeurs to pay under protest pending a clarification of the issue. H.M’s Consul has been pressing the Governor to spend the^ money already collected on clearing sand from the road, which is in a deplorable condition for a distance of tv/o miles from the town to the Fish Factory. The Governor, however, appears unable to grasp the value of this ready-made answer to chauffeurs when they complain of this imposition, and talks of spending the money on his sweepers. It is hoped that further pressure will be brought on him by Sheikh Abdullah Gellahdari and members of the Municipal Council, who have already hinted that the item 'sweepers would * appear to cover the Governor’s household expenditure. 68 . Shortly after Sheikh Abdullah Gellahdari’s arrival, . and on the expiry of his Parliamentary immunity orders were received for his arrest, as the result of a complaint brought by a merchant in Tehran for the repayment of Rials 840,000 misappropriated by Sheikh Abdullah over a sugar deal. On Sheikh Abdullah s ne w father-in-law Ahmed Gellahdari going guarantee for the sum, Bandar Abbas’ Member of Parliament has escaped the clutches of the law. It is, however, understood that there may be other cases pending against him, JASK 69. The last member of theR.A.F. left on March 1st. Houses on the aerodrome were left in charge of the Gendarmerie pending final orders. The British Liaison Officer’s office has been closed and the Clerk in Charge withdrawn on the L.T^ 'Nearchus on March 4th 70. Reference para 16 of 1946. Aghai Sepehrnia’s entirely praiseworthy suggestions to rationalise the administration at Jask has met with the answer from Tehran that, far from reducing the strength of departments at Jask, the Government desires to increase its stranglehold on that unfortunate village. With /the3 the withdrawal of the R.A.F. and the resultant fall in the demand for labour, the economic conditions of Jask will become even more critical. This coupled with the increasing exactions of Mirza ^.rv Barkat will in all probability lead to an exodus from the area of the poorer and less powerful elements of the population. Mirza has apparently not yet been confirmed in his post in the Gendarmerie but is being given a free hand to behave as he pleases (^HAifeAR 71 The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and H.M*s Consul interviewed the Indian community at Chahbar.

SECURIH 73 Reference para 19 of 1946. As a result of the amnesty offered to the petty bandits by Servan Salashoor, Ali Mohd All the Chief who has been lurking in the mountains near Lar finally agreed to come to Anguran to parley on March 24th. H.Ms Consul was invited by the Gendarmerie to attend, and Ali Jallal the Baluch Chief also accompanied the party. Ali Mohd Ali stated that he had lived quietly with his tribe in his village of Girdsiah, until the exactions of the landlords of Fin had led him to take reprisals. As a result of military operations flocks had been driven off, his crops looted and his entire tribe had to depend on banditry for a livelihood. He was only too anxious to live a quiet life, provided his property was restored, and the village of Girdsiah placed beyond the control of the landlords of Fin. As orders regarding an amnesty for him must , come from Tehran, it is feared that the delay will lead to his once more taking to the hills, and the opportunity of assuring security in the area north of Bandar Abbas will be lost. 74 , Some camels belonging to the inhabitants of Rezwaft and Sarzeh are said to have been stolen by the followers of Sardah Dulkhani, the Turki Chief of the area on the borders of Pars.

It v^ill 'he TememAered that, 'before he finally threw up the sponge ani sought the doubtful hcspitali‘ty of thsi^, oviet r nion, Pishevari issued ar appeal to all '1 eral' elements in Persia to rise, and in alliance with the ’’democrats” of Azerbaijan, to throw off the burdensome yoke imposed upon them by the 'reactionary” Central Government. it seemed to me at the time th&amp;t Pishevari had made a serious miscalculation if he really expected this appeal .to result in appreciable aid for his cause. The advance guard cf the soviet 'fifth column', especially in the somth, was still too weak to a.ct effectively. ''he people of fhtizistan had listened to the specious promises of the Tud.eh party - they had noped for much - and they had received nothing. '’he party was not strong enough, and it was accordingly discredited. The ground had not been sufficiently prepared. bo Pishevari's call fell on deaf ears. Yell, the soviet could always try again, and it seemed reasonably certain that they would not make the same mistake twice. ''he advance guard would be adequate, and well financed. The masses :n 'huzistan had neither the sense of political responsibility nor the sturdy independence of the Azerbaijani* ^hey could be easily led, and led they would bel 2, The consternation caused in Tabriz and Rezaieh amongst Armenians, Assyrians, and other politically doubtful elements at the 'screening' and deportation to the south of Persia of those uf their number who were thought to be disaffected did not appear to disturb the Russian Consul-General in Tabriz unduly. Clearly the measure was primarily directed against persons known to be well disposed towards Persia's northern neighbour, and as such it migljt have been expected to provoke some Russian reaction. ''ut there was none to speak of. The hardships inflicted upon their individual supporters by this forcible migration were of no interest to Russia. ^he r.iuhajjirs were not really needed i Azerbaijan - which the , •viet could easily terrorise into 'welcoming' its 'liberators' - but they were needed in the south, especially in .huzistan. All right, let the migration proceed - this was manna in the political desert - and the boviet Consul in &gt;ihwaz could b e trusted to gather it in. 3. January •pened with some four hundred 'iviuhajjirs' in Ahwaz, another sixty of military age just absorbed in the Persian forces in ^ehbehan, and a further two hundred in Dizful. &gt;.11 of these had been subjected to a second 'screening' at Jh^rramabad and the Chief of the Persian General btaff had classified them as comparatively harmless. The Governor General of Khuzistan and the more educated categories of the population were rot, hcwever, disposed to accept the airy assurances of Tehran. Could the deportees, whose homes had been broken up so suddenly and probably brutally be expected to let bygones be bygones and settle’ down as good Persian citizens in an environment which was strange and distasteful to them, and in jobs for which many of them were ill-fitted? Was it not the most natural .thing in the world that they should harbour feelings of revenge /against a Government2, against a Government which had dealt out such treatment to them? And would not the Russians carefully and con stantly nurse them so as to create a formidable destructive force? ^he Governor-General's protests were met by smooth replies from Tehran to the effect that he had r^lly no need for anxiety. He could always keep a close eye on the 'mu&amp;ajjirs' with the help of the police a-d he had the right to remove a y persons whose activities seemed undesirable. ith this he had to be satisfied; v ut he accepted the position with a bad gra«e, and he told me that the police force at his disposal was quite inadequate to watch over all these people, especially in the country districts where they could do unt*ld harm amongst the peasantry. 4. The Russian Consul in Ahwaz made the tactical error of getting into touch with the 'muhajjirs', immediately on their arrival in Ahwaz, through two of his agents. This did nothing to improve his own position vis-a-vis the Governor-General and the Divisional Commander, nor did it diminish the Governor-General's anxiety as to the role destined for the 'muhajjirs’' by the Russians. meanwhile these “muhajjirs' were being supported by the municipality of Ahwaz at a cost of 4,000 rials (about £50) per day, which was a most un welcome burden, and it was with relief that that body heard that the authorities had decided to disperse the iviuhajjirs and to let them fend for themselves, picking up such employment as they could. It was arranged that the ivluhajjirs should report to the police twice each week. It .was, however, one thing to disperse the muhajjirs to 'ferd for themselves' and another f«r the latter to get the wherewithal to live, m hey roamed the streets in desperate plight, a^d the authorities extracted 'voluntary' contributions from local merchants in an endeavour to keep the Auhajjirs »ff the G^vernor- Ge^eral’s doorstep until their absorption in a-y sort of employment could be secured. m he situation was complicated by the fact that, of the four hundred, only about one hundred and twenty ^ere employable, the remainder being women a-c. children. ■^y the middle of the month, the Auhaijirs neld at Dizful had also hran dispersed to do the best they could for themselves, either in that town or in tke surrounding agricultural district. At the same time, another seven hundred were se^t from the 'scree^iag' centre at Khorramabad to Arak, much to the disgust of the Governor there, who protested that he had enough poverty stricken people on his hands already. A similar number arrived i” ^urujird for absorption’in the town and in the agricultural district of silakhor. so the pOoition remain^ for the time being. ’T’here are no reports that a y more deportees are destined for Ahuzistan or Luristan. The Governor-General of Azerbaijan tnld me last November, however, that the 'cleaning up' process in Azerbaijan had only begun and that up to twenty thousand more political undesirables would be sent south in the soring.

An appreciable number of kp#wn and suspected * Russian agents made the journey to and from Tehran during the month a d the military and police auth#»t£ies kept a watchful eye on them.
