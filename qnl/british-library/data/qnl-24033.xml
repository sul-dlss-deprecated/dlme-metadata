IMPERIAL AIRWAYS LIMITED No.2 Operating Division Lieut. Colonel G. Lock, Political Agent, BAHREIN.Specification of Sun-dried Brick Hangar It is intended that this should he built of local f mutty f , and as this is an entirely new departure it is considered that the walls, to carry a height of 3C ft., should have a base of 12 ft. tapering to 3 ft. at the top. It is intended that the aircraft shall taxi as near to the enclosure as possible, turning with the tail to the enclosure, and that a hand-winch capable of towing the machine shall be fitted behind the rear wall of the shelter in order to permit the aircraft to be dragged in on its own wheels. A form of pulleys can be devised so that the winch can operate a machine in the enclosure at right- angles to it. It will thus be seen that it will be necessary to have a small apperture passing through the back wall of each enclosure. The following are roughly assessed figures of the quantities for two of these shelters. Eleven 53 ft. walls; 30 ft. high; base 12 ft. tapering to 3 ft. at the top:- Total length of walling 679 ft This estimated to require 2,843 tons of mud.

The ground le hard enough to withstand the weight. 3. The question of building with sun-dried bricks is impossible as the local mutty is not suitable. The wall will have to be built with coral stone and mud. \ ith this material half the length of wall will cost Rul8 f 000/-. The estimate prepared by the CVerseer of Public Works Department is enclosed herewith. 4. The walls should be built during the aur/mier.

I believe that all aerodromes which are in constant use are furnished with a complete first aid outfit, a stretcher and a supply of drugs, dressings etc. Owing to the present inaccessibility of Muharraq it would be sometime before medical attention could be obtained there and I think that it is in the interests of the public that the Imperial Airways should make suitable arrarge aents for dealing with any accidents which ai^nt occur.

Sir, 1 have the honour to report that I returned to Sharjah in H.M.S. Fowey on the 29th August. I was accompanied by Squadron Leader F.&lt;T. Fogarty, D.F.C., A*F.C., Officer Commanding 84 Squadron, Royal Air Force. I (Xu* disembarked at 8.15/and proceeded to the Rest House where I was informed that the Imperial Airways machine 'Horsa' was overdue at Bahrain and was reported -to be missing. Immediately I wired for the latest information from Bahrain and after consultation with Squadron Leader Fogarty instructed the Assistant Political Agent by wire to send letters by launch and, if possible, by air to the Shaikh of Qatar asking him to send out search parties at once. Later I ordered the Residency Agent, Sharjah to send similar messages to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. An ’’Atalanta” machine of Imperial Airways arrived during the afternoon and as Squadron Leader Fogarty was anxious to rejoin his Squadron/MMMMI Squadron, who, we had heard, were conducting the search, and I was anxious to return to Bahrain without delay, I requested that acconmodation be provided by Airways in their 'Atalanta*. This was done and the machine was placed at Squadron Leader Fogarty's disposal. We returned to Bahrain the following morning leaving Sharjah at day break and seaching the coast from Yas Island Westward for such a distance as the petrol supply of the machine would allow# During the flight a message was intercepted stating that 'Horsa' had been located 40 miles South of Salwa Wells# 2. On arrival at Bahrain I found that the Assistant Political Agent, Mr# J#B# Howes, had made adequate arrangements for every sort of emergency# I called on Group Captain W#B# Callaway, A#F#C., who was in charge of the search operations and discussed the situation# I found the passengers were! being brought in at once. The same evening the Group Captain and the Royal Air Force Medical Officer Wing Commander A. Briscoe, the Agency Assistant Surgeon, the Assistant Political Agent, and myself met the rescued passengers. The Captain of the H Horsa ,, and the Steward were left with the stranded plane. The passengers appeared tired, but otherwise unaffected by their experience. They were given soft drinks and then taken to Manamah where the local British residents looked after them and acconsnodated them in their houses. Doctor C.E. Hynes, the Agency Assistant Surgeon, visited all the passengers after dinner and in most cases administered sleeping drafts. The passengers continued their journey to India/BY AIR MA.IL To:- Adviser to the Bahrain Government. Prom:- Section Officer, Works &amp; Buildings Dept. , Basrah. Date:- 18th. April, 1935.

Advice has been received from the Air Ministry that standard aerodrome markings should be provided on the Civil aerodrome at Muharraq. I presume that there is no objection to this work being done as a charge against the Air Ministry? 2. So that the positions of the markings can be decided, would you be so kind as to let me have a plan of the area showing the boundaries of the aerodrome ? 3. Do you agree to carry out the work as an Agency service under the usual arrangements as regards cost? This procedure would be most convenient from our point of view. 4. If you agree to do the work for us, would you be so kind as to let me have an estimate for the work as stated in the enclosed brief specification ? It should be noted in connection with the latter that cement, snowcrete and bitumen paint will be supplied by the Air Ministry and will be delivered to you at Customs Wharf, Bahrain. Your estimate should include for transport of these materials from the Customs to the site of the work. 5. Lieut. Tutton will be in Bahrain on 3rd. April and 10th. and 11th. May and can discuss this matter with you and point out the actual positions of the markings to your representative. Signature af for Section Officer,W&amp;B. Basrah.
