(I) Moyexsnn t of the Beni Atlya, 1, The meeting first discussed two telegrams which had just been received from the Acting High Commies ion ex for Transjordan reporting that the Amir proposed to send a telegram direct to Xbn Baud informing Mm of the removal from Transjordan of the Beni Aliya and expressing the hope that they iwould obtain the King 11 ^ *pard©n and forgiveness* 8 . The Acting High Commissioner said that unless he heard to the contrary on the 1st of PRESENT s ® Group Captain R.E.C. Peirse, Air Ministry Mr. A.1% HorXey India Office November2 .

Further discussion, however, showed&lt; ( 1 wtradition Treaty, shewed that there might he advantage in haring the Akaha»l£aan frontier settled oace and for all, and that it might erea he feasible to link it up with the Treaty itself • Against this Mr* Eendel reminded the meeting that we should probably lose more than we gained, by seeding a definitive frontier in this region* The present JLe facto frontier had been laid down by His Majesty f s Government and had been based in part on geographical co-ordinates on an inaccurate map, and so far as our present information went it would probably turn out that when actually demarcated on the ground it would lie further north than we had intended. The result of a premature crystallization of the frontier might be that we should lose certain landing grounds new used by the Royal Air tforoe and, possibly more important, the new frontier might even bisect the Jebel Tubalk. After some discussion it was agreed that it would probably be better not to raise the question* (d) Reconditioning of the Bejaz railway in Saudi Arabia* - The previous decision that this could not be pursued was accepted* 10* As regards the form of the .Extradition Treaty, Sir Arthur Wauchope expressed his readiness to accept in principle provisions regarding political offenders similar to those contained in the Iraq-Hejd Treaty. These are that political offenders shall not be extradited, but that all the normal offences of tribes- men, including raiding, shall he regarded as extraditable offences« Mr. PerJtinaan asked what would happen in the case of dleagreement on a particular caee. Mr. Rendel thought thatM'i&amp;k a protocol (on the lines of the lraq«!£ejd Protocol) X^roTiding for arbitration on points in dispute arising out of both the Treaty of friendship and the Extradition Treaty which could not he settled through the ordinary diplomatic channel, would probably meet the ease, XI* The question what, if any, guarantees should he giTsii by His Majesty'*s Government was considered• It was stu. xx cientiy dear irom the existing correspondence that Ibn Baud would insist on some form of guarantee in respect of the Amiris good conduct before he accorded the latter recognition* The difficulty was to decide on how the guarantee should be given and to what extent Mis Majesty *8 Government should commit themselves * Sir Arthur $&amp;uchope felt sure tlmt the Amir would deeply resent giving a guarantee to His Majesty 5 ® Government unless Xbn Saud consented to do the same* He presumed that it would be impossible to obtain such a guarantee from lbs Baud and this was confirmed* 12* This being so, it would be for His Majesty*s Government to guarantee Abdulla 5 ® faithful performance of any treaty obligations which he might assume* This could be done in three ways, namely§« (a) An explanation to Ibn Baud of His Majesty 1 ® Government &amp; s general responsibility under the Mandate, followed by a bilateral treaty between the Amir and the King* |b) An Exchange of Hotes between His Majesty*» Government and Ibn Baud admitting an overriding responsibility based on the mandatory obligations, together with a bilateral treaty* (c) A tripartite treaty between His Majesty 1 ® Government and the Amir on the one side and Ibn Baud on the other side*13. It was generally agreed that in tlmtr eapacii as Mandatory for Transjordan, His Majesty®s &amp;sTernment would remain in faot legally responsible for Abdulla 1 s g^od behaviour, but that it would be exceedingly difficult to induce Xbn Saud to accept this general responsibility as sufficient guarantee that we would compel Abdulla to honour his treaty obligations 0 The danger of adopting solution {©) above (a tripartite treaty) was th&amp;t in case of any minor infringement of the treaty provisions by the Amir* Xfen Saud would almost certainly hold His Majesty^s Government immediately and directly responsible for setting the matter right, and that we should continually be embroiled in petty frontier disputes. For this reason it would be essential that any tripartita treaty should set up adequate local machinery for dealing with and settling frontier disputes, and should be draw up in other respects so as to reduce to a minimum the practical participation of His Majesty § s Government in carrying out the provisions of the Treaty. 14. It soon became apparent* however, that there was a divergence of opinion as to the advantages attaching to the three methods described above, and as to the tactios to be employed vis«A«»vis Xbn SaueU 15o Sir Arthur ? fauchope was inclined to favour a tripartite treaty as obviating the necessity for a separate guarantee for Abdulla * s good behaviour which might be offensive to the Amir. 16. Sir Andrew Byan was opposed to the tripartite treaty * He admitted that it would facilitate, from hie own point of view, the actual negotiations with Ibn Saud, but he was very apprehensive of the position in10 o © in which His Majesty's Government might fina themaelyee when called upon (as he thought they undoubtedly would he) t© carry out, or compel Abdulla to carry out, the detailed provisions of the Treaty. X? 6 Mr« Hendel saw little advantage in an attempt, which he personally felt would be unsuccessful* to induo® Ibn Saud to accept a guarantee on the lines of (a) or |b) above, i.e., a separate guarantee based on the mandatory obligations of Hie Majesty's Government. In any case he inclined to the view that a tripartite Treaty with adequate safeguards as to machinery would be the more satisfactory solutiono In the first place it would (as Bir Andrew Byan had admitted) greatly facilitate the actual negotiation of the Treaty with Xbn Saud since His Majesty's Minister at Xed&amp;ah would have a definite locus standi. Secondly, the fact that His Majesty's Government actually participated in the Treaty would tie the Amir's hands more effectively than had hitherto been possible and would render it more difficult for him to infringe the Treaty provisions. Thirdly* if such a Treaty existed and the Amir were to violate any of its provisions. His Majesty's Government would be in a position t® confront him with chapter and verse and would not as hitherto be forced to rely on unveriftable reports or supposition* Mr* Hendel suggested that the tripartite Treaty between Iraq and His Majesty's Government on the one side and Turkey the other side might possibly serve as a model in the present case* Under tlmt Treaty a Frontier Commission had been set up, which on the whole had worked well* and the occasions on which His Majesty's Government had beenllo called upon act in their capacity as pai vieip&amp;^ors in the Treaty had been comparatively rare. 18 ° Mr ° Warner Preferred that solution (a) should i c.e that we shoiald mahe a plain statement of our mandatory responsibility and then leave the two Rulers to conclude a Treaty. He pointed out that Ibn oaud has always wanted us to define our position in relation t© the Amir, alleging that we shift our ground to suit our own particular interests at any given moment. He thought that it should be unnecessary for His Majesty 9 s Government t© participate in the treaty tor the purpose of strengthening their position vis-a-vis the Amir. It was in hie view most important that, before any treaty between the Amir and 4 bn &amp;&amp;ua, was concluded, the Amir should? foe clearly warned that, since under Article 5 of the Transjordan Agrsenient His M&amp;jesty' s Government would be responsible loi, khe perfonnance of the obligations assumed by him under the proposed treaty, they would tolerate m violation of them, and would take the most serious measures against Mm in the event of such violation. If Mis Majesty 9 s Government thus put themselves in a position to ensure that the Amir performed his obliga tions, the question of the form of the proposed guarantee to be given by His Majesty 9 s Government ta Ibn Saud would became less important 0 But for the reasons advanced by Sir A s Ryan, Mr. Warner advocated an attempt at solution (a); if this failed we should fall back on fh) and (e) in that order, 19o Group Captain Peirse stated that the question ®f guarantees was of considerable interest to the Air Ministry, because of its bearing on military ccmmitmantSoc 13, ff the guarantees enable Ibn aaud to refer every tribal incident to Hi a Majesty's Government, then there might be constant calls for the intervention sf Imperial forces to put matters right which could have been more properly done by civil frontier control. On the other hand, experience of Abdullah' 1 s past conduct did not afford any certainty that he would refrain, even after wae advent oi a treaty, from the habitual intrigue which had hitherto seriously undermined the position of Imperial forces in Transjordan, Ifrom this point of view, therefore, it might be very advantageous that the guarantees should be se specific as to enable His Majesty's Government to keep Abdullah more rigidly to a correct attitude, 20« Mr* Williams thought tliere would some ( advantage in ending the present anomalous position by affirming our mandatory responsibility for the good conduct*. He pointed out that great care would hove to he exercised as to the degree of direct responsibility admitted. He was inclined to agree with Hr. Warner as to the tactic® to he adopted. » 21. Hr. Parkinson suggested that in view of the considerable divergence opinion on this question it was not practicable to arrive at a conclusion at the meetingp and that it would he necessary to&amp;mlt the considered views of the Foreign Office. 22.

The Amir described to me the following gentlemen as being the most important and dangerous men among the party in Palestine. AJaj Nuweihid Kamel Kassab Mabih el Azmi Amin Tarniml Ahmed Ulmi Sami Barr&amp;j Auni Abdel Had! Adll Arslan Subhi el Khadra. he advised me not only to have nothing to do with them but to do what 1 could to prevent their activities. first come to irans-Jordan he had quickly been approached by the Arab Indpendent rarty under whose influence he had fallen, he made some of them ministers in his first government. After a few years the demands wnich this party made on nim caused him t his Majesty's principal secretary of ofate 2. The Mir went on to describe how when he had get The Right Honourable Sir Philip Cunlif fe-Lister ,G. B. E. P. .etc. yetc. , for the Colonies.get into trouble with the British Government. The party expected Mm, among other things, to maintain a battalion and a few guns to be the nucleus for any Arab rebellion. The Amir stated that King Faisal had then been and still was a sincere syir.patrd.ser of the Arab Independent party and that he still provided them with some of their funds. la addition the party which was very clever at propaganda collected small sums from the fellahin. Eventually, after an ultimatum presented to the Amir by the British Resident, the Amir had dismissed from tils government the most prominent members of that party. Since that time he had had no dealings Whatsoever with them. The Amir said that this party promised Faisal that they would be able to control those sections of the population in Iraq who are at present at heart disloyal to King 'aissi. The Amir said that it was the bad advice of this party which had persuaded King Faisal to allow himself to fall into these difficulties with the French which had resulted in his loss of the Syrian throne. Finally, referring to the Ibn Rifada incident, the Amir said that though ne heartily disliked Ibn Sand he was not so mean a man that he would send rpen to kill him. The Amir concluded his talk by saying that this Arab Independent party thougn probably now incapableincapable of carrying out all they boasted, could yet prove dangerous to the British Government were they allowed freedom of speech and action. 3. The activities of this Party include the advocacy of non-cooperation with the British Government and severe criticism of all who do co-operate, it is. 1 tnihk, fortunate that most of its leaders are mucn disliked by the Amir Abdullah who gives them no support but there is reason to believe tnet King Faisal is friendly towards a number of their leaders and does give them moral support. 1 have etc. , (Bo) Arthur Wauchope f high Commissioner for Trans- Jordan.IP HIGH (&gt; $ ' , f '•» :/ I' / §■' ^ * W / v.

Your Excellency, I have the honour to inform you that General Wanehope spoke to me on the 6th Inst, on the question of the Bmi Atiya tribe and, after stating that he considered it necessary that some punishment over and above the punishment ordered by the Bedu Control Board should be inflicted on the tribe or a part of the tribe, ordered me to make a recommendation as to the form that punishment should take. sentence of three months Imprisonment, or a fine of one camel, which has been inflicted by the Bedu Control Board on those raiders who have been captured is inadequate and that the fine should have been two camels or preferably three. because although the raiders who were tried on the 23rd August were captured early in that month, the sentence provides that the oentence of three months M shall run as from the date of their detention viz. 20th June, 1932 H * 2. General Wauchope is of opinion that the The facts, however, are v/orse than this It | Excellency, The Acting High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan Jerusalem.0 It is inconceivable that Colonel Peake was aware of this, since the raiders only crossed into the Iledjaz on the 26th June, and there is reason to believe that this proviso was inserted into the text of the judgement after the judgment had been given. Amongst those sentenced were 4 Hov/eitat and they were the only persons who paid the fine, for they were not let into the secret of the curtailment of the terra oi imprisonment; all the Beni Atiya however were evidently given the tip and naturally preferred not to pay the fine but waited a few more days in prison and walked out on the 19th September only having been in prison for some 5 weeks* 3* There are other elements in the case which show the efforts of the Amir Shaker, in full consultation no doubt with the Amir, to make everything as light as possible for the Beni Atiya offenders* When the payment of £P* 182 blood money for the soldier who was killed was ordered by the Bedu Control Board, Shaker arranged that all the camels which had been seized from the Shoot should be released, a thing which never should have been done, since at least they should have been held till the blood money had been paid and in addition should have been held as a guarantee of payment of the fine to be inflicted on the raiders who had not yet been captured* These camels included a number belonging to Mohamed Ibn Farhads brother, if not to Mohamad himself* Twenty-one .. -^T 1 , !( 2 ) Twenty-one camels have been brought in as bloofl money and these were valued at £P,115 and have been placed by Shaker for safe keeping with the nem any n such time as the relatives of the deceased arrive to claim them* When it was pointed, out to him that the value of the camels was only £P.ll5, Shaker proposed to the Bedu Control Board that the value of the camels should oe arbitrarily raised, but this was not accepted* I have very good reason to believe that Daliah ex-Bela, one of the raid leaders, has recently been in Apnan and has spent the night in Shaker 1 a house. It is not difficult to imagine that the Beni Atiya are in a state of considerable elation that the Amir has been able to protect them from the consequence oi the acts which I believe to have been carried out at the Amir*s orders, nor is it difficult to imagine that they will form a ready instrument to his hand for any future enterprise. 4* In view of the above, I have entirely changed ray view as to the manner in which the Beni Atiya should be dealt with and recommend that, as a lesson to the tribe itself and also as a very necessary check to the Amir and Shaker, Your Excellency should instruct the Amir to cause the Beduin Control Board to issue orders as follows:- U) The fine of 10 camels which Palish ex-Zela, Mohamed Ibn Farhan, Mohamed Ibn Irsheid and Hammad Ibn Saleh have been ordered to pay shall be collected forthwith from the flocks of these men or those of their relatives up to the fifth degree*(2) All Beni Atiya raiders who set out during June last and who have yet Been tried will 'be tried at once in presence or* sbsence end. will Pe I'ined &amp; niiniintuii of 2 camels each* These animals to he collected “before the tribe leaves Trans-Jordan from the flocks of the men sentenced or from those of their relatives up to the fifth degree* (3) All Beni Atiya will he evacuated from Trans-Jordan Into the Hedjaz forthwith except such as have lived for the last 5 years at least in Keralc uninterruptedly or ouch others as obtainedpasses from the Officer Commanding the Desert Patrol* (4) The move will take place under the supervision of the Desert Patrol. The Officer Commanding the Desert Patrol will fix a date by which all Beni Atiya (less those exempted under 3 above) must be South of the Trans-Jordan /liedjaz frontier* After this date and until further orders all Beni Atiya found in Trans-Jordan (except those exempted above) will be liable to arrest, confiscation of their flocks and imprisonment not exceeding one year* (5) Such Beni Atiya as are permitted to remain in Trans-Jordan will in no case camp or graze South of the line Jaffaer - Jeruf el Derawish - Tafileh* (6) The Officer Commanding the Desert Patrol is empowered, at his discretion, to permit the entry into Trans-Jordan from the Hed*jaz of bona fide caravans coming to purchase food* 5* Speaking generally, the order of ejection will be made to apply to the portion of the Beni Atiya underunder the leadership of the Atiya Sheikhs (including the Shoot) and the exemption will he made to apply to the part of the tribe under Ibn Hennas. It Is the former who had taken part in the recent disturbances. 6. A copy of a memorandum written by Captain Glubb is attached* I have etc* (sgd) C.H.F.COX.

October 12, 1932. r ' ; I MlMOMHpiJii on THE BMl ATIYA ST^TWnrnTi. • &gt;ince I returaod. from leave a week ago, and in the absence of Colonel Peake, I have been very busy and have had little time carefully to investigate the present situation. I have, however, seen quite enough to convince me of its moot unsatisfactory nature and of the urgent need, of action if we are to avoid a repetition of the events of last summer vis-a-vis ibn Saud. I will state my reasons very briefly;- ( Q ) The Bedwin Control Board ;- Owing to the unrelenting efforts of the Bmlr Shakir, the sentences awarded by the Bedwin Control Board against the Beni Atiya raiders have been all released from prison and no fines have been collected* When I left, the Government held about 150 Beni Atiya Camels, and more than half the raiders and Sheikhs were in prison. The tribe was in very low fettle. The situation is now completely reversed, and the tribe is now full of swagger and boasting of their immunity from punishment. (b) It is reported that messengers from the Biair are frequently proceeding backwards and forwards between Amman and Kerak. The Sheikhs of the Beni Atiya are being frequently called to Amman, where they stay with His Highness.(c) It is reported that nessengers from His Highness recently visited the Beni Atiya, where the Sheikhs were collected and persuaded to hind themselves by oath to make things as bad as they could for any member of the tribe who gave information to myself or to men of the Desert Police, (d) Of course as soon as the Beni Atiya raiders were released from prison by the Amir Shakir, they went up to the Mace to stay with His Highness, In the presence of a member of them and of several Ma;Jalli Sheikhs from Kerak, His Highness abused Mit f ab Xbn Jami (Hweitat) who called to pay a formal visit, accusing him of being a traitor who had ruined the Bedwins by acting as a spy for Abu Hunaik* His Highness also stated in public that he was sorry to see that Ahid Bey (My Arab Officer Assistant), a man who had once served the Sherifs, was not a traitor and was An attack was also delivered in the Legislative Council on the Desert Patrol and on the two Arab Officers in it, whose services, it was proposed, should be dispensed with* Attempts have also been made by the Amir Shakir to bring pressure on the Desert Patrol Sergeant Commanding the Police Post with the Beni Atiya* All these moves are Intended to terrorise the Desert Patrol to prevent them from carrying out their duties amongst the Beni Atiya* (e) That portion of the Beni Atiya under the leadership of the Atiyat Sheikhs, namely those who have been playing a leading part in the recent disturbances are camped together Bast of Kerak. It is stated, however, that they serving Glubb and the English* do( 1 ) do not propose moving into the Desert this year or going to the Hejaz, but that they will pass the Winter in the Ghor in Trans-Jordan* All these and other signs, convince me that their Highnesses, fax* from abandoning their schemes, are busily employed preparing some new coup, and that for this purpose they are keeping these sections of the Beni Atiya under their hands, and are also trying to terrorise or corrupt the Desert Police, whom they regard aa the chief obstacle to their plans. When the next coup will come off, I am not in a position to say. In my own opinion, the correct procedure would be to take action to prevent their Highnesses from continuing these intrigues. If this cannot be done, the only alternative would seem to be to remove one of their chief weapons out of their hands. I suggest for this purpose, that the Atiyat sections of the Beni Atiya be immediately exx&gt;elled to the Hejaz. There are other sections of the tribe who have taken no part in the disturbances and there are Beni Atiya who have lived in Kerak for many years and so on. This makes it impossible to say that all Beni Atiya must be evicted. I can, however, differentiate them when the time cornea, I suggest further that any Beni Atiya who remain in Transjordan should be given permits by me, and, in any case, be bound to remain North of a line Juffer-Juruf el Derawish - Tafila. To prevent those evicted from immediately trickling back, some threat is required as inserted below. The order should, I suggest, be something as follows 5 -Atiya will be evacuated from Transjordan forthwith, excepting such as have lived for the last 5 years at least in Kerak uninterruptedly, or such others as obtain passes from the 0,C.

Trans-Jordan No. 143. Repeated to Jedda No.133, With reference to your telegram No. 135 Beni Atiya. If the action which you propose ie taken we shall naturally be precluded from treating these sections of the Beni Atiya in future ae owing allegiance to Trans-Jordan or as being liable to Trane- Jordan taxation, it must also be realised that the fact that it wiLi have been possible to enforce the removal of a large section of a tribe from Trans-Jordan to Hejaz and to take measures against their return may in spite of view as expressed at D in your Wlegram limit the freedom of His Majesty's Government in the coniernplated negotiations for a treaty between Trans-Jordan and Saudi Government. On the other hand 1 am impressed by your view that if Beni Atiya remain in Trans^Jordan they will be a useful instrument in the hands of the Amir in case further disturbances occur in Bo jag in which it will be difficult to prevent them from taking Part. Moreover it would be a matter of the greatest difficulty now tha v the Saudi Government have agreed to their return to go Back on arrangement proposed. I am prepared to approve the proposed action provided that you are satisfied the following points to which special importance is attached by the High Commissioner who has been consultedconsulted,, (1) That such action is in itself advisable and that it is recoraaended not merely in view of instruction given by him before leaving Palestine that some action must be taken to mark Government 5 s displeasure at past misconduct of tribesmen. U’) That- Giubb can effect the move without risk of bloods! d, From the enclosures in your secret despatch of Ihth October I infer that you are in fact satisfied on these points and 1 observe from point (2) on page 3 of the second enclosure that it is not proposed to effect the move by force but to subject all those not obeying the order by a fixed date to certain penalties to be imposed in Trans-Jordan, so that in fact tile u ’ il ' e be 8 iven choice between emigration and punishment in Trans-Jordan.

No® 140. tfith reference to my telegram No. 135, the British Resident at Amman has reported this evening that the Beni Atiyah have just begin to move into the Wadi Araba. This ie a locality from which it would be very difficult indeed to move them across the frontier. The Air Officer Commanding shares this view, since the Arab Legion would not be able to operate in the Wadi Araba with cars and it would therefore be necessary to employ some other forces. Even were other means employed it is possible that the attempt might fail. If approval can be given tomorrow (Wednesday October 26th) by telegram the trickle which has just begin will not affect the practicability of making move. After tomorrow difficulties would increase and if move cannot begin by end oi this week at latest I should have to advise that the project should be abandoned. I hope immediate approval can be given.

The matter has been discussed with High Commissioner who states that as regards disciplinary measures your proposal goes much further than what he- had. cent ©plated* Understand that he had previously suggest that puriishiaent should take the form of forbidding the return of Beni Atiya. to Trans-Jordan territory after voluntary migration t Hsjas* Fleas© inform me what were the objections to adoption o feat suggestion* The following possible objections to your proposal suggest themselves® 1» Hitherto it has been understood that it would not be practxeabje to compel bodies of tribesmen to cross frontier against their will or to prevent Tribesmen thus expelled from attempting to return without resort to degree of force involving nsk of bloodshed more especially if accompanied by women and * children as presumably they would ba in this instance® Can you assure m that Beni Atiya could be moved across frontier without possibility of bloodshed? Kven if you, are sura that bloodshed could be avoided would any measure of force be required? &lt;h In view of attitude of Saudi Government please see fettda telegram to you Mo«349 there is clearly the risk of Ben Aiiyad s maltreatment on arrival in He jag for which if they &lt;Ve spelled by the Trane Jordan authorities to cross into Hejai(S) Hejaa His Majeaty'e Goveiriment cannot escape a measure of responsibility and may in consequence be exposed to serious criticism* 3. The contemplated action would be ineonei stent with previous practice and policy as indicated in replies given to the Saadi Government-s requests for the exclusion or handing over of tribesmen. in any event an awkward precedent would be created if further demands for surrender of tribesmen are received or if the Saadi Government again press that tribesmen should be turned bask from frontier. Whole question of expulsion or exclusion of tribesmen from Trans Jordan may arise in connection with contemplated negotiations for general settlement. Although it may be desirable to reconsider our present policy would not proposed action prematurely comait us to its reversal. 4. Proposal would imply recognising as subjects of Ibn Saud sections of Ben Atiya to be excluded. This objection however would seem to apply to some extent to the alternative suggestion put forward by the High Commissioner and it may be that it is not considered of importance in present circumstances. See however Glubb'a memorandum enclosed in your secret despatch 'A* of 10th ueptamber on this and other relevant points. If, on the other hand, your proposal to which Saudi Government have now agreed were not now carried out the following consequences may be anticipated which from point of view of foreign relatione would be most undesirable. 1» Ihe Saudi Government would probably misinterpret our action and regard it as a piece of duplicity on the part of His Majesty's Government. 2. Ihe Saudi Government might well attribute change of plan fa intaivention by an undue influence of Amir over His Majesty’s Government(3 Government and their Representatives in Trans-Jordan. 3 * The riek ref0rred to in Paragraph 5 of your telegram of )eni Atiya joining in further insureotion against Ibn Saud would remain* Please telegraph fully your viewe in the light of thie telegram so that a decision may be taken in consultation with iiigh Commissioner. X shall be glad at the sane time to be” informed what alternative disciplinary measures you can suggest against Ben Atiya if your present proposal ie not proceeded with. In the event of it being decided not to move the Ben Atiya as you now propose i will advise you as to the form in which Hia Majesty's Government decide to make communication to Saudi Government, Repeated to Jedda Wo..131.a PARAPHRASE telegram from the Secretary of State for tlie Colonies to the Acting High Commissioner for Trass Jordan» (Sent 8„0 p.m. 14th October 1932).

As a result of Beni Atiya raids under Ibn Farhan in June (see- my telegram of lat of July No. 60) Bir Arthur fauchope considered that whether they had been instigated by Amir and shaker or not, some action should be taken against tribe to marl displeasure at their behaviour. The Bedouin control board imposed a sentence of three months imprisonment or a fine of one camel on each of the captured raiders* The High Commissioner considered this punishment inadequate ^ but even this punishmenl was not imposed in full. The result is that the Beni Atiya are not chastened bm, elated by belief that the Amir bean able to protect then iram the consequences of their acts. That situation holds possibilities dangerous in the future if Saudi Arabia is attack* I from any direction since Beni Atiya will be handy instruments for ill“intenttoned parsons* In these circumstance Colonel Cox recommends (and I agree) that it is necessary to take drastic measures against ^ribe bath as a lesson to them and to prevent them from being used by others in future* If for any reason Saudi Government is averse from allowing them to enter Hejaft I should not propose to carry out move ° this reason I telegraphed to Jeddah and left a week s &amp; interval after which if no objection is raised I propose to info mAmir to whom the decision will be most unpalatable and to move the tribesmen accordin^y* Addressed to Secretary of State for Colonies telegram No« 131 repeated to Jeddah, No. 1^17,, your telegram No-, 135« !I r. - • -&gt; m : i±zu iiiii • Deoypher.

He considers that troubles in Ibn Baud’s dominions likely sooner or later because the latter’s Government is oppressive and he has many enemies in Hejas and ^ejd but Amir undertakes 'to do nothing to assist such risings should they occur, I consider Amir's present intention is ’to refrain irom any action against ibn Gaud but I believe that he is a till ln with malcontents in Hej^s and knowing the weakness of ki® character it is impossible to be confident of his future actions e There are reasons for supposing that funds for r ©bellion of Ibn Bifada were provided by ex~Khediv@ and that he Wo ^id support further rebellion if success were probable.

Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received Auqust 30 'l (No. 340.) * „ Jedda, Auqust § 1932 WITH reference to my telegram No. 151 of to-day, I have the honour'to enclose herewith translations of Sheikh Yusuf Yasin’s x ‘ Secret and private’’ letter to me of the oth August and the ‘ c personal and private ’ ’ memorandum with one enclosure which accompanied the letter. The letter and memorandum were typed on the official paper of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and bore a Foreign Affairs file number. I would ask you to excuse the sometimes peculiar English of the translations, as I wish to send them off as soon as possible and have preferred not to alter too much my translator’s efforts at a literal rendering. 2. Sheikh Yusuf left Jedda for Taif on the 1st August and returned on the 5th August. In the interval, both he and Fuad Bey Hamza had written me letters dated the 3rd August announcing that the latter had taken over the work of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 3. When I received the translations of the documents on the evening of the 6th August, I was genuinely mystified as to their character. I at once wrote a private letter to Sheikh YuSuf pointing out that his letter had been written two days after he had vacated the Ministry, but on the Ministry’s paper. I asked whether I was to regard it and the enclosures as papers which had reached me through the Ministry and which I was free to discuss with the Acting Minister (i.e., Fuad Bey) or as having been addressed to me in such a special manner that I should consider them secret from anyone in this country except the King, Sheikh Yusuf, myself and the necessary members of my staff. 4. ^In the meantime Fuad Bey had also arrived in Jedda. On the evening of the 7th August I saw him and Sheikh Yusuf together at their invitation, Sheikh Yusuf not having yet answered my question. 5. It rapidly became apparent that the King had sent Sheikh Yusuf specially to Jedda, but that Fuad Bey was fully aware of the contents of the documents. The idea seemed to be (technically, at any rate, for the King may have had a more obscure motive) that Sheikh Yusuf knew more of what had preceded and should therefore collaborate with Fuad Bey. They rather lost themselves in subtleties as to their personal roles, but I established the main point and proceeded to offer the comments summed up in my telegram under reference. I need add little to what I have stated in that telegram. I emphasised the gravity of the new turn which the King had given to the matter and my disappointment at his having rejected every suggestion I had made in recent conversations. I tried to get the question of King Feisal’s intervention into what I conceived to be its true p&gt;erspeetive and to elucidate the meaning of the last paragraph of His Majesty’s memorandum. This had somewhat baffled my translator, to whom it recalled the style of the late King Hussein. I gathered that what the King wanted was to induce His Majesty’s Government to take action on the basis of one of his two alternatives, which would obviously rule out any further possibility of useful intervention by King Feisal, but that if pressed to accept the suggestion of the latter he would do so. 6. Fuad Bey came to see me alone this morning and we had some further conversation on the subject. We covered a good deal of the same ground as last evening, but I indicated more precisely my general views. I urged that it was a great pity to destroy all that had been done, on lines previously agreeable to the Hejazi Government, to promote a general settlement between Hejaz-Nejd and Transjordan. Fuad Bey suggested that in one respect I was exaggerating the King’s change of outlook and that His Majesty had never contemplated a settle ment with Transjordan to which His Majesty’s Government would not be in some wa y parties. I admitted that this point had never been cleared up and that the Question of the form of any settlement was 1 one which presented difficulty for His Majesty’s Government themselves. What really alarmed me, I said, was the [542 gg—1]2 King's assertion of invincible enmity and mistrust towards the Amir Abdullah and his insistence that nothing would satisfy him except formal guarantees by 7 Fuad Bey told me that he had been present when the King of Iraq had spoken to the Amir about the possibility of his intervening and that he had himself expressed the view that his Government could not for the time being take advantage of King Feisal’s suggestion, as they had sought the mediation of His Maiesty’s Government. I observed that I myself had foreseen this objection, but tVmf it bad been removed bv my communication to oheikh Yusuf Yasin on the 31st July regarding His Majesty’s Government’s approval of the proposal. 8 I need not reproduce the remainder of my conversation with Fuad Bey, which ranged round many subjects connected with the mam issues. I am afraid that the one fact which emerges from all this talk and writing is that Ibn Saudi’s attitude towards the Amir Abdullah has hardened, not inexplicably, into a vindictiveness so extreme as to ruin any immediate hope of a settlement satis factory to all parties and I doubt whether the idea of using King Feisal as a deus ox machina can be usefully pursued for the moment. YVriting, as I do, in a state of depression, I may be taking too gloomy a view. 9 In view of the nature of the King’s communication I have felt bound to communicate it only to you, Sir, and leave you to decide whether to consult His Majesty’s High Commissioner for Transjordan. I have dealt on other hues with the enclosure in His Majesty’s memorandum, as it has an immediate bearing on the investigations now proceeding in Jerusalem and Aden regarding the Ad-Dabbagh plot. I told Fuad Bey that I proposed to inform the authorities at those two places, and any other British authorities tvho might be interested, of the contents of Taher Ad-Dabbagh’s letter, unless he definitely asked me not to do so. He preferred not to express a view, probably because the letter had reached me from the King, so I adhered to my plan. I have, &amp;c. A MTYRT7W A AT Enclosure 1 in No. 1. (Translation.) Sheikh Yussuf Yasin to Sir A. Ryan. (Secret and Private.) Dear Sir Andrew Ryan, Jedda, August 5, 1932. I INFORMED you in my conversation with you before I left Jedda on the 28th Safar, 1351 (sic, but corrected orally on the 7th August to 28th Rabk al Awwal, 1351, i.e., the 1st August, 1932), that my Government, before deciding the question of His Majesty King Feisal’s mediation in the matter of Trans jordan, contemplated discussing the matter in all its aspects. Meanwhile, His Majesty my Lord the King has ordered me to send privately to your Excellency a personal memorandum from His Majesty to the British Govern ment with a view to setting forth the position ms-d-vis of Transjordan. I shall be glad if this memorandum may be considered personal and private, so that it may enlighten discussions in future and explain the personeJ point of view oi His Majesty in regard to that position. With highest respects, Yours sincerely, YUSUF YASIN. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Memorandum. (Translation.) WE wish to set forth hereby, in a personal and private manner, our position ■vis-d-vis of the Sharif Abdullah in Transjordan from the beginning until now, and we should like to set forth also the ways we think fit for the solution of the difficulty between us and Transjordan. 2. Since we came to the Hejaz, the Sharif Abdullah has been a source of preparing forces and despatching them to Jedda to fight against us there when his brother the Sharif Ali was fighting us there, and Transjordan was used for his (i.e., Ali s) sake as a basis for hostile actions against us.3 3. ih.6 fexitirif Abd 11 ll 3 .l 1 did not sp&amp;iG 3iiy pains in causing disturbance and insurrections against us in the Hejaz and even in Nejd too. He used to urge the tribes 111 the name of Britain and Egypt, and declare that he acted in accordance with their advice and help as he used to induce the Bedouin to rebel against us. 4 . He has gathered about him some of the people who work against our country and rule, like those of the sons of Ad-Dabbagh, As-Sabbans and other Hejazis who have established for themselves a political centre at Amman with a view to committing hostile actions against us. 5 . We send you herewith a copy of a letter,Q addressed to the Sharif Shaker by Muhammad Yehia (sic, but corrected later to Taher) of Yemen showing the strength of those evil actions and the endeavours exerted to spite us and to harm our country. 6. He used to promise the Bedouin that he was ready to send out a force from his side so that they may assemble around it and make a revolt against our rule. We, on our part, used to disbelieve that rumour, believing that he could not do such a thing so long as the British Government were directing Trans jordan, and the British Government are friendly with us and there are treaties of friendship between us and them. But on finding that those rumours had some truth, we communicated them to the British Government, but in the first instance they did not pay any attention to them. They then ascertained the news and informed us of the occurence of the incident. The suspicion we previously had concerning the actions of the Sharif Abdullah against us has become an established belief and an actual fact. 7. The British Government may say that these activities are not those of the Sharif Abdullah. If they have proofs of his innocence of these activities and will inform us of them, and if they can fix the accusation on another person, then we may be somewhat reassured as to the disposition of the Sharif Abdullah. It should be borne in mind, however, that a person like Ibn Rifada, who has not sufficient money to pay for the clothes he wears, cannot undertake such a movement nor gather round himself such a number of people. 8. It has, in effect, been proved that Ibn Rifada received some assistance from Transjordan which he could not have obtained without the help of a capable and able person, very different from wdiat he himself is. The British Government informed us that Ibn Rifada, when he first entered Aqaba, was able to purchase supplies and arms before they (His Majesty’s Government) took measures to prevent his making purchases. It has also been proved that someone in Trans jordan helped him in the matter of the dhow which was arrested by the British warship and w/hich, there is not doubt, was carrying supplies for Ibn Rifada. There is also the question of A1 Kabriti, of which we have already informed you. This is a. proof of the kind of assistance afforded to Ibn Rifada. In addition to all that has been mentioned there is the matter of the dhow that went to Suez to bring supplies for him, but was prevented from doing so. 9. All these incidents prove one thing clearly which cannot be doubted, namely, that Ibn Rifada, the fugitive, cannot have arranged all these things, and that the matter was planned and arranged by someone else. 10. It is evident from what we have mentioned, from his frequent state ments published in newspapers as emanating from him, and also from the con versations exchanged between him and those people, he received to the effect that he is our enemy, that all this was planned by the Sharif Abdullah and with his knowledge and encouragement. We do not blame the Sharif Abdullah because he is our enemy and there is no agreement or covenant between us. The agree ments and covenants are between us and the British Government, for whose sake we have refrained much and overlooked more of what we feel in our heart against him. 11. This private memorandum has two objects :— (1) A strong protest against the activities of Sharif Abdullah which are contrary to friendship and £ c bon-voisinage ” and the wishes of the British Government. (2) An enquiry as to the way in which we may be reassured with regard to our souls and our country, and in which we may in future preserve our friendship with the British Government in regard to Transjordan. p) Not printed.4 12 We know for certain that the British Government are as anxious for the consoUdatkn of tothat thTv fffis Majesty's Government) P think best in this respect, our firmly- est^hshed fr endship and reciprocal interests cause us to express our opinion to them with complete frankness and freedom without circumlocution or flowery lan™ Ou“ excuse for this is that we are speaking to a friendly Government, language, uui e. r ] without Daying attention to any diplomatic or whom we consider ^complete confidence that if the British international considerations. We say witn complete of thmr. rrwprnment desire complete rest such as will ensure the maintenance ot their interests inhransjordan' without costing them anything and without disturbance or trouble from ushr from anyone else and ^^^hrians tethfst ment with Transjordan, they will not be able to find the tiue means tor this so Ion 0, as the Sharif Abdullah is in Transjordan. long as me ag sincere friends of the British Government who are desirous of helping them and preserving the best and most friendly relations and understanding with them, is that one of two things should be done, first, i is more in the interests of England herself than it is in ours that the bhanf Abdullah Slid be removed, and that a trustworthy person whether English or Arab or Transjordanian or another, having their (t e., His Majesty s Government s) interests at heart, should be appointed by the British Government, buch a person would not seek to pick a quarrel with us and would have no intention of interfering in our internal affairs. He might not be a person agreeable to us but still in any case he would safeguard British and Transj ordan interests. In the event of such a change we could give the British Government a promise to fulfil their wishes with regard to keeping peace on the frontier and to afford all possible assistance to that official, inside or outside Transjordan, as British interests may require. This request of ours, although it may be regarded as outspoken, is nevertheless offered from a sincere friend to a sincere friend in the interests of the latter, especially if one considers the position and status of the Sharif Abdullah, not as being the lawful possessor of the country, but as one who, by force of circum stances, has been appointed like nny other British official for the preservation 01 the interests of Britain itself and of Transjordan. Secondly, if the British Government insist on the Sharif Abdullah remaining, we, while recognising that the appointment of the Sharif Abdullah, his confirmation therein or his disposal therefrom, is a matter for the British Government, and that we have no right to oppose it or to question it, are constrained, as a result of his activities in the past and in the present, to have no confidence in him nor to believe in his promises, more especially when we consider that he follows his own selfish desires in every matter, disregards his promises, is obstinate and oppresses the country at the head of which he has been placed. If the British Government insist on this and guarantee the neutrality of Transjordan and its non-interference in onr affairs, then we will trust their guarantee and feel assured that no interference or equivocation will take place. In that case the Sharif Abdullah should cease from all his activities and foregatherings, both hidden and open. 14. In this connexion we wish to affirm that the object of what we have mentioned is not to challenge the Sharif Abdullah nor the hope of gaining possession of Transjordan, nor to request the British Government to do something outside their power. The object is to safeguard our country, to prevent differences arising with the British Government and to fulfil the promises to them which we have given and will give. 15. With regard to the suggestion made by His Majesty King Feisal to our son Eeisal, as intimated to us by the British Government, we look upon it as gracious act on the part of His Majesty intended for onr welfare and that of the British Government and Transjordan. The mediation of His Majesty, however, cannot ensure to us our desiderata as he cannot be a guarantor for his brother, neither do we accept such a guarantee because he would then be unable to execute his guarantee and unable to bear its consequences. Now that we have explained our ideas to the British Government, the decision in the matter depends on the attitude which they take up. So, if they see that the interest lies in any course let them take that course, and if thev see that the interest requires the acceptance of the mediation of His Majesty King Feisal they know better than we in this respect.

He received the representatives in a series of formal audiences in the forenoon. His graciousness, when my turn came, left nothing to be desired. I had not seen His Majesty for fourteen months and had in the interval heard very varying accounts of his physical state. On this occasion both Mr. Wikeley, who accompanied me, and I myself were struck by his appearance of good health, though Mr. Wikeley thought he had put on a good deal of flesh in a part of his anatomy which I was not noticing. He was quite lively in the backchat of compliment. 2. I had not intended to seek a further audience as I felt that I could neither avoid nor usefully discuss the situation between Hejaz-Nejd and Trans jordan until you had considered it further. Fuad Bey Hamza, however, was keen on my doing so, and I authorised him to say that, although I had nothing to lay before the King, I should be grateful if His Majesty would receive me in case he had anything to say before we left for Nejd and England respectively. The audience was arranged for this afternoon. At the outset, I presented to the King Commander A. R. Farquhar, of H.M.S. “ Penzance,” which, by an unintended coincidence, arrived at Jedda on the same day as Ibn Saud. 3. After Commander Farquhar had retired, the King and I, with Fuad Bey interpreting, engaged in a general conversation on the present situation; but one so very general that it wmdd be useless to weary you with its details. The King reaffirmed all his familiar principles, his friendship for and belief in Great Britain, his desire to receive and to be guided by her advice, &amp;c., and proclaimed his unshakable fidelity to them, subject only to the qualifications that she must safeguard his honour and his interests. I gave all the usual replies, with illustrations drawn from various sources, including the attitude observed by His Majesty’s Government during the Ibn Rifada affair. 4. The fact is that both His Majesty and 1 were talking, and talked for an hour, platitudes with a purpose. That of the King was to prove that no gentle man, however reasonable, could feel safe with a person like the Amir Abdullah over his border; mine to instil the idea that to the practical British mind the Ibn Rifada affair appeared a matter which had been finished with, that permanent enmity was not a practical basis for the relations between rulers and that a fresh start should be made. We might have come to closer grips with the real subject of the conversation, if I had not had to make way for the Soviet Minister, who had already been kept waiting a quarter of an hour. 5. As it was neither of us put a name to the Amir Abdullah, who so filled our thoughts, but the King mentioned King Faisal as a most commendable monarch with whom, thanks to His Majesty’s Government, he was on the best of terms. It is all the rage now in high Hejazi circles to represent the King of Iraq as a good Arab, un homme seriewx, in contrast with his brother Abdullah, who is regarded as the incarnation of intrigue and untrustworthiness. ^ } 6.

My dear Williams, Warner tells me that he has had a conversation v;ith Blaster on the subject of he memorandum prepared by Ryan on the evidence of the iiialr Abdullah^ complicity in Ibn RifGda , s rebellion. X understand that you would like, if we have no objeetion, to send cooies of the memorandum to Wauchope and Reilly. I certainly agree that this is desirable and enclose two further copies of the memorandum for this purpose. I may say that e agree generally with its conclusion. I understand that Blaster and Warner discussed the desirability of asking Wauchope to consider whether action could not, and should not, be taken against some of those in the .*mir hanHah’s entourage who seem clearly to have been deeoly involved the object being to show that the British authorities are determined to put a stop to intrigue in Transjordan against a friendly power and to break up the anti-Ibn Baud organisation in the vicinity of die Amir. X think there would be definite advantages in doing this. The principal persons in question seem to be the Amir Shakir, Abdul Raouf el Sabban and Hamid Pasha el Wadi. You will have seen some evidence recently that the intrigues against Ibn Baud’s regime in the Hejaz are still going on in the hope of raising another rebellion in the Hejaz and Asir, and much the same people seem to be involved. I think youyou will agree that it is desirable from every point of view, if possible, to put an end to such activities. For this reason we should be glad to see action taken against the persons mentioned above and any o hers of those apparently implicated whom Wauchope might suggest, e,g. the Kebriti brothers, the Bedawis and Shanpiti. The precise form the ^action” could take can only, I think, be left to Wauohope to decide. Apart from the documents on which Ryan’s memorandum is based there is as you know a good deal of other evidence of a secret nature to which he has not had access. ^All of this I think has been communicated in some form or another to Vauehope. I would suggest therefore that if you send Ryan’s memorandum to Wauchope and ask him, as suggested above, to consider the possibility of taking action against the principal Transjordan intriguers, you should also send him a private letter drawing attention to he corroborative nature of much of this information. You may think it worth adding that, if Vauchope’s staff are not in a position to examine the evidence contained in this secret information and to collate it %ith that in Ryan's memorandum, we here will if necessary be ready to do so. It may be well too, I think, in the proposed private letter to Wauchope to draw his attention to .he evidence to which I have referred above, that intrigues are still going on. (Sd.) G.W.R IIIFJ;.12 . 4737A6A5) Memorandum 'by Sir A. Ryan on the -Doasihle connexion of the Amir hdullah and/or hie entourage with recent attempts to undermine Ibn Baud. This memorandum is based on the evidence available in Jedda uo to September 1st and one other naner given me by Commander Farquhar of ’’Penzance'', viz. a statement by a fugitive into Transjordan, one of many, I understand, taken at kaba. I have not had time to suonly marginal references, as I had honed, in suooort of the various statements, but I attach a short list showing the orineioal sources and the documents nro- duced by the Hejazi Government. These include what I call the 'Coy Story”, oublished in the Umm-al-Qura newsoaoer of August 26th. s this has not yet been sent home, I attach a full account of it, based on a translation made only a few days before I left Jedda and not yet corrected (see the note aooended to the enclosure). I assume the authenticity of the docu ments adduced by the Hejazi Government. In some cases I have seen and handled the originals and believe them to be genuine. I do not think the Hejazi Government have much equioment for faking this sort of thing and any exoert faker would have been more thorough. The Hejazi Government may have more evidence up their sleeves. I divide the subject matter under seven heads. (l) Proceedings of Ibn 31 fa da. 2. Hamid Ibn Balim Ibn Rifada, nicknamed al-Awwar, belonged to the leading family in the Bill! tribe, which hashas also an urban establishment at .ejh. Hie relative, not I think father, uleyman asha Ibn Hifada, nlayed a role of some Importance during the Great War, hedging between Turk and Haehimite. This Hamid left Tiejh in 1926 or 1929 after an abortive rising against Ibn .and. He seems to have snent his time subsequently at Afcaba, in aleetine and at various Places in /.gym and to have eventually taken up with Muhammad Abu 'weilem of hubra near Cairo, who gave him the use of a niece of ground to csmo on. This man states that Ibn Rifada stayed with him for about a year ending some months before July 1952. He used to wander about for periods of twenty or fifteen days collecting alms etc. t the end of this stay he left and did not return till oril. He again left later and disappeared from the ken of Abu Sweilera. 5. ccording to Hejaal information, otherwise un confirmed, Ibn Rifsda, having gone to mman, obtained a Transjordan certificate of naturalisation No. 216 of March 31st, 1932. It is certain that on April 2nd he was given a Transjordan pass port at Amman, No. IT 81. On oril 5th he had this vied at the .gyntian Consulate at Jerusalem, one of his guarantors being Hamid as ha 1 fa&amp;i. On oril 6th he was admitted into iigyot at Kantara for a period not to exceed a month. 4. It is to be noted in this connexion that early in June, the Amir Abdullah told Colonel Cox that Ibn Rlfada f s last visit to Amman was in R&amp;madhan, which ended on or about February 9th. On July 7th he admitted to General ggggggmmGeneral Wauchone the issue of the pasenort* justifying it hy the statement that up to that time Ihn lUfada hah committed no crime and adding that he had advised him to live quietly in Kygpt* 5. The fugitive rebel Bilal Ibn Masud states that about five days before the Feast of Sacrifice, i.e, about oril 11th, being then in bgynt, he heard from other Heja^is that Ibn ifada was going to start from - yg^t to kill Ibn ©ud; that he had recently visited the Amir bdullah at mman where everything had been arranged; and that men were wanted for the expedition. Bilal visited him at hubra, where there were many visitors, refugees belonging; to the Howeitat and Bill! tribes. Ibn 'ifada sooke ooenly to his guests, saying “I have 'just returned from a visit to Amir bdullah and he is ’’going: to send soldiers to conquer the Hejaz and T am '’aooolnted as their leader and wish to enlist as many of r 'you as my soldiers as possible”. ccording to the same witness he promised £b a month for footmen and £6 for cameimen. He said that as soon as they arrived at Akeba there would be arms and nay waiting for them. These would be provided by • herlf Abdullah and sherif - heki'! 1 v. ould await the men ni ' kaba to distribute them. Bilal was given . 40 and he and his son were sent to &gt;uez by motor with five others at Tbn Fifed© f s expense. ole goes on to describe the movements of theses and other parties and those of Ibn ALfada. Muhammad bu Tuqeyca joined uo on the road from Tor to Akaba. The rebels, he Bays, arrived at kaba by night and went round behind the hills to oharif*. He remarks on the secrecy observed and how the leaders feared to show themselves in kaba.(s) The only erms he mentions in connexion with the expedition so far were four or five rifles bought t&gt;y Ibn Rifada at Tor. Flour end ri«e were brought to ciharia fron kaba and a few rifles were sent over by A1 Kabriti. 6. Bilal's evidence is valuable, as being that of a simple man given after all hope was lost. Hie further statement supports other indications which destroy the imnression created by the first official reports that Xbn Hifada made a dash from dinai straight into the Hejaz with an organized force of from 400 to 450 men. Many matters connected with the organization of the rebellion before and after tbn Pifa da crossed the frontier are obscure. They are dealt with in this oarer only in so far ; s they are relevant to its main subject and any estimates of numbers are given with reserve, as they are not material enough to the issue to need closer examination, even if it were oossible. I will deal with the more or lees relevant matter under five heads ae follows. ?. Or It. In and Mobilisation of th e jqfltfilfr 11 seems nretty certain that not more than one hundred and fifty men started from dnai in the first instance. Kven that number, according: to Egyptian statements supported by British authorities in Hygot , could not have left linai as an organized armed force. On May 10th Xbn Hi fade, himself with three others got © pass, in what appears to be an ordinary form, from the Officer Commanding Camel Corps at hatt to proceed to the Hej&amp;z. ccording to .R. • F. Intelligence seven chiefs of the Tuqeycja and Billi reached Alcaba on May 1 7th. They were followed onon M©y 20th hy four others of whom Ibn HI fa da was one. They were entertained at k&amp;b© by the Mayor Humeid or .Hamid al Kabriti. The rebels who crossed the frontier to Sharia on the night May 20-21 numbered about two hundred and fifty# By the end of May the numbers had grown to some five hundred; by the middle of June to some one thousand, of whom over two-thirds were said to have come from over the border; by the end of June to anything from one thousand to one thousand five hundred. There would appear to have been laxity on the frontier until well on in June, in s^i.te of the Amir Abdullah’s orders of May 27th or 28th, oerhars because the Mayor of Akaba was chiefly involved in the move ment and the Mudir, as will Presently be seen, was also in the game* The laxity was such that, according to r. . F* Intelligence, a last party about one hundred and fifty strong crossed on the night of June 9th-10th. It is nrobahle that after the first start parties still dribbled through from -inai but the bulk of the new recruits from over the border seem to have come from southern alestine. There is no evidence that any considerable number made their first start from Trans jordan itself. 8. l-on&amp;n ror_...rc: .smi ting a nd tehPifQSi* 1 t,he outset Ibn fifada was anoarently in a position to oay his recruits from £2 to £3 in iygotian notes and to provide motor transport to some extent* ccording to the Governor of la an, as reported by Colonel Cox on June 4th, he brought some £1,500 from Hues. There is ho evidence ao to how he came by this money. It is a fair assumption that it c&amp;me either from mman or from the HejaziH85S!S5RKj&gt; 71 ~ -A- Hejszi grout) in The Hejazl Government had information early In *Tune that feahmoutl '-'bu Tu^eyc©, the one who ratted after visiting, it is said, Amman, had had £20 from a Transjordan agent in :gy-&lt;t and that the mir Abdullah had sent £1,000 to Ibn Rifada but there is no nrecise indication of the origin of this informa tion. It was said about the same time that the Hejazls in lygot had £2,000 and a promise of Purees 35,000 from India. Anyhow, there was no lac* of money at the out set. It was only when the rebels were well Into the Hejaz that shortage of fund© became a difficulty. It is clear th&amp;t the rebels then looked to Transjordan to surmly the deficiency. There is evidence that It either could not be supplied or was being withheld as a means of pressure on the rebels to advance on Dh&amp;be, where oayment was promised. Bilal sneaks of a quarrel between the leaders over the division of £100 sent from ‘mman by the Amir b&amp;ullah for trie purchase of riding camels, but does not make it clear how or when this money came to hand. f 9 - the rebels. This is shrouded in mystery. The .ygptian authorities are positive, = nd they are supported by the British authorities in ygpt, that it could not have taken place in Bgyot. According to Bilal, the recruits there were led to expect arms at k&amp;ba. ccor&amp;ing to the ,oy tory the Amir bdullah had taken steps many months before to collect arms t that Place. This evidence is not strong in itself but it is inconceivable that Ibn Rifads should have taken his first body of two hundred and fifty men over the frontierfrontier without substantial armament and according £0 It# # i** tateiiigsncs $ it would anosar that^ thoijgh rifles were in short supply throughout, some 60 per cent of the estimated total of 1,000 rebels were armed in the middle of * r une, while at the end of June it was believed that there were not more than, which presumably means something in the neighbourhood of, 600 rifles. ';ven allowing; for a certain number pro vided by recruits who .joined up in the Hejszi, it !s clear that some hundreds of rifles must have come from across the frontier. There is, however, no mention anywhere in the evidence of any large specific numbers. The highest single figure named even by the Hejazis is, I think, the oerce.,, of one hundred mentioned in heykh Yussuf Yasin’s letter to me of June 11th as having been bought by X&amp;britl and given by him to Ibn Rifada. General auchope mentioned on June 7th a report that twenty-five rifles had been bought at kaba. These may be the same as the twenty-five German rifles which, according to . .F. Intelligence, were Included in the aunollee sent from Maan to A kaba in the last week in May and which according to a later renort were believed to have been bought to Amman, ny other specific lots of rifles mentioned In the evidence are quite insignificant. 11 this lends gome support to the otherwise feeble evidence of the oy Jtory that a dump of arm© was prepared at or close to ‘kaba before the rebels started. 10. : u r ;illea generally ^ laM - The business of supplying the rebels was in the hands of the K&amp;briti brothers, Hamid, the Mayor of kaba, Obeid, a merchant of Maan and l&amp;wi, a merchant of *&lt;uez. The two first seemseem to have 'been most immediately concerned at first when it was still noselble to send supplies by land, but even then law! would sopear to have been behind their!. It was he, according to the Governor of M&amp;an, ae reported by Colonel Cox on June 4th, who told Obeid to carry on, as funds should be available. Obeid was also In touch with Amman. Colonel Cox reported on June 2nd, quoting *• • ♦ a. information, that he had returned from Amman, presumably to Mean, with £P.200. It Is not relevant to the present purpose to deal with the actual despatches of supplies, except to say that the ilejazi allegations regarding the Kabritie are borne out generally, if not in detail, by information from Trans*- Jordan e. g. the . . F. report that five lorry loads of supplies were gent from Maan to kaba in the last week of May, mainly foodstuffs and clothing. I find no record of what became of these suoolies* It Is not clear how much stuff got across into the rfej&amp;z. Bilal speaks of flour, rice and a few rifles reaching the rebels at Sharia but says that, so far as he knew, only four camel loads were received while they were at Maql. 11* ounolies by Then the Brdtish measures to control the frontier were complete i.e. about mid- June, there could no longer be any hone of sending any substantial quantities of supplies across the frontier. Alawl el Kabriti now comes Into greeter prominence. ccording to « • F. reports he visited k&amp;ba on June 17th, was in Amman on Jdne 19th and left mman for '&gt;nez on June 23rd. In Colonel Cox t political report for June he is mentioned as the main intermediary for forwarding money and supplies to the rebels, colonel Cox relates how it was discovered on June 82nd that the Mu dirMudir of A^aba had been tbsent from hie nost without leave and had accompanied Alawl from Amman to Akaba and back on ^une 16th, 17th and 18th, a fact which led to the dismissal of the Mudir with the consent of the Amir. The dates do not quite square but it is clear that the Mudir of Akaba was in the game and that he and Alawi visited Amman about that time. In due course Alawi attempted to organize supplies from ouez by sea. The Intelligence considered it almost certain that the dhow Taif, which was intercepted off Tor by H.M. J. 'Penzance'’ on July 7th, was the first of hie suonly vessels. The consignor of the cargo was a very minor Sherif, Muhammad All A1 Bedawl. Hie relation ship to the Amir bdullah is distant but It is note worthy that he arrived in mman on July lat and visited the Amir there. He went on to Maan on July 13th and was either arrested or placed under observation. The consignee of the cargo of the Taif or part of it was another 1 Bedawi, named viuhammud Mahmoud, of Dhaba. This man joined the rebels at Haraiba (according to Bilal, who thought he was a spy) and may have been the dherif said to have been slain at Jebel -har. The fitting out of the Taif seems to have been law! 1 Kabriti’s one success at &gt;uez. There is a Hejazi allega tion, unsupported but plausible, that he also tried without success to arrange for the loading of another dhow, unnamed, which nevertheless?, proceeded to the coast of the Northern Hejaz whence it would appear to have come in the first instance. This was captured by the Government armed barge after the battle of Jebel har. It is stated in this connexion that lalri, while at uez, was receiving letters in the writing’ of the Amir bdullah butbut not signed; urging him to hurry uo the suoolies. H. . F. Intelligence mentions another attempt hy Alawi to get the caotain of a amell steamer, which left uez on ‘ T uly 11th for Icaba with petrol for the Trans jordan Frontier Force, to embark thirty- five tons of suonlies for tbn Flfada at Haraiba. 12. There is evidence of communication by land between Transjordan and the rebels after the frontier control had been made generally effective. The moat concrete are as followsj- (a) On June 20th Hamid 1 K&amp;britl wrote to Muhammad bu Tuceyca to convey a message said to have been brought by a certain Person from r *the Amir” ('? Abdullah or possible Ahakir) about 21 camels which the addressee had recently Purchased# receipt show ing the orice was asked for In order that the money should be remitted. The writer* authorized the pur chase of any other available camels or rifles, which would be paid for similarly on the forwarding of a receipt. He announced the despatch of various odd ments, including four rifles and a camel. Five or six more camels with rifles and supplies were promised for a later d&amp;te. Hamid was very insistent on receipts. (b) On June 22nd the same Hamid wrote to the same Abu Tuqeyca to say that 'the Government * had been making a fuss and complaining that the rebels were staying at Haql like visitors. He urged ©n advance on Hareiba and promised that when the rebels proceeded supplies and arms would reach them by sea. (c) On the same day the same Hamid el Kabriti wrote to Ibn Hifade announcing the despatch of three camels, four Turkish rifles, etc. and urging the importanceimportance of the advance on Haralba. He said that nothing more could be sent unless there was a forward move. The saiae promise was given that, if it took: place, supplies would be sent by sea. (&amp;) is perhrpa the most Important indication under this head of direct instigation from Amman at this period. There was a man there named asud ad Dabbagh, a relative of the more important Ad Dabbagh to be mentioned later* He had held a small post at Atooa in King Hussein’s time. He is describee as a man of low character. He had at one time been given a poet in Transjordan at the request of Hamid Tosha al fndi but had latterly Kept a small shop ot Amman. Colonel Cox was informed on July 26th that this man had gone to Maan about twenty-five days earlier with £300, presumably supplied by Abdur-Sauf Sabban and had got through to Ibn Rifa&amp;a. According to R.A.F. Intelli gence, he was in Amman about June 28th and visited the Amir; arrived at Maan on June 29th; went thence to the ftejaz with some ammunition, two camels and money; fed with the Imran on July 5th; bought two camels from them; remained with the rebels but had only £25 on arrival; and promised pay after the capture of Dhaba* This story corresponds generally as regards the material tacts with iiejazi information about the man and with the narrative of Bilal. f asud was among the slain at Jebel Char. Ac cording to the report of the captain of the Hejazi armed barge, the dhow captured after the battle had on ooard a trunk of his containing a cypher, a list ox soldi ex a, etc. (e) Tribesmen seem to have been used as messengers across the frontier. One of these was the son oi our old friend Auda al Atna. According to a Hejazi allegation com munications became regular only alter the ar&lt; iva. ad11 '* | &lt; | '| v /4 f ad Pa'btagh, mem'bers of the Imran tribe being used to take messages to Maan for communications to the Amir Shakir. (2) The Beni Atiya raid and connected matters. 13. The bulk of the Beni Atiya passed into Transjordan early in 1938, in circumstances to which it is unnecessary to revert except to say that they had been at loggerheads with the Hejaasi Government, who were consequently indignant at their admission into Transjordan and that special precautions were taken in Transjordan to prevent them from getting into mischief by keeping them away from the frontier and supervising them. One of the first steps taken on receipt of the news of Ibn Bifada’s expedition was to adopt what were thought to be effec tive measures to prevent the Beni Atiya from joining the movement and to obtain guarantees from other tribal chiefs in Southern Transjordan. All seemed safe until it was suddenly reported that a party of seventy Beni Atiya, under iuhammed Ibn Farhan, a notable leader, had crossed the frontier east of udawwara on the night of June 26th in spite of the opposition of a small police patrol. ( 14. Captain Glubb ie the chief authority on the origin of this raid. He states that certain ol the Beni Atiya were auaiaoned to Amman in Kay and promised, it seems, to help if called upon l.e. to help in action against Ibn baud. On June 9th, six Sheyiche, three at least of whom were Beni Atiya, visited A.:Jnan. They returned to Kerak on June 14th rind -hree of them began to collect forces, giving it out that the Govern ment had sanctioned an invasion of HeJaz-’ T e3d. They nad money and gave from P.50 to £!• each to men joining up. One chief, who kept out of it, telephoned from a place calledcalled Qarar to the Commandant at Kerak that some of the tribe had gone raiding. A party did in tact set oat on Jane 19th. The following day Captain Glubb, who had oeen detached for duty at Akaba on June 12th, heard the news and hurried to Kerak, arriving on June &amp;2nd. He found all the Be duin at Kerak in a ferment of saddling and riding and full of the belief that he himself had given permission for raiding against Ibn Sand. Energetic measures were taken to dispel the general belief that not only the Transjordan Government but the British authori ties would approve action against Ibn Saud but it was too late to catch up the first party of Beni Atiya, with whom were some ten other tribesmen, before they crossed the frontier as stated above. Their subsequent adventures are not material to the present purpose. 15. Although the Beni Atiya were principally con cerned in this movement, the belief on which they acted seems to have been shared by other tribes. The Hejazi Govern ment produced on June 30th a story, for which there is no evidence but which may have had some sort of foundation in fact, or at any rate in tribal rumours on the frontier, that Ibn Jazi of the Howeytat had sent a messenger to Ibn Hlfada asking him to wait so that he might join him. 16. There would appear to have been a small nuxacer of Beni Atiya among Ibn Hifada’s rebels. A report from Ibn Baud’s Akhw&amp;n commander after the battle of Jebel Shar mentioned the escape of twenty of them. .heir piesence with the rebels is confirmed by the narrative of Bilal, who says that Salim Ibn Gbeiu, with twelve Beni iitiya xiorn Keraic, joined Ibn Rifada about four days after the rebels enteredenters $ Harai ba l«e« y it may 1&gt;6 assouaecl t in the i'irst days of Jaly $ as the R.A#F• fix the occupation of Haraiha to the date of July 1st. 17. In his general report for June, Captain Gluhb, commenting on the movement among the Beni Attys suggests that the Ibn Bifada affair was the work of a political society in the Uejaz and persons in Kirypt probably af filiated to it, with perhaps some Sherifian participation, not necessarily altogether welcome to the society; but that the Beni Atiya business was the sole work of the Amir at Amman, whether acting at the suggestion of the society or not. His special knowledge of the Beduin tribes on the frontier and his contact with the Beni Atiya at :lerak on find after June 22nd give value to the second part of his appreciation. I attach less importance to the first part for reasons to be given in paragraphs 40 ff. below. 3. The Ad BaDbagh Plot to crea te trouble In South Hastern Arabia. 18. Hussein Ad Pabbagh, the most active of the large number of persons concerned in this affair, is an old enemy of Xhn Saud. He belongs to a Hejazi family said to he of Moorish origin. He went to India in the latter part of 1987 with a member of the Shaibl family. that time he and his companion represented a body ’■cnown as i-he Anjuaani-Hizb A1 Ahrar at Mecca. Their orject was to carry on propaganda against Tbn Saud enu to enlist a p Hussein attracted the attention of the Government of India, who decided to expel him and would have done sj, ha not al ready left for HoK.Ua. He was warned there by the Aden authorities at the instance of the Government of India.India. April X7t,h.g 1 : 28 § His l&gt;ia^@s - ty , s Ag©nt» and. Consul at Jedda informed the Hejazi Government, under instructions, of the action taken in India hut he re ported in June that he himself attached little impor tance to the Andaman’s activities. 19, One of the Indians approached hy Hussein Ad Pahbagh was Shauqat Ali. It appears from a letter which he wrote to this personage in January 1928 that the He^azi liberals (Ahrar) were not at that time pro- Hashimite, for one of the articles in an enclosed National Pact read as follows:- 'To revoke the monarch ical powers of any individual and to form a republican Government, duly assisted, which may suit the public'. 20. The word An jam an means Council and it may be supposed that the body in Mecca was the directing com mittee or a branch of what appears in the recent corres pondence as the Hizb A1 Ahrar A1 Hijazi. The point is ofimportance in any attempt to elucidate the ramifica tions of the Hizb. However unimportant the Anjuman as such may have been in the Hejaz, Hussein A&amp; Dabhagh and his associates were active. Another letter to. Shauqat All written hy one Omar A1 Qasiri on October 29th, 1928 and bearing an Aden postmark, claimed the recent trouble between the Beni Malik and Ibn Saud as an achievement of the p-rty and le ierred to the creation of an information bureau and a newspaper at Cairo. This newspaper was A1 Omaa, which had apparently existed before, as the ^mir Abdullah e henchman Abdur Eauf Sabban is said to have eoited a paper of that name in 1925. 21. Hussein Ad Dahbagh is said to have visited Transjordan late in 1929 but Aden gives this as unconfirmedunconfirmed report. Recent events show that whatever hie political sentiments may have been in 1929, he has since come into close touch with people working in the Hashimite cause* 22. The foregoing paragraphs give the general setting of Hussein Ad Babbagh. His recent activities and those of his numerous associates have formed the subject of four special intelligence reports from Aden. They disclose the existence of a far-reaching political conspiracy with attaches in Aden, Lahej, the Hadhramaut, probably the Yemen, Asir, Karaaran, probably Kecca, Maesawa, R-gypt 9 Palestine and Transjordan and possibly Baghdad. The object of the plot was to promote a rising in Asia in conjunction with membirs of the Idrisi family and other elements hostile to Ibn Baud and with the aid of dhows bought at Mas saws to be used for transport. The conspirators in the South Test of Arabia included Tahir Ad Babbagh, a near relative of Hussein, who ar rived in Aden from Singapore in June, Aqil Abbas or Abbas Aoil Bardaghash, who had done the pilgrimage with two others of the group this year and Sherif Khalid, one of the ^ bdul Mutallib branch of the Sherifian family, who had been living with an elderly uncle at dahej: Tabriz 'fcould appear to have been the headquarters of a so-called Yemen branch of the Hizbal Ahrar Al ilijazi. 25. It is unnecessary for the present purpose to give further particulars of the Ad Babl agh plot as a whole. i/hat is important is to trace its connexions o* possible connexions with Transjordan and with the Egyptian section of the Hizb. Broadly speaking it may be said that the inquiries in Aden fully bear out the allegations&lt;59 n allegations of the Hejazi Govermaent as stated to me orally on July 21st and in a letter of July 22nd by Sheyfch Yussuf Vasin, who some weeks earlier had made representations to me regarding propaganda carried on by Hussein Ad abb&amp;gh from Aden and who now gave details of a conspiracy to organize subversive action. The main evidence bearing on the subject of this paper is as follows 24. Contacts at Moslem Congress in Jerusalem in December 1951. Hussein Ad Dabbagh, then school-mastering at Lahej, is said to have gone with another school-master to the Moslem Congress and to have got into touch there with Abdul-Hamid Al- hatib and other pro-Hashimites. This is aaid to have led to the formation of a Hejaz De fence Committee (Jamiat Ad Difa Lil Hijaz) with Abdul- Malik Al Xhatib as treasurer. There is no explanation of the necessity for such a body in addition to the Blzb Al Ahrar Al Hijazi, in which the persons named were already concerned. Hussein is said to have visited Amman, Baghdad and Kgypt before retur ing to Aden and, less plausibly, to have been visited by Abdur—Rauf Dabban at Aden to get a report for the Amir Abdullah. 25. Tahir Ad-Pabbagh’ s letter to the Amir Shakir. This i@ the most important piece of evidence produced by the Hejasi Government. It was written on or about February 20th, 1952 from Lahej on behalf of the 'representative coamittee in the Yemen' of the Hirt. It croee-refers to corresponaence with the Secretary of the li^h in kmsi&amp;Ti, It describes arrangements to work ap tribes in Aslr. writer complains that the first payment, which it nun been agreed should be remitted by telegram, has not been received and says that he has telegraphed to Hamid Pasha at LausanneLausanne and to *Your secretary*. He begs that Hamid Pasha and the secretary should be exhorted to zeal and resoluteness. He as^cs that the last letter from hahej should be acted on carefully. The movement in the north, he says, should ib How immediately on that in the south* He asks the Amir Shakir to arrange accordingly and asks that when it (i.e. the movement in the north, starts, the Committee should telegraph ‘’Buy*’ over the signature M 3aid*. He refers to a plan to invite the Sherif come to Aden for an important national conference and in such terms as to ensure his coming without delay. Further particulars of this plan are given. The writer enjoins secrecy etc. and in a postscript draws special attention to a letter already written to the Committee. It is pretty clear fx v om the general run of the letter that the Committee and the Secretary referred to were people in Amman, not in Egypt, and that Tahir was writing to Amman, as to headquarters. It is not quite certain who the Sherif .^hakl-r-iB but General Wauchope suggested on August 18th that he was probably Sherif N &amp;h^a^Abn Rajlh, a cousin of Shakir, who worked for the Hashimites during the war rather than either of two other bearers of the name in Mecca. He is stated to have spent two months in Amman a year ago but to have since resided in Baghdad. 26. Finance. Sheykh Yussuf Yasin stated on July Hst 1922 that Hussein Ad DaVbagh had received £2,000 through Ahdur-Rauf As Sahban In the fora of a draft by the Banque idler on a bank at Aden. The Aden reports mention a suspicion that Hussein was receiving money from As Sabban and a reported statement of his to Selim * 1 -‘ &gt;lf ’ f-* an s O.C. at Hodeldeh, whom he was trying to seduce, that he . t r'Vvr&gt;is much more cetegoi ic&amp;i aha £10,000 at his disposal* idere is evidenceevidence, however, in the fact that Hussein did receive telegraphic transfers from Jerusalem through the National Bank of India, ae follows: • arch 10, £493; March 29, £987; April 5, £500; June 10, £1,000; and that on June 7 he cashed a draft of the National Bank &lt; -gypt for £400 • It was ascertained in Jerusalem that the sender of the telegraphic remittances was one Osman Arab who gave his address as C/o Ahmed Malhas, a well-known merchant at Amman. Osman Arab proved to be a well-to-do de^azi * ^no normally re sides in T 'gypt, but who had paid frequent visits to Jerusalem during th? 18 months ending last July. His visits during which he normally stayed at the Palestine Hotel were very short. He used to have telephone conversations with the Amir Abdullah, or, in the Amir's absence, with Abdur-R^uf Sabban. It will be noted that the first of the telegraphic r emittances was sent just about the time that the pressing appeals from Lahe^ might have been expected to r ach Amman. Aden mentions also reports that at the end of April ore Ahmed Abdullah Aishan came from Transjordan to Aden and handed £4,000 to Hussein Ad Babbagh and that the latter received at Massawa £1,800 through an Italian Bank in May when he was arranging to buy dhows* Col.Cox heard from a Palace source in Amman in -august tnat &amp;o*ae of the money sent by bdur Rauf As Srbban to Hu sein was for the purchase of *? dhows to transport members of the -ya tribe from the Hadhra/aaut to Asir. The name of the tribe as received in Jedda is corrupt but I surmise an identification with the Hu f a tribe in the adi Al Ha jar close to Bir Ali, the rulerIt mler of which place was in the plot. The Ku’a are, or were, a powerful and well-armed tribe, in whose district the Aahraf were strong. it was said in August that the people at Aden had incurred the displeasure of the central organisation and that funds were stopped, it heing given as e reason that one of the local conspirators, an Al hat id, had Misused, a portion oi theia* This accusa tion was true hut the stoppage may also he connected with the collapse of Ihn Bifada# 27 • ^ravels of_,Iamld ^asha Al ^adi . This gentleman has already been mentioned* He is the chief of the Amir Abdullah’s Divan or Secretariat. In his letter of February 20 Tahir Ad Dabbagh speaks of having telegraphed to Hamid Pasha at Lausanne. Gneral Wauchope reported on August 18 f that Hamid Pasha had returned from rt hie last vislt ,, to Abbas Hllmi at Lausanne on July 12 end does not mention any later movement. The Aden reports state, however, that a person, whom, after previous confusion of names, they identify as Hamid Pasha al 'Wadi, again left Egypt for Marseilles on July 20. He was believed to have paid £1,000 on account to an armament firm in France, probably 8t. Ftienne, in respect of an order for goods to be sent to a destination to be fixed later; to have gone on to Paris; and to hove intended to leave *-aris on July 28 returning to Alexandria on August 8. The Aden reports suggest that Hamid Pasha got his money irom Abdul Malik Al Khatib, who is said to have been authorised to finance him up to £ 100 , 000 . I do not know where Aden got its information regarding his movements. In view of his contacts with the ex-Khedive and his alleged dealingde© 1 ai'iBBf it would b© useful to iisve a prec 1 re- account of his movements during the last twelve months. ^ { *^ti a 1 corm 0 xl q ns not already mentioned # (i) One of the conspirators in Asir was Muhammad Amin Ash-Shanqitl f described as a member of the Asir Council, a former member presumably. A man of the same unusual name, probably the same, is mentioned in a despatch from Col. Cox dated July 27 as being in Transjordan. He had recently returned to Amman X'rom Damascus, whither he was supposed to have gone on the Amir’ s political business. The Amir received him as a guest at the same time as hie new Prime Minister. He was one of those wtio used to write 1 gainst Ibn Gaud and in favour of Ibn Hi fad a and was the remited author of telegrams to General Wauchope and Col. Cox protesting against British interference in the Moslem affair between Ibn Rlfada and Ibn Baud. He had become one of the subjects of quarrel between the Amir and his Government. (ii) Two Ad-Dabbaghs figure in the picture in the North. An account has already been given of one of them, iaesud. Another, Abdul-Cassim was on July 10 given a visa lor Amman at Baghdad at the request of the Palace. He had not reached Amman by July 27 and may be of no importance. (iii) on August 4 and 9 Tahir Ad Dabagh, then still at Aden, was discovered to be in telegraphic communication with an unknown conspirator at the Hotel Palestine, Jerusalem, the hotel patronized by Osman Arab. (iv) On August 15, Selim Bey, the Iman , s O.C. at Hodeideh, whose ueip Hussein Ad Dabbagh hud sought to enlist at an earlier date, arrived at Kamaran on his way to Palestine. In view of the lateness of the date, tnis Journey is prohahly without eigniiicance in tne present connexion. ( 4 ) TK1MA.'(c).... (4) TFIMA. 29. The osBis or Teima has long had a special character owing to its geographical position and apparent jealousy of outside interference. The Governor, Abdul Kerim Ibn Rumman is said never to have made complete sub mission to Ibn Saud or to have admitted his troops, el though he was reported some time ago to be polite end politic. The Governor of Maan told Colonel Cox early in June that Ibn Rumman was hostile to Ibn Saud and was in agreement with heykh Sultan al Paqir of the Aneyisa. Reports were current later that he feared attack by the Akhwan. The position is described as follows in a R.A.F. Intelligence report of July 18:- 11 (a) Since the fall of the Hashimite regime, Ibn Rumman, Teima* s Governor, has remained independent and has, on some occasions, openly defied Ibn Baud. He has kept up a regular correspondence with His Highness the Amir Abdullah and there is reason to believe that the latter has offered to support him in the event of Ibn Seud trying to subjugate him by force of arms. 'He is convinced that his town is now in danger of attack by Government forces and he has sent letters and messages to Amman requesting immediate re ini orcements in men and material. He has mobilised his own resources and is prepared to withstand a siege. «(b) It was the recent call to arms of the Akhwan in the Hail district that engendered these fears. He anticipates that their objective is Teima and the direction of the first stages of their advance confirmed his belief...(!?3&gt; 25' '(c) The newe of Talma's warlike preparations has spread over northern Hejaz and Transjordan, where it is supposed that Ifcn Ixuaman is an ally of Ibn Rilada and is co-operating with him' 1 .... ♦,. SO. The Hejazi version as given to me by Fuad Bey Hamza in August is that the Amir Abdullah has made definite efforts to seduce the Government of Teima, using more particularly one Sleim, who went to Amman in the first instance as a Hejazi witness in the MacDonnell investigation, was got at there and has since been used as an intermediary for the Amir* s purposes. (5) Activities in Beiaz Ne.ld . 31. Ibn Baud accuses the Amir Abdullah of widespread propaganda in his dominions. The accusations are in their nature insusceptible of investigation, without encouraging the Hejazis themselves to produce proofs, which it has been undesirable to do. The indications are, however, worth nothing, as follows. (a) Aecca and Jedda. Many of the townspeople are in their hearts hostile to Ibn Baud’s regime. These towns, however, are no homes for heroes. The malcontents are too gutless to organize revolt but many would welcome a change. I doubt whether there is now any organized branch of the Hi zb al Ahrar, although the anjuman-i-HUb A1 Ahrar, already mentioned, existed in 1927 ana seems to have been then regarded by Hussein ad Pabbagh etc. as the centre. A good many arrests were made in «&gt;euua and Mecca last June and several people were deported to viadh. One of the first was the yrian Paudhi al Kawo&amp;ji, who had been dismissed last year from the post of Director GeneralGeneral of Military Organization and was thought by sGiae to be working in the Hashimite interest. The other persons arrested were a very aotley crew. Sheykh Yussuf Yasin told me that the main body of arrests had to db with the Ad Dabbagh plot. It appears that some of those acre s ted were relatives of persons known to be engaged in it e.g. Amin Ibn Aqil, who is probably related to Abbas Acil, one of the more active of Husein Ad Dabbagh 1 e associates. It will he remembered that Abbas Aqil came on pilgrimage this year with two other members of the group. At nd before the time of the events the Govern ment were suspicious of possible disaffection among the younger townsmen. Football was discountenanced lest the clubs should be theatres of political activity. In spite of all this, I do not think that the Government can have discovered much of real importance. After Ibn Bifada f a defeat it was decided to let the political deportees return and the ban on football was removed. This mildness Is quite unlike Ibn Baud in his recent phase, if he had had any reason to suspect serious subversive activity on the part of pro-Hashimites or other opponents of hi© re rime. (b) The adi Girhan. On July 6, the Hejazi Govern ment officially complained that, according to their information, the Amir Abdullah was now trying to stir up trouble in the f adi ' irhan. Ho proof was adduced and there were in fact no signs of trouble in that area. There may, however, have been an itch in Amman to do something. Colonel Cox mentions in his report for May that, 'two of the sycophants whoa the Amir keeps attached to21 34. to him put up a scheme tot his approval that they should hire 100 cars and after filling them with armed men should attack Jauf (c) Propaganda...in the interior^ When the Sheykh of Kuwait visited Ibn Gaud in March, the King bitterly accused the Amir Abdullah of intriguing againet him in every direction, inter alia in his eastern dominions. In August Fuad Bey Hamsa, when exchanging views with me privately laid particular stress on propaganda in pejd, alleging tnat the Aiair was at pains to indoctrinate with his ideas merchants etc* passing through Amman. There is no formal evidence in support of these allegations, but the idea that the Amir Abdallah was the real enemy seems to have permeated large bodies of Nejdi opinion, to judge by the .ocuments published in the Umm al dura of August 5. (6) Possible participat i on in recent events of various royal personages 0ovemmen d their rep..^er, sentatives* 52. I will sum up the meagre material available in Jedda regarding persons who have or sight have incurred suspicion of coaplicity in action directed against Itm Baud. I exclude the Iiaam Yahya, as toeing remote tram the Amir Abdullah and his entourage. 55. TA&gt;isal and the^Ira q GovemmenjU ^ere is no reason to suspect the King of Ira£ or his Government. The Hejaai Government were at the outset very careful to disclaim any desire to implicate them and have latterly gone out of their way to commend the correctness honesty of purpose of King x elsal.36 .. &lt;34. S.y&gt;:..:.;.lnR. All and his entourage. Karly in June, Shey^ch YuBSuf Yasin definitely accused King Ali and hi© entourage of complicity, when discussing the lion Rifada affair with me. He was violently peiturbed when I told him of King All’s journey from Baghdad to Amman on June A3. Ilm Baud himself seems to hive taken this more calmly and since that time there have been no specific Hejazi allegations against the ex-King. All’s visit to Amman was regarded by the High Com missioners at Baghdad and Jerusalem as a harmless summer move for reasons of health, he himself was prodigal of assurances to Colonel Cos on July 7. He said inter alia that he had told Sir P. Humphry a that he would be prepared to postpone his visit to Amman, if the Ibn Rifada affair made this desirable, but had been told that there was no need to do so. There is in fact no evidence of any complicity on King All’s part in the Ibn Kifada affair and it may be noted that he was reported soxae tia. ago to have Bdvieed the Amir Abdullah to rtco.'mise Ibn Baud. On the other hand there are two thing, against him viz (i) the very singular approach, which, according to the Egyptian Consul at Bagdad, he attempted to niafce to ing Fuad in '%*% ’&gt; and (iii Hu6sein Ad Dobbagh's statement to the Italian Consul at „uen that he and his associates had exchanged coirespondenc. with the ex-King, who had given them to understand that he favoured their plans. It seems probable that there may be persons in 'ling All’s entourage more active than he himself in plotting but ihere is no spec^nc eviue under this head either.-35. PJOtfUggaii MAJ Jait • ■ ^ystian Ciovemme^t. In thi s case the suspicions expressed hy the Hejazi Government, or rather hy ;hey)di Yuesuf Yasln, seem to be wholly unfounded* He it her King •-‘uad nor his Government have much use for Xbn aaud* Their legal objections to prolonging the detention of the dhow 'Taif 1 * seem to have been reinforced by political unwillingness to present the appearance of recognizing Xbn ;iaud but their attitude throughout recent events has been eminently correct and there is nothing whatsoever to connect any responsible person In ygpt with the Hi zb al hrar al Hijazi or with Xbn 1 ifads. 36. ’11ml.-....a&amp;iMi » The ex-Hhedive has been very active during the last 10 or 12 months and seems to be Playing or more than Playing with aspirations to the throne of pyria or to the Galinhate in some sh&amp;ne or form or oosalbly both. His visit to ? mman last ecember suggested the possibility of a deal between him and the Amir Abdullah to support each other’s ambitions in yris and the Hejaz respectively. Mention has already been made of his apparent subsequent intercourse with Hamid ■asha 1 Wadi* I quote the following passage from a report by Colonel Cox dated July 27 in connexion with the Ad-Dabbagh ol t2- **1 have hitherto maintained that Abbas Hllmi has not supplied any money to the Hi zb al Hljaasi; but, though I have no proof, there are a number of pointers which lead me to believe that X was wrong and that Abbas Hi 1ml is the main source of supply*’. It is worth noting that the ex-Khedive had an agent, Abdul-Hemid Ash- ihadld, in the Hejaz during* part of May-dune. Thesame or another oerson of the same surname was in Trans jordan in May* In both cases the avowed object was to make economic and financial Proposals to the respective Governments. In the c^se of Hejaz-’Jejcl I considered it improbable at the time that Abbas Kilmi seriously contemplated financing Ibn ,-aud, even in return for con cessions or even with otherpeople’s money. 37. ■■^CLV.ernment from the Amir. I find no evidence to implicate the Transjordan Government as such. Colonel Cox reported on July 27 that the Govern ment had tried to restrain the Amir from instigating pro tests against the arrest of Muhammad Alt Al-Bedawi, the prohibition of the export of foodstuffs and the creation of a prohibited zone along the frontier. There was also a difference over his Patronage of Ash-uharqiti, who had previously been bound over to keen the peace, with the Amir’s concurrence; and something which I do not follow about the tearing down of General Wauchope’s proclamation. The Amir wanted Colonel Cox to allow him to change his Gov- ( ernment which Colonel Cox thought would be a serious mistake. 38. in iheykh Yusuf Yasin accused r. Waji-al-Aeil early in June of complicity unfortunate choice for Jedda owing to his earlier associa tions and the same was true of his secretary and clerk, the latter of whom had served King Ali, but I find no evidence to connect any of them with the ol'&gt;t. S9 * Ytie. ..ygntlttn C onsul in .redda., -haykh Yusuf Yosin ■brought a si liar accusation against Hafiz Amer. This in the conspiracy to overthrow Ibn S^ud* ' ‘ v 1 was an unattractive gentleman is violently antagonistic to Ibn baud, I&gt;ut there is no evidence of his having' conspired against him. (7) Cpn &amp;l&amp;kl&amp;acUEHH (7) Gone Xu si on 8. 40. I bn P. if a da and the Beni Atiya were, and the tribes in sif were to have been, the instruments of politicians. These fell into two main groups, not entirely separate but distinguishable, viz# the Hiso—Al Ahrar Al Hijasl and the entourage of the mlr Abdullah. hen we were concerned only with the I bn Bifada affair it was thought both in Jerusalem and Cairo that the moving force was the Hizo, which was supposed to have its being principally in Egypt, though General Wauchope believed the Amir to be aware of what was toward^ and Sir P. Loraine said that the president Abdul Hamid Al Khatio was reported to be in contact with the Amir. The Hizo was regarded in Cairo as being a body of no serious consequences. 41. It is notlf' nece^, ary to revise these opinions. The Hizo prove a to have had at least three branches, viz. at Cairo, at mm an nd at Lahe;}. There msy possibly be a branch at Mecca corresponding to the Anjuman-X-Hissb Al Ahrar known to h ve existed in 1927-28, but I doubt whether the Hizb has recently had any effective or organized existence in the Hejaz* 42. I have no doubt that the Hizo in &lt;gypt played its part in the events under consideration. It m y have had funds of its own and used them in the common cause. I can only conclude from the evidence, however, that its r5le wa l subordinate to that of people in Arom-&gt; n, where the Hizb overlaps, merges in or includes the mlr* s entourage# It is possible that the Hizo as such stands fundamentally for ideas different from those of the Amir and his intimates ideas more democratic and less dynastic# It is clear, however,however, tliat ii tills was tiic cas© f tfiey liad come Into close allifince against Uiu; comi on enemy. Ion Baud. 43* ft very important step in tne evidence reviewed above leads to or from Amman. Ion Rifada was fresh from tiiere when he star tea his recruiting. The Kaoritie went there at crucial moments. Hamid 1 Kaoriti invoked an alleged message from the Amir when writing to Abu Tuqeyqa on J ne 20th. The beni tiya chiefs came from Amman immediately before telling their people that raiding into Hejas Hej&amp; had Devn sanctioned. It was with Amman that the Ad Dabbagh corresponded, when the time seemed ripe for action and it was to Amman that they looked for the fulfil ment of promises of money. The most definitely tracesule remittance^, tmong the comp; ratively large sums which were available, were sent to Aden by a man in Jerusalem who was in telephonic com* ami cation with Amm n. It was there that Ion Rumman of Teima sought support. 4 . I consider that tile principal working members of the group in Amman were the Amir Shakir, Hamid P&amp;sha Al Wadi and Abdurrauf Sabban. As regards the first two, the Tahir Ad Dabbagh letter of February 20th provides the key to ell the other evidence and, if genuine, suffices of itself to incriminate them. It was suggested by Colonel Cox at the outset, in his despatch to General auchope oi May 27, that they were much too sensible to engage in so harebrained a scheme as that of I bn Rifada. This opinion, very natural at that time would, if advanced now, break down on the fact tnat the I bn Rifada affair was only one move in a much larger sehene, the promoters oi which were convinced that Ion Baud was on the down grade and that the timetime fced come to overthrow him* The third person n?med # Ab&amp;ur Haul' 8 ob&amp;n f cute a comparatively small figure in this memorandum, tout hi© n me recurs in the correspondence* Colonel Cox says in hie despatch of July 27 that he is regarded as the local peym* ster of the Hizu, I incline to the view that his position was more important and that he canalized the flow of money on a larger scale. King Faisal seems to have singled him out as the one man of whom the Amir Abdullah ought to rid himself* 4o. The Amir Abdullah cannot be definitely incrimin ated on any formal evidence known to me* Ho document can be traced to him* Hie position is such that his name, like that of any other ruler or pretender, might easily ue invoked to cover acta unauthorized by him. It la difficult however, to suppose that he was not a party to the whole business. He, much as my one, believed I bn Baud to be on the down grade and might be unseated. If motive counts for anything, he h d the strongest possible motives to make ext attempt the success of which would have avenged ( V__ hie defeat at Turaoa and the destruction of his father 1 s dynasty by I bn Baud, besides providing him with something a good deal better than the position of ruler in leading strings of a mem princip lity cheek oy ^owl with his younger orother*s first Kingdom of Ir-g* Colonel cox, who knows him best, tied reached the conclusion that the Amir '*wse person lly ymd directly responsible for the movement (of the Beni Atiya) ana for the unfortunate dissemination of the belief that the British and Transjordan Governments were in favour of the participation of Transjordan tribesmen in the r&lt; volt w * General /auehope considered this view unproven at47 4 st 'th© time. X find ii ii8.pd net io ticceni it# sncl, sccs^ting It, to generalize it to the extent of 'believing that the j Ami** was an accomplice in all the activities dealt with above. 46. The Amir's attitude is perfectly intelligible. He quite naturally hates Ibn aud end is at no nains to conceal it. His outlook is well defined, with suitable wrapping, in the letter which he wrote to General ^uchooe on July 3nd. It is politically unfortunate that he some times gives less direct expression to his views, a fact which has strengthened the resentment against him in Hejaz Nejd; but we can hardly fail to have some sympathy with his grievance and aspirations, as distinct from hie rather deplorable methods. He is by nature a double dealer, as he has shown for instance in his internal policy. It Is for this reason that I see no incompatibility between the con clusions I have stated ^nd his nubile or semi-public acts. It is only fair to recall them however. He issued orders which involved a disavowal of Ibn Rifada on May 27 or 28, f He assented to a law prohibiting the export of foodstuffs in June. He signed the proclamation of July 2 establishing a prohibited zone on the frontier. He promised General Tauchooe on July ? to make it known to all concerned that he was actively supporting the Resident at Amman and His Majesty's Government in all their measures nd would not contravene the movement. He gave effect to this promise by orders issued to the mb Legion just before July with a view to expressing our desire that no person or party should give assistance to Ibn fifada and those with him and that we are against those who have such an idea./ 47* All these acta were Performed under direct British influence* I do not think that they count for much as against the cloud of other witness against the -mir* The ant^ooecl. 1 b not such as would establish a case in a court of law but it appears to me to establish a strong Pre sumption that he was behind the actual organizers of the riot of which the Ibn ^fifada affair was only one episode.hist Ml JiJl&amp; j2X*i.Q^l22cji,, ■^P:!irgeK used the memo in.

Fhe Umm-al-i ura reproduces, with various omissions, a confession attributed to him* In this confession the man describes him self Ash-Sherif Muhammad Said, son of Abdullah Said Pasha and grandson of Saad ion Muhammad ion Abdullah, head of a tribe known as 2awi Aodullrh in !

Declarant does not adduce this in order to appear an enemy of king Hussein and a &amp;«n loyal to the present regime, but as an explanation ol fact. He goes on to speak of his hope of pardon andand a promise by the Director of Police that it will oe accorded# i.n thi b hope he ^ivea particulsra of his association in his place oi residence^ with He^a&amp;is like Abdul-Malik 1 Kluitit # Je&amp;il Pasha, .heykh Ae-BaDban, the sons of Sheykh Salih Ad-haobagh, Kuhsin Pasha, Ali Pasha, Muhammad Abdul Asia, Abdul- fahhab ( 4 &amp;ssas and his brother Bakri Zmzz&amp;z and others. One day the Sakri brothers and a Sherif who visited (^Cairo) in 1549—50 (1950—51) caBie and handed him passports in the name of fherif Fahd I bn Mansur A*-Zeidi, grandson of the Amir of Mecca# They stayed with declarant until midnight and talked of the case of his father, the reigns of King Hussein and Ion Baud and th^ harm ana killing done in the He j&amp;z by /Yejai i&gt;, who hold that all save them— selves art infidels* They informed him that they had formed a committee to bring Hcjamia together, to promote the return of Hussein* a relative.» and the expulsion of Ion Laud. They expected every one to do his duty, i.e. to pay a monthly contribution. Declarant consented but exclaimed at the idea of people as few in number hoping to drive Ion Sand out. Did they mean to do it, he asked, by bringing an international case again him or by military force. They said they woula do it oy bringing up a case and by paying money. Declarant thereafter paid 10 Egyptian piastres a month. Declarant ie de^c ibed as having next given particulars aa to the committee end the names of members, which the tlmm-al- ura does not publish. Borne of them ?,.re said to be in Iraq end some others in Hejaz (head Mutawwifs etc. An obscure p ssuge refers to his having met his friends onlyonly three of four tiisee and to one unnamed person whom he saw only once. He asked this person for permission to go to the He^az and to take his wife thither for her eonfineaent in compliance with hie father’s advice that the child should he born in their country of origin. Arrangements were made under which he was to correspond end to receive £68 plus £60 for the monthly correspondence. He drew the £68 in Egypt and £20 by post in the Hejaz. Arriving in Jedda in R&amp;jao he went straight to Mecca accompanied by Sira;} and Said Sarhan. Two days later they rented a house there. In due course he received a letter from one of the members giving him directions and cypher signs on sn enclosed paper, the signs be lieved to he those of King Cheops. Declarant explains the meaning of various dot and dash signs, which from his account of them appear to have constituted not the actual cypher, out pointers to indicate the nature of the 1 nguage to be used, time to be allowed for replies, etc. The letters, he says, are not few in number. ’’They have means oi* correspondence ky ir Mail via India, Singapore and Java. w This sentence tail© off into obscurity and references are made in the ensuing passage to arrangements for appointing one or more persons to kill the tyrant, the mean© of identifying them and the steps to he taken to replace emissaries who have incurred suspicion or have betui arrested. Declarant is described as having gone on to dealdeal with tho correspondence in which he himaeli* was concerned but at this point the aX'^.vura hreak .8 oi*i’ saying, ,} He then explained the cypher in a way which it is useless to publish^, and proceeds to give another statement made Dy the declarant on another occasion in his own handwriting and over his signature* Ae further statement begins as follows:- ’1 Degin by mentioning the matter of Amir Abdullah who sent to the com.! it tee in Egypt on behalf of the party requesting that a person should be sent to the Hejaa to perform a certain mission namely to keep the committee informed of three matters:- first, the situation of the country as far as the present financial worries of the country are concerned; secondly, the impression or the effect future; incidents will have in the country; thirdly, to furnish the committee with all information in detail about the He jaa country* After again speaking of the arrangement for his remuneration &lt;nd describing how he started in Rajab, having taken the required oaths and obtained the visa of the He 3 assi representative in Egypt, declarant continues as follows:- The Amir Abdullah he a sent instructions to his bro tiler J V 1 2 eyd who asked the committee to ©end him arms and asked for a reply* The committee replied that it was posaiol© to do so f.nd arranged for sending them. It was required that the money with which they would purchase the stuff should be sent. The reply to this letter was received sayingsaying that a certain (name omitted) was being sent from Jerusalem to Egypt with the Egyptian notes* tfie committee knowing that they would not o© sent by post or as a draft so that no suspicion should arise and es the matter was being done secretly. The person referred to then arrived and X learnt from the administration of the committee that arrangements h^d been made for arms to be sent out from Ho. 6 lamailia in agreement with the O.C. Coast Guard and through Kantara in agreement with its inspector. The arms were rifles, cartridge- and daggers and did not include swords* guns or shells. These arms were old and were purchased by order of /mi r Abdullah direct* They were sent out through the desert of f inal in such a way that they need not pass by Arish where the Egyptian force is located and they ml&amp;ht get seized. They were despatched by way of Al A bar Al urrah (the bitter wells) so that they should reach Akaoa overland by desert only. hurt I reached the He^i z I went to Mecca as if X were a pilgrim. '* Declarant goes on to explain that he is not really a ®k®rif but pretended to be one in order to facilitate his journeys to the Hejaz and to be able to acquaint himself with the condition and dispositions of the Ashref.

I then learnt of a letter being sent by the committee to say eo and so sent a letter to so and so to say that he is quite prepared to serve hib country and that person delivered the letter to the committee and they informed me of his object. * The Uimn-Al- ura adds that there is other in formation supplied by the man in question but that there is no use in publishing it. The p per hopes that the punishm^nt inflicted on the man in consequence of his crime will be an example to all. Hote on the above;- I had a local report in Jedda in July 14 regarding the arrest of e thief, said to be a grandson of the S her if Muhammad Pasha, and the raiding of his house in Mecca. My informant stated that this Sherif had lived in dgypt and married a certain Christian there ahd that he had arrived in Jedda two or three months /beforebefore. This can only be the author of Uie above confeeBion, who refers to his third letter to the eomi 1 ttet f which wa® intercepted, as having oeen written on or about July 5. The main lines of the story are clear despite obscurities due partly to editing and partly no doubt to defective translation, as I h d no time before leaving Jedda to get Uve translation cheeked. The word which I have given as “committee” was rendered 'asaerbly” by my translator, from whom I gathered, though I was unable to check this, that the origins! was not Hizb but he thought from memory R Dita. The confess ion fits in wita other indications out presents minor points of difficulty, e.g* the man seems to speak of the arrangements to procure arras as h ving been made before he left dgypt In Hajab (about Hovember 11 to December 10, 1JSl) i.e* a lon^ time before I bn Rifada became really active; and he speaks as though tine Amir deiu had acted as an intermediary at that time.

In a leading' article entitled: “A new light on the insurrection in the Hedjaz. Significant Facts and Documents—Will the Egyptian Cabinet Talk at last?” A I-Siyasa says : — ‘‘In another column we have publish ed the details of the recent revolt of Ibn j Itafada os published in Umm el Kura which is edited at Mecca. Ibn Fata da’s revolt has been crushed and the Moslem AVorld now feel reassured. But we still wish to know the source of these in trigues a'Inch are being engineered m the dark to kindle the fire of revolution 5 in the heart of the Arabian Peninsula, this is why ay e follow carefully every- thing that is likely to throw light on the real causes of this revolt. jf should be not iced that V mm el-Kura in which j tire details in question were published is the mouthpiece of the Government old King Ibn Saoud and that therefore these details arc significant especially seeing that they are supported by many official documents^ Ihese new details indicate that Transjordan was the source of feed ing the movement and that the Amir Abdullah was in touch with its organ- rsers. Ample evidence was produced that the Amir of Transjordan had pre viously played a similar role. And if it is borne in mind that Transjordan is, m tact, a British colony, the other facts standing behind the attitude of the Amir Abdullah can easily be understood. I his side of the tragedy does not, how- cAor, interest us as much as do the de tails published in Uvim el Kura about the movements of the organisers of the revolt in Egypt and the assistance and facilities rendered them in Egyptian ter ritory. This question, was Raised once before and we asked the Cabinet to give an explanation. And hoav we are face * t° face with certain details that confirm all that was said in this connection. Ac- f cording to L mm el Kura’s report Ibn Ka- fada. the ringleader of the revolt used to live in Cairo in the Shubra district in 192S i.e. four years ago and was in close touch with Transjordan. The report further states that Ibn Fa i a da left ( airo for Transjordan over one year ago and returned to Egypt with a Transjor dan passport bearing a visa from the Kg.y_pt.ian Consulate in Jerusalem dated April, 1931 and allowing him to reside m Egypt for a period of one year, fol lowing this, the report adds, Ibn Rafada Avrote letters to many men of theHuwaifat tribe living in Egyptian territory or tak ing refuge therein and used to receive many of them in his house at Shubra until May, 1932. When all the neces sary preparations were completed he moved with his men to Suez. Permits used to be issued to these men by Egyp tian officials to cross Egyptian terri tory.” (The writer reproduces the text of one of these permits dated May 10, 1932 as published in Umm el 'Kura). “These facts supported by official documents clearly indicate, firstly, that Ibn Rafada’s revolt was designed in Cairo with the knowledge of the Egyp tian authorities and secondly, that the rebels gathered together in Egyptian territory and crossed Sinai on their way to the Hedj’az Avith the knowledge of the Frontier’s Authorities. ft is un reasonable to suppose that the Egyptian authorities did not feel that the mobilisa tion of this force was something unusual and Avas intended to cause a serious movement. We wish to ask the Sulky Cabinet this question: suppose Ibn Ra fada was designing a movement in Egypt • against Italy in Tripoli or against France in Syria or against England in Palestine. \Vouhl it have closed its eyes to this extent to his activities or would it not have hastened to arrest him and his supporters and to deport them cut of Egypt ? ’ (The writer then proceeds to argue, in an ambiguous manner, that the Britisn authorities exploited Ibn Rafada s ^ re_ volt to occupy Akaba and to get King Ibn Saoud to acknowledge it as a part of Transjordan territory).fl (**/\* f J Ctwmhf [ Mr. Walton, At Mr. xiendel's request I attended a meeting at the Foreign Office on 21st September to consider the policy to he followed in order to bring about the stabilisation and improvement of relations between the Hedjaz-Nejd and Trans-Jordan. The question is one in which the India Office is only very indirectly concerned - to the extent, in other words, that a definite breach between/#in Saud and the Anir Abdullah might have unfortunate reactions on our general relations with Ibn Saud. As you will remember there is strong reason to believe that the Amir Abdullah was at the bottom of the Ion Aafatida revolt, and while conclusive proof is lacking, circumstantial evidence is convincing. Ibn saud himself has never had any doubt on this question and on the 5th August (see Jedda telegram 151 of 8th August on P.Z.4841/32 flagged) he addressed a strong remonstrance to us, making certain proposals for the future, sir Andrew Fyan*s comments on the memorandum 7c memorandum will de found in Jedda telegram 165 of 21st August, on P.Z.5138. It was decided that the question as a whole should he left over for discussion with His Majesty's Minister on arrival in this country. The foreign Office memorandum enclosed in Lr. Warner’s letter o£ 21st September at flag h is a convenient summary of the points in issue and his record of the proceedings at the meeting on that day gives a clear account of the course of the discussion, which it is unnecessary to summarise. We shall in due course he asked for our concurrence in the action proposed (though it is of very little interest to us) and you may care to see how the land lies at this stage.^ ,/ r 2 v ^ i0 S al L teco J &lt; JJ f ^Jiterdepartmental Meeting held at the foreign Office on 31st September to con sider the policy to be followed in order to bring about the stabilisation and improvement of relations between the Hejaz-Hejd and Transjordan, a g n, ,.t: Mr. Hendel (Foreign Office) , in the Chair. Sir A. %an. His Majesty’s Minister to the Hejas and Nejd. Mr. C. Warner, Foreign Office. Mr, O.G.B. Williams, Colonial Office. Mr. K*w. Blaster, 11 * Mr* J.G. Laithwaite, India Office. I. The attached note, prepared in the Foreign Office, was taken as the basis of discussion. Mr. RSftDEL out lined the present position as described in the note and it was at once agreed that the request embodied in King Ibn laud’s personal and private memorandum of the 6th August for the removal of the Amir Abdullah from the position of Amir of Transjordan could in no cir cumstances be acceded to* Whatever action His Majesty’s Government might eventually, in certain cir cumstances, be obliged to consider taking against the Amir, there could be no question of taking drastic measures against him at Ibn Gaud’s request or at the present stage. n. Mr. RENDEL then proposed that the meeting should discuss the question of the guarantees, which both King....Kina: Ibn laud and the Vnir Abdullah deaire to secure from His Majesty's Government. Kin?' Ibn 'laud had pro posed in his memorandum as an alternative to the removal of the /Amir that His Majesty's Government should guarantee no interference by Transjordan in the affairs of the Hejaa and Hejd, and the Amir Abdullah had expressed, the wish that His Majesty's Government should guarantee the observance by Ibn 3aud of obliga tions to be undertaken by him in any treaty which might follow upon mutual recognition. Mr. iiKMGKL doubted whether, in point of fact, His Majesty’s Government could escape from the responsibility for the Amir Abdullah's observance of his obligation towards King Ibn laud if only in view of their mandatory responsi bility for Transjordan. In these circumstances It was for consideration whether It might not be best for His Majesty’s Government frankly to recognize that responsibility by themselves becoming a party to any treaty settlement that might be reached. Sir AhGREW RYAN said that he thought it very un desirable that His Majesty's Government should give to King Ibn laud a formal guarantee of such a nature as to make them jointly responsible with the Amir for any misdemeanour of his affecting King Ibn «ud. The latter would not fail to avail himself of it at every opportunity and to hold His Majesty's Government directly responsible, even very probably to the extent of claiming financial compensation direct from His Majesty's Government for damage resulting from any Transjordan raid on the Kejaz and Nejd.3. This argument was generally accepted and it was agreed that it was important if possible to avoid, placirg His Majesty’s Government in such a position. Mr. WILLIAMS suggested that it might be possible to satisfy King Ibn Sand's desire for a guarantee by secur ing from the Amir Abdullah an undertaking to Hie Majesty's Government to observe the obligations involved in the proposed settlement, end notifying King Ibn laud formally that such an undert&amp;King had been given to His Majesty's Government. ^—- In reply to a question. Sir A. rtf AN said that, though he thought it unlikely that King Ibn laud would drop his request for a guarantee by His Majesty's Gov ernment, he did not think it altogether impossible, if Ibn 'Mud secured recognition by the Amir Abdullah as King of the Hejaz as well as of Nejd. He explained that King Ibn Gaud would, in his opinion, regard such recognition as a great success. Ibn laud had told his Ulema and the Akhwan after the Ibn Hifada rebellion that they must leave to him the settlement of the political questioisat issue with Transjordan and that he ms seeking a solution of then and would let then know the result by the middle of October. He would be in a strong position if he could tell the Ulema and the Akhwan that his handling of the issue with Transjordan had been so successful that the Amir Abdullah had recognised his sovereignty over the Hejaz. 3ir A. HYAK thought therefore that it ms important to reply to King Ibn Gaud's memorandum before the middle of October, and that it would be well worth trying in that reply to satisfy Ibn laud, without promising to give him the guarantee for which he has asked....— 4. asksd i »&gt;y iEiXoTTnin^ lilnj tjiic Amiy Abdullslk wrs prepared to recognise him at once and thereafter to undertake negotiations for a treaty settlement of the questionsat issue between then, and that His Majesty's Government would do all they could to bring about a settlement satisfactory to both sides. After some discussion, the meeting agreed (a) to recore end that this course should be adopted; i.e. an attempt should he made to bring about bilateral mutual recognition between llm 'feud and the Amir, to be followed by a bilateral treaty settlement, His Majesty's Government taking guarantees from the Amir Abdullah and informing Ibn Stud accordingly, but not giving the latter any direct guarantee themselves; (b) that it was very likely, however, that King Ibn 3aud would press his demand for guarantees from His Majesty's Government; (c) that in that case it would probably be best for His Majesty’s Government to accede to that request, but that a formal guarantee to Ibn feud of the type deprecated by Gir A. ^yan should, jf possible, be avcMed; . that a solu tion of this difficulty might possibly be found in the proposal that the bilateral treaty should be accompanied by an exchange of notes between His Majesty's Government and King Ibn laud, binding His Majesty's Government to use their authority with the Amir to ensure that he observed the treaty in return for an undertaking from Ibn Gaud to His Majesty's Government that he would also ob serve it; (e) that in the last resort it might be necessary to consider participation by His Majesty's Government in a tripartite treaty, which would place both the Amir Abdullah and King Ibn feud under obligations to ♦* * * * \to His Majesty's Oovernment, would cover the Amir's reouest for a guarantee from Hi* Majesty's Government as well as that of Ibn %ud, and would probably to sene extent, meet the objection inherent in a direct guarantee by His Majesty's Government of the Amir Abdullah's correct behaviour towards King Ibn gaud. The meeting then proceeded to consider the ques tions connected with the proposed recognition of King Ibn aaud by the Amir Abdullah. It ms generally agreed that recognition should be mutual. In reply to a question, 3ir Andrew uyan said that, so far as he could judge, Ibn Saud would probably not refuse to recognise the Amir, Mr. I!®DEL then raised the question whether recognition should be by an exchange of letters or by a simple treaty of friendship on the model of that recently concluded between Transjordan and Iraq. The conclusion was reached that the simplest possible method of recognition would be the least likely to lead to complications. 3ir A. HYAH thought that any treaty, however simple, would necedftlt&amp;te lengthy negotiation, and that it would be difficult to prevent King Ibn 3aud Insisting on various difficult questions being settled before any treaty was concluded . Ever the briefest and most purely formal treaty would almost Inevitably raise the question of HI* Majesty's Government's participation and the proposed guarantees, which it was desired to III evade....6 . evade till after recognition. lii these circumstance* the meeting agreed to recorartend that His Majesty's Governs snt should aim at arranging for recognition toy letters to be addressed to His Majesty’s Government, (i) in the case of the Amir through the High Ooramisnioner for Transjordan, and (li) in the case of Ibn 3aud through 3ir A, ityan. In this way , no Question would arise as to which of the two rulers should write first to the other, and much complication would toe avoided. greatest importance that the question of the Southern frontier of Transjordan and the Maan-Akaba area should not be allowed to arise in connexion either with the proposed recognition or with the subsequent treaty settl erient. Consideration was then given to the difficult question of the form of words which King Ibn 3aud should use in recognising the Arair, having regard, on the one hand, to the position of the Amir under the Mandate, and, on the other, to Ibn baud's insistence hitherto on treating the Amir as a mere local governor appointed by Hie Majesty's Government. After much discussion it mii agreed to recommend that the formula 'recognises His 'Highness the Amir Abdullah a*? Kuler of the State of 'Transjordan ‘ would be in accordance with the terms of the Agreement between the United Kingdom and Transjordan of 1»36, and would at the same time sufficiently provide for recognition toy Ibn 9»ud of the Amir’s more of less sovereign status. It was considered that the The meeting further agreed that it was of the attention7. attention of Sir A. Wauchope, who would naturally have to be consulted, on the whole question under discussion, should te special ly drawn to these points and to the importance of finding an appropriate Arabic translation of the word 'ruler*. IV. It having been agreed, as recorded above, that it seemed best that mutual recognition should be a separate first stage In our policy of caonroeheroent. to be followed by negotiations for a treaty settlement, the meeting next took up questions connected with such a treaty settlement* It was agreed that under this pro* cedure the original suggestion for a brief general treaty of friendship as a separate stage need not be further pursued. Sir A. HYAN said that there could be little or no doubt that King Ibn '-bud would agree to no treaty that was not accompanied by an arrangement regarding the extradition of tribal offenders. Mr. REN DEI* pointed out that in fact this question of tribal offenders was the crux of the whole matter of a raonroehament , between the Hajass-Nejd and Transjordan. There were two main difficulties: (a) that the High Commissioner for Transjordan and the Transjordan authorities had hitherto considered it impossible to make any arrangement for the extradition of tribesmen for such crimes as Ibn Saud had in mind, vis. raiding, attacks on Governmentferees, insurrection, etc., etc.; (b) that such crimes appeared to fall into the category ci i! * * * *8. of political offences, and that It 1« contrary to British policy to agree to the extradition of political offenders. Mr. SAHSES suggested that the competent authorities at the Colonial Office and Foreign Office should be asked to examine this second difficulty sore closely than had yet been done, and particularly to see whether the arrangement made in April 1«31 between the Hejas- I.ejd and Iraq did not provide an acceptable way out of the difficulty. He suggested further that the cir cumstances in Arabia were so abnormal that a departure from the strict canons of ordinary practice might well be justifiable. It was agreed that the problem should at once be examined in order that, if any solution of difficulty (b) could be found, it should be referred to Air A. s.auchope for his views on the practical side of the question. It seemed unlikely to the nesting that it would be possible to complete an examination of the question in time to deal with it in the reply to Ibn -leud'e mersontndurr. of the 6th August; but the meeting agreed that, ehould it b» po-^lble to inform Ibn %«d at an early date that Hi« Majesty's Oovernmeot con sidered it possible to make an arrangement regarding the extradition of tribal offenders on lines similar to those embodied in the agreement bat,wean the : ejaz-Nejd and Iron, the chuices of bringing the policy under dis cussion to a successful issue would be enormously in creased. The meeting next considered the desiderata put for ward by the Amir Abdullah for inclusion in any treaty settleneat....geVfclarafent (see paragraph 5 of Transjordan Jecrot despatch of the 3rd SepteaherS. It was felt unanimously that two of these must be ruled out at once, viz., the Amir's requests (ai that recognition by Ibn aud of the de facto southern frontier of Transjordan should be dananded (see above;; and (b) that Ihn '«ud should undertake to put in order the auction of the Kejaz uail my lying in Hejazi territory. It had already be®; agreed earlier in the meeting that it was desirable to uo nothing which might dis turb kot even prematurely crystallize, tf’.e pro visional settl«aent of the frontier, and, aa regards (b; the settled policy of his Majesty's dovernment is to leave the Question of the Hejaal section of the tiejaa Hallway in abeyance. The two other points raised by the Amir, necaely, that the t ilgrimage should be open to the iteilr and his family, and that the heirs of King Hussein should have the right to appoint an agent of their own choice to look after their property in the Hejaz, seeaed reason- able and unlikely to present much difficulty. » [ r. rabblAia’a suggested that a eetUemeat of the long-standing euestioa of the unrcasoaable levy of 3ikat tax by Ibn Taud on Transjordan tribesmen temporarily in the Hejaz or Kejd should also, if possible, be included in any treaty settlement. This view met with general agreement. V. The meeting finally considered the lines of the reply to be made to King Ibn fiaud's memorandum of the 6th August. The outline of a reply proposed at the end....10, en-i of t &gt;e attached Foreign office note can- altered suitable, save that it was agreed that the references to the Awlr abdullah as a ,l Sovereign^ were incorrect and should be changed to 'Huler' or some such expression, and that it was felt that, in re ferring to the proposed negotiations for a treaty, a more genera! expression than 'treaty of friendship* should be uaed. It was agreed that the Foreign office should prepare a draft of a reply to Ibn 3aud on the above lines, on which, in view of the desirability of making a reply to him before the middle of October, dir A. tmichop* should be consulted by telegram. The Colonial Office agreed to prepare an explanatory telegram to Sir A. Sauchope on the whole situation for the con currence of the Foreign Office and India Office. The problem connected with the extradition of tribnl offenders should be examined in detail at the Foreign Office and. the Colonial Office, with particu lar reference to the possibility of offering Ibn laud some arrangement corresponding to that which he had alreaclr concluded with Iraq, and this point should be referred to Ur A. wauchope as soon as possible.f FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1.

The receipt of iim Baud’s personal and private saeiaoranauia of the 6th August shows that either our muter standing of the Hej&amp;s-Heid Covernaent s proposal was wrong, or that they have changed their attitude. It contains two alternative proposals for improving relations between the Hejass-feJd and Transjordan:- (a) that the Amir Abdullah should be removed; (b * that ills Majesty* b Government should guarantee non interference by Transjordan in the affairs of the- hejas;-- ejd. The first, (a;, is of course ruled out; but Sir A.

Whether we can also give to the Amir Abdullah a guarantee for the performance by Ibn baud of any obligations which he would undertake uncter the proposed treaty, is a matter for serious consideration. But in all the circumstances, it may be considered that Bis Majesty’s Government could properly participate in a tripartite treaty, thus to some extent guaranteeing to both Ibn Baud and the Amir Abdullah the observance by the other 1 1 ; ^ Web - ' of its terms. G I *- -h\ ( p- r r ‘ !«• ^ v ^ 4 % ' * A V‘ rvA^ To complete the process of ra p ■ .^• ocheiacnt , tne following steps appear necessary:~ kWk (1} mtual recognition between Ibn laud and the Amir l' fo ctw V' -j* i whi./ww 6 o’Wi ^ Abdullah, S(S) treaty of friendship; (3) an arrangement regarding tribal offenders* Before we can reply to Ibn Baud's personal and private aemorandua of the 6th Augustt wust decide whetner these steps *•. .B tepB are to be cabined or taxen eeparately. Ab r8gnrd8 (1), Wm recognition, I understand from £i r a. Kyan that he anticipate, no very great difficulty. He aoee not think that the ann-Akaba question need ariee in thie connection. He believes that I bn ; aud will regard it as a great scoop to secure hie recognition by the Amir Abdullah as ruler of the Heiat, and that to achieve this he will be ready to recognise the Amis nbuullah as ruler of Transjordan and to let the Masn-Akaba Question sleep. Sir A. Pyan considers it important, however, that it should be maoe clear to Ibn r,aud at the outset that he 1. required to recognise the Amir Abdullah as a ruling prince, since Ibn '.ud always affects re t '—'ic t i . .,.d r to regard him as a mere iff^Tlrrr^ppolnted by Hi 8 ? fajegty’s Government* , . A slr A * I ’believe, com iderr thfit ste^ (l3t~5nd (3) above will have to be taken concurrently, i.e. that Jbn n ud v-ill •ake no treaty of friendship without some arrangement for dealing with tribal o fencer&amp;. the objection has been raised that any arrangement which would satisfy Ibn Baud would involve the extradition of tribal offendera for offence© which V01,ld normally be considered political, and that this would be contrary to established practice* If His majesty r © Government were, not participant© or guarantor© of the arrange- aent, this objection would perhaps have aot r Tie n force. In &amp;ny case, the situation is so peculiar and exceptional that it &lt;aight be held to justify a departure from precedent. Hone ic©B, the ernes lion is a difficult one, and it© careful examination will doubtless take some time. i'he Am ir Abdu 11 ah’ s aeslaera ta may a lap lead to diIficulty • * •difficulty in concluding a treaty. Borne of them (a© recorded in paragraph 5 of 1 ra. ns Jordan secret d eapa tch oT the 3rd September) must, I think, be ruled out at the start, visr,. ~ (i) Ibn Baud’s recognition of the ae facto southern frontier of Trans Jordan; and 1*1) that Ibn Baud should put in order the section of the lie &amp;z railway lying in liejazi territory, (iii) and (iv), (that the Pilgrimage should be open to the /uair and his family, and that the heirs of King Hussein should have the right to appoint an agent of their own choice to Iook after their properties in the Hejaz) are more possible of fulfilment, ana might well be put forward, but the introduction of such matters will probably compli cate ncgotiatione. In view of these considerations, the balance of advantage seems to lie on the side of arranging for M- recognition as a first and separate stage, and leaving the negotiation of the treaty of friendship and an arrangement about tribal offenders to be aealt with subsequently. A further argument in favour of this course 1 b that recogni tion need not necessarily involve the question of guarantees by His Majesty’s Government. Eft ply to be ianae to Ibn Baud’s Memorandum of the It is very desirable that we should reply to the •memorandum oy the raiaale of October; for Sir A. K’yen has been informed by Fuad Bey Kami a that, when exerting himself t0 restrain the Akhw&amp;m from giving effect to their desire Ip attack Transjordan, Ibn ! aua tola them that he had taken 6th August steps » • *steps to bring about a solution of the bad relatione between Transjordan end the Hejass-Ne d, and promieed to inform them of the result at a gathering in t0&lt;*lie.ju in the middle of October. fe have elnce then had references in other conneotionr, to the urgent need for an early re Jy on the whole question. i.he ear‘ly pm t of* Ibn baudls iaeiaomnaUitt reverts to the old question of the Amir Abdullah’s responsibility for the Ibn Rife da rebellion. We are not on safe ground in pursuing this piilih4rnl y-, and have^/desire to do so. It see;as best, tiie ref ore, that in any reply to the neaoranduni we shoii j u tfitv© the line that its purpose was to propound two solutions ol the difficulties existing between Transjordan and the He.laz-uejd, and go straight to our answer on the subject of those two solutions, without reference to the question of the hair Abdullah’s responsibility. On the assumption that the proposals in the foregoing paragraphs are in general approved, the reply to Ibn baud’s memorandum might be on the following lines:- hie Majesty’s Government, who have consistently pursued a policy of promoting gooa relations between the Hejaz-hejd, to which they entertain sentiments of sincere friendship, and Transjordan, in regard to which they occupy a special position, have given the most careful consideration to the proposals put forward in the memorandum for bringing about an improvement in the present unhappy relations between the two countries. They desire to make it clear at the outset that they are unable to contemplate any change in the present situation as regards the person of the ruler of ’ransjordan, and they consider that many of the difficulties 1 hich have arisen in the past are due to the fact that the rulersrule re of the Ke&gt;z-j.eja ana TrancjorOati have not hitherto recognised each other's [eevereAgnjstatus in rcgara to Transjordan ana the Hejae-Eejd respectively.

Mb Ms^eaty' b Govemoient suggest that the question of mutual r^cogo.ition should toe nettled independently of any other question affecting the relations between the uh tli e,jcl and irans^oi d£in^ out on the definite understanding that negotiations will then toe undertaken with the least possible delay, with a view to the conclusion of a treaty of friendship between the two tates* Pursuing as they do the ideal of promoting the full development of all Mates in which they have a special interest, they consider that such a treaty should, toe concluded direct between the jsovereigns j of the two Arab bates concerned. Nevertheless, they are prepared, having regard to their own special position, to take part in the negotiations with a view to promoting the conclusion of an agreement safeguarding on honourable terms the interests of both the countries immediately concerned, i'hcy consider that they can in this way best contribute to the .fulfilment of the wish so often expressed by His Majesty king ..bdul Aziz ana hie Government» that the relations between the he^as-he^d and Transjordan should form the subject of a settlement similar to that so happily achieved last year in the case of the Hejaz-Kejd and Iraq. %hen the proposeu treaty is concluded, they will use their best assv ' b«et endeavours to secure the loyal execution of its tense in accordance with their desire that the treaty should be a factor o', stability In Arabia, and a iseans whereby the disputes, which have unhappily arisen in the past, more especially in regard to questions arising on the ooavon frontiers of the two tates, raay be obviated in the future.

[E 4402/70/25] Ko. hq ^o Sir A. Ryan to Sir John Simon.—(Received Auaust 30 \ (No. 350.) y &gt; Sl1 ’ T , . ! Jedda, August 15, 1932. ^ ITS reference to my telegram No. 159 of the 12th August I have the honour to forward herewith a precis of the large number of articles &amp;c published m the first number of the “ Umm-al-Qura,” that of the 5th Ammst’ issuea after the defeat of Ibn Rifada at Jebel Shar.( J ) These documents give a better idea than anything I could myself write of the storm raised in this country by the Ibn Rifada affair, not so much because of the importance of that affair m itself as because of the universal belief that the Amir of Transiordan is the real enemy, and that it was he who launched the rebellion You will note the insistence on the word “ jihad/’ a familiar term to Europeans Hardly less significance attaches to the recurrence of the word “ muhafiqun ” or hypocrites the name given by the prophet, as Hughes says, “to those residents of A1 Madinah’ who during his first stay m that city ostensibly joined Islam, but in secret were disaffected.” Their memory is execrated by all good Moslems. 2. The various telegrams addressed to the King mark doubtless the response to an impulse from the centre, but no one who knows the history of the Akhwan and the independent spirit of people like the Llama of Nejd can suppose that Ibn Saud has simply turned on a tap which he can as easily turn off. He and his advisers still hold by the theory that, when he made war on the Akhwan in 1929, he was choosing between two evils and elected to reduce his own subjects rather than embroil himself with Great Britain and Iraq. It is suggested, and indeed it has been definitely stated to me by Fuad Bey Hamza, that the King, if confronted by a similar dilemma to-day, would not go against the Akhwan for the sake of Transjordan or the Amir Abdullah. It is fortunately recognised that the factor of Great Britain remains common to the two situations. I believe Ibn Saud to be sincerely anxious to avoid a conflict with His Majesty’s Govern ment. Hence the decision, which I recorded in my telegram No. 162 of the 15th August, to head the Akhwan off with a promise to explain the situation to them further and to report progress two months hence. I have reported in other despatches on the King’s insistence on the view that there can be no real peace unless the Amir Abdullah is eliminated. 3. I do not say that, if the Akhwan simmer down now, they will necessarily boil up again to the same extent in October or that Ibn Saud will necessarily press his views regarding the Amir to their logical conclusion. I do, however, see possibilities of grave danger ahead, having regard to the strength of the religious feeling which has been aroused, and the hatred with which the King regards the Amir, whose complicity in the Ibn Rifada affair and other attempts to destroy his regime admits of no doubt in His Majesty’s mind. 4. The “ Umm-al-Qura ” of the 12th August contained nothing of interest equal to that of the special number of the 5th August. The following are the principal items :— (n) A further telegram, again undated, from Ibn Aqil, a summary of which was given in my telegram No. 160 of the 13th August. I enclose a translation of this./) (5) An article intended to elucidate some of the historical aspects of the Ibn Rifada affair. I enclose a brief summary of the principal facts alleged in this/ 1 ) (c) An article on the aftermath of the Ibn Rifada affair which describes the still growing ferment in the interior; the receipt of further messages from the Qahtan country, Abba, Jizan and Jauf; the continued insistence by the forces at Taif on their previous demands; ( 1 ) Not printed. [542 gg—2]2 the steps taken to complete the purging of the northern area reported in Ibn Aqil’s telegram; and the efforts to allay excitem ^ and to arrive at a political settlement made by the King, who never fought except in self-defence with the help of God. ’ as (d) The text of the loyal memorial of the townsmen, which had alre H appeared in the ‘ c Saut-al-Hejaz ” and which is noted at the foot f the first enclosure in this despatch. w 5. I may mention one other matter dealt with in the “ Umm-al-Qura ” which bears on the relations between the King and the Amir Abdullah. A short article headed “For Amusement ” in the number of the 5th August referred ironically to a projected Arab conference, as being a thing for which the name Arab is too great. Its members would be fugitive hypocrites and brigands meeting by order of “ the big devil ” and under the supervision of his assistants It would discuss the means of fomenting disturbance. Its decisions would be misleading, deceits, &amp;c. Its results would be to reveal still further to the Islamic and Arab worlds the evil intent of the participators. In the number of the 12th August there appears a caution to the effect that the reference was to a report in a Transjordan newspaper about an “ Arab conference for Trans jordan,” which, according to the paper in question, was to be held at Amman to discuss injustice in the Hejaz. I have seen many references in reports from Jerusalem to the pan-Arab Congress which has been contemplated in certain quarters for some time past, but I know nothing of any proposal to hold a separate conference at Amman. The caution in the last number of the “ Umm-al-Qura” would appear to suggest that the editor did not wish the article published on the 5th August to be taken as applying to the projected pan-Arab Congress, which, so far as I am aware, has not as yet attracted much attention here. 6.

'When Sheikh Yussuf Yasin did come to Jedda he gave me full measure. He arrived on the 19th July, and did not leave until this afternoon. We met on the 21st July, and had eight interviews up to the morning of the 31st July, plus, two more last evening and this morning to discuss the suggested intervention of King Feisal to bring Ibn Saud and the Amir Abdullah into better relations. It is interesting to note that Sheikh Yussuf carried on, although Fuad Bey Hamza returned to Taif on the 24th July. There was a precedent for this last year, when Fuad Bey came back from leave, but the prolongation of Sheikh Yussuf’s / actingship was not so great. It has been ingeniously suggested to me in a foreign quarter that on this occasion the delay is due to the fact that Sheikh Yussuf is acting for the titular Minister, the Amir Feisal, and will not vacate his functions until the prince himself returns. It is at least equally possible that Fuad Bey is a quickly in the middle of the torrent let loose by Ibn Rifada. I may say that, while the King is in a good mood, I prefer to deal with Sheikh Yussuf Yasin, who can be very difficult, but reflects his master more faithfully than Fuad Bey. 3. My conversations with Sheikh Yussuf, from the 21st July up to to-day, vere of wider range than those in June. In addition to matters directly connected with the rebellion in the north, w r e discussed the Ad Dabbagh plot on the lines recorded in despatches to Aden, of which I have sent you copies, and a fair amount of current business, with which I have dealt, so far as is necessary, in separate reports. My present object is to amplify somewhat my telegrams dealing with the principal subject, without attempting to reproduce them completely. 4. On the 21st July I mentioned the prolonged detention of the French ketch, which had been arrested at Wejh at the end of May, and in which I had acquired a direct interest owing to the discovery that there were two British subjects on board. Sheikh Yussuf told me that she had been liberated on her arrival in Jedda the day before. I subsequently learnt that four of the crew, including one of the British subjects, had been left behind at Wejh, but I understood from Sheikh Yussuf on the 22nd July that they, too, were free, 1 ascertained a few- days later from Suez that the British subject concerned had got back to that place, and I have not since concerned myself further in this affair. 5. I also spoke to Sheikh Yussuf on the 21st July about the recent arrests m Jedda, which I said were a little on my conscience, as the victims were expressly stated to have been arrested for spreading rumours, and the action taken might be attributed to what I had said about the prevalence of dangerous reports in June in one particular connexion. I reminded him that he had then told me that EASTERN (Arabia). August 18, 1932. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 3 . [E 4187 / 76 / 25 ] i Si?‘ A.

I suggested that they had reverted instead t 0 what he would forgive my calling the old Turkish method. They had arrested people for talking, and had published nothing but variants on t- ibn Rifada and his party are where they were. Please God they will soon be destroyed.' Sheikh Yussuf said that the arrests had really been made in connexion with the Ad Dabbagh affair, which we had already discussed. After some further exchanges on this subject, I spoke about the position m the Wadi Sirhan. Hey had accused the Amir Abdullah of trying to foment disturbance there. I had reported the accusation, but, as it was of little use to discuss Hejazi suspicions of the Amir, I was more interested in the question whether there was, in fact, disturbance in the W^adi Sirhan. My latest infoimation was that none was known to exist. We then spoke of the difficulties of wireless communication between Hejazi and Transjordan stations, a question which has been fully dealt with by telegraph. 6. Our conversations on the 22nd, 23rd and 25th July related very largely to the position of the Amir Abdullah, which the sheikh introduced by avowing his belief in oral discussion of questions that might become “too fundamental” if dealt with in official correspondence. As this subject may still be important, I enclose an extract^) from my record of what passed on the 22nd July. I have sufficiently summarised in my Saving telegram No. 6 of the 26th July the more diffuse conversations of the 23rd and 25th July, both of which were wearisome and the sound of which was acid. I need only add that, when, for tactical reasons, I pressed my hypothetical question as to whether the Hejazi Government would consider a tribunal under article 6 of the Hadda Agreement an appropriate means of investigating an accusation by the Amir or the Transjordan Government against Ibn Baud, the sheikh ended a series of evasions by saying that he could not answer it without consulting his Government, whereupon I said that he had said enough for my purpose, and withdrew it rather than take the risk of its being hawked about in the Council of Ministers, and perhaps misconstrued. Next morning, when serenity was restored, I reminded Sheikh Yussuf of the hypothetical nature of that particular question and of the unequivocal nature of the answer which I had said I should: give to it, namely, that a joint tribunal under article 6 could in no circumstances be a suitable means of investigating an accusation brought against Ibn Saud. 7. I may here mention that, at the end of the conversation of the 23rd July, Sheikh Yussuf asked whether he might speak as a purely private individual and tell me what he would think if he were British. He suggested that His Majesty’s Government might be expected to say, in effect: “ Here’s Abdullah, a rotten fellow, who causes us endless trouble and expense. Here’s Ibn Saud, powerful and well-disposed. We’ll plump for Ibn Saud.” I explained to him at length that, after a system containing elements of stability had emerged out of events in Arabia since toefore the Great War, in which the Hashimites had done much to help, it was not a question for His Majesty’s Government of choosing between two rulers, but of maintaining friendship with both and promoting good relations between them. I told him what I should think, if I were a Nejdi. I need not enlarge on this, for I am afraid that my Nejdiness was at least as much coloured by British ideas as the sheikh’s assumed British outlook was affected by hatred of the Hashimites. We had, however, a very amusing private exchange of views and nearly exchanged headgear at the end of it. 8. The conversations of the 26th, 27th and 29th July related mainly to other matters, but on the 27th July we dealt with one or two points which haven bearing on Transjordan. Sheikh Yussuf startled me by speaking of President Hoover’s disarmament proposal on the lines described in my Saving telegram No. 8 of the 27th July. He was evidently thinking in terms of security for Hejaz-Nejd, with special reference to security on the Transjordan^ side. I took the opportunity of telling him that morning that H.M.S. “ Hastings ” had had to leave for the Mediterranean, and that it had become rather a question as to how H.M.S. “ Penzance ” could be most usefully employed; but, as I had ha no reply to my telegram No. 138 of the 24th July, 1 did not dwell on this problem or give Sheikh Yussuf an opportunity of expressing views. I pointed on, however, that it was increasingly important for us to be informed as to the military situation. This elicited some information, which I duly telegrap e to you and which is now out of date.

On the 31st July Sheikh Yussuf telephoned the news of the defeat of Ibn Rifada, and called later. After he had answered some questions on that subject, 1 gave him General Wauchope’s message about the party oi Amran tribesmen who had crossed the frontier into Transjordan, near Rum. I also asked him about the army at 1 aif, which he had mentioned incidentally two days before as needing all the attention of Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, who could not therefore deal immediately with the Shell benzine affair. I elicited the private and confidential information summed up in my telegram No. 141 of the 30th July. We had some talk about the press, a prepos mainly of the “ Times ” article of the 14th July.^ I headed off a suggestion that I should ask His Majesty’s Government to influence the press. 1 said that I had observed the general attitude of the papers pretty closely, and had seen nothing very terrible except in the “Daily Herald” and certain Egyptian papers. Sheikh Yussuf spoke of the refusal of the 'Morning Post” to print a letter from Sheikh Hafiz Wahba refuting something that had appeared in it. I said that the columns of the “ Times ” were always open. 10. I enclose the Hejazi communique, which reached me later in the day.f 1 ) It adds nothing to what I telegraphed, but the preamble about “ deceivers ” behind the rebels is of some interest. I have not sent home such few communiques as were issued during the previous two or three weeks, as they were almost uniformly uninformative. I have not troubled you, either, with various articles in the local press. They consisted of the usual tirades, weighed with excerpts from foreign papers, mainly Egyptian, which were reproduced to show that some people at any rate took a sane view of the situation in the Hejaz. 11. I am dealing in a separate despatch with my conversations with Sheikh Yussuf Yasin on the evening of the 31st July and morning of the 1st August about King EeisaPs proposed intervention. 12.

He usually stays at the Palestine Hotel. He has telephone conversations with the Amir Abdalla and if the Amir is absent, he speaks to Abdul Raouf Sabban.

Your Excellency, I have the honour to refer to your letters No. CF/48/32 of the 25th and 26th July,1932, on the subject of the activities of Hussein Abdulla Dabbagh and Abdul Raouf Sabban. Abdul Raouf Sabban is a Hejazi of some 35 years of age who has been in opposition to Ibn Saoud since the latter’s occupation of the Hejaz. \ In 1925 he was Proprietor of n Al Omma”, a newspaper published In Sgypt and has travelled frequently between that place and Trans-Jordan. When the Amir was made a grant of the land in Trans-Jordan he appointed Abdul Raouf a member of the Committee of Management and pays him £P.12 per month. I Informed you In my 192/Sec of the 2nd June, 1932, that the leading members of the Hi zb e! Hej’azi in Egypt were Abdul Melik Khatib and Hussein el Dabbagh, and that Abdul Raouf el Sabban is the principal representative of the Society in Trans-Jordan. In my 192/Sec of the 11th June, 1932, the name of Tahir ed Dabbagh was given as a Hejazi resident in Aden who is a member of the Society and subscribes to its funds. In mv above mentioned letter of the 2nd June I stated that probably an attempt to raise funds for the Hizb el Hejazi would be made in Trans -Jordan, but I nave no evidence that this has been done. Bxcelle ncy The High Commissioner for Trans-Jordan, JERUSALEM.Kaou, S abb an is regarded as the local paymaster of the Hizb el Hejazi and I was informed on , the morning of the 26th instant that some 25 days ago, whilst ibn Rifada was still at Sherieh, Massaoud Dabbagh went to Ma'an and by the help of the Naimat Bedn got through to Ibn Rifada with £.300 Egyptian which, m all probability, he had received from Abdoul Raonf. The camelmen who got Massaoud Dabbagh through came back w ith the story which has been current that 9 of Ibn A ! c Saoud's cars had been attacked and two destroyed. \ Massaoud has remained with Ibn Rifada in order to keep this end supplied with information; under King Hussein he was a clerk in Akaba, he is a man of low character who has been employed in the past for a short time as an ajent of the Government at the reqtiest of the Amir’s Secretary Hamid el Wady; latterly and until the day of his departure he has kept a small shop in Amman. Aodul Raoud bah can, Massaoud Dabbagh and a man named mohameu. Amin Shanqiti have all been used for writing against Ibn Saoud and in favour of the Rifada movement, and Shanqiti is alleged to be sender of the telegram recently addressed to me and I believe to Yonr Excellency as well from Damascus complaining against the English for interfering in the Moslem affair between Rifada and Ibn Saoud, The Government have exerted their influence recently to dissuade the Amir from egging the people on to protest against the arrest of Sherif Mohamed Ali Bedeimq., the prohibition of the export of foodstuffs to the Hejaz and Nejd, the formation of the prohibited zone and the tearing down of Your Excellency’s Proclamation, and this has culminated in a sharp difference between the_____________I the Government and the Amir over this man Shanqlti, Y.'ho in accordance with a decision taken and agreed to by the Amir some time ago was to be bound over- to keep the peace. Thls Shanqiti recently returned to Amman from Damascus, where he Is believed to have been engaged in the Amir s political business and w as accepted as a visitor in the Amir ! s Palace when the Chief Minister was a guest at the same time. The difference, has been so sharp that the Amir Lao uO get me to agree that his Government should be changed. To allow him to change his Government now would be a very serious mistake.

'Muhamed Salih Clufo Abdul Qassim Dabbagh of Amman granted visa for Trans- - ! - ' ■ • 1' • (at the request of the Palace'* . According to present information these persons have not yet arrived. The son of Audeh el Atneh of the Howeitat, who has been used before by the Amir as a messenger to the Hejas, came to Amman a few days ago having been detained and disarmed at Mudawwara en route. He said that the story was current in the Hejaz that All had arrived Tilth an army at Mudawwara, that Ibn Saoud had armed and was sending the Jeheinia and the Harb against Ibn Rifada and that the latter was getting supplies by sea from Suez. Ho one from whom I have enquired has heard of Osman Arab (your letter of 26.7.32) but Ahmed Melhas is a well known merchant of Amman.x have hitherto maintained that Abbas Hilmi ha s not supplied any money to the Hi z b el Hejazi, though I have no proof, there are a number of pointers which lead me to believe that I was wrong and that Abbas Hilmi i 3 the main source of supply.

Following are my observations on paragraphs as shown. 3. His Majesty 1 s Government are clearly not accountable to Ibn Saud for their policy in Transjordan or tiieir reasons for maintaining Amir. Latter is never*’ theless the crux of the whole situation because (a) he has persistently refused to recognise Ibn Baud and (b) there can now be little doubt that his intimate advisers if not he himself have been up to the neck in con spiracy of which Ibn Eifada affair was only one mani festation to undermine King’s position. 7nen the King speaks of aggression he does ,x)t mean organised attack of the kind contemplated in paragraph 4 of your telegram No. 76. He means any and every attempt on his position and he connects Anir with all of them. View underlying his second alternative is that as His Majesty’s Govern ment stand in the way of his punishing Amir they should control latter effectively i.e. not merely by applying remedies after the event as in Ibn Eifada affair but by destroying possibility of further 'aggression'. This he says necessitates guarantee by His Maje ty's Government because any undertaking by Anir would otherwise be worthless. This point of view may not be practical in yourv' ' I your sense but it is intelligible. 4 U jug King puts in tbe forefront wliat you consider side issue a I have exnausted iryself in efforts to persuade nim to relinquish discussion of responsibility and concentrato on rapprochement 0 Measure of my failure is afiordcd by his memorandum drawn up after he had wooin ed huuoeli of sorength of his position and of V/ociuneoo ci n.j eneiiiies arid, had allowed his growing hatred and misorust of Abdollah to master hjm a It Is no c adiiUuued here that agreement with Transjordan similar to wli.au with Iraq ever meant necessarily direct ag r a urn e at« 1 n.us oiay be argned e i t her v/ay but point has iosu j ls .trip oinance because I'i)u Baud admits change r of^ attitude towards ’the Aioir himself and rejects the idea of any agreement w.wuh him not guaranteed by Hie Majesty’s Government, As regards King Feisal 9 s intervention the sequence is thiso It only assumed Importance in Hejazi eyes after His Majesty’s Government had recommended its accept- anc-So I urged its advantage as first step to be taken wtuhout reference to possible later complications. King thon produced his memorandum last sentence of which was intended to convey the meaning rather vaguely expressed that if His Majesty’s Government pressed him to accept King Feisal* s intervention after considering rest of memorandum he would do so f . This quasi-promise is how ever illusory so long as ho maintains the view that Abdullah can in no circumstances be trusted. 5, I think it would be bettor to postpone any coianunication until you have seen text of memo ran dum 0 my conversation I have discouraged the hope of early reply In I ■!3* reply, ST said that I personally ms no likelihood of Abdullah's removal, and emphasized desire of I-iis Majesty's Government for rapprochement, despite recalcitrant attitude now^to totli parties. 6. Despatch in hag sent on August 17th records personal exchange of views with Fuad on August 11th. I can now refuse iiurther discussion pending receipt of instructions unless King' himself tackles me during expected visit to Jedda in which case I will try to get him to see the matter in true perspective. See however my remarks at 4 atove.^phy conclusions are as follows, (a) No progress can he made unless there is some prospect of inducing Mir to recognise Ihn Saud 0 (h) The idea of King Faisal’s intervention mighty he pursued hut I have personally lost faith in it. I should prefer to see His majesty’s Government take their own linOc (c) In any case Ihn Saud should have clear statement of His Majesty’s Government’s views as soon as you have seen his memorandum, (d) This state-* merit should make it clear without giving reasons that it is the fixed intention of His Majesty’s Government to maintain Amir, (e) It should close door on further discussion of responsibility whether on the part of His Majesty’s Government or of Mir for past events (this is easy as regards His Majesty’s Government. As regards Mir I fear when drafting paragraph 4 of my note of duly 10th I misread your telegram No. 76 and converted promise to consider the question of investigation into what was practically promise to investigate), (f) Statement should insist if such is the only kind of agreement : r ou contemplate case that the Is direct agreementagreement which His Majesty- 6 Govermeot will promote cut will not ionmlly guarantee, (g) It should urge necessity for rapprochement hut this is subject to (a) above. j.nis means taking firm lino with Ibn Gaud* if “ e “ “ M3t '%£!%£* “« «»» dangers rirsu al Liiough ^am&amp;ssssesesA of Aklrmn movement have pi o caely been exaggerated it is a real itv and if Jbn Gaud despairs of other means he may yield to pressure on hu,} to attack Transjordan which ho has resisted so fcm, secondly there are many influences at work to persuade, nim that despite recent evidence to the contrary His Kajoety’s Government are, at heart, un friendly* He still cannot conceive the possibility of their being equally friendly towards him and Abdullah* attitude may therefore help to convince him we arc really on the side of his enemies* These risks however attend any course of action compatible with (a) maintainanee of Abdullah and (b) ohe principle that any agreement must be made direct witn him and him only.

Foreign Office, 18th August, 1932, 11,30 pan No, 108, Your telegrams Nos, 151 and 152 (of August 3th: relations between Transjordan and Hejaz-Nejd). 1, His Majesty's Government will study Ibn Baud's memorandum on receipt of text, but following are their preliminary views* 2 C They are not prepared to discuss either of Ihn Band’s alternative suggestions* 3o Following paragraph is for your own information. Deposition of Amir would he quite impracticable in view of general position in Transjordan and Palestine, while Ihn Baud’s second alternativee would involve a detailed discuss ion s into which His Majesty’s Government are not prepared to he drawn, of their position and respon sibilities in Transjordan* It would in any case he difficult for them (and indeed unnecessary even from the point of view of the Hejaz-Nejd Government) to attempt to define that position more closely than it has been defined already - see for instance paragraph 4 of my telegram No* (of June 30th)* Moreover vigorous action taken by His Majesty’s Government in connexion with suppression of Ddn Hifada’s revolt is sufficient evidence of their attitude* Prom the practical point of view there is no need to discuss the position further.4. In tho view of His Majesty’s Government the questions now raised hy the Hejas-Nejd Government, important though they are, are nevertheless side issued.,, Main object of His Majesty’s Government is to place Trans jordan^Hejaz-Nejd relations on a more satisfactory basis for the future. Discussion of the origin of the recent rebellion or of the responsibilities of His Majesty’s Government in Transjordan, is not likely to further this object® Most useful Btep towards improved relaticr m would be a direct settlement on the lines already reached by the Hejaz-Nejd with Iraq, as repeatedly urged by Ibn Saud himself. Last sentence of your telegram Ho. 152 suggests that His Majesty is still ready to accept King Feisa^s offer to use his influence with Abdullah in this direction and His Majesty’s Government remain strongly of the opinion that he would be well advised to inform King Feisal accordingly. This matter is, however, entirely one for Ibn Saud himself to decide. 5. It may be well to acquaint Hejaz-Nejd Government orally, or otherwise, with preliminary views set forth in paragraphs 2 and 4 above in order to forestall subsequent disappointment. Before deciding whether this should be done, however, I shall await your observations and those of High Commissioner for Transjordan. 6. In any case it will be desirable to avoid giving the impression that His Majesty's Government attach S r ^e importance to suggestions in the King's memor^d™. The less they are discussed the better, emphasis being laid on the desirability of a direct W iw Transjordan, as a necessary step towards improved, relations which King Feisal may possibly be able to further. rT _.

He has definitely ordered all forces to return to their homes. Those at Taif have begun to disperse. Those near the frontier have strict orders to return after completing task and not to Interfere with Transjordan. The King's object is to give the lie to the rumours current in foreign press and to show that he contemplates no action inconsistent witn his position of friendship with His Majesty's Government. He is doing his best to allay the excitement and when ordering Akhwan to disperse informed them of his action vis h vis His - Majesty's Government with a view to settlement. He has asked them to come to him at Riyadh about the middle of October to hear what he has done end what results he has achieved.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Your telegram No.99 and my telegram No.7 Saving* Yusuf Yasin sent me on August 5th 'private and secret' personal private memorandum addressed by The xving to His ivi&amp;jesty ’ s Government. My immediately follov/ing telegram gives very condensed summary of latter. Having ensured myself that Fuad was cognizant of these communications I had conversations with him and Yusuf Yasin last night. I drew attention to gravity of the alternatives suggested by His Majesty and to fa.ct that second alternative seemed to destroy previous proposal of Heja.z government repeated after incursion of Ibn Rifada, that settlement with Transjordan should be effected on lines similar to that with Iraq . . They admitted this and attributed change of policy to increasing proofs of Abdullah's guilt and to strong public opinion in this country. I pointed out what appeared to me to be a misconception of offer by The King of Iraq.. His intervention would naturally be useless if Ibn Saud's attitude were determined by desire to get Abdullah removed or by mistrust so profound that only a guaranteex 2 by His Majesty's Government would satisfy him. that His Majesty's Government had had in view in recommending its to better underst nnd Transjordnn, acceptmce was preliminary approach ending between rulers of this country pa.cific completion of complicated negotiations, or guarantee by King Feisal of ultimate agreement. any I discouraged expectation of immediate answer as you might wish to see full text of memorandum and possibly to consult me v/hen on leave. They seemed disappointed at these suggestions as The King is snortly going to Nejd and it is apparently not proposed to use Hejaz Minister in London as channel for any communicat/ion. h 'f—WW' -■'Tniirgw [ This Doenment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Gonemment, and shonld returned to the Foreign Office if not reqnlred lot official qse.; 4841 «om J Decypiier* Sir A, I^en (Jedaa).

King in his memorandum accuses Ah dull ah of every sort of intrigue since conquest of the Hejaz including attempts uQ p i &amp;uade tribes that his activities had hacking of His Majesty 1 s Government and Egypt and complicity in proceedings of ihn Bifada, Addahhagh brothers etc. He one 4oses copy of letter described in my telegram No. 202 uQ Aden, if His Majesty’s Government, having proof of Amir’s innocence will inform him thereof and if they can i.ix culpability elsewhere, King will be somewhat reassured cut he calls attention to poverty of Ibn Bifada as well as to assistance v/hich he received at the outset from Trans jordan and signs of organization v/hich he himself could not have planned. King does not blame Abdullah who is his enemy and with whom he has no covenant. Object of memorandum is to protest against Amir’s activities and to ask how the King may be reassured and may preserve friendship with His Majesty’s Government in regard to Trans Jordan 0 Speaking as a friend and without diplomatic frills he suggests in nis own interest and even greater interest of His Majesty’s ^ovemment that means cannot be found to avoid discord so longI i long as Abdullah remains in Transjordan and. that he should be replaced by a trustworthy person whether British, Arab, Transjordanian or other but in that case Kins would undertake to comply with the wishes of His Majesty's Government with regard to peace on frontier and to give all assistance to person chosen. Alternatively if His Majesty's Government maintain Abdullah, which is admittedly matter for their decision, King cannot place any trust in him or his promises, but will trust a guarantee by His Majesty's Government themselves of neutrality of Transjordan and non-interference in Heja^i affairs. In that case Amir should desist from his activities and foregathering. The King is not challenging Amir or asking His Majesty’s Government to do the impossible. His sole object is to safeguard his country and to avoid differences with His Majesty's Government. King appreciates the offer of King, but mediation of latter cannot ensure his desiuerata nor can the King of Iraq be guarantor for his brother. Now that he (Ibn Saud) has explained his ideas decision depends on attitude of His Majesty s Government, they see advantage in any course, let them pursue If they see advantage in acceptance of King Faisal s mediation they know best.n. ^87/5476/26). % !

NoSo 6 &amp; 7 Saving 0 (Beginning of i, R ,, 9 ) My telegram No136.., • I informed Minister for Foreign Affairs on July 23rd of views expressed in your telegram No. 91. I insisted as from myself on the absurdity of any other conclusion as tribunal would manifestly he inappropriate means of establishing responsibility of Ibn Rifada whom the King has talien measures to destroy or investigating responsi bility attributed by Hejaz Government to Amir and other high personages. Following were principal points which emerged in the remainder of this conversation and another on July 25th when Yusuf Yasin returned to the subject insistently with the obvious desire to press the question of responsibility of Amir for what he tenaciously regards as aggression by Transjordan;- (a) Yusuf Yo..sin kept on defending view that article 6 of Hadda Agreement was applicable. He v/anted to know what alternative method of investigation His Majesty’s Government could suggest. I insisted that article 6 was clearly inapplicable and inappropriate and that any question of investigation was the concern of His Majesty’s Government and Transjordian Government, the former of wnom had however undertaken to consider any evidence which Hejaz ..oHejaz Government might produce. Ke asked what sort of evidence would satisfy His Majesty’s Government. I replied that it was for Hejaz Government to produce what ever proof they had and must presumably have had before they made their accusations 0 (b) Yusuf Yasin asked whether His Majesty’s Govern ment were desirous of pursuing the Question of responsi bilities, I said it was Hejaz Government who had raised it and that they had had reply accompanied by offer mentioned above. I expressed personal view that excessive insistence on attribution of responsibility to Amir etc 0 might prejudice major political object of placing future relations between Hejaz Nejd and Transjordan on sound basis, (c) Yusuf Yasin asked on July 25th whether I could give him the views of His Majesty's Government in writing, I said my statement of them on July 23rd had been official and reminded him of preference which he had himself expressed early in the present series of conversations ±01 oral discussion of questions which might otherv/ise assume 'too fundamental' a form, (d) In order to demonstrate inappropriateness of tribunal under article 6 I asked v/hether if Amir or Transjordanian Government accused Ibn Baud of complicity in such an incident as Ibn Musaad's raid in 1930 Hejaz Government would consider accusation a suitable matter for investigation by tribunal under article 6 3 I explained that the question was purely hypothetical and that my own answer would be an emphatic negative 0 Yusuf Yasin evaded the question a He clung to the point Ghat although Amir could not be brought before such a triounal it ««*o. iij she l.i1q ce ehrix*fc g d. wiijii iTivp^i'i -.i i o u. v.a.u.i ±iivusi;igation ox all responsihili- tieSo Conversation oi July 25th was long and somewhat accrimonious and as we were concluding it Sheildi Yusux' Yasln received telegram from the King at which he hurst into laughter saying 'the King agrees with Sir A.

On July 26th Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs more than hinted in passing that the reason for insistence on question of responsibility was that they hoped to establish claim to compensation. You will remember that the right to do this v ' as reserved at early stage in correspondence, Fuad Hamza* returned on July 24th. and is doubtless advising the King but Yusuf Yasin is still Acting Minister ' or foreign Affairs.

JSDDA, July 5th, 1932 Sir With reference to my despatch No. 269 of June 29, I have the honour to record one more fact in connection with the measures taken hy the Hejazi Government to deal mth the Ihn Rifada affair, namely that they shipped further supplies to Wejh in the Khedivial Mail steamer which left here on June 22. I have not heen able to get fUll particulars hut I understand that the consignment consisted of eighty two cases of which about tv/elve probably contained rifles and the rest ammunition. 2. A rumour was circulated a day or two ago that the barge recently imported from Bahrain by the Hejazi Government, which was sent to Wejh on receipt of the first news about Ibn Rif&amp;da, had gone on a reel and been incapacitated* I believe this story to be quite unfounded, bo far as I know the barge duly reached Wejh.

A 16 ?! an t ' M ‘ English willi Feisnl ' f -UawisR two years ago is the same • . plan winch they are now taking with Ibn ivatada. When the English felt two years ago, that King Ibn Saoiicl was get- itang stronger they created for him Eei- sul AI llawish. In order, however, to con ceal tneir intrigue they complained against Al-Dawishs’ attempt at attacking their colony Iraq. In face of this com plaint Ibn Saoud sent an expeditionary force to bring Al-Dawish to book and considerable Arab blood was shed. The English, iii' the. meanwhile, sent troops and men of uar to Koweit to watch the situation. If Ibn Saoud had been defeat ed his country would have fallen prey in the hands of the English and if A1- Bawish was defeated the English would all the same have realised their object in weakening Ibn Saoud and plucking his feathers. But God decreed that King Ibn Saoud should defeat this heretic Al- Bawish, who, it was later established - had been supplied with money, arms and am munition by Mr. Club be wbo is known as the second Colonel Lawrence and by the Beduins as ‘Abu Ileneik.’ Air. CTubbe is a crafty and cunning Englishman who used to occupy the post of Inspector of Beserts in the Iraq Government. AVhen the English saw that King Ibn Saoud had defeated Al-Dawish they assisted the latter to escape and wanted to send him to another country. But King Ibn Saoud In a leading article entitled “British I olicy m Arabia ’ Al-Gihad says: There is no doubt that the revolt of ibn Kafada against Ibn Saoud’s Govern ment ns an event that arrests one’s atten tion and that makes Arab observers won der what its source and object can be. Any writer who wisites to deal with Ibn iiafada’s movement must, in order to know its exact objects, go back a few years. Britain’s position to-day is such that it makes her think carefully of her future. She will inevitably lose India. W e do not mean that she will lose India at once or after one or even ten years but she will undoubtedly lose India one day, however distant this day may be. And since it is a well-known fact that Britain always looks forward and works for the future as if she were to live for ever, British statesmen are now trying t6 End a new India’ to replace the present India. But where is this new India? This new India is the Arab Peninsula threatened that unless Al-Bawisli was to w Inch includes the whole of Syria, Iraq, be surrendered to him he would invade t ie principalities lying along the coast of Koweit. As a result of this threat Ai- cie 1 ersianGiilf,tne Y emen and the Tied- Bawish was surrendered and put in pri- ,]az. It is a rich and fertile Peninsula or son until be died. King Ibn Saoud also rather it is a continent or a world of its . insisted that Mr. CTubbe should be sent cun llie only obstacles, however, that away from Iraq, Eventually Mi. Club be Maud in fixe way .of the English swallow- inn file whole Arab Peninsula, after they rave extended their sovereignty over Aden, Iladramut, Aluscat, Al-Bahren, Koweit, Iraq and^ Palestine, are the northern part of Syria which is now under Trench Mandate, the Hedjaz and Nejd which come under the rule of King Ibn Saoud and Hie happy Yemen which is ruled by the Imam Ai-AIutawakil Ala Allah. “As regards the taking of Syria and the Lebanon from France British policy ] considers it wise to delay it for some time. For the torture, of the Syrians by France from time 'to time is bound was appointed to the post of Inspector of Deserts in Amman the capital of the country of the Emir Abdullah, son of ex- King Hussein, to play the same role on the Transjordan-Ixedjaz frontiers. “It will therefore be seen that it was Mr. CTubbe or the second Colonel Law rence who instigated the tribes encamp ing' on the Hedjaz-Transjordan frontiers to revolt against King Ibn Saoud and it was he who supplied Tbn Pa fad a with arms ‘aid ammunition. The object, how ever, of sending British troops to the Eedjaz-Transjordan frontiers is not to assist Ibn Saoud but to assist the rebels and also to stand with their fair-com- ime iu Lime is 001111(1 to «*mi aisu iu siciiiu wiwj. eep Syria in a state of weakness that plexioned faces and blue eyes before the makes her more ready to be swallowed troops of Ibh Saoud in cast Ibn Saoud 'then the time comes. And Britain can- wins’and wishes to occupy Akaba winch not fail to find some means by which to was originally a part ot the Hedjaz. snatch Syria from France at any time. Therefore, what remains for Britain to create her new India is to remove the Imam YYhia from the Yemen and to up root King' Ibn Saoud from the Hedjaz and Xejd. But suppose Britain is unable cl uproot these two men to-day. Will she stop? Ko Sire will continue to skirmish V/ith King Ibn Saoud at one time and wifh the Imam another. If she can defeat them she will attain her object and if not she will satisfy herself with weaken ing them until the day comes, even after half a century, when .she can get rid of them.Jfith the compliments of the Secretary of the Admiralty, The Under 1 Se3ifttary. of State, INDIA OFFICE# Admiralty Ref,Ho, h* Your Ref, Ho.
