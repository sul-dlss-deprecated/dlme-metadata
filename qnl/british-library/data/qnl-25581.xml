Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received December 9.) (No. 133.) ' ' Sir, Tehran, (November 4, 1915. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of a note which I have addressed to the Persian Government, in accordance with the instructions contained in your telegram No. 341 of the 29th ultimo, as to the responsibility which Persia would incur should she enter into any arrangement with Germany inimical to Great Britain. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. Enclosure in No. 1. Note communicated to Persian Government. Your Excellency, Tehran, October 30, 1915. IN my note of yesterday’s date I drew your Excellency’s attention to the dangerous position in wdiich His Majesty’s consular officers in various towns in Persia have been placed by the neglect of the Imperial Persian Government to afford them protection to which they are entitled as the representatives of a friendly Power. The presence in the capital of a considerable number of Germans, Austrians, and Turks, many of whom are soldiers, the introduction by the enemy legations of large quantities of arms and ammunition, the enlistment by those legations of numerous retainers, and other proceedings with which the Persian Government are perfectly well acquainted, and which I need not therefore recount, has produced in the mind of my Government the apprehension that even His Majesty’s Legation and those of the Allies are not safe from the possibility of attacks organised by Germans, with the Persian connivance, and I have, moreover, some reason to believe that some convention has been signed between Persia and Germany. In these circumstances I am to point out to the Imperial Persian Government that if it is a fact that Persia has entered into some agreement with Germany, the stipulations of which are inimical to Great Britain and her Allies, the responsibility for any consequences that may ensue from it will fall on Persia, while His Majesty’s Government will be free to take wffiatever action may be necessary to protect the lives and property of British representatives and subjects in Persia.

Since the 14th April last this office has been closed. On this date we, with the rest of the European Colony and the British and Russian Consuls, were obliged to leave for Hamadan, owing to the approach of the Turkish forces under Hussein Raof Bey, and the hostile attitude of the German Consul and his band of ruffians. These latter were quite out of control of the Persian Government Authorities, whose entire 'Military” force, with the Governor, was held up some 100 miles away, by the Kalhors, where they had gone to endeavour to collect taxes. On the night of the 13th April the Bank house was fired upon by some of the German band, who were driven off by our guards. Since, and for some time before our departure, the town has been really under the control of the Germans, who have maintained an armed force of several hundred men recruited from amongst the worst character of the District. The Persian gendarmes who have been stationed there for several months, with two Swedish officers, are also completely under our enemies* influence. They are freely employed in escorting German convoys ofof arms and ammunition from Kasr Shirine and on excellent authority we learn that it was they who lent a maxim gun to Herr Sehunemann when he came to Kangavar to oppose our return in August. On that occasion he, ochunemann, had some 400 men and 2 maxims opposed to our escort of 45 Persian and Russian Cossacks. We would like it to he understood that the better class of Persians in Kermanshah are not opposed to our return, hut they are thoroughly intimidated hy the hostile forces maintained against us. Until the Persian Government can he forced to take proper action to suppress the general German intrigues in the country, we do not think that the Branch is likely to he reopened.

I saw prime Minister this morning and asked him what I was to understand by request or rather con dition he had put before Russian Minister on Ounday that 1800000 should be paid down at once in respect of 'arrears of moratorium'. His Highness knew that such a payment was materially impossible and it looked as if he wanted not to proceed with the arrangement but hoped to get better terms elsewhere and I must tell him frankly what my Russian colleague had told him already viz: that local report said that the Government was negotiating with the German Minister* This he vehemently (?group omitted ?denied). He declared that money would not suffice to pay seven or eight months arrears of payment due in Government Departments, that it was absolutely necessary for Government to get it at once and that he knew for a fact that Bank could find the money. I said he was mis taken and he then made various suggestions essence of which was that the above-mentioned sum should be paid over within six weeks. I said that the two Governments were ready to give Persia financial assistance on the understandingunderstanding that the Persian G oveminent would take steps to stop the German - campaign here hut that nothing whatever had been clone to that end. G e iTiici i i ifii p orta oio n oi 1 a mi s co n t i nu e cl un ch e ck e d, Lrendainerie was as hostile as ever, proper supnort was not given to those Provincial Governors who tried to Cue ck Ge rman a gents , c o ndi t i on oi 8hira z wa s a, s had as ever, Persian officers who had been educated in Turkey had been presented to the Shah by hie Turkish Military Attach^ and were to be appointed to the new national force, Karguzar of Meshed was smuggling escapped Austrian prisoners of war to Teheran. Facts like these seem to snow a leaning towards our enemies. Kis Highness said Government load to proceed slowly as public opinion was strongly against us. I remarked that in that case we might at any moment see his friendly Cabinet replaced by a hostile one and any money we might have advanced, would be used against us. lie must have some kind of a guarantee that the Persian G overnment would keep its part of the bargain before we paid over the big sum he required; we wished to assist a strictly neutral Persia but not a hostile Persia. prime Minister's explanations of the facts I put before him were very lame and inadequate and his general attitude unsatisfactory.. His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz telegraphs to-day that Kawam agent recently arrived states that cabinet is at heart pro-German and that they are playing a doubledouble game. Soulot has the same conviction. It is significant also that appeals to me for monetary, assistance have become numerous. It looks as if the Cabinet were trying to get all the money out of us they can to line their pockets and resign on the familiar grounds that they have not received the support of the two Legations. This would of course suit the Germans perfectly well without any formal agreement being necessary and would allow the Government to disclaim responsibility.-I can hardly believe that this we£k and timorous prime Min ister would sign any agreement but if inducement is sufficient and pressure from pro-Geimans apparently enough to provide colourable excuse he would lend himself to some such combination as suggested above. Formal agreement might be concluded with new Cabinet and may be under negotiation now but I have not yet conflunation of suggestion. • In the circumstances I have instructed the Im perial Bank of Persia not to let the Persian Government draw any money for the present. Two squadrons of Russian troops are disembarking at pnzeli and Pus si an Minister believes more are com ing but has .no certain knowledge.

I am making eicret enquiries but while I have learnt nothing definite so far there are a variety of small indications that negotiations of seme sort are on foot. In view, then, of the possibility of a Persian A lliance with Germany I submit that His Majesty’s v Government should consider whether it is not precedent for us tod Russia to offer a defensive (?group omitted ?alliance) with Persia. Now that'we are within a fewfdays of taking Bagdad such an alliance, if concluded, woult not involve em ployment of any considerable number of troops,, pro bably indeed only sufficient to hunt down the Germans, etc., now in Persia, and vhich. Russia sterns disposed to send, might be enough for that purpose. But we should have to hold out very considerable financial induce ments, possibly cancellation of some or alj, Persia’s debts, and probably to guarantee Persia’s integrity.. On the other hand an ,investment • (group- unaccypncraole) would be most embarrassing. It (^roup-und^yphAannle ) a free road to Afghanistan, : and atnreat, .not very for midable perhaps, to our military operations in 280CTtS15dMesopotamia, to say nothing of coranercial loss. More-, over I am convinced that if the Govenment here entered the war against Os no financial inducements would keep Kavainand Soulet or even Bakhtiari faithful to us unless we sent them military support* I would therefore suggest we open negotiations for a defensive alliance. Discussions would at least delay conclusion of any agreement with Germany and give time for Russian troops to arrive. As reported already a few troops have already landed, and their appearance will naturally spur Germans to make every effort to get Persian Goemment committed to them before force is large enough to overawe the pro-Serman party. Essential thing is to gain time and I propose to i take an early opportunity to discuss the proposition I (-'8*wp undocypno^ahlc) rcquoat Minister for Foreign i 1 Affairs.

Exact figures are of course not to be obtained but my reports show that Germans in conp^ratively large numbers are constantly arriving and I think in all Persia there cannot be less than 60 Germans, 250 Austrians mostly prisoners of war escapted from Transcaspia and perhaps 50 Turks renegade Indians etc,, with [80,000 £b a’m rifles, 7 Dr.^8 machine guns bombs etc. Contemptible as this would be elsewhere in Persia with gendarmerie entirely and-police probably disaffected and with Yellow Press and all worst elements in enemy pay, it is formidable. Besides which money is being more lavishly spent than ever. . This spurt is probably due to fear that Bagdad, is about to fall into our hands which event would (?group omitted interrupt) their present relatively easy line of communication with Constantinople ana also to conjecture that arrival of Grand Duke in the Cau casus may imply more rigorous military meastnes in , - p i ? ■ ' ' p '■ ./-N % Persia.

I learn from completely reliable source following: German Legation at Teheran regard it as absolutely essential that a number of German officers should be sent to Persia. They seem to contemplate three separate armies to be organised for Khorassan, Azerbaijan and the Karun by German officers with machine guns. A Captain Klein and others are stated to be already in Teheran. Germans think Swedes must be left at head of gendarmerie which without Europeans to lead it could not be expected to fight well. I also understand that Mostaufi has expressed hope that the Germans will obtain 25 more Swedish offi cers. A member of German Legation has gone or is about to go to visit Vali of Pushti J(uh with a view to inducing him to begin operations immediately in Karun valley.

Would not Persian Government and K(awam) agree to Masud-us-Sultan, brother of Muwaqqar-ud-Dowleh, becoming Acting Governor of Bushire, just as K(awarn) is Acting Governor-General.

Besides this until his name was coupled with that of his brother as an arch enemy of Persia by Jamiiam some time in June or July Masud was posing as a democrat and was not on speaking terms with his brother and not very friendly to us. If we do make a suggestion to Kawam, I would personally prefer Muwaggar if he would come back though I do not desire to suggest him. Since we are in occupation of Bushire and can use it as a lever, I respect fully deprecate any hurried handing over of place until the Persian Govern ment makes serious start towards fulfilment of accepted conditions. After we have once handed over I venture to say Persian Government will become very lukewarm in removing Khans and punishing tribes and suppressing German emissaries in south.

By degrees some three hundred Turkish troops wearing Persian caps with German badges have been smuggled into Kermanshah, and also about seventy Baghdad German have arrived. German Consul wants to raise twenty thousand men to reinforce Turkish troops at Baghdad and continues to enlist men. Addressed to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, repeated to Cox.

Please refer to your telegram No. 936 S. of the 11th September. In the (opinion?) of the Medical Officer (Vice-Consul), Sistan Consulate, unless huts are constructed without delay they will not dry and the men will be safer if they remain in tents, mud wails being thrown up round each tent to shelter the occupants from the wind. Huts would dry, our chief mason says, if they were built of old bricks which had been sun dried, but not if new bricks are made. I do not think that a sufficient quantity of old bricks can be purchased here.Best solution of the problem would perhaps he to supply troops with additional tents of a larger size in which they could be made comfortable during the day or else let them sleep in their present tents and build a few mess rooms for them. Bor the men a grant of Rs. 3,000 would suffice to cover the cost. There is a possibility of hiring a house for use of officers, but in my opinion they should also have more tents. During the hot weather they have been using Consulate as a mess house, but this will not much longer be available. My opinion regarding second half of telegram No. 116 from the Officer Commanding is that as Germans travel extremely fast and camels often are useless in winter, horses are very necessary. I think that our force should be increased and particularly strengthened with mountain guns as I believe many Afghans will enlist on the side of Germans if latter approach Sistan. 219 Telegram P., No. 1951 B.

I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram, No. 1776 B., dated the 2nd September 1915, regarding the proclamation announcing the intention of the British Government to bombard and destroy the town of Dilwar. 2. I am to explain that in the Hague Convention dealing with bombard ment by naval forces it is laid down that “ unless military exigencies render it impossible, the commander of a naval attacking force will warn the authorities before com mencing the bombardment”. This admits of wide discretion in deciding whether any notice of a bombardment should be given, but since the Convention in question has not been acceded to by the Government of Persia its provisions are m no way leo-ally binding in the Persian Gulf on His Majesty’s Government. ° 3 In connection with the object which led you to authorise the issue of the proclamation you mention that it has always been the custom to warn villages on such occasions in order to give the women and children Dme to to et awav In this connection I am to remark that, although it may in t e pas have been the custom to give ample warning, under present circumstances it is considered that this is very undesirable since it allows the inhabitants to make all preparations to meet the attack and largely reduces the eftect which of reaching a place of safety. i • u tit 4 It will however, be observed that the proclamation which x aj i a /-in thp Qth August 1915 was not confined to a warning regard- Trevor published oq the 9th August ^ ^ operations iB f. ^“friutended to combine with it.

( of these £ 0 ur Khans, Rais Ali has been killed. He leaves infant son and age 1 rAi i„ h„t no brothers.

Of all Khans, Sheikh Hussein is most rabidly hostile. He has led or initiated most of the raids which have taken place, and on September 9th led attack (and retreat) of party of five or six hundred tribesmen. Be styles him self Commander-in-Chief of volunteers and fighter for Islamic faith.

In the interests of defence of Bushire for which I am responsible, I put forward following suggestions. Hostile tribesmen have indisputably suffered^ a shock by R ais Ali’s death and action of September 9th, and in my opinion the moment is propitious for concerted action by friendly Khans of Hayat Dawood Augali and Shahbankareh against Borasjun and Sheikh Hussein i they can only he stimulated to undertake it. Letters received from Bushire this mail showed that Shahbankareh is feeling burden of keeping troops in field against Borasjun while Augali^ is suffering from closing of (Shif ?) caravan route. Necessary pecuniary assist ance is being afforded in above connections hut they also press for loan of Mauser Magazine rifles and ammunition to enable them to hold ont and pray for document admitting their claim on our good offices in event of any attempt of Persian Government to oppress them. As regards rifles, my stock of captured Mausers has lately been practically exhausted in compliance with urgent requisitions irom elsewhere. But in event of fresh captures loan of some of those rifles to friendly Khans might be possible. As to document desired perhaps it may he possible to give them something of the sort. Could an assurance be given that in event of their success British will be given (reversion of ?) Borasjun in favour of Shahbankareh and of Sheikh Hussein in favour of Augali and that we shall use our best endeavours to further Haidar Khan’s interests in way indicated in telegram referred to.62 I am strongly impressed with importance ol settling hinterland question in such a way as will ensure tranquillity amongst tribes now actively hostile against Bushire and such a favourable opportunity as that which is now afforded is unlikely to recur. t Addressed Foreign; repeated Minister, Tehran, and Chief of General Staff and Bushire. 135 No. Cf. 822, dated Bushire, the 6th (received 13th) September 1915 (Confidential).

After compliments .— * * You see with your own eyes that Bushire has been lost and the guards there have been trampled under foot. I tell you clearly that the Muwaqqar- ud-Douleh, after having served the English for five years, has now been imprisoned by them. If we have any sense, we should understand what the Besident had said to Muwaqqar-ud-Douleh. “ Up to now that you were serving us, it was for the money that you were receiving from us. If you were a true servant, you would have served your own home.” It is true and a good point. How could the British not do harm to Muwaqqar-ud-Douleh when they know that he betrayed his own country ? It is evident that such persons cannot serve others also. Anyhow the reason for my prolixity is that to-day it is a religious war and all the people have become ready to-day everywhere with one voice and unanimously for a holy war in the path of God. The people will never take it in that your war is a civil war. I request that in any way you may deem fit vou may become ready to make peace or at least make a truce and join hands with your brethren in religion and put an end to the unclean existence of the malicious enemies of their religion. As to forces and help, you have of course heard that the Darya Begi is coming with 6,000 men from Shiraz. Nasir-Diwan with 5,000 men and His Excellency the Soulet-ud-Douleh with the rest of the people of Persia and followers of the Prophet, i.e., any man who has a sense of religion and belief will proceed to help the unfortunate people of Bushire, so that the English should not be able to arrest and deport 37 men of the unfortunate traders of Bushire in a dav, and drag the women behind them. Let the zealous man who hears and sees and does not abandon his life and property to defend women be spat upon. Sartip, by the holy ancestors, my heart burns for our honour and that is why I write so much. It is four years since I came to lars, and for he last two years I have been grappling with foreigners so that my honour i.e. Persian women, should not be taken captive by others.

After compliments.—The depressing incident at Bushire, which has inflamed e very ^Persian, incites me to write this short note after enquny after vour o-ood health to bring to your notice that to-day it is the imperative duty of every person to unite and he ready to repel the foreigners, and safeguard our religion and honour and prestige. Success in every object also depends on unify. To-day what will give us dignity and bring b ack our traditional honour L unity. The thing which will cause our rum and the loss of our honour and country is internal dissension. ^ Prom the beginning of the conflict between Sarkar Ismail Khan Sartip nnd Agha Khan, I have been writing letters in the cause of peace, and sent sowars and donee very thing in my power in the hope that it ^ that this conflict would be changed into a reconciliation, So far there has been no result. It can be said that a great many of the proceedings of the English have been taken in consideration of this quarrel. If there be assistance, if there be unity, it is always possible to attain to great honour. It is unnecessary fox me to state and you know for certain that every kingdom which has been destroved, every tribe which has become extinct, every force which met with defeat and every honour lost has been through dissention. On the contrary, every tribe and elan which has prospered, all honour and dignity which has been obtained all wealth and virtue gained has been through concord. I have given you great trouble and you should excuse me. Therefore you should know that it is necessary, even imperative, whenever a dissension arises, to remove it by all the means at your command. At this juncture when our country, honour and prestige is bidding farewell to us, we should leave alone internal dissensions and safeguard our religion and honour. His Excellency the Darya Begi has left for these parts with a force of 6 000 men. Nasir-Diwan will also be coming with a very large number. To-day a telegram has been received stating that a large number of Mujahidin (volunteers) will be leaving Shiraz under His Keverence Agha Shaikh Jafar. You should also ignore the talk of ignorant people, which are like the winds of the air, and pay no attention to them and come forward gallantly with a sense of enthusiasm and patriotism and do credit to the land of your Government and strive to remove this internal dissension, and let us all to gether remove this dark horizon, which has come upon us. However much I could say on the subject, yet I am unwilling to state more than this, but as I have already troubled you much, I will only say that I trust that you will obtain this honour of stopping this internal dissension and bring about unity and alliance. Sub-enclosure No. 6. Dated night of 6th Shawwal 1333 (18th August 1915). From— Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh of Borasjun, To —Ismail Khan of Shabankareh. Being prompted by a sense of devotion to Islam, I write this note to you, apd state that if you think it advisable, you may stop this fighting and turmoil for the time being, and proceed to take action according to the statemepti€6 which you had made to Shaikh Murteza after the incident of M. Wassmuss, saying that you would join us at any time and juncture when it were necessary in making jehad against the unbelievers. That time has now arrived, and you see with your own eyes, and hear that what they are doing with our brethren at Bushire and with Bushire itself, which was our home, the seat of our business and the means of our respectability. The result of this civil war will he ultimately this that, after expending our wealth and the forces which we possess, the foreigners will come in without any obstacle and prevention, take (our districts), carry off (our belongings) and devour them up, while you are still thinking of taking possession of Hupulu. This Hupulu, I promise, will not run away, and if we warded off the foreigners, and knew that Hupulu still belonged to us and beyond the reach of foreigners, we will then start the game anew. If, however, foreigners did succeed and occupied Hupulu, &amp;c., then the fighting (between us) will be But the benefit for us will be this that the men, whom we are killing over. now ourselves, wall be martyrs in the cause of religion, and this money and ammunition, which we use in destroying our country, will be spent by us in safeguarding our home and honour, and in checking the foreigners. Then we will be recompensed by God and His Apostle, and honoured and respected by our compatriots and by our dear country. It would be indeed a great benefit that one may have the hope of gaining the benefit in this and in the other world. In reality these evil actions of ours are a very great misfortune, which mean loss in this and in the other world. If you think that I am going to deceive you by this means, and take the place which you hold, you can give the place to Zaigham-Diwan (Agha Khan) or to the Gendarmes of the Government, so that after having warded off foreigners, if you wish to conduct yourself as you are doing at present, it may be restored to you and you can then proceed with this business. If you think fit, however, to change your policy, you may har d it over to Zaigham-Diwan (Agha Khan) of your own free will. If you imagine that by this means I am going to make your friends displeased with you, in the first place these are not your^friends, because an enemy will never become a friend. These are the old enemies of yours and your family in fact the enemies of the Shabankareh districts; and as they could not succeed while they were enemies, they are now so, although in the guise of friends. (Reference is to Haidar Khan and his family.) You should now examine carefully the consequences of my object. My object briefly is this that you should continue to be as it were a father and Zaigham-Diwan as a son. You should not covet his home, nor should he make aggression on your district. The assistance I have given him is for the protec tion of his life, lest the Hayat Daoudi Lurs might get the upperhand and put him to death, and some blood feud arise among the Khans of Shabankareh, when there would be this disgrace for my family and yours that the Hayafc Dauodi Lurs would boast “ we went to intercede between the Khans or Boras- jun, Shabankareh and Zirah, killed a Khan of the latter place, took his distrie and returned While, on the other hand, the object of Haidar Khan in short is to make vou the shield for his own afflictions, and to cast blood feud between the race o£ the Shabankareh Khans and tribesmen, and then sit on and look. Because he knows well that as long as there be a single Persian in Persia, he will look upon Haidar Khan as an enemy. He is being hated b ?y® . G “T' ern “®“ t . tt a ”, d nation on account of the treason and dishonourable act which he committed, and this is very had : such a person is liable to danger and destruction at any The feelings of a great nation cannot be without effect in regard to a single nerTon These people will never forget the great misfortune and Ws they suffered at the hands of the Khans and tribesmen of _ Shabankareh when they were at enmity with the latter. You sent this same Zaigham-Diwan when tney were ai e J Mainun by the firing of rifles, and brought such you know better yourself. Of course they are longing to-day to take tUeir©7 i,o^ e ^fliffham-Diwan, after such enmity which revenge to-day at your own h . &amp; acc0 rding to the latter’s ideas, ought be Showed to Haidar Khan and his father accor according to your to be killed, looted and expell d But it skouM ^ &amp; man whQ has incurred ,o. service, - cr,,i.

I am ready and give a 1 word of honour to get the brave men abovementioned to obey you, instead nf tu a traitor Haidar Khan, and I myself to he one of them, on condition that you should leave this deceitful man and not listen to his claim, as he wishes to make you like himself. How disgraceful it would be that you should become known as traitor in this old age of yours? Tiie dishonour and honour of Borasjun and Shabankareh have been one from olden times. I be D you not to bring disgrace upon our honours. # Tin to now your relations with Haidar Khan and the English have been behind the screen of secrecy, but to-day it is coming to light, and as soon as this becomes known, all the papers will be filled with words ot damnation and abuse Then death will be better for us than life. For the sake ot God, do not assent to the disgrace of the families of Borasjun and Shabankareh. Stop this civil war and turmoil and prepare yourself for martyrdom at this end 01 life like Habib bin Mudhahir (a man who fought for the 3rd Imam), so that 1 may follow in your footstep like Habib bin Abdullah. Do not deprive yourseii and me of this martyrdom, as I ask you in the name of the Guardian of the Age, may God hasten his advent. I do not trouble you any more and wait to receive a satisfactory answer, so that if you accept my proposals you make arrangements for reconciliation or truce, whichever you may wish. If iu spite of all these details you turn your hack on your religion and relatives and follow the opinion of foreigners and their worshippers, curses on you for so dishonourable an act. If so, I trust that you will never meet with success and regret, although I am certain that you will read my representations carefully and agree with me, ^ thereby cause the spirit of the Holy Law and the motherland to be pleased with yourself.

I thank you sincerely for your enthusiastic action. The forces at Kazerun and environs are being got ready and they are coming party after party from the villages and neighbourhood, and they are engaged in making preparations to start. The Zargham Ashair’s [Muhammad Ali Khan Kashkuli (?)J mes senger has arrived at Dashtarjin, and is gathering troops: he will arrive here on the 10th. The forces of Mamasani with the guns and materials, which they have, are on the point of departure. The agitation at Kazerun is getting more Ckand more serious every moment: the mothers are putting shrouds round the necks of their children. The telegraphic representations from Kazerun have had Speedy effects in Shiraz and Tehran, and all Persia is agitated. Even the school hoys in Shiraz and the Saiyids, Ulama and all the people have removed to outside the town with the intention of joining that victorious force A series of telegrams has been received one after the other from high quarters in support of the forces of Islam and congratulating those of Kazerun. Eor your information I beg to quote three copies thereof. “To the General of Islam, Agbai Nasir-Diwan, Kazerun. 'Tour zealous measures have stirred up the nation of Pars.

Minute on our relations w.th Haidar of Hayat Daoui ^ Haidar Khan first came int ° ol ° 3 ®‘d^biTpersonal risk he arrested two - “ *• s a “ d nwalbeseTnfrom the telegams^No^ ^^^elpmssefthefr S 212 ol April 10 th, 1908, tha connection, and he was so XS! 0 He th^eS be has taken his action in order to render us!| l,: . ! .. s ; service, and that he hoped that he could count on our good offices in case he should need them in the future. In 1909, after the revolution of Saiyid Murteza Ahrami against the Persian Government and the seizure of Bushire by the Tangistam tribesmen, which rendered necessary the landing of a considerable naval force from H.M.S. “Pox”, Haidar Khan rendered great service to all at Bushire by sending a force of 400 riflemen to guard the island for a month. At the end of 1909, and again in 1910 and 1911, Haidar Khan and his relatives and the districts under their rule were visited by His Majesty s Vice- Consul. Most cordial relations ensued; many small matters were settled with the Residency to mutual satisfaction : and constant and intimate corre spondence has been maintained from then onwards. Haidar Khan early made it clear that he despaired of the Persian Govern ment being able to restore order in Southern Persia, and to support those few Chiefs like himself who kept their districts in hand, and therefore, being the ruler of purely maritime districts himself, he looked to the British Govern ment authorities, as those most interested, to give him their support in all his difficulties with the Central Government and Bakhtiari greed, and to treat him as they treated the Shaikh of Mohammerah. On his part he showed himself prepared to meet our wishes in every respect, and to consult us regarding all his actions. In 1910 and 1911 he did all he could to give British merchants a pre ference in the purchase of grain in his district as against the Germans, and this assistance was very valuable. In 1913 and 1914 he invoked British assistance for the protection of his district of Lirawi against Bakhtiari rapacity : and both the Resident and His Majesty’s Legation recognising the importance of the issue gave him their utmost and effective help. In 1913 Haidar Khan again co-operated in the British operations against the Tangistan coast by allowing the island of Kharg, which is his fief, to be used for beaching captured Tangistani dhows, and by giving hospitality and assistance to the British troops sent there. Por this, by their No. 2762 E.-A of December 16th, 1913, he was informed of the appreciation of the Govern ment of India. On the outbreak of the European war in 1914 he hastened to express his hopes for British victory, in the face of general pro-German sentiment in Persia, and he has continued to promote the British cause, and circulate British news in his districts. He has in fact from the first been considered by Southern Persia as the strongest British partisan after Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan of Mohammerah. On March 4th 1915 Sir Percy Cox telegraphed from Basrah to Haidar Khan asking him to arrest Wassmuss and his German companion, assuring him that “ our appreciation would be even greater than for the capture of the Humaidi pirates ”, that Haidar Khan need fear nothing from the Persian Government as a result, and accepting personal responsibility for the arrest. Haidar Khan complied without the slightest hesitation, and, though through no fault of his Wassmuss subsequently escaped, important documents revealing German plans fell into our hands. Although universally blamed and violently abused outside his own districts for his action, and in considerable danger of attack from the pro-German Khans, Haidar Khan as can be seen from the translation of more than 30 letters which he has written to the Residency since, he has only striven the harder to support British interests. He gives us sound advice, and has negotiated and is negotiating with neighbouring Khans, thus making a solid pro-British faction which we hope will keep the hostile Khans in check. When asked by Sir Percy Cox to send a force from Lirawi to the assistance of the Shaikh of Mohammerah’s representative in Southern Arabistan, he at once got a force ready, though it was then too late.70 Haidar Khan has in fact been a valuable ally for several vears nast ,r, f l now reahsing that absolute Persian neutrality is impossible under the'local conditions, he has definitely thrown in his lot with us P and is playing a most toour suppOTt P ° rtant Pait m Steadying the situation ^ the Bushire hinterland There is no one in Seuthern Persia, apart from the Shaikh of Moham- merah and Hap Pais, to whom we shall have more cause to be grateful at the end of the war, than to Haidar Khan. giatemi at tiie II. * aida f ^ hai1 of Ha y at Daoud is about 45 y ea rs of age, and has been head Augusmth imTT 18 H p pedig ' ee given in letter No. 1786 of August 11th, 1912, from Sir Percy Cox to Foreign Department. map^Theyare—° ntr0lled ^ him ^ sh ° Wn in the accompanying sketch Hayat Daoud (chief village and port Bandar Pig).

It will be seen that they extend from the southern to the outskirts of Bnshire itself, a distance of some 80 the ground between the coast range and the sea, with tbe ex'ception of the bhabankareh district, which is m alliance with Haidar Khan. The districts represent therefore a solid block of the coast plain between Arabistan and Bushire, under one family control, and as a link with British interests m Arabistan their support of and from the British is visibly of great •/ * borders of Arabistan miles, and cover all Our intere^sts in the Persian coasta! region, particularly in the northern part oi the Crnlt, lie m the maintenance of order by and security of tenure of the local magnates, who are well disposed towards His Majesty’s Government. In the event of war, or of the disintegration of Persia, it would be the onlv logical sequence of the autonomy of Arabistan and British possession of Bushire to encourage the greatest territorial magnate of the intervening region and our staunch friend, Haidar Khan, to keep the region under his influence* in order and quiet, and as well disposed towards ourselves as possible. The position and value of Haidar Khan may not be fully understood. He and his relatives from Lirawi to Pudhilleh and Angali could muster some 2,500 armed men probably, and with his friend of Shabankareh more than 3,000. There is little probability of his being so scattered and driven in on Bandar Pig by the hostile Khans, who are numerically less strong and bound together with flimsy tie of friendship, that Haidar Khan wouldl»e forced to fly from his district. Long before Bandar Pig, which is a good many miles from the frontier of his districts, were attacked Haidar Khan’s forces would be fighting hard against any invasion of their borders; and we hope with considerable success. He himself has never taken so desperate a view of the situation : and in point of fact his correspondence has been directed just as much as to how far he could help the British in Bushire, if attacked, as it has been to ask for co operation if fighting to place on his borders in the immediate vicinity of Bushire and for the moral effect of a man-of-war cruising off his coast. The point is that his enemies locally are onr enemies, and vice versa, namely, the Khans on and to the south of the Shiraz road. Both the British authorities at Bushire and Haidar Khan are agreed that all hostility in the Bushire hinterland, and danger to Bushire could be crushed easily and speedily71 • ““‘csrss ZZX5S. ^ 5 ; »d putting 1 .

In continuation of my letter No. Cf. 262, dated 12th July 1915, I have the honour to forward, for Your Excellency’s information, a translation of a letter which has been written to me by Shaikh Hussain of Chahkutah, a Chieftain who resides some 24 miles from Bushire and has distinguished himself by the violence of his hostility and attacks against the British Residency in reply to a letter from me advising him of the confiscation of 10 000 Tumans which he had in deposit with a Persian merchant the “ Rais-ut- Tuiiar ” here to meet the claims of Messrs. Gray Paul and Co., the Imperia Bank of Persia, Messrs. Dixon and Co., and others, whose country-houses have been attacked and raided by his men during the past few weeks. I may mention that His Excellency Muwaqqar-ud-Douieh, late Governor of the Gulf Ports, had already attached this amount and told me where it was. I enclose the original of this threatening letter in the hope that by its production to the Persian Government Your Excellency may be able to convince them of the urgent necessity for the expulsion and dispossession of Shaikh Hussain. This man and his sons are our nearest neighbours among the Khans of the littoral, had for years been given the good offices of the Consulate- General in their frequent difficulties, and on many occasions enjoyed the hospitality of His Majesty’s officers here. He alone of our former friends among the Khans has proved treacherous and espoused the cause of the Germans. He unfortunately escaped a fortnight ago after an attack which he had made against the British Residency at Subzabad outside Bushire, when a certain number of his men were ‘surrounded in a ravine and engaged in a fusillade with our troops all day.So long as Shaikh Hussain remains ruler of Chahkutah and Ahmadi it will be impossible for the British in Bushire to feel any security in future, and I trust that the day is not far distant when the Persian Government by their own forces, or through the medium of our own, will effect his suppres sion. Sub-enclosure. * ' Translation. Dated 9th Shawwal 13L3 (21st August 1915), From— Shaikh Hussain, Chahkutai, Chahkutah, To— Major A. P. Trevor, C.I.E., Bushire. I have received your letter of the 4th Shawwal. You have again threat ened me with the confiscation of Tumans 10,000. Firstly, in accordance with a legal document it is due to my son, Shaikh Muhammad Khan, by Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar. If a single man of the Dumukh elan be left alive, he will recover it from Haji Rais-ut-Tujjar. You have acquired ascendency to-day over Bashire through the dishonour of the traitor Muwaqqar-ud-Douleh and are ruling by usurpation over the wretched people of Bushire ; you are in a position to seize all the belongings of Haji Rais-ut- Tujjar and others. In these circumstances, it does not affect my claim which will be assuredly recovered by me, whether to-day or in another 10 years* time. That is to say, by the grace of God, no one has the power to swindle me. In this connection I have sent you a reply by telegraph through the British Consul at Shiraz. As regards the attack by the volunteers on your troops of aggression to which you have made a reference, in the first place, personally I have not been on hostile terms with the British Government. Your barbarous actions and the torture, detention and deportation of innocent people of Bushire and your insult to our sacred country, the home of our ancestors, have compelled me to oppose, and fight with you, and life has hereby been rendered unhappy for myself, my family and my friends. Up to now we have not made any attack which may be worth notice in support of the cause of Islam. The false British civilisation has become plain to all nations of the world and their cruel and oppressive aggression on our country and territories have been made by the authorities of the illustrious Government. . Eie on the civilised Government of Great Britain and on the founders of learning and justice in the world! Your lies and fraud have become known to the world and the people have awakened. Your barbarous steps against a few helpless and workless traders of Bushire are of no importance: they have only proved the barbarous nature of your actions, such as are never committed by the barbarous people of Africa. All the Muhammadans of the world, even all the nations of the world have become disgusted with yom If God ^ wills, and by the grace and power of God, I will settle the affairs of Bushire in a space of two days, and will cause you to understand that such small attacks, as have been here are not made by us and that only a few young and inexperienced men have been making raids by night, and have killed 150 men and a Major. Up to now the volunteers have made no attack of any importance. You are of course well aware how at Dilwar our volunteers attacked your invading forces, and in 2 days killed 550 soldiers and some of your great officers. If you desire a trial of strength with us, you should bring your bravest and most warlike European soldiers against us, so that our bravery and piowess may become clear to you. In accordance with the honoured verse which God saith in his book “and strive in the path of God by their (your) property and lives ”, on whichever side any one be killed, it is a gain for Islam. We regard this war as the greatest bliss: if we be killed, we shall be in paradise: and if we kill, we shall have paradise, and be an object of God’s favours.73 As to one of my sons who you say is wounded, it is sheer falsehood, and totally a lie. In the first place none of my sons have become ready for jehad: only my dear son, Shaikh Nasir Khan, who is my third son, and who is, thank God, up to now safe and sound, is quite ready to attack the enemy. If you do not believe it, I give you assurance to come and see him. This 17-year old boy has renounced life, and has prepared himself to make all sorts of sacrifices towards avenging his brethren in religion and restoring his holy country. But I do not believe that, however much you may be attacked by the volunteers of Islam, the latter will get a single wound at the hands of this band of English and Indian labourers and coolies that have been brought here by you. By the blessings of the Proof the 12th Imam) peace be on him, I will take your life in return for the unfortunate people of Bushire. There is no other matter. 137 Telegram, No. 1943 B,, dated the 14th September 1915. From—The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Z.

General Staff in Berlin insist that before loan can be arranged there must be a Persian Army capable of tak ing the field as at present Persian army has only suf ficient ammunition for two days at most* Germans appear to realize that Persians are not en tirely on their side and they cannot depend on Swedish gendarmerie because latter have sworn allegiance to the Shah and to surprise of the Germans, gendarmerie may keep their allegiance because they are all young.

Mr, Marling to Sii' Edward Grey.—(Received September 28.) (No. 111.) Sir, Tehran, September 1, 1915. MUCH as it has been talked of, the definite resignation of Ain-ed-Dowleh’s Cabinet on the 9th July came as a slight surprise to most people, as he had been apparently making a stronger stand against the Democratic attacks on Farman Farina for two or three days previously, Nor am I quite certain even now, a month g.ftey the event, exactly what his reasons were, but the general opinion is that his Highness, being one of those who do not believe in the existence of two kings in Brentford, hoped that by sacrificing Farman Farma he would be brought back to office by the grateful Democrat. During his short tenure of office Ain-ed-Dowleh seems to have endeavoured to do what Hussein Hilmi Pasha and other Grand Viziers failed to do with the Committee of Union and Progress in Turkey, i.e., bend the Democrats to his will; but, like the Turkish statesmen, he eventually discovered that if he was to retain office it must be as servant, not as master. All the time he was professing to the Russian Minister and myself his earnest desire to serve our iiyterests, which he always admitted were ideutical with those of Persia, but always failed—out of fear of offending the pro-German Democrats—to give practical effect to his professions until just before the fall of his Cabinet, when he permitted the arrest of an obscure German agent proceeding to Meshed. M. de Etter and 1 called on his Highness on the morning after his resignation and give him to understand that if he wished to resume office without Farman Farma he could no longer count on the financial support which the two Powers were ready to afford him. Farman Farma had been attacked because, in virtue of his office, he had been the instrument of such mild measures as the Cabinet had taken to check German intrigues, and if his Highness now sacrificed him to Democrats— i.e., German clamour —our Government could only regard it as a German victory and Ain-ed-Dowleh as an instrument in the hands of the pro-German party. Having demolished Ain-ed-Dowleh’s Cabinet, the Democrats had to find a substitute. I need not weary you with the list of their futile efforts, but it will be enough to say that at his second attempt Mustofi-ul-Mamalek succeeded on the 19th August in presenting to the Medjliss as heterogeneous a Ministry as ever sat at the same Council table. Mustofi himself represents the Democrats—not that he is one at heart, but because he cherishes the fantastic belief that if Russia would consent to remove her troops from Kasyin and elsewhere in Persia, public opinion would pass from bitter hatred to warm affection for the northern neighbour. He can therefore be trusted to keep open the sore between Persia and Russia. Vossugh-ed-Dowleh and Sipahdar, on the other hand, are considered to be nothing but Russian agents, while Ala-es-Sultaneh represents Great Britain, and the presence of these three is to secure our tolerance, if not our support, of the combination. With Muin-el-A ezareh as his “chef de cabinet,” Motesham-es-Sultaneh can be trusted not to compromise the Government with us, while Assadullah Khan seems to have been thrown in to streegthen the “ English ” element in virtue solely of his knowledge of the language. The others scarcely count. The Russian Minister and I have, of course, been accused of having prolonged the crisis, but the accusation is unjust, for the simple and obvious reason that our interests would have been better suited by the installation of any Cabinet except a frankly democratic and pro-German one, and that, as events showed, the Democrats coiud not aphieve. On two occasions we made endeavours to induce the Shah to use his influence and terminate the crisis, but His Majesty was too much under the influence of his German-paid entourage—it is alleged that he himself has not been a stranger to inducements of this character— to listen, and I have some reason to think that His Majesty’s eyes were only opened to the “ German peril” by the insolent behaviour of the German consul at Kermanshah (see my despatch No. 110). Meantime we have succeeded, thanks to the influence of the better-informed press, in creating a body of opinion among the more educated and substantial classes strongly opposed to the 6] ^ ' \ [2474 ee- Copy to India 5 NOV 1915fatuous tolerance which the Persian Government has up till now exhibited to the Unfortunately, however, during the seven weeks m uhich the country , ithout a Government the enemy has had a free hand and has made the most of it. The German chief centre is at Ispahan. It is there that the large quantities of rifles and' ammunition, machine guns, &amp;c„ and money, &amp;c„ smuggled m somewhere in the vicinity of Kermanshah are stored, and it is thence that the numerous par ies of emissaries start on their missions. It is difficult to say what the exact number of Germans in the country now is, as fresh agents appear to be constantly coming via Kermanshali, and there is every reason to believe that they are in some cases disguised as Arabs ; and it is probable that Baron Oppenheim is already m 1 ersia, although so far there has been no mention of the name m the reports I receive. L he few Indians in German service also appear to come by this route, and 1 have evidence, which I have sent on to the Government of India, that among them are soldiers tahen prisoners in France The Austrians are, so far, escaped prisoners of war from the iranscaspian provinces of Russia. There seems to be at least 200, and among them a few officers, but of late the supplj' of men from this quarter seems to have been nearly The Germans have had two main objectives, ie., to reach Afghanistan and to rouse the tribes south of Shiraz to attack us at Bushire, and in both, thanks to the criminally passive attitude of the Persian Government, they have succeeded. I must admit that the anxiety as to Afghanistan exhibited by the Government of India in their telegram No. 044* of the 8th July came as a distinct surprise. I had received from them two telegrams which informed me that the Ameer had given pledges of loyalty that were deemed satisfactory. I did not read in these messages anything more than that it was believed that the Ameer himself could be relied on to do his best to maintain peace. But what did largely mislead me as to what it now appears was the real view of the Government of India was the series of telegrams ending with No. 5195 of the 29th May, discussing what the consequences to us would be and what action we should take should Persia be dragged into the war against us. In those messages there is scarcely a bare allusion to Afghanistan, and it appeared to me incredible that such an omission could have occurred had any misgiving existed in the minds of its authors on so capital a point. My long service in Constantinople had of course taught me that the Pan-Islamic missions sent thence to Afghanistan for a considerable number of years past were always watched with something more than interest in Calcutta, and I came to the conclusion that just as the apprehensions felt in India as to the undesirable effect which an unfriendly policy towards Turkey might have on the Indian Moslem opinion had been shown by the test of war to he groundless, so, as regards Afghanistan, the Government of India had reason to be convinced that Turco-German intrigues in Afghanistan would fall on barren ground. The Russian Minister also had told me more than once that just before he left London he was assured that no uneasiness w r as entertained by His Majesty’s Government on the score of Afghanistan. I do not say that even with a full knowledge of the true state of affairs we could have materially altered the course of events. On looking back it seems to me clear enough that at the time nothing but the despatch of Russian troops would have put sufficient heart into the Persian Government to take really effective measures to stop the German bands, and the troops, as we know, were not forthcoming. But to revert to the Germans. As before remarked, they made the fullest use of the abeyance of responsible authority in Persia. Parties aggregating something like 400 men in all were despatched to Afghanistan, agents were sent to Kerman, Wasmuss redoubled his pernicious activities in Dashti and Tangistan, and large quantities of arms, &amp;c.—one convoy that reached Ispahan towards the end of July comprised over 200 mule-loads were poured in via Kermanshah. The sequel of these activities in the east and south are so well known to you, Sir, through the channel of the India Office that I need not even summarise them; but it is fitting that I should report that the Bakhtiari Governor of Kerman, after a moment of weakness which gave the German agents Zugmeyer and Friesinger a footing in the town itself, showed a vigour which is in pleasing contrast with the passivity of' almost all his colleagues. For the first three weeks or so after Ain-ed-Dowleh’s resignation it was impossible to get any instructions sent by the permanent officials in any Department to local Governors to take action against the German agents, ami I had to rely on appeals to our ancient friendship with individual Governors even to prevent them from giving passive tolerance to the Germans. My appeals were reinforced by other inducements, huteven so they had very partial success, for the Germans could always rely on the gendarmerie wherever it existed, and, moreover, usually had the karguzar and other local officials in their pay. The position of a local Governor was thus difficult. He was, like everyone else, much impressed by the reports assiduously spread by the ^ 'ermans of crushing defeats to Russia, and he felt that to oppose the Germans was to run counter to the artificially raised sentiments of the populace, and he hesitated to risk an encounter without the most explicit orders from the Government. By the beginning of August, however, a slight change for the better took place. The appearance of the Cossacks in Kain and Seistan, and the advance of our own column from Baluchistan, and a little later the occupation of Bushire, woke Persia up to the imminent danger into which party struggles had led her, and it was then possible (by the help of proper inducements) to get instructions sent through Suleiman Khan, the ultra-Democratic Secretary-General of the Minister of Interior, to Seistan, Kerman, and Ispahan, and occasionally warnings to Shiraz. Even so, these instructions were often scarcely better than the traditional order “to maintain neutrality,” r.e., do nothing, and when a more categorical message was sent it was not infrequently cancelled by a subsequent secret telegram. „ . n „ I do not however, believe that this partial change of attitude was due to any tear of future chastisement on the part of the two Powers. The impression created by the Russian retreat in Poland was too deep, and it was rather from the consciousness that German intrigues had been allowed to go too far, and from fear that unless checked at once Persia would relapse into anarchy. The same apprehension forced even the Democrats to recognise that a Government of some kind must be formed, and as they recognised that a purely Democrat Ministry, even if accepted by the Medjliss could nofstand for a week, they left Mustofi a free hand to get support where he could. Mustofi-ul-Mamalek means well, and he is reputed, and I believe rightly, to be absolutely clean-handed, but while he is aware of the dangerous position to which his friends have brought the country, he is also appalled by the difficulty of surmounting it. His proper course would be to assemble a reliable force composed oi the Eossac v Brigade and Bakhtiari sowars to Tehran and then close the Medjliss and suppiess t e pro-German press. But he hesitates to incur the wrath of his quondam friemffi the Democrats by employing what are regarded as being respectively Russian and Bntis forces and still more to be frank with the Russian Minister and myself and work honestly with us in interests which are, as he admits, more Persian than foreign. Instead of that he is trying to “squeeze” us in order to be able to conciliate the Democrats and their kind by showing that he has wrung concessions from us. buck a policy which is entirely to the taste of so weak a character as Persia s present P™e Minister, can only fail,' and our present endeavour is to get what we can out ot the Cabinet before it falls.

COAPIDENTIAL T 4 '' A5 [September 28. J Section 1. [140219] .i. (No Sir, 110 .) No Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 28.) Tehran, August 30, 1915. I HAVE the honour to inform you that the Persian gendarmerie, under the personal command of Swedish officers, have recently sustained two not inconsiderable defeats at the hands of the tribesmen. In the first instance a branch of the Shahseven tribe attacked a column of gendarmes under Captain Hierta on the Kazvin-Hamadan road, and during the engagement Captain Hierta was killed. This is the fourth Swedish officer who has lost his life since the formation of the gendarmerie under Swedish control. Detailed reports of this encounter are not as yet available, but it seems clear that the gendarmerie suffered considerable loss and that a native officer with some 200 men and two guns deserted to the attacking tribesmen. A punitive expedition was despatched from Tehran, and the officer in command here informs me that steps are being taken to restore order and to bring the offenders to justice. Such information as is available in regard to the second instance would point to its having been of a much graver nature than the above-mentioned fight. For some time past the Governor-General of Luristan had ceased to exercise any control over the turbulent tribesmen in his province and has been unable to collect the taxes for several years, and the efforts of the young Swedish officer in command at Burujird resulted a few days ago in the complete defeat of his force of 800 gendarmes with the loss of some 200 men and four guns and the whole of the Governor- General’s baggage, tents, &amp;c. Captain de Mare, the officer in question, and Nizam-ul- Sultaneh barely escaped with their lives. These defeats have somewhat shaken the prestige of the gendarmerie and would seem to prove that the Swedes, apart from their open pro-German propaganda, are quite incapable of fulfilling their more obvious duties of safeguarding the peace of the roads. Colonel Ed wall, the chief officer commanding, somewhat naively admitted m a letter to a member of my staff that “ pour le moment 800 gendarmes sont disparus et je n’en sais rien de leur avenir, mais j’espere en retrouver la plus part (sic). Colonel Ed wall even went so far as to put forward this tragic disappearance of his gendarmes as an excuse for not complying with the orders of the Persian Government to furnish an escort for the British and Russian consuls to Kermanshah. 1 have already reported to you by telegraph that the two consuls were forced to return to Hamadan by the action of Herr Schunemann, an ex-carpenter from Paoriz, who is nominally the German consul at Eermanshaln 1 personally always doubted the wisdom of allowing His Majesty s consul to return to Kermanshah, but as you will remember, Sir, it was decided at the request of the Russian Legation that Mr. McDouall should be permitted to accompany the new Russian consul thither when it should be possible for the latter to take up his post. Kermanshah being in the Russian zone, I have deferred largely to the views of my Russian colleague as to the question of the re-establishment of the two consulates there and informed Mr. McDouall that he should conform his movements to those of Baron Chirkassof. On the 6th instant I heard from Mr. McDouall that their departure from Hamadan was fixed for the next day but one, and I informed II. de Etter of this intention, expressing the opinion that the consuls should wait until proper arrangements had been made for their reception at Kermanshah, a question which had been under discussion with the Persian Government for some days. M. de Etter replied that he agreed with me and was telegraphing to Baron Ghirkassol to remain at Hamadan until further instructions. He appears, howevei,to have forgotten to send the message, and the consuls started. i i • j As the Russian Legation has at its disposal in the shape of the Gossack brigade and the troops at Kazvin far better means of coercing the Persian Government m this matter than myself, I left further arrangements in M. de Ette, ls.. hands^Jjut h. ( -...,LG J t_ me informed of the course of events and of his own action. [2485 ee- L ■m2 Eventually the two Sehunemann to prevent h s ^ al] escort of bou t fifty Cossacks and obviously foolhardy lo p • Government ordered the Swedish gendarmerie^ fcVbeCanfh h tfsendhn adequate escort, but Captain rfonesson refused on' otticer at ivermansna a similar attempt to get gendarmes from rnhw phhdedVh^k^Etter then threatened to send two squadrons of Russian ^slacks from Kazvin. This produced the desired effect, and a force of gendarmes fctuTllv a rifed when Schunemann’s attack on Kangavar was m progress, but declined to t dm anv part hr the fight and went on to Hamadan As I informed you by telegraph, the Germaifforce retired and the two consuls were able to regam Hamadan in safety. Meanwhile M de Etter had, as I think wisely, reconsidered his decisron to send Cossfcks Kennanshah is of course of the first importance to the Germans and Turks, as it is their sole door of communication with the outer world “d Ae one by which thev introduce arms, ammunition, money, &amp;c. The Germans '°uM e e have kept their position there at all hazards. It is true that the population o e mwn desired the return of the two consuls, but I doubt whether their appearance with a large bodyguard of Russian troops would not have cooled their enthusiasm. In Inv case if is certain that Hassan Raouf, who was not far off would have returned with his own Turkish troops and a horde of Kalbum and Pishkuhis to support him, and the Russians would have required heavy reinforcing, which the Kazvm force is not able t0 ^Tlie Russian Minister therefore made a virtue of necessity and informed the Persian Government that in order to avoid embarrassing them by creating a serious incident he would not send the Cossacks, provided they agreed to provide a sufficient force of Persian Cossacks to take the two consuls to Kermanshah. Orders were then given to Captain Mamomof, at Senneh, to proceed to Kangavar, but the consuls a already left for Hamadan, and it was an open secret that until 700 to 800 men are collected, no attempt to convoy Mr. McDouall and Baron Gbirkassof can succeed For this purpose Colonel Prozorevitch is now collecting the scattered detachments of the brigade from all parts of North-West Persia, even from Tabriz ; they aie to assemble at Hamadan until it is decided whether to renew the attempt of the two consuls to return to Kermanshah or not. Personally 1 believe that they will be kept at Hamadan as a useful striking force in case of necessity nearer the capital. The insolence of the German consul and the open avowal of the German Minister that he could not permit the door of Kermanshah to he closed has given great offence here, hut the Government knows that it is powerless and has had to swallow these affronts.

I consider that to demand substantive appointment of Kawam is undesirable since it would rouse Sowlet’s latent jealousy. At present he is on good terms with Kawam. It is quite beyond the power of the Government of Persia to remove German emissaries from Shiraz and other places and still more so to (intern ?) them but under arrangement suggested in my telegram No. 300 our troops would continue effectively to occupy Bushire until we chose to consider that improved conditions safely make it possible to withdraw them, that is, till cessation of German agitation. Therefore I propose to insist on the conditions laid down in my telegram mentioned above, viz., to restore in Bushire Persian civil authorities and flag as soon as Mukber leaves Shiraz and Kawam takes overcharge from him as Acting Governor-General, new Governors for Shiraz and Bushire being ap pointed with our concurrence. Indemnity to he paid as laid down. Until all possibility of further attacks has passed, troops will remain at Bushire. An agreement to he made by the Government of Persia to take effective steps against German agitation.

The balance lying to the credit of Bushire customs revenue account and general revenue account amounts to a sum of Tomans one hundred and seven thousand odd which is equivalent to about £16,500. The indemnity charges of £10,700 could, therefore, be met from balance in hand, but it would make a big hole in funds here and unless occupation is to terminate almost immediately we should probably find ourselves in monetary difficulties at Bushire.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Please refer to your telegram No. 241 regarding Bushire. This morning I saw the Prime Minister, i said that as anticipated by me the solution he had suggested could not be accepted by xais Majesty’s Government, but 1 was glad to Know that a proposal practically indentical with one i now brought with me had been put forward by the Persian Minister in London. The dismissal of the Governor-General of Ears as a necessary condition of the restoration of Persian Civil authority in Bushire was agreed to by ills Highness without very serious demur, but he then boggled over the punish ment of the Khans and insisted that our troops should be withdrawn at an early date. He would not promise that further punishment should be meted out to the Tufangchis who had actually tahen part in attach and in regard to the Khans who were responsible for it be would give no kind of promise. As regards the troops he said they must be withdrawn in order to appease public opinion. The news of an attempt on the life of the Consul-General at Ispahan was icceived by me at about this point. I at once communicated the imormation to His Excellency and pointed out to him that the public opinion he wished to placate w as that which had brought about occurrences such as this. It was the opinion aroused and paid for by German gold and to his making any concession to it I could not consent. Until all danger was past tne British troops must remain. Gendarmes would, His Excellency said, be sent to which I replied that he w'as setting wolves to guard His Maiesty’s Representative and tnat the suggestion would not be entertained for a moment. Especially in view of the attaoK on the Consul-General I consider His Excel lency’s objections as tantamount to a refusal to give us any satisfaction and as an inaication that there is no intention on the part of the Eersian Govern ment to carry out the policy of neutrality which tney have so often proclaimed and 1 regret to have to telegraph to this effect to you. The attempt at Ispahan was, I warned His Excellency, the fourth of a series of attempts on the tousulai Officeis of tne two Bowers for which no adequate satisfaction had as yet been given. It revealed a most serious situation and the Persian Government had now to make the choice as to whether or not they were going to permit the achievement by the Germans of their object of making our48 position here impossible. Should it be decided by His Excellency now not to give us veiy moderate satisfaction circumstances required that we should draw C ° X ' Cl “ fl T , his attitude &gt; that Pers.au Government contend 1 la tea the possibility of relations ,bein; broken off between Persia and her two neighbours without serious misgiving.

I have the honour to forward, for your information and for any purpose in which you may think fit to use them, two letters in original from Saiyid Amanullah, Deputy in the Majlis for Behbehan, to the Postmaster at Behbehan. Translations of the above are enclosed, and also of a letter from a certain Muhammad Reza Dirisi, a notorious Anglophobe of Bushire, who recently fied from Bushire to Tangistan and joined Wassmuss, whom he now serves as the so-called Bushire correspondent of the “ Jam-i-Jam ”. These letters tend to show that the Germans are embarking on a fresh branch of their campaign, and trying to incite the Kuhgilu tribes to attack the friendly Khans of the maritime plain between Bundar Dilam and Bushire, and thus further to complicate the position at Bushire. Haji Saiyid Agha, Muin-ut-Tujjar, is the Residency news-writer at Behbehan on a very modest salary. I propose to place some funds at his disposal for use when necessary. He has more than once recently complained of the present Postmaster at Behbehan, and I should be glad if you could do something to procure the replacement of this pro-German official. As regards the various branches of the Kuhgilu, the Residency have rendered some service to the ruling Khan of the “ garmsir ” Boir Ahmadis, and Mr. Chick will do what is possible in correspondence with him and two other Boir Ahmadi Chiefs of other clans, who have been in the habit of writing to him : similarly with Asad Khan of the Bawi, who has also written to us in the past. The success of German intrigues at Behbehan would however largely depend on the attitude of the Bakhtiari Government there, which since the hurried departure from Ram Hormuz of Sardar Jang for Ispahan over twomonths ago has been apparently of little account and represented by some twenty Bakhtiaris or less. I have the honour to be, Sir, Tour Excellency’s most obedient, humble servant, His Excellency Sir Charles Marling, K.C.M.G., C.B., Acting Consul-General. His Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Tehran. Sub-Enclosure No. 1. Extract from a censored letter from Saiyid Amanullah, Deputy in the Majlis at Tehran for Behbehan, to Mirza Abdun-Nabi Khan, Postmaster Eehbehan, dated 2nd Ramazan 1333 (loth July 19l5j. &lt; It should be kept very very confidential. You know very well of course how Germany and Austria have made progress. Bussia has been finished and is totally without ammunition. Turkey has made and is making fresh progress in the Caucasus. The matter is this that there have been conversations between the German Legation in Tehran and myself in order to check the development of the fresh plan of these men (the English) in the Kuhgiluyeh and Behbehan by means of the traitors. It is very likely that through my introduction a telegram may be sent to you by the German Legation, giving you instructions to send them daily reports through me. Of course according to the instructions, you should enter into correspondence and communication with the Khans of the Kuh giluyeh and incite and induce them on behalf of the German Government, lou should also hold out every sort of promise. The other fellow, your friend Haji Saiyid Agha Muin-ut-Tujjar, the Besidency news-writer, is also giving them promises but his promises are all false and yours are correct, and are not baseless. In Tehran the German Legation and 1 are ready and will afford every assistance for the furtherance of your object. You should most eneigeticaliy proceed with your work which embraces the welfare of both uns and the other world. If we are able by this means to check the progress of their object, it is the same thing as you have written. ^ A few days ago Sardar Arfa had asked the Ministrv of the Inferior to grant permission to Mulla Abdus-Sevvid who a Y f • lDteil0r t0 aI hipli ‘vr a Y 7 T who has rendered him services, Av Mch are abominable to God and the people, to send his teleo-rams IYpa Tne Mimstry asked me about it and enquiredUut ll procUdY l old them what 1 ' vas expected to say.

Extract from a letter, undated and unsigned, from Borasjun to Doctor Mirza Massan Khan of Behbehan. The envelope is addressed in the hand writing of Muhammad Beza Dirisi (fugitive from Bushire and novo employed by JVassmuss J but he has tried to write it badly in order to mislead. Borasjun, 3rd August 1915. After Muhammad Beza gives account of the syphilis from which he was suffering at Bushire, he states that he was nominated by their Anjuman, which had been established since the outbreak of the European war, to pro ceed to Dashti and Dashtistan for the purpose of agitating the people. He took 20 days’ leave and left Bushire nominally for a change. He brought about an alliance between the Khans of Dashti and Dashtistan, and left the Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh in charge of the matter. The British became aware of this and protested to Haji Muhammad Baqir, Behbehani, against Muhammad Reza’s proceedings and called upon him to discharge him. In view of the hostility of the British and hostile attitude of the Governor towards the “ Patriots ”, he did not think it advisable to return to Bushire. “ In the meantime ” Muhammad Beza goes on “ the German Consul who had been saved out of the hands of the traitor Haidar Khan, and who was staying at Shiraz and was in communication with me, visited Borasjun with the inten tion of joining in the attack on the British with the people of Tangistan. He proceeded to Ahram, and I shared his ideas andjie gave me charge of corre spondence propaganda. ” We arrived at Ahram with great respect. We started most strenuously to collect forces, and within a month 4.000 volun teers from Tangistan, Dashti and Chahkutah assembled: the camp was fixed at Gurak, a place four farsakhs away from Bushire. Unluckily, however, as they were short of ammunition, and Ramazan was fast ‘approaching, they changed their minds, in order that they might attack after getting the supply of their ammunition. Rais Ali, Dilwari, who is thirsting for the blood of the English, on account of his ardent desire, proceeded to Bushire contrary to the arrangement with 100 volunteers without our information. Three months had passed since the alliance of the Khans up to the day of Rais Ali’s raid. During this period the English were engaged in landing troops, guns, ammunition and construct ing strongholds. Notwithstanding the fact that they had heard that the number of the volunteers had risen to 4.000, yet they were unable to bring more than 1,000 men and 12 guns to Bushire.Mi . /j !£■&lt; 5S Rais Ali, in the course of two hours in which he was fighting of his own accord killed two officers, one of whom was the Consul at Ahwaz, an Indian officer’ll sepoys and one of the Governor’s sowars when the Commander- in-Chief (*.&lt;?., Shaikh Hussain) was informed and ordered him to come back. None of them had been wounded. The Consul has proceeded to Shiraz in order to perfect arrangements, and has left me as his agent at Borasjun. He will come back with a large force, and he will assuredly clear Bushire from the stain of the British troops. iZg intends sending emissaries to all parts of Persia to awaken the people. Be wanted to send me sometime ago to Pehhehany but it was more necessary to keep me here. I have made your name known to him, but no reply has so far been received. Could you accept the post if he agrees to appoint you ? In order to bring about an alliance among the tribesmen, who may attack the friends of the British while Bushire is being attacked. You should arrange, if you can, that they should attack Haidar Khan just now, because the volunteers on this side intend attacking him before the arrival of the Consul. In order that my son, Muhammad Karim, might learn writing, he has written this letter. f ![This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty*s Government, and should be retnrned to the Foreign Office when dene with unless required for official nsa.] 9 '7 \ \ * ■ # w POLITICAL .

Knowing that I feel anxious about the safety of British Consul and community at Shiraz, they are trying to use it as a means to induce us to evacuate Bushire. Position of Consul becomes still more dangerous by their attitude and I have sent him instructions to prepare to leave Shiraz. The Bakhtiari are professing at Ispahan and Tehran that without orders from Government they cannot bring sowars, and Prime Minister will try to make these orders conditional on our evacuation of Bushire. Of course Khan&amp; are taking advantage of this opportunity to squeeze money out of us.

Our Newswriter at Herat suspects Governor of playing a double game j it is reported by him that visitors were received by the people with some enthusiasm, but I think that for the present party will be interned and that Amir’s orders will be obeyed by the Governor.

From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Please refer to my telegram No. 279. - Russian Minister has sent a wire to Petrograd which is couched in very pessimistic terms. He is of opinion, in which I largely concur, that Germans with their Mujtahids, and gendarmerie ate virtually masters in some of principal towns of Persia, viz., Shiraz,, Kermanshah and Ispahan, and that Germans are seeking to reproduce in Tehran itself these same conditions and that in other (places ?) such as Luristan and* Amir Habibnlia Khan. in the south of Persia anarchists hold sway. He is also of opinion that German plan is to undermine authority of Persian Government to point when it will be incapable of maintaining a semblance of order, to render position of our Consuls, &amp;c., in Persia so precarious that they will have to be withdrawn and finally that plau aims at expelling legation itself from Tehran.

I would invite your attention to Tehran telegram 298 addressed to Foreign Office. For Consul to leave Shiraz or to make preparations to do so would, I respectfully submit, be a great mistake. He is not alone there. At Shiraz there is also a British community which includes ladies and children if I am not mistaken. If our people did leave Shiraz where, except to Ispahan, could they go ? Surely by remaining in Consulate under guard they run less risk. Enemy’s objective is Bushire. To judge from reports of Consul at Shiraz there does not appear to be any lively reason to expect trouble there. Kawam will probably assist Consul. Governor-General would probably not allow Consul or British Community to be harmed for sake of his own-skin. The withdrawal of our Consul from Shiraz would have worst effect possible on situation generally. I venture to suggest that Governor-General should be warned that he himself will suffer personally should any harm come to any of our people.

After compliments .—As promised in my letter, dated the 25th August 1915 (corresponding to 13th Shawal 1333 Hijra), I now furnish Your Majesty with further information regarding the party of alien conspirators who crossed into Afghanistan via Chah Big. It appears from the detailed report of the British Consul at Sistan that this party was constituted as follows v — (а) Six Germans, including three named Fischer, Litten and Frederich. ( б ) Two self-styled Indian Princes whose identity is not known but who are obviously impostors. {c) Two or three Turks; one said to be named Pasha Nasib, and another Kasim Beg. (&lt;2) A Mulla, suspected to be a notorious fire-brand, named Muham mad Barkatullah, who was formerly employed iu Japan, wffiere his revolutionary views brought him into disgrace. (e) A so-called Kabuli artillery officer, named Mir Mast; believed to be Mir Mast Afridi, a Jemadar belonging to an Indian regiment who, in the face of the enemy, deserted his post of duty in France in the most cowardly fashion.48 (/) A Persian, named Asghar Zadeh, formerly Chief of Police at Tuc, (g) Sixty Arab soldiers from Baghdad. (h) Pifty mules laden with tents and water-skins. It is thought that this information may assist Your Majesty in dealing with this unwarranted intrusion of political adventurers upon the neutral soil JT of Afghanistan. As intimated in my brief letter, dated the 25th August 1915 (corresponding to 13th Shawal 1333 Hijra), I have received Your Majesty’s letter, dated the 31st July 1915 (corresponding to 18th Ramazan 1333 Hijra). Your Majesty’s friendly assurances have given me sincere pleasure, and I have caused them to be brought to the notice of His Majesty the King-Emperor, who will warmly appreciate the attitude which Your Majesty has adopted towards those who, in defiance of the rules of neutrality, seek by bribery and religious hypocrisy to utilise the Afghan State as a base, and Your Majesty’s subjects as agents, in their clumsy designs to cause embarrassment to the British Empire in the East.— Usual ending* 130 Telegram P., No. S. 886, dated the 30th August 1915.

The incident of Baud Khan together with the bastinadoing of his sowars and the flogging of the deportee who returned with the Germans has had a quietening effect upon the town. The Germans were not able to borrow a carriage in which to bring Baud Khan back. To avoid polities several Khans have gone to their country houses and practically all important Mullas have done the same. A force sufficient entirely to dominate town has been collected by the authorities. Bohnstorff’s divergence to Laristan and the complete scattering of Wagner’s party has removed any immediate anxiety as to fresh outbreak of enthusiasm of pro-German nature.

They were reinforced yesterday by another 90 under well-known Luti. I shall be very much surprised if 200 altogether reach Kazerun and still more so if any at all reach Borasjuu. Soulet shows no signs at present of joining campaign. It is of course possible that agitation may spread and assume really formidable dimensions, but if friendly Khans can make good their position now this danger will be largely diminished.

When Governor of Bushire left, Karguzar stayed behind in order to settle up affairs in connection with disposal of property, &amp;c.

Shiraz telegram No. 293, August 26th:— Begins. Reference Bushire telegram No. 490 C. I venture to submit my views on general situation for consideration. Condition of affairs at and near Borasjun is obviously intolerable and its continuance threatens to involve Xashgai and other tribes from further (?) inland. Immediate punishment of expedition would undoubtedly he most satisfactory method of dealing with situation, but as pointed out by Your Excellency in your telegram No. 105 to Government of India aggressive action on our part at this moment would almost certainly set whole of Southern Persia in a blaze and would certainly render position of British subjects (in) Shiraz and perhaps at Ispahan very precarious. As regards Shiraz, I am of opinion that, could present Governor-General be recalled and Kawam appointed, it would be possible for him to keep Ears quiet whilst we dealt with hostile Khans as seemed best to us and I think in this case few if any Kashgai would join in confederacy. I venture, therefore, to submit opinion that for the present our policy should be confined to encouraging friendship of Khans with all possible moral and material help and by arranging with Sheikh of Mohammerah to despatch force to be ready to support Ismail Khan* when required. And that as soon as situation in Ears has assumed more satisfactory complexion we should ourselves organize such punitive measures as seem necessary. Addressed Tehran; repeated to Bushire.

All English letters in down post just in were seized at Borasum by Wassmuss agent rather to Khans’ annoyance. Telegrams from MukhbirSultnneh to our friends Haidar Khan and Ismail Klian of SLabankareh through. Gendarme Officer, Borasjnn, have now been sent to us in original. These are most objectionable^ upbraiding!' these two pro-British Khans as traitors enjoining them to compose their ’differences with Borasjun and unite to oppose British aggression under threats of curses of nation and posterity. His Excellency warns them that Darya Begi is being sent to effect this reconcilia tion. Similar telegrams from moderate socialis t party of Ears give these friendly Khans final chance to ally themselves with Khan of Borasjun. Even more violent and menacing are two letters in original from Abutalib Khan, Gendarme Officer, Borasjun, who has been band in glove with Wassmuss and openly hostile to friendly Khans. He proclaims that hostile Khans and all are engaged in holy war, urges them to make peace with Khan of Borasjun and put an end to infidels. He says he has been grappling with foreigners in Ears for four years and calls on our friends to join Nasirdiwan of Kazerun with 5,000 men, Darya Begi with 6,000, and Soulet to proceed to Bushire and rescue Persian women from English. Wherever they are killed they will be martyrs. We have also received original letter to Khan of Shabankareh from Khan of Borasjun and telegram to latter from Nasirdiwan of Kazerun calling on first named to join them in cause of Islam to attack British and crush Haidar Khan, the traitor. Above resume will show Your Excellency to what dangerous pitch feelings of tribesmen of hinterland are being worked up by instigation and support of Mukhbir Sultaneh and gendarmes; and further how necessary it is for us to do all we can to support friendly Khans in their armed opposition of plans of Governor-General and hostile Khans and prevent them yielding to this exceeding pressure. It is very clear intentions of hostile Khans against Bushire are greatly hampered by Shabankareh-Borasjun struggle.

Yesterday after three hours* conversation Prime Minister said that our conditions would be agreed to in principle by him, though he took exception to amount of indemnity and suggested a procedure as followsPersian authority restored at Bushire and Governor-General, Pars, to be recalled simultaneously. Persian Government to pledge itself to put an end to German agitations and to punish Khans implicated in attack as soon as possible. Our troops to remain until danger of further attack is passed. I mentioned that I had no hope that such terms would be accepted by His Majesty’s Government, but that they would, before terminating formal occupation, certainly insist on removal of Governor-General. Proposal is otherwise worth considering. In the south Governor-General has been chief instrument of German agitation and in Persian eyes, his removal will be a decided blow to them. Consul, Shiraz, alw r ays puts his removal as most important point. Of course the other (?) promises are valueless, as Government are absolutely powerless to fulfil them and their hold is moreover very precarious. However, it may last long enough to get rid of Governor-General. Our effect, on the other hand, continues and we are relieved of the nuisance of Raving to administer Bushire wTiile the irritation is removed of foreign relations all oyer Persia at hauling down of Persian iiag f Would His Majesty’s Goyernmenf agree to this proposal modified as follows-.—That at Bushire Persian authority is not restored until Governor- General has definitely left and Kawam-uf-Muik appointed as Acting Gov ernor-General of I ars; with, regard to selection of twu new Governors of Shiraz and Bushire Legation to be consulted. 96 Telegram R., No. 506 C., dated the 29t.h (received 30th) August 1915.

Enclosure No. 1. PROCLAMATION. The Government of His Britannic Majesty has issued instructions that His Majesty’s forces now at Bushire shall immediately occupy the Town and Island, assume the administration of Bushire and take control of the Customs House. This action has been taken by His Majesty’s Government, owing to the conviction which has been unwillingly forced upon them, that the Persian Government can no longer maintain order in Bushire and its neighbourhood, a conviction which has received fresh confirmation from the recent regrettable attack by tribesmen on Bushire in which two British officers were killed and three sepoys killed and wounded. The situation is thus one which cannot be tolerated by His Majesty’s Government who have therefore been compelled to take such measures as may be considered necessary in their own interests and will continue to occupy Bushire until such time as the Persian Government undertake to exact full reparation from the guilty parties for the recent attack and to comply with the other demands of the British Government. No hostile action will be taken against the officials and people of Bushire unless they themselves take hostile measuies. In compliance with the orders of the exalted (British Government) the people of the Island of Bushire and all concerned should th erefor e take note that from this day I have taken over the Government of Bushire on behalf of the British Government.

This plan is extremely difficult to defeat especially on dark windy nights such as we are having at present. The Officer Commanding at Bushire has accordingly requested me to send a notice round to all Europeans to inform them that he considers it advisable that Europeans should sleep up at the Telegraph Station for the present.

In this eventuality as gendarmerie are openly in favour of Wassmuss and assist him by all means in their power the tower occupied by them and situa tion in our line of outposts will be a source of weakness and positive danger to our defence. I venture strongly to urge that Your Excellency will be good enough a crain to press on Persian Government to order gendarmerie to hand over to Gov ernor to whom it belongs.

In my front Amarah is 130 miles away ; and in order to lend aid to tribesmen, who are at present desirous of our friendship but whose attitude may change at any moment, and to counteract the effect of the Turks continually push ing forward advanced posts from their Kut concentration, I have to adopt a similar system of advanced posts from Amarah onwards.

The expression “ subject to Cox’s advice,” used therein, was intended to show the difference between Cox’s position as Political Resident in the Bushire district of a neutral Persia, where his advice in matters dealing with the support of the local authorities in maintaining order in Bushire would be of the greatest value to you, and his position as Political Officer with your forces operating in enemy country of Mesopotamia. It was not used to convey the impression that Cox was not under your command in any military operations necessary for the defence of Bushire. Cox’s knowledge and experience of notables and the political situation in Bushire is unparalleled and the Government of India are confident that you will make use of that knowledge and experience to the fullest extent, so that you should run as little risk as possible of taking unnecessary military action in a field so far away from your most important responsibilities.

Grant, C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. In amplification of my telegrams 299-C. and 301-C., dated 12th and 13th, respectively, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government India, the following report on the affair of of thenight of the 12th instant. As has already been reported, Wassmuss. the German Agent, had succeeded in getting together a collection of tufangchis under the leadership of Zair Khidhar of Ahram, Rais Ali Dilwari and Shaikh Huss in of Chakutah with the object of attack ing Bushire. Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh, who had been for some time the leading spirit among Wassmuss’ adherents, Jaterly stood aloof and finally did not assist at all on the ostensible ground that his men were engaged in fighting Ismail Khan ot Shabankareh. In point of fact they were but Ghazanfar had no reason to interfere on behalf of Agha Khan in the everlasting disputes between the latter and his uncle Ismail Khan. I am inclined to think that the real reason for his working off was that he suddenly remembered that he had a sum of 10,000 turmns lying in deposit with the Bushire Branch, and he (not without reason) feared that he would never see it again if he personally joined in the attack on Bushire. The fact that he stood out at the last minute does not, in my opinion, make him any the less guilty than the other three Khans because for weeks he was the principal member and the life and soul of the whole confederacy. Besides this he sent a certain number of men subrosd to join the gathering. As reported in my despatch Cf.-267, dated 12th July 1915 to His Majesty s Minister the Khans issued ridiculous proclamations, and published Artie es of War, etc. and behaved as if they considered themselves independent of the Persian Government. They also spread false reports about their intention to attack Bushire on certain occasions. On the morning of the 12th instant I received a report from a resident in Bushire that he had received news that a party of Dilwans and P^ sllt j s to th( ; number of about 200 would reach a place called Khor Kuzi, or Bagh-i-Kuzi one of the re-entrants on the east side of the “Island” between Sabzabad and Hahleh about noon. Their intention was reported to be to he up there until after night fa when they would make an attack on the south portion of the outpost line, sim ^ ne ' ously with the main attack which would be delivered Ly Zair Rhidfiar and ^ liaik Hussain straight across the Mashilleh at Mogam and Tanga . Thiq rpnort seemed very like the numerous detailed false or incorrect reports previously received. It was discussed between Major Oliphant Captain RoS R A., y Captain Ranking and myself and it Jed tha Major Oliphant accompanied by Captain Ranking and / Escort should go out and try and ascertain i e P Horriment a portion immediate news would be telephoned to the headquarters of of which would remain under arms ready to come ou I prepared a note setting forth the events which took place after Major Ohphant and Captain Ranking went °y do^hat they could to counter- ments of the Dufiadar and a sowar who ^ officermethisdeath. I think, give a sufficiently clear account of submitted a report to the Colonel Lane, Commanding the 96th (Berar) Mant^ Jas subm a ^ After the two officers had ^^JgQ^yardnL^of Mzabad. They were outposts which crosses the Island about 50 y o 286 (w)fd2o , 4 - -A n hv (laDtain Apthorp and some men of the 96th who with the Tibs 0 the reconnoitring party held them. After sunset they advanced to attack remains ui f i r iven off Some horsemen and others were seen at dusk advancing 8 acrossle Mashilleh, but the attack by Zair Khidhar and Shaikh Hussain never materialized. A report spread by the tribesmen .s to the effect that while Zrmte when they halted for a rest, a man was killed by the accidental discharge of a rifle, which was considered a bad omen, so the party retired My own idea is that as the party approached Bushire they heard the sound of the guns ofH. M. S. “ Lawrence ” and one of the Turkish guns now here; this would, I expect, be an even worse omen for the success of their attack which entirely depends on a surprise. Subsequent enquiry leads me to believe that 150 to 200 men came across with Rais Ali to “ Kuzi,” while about 500 started with Zair Khidhar and bhaikh Hussain acorss the Mashilleh. A further party of about 100 is reported to have arrived in the neighbourhood of Halileh from the mam land about nightfall on the 12th, and to have been frightened away by the shells from H. M. S. “ Lawrence. ” As regards reparation for this attack and the loss of two British officers I have already made my suggestions in my telegram 305-C., dated 14th July 1915 I have only to add that'*! am convinced that no form of punishment will be understood locally which does not include a punitive expedition to crush the four guilty Khans. Measures against the Persian Government will hardly affect them at all, and if no punitive columns are sent out, the Khans will think (and not without reason) that they can declare war on the British, attack them in Bushire and kill two British officers with impunity. A copy of this letter is being sent to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Note on the events of the afternoon and night of the 12th July 1915. In the forenoon of the 12th July news was received that a party of Dilwaris and Dashtis under the command of Rais Ali of Dilwar were en route for Bushire and would probably arrive about noon at “ Khor (or Bagh) Kuzi ” where they would lie quiet for the day and attack the Sabzabad end of the outpost line in the evening or at night, while the Mogam end would be attacked by the parties of Zair Khidhar and Shaikh Hussain who would come across direct from Pakushi (about 15 miles ©ff) where they were encamped with Wassmuss. This information was from a new and not very reliable source and very much resembled numerous very circumstantial but false reports which had been received from time to time. It was therefore decided to verify it before calling out the reserve of the Regiment which had been very hardworked lately. Accordingly Major Oliphant, 96th (Berar) Infantry, Commanding the outpost line, and Captain Ranking, Assistant Resident, accompanied by a party of six sowars (all available) and 26 sepoys, left the Residency at about 3 p.m. to reconnoitre. The idea was that if the enemy were seen party should at once withdraw sending two sowars back to inform Sabzabad and the post at Tangak-i-Zangena where there is a field telephone. A party of the Regiment were held in immediate readiness to proceed out. Apparently about 4-30 Captain Ranking and the sowars suddenly came on the enemy sitting in a garden, and saw they were in considerable numbers. Captain Ranking at once gave the order to gallop oh, but the Tangistanis spotted the sowars at the same moment and gave them a volley just as they were going off. This unfortunately brought down one of the sowars’ horses which was shot dead. Captain Ranking pulled up to extricate the sowar who was not hurt—this he did and the sowar got away safely—but as he was mounting he was hit and fell. Major Oliphant who was about 200 or 300 yards behind with some of his sepoys came up to extri cate Captain Ranking and was apparently shot in the arm as he was coming up. When he reached Captain Ranking he came under very heavy fire and finding that it was impossible to get Captain Ranking away—probablv the latter had been hit again and killed m this period as he had a second wound through the hand—Major Oliphant gave the order to retire. As he started to do so he was hit again twice and killed. One sepoy was also killed and two wounded.At the first sight of the enemy two sowars had galloped off, one to Sabzabad and the second to Zangena and the Regiment had been warned by telephone and was coming np. Meanwhile Captain Apthorp (96th), Commanding the post at Zangena, collected all the men available there and at the next post and went forward in support. After the death of Major Oliphant the sowars and sepoys under the command of a Havildar fell back on Captain Apthorp’s party and with its assistance occupied one or two vine sangars (circular loose stone-walls round vines and fig trees to protect them) and held the enemy. The regimental reserves had by this time arrived and a certain amount of firing took place. At dusk the enemy attacked the southern outpost line and were received with a heavy fire in which one of the two captured Turkish field guns sent to Bushire joined. A little later H. M. S. “ Lawrence ” joined in with some long range shots from her 4' guns. The Tangistanis were evidently not aware that the Turkish gun was on that line and was quite taken aback when it opened fire ; there is no doubt that its fire coupled with that of the “ Lawrence ” materially contributed to the repulse of the enemy who withdrew and decamped during the night. At dawn when the Regiment made a reconnaissance down to Halileh no trace could be found of them except some splashes of blood and some empty cartridge cases. The bodies of the two officers were recovered, only their revolvers and ammunition had been taken. From independent sources it was ascertained that Rais Ali and his party started from the neighbourhood of Gurak in the early forenoon coming staright across to “ Kuzi ” by a direct route known to the people of Chatal, some of whom joined and acted as guides. Zair Khidhar and Shaikh Hussain started in the afternoon to make a combined attack. Some of the latter party which included some sowars were seen from Zangena and made an attack there, but apparently Zair Khidhar’s party when leaving the island heard the firing of the Turkish gun and the “ Lawrence ” and thought better of it. The enemy’s idea of a combined attack was thus frustrated by the discovery of the advance party. It is deeply to be regretted that two British officers lost their lives in locating it. Subsequently it was reported that Rais Ali s party withdrew to Dilwar, where they are expecting an attack, Zair Khidhar and Wassmuss withdrew their camp from Pakushi to Ahram while Shaikh Hussain withdrew his party to the neighbour hood of Tuli-Siah, up to the present it is not clear whether the tribesmen have “ recule pour mieux sauter,” whether they propose to sit tight for Ramzan, or whether they wish to squeeze more money out of Wassmuss.

Nadir Khan, Sowar, 28th Light Cavalry, one of Residency Escort, states-: On the afternoon of the 12th I went out with the Duffadar and four other sowars in charge of Captain Ranking to reconnoitre. W e went south from ^ab abad in extended order. I was on the extreme left next to Captain Ranking. Aft glXough the big nullah we worked on to the high ground on the east side of the Island. I was ,up on the edge of the cliff, and when we got near Kuz. I saw five or six men below on a stony mound under some palm trees. 1 dre ^ Captain Ranking’s attention to them and said, “ there are some of the enemy. Captain Ranking looked through his glasses, but did not say whether they were enemy. He made a sign to get back quietly. Then we saw a lot more of the enemy and they fired some shots and Captain Ranking gave the order to retire. Directly after we turned to gallop away my horse was hit and got behind, then ne fell and pinned my leg down. As we went up Major Oliphant and his men were some distance behind ; as we retired to the west he was on my right. When I fell there were a non-eommission- ed officer and three men of the Regiment near and I called to them and asked them to help me to get my leg out, hut they did not do so. Captain Ranking had got some distance ahead, but stopped his horse, was wounded and he got down, with the intention, I think, of coming to my assistance. But he was hit and fell some dis tance off me. A lot of shots were whizzing round me and I did not see exactly where he fell. I saw Major Oliphant and some men coming np on my right, but did not see how he was killed. I managed eventually to get my leg out from under the horse and got away. I dragged my carbine out from its bucket under the horse, determined to have some shots at the enemy if they got up to me, and then got down into a nullah and retreated towards the post. As I got out from under the horse I saw Major Oliphant coming up with a few men in the direction of the spot where Captain Ranking was lying. As I got away I saw 50 or 60 of the enemy coming up towards me. There were many more on the Halileh road and trying to get round the party. I worked my way back to where the large vine sangar is and then I fell in with Captain Apthorp who had come up from the outposts and the Duffadar. Bushire ; The 19th July 1915. Before me. A. P. TREVOR.Note on the wounds received by Major E. Oliphant, 96thBerar Infantry, and Captain J. G. Banking, Political Department, on 12th July 1915. Major Oliphant. — The body was in rigor mortis, the lower limbs fixed slightly upon the abdomen, which was distended. The face was livid, the left side together with the forehead being dark bine in colour. This coloration extended in a patchy manner to the right side. A small cut seen in the right nostril and blood oozed in small quantity from the right nostril. When the position of the body was changed from the dorsal to the right lateral decubitus, blood oozed from nose and mouth. There was the usual post mortem lividity, especially in dependant parts. Ants had started to eat the skin, and several erosions so caused were found distributed over legs and abdomen. No attempt seemed to have been made to mutilate the body. The wounds recived were as follows :— (1) A bullet wound of the right arm in the upper 1-3—the wound of the entry was in the axilla just below the anterior fold and the wound of exit was in the postero-external side of the arm on the same level. The bone had been shattered, and the upper fragment was pointed and on the movement of the arm the extremity pressed upon and deformed the soft parts, but did not project externally through the wound. (2) In the abdomen, a wound of entry was situated in the left lumber region in front, about 4' lateral to, and below, the umbilicus. The exit wound of the bullet was in the back at the same level as the anterior wound and about the same vertical plane. (3) In the chest, a bullet wound of entry was found in the second left inter space just external to the border of the sternum—the wound of exit was in the back on the right side, and situated 1^ below the lower angle of the right scapula and the vertical plane of that angle. The bullet apparently traversed the chest obliquely from left to right and from above down the structures in its track being the arch of the aorta, the pulmonary artery and the vessels at the root of the lung. This wound must have been im mediately fatal. Captain Banking .— The wounds were as follows :— A wound of entry in the left abdomen just below the level of the umbilicus and 3| inches lateral to it.

Foreign Secret. 967 S. Persia. Nixon telegraphs having received news from Cox at Basra that Grahame, Consul-General at Ispahan, has telegraphed he left Ispahan for Ahwaz on 14th September after destroying Cypher Codes and expects to arrive at Ahwaz about 14th October. Nixon and Cox both express their regret at this intelligence. Nixon adds that he has lately taken great pains to reassure Euro yean staff of oil fields regarding situation, and arrival of Consulate staff in neighbourhood of oil fields after having evacuated Ispahan may have deplorably bad effect in that place as it will again disturb minds of staff of Anglo-Persian Oil Co. I have no news as yet of developments at Ispahan which prompted Grahame’s departure at a moment when the Persian Government had shown themselves more amenable to reason. I agree with Nixon that this course is regrettable, and I trust that there is no idea of Grahame remaining at Ahwaz and thus adding to our responsibilities in that place.mils Pocnment is the Property ol His Brltonalc Majesty a Government, and Bhonld be returned to the Foreign Offlce when done with nniA ^ required for official nae.] POLITICAL RUSSIA Cypher telegram to Sir G e Buchanan (petrograd) Foreign Office.

It was uot my intention to suggest that His Majesty’s Government should pay anything in the nature of an allowance to Governor and Kaiguzai but that Persian Government should do this. There is a lot of money lying here to credit of Bushire Customs account from which we could pay. Perhaps an allowance for Governor might he fixed at £1,000. Persian Government will he saving full salaries which they would have had to p&amp;y to Governor and Karguzar. As Governor’s age is fifty or thereabouts and he is a man of fairly settled convictions, I should not think that it would make any great difference if he and Professor Brown met. Present desire of Governor however is to live a secluded life. Governor is very keen on getting away and is afraid he will shortly be singled out as the object of one of these nocturnal raids which are taking place.

Apparently they think (not without some show of reason) that they can with impunity do what they like, lo prevent small bodies of tribesmen, on dark nights, getting through the out post line(s) is almost impossible, and we shall apparently, until some punitive measures are taken against the Khans, have to put up with these constant rams. 1 he ladies should, the Officer Commanding of troops suggests, he taken away, hut to do this immediately after our occupation of Bushire would in my opinion, look as though we considered ourselves unable to protect our own people and would create a had effect. ^ 49 Telegram P., No. 1615 B., dated (and received) the 14th August 1915.

No. 249. I have had no communication whatever with- Government, except a tardy- expression of regret from His Majesty the Shah which he made before occupation of Bushire. Result of our occupation of Bushire taken by itself has fallen rather fiat, as from past experience Persians are aware that we always recall our troops. However taken along with appearance of Russian and British troops in east and north-east of Persia and about the same time the quite undesigned march of a part of Kasvin garrison in this direction, it has given the Grovernment something to think about, and pro-German party in Tehran is making a strenuous effort to get together under their representative, Mustaufi-el-Mamalik, and this party is so composed that it would not be possible for us to refuse to tolerate it. My press campaign has been so far successful in its effect that a general concensus of opinion now obtains that Mejlis which can permit itself to be domineered by a minority is a useless incumbrance. I hope to get at least one of our demands for reparation for Bushire outrage out of M. if he does succeed in forming a Cabinet which I doubt. Dismissal of Governor of Fars seems easiest and most pressing of our demands, and then I propose to turn him out of office. He is a man who depends too much on pi;o-German democrats, to be able to take sustained action against the German party for us to tolerate his remaining at the head of affairs, but of course as long as he keeps straight we will keep him. Prolongation of Cabinet question here is due to inability of Russians to send additional troops to Kasvin and we can only secure the friendship of the Persian Cabinet by making impossible the existence of every other combina^ tiou.\ 19 Telegram K., No. 430 C., dated the 15th (received 16th) August 1915.

I have the honour to for- Shiraz, No. 17, dated 7th ward, for the information of the Government of India, copies of the marginally-cited extracts from newspapers and a copy of a notice posted in Bushire about July 26th. It will be seen that the articles are all virulently ^anti-British in tone. The writer of the article in the “ Jam-i-Jam ,s , No. 18, is Mahommed Reza Derisi, a well-known pro-German agitator of Bushire, who was recently smuggled out of Bushire by the gendarmes when the Governor was on the point of arresting and deporting him. Mahommed Reza’s style of writing is, I understand, unmistakeable to the educated Persian, but in any case the last sentence of the article gives away that he is the author, as the same phrase was used in a draft article sent from Wassmuss’s camp as “ from a Bushire correspondent ” which recently fell in to our hands. The “ Jam-i-Jam ” is a paper started and subsidised by Wassmuss and maintained chiefly by subscriptions of his friends and adherents. The “ lazianeh ” is, I think, slightly more independent, but also no doubt receives a subsidy from AY assmuss, which helps it to eke out a precarious existence. 1.

Supplement to the “Jam-i-Jam', No. 18, dated the 14th Eamsan 1333 ( 27 th July 1913), entitled “The situation in the South A The present position or proofs of the weakness of the English. them^briefhv'thr ° Ur ^ 0 . m P a ^ r j 0 ^ s the present situation, we will tell hi icily the relations of individuals among the people, and of the Chiefs22 in the South with the Enolish. c; n ‘ _ a English considered themsefves not only the Governw and'Vnl* *' C ® tl f e but the bumble conduct and slave-like action of ^ r ’ T ? t . he So ! ,th &gt; Zthrstt 06 ^ ^ the * without utht^hf'owner '1 had uled^rmedtoL^^thc H 1,e0n f lab0Urin ? f ° r 150 years ’ and wl,CTe thp y aa useu aimed torce at the time of occupation, still when an Officer or Head was going to visit the villages on inspection, in spite of the f.ot W in * not a man with a rifle in India, the/consid^red ?t lmpe™tive hemTelve: to start with a certain force, lest danger would befall them. ‘hemseives n But in these parts it has been often seen that a single man Mr Chiel- the Vice-Oonsul, has started with a handbag and a single' sowar from ’ Bushire entered all Dasliti and Dashtistan, wliich are all armed and are the warlike people of the South, even into the nomad tribes, and found that he was respected and esteemed m every way. While, in order to show the valour and prowess of his cunning Government, such villages like Dilwar were being bombarded for the sake of a single unworthy and unimportant Tangistam, and a trivial accusation, yet in the same way he was visiting alone Boras]un, Chahkutah and even Behbehan. D Apparently no one had the ability to think over the matter. But at present this state of things and the previous effects have undergone such changes and the people, high and low, have taken up sack a hostile attitude that, without exaggeration, if they land four thousand men with numerous guns to Bushire, they will not be able to take a step beyond the first tower of Muqam, the extreme end of Bushire. We have seen the reason of this. Ever since they tried to dishonour the Persians, arrested and expelled the Germans in Bandar Big and Bushire contrary to the neutrality of Persia, and attacked the house of Haji Ali of Tamgak and there were rumours of unity among the chiefs of Daskti and Dashtistan with a view to reprisals, not a single officer has been able to leave Bushire, in spite of the fact that they had landed one thousand men at Bushire to defend themselves, and with the help of the traitor, Muwaqqar-ud-Douleh had placed many guns in such positions as were necessary and made strong sangars. 3 They saw very well that the German Consul was sometimes at Abram, 8 farsakhs from Bushire, and another time at Shamshiri, 6 farsakhs, and finally 15 days at Gurak, 4 farsakhs from Bushire, and was being kept by the Tangistanis, who were openly showing themselves as the enemies of the I English, particularly during his stay at Shamshiri and in the first days of his stay at Gurak there were not more than 40-50 tufangchis, yet they were unable to take a step from Bushire and take such illegal action as they were wont to do. Agha Shaikh Hussain Khan, Chahkutahi, who formerly was their great and close friend, seeing that religion was concerned, at once declared himself on hostile terms with them, and showed opposition to them and became the founder of the combination in the South. The Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh, who was always known for his moderation joined hands with the confederates, although he showed weakness afterwards. However, as he has now perceived their weakness with his own eyes, he is hotly bent upon revenge and the preservation of his honour. At present, the persons among the Khans in Dashti, Dashtistan and the Ports who shows himself in favour of the English is Haidar Khan, the traitor and Muwaqqar-ud-Douleh, the offender, and none else. Although Ismail Khan in reply to those respected gentlemen, who had come from Kazerun to make peace, showed himself as assisting the English, yet his attitude is like that of a two days’ old guest. Those who have become courageous in their sin and notorious, and who are ready to sacrifice themselves even with their lives in assisting the English, are those two traitors. The English have of late hit on a good plan. As they are convinced that they cannot defend themselves with their present force against the con federates they haye tried to curtail the forces of confederates, and to keep1 23 ■ ,1 n* one side. The plan is that ever since the unity of the them occupied on one side. t Islnai i Khan’s son-in-law had secretly volunteers m the bourn, ii,, d &gt; for many years past, there has allied himself until th ® ™“ f ®{ a e r ! us -Sultaneh and Ismail Khan, and the former been enmity tetwen Ghaza Khan therefore wanted to give a lesson is also a member oi the ailiar ’ , ce for a ]p But as he saw the . to Agha Khan, and even to ge i o ^g^^pth with him, he did not forces of the confederates an a “ English perceived his difficulty, gave think that he throngh Haidar Khan and showed all sorts bi ffi assurances °f their msnh ^ S atteck Ag ,, a Khan. Ismail Khan at of co-operation ana tnt y g of the particular villages of Agha Khan, once occupied Cham-i-Hai wain, one ot Khan’s forces were also sent and two” thousand men attacked Agha Khan who thus was in to assist, ana aoom in accordance with the alliance, sent f--a, * « 'v' Liw ,«i , r , i».i. troops With the les et the Governor-General of Kars gave Slde ns e 7and°uSd threats it had’no effect; it is only right because “ the tish is counsel and. . , i . c : tsj f q ii and all these cries are made by the ^7.^: ^“^ for^^bind them all). They (the British) are the men who have instigated this trouble and sedition and as long as aie me men v&gt; o their hands. In the meantime, the Governor n of the P Gulf Ports, Ld the traitor to Persia, Muwaqqar-ud-Douleh under instructions from the English, sent a 8-centemetre gun to Sluef to assist IsmaU Khan, which meant a triumph for Haidar Khan, and the defeat of the confederates. You should now see what an extraordinary state of things results. Persons who have committed all sorts of treason towards their Government, and their nation and religion, are to be given a gun, while those persons who have joined the hands of fraternity and brotherhood with each other are despised and condemned! , , c -n u Hurrah for ^he diplomacy of the Government authorities . Still we should thank His Excellency Mukhbir-us-Suitaneh, who, having received news of the arrival of the gun, immediately issued an order to the gendarmerie that the Government gun was not to intervene in operations, and that it was to be used against the party which refused to make peace. He ordered the ^ gendar merie at once to seize the gun, and to use it against any party which may refuse to make peace. As soon, however, as the news of the arrival of the gun reached the Tangistanis and Chahkutahis, they also at once proceeded to take measures $pd b fire at present engaged in sending contingents. A part of them has already arrived at Borasjun. They claim someting more. They say that they should extirpate Haidar Khan, the traitor, according to their first agreement. If the Government wanted to punish him, it would have done so and would not have treated him in this way. At present fighting is in progress and the front gets wider and wider day by day. It is not known if the gun which has arrived will be easily surrendered to the gendermerie. If the Tangistanis get ready with all their force, they will totally annihilate Haidar Ktian and his followers. The night is pregnant and we should see what the morning brings forth ' (i.e.. there is something progressing, we should see the result). N.

Enclosure No. 4. Telegram. Extract from the “ Tazianeh ”, No. 24, dated Shiraz, 6th Eamzan 1333 (19th July 1915). To His Excellency the Governor-General of Ears.

With a view to preserving the prestige of Islam and independence of the dominions of Persia and to blocking the paths for the pretexts and intrigues of the foreigners and to the delicate position of neutrality merely for the sake of God, we volunteered to make peace between the Khans of Dashtistan and we made up our minds at Kazerun to remove by whatever means the antagonism on both sides and to get them to conclude peace and unite sincerely with each other, and to guard against the critical situation, and to get them to assist in the execution of the Governments orders. We divided ourselves in two parties, and some of us visited the Ghazanfar- us-Sultaneh, while the other one, the Chief one, visited Ismail Khan. We made a truce of hostilities for the time being. We were first under the im pression that the flame of the trouble was perhaps actuated by a desire on the part of both parties to acquire each other’s territories. After obtaining full information regarding the geography of the territories of both sides, we put forward the terms of peace. Indeed Agha Khan and Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh &lt;and the other Khans allied with them accepted them, and showed themselves ready to unite with each other and not to allow the intrigues of foreigners to shake the neutrality of the Persian Government. Although Ismail Khan at first was ready to make peace, hut unfortunate ly Muhammad Khan of Haiat Daud, who had come with his forces under instructions from Haidar Khan to assist him, seduced the latter with the help of Mr. Cox, and his own co-operation. He ignored our peaceful measures and sincere efforts and refused to make peace. The poor tool has been won over by the force of the rifles and ammunition of the Dritish. VY e did not at all lose any opportunity to effect peace, but to our regret it had no effect and we have now arrived at Borasjun in despair. The Ghazanfarr-us-Sultaneh showed due hospitality to us. It is necessary for us to bring to the notice of the Government authoiities what we have learnt of the “ philosophy ” of this dispute. It is our conviction frpm^ the outward and inward signs of the fighiing that Haidar Khan and Ismail Khan have no other object than the furtherance ol the objects of the foieigners in the South. And if (jhazanfar-us^Sultaneh and Agha Khan fall in with them in ffieir policy of worshiping foreigners, they wi4 not spare tueii assistance.25 Further, Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneb, Agha Khan and other Khans of Bashti and Dashtistan are most willingly ready to afford them (Ismail K an and his friends) any assistance. A , This is the history of our visit and the result of our trouble and our impartial investigation. Of course the Government authorities are alive to their duties and aware of the facts of this plan. Verily this is the true story. (Sd.)

Enclosure No. 5. Telegram. Extract from the “ TazianeE\ No. 35, dated the 9th Ramzan 1333 (22nd July 1915). His Royal Highness Ain-ud-Datjleh, Tehran. Your esteemed telegram addressed to the Khans, Zair Khidhar Khan and Shaikh Hussain Khan of Chahkutah has been received and caused great astonishment and regret; because now that God Almighty has granted us an opportunity to restore the honour and former losses of Persia, the authorities holding the reins of Government have sat still with folded hands ; not only have they not taken any action to improve the state of affairs, but they are deceiving tbe nation with phrases such as the necessary steps and are secretely aiding the enemies of our country. Every patriot will interpret such telegrams only as partiality towards the enemies of religion and our home, and against the feelings of the nation. Such a meaning for the word “neutrality” has not been found in any dictionary. Eor several years past the north and south of our country have been occupied by the troops of our enemies and they have taken all kinds of steps in this crisis to crush our independence. Do we consider ourselves still independent, and able to give orders for neutrality or intervention ? The wise of the nation have understood very well that if the Government authorities were able or willing to preserve their honour, they would have shown signs of this during the last 12 or 13 months, especially when our guests were robbed. It has been clearly visible that the traitors and followers of the enemies of this country have always been the object of kindness; but a community which has united in order to maintain the honour of their Government and nation have been misrepresented as (disturbers of peace) and their action as an historical disgrace. We inform you plainly that the duty of the nation is first to obey the religious leaders, and we also, in accordance with the decrees of the Proofs of Islam and the leadership of our leaders, have prepared ourselves for jehad with a view to removing the aggressions and high-handedness of the English at Rushire and the traitors to the country. Our object is, firstly, the expulsion of the British troops and, secondly, the restoration of the Germans. Nobody has any right to restrain us in our objects, and we consider those who obstruct us as apostates from the religion. The Government authorities, who follow the same religion as we do, should support us according to wisdom and the laws of Shara ! If in reality26 the opinion of the Government is constitutionally against the feelines of the nation, they should warn ns distinctly so that we^may know that we a re under the enemies of our country, and that we may fully fulfil our duties .

Editorial Note by the “ Tazianeh”. . Th e re is the flame of the fire at Bushire, and here is this terrible epidemic on this side. Has not yet the time arrived when the Governor- General should look to his duties ? Was it not possible for you (the Governor- General) to send such experienced respected personages whose words bear effect and who have been imprisoned here, as the aged and famous Sardar (General) Darya Begi born for such a purpose so that at least he might follow up the effects of the mission from Kazerun, with a view to nuttino 1 out this wide-spreading fire ?. v » Enclosure No. 6. COMMUNIQUE OE THE VOLUNTEERS. At a time when the organisations of the forces of the volunteers were not completed, a party of 100 men in their ardent desire, without the permission of the Commanding Officer, had voluntarily attacked Sabzabad on the afternoon of the 30th Sha’aban (14th July) and reached the door of the latter place and the wails of Tangak in an attack. Although there was constant firing from the ship and the land trenches, they had no casualties and they gallantly killed two British officers and 12 Indian sepoys who had come out and carried off their arms. W 7 hile they were engaged in ousting the Indian sepoys from the trenches, the news reached the headquarters. As this trivial action was not with the approval of the Commandant, a sowar was sent with orders calling them back. They were very offended and thought that if they had been allowed to continue their operations for another two hours, they would have occupied Sabzabad and Tangak. It is a matter for surprise that, when even the small party had departed hack to Gurak 4 hours after sunset on the night of the 1st Ramzan (13th July), the English were constantly firing from the ship and land up to 4 hours after sunrise on the following day, the 1st Ramzan. Strange to say, the English were all in an anxious mood, because according to local news from Bushire one shell from the ship had struck the Telegraph Office and another one Sabzabad, the Consulate, demolishing two pillars in the Telegraph buildings and a part of the stairs in the Consulate. These acts are evidently the outcome of their careless measures resulting from their des peration. (A small attack without the information of the headquarters.) Notice placarded in Bushire about 26th July 1915.65 No. 1440, dated Bushire, the 9th (received 16th) August 1915. From-MAios A. P. Tbivoe, C.I.E., Officer on Special Duty in the Persian Gui£ Residency, Bushire (in the absence of the Resident), iJq The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. In continuation and amplification of my telegram, 398 0., dated 8th August 1915 I have the honour to report, for the information or the (govern ment of India, that the occupation of Bushire town was successfully carried out at daylight yesterday by the 11th Rajputs under the command o± Lieuten ant-Colonef D. G. Stuart. The arrangements were made by the Officer Commanding Tooops, Bushire, Lieutenant-Colonel H. P. Lane, after consulta tion withtheSenior Naval Officer and myself. The 11th Rajputs marched off from Bushire at 3-15 A.M., and reached the south end of the town at 5 A m. Here the regiment divided* and parties were sent to the Customs, Governor’s house, barracks and Gendarmerie barracks. All these points were occupied without opposition. There was a slight hitch in the Gendarmerie barracks, as the officer begged for permission to go and get the Governor’s orders. He arrived at the Governor’s house when I was there, interviewing His Excellency about the occupation of Bushire, so X arranged with the Governor that he should tell the officer to vacate at once and leave for Borasjun with his men as had been suggested to him. The officer duly received these instructions and, after his return to town, vacated the barracks and marched off witli his men to Mngam, on the Shiraz road at the Mashileh. There he picked up the men, who had been in the Tower at Mngam and who had been turned out of the Tower at daylight by the Officer Commanding outposts, and the whole party left for Borasjun. When the party which occupied the Governor’s house was searching the place, 148 rifles (Mausers, Martinis, Ross, &amp;c.) were found and 102 boxes of ammunition. The British flag was hoisted at the Custom House, the Governor’s house and the Turkish Consulate. The hoisting of the British flag on the large Persian flagstaff at the back of the town near the old Government House had to be deferred as there were no halyards and the other rigging was rotten; steps are being taken to rectify this. H. M. S. “ Halhousie ” came into the inner anchorage after dark on the evening of the 7th instant and lay off the town; on the morning of the 8th a party was sent to seize the Customs Gunboat “ Muzaffar”, and the two armed/ launches “ Azerbaijan ” and “ Mazandaran ’ ? . This was succesf ally carried out, the second launch is useless at present having had her engines taken out, ; The Persian Telegraph Office was at first occupied and then dismantled and a guard put over the Persian Post Office. A guard was at first put on the Turkish Consulate, but afterwards the few records there are, were sealed up and the guard withdrawn. According to previous arrangement I called on His Excellency the Gov^ ernor at 6-30 a. m. the earliest hour which I should be likely to find him up, and informed him of what His Majesty’s Government had decided and told | him that Bushire had been taken over by that time. It was a complete surprise to him (as to everybody else) as I had arranged that the regiment should on its way to town take over the country telephone exchange to | prevent people in town communicating the news to the Governor or others outside. The exchange in town was also occupied directly the regiment arrived there. His Excellency was very bitter and pointed out to me (as I knew before) that his friendly attitude towards us had brought him into such bad odour with the Persian Government, the Governor-General of Ears and the people generally that he dare not go to his house in Shiraz, and asked what he should do. I replied that there were tw^o alternatives; one was for His Excellency to go to Bunder Abbas or Lingah and carry out the Government of the Remainder ot the Gull Ports from there, and the other was to go to Xndi^ OfEurope on leave. His Excellency replied that as I was aware he had not received any pay for two months, nor had his staff. I answered that this could probably be arranged. He then said that he could not make any move without telegraphing to the Persian Government as to do so would confirm them in the view which they would certainly take that the occupation had been a prearranged matter between himself and us. I accordingly agreed that he might telegraph to the Persian Government mentioning that possibly their suggestion would not be acceptable to us. I informed His Excellency that he might receive his friends, etc., at his country house, but that I regretted that it was impossible to permit him to go to town. At the close of the interview, when conducting me across the courtyard, His Excellency remarked “ my friends always told me that something of this sort would happen if I worked with the English, ,, and with this, a rather unpleasant interview terminated. X may say \ that I think that His Excellency exaggerated the amount of assistance he has j given to us, and that I do not trust him very much myself. Later in the day l His Excellency was further agitated by exaggerated reports of the rough treat ment given to his furniture and other property in the town house by the sepoys who occupied the place. Erom enquiries I have made, I think that the party was perhaps rough, quite unwittingly, through considering the place more as if it were a captured enemy stronghold instead of merely the house of a Governor of a friendly (?) being temporarily occupied. Later in the morning Monsieur Bourgeois came in to town and called upon me. He agreed to carry on the work and has since got practically all the staff to sign an agreement to serve us. He is behaving in a very satisfac tory manner and giving every assistance. All he asked was that if he got into any difficulties with the Persian Government, we would recommend him for the Chinese Maritime Customs. I replied that I could not make any promises as to whether the Government would be able to recommend him to the Chinese Maritime Customs Department or whether the latter would con sider him a suitable man, but I thought it possible that if he worked well here, something could be done for him in that direction. Early in the morning of the 8th I issued a brief proclamation based on Foreign Department telegram No. 680, dated 17th July, giving the reasons for the occupation of Bushire; and subsequently notices prohibiting people going about armed, and indiscriminate firing either by day or night, etc. I have arranged that Ahdur Basul, who was previously Kalantar of Bushire in the Darya Begi’s days, will again act as Kalantar from the 1st of next (Muhammadan) month. Hp to the time of writing everything has been quite quiet and as far as can he seen at present there is reason to hope that the place will remain quiet. 66 Telegram, No. 866, dated the 18th (received) 19th August 1915.

Reference to Foreign Office telegram 214 to Af Minister at Teheran. In view of the palpable weakness of the Persian Government, to ask them to remove and intern all German agents in Shiraz and the whole district extending to the sea coast, is probably to ask an impossibility. We think considerable political capital might be made out of nominal restoration of Persian authority at Bushire, and that we might agree to allow Persian flag to be re-hoisted there as soon as (1) Governor- General of Pars has been recalled and Kawam appointed in his place either as acting or permanent Governor-General. (2) A Governor whom we approve has keen appointed to the Gulf ports (3) Definite gendarmerie or other forces have been delegated by Persian Government to Shiraz, Ispahan, and Kerman for special protection of our Consulates against German intrigue, and such other efforts as are possible are promised by Persian Government to counter German agents. These terms might possibly be acceptable to the Persian Government and are such as they can carry out. The punishment of K A bans might stand over for the present, and this would be easier for the Persian Government to effect when public opinion had been placated by nominal restoration of Bushire. Our de facto position would be unaltered, as our troops would remain at present in practical occupation. As regards indemnity, we should maintain our claim and we can, if necessary, take it from Bushire revenues when we like. We put forward these constructive proposals as sequel to destructive . criticism contained in our telegram of 6th September.[This Document Is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with unless required for official use.] PERSIA .

A. and I have constantly had in mind the im portance which Indian and Afghan considerations possess in the Persian problem., and our proposals were passed entirely with a view to hold up the situation here* I readily admit there is no small element of chance in volved in proposals, but I entirely fail to see how the policy of drift, which Government of India advocate can meet the difficulty. The Germans are strengthening their position here every day, and could even now by the same methods as those employed at Ispahan render our position untenable It is therefore not a question of drifting, out of how long the Germans will hold their hand, and we can scarcely hope that the Germans will wait for some signal success, such as the forcing of the Dardanelles, to alter the position. The capture of Bagdad would in my opinion be much more to the purpose. i There is an alternative to them and open to us, but it appears to me to labour under the same disad vantages as the policy of drift. That course would be to inform the Persian .Government that we are ready to givegive them the support which they are always hinting at, viz: money and arms, in other words to confess to sur render and allow ourselves to he mercilessly 'black mailed c In return we should ask the Government to close the Mejliss, suppress hostile newspapers etc* and at the first sign of such action the Germans would strike (groups unde cypher able) * As a matter of fact the only element of the present situation in our favour is that the Persian Government will go to considerable length to prevent the two Legations from leaving• Even this re luctance 031 their part the Germans are endeavouring to overcome and two inopportune events have just occurred which are calculated to assist them as they will give the Germans further grounds for inflaming Persian opinion against us© The first is the landing of a LussicJi Regiment to-day at Enzeli, a icrce insufficient to in spire respect, but its appearance is provocative© second is the intention to deport the Turkish Consul General at Resht, ’out Russian Minister says that he will endeavour to get orders sent from the Caucasus. The Government consider that our proposal involves playing Germany’s game; we on the contrary see the game is already in Germany's hand, and we believe that the course we suggest, by utilizing the only element of the situation that tells in our favour, and at the some time promising financial assistance and other inducements, offers a chance of pulling the chestnuts out of the fire The chance is but a small one for in spite of half hintefrom Persian Government that they would at a price be come our allies I can scarcely believe that when the moment comes, so flabby a Minister as Mustaufi would find i courage to put his name to a declaration of war against Germany to say nothing of Turkey, The disposition of the Persian Government towards us at present may be judged by the fact that I have just received a verbal message from. Minister for Foreign Affairs (that) Persian Government reject our proposal to settle the Bushire i: I puestion and insist on hoisting of Persian flag prior to j the recall of the Governor General of Pars. If, however, the two Governments decide against our proposal I submit that rather than adopt a policy of drift, and an ever (?)ing drift we should at least try to induce the Persian Government by giving them assistance in money and arms which they ask for. This will Oi. course involve sooner or later settlement of the Bushire question on Persian terms but on the other hand it of fers a slight chance of inducing Persian Government not tacitly to encourage pro-German feeling in the country. It may, however, just as well have the contrary effect as it will show Persia we are wholly dependent on their goodwill. (?Group undecypherable) unfortunately the induce ment will have to be large but it is necessarily limited by the power of the Imperial Bank of Persia to make the advance. It must also be made imediately and without waiting for the assent of the Russian Government. Addressed to Foreign Office.

With reference to my telegram No. 67 of 19th instant reporting the murder on the night of 18th/l9th of the late M. Von Kaver, Manager at Ispahan of the Russian Banque dec Frets and recently appointed Russian Vice-Consul at Qumishell and my subsequent communications on this subject, I have now the honour to transmit a more detailed report which may perhaps he useful for future reference. This report - a mere statement of facts - has been drawn up under considerable difficulties in the intervals o.t constant pressing demands on my time and I must defer to another occasion the few comments which I would wish to make on it. ENCLOSURE IN ISPAHAN DESPATCH Mo. 49 of 22nd MY 1915. Report on murder of M. von kaver, Manager of the Russian Bank at Ispahan on 18th/L9th May 1915. About 12.30 a.m. on the ni#xt of 18th/l9th instant, I was wakened by the sound of firing close to and apparently due south of this Consulate-Osneral. This firing - at firsta rapid volley then shots at intervals ~ may have lasted three to five minutes. I made a note of the time intending to address observations to the local authorities* Nearly an hour later I was again wakened, this time by my servant calling to me that the Native Officer wished to report to me. The latter then informed me that a mounted Persian messenger had come some minutes before from the Bussian Consulate with a verbal message that I was urgently required there, the 'Heis - Bagh-i-Nou” - as M. Von Kaver was commonly termed by Persians - having been fired on and wounded. j s -^ I proceeded on foot with a guard of ten men and the Native Officer to the Bussian Consulate. Outside the entrance gate of the British Consulate I * found two of M. Von Kaver’s mounted men, one of whom after repeating his message to me said that he and his companion were going to the hospital for one Doctor. At the Russian Consulate, which I reached shortly before 2 a.rn. I found M. Von Kaver laid out on a sofa, his bead bearing several severe contusions. The upper part of his body had been bared. There was a clean mark of a bullet wound in the right breast and a jagged wound under the left arm pit which I subsequently understood to mark the exit of the bullet. Madame Hildebrandt, who told me that he had not spoken since he had been brought in an hour previously, was * ' endeavouringendeavouring to restore him to consciousness under the impression that he was in a prolonged fainting fit. This illusion I at first shared but even before the arrival of the Doctors I had recognised that life was extinct. M, Hildebrandt informed me that he had at once sent round to the G-overaor demanding H.E*s presence at the Con sulate but the Sardar had not come and he understood vvas afraid to do so. M. Hildebrandt and I sent round a note in our joint names to enquire after M, Paquet 1 s condition and got a reply to the effect that he had received only a few scratches and bruises but was much upset. Owing to the stupidity of the messengers sent to the Hospital, it was nearly 3.30 a.m, before the Doctors - Miss Ironside and Mrs. Linton (Dr. Schaffter had been urgently summoned to Kashan a few days before) arrived and at once pronounced M. Mon Kaver dead, adding tnat in tneir opinion death must have been almost instantaneous. While we were waiting for the arrival of tne Doctors M. Hildebrandt requested me to listen to the statement of M, Yon Haver’s coachman, which at my suggestion was then taken down in writing, the deponent’s signature being witnessed by us both. ItIt was to the effect that the party left the Russian Consulate about midnight, M. Paquet sitting on the right side of the carriage, M. Von Raver on the left. The doors of the Darvaze-i-Doulat, a large gateway leading into the Chahar Bagh (the principal avenue of the town) V7ere - as usual at night - closed. The watchman on duty opened them. The carriage and outriders passed quickly through. When it had gone some five or six yards clear of the gateway, a volley of shots was fired on the party by a band of men from the right of the roadway. Both M, Von Raver and M. Paquet poked the coachman in the back and called to him to gallop on. This he did. A little further on M. Paquet threw himself out on the right, M, Von Raver on the left. The former ran towards the 'Maliyeh” premises (situated a little furtxier down the Chahar Bagla on the right i.e. west) shouting to the gendarmes on guard there for help. m. Von tvrtv^ lay in the road. Some of the maliyeh gendarmes came up and with the coachman went towards M. Von Xaver to pick him up. A voice cried out 'Don't come near or I fire'. In spite of this they lifted M. Von Kaver up into the carriage where two gendarmes held him up. The coacnman got on tne box and the party returned to the Russian Consulate. I suggested to M. Hildebrandt that the evidence of the sowarssdff&amp;re (M, Von Kaver*^ dvn men) escorting the carriage - three as I understood, should also be taken down in writing and was subsequently told that this had been done and that their statements confirmed those of the coachman but I have not thought it necessary to ask M. Hildebrandt to allow me to peruse these. It was after 4 a.m. when M. Hildebrandt and I sat down to draft, he in Russian, I in French, the telegra/ms, the English renderings of which formed my telegrams No, 67 and 68 of 19th instant, reporting the incident. I left the Russian Consulate about 5*30 a.m, gave some necessary orders here and rode up to Julfa with an eB^oru of four men, calling en route at the house of fir. Vice-Consul Worrall whom I instructed to go to the Consulate at ms earliest convenience and issue on my behalf a notice to British subjects informing them of the murder of «. *on Kaver and advising them not to go about except on urgent business and more particularly to refrain from uoin^ ^o after sunset. This notice tfas sent out before 8 a.rc. At Julfa I handed in my collea^ie'e and my c*m telegrams shortly after 6 a.m. informed the Officer in Charge of mie incident and paid a brief visit to the Annenian Archiman drite for the same object. I deprecated any pessimisticview of the situation and urged him to use his influence to prevent a panic amon^ his flock. Before leaving Julfa, I despatched two of my sowars to Farahabad (some two miles distant) where Dr. Aganoor now c resides with a note informing him of the situation and requesting his presence at the Consulate, the sowars to escort him into town. On my Way back I called (about 7.45 a # m.) on M. Paquet to enquire after his condition. I found him with both hands \T bound up and in a nervous condition but sufficiently self-possessed to give me a quite clear and coherent version of the incident. He said that dining at the Russian Consulate, he had sent away his carriage and intending to walk back, had kept a gendarme (or two) with a lantern. (distance from the Russian Consulate to the Maliyeh is about one mile). M. Von Xaver offered to give him a lift in his carriage. This he accepted bidding his gendarme or gendarmes follow on foot. The doors of the w Darvaaeh” were open. He could not say whether they were opened for the carriage, ne did not perceive any one open them. They drove quickly througa and had only got a few yards beyond the gate when ne hearo. shots fired in rapid succession from tne rigno. Be ana KaverKaver called out to the coachman to gallop full speed* He saw a man standing a few yards to the right in the attitude of some one firing a revolver not that of a man shooting a rifle. There were shadows behind which may have been other wkkl men. One shot whizzed right across his breast so close that he believed himself hit. M, Von Kaver gave a faint 'Aah” and lurched over on to him covering him with blood and knocking him out of the carriage. He fell into the ditch at the roadside, picked himself up and rolled over again. He ran for his own house calling out for the gendarmes on guard there, stumbling, falling and rolling several times in the little plantation of young trees which here borders the roadway. Some gendarmes came running up with a lantern towards the carriage. He got into his stable which faces on to the road and the entrance to which stood open. There he sank on to a heap of manure, oud sequently he sent for Captain G-leerup who passed the rest of tne night with him and called in the G-endarmerie Doctor to bandage his hands and attend to his shoulder which was severely bruised. M. Paquet added that on undressing he found that his watch, a large sum of money in notes and a draft to bearer had all disappeared, presumably lost during his flight. I returned to the Russian Consulate and informed my colleague of M. Paquet’s version of the incident, calling* his particular attention to tHe discrepancy as regards the number of assailants and urging him to obtain Paquet* s state ment in writing as soon as he was in a condition to give it. W© then agreed on the terms of a note to be despatched to the G-ovemor-General reminding His Excellency of his responsibilities and informing him that, after a joint conversation on the wire with our Legations, we should call on him at an hour which we would ourselves xix. Our notes (in identical terms) were despatched about 11 a.m. Having been informed about 11.20 a.m. by telephone that both Ministers were ready at the Telegraph Of!ice, I advised my oolleague who shortly afterwards drove round here and together w e proceeded to the Telegraph Office in Julfa. It is unnecessary that I should here repeat or summarise the conversation which ensued on the wire he^een yourself and M. de Bach at the Tehran wad and and Mr M. Hildebrandt an - me at this end. Returning to this Consulate about 3 p.m. according to orevious agreement with M. Hildebrandt, I addressed a note to the Governor-General informing His Excellency that we would call on him an hour before sunset, read tne reply Governor-General to our joint note of the morning, sent a circularcircular to British subjects notifying them that there would be a funeral service at the Russian Consulate at 5 p.m. and drew up a brief memorandum on the points to be put to the G-overnor-G-enera] in the course of our interview. While awaiting the arrival of the priests from Julfa, M. Hildebrandt caused his Munshi to read over to me certain information furnished to him tending to confirm our sus- picioos that the murderer or murderers were connected with the German Agents. (Translation attached) Just as service was about to begin a verbal message was brought from the Governor General to say that our visit must be deferred as he was detained at the Persian Telegraph Office in conver sation with the Prime Minister and Cabinet. With my collea- gue’s assent, I sent back word to say that having nooifieo. H.E. of our intention to call on him at 6 p.m. we &gt;T&gt;u!d do so and, if necessary, await his return at the 'Hukoomat , the communications of our Legations being as important for H.E, as those from his own Government* Arriving at the Governor’s punctually at 6 p.m. we ere kept waiting for a few minutes before His Excellency re aimed. He expressed his great regret for the loss of a personal and highly esteemed friend as well as his official condo lences on the sad incident. In a rather aggrieved tone he continued that it would have oeen more suitaol... i - nad •nerrn tt«dpermitted him to finish his conversation on the wire with H.E. Ain-ed-Dowleh as he would then have been in a better position to inform us what instructions he had received from his Government* He then indulged in a somewhat lengthy eulogy of his own strenuous efforts to support our interests and stem the strong current of animosity towards us which existed amongst all classes etc* etc* etc* My colleague made little pretence of concealing his impatience but I allowed His Excellency to finish his phrases and then said we had to come in the first place to repeat verbally the warning contained in our note of the morning, secondly as the result of our conversation with our Legations to put certain questions to H*E. whose answers we would telegraph. I then enquired :« (1) Whether immediately after the murder of M. Von Kaver in the vicinity of the house occupied hy Geman subjects, or since, any search had been ordered hy H.E. or made by any Persian officials on those premises. His Excellency answered quite briefly in the negative. (2) Had the instructions received by H.E. on 12ta day - as I had learned on 15th May from a conversation viU: the Deputy- Governor - for the removal of the German •nreless apparatusapparatus been carried out yet, or was that apparatus still standing ? His Excellency tangles himself up in lengthy explana tions . He had been in correspondence with the German Consul with the Persian Government etc* etc* When H.E. had nearly exhausted the patience of my colleague, I said I merely wanted a simple answer to the question put by my Legation* H.E, then replied in the negative. ( 3 ) Was H.E. prepared and able to compel the German Agents to dismiss all their dependents and impose on them a Bakhtiari guard who would receive no pSLy except from H.E. and whose duty it would be not only to protect the Germans but to exercise a surveillance over them ? The Sardar - rather to my surprise - replied that he was both ready and able to cause the Germans to disarm their followers and to provide such a guard for them as I had indicated. He hastened to add that he must have instructions from his Government to that effect. I then translated to H.E. almost word for word your warning communioated to me in our conversation on the line H.E. said he fully acknowledged that both Legations had assisted him to the Governorship of Ispahan. Ho had not realised what troubles that office entailed; not even 1 , strongly urged to do so would he-remain.

Paquet, sitting behind the coachman, should not have seen the watchman, who is usually posted in a shop close to the doorway, open the gate, as he is stated by the coachman to have lone. NUMBER OF THE ASSAILANTS. The coachman's statement clearly indicated that there were several 1. Paquet-s account to me that he only saw one. The discrepancy is, under the circumstances, not surprising. Monsieur Hildebrandt informed me that, standing on the balcony of the Russian Consulate with Madame Hildebrandt at the time when the shots were being fired, they counted 18. I heard the shots but did not count them. At a guess I should have said there were about a dozen. My Native officer who heard them gives it as his opinion that they were fired by more than one man. I understand that empty cases both ox Mauser oistol cartridges and of rifle cartridges were picked up on or near the spot. 2. The ners The fact that fire was opened on the carriage from a spot just in front of the stable door of the German 'Consulate' (so called) and close to a side entrance on the Chahar Bagh leading to the grounds of that building tends to incriminate the dependents'1 Referred to the Secretary, Political and Secret Department, 6th September 191 5 I put up for information a copy of a telegram received to-day from the Acting Director at Teheran.

Sir, No. 1. 06 Mir. Marling to Sir Edward Grey. —(Received July • p ? ' attitude of tlie 1 ersian Prime Minister towards the two legations, almost V u t u d } 16 t 00 ^ extremel y perplexing. Yon will remember that nes s Professed to M. de Etter and myself, when we called on him on the Idtn xvlay, iMlo, the greatest readiness to pursue a policy, the main principle of which was to be the maintenance of the neutrality of Persia, and the counteracting of the u-erman enorts to embroil this country in war, while we on our side promised to endeavoui to obtain some financial support for his adminstration from our Governments, and that in conclusion Ain-ed-Dowleh suggested that he be content to work on what I may call a system of payments by results, i.e., that when he had achieved something towards those ends, we would do something to strengthen his position. I said at the time that I had already to thank him for his successful efforts to tide over the bank crisis, and that on the principle he suggested I thought that I could arrange that the Imperial Bank of Persia should make to the Persian Government an advance of 40,000 tomans, the sum mentioned by himself, and, as a matter of fact, Mr. A. O. Wood at once agreed to effect the transaction provided it was put into a business form. On various pretexts, mostly connected with Mr. Wood’s very reasonable requirements as to form, which Ain-ed-Dowleh however represented as showing an unfriendy spirit on the part of the bank and the legation, his Highness did not actually draw on the credit opened for the Government to this amount until the end of June, and, in fact, showed just as much reluctance to take advantage of the assistance tendered as he did in the matter of furnishing to the Russian Minister and myself the data necessary to enable us to submit to our respective Governments a proposal to give Persia some financial support to enable her to tide over the financial embarrassment created by the war (see my telegram No. 199 of 13th June last). His Highness’s behaviour to the Russian Legation was equally remarkable. M. de Etter had repeatedly told him that in such questions as the collection of the maliat by the Russian consuls, the acquisition of real property by Russian subjects, &amp;c., he was ready to find a solution of a nature to satisfy Persian feeling, but in no single instance has Ain-ed-Dowleh ever shown the smallest sign of readiness to discuss these matters, which have so long been a Peisian ened his position. In fact, Ain-ed-Dowleh has refused or delayed accepting everything offered to him; and has consistently demanded one thing, and that the one w nc M. de Etter and I are convinced that we could not accord, and whic , moreover, other Persian Ministers have plainly hinted must in no circumstances be accorded, namely, the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Kazym and Resht 1 will even o , further, and say that Ain-ed-Dowleh would be dismayed if he thought that his request would be fulfilled. . , p Nor until quite recently can I find any particular reason oi co £&gt; assumed Ain-ed-Dowleh’s efforts to combat the German intrigue. eiy ® 0 ° 11 , TVhiVhber-es- office, he gave me a distinct promise, which he has never repu la e ’ . , • p e Sultaneh should be removed from the Governorship o ars, on y p Should be allowed to do it in his own way, but in spite of strong ~ is still a thorn in our side.

A weeUater diring bhich period M. do Etter has informed Am-ed-Dowleh that the Russian Government attach the greatest importance to the retention of the Farman Farma at the Ministry of the Interior, the Government again resigned, but the Shah declined to accept it' At this moment it seems a practical certainty that Am-ed-Dowle will continue in office without a reshuffle of portfolios, and that this course has been forced on him by two causes, firstly, that the Democratic Party s candidates, Mustaufi-ui-Mamalek or Mushir-ed-Dowleh, would not accept office, and, secondly, that he has good reason for believing that we are quite prepared to accept ami ran Farman Farma as a President of the Council if he himself should fail us. Fie has, however, suceeded in inducing Farman Farma to believe that he is, at least for the moment, sincere in the wish to retain him at the Ministry of the Interior, and I trust that Farman Farma will not find that he has been deceived. The foregoing would seem to show that Ain-ed-Dowleh has been a false friend, but, while it cannot be pretended that he has proved a really satisfactory instrument to carry out our aim of preserving the neutrality of Persia, I do not think that lie ha s actua lly played us false. His Highness’s position is far from enviable. He has, it is true, the confidence nominally of the whole Medjliss, but, as a matter of fact, he has no real party behind him. He is in no sense the leader of any group even, and he can count really only on the votes of some twenty to twenty-five Moderates, the remainder of the majority who supported the Cabinet on the 3rd instant being made up of small groups who are for the present disposed to think that the presence of Ain-ed-Dowleh at the head of the Government offers the fewest disadvantages. Their support is very precarious, and neither they nor the Moderates have any cohesion or organisation eitiei m die Chamber or in the country, and there are few men of any ability m their ramvs Am-e^-Dowleh is thus merely a leading Persian statesman selected by the ritish and Russian Legations on account of his long experience and of the weight + u S n T: T' n T as tlle m0St su i table man t0 steer Ibe ship of the Persian State stoim, and it is as such that he is supported by the Moderates ablt en al P Tb , gI '°?

In short, he has tried to persuade the Democrats, by neither receiving favours from us nor making concessions to us, that ne is no partisan or tool of Russia and Great Britain. As I suggested in the first sentence of this report, Ain-ed-Dowleh’s conduct has been a constant puzzle us, _ and usually an unsatisfactory puzzle, but, with the certainty that any anconsidere-a action on 0111 pait might bring about his oft-threatened resignation and the formation of a still less satisfactory Cabinet, the Russian Minister and I have thought it better not to press his Highness too far for fear of disturbing his nicely poised equilibnum, and I am by no means sure also that Am-ed-Dowleh has not endeavoured, always with an eye to placating the Democrats, to “squeeze” us, if I may be permitted the expression, under the impression, of which I have often endeavoured to disabuse him, that the neutrality of Persia is of more value to us than to herself. However this may be, even Ain-ed-Dowleh himself has been, as it seems to me, at last brought to see that his indecision in deference to the Germanophile Democrats was bringing the country dangerously near the verge of disaster, and that something more than remonstrance, however energetic, to Prince Renss were necessary. At all events, during the last ten days he has used such insistence that the German Legation has consented to recall Wassmuss, in return, it is true, for the recognition by the Persian Government, hitherto refused, of a German vice-consul at Shiraz, and has issued stringent orders to the Governors of Kirman and Birjand to hold up and send back to Tehran the German emissaries who are on their way to those places, orders which, so long as Harman Farma remains at the Ministry of the Interior, Sardar-i-Zafar and Shaukat-ul-Mulk, who are well-disposed to us, can be stimulated into carrying out. Ain-ed-Dowleh has even gone further, and has actually caused a German agent proceeding to Meshed to be stopped by the Governor of Damghan, his followers disarmed and himself sent back to Tehran. A general instruction has also been issued to the Governors of the provinces to disarm the armed retainers of all consuls except, of course, the Cossack guards of the Russian consuls and our Indian escorts— and in particular the numerous Mujahids recruited by the Germans at Ispahan, for which purpose some 500 gendarmes have been already drafted to that town and a further 300 are to be sent. . . I cannot say how long this display of energy will continue ; it may only be a readjustment of the scale that has been too long weighed down on the German- Democrat side ; but whatever its motives, unless we are prepared to adopt the direct methods of the Indian Government as described m their telegram No. 618 the 1st July, we have no alternative but to endeavour to see that this new vigour maintained. p have&gt; &amp;c .

British Residency and Consulate General. Bushire, 12th July 1915. Sir, In continuation and in amplification of the various telegrams I have from time despatched to Your Excellency regarding the situation in the Bushire hinterland I have the honour to submit the following report» On the 4th instant news was received that We,ssmuss, who had previq^ly being staying at Shamshiri or Abram, had come to Pakashi, a village near Gurak some 15 or 16 miles from the country Residency at Subzabad, across the 'Mashilleh* or swampy ground dividing Bushire Island from the mainland. He was accompanied by Zair Khidhar Ox Tangistan, Rais All of Dilwar and Shaikh Husain of Chahkuhtah and some petty Khedkhudas of Dashti. Fortunate ly I had been able to checkmate Wassmuss* efforts x.o get the Dashti Khans over to his side by the despatch q± an emissary who was a relative of the principal Dashti Khans ;hd who was able to dissuade them xiom joining Wa-kj^i^uss* Che absention of the Dashti Khans, and of Ghazanfar-us- Sultaneh, Khan of Borasjun (owing to the fact that was busy righting with Ismail Khan of Shabankareh and consequently ;ould not supply a contingent) resulted in the number of nen with Wassmuss and his confederates being very email - ap to the present time not more than 300 according to the oest reports. However on their arrival the confederates Lost no time in spreading through their sympathisers false reports in Bushire regarding their numbers etc. and t in+.ent.inn of making an immediate attack etc. ToTo meet any attack by tribesmen which has always been a possibility j.or tne last .tew months, the Regiment stationed nere (96th Bera.r Infantry) has, as you are aware, occupied a line of outposts along the M Mashilleh w on the east and across the M Island w just South of the Subsabad Residency* Latterly, when the pronouncements of the confederates about attacking became more insistent, the line has been considerably strengthened by building small (loose) stone towers which have been surrounded by wire entanglements like the original posts. Two field guns captured from the Turks have also been placed in position on the outpost i line. The position has thus been made fairly secure the ! principal weakness being that the line is really rather j too long for the number of men at the disposal of the Officer Commanding, and the consequent possibility of small I parties breaking through to the danger of the occupants j of the various houses dotted about all over the island. For various reasons it is not possible to take a shorter ; or indeed any other outpost line. About the 6th instant the confederate Khans sent an ultimatum to the Governor and all Persian Military officers in Bushire. I attach a copy of it. Tne document is written in the handwriting of the Munshi of Saiyiu Murteza Ahrarai, the firebrand who organized the Tengistani raid on Bushire in 1909, and is signed by certain Khans. It is noteworthy that Zsir Khidhar did not use his ora inary seal or sign with his own hand evidently with a ''lew to being able to repudiate the document later if necessary. The document is exceedingly ±**i**t insolent in tone, t. it cannot be denied that things have come to a serious pass when a few petty brigand chiefs can flout the officers of the Persian Government in such a manner without .a. t Government making the slightest eu_oit to suppreo^ unem * The result of the supine attitude of the Persian Government is that the confederate Khans openly boast that theare uovc.: 10 f-General of Pars and the Persian Government behind them and they have nothing to fear. The result of the blustering attitude adopted by the con^ederaoe Khcins and the false rumours spread everywhere by their partisans was that a strong rumour was current both at Bushire and Borasjun that Bushire would be attacked On j.ie nignt oi the 9th instant. C^uite a panic among the Persians on the Island resulted; hundreds of people living outside went into the town, and many others both in and out of the town buried their valuables etc**and enormous numbers were put to great inconvenience and expense. It is almost unnecessary to add that a great deal of trouble and hard work has been given to the Regiment and a good deal of expense to the Government of India. The whole of this is fylX/ due to the intrigues of Wassmuss assisted by the confederate Khans, and it is by no means certain that more trouble will not be caused before we have finished with them. It appears impossible to get anything done to Wassmuss, but I venture to urge that Your Excellency will be good enough to notify the Persian Government about the attitude of the confederate Khans and the nature of their ultimatum and press that immediate orders should be sent to them to disband their forces and ! return to their homes. The Persian Government might also be requested to remove each of the signatories of the ultimatum from their Khanates, and possibly be warned, if Your Excellency sees no objection, that if the Khans are not removed we shall ourselves have to effect their removal on a suitable occasion arising, as it is obvious there can be no peace or security in these parts as long as such truculent swashbucklers remain Khans* / The name of Ghazanfar-us-Sultaneh might, I submit, be adued to those on the ultimatum as he is as bed as, or worse than, any of themthem and would certainly have signed, if he had not teen otherwise engaged* I have the honour to he, Sir, Your Excellency’s most obedient, humble servant, Sd/~ A,P.

All the people of Bushire and the suburbs , who are under Islam and who are the followers of Islam, are warned that as the highhanded and oppressive actions of the British in this frontier of Islam are daily increasing, and as however much we have waited that perhaps these actions would be removed by the everlasting Government, we have seen no result, we the people of Dashti, Tangistan, Chahkutah and Dashtistan, in view of the decrees of the Proofs of Islam, who have specified Jahad and Defence as the duty of every Muslim, have become ready, both as regards our lives and out properties, to defend ourselves, and ore now ready in the neighbourhood of Bushire all our forces. Vile have felt it necessary to inform the people of Bushire, who were expecting such a day, that in frying out this action \ e undertake, according to this ultimatum, not inflict a single dinar loss on Muslims and non-Muslims, whether Persian subjects or not, who are not military, and have beer c&lt; rry- any ing on trade, and are in favour of liberty. If/losses are inflicted, we will redress them doubly.

In fact, if it is true I must in the first place Ksattjsxi complain against Faqih Muhammad doing ax-.h a thing end trying to turn you against the Muhammadan religion so that you would become an apostate for ever; for they wanted to give me much money, but I would not desert my brothers in religion and turn my face against the religion oj. Islam, end I would not consent to this historical disgrace. Ly friends also should follow the same path, and not cause me to be ashamed before the people of Tangistan and other places. But 1 do not believe that you will agree with Faqih Muhammad's ideas, and sit at home and watch us fighting. I would never believe this; and you should not take such action as may cause the people of Tangistan and Dashti to criticise me. You should convince Faqih Muhamad so that he may depart, and they may give up this idea.

If you go over to the unbelievers you will lose your good name, and you will feel ashamed in the presence of the Prophet of God, I request that you will be good enough to write to me your intention distinctly; give back the unclean money which Faqih Muhammad has promised or brought to him so that you may not be ashamed in the presence of God and the Prophet, and not leave your brothers in religion iw lurch.

Sir, In continuation of ray despatch No. 262 of today’s date, I have the honour to forward herewith a proclamation recently issued by Shaikh Hussein, which has just come to ray notice. It is an annoying document, and taking into consideration that Shaikh Hussein is only a petty Khan of a small tract of worthless country one day’s march out of Bushire, one can only imagine that he has taken leave of his senses. The 1st and 7th items are interesting; the former seems to show the souree of inspiration of the document and the latter the origin of the gathering tribesmen. It is of course well known that Wassmuss has spentjfLarge sums in 'backshish' to the Khans in order to try and bring them and their followers up to the scratch; the 7th article admits this, the 'Proof of Islam at Ahram' is Saiyid Murteza Ahrami the ignorant scoundrelly Mulla who brought in the Tangistanis to Bushire in 1909 and set himself up as a •Constitutional Governor'. His confidential raunshi wrote the ultimatum to the Persian Government officials at Bushire forwarded with my last despatch. Saiyid Murteza now-a-days appears to be employing his time in egging on. tribesmen one day and in writing to the Governor explaining how he is restraining them the next. I have, etc., Sd/- A. P.

Fundamental military rules which have been made in accordance with the exigencies of these parts. Firstly . A respected Grennan arrived in these frontiers of Persia, and was insulted and robbed and has now made complaint. Secondly . The English attacked Tangak where they committed murders and robberies and different outrages in these parts. Under the circumstances defence has become incumbent and we are ready to fi^it by the grace of the Imam of the age. Secondly, every one prompted by Muhammadan zeal and adherence to his tribe assists the jehad, he will be of the victorious party; and every one who joins for the sake of greed of riches, it will have no result or benefit for him.

Wassmuss left Borasjun on May 30th in the direction of Ahram. On 31st May he reached Ahmedi one stage from here where he still is. As a result no doubt of his intrigues Zair Khadar of Ahram, principal Khan of Tangistan, and Shaikh Hussain and the Khan of Borasjun are again giving out that they are about to attack Bushire. Shaikh Hussain has written to Kindail Khan of Shabancara to join and threatening him if he does* not. I think that it may be bluff, but it is necessary to be prepared. As gendarmerie are open(ly) with hostile faction (vide my telegram?,. 191 C., 80—528, 196 G. and numerous others from Shiraz and Bushire), it is most necessary to get tower (referred to in my telegrams,. 64—422 and 73 —470) handed over to Governor. In the event of attack I have no doubt gendarmes would either remain passive or more probably assist enemy. In either case it might easily become imperative (?) to turn them out by force, as the tower is an essential point in the scheme of defence of the Isthmus and could not be left in hostile hands. This would, of course, be most undesirable and a difficult operation during or in the intervals of an attack by tribesmen. 1 respectfully beg to urge, there fore, that Your Excellency will press Persian Government to withdraw gendarmerie from here at once. This would, I suppose, meet with less opposi tion from Commandant of Gendarmerie than simply handing the tower over. Addressed Tehran; repeated to Basrah, Shiraz and Eoreign.

Captain Pousette tells me that if adequate funds are not forthcoming by end of current Persian month, that is, by about 20th June, he has instructions to march. regiment to Tehran. I venture, therefore, to invite Your Excellency’s attention to this question of gendarmerie. ^ Their disappearance from Ears necessarily involves recrudescence of dis order, robbery and rahdari on main trade routes and province would rapffiiy revert to intolerable conditions of anarchy which existed three years ago. On the other hand, it is difficult for us to afford them further support so long as they show themselves hostile to our interests.

Total sum to be provided, which would not exceed £50,000, to be decided in consultation between Officer Commanding, Gendar- imerie, British Consul and Pinance Agent, Shiraz, Kazerun.

Wassmuss visited Ahmedi May 31st returning to Borasjun June 1st. According to reports received Wassmuss rigs up what appears to he a portable wireless telegraphy apparatus and receives war telegrams which he i serves out to tribesmen. As he only does this at out of the way places where people are unsophisticated, most probably apparatus is dummy and performance intended to give an air of truth to his fabrications. He is making lavish promises to help Khans to attack Bushire if they will assist him to attack Haidar Khan first.

Your Excellency can perhaps judge by now whether there is any likeli hood of Persia deliberately throwing in her lot with Germany and Turkey or not. If such an eventuality seems at all likely, I venture to express agree ment with Major Trevor’s view that the sooner the gendarmerie disappear the better and that we should do nothing further to support them. If, however, Persian participation in war is improbable or even uncertain, I venture to dissent strongly from Bushire point of view which appears to sne rather to take into account interests of Bushire itself than those of Ears and those of Southern Persia, as a whole. In spite of all their (insolvencies ?) and failings which I fully realise and admit, it cannot be denied that gendarmerie have preserved Southern Persia from anarchy during the last two years and have kept roads open for commerce, posts and travellers. Such situation is, I venture to think, infinitely more 'beneficial to our interests than a state of chaos which might compel us to intervene and which might involve us in serious embarrassments of many kinds. During the last few days I have been bringing very strong pressure to bear on Captain Pousette with regard to the question of neutrality, etc. He is beyond question sincerely anxious to correct faults of the gendarmerie, and has ffiven me repeated and earnest assurances to this effect. (Above.) fact combined with my general observation of the situation and personal experience convinces ml that the proposal I have outlined is one best suited to what I believe to he our interests, this is, maintenance of order in Southern Persia and prevention of necessity for intervention here.$1 s* 'V f kkt-^ $ if 0 ,. £ , x ^'' ' l ' ., But if Your Excellency and His Majesty’s Government do not approve further advance being made for the use of the gendarmerie, 1 shall try to formulate alternative proposals. ^ Addressed Tehran; repeated to Bushire and Basrah.

It was, therefore, necessary to decide at once; and it was difficult to differentiate between one tribe and another. In order to allow country to settle down and facilitate the forward movement if settled upon, I accordingly, in consultation with Sir P. Cox, tieeided that we should in principle assume the attitude of readiness to accept submissions generally, provided they appeared /kte in each case. I ant now in a position to be able to report that the Chief Sheikhs of all the tribes met with between Kurna and the neighbourhood of All Gharbi have made their submission in a formal manner. Starting from Kurna end, Beni Malik, who, until the Turks occupied their villages around the Kota position, had been in friendly relations with us,, came- in at once on our arrival and desired permission to be allowed to return to their homes. Above them on left bank of stream came Mahomet Bairam (?) Tessir (?) and on the right bank the A1 Bu Mahomet (?) Saibud. The Chief Political was visited by the Sheikhs of these sections who made' their formal submission. Above them came the head of the section of A1 Bu Mahomet represented by Araibi Pasha on Jahalah canal on the left bank and by Majid Al-Khalifa at Majar Al-Kabir canal on the right bank. They had been from the very first anxious for our arrival and were the first to tender their submission. Formal visits were paid by their Sheikhs and pending permanent arrangements by ourselves they were subsequently installed in charge of the late Government’s mudirates at their headquarters. On the right bank above them come the Azairij, above and below Amara with headquarters on Majar As-Saghir canal. Their Sheikhs were installed in same way as the last named. This brings us to the extensive tract occupied by Beni Lam above Amara and almost to Kut on the left bank. Ghazban, their principal Sheikh, has of course been the chief mainstay of the Turks in their incursions into Persia ; but immediately on our arrival Falin, his brother, wrote expressing his readiness to hand over to us two Turkish field guns which had fallen into their hands and also offering to submit. We, therefore, decided in spite of their previous hostility to regard the delivery of the guns as evidence of their bona Mes and provided Falin and Ghazban came in m person to offer it, agreed to accept their submission. This they did and written assurances were given to the effect that in the event of our moving forward they would if desired co-operate and would in any case guarantee^ that on the river within their sphere we would not meet with any tribal opposition. Only important tribe up to and beyond Ali Gharbi, apart from Beni Lam, is m Bu Lurraj. Their Sheikh also in person tendered his submission. As- far then as one can judge from tho above, no tribal opposition need be expected bv us up to Ali Gharbi or possibly up to Kut provided that at the latter place these tribes are not dominated by strong Turkish reinforcements. Many personal jealousies exist between the individual Sheikhs which have hpen fomented by the late Goyernmentj these tribal elements will hlrefere be difficult problem and will require careful handling The position or the present seems satisfactory. From outside, our t^sk will be facilitated FKut-aLAmara which is only a few miles outside conventional Yikyet (of) Wah can be brought within our present sphere of occupation, including, as- l would the starting point for all irrigation works m Basrah Vilayet from iWs Our hold on the tribes in future will depend mainly m no small Sure on the extent to which in direction (of) irrigation their agricultural nterests are promoted by us.

Erom what I haye been able to see of canals and riyer and land up to, and forty miles beyond, Amara, country, it is evident, is very fertile and has immense potentialities. Keystone of its prosperity in the future lies in con servancy and control oyer its waters and it appears that inteiests of His Majesty’s Government and of inhabitants demand the establishment of a system of irrigation which should be administered by most expert irrigation engineers that it is possible for Government of India to provide. Irrigation will he the chief means by which to bring in good revenue and to work out pacification of people, and its administration will mean contentment of tribes or the reverse. Destruction of ancient system of irrigation has resulted in enor mous waste, by leading off of waters by means of large canals which run into marshy areas in most uneconomical manner, or flood lands for a season or else leave them permanently stagnant. An examination of present conditions held by an expert of high water can alone show lines on which improvments are necessary and can be carried out not merely for irrigation purposes alone but also for safe navigation of the Tigris river. I therefore venture to urge that a highly qualified engineer should immediately be deputed here with a considerable staff, with the object of inspecting the country and reporting what should be done to lay the foundation of a Mesopotamian river conservancy and irrigation department.

Cox as follows: “ The following note protesting against our operations in Persian territory Has been received by me from the Persian Government. It could be left entirely unanswered, as it is only a proforma document, but if, as seems to be the case, we are no longer conducting operations on this side of frontier, I should be able to give reply to that effect to the Persian Government.” Cox has sent the following reply No. 1256 B., dated June 17th : Your telegram No. 197. I am desired by the Army Commander to suggest a reply somewhat on the following lines in so far as you consider it expedient. Until the Turkish troops from Amara invaded Arabistan unopposed with avowed purpose of inflicting injury on Great Britain by wrecking Anglo- Persian Oil Company’s pipe lines and attempting attack on British forces at Basrah in flank, not a soldier was landed by us in Persian territory. Persian Government were either unable or unwilling to take any steps whatever to repel this invasion of their territory and it was not until Turkish troops had been a fortnight in Persian territory and Nasiri itself had been threatened and British pipe line wrecked that Great Britain was compelled to despatch troops to repel enemies of Persia and save further damage to property of the Oil Company. As it is the destruction of the pipe line was brought about by the Turkish invasion and the Persian Government failed to take any measures to prevent it and consequently the oil industry has been at a standstill for four months thereby causing the Oil Company to lose many thousand pounds sterling. The bill for this will be presented in due course to the Persian Government as a]so for expenditure incurred iu maintaining British troops in Persia for the expulsion of the Turks and the protection of British property and lives. In the circumstances, it is astonishing that the Persian Govern ment should be surprised at the operations of British troops in their interests. As a matter of fact, a portion of the British force has already been withdrawn from Persian territory since the Turks have just been expelled beyond Persian frontiers and, untjl Persian Government has shown herself capable of assuring it herself, only such troops as may be necessary for safety of British life and property in Arabistan will now remain there. The Army Commander has repeated the above to Secretary of State and Ipdia. t?:—. Telegram P., No, 57, dated the 16th (received 17th) June 1915.

Wassmuss 1ms been very active lately, and is well supplied with funds. He has given large sums to four Confederate Khans and there is considerable competition among these gentlemen for honour (and profit) of putting him up. He has engaged five headmen of sowars and footmen at 50 tomans per month each and about 100 sowars at 18 tomans each and has offered Khans 18 tomans for each sowar and 12 tomans for each footman they can bring. Eur- ther he appears to have a considerable quantity of arms and ammunition which he is distributing. . talks Yer J big about being ready on June 26th and about German ships coming up the Gulf and he seems to be getting considerable following. Governor has recently replied to a telegram from the Minister of the Interior that only source of trouble in this district was Wassmuss and that, if the Persian Government could not get him recalled, there would most certainly be trouble and that British would have legitimate grounds for intervening. I venture to suggest that it might be advisable to inform Persian Govern ment that Wassmuss is using all means to stir up Khans to attack Bushire and seems likely to succeed ; and that, if Persian Government do not take immediate steps to get him recalled at once, we shall be compelled in our own interests to land men and guns, etc., to protect British lives and property.

Please refer to my telegram No. 1293 B., 23rd instant. His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran telegraphs as^ follows, 207 : 44 The activity of the Germans in the province is increasing. An endeavour is being made by (?) Wassmuss to organise an attack on Bushire by the local tribes, strengthened by men locally recruited. A party of German(s) and Austrian prisoners of war, who have escaped in some numbers from Trans-Caspia via Meshed, is starting for Birjand and Afghanistan. Another similar party under Greisinger and Zugmeyer is making for Kerman and Pugin is leaving for Meshed. “ Thanks largely to the Germans at Ispahan; the murderer of the Manager of the Russian bank is still at large and the only satisfaction which the Russia (ns) have obtained for the outrage is exchange of (?) Sardar Motashem for Sardar Ashiaan, his own brother, as Governor-General, while as yet I have fot succeeded in obtaining the removal of the Governor-General of Pars. The fact is that the Prime Minister is falling more and more under influence of nro-German democrats and though profuse promises are made by him that he will cheek the intrigues of the Germans nothing ol an effective nature is done, and there is a prospect now that Parman Parma, Minister of the Interior, who hf the only member of the Cabinet who shows in that direction any degree of energy will be transferred to Ministry of War, which is nothing but a sinecure, at the instance of the Germans and Turks. In that position he will he of little practical use to us. All representations for effective measures on the part of Persian Government are met by the Prime Minister with threats to resien and with requests for the withdrawal oi the Russian troops. He is in a difficult position. Of Persia’s real interests he is well aware, but any \ -t V i. , u12 steM he may take to protect them are represented as heins taken in Anglo- Bussian interests. He is therefore object of constant attack by strong pro* German elements in Mejlis and the Press. “Russian retirement in Galicia has had its effect at this moment. “ Russian Minister and I nevertheless see nothing better than to support him, as any other Cabinet would probably be worse and not better than the present one. “ Persians will not, I think, join the enemy intentionally, but the danger is that these parties of German agents are so powerful that they cannot without actual fighting be arrested for which no Persian Cabinet cares to be responsible, German °Consul, Ispahan, is said to have 200 retainers; while in one or two instances parties number 50 or more armed men with probablv a machine gun. Mission to Afghanistan will therefore possibly be able to reach its destination, while others will succeed in Kerman in producing there the same state of things that made it possible for the Russian Bank Manager to be murdered. To authorise His Majesty’s Consul to recruit guards for themselves would be use* less, as such action would tend to precipitate a serious incident, such as Germans seem to be seeking to bring about and I can only suggest that in informing the Government of Persia of intention of the two Governments to grant them advances a very strong warning should be conveyed to them by us of the dangers they are running and it should be clearly stated that for any untoward results that may be caused by their supineness there or in the neighbouring countries, Persia will be held to account.

Centre of Germau activities has been transferred from Tehran to Ispahan since the arrival of Russian troops at Kasvin and four or five German agents,^ with perhaps thirty Austrian soldiers, prisoners escaped from Trans-Caspia vid^ Meshed, and as many as 200 armed retainers recruited locally and from Naib Hussein’s brigands are now at Ispahan. Possibly German plan is to attack Russian and British Consulate, &amp;c., in the hope that Russian troops will be sent to Ispahan and that eventually Persia will eet embroiled m the war in this way. At present Persian Government have about 410 gendarmerie m Ispahan and more are to be sent from Fars. New Governor-General, Sirdar-i-Ashjaan, whom Russian Legation believe 'can be trusted, has a considerable force of Bakhtiari sowars at his disposal. Persian Government has sent orders that German retainers are to be disarmed and there should be no danger if Swedish officers have their men in hand and are sup ported by Governor-General.

Peisia. ^ Mr. Mailing s telegram No. 214, dated 24th instant, regarding German activity, has no doubt been repeated to you by Sir P. Cox^and I presume that Consuls at Meshed, Birjand and Kerman are alive to the import ance of preventing the entry into Afghanistan of the Germans and of otherwise neutralising their efforts. Aide Memoire from the Russian Government states that the Karguzar of Sistan reports that one hundred thousand rifles had been distributed by the Amir of Afghanistan and His Majesty was also at the instigation of Turkey, equipping twelve thousand men to march on Meshed. The Persian Government were asked by the Russian Minister at Tehran if they had a force sufficiently large enough to prevent Pugin and the other Germans from reaching Afghanistan. On receiving a reply in the negative, Russian Minister said that Russia would be obliged to take steps herself. It is, the Russian Minister thinks, of first importance that Pugin and his companions should be prevented from reaching Meshed. Enquiry should be made, and, if you see no objection, it would be as well to endeavour to arrange with the Amir if they cross his frontier for immediate arrest and deportation to India of these Germans.

Eollowing from His Majesty’s Representative at Shiraz, 191:— Begins. Disorderly state of Shiraz and neighbourhood is becoming daily more serious. There are constant robberies in and around town. Armenians are being threatened and assaulted. Situation in town was critical yesterday and serious trouble was only averted by gendarmerie under orders from Pousette. It is becoming increasingly evident that only force to he relied on for maintenance of order both here and on road is gendarmerie and I again venture to urge that if His Majesty’s Government desire to have peace and order maintained in Southern Persia it will be necessary to provide funds for gendarmerie as already proposed. Men have been nearly three months without pay and early decision is necessary. To avoid delay, I suggest that His Majesty’s Government should authorise Your Excellency to expend, say, £50,000 on upkeep of gendarmerie in Ears for one vear, money to be disbursed from time to time as required on demand of Officer Commanding (at) Shiraz addressed to British Consul. This would avoid any formalities with Persian Government and would make gendarmerie practic ally dependent on us. If proposal approved, I would submit further sugges tions regarding accounts, &amp;c.

From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, London. 'Your telegram of 25th June regarding Persia. In order to counter German agents in Persia and to prevent their entering into Afghanistan, we have authorised following steps :— (1) Instructions have been sent to the Consul, Kerman, to disburse secret service funds with a free hand with the object of putting leading men against such parties, getting them boycotted, and collecting information with regard to their movements and armaments and their numbers, which information will be immediately passed on to Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan and Consul, Sistan. (2) Instructions have been sent to the Agent to the Governor- General in Baluchistan to authorise Political Officers who are stationed on Perso- Baluch frontier to spend money freely in order to collect information, and to proceed against any party of German agents which may approach frontier, with militia and such local forces as may be available, and to destroy them. (3) Instructions have been sent to Consul, Sistan, to collect information in similar manner and to co-operate with the Officer in Command of the Robat detachment, which is to be strengthened by two machine guns, two squadrons Cavalry, and, if it is found possible, by a detachment from the Imperial Service Camel Corps. Should German parties enter Sistan, Officer Com manding bus been authorised to intercept and destroy them with this force if this is possible. (4) Consul-General, Meshed, has been asked to arrange if possible with his Russian colleague for Russian troops to capture or annihilate any party of Germans which may be discovered attempting to enter Afghanistan via Meshed or Birjand, and to collect information and send it on as in the cases of other Consular officers. His Majesty the Amir of Afghanistan is being warned by me in a letter of the possible advent of German parties to Afghanistan and also advised, nendino’ conclusion of war, to have them arrested, disarmed and interned. In our opinion it is not considered wise to suggest to His Majesty deportation of Germans to India, as this would be contrary to ordinary rule ol neutrality and might incline Amir to suspect that the Government of India were trying to embroil him with German Government. So far as we are aware, information reported by Russian Government regarding distribution of rifles in Afghanistan and intended despatch of Afghan troops to Meshed is baseless. Consul-General for Persia received a similar report which was contradicted by Government of India. «■ , — No. 245 €£., dated Bushire, the 26th June 1915 (Confidential).

This evening they reach Kerman* The second party, who left Kashan for Kerman on the 29th June, comprises three Indians, a few personal sowars and four Germans, together with seventeen mule loads of ammunition. Ten religious fanatics, four Austrian soldiers and four officers comprise party No. 3. On the 1st instant they left Ispahan for Yezd intending to go to (?) from there and had with them three-camels loaded with rifles, four with a machine gun, and five with ammunition.

To that our reply would presumably have to be occupation of Tehran and also an endeavour to seal whole of the frontiers of Afghanistan. We should in my opinion proceed on quite different lines and should endeavour (a) to turn the local feelings against the enemy, and (&amp;) avoid increasing the anti-British feeling in Persia which at present exists. As regards (a), an admirable object lesson is furnished by the Turkish- incursion. Its result was to reawaken against the Turks latent hostility of the Persians and to make the much talked of jehad a complete failure. Germans or rather Wassmuss with his plan of attack on Bushire may (also ?) render their cause similarly dis(astrous); and proof is that efforts are now being made by the German Minister to induce Wassmuss to return to Tehran just as an appeal was made by the Turkish Ambassador to Baouf to withdraw to Turkey. Presumably now Bushire ought to be in a position to defend itself and I can think of nothing that would be more helpful to us than (Wassmuss ?)’s attack. We should in another direction endeavour to utilise press and with that object in view I have just been enabled to make arrangements by having had some funds placed by His Majesty’s Government at my disposal. We should, as regards (b)&gt;, avoid any overt action against Germans and should invariably 'take action through the Persian Government. In this direction the present Cabinet has done something and I have succeeded in getting strong instructions despatched to the Governors of Sistan and Kerman to hold up emissaries of the enemy and disarm their followers but whether these instructions will be carried out effectively depends upon the support we ean give them. This is like everything in Persia a question of money more than anything else. The value of this weapon has been well understood by the Germans and since my arrival here in the middle of April I have every reason to believe that the enemies’missions here have disposed of at least £o0 } 000 while the agents of the Germans in the provinces of Persia appear to be pro portionately well supplied. Our policy until quite recently has on the contrary been not to use money on any scale compared to this, except in Southern Persia, but I feel that if I can be granted, say, £o,000 a month and if our reluctance to employ these means is now overcome much can be clone to stimulate the courage of the Persian Government and its supporters ot (.) party in Mejlis and also by subsiding some of the local papers to cause a veering round of public opinion in our favour. At any rate experiment (?) (when compared with?) action which I cannot but regard as certain to produce most regretable results is worth trying. At all events it is not a costly method and in the event of its failure does not preclude us from the possibility of trying tlm more drastic measures con templated by you which latter, moreover, could, in no circumstances, I appre hend be undertaken except after consultation with Bussia.

Please refer to your clear the line telegram of 7th July. On the 6th instant instructions were issued to local authorities in the same sense and will be repeated. At same time our view of situation in Afghanistan appears to have been entirely misunderstood by Marling. We have every reason to distrust popular attitude in Afghanistan, which is pro-Turkish, fanatical and inflammable to a degree, though we have good reason to believe in Amir’s sincere desire to maintain neutrality. Presence of German agents with armed parties in Afghanistan would almost certainly provoke situation there which would make it doubtful whether the Amir would be in a position to persevere in his present attitude, and Government of India might be faced with a position which would strain their resources to fullest extent reacting as it certainly would on the whole Indian frontier, including Baluchistan. It was with the object of obviating such a possibility that it was proposed to employ troops to intercept German parties which might be attempting to cross v'd Perso-Baluch border into Afghanistan or Sistan in much the same manner as troops have in the past been used to intercept arms traffic, but Government of India only proposed this as a last resort. If Persian authorities in interior are competent to deal with German parties, so much the better. Instructions which were issued by Government of India to Consul, Kerman, afforded them every opportunity of doing so and no action in interior of Persia was suggested by Government of India which was not in consonance with ruFes of neutrality as hitherto observed. It is only in the event of failure on the part of local authorities in interior of Persia, that Government of India proposed drastic action m order to frustrate German attempts to enter Afghanistan or Bnhsh temtory. We shall be tco late to stop German parties entering Afghanistan if we wait till Sistan authorities have also failed. Uo to the present time Persian authorities at Ispahan, Tend and Kerman have not displayed either inclination or ability to deal with German parties.

It does not seem possible that reinforcement(s) of troops from Quetta will arrive in time, and I think that, if German parties are to be intercepted, half or more of present garrison at Kucha should make an advance directly, it is knowny whether it is the intention of Germans to travel via Khabis or Bam. I can collect camels in Sistan so that as many of our infantry as possible should he mounted. The climate is at its worst at present. I do not think Governor will oppose the entry of our troops into Sistan and I beg to submit that in a crisis our troops have as much right to be there as Russian troops have to be in Meshed. On the other hand if the Germans are able to enter Sistan without opposi tion, they can collect from among Baluchis, who are disaffected to Persian Government and to present Governor, as many adherents as they want. There is also in Sistan a considerable section of fanatical Saiyids; these men are ready to attack foreigner(s), including Indians, directly they cease to fear local garrison(s). They were greatly impressed by receipt of copies (of) jehad propaganda last week, which Chief of Police did not succeed in con fiscating. On July 4th I was informed by Consul-General, Meshed, that Governor- General admitted his inability to arrest these Germans, and expressed the wish that Russians should do it. I am certain that Persian troops in Sistan will likewise fail. Their officers are an utterly incapable set of men. On July 1st I reported to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, that Governor had voluntarily promised to inform his Government that on account of excitability of people and proximity of frontier Germans must not be allowed to enter Sistan. We thought there were only two Germans to be dealt with at that time. In Seistan all senior officials are friendly to His Majesty’s Government, but no moderate expenditure of money on our part will restrain Saiyids or leading Raluch Sardar, Khudadad Khan, whom even now the officials regard with fear and who is aggrieved because of the detention in Birjand of his relative Sardar Purdil Khan. I venture to urge most strongly that Robat garrison be warned to be ready to march by July 21st to Sistan for the protection of British lives and property there, as wed as to operate against German parties. I must mention that it will he an extremely difficult matter to ration our reinforcing troops, if they remain in British territory. Telegram P., No. S. 652, dated the 10th July 1915.

In spite of the prospect of seeing the late Persian Cabinet resume office with increased prestige, I think that in view of the opinion expressed by His Majesty’s Consul, Birjand (please see his telegram No. 100 C.), that the local Persian authorities would prove unable to stop German parties. Preparations to send troops from Kacha should be pushed forward for action as suggested by him. These (?) should he able to deal with any parties travelling via Khadis or Bam. But it would he more difficult to intercept party which the Consul at Yazd reports as having left Nain for Tabas on 6th instant via Anarak (Yazd tele gram, 6th, which was repeated to Meshed and Sistan) and party seems to be too numerous to be dealt with even by methods put forward by His Majesty’s Consul, Birjand, which by His Majesty’s Government we are prevented from using. As soon as the new Government is formed, I shall take steps for the removal of the embargo (on) the export of grain. In the meantime the troops must look after themselves.

He maintains that he cannot at rest or interfere with Germans without definite orders from his Govern ment. He says at the same time that, if his Government permit Germans to enter Sistan, he will threaten to resign on account of mischief they may do intriguing with Baluchis. I observed that apparently neutrality of Persian Government is so pronounced that the Persian authorities will not interieie if a British force of 300 men were to encounter a German force of 150 men in neighbourhood of Sistan. He concurred in this, declaring at the same time that if ordered to do so his garrison at Sistan is quite capable of dealing with Germans. I hold a different opinion as to this. It must also be remembered that Persian authorities are particularly inert during month of Ramazan and resent being called upon to take any active measures. Until it is certain that a German party is making for Sistan, I do not advise our troops crossing the frontier. Repeated to Tehran 40, Meshed and Baluchistan.

Ispahan, 19th June 1915. Sir, In amplification of my telegram No. 128 of do-day’s date, informing you of my interview of yesterday evening with Sardar-i-Ashjaa, I have now the honour to report as follows : Mv Russian Colleague having expressed the desire to accompany me when I should call on the Sardar-i-Ashjaa in pursuance of the instructions contained in your telegram No. 51 of the 15th instant, 1 arranged with M. Hildehrandt that we should pay a joint visit yesterday evening to His Excellency who had for some days past been soliciting an interview with me. In a preliminary discussion on our line of action M. Hildehrandt and^ I a creed that it would be preferable to tell Sardar-i-Ashjaa that we had no desire to cast the shortcomings of his brother Sardar-i-Muhtasham in his teeth and wished to begin our relations with him on a clean slate; further that it would he undesirable to avail ourselves of the offer which Sardar-i- Ashjaa had made in the course of an interview on the 11th instant, viz\ r . that he would be prepared to appoint a non-Bakhtiari Deputy Governor who should be a persona grata to both Legations and their local representatives. At my Colleague’s desire I took the lead and said that we made this joint call understanding that His Excellency had now received the official notification from the Persian Government of his appointment which was a source of pleasure to all his friends, not least to both Legations whose influence, as I was sure His Excellency must be aware, had played a large part in his own appointment and in the maintenance of the honour of the Eakhtiaris. Sardar-i-Ashjaa, rippling with unconcealed self-satisfaction, responded with one of the stereotyped phrases to the effect that he would only feel really happy when he should have been able to prove by his actions that he was worthy of the confidence reposed in him by his friends. 'We then enquired about the movements of Sardar-i-Muhtasham and learn ing that he had retired to the Bagh-i-Sharaf, a garden some miles outside the town, we mildly consigned him and his misdeeds to a merited oblivion (with some mental reservations). His Excellency then proceeded to paint in purple and gold a picture of the happier era now dawning for Ispahan and appealed to us to help hbxfc in putting in the high lights.31 In ilie course of a conversation which lasted more than an hour His Excellency put before us at some length the main points of his programme. These I briefly recapitulate here. (1) Deputy Governor, ^ After some little fencing on both sides His Excellency named his own choices, viz ., (i) Mushir-uKMulk (an old and somewhat moth-eaten retainer ot tne Zill-us-Sultan. tii) Hukn-ul-Mulk (the present Head of the local Tribunal—Adhyeh), j brother of the Qawam-ud-Howleh—Mutammid-i-Hhaqan— formerly Governor-General of Ispahan. (iii) Mirza Ahmad Khan Mir Panjeh, whose name and qualifications are known to you. His Excellency said that No. 1 having refused the choice lay between o Pe^onallv he inclined to No. 2, hut would wish to he guided by oiTr p^afe advfcr I gave^y unqualified and my Colleague a somewhat qualified assent to His Excellency’s choice.

Throughout the interview above reported I was careful to adopt the most friendly phraseology and, in compliance with the instructions conveyed in your telegram No. 53 of the 18th instant, to avoid any appearance of endeavouring to wring conditions from the Sardar-i-Ashjaa. All the proposals made by His Excellency were spontaneous. In this connection it may he of interest to you to know that at a meeting of Bakhtiari Ulama notables and merchants held on Itith instant at the house of Sadr-ul-Hlama (please refer to my telegram No. 124 of 17th instant)—as I am informed—a telegram from the Cabinet was read appointing Sardar-i- Ashjaa Governor-General, the wording of which excited the suspicions of the Clergy present and caused some of them to declare that in their belief the Government was laying a trap and intended eventually to despatch Prince Nusrat-us-Sultaneh hither—probably without giving any previous notice. I shall not fail to use my best endeavours to conjure any suspicions of this nature from the mind of Sardar-i-Ashjaa and shall continue to &lt;e mark time ” till I receive some other word of command from you. I propose however to profit by the present apparently favourable disposi tion of the new Governor-General to press for settlement of various long- outstanding British cases (more particularly certain claims of the Imperial Bank of Persia) about some of which you have been informed by my desnatch No. 18 of March 5th and 20 of March i3th last) and I venture to express the hope that you may see fit—if the situation in Tehran be not unfavourable—to cause orders to be sent both to the Sardar-i-Ashjaa and to the Acting Kar-uzar to expedite settlement of outstanding British claims—a list of which I am now about to transmit to the Sardar-i-Ashjaa-which have received such scant attention at the hands of the outgoing Governor-General, Sardar-i-Muhtasham, and the recently recalled Karguzar, Manuchehr Mirza. 0.

Prom—His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. r Urgent, Please refer to my telegram No. 242. The crisis in regard to the Cabinet still continues and although it seems a certainty^ that office will be retained by Ain-ed-Don leh he already talks of doing so without the Minister of Interior Earman Earma. Ain-ed-Dowleh will, should this final concession be made to the pro-German party, be so dependent on them that to expect that anything effective will be done to check German action here will be hopeless. As it is by the resignation of the Ministry, the small beginning to fulfil frequent promises made to me to hold up German emissaries proceeding east has been arrested. The ■whole fact of the matter is that there is a very general belief; which is carefully fostered by the Turks and Germans, and from which Ain-ed-Dowleh is by no means exempt, that our allies and ourselves are in desperate position; contrast is being drawn between the mild action taken for the murder of her Vice-Consul at Ispahan by Russia and the vigour with which she would in the past have displayed her displeasure at such an occurrence, and the conclusion is drawn that even in Persia, Russia is really powerless to help herself. No doubt Ain-ed-Dowleh may know better, but he prefers not to risk with the noisy demorcratic minority in the Mejlis his present popularity by taking measures of an energetic nature to put an end to the constant and flagrant violation by Germans and their allies of Persian neutrality, and he thinks that he can satisfy us with promises and half measures as we do not show ourselves capable of protecting our own interests here. In regard to the future he reflects that if friction between the two legations were possible during the war when their Governments were allies, disagreements between them in future may make it possible for Persia to play one Power off against the other as before the Agreement of 1907. With this state of things in the Capital we are now confronted with an attack on the Bushire Residency, an attack of which the Persian Government had had every knowledge and warning and which is beyond question directly due to German intrigue. I submit that it is absolutely imperative coming as if does on the outrage at Ispahan, that decisive action should at once be taken by Russia and ourselves and 1 would urge for the consideration of the two Governments that Russian forces at Resht and Kasvin should be raised to 5,0C0 men with a proper proportion of guns and cavalry (which Ain-ed-Dowleh now agrees is necessary) and that Mohammerah, Bingah, Bunder Abbas and Busbire should be seized and Hormuz occupied and that when we have done so the Persian Government be informed that until reparation is made for the attack at Bushire and until German intrigues are put a stop to, by the arrest of the various German Agents now at work in Persia, we shall retain possession of these towns. If Ain-ed-Dowleh should not retain office such action (will become all the ?) more necessary. If we fail to do this we must be prepared to see the Germans free to do what they like, except where we are able to use our own resources, and to be exposed to the possibility of further outrages.The Russian Minister is communicating to Petrograd these views with ^Sdre^dtSgn Office as No. 247 and repeated to India, Basrah, Bushire and Petrosrrad. / ^ ' Telegram R., No. 305 C„ dated the Mtb (received 15th) July 1915.

I think however that tribesmen will again collect and threaten us and we shall have no quiet until we attack and crush them. I venture to suggest therefore that if there is likely to be nuiet in operations in Mesopotamia, Army Commander might sufficient reinforcements and transports to enable column to he confederate Khans consecutively. We should begin with Sheikh Hussein ; Ahmad Khan Augab, with Haidar Pasha Khan ? s forces, would gladly co-operate and we could hand oyev Ahmadi to him, as the price of assistance. After disposing of bheikh Hussein, if conditions appeared favourable, Borasjun and A hr am could be tackled. Dilwar might forthwith he bombarded by His Majesty s ships, and towers blown up by landing party, as Kais Ali’s gang was directly concerned in Dtp, death of the two British officers. In my telegram No. 207 0., dated the 30th May, I had risked _ His Majesty’s Minister to inform the Persian Government of the hostile attitude of these Khans and to note them for a future punishment. It appears to me that the time has now come to inflict it as severely and promptly as possible. Position since the attack has completely changed. I have furnished yon from time to time with translations of threatening letters of the confederate Khans, which have culminated in an open declara tion of war on British in Bushire, in (?) rejoicings for their conduct with Wassmuss of the campaign, and in exhortations to all to join them for sake of religion. It is clear from these that these Chiefs regard themselves as in a state of war with us here, whatever the attitude of their own Government may he. If we do not take prompt measures to avenge the deaths of these two British officers almost at the gates of the Besidency, which has gained and enjoyed unique respect during the last hundred and fifty years, it will be put down to pusillanimity. We shall not only lose enormously in prestige, but must expect attacks at any time which suits the confederates, resulting in garrison of Bushire remaining in something approaching perpetual state of s'ege and this (is ?) galling to all. His Excellency the Governor is of the same opinion and has aleady spoken to me very earnestly on the subject two or three times recommending that drastic measures he taken. In spite of my repeated complaints to Tehran regarding hostile Chiefs, who openly claim to have the Persian Government and Governor-General of Pars with them, Persian Government have done nothing to warn or threaten them by telegraph and clearly do not intend to mind what happens. In making the above recommendation I am of course only representing matters from a local point of view and realise that large questions outside my sphere of legation prevent any action on lines indicated. If so, we shall have trouble here probably on island as well as from outside. Addressed Cox, sent to Tehran, sent to India.35 Telegram P., No. 1398 B,, dated the 14th (received loth) July 1915. From— The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Basrah, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Attack which was recently made on us at Bushire and which has been long expected and planned, and of which the Persian Government since the time of Listeman’s arrest, has had full warning, is indistinguishable from an act of war; hut I know that the policy of His Majesty’s Government is not to treat it as such. I venture however as Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf to urge that v r e should make prompt use of incident both to oblige Persian Government to adopt a really neutral demeanour and to get them to abandon their present attitude of veiled hostility, and also to institute active measures on our part for preservation in Pars and elsewhere of those interests which Persian Government is unwilling or unable to protect. In the former direction I w 7 ould urge that we present an ultimatum to the Government of Persia based on followdng lines :— (1) That the present Governor-General of Pars should be recalled at once and his recall made public by announcement. (2) That forthwith the gendarmes in Pars should be recalled to their duties on the road and that they should be withdrawn altogether from Bushire-Borasjun section which should be handed over to the charge of the Governor of Bushire, wTio will maintain a guard from funds to be drawn from Bushire custom house under our supervision. (3) Arrest or recall of all Germans in Pars. (4) Deposition and proclamation as outlaws of following local Khans, viz., Rais Ali, Dilwari; Zair Takly of Tangistan; Sheikh Hussein of Chahkutah, and his son Mahomet, who have been concerned in the recent attack on Bushire; and removal of Ghazanfar-us- Saltan eh of Borasjun and his replacement by a nominee who will be agreeable to us; and expulsion from Pars of _ Saiyid Murteza, the hero of the disturbances of 1909 and who is now concerned with the above persons. In the event of Persian Government failing to accept these terms within 3 hours and failing execution within 10 days, we should, pending compliance ith above ultimatum, assume control over the custom house at Busline, hold tveuue, and disallow the despatch of merchandise inland. If military resources Imit of it as Resident I would further recommend that we should send an rmed reconnaissance to raze the towers of the Khan of Chahkutah (and hrs ) m at Ahmadi and of the Khan of Borasaun at Borasjun, we should also ombard the town of Dilwari from the sea as has been done before. If we were to take this action and were to warn friendly Khans of our itent,ions I am confident latter would of-themselves co-operate in the, iterests of law and order and settle affairs in the Bushire hinterland in a ,-ay which would he conducive to the future interests of His Majesty iovernment. In fact they have repeatedly made offers to do so.

No. 369 of 1912, some 50 miles N.-N.-E. of Khabis, about long. 56. c lat. 31°. Jandaq mentioned in my telegram No. 127 lying in a desert about 140 miles due north of Yazd has been a frequent haven of rest for Naib Hussein and his men in former days and it is not improbable that the desert journey now contemplated by the Germans may have been suggested by him—they being in constant and friendly relations with that fine old brigand and his son Mashallah Khan. My information states that in addition to the mules which left here with the German party of the 16th June, 24 camels had been engaged to carry their food, water, &amp;c., across the desert. o o j The party took with it eight eases of specie said to be gold. gj.

So far as I know following is a resume of the movement^ of the German parties. In addition to parties which have been reported in my previous telegrams Nos. 64 and 65 (Yazd telegram, July 11th, and Ispahan telegram, 167, repeated Birjand, Meshed, Sistan) there are :■— (A) Party under Zugmeyer and Greisinger, which is composed of 32 Ispahani sowars, 8 Austrians, 26 baggage animals, of which 12 carry arms and ammunition and one machine gun. This party arrived at Kerman on July 4th and do not appear to have left there. (B) Party under Wagner and Paschen,. which is composed of 30 Ispahani sowars, left Nain on June 22nd, according to Yice-Consul, Yazd, via Anarak and Abgarm and Mehrjan and Tahas. It was arranged that Paschen was to remain at Tun and Wagner was to go to Birjand and on relief to proceed to Meshed. It is suggested by Consul, Ispahan, that route may be via Allahabad and thence across Loot to Sistan. (C) And two parties (one presumably under Hentig, formerly of German Legation), consisting of six Germans^ six Austrians, ten Mujahidin, one Afghan, 30 sowars and 48 baggage mules and camels, which arrived July 4th and July 6th, respectively, at Nain, and having joined, left July 6th for Tabas via Anarak and there await another party which (left?) July 10th for Nain (see end of my telegram 65). It is said that these parties carry four machine guns. See-my telegram 64 as regards two other later parties from Ispahan. Telegram P., No. 35 C., dated (and received) the 15th July 1915. From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Meshed, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Please refer to my telegram No. 32 C. In reply to his telegram the Bussian Consul-General has been told that it would be a good thing that Bussian troops should be used to support . Persian officials in securing the arrest of the German parties. The Bussian Consul-General is not satisfied with the reply received from his Government and wants definite orders authorising him to employ Cossacks to arrest party. Latest idea which has struck the Governor-General is that they will be able to secure the disarmament of the Germans by persuasion and that resort to force will not be necessary. I have sent a private warning to the Deputy Governor of Herat (who has in many instances prevented suspicious characters from entwin? into Afghanistan turned away others) telling hrm that the Germans may possibly try to enter Afghanistan; he has accordingly i sued orde™ that ^careful watch must be kept and that no foreigners should be permitted to cross the frontier. .

From—His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Meshed, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Clear the line. It is reported that the German party from Jandak and Samnan arrived on the 7th instant at a place thirty miles from Tabas. The number and composition of the party is not yet known, but it is estimated at one hundred, and the informer saw two guns; the other half of which is following is a party of similar strength. Nidibin was visited by me and advised to ask for the assistance of Cossacks or at any rate to request that, pending further orders, the Cossacks he sent to Turbat-i-Haidari, but without sanction from his Government he refused to do any (thing). It was agreed by us in consultation with the Russian Consul-General that it was of the highest importance that Cossacks should at once be sent and he asked if Your Excellency with the Russian Minister would compel the Persian Government to send orders to the Governor-General to employ Cossacks and to render them every assistance. The Russian Consul-General was persuaded by me, as I did before and again two days ago, pending further instructions to send (troops ?).
