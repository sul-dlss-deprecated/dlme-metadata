No. I.G. 1912, 5th. Sir P. Cox had long interview with Bin Sand at Qatif near Bahrein on 26th December. Full note of the interview being posted you, meanwhile resume is as follows :—“ Though Turks are no doubt taking advantage of recent developments in Europe and of suspension of our advance on Baghdad to endeavour to re-kindle tribal and religious feeling against us in Central Arabia, Bin Sand does not anticipate much result, lie thinks explanation of rumour of intended purchase of 40,000 camels by Turks, is that Turks are endeavouring to bribe tribal Sheikhs to co-operate with them, and are offering bribe in shape of an advance for investment in camels or horses in case Turkish Government requires them. He himself received similar overtures few months ago. He does not believe Bin Rashid would dare to advance far towards Koweit or Nasiriyah for fear that Bin Sand should cut in against (?) in his rear, and that in any case absence of rain and grazing puts advance of any large force at present out of the question. Bin Sand’s present relations with Shereff of Mecca are quite normal and friendly but he characterises Shensi essentially unstable, trivial, undependable. Bin Saud discredits any active under standing between Shereff and Bin Rashid. Regarding general question of Caliphate, in the event of Turkey breaking up, Bin Saud says nobody among ruling chiefs cares in the least who calls himself Caliph, and even if Shereff claims title they would no more accept control from him than they do now, but each chief would continue to control his own tribes and welcome immunity from Turkish oppression.” On 31st December Sir P. Cox interviewed new Sheikh of Koweit, viz., Jabar Bin. Mubarak at his capital. Jabar’s news of Bin Rashid was that he is now weakened and most unlikely to move towards Koweit or Zusigr. ? He was emphatic in view that neither he (Jabar nor his dependents) takes any interest whatever in question of Caliphate. And Cox says that is general impression he has gained from all tribes this side of Arabia since start of war. \ f .From Viceroy, 29th December 1915. My telegram 26th December. Bin Sand. Following from Cox, 3,500, 27th December. “ Your telegram 18th August last No. 849 and subsequent corre spondence. “ Treaty concluded with Bin Sand on 26th December. Text finally adopted seems to me satisfactory and to comply with requirements of Secretary of State’s telegram of 16th August. Bin Saud’s personal attitude was frank and straightforward and it is my belief that his steadfast adherence to us during war can be relied upon. “Addressed to Foreign, repeated to Basra, for the information of Army Commander.” As directed in your telegram of 27th December my being repeated to McMahon as also the foregoing.Bin Baud. Some time about 4th December Political Agent at Bahrein received message from Bin Baud expressing wish that negotiations should be expedited, first because he is convinced that Turks were intriguing with Arabs and second because he would shortly be leaving for interior. Owing to difficulty of communication with Bahrein some Esniasi confusion occurred in arranging meeting. But apparently Keyes met Bin Baud at Katif on 21st December and as latter could only wait till 25th, Cox proceeded is post haste to Katif and was to meet Bin Baud there on Christmas day.

He there fore proposed postponement of meeting until quiet was restored. At the same time he made indefinite request through his agent for some form of assistance. I replied asking him to explain frankly what form of assistance he needed as without further explanation it was difficult to approach Government of India. At the same time I sent him 300 0 to show our good will and India, Foreign SecreiaR No . 4.2 M, dated 17 f? 19151 have now authorising Political Agent, Bahrein, to Pay 10,000 rupees to his agent as temporary assistance from secret service funds. Letter now received in reply to above. Ht* JW* A Apr: W In it he explains that E and C have been put up to attach him by P who have furnished them with large supplies of money and modern arms and ammunition while his people have mainly old fashioned weapons and he is now short both of arms and ammunition. He begs for 3000 rifles. As regards money he explains that owing to war his people were unable last year to dispose of date crop to Hedjaz or livestock to other parts of Arabia as usual so that he has been getting no revenue and at the same time has been put to very heavy expenditure owing to necessity for keeping large forces under arms for a long time past. He is now coming to end of his resources / - that of accommodating friends and asks for urgently loan of 50,000 liras from Government of India repayable by instalments. As regards above in his fight with E in January last there is no doubt that A suffered severely and in his A- current operations against C one of his brothers Baud haslias 1)0611 killed and although he is believed to he getting the better of them now fortune has been against him for part 'few months. From one point of view this fact is useful as it will make him more tractable for the purpose of C. On the other hand it would seem to be to the interest of our policy provided that he is effectively allied with us that ho should be the strongest element in H. There is no question as to sincerity of his explana tion in regard to his present condition in regard to arms and ammunition and money. It is merely for Government of India to decide to what extent it is worth while and at present practicable to help him. In the direction of security A could offer customs revenues of K and revenues of B and K and the latter place is always at our mercy. I do not consider that less than ? * 20,000 pounds and (Stordemmen) rifles with 200 thousand pounds would be worth offering to him. h' '{%A At present my (our) orders to send all L whatever to England. I submit that such munitions should be reserved for promotion our interests and strengthening our allies in this sphere. If fortune favours us we may soon have freshfrer-h rtocV o^K^wiilcn c juII be sent to ,A. Polling thr.t will Government of India consider what weapons they can ^ offer.

BIN SA'UD is at present at war with the Ajman, a Kassa, tribe which recently rebelled against his authority having first played him false on January 24th, the day on which Capt Shakespear was killed. Ho is being assisted in his campaign against them by a j..O o.^e of Kuwait tribes numbering some 4000 st-rong which Shaikh Sir Mubarak has sent to his support under the command of one of his sons. She opposing forces are at the present moment somewhere near Hofuf, and we are expecting news of an engagement. These operations have no connection with the Anglo—Turkish wa-. IBN RASHID, the Shammar chief, Is at Hail so iai ao we mow, and at present inactive. About three months ago Shaikh Sir Mubarau applied to him for help in recovering some oamels which had been looted by the Shammar in Kuwait territory, but Ibn Rashid replied discoiu- -teously, saying, that he did nothing except by order of the lurks and that he was awaiting their instructions in that as in other matters. Needless to say the oamels have not yet been recovered. Since that correspondence we have heard nothing more from Ibn RashidT£) yi WAR 0FR1UE, Of 0 S)/LL28 (A. 5) 2. W. 7th August 1915.

This is what was necessary to be stated and may you remain preserved and greeting. Dated the 9th Jamadi II, 1333 (24th April 1915). From— Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman-al-Faisal as Saud, To—The Hon'ble Sir Percy Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General. After compliments .—We have duly received your esteemed communica tion containing your kind remarks regarding the Treaty which we desired to conclude between ourselves and the exalted British Government for confirm ing the friendly relations which have existed for a long time, and forwarding therein a draft of Treaty sent by Your Honour and a letter from His Excellency Lord Hardinge, representative of His Imperial Majesty the King of Great Britain and Emperor of India. These were received in your valued letter and we understood their contents (viz.) that the illustrious Government have appointed Your Honour as their plenipotentiary in concluding the friendly Treaty; and we have full confidence that the said matter will be settled in a satisfactory manner. Certain modifications (which are not important) were found necessary for cogent reasons, necessitated by local conditions, the need to reassure the inhabitants and the governing family of the Bin Saud, and also in view of the knowledge we possess as to the circumstances of the Arabs. We beg to inform Your Honour of the latter’s present disposition. They are divided into three sections, viz-, one, those who assist the Turkish Government for the sake of worldly objects, so that they may be allowed to participate with the authorities of the said Government in oppression and high-handedness and attain their objects from her by this means; another, those to whose chiefs the said Government sends considerable sums in order to deceive them and win them over so that they may be tools in her hands for her hostile actions against her neighbours in the Arabian regions ; and the third, those who bind themselves to her on the pretext of Islamism wdiich they put forward but which is devoid of truth, as they have failed to properly judge the real signi ficance of the affair. We are, however, alive to the situation and use our efforts and endeavours as far as possible to bring them to our path and treat each of them in accordance with his condition and position, as was represented to you by our late lamented friend, Captain Shakespear. For instance, in the case of people such as Ibn Bashid and the like, we make war against them for their refusal to listen to our advice; parties such as the Sharif, we treat with advice and exhortations; people such as the headmen of the nomads, e.g., Ibn Shaalan and such like, we treat with good graces and favours ; and to those of them who are hostile we mete out punishment and chastisement. The object of all this is that they should have no alliance with the Turks, that their (the Turks’) prestige should be broken, and that she should not succeed in her clumsy politics, which means the instigation of the Arabs against one another.i 3 V r r Por this reason we haye desired to conclude a Treaty and alliance with the exalted Government in order to release them (the Arabs) from the bondage of the Turks. We have regard to the matters which harmonise with our internal conditions and have modified some of the articles according to those condi tions. And my reliance and confidence in Your Honour is of the highest degree. Herewith you will find a letter to His Excellency the representative of His Imperial Majesty the King of England and Emperor of India and also the draft of the Treaty. ¥ou will note them, and, please God, you will sign it and inform His Excellency accordingly. We pray to God to enable us to contribute to the welfare of the two nations, the '.British and the Arab, and beg of you, our sincere iriend, to let us know your well-being and the successes of the exalted Government. This is what was necessary to he stated and may you remain preserved and salaams. DRAFT TREATY WITH BIN SAUD. r »r‘ English translation. British draft. Bin Sand's draft.

Preamble —(1) Addition of “Jubailand the towns and ports belonging to them Specific mention has apparently been made of Jubail, because there is a large village there of the A1 Bu Ainain tribe and the Turks kept a military post there. The place is included in the A1 Hasa Sanjak, but if he wants it inserted by name, I see no objection. He should be asked his reasons for inserting it. (2) “ Eor a long time ” instead of “ Eor generations ”. Unobjectionable. Article I —(3) Addition of “ Jubail, their dependencies and territories, which will be discussed and determined hereafter”, vide (1). (4) Only use of different word. No objection. (5) Addition of words “ as absolute Chief of the tribes I think we admit this in practice, but it seems a little unnecessary to say so in writing. We may try to get out of it. (6) The words “ by the living Ruler ” are added by me to the English translation, after assuring myself after discussion with Bin Sand’s Agent, that this is his meaning. The words “ or by the calling for the votes of the inhabitants inhabiting those countries ” have been added. All right in principle but difficult in practice. Needs discussion with him. (7) Important words “ subject to the approval of the British Govern ment, after confidential consultation with them ” are omitted. I have little doubt that when he understands our motive in inserting this safeguard, he will accept our wording or some other suitable formula. Article II —(8) He has omitted “ unprovoked ” on the ground that the word used in the Arabic “taaddi” itself signifies “molestation without a cause”, and that the addition of “unprovoked” is therefore unnecessary. It is not important. He can be got to restore the word, if necessary. (VI) Bin Saud undertakes as his fathers did before him to refrain from all aggression on, or interference with, the territories of Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman Coast, or l7 other tribes and Chiefs who are under the protection of the British Govern ment, and the limits of whose terri tories shall he hereafter determined. (VII) The British Government and Bin Saud agree to conclude 18 so soon as this can conveniently be arranged, a further detailed Treaty in regard to ™other matters jointly concerning them.- 6 (9) Substitution of words 'in all circumstances and in all places”. This is of course impossible of acceptation. Some other formula will have to be found by discussion with Bin Saud—something, I think, not so one-sided as our version, or so comprehensive as his. Article JV —(10) Omission of words ' For ever ”, Of no consequence. (11) Omission of word 'sell”. Probably clerical error, should be re inserted. (12) “ Lease ” as separate from mortgage was left out in error in our version and is omitted in his. Might be considered included in “ otherwise dispose of (13) Word “ Grant ” omitted—as same Arabic word is used in preceding line for “ dispose of ”. No objection. (14) Words “ where his interests require ”. Somewhat bald, but he no doubt only means “ where his interests are not injured thereby ” and could be got to accept that alternative which seems unobjectionable. (15) “ Through his countries ” used instead of ' through his territories or limits No objection. Article V —^16) I suppose he thinks that his undertaking 'to keep the roads leading to the Holy Places ” includes the protection of pilgrims on the way there, so he only speaks of their 'return”, but it should be return ' from ” and not “ to ”. No doubt a clerical error. Article VI —(17) 'Other tribes and Chiefs” omitted. Might go in again unless he has any valid argument to put forward for its omission. Article VII —(18) Omits 'As soon as can be conveniently arranged”. Words can be dispensed with. (19) Word 'other” omitted. Probably clerical error. No consequence. P. Z. Cox. 26lh June 1915, Translation of a letter from the British Resident in the Persian Gulf to Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman bin Faisal as-Saud, dated the 26th June 1915. After complim°nts ,—Your valued letters of the 9th Jamadi I 1333 duly reached me, but I have been absent with the troops first at Ahwaz and then at Amara and your letters arrived during my absence. There has consequent ly been some delay in dealing with them and sending you a reply, for which you will excuse me. But I asked Abdul Latif bin Mandil to let you know the above and give you the new r s and he tells me be did so. The letter to llis Excellency the Viceroy I have sent to its destination. As regards the Treaty, I have understood what you wrote, explaining that you had made certain modifications in the text. I have not the least doubt that we shall succeed in adjusting the wording of the articles into a form which will suit both parties and safeguard the interests of yourself and us; but as the wording W’as different to what the Government had approved previously, it has been necessary for me to refer it to them. But you will now have understood from reading the draft Treaty in question as to what extent the British Government is ready to strengthen its relations with you, and you will, I am sure, be able to rest tranquil pending the final conclusion of the document. I think myself that the matter will be finished more easily at a personal meeting between us. At present, according to information which reaches me. Your Honour is on the way to, or about to proceed to, Hassa. I also am leaving Basrah for some days in the direction of Nasiriyeh which it is now our intention to occupy and administer the government there. On my return from there, I will communicate with you, and I hope you will find it possible to come to Ujair, so that we can have a meeting there. This is what had to be stated and may you remain preserved and salaams. F. k r. Dept. Frett—No. 1220-8.7-15-12.CONFIDENTIAL. Letter from Lieutenant-Colonel ^ . G. Grey, Indian Army, Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Secretary, Political Department, India Office. Political Agency, Kuwait, Dear Sir Arthur Hirtzel, 16th June 1915. I he enclosed is perhaps important or interesting enough to send to \ on direct in view of the time which correspondence takes to reach the India Office, particularly now that the mail journey from India is extended by a week. The position has materially improved during the past few days ; the waverers among Arabs are more soundly converted to us by our success than by any other form of persuasion. Yours very truly, \Y . G. Grey. From Lieutenant-Colonel Y\ . G. Grey, Indian Army, Political Agent, Kuwait, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. C/8 of 1915, dated Political Agency, Kuwait, 9th June 1915. Sir, According to the Times, Lord Curzon of Kedleston is reported to have remarked as follows on the occasion of an address by Mr. P. Landon on Basrah and the Shatt-ul-Arab, at the Society of Arts, on 15th April last: — “ Hitherto we had had most friendly relations with the Arabs. It was rather a puzzle to him why at those earlier stages of the fighting the Arabs appeared to have sided with the Turks, and it certainly should be the object of our diplomacy to detach them from the side of the Turks and to resume those pleasant relations with them which had characterized our policy during the last 50 years.” And again in the House of Lords on 2uth April :— “ And they (the Turks) appeared to have succeeded in pressing into their service the greater part of the Arab tribes in the lower part of Mesopotamia. This was a matter of extreme importance, for we had always maintained, and he thought were still maintaining, friendly relations with the tribes in that part of the world.” The Right Honourable the Secretary of State for India is reported to have replied on the latter occasion that:— A considerable number of Arabs had joined the Turks in the attacks. A t the battle of Shaiba, where there were certainly not less than 10,000 Turkish troops engaged, probably approaching the same number of Arabs took part in the operations. It had been perhaps too hastily assumed at first that all Arabs, when Turkey joined the Germans, would take part in breaking the Turkish yoke. Of some Arabs, particularly many of the desert tribes, this was no doubt true. How far it applied to the more sedentary Arabs who, he took it, supplied the Arab forces now operating, it was not so easy to say. It was reasonable to suppose that probably a considerable number bad proved willing to join Turkey now because the}’ had had it * S. 274.9 dinned into their ears that Islam was being attacked. Some of them might even believe the amazing stories that were told about the conversion to Islam of eminent Germans, including the Empetor himself.” 1 have the honour to submit a few notes of information which I have collected regarding the extent to which the Arabs have co-operated with the Turks in the Shatt-ul-Arab country; the considerations which have led them to co-operate, and the results to themselves and to the Turks of such co-operation ; with some remarks upon the position of those Arab tribes which have held aloof or tacitly sided with Ilis Majesty’s Government. 2. The Arab forces which took part in the recent operations in the neighbourhood of Shaiba were composed mainly of 4,000 members of various communities from Iraq and 0,000 of the Muntafik tribes from the country lying on the banks of the Euphrates and the Shatt-ul-Gharaf between Khamisiah on the south and Kut-ul-Aniarah on the north. The only other Arabs who appear to have helped the Turks on this occasion are a few hundred men of the Bani Hakam and the Bani Hasan who inhabit the swampy region adjoining Sukh-us-Shiyukh. 3. The Iraqis have had very little connection with us, and dwell too far away ever to have come under the influence of our Persian Gulf officials. The Resident at Baghdad has in all probability had little opportunity of cultivating their friendship or of making his influence felt amongst them, and no astonishment need be expressed at their having joined the Turks, which was natural. Of the Muntafik much the same may be said. Their country nowhere touches upon Persian Gulf administrative limits, and ! learn that no decided efforts have ever been made by His Majesty’s Consuls at Basrah to establish friendly relations with them ; in fact, they probably did not consider such a proceeding to be part of their duty, as it would have been regarded by the Turks with grave suspicion if not with resentment. It may also be remembered that the Muntafik land lies in the direct route of Turkish troops advancing on Basrah from Baghdad and in districts which have for centuries been governed or misgoverned by Ottoman officials. ' It would have been strange indeed had they elected to oppose the Turkish forces with, so far as they could see, everything to lose and nothing to gain thereby. The small tribes west of Basrah mentioned above, who know little of the British, were bribed or forced to give what help they could like the Basravis, numbers of whom had been compelled some months earlier to join in opposing our first advance, on pain of destruction of their lives and property and those of their relatives. 4. The conduct of the Iraqis seems to have been correct from the Turkish point of view, except that they occasionally displayed a lack of discipline and perhaps courage. But in the course of the engagements of A mil 12-15, the Muntafik showed clearly that their hearts were not in the struggle from any national or religious enthusiasm, but that while motives of self-preservation had led the. chiefs to take up arms, the common people were out for plunder from whomsoever it might be taken. On 13th April these same Muntafik plundered the Turkish encampment during their retreat after being repulsed by our troops, the ostensible reason, according to3 eye-witnesses, being that the Turks had promised them victory, whereas a severe rebuff was all they received. 5. In the circumstances detailed above, little need be said upon the subject of the Turkish efforts to arouse religious feeling among the Arabs of these regions. Such an aspect of the war has entered but little into the coiisj derations of the Muntafik, and the Basravis seem to be quite unaffected by it. The attempt to raise a Jehad has had no effect upon the large and important tribes of Central and North-Central Arabia, and I have not met any Arab who has taken seriously the supposed conversion of prominent Germans to Islam. 6. In connection with the tribes and localities referred to in this com munication, a reference is invited to the Gazetteer Map of Arabia which was compiled in the Foreign Office, Simla, during the years 1905-08 ; and I now pass on to some mention of the tribes further south, who have had more or less acquaintance with British officials, and have come more under the influence of our friends among the Arab chiefs and notables. First come the Zaffir, a large and scattered tribe who inhabit the country west and north-west of Kuwait, as far as Samawah. The Zaffir, who could probably Put 5,000 fighting men into the field, have throughout declined all Turkish invitations to take up arms on their behalf, giving as their reason a feud which exists between them and the Muntafik, but they have also been advised by some of our friends to stand aloof. The Yuarin, who dwell nearer to the coast in about the same latitude, and whose strength is perhaps from 3,000 to 3,000 fighting men, have also remained neutral, partly owing t° enmity with the Muntafik and partly to the influence of Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait, who has also induced the Bani Malik, a roving tribe who come from the left bank of the Shatt-ul-Arab to pass the spring and winter in Kuwait territory, to take a similar course. &lt;. lor the neutrality of the Shammar, the numerous inhabitants of the eastern portion of the desert tract known as the Nafud which lies to the south-west of Kuwait, and the powerful Umni Pair who dwell in the Summan tract south-east of the Nafud, we are indebted partly to the influence of Shaikh Mubaiak and partly to the skilful diplomacy of Bin Sand, the Amir of Nejd, who by organising a campaign against Ibn Rashid, the Shammar chief, and enlisting in his service the warriors of the Umm Tair, not only provided himself with an excellent excuse for declining to assist the Turks who were pouring invitations upon him, but compelled Ibn Rashid and the Shammar to attend to their own defence. There never was any doubt as to what line Bin Sand himself would take, but he might not have found it possible to induce his people to take up our cause at an early stage of the war, or to restrain them from assisting at our discomfiture had we suffered a severe reverse at the hands of the Turks at a similar period. 8. It is impossible to speak too highly of the conduct of His Excellency Shaikh Sir Mubarak of Kuwait, which has from the moment in which I informed him that war with Turkey was imminent been that of a loyal and honourable gentleman. He said on that occasion that all that he had was at our disposal and that he would be victorious with us or perish with us, and eveiythmg that he has said or done since has borne out the sincerity of his4 professions of friendship. He has written to every Shaikh of importance throughout the country, urging him to maintain friendship with and confidence in His Majesty’s Government, and the full effect of his efforts on our behalf will probably never he known. I conclude this report with the following extract from a letter sent by a Mr. Chandavarkar, of Malabar, to the Times of India, which speaks for itself:— “Arab merchants, followers of the Shaikh of Kuwait, on the Arabian coast, who come here for the purpose of trade, are becoming helpful in enlightening the Mahomedans on the correct situation about the war and the folly of Turkey in allowing herself to be made a catspaw of German ambition.” 9. A copy of this letter is being sent to Basrah. I have, &amp;c., W. G. Grey, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Agent, Kuwait.P TELEGRAK FROM - Viceroy. X Dated 12th. July,1915.

Reference to ('ox’s telegram of 24tli June. Bin Sand. Complete papers regarding negotiations go by this mail with Foreign Secretary’s letter. We have carefully examined modifications proposed by Bin Sand in the preliminary treaty sent to him by Cox for acceptance. These modifications are for tlie most part unimportant. Important modilications are: In Article 1, he omits words “subject to approval of British Government after consultation with them ” in regard to selection of successor. Cox thinks that Ben Sand will accept our wording or some other suitable phrase when our motive is explained. If, however, he refuses we think we might give way on this point. Article 2 as modified by Bin Sand reads. “ ni the event of aggression by any Foreign Power on territories of countries belonging to tne said Bin Sand and his descendants, British Government will aid Bin Sand in all circum stances and in any place,” thus omitting the word “ unprovoked and entirely altering the words “ to such extent and in such manner as situation may seem to them to require.” We think word “ unprovoked or some similar term should be inserted, and would suggest words “ to such extent and in such manner as may be expedient ” in place of Bin Sand’s suggestion. In Article 4, he adds that he will follow the advice of His Majesty’s Government “where his interests require it.” Cox suggests where his interests are not injured thereby,” and this seems unobjectionable. Cox proposes to arrange a meeting shortly with Bin Sand to adjust differences. We think he should be authorised to do so and to negotiate a treaty on lines above indicated, subject to ratification by Government of India. &lt;§&gt; V// From Secretary of State to Viceroy, Foreiyn Depart merit, 22ml April 1915. Foreign Secret. Your telegram dated 26tli March. Treaty with Katr Sheikh. It is perhaps desirable that this and any treaties with Hadramaut Sheikhs, as to which see last sentence my secret despatch Fo 57, 6th Novemhei last, should be accomplished facts whenever future of Arabia conies u]) for discussion among the i’owers. Hare yon news of treaties with Idrisi and Bin Sand. Ejection of Turkish garrison at El Bida is essential preliminary to negotia tions with El Katr Sheikh. Garrison has now dwindled to 90 men, but we cannot yet spare ship of war or men to remove them. Moreover, it appears undesirable to detach even small force at present from Mesopotamia for lids purpose. Apart from this it appears desirable that negotiations with Bin Sand should be satisfactorily concluded before we touch El Katr as El Katr question is intimately connected and it would be a mistake to risk estranging Bin Sand by any previous agreement with El Katr. Again it is not certain that Sheikh Abdullah’s position in El Katr is secured, and local conditions would require further investigation before we commit ourselves. Decline in arms traffic owing to war renders El Katr treaty no longer urgently necessary. These are our primd facie views, but we are consulting (’ox and will telegraph our considered views later.

X am directed to refer to your telegram No. 74-D. S., dated the 21st Janu ary 1915, and to your telegram No. 68-D. S., dated the 19th January 1915. 2. Arrangements have been made in Bombay for the residence of Sayyid Talib Bey referred to in your telegram of the 21st January, for the internment of Hamid Nusrat and Majid Nusrat, and for the residence of Salim A1 Khayyum the last three of whom are referred to in your telegram of the 19th January. 3. I am now to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of a memorandum by the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, dated the 5th February 1915, dealing with the two men. Sayyid Talib Bey and Salim A1 Khayyum. The Government of India will observe that in the opinion of the Commissioner of Police Sayyid Talib Bey is a dangerous character whose removal from Bombay is most desirable. The grounds upon which he has based his opinion are clearly stated in his memorandum and are entitled to great consideration. The Arab and other Muhammadan population in the City of Bombay have throughout the present crisis behaved with great discretion and loyalty to the British Government. It would be most unfortunate if, owing to the presence in their midst of an intriguing character, they should become restless or disaffected. There are a large number of Arabs in Bombay, and it seems wise that an intriguing personage such as Talib Bey should not be im mediately accessible to them. 4. The Governor in Council would, therefore, request that the Govern ment of India may be moved to issue orders for the removal of Talib Bey from Bombay to another station outside his jurisdiction, as for instance, Madras. 5. The proceedings of Sheikh Salim A1 Khayyum will be closely watched, and it is not improbable that through the influences which the Commissioner of Police is able to bring to bear upon him, he may become a sincere friend of the British Government, Copy of a memorandum dated the 5th February 1915 by the Commissioner of Folice, Bombay. So far as we are at present acquainted with the two men, Talib Bey and Sheikh Salim A1 Khayyum, we decidedly prefer the character of the latter. According to Talib’s dependents he is given over wholly to wine and women and was very corrupt in his administration. This estimate of his character is borne out by Arabs, now resident in Bombay, who regard him as a first class “ badmash.” Curiously enough Talib Bey is known to Sub-Inspector Martirosi of the Criminal Investigation Department, who spent two years in Basrah, and this officer reports that he is treacherous and cruel. He states that it was Talib Bey who had Colonel Farid Bey assassinated in Basrah, about the same date that Mahmud Sheoket Pasha was assassinated in Constantinople. Lastly the Pir of Baghdad has sent me a private message to beware of Talib. I think, therefore, on the information given above and on the opinion which my Musalman Criminal Investigation Department officers have formed of him that Talib Bey is the real “ badmash ” and that we should do ourselves no harm if we have him sent to Madras, where the Arab population is compar atively trivial I recommend this course for the further reason that Talib Bey is giving the Pir of Baghdad a good deal of trouble and annoyance. He turns up at the Pir’s house at all hours of the day and night and orders dinner for himself, even if the Pir Saheb is out. The Pir is afraid that he may turn up one day in a drunken condition and disgrace himself, and therefore the Pir also, before the Memons and Arabs who are on visiting terms with the Pir. As I have3 practically held myself responsible in the past for pressing the Pir’s “ izzat,” so far as a police officer can, I am not anxious that he should be worried by Talib Bey. And taking a survey of the whole situation I do not think it would be a bad plan to give Talib Bey marching orders for Madras, and let him live there. Now as regards Sheikh Salim A1 Khayyum, our impression is that he is a hot-headed child of the jungle. He is absolutely and strictly orthodox, praying five times a day, and is apparently perfectly content to live quietly! As an Arab he is, I believe, straight. In the hearing of a third party (not a police officer) yesterday he forbade Sheikh Abdul Rahiman to discuss the war or Gulf affairs with him. He has never seen a motor-car, nor a train, nor electric light and fans ; and I consider that we have a very good chance, if he is allowed &amp; to stay here, of completely exercising by friendly treatment any bitterness that may be rankling in his mind against us. I should like to try the experiment, and I propose to begin by inviting him to my bungalow on Sunday for an interview. He has left the house of Inspector Khan Saheb P. M. Taki, and we have taken suitable quarters for him in Paiz Manzil, Grant Road, one floor of which is occupied by a Criminal Investigation Depart ment Sub-Inspector, Sheikh Bahauddin, who is a collateral relative of the Chief of Mangrol. He and Inspector Taki will be responsible for A1 Khayyum’s education, and aided by local Mahommedans, who are well affected towards Government, will, I believe, be able eventually to instil into A1 Khayyum’s mind a clear appreciation of the value of British Rule. He is not, so far as we can tell now, likely to be in the least troublesome, and I certainly think we shall be able to make more of him, if he is left in our charge than if he is exiled to the Deccan and placed under the formal surveillance of the District Police. There is some grounds for thinking that it was on a report or information supplied by Talib Bey that Sheikh Salim was carried off by the Gulf authorities and sent down here ; and considering Talib Bey’s past history and the reputation that he has among the Arabs and the Jews of Basrah, that report may well have been exaggerated, if not wholly false. Anyhow the pair are at|daggers drawn— the only difference beicg that Sheikh Salim refuses to slander Talib Bey behind his back. I would therefore suggest that the Sheikh may at any rate for the present be left to us and we will try and make a pro-English Arab of him. I should he glad to see the last of Talib Bey, and so also would the Pir of Baghdad. • Telegram P., dated the 16th February 1915.

Your telegram 225-D.S. Regarding treaty Bin Saud writes asking either that another officer be deputed or that negotiations be continued by correspon dence direct from Basrah and not via Koweit. Position in Central Arabia is this : Bin Saud claims to have ultimately defeated Bin Rashid, but independent reports are that each has lost heavily and has returned to his headquarters, former to Buraida and latter to Haill; they are hardly likely to indulge in hostilities again for some time to come.6 I would propose now to send him draft treaty which was awaiting despatch through Shakespear together with Viceroy’s letter. In doing so I would advise him to sign it without delay and say that as soon as it is completed an officer can be then deputed to discuss details of second treaty. Even if he will not sign without further discussion, we shall have advantage of knowing in what direction his objections lie before deputing another officer. When the time comes Colonel Grey or I can go as may be most convenient at the moment. Telegram dated the £6th February 1915.

There is unaffected rejoicing at the British successes in Basrah and Gurna, while not a trace of fanatical spirit adverse to Great Britain is visible. By far the most potent factor, other than the personal predilections of the Amir and his family, in producing this favourable result in Wahabi Arabia has been the British Proclamation regarding the Holy Places. I was informed by some who were present that Abdul Aziz “ Bin Saud ” had the pro clamation read out at one of his “ Majlis ” in Buraidah when a large number of his notables were present, commenting on it as proof of British sincerity and drawing comparisons much to our advantage between the Government which, though of another faith, was prepared to bind itself by such a proclamation and one which had continually oppressed its subjects, though of its own faith, and attempted to proclaim a “ Jihad ” while allying itself to another Christian Power.

J can say with assurance that a religious war as hoped for by the Ottoman Government has no supporters irf Central Arabia. “ Bin Saud ” himself has already practically imprisoned a lurkish officer in Hasa, sent to him to help train his troops for the war, and is keeping India, Foreign Secretary’s2 / I four Ulema at Buraidah in what may he described as honourable confinement. These four men are of the Wahabi sect, residents of Baghdad or Kerbela and were sent by the Turkish authorities to preach a “ Jihad. ,, It will be evident from the above that the general .situation politically throughout “ Bin Sand’s ” territories is as favourable to Great Britain as can be desired. 3. Campaign against “ Ibn Rashid.” —Before proceeding to deal with ' Bin Sand’s ” relations with the British Government it will he well to clear the ground by explaining his present relations with his neighbours. “ Bin Sand ” in common with all other Arab Chiefs received repeated requests from the Sublime Porte to proclaim a “ Jihad ” against the British. The part assigned to him was the protection and defence of Basrah and Baghdad from any British advance in Lower Mesopotamia. “ Ibn Rashid ” was to have joined forces with the Rowala (Anaizah), Howeitat, Bani Sakhr, Sherarat and other western tribes near the Hedjaz Railway and moved on the Sinai Peninsula and Egypt, while the Sharif of Mecca, the Imam Yahyah and the Sayyid Idrisi were to have secured the Red Sea littoral and defended the Holy Places and other towns and ports in Yemen and Hedjaz. The plan miscarried for the same reasons that the attempt to provoke a “ Jihad ” has failed—the Ottoman Government failed to take into account the irritation its policy for the past five years has produced in Arabia, failed to foresee that combined action between the tribes would be impossible without some more or less lasting . composition of their feuds, enmities and jealousies and failed to realize that religious enthusiasm could not be invoked on the flimsy pretexts it advanced. The result has been that the Chiefs consulted each other before moving and apparently came to the conclusion that it would be more profitable to await events than to take up the Turkish cause. “ Bin Saud,” the Sharif of Mecca and the Shaikhs of the great Anaizah tribe in Northern Arabia decided to hold together and remain in constant, communication. “ Bin Saud ” and tc Ibn Rashid” had been on had terms since the summer and the former, having decided to open hostilities as soon as the season permitted, apprised the Anaizah Shaikhs in the north of his intentions and obtained a promise of their support against “ Ihn Rashid.” 4. At the same time he informed the Turkish Government that being at feud with “Ibn Rashid” it was impossible for him to move north for the protection of Mesopotamia, leaving Nejd open to attack, unless and until “Ibn Rashid” moved on Egypt. Having thus found a legitimate excuse for taking no action likely to conflict with British intentions in Irak, “ Bin Saud ” set about his preparations fora campaign against “Ibn Rashid” for the double purpose of keeping him from any advance Egyptwards and carrying out his original plan to crush him. “Ibn Rashid” is now of very small account, there are frequent dissensions between his tribes and he has not the power to control them, while some of them have actually transferred their allegiance to “ Bin Saud.” “ Bin Saud ” has collected at this camp some 3,000 to 4,000 of his townsmen, has the whole of the Umtair and Ajman Bedouin tribes within call and has issued orders for another 4,000 townsmen to join his standards within the next few days. His preparations are on a scale he has not attempted since 1911(?) when the Sharif of Mecca at Turkish instigation made his incursion into Washam. He will move within the week and hopes to find and crush “ Ihn Rashid ” before the end of January, unless the latter has moved westwards, in which case new plans will have to he made. 5. Relations with British Government. —It is unnecessary to recall what passed between British officials and “ Bin Saud ” up to the meeting he had with Lieutenant-Colonel Grey near Koweit at the end of April 1914. “ Bin Saud ” assures me that the three months’ time which was arranged for at the meeting at Ojair in December 1913 having been exceeded by a month and having received frequent letters from Shaikh Sir Mubarak-as-Subah urging him to come north to meet the Turkish officials, holding out strong hope of a satis factory solution with them, he proceeded to Koweit, feeling sure (as he had kept the Political Agent, Bahrain, fully informed as to his movements) that he would be able to consult the Political Agent, Koweit, before closing with the Turks. On reaching Subaihiya he was astonished to receive from Shaikh Sir Muharak-as-Subah a letter advising him to refuse to treat with the Turks and intimating that he himself would not be present at the negotiations as he t / 1 1 a 1'CT* A ^ had previously promised. Added to this volte face on Shaikh Mubarak’s mrt he understood from Lreutenant-Colonel Grey that His Maiest/s eSvermTuI S Z fSSaTC SiS £&amp; “s w- 1 ' ? = ; ’ LT 1 ' 11 •'•''“■J 1 * 1 *!; '''-''J.)-'' o«.r of mediation. There ^itt’em between him and Sir Mubarak-as-Subah which added further to his resentment with the result that he arranged with Sayyid Talib (one of the TurSsh Dele, gates) that the negotiations should be kept secret from Mubarak The negotiations culminated eventually in a series of conditions set down in draft for the sanction of the Porte and it was this draft which was sent to Constants nople Several of the conditions were flatly refused at first by “Bin Saud - but later he agreed to their inclusion on the express assurance of the delegates that they were required to save the face of the Turkish Government which however, had no intention of insisting on their execution. Subsequent^ &amp; Ss C °Stera 17 SramS and letterS Came t0 him from tte^rte and 6 Such was the position-one of complete political detachment from the British Government and offence with the Turkish—when about the 9 nt&gt;i October, “Bin Saud’&gt; received the information that Captat shakesp lr was being despatched to him.

I did my best to remove the apprehensions indicated above, but finding 1 that nothing short of a treaty with clauses categorically stating the obliga tions on both sides would satisfy him, and in order to crystalize what was in his mind, I suggested that matters would be expedited if I were enabled to forward a preliminary draft containing what he was prepared to accept and what he desired. To this he agreed, and I have the honour to enclose herewith an Arabic copy* and a rough translation • Not enclosed. of ^ draft «c Bin g au d ” thoroughly understands that this draft is merely an attempt to produce something more or less definite on which to work and that it will probably undergo con siderable alteration, some conditions being removed and others substituted. However His Majesty’s Government may desire to vary the conditions it should be borne in mind that “ Bin Saud ” has no intention of abandoning his neutral position with freedom to make his own arrangements with the Turks (and he is confident that he can secure from them, so to speak, a very good “second best”) until he holds a signed and sealed treaty with the British Government, nor will he move a step further towards making matters either easier for us or more difficult for the Turks so far as the present war is concerned, until he obtains in that treaty some^ very solid guarantee of his position with Great Britain practically as his Suzerain. Granted this, he can be relied upon to use all his resources and immense influence in Arabia on our side, not only in the present war but afterwards and to con tinue after its conclusion to have no dealings with any other Foreign Power | without first communicating with us. He begs for the earliest possible decision, for already his neutral position embarrasses him considerably with the Turks, and failing a very early comprehensive agreement with us he must in self-de fence and to avoid reprisals give some practical proof of his intentions to side with the Turks. There is no threat implied in this, for a bitter hatred of the Tu rks is almost an obsession with Abdul Aziz, but he recognises that failing British protection he must make peace with his enemy and at once prove . himself a friend—for him there is no half-way house. 9. I venture to submit that “ Bin Saud” in effect asks for little more than what has already been conveyed in the Acting Resident’s assurances, if these were meant to apply to the future and were not limited to the present crisis, and if they are interpreted liberally and generously. In exchange “ Bin Saud ” offers to make himself a British vassal for good. The addition to our responsibilities does not appear heavy:— (a) The Turkish menaces from the west and north of Nejd, though very real to Bin Saud, need give us no anxiety—we have no reason to suppose they will be more successful in the future than they have been within the last two or three decades, while guaranteed from attack by sea “ Bin Saud ” will be in a far better position to meet them than was possible hitherto; should they become threatening, strong diplomatic representations would probably suffice to prevent any attempt on a scale with which “ Bin Saud ” could not cope himself. (&amp;) We should probably be called upon to act as arbiters somewhat more frequently than hitherto between the Arab Shaikhs along the coast and “ Bin Saud ” a duty largely to the advantage of our own interests. On the other hand, the advantages seem to be considerable :— (a) Complete control of the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf. (&amp;) Similar complete control of the Arms Traffic. (c) The practical exclusion of Foreign Powers and influence in Central Arabia. (d) The security induced by British Suzerainty and “ Bin Saud’s” strong control of the Bedouin tribes will give a great impetus to trade through the Persian Gulf ports, probably diverting a share of what now passes through the Bed Sea ports.(e) The great influence “ Bin Saud 55 has over Mahomedan opinion in ] Arabia, an influence likely to increase as the Turkish Empire breaks up and the Khalifate of the Sultan is questioned, will be a British asset. {f) “ Bin Saud’s” influence with all Arab tribes, and particularly with the Northern Anaizah, with whom our occupation of Lower Mesopotamia will bring us in close contact. 10 . Khalifate of Islam. —Having referred to the Khalifate of Islam above perhaps it will be as well to explain that we have little need to fear an attempt on the part of “ Bin Saud” or his family to arrogate this title. The Wahabis only acknowledge the first four Khalifs and no subsequent ones. In a conversation with “ Bin Sand” I gathered that most Arabs other than Wahabis and probably also most Mahomedans had their faith in the Khalifate of the Sultan severely shaken by the circumstances of Abdul Hamid’s deposition and Mahomed Eeshad’s accession. The Arabs now anticipate a similar revolution with Mahomed Beshad and Enver Pasha as the principals, and should it come to pass that the latter becomes Sultan the opinions^ I hear/ expiessed indicate that the Khalifate will by the common consent of Islam revert to the descendants of the Prophet’s family in Mecca, of whom the present head is the Sharif and who I feel sure would command “ Bin Saud’s” support in such an event rather than his antagonism. 11 . Conclusion. —This report has run to a considerable length, but in view of the present favourably political situation locally, the instability of all Arab opinion and affairs, the far-reaching issues involved and the urgency of communicating some adequate assurance to £t Bin Saud ” at a very early date, I have felt it justified, more particularly to show clearly Abdul Aziz’s attitude of mind and the position from his point of view. The balancing of the responsibilities which we will incur with the advantages which are likely to accrue from the conclusion of a treaty on the lines of the attached preliminary draft rests with higher authority, but I would venture to reiterate the extreme urgency of the matter. “Bin Sand” is prepared to meet Sir Percy Cox in the vicinity of Zobair, but he will not move northwards until he has settled with “ Ibn Bashid,” and not even then unless the treaty which he desires has assumed a practically final form, which ^ . . P r ®P are d to accept. His reason is that he cannot take any further risk of in Bating the Ottoman Government unless he can be assured of British protection, having already pleaded to it that he could not leave his own terri tories. I would venture to suggest that probably considerable time will be saved, seeing how difficult communication in present circumstances is, if I were empowered, to treat with “ Bin Saud ”, the draft clauses acceptable to and what is not acceptable to His Majesty’s Government being communicated to me. “ Bin Saud *’particularly desires that these negotiations should not be 1 discussed with Shaikh Sir Mubarak as Subah, who has not now his whole confidence. ..... ■ • - j 12 .

Translation of a letter from Abdul Aziz-bin-Abdur Rahman-al-Faisal “ Fin Saud, ” to LieutenanUColonel Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated the 15th Sa/ar 1333 (1st January 1915). After compliments. —In an auspicious hour I read with the greatest pleasure your letters dated 29th Muharram (16th December 1914), 1 st Safar(18th December 1914) and 4th Safar (21st December 1914) 1333. I thanked God for your safety and was glad at your success. I was glad also to read what you wrote to me with reference to your success at Kurnah and of the capture of Subhi Bey and his comrades. May you always be successful. Next you wrote of what you have promised to me as regards fair dealings and the desire to do good and justice. As regards myself, you give me the hope that in consequence of what has come about by your occupation of this country we shall have cause for greater prosperity than in the past, and that our country will become secure from the high-handedness of the Turkish Government from which we used to suffer in the past. I am thankful (for this), and there is no doubt that you are the most just among the people and more appreciative of our rights and of those of the people of respectability. I always cherish (feelings of) friendship and regards for you, and do not think of anything which would be opposed to your wishes. I am convinced that you are a true and just people. As to my affairs, I shall explain to you fully after conferring with Captain Shakespear. Then, as regards my friend, Sayyid Talib Bey, who is like a brother to me, he has absolutely no considerations opposed to your wishes. He trusts in your justice and relies on the mercy of the honoured British Government, and he believes more than any other person in the justice of the Government and in its majesty and power. He has for a long time endeavoured to acquire your friend ship and to become a dependent of your Government. He had had feelings of friendship and sincerity for long past. When God willed the declaration of war between you and the Turkish Government, the latter Government ordered him to come to ine to try to bring about a reconciliation between me and Ibn Rashid, and to bring me out for Jehad. True to my expectation, he communicated to me, jhr appearances’ sake, the message of the Turkish Government, and (at the same time) secretly advised me that it would be better to disregard both the matters (i.e., the above two requests of the Turkish Government). His reason for so advising me was the enmity the Turkish Government had for me and for him, and also his regard for the interests of the honoured British Government. Thereafter I sent him my trusted messenger, Salih-al- Adhl, and (through the latter) compelled him (Sayyid Talib) to make the said matter (i.e., the proposed mission) an excuse for his coming out to me. This was expedient for the reason that he was in danger from the treachery of the Turks, as has already been made known to you, and also for the reason that he may meet Captain Shakespear, who in his previous letter had said that he was coming to me via Bahrain in order to consolidate (lit —bind) the interests of all c&lt; nejrned. No doubt after the meeting the said brother will explain the matter to you fully. Now we received with the greatest respect your order that he should come to Koweit, and we are convinced that our good and honour lies in^ obeying your orders. He has just left (for Koweit); may God lead him there in safety. He has come to an understanding with Captain Shakespear that he (Sayyid Talib) will remain at Jahara until your arrival there. I request you to meet him as soon as possible and to keep him in your considerate mind, which will be cause for my further thankfulness to you With the help and assistance of God (i e., I trust that) he will render you good services and show friendship to you. I therefore trust that you will consider his reply and his letter favourably, and whatever friendliness and kindness you will show to him it will be like showing it to me personally, for which I shall be thankful to you all my life. ^ No. C£.-35, dated Busliire, the 23rd January (received 1st February) 1915.

In two communications, dated the 1st January 1915, from this Camp, I have already intimated what passed between Sayyid Talib and myself, and I have little further to add. 3. “ Bin Saud ” is exceedingly relieved at Sayyid Talib’s departure and sincerely trusts that he will be allowed to remove himself to India or elsewhere far enough to prevent any further visits to Nejd. His visit on this occasion cost “Bin Saud” a so-called loan of £T 1,000 to provide Sayyid Talib with current expenses. The Amir desires to say that Sayyid Talib is not in his confidence and statements made by him purporting to represent “ Bin Saud*s ” views or sympathies should be accepted with reserve.

Beference your telegram No. 105-B., dated the 23rd ultimo. The papers in respect of the proposed treaty with Bin Saud have probably been shown to you by the Private Secretary to His Excellency the Viceroy. You will have observed that the following were the terms proposed to His Maiestv’s Secretary of State for India :— A. His Majesty’s Government recognises Bin Saud as the independent ruler of Nejd, Katif and Hasa and guarantee hereditary succession to his dynasty subject to acceptance by tribesmen of successors and approval of His Majesty’s Government. B. His Majesty’s Government are prepared to aid Bin Saud in such manner and to such extent as the situation may require in event of unprovoked aggression on his territories by any Foreign Power. C. In return, Bin Saud agrees, not to have dealings with any other Foreign Power nor to grant concessions to subjects of any other Foreign Power except on His Majesty’s Government’s advice which will be followed by him unreservedly. D. In regard to other matters His Majesty’s Government and Bin Saud agree to conclude jointly a detailed treaty concerning them as soon as such treaty can be conveniently arranged.r ft 9 Subject to following remarks His Majesty’s Secretary of State has approved them :— (a) Condition of acceptance by tribesmen should be secured in dynastic guarantee if possible but you will remember difficulty in the case of Mohammerah which this caused, and over this point negotiations should not be allowed to break down. (5) Presumably you are prepared to receive request for similar guarantee from Shaikh of Koweit when both Bin Sand and Shaikh of Moham merah have it. (c) The pledge in the event of unprovoked aggression should be worded in such a manner as to make His Majesty’s Government the sole judges of nature and extent of assistance to be rendered. (d) I should like you to consider whether this treaty should not contain a clause binding Bin Saud subject to eventual definition of bound aries, not to interfere with Bahrein, Koweit, El Katr and Trucial Chiefs. But I leave this to discretion of Your Excellency’s Government. On the clear understanding that any treaty agreed upon is subject to the confirmation of the Government of India you may now enter into negotiations with Bin Saud on the above lines.(6JJ . If If}.

Reference your telegram No. 69-B., dated the 16th January 1915. With a view to sealing Bin Saud’s allegiance to us the Government of India agree that conclusion of a treaty with him is urgently necessary. A detailed treaty however on the lines that are suggested by Bin Saud himself and is commented on by you is fraught with many difficulties, eg., jurisdiction over Moslem British subjects, boundaries, dynastic guarantee. Is it not possible for a preliminary treaty to be concluded somewhat on the lines of the treaty with Afghanistan to the following effect:— (t) British Government recognise Bin Saud as independent ruler of Nejd, Hasa and Katif. (ii) In event of unprovoked aggression on his territories by any Foreign Power, British Government are prepared to aid Bin Saud, to such extent and in such manner as may appear necessary to British Government, in repelling it. (in) In return Bin Saud agrees to have no dealings with any other power or to grant concessions to the subjects of any other power except on the advice of the British Government which advice he will unreservedly follow. (iv) Further the British Government and Bin Saud agree to conclude as soon as this can be conveniently arranged a detailed treaty in regard to other matters which jointly concern them.The Government of India propose, if you agree, that a treaty on these lines is advisable and Bin Saud is likely to accept it, to make recommendations accordingly to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. Ho you consider it desirable that we should make a present of money contingent on conclusion of treaty as earnest of our friendly intentions ? If so, what amount do you consider w T ould suffice for the purpose. Dated Kurna, the 9th (received 23rd) January 1915. From —Lietjtknant-Colonel Sir P. Z.

Let it not be hidden from you that some days ago Sayid Talib-an-Naqib came to me here at Buraidah. His coming is due to the state of Turkish affairs and to the high-handed treatment that he had received at the hands of the Turks during the last two years, and then to the arrival of Javid at Basrah, and the fact that under the guise of warlike measures the Turks started pursuing their personal motives against him—motives which it is difficult to explain except verbally at interview. Placing his trust in the old relations subsisting between us and his family generally and particularly between him and myself personally, Saiyyid Talib managed to secure a mission for himself from the Inspector of Turkish War affairs some 20 days before his departure, and this mission enabled him to leave Basrah and afforded him from molestation by any body. He is now in my company and we are proceeding to your side. I have received a letter from my friend Captain Shakespear asking me to see him, and I have written him a reply appointing a place for our meeting. On our meeting I shall explain to him matters which no doubt he will report to you and which concern the interests of the Arab race and the confirmation of the old relations between us and the high British Government. We still abide by our old relations and nothing will change our attitude but things that may be harmful to our religion and the Arab race. You are the best of people with regard to this matter and we hope from you every good. As regards the dealings of Saiyyid Talib with us and with you, they are not accord ing to what has been made out by mischievous people from motives of self- interest. The truth will become apparent, and he is one of the people who deserve respect and consideration. We have now arrived at a place called Mustavi, and have heard of your arrival at Basrah and of the occupation of the place by the British troops and of the just and good treatment and consideration you have shown to the populace. This makes me all the more thankful. As I have (at Basrah) my trusted people deserving of respect like Abdul Latif-al-Mandail and his family, I thought it fit to make this known to you. I shall be thankful if you will kindly keep in mind these and all my subjects belonging to Nejd and now residing in the districts of Basrah and Zubair. Complimentary ending.Enclosure No, 2 , Serial No. 4. Translation of a letter to Amir Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Rahman Al Faisal “ Bin Saud,” dated the 29th Muharram 1333, corresponding to 17th December 1914. After compliments —Your honoured letter of 17th Muharram 1333 has reached me in a fortunate hour here at Kurna, by the hand of our friend Abdul Latif ibn Mandil. I was very glad to get it and also to receive your expression of satisfaction at learning of our occupation of Basrah and the Shatt-al-Arab, and of the contentment of the inhabitants. Since then our troops have occupied Kurna. The place is conveniently situated for defence, and up to a certain point the Turks fought their guns well, but ultimately they gave up the fight, and nearly 1,200 of them were made prisoners, and altogether upwards of 20 guns have so far been captured from them. It is not hidden from you that the British Government had no wish to go to war with Turkey, but her hostile actions, resulting from the intrigues and incitement of Germany, were so intolerable that we had no alternative. But as we have explained to the people of Basrah and Kurna, it is the Government of Turkey only with which we are at war, and we have no object against the people of the country and the Arabs. On the contrary we wish to be their j friends and supporters and hope that under the British flag they will enjoy the utmost freedom and justice both in regard to their religion and their secular affairs. Especially in regard to religious matters you need be under no sort of apprehension. It is not hidden from you that the British Government has more Muhammadan subjects than any other Government, and you will have seen from the Proclamation, of which I enclose a printed copy, that we have expressly undertaken to respect and preserve the holy places of pilgrimage both in the Hejaz and Mesopotamia. As for yourself I hope that as the result of what has happened your affairs will prosper more than before, because your territory will become free from that annoyance and interference on the part of the Turks from which you have suffered hitherto. As regards your friend Saiyyid Talib, I met his esteemed father at Basrah and told him what was in my mind regarding his son, and it was to this effect. ITp to the declaration of war he did not cease to make claims to us which were not possible of acceptance, and did not agree to the favourable terms offered to him ; yet the British Government is forgiving, and though Saiyyid Talib has been ill-advised and misled yet neither the Government nor I, its representative, have any ill-will against Saiyyid Talib. But what I thought was necessary in his case was that, for reasons which you will understand, it would be better that he should not return to Basrah for a time until the affairs and the inhabitants of the town had settled down. A little later I shall be quite ready to see him and talk over his affairs with him, and if then his attitude is satisfactory and he submits to the wishes of the Government, I may be able to recommend his being allowed to return to Basrah on suitable terms. I hope by the time this reaches you our friend Captain Shakespear will be with you, and he will inform me of what passes between you, and you may be sure that they will be regarded by myself and the British Government with all sympathy. In the meanwhile, inshallah, we shall not fail to show consideration to your friends and dependents such as Ibn Mandil in Basrah and Zubair. Enclosure No. 3, Serial No. 4 . Translation of a letter from Abdul Aziz bin Saud, dated the 22nd Muharram 1333, corresponding to the 10th December 1914. After compliments.' —I have already sent you a letter informing you that I am on my way to this side and that I am awaiting Captain Shakespear’s4 arrival for a meeting as desired by him. I also informed you regarding the com t of Saiyyid falib Naqib to me, and his good intentions which are for your interests and 't in any wa/ opposed thereto. I formed you ^ ^ o»r meeting I would explain to you what it was necessary to explain. 1 for coming was to strengthen the foundation of friendship and sincerity and to explain the facts about the said Saiyyid for whom I have a great regard an m whose sincerity and right-mindedness, which is the result of his knowledge and friendship with you, I place confidence. And because the said Captain as n arrived here up to now, I am obliged to await him here as I do not know what time he might come. I have therefore found it necessary to send yon Haji Sulaiman Faizi with the letter and have asked to explain to you my own and Saiyyid Talib’s views, and I tell you with all clearness that Saiyyid Talib has been a friend to vou for a long time. He has also known my views and has con stantly warned me against the Turks and urged on me the necessity of relations with you and of friendship with you. Now as regards his intercourse with the Turks during the war, which was assumed out of fear lest his family and depend ents should suffer from their treachery and deceit. This will no doubt be forgiven him lust as he will not be forgiven if after your occupation of Basrah he be o-uilty of any act against you. Believe me that if he gives you an undertaking he will never violate it, and profit will accrue from it in future. He has in fluence with the chief people among the Muhammadans and Arabs, and he is one of the sincere people and I endorse whatever undertaking he gives you. It this suits you and you think it suitable to call him to Basrah and to please ms mind with what is suitable for the dignity of the high British Government, I shall thereby be greatly obliged and thank your kindness and my attachment will increase. This will give great satisfaction to the Arab public. They will believe that this act is an example for others. I request you not to pay atten tion to the talk of lying jealous individuals who had a good deal to do with him and me before. I request an early and favourable reply by the hands of the bearer of this letter. Enclosure No. I, Serial No. 4. Translation of a letter from Saiyyid Talib, Naqibzadah, to Sir P. Z. Cox, Political Officer with the Indian Expeditionary Force, dated the 22nd Muharram 1333, corresponding to the 10th December 1914. After compliments. —Let it not be hidden from you that two years ago when I, like the other Arab vilayats, asked for reforms in our towns (province), the Turkish Government accused me of being inclined towards your good Government. From that time the Turkish Government has suspected me and its mind has been poisoned against me. Owing to this, my confidence in the Government disappeared, so much so that I had to go in fear of my life. I had been communicating with your high Government before the declaration of war through Shaikh Khazal Khan, the Consul at Muhammerah, and the Consul at Basrah, and the result of the communications then held is not hidden from you. My communications with the British Government were held not only then but before then also, viz., with Lord x Kitchener when he was in Egypt. When the war was declared, and the Turkish troops in Basrah increased in number and the fighting was hot, they {i.e., the Turks) began to put pressure on me to collect tribes to fight with you, and they pressed me to do things which I could not do against your Government. They even compelled me to sign telegrams written by the Commandant of troops at Qishla, and he insisted on my signing them to (the address of) the people of Bahriyah and Ziyadiyah, which I could not possibly refuse. In the circumstances I found the best course was to go out of Basrah in order to save myself from their demands which did not suit my ways and view which have been in your favour from of old. I discussed this matter with Shaikh Khazal Khan, who alsq considered it {i.e., departure from Basrah) advisable, for the reason that if I had acted against the wishes of the Turks and dealt openly with you, my life and the lives of my children and of my family, and my property, all of them would have been in great danger and they would have killed me as they were in a strong position. Itherefore secured an order from the Inspector of the war affairs stating the necessity of calling out Bin Saud to fight with you. This order was dated 20 days before the time {i.e, before the order was given ?), and was the means j of my getting out of Basrah in such a manner that nobody could prevent me. This was before the receipt of your letter to me through Shaikh Khazal \ Khan. I left Basrah after having secretly warned the President of the Municipal Committee, some of the town people and the Shaikh of Madinah, Hamud al Mir Jabir, not to fight with you. I then came to Koweit ex pressly to see the Consul and to complete my communications (negotiations) with you. I had no other business at Koweit. The said Consul informed * Misunderstanding. I did not say i had ^(3 that you had sent me a letter* through wntten - p z Cox Shaikh Khazal Khan which I have not seen to this moment. He pressed me to stop at Koweit or to go to you to the battlefield. I explained to him my inability to do either, and let it not be hidden from you that if I had stayed on at Koweit or had come to you then, the Turkish Government with the hatred it had for me, w r ould at once on hearing the news, have killed my children and my family and looted my property, which is one of the greatest calamities and tyrannies, and is recognised as such by you and others. After thus explaining to him my excuse and these dangers, I gave him my word of honour that I shall never act against you, that I shall serve your interests now and in future, in whatever way I can, and I will save my children and my family and my property (then in the hands of the Turks) from their mischief. I assured that my visit to Amir Abdul Aziz Pasha al Saud was not with the purpose, as is supposed among the Turks, of bringing him out to fight with you or to oppose you but to escape from the machinations of the Turks and to get the said Amir to intercede for me to you, as I knew all about him and his good relations with your Government and his real mind and intentions. P’or this reason I left Koweit and came to the said Amir. The letter which the Amir has written to Captain Shakespear, in which he has explained to the latter that my views and intentions are in your favour and in no degree against you, will demon strate the fact that I do not ask him {i.e., Bin Saud) to do anything against you. All the statements I have made to you and my action from the beginning to the end, are borne out by the references and communications I have made to your Government and by my good dealings with the subjects of your high Government and with the Christian Community at Basrah. All this is not hidden from the Christian Missionaries at Basrah, and the former British Consul at Basrah, Mr. Crow, was aware of it. The very fact that I have never displayed any activity against you, either before or after the war, and the treatment meted out to me by the Turks, these (in themselves) are great arguments proving that I support your view T s and desire to be with you in soul and body. I am now sending you the bearer of this letter, Haji Sulaiman Eaizi, formerly a Basrah deputy, to represent me and inform you of what is necessary. He has been authorised by me to do all that is required, and any undertaking that he may give you in my behalf will be acceptable to me and wdll be adhered to by me. I therefore request you kindly to take him into your con fidence and admit him to a conversation with you, and also to give him a reply wdiich will assure me of my reception and which will be suitable to the dignity of your high Government and your undoubted good disposition. I undertake to you to serve your good Government and endeavour to secure its t Literally, one who should be shunned. interests in every way, now and in _ future because there will not now remain any tyrantf whom I shall fear.

Translation of a letter, dated the 9th Muharram 1333 (28th November 1914), from Amir Abdul Aziz bin Abdur Jdahman bin Faisal, to the Folitical Resident in the Persian Gulf and Sis Britannic Majesty's Consul- General, Bushire. After compliments and enquiries after your health. —We have received y our august communication dated the 14th Ehil Hijjah 1332 (3rd November1914), in whicli you state that your honour has already mentioned in your previous letter that the exalted Government of Great Britain has declared war gainst the Ottoman Government and that you have been ordered by the illustrious Government to invite us to co-operate with the Sheikh of IVIuliammerah. and the Buler of Koweit—our cordial friends and sincere allies—and attack Basrah and liberate it from the Ottoman Government, or come to Basrah and prevent any re-inforcements reaching it or Qurnah,’ until the British troops arrive to seize the place ; and you mention the liberation of Basrah and its severance from the Turkish dominions, which is one of our chief objects, in this connection, and asks us to prevent plundering of goods belonging to the British merchants in the town of Basrah and its neighbour hood and to protect them from damages and turn out the Turkish troops from A1 Hasa and Qatif and banish them from our town. The co-operation with the above-mentioned two friends is incumbent on us (and so it is for us to) use our good offices with our friends, the illustrious Government, in all useful actions which may be required by her. And I am using my endeavours and efforts in furthering the common interests of all friends. You should rest fully assured and be confident in this question. I am one of the greatest helpers to the Government of Great Britain and she will, God willing, obtain satisfactory results as we have mentioned to our mutual friend, Captain Shakespear. As to the Ottoman soldiers, we did not allow a single one of them to remain (in these parts) after our occupation and have turned them all out. But as to the following three matters by you, namely, the promise of the exalted Government to protect and safeguard us against the Ottoman Government by affording us her assistance and her future protection (to us) against any attack and hostility which may be made by sea, her recognition of the independence of my chiefship on all the parts of Nejd, A1 Hasa and Qatif, and the conclusion of treaties between us will depend on our arrival at Koweit. I am leaving my headquarters on this date and am bound for Koweit and we will make the necessary verbal negotiations in order that we may earn the approval of our friend, the Government of Great Britain. I hope you will continue to entertain sincere friendliness by delighting my mind with the news of your welfare and of the conditions of the British Government. This is what was to be stated and may you ever he successful. 7 Telegram P., No. D.S.-96, dated the 26th January 1915.

Mean while he has sent (then bev?) letters to me from himself, Shakespear and Bin Sand. All letters indicate Sayyid Talib has now become entirely submissive and realises that under the new regime Basrah is no plape for him. He is anxious to find heaven elsewhere unde^ British protection, tyjd suggests either India or Egypt. He begs (me) (to) medt him at Koweitdiscuss his future with him, hut I have no means proceeding\here at the moment and his presence in Shat- el-Arab just now would he very ipconvenient; neither does Sheikh Mubarak want him in Koweit. I have thei^fore written to him to say that he should leave Koweit by mail January Slsvfor Bombay. In any case he will be safe there until the question of his futurfe is settled. His elimination from this sphere would save us a good deal of difficulty and anxiety hut he will expect of course an allowance from us and I\ think that it will be necessary and advisable to give him one.

My telegram, 11th January, 39-B. Bull report now received from Shakespear dated 4th Jamid* Bin Saud between Majma and Zilfi. I extract therefrom following general information from Military standpoint. There was unaffected rejoicing at onr capture of Basrah ail I Gurna. British proclamations regarding holy places greatly appreciated and &amp;had has no support. Turkish plan of operations previous to declaration of war was as f(* )ws: Bin Saud and Bin Bashid were urged become reconciled. found olitical andSand was asked to defend Basrah and faint against British advance. _ Bin KtsWd and Anaizah were to join western tribes in advance on Sinai Pem Sharif ofSJlmam, and Idrisi were to defend Yemen Hedjaz and holy 1 Bin Saud, Sharif and^smzah decided to hold together and latter tribe promised to join in opposition ra^B'.n Bashid. _ According to reliable information from other sources instructions to Bm Sand from Enver Pasha were accompa^ by 10,000 pounds for his expenses. In reply to Turks he expressed Msdnability to be reconciled with in Kashid and pretended that owing to latter’s hostS^w he could not come nor at once to protect Mesopotamia and thus leaveltqd unpiotected but wait until Bin Rashid moved on Egypt; he thus ay^d co-operation with Turks and took a line which in no way prejudiced JintisH m^eiests. Bin Bashid has four Turkish officers with him hut no is m weak position and Bin Sand is now on his way to attack him and hopes, to round him up by end of January if he has not moved too far westward. ^ Captain Shakespear apparently contemplates remaining with him ace ing to the original instructions received from me. 19 Telegram P., No. 69-B., dated the 16th (received 17th) January 1915. Prom— Sir Percy Ccx ; Basrah, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Delhi. My immediately preceding telegram. Following is attitude of Bin Saud vis a vis British Government. Being ultimately disappointed of our intervention in his behalf in April 1914 he was obliged to come to an understanding \vith the Turks sufficient to secure his immunity from their aggression. His hope oi material support were somewhat revived by intimation in October 1914 that Captain Shakespear was being deputed to him with message from British Government, but without possessing a definite treaty with us he could not in any case have responded in a direct way to our later request that he should advance on Basrah even had there been time. Failing that, however, he endeavoured to take such a line of action as would indirectly further our policy without bringing him irrevocably to a rupture Turkey. Neither can he now commit himself any further until he possesses signed treaty giving him a solid guarantee of his position under aegis of Great Britain. He is already embarrassed by difficulty of his present position. If the treaty is not soon concluded he fears that force of circumstances may drive him to give some overt demonstration of his intention side with Turks. On the other hand, directly it is concluded he can be depended on to come off the fence and use all his resources and influence on our side. In order to expedite a settlement, Bin Saud submits a memorandum in which he sets down his ideas tentatively as a basis for formulation of a treaty. Following is a brief summary of conditions as numbered by him :— More follows. Second section of telegram. Firstly .—Bin Saud shall he recognised as independent ruler of Nejd Hasa and Katif with dynasty guarantee and free from interference on the part of any foreign power. Secondly .—Boundaries of above territories in all directions shall he deter mined and in case of disputes arising between his tribesmen andjothers under British protection decision shall be in accordance with ancestral rights.Thirdly. —Law of the land shall be Shariat law, according to tenets of the Sa*V- fr&gt;r*o %m\\ ft. ajj nmyhorftH^-halb seoU^ and Arabs living in his towns whether they be subjects of himself or others shall be amenable to local custom law. Fourthly. —Except with his express permission no foreign subject shall be allowed to acquire concessions and are to land in his territories either directly or indirectly Great Britain shall undertake defence of his territories from all external aggression and encroachment on the part of any other Power whether by land or sea. Sixthly. —Great Britain shall not receive or harbour refugees from his territory (presumably reciprocal). Seventhly. —British Government will treat his subjects in its territories with the same consideration as their own. Eightly. —In return for above Bin Saud undertakes to have no dealings with any other Power and to give no concessions except after consulting British Government. Ninethly. —He will protect trade within his territories and in matters of administration and business will accord same treatment as that which his subjects receive from us. Tenthly. —He undertakes that British subjects and proteges trading in his port shall be immune from any annoyance. Eleventhly. —He will prohibit importation of arms and ammunition pro vided he obtain facilities for supply of his own wants through the British Government. More follows. Third Section of telegram. Old treaty correspondence is not with me but the following additional points suggest themselves and I imagine Bin Saud would make little difficulty about any of them except (the) -°^^ 1 1 ty ' the telegraph. He should undertake. One. To receive representative British Govern ment either at his capital or sea port or both if desired. Secondly. —To agree (to) extra-territoriality for our non-Mahometan subjects. Thirdly. —To abstain from waging war by sea without our consent, and to co-operate for the suppression of piracy. Fourthly. —To protect pilgrim traffic passing through his territory. Fifthly. —To levy customs dues at rates which we consider reasonable, having regard to rate prevailing at Bahrein and Koweit. Sixthly. —To allow British merchants vessels to visit his ports, Seventhly. —To agree to locate post office and possibly telegraph office at his port when the time comes. I do not include any item regarding slave trade as that is not now a serious difficulty and has given us no trouble at Koweit. Only point regarding which it seems necessary to offer special comment here is the question of protection against external aggression by land. When we invited Bin Saud to move on Basrah we undertook to protect him against reprisals by Turks, so that as far as latter are concerned, what Bin Saud now asks us to give does not amount to much more. Apart from Turks, Central Arabia is practically inaccessible by land to any Power but ours, and I venture to think that we should incur little risk by giving the desired under taking subject to (the) reservation that aggression be unprovoked. We have publicly declared that our object is to effect liberation of Arabs from oppressive yoke Turkey. In this case there is no question of annexation of territory to which our allies could take exception, while Bin Sand’s weight in scale would be no mean asset to join cause of us all. Can I possibly be30 authorised to draft a treaty on above lines for negotiation by Captain Shakes- pear. I shall not now have the opportunity of meeting Bm Saud myself. I am obliged to give Bin Saud some reply by his messenger who ^ orders to return at once. I am sending Captain Shakespear purport of above additional points and asking him to use his discretion m discussing them with Bin baud. To Bin Saud I am replying that I hope that an instrument safeguarding his position can be arrived at somewhat on lines indicated ; that I ha\e e e grap - ed to Government on subject but that treaty must necessarily take a little time to draw up : that meanwhile he should bear in mind that Turks have been worsted at all points and are in a very weak position so that there can be no need whatever for him to commit himself now to any^ action on their behalf which could prejudice his position in eyes of His Majesty s Government and that it is of highest importance to his future interest that he should not do so Ends. lerSecre' Private.

Please refer to Foreign and Political Department’s telegram No. D. S.-191, regarding Seyyid Talib. I have sent a reply in the sense indicated. think we must contemplate allowing Seyyid Talib to return to Basrah, in view of strong advocacy in his behalf by Bin Saud, Koweit and Mohammerah, provided I am &amp; satisfied after the interview that he is really prepared to serve us and has abandoned his extravagant ambitions. If he comes here and proves troublesome we can always deport him, but on the other hand he may become a considerable nuisance to us as a wandering malcontent if we altogether dis appoint him now. Frimd facie I am disposed to the belief that should he prove sufficiently amenable the best course to adopt would be to employ Seyyid Talib’s services as a sort of Political Attache to myself to begin with, especially for^ negotia tions with those tribal elements as regards whom he is known to have influence. Under this arrangement we should detach him from affairs of Haufea, and we should be able to put his sincerity to the test •while keeping a close watch onliis movements. He might ultimately become, if he proves satisfactory, Arab Attache to the Civil Government at Basrah, or Baghdad and the Porte (?) as the case may be, for dealing with tribal affairs. The General Officer Commanding concurs in above views and in order that I may know in what attitude of mind to meet Seyyid Talib I beg to be informed whether the G overnment of India primd facie concur in the above. 36 Telegram P., No. D.

They with a number of Arabs, who are timid, faithless and irreligious have helped British troops to attack and capture Basrah. Curse of God and man be on such Arab traitors who have dragged in the mud the Arab name. A notice has just been issued by the British Consul at Lingeh and has been displayed publicly in the bazaars of the Gulf Ports and the Jezirat ul Arab. Notice states that British have taken Basrah after completely routing Turkish troops. The local population is excited and alarmed by these tidings. Already the notices have been torn down and I cannot say what the future holds. There is no security. The Consulate stands in need of protection.

It will be seen that the tone is friendly though guarded and that ce Bin Sand’s ” sentiments towards the Turks have not altered in their favour. I hear from other sources that Seyyid Talib reached &lt;c Bin Sand’s ” camp two days before my letter of warning of the 20 th November 1914. It is possible that the two men have discussed more or less fully the assurances conveyed to “ Bin Saud ” in the Residency letter despatched direct to him on the outbreak of war and I am inclined to think that a not improbable result will be an attempt on f“ Bin Sand’s ” part to obtain from us some further extension of those assurances. The subject, however, is one which need not be discussed until I have met the Chief and ascertained exactly how his aims and inclinations may have been affected by the war. 3. I have arranged to leave Koweit on or about the 11 th December and in the absence of suitable camels being obtainable locally have been indebted to Shaikh Sir Mubarak as Subah for part of my transport. 4.

After compliments — and after we are still observing the incumbencies of affection and friend ship and thanks be to God all our affairs are well and in every respect would please you. We have received your letter of the 1 st Mohurram 1334 (20th November 1914) and we rejoiced in your safety and what you stated we under stood, both regarding your arrival in Koweit and I praised God for your health and safety. Then I would inform you that your letter which you sent from Bahrain we have received it and what you proposed regarding the meeting : and if you intend starting our road will be the Um Majamajim (one) to Hafar and as for us this is the date of our leaving Qasim Inshallah and I cannot give you a definite date because affairs do not admit of fixing my movements (accurately) and Inshallah if w r e are (fully) aware of our movements we will let you know either (our message) will reach you on the way or it will find you at Koweit. You spoke of Seyyid Talib that when you were at Koweit that he had fled from the Turks and I think that that is not correct and if you and I meet you will ascertain the truth and his course is the reverse of what you think and as for me you know my hearty affection and I do not accept as true the words of the intriguer or adviser unless I find him (the latter) a good man and my efforts are only to profit my condition and protect my religion and my honour and you know that I am a person who (desires) to remain quiet and in repose so that it (my state) may not become impaired and but in these times of disturbance my friends among the Arabs’ chiefs may become » displeased with me (if I do not act according to their desires) so I can but sacrifice my life and wealth for them in all circumstances. And my hopes are strong in God and then in the Glorious Government (British) that the matter may be arranged as desired for the protection of the religion and honour: and please God when the meeting takes place the real objects will be disclosed from both sides. I hope from God, may He be praised and magnified, that we may agree upon what will be good for the religion and the people, and please God we are in regard to the others (Turks) as you are aware. This is what was necessary and salaam, etc.Clear the lind Frtm VICEROY, 2nd Feb. 1915 (Reed. 3rd) 1 Private. Since my arrival at Koweit letters have reached me frern Bin Saud Captain Shakespear dated 19th January. Former writes in most friendly terms (corrupt group) expressing his keen regret at impossibility of reaching Koweit in time to meet me, gratification at prospect of establishment of close relations, and begs me to convey his homage to H.M. Captain Shakespear writes to report that on 17th January a messenger reached Bin Saud with letters from Sharif ®f Mecca and his son Abdulla who acts as leader of his father’s forces. Abdulla wrote that he had arrived at Medina at the urgent instance of Turks, who wore pressing his father to mobilise his tribesmen and proclaim holy war,but that before/on such a course they were anxious to know wfettkai: Bin Saud’s views and attitude. Answering this letter in consultation with Shakespear Bin Saud is said to have urged Sharif to avoid compliance ©n the pretext that such action would onlyresult in British reprisals on Jeddah. Ho wont on to explain to Sharif the tactics which he himself had adopted for temporising wihh the Turks and assured him that he saw no advantage in siding the King embarking v withA( 2 ) with them. With this rep! „ clesed copies of our circular letter t© the Gulf Chiefs, our proclsumtion regarding holO places, and the statement of our case against Turkey. This meamure of cooperation on the part of Bin Saud is most useful and is as much as we can expect in the absence of a 1 treaty with him.

Dated Kuwait, the 16th November 1914, Sir, I have the honour to report all that has taken place here recently in connection with Saiyid Talio of B&lt; ^ran. 2. On the tenth instent the Sheikh's secretary Mulish Salih called upon me with the information that Tslib was about to arrive in Kuwait from Basfah end shewed me a letter from Abdul Aziz bin Selim, Sir Mubarak's representative at Basrah, announcing his impending arrival in company with Talib. A,.- , the Shaikh apparently wished for some message from me, snn as j I had no information regarding the intentions of Saiyid Tslib, I said that he should be allowed to enter Kuwait in order thetj we might hear what he had to say. 3, At mid-day on the 12th instant the party ailived, n shortly after one of Talib's men came to me and presenting his master's card said that Talib wished to visit me that evening at 7 p.rn. , but asked that I would write to Sir Mubarak asking for him to be sent over. The object of this manoeuvre not beinsr clear I sent for the secretary mentioned above, and j told~him that, provided the Shaikh had no objection. I wouldJ receive Saiyid Tslib at 7 p.m.4. He came accordingly, accompanied by Abdul-Aziz bin Salim, and opened the conversation by stating that the Turkish Government, after having made an unsucces -ful attempt to induce him to proceed to Constantinople, had directed h-iri to visit Bin *T;8ud and to try and persuade tha.t chief to rise against the Bri tish Government: that he had no intention of visiting him: and that he wished to place himself unreservedly in my hands. He further explained that he had only telegraphed to his men at Ziyadiah on the Basrah river directing them to oppose the British advance under compulsion by the Basrah officials, and that the telegram had reached them after they had allowed the force to pass without molestation; and added that he hesitated to join you at Muhammerah as the Turks at Basrah would be sure to hear of his having dtone so and would then take revenge by murdering Mb children and destroying his property in and about the town. h. I replied, that I could not believe that the Turks would go to the length of murdering his relatives even on abcount of his disobedience of their orders, and after some discussion it was decided that I should send to you a mess a e giving the purport of our conversation and asking for instructions as to S q iyid TaLib's disposal. This was accordingly done, a messenger oeing despatched to H.M.S. H Ocean M that same night. The following morning i visited His Excellency the Shaikh who approved of the course I had taken, and, as usual, said that he would help in the matter in any way that might oe required of him. 6. On the 14th Saiyid Tulib called upon me again and enquired whether any ansoer had been received from you. Upon rqy replying in the negative he took a new line, for which I was not unpre- pared knowing his reputation. He informed me that it would be difficult for the British to capture Basrah without his assist ance: that he had te-made heard from Shaikh Khaz’al that certain promises had been made to him in return for nio help, that he had not himself seen either the letter or the Consul at Muham- merah, but that in his opinion the terms upon which his aid was requested were not sufficiently attractive. He made no mention of having definitely refused to accept them, and I gatheredHO ■*&gt; that he had not yet had the opportunity of giving a formal reply. 7. I replied that in my opinion the terms were at least as goad as he had any right to expect and that I was not empowered to discuss them, and I impressed upon Talib the advisability of submitting to the arrangement which would ultimately be made on his behalf and which would most certainly be fair and just. See ing that I was not to be drawn into a discussion of terms or prepared to give any promise beyond that of personal good offices to the extent of explaining to you the difficult position in which he was placed, mg visitor withdrew. 8. This morning early the reply from you arrived (copy at tached) end I at once called upon the Shaikh who consented to keep Talib with him for the present in accordance with your wishes, and told me candidly that it would not be well to place full reliance upon his professions of submission and fidelity which was also rny own conviction. Talib came over to the Agency two hours later and on being informed of the purport of your reply recommenced to make representations regarding terns and was again informed that I had no pbwer to discuss them and was moreover surprised to find from your message that he had refused the friendly offer previously made. 9. At about 2 p.m. the above mentioned Abd-ul-Aziz bin Selim came to inform me that Saiyid Talib and his accompanying oarty of 12 men had decamped unknown to the Shaikh, and were now on their way to J ahrah and thence to Bor aid ah where one Amir Bin Baud is at present. His ooject in coming to Kuwait was thus made clear. Xt wa.s to sound, me on bo one poss^oility of obtaining better terms for his friendship than those which he had refused,and, through me, to obtain a further offer from you, and he has now cut himself off from all possible claim upon our benevolent consideration. 10. in connection with Saiyid TaLio’s escape from Kuwait the following points may be noted:- (1) He had been allowed to enter the town with mi approval I could not therefore demand his retention against his will without committing a. breach of faith, and for j similar)V similar reasons the Shaikh could not be expected to do moretthan urge him strongly to comply with your wishes. (2) He came here entirely of his own accord, and without any necessity or pressing inducement: had his primary object been to make trouble with Bin Baud there seems to have oeen no sufficient reason for coming to Kuwait first. (3) Supposing that his object is to make trouble with Bin Baud on behalf of Turkey he was perfectly well aware that every day is of great inportance to the Turkish cause, and at least five clear days have been wasted over this visit. (4) His ostensible reason for carrying out the Turkish instructions to proceed to Bin Baud was anxiety lor ! the safety of his children and property. I am assured by evpry person with whom I have discussed this matter that should the'Truks discover that he is without doubt a traitor, they would at once commit the acts of which he is so apprehensive. (5) It is considered to be certain that his visit to Bin Baud will any ease have no effect, as the latter has just replied with an emphatic refusal to a telegram from the Turkish War Minister urging him to patch up his ouarrel with Bin Bashid and join with him in helping the Turkish Government against that of His Majesty. (6) | It is just possible that Saiyid Talio being well aware of Bin Baud’s views of 'Arabia for the Arabs' may have some h roe of ootaining from him assistance in connection with his efforts to bring us to more favourable terms, in view of the personal friendship ■which exists between them. He aims, .apparently, at a similar position at Basrah to that enjoyed by Shaikh Sir Mubarak at Kuwait, one for which he is, needless 1 to say, utterly unfitted. 1 Sir’sir ..lubarak remarked to me this afternoon that Saiyid TaLio had j no'' every door closed against him. HLs excellency was not an xious for him to remain in Kuwait and I cannot hut notice that I'his very fl-d glad indeed to have got rid fcf him. His own view is that the Turks invited him to Constantinople in order to put him to death, and that they have now turned him out of Basrah. 11.

Sir, 1 Love the honour to make the following report in connection with the Amir Bin Saud rnd his relations with the Turkish Goverrm.ent. 2. He recently received a telegram from _nwar Pasha the Turkish minister of War urging him to abandon the campaign against Ion Rashid in which he is at present engaged and gather 11 the forces at his command to assist the Turks in the defence of Basrah. He refuser to comply with this request on the following grounds:- (1) He declines to renounce the operations against Bin hashid until the latter has been reduced to the position of a vassal. (2) He cannot come t &gt; Basrah being otherwise engaged, neither can his troops for the s*me reason. b. The present campaign against Ibn Rashid supplies Bin Saud with an eminently suitable excuse for declining to assist the Turks in the present war, and it is believed to do possible that he may have under taken it at this time mainly with a view to be in a position to plead a previous engagement when the inevitable request for assistance should come from the Var Minister. 4.

No. 74-13. Dated 29th (reed. 30 th) Nov ember 1914. (Repeated Bushire). Bin Baud. Please refer to Foreign and Political Department telegram No. 84-D.S. dated 24th November 1914 and the enclosures to Bushire letter which is referred to in that telegram. I was not disposed to attach much weight to paragraph 3 of the letter doted 9th November 1914 which was sent to Political Resident by Shakespear and I was confirmed in this view by a personal discussion with the latter. It was on the supposition that Shakespear would reach Bin Baud in time to prime him before the outbreak of war with Turkey that His Majesty*s Government authorised Shakespear’s Mission to Bin Saud. Shakespear was however too late to effect this and in order to be immune from Turkish overtures Bin Saud had designedly retreated very far away. Knox's letter of assurances was also received by Bin Saud late in the day owing, course to difficulty of communication but if latter inferred from its contents any such ideas as those which Shakespear suggests I confidently hope that the news of successful operations of British expedition right up to Basrah will have to a great extent discounted if not quite dispelled them. Shakespear came to Abadan to have an interview with me after writing his letter of November 9th and as a result of my discussion with him regarding the exist ing situation the best course seemed to be that heshould still interview Bin Baud, conXirm reports oX successful operations of British^We and explain to him that in consequence Knox's lasu letter to him was to a great extent superseded^ut that His Majesty's Government still depended on his help in direction inoicated in letter of Octooer 5th to Shakespear from India 0X1ice. I also gave Shakespear instructions to the effect that he had better for the present stay on with Bin Baud and keep him reasonably near at hand in order that should Bin Baud's cooperation be required in regard to tribes between Basrah and Baghdad I could communicate with himself quickly and fully* On Movember 15th in pursuance of this programme Shakespeor returned to Koweit. Bin Baud has not yet replied to the letter in which assurances were sent to him, but in any cane o. reply could hardly have had time to arrive yet and he might prefer to await his interview with Shake spear before replying.17976. 1. 1694. 10,000.- 11/1914.

Shakespear, I.A., Political Dept, on special Duty to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. In accordance with instructions received in London, I proceeded to Bahrain, reaching that port on the 7th November, with a view to making my way to the Ruler of Nejd, Abdul Aziz 'Bin S8,ud\ 2. I found awaiting me the letters of the which translations are enclosed herewith, from Aodul Aziz and his Amir in Has a. 'Bin Baud” himself was reported to be at Anaizah, a town nearer in point of travelling time to Kuwait than Bahrain; there was • e. further to oe considered the delay which must occur owing to th' necessity for communicating with the Amir of Hasa before ar rangements for my transport could be completed. I decided, therefore to inform 'Bin Baud” that I was proceeding to Kuwait and requested him to march north with all his forces. I hope that he will probably do this and that I shall oe able to get into personal touch with him in the desert somewhere to the south-west of Kuwait. 3. Pending the receipt of further news I am at present unable to state what will be the ultimate attitude of the Ruler of Nejd. His letter to me is friendly enough and from what I know of the man 1 think he will probably throw in his lot with us. At the same time I venture to suggest that it would have been better if the letter of assurances, e.opy of which has been forwarded to me, had been kept back and handed to me for personal delivery to 'Bin Baud”, It will be remembered that hitherto all 'Bin Baud’s' overtures have oeen cbldly received by us and nothing which/could regard as a satisfactory reply hs.s been voucehsafed to him. Now when war has broken out between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Turks we offer him all he has ever asked and inp vite his military co-operation. This sudden change o± front on our part may very possibly produce the following effect on his Mnd, viz: that the English now having gone to war with(f^r) \s't- Turkey find themselves faced with more than they feel able to deal and consequently are making a hid for 'Bin Baud's' help. However erroneous the impression may be, Abdul Aziz like all desert Arabs has already no small opinion of himself or his power in a conflict and any exaggeration of that belief may lead him either to use the document as a lever to extract more concessions from the Turks before throwing in his lot definite ly with them or if he sees that his real interests lie in join ing us to make further demands upon us of the nature, for ins tance, of those put forward by Sayid Talih of Basrah, His letter (that marked Postcript in the attached enclosures) will 1 think show how he has taken up a position on the fence with perhaps aslight bias in our favour* 4. 2 .propose to reach Kuwait as soon as possible and as soon as I can hear of some spot where I can be certain of meeting Aodul Aziz I propose to start to join him and en- dea.vour to secure his full co-operation*Translation oi a letter dated 4th Zil Haj (14tn Oct Oder 1914) Iron Shaikh Abdul Aziz Din Aodur Re^hman ai Paisai to Captain Shakesnear.

It runs as follows. It Is known to your honour that I as you know of the lovers and friends and I desire r approach erne nt with the Pre cious Britannic Government and after (when) we went to Kuwait after your departure came out to us there the Consul at Kuwait with a letter purporting that it had come to him from the Precious Government to the effect that they ordered him to inf,Tin Bin Sand that there was no (cause of) interference for them in the questions Between us and the Turks and that Bin Saud should himself deal with his affairs. At that time there came Talib and with him a deputation and there came about # between us and him agreements - in name and without reality it removed the evil and there .arri&amp;ed peace for the time being. And now we are as you know/ neither N* the frlendsAp^ the Precious Imperial Government nor*»#-the .foolpaps of the Turks lb' to the last degree to the last day of the world. And now your honour has arrived and I am seen oy the Truks with great hatred and enmity and there has come to us orders from them in these days that we should collect our forces and en camp between Kuwait and Zubair and orders have gone to Ibn Rashid and they have given him arms and provisions and many other helps in order that it be not hidden from you cither friendship with him and he is marching in to the regions of Syria but thank God he is incapable of anything. But they by reason of their hatred for us and their love for our adversary (desire to) raise up the dead. Accordingly we declared war upon Ibn Rash i/d and there were two reasons for that firstly to divert Ibn Rashid from helping them and secondly that by this there will be an excuse to us from ooeying their orders. They send to me and do not cease from sending to me that there should be peace between us and Ibn Rashid and ask me for help to them and I give excuses. Xccordlngly 1 i 0 — Ria(ih for the regions of Kasim in order to expedite the matter and to complete my excuse. When we received the news of your setting out from the Consul of the Persian Gulf I desired to letlet you know in order that you might th native out the test m my opinion tro' choose one of two alter that you should prepare an Arabic cypher and send to me its key and communications would be between you and me and you remaining in your place in Bahrain and the correspondence would be through the brother Abdulla Ihn Jalowi in Hasa in order that talk and gossip of the people and others be avoided until we know the result and be on the look out; this is better for us and more suitable to our interests for solving the affair. Let the state of people not be hidden from you but if a meeting is necessary and there is no^ excuse from it then you can inform the brother Abdulla to prepare for you camels and you should take a boat from Abdulla cl Qasaibi and it should be on the condition that your honour should change your clothes for .Arab clothes and give Abdulla an appointment so that he can have camels ready for you at (?) Tharan and rroceed before your arrival to me and no one should know of your setting out (or direction). The reason of that is to know the reality and that we should be on the look out. Jt you agree to what I have explained to you about a cypher then the communications will be uninterrup ted. But if communications necessary and there is no other way than v/e have explained if God wills the consultation will be between you and Abdulla as we have explained above and God protect you etc. Gd.

After compliments, We know well that for sime time the German Government has been endeavouring to urge the Turkish Government to. the committal of some action which would result in war between her and Great Britain and her allies. Now these latter Govern ments do not wish for war with her, especially the Glorious Government which is the traditional friend of Islam. Neverthe less owing to certain acts which the Turkish Government have committed and words which they have uttered it has now become necessary to the Glorious Government to make some military pre parations in her own defence: but she wishes us Arabs clearly to understand that she will not take action except in the event of Turkish aggression. Now the Glorious Government asks for good help from me and from you in her efforts to maintain peace, by our influence among our friends and relations and the tribes connected with us; and that we should acquaint the sharif of Mekkah and Bin Sha’lan with the German deceptions so that they may not be led away by false promises of reward or by lying reports which come from German agents at present. And the Glorious Government is sending to you Captain Shake spear whom all the Arabs know, that he may explain to you the objects of Government and her intentions, and she desires that neither you nor the Shaikhs on the coast will take any action even in the event of war, until the intentions of the Glorious Government have been communicated to you in detail”.II. 3 )L 5 Ls1j‘t62 irQiL oiL9,ikli olr Mubpraic 'to Bin Sa.ub d8,'tG(i 14'tli October 1914. %%%%% After cornpliments, May God keep you in safety.

You should read these words carefully and consider their meaning well. According to what I hear this war is entirely the fault of the Germans, and they are inciting the Turks: May God abase them both: otherwise my son they (Germans) will give the Turks entire control over you and .me and over all the Arabs, and you know the enmity of the Turks towards the Arabs. And God has f&amp;hewn favour to the Arabs and Islam generally by bringing the Glo rious English Government into existence, it is they who protect their Muslims in India and also our Arab Muslims of whom are you and your followers and I and mine. You see that all the Arabs are in God’s care then in that of the Glorious Government, we have experienced how they keep (harm) away from us. And you and I whom, please God, oTl the Ara,os wilo. follow must keep to our friendship with the Glorious Govern ment, if we do not help them we must at least refrain from interference and not listen to the ^seductions of the Germans. By following the wishes of the Glorious Government we shall find our own happiness, and we have to be grateful to them my son, since our help is not necessary to them as theirs is to us. Our comfort and welfare is from God then from them end may God never cause the others to reign over us who will injure us, namely the Turks and the Germans wno oreinciting them; and the Glorious Government and her allies are now gaining, and later, please God, the Germans will go altogether. The enclosed is the good tenour of Colonel Cox s communication it is also written hy the kindness of the ' Glorious Government to shew their good intentions towards us and all the Arabs. And obey do not want to fight the Turks and will only do so in case of the Turks declaring war or committing some act which will necessitate it. Then the Turks will go, and the English will rule over Turkish Worritoryu probably this will be the punishment from God for the Turks on account of their bad intentions towards (treatment of) the Arabs. Therefore my son, you and I must follow the wishes of the Glorious Government for therein lie our own interests to have regard to which is incumbent upon us.III. better from Shaikh Sir Mubarak to Bin Baud dated 14th October 19 1 4 ♦ f Jg After compliments, I send you a letter from Colonel Cox please Cod you will understand it and reply to it suitably.

Sir E. Grey agrees that it is desirable to en tertain friendly relations with Bin Saud. He thinks however, that unless or until there is a definite rupture with Turkey any steps in this direction must qCT 19^ t&gt;e made great caution, as it would have an un- fortunate effect if, owing to Turkey showing a more A Iff sU ,' v 6 h reasonable spirit, it subsequently became necessary I '1'^ Sbi/f l' ^ to withdraw from any advances made to Bin Saud.

(No. 893. Secret.) (September 30, 6 p.m.) YOUR telegrams Nos. 237 of 29th September to Cairo and No. 609 of 29th September to me. It is natural and highly probable that Enver Pasha and others have been in com munication with Ibn Sand, but I do not believe that the Ottoman Government seriously contemplate active participation in the war on the German side, although military party will go far in their preparations and probably send troops to Egyptian frontier, as now indicated. I would not [? group omitted : ? consider] such measures as necessarily hostile. ISir L. Mallet to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received October 1, 6*25 a.m.) Constantinople, September 30, 1914. (No. 899.

Resident in Gnlf has no doubt been in relations with Bin Saoud, whose good-will it would seem essential to secure, although it would be [? a misfortune] to allow him to suppose that we are in special need of it. During the early months of this year, when the Porte appeared to be acting in good faith, I deprecated an appearance of intrigue with this chief, but, in view of what has occurred since the outbreak of war, I think that we should be fully justified in entertaining friendly relations with him.2/o) 7 1 DRAFT TELEGRAM. 1) SECRETARY OF STATE TO VICEROY, FOREIGN DEPARTMENT.
