I have the honor to submit herewith the Annual ' Administration Eeport' for the past official year of this Residency, including that of the Muscat Political Agency, with reports on trade. 2. The information put together regarding the com merce of the Gulf is in its detail for the twelve months end ing 31st December 1873. In the somewhat difficult task of acquiring items of detail concerning trade of Bushire and the parts of Persia commercially connected with it I have received much obliging assistance from Messrs. Gray, Paul, &amp; Co. of Eushire, and from Messrs. A. &amp; A. J. Malcolm, merchants of the same town. The information received from different parts of the Gulf has been most carefully and industriously compiled and corrected by Mr. G. Lucas, Uncovenanted Assistant Kesident. 3. If Government are pleased to order these reports to be printed, it would be of much convenience for this Office to be furnished with some spare copies.report on the administration of the POLITICAL RESIDENCY. persian gulf. Administration Report for 1873-74 to 31st March 1874. Classification of the districts to he noticed. —The various Arabian Chiefdoms or Provinces, and the Maritime Districts of Persia which may properly be noticed in connection with the Administration of the Persian Gulf Political Residency can conveniently be classed or grouped as follows:— —That portion of Oman virtually or nominally under the Sultan of Muscat. 2?^/.—The independent Chiefdoms on the southern shores of the Gulf of Persia, from its entrance to the district of Kutr (Guttur). Srd. —The islands of El Bahrein independent to the same degree as the 2nd Class, but classed separately as being- of much greater wealth and importance. Mh.—The tract of Coast from Kutr to the Shatt-el-Arab, more or less held in subjection by the Turkish Government. bth. —The Coast of Persia from Mohammerah to Cape Jask includ ing the islands. 6M.—The British station of Bassadore (Bassiduh). 'With all the above the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf may have occasion to concern himself in the discharge of the duties devolving on him. Political Department, Establishment for Persian Gulf. —At Muscat resides a Political Agent who in political matters is subordinate to the Resident, but has independent Consular jurisdiction and a separate office. The Annual Report on the Muscat kingdom is framed by the Political Agent and forms an accompaniment to this. The staff of the Resident to assist him in the discharge of his duties consists of— A First and Second Assistant Resident and an Uncovenanted Assistant. Two Government Native Agents for the Persian and Arab Coasts and a confidential news Agent. In the Medical Department there are a Residency or Civil Sur geon, an Assistant Surgeon in charge of Bassadore, and an Apothecary. The head-quarters and office of the Resident are at Bushire, where a Residency Steamer is kept to convey him or his Assistants to different points within the jurisdiction as required. The Native Agents reside at Lingah and Shargah making frequent visits to adjoining ports for settlement of claims, giving aid to wrecked vessels, and so on.bushire residency for 1873-74. At Shiraz there is a Native Ag-ent^ who is placed under the orders of Her Majesty's Minister at the Court of Persia. This Agent being also under the Government of India receives instructions on some occasions from the Resident in the Persian Gulf. Independent Arab Chiefdoms. —The following- are the petty Chief- doms as you g-o from the entrance to the Persian Gulf, following the Arabian Coast to El Kutr (Guttur):— 1. Ras-el Kheimah—Chief, Hameyd bin Abdoollah bin Sultan; tribe El Kowasim, or El Joasim. 2. Umm-el-Keiweyn (vulg. Amulgavine)—Chief, ^ Ahmed bin Abdoollah ; tribe Al-boo Ali. 3. Ejman—Chief, Rashid bin Hameyd A1 bin Ali. 4. Sharkah or Shargah—Chief, Salim bin Sultan bin Suggur (Sakar); tribe El Kowasim or Joasim. 5. Debay—Chief, Hashar bin Muktoom of the Al-boo Felasah, a branch of the Beni Yas. 6. Aboo-Dhebbee tribe Beni Yas. (Aboothabee) —Chief, Zaeed bin Khaleefah ; The above are what are termed the trucial Chiefdoms of Oman, meaning that they have engaged to the British Government to keep peace by sea. The small seaport of Himreeyah may be mentioned. It is con sidered a dependency of Shargah, but latterly has revolted and joined Umm-el-Keiweyn. Its Chief is Seif bin Abdool Rahman. The principal duty of the Native Agent on this coast next to protection of British subjects and property is to prevent irregularities on the sea in breach of Treaty arrangements, and to report when such occurrences take place. During the past year but few cases of irregularities were brought to notice, and as regards their relations to the British Government, the conduct of the Chiefs has been on the whole satisfactory. Certain statements were made by the Native Agent regarding the Chief of Debay allowing slave traffic at his port, and these reports were alluded to in the last Annual Report. On further enquiry I found that the accusations were by no means substantiated. Disturbances on land. —The Arab Chieftains and their followers being restrained from indulging their pugnacious proclivities on the sea, they found vent for their feelings by engaging in eternal squabbles on land. In the early part of the period under notice the Chiefs of Umm-el- Keiweyn (Amulgavine) and Shargah were at war, subsequently the Chief of Ejman joined Shargah and Himreeyah joined the opposite party. 1 he Chief of Aboo-Dhebbee next engaged in hostilities against Shargah and made a night raid on that town.4 report on the administration of the The Chief of Shargah has succeeded in drawing on himself the enmity of almost all the neighbouring Chiefs, and has suffered a defeat with loss of about fifty of his men. The Chiefs hostile to Shargah allege that the cause of their displeasure is the want of faith of the Chief of Shargah, and his refusal to meet their just demands for sums of money due by him. // eather and winds. —The winter was unusually stormy on the Arab Coast and many native vessels were driven ashore and wrecked. In the previous summer the weather was unfavorable and many pearl divers are reported to have perished. Bahrein. The Islands of Bahrein have remained in peace under the continued government of Sheikh Esau bin Ali. The apprehensions which so long existed of intended aggression on the part of the Turkish authorities have disappeared, and the Chief has had ample leisure to attend to his duties as Iluler. It is doubtful whether he has used his ad vantages with ability to strengthen his position and consolidate his authority. It is rather to be feared that he relies a good deal for the stability and permanence of his rule on th'e support of a greater power, Vessels of war have frequently visited Bahrein during the year, and for most of the time Major Grant, First Assistant Resident, resided on the island. The survey of the reefs around Bahrein has been continued by the officers of the Surveying Schooner Constance throughout the year. Kutr {Guttur) Coast to Shatt-el-Arab. —From El-Bida onwards to the Shatt-el-Arab the Arabian seaports have remained under Turkish control. At Bida, Ojeir, and Kateef there have been usually Turkish garrisons. Along this coast there has been during the year no interference with British interests. Persian Coast. —The whole of the Persian Coast from Mohammerah to Cape Jask may be said to be now administered by the Persian Govern ment direct. In many places the hereditary Arab Chiefs remain Gover nors, as at Lingah, where the Sheikh also farms the revenues. But the Government of the Arabs at Bunder Abbass has passed away with little chance of the system being reverted to. Between Mohammerah and Jask there are three ports of some consequence, viz., Bushire, Lingah, and Bunder Abbass, and upwards of twenty more of minor consideration. Province of Arahistan. —From a point above Mohammerah to near Deelam the inhabitants are Arabs of the Beni Kaab or Chaab; and that district falls under the chief jurisdiction of the Persian Governor of the province of Arabistan whose head-quarters are at Shooster. Under him are subordinate Governors of districts, chief amongst whom is Hajee Jaber Khan of the Kaab tribe. Governor of Mohamrnerah, who has the Persian title of Nusret-ul-Moolk. This venerable Chief has been desirous of undertaking works for the deepening of the River Karoon in view to steam navigation as far as Shuster, an excellent project which, however, met no adequate support from the Persian Government. In Hajee Jaber's own district redress is usually readily afforded in cases of plundering vessels, &amp;c., which is not the case in other parts of the Kaab district.BUSHIRE RESIDENCY FOR 1873-74. 5 Khor Bazeeah, plunder of a native vessel. —At Khor Bazeeah or Dorak Creek a small native rigged vessel under British colors was plun dered about the 15th October 1873. On representation being' made to the Persian Government by Her Majesty^s Minister strict orders were issued for the recovery of the amount stolen and arrest of the offenders. Province of Behbehan. —The portion of sea-coast between the district of the Kaab Arabs and Bushire districts is under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Behbehan. The chief port of this district is Deelam. During the past year an Ex-Governor of this port committed piratical aggressions on Persian boats opposite the port and murdered the Nakoda of one vessel. An offer was made of the assistance of British vessel to repress the offender, but the Persian Government not desiring this, and British interests not being immediately concerned, the matter was ^left in the hands of the Persian authorities. The culprit appears to have evaded punishment. Town and district of Bushire. —The district of Bushire is at present consigned to the charge of Prince Assad-oollah Mirza, whose title is Naeeb-ool-Jyaleh, and who is responsible to the Central Government of Persia alone. Formerly the Government of Bushire was subordinate to * This is again the case since the the Governor-General of the Province arrival of the Hissam-el-Sultaneh at of Fars.* The district under the Gov- Shiraz as Governor-General. ernor of Bushire extends northwards of the town about thirty miles and towards the south along the coast about a hundred miles. Inland it reaches the hills. Bushire is the principal port of soilthern Persia, and the commercial community, European and Natives, is more numerous and influential than at any other of the southern ports. The head-quarters and permanent office of the British Political Resident are established here. An Agent from the Persian Foreign Office resides at Bushire, and is the medium of communication between foreign officials and the higher local Persian authorities. At Bushire there is a Consul for the Netherlands and a Consul for Turkey. The local civil suits and complaints of various sorts which are brought to the British Residency at Bushire are numerous. When pos sible these are disposed of on the spot, but when that is not practicable, and when Persian officials hold different views from the Resident, appeal has to be made to the capital and, when necessary, the support of Her Majesty's Minister is solicited. A case of some importance with regard to shipping interests occurred at Bushire during the year under review. A British steamer was found to be on fire on the roads and had to discharge her cargo, most of which was for Busrah. The Governor of Bushire preferred a claim first for one-third of the whole cargo as salvage. Secondly, for customs duty on all the cargo landed temporarily for safety and subsequently re-shipped. The case having been referred to Her Majesty's Minister and the Persian Government, both claims were eventually disallowed.6 KEPORT ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE It mig-ht be a case for consideration whether the terms of the Russian Treaty of Turkomanchai sufficiently and implicitly provide for the proper assistance to British ships which may happen to be in distress or become wrecks on the Coast of Persia. The district of Bushire in common with all Southern Persia has been infested with bands of robbers whom the local authorities have proved wholly unable to repress. On one occasion a British Naval Officer was robbed and wounded by one of these g-angs near Bushire. Notwithstand ing many sincere efforts the Governor has been powerless to bring the culprits to justice. The Prince Governor and the Foreign Agent have during the past year evinced every desire to meet the wishes of British officials, and friendly and courteous relations have been uniformly maintained. As far as Deyyer extends the Coastal District of Dashtestan, which is under Bushire. i^ast of that point to Bunder Abbass the various ports and sea-coast districts are immediately governed by Sheikhs of Arab extraction who are, however, all subordinate, directly or indirectly, to the Governor-General of Ears. Congoon and Islands. —The chief ports are Congoon; Chief, Muzkoor- bin Jabbarah, who also has charge of the islands of Sheikh Shoeyb and Hinderabee. NaJcheeloo. —Chief, Sheikh Kadhem, directly under Lar, a district of the Province of Fars. Cheeroo and Kalat, Chief Abdoollah bin Mahomed, also under Lar. Charek and ike Island of Keyss or Geyss. —The local Chief of Charek is Mahomed Hassan, who also is in charge of Keyss Island, He holds under the Governor of Lar. Moghoo. —The local Chief at Moghoo is Sultan bin Hossein of the A1 Soudan, who is again subordinate to Moostafa Khan of Bustuk. Ling ah. —Lingah is governed by Sheikh Khaleefah bin Saeed of the tribe Ll-Kawasim or Joasim holding under the Government of Fars. A Government native Agent resides here. Bunder Abbass and Kishm. —The last of the Persian ports is Bunder Abbass,^ which is farmed by Aga Ahmed Shah. The former Governor Hajee Ahmed Khan, once Wuzeer at Muscat, has proceeded to Teheran in hopes of being re-nominated Governor of Bander Abbass. The ( hief of the town of Kishm opposite Bunder Abbass, and which is situated east end of a long island is nominally under Bunder Abbass which in turn is subordinate to Fars. The coast district nominally under Bunder Abbass extend to a point beyond Cape Jask. Along this line of coast one of the chief duties of the Native Agent is to induce the Sheikhs to give proper aid to British craft in distress and prevent the natives from plundering such vessels according to their usual custom. In March a British barque went ashore on the island of Sheikh Shoeyb and became a wreck. The presence of a Residency Moonshee on the spot prevented the vessel being entirely plundered, and the Native Agentbushire residency for 1873-74. 7 having arrived from Lin^ah is engaged in rendering assistance to the Captain and in arranging terras with the Chief of Congoon. On the Persian Coast every attention has been paid to the protection of British interests by the Agent and all concerned. Not having the power of directly acting for the suppression of irregularities on the Persian Coast when they occur, redress is usually more tardily and with more trouble obtained than on the Arab Coast. Bassidore. —The British station of Bassidore has during the past year been under supervision of Assistant Surgeon Abdool Raheera. A guard of Her Majesty^s 21st Native Infantry is quartered here. The health has been good and everything has gone on satisfactorily. The pier having fallen into bad repair it is proposed to repair it. The Chief of Kishra at a time caused sorae petty annoyance in regard to supplies, but these com plaints have been removed. Shiraz Agency and routes of Southern Persia. —The affairs of Shiraz are not properly within the jurisdiction of the Resident, Persian Gulf, but as much correspondence passes between the Resident and Native Agent at Shiraz concerning the commercial affairs of British subjects, it may net be out of place to report briefly concerning the said Agency. The town of Shiraz itself and the roads between it and Bushire have been extremely unsettled. Robberies have been common and trade much suspended. The Agent has had full occupation in endeavouring to obtain payment of certain outstanding claim of British subjects and appears to do his best. The exaction of toll or transit duties on British merchandize has been a constant subject of complaint and is still under reference. The roads from Bunder Abbass to Kerman also have been unsafe at times for caravans, and a large body of marauders at one time appeared near Bunder Abbass itself. During the severity of winter the robbers kept quiet, too well off apparently to be obliged to expose themselves to the rigorous cold. As the weather became milder they have reappeared on the scene. It is, however, hoped that a change of Governors at Shiraz will result in check ing these proceedings. Everywhere in South Persia the rainfall has been abundant and the crops of cereals unusually abundant. With a return of prosperity it is to be hoped a more settled state of affairs will prevail. Medical. —Under control of the Civil Surgeon a dispensary is kept open at Bushire for the relief of the poor. This boon is much prized by the natives, and if there was an arrangement for treatment of indoor patients, the results would be still more satisfactory than at present. The Civil Surgeon's Annual Report has been submitted separately. Postal. —There are British Post Oflices established at Bushire, Lingah, and Bunder Abbass, which work satisfactorily and are a great advantage to the trading classes.in flu ihiiiii i i mm ii m iniiiiii Mi iiPCiTi&lt;fffnwFiiifn ii o report on the administration of the It was suggested to establish a Post Office also at Bahrein, but the Postal Department did not consider this advisable. Famine Belief Fund. —The local Committee for relief of sufferers from the famine of 1871 have, in accordance with the desire of the Central Committee of London, closed their proceedings and accounts. Slave-trade. —The year 1873 is memorable in the annals of slavery for the mission of Sir Bartle Frere to Zanzibar and Muscat. The pro ceedings at Muscat will be found detailed in the Political Agent's report. One of the measures taken by Government in connection with the suppression of slave dealing was the issue of proclamations warning British subjects of the penalties incurred by engaging in this traffic. The orders of Government to give the widest publicity to these proclama tions were carefully carried out, and wherever British subjects reside in the Persian Gulf effective steps were taken to make them aware of the intentions of Government. Copies of the proclamations also have been posted at the Custom Houses and in conspicuous spots at each port of importance with permission of the local Chiefs or Governors. The various Arab Sheikhs have acted up to their engagements regarding the traffic during the year. Affairs of Nejd and Turkish occupation of El Aha. —It was stated at the close of the last Annual Report submitted from this Residency that certain negotiations had been opened between Saood bin Feysul and the Turkish authorities of Baghdad. In connection with this negotia tion the younger brother of Saood proceeded to Baghdad. Nothing has resulted, however, beyond the detention of Abdool Rahman bin Fevsul at Baghdad. Saood has maintained a position of superiority over his brother Abdoollah, but has made no attempts against the Turkish force. Saood lias resided chiefly at Reeadh, the capital of Nejd, and has the majority of the Arabs on bis side, but the feeling in his favor is not as yet univer sal, some adhering to the brother. Whether the Turks have any con siderable number of Arabs as friends is doubtful. Saood distressed at the treacherous arrest of his brother appealed to British authority, but it was evidently not a matter for interference. Affairs of During the past year Abdoollah has mostly resided near Koweit, and communications have passed between him and the Turkish authorities, who endeavoured to entice him to Baghdad. Preferring, however, the freedom of the desert Abdoollah sent his^confi- dential slave Mahboob (a well known name) to Baghdad. Nothing appears to have come of this either. During the summer and autumn of 1873 some activity prevailed as regards the Turkish army of Lahsa. Regiments were relieved and fresh ones sent. Attempts were made to establish regular steam communica^ tion between Busrah, Kuteef, Bahrein and other adjacent ports. The Turkish Pasha also endeavoured to open relations with the independ ent Arab Chiefs of Oman, to whom letters were addressed inviting13 bushire residency for 1873-74. 9 them to communicate their wishes and visit the Pasha. The Chiefs however failed to appreciate these friendly offers. At Lahsa itself the Turkish troops were inactive as concerns any onward progress. Sickness carried off a good many. The resident Arabs complained loudly of oppression on the part of Turkish officials and soldiery. Recently a change has come on the policy of Turkey as regards Nejd. All intention of onward conquest from their side is abandoned; not only so, but it was determined to withdraw the regular troops and hold Lahsa on a different system. Instead of a Turkish Pasha an Arab Sheikh, named Bezeeah bin Areyr, of the tribe Beni KhaMd, was nomi nated Civil Governor of Lahsa. A guard of ' Gendarmes' or armed police are to assist the new Governor, but the object is evidently to rely mainly on the friendly Arabs of the Beni Khalid tribe for the mainte nance of the position. Since the official year closed these measures have been actually carried out and the Turco-Wahabee question has passed jnto a new phase tending to diminution of Turkish influence and power in that province.

Collection of Statistics. —It has been so frequently brought to notice that the means do not exist of obtaining accurate or reliable information regarding the statistics of trade of the Persian Gulf, either on the Persian or Arabian side, that it is almost needless to repeat the statement. The system everywhere obtaining of managing the Custom Houses, and the absence of official returns accessible to the public readily account for this difficulty. All that can be expected is a collection of as many facts and as close an approximation to the real truth as circumstances admit. Without assistance from those who, though of the unofficial class, are practically interested in estimating commerce, it would be difficult to obtain much information of value. My obligations in this respect to gentlemen residing in Bushire are elsewhere mentioned. Divisions of the trade. —The sea-borne traffic of the Persian Gulf may be considered as branching in three divisions— \st. other countries. The through commerce between Turkish Arabian Ports and Gulf. Ind.—The trade with the Arabian portion of the Coast of theAU REPORT ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE 3rd. —That of the Persian Coast, With the first class this report is not concerned, and will have only to deal with the Persian and independent Arab Coasts. It may however be requisite to make a few observations on the trade with the interior of Persia in so far as that is connected with the ports of the southern coast. Class of vessels. —-The vessels conducting- the Arabian trade of the Gulf may be divided into three classes (1) steamer: (2) square rifled vessels; (3) native craft. W 1 ^ Steam communication.—Stevixn communication with the Persian Gulf once started has rapidly increased. Its progress has been frequently made the subject of report by the late Resident. The mail steamers are fortnightly. In the year 1873 monthly communication was established with London through the Suez Canal. The occasional steamere uncon- nected with the British India Steam Navigation Company which visit the Gulf are few in number. Turkish steamers traverse the'Persian Gulf, but m connection almost exclusively with Turkish territory. European Ships. The visits of square rigged vessels to the upper pait of the Gulf are not frequent. Yearly cargoes are run from Batavia. 1 he native vessels run everywhere and distribute goods to all parts of the Gulf. 1 Chief Ports. The chief ports and centres of trade in the Gulf are Bushire, Lingah, Bunder Abbass, and Bahrein. Bushire and Lin&lt;»-ah chiefly supply the province of Fars and are the great ports of exit for^its surplus produce. Ihe trade of these parts is however connected with that ot a large portion of Persia, at least as far ar Teheran and Yezd and indnectly as far as Khorasan. Bunder Abbass is the natural port of the rovince of Kerman, and the ramifications of its business extend up wards to Yezd and Khorasan. &gt; Bahrein is conveniently situated to be an entrepot for the Arabian trade, and is much used as such. The commercial importance of these islands is not inconsiderable. All the ports which have been mentioned are ports of call for the mail steamers. It would be tedious and perhaps of little use to endeavour to estimate the resources of all the smaller ports of the Persian side. Their trade is active enough, and the exports as from the ports of the Beni Kaab in wool, ghee, and grain are considerable. &gt; A portion of these, however, and the chief articles of import, piece goods for example, are included in the Returns of the chief ports. Moliarnmerah has doubtless a large and important trade, but it is not intended at present to attempt to estimate it. The other ports of the Perso-Arab district are Bunder Mashoor Hindu]an, and Dorakee, &amp;c. ^Commercml Classes. —On the Persian side commerce is conducted by Europeans, Persians, Armenians, Arabs, Jews, Khojahs, Hindoos.bushire residency for 1873-74. On the Arabian Coast trade is almost exclusively in the hands of the Hindoo and Khojah communities. In Persia the merchants who have acquired great wealth are few, and with increased competition the number would scarcely increase. The famine of 1871 caused the failure of many cloth merchants of Bushire. Trade between the Persian Gulf and India. —In previous reports statements drawn up from the records of the Custom Houses of Cal cutta, Bombay, and Sind have been submitted showing- the value of the import and export trade between those parts and the Persian Gulf. The latest of these was for the year 1868-69. Through the courtesy of the Collectors of Customs at the above Indian ports I have received similar information for the year 1869-70 to 1872-73 inclusive. This information is exhibited in the annexed Tables marked A., B., C. It must be borne in mind that the figures include the trade with Muscat. Calcutta in former years drew large supplies of salt from the south coast of Persia through Muscat. This trade appears to have decreased from causes which it is probable are well known to the Depart ment of Revenue and Commerce. The aggregate imports to Calcutta have decreased nearly by one-half in four years. The exports from Calcutta to the Gulf have kept tolerably steady for the same period and show latterly a slight increase. The chief articles being grain, indigo, silk, raw and manufactured. The Bombay trade with the Persian Gulf import and export has steadily decreased for four years. The same remark applies to the trade with Sind. Taking the aggregate of the three ports the total Imports from the Gulf for 1869-70 are ... ... Rs. 1,38,88,437 Ex P orts ... ... ... ... „ 1,38,25,373 are- The equality being remarkable. For the year 1872-73 the figures Imports from Gulf Exports Rs. 86,68,573 „ 1,28,75,698 The produce of Persia in Oman being less in the latter year. The total value of the trade between these three ports of India and the Gulf was— For 1869-70 1872-73 Decrease Rs. 2,77,13,810 „ 2,14,44,721 62,69,089report on the administration of the No similar Returns are available for these years for an estimate of trade with Java, Sing-apoor, Mauritius, &amp;c. In the year 1866 Colonel Pelly estimated the Gulf trade at £5,000,000 Sterling as follows : To and from Bombay, Madras, and Calcutta Singapoor and Mauritius Kurrachee and Red Sea Total £3,000,000 1,500,000 600,000 £5,000,000 The famine of 1871 carrying off untold numbers in Persia of course greatly affected trade for the time. It is also to be remarked that a direct trade has sprung up between the Gulf and England. Some information as to this latter trade and that with Batavia may be gleaned from the Tables in the Appendices showing particulars of the exports and imports of Bushire, &amp;c.

Vide Tables G., H., I., and J., K., L.* Productions of South Persia. Cereals—In the districts bordering the sea, cereals are grown in considerable quantities and of excellent quali ties. In the neighbourhood of Bunder Abbass wheat is grown as fine as any in the world, it is said. Since the famine year the export of orain has been interdicted. Cotton—1l\\ q export trade in cotton is stated to be capable of o-reat development. This was shown during the American civil war when the export rose from next to nothing to 100,000 bales annually. At present owing to difficulties of transit, &amp;c., the rate of duty is prohibitory, the chance of profit being insufficient to induce merchants to operate. ^ It is considered that with greater management and facilities a large trade would spring up in cotton, and consequently that it would be a wise measure for the Persian Government to reduce the export duty in this article until improved communications are established, or even to abolish duty. The increased export would make a proportionate return of imports which would be the source of enhanced revenue.BUSHIRE RESIDENCY FOR 1873-74. 13 There are probably other articles of export and import to which analogous remarks would apply. Such considerations have, however, as yet little weight with Persian officials. Opium. —Persian opium is grown in Khorasan and the districts about Yezd and Ispahan, whence it is brought to Bushire and Bunder Abbass for export to China and England. The trade has in recent times assumed considerable proportions. The quality is good, but it is said that adulteration is now so extensively practised as to bid fair to check the trade with China, unless the Persian authorities take measures to prevent fraud. Carpets. —Export of carpets is said to be on the increase and less wool is exported in consequence. ♦ Specie. —It is noticeable that the quantity of specie exported is much in excess of imports. This has been the case for the last century I am given to understand, and to this fact many merchants attribute the exhaustion of commerce. The inconvenience of the want of money has been very much felt, transactions being in consequence suspended or effected by barter. Increased productions would probably remedy this evil. Imports. Piece Goods. —The imports of piece goods at Bushire during the year 1873 are estimated at about 17^ lakhs of rupees. This branch of trade is chiefly in the hands of British merchants, who have pushed it, in spite of disadvantages and discouragements, with great success. This result is due to their energy and perseverance. The prospects of the trade have interest, as a competition with northern routes has long existed and the contest may still be renewed. The goods of this descrip tion formerly reached Central Persia by Tabreez and Teheran. Recently the southern route has obtained the preference, but improved communica tion in the north would again give great advantages to the north. Indigo. —Imports of indigo from Bengal have decreased owing to decrease of means, the inhabitants use more of the inferior quality from Sind. Sugar. — The imports of sugar have decreased in late years. Batavia has now the preference over Mauritius, Siam, and Bengal. Trade of Lingah. —The trade of Lingah has not so close a bearing on the general commerce of Persia as that of Bushire: for Lingah is greatly used as an ' entrepot' or port of deposit for goods from foreign countries intended for distribution round the Gulf. It is also a depot for pearls. Prospects of trade in South Persia. —It is well known that of late years the steam communication with Persia has largely developed, a greater degree of attention has been directed to Persia; rumours abound of improvements of Government and land communication, and schemes have been devised for developing the resources of the country. Notwith standing all this the merchants of the south do not appear sanguine as to the trade prospects. Impediments to trade. —Commerce is certainly subjected to unusual and in some respects unaccountable checks in this part of Persia. The foreign trader is beset with difficulties and annoyances at every step.14 REPOUT ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE The system of Government is so well known now that it is needless to explain these facts. Before confidence can be established effective reforms must be introduced. Meanwhile to enable the British merchant to contend successfully against the existing difficulties he requires all the support that can or will be extended to him. With railway communication in the north of Persia and no corre sponding move in the south it would appear probable the southern trade would be in great part destroyed to the disadvantage of British and Indian commerce. It seems improbable railways could be constructed to connect the shores of the Persian Gulf with Central Persia. The suggestion of estab lishing a commercial route by the Karoon between Shuster and Ispahan seems best calculated to meet the difficulty. General requirements. —The immediate requirements in order to encourage commerce seem to be— (1.) The appointment invariably of able and honest Governors to districts and avoidance of the present system of frequent changes. (2.) Encouragement and protection of the agricultural classes. (3.) Security of transit for merchandize. Probably were the pea santry better protected or less oppressed the robber bands would disappear. The peasantry are naturally strong, frugal, and industrious, and with fertility of soil the conditions for protection are not wanting. Too fre quently the agriculturalists have just to take their choice between being robbed or robbing. For the heavy taxes they pay the Government gives them nothing in return. Special requirements. —There are many special wants which Bushire merchants have long felt such as— (1.) A more efficient Commercial Treaty. (2.) Establishment of a British Agency at Yezd. (3.) Introduction of a system of drawbacks on goods temporarily imported and re-exported. But these matters have been frequently discussed. Customs and Revenues. System of farming Customs, —At the sea-ports the customs are gene rally farmed out to the highest bidder, who is not uncommonly the Governor of the town. The Minister of Commerce sometimes takes the lease of all the Custom Houses of Persia, but letting to various persons. The Bushire Customs were let to a person of Ispahan in 1873 for 32,000 Tomans or Rupees 1,28,000. The Governor collects the land revenue, paying a fixed sum, to the Central Government.BUSHIRE RESIDENCY FOR 1873-74 The districts of Bushire are assessed at about Rupees 1,50,000. Octroi duties are also levied at liushire gate. The farmer of customs employs his own servants to manage, Gov ernment officials not interfering. The transactions are kept secret, no returns being required by the Government. The system is felt to be inconvenient by traders. Duty,—European merchants pay 5 per cent, ad valorem in money or kind on exports and imports in accordance with Treaty stipulations. This payment frees them from internal transit duties. Native merchants pay in an established scale varying for different articles. The Tables marked M. N. show these rates. » The working of the arrangements as regards Europeans is not invariably to their advantage. There are certain articles which will not bear 5 per cent, unless private arrangements could be made with the Custom House officials, Europeans would be debarred from trading in these goods. Each Custom House being as a rule independent of others. The farmers at the interior towns naturally dislike a system which pre vents their getting a share of duty in foreign imports and exports. ISo doubt annoyances occur in consequence. The general result is, however, favorable to the trade of the foreigners. At Lingah the duty is uniformly 2^ per cent, for all, and at Bunder Abbass 3^ per cent. Arab Coast. —With the exception of the Islands of Bahrein the trade of the Arab ports is comparatively petty. A small band of Banyans usually resides at each place and make a living ? little more. The prosperity of the Coastal Arab depends mainly on the pearl fisheries. The total outturn of these was estimated by Colonel Pelly in 1865 at 40 lakhs of rupees or £400,000. There is no reason to suppose that any remarkable increase or decrease in the trade has since occurred. Bahrein. —The trade of Bahrein has been flourishing of late years. The accompanying Tables marked O. P. and ti. speak for themselves. They have been drawn up for information carefully collected by the news a&lt;jent. It will be readily observed from the figures that Bahrein like Lingah is a depot whence other ports and districts draw supplies of cer tain articles imported to Bahrein from other places. The Table Q. shows the amount of revenue of the Chief and the sources whence derived. The aggregate is double what it was estimated at twenty years ago. Pirate Coast. —The Tables marked R. S. T. U. V. W. exhibit the import and export trade of the ports of Abi Thebi, Debey, Sharkah, Ajman, Umm-el-Kowein, and Ras-el-Kheyma situated on the Arab littoral known as the Pirate Coast.

Political. —The close of the official year 1872-73 saw tranquillity prevailing in nearly all parts of the principality of Oman, the political horizon comparatively clear of clouds, and the situation altogether much more favourable for His Highness Syud Toorkee than it had been at the commencement of that year. His Highness' nephew, Syud Salim bin Thoweynee, after protracted efforts to overthrow His Highness' authority, had found himself unable to organize a sufficiently powerful combination of the tribes for this purpose, and despairing of success had embarked at Soor and proceeded to Bombay; and with the exception of Syud Ibrahim bin Kais, who still held possession of Sohar and some other forts in the Batinah, no rival now remained in the country who could cause Syud Toorkee any great anxiety or trouble. The first notable event of the, year was the mission of His Excel lency Sir Bartle Frere, G.C.S.I., who had been appointed by Her Majesty's Government Special Envoy for the purpose of negotiating more stringent treaties for the suppression of the East African slave- trade. His Excellency, accompanied by Colonel Pelly and suite, arrived at Muscat from Maculla and Zanzibar in Her Majesty's Ship Enchantress on the 12th April, and was received with much cordiality and frankness by Syud Toorkee, with whom a new Slave Treaty was speedily and satis factorily entered into. The mission made only a short stay of four days and left for India on the 16th April. An important result to the Sultan of this mission was the decision of Her Majesty's Government to guarantee the payment of the annual subsidy of $40,000 awarded by Lord Canning in 1861 to be paid by the Ruler of Zanzibar to the Ruler of Muscat. This seasonable increase of income was a great relief to His Highness whose embarrassments had continued to be a source of much anxiety to him. During the same month of April Syud Nasir bin Ali A1 bu Saidi, the AVullee or Governor of Muscat, was unfortunately murdered in his house on the night of the 14th by two assassins who are supposed to have belonged to the tribe Beni Ruweyeh and to have committed the deed in revenge for the death of Sheikh Khaleelee. Sometime in May a serious collision took place between the El Nairn and Beni Kelban tribes of El Dhahireh in which the latter were worsted with a loss of more than 40 men. The cause of the contention was the fort of Bu Einem which the El Nairn had sometime previously taken possession of. At this time Saeed Abdool Azeez bin Saeed and Syud Salim were residing in Bombay, but on the 1st June it was reported by the Com missioner of Police that they had left almost simultaneously in bu^alows and were supposed to have proceeded to the Persian Gulf or Mekran Coast. Early in the same month Syud Feysul bin Hamood of El Rostak gave over the fort of El Hazam in the Batinah to Syud Ibrahim bin Kais, who thereupon came down from Sohar and assumed possession of it. The Acting Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Colonel Ross, arrived at Muscat on a tour on the 30th June. I IMUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1873-74. 75 In July His Highness Syud Toorkeej who had for some time enter tained the idea of recovering- possession of Sohar and other forts in the Eatinah from Syud Ibrahim, having already in the previous month despatched troops thither for the purpose, left Muscat in his corvette the Rahmanee, and on reaching Sohar was joined by the El Naim and ether tribes who had engaged to co-operate. In the meantime Sheikh Saleh bin Ali El Harithee endeavoured to create a diversion in Sjoid Ibrahim's favour by effecting a coalition of the Ilinawi tribes in El Sharkiyeh and threatening to attack Muscat during His Highness' absence. The attempted demonstration, however, completely failed and shortly after His Highness Syud Toorkee succeeded in gaining possession of Sohar, from Syud Ibrahim, under a conditional surrender, and the whole of the I3atinah with the coast forts now submitted to the Sultan's authority. Near the end of the month Syud Abdool Azeez, who had landed near Pussnee on the Mekran Coast, having managed to gain the adhesion of some of the Belooch tribes, mostly subjects of the Khan of Khelat, and collected a force of about 500 men, invested the fort of Gwadur which was then garrisoned by a few Arabs and a small party of Beloochees. A reinforcement of 200 men sent from Muscat incomprehensibly returned without having landed, and the fall of Gwadur seemed at one time imminent. In the beginning of August, however, Syud Abdool Azeez, having been deserted apparently by most of his Belooch auxiliaries, who had principally engaged themselves in ransacking and plundering the town, gave up his attempt on Gwadur and retired into Mekran where he remained for a time with one of the petty Chiefs. During the Sultan's absence at Burka and Sohar the inimical Beni Euweyeh tribe made a raid on His Highness' date plantations in the Semail District with the object of securing the ripe harvest, and a slight collision occurred in consequence. Syud Toorkee intended to have marched to punish the offenders from Burka, but was suddenly pros trated by severe illness and compelled to relinquish his design. Towards the middle of August the restless Saleh bin Ali El Harithee again endeavoured to foment disturbances and effect a rising of the Hinawi tribes, and he managed to despatch a party of about 400 of the A1 Wahibeh as an advance force to Muttra, without at first creating any suspicion of their object. The Ghafiri tribes of Semail, however, having quickly become aware of the scheme closed the Akk Pass in front of Saleh's main body, thus effectually checking his advance and ultimately compelling him to retire. The A1 Wahibeh hearing of Saleh's repulse and consequent failure to join them soon made peace with His Highness, and Saleh bin Ali's movement which had at one time appeared formidable collapsed altogether. At the commencement of September His Highness Syud Toorkee concluded negotiations with the refractory Beni Buweyeh tribe, who, on certain conditions being granted to them, gave in their allegiance and promised submission. On the 12th September Syud Abdool Azeez having disregarded the warning of Government and attempted to cross over to Oman was70 REPORT ON ADMINISTRATION OF THE captured by the Assistant Political Ag-ent, Mekran Coast, Captain Mockler, in Her Majesty's Ship Rifleman off Soor and brong-ht to Muscat whence he was taken to Kurrachee. Here he remained for some time in honorable surveillance^ but ultimately gave in his promise that he would reside in India and refrain from all interference with affairs of Oman until permitted by Government. A suitable allowance was made for him by His Highness Syud Toorkee. Shortly afterwards Syud Ibrahim bin Kais acquired possession of the important town and fortress of El Kostak from Feysul bin Hamood, who appears to have resolved on retiring from political strife and living quietly on his possessions. This arrangement greatly strengthened the political position and influence of Syud Ibrahim, who was at this time the sole rival in Oman for the supreme power, and whose ambitious hopes would now rest on a surer foundation. On the 8th November Syud Salim surprised and captured the fort at Gwadur with a small following of only 17 men. This he occupied until the r2th, when, having been called on to surrender by the Assistant Political Agent, he managed to escape into Mekran, and the fort was reoccupied by the Sultan's Wullee and garrison. Syud Salim subse quently moved across Mekran and reached the Island of Kishm where he continues to reside with his brother Hareb. In December His Highness Syud Toorkee was united in marriage to the daughter of his cousin, Syud Hamad bin Salim bin Sultan A1 Bu Saidi. In January 1874 Syud Toorkee become dangerously ill, and was at one time so reduced by the disease that his life was despaired of. The illness proved a lingering one, and His Highness was still lying stretched on his bed when Sheikh Saleh bin Ali El Harithee roused by a report of Syud Toorkee's death that had been designedly spread by some of his enemies, started with a small force with the intention of taking Muscat by a night surprise. In this he failed, but his arrival was most unexpected, and no preparations had of course been made to receive him. The troops available in Muscat, however, were immediately ordered out by the Sultan to attack the invaders and an encounter took place at a village near Muttra in which His Highness' troops suffered a disastrous defeat and were pursued up to the walls of Muttra, which was occupied by the rebels the same night. Sheikh Saleh and the rebels remained here five days entirely undisturbed, during which they plundered the town, including the property of British subjects, and eventually only took their departure after concluding a humiliating truce with His Highness by which they received a large sum of money in cash besides other concessions. It was fortunate for Syud Toorkee that his firm supporter, Syud Budr-bin Seif the Wullee of Sohar, was present in Muscat at the time and able to take charge of affairs, otherwise it is probable that the consequences would have been much more serious. The British Government after this resolved to give active support by sea to His Highness Syud Toorkee against rebels. The month of February passed quietly, but in the beginning of March Syud Ibrahim bin Kais encouraged probably by the success of Saleh bin Ali and having been joined by some of the Chief tribes in the@) MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1873-74. 77 Batinah attacked and captured the fort of Mesnaah after a short siege, and the British subjects resident there were plundered and one killed. Syud Ibrahim was called upon by the Aeting 1 Political Agent to evacuate the fort and to make reparation for British losses, and having declined to do so was dislodged therefrom by Her Majesty^s Ship Fhilomel. The Political Resident, Colonel Ross, arrived at Muscat on the 23rd March, and after communication with the Sultan proceeded to Mesnaah, which had in the interim been re-occupied and garrisoned by Syud Ibrahim. Syud Ibrahim was again caused to withdraw his force from the fort, which was then, in accordance with the Sultan's request, bombarded and destroyed by Her Majesty's Ships Rifleman, Philomel, and Hugh Rose. An indemnity of $15,000 on account of losses sustained by British traders was imposed on Syud Ibrahim and the Yal Saad tribe by the Political Resident, who then returned to Bushire. These measures have had the effect of checking the operations of the rebellious faction in the Batinah for the present, and were His High ness able to take the field in force and oppose the insurgents it is probable the revolution would speedily be put an end to, as it is, it seems likely slowly to increase. His Highness Syud Toorkee's position and power have for some time from bad health and other causes been steadily declining, and his tenure of the Sultanate may be considered decidedly precarious and insecure. It is to be hoped, however, that by good counsels he may be able to come to some favorable arrangement with Syud Ibrahim and the rebels, and that the dangers now threatening may be thereby averted. Official Changes. —In the month of March 1874 Surgeon A. S. Jayakar, Civil Surgeon, proceeded to Bombay on sick leave preparatory to obtaining a final certificate to Europe. He was succeeded by Sur geon C. T. Peters, M.B., who assumed charge of the Civil Surgeoncy on the 28th March 1874. Slave Traffic. —The year 1873 was marked by the mission of His Excellency Sir Bartle Frere to the Sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar to conclude treaties and engagements for the more effectual suppression of the East African slave-trade, the experience of the last few years having conclusively proved to Her Britannic Majesty's Government that the existing treaty engagements did not suffice for the attainment of the object for which those engagements were framed. In consequence of the excitement and deterrent effect produced among the dealers and those interested in the trade by this mission the importation of slaves into Oman was almost entirely checked, and so far as is known only a very few slave bugalows arrived with cargoes during the season. No captures were made by Her Majesty's cruizers during the year. His Highness Syud Tookee issued a proclamation in April 1873 abolishing all traffic in slaves in his dominions, and threatening punish ment to those who disobeyed. Trade. —The trade of Muscat appears to have slightly declined during the past year. The value of both imports and exports being below those of the year before. This was, however, to have been expected, as owing to internal dissensions and other causes Muscat has been slowly and steadily declining as a commercial port for some years.report on trade of the Muscat being entirely cut off from the interior by the hills sur rounding it its trade is inseparably connected with that of the neigh bouring town of Muttra, distant about two miles by sea, where there is a good anchorage for country craft. It is here the caravans from the interior concentrate, and where the Arabs chiefly obtain their requirements in exchange for produce. The khojas and petty dealers mostly dwell in Muttra, but the wealthy and influential Hindoo merchants, who carry on, or control the principal commercial operations, reside in Muscat. About ten square rigged vessels trading with India and Persian Gulf ports are owned in Muscat besides country craft. A good part of the trade is carried in the British India Steam Navigation Company's line of mail steamers. The exports of Muscat are exceeded by the imports. These are rice, piece goods, metals, sugar, coffee, &amp;c., &amp;c. The Bengal famine has exercised a considerable influence on the market, the importation of rice this year having been reduced thereby to about one-third of the usual quantity. The exports are dates, pressed and dry, grain, salt fish, salt, shark fins, cotton, pearls, &amp;c., &amp;c. Dates are the principal production of Oman, and as they form one of the staple foods of the people the annual consumption of the country in addition to the quantity exported is enor mous. Tlie manufactures of Oman are almost confined to textile fabrics and pottery. The chief seat of the former industry is the province of El Batinah whence the cloth is exported chiefly to Zanzibar and Yemen. The potteries are at Nezwa, £1 Rostak, Muttra, &amp;c., &amp;c., but are not of much importance. The customs farm is still in the hands of the same Hindoo firm that has held it for the last 200 years. The amount paid to the Sultan for the farm for the past 12 months was 1,20,000 Dollars. This, how ever, includes not only the customs duties properly so called, but also transit dues on produce from the interior, petty monopolies, &amp;c. There are six branches or stations of the Muscat Custom House. There is no duty on exports. The tariff on imports is 5 per cent. ad valorem. Transhipment duties 5 per cent. Dates are charged Rupees 1-8 to 2-8 per camel load. Wharfage and weighing half anna per package. The exchange during the past year has ranged from Rupees 208 to Rupees 224 per 100 Dollars.
