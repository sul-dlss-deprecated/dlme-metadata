Tlle Government of India on being asked for their views on this subject m connexion with the proposed Trans-Persian Railway, replied as follows Telegram from Government of India to Secretary of State, dated 8th January 1913. Foreign Secret. ^ our telegram of 3rd January. Naval and military position at entrance to Persian Gulf. Short time has prevented our considering case as fully as we should have wished, but following are our views :— On assumption that either main line or branch line of Trans-Persian railway will touch coast at Bunder Abbas we consider following alternatives are necessary to secure naval control of Gulf: (a) To secure anchorage in Clarence Strait by holding positions on Hormuz, Larak, and Kishm islands to command appicaches to the anchorage, at the same time to enforce rights of pie-emption on Musandim peninsula, which we appear to possess under Maskat Treaty of 1891; or (6) to establish naval station at Khor Kawai, set unng at same time our position in regard to islands of Hormuz, Larak, and Kishm eithei b\ agreement with Persia or by de facto occupation ; or (c) a combination of above, viz., to secure anchorage in Clarence Strait and also to establish coaling station at Khor Kawai. From strategic standpoint first alternative would provide fine spacious anchorage and probably best position, for control of Gulf waters. Defence however, of anchorage would involve disposal of considerable force to command various approaches and there is no good harbour for use as coaling station. Second alternative piovides a position which could more easilv and efficiently be defended, and harbour at Khor Kawai could be used as coaling- station. Anchorage is, however, much more restricted and position is less favourable than Clarence Strait and does not dominate Persian coast. Third alternative would give most effective control, but would make greater demand for defence. Nor (?from) analogy of Gibraltar and Aden would it appear necessary for the purpose in view to occupy position on both shores, and it is probable that our control could be made effective by secured base on one shore with rights of pre-emption or flying naval station on opposite shore. The above or any measures to ensure naval control in Gulf waters will involve defences and military garrison, extent and number of which cannot now be estimated. On the whole for the purpose of Trans- Persian railway we prefer alternative (a), but there are obvious difficulties in the way of securing any agreement from Persian Government in regard to Hormuz, Larak, Kishm, or Henjam. In regard to Henjam. our position has been strengthened by the establishment of a telegraph station, and we might unobtrusively, if an agreement with Persia is impossible, establish oui position on 1 lormuz, Larak, anti Kishm by other means. A\ ith regard to Khor Kawai there should, if necessary, be little difficulty in inducing Sultan to grant us a lease which would enable us to make a naval base or coaling station there, but are we not estopped by Treaty of 18C2 with France as interpreted in the Bander-Gisseh case ? S. 195. [NotesThe Government of India have been told that they have another week, and have been asked to supplement the above if they wish. In the meantime the following remarks are offered. The question of the best sites for a naval base and kindred purposes was carefully examined during the years 1900-1904, and in 1903 Lord Curzon went over the ground personally with Rear-Admiral Willes. The places now mentioned by the Government of India are those which by general admission we should occupy ourselves or prevent any one else from occupying; and it is perhaps not necessary further to examine the evidence as to their respective merits. The difficulty is how to secure them. ■■■■ I. The places on the south coast of the entrance are on the promontory of Musandim. Until the end of 1904, His Majesty’s Government were of opinion that the evidence of the Sultan of Muscat’s ownership of the promontory was sufficiently vague to justify them in ignoring it if they thought fit, and flagstaffs were actually erected in November 1901 on Telegraph Island, Sheep Island, and the Maklab isthmus. But in February 1905 it was decided (on the recommendation of the Committee on Imperial Defence, Mr. Balfour presiding) not to maintain the staffs on the two latter for reasons of policy, but to rely on Lord Lansdowne’s declaration in the House of Lords, of 5th May 1903, for the protection of our interests. (Lord Lansdowne’s declaration was re-affirmed by implication in Sir E. Grey’s despatch to Sir A. Nicolson, of 29th August 1907, which was published with the Anglo-Russian Convention). Lord Morley finally ordered that the flagstaff on Telegraph Island should not be maintained in 1908. In the meantime further evidence regarding the Sultan of Muscat’s ownership had come to light, which caused a change of view, and in the counter-case which His Majesty’s Government presented before the Hague 'Tribunal on the occasion of Muscat arbitration it was admitted that “ from Ras Dibba to “ Tibba (Tibet) the coast forming the promontory of Musandim is claimed “ by the Sultan, who has certainly before and since 1864 exercised authority “ on that coast by his Vali and in other ways: and his rights on the coast “ are recognised by the Sheikh of Shargah and the Joasmi.” The effect of this admission is to bring the promontory of Musandim within the scope of the Anglo-French declaration of 1862; and as in 1899 His Majesty’s Government successfully protested against French action in obtaining the cession of land at Muscat (Bunder Gisseh) for a coaling station as contrary to that declaration, it has always been held that we were precluded from ourselves obtaining the cession of Musandim. [It should be mentioned in this connexion that the status of Telegraph Island differs rather from that of the promontory itself and the other islands, in that it had been occupied by the Eastern Telegraph Company in 1865, and remained in occupation for four years.] If this view is still held, the position appears to be as follows : On the assumption that if we occupy one side of the entrance to the Gulf we need only to “ sterilize ” the other: — (а) If we occupy the north side, we must rely on Lord Lansdowne’s declaration for the sterilisation of Musandim (except as regards Telegraph Island); (б) If we want to occupy Musandim, we are precluded by the Anglo- French declaration except as regards Telegraph Island. It will be remembered that we can buy the French out of Muscat by paying their price, i.c., the Gambia, the cession of which has hitherto been resisted bv the Colonial Office. But the Government of India now refer to the Muscat treaty of 1891. Articles 4 and 5 of this make it lawful for British subjects “ to acquire by “ gift, purchase .... or any other legal manner, land, houses, and “ property of every description.” The suggestion therefore presumably isthat a British subject should acquire a lease of the promontory, or suitable parts of it, with a view to preventing its occupation by a foreign Power. 1 wo questions arise :— (a) Would this be consistent with the interpretation of the Anglo-French declaiation referred to above J . It should be noticed that in con versation with M. Cambon on 15th February 1899 Lord Salisbury, in making his protest against the lease of Bunder Gisseh by the French Government, said “ According to mv reading of “ the engagement of 1862 it is not competent for France, as a State, to accept a lease .... This view, of course, would “ not apply to a lease given to a French citizen in his private capacity (telegram to Sir E. Mon son, 15th February 1899). Again on 22nd February, when Lord Salisbury adhered to his view as to the action oi French Government, M. Cambon, while not acccepting it, said that “ a suggestion which I [Lord Salisbury] had made on “ a previous occasion, and repeated again, that it might be taken in ‘ the name of a French citizen, was made difficult on the present ‘‘ occasion, because the English newspapers had appeared to dictate “ such a course in a somewhat threatening manner.” (Lord Salisbury to Sir E. Monson, 23rd February 1899). From this it is evident that (though a different solution was eventually reached) both parties regarded a lease by a private “ man of straw ” of a site for a coaling station as consistent with the declaration of 1862 (A .B.--These were conversations only : there is no French opinion in writing). (b) Would the lease by a private individual give us the necessary control over the waters of the various khors in which the fleet of another Power might anchor ? Presumably, when relations became strained, our ships would take the precaution to be there first, and provided no fortifications are necessary, that would be sufficient? II. On the north side of the Gulf the position is as follows :— At Basidu, at the extreme north-west point of the island of Kishm, we have had a station since 1820, when it was granted by the Sultan of Muscat who at that time claimed the island. The barracks have fallen into decay ; there are no permanent defences ; and the small coal depot is in process of transference to Henjam. A native Agent resides there and flies the British flag. Admiral Whiles was of opinion that Basidu is of no practical value for naval purposes. On the island of Henjam, we have a concession for a telegraph station granted by the Shah in 1865. The limits of it have not been defined, and as recently as 1906 the Persian Government have maintained that no land was conveyed at all. His Majesty’s Government, however, hold that Persian acquiescence in our occupation from 1868 to 1880 must be regarded as equivalent to a formal concession of the land occupied. A wireless installa tion lias recently been authorised there as part of the Persian Gulf scheme.* * „ ,. Further, in April last His Majesty’s * Lhe other stations are Bushire, • , ,, , •’ J Koweit, Bahrein, and Debai (or Zora). toa eminent authoi ised tne transfer to Plenjam of the coal depot, formerly maintained at Basidu, and 5,000 tons of coal are being deposited there. So far the Persian Government have not protested. Admiral Whiles thought that Henjam was more suitable than Basidu as a signal station, but could not be transformed into a naval station. The Government of India make no suggestion as to how a further cession or lease of these islands, and of Larak and Hormuz, is to be obtained from the Persian Government. January 1913. A. H.Lord Lansdowne's Declaration of hth May 1903. “In the third place—I say it without hesitation -we should regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and we should certainly resist it with all the means at our disposal.” Extract Sir E. Grey's Despatch of 20th August 1907. In order to make it quite clear that the present arrangement is not intended to affect the position in the Gulf, and does not imply any change of policy respecting it on the part of Great Britain, His Majesty’s Government think it desirable to draw attention to previous declarations of British policy, and to re-affirm generally previous statements as to British interests in the Persian Gulf and the importance of maintaining them.”</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000117_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/C129</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000117</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/C129</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Defence of entrance to Persian Gulf'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1913/1913</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-09-30T23:13:21</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (2 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at f 25, and terminates at f 26, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the bottom right corner of the recto side of each folio.
