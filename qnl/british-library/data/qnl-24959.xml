Sir, In reply to your letter Ho.E.1284/1098/25 dated 26th March 1931, regarding the administration of Asir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that, having regard to the circumstances explained in Sir Andrew Ryan 1 s telegram dated 14th March 1931, he agrees that official recognition of the new arrangement made between the Idrisi and Ibn Saud and of the new status of Asir can no longer be withheld.

(Sent 12.30 p.m. 11th April 1931) No.15. The following telegrams from Sir A.Ryan,Jedda,to Foreign Office dated 14th March are repeated to you at the former 1 s request. Begins . No.62. Minister for Foreign Affairs, in a note dated March 11th, requests that as Sadiya and Jizan are not affected by agreement between the Eastern Telegraph Company and the Hejaz Government I shall communicate with Aden Government with a view to an agreement for establishment of wireless telegraphic communication between Jizan and Aden for commercial purposes connected with Idrisi province; and with the Kamaran authorities with a view to creation of postal service between Jizan and that island so as to economise facilities. Ends . Begins . No.63. This request assumes acquiescence of His Majesty’s Government in new status of Asir. There may also be some idea of diminishing dependence of the Hejaz for external telegraph communication on Eastern Telegraph Company whose claim I have been pushing very strongly. I am not acknowledging note pendingyour instructions. Ends . I should be glad to learn whether you have any observations on the proposed establishment of wireless communication between Jizan and Aden. ■ iii ^ h . 1 ^</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0002ab_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/4107</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0002ab</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/4107</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 35/4 'Arabia: postal communication between Kamaran and Jizan; wireless communication between Aden and Jizan'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1931/1937</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-11-23T22:36:46</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (60 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 61; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns arrangements for the transmission of post between Jizan (Saudi Arabia) and Kamaran (Yemen), and covers the establishment of wireless telecommunications between Jizan and Aden.The file is composed of correspondence between: the Foreign Office; the India Office; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Secretary of State for the Colonies; the Admiralty; the British Legation at Jedda; and HM Ministry for Foreign Affairs at Mecca.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Jizan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kamaran</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Aden</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for the Colonies, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Legation to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Mail carriers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Wireless telegraphy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0002ab#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
