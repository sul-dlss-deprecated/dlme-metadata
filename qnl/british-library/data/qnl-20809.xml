Early History ; 1904-1915. The first definite proposal for the use of wireless telegraphy in the Persian Gulf was made by the Political Resident, Bushire, in April 1908 » • p 1297/08 when he proposed that Koweit and Bahrein should be linked up with Busmre. Tlie reasons advanced were— (1) to give telegraphic facilities to the Political Agents of the Government of India recently (1904) appointed to Bahrein and Koweit; (2) to facilitate the quarantine service of the Gulf; (3) to assist the operations against the traffic in smuggled arms; and (4) last, but not least, to assist our seaborne trade in the Gulf in its struggle against the active competition of foreign Powers. The Secretary of State for India, for financial reasons, was not prepared at that time to take the proposal into practical consideration, while apart from this, the question was bound up with a scheme then under consideration oTlndia er0CtlOn wireless stations for strategic purposes along the coast 2. It was soon after decided that a temporary wireless station should be erected at Jask to assist the operations for the suppression of the arms traffic This station was opened on 24th December 1909 and, since it had been erected withm the ground of the Telegraph concession there, it was not pTrdan Government t0 ^ ^ COmmuDication concerning it to the o.In August 1909 Messrs. Wonckhaus's agent at Bahrein reported that his company were anxious to establish wireless telegraph communication between Bushire and Babrem.J and it was agreed between the India Office and the Foreign Office that to forestall such a project the British scheme for wireless P ' stations m the Persian Gulf should be proceeded with as rapidly as possible It was proposed that the cost of the scheme should be shared between the British and Indian Exchequers, and the Treasury agreed to this in principle, p, Erection of Present Stations; 1915-1917, rj- ^ 96 ' date , d ^ August 1911, the Government of India submitted definite proposals, with estimates of the cost for the establishment of wireless stations at Bushire, Henjam, Bahrein, Koweit and e .1 (or Zora), with a portable station to be erected at Lingah when required This scheme was sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India m his telegram of 20th February 1912. The station at Bushire was completed on 30th January 1915, that at Bahrein on 7th June 1916 and that at Henjam on the 10th October 1916. No station was erected at Bebai or ^ora. Work on the station at Koweit was commenced and the buildings KUfi . erected ' but no wireless apparatus was installed as it was decided in fiinrriw'' w ' h ,te ***** ' s ''' v 5.

During the war a proposal was made to erect land lines from Bander Ahbas to Kerrnan, J ask, and Lingah respectively. The line to Kerman was erected, but it was decided not to erect the line to Jask and, in substitution of the land line to Lingah, to erect a temporary wireless station there. The wireless station at Lingah was opened on 2nd October 1917 and no communication concerning it was made to the Persian Government. Persian Eequests for Removal of Stations: 1922. 7. In April 1922 the Persian Government asked for the removal of the wireless stations at Bushire, Hen jam and Lingah.* His Majesty's Govern ment considered it of importance that these stations should be retained in the hands of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and the Minister at Teheran was accordingly authorisedto offer to the Persian Government one-third of the charge of 60 centimes a word levied on wireless messages on the understanding that the Persian Government agreed to the retention of the stations in the control of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The Persian Government did not press their request for the removal of the stations and His Majesty's Minister therefore had no occasion to submit the offer which he had been authorised to make.J The Persian Government desired to raise the question of the status of the stations at the International Telegraph Conference held in Paris in 1925, but could not do so because the § p. 3945/25. Conference was not competent to deal with such questions,§ nor was th^ question raised at the International Radiotelegraph Conference at Washington in 1927. Persian Prohibition of Import of Wireless Spare Parts: 1927. 8. In October 1927 the Persian Government prohibited the import into i| Teh. tele, to f.o . Persia of wireless telegraph or telephone apparatus.j| but before the prohi- 200^Oct.^27 1927, bitiou became effective a supply of spare parts was furnished to each station, and it is estimated that unless some accident occurs the stations can continue to function at least till the middle of 1929. 9. In November 1927 Sir R. Clive reported that the Russian Government had agreed to recognise the wireless station at Enzeli on the Caspian, with its plant and building, as the property of the Persian Government, on the understanding that they should be allowed its free use for a period of three years (extendible to five if at the end of three years no wireless station has been established by Persia), subject to certain provisos in regard to the free transmission of Persian Government messages, and to the restriction that the station should be used solely for the purposes of shipping. The Minister thought it unlikely that His Majesty's Government would succeed in improving on these terms in the case of the GulE stations. Desiderata of His Majesty's Government. 10. In view of the opening early in 1928 of general negotiations with Persia, and the possibility that the Persian Government might take the opportunity again to raise the question of the future of the wireless stations, discussion took place between the Government of India, the India Office and • Tehemn !i4B, 0 Mar.22 tlle Foreign Office as to the line to be followed in this event. It was agreed 1928, e .'&amp; o. that the Minister at leheran should be authorised, if negotiations became 2149/28. necessary, in the first instance to propose that the three stations at Bushire, Henjam and Lingah should become the property of Persia but should be leased to the Indo-European Telegraph Department until .1st January 1945, the date on which the concessions of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment generally are due to expire, and that rent should be remitted in liquidation of the capital debt. It was recognised that there was little likelihood of these^ terms being acceptable to Persia, and the Minister was accordingly authorised, failing their acceptance, to make the best terms he could, provided that he did not, without further reference home, accept less than the free use of the Henjam station, without any restriction similar to that imposed on the Russians at Enzeli as to its employment solely for the purposes of shipping, for at least five years. The Persian Government have not so far raised the question, and no discussions have taken place. R»a87io/a: T) U. In a Despatch^ to the Government of India of 28th April 1928, the 1 ohtical Resident in the Persian Gulf has pointed out that the question of the emcient retention of the wireless stations at Bushire, Henjam and ^ P.1584/22, P. 3037/22, P. 3639/22. t P. 3899/22. % P. 861/25. Teh. Desp. to f.o,, 543, Nov. 5 1927, E. &amp; 0. 8692/27.3 Lingah has become acute since the Persian Government has refused to allow the importation of spare parts for repairs. Sir L. Haworth states that the retention of one station only in Persia, preferably that at Henjam, failing which Bushire, in conjunction with the station at Bahrein (also controlled by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and, unlike the other stations in the Gulf, run at a profit), is necessary for shipping work. He suggests that the probable desire of Persia to maintain stations at Bushire and Lingah might afford good ground for bargaining for the retention of Henjam. Should Persia prove obdurate, the needs of shipping might, he considers, be met by the erection of a station on the southern coast, probably near Ras-al-Khaimah—the existing cable between Jask and Bushire, if deflected to Ras-al-Khaimah en route, would provide immediate -contact between Bahrein and Bushire via Eas-al-Khaimah—in which case no Government wireless station would be necessary in Persia at all. (The Lr. from Pol. Res. possibility of using the island of Abu Musa (the Trucial ownership of which ^ a. of i., 277 s., is, however, challenged hy Persia) has also separately been suggested by the p ^ mS . 1928 ' Resident.) But a decision on the question depends, he remarks, on the final decision arrived at with regard to the action and policy of His Majesty's Government in the Persian Gulf, and especially on the agreement which His Majesty's Minister succeeds in making on behalf of Imperial Airways, who would presumably erect their own short-range stations on whatever route they select. Summary. 12. The position may be summarised as follows :— (1) His Majesty's Government have no legal claim to any of the existing wireless stations on Persian territory (Lingah, Jask, Henjam, Bushire). In no case was Persian agreement secured to their erection. The station at Bahrein is not on Persian territory. (2) Bahrein alone is at present run at a profit. The arguments for maintaining the remaining stations, even at a loss, and keeping them in British hands are firstly, efficiency (their value to shipping is substantial) and secondly, prestige. (3) The stations on Persian soil have approximately one year's supply of spare parts, &amp;c. The importation of further supplies' has been prohibited by Persia (though it is not very clear how strictly the prohibition is being enforced) and failing withdrawal of this prohibition the stations will be forced to close through starvation in a very short period. (4) If an agreement can be reached between Persia and Imperial Airways it wil] make a difference, since Imperial Airways will presumably erect their own short-range stations on whatever route they select. But on this point it will be seen from the note on Air Communications in the Persian Gulf that the Persian Government at present take the attitude that they will not agree to an international route along the Persian Gulf, and that they will insist on a clause being put in their agreement with Imperial Airways to the effect that when the three years, for which they have agreed to allow them to operate in that area, have passed, the route can in no circumstances • be renewed. Unless the Persian Government modify their attitude, the making of an agreement by Imperial Airways is therefore unlikely to enure permanently to the advantage of His Majesty's Government, so far as wireless is concerned. (5) The minimum requirement of His Majesty's Government would appear to be one station, to work in conjunction with the station at Bahrein, and in communication with ships at sea, situated either— (a) On the Persian littoral of the Gulf, in which case it should preferably be on the island of Henjam, or, failing that, Bushire; (b) On the Arabian littoral, in which case it would probably either be in Muscat territory, or near Ras-al-Khaimah, at which point the existing Jask-Bushire cable could be so deflected as to provide immediate contact between Bahrein and Bushire via Ras-al-Khaimah. India Office, August 1928.(!) C0NF1DKNTIA L. 'R INDIA OFFICE iiMALii ^ 4294/2^- Political Control in the Persian Gulf. Arrang-ements prior to 1921. The first association of His Majesty's Government with the Persian Gulf is the establishment by the East India Company, in 1616, of the Factory at Lor i 137; - 1779 Jashk; and from that date until a very recent period the local interests of His Majesty's Government ar$ substantially those of, or in the hands of, the Company and its agents. The date from which those agents can properly be spoken of as exercising political control is difficult to fix precisely: but it is not unreasonable to select, in an unbroken occupation of stations in the Gulf from 1616 onwards, the year 1763, when British headquarters were moved from Bunder Abbas to Basra and the Bushire Residency was established. During the century and a half between that date and 1921, political control in the Persian Gulf was exercised (with considerable intervals ending in Lor. i, iss, 220, 265,1339. 187.*;) during which responsibility rested with the Government of Bombay) by the Government of India on behalf of His Majesty's Government; and from 1824 onwards that control was concentrated m the hands of an officer Lor., i, 218. in Indian Government service known as the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, who since 1878 held in addition His Majesty's Commission as Lor., ii, p. 2102. Consul-General for the provinces of Ears, Khuzistan and Laristan, and the district of Lingah, and for the coasts and islands of the Persian Gulf being within the dominions of Persia. This official qua Political Resident was under the Indian Government, but qua Consul-General under the Foreign Office. The cost of his establishment was divided between the British and Indian Exchequers, and his headquarters were at Bushire. His judicial powers and extra-territorial jurisdiction as Consul-General were and are Lor. ii, 2102. exercised by virtue of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, first approved by Her Majesty in Council in 1889, and since that date substantially modified from time to time. 2. Subordinate to the Resident in his political capacity, for which he was, prior to the War, solely responsible to the Government of India, were the representatives of the Indian Government (officers of the Indian Political Department) in Muscat* the Trucial States, Bahreinf and Koweit.t and cSltfconlat through these officers he exercised an undefined but considerable influence Muscat, and exercising upon the political affairs of the States in question.

Consulates in South Persia. + (Exercising jurisdiction, subject to the Pol. Res., Arrangements since the Report of the Masterton-Smith Committee, 1921. Koweit Orders in Council. 3. The question of redistribution as between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India of political responsibility in the Persian Gulf appears to have been tentatively under consideration in the years before the War, but, partly, no doubt, because of the desirability of reaching a comprehensive understanding with Turkey on the limits of British and Turkish interests in the Gulf, no decision had been reached in 1914. The pre-war system, the maintenance of which was the subject of considerable discussion from time to time during the War, continued in force until 1921. In that year the Masterton-Smith Committee, the conclusions of which were accepted generally, subject to the approval of the Government of India, by His Majesty's Government, recommended that henceforth the control of policy as affecting the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf should be transferred to His Majesty's Government and exercised through the Middle Eastern Department of the Colonial Office; that the functions on that littoral of the Government of India should be confined to administrative and local matters, the prior concurrence of the Colonial Office being obtained by them to any measures of political significance, and that the relations of His Majesty's Government with Ibn Saud (as Sultan of Kejd) should be conducted exclusively by the new Middle Eastern Department. The channel Of. para. 12 of Masterton- of control in all cases was to be the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Smith Committee ' s Re P ort - 2979 b 75 10.282 I.O. to C.O., May 29 1923, P. 1760.

Res,, April 15 1924, P. 1836/24. and His Majesty's Consul-General, Busliire, who was, as hitherto, to be found from the service of the Government of India. The position of the Resident vis-a-vis the Government of India on the Persian littoral of the Gnlf (In which area he had, of course, at all times worked in very close relations with His Majesty's Minister at Tehran) and in Muscat, remained unaffected. 4. While the formal concurrence of the Government of India in the recommendations of the Masterton-Smith (committee has not been given owing to the necessity of disposing of the connected question of Aden, they have' agreed to work provisionally on the lines which the Committee recommended, and it may be said that, broadly speaking, the anangements approved by the Masterton-Smith Coimnittee, so far as division of responsibility was concerned, have been in operation since 19^1. Some discussion took place in 1922-3 on the q uestion whether communications with Ibn Saud should take place through the Political Agent, Bahrein, rather than through the Political Resident at Bushire. The arrangement finally reached between the Colonitd Office and India Office was that communications from His Majesty's Government as regards, and with, Ibn Saud and Nejd when sent through the Persian Gulf should pass through the Political Resident except in cases of a wholly exceptional character and of very great urgency ; that the same should hold good in the case of Koweit (the internal administration and affairs of which were to remain a matter for the Government of India); that in the case of Bahrein, the India Office should continue to be the normal channel for the communication of the instructions of His Majesty's Government on matters of policy; that orders on a question involving both relations with Ibn Saud and local action or^ interests in Bahrein, should be prepared in consultation between the India Office and Colonial Office and should issue (probably) ihrough the India Office to the Resident, but that in circumstances of a wholly exceptional character, the Colonial Office might communicate direct with the officers subordinate to the Resident who were in direct contact with Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit; and on a minor point, that questions affecting the development of the oil resources of the Arab littoral should for convenience be dealt with exclusively by the Colonial Office. The position as regards the Trucial Sheikhs and the Islands in the Gulf under the suzerainty of those Sheikhs has not been precisely defined, but, broadly speaking, it would seem to he similar to that in the case of Bahrein, and in dealing with the recent incident at Tamb the instructions of His Majesty's Government were communicated to the Political Resident through the India Office and the Government of India. 5. The general* effect of these arrangements is that the Political Resident is directly responsible to, and corresponds directly with. His Majesty's Government (as represented by the Colonial Office) on questions affecting Ibn Saud. except when he is in the Hejaz, and the political aspects of the Arab littoral of the Gulf: that he is directly responsible in his capacity as Consul-General, Bushire, to the Foreign Office ; and acts as a liaison between the Minister at Tehran and affairs in the Gulf which are of interest to His Majesty's Government as affecting their relations with Persia; that he is directly responsible to the Government of India for the internal affairs of the various States on the Arab littoral, for Bahrein, the Trucial Sheikhdoms, and Muscat, and for keeping them in touch both with affairs generally in South Persia and the Gulf, and with developments vis-a-vis Persia in that area, which, from the large Indian interests represented m it and its strategic importance, is of the first importance from the standpoint of the Government of India. The responsibility for co-ordinating action in times of stress in the Gulf inevitably and naturally falls on the Political Resident, who is alone sufficiently closely in permanent touch with the political, strategic and commercial interests involved adequately to discharge this function, and on whom accordingly the immediate responsibility must fall, in consultation with the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, or the Government of India as the case may be, for a decision as to the points at which the assistance of naval, military or air units should be asked from the appropriate naval or air authority, or from the Government of India.3 Persia and the maintenance of a ' Political Resident' (as distinct from Consul-General) at Bushire. 6. A minor but connected question may conveniently be dealt with in this connection. Since 1S78, as will be seen from para. 1 above, the British m representative at Bushire has discharged Consular functions, and has borne, H in addition to the title &lt;c Political Resident,' whicli dates from as early as 1824, the title 'Consul-General.' Qua Political Resident on the Persian littoral of the Gulf, his functions appear now to be almost negligible, but he still performs important duties in that capacity in respect of the Arab littoral from his headquarters at Bushire or Shiraz. In the last few months Persia has shown indications of a disposition to recognise and refer to the British representative as Consul-General only, while the presence of a flagstaff in the grounds of the Residency at Bushire appears recently to have roused the suspicions of the Persian Minister of Finance. It is, perhaps, improbable that the title of the British representative, or the fact that functions in respect of the Arab shore are discharged by him from a headquarters in Persian territory, will be raised by Persia in the course of the forthcoming negotiations, but, in view of her present attitude, it may be placed on record that the title, and the appointment, of Resident were specifically recognised by Persia thirty-seven years before the creation of a Consulate-General at Bushire in Article 2 of the Commercial Treaty with Great Britain of 1841 ('. . . as for a series of years a Resident of the British Government has resided at Bushire, the Persian Aitchison, vol. xm, xi. Government grants permission that the said Resident shall reside there as heretofore, and in like manner two [Persian] Commercial Agents shall reside in . . . London and . . Bombay '), and that there is no record over the period since 1841 of any Persian objection to the existing arrangement. India Office, • 5th October 1928. J. G. L.WNFIDENTjAL: R 394 INDIA OFFICE p 4195/28- Quarantine Control in the Persian Gulf. f This question has now been disposed of, at any rate temporarily, l)y the decision of His Majesty's Government to acquiesce, subject to certain provisos, in the immediate transfer of control to the Persian Government, such transfer taking effect on 28th July. Should it, however, prove that Persia is incompetent adequately to discharge her international obligations, the position will call for further consideration. The Memorandum now attached describes in some detail the developments leading up to the surrender of control by His Majesty's Government. 1. Under arrangements dating from 18(54 and confirmed and modified in ISQtt on the occasion of an epidemic in the Gulf, quarantine arrangements are in the hands of British medical officers lent by the Government of India from the Indian Medical Service, &amp;c. Since 1896 the pay and allowance of Teh. Desp. 468, the Quarantine Medical Officers at Bnnder Abbas, Lingah and Mohammerah, se p t - 24 192 ' and the pay of the quarantine establishments and contingent expenditure at Lingah, Bunder Abbas, Mohammerah, Bushire and Jask, have been borne by the Persian Government. The Chief Quarantine Medical Officer reported in 1927 that expenditure on these ports averaged krans 2,20,000 per annum, but that, the Persian Government providing a sum of approximately krans 1,80,000 annually to meet this, there was invariably a claim for arrears. The regaining expenditure on the service and the personnel by which it is manned (allowances to Chief Quarantine Medical Officer, to Senior Assistant Surgeon, Bushire, and to Assistant Surgeon, Jask ; pay and allowances of junior Assistant Surgeon, Bushire ; total in 1927, Rs. 12,000 per annum) is equally divided between Imperial and Indian revenues. The Persian Government were, however, informed in 1926 that f.o . to i.o., Mar. i His Majesty's Government would not be piepared' to sanction further capital 1926, p. 702/26. expenditure in connection with installations or expenses of maintenance. The Chief Quarantine Officer in the Gulf has in the past reported to the Sanitary Council in Teheran, which contains a British member. 2. At the International Sanitary Conference in Paris, the meetings of f.o. to 1 .0., jime 26 which concluded in June 1926, the Persian representative endeavoured, p 92 2ib^/26! 3/89 ^ 34 ' unsuccessfully, to secure recognition of the fact that Persia was now fully competent to administer the sanitary services in her ports without foreign intervention. Having failed to secure his object, and having refused to consider a compromise under which Article 90 of the Convention (which replaces Article 83 of the Convention of 1912, and under which the existing condition of affairs is regulated) should be replaced by an Article stating that the sanitary regime in Persian ports would be determined by subsequent negotiations between the Persian Government and His Majesty's Government, he put in a reservation as regards Article 90. To this the representatives of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India replied by a counter-reservation saving the status quo, pending the conclusion of an agreement on the subject between His Majesty's Government and Persia, and both reservations were consigned to the record of the proceedings. 3. In January of the following year :;: ' the Persian Government raised the * Teh. Desp. 23, question of transfer to Persian medical officers of the quarantine service in the south with the Minister in Teheran, who replied in the terms of the reservation, of June 1926. In April 19271 the Assistant to the Political t Letter 1315from Resident in the Persian Gulf agreed, without authority, to the exercise by Aprii^o 192^' 0f ^ the Persian Government of what was described as 'a nominal control' over p. 3210/27. the quarantine arrangements carried out in the Gulf by our officers. His action was disavowed, the Resident taking the line, when opportunity offered, that the question w-as one which must be raised in Teheran through the ordinary diplomatic channels, but the error had been made and the Persian Government did not fail to take advantage of it. 4. In July of 1927J Sir Robert Clive reported that the Persian Director .t Teh. tel. to f.o. of Health had noted in the minutes of the Sanitary Council a statement that p 3 3652/27. 1 192 '' 2979A 75 10.28 A9 the Sanitary Director of the South had been appointed Chief of Quarantine of the South and that the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer had been instructed to transmit his reports in future to his new Chief. At the same time in the light of the situation caused by the cholera outbreak at Abadan Teh. tel. to f.o . 136, anc l Mohammerah it was agreed by the Sanitary Council, the Logatic^ july27 1927, p . 3/o4. £) oc ^ or aC q U iescing, that the senior Health Officer of the South (tO reference being to the Persian) should decide which Persian ports should remain open, all others being closed and that, further, Persian and English doctors should be asked to work together. On the instructions of the Minister a. letter was sent to the President of the Council by the Legation Doctor to say that it was presumed that the Persian Health Officer would only make recommendations after consultation with and in agreement with the Chief Quarantine Officer.' :i: ' 5. Meanwhile, the Persian Government had intimated unofficially through the Director-General of Health that their position vis-d-vis the Russian Medical Officers in the Persian Caspian ports, who had been deprived of powers of interference in quarantine, was difficult in view of the state of affairs in the Persian Gulf; that they in no way desired there to replace at present the existing British Medical Officers by Persians since it would be some time before suitable Persian doctors would be available and even when they did become available they would be installed only very carefully, and that they desired that the service should remain as it was, but under the supervision and direction of the Persian Health Department. Sir Robert Clive remarked that could we really rely on the Persian Government confiniug themselves to calling for and receiving quarantine reports and regularly contracting for the service of British quarantine officers in the Gulf for a number of years and not unduly interfering in the present system, he was of opinion that much might be f.o. to i.o., July 23 gained by regularising the service on some such basis. The Foreign Office 1927, i. 36o2/2f. suggested that the Minister might be authorised to take action on these Tel. from Viceroy to lines and the Government of India, whose views were accepted by the ?927 f'/o 6 t'o^o 29 Secretary of State for India, reluctantly agreed, remarking that the best Aug. 5 1927, p. 3786. course apparently was to aim at tempering full nominal control by Persia with as effective safeguards as possible against executive control. They suggested that stress might be laid on our ability, if not unduly interfered with, to work the system for the present more cheaply than they could and on the necessity of avoiding premature innovations which might have the effect of bringing the present excellent arrangements into serious discredit t p. .&gt;&lt;80 /27. with the Office International.! Sir Robert Clive was accordingly authorisedj To^Aug 1 6 t 1927I 1 enc lG av cmr to arrange with the Persian Government on the lines suggested p. 3921/27 ' by him. (It may b3 noted that at this stage, the Ministry of Health in a § p. 4667. letter of 11th August lOST,^ represented the undesirabilty, in view of the existence of the cholera epidemic at Abadan, of taking any action at the present juncture likely to impair the authority of the British Quarantine Officers in the Gulf Ports in the administration and execution of sanitary measures^ and referred to the reservation on the subject of control registered by the British representatives at the Sanitary Conference in 1926). Teii Dos 63 Clive before raising the matter with the Persian Government Aug. ]3 &amp; i927,to Pol. t00 ^ ^ le 0 pi n ion of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, suggesting res., p. 4208/27. that the objects to be secured appeared, on a preliminary examination, to be the following:— (a) The retention so far as possible, by the British Quarantine Officers of the Indian Medical Service in as unhampered a form as possible of the real executive authority in quarantine matters. (h) The regularisation ir possible of the whole basis of the service of the British Quarantine Officers under the Persian Government so as to give the maximum possible assurance that the Persian Government would regularly meet the amounts due on their salaries and on the disputed leave salary and pension contributions. (c) I hat there should be no question of interference by the Persian Government with the appointments, &amp;c., of individual British Quarantine Officers. to r.o. 468, Sept. P 24 C 0 lo n el Ha worth replied on 12th September 1927, agreeing, as did the 1927, p. 5030 /27. Chief Quarantine Medical Officer, with the Minister's conclusions. He suggested, however, that it was desirable that the Chief Quarantine Medical ^ P. 3754 27. Teh. Desp. 272, June 3 1927, P. 3396/27.3 , y Officer should be placed, for quarantine matters only, in a position of direct tie sjl subordination to the Sanitary Council at Teheran, not to the Persian ( t ^jl Director of Southern Health at Shiraz, an arrangement which would, he L 0 J| thought, result in preserving real executive authority in quarantine for'the HUl'(J Quarantine Medical Officer. Sir R. Olive, who agreed that this latter ts &lt;41 uiject would probably be attained if subordination to the Oentral Health l^Ji-authorities at Teheran (not necessarily to the Sanitary Council) could be s 0 | 1 secured, proposed (P. 5030) to discuss the question informally when oppor- Lg 7 tunity offered with the head of the Department of Public Health, and in the ;er ^J : light of such discussion to consider further the course to be followed. ■31 7. it was decided at the beginning of 1928 that further consideration of the quarantine question should be left over until the treaty negotiations then being undertaken with Persia had further advanced. On 18th January, the Teh.Desp.ssi Minister reported, however,* that the Budget Commission had recommended p 0 !^ 1 ^ 27 ' )ri that provision for the payment of British quarantine medical officers in the / Te h tei is 1 Gulf should be struck out of this year's budget. The Head of the National 344/28.' ' ^ Health Department had himself raised the question with the Oriental ere il Secretary,' assuring him that this was entirely contrary to his wishes, and being undertaken with Persia^had further advanced. On 18th January, the Teh.

Government were ready to regularise the position of the Indian quarantine ^ officers, and how long they expected the Persian Government to retain their services, as by law the Majlis would have to pass their contracts. The Oriental Secretary replied on the general lines set out in para. (J above, and suggested that a request should be made for seven-year contracts. I ^ 8. A month later, however,! the Budget Commission informed the Director- t Teh. tel. 52, Feb. •General of Health that immediate steps must be taken to replace the British 29: p - 1032 / 2 8- medical officers by the end of the present financial year, while the Persian Cabinet were also reported to be opposed to their continued employment.' 'The Director-General professed to hope to satisfy the Commission by retaining only one or two British doctors. He stated that he was convinced I that some concession must be made, and added that he had sufficient ^competent Persians to take over all the posts concerned. The Foreign Office took the line, with which the India Office agreed, that if the Persian Govern ment and the Persian Parliament were unwilling any longer to sanction the ■employment of all the British doctors at present enlployed in the Gulf | P 0 fl s » ^ would be difficult for His Majesty's Government to insist on their doing so, particularly in those posts in which the salaries of the officers had hitherto been paid by Persia^ In the light of the views of the Government j r.o. letter to 1.0, or India and the lolitical Resident, the Secretary of State for India agreed mar. 21928, p . 1032J moreover, that the ideal was that the present system should be retained both 13 at Mohammerah and at Bushire, Lingah and Bandar Abbas being given up when necessary, but that, ' from every point of view,' the maintenance of a il cloctor at Mohammerah was more essential than even at Bushire, -although at the latter place, as our headquarters in the Persian Gulf it was more important from the point of view of prestige. J. Matters reached a new stage with the conclusion of the first stas'e of the general negotiations with Persia in April. It will be remembered that it was then decided that an immediate decision should be taken on tariff -autonomy, the capitulations and certain subsidiary questions, but that the Persian Gulf and matters affecting it should be left over for further •discussion in the autumn the Minister of Court promising that in the meantime no action would be taken to alter the existiug state of things.' On the question of quarantine being raised with him in this connection, reyrnourtache said however, that m this matter the Budget (Commission of Majlis had cut out the proposed grant for the payment of English doctors, irvt-p i -^ q t was P owerIess - 0n .

But on the 10th May Sir Robert Clive informed the Foreign Office that tele g ram had been received from Colonel Haworth to the effect that a Persian April 24 1928.4 doctor was reported to be on his way to Mohammerah to relieve Assistant- Surgeon Lincoln as quarantine officer. This doctor had apparently left via Bnshire on the 5th May. On representations being made to the Minister of Court, stressing the extreme lack of courtesy to the Government of India and to the Vice-Consul at Moharmnerah (who is also the quarantine officerUa despatching a Persian doctor without any notification to them, TeymourtHC^ promised that instructions should be given that the Persian doctor should not at once require Dr. Lincoln to evacuate his house, and that he would consider the sending of an official letter expressing thanks for the services- in the past of Indian medical officers in the Gulf, and notifying the changed situation which had arisen from the refusal of the Majlis to vote money for foreign doctors, and the consequent decision of the Persian Government to appoint Persian doctors. The Minister added that the Persian doctor had categorical instructions to work in co-operation with the Anglo-Persian Oil * Teh. tel. 161, Company.'* On 4th May Sir P. Clive wrote to Teymourtache, forwarding a p a 2399/2 9 8 28 ' memorandum on the question and stating that he had telegraphed to Rushire, proposing that the necessary instructions should be sent to Dr. Lincoln to May 2ri928 51 ' collaborate with the Persian doctor despatched to Mohammerah by the p. 3018/28. Central Government. 11. The Government of India, in their telegrams of 13th May, No. 976-S (P. 2403), and 21st May, No. 1030-S, protested vigorously against the action of the Persian Government as being objectionable not only as likely to lead to quarantine inefficiency (responsibility for which, under the resolutions of the International Sanitary Conference of 1926, definitely rested with India), but as another deliberate blow at British prestige in South Persia and the Gulf. They suggested that strong representations, accompanied by a threat to dismantle the Duzdap Railway, should be made to the Persian Govern ment, and (on the assumption that finance was one of the chief difficulties), separately offered, in view of the interest of India in the question, to finance the quarantine themselves for, say, six months, to enable Persia to secure the foreign medical expert for whose recruitment as technical Counsellor to the National Health Department, the Majlis had given authority on the 29th April,, and to provide for the satisfactory transfer of quarantine arrangements from the Indian to the Persian medical officers. They suggested, too, that the Persian medical officer during the transitional period might usefully he attached to the Indian doctor to learn his work. 12. Meanwhile, however, Sir Robert Clive had reported that the Minister of Court had definitely agreed to send an official Note on the lines referred to- in para. 10 above, and to give definite instructions to the Persian doctors at Bushire and Mohammerah to consult and profit by the experience of the English quarantine doctors, in case the latter remained, and that Teymour tache had added that he had already taken steps to prevent the status quo in the Gulf being upset, but that this question of doctors depended on the t Teh. tel. 181, recent vote of the Majlis, and had nothing to do with his promise.! In a p.YslI 1928 ' despatch dated the 4th May, No. 20^, Sir R. Clive further stated that it was perfectly clear that the Persians had made up their minds to terminate the employment of the British quarantine officers. ' Teymourtache stated emphatically that this was not part of an anti-British policy. The Persian Government had no intention or desire to contravene our rights, but, as I was aware, it was now the established policy of the Persian Government not to engage in their service citizens of limitrophe countries. No foreigner could now be engaged in any capacity by the Persian Government without his contract first being approved by the Majlis. Although he personally recognised the good work done by British quarantine doctors in the past, it would be useless to submit to the Majlis contracts for the future employment of British doctors, as the Majlis would never approve such contracts. Sir Robert Clive, in the despatch in question, had recommended that His Majesty's Government should acquiesce, in the circumstances, in the Persian assurance that Persian quarantine doctors at Abadan and Moham- merah would have standing instructions to work in co-operation with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's medical officer, and that the matter should immediately be taken up with the Minister of Court, should the Company have reason later to believe that the Persian doctors there had not receivedsuch instructions, or were not acting in accordance with them. On the 21st May' :;j he added that, should the promised instructions not be given, and * Teh. tel. ise, this lead to inefficiency this summer, there would then be a strong case for 25] 26 May submission of the question to the International Sanitary Council, that the p . wis . f nglo-Persian Oil Company had offered for one yea'r to pay Dr. Lincoln an additional sum equal to what he would lose as quarantine officer on the understanding that his Persian successor would be bound to co-operate in all quarantine matters with the Company's medical officer, that, thanks to their helpful attitude, no difficulty need therefore be anticipated at Mohammerah, and that it was to be hoped that the British quarantine medical officer at Bushire, by maintaining tactful relations with the Persian doctor there, would in fact be able to see the quarantine service satisfactorily maintained. 13. In the light of the developments set out above, the Foreign Office on the 11th June, officially asked the concurrence of the India Office in the acceptance of the Minister's recommendations, forwarding at the same time p. 3018/28. a despatch from the Ministert in which Sir Robert Clive pointed out that t No. 251, May 21 Persia was entirely within her sovereign rights in sending her own doctors 1928 ' to the Gulf, that she was under no contract to the Government of India to maintain a British-controlled quarantine service, that she was not bound by any promise made at the last International Quarantine Conference not to do what she had done, and that, in the circumstances, the only possible policy was to minimise as far as possible any ill effects on onr prestige in the Gulf by the Persian action, and to endeavour to induce the Persians to continue to avail themselves of the wide experience and knowledge of the British quarantine officers, with a view to maintaining an efficient quarantine service. 14. At this stage the matter rested until July 1928, action being postponed by the India Office pending a decision on the proposal to set up a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the position of His Majesty's Government in the Gulf generally, and the subjects to be considered by that Sub-Committee. 15. On 13th July, however, the Charge d'Affaires at TeheranJ reported I Teh. tel. 223, that the Minister ol: Court had spoken to him with unusual vehemence on the quarantine question, stating that Persia must be allowed to take over at all costs and even hinting at the use of force. It transpired that the Persian attitude was to some extent due to the fact that Dr. Lincoln, the British quarantine officer at Mohammerah, had not yet been authorised by the chief quarantine medical officer, acting under the orders of the Government of India, to hand over control of his Persian successor and that effect had thus Teh. tel. toF.0,227, not yet been given to the arrangement agreed in May between the Minister p^es/S. 28 ' of Court and Sir R. Clive. 16. On 18th July the Foreign Office wrote to the India Office§ urging § P. 3755. their concurrence in regularisation of the position at an early date on the lines referred to in para. 12 above, and expressing the view T that the delay which had taken place in giving effect to the arrangements made in May with the Minister of Court w-as regrettable. On the same date the Government of India telegraphed that three Persian doctors had arrived in Bushire, one to take over the quarantine at Bushire, one for duty at Lingah, while the third expected early orders for Jask and a fourth was reported to be proceeding to Bunder Abbas. The Government of India, while strongly reiterating their previous protests against the relinquishment of control by His Majesty's Government, stated that they were ready to issue immediate instructions for the handing over of charge to the Persian doctors should His Majesty's ^ Government consider that this was necessitated by the discussions which had taken place at Teheran, or by consideration of the wider interests involved. The Indian officers would be instructed to afford all possible assistance to their successors. The Government of India added that the Charge d'Affaires would no doubt be able to arrange that the latter should be instructed to act in close consultation with the outgoing officers, who could be retained for say six months to see that the quarantine regulations were properly carried out and to give the new regime a fair start. 2979 a -r6 P. 3777/28. ♦ F.O. tel.

On 21st July the Secretary of State for India, in the light of the above developments, informed the Foreign Office that while entirely in agreement with the representations of the Government of India, he no longer felt able to resist the Foreign Office demand that matters should be regularised on the lines suggested by Sir R. Clive, and that he was prepared accordingly to agree to the transfer to Persia of quarantine control in the Gulf, on tW ; understanding that satisfactory arrangements would be made for handing over (a matter of importance to India in view of her responsibility under the International Sanitary Convention) and that all possible steps would be taken, to secure that so long as British doctors remained in the posts affected they should be in a position to co-operate effectively with their Persian successors,, and the maximum degree of effective control by British medical staff retained. The Charge d'Affaires at Teheran was authorised 0 by the Foreign Office on 25th July to inform the Persian Government accordingly, and under the orders of the Government of India, quarantine charge was handed over to Persia by the Chief Quarantine Medical Officer on 28th July 1928.t fedia O ffice, 9th August 1928. J. G. LCONFIDENTIAL. INDIA OFFICE, p ^224/28 KOWEIT, 1908-1928. A.—Administration. 1. Sheikh Ahmad-al Jabir, C.LE. (January 1922), born 1885, has ruled Koweit since March 1921, when his succession to his uncle, Sheikh Salira (bom 1864, succeeded 1017, died 23rd February 1921), who had ruled since the death of Sheikh Jabir Ihn Mabarak in 1917, was recognised by His Majesty's Government, subject, it would appear, to agreement to impose and enforce through his territory such further restrictions on the arms c.o. to e.g ., Iraq, April 2 traffic as might be considered desirable. On the invitation of His Majesty's 1921 ' p - 1758 / 21 - Government, the Sheikh visited the United Kingdom in October 1919, as the representative of his uncle, with the son of Ibn Sand, and was received by the King. His Excellency is entitled to a permanent salute of seven p. 4321/22. guns, the number having been reduced from 12 (personal) on his accession. 2. The principality is an independent Arab State, under British protection, but not a British protectorate.Its ruler is precluded by his * viceroy's tel. 1175 s., engagements, of which an abstract is printed in the Precis of Treaties oct. 8 1920, p. 7455. appended to this Memorandum, from receiving foreign representatives, and from ceding, leasing, mortgaging, or giving for occupation, or any other purpose, any portion of its territory to any foreigner or foreign Power without the sanction of His Majesty's Government; he is bound to suppress slave traffic and to prohibit traffic in arms within his territories ; and he has agreed not to give a concession for oil, or for pearl fishing, without the approval of His Majesty's Government. 3. The internal administration is conducted by the Sheikh, assisted in theory by an elected Council of Advisers (two from the Subah or reigning t Tel. from e . g ., Iraq, to family, four from the inhabitants, elected for one year), acceptance of 41921 ' which was made for the first time a condition of recognition by the people ^ Major More's Report, of Koweit on the accession of the present Sheikh.t The Council, though 1027, p. 2 (P. 2417/28)' duly elected, has, however, never met. J 4. His Majesty's Government and the Government of India are represented by the Political Agent (at present Major J. C. More, D.S.O.), an appointment created in 1904, maintained since that date save for a brief Lor. ii, 1039-4^). interval in 1905, and borne on the cadre of the Indian Political Department. The Political Agent is directly subordinate to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. He does not hold His Majesty's Commission as a Consul or exercise Consular functions. Under the Koweit Order in Council of 1925 (see paras. 24-27 below), he is the District Magistrate and Sessions Judge, and exercises his powers subject to the jurisdiction of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the limits of his jurisdiction are the territories and territorial waters of Koweit, and he exercises jurisdiction inter alios over British subjects and protected persons, and over the subjects and protected persons (not being subjects or protected persons of Muslim Governments) of Foreign States in respect of whom the Foreign States concerned may agree to the exercise of such jurisdiction. 5. The effect of the recommendations of the Masterton-Smith Committee of 1921 was to leave control of the internal administration and affairs of Koweit to the Government of India (to whom, and not to His Majesty's Government, the Political Resident in the Gulf was instructed in 1924 to c/. p. 1836/24 and 540 a /23. look for orders regarding them), subject to the general control of His Majesty's Government, and to the prior concurrence of the Colonial Office in matters of political significance. Questions of policy, especially questions m.s. Committee Report, affecting relations with Ibn Saud, fell to be dealt with by the Colonial Office. P ara - l2 - The question of the channels through which the instructions of His Majesty's Government are to issue on matters affecting the Principality is dealt with in para. 5 of the Note on Political Control in the Persian Gulf on page Jf. 6. Expenditure on Koweit is divided between His Majesty's Government and the Government of India. In the latest year for which figures are P. 3108/28. available (1926-7) it amounted to Rs. 45,683, plus payments in respect of pension contribution amounting to Rs. 9,423, a total of Rs. 55,106. 2979c 75 10.282 B.—History of Koweit Affairs, 1908-28. (1).—1908-19. 7. The history of Koweit up to 1907 is given in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908. At the time when that memorandum was composed and until the beginning of the War, Koweit was of vital interest to Gregts Britain in connection with the Baghdad Railway, and during the pericSr 1908-14 His Majesty's Government, in their relations with the Sheikh, had primarily in view the consolidation of their position and influence in Kovveit in the face of the efforts of Germany to establish herself at the head of the Gulf. Secret Desp. from India, 8. The vexed question of the rights of the Sheikh of Koweit over the p^isoo/os 101908 ' islands of Babiyan and Warba, dealt with in the Foreign Office Memorandum, was carefully investigated by the local authorities and the Government of India in 1907-9. The conclusions which emerged were that enquiry had gone far to establish the claims of the Sheikh to the ownership of Bnbiyan, Secret desp. to g . of i., 9, but that no satisfactory evidence had been produced as to his claims to April s 1910, p. 3i3o/io. Warba ; and in the circumstances His Majesty's Government decided that it was inadvisable to raise any question of the rights of the Sheikh to either island.

' to considerable correspondence, in the course of which His Majesty's iVmbassador at Constantinople was instructed to make clear the views on that matter of His Majesty's Government. Circumstances, however, intervened to make an immediate demarche by Sir G. Lowther from time to time unnecessary or undesirable, and the question merged in the general Anglo-Turkish negotiations initiated in 1911. p. 2062 /11. 10. Tme Sheikh undertook in 19 LI not to grant a pearl fishing concession to foreigners save with the prior approval of His Majesty's Government, and gave a similar undertaking as regards oil in 1913. Subsequent developments as regards oil concessions are dealt with in para. 29 below. With the assistance of^ a loan of ^j.-^,500 from the Government of India, arrangements weie made in 1914 for the installation by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, on behalf of the Sheikh, of a water distilling plant, which was not, however, * p. 4214/14 (ef *?9.), brought into operation until 1919.' :i: ' P. 2442/18, P. 5951/19. i 11. The question of Koweit played an important part in the Anglo- 1 ui kish negotiations of 1911—14. An agreement was reached, and a Convention, to give effect to it, signed on 29th July 1913. Under this agreement, m the terms of which the concurrence of the Sheikh had been I secured, the territory of Koweit was recognised as an autonomous caza of the Ottoman Empire; the Ottoman flag was to be flown bv the Sheikh, but he was to have the right to insert a distinctive emblem in the corner; he was to continue to be a lurkish Kaimakam, and his successors were to be appointed to a similar position by the Ottoman Government; the full administiative autonomy of the Sheikh was recognised within the territories of Koweit proper, the limits of which were defined by the red circle on Map iNo. 11 appended to this Memorandum; within a surrounding area (included within a green line on the map) which was occupied by tribes recognised as dependent on him, he was, as in the past, to continue to levy tribute and to perform the administrative duties of Turkish Kaimakam; in ot regions Iurkey undertook to abstain entirel}'from anv interference, though the right tc appoint a Commissioner at Koweit 'to protect the interests and subjects of other parts of the Empire' was secured to her; existing agreements between the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government, mcluumg the Secret Agreement of 1899, were recognised bv the Ottoman Government, and His Majesty's Government engaged that so long as no change was made in the vtatus quo as now defined, they would not alter the3 nature of British relations with the Groverument of Koweit or establish a Protectorate there. A subsidiary article (9) secured to the Sheikh the enjoyment of his private property in the Basra Vilayet. 12. The outbreak of war in August 1914 prevented the final ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement the substance of which is summarised ' above, and the entry of Turkey into the War in November 1914 against the Allies produced a completely new situation. The Sheikh, who had been informed officially on 8th August 1914 of the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Germany, on 21st August made a declaration of loyalty to His Majesty's Government on behalf of himself and his tribes/'' placed 'his * Tel. from Pol.

Political Resident in the Gulf, dated 3rd November 1914,1 was given the + See 4142 / 14 - following assurances, of which the third is the most important:—• (1) The date gardens which you now possess between Fao and Gurnah shall remain in the full possession of you and your heirs and be immune from taxation. (2) You are guaranteed by the Great British Government against all consequences of your attack against Safwan, Umm Kasr and Bubiyan. (3) Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection. 13. In February 1915 sanction was given to the transfer to Koweit of the J Tel. from s. of s. to a. Admiralty coaling depot at Bus hi re, J a step originally recommended by the g. of i^e^p^jime^iQio 5 Government of India in 1910, and approved in 1912 by the Foreign Office, p . 904/10; tei ; . from s. of s!

Sheikh Mubarak (K.C.I.E. 1911, K.C.S.I. 1914}, who had ruled p. 4449A /15. Koweit since his assassination of his brother in 1896, and who had consistently co-operated actively with His Majesty's Government, died on 28th November 1915, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Sheikh Jabir, who was informed in March 1916 by the Viceroy that u so long as you act Kharita, Feb. 2 1916, from up to existing arrangements with the British Government you may expect p^sl/ie Sheikh ' the same support as was enjoyed by your father.' 16. In the earlier part of 1915 Koweit had been brought in intimate Note by Arab Bureau, Irak contact with the affairs of Ibn Saud on the revolt of the Ajman tribe against Section, on Relations with the latter. The Ajman were finally routed in September, and forced to take r 712^7] 1917 ' refuge in Koweit territory, in which they remained until the death of Mubarak, immediately on which Ibn Sand pressed his successor, Sheikh Jabir, to expel the Ajman Sheikhs, a demand to which Jabir, reluctant to eject the Ajman lest they should be driven into the enemy camp, but unable to hold out against Ibn Sand's pressure without creating an open breach, finally yielded in February 1916. 17. Relations between Ibn Saud and Koweit had for some years before the death of Mubarak been growing cooler. Ibn Saud had latterly resented what he regarded as the equivocal attitude of the Sheikh during the negotiations between the Ottoman Government and himself in the spring of 1914; the asylum given to the Ajman was a further grievance,§ and the §p. 4906/16, incidence of the transit dues levied from time immemorial in Koweit, formed the subject of a complaint by the ruler of Nejd in 1916. But in a4 Darbar held at Koweit on 20th November 1916, and attended by Ibn Saud, the Sheikh of Mohammerah, Sheikh Jabir of Koweit and Sir Percy Cox, for the purpose of investing the Sheikh of Koweit with the C.S.I., the three If Tel. from Poi.

On the death on 5th February 1917, of Sheikh Jabir 'in whosofs * Report on situation in weak hands ' to quote the Political Agent,* Government in Koweit 'liar Koweit, March 1918, almost collapsed,' His Majesty's Government approved the recognition as ? 6^6°/1 18 ' successor of his brother Sheikh Salim, to whom an assurance similar to that granted to his predecessor and quoted above was conveyed by the Viceroy in March 1917. The new Sheikh w T as a man of very different calibre from Sheikh Jabir. Narrow in outlook, bigoted in religious matters, tactless in his personal relations, his marked individuality and strength of purpose none the less made it possible for the Political Agent to report in the Report by p.a., p. 2350/is. spring of 1918 that he had ' established himself in a brief space of time very securely in the Sheikhdom.' But the qualities which helped him to assert himself locally shortly set him at odds with both His Majesty's Government and Ibn Saud. 19. Difficulty arose with the latter over the Ajman tribe, whom Salim allowed in October 1917 to return to Koweit, and over the respective Tel. from sir p. cox to rights of Ibn Saud and the Sheikh to levy tribute on the Awazim tribe, S v%linl 84 ' Dec ' 20 anc ^ f orme d the subject of vigorous complaint by Ibn Saud at the end of 1917. In July 1918, Mr. Philby represented that Ajman activities based on Koweit territory were causing widespread resentment in Nejd and leading to remonstrance from Ibn Saud as to the inadequacy of p. 4130/18. our support. Measures to meet this grievance—the location of a Tea^om 0.0,^.^^0 mobile column in Koweit territory, the stationing of a British post ma, p. 4193/18 95 ' Sept ' 22 Safwan Wells, the occupation of Koweit itself—were under exami nation when, in September 1918, Lord Allenby's victories in Palestine made the removal of the blockade possible and temporarily eased the situation, and no action was taken beyond warning the leading Sheiks that if raids continued their subsidies would cease. 20. Difficulty with His Majesty's Government arose over the strict main tenance in Koweit territories and ports of the blockade imposed in (?) 1915|| with a view to preventing the leakage of supplies to the enemy, whether in Mesopotamia or in the isolated Turkish garrisons at Medina and elsewhere in the Arabian peninsula—a blockade, not unnaturally unpopular with Koweit merchants, the strictness of which was relaxed by Salim. The Sheikh subsequently adopted an attitude so obstructive in the matter that, after prolonged consideration, it w T as found necessary to warn him through the Political Resident, on 5th July 1918, that the assurances conve.yed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour, and that, should acts 'contrary to the interests of (His Majesty's) Government' ' unfortunately be committed in future,' he would be held personally !o T s el of f Tfor : t56l hdad ' ^sponsible.! The hint was not wasted ; the Sheikh for the remainder of July 8,1918, p. 2988/ is. the war maintained a less unsatisfactory attitude towards His Majesty's X Of. tel. from vieeroy to Government, J and his co-operation in the matter of the blockade was p.4698/ f i8.

Ihe termination of the war necessitated a decision as to the status of Koweit, which His Majesty s Government had promised in November 1° reco § n ^ se as ai1 independent principality under British protection.

Their view was accepted by the Secretary of State for India; the proposal was dropped and matters continued to rest on the declaration 1914 quoted in para. 12 above. On the general question of status ueing specifically raised in connection with the preparation of a Koweit Letter from f.o . to i .o.. Order in Council, the Foreign Office in July 1921 expressed the view 251921, P. 3495. that, from the legal standpoint and on the understanding that there was no intention of including Koweit within the boundaries of Mesopotamia, ''the status of this territory would appear to be governed by Article 132 of the Treaty of Sevres.' It was subsequently agreed that a final decision on the question o£ status must await the signature of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey, and, the Treaty of Lausanne having been signed in the autumn of 1923, steps were taken to introduce an Order in Council providing for British jurisdiction within the territory of the Sheikh. That territory, as stated in para. 2 above, may now be regarded as an independent Arab State under British protection, but not a British protectorate. 23. The questions of most importance which have arisen in Koweit since the conclusion of the War are the following :— A. Internal:— (1) Koweit Order in Council providing for British jurisdiction within the Principality. (2) Termination of the lease of Bunder Shweikh. External:— (1) Relations with Ihn Saud— (а) Koweit-Nejd-Iraq boundary question ; (б) Koweit-Nejd Customs question ; (c) The Akhwan menace. (2) Relations with Iraq— (а) Exemption from taxation of date gardens in Iraq of the Sheikh of Koweit; (б) Position of Koweit vis-d-vis Iraq. (3) Relations with Persia. I nternal Q uestions, 1919-28. {a) The Koweit Order in Council. 24. The question of extending the scope of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council, 1907,' had been under consideration before the War, but no decision had been reached upon it, the difficulty in respect of Koweit having principally been the undesirability of taking action before a settlement should have been arrived at with Turkey in regard to the Arab Littoral. In December 1919 the Civil Commissioner at Baghdad again raised- the question of passing a jurisdictional Order in Council for Koweit. The India Office expressed the opinion, however,! that, although the Order 1 1 .0. letter to f.o., June 8 was desirable in itself and though there would be advantage in issuing it at 1920 ' p - 3733 / 2a an early date, it was desirable to postpone action until a decision had been taken on the machinery for the administration of the Mesopotamian Mandate and the effect of the Mandate upon the relations of His Majesty's Government with contiguous countries. This view was accepted by the Foreign OfficeJ % f.o . to i.o., June u ■and the matter was allowed to rest for a year. i 020 ' p - 4660/20. 25. The question was again raised in the summer of 1921 by the High Commissioner in Iraq, who recommended (a view in which the Government of India concurred)^ that the promulgation of an Order in Council need not § Tel. from viceroy to be further delayed now that Turkey was recognised as having lost suzerainty 1921 VT its/^i S '' Feb ' 22r •over the Principality. The matter was referred to the Colonial Office who, under the recommendations of the Masterton-Smith Committee, had become responsible for policy on the Arab Littoral of the Persian Gulf. On reference to the Foreign Office they were informed that, from the legal point of view •and on the supposition that there was no intention of including Koweit within the boundaries of Mesopotamia, the status of that territory would seem to be governed by Article 132 of the Treaty of Sevres under which6 Tm-key renounced in favour of the principal Allied Povvers all rights ane! title over territories outside Europe not otherwise disposed of by the Treaty; that, in practice, provided some prior agreement were reached with the Sheikh of Koweit, it would appear unlikely that any Foreign Powers would 1 challenge the issue of an Order in Council on the lines of the Bahrein Order in Council of 1913 (although the extension of British jurisdiction, as in thg* order, to foreigners might involve the prior concurrence of some Foreign Powers), but that, while the High Commissioner in Iraq might be authorised c,o. to f.o., July 91921, to open negotiations with the Sheikh with a view to ascertaining the measure P.a 'to C.O., July 25 1921, of supervision which His Excellency was prepared to accept, the I p! 3495/21.' u ' y ' actual issue of an Order in Council consolidating any agreement that might be reached with the Sheikh should be postponed until the coming into force- of the Treaty of Peace with Turkey. 26. No further action was taken until the Treatj^ of Lausanne had been signed and, owing to the necessity for departmental examination of the provisions of the Order, the approval of His Majesty to an Order in Council was not finally obtained until 17th March 1025. Under the Order in question jurisdiction over British subjects and protected persons, the- subjects and protected persons of non-Moslem foreign Governments, and Koweit subjects or the subjects of other Moslem Governments registered in the Office of the Political Agent as being regularly employed by British, subjects or subjects of non-Moslem foreign Governments, was vested in the^ Political Agent subject to the general control of, and a right of appeal to, ^ Let ter n-Qm i\o, to i.o., the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It may be noted' ::: ' that, no- foreign Power having consented to the exercise of jurisdiction over its , nationals in Koweit by His Majesty, the Political Agent was instructed, at the request of the Foreign Office, that, in the event of a national of a non- Moslem Power committing some crime or misdemeanour necessitating: proceedings against him, or of such a person becoming involved in civil proceedings, the matter should at once, be. brought to the notice of His. Majesty's Government who, on learning that such a case had arisen, would take steps to ascertain from the Government of the person concerned whether they desired tHat the case should be dealt with under the Koweit Order in 19?6, 0 SJpt N 25 l i925, 011 of Council.

' but the concurrence of the Sheikh in the delegation of jurisdiction over tie io e 2i0M On jan c ^ asses ot P er30 n in question was not finally obtained until November 19254 r. 488/26. ' Since that date various Rules of Court and King's Regulations have been issued under the Koweit Order in Council, but no point of importance has- arisen in connection with its operation. 27. It may be recorded that, a clearer understanding as to responsibility,. \ as between the interested Departments of His Majesty's Government, for the | Ta^^S^^i/^sand internal administration of Koweit having been reached by that stage, the I ' a '' J ' 0 ' an preparation and issue of the Order in Council of 1925 were, by agreement I with the Colonial Office, left to be dealt with by the India Office in conjunction with the Foreign Office. (h) The Bunder Shweikh Lease. 28. The question of terminating the lease of Bunder Shweikh, the earlier history of which is given in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908, and the engagements entered into in connection with which by His Majesty's Government are shown in the Precis of Treaties appended to the present Memorandum, came up for consideration on the conclusion of the War- After considerable correspondence during 1919-20, the Government of India recommended in April ] 920 that the lease should be terminated as the Sheikh had maintained a consistently obstructive attitude towards His Majesty's Government. Uncertainty as to the status of Koweir, under the Peace Treaty, and consideration of the political effect on the Sheikh of withdrawal of the^ subsidy- which the rent of Bunder Shweikh in fact constituted, of the Tel. from H.C., Baghdad, possibility of bringing pressure to bear on His Excellency in other ways, | ■Etec 19 1920 P 9001/20 .the question of retaining the site at a reduced rent, &amp;c., prevented a Tel.from h.c. to s.s.fori. ^cision before the death of Sheikh Salim in February 1921.

The High Commissioner for Iraq reported in August 1922 that this decision had been communicated to and accepted by the Sheikh. There have been no further echoes of this question since hat date. It should be noted, however, that while the lease has been terminated, the Agreement does uot appear to have been abrogated, and that the reciprocal pledges exchanged on its conclusion in 1907 presumably, therefore, remain binding in so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments. Oil in Koweit. 29. In concluding the review of the more important post-war internal developments in Koweit, reference may conveniently be made to the '.question of oil. The Sheikh had agreed in 1913 (see para. 10 above) not to grant an oil concession without the approval of His Majesty's Government. Here, as in Bahrein, the question of obtaining a concession was revived by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1921, and His Majesty's Government, who were anxious to facilitate the establishment by the Company of control -over the oil resources of the north Arabian coast, agreed to the institution of negotiations, which were conducted through the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Lengthy negotiations have, however, so far proved unfruitful. (The general question of oil in the Gulf is dealt with in the Board of Trade Memorandum on page ^J.) E xternal Q uestions, 1919-28. (1) Relations with Ibn Saud. (a) Koweit-Nejd-Iraq Boundary Question. 30. Owing to the non-ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of ;29th July 1913, the boundaries of Koweit had, as explained above, been left in suspense on the outbreak of the War. Clause 6 of the Treaty concluded with Ibn Saud on the 20th December 1915, provided that the limits of Koweit territory should thereafter be determined. The question remained in a fluid state until the end of the War. 31. In January 1919, on Sheikh Salim proposing to build a fort at Dauhat Balbul, just north of JabalManifa, Ibn Saud took exception, claiming ;that the site in question lay within his territory. No overt act followed, but relations on this subject became increasingly strained, customs difficulties— the Sheikh having placed an embargo on exports to Ibn Saud's ports*— further aggravating the situation. Matters culminated in the surprise and defeat by Akhwan under Faisal-al-Dawish of the Koweit tribesmen, under Sheikh Dhaij, who had been sent by Sheikh Salim to contest Akhwan occupancy of Jariyah, at Hamdeh, near Janyah, on the 18th April 1920, from which point the friction between the Sheikh of Koweit and Ibn Saud became acute. The situation was briefly,! that the Sheikh claimed on his southern frontier the boundaries represented by the green line in the map attached to draft Anglo-Turkish Convention, which represented the area administered by his father. Sheikh Mubarak, over the whole of which, however, by August 1920 he had no longer effective control. Ibn Saud, on the other hand, claimed the southern portion of the area in question by virtue of the fact that the tribes ordinarily resident therein had since 1914 or thereabouts, been under his direct control, and not under that of Sheikh Salim or his predecessor. Sheikh Jabir. 32. During the summer of 1920, His Majesty's Government, with a view to determining the dispute, on which they had been approached by both parties^, authorised Sir Percy Cox, then High Commissioner in Iraq, to discuss the matter with Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit. Ibn Saud formally claimed§ the whole country up to the walls of Koweit, 'as in the time of Colonel Pelly,' and maintained that he had no cognisance of the boundaries of Koweit agreed between us and the Turks in 1913, and that such an agreement could not in any case be operative against him, especially .as he had himself recovered the El Hasa province from Turkey before the Major More's Memo.

Sheikh Salim, on the other hand, claimed to take advantage of the- frontier agreed upon between Turkey and His Majesty's Government, as embodied in the draft Anglo-Turkish Convention. Sir P. Cox, having heard both sides and formed his own conclusions, recommended that a meeting should be arranged during the winter of 1920 between the principals with p. 7555/20. a view to settlement. At this stage Sheikh Salim (who, like Ibn Sand, given an undertaking in writing to refrain from aggression pending the settlement of the issues by the mediation of His Majesty's Government), having failed to demobilise a considerable force which he had gathered Tel from H c., Iraq, to together at Jahra, at the head of Koweit Bay, was attacked by the Akhwan s e of s ^for i., b . 108, Oct. and an inconclusive if bloody fight ensued (October 1920). 13 1920, p. 7620/20. 33. Thanks to the good offices of the High Commissioner, it proved possible to avoid further hostilities, and negotiations continued until the i Tel from h c , Iraq, to earl y p arfc ^ 11 December 1920 Ibn Saud, who in November|| s. s.fori., 13944,!No'v. 16 had been invited to visit Basra with a view to reaching a settlement tJfs of s' for 1 ! ^ec. 1 ^' 'under the auspices of His Majesty's Government, expressed his willing- 1920, p. 8851 /20; letter from ness to accept the ex parte decision of the High Commissioner, but stated S ^ v ^' p ;n2'2i PerCy that he was unable to go to Basra owing partly to ill-health, and partly to internal political difficulties. In January 1921, no settlement having yet been reached, the Sheikh of Mohammerah offered to send his son Sheikh Chasib, accompanied by Sheikh Ahmed el Jabir, nephew and heir f Major More's Memo., presumptive of the Sheikh of Koweit, to Nejd^ to endeavour to arrange a p. 2417 /28. truce between Ibn Saud and Sheikh Salim. His offer was accepted and the mission left for Bahrein en route for Nejd in February, reaching Ibn Sand's camp to the north of Riyadh on the 2nd March. On the 4th March the news of the death of Sheikh Salim arrived, whereupon Ibn Saud stated that there was no longer any quarrel to settle or any need for a frontier between his * Tel. from p.a ., Koweit, territories and those of the Sheikh of Koweit' :;: *—an arrangement with which p ?26(3/2i Pril 27 1921 ' Sheikh Ahmed (whose succession was recognised by His Majesty's Government, t Kharita from viceroy to w ^ 10 renewed to him the assurances given to Sheikh Salimf), was reported at sheikh, J-iiy 19 1921, the time to be quite satisfied. (Ibn Saud had already been in formed J before p. 4384 /21. dg^h of Sheikh Salim, that His Majesty's Government recognised the p. Kowi ^S ^^prii 26 territory within the inner boundary (the red circle) shown on the map 1921,' p. 3266 /21. attached to the Anglo-Turkish Agreement as definitely appertaining ta Koweit and not open to dispute). 34. No further developments took place until November 1922, when at p 115/23. the Conference held at Ojair from 27th November to 3rd December between Sir Percy Cox and Ibn Saud (the Political Agent, Koweit, also being present) the Koweit-Nejd frontier came up for consideration. It was recognised at once that the power of the Sheikh of Koweit in the desert was much less than it had been at the time of the conclusion of the Anglo -Turkish Agreement of 1913, and a settlement was finally reached under which the frontier as between Nejd and Koweit starts from the junction of the Wadial Aujah with the Batin on the w^est; running thence (leaving Riqai to Nejd) in a straight line to the junction of the 29th parallel of latitude with the red semicircle on the map attached to the draft Anglo-Turkish agreement, and reproduced in Map 11 appended to this Memorandum ; thence following the red semicircle to the sea south of Ras al Qulaiah. The southern boundary of the recognised territory of Koweit was defined as above. It was simultaneously agreed that the tract of country bounded on the north by the above line, on the west by the Shaqq, on the east by the sea r and on the south by a straight line running eastward from the Shaqq the west through Ain al Abd to the sea north of Ras al Mishab, should be Koweit Diary for Dec. 1 -8 recognised as^ common to the two States of Nejd and Koweit, who were to 1922, para. 195, p. 463/23. enjoy equal rights in it until such time as a fresh agreement should be arrived at between them regarding it through the good offices of His Majesty s Government. This frontier, which had been negotiated on behalf p. 915/23. the Sheikh (Major More, the Political Agent at Koweit, representing his^ interests), was accepted by His Excellency on the 26th January 1923. 35. In April 1923 the Sheikh was informed that His Majesty's Government Letter from H.o., Iraq, to recognised the frontier claimed by him as between Koweit and Iraq and the - p.^7'^ ( 23. eit ' Al)ri1191923 ) attribution to Koweit of the Islands of Warba, Bubiyan, Maskan, Failakab r9 AuhaL, Kubbar, Qaru, and Uuam-el-Maradin—in other words, the frontier indicated by the green line of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of 29th July 1913. The frontiers of Koweit are accordingly as shown od Map II attached to the present Memorandum. Since 1923 no difficulty has arisen in regard to them. [b) Customs dispute between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit. 36. The difficulty is not a new one ; it dates from before the war. With the acquisition of El Hasa by Ibn Saud in 1913, Nejd acquired a sea front, but the sea front in question contained no port of any real value, and the P. 1276/24. efforts made from time to time by Ibn Saud, with the assistance at intervals of His Majesty's Government, to secure that steamship lines such as the British Indian Steam Navigation Company should call at Ojair or at Qatif, or to develop Ojair, Qatif or Jubail, have proved abortive. In these circumstances a friendly understanding with the Sheikhs of Bahrein and Koweit on the question of customs and transit dues is of great and evident importance to the Ruler of Nejd. Agreement with Bahrein, on the basis of a transit duty of 2 per cent., was reached in 1920, after long discussion and much ill-feeling, with the assistance of the Government of India. Agreement with Koweit, which in 1923 levied a 4 per cent, duty on imports and a further 4 per cent, transit duty, has not yet been reached ; and since p - 2999 l 23 - 1920 Ibn Saud has in consequence maintained an embargo on trade with Koweit with the result that the prosperity of the Principality, as indeed of Qasim and Hail in Nejd, has been seriously affected. 37. The position is briefly that Ibn Saud, on the ground that it is impossible to collect import duty on the desert frontier between Kuwait and Nejd, is anxious for the establishment either of a Nejdi Custom House in Koweit town, or of an arrangement under which export duty only should be collected on his behalf at Koweit, a fixed sum being paid to Nejd instead of * cp. Major More's Memo, import duty. A third proposal,* made in 1923 by the Sheikh's cousin s.v. Abduiiah-as-Saiim. Abdullah-as-Salim, was that the embargo should be raised on terms which would have involved the payment to Ibn Saud, through an Agent and Collector stationed in Koweit (Abdullah-as-Salim himself), of the whole of the customs dues on goods exported from Koweit by land other than those destined for the Sheikh's own subjects or for Iraq.| p. 3476/23*. 38. The objection of the Sheikh of Koweit to an agreement on the lines referred to above would appear to be due as much to the fear of allowing Ibn Saud to establish a stranglehold over Koweit as to anxiety to secure an arrangement which shall not be economically unsatisfactory from his own point of view. An arrangement which would enable Ibn Saud to collect his own dues in Koweit would, as the Government of India pointed out in December 1923, _ appear prima facie to contravene both Ibn Sand's engagements to His Majesty's Government, and those into which His Majesty's Government have themselves entered with Koweit; while the extension in Koweit of the influence of the King of the Hejaz and Nejd would in any event be objectionable—the engagements to Koweit of His Majesty's Government apart—on general political grounds. 39. There has been no development of importance in recent years, though the position cannot be satisfactory from the point of view of either Koweit or Nejd. A settlement which would be fair to both parties and unobjectionable from the standpoint of His Majesty's Government could best be reached on the lines suggested in July 1923 by the then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, which were accepted at the time by the Colonial Office and the India Office. Colonel Knox's recommendation was that steps should be taken to obtain the agreement of Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit, firstly to the appointment of a Customs expert, preferably from India, to advise on the reform of the Koweit Customs, and on the shares of the Customs revenue to be apportioned to Nejd and Koweit respectively, and, secondly, to the appointment for five 3^ears of an official to serve under the control of the Political Agent and carry out the recommendations made by the Adviser. But in February 1924 the Political Resident reported that, proposals on c.o .ietter to 1 .0., 35969/23, these lines having been put to the interested parties, 'neither Ibn Saud nor Aug. s 1923,p.2999/23. 2979c B t June-July 1923,10 P. 1004/24.

The Akhwan raids on Iraq by Feisal-al-Dawish and the Mutair tribe at the end of 1927 had, however, more important reactions on the Principality.§ At the request of the Sheikh His Majesty's Government agreed to aerial reconnaissance over his territory; and, with his concurrence, it was later decided to withdraw the restrictions originally imposed by His Majesty's Government on bombing in pursuit of raiders within Koweit territory. An Akhwan raid was successfully dealt with by Koweit forces at El Hiqai on 27th January 1928,|| and whilst retiring into Nejd was pursued and successfully attacked by the Royal Air Force on two following days. A further raid occurred late in February, which was not opposed by ground forces, but was again successfully pursued by the Royal Air Force for two days. In view of the possibility of further serious developments, and of the recognised liability of His Majesty's Govern ment under existing engagements for the 'protection of Koweit' (a phrase the exact scope of which is open to argument^), further defence measures were now taken. A temporary air base (political objections to a permanent station being regarded as conclusive, cp. para. 47 below), was established in Koweit: a flight of aeroplanes and a detachment of armoured cars were despatched to the town for its' protection ; three vessels of the Persian Gulf squadron (later reduced to one) were stationed off Koweit itself, and a landing party disembarked and remained on shore until the crisis had passed. All action taken was taken with the concurrence of the Sheikh, who was, in addition, allowed to purchase from the Government of India a small supply of machine guns and Lewis guns. After some discussion His Majesty's Government and the Government of India agreed that His Excellency might be allowed to purchase armoured motor cars, on the understanding that they would be used only for defence, and would not cross the borders of Koweit in repelling raids save with the concurrence of the Political Agent. The crisis, however, passed off without incident, and the special forces which had been de^spatched to Koweit w 7 ere withdrawn during the late spring. For financial reasons the Sheikh abandoned the idea of purchasing armoured cars.** 41. Consequent on the breakdown of the negotiations with Ibn Sand in the summei of 1928. and the possible danger of a revival of Akhwan activity on the Iraq-Nejd border, the question of granting discretion to the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, to carry out reconnaissances by air or car over Koweit territory was raised by the Air Ministry. ^ 42. The 'very obvious and grave political objection' to air recon naissance over Koweit was emphasised by Sir Gilbert Clayton. After considerable discussion between the Departments concerned, the Air Officer Commanding was finally authorised to carry out occasional reconnaissances both by air and car, at his discretion, on the understanding that the concurrence of the Sheikh should be obtained, through the Political Resident; that reconnaissance should be carried out as infrequently and in as unpievocative a manner as possible; that the Sheikh should be given u no grounds for supposing that the Royal Air Force have assumed responsibiiiry for the defence of Koweit or that he himself has been: relieved of his obligations in this respect'; that save in case of real emergency reconnaissance should not be carried out within 25 miles of the Nejd-Koweit frontier nor in the immediate vicinity of the Nejd-Iraq,@ 11 frontier in the neigtibourliood of the neutral zone j and that the authority given should operate only for the period of the present emergency. The question of the establishment of an advance air base in the event of a raid was reserved for further consideration if and when the need arose. (2) Relations with Iraq. (1) Question of exemption from taxation of date gardens in Iraq of the Sheikh of Koweit. 43. As will be seen from para. 12 above, one of the guarantees given on 3rd November 1914 to the Sheikh of Koweit was that his date gardens on the Turkish side of the Shatt-el-Arab should remain in full possession of you and your heirs and immune from taxation.' 44. At the time when the Financial Agreement, arising out of Article 15 o f Anglo-Iraq Treaty of lOth October 1922, was under the consideration of His Majesty s Government, it was proposed that a provision to safeguard the right of the Sheikh under the guarantee referred to above should be inserted c T , This proposal was subsequently abandoned, and the High Commissioner was See R 4537/27 - instructed m iWmber 1923 to treat this obligation separately under Article 10 of the Angh&gt;Iraq Treaty. Owing to an oversight, the point was omtted when the exchange of Notes defining the obligations of Iraq and His Majesty s Government under Article 10 of the Treaty took place ; and on the matter coming to notice some other method of safeguarding the rights o± the Sheikh under the guarantee in question had to be devised. Ihe Iraq Government, on being approached, expressed the opinion that the immunity m question could not properly be continued in the circumstances without the authority of a special law, and that, if special legislation were introduced, it would be rejected by the Iraq Parliament. They stated that they were, in the circumstances, unwilling to take the responsibilitv of mtroducmg such legislation, and desired that the matter should be referred ro , „ t TO to His Majesty s Government. 4o.The Foreign Office, Colonial Office and India Office agreed that there was no ground on which His Majesty's Government could justify the discontinuance of the immunity from taxation hitherto accorded to the Sheikh of Koweit, as to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. After considerable discussion it was, however, decided that it was undesirable to give prominence to the question by the insertion in the revised Financial Agreement of a provision to cover it if any other method of safeguarding the position be found; and that this might be regarded as having been attained it the Iraq Government accepted the reference in the Memorandum accompanying P - 6147/27 - Article 3 of the revised Treaty between His Majesty's Government and Iraq (which provided for the recognition by the Iraq Government of British international obligations m respect of Iraq) to the immunity from taxation of the date gardens of the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah as one of the international obligations in question. No objection having been raised to r. 01t . f ,,,, t the inclusion of the undertaking in question by the Iraq delegates. His Majesty s Government in January 1928 placed on record their assumption 1927 - that the Iraq Government were now prepared to recognise those undertakings as part of the international obligations which His Britannic Maiestv had undertaken to see carried out in respect of Iraq, and to recognise that they had inherited the duty of ensuring that those undertakings were fullv discharged The High Commissioner was instructed to inform the Iraq Para. 3 of c.o.

No information is available as to any subsequent developments. (2) Position of Koweit vis-d-vis Iraq. 4(1 Under the engagement of 1914 between His Majesty's Government and the Sheikh of Koweit, the Principality of Koweit is recognised as an independent Principality and as entitled to the protection of His Majesty's Government, by whom, as stated in para. 35 above, the present Koweit-Iraq boundary was recognised in 1923. Formally, therefore, there is no question of its absorption by Iraq. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has, however, recently drawn attention (as the result of an incident in which an Iraq officer was alleged 1o have despatched an Iraq police inspector to Koweit to arrest and bring back an offender from there) to the danger of Koweit and Iraq becoming, in the minds of the native community, unified under British protection. Sir Lionel Haworth remarked' 5 that 'it must be an essential part of our policy that Koweit should be kept apart from Iraq—it is inevitable that it should be the tendency of Iraq gradually to assimilate Koweit even if there is no conscious knowledge of the fact among the officials of the Iraq Government. Such tendencies result, not from direct action, but from psychological factors, from tke dependence of the Sheikh of Koweit upon Iraq for assistance, from the appointment of Iraq officers to Koweit during the raids, and from the common interests of people, alike in race and religion, dependiDg upon the same market centres and in constant daily communication. It is, indeed, perhaps the natural development that Koweit should draw close to Iraq while, we are there, but we do not desire her to get so close that, with the development of time, she would be left there when we leave in spite of our wishes . . . It is for us to see . . . that such help as Koweit may require may be obtained from assistance from our Navy and the training of her people—and it would be better that such training should be given from India and not from Iraq. Koweit should be trained to look to His Majesty^ Government and India alone and not to a country under our Mandate.' 47. 1 he Political Resident had earlier in 1928 urged the undesirability from the point of view alike of the immediate situation and of our future policy of linking Iraq and Koweit in the mind of Ibn Saud by establishing an air base^ against Akhwan raiders in Koweit territory. He reiterated his objections in connection with the proposals dealt with in paras. 40 and 41 above. On both occasions the Government of India expressed their general agreement in the view taken by him. (3) Relations with Persia. 48. No question affecting the relations between Koweit, and Persia appears to have arisen in the period .now under consideration, and it would be unnecessary to refer to the relationship between the two countries were it not for the information which has recently been received that a Persian instruction has been issued to the local Persian officials in the Gulf that the Persian Government can recognise no Arab rulers on the Arab coast of the Gulf, and that all persons belonging to and arriving from Koweit (as from Muscat, Bahrein and the TruciaP Sheikhdoms) are to be considered Persian subjects, and Persian passports to be issued to them. 49. It is impossible at the present stage to estimate the importance to be attached to the information quoted above. It may, however, be placed on record that no evidence has been traced of effective exercise' in the past of Persian authority in Koweit. The two incidents on which a Persian claim might possibly be based are- first, that KoWeit was regarded in 1775 as a dependency of Basra, and that a claim might therefore be put forward in view of the fact that Persia had occupied that town from 1775 to 1779 even though Persian authority does not appear in the same period to have extended to Koweit. The second and mote iiifipQiitent incident is that Of 1899. U13 e | October of that year it was ascertained that the Sheikh of Koweit had ^ j .undoubtedly applied through the Sheikh of Mohammerah to be taken under ^ Persian protection. Mr. Lorimer suggests that this move/which the Sheikh, ^ | it is stated, took no pains to conceal, was perhaps contrived by His Excellency merely with a view to testing the degree of interest taken in Koweit by His f Majesty's Government. The Sheikh's advances were, however, in any case | rejected by the Shah. C.—Summary. 50. In conclusion, it may be remarked that, while the present Sheikh is far frorn^ an outstanding personality, internal conditions in Koweit at the present time show a marked improvement on the position on the death of :SheikhSalim in 1921 In August 1920f local feeling was reported to be t Tel ft o m c.c, to s. of s, running nign against bneikn oalim, owing to the loss of trade resulting from for ^ 1 0452, Aug. 29 1920, his quarrel with Ibn Saud, to his general incapacity as a ruler and to his total P ' 6499/20 - lack of tact, and it would appear that a cowp d'etat was more than a possibility J had not the Sheikh died at a critical period of the Koweit-Nejd t cv tei from hc boundary negotiations on 23rd February 1921.

The boundary question has been settled and Abdullah - a8 - Sa g ar - on a basis not unsatisfactory from the point of view of Koweit; the question of British jurisdiction within the Principality has equally been regularised ; internal conditions are not such as to call for serious animadversion and', while the Sheikh, as stated above, is not an outstanding personality, he is not only well disposed towards His Majesty's Government but, from the point •of view of internal administration, may be regarded as a not inefficient ruler ™ ™ » when judged by Arab standards. faS More s Report ' 51. On a broad view, the importance of Koweit is less great from the standpoint of His Majesty's Government than that of Bahrein or of Muscat: but its absorption, or the establishment in it of a dominating influence, by Ibn Saud, could not but react injuriously on the position of His Majesty's Government alike in Iraq and in -Bahrein and along the Trucial Coast. Hitherto it has been possible to maintain British influence without substantial interference in the internal affairs of the Principality ; the recent activities of the Akhwan have led to formal appeals by the^Sheikh to the guarantees of protection which he holds from His Majesty's Government, and it is to be hoped that the standing threat to his independence constituted by his powerful neighbour in Nejd and the effective assistance given him against the Akhwan during the present year may help to continue to keep him generally amenable to British influence. The desirability, at the same time, of securing that the Sheikh shall not escape absorption by Ibn Saud only to end by absorption in an Iraq, no longer nnder British mandate, and the increased importance which his Principality, situated at the head of the Gulf, will assume as British control decreases in Iraq, cannot be overlooked in considering the general policy to be adopted in the Principality by His Majesty's Government. D—Points referred to Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. 52. The points in connection with Koweit which have been specifically mentioned in connection with the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub- Committee are :— (a) Whether the maintenance of the independence of Koweit (as of Muscat and the Trucial Chiefs) which is constantly threatened by Ibn Saud, is necessary for British purposes, and, if so, how is it to be secured ? (P.G. 3 viii, P.G. G (2) c. i.) Q&gt;) The position as between Iraq and Koweit—desirability of keeping Koweit clear from absorption in Iraq, Or from coming under Iraa influence. (P.G. 6, 2 (6) (3).) (c) Extent to which His Majesty's Government should increase or decrease the interest taken and the control exercised bv them in Koweit. (P.G. 6, 2 (c) 5.)14 E.—Views of Government of India. Tel. from viceroy to s. of s. 53, Tn this connection the Go vernment of India have expressed the view 1928 T July 23 m aintenance of the independence of Koweit (as of Muscat, Bahrein, and the Trucial Chiefs) is necessary in British interests ; that the veiled' protectorate at present exercised over them by His Majesty's Government suffices against European encroachments ; that so long as we do not alienaf: Arab opinion by attempting undue westernisation it suffices also against encroachments by Wahabi State, and that if need be, it can be more explicitly asserted.

Lorimer : Persian Gulf Gazetteer I. i. 814); (d) given permission to correspond direct with London, should necessity arise. 10. After consideration of the views of Capt. Bray, Major Dickson, then Political Agent, the Political Resident and the Civil Commissioner, Mesopotamia, the Government of India on 5th May 1920' ::: ' informed Sheikh Abdulla that the procedure for the selection of the members of the Majlis 1920, p. 5040. ay ' was laid down in the Bahrein Order in Council and that it was not within their competence to alter it, but that in practice the Arab representatives were understood to be appointed by Sheikh Isa, and that although this appointment was subject to the approval of the Political Agent as representing the Protecting Power, the Political Agent would never interfere or refuse his approval without just cause ; that as regards his third point, the request was an old one which had received much consideration, and that the Government of India remained unable to accede to it in view of the difficulties involved ; while as regards direct correspondence, the political relations of Bahrein were conducted with the Government of India and that it was proper therefore that His Excellency should address them and not His Majesty's Government. They would if necessary forward his correspondence to His Majesty's Government. As regards the first and most important request, the Government of India agreed that he should exercise jurisdiction over the subjects of other Arab rulers, subject to the formal concurrence of those rulers. Ibn Saudf, however, and the Sheikh of Katr, the one previously, the + p - 5040 ' Ibn SaiKl ' -other subsequently, took exception to the exercise of control over their c.a; Baghdad,toG^i, subjects by the Sheikh of Bahrein, and requested the Political Agent to 4601, April 151920. •exercise the jurisdiction in question. The Political Agent in consequence issued on 20th November 1920,$ a notice that all foreign subjects, including t Des P- f rom Pol. Res. to Persians and subjects of Arab rulers and Chiefs other than those of Bahrein, Sept r '1927 2 p 5 sees / 1? 28 ' were, while in Bahrein, entitled to British protection. The transfer to the Political Agent of jurisdiction over all foreigners did not improve relations between the Political Agent and Sheikh Isa, already none too good as a result of the interference by Government in a dispute between the Sheikh and Ibn Saud as to the duty to be levied on goods proceeding to Hasa, consequent on which Sheikh Isa had been compelled to accept 2 per cent. duty instead of the 5 per cent, which he desired, and in which he regarded § Tel ' from ^ &gt;o1 - ^ es - t0 ^ Government as having favoured Ibn Saud at his expense.§ r igs^o Sept ' 23 iq20 ' 11. I his condition of affairs coincided with an internal crisis of a different character, which was destined to lead up to drastic intervention by His Majesty's Government and the deposition of Sheikh Isa. The difficult situation produced by the Sheikh's misgovernment, and its reactions on the position of Great Britain in the Islands, have already been mentioned. Captain Bray, in May 1919, expressed the opinion that there was in Bahrein a considerable feeling of hostility to His Majesty's Government 'due to Bray to C.C., religious, economical, personal and war reasons,' and no British party, and ay 27 J919 ' that the activities of the American missionaries were anti-British.

Daly, C .I.E.) in 11)21, and led by the end of that year to a deputation to ask lor intervention to the Political Resident in the 1 eisian .J Gulf. 12 The Resident accepted the position, and suggested to the Government of India that a possible solution might be that the Political Agent should be empowered to intervene in cases of gross oppression and g.ve individual protection where necessary.® Earlier in 1921 Sheikh Abdulla had taken alarm at the rising discontent, and Sheikh Isa had appointed his heir. Sheikh Hamad, to take over control under his orders, but the masterful wife of Sheikh Isa had prevented any advance. The attitude of the people became, however, sufficiently alarming to lead Sheikh Hamad and sheikh Abdulla earlv in 1922 to take certain minor steps in the direction of reiorrn, and the Government of India, who in January 1922 had stated that they were not prepared to consider drastic intervention until all local resources had been exhausted and intervention was imperative to secure the protection of foreioners and the position of His Majesty's Government m the Islands, and who remained anxious to avoid interference if it could be avoided, informed the Resident in the light of this that while it was most undesirable that they should be drawn into interference between the Sheikh and his subjects, they were prepared to lend their moral support to an honest attempt by the Sheikh to put his scheme into force. They emphasised that nothing should be done to encourage the idea that reforms were being introduced by the Sheikh at the dictation of Government. 13 The reforms, however, proved illusory ; the internal situation continued threatening - the Foreign Office, wbo in March 1922 had urged the taking of immediate^steps of reform, in view of the prejudicial effect on the position of His Majesty's Government in Persia of ' the present highly unsatisfactory state of affairs in Bahrein,'! again represented the necessity for action in the interests of the Shiah subjects of the Sheikhs, on 29th May 19224 Ihe Secretary of State for India referred the matter to the Government of India, and they to the Resident in the Gulf. The Political Agent thereupon recommended a postponement of action, partly to enable developments to be watched, partly to appraise the importance of the interest in Bahrein affairs, of Ibn Sand, and this recommendation was accepted; but by the end of 1922 the Political Resident was obliged to report that the state of affairs in Bahrein called for reform more urgently than ever, and that Government must be prepared to back up moral pressure by material force if the required reforms were to be carried through. 14. Finally, in April 1923,§ the Government of India, who recognised that if the status of Bahrein and our position in the Islands was brought before the League by Persia, ' misrule would be the only serious flaw m our case,' recommended that if Sheikh Isa could not be persuaded to take the necessary steps himself, he should be deposed, his son Abdulla deported, and the required reforms carried out by the Government of India. His Majesty's Government approved action on these lines, and Sheikh Isa proving obdurate, he was deprived of his control on 26th May 1923, and granted an allowance, 11 and his son, Sheikh Hamad, appointed to act for him 'as his father's fully empowered Agent.' It was found unnecessary to deport Sheikh Abdulla. Appeals by Sheikh Isa to the High Commissioner for Iraq and the Viceroy, culminating in an appeal in 1925 to the Secretary oi State for India, were rejected. (2) 1923—1928: Sheikh Hamad. 15.

On the recommendation of the Political Resident in the Gulf, the Government of India, with much reluctance, agreed in 1923 to the permanent appointment of a British Director of Customs (this on the request of the Sheikhs—post filled January 1924), and the raising of a small force to maintain order (raised 1924, changed to an armed police force, in 1926, under a British officer); p - 3 393/24,2432/25. while in 1926 a European Adviser was appointed to deal with judicial', financial and general administration. All these officials were, in fact, appointed on the recommendation and with the approval of Government] though they are the servants of the Sheikhs and formally appointed by them! 16. The correspondence which has passed since 1923 between the 1. Tel. from G.of i.toPoi. Government of India and the Political Resident in the Gulf shows increasing r i^om' M ^ U192 ^ reluctance on the part of the former to assume full responsibility for the 2. Ditto, 1688 s., Dec. 8 control of Bahrein, or to do more than carry the Sheikh wholeheartedly with Poi them m the path of reform while avoiding the 'Westernisation' of his o. of 1..712 s., Dec.21 State. It is understood that in pursuance of this policy they have had under 1923 ' V - A87 ' 24 - consideration the diminution of the overt signs of British influence in Bahrein , that the ILuiopean Director of Customs has now been given a year's notice and will not be leplaced ; that the fLuropean police officer may also be dispensed with, and that an ultimate concentration under a single competent European, such as the present Financial Adviser, of direct responsibility for their Departments is in contemplation. 17. In the discussions between the Sheikhs and the Political Agent which took place consequent on the reassertion in December 1927 of the Persian claim to Bahrein, it is satisfactory to be able to record that while Sheikh Pol. Kes. to g . of 1., Isa remained sensitive regarding the maintenance of his internal inde- March 30 1928 ' p&lt; 2442 - pendence Sheikh Hamad, the de facto ruler. Sheikh Abdulla, and also bheikh Salman, the eldest son of Sheikh Hamad, are stated bv the Political Resident to have displayed anxiety, in their own interests, to 'admit to the lull the protection of Great Britain. 18 The policy of His Majesty's Government in Bahrein is one of the points for consideration by the present Sub-Committee, and on the decision on it must tuin the decision on the degree of interference and control to be exercised over the internal administration of the Islands. But it is pertinent to quote the remarks of the Political Resident in the Gulf, made though they were before the situation was modified by the reassertion of the Persian cW to suzerainty, m his Despatch- of 1st September 1927 : - * To G . o£ I No 295 s We^ cannot lose Bahrein.

C.—Oil in Bahrein. 19. The Sheikh agreed in 1914 not to grant an oil concession without the appioval of His Majesty s Government. The question of obtaining a concession was revived by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, who appear originally to have raised it m 1918, in 1921. Negotiations on their behalf were undertaken with the Sheikh of Bahrein through the Political Resident, out agreement proved impracticable, and in the event a concession, grantino- an exclusive exploration licence for a period not exceeding two years, subject to renewal by the Sheikh, acting on the advice of the PoliticarResident, for certain further periods, was signed by the Sheikh of Bahrein (also with the appioval of His Majesty s Government) in favour of the Eastern and General ^heikh^bat^ll f t ece r 1925. It was decided in 1928 to advise the roi. Res. to c.o., Aug, i + that all future agreements with oil companies should contain a clause 1928 ' :p - 4927 - with tw r no alienation ofrights whatever could be made, except with the sanction of the Sheikh and the approval of His Majesty's BoarfTof t* h m 6 ® eile \ question of oil in the Gulf is dealt with in the .ooard 01 Irade Memorandum on page 157.)6 D.—External Relations of Bahrein (other than with His Majesty's Government) 1908-1928. 20. During this period the dominating and almost the only question j affecting the external relations of Bahrein remains that of its status vis-d-visd Turkey and Persia. I.—Turkey and Bahrein. 21. An agreement between Great Britain and Turkey, signed on 29th July 1913, as part of the general negotiations between His Majesty's Government and the Ottoman Government, but, like the other agreements concluded in the course of these negotiations, awaiting ratification on the outbreak of war, finally disposed of the Turkish claim to suzerainty, which must in any event have been practically effected by Ibn Saud's capture of Hasa in 1913. By Article 13 of the Anglo-Turkish Convention the^ Ottoman Government renounced all their claims to the Islands of Bahrein, the^ independence of which they recognised; His Majesty's Government declaring^ on their part that they had no intention of annexing the island. His Majesty's Government undertook in Article 11 of the same Convention not to allow the Sheikli of Bahrein to disturb the autonomy of the peninsula of El Katr, or to annex it, and in Article 14 that the Sheikh should not discriminate against Ottoman subjects in the matter of dues levied upon pearl fisheries, while the Turkisli Government accepted a reservation of the right of the population of Bahrein to visit Zakhnuniyeh Island for fishing, and recognised the right of subjects of the Sheikh to British consular protection in Turkey. Owing to tlie outbreak of war, the agreement in question was never ratified ; but the Turkish claim to Bahrein would seem to have disappeared with tlie disappearance of the Turkish Empire and the elimination of Turkey from the Persian Gulf, and no endeavour has been made to revive it since the end of the war. II.—Persia and Bahrein. (a) 1908-1922. 22. Despite the nine repudiations enumerated in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908, the Persian claim was kept alive in the years 1908-14. Representations made by His Majesty's Minister at Tehran to the Persian Government in 1908 in regard to the punishment of a Bahrein subject at * Teh. tel. 95, .\prii u Lingah, 0 produced the reply that instructions had been sent to Lingali u to make reparation and do the man justice,' but that, as to the question j of Bahrein, the Minister ' will admit that the proprietary right of the Persian Government over the Island is not a matter to be disputed.' Considerable subsequent discussion took place with the Persian Government, with a view to the withdrawal of this Note or the modification of its terras. In view of the fact that His Majesty's Government considered it inopportune to raise the question of Bahrein in its general aspect, a somewhat gentler line was taken with the Persian Government than was perhaps altogether consistent with the attitude adopted before and since by His Majesty s Government; and it was only after unsuccessful efforts to secure the substitution of a modified version that the Persian ISlote was returned as t Teh. Desp. 10 of Jan. 22 inadmissible to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.*!* The Persian Foreign 1909. Office thereupon declared that, if the Note returning the objectionable communication could be withdrawn, the Persian Government would send in substitution for the latter an amended Note in the sense desired, adding that, if this arrangement was not accepted, they would be obliged to send a strong reply to the British Note. The Minister remarked that this would have raised the general question of Bahrein, for which the moment was clearly inopportune, and that he had therefore accepted the proposed arrangement. The amended Note was accepted, and the matter closed with a Note from His Majesty's Minister dated the 13th May 1909, acknowledging receipt and reaffirming that His Majesty's Government maintained, as regards the status of Bahreinis in Persia, the position that the Island of Bahrein and its inhabitants were under British protection, and that they would be guided entirely by their own views of the position should any action of the Persian Government make representations necessary.23. Early in 1910 the Persian Government assimilated the formalities to be fulfilled in the case of persons visiting Bahrein to those prescribed in the case of travellers to Persian ports, a measure which, as pointed out by the Foreign Office at the time, constituted a fresh attempt to assert Persian sovereignty over the Island 4 It was agreed that, in view of the desirability t Teh. Desp. 65, April 26 of avoiding raising of the general question, no protest should be made. i9io, p. 3539/10. 24. In July 1910 the Political Resident reportedft that internal Persian ttP 3655/io. coastal passes issued to Persians proceeding to .Bahrein from Persian ports were visaed by a Persian merchant residing in Bahrein, who was also in the habit of issuing similar passes (' Ilm-o-khabar ') to Persians proceeding from Bahrein to Persian ports, and His Majesty's Government approved a proposal that the merchant in question, Abdul Nabi, should be expelled . from the Island.§ For various reasons it proved necessary to suspend action !u^ie 1910. tehran ' 219 ' •on this authority, but in 1912 Abdul Nabi was forbidden to take any action in regard to the endorsement of passes held by Persian subjects for travel in M^sLtTehran Bahrein. The endorsements in question were, however, thenceforth granted Jan. 221913, ' by the Political Agent, a practice, as pointed out by the Political Resident nine years lateral ^ of itself open tp objection, as it might be construed ^ 894S '' into a tacit admission that the Persian passport authorities are justified in giving passes for another Persian port to persons going to Bahrein.' 25. Efforts made by His Majesty's Government in 1913 to secure Persian recognition of our right to protect Bahreinis and subjects of the Trucial Chiefs as a condition precedent to the granting to Persia of the loan then under negotiation proved unavailing.** ** Teh. Desp. to f . o., 110 May 13 1913, P. 2531/13. (b) 1922-1927. 26. There were no fresh developments of importance until after the war. In the year 1922 His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Bandar Abbas reported that the Persian passport officials at Lingah,* at which port British India * po1 -res. to g .of j1090 Steam Navigation Company's vessels put in from Bahrein, had ruled that June 10 1922 ' p - 2787 / 22 - Bahreinis were Persian subjects and should be given Persian passports, p 2 o fi7/22 They seized two British certificates of identity granted to Bahrein subjects, ' * but on representations being made by the Minister at Tehran, instructions Para. 62 of Pol. Res. were given by the Central Government that there was to be no repetition of Des P- to 294 s., this incident. In the same year, His Majesty's Minister suggested that Sept ' 1 i927 ' Persians going to Bahrein should be required to obtain British visas or passes, and should be turned back if they had not got them, a procedure the adoption of which was recommended by the Political Agent, who regarded it as feasible. It was subjected accordingly to examination by the Government of India and the Foreign Office, with the results shown below. In 1922 also the Persian delegate at a Postal Conference held at Bushire, while not for the moment pressing for the transfer to Persia of the t Tel. from Pol. Res. to g Bahrein post office, stated that his action was without prejudice to Persian ^K 11 ' 13 1922 •, claims to Bahrein.! p.' 90/^ 140±i/471/34 ' 27. At about the same time a Press campaign for the return of Bahrein to Persia and for its direct representation in the Majlis was started in the Persian papers. This discussion culminated in a motion in the Majlis to give Bahrein the right to return a Member, a demand for the immediate discussion of which was rejected, but which was referred to a Commission for report.J His Majesty s Government, in the light of this development, t Teh. tel. 112, April ir decided that it was desirable to instruct the Minister at Tehran to address a 1923 - • 0r ^A^ 0te i t0 t ^ e -^ ers ^ an Government, in terms similar to those emploved in 1906, and considered the question of asking the Admiralty to despatch a vessel to show the Flag m the neighbourhood of Bahrein. The Government •or India concurred in the action proposed, and expressed the view that if a Note was presented, the withdrawal of passport measures should be included remarkmg (doubtless with the proposals on the subject of the Minister at iehran in mind) that, whether a Note was presented or not, they saw no ■objection to retaliatory measures requiring visitors to Bahrein to take out a Britishvi8a.§ l hey added, however that the critical internal situation in § Tel. from Viceroy, Ma y 29 .sia made it doubtful whether the present moment was opportune for 1923 ' p - 2039 / 23 - •action.

The serious internal situation in Persia made it necessary to postpone- action on the lines approved by His Majesty's Government, and temporarily to drop the proposal, in which the India Office had concurred,^ to take retaliatory action in the matter of passports should the Persian Government not withdraw the instructions they had issued on that question to their officials in the Gulf. ** Teh.

No further steps were taken until September 1923, when the Persian Government were informed that the Island was now a British Protectorate, and that His Majesty's Government did not contemplate any alteration of its status—a declaration met by a statement by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Government of which he was a member had no intention of laying claim to Bahrein on. behalf of Persia. This did not prevent the Minister for Foreign Affairs from again raising the question in the following month in a conversation in the course of which Sir Percy Loraine tentatively suggested, in his personal capacity, the possibility of putting the matter to arbitration, a suggestion for making which he was sharply rebuked by the Foreign Office, and from which nothing resulted. 30. Between 1923 and 1927 there was a lull, and no point of real) importance arose. His Majesty's Government were reluctant to face the question of the status of Bahrein, and in consequence adopted in general an accommodating attitude so far as possible on minor questions. Thus, on the vexed question of the use by Bahreinis of Persian passports and travelling passes (Ilm-o-Khabar), agreement was reached in 1925' :iHi ; that Bahrein subjects should not be subjected to the new Persian passport, regulations, the production of an Ilm-o-Khabar sufficing, and His Majesty's Government, despite the apparent concession of principle involved in the- recognition of the Ilm-o-Khabar, decided in 1927 tacitly to acquiesce in this — partly on the ground that the recognition of these documents could be ignored, since they were also being issued by Persia in the case of Koweit, the status of which was not in dispute ;* to let the question of independent Bahreini passports lie; and to allow the matter generally to rest unless it was revived by Persian action.There were no developments until June- 1928, when the refusal of the Persian Consul at Basra to visa the pass of a Bahreini—an incident now under examination—again raised the question.!! In September 1928, the Political Resident, on learning that a Persian at Bahrein was endorsing Persian Ilm-o-Khabar for Persians for the return journey to Persia, instructed the Political Agent to tell the Sheikh to issue orders that no one bearing such documents would be allowed to land, and to inform the offender who was issuing endorsements that he was usurping the powers of a Government official, which could be performed only with the consent of the Sheikh, and that he would be requested to leave the island unless he desisted. The vigorous reassertion of the Persian claim to Bahrein dealt with below renders it desirable to keep a vigilant watch for any action which might be construed or represented by Persia, as an admission of their claim to suzerainty over Bahrein, and while it- is not clear how persons carrying Ilm-o-Khabar are to be identified on landing. Sir Lionel Haworth's action is not inopportune at a time when there are indications of an inclination on the part of Persia to assert a shadowy claim to suzerainty over the States of the Arab littoral by requiring that their nationals shall take out Persian passports or travelling passes. 32. It may be mentioned at this point that the Belgian Administrator- General of the Persian Customs stated early in 1928 that a about four years ago he had been taken to task by the Government of the day for imposing customs duties on goods imported from Bahrein to Persia ; and that he had replied that ' customs dues had always been so levied . . . and that before they could be abandoned . . . the' Persian Government would have to- institute a customs control at Bahrein itself.'J residingReassertion of Persian Claim and Appeal to League, 1927. 33. The deposition of Sheikh Isa by His Majesty's Government in 1923, and the subsequent increase in the degree of active British influence, emphasised the position publicly taken in Bahrein by His Majesty's Government, but the Persian claim was not again actively reasserted until the text of the Treaty of Jeddah, concluded with Ibn Saud on 20th May 1927, in which Bahrein was referred to as having ' special Treaty relations' with His Majesty's Government, provoked a strong protest by Persia, copies of which were despatched to the League of Nations with a request for circulation. tt The Persian protest was'based tt Teh. Desp. to f.o. 577, largely on an alleged recognition of Persian sovereignty over Bahrein in a Nov ' 25 1927 ' Note dated 29th April 1869, from the Earl of Clarendon, then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. x\ reasoned reply to the Persian Note, which (after a brief delay in the hope that an arrangement might be reached with Persia) was equally communicated to, and circulated by, the League, was despatched by His Majesty's Government on 18th January 1928. Suffice it to say that His Majesty's Government, while avoiding any delinite statement as to their own position in Bahrein or its basis, again repudiated the Persian claim in the strongest terms. 34. The Government of India, who but for the Persian protest would have inclined to favour a proposal of the Political Resident, under consideration at the time of its receipt, that His Majesty's Government should set the seal on their position in Bahrein by a formal treaty of protection, provided that tnis was not precluded by wider considerations of foreign policy, recognised the tactical objections to such action in face of Persia's appeal to the League.§ They commended, in the circumstances, a proposal § viceroy's tel., Dec. 29 by feir L. Haworth that the Sheikhs should be apprised of Persia's claim and ^ p. 5967. encouraged to give a power of attorney to His Majesty s Government to defend their independence at Geneva, and if possible state their dependence on our protection This latter proposal was approved by His Majesty's Government|| || Tel. from s .of s .for 1. to on the understanding that no pressure of any kind should be brought to viceroy, 181, Jan. 20 1928. Sheikh to secure the documents. His Majesty's Oovernment added that, in their view, the desirability of stressing the dependence on 0U1 iS r u teCtl0n ' tiie was doubtful, and suggested that the point could better be disposed of by reference to the special treaty relations of the bheikhs ivith His Majesty's Government. 35. The Political Resident reported on 19tli March 19281]' that he had ir Ticerov's tel. esi s, obtained a letter from Sheikhs Isa and Hamad appointing His Majesty's p - (jovernment, in accordance with their treaties, 'to defend Bahrein from outside interference,' and to act as their agents in rebutting the Persian d Tj tilat tlle Sileiklls proposed to send Sheikh Mohammed, brother oi bneikh Wamad and son of Isa, as their representative in answering the claim should the case be taken to Geneva. The Resident added that no pressure had been brought to bear to obtain this document, but that now that matters had gone so far with the Sheikhs any compromise with Persia on the basis of the status quo would have a very undesirable and unsettling etiect on them and that a definite disposal of the matter, by Persian withdrawal of the case or its reference 10 the League, was necessary. 36. There seemed at an earlier stage some reason to believe that the Persian Note to His Majesty's Government was designed rather to prevent ^ o • m ?P Sing suh sllentio than in the hope of any positive result, and that the 1 ersian Government regretted the reference to the League ** The ♦•op .Teh. tei 250 Dec 28 question has come up several times in the course of the recent negotiations 1927, para. 3, p. 263/28! with Persia, when Sir R.

The Persian answer is, broadlv speakine* 6 P-4184/28. based on the claims that Persian suzerainty over Bahrein was recognised by His Majesty s Government in 1869—a contention disposed of in the -Note sent to Persia in January 1928-and that a sine qua non of 2979 d ^10 * Cp. 1928 t Cp. Teh. Desp. 207, May 4 1928 the independence of Bahrein is the recognition of such independence by the former Sovereign State—Persia, an act which has never taken place. No reply to the Note has yet been sent by His Majesty s Government. 37. Till this latest development, despite much activity in the Persian .V. Teh. Desp. 79, Feb. 8 Press.and the encouragements of the Soviet Ambassador in r I ehran,| there % r!!' so? seemed little real probability that the matter would be pursued at Geneva. If, however, the latest communication should make this inevitable, not only can the paper arguments be strengthened by the addition of miscellaneous evidence which has come to light since the British Note of January 1928 was drafted, but the presence of a representative of the Sheikhs will carry some weight. The difficulty in present circumstances of the establishment by Persia of effective control in Bahrein, even should her suzerainty per improhahile be admitted in the island, makes it perhaps more probable that she will endeavour merely to use the question as a pawn in the forthcoming negotiations. In that event consideration will have to. be given to tlie remarks of the Political Resident quoted above as to the necessity for a definite decision and the undesirability of a compromise on the basis of the status quo, remarks recently reinforced by unofficial statements by the Financial Adviser in Bahrein (Mr. Belgrave) as to the apprehensions of the Sheikhs lest His Majesty's Government should sacrifice their interests to Persia as the price of an accommodation on matters of purely British concern. From the point of view of His Majesty's Government, a settlement which would enable us to avoid public examination and discussion of our position in the Islands is to be desired. III.—Ibn Saud and Bahrein. (a) 1913-1923. 38. Ibn Sand's contact with Bahrein commenced with his capture of Hasa from the Turks in 1913. Under the Treaty concluded with His Majesty's Government on 26th December 1915, Ibn Saud undertook, ' as his Fathers did before him, to refrain from all aggression on or interference with the territories of . . . Bahrein . . During the war he established a commercial forwarding agency in Bahrein (the Qusaibi) and began to take some interest at Bahrein ; in 1919 the Political Agent found it necessary to bring pressure to bear on Sheikh Isa to secure an equitable settlement of a dispute which had arisen owing to the imposition by the Sheikh of customs duties on goods passing through Bahrein in transit to Hasa and Nejd ; at the end of July 1920 the Political Adviser, Bahrein, reported that Sheikh Salim of Koweit had recently been in touch with Sheikh Isa, it was suggested with a view to securing his adherence to the movement against Ibn Saud which he was then fomenting—though nothing appears to have come of this; while in 1922 Ibn Saud encouraged the recalcitrant Dowasir Bahrein tribe by offering them sanctuary in Hasa, an offer accepted on the abandonment of Bahrein by the tribe after the deposition of Sheikh Isa in 1923.J At the moment of the deposition of the Sheikh (April 1923) Ibn Sand's agent had achieved an objectionable prominence in the Nejdi-Persian rioting which took place at Bahrein ; and His Majesty's Government finally approved a proposal by the Political Resident that he should be removed from Bahrein by being sent to Ibn Saud with a letter complaining of his conduct, requesting the Sultan to deal with the case, and asking that His Highness, before sending another Agent to Bahrein, should arrange to secure the concurrence of His Majesty's Government in his choice. A formal protest by Ibn Saud against this action was disposed of by the Political Resident, who refused to compromise, and the Qusaibi was finally allowed to return to Bahrein on a clearer understanding as to his position and functions.

There were no developments of importance between 1923 and 1927. When the Treaty of Jeddah was in negotiation with Ibn Saud in 1927, Hi s Majesty's Government and the Government of India were anxious to secure from the King of the Hejaz and Nejd an undertaking similar to that embodied in the Treaty of 1915 and quoted in para. 38 above. His Majesty would, not, however, go beyond an undertaking u to maintain friendly and peacefulwtmmmmmmKtBamammmmtmammmam 11 relations with the territories of . . . Bahrein . . There is no evidence at ' the moment of a more positive interest in Bahrein on the part of Ibn Sand ; but there is little question that he and the Wahabi movement, and not Persia, is the real danger; that as matters stand he is our natural successor if we H abandon our present position in Bahrein, that his power is appreciated and ik feared by the Sheikhs, an(i that an active development of Wahabism on the i North Arabian coast, coupled with bad relations with the King of the Hejaz ll :and Nejd, might react embarrassingly on our position in Bahrein. The , remarks of Sheikh Hamad in April 1927, that 'Ibn Saud was the one big Arab Ruler, and it was natural for all the smaller Sheikhs such as himself * Letter from p. a ., Bahrein, ;to look up to him and try to please him,'* are symptomatic. i927°P.^334^27 53 Apnl 14 E.—Summary. 40. Internally, the last 20 years have seen the consolidation of British influence in Bahrein. The Sheikh has agreed to grant neither oil nor pearling concessions without the sanction of His Majesty's Government; jurisdiction over foreigners in the islands has passed from the Ruler to the Political Agent; internal misrule has been checked by the deposition of Sheikh Isa, the substitution of Sheikh Hamad, and the provision for the new Sheikh of competent and disinterested European advisers under his orders. 41. Externally, the claim to suzerainty of Turkey has lapsed. The claims of Persia have constantly been reasserted, and as constantly repudiated by His Majesty's Government, over the period now in question. 'They are at the moment under argument, and have acquired a new importance by their reference to the League of Nations. Present indications are that Persia is likely to press them, and the desirability, in the interests of the Sheikhs, who have appointed His Majesty's Government their agents in the matter, and on whom a compromise with Persia on the basis of the status quo would, according to the Political Resident, have a very unsettling- effect of securing a decision which will finally dispose of them inter nationally, is for the consideration of His Majesty's Government. The rise of Ibn Saud is, however, the development most pregnant with possibility in the external relations of Bahrein. The King of the Hejaz and Nejd has not so far actively interested himself in the islands ; and the fact that the power which he has built up may not survive his death cannot be ignored. But, on the assumption of the survival of the existing state of things in Nejd, the present Memorandum (para. 39) makes the suggestion that it is Ibn Saud and the Wahabi movement, rather than Persia, that represent the real danger from a practical standpoint, and that were His Majesty's Government for any reason to abandon their present position in Bahrein, Ibn Saud would, as matters stand, be their natural successor. Position in Bahrein of His Majesty's Government. 42. While, however, His Majesty's Government, as stated above, have over the past 20 years established ade facto control of the Islands of Bahrein, de jure their position is no stronger than before. At the same time, the importance of establishing that position on a stable basis has very greatly increased since 1908. From the naval standpoint, Bahrein, although it has been suggested, as a pis oiler, as a naval base or a coaling depot, has the disadvantage of unhealthy climate and relative remoteness from the exit of the Gulf and so from the probable scene of naval operations in the event of war.''' The Air Ministryt regard it, however, as of great potential * Admiralty to c.o., .. i ^ • • I • • 'IT 1Q 1000 10 importance Irom the standpoint of British air interests—not only because of T ^ 1Vi to Ul its geographical position on the route to India, but because the isolation iw7/p ™I28. of the islands from the mainland, and the long-established influence in them of His Majesty's Government render them less likely to be disturbed by anti-British rumours than other places on the Arabian coast. The Government of India (substantial Indian commercial interests in Bahrein apart) take the view that Bahrein as a central air base and political centre for the control of the increasingly important Arab littoral may be regarded as a key position inside the Gulf of an importance at least equal to that of Muscat at its mouth. The probability that Persia will press her efforts to terminate British influence on the south Persian coast, the necessity, should Jan. 19 1928, P. 845. t A,M. to C.O., Dec. 28those efforts succeed, of cod soli dating that influence on the Arab littoral, and' the possibility that the removal of the headquarters of the Political Resident from Bushire may have to be coasidered, all combine to invest Bahrein with an importance very substantially greater than in 1908 from the standpoint of His Majesty's Government. 43. On the assumption, then, that Imperial considerations, our obligations to the Sheikh apart, make it desirable for His Majesty's Government to j maintain and consolidate their position in Bahrein, the question arises of how this is to be achieved. The matter is one which calls for careful handling. On the one hand, Persia has appealed to the League, on the Council of which she is now represented, and there is a possibility that she may endeavour to make a compromise on Bahrein a condition precedent to agreement with His Majesty's Government on other Gulf questions. On the other hand, it appears that a compromise, even on the basis of the maintenance of the status quo, would have a definitely unsettling effect on the Sheikhs, who are suspicions that His Majesty's Government may use them, as pawns to secure concessions from Persia of value to Great Britain only; that a decision which will definitely dispose internationally of the Persian claim is therefore desirable : and that, while the deposed Sheikh Isa remains- sensitive regarding the maintenance of internal independence, the de facto ruler, his heir, and his brother, are anxious, in the face of Persian claims, to- admit to the full the protection of Great Britain. It may perhaps be assumed that if the Persian claim could be disposed of before His Majesty's Government had finally consolidated their position, much stronger 1 opposition to such consolidation might be expected from the ruling family, and this appears to make it desirable to seize the present opportunity to- establish the British position once for all. 44. The simplest method of at once asserting internationally the British view of the status of Bahrein and establishing the position in the islands of His Majesty's Government vis-d-vis the Sheikh, would probably on the whole be the conclusion of a formal treaty of protection, a course under consideration in India (see para. 34 above) at the time of the reassertion of the Persian claim last year. Had Persia been prepared to abandon her claim, in deference to His Majesty's Government, the Treaty with Bahrein could have been concluded simultaneously with its abandonment. But as she is. ! undoubtedly not prepared to compromise, such a treaty could only be concluded in the face of Persian protests to the League and elsewhere,, and the wider considerations of international policy involved in its conclusion would call for close examination before a decision is taken | regarding it. ) An alternative method of solution might be arbitration, to which various objections are obvious. - F *Tm Points referred t0 1x1 connection with Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. 4o.

India Office, . t g l 8th October 1928.CONFIDENTIAL. INDIA OFFICE Kim/k. Status of the Islands of Tamb, Little Tamb, Abu Musa, and Sirri. I. —Introductory. 1. Tamb, Abu Musa, and Sirri are three small islands lying well out in the Persian Gulf between the Trucial Arab coast and the Persian island of Kishm. Little Tamb, an uninhabited and waterless island, 1 mile long by I mile wide, 8 miles to the west of Tamb, was agreed by the Government of India, the India Office and the Foreign Office in 1908, to depend from that island. -- Tamb itself is an island 1/ miles south of the south-west point * i-O. to f. o ., Dee. of Kishm Island and 46 miles north-west of the nearest point on the coast of 3369/o P 8 to Irucial Oman, roughly circular in shape, and about 2^ miles in diameter. Messrs. striok, A lighthouse was erected on it by His Majesty's Government in 1913 (see p^/oT' paras. 25 to 28 below). It is sparsely inhabited and almost waterless. It Lor ii ioos appears probable that deposits of red oxide are to be found both in it and in ' ' ' Little Tamb. Abu Musa is a larger and more thickly populated island, a Lor ii 1275 tew miles nearer to Shargah in Trucial Oman than to Lingah in Persia, with good supplies of water, and valuable deposits of red oxide which have been under exploitation for some years, and royalty in respect of which is paid to the ruling family of Shargah. Sirri, 40 miles south by west of Bustaneh, the nearest point on the Persian coast, is more prosperous and fertile lor. ii, ibso. than Tamb, and, like it, contains deposits of red oxide, though these are t Pol. Kes. to a of apparently unimportant.t L ' Jan - 23 1 909, P. 360/09. ^ The history and status of these islands is identical. While, however, the Trucial Sheikh of Shargah on the Arab coast still controls Tamb and Abu Musa, on which he flies his flag. His Majesty's Government, and the bheikh ^ under protest, have since 1887 tacitly acquiesced in Persian occupation of Sirri. The Persian flag was stated to have been hoisted on au ™ lamb I n at ^ tirne of tlle -^ei'sian aggression on Tamb and +Poi. Re S tor of Abu iviusa. It was presumably removed at ihe same time as it was removed Apni 151904. Irom those islands; but the Political Resident reported in November 1908 that the Shargah flag had not been flown on Little Tamb by the Sheikh.§ § Tel. from viceroy It is not known whether steps have since been taken to do this to ^ s - for L * Nov- 24 3. Ihe islands are claimed by the Trucial Sheikhs of Shargah as R 2111/08 - representative of the Jowasimi Arab chiefs, one section of whom in the 18th century established themselves by force or alliance at Lingah and elsewhere in South Persia. The Persian claim to the islands has in' the past been based on the fact that the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs of Lingah, under whose administrative control they were for many years prior to 1887, had for long been Persian subjects governing Lingah as Persian officials, and it was suggested that it was in this capacity that they had administered the islands, which had become Persian territory. The latest Persian claim is based on thef act that the islands, together with Farur, are shown as Persian in a War (Jmce map of 1887 of which copies were presented to the Shah Te h. tel. 254 to F.a r by the Minister at Teheran, under the orders of Lord Salisbury, in July 1888 p^o^s 28 ' (cp. paras. 34 and 36 below). ^09/28. 4. r I he recent reassertion of the Persian claim to the island of Tamb renders necessary a more detailed examination of the history of that island and of the is ands of Abu Musa andSirri, the status of which is identical; than would otherwise have been required. Persian ownership of Farur does not appear to have been disputed in the past; the island is in any event in a different category from Abu Musa, Tamb and Sirri, and no reference is made to it in the present Memorandum.

Ehaima on the Trucial Coast (hereafter referred to as the Jowasum, had been active on the Persian littoral of the bull, on which before l/2r they seized Basidn. In 1737 they were attacked m their own territory by ers.a and appear to have made submission* but rt does not seem that 1 ema retained any hold on Ras-al-Khaima. 6. Abont 1750 a portion of the Jowasimi tribe crossed the Gull to aid the Persian Governor of Bander. Abbas and Ormuz against the then Shah, when they took possession of Lingah, opposite the island of Kishm. and other places on the Persian Coast. Lingah they continued to hold until the deposition by Persia of the last Arab Sheikh of Lingah in 1887 But for a number of years before that dale, while Lingah up to about 1882 remained a tnbally administered Arab principality, the ruling Sheikhs had gradually ) come under the power of the Persian Government, having finally acknowledged themselves Persian subjects, paying to the Persian Governor-General of lars such tribute as he could exact from them, and governing Lingah as Persian officials. 7 It is not clear whether anv effective dominion had been exercised by Persia in the islands of Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirri prior to 1750. It seems entirely clear that no effective dominion was exercised m any oi them by her between that date and the seizure of Sirri in 1887. In the intervening period if not from a much earlier date, the islands were apparently part of the hereditary estates of the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs, the Sheikhs on the Arab shore having an equal interest with those on the Persian littoral. Their management, administration, and jurisdiction had, however, for many years prior to 1887 by common consent been vested in the chief Jowasimi Sheikh of the Persian coast, viz. the Sheikh of'Lingah, but in his capacity of Jowasimi Sheikh and not of Persian officialj—a state of things which would appear to have arisen from the fact that Tamb was for a period used by Lingah Jowasimi more than by other Jowasimi.No recognition of I ersian suzereignty in respect of any of the islands had been made by the Jowasimi Arabs of Oman. 8. Up to about 1873, owing to the close connection existing between Tamb and Lingah, the Residency authorities at Bush ire took the view that Tamb was Persian, and in the period ending with 1879 several enquiries regarding it are stated to exist in the Residency records. In 1882, however, in^reply to an enquiry, the Residency Agent stationed at Shargah, on the Trucial Coast, furnished the Resident with translations of letters to the Sheikh of Shargah which established the rights of the Trucial Chiefs. Copies of these letters were produced in another connection in 1900 by the Residency Agent, who stated that he had himself seen the originals. Endeavours are now being made to see if the originals can be produced.|| 9. The Persian claim was first asserted in 1887, and has been repeated in 1904, 1923, 1926 and 1928. The history of these incidents is as follows. X G. of I. Pro ceedings, Sept. 1888. ^ Tel. to Res., Sept. 26 1887. III.— Occupation of Sirri by Persia, 18874 10. In the year 1887 an armed Persian party, with two small cannon, was sent to erect a flagstaff and hoist the Persian flag on Sirri. Ihe Political Resident, the Minister at Teheran, having enquired! whether the islands were under British protection, and whether any action at leheran was necessary, replied that Sirri and Tamb were beyond the zone of Persian interference, and that the islands belonged to Arab Chiefs under British protection in common with Arabs of the Persian littoral. The Resident separately reported to the Government of India that the islands formed part of the hereditary estates of the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs; that for many years, how T ever, their management, administration and jurisdiction had by common consent been vested in the chief Jowasimi Sheikh on the Persian coast, viz., the Sheikh of Lingah for the time being ; that the Jowasimi Sheikbs domiciled on the Persian coast had acquired the status of subjects oi Persia, and those who governed Lingah had been, in fact, Persian oflicials qua Lingah ; that the Persian claim was doubtless based on these grounds, and that, were it not for the fact that the Arab Sheikhs of the Oman coast jointly owned the islands, the Persian position could not be disputed. H 16© Eesident supported his statement with the translation of a letter written in 1877 by the Sheikh Ali-bin-Khalifah of Lingahto the Chief of Ras-al-Khaima, in which the former ' admits that Tamb is a dependency of the Kowasim of Oman, and that the Persians have no property there nor any right to interfere, save with the consent of the Chief of Ras-al-Khaima.' In conclusion, he expressed the opinion that the Persian Government had no goodtitletotheislandsinquestion.|| || Pol. Ees. to g . of 11. The Sheikh of Shargah protested to the Resident on 16th October L ' Sept - 2 ' 188 '- 1887 against the Persian action at Sirri, and asked that similar action at Tamb might be prevented. The Government of India felt, however, some difficulty as to the action to be taken, in view of the fact that Persian Jowasimis had joint rights on Sirri and Tamb, and that one Arab Sheikh only had appealed, and it was agreed, in consultation with the Resident, that, no overt action having been taken by Persia in the case of Tamb, * Tel. from Pol. Res. representations at Teheran should be confined to the question of Sirri.' :i: ' ' of ^ yov * 15 12. On representations being made, the Persian Government statedj t Tel. from c. d'A., that for nine years Sirri and Tamb had paid taxes to the Persian Government, Teher ij n . ^ Pol. and that, documents in support of the Persian claim being at Bushire, the ^ ec ' 10 1887 ' Governor had been instructed to explain matters to the Resident. The Governor, however, informed the Resident that 'he had no documents relating to the Persian claim, and that he had wired to the Amin-es-Sultan excusing himself from discussing the question with the Resident.''^ Enquiry + Tel from p ol Res was independently made of the Chief of Shargah as to the Amin-es-Sultan's to c. d'A. m Teheran! S statement. The Chief's reply explained the connection of the Governors I)ec ' 12 1887, of Lingah with the island of Sirri, and added that Tamb was uninhabited, and that no taxes had been paid to Persia. He further euclosed three letters from Chiefs of Lingah, admitting the Chief of Shargah's ownership * Pd Ees toc d'A of Tamb.§ Teheran!Feb.'l 2 ' 13. The Persian Government had meanwhile produced five official letters 1888 ' from a former Sheikh of Lingah (Yusuf-bin-Mahomad) in support of the i| c. d'A, Teheran, Persian claim to the two islands.I| The Resident,^ after examination, t0 ^ Ja'. 2 issk replied ' that he considered that the documents did not bear out the Persian d ' A -&gt; claim, and that weight should not be attached to the statements of the Sheikh in question, who was a dependant and servant of the Jowasimi Sheikh, Ali- bin-Khalifah [cp. para. 10 above], whom he murdered in order himself to become Chief of Lingah,and, the Persian Minister appearing to rely on a statement of Sheikh Yusuf that he had 'gone to the island of Sirri to inspect and recover Government (Persian) dues,' the Resident wrote that he considered that ' this statement could not be accepted as establishing or even supporting the Persian claim to possession, nor as sufficient to deprive the Jowasimi Arab family of their ancient and previously recognised rights on that island.' (It may be added that on 29th March 1881 Sheikh Yusuf wrote to the Chief of Ras-al-Khaima fully admitting the possession of Tamb by the Jowasimis.)§§ The Resident further pointed out that the Jowasimi §§ Pol. Res.'s Memo. Sheikhs of Lingah had usually also been Deputy-Governors of Liugah on S Ma7 / 1895 ' behalf of Persia; they exercised authority on Sirri island, but it was qua ' 985 04 ' Jowasimi Sheikh and not qua Persian Governor. 14. A reply on the lines of the Resident's report was sent to the Amin es-Sultan by Her Majesty's Minister on 2nd March 1888. The Persian Government, on enquiry being made** as to the grounds on which they ** Nnt , M „ had annexed Sirri, repliedff that it was in their possession, being a 18 88. dependency of Lingah, to which the Legation replied that jurisdiction tt Note of Mar. 10 over Sirri had been^ exercised by the Governors of Lingah solely in their 1888 capacity of Jowasimi Sheikhs, that the traditional rights over Sirri of the Jowasimi Sheikhs had never been disputed and were generally recognised, that the hoisting of the Persian flag altered the existing status, and that it was on this ground that Her Majesty's Government desired that reasons should be shown for this alteration. The note, after adding that while ' possession, if of long standing, and undisputed, undoubtedly carried considerable weight ... the argument would scarcely govern in the piesent instance, concluded by asking the Persian Government to com municate ' the proofs they possess of the former dependence of Sirri island on Persian authority.'4 15. On the 28th April 1888 the Resident communicated to the Minister at Teheran a copy of the translation of a report drawn up locally for the Amin-es-Sultan, which he had obtained privately, relative to the Persian, claims It appears that ' there was nothing fresh in this report beyond a new claim put forward to the island of Abu Musa,' which, again to quote the Resident, ' has no justification whatever.' In the summer of the same year ( 9 6th July) the Minister telegraphed to Bnshire that a reply had now been received from the Persian Government that ''as the Jowasimi Sheikhs were Persian Governors of Lingah, they considered no further proof of the justice of their claim necessary.' To this the Resident replied that the Persian reply begged the question, and that the Arab contention as regards Sirri was that the Jowasimi Sheikhs of Lingah represented the family, and derived no right from their position towards the Persian Government. 16. In order to facilitate the disposal of other negotiations, His Majesty's Government decided m August ISSS tacitly to acquiesce m the 1 eisian occupation of Sirri. Save, however, by such acquiescence, to which reference was made in official correspondence with Persia in 1904 (see para. 21 below), they have never in any way admitted or withdrawn their original objections to the claim of the Shah's Government to the ownership of the island, while the Political Resident stated in 1904 that it was equally clear from the Residency records that the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast had never voluntarily dropped their claim, which they had formally reiterated in 1895, to proprietary rights over Sirri, any more than over Abu Musa and Tamb. IV.—Temporary Persian Occupation of Abu Musa and Tamb, 1904. 17. In January 1903 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that, trade having to a large extent been diverted from Lingah as the result of the short-sighted policy of the Belgian Customs officials, Lingah merchants were endeavouring to arrange with the Bombay and Persian Navigation Company to make the island of Abu Musa a port of call. He added that, in view of the Sirri incident of 1887, he was apprehensive lest the result might be the advancing of a territorial claim to this island by Persia. The Resident stated that the island undoubtedly belonged to the Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah, that the Jowasimis did not, however, fly a flag on the island, and that it might be well to advise the Sheikh of Shargah to do so as a sign of ownership. This course was approved and action taken accordingly. 18. The question having arisen of advising the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaima (a sheikhdom at that time and now dependent from the Sheikh of Shargah) to adopt a similar course in regard to the island of Tamb, which belonged to the Ras-al-Khaima section of the Jowasimis, the Resident reported that, so far as he was aware, sovereignty over that island had never been asserted by Persia, that the Sheikh of Shargah in his existing capacity as Ruler of Ras-al-Khaima claimed it as on appanage of the Jowasimis of the Arab coast, and that he was in possession of documentary evidence in the shape of letters from two former Arab Chiefs of Lingah admitting the claim of the Jowasimis of the Arab coast to those islands, as against the claim of the Jowasimis of Lingah. It, was decided that the Chief should be advised to hoist his flag on Tamb as on Abu Musa, and this was done. 19. In April 1904 the Viceroy telegraphed that the Belgian Customs officials had placed guards on Abu Musa and Tamb, forcibly removed the Arab flags, erected new flagstaffs and hoisted the Persian flag on both islands. This action led to immediate protest by the Sheikh of Shargah, who appealed to His Majesty's Government, under his treaty relations with them, to take the necessary steps to prevent such interference in his territory. 20. The Government of India, who took a serious view of the incident, * p. 737/04. proposed' 1 * to despatch a gunboat to the islands, with a representative of the Sheikh of Shargah on board, to haul down the Persian flag, reinstate the t f.o . to i.o., Jowasimi flag and remove the guards to Persian territory. It was decided,! toPO^MayV i T 904 ^ owevei &gt; . to g ive tlle P^sian Government the opportunity to withdraw from p 0 2559/04 ' the position they had taken up, and on the 24th May the Minister reportedthat they had telegraphed orders to Bushire to remove the flags and guards trom Abu Musa and Tamb, vvhfle reserving their right to discuss wilh His Majesty s Government the respective claims to the island.

The matter does not appear to have been taken further by Persia.

It may be remarked at this stage that in the lengthy negotiations which took place with the German Government between 1907 and 1914 over the claim of Messrs. Wonckhaus in respect of the cancellation of their red oxide concession in Abu Musa by the Sheikh of Shargah, no reference was made to the Persian Government, who were, indeed, privately reminded by the Charge d'Affaires in 1908 of the incident of 1904, and warned against any * Teh tel. e to P.O. attempt to renew the Persian claim.* His Majesty's Government con- Jan. 61908. sistently referred, in their commuuications to the German Government, to the ' sovereignty ' exercised in Abu Musa by the Sheikh, and a quantity of local evidence was produced to show that the ownership of Abu Musa vested t Cp. e.g^Menm to^ ^ t ^ e ru ]i n g Sheikh of the Jowasimi of Oman residing at Shargah. t lt&gt; Sir r K a Gre/sletter would clearly have been impossible for His Majesty's Government to have to count Metternioh, taken the very definite line actually taken by them ms-d-vis Germany had p e 4859/ii.' the status of the island been, in their view, a matter at all open to dispute. VIIL—Reassertion of Persian Claim to Tamb and Abu Musa, 1923. ,30. In 1923 the Minister at Teheran reported that he had learned confidentially that the Persian concessionnaire of the Hormuz red oxide concession, Moin-ut-Tujjar, a person of great wealth and considerable political influence, was urging the Persian Government to raise the Persian claim to + Teh. tel. 123 to Abu Musa, couple it with that to Bahrein, and refer both to the League of p 0 !^^ 27 1923 ' Nations J Sir P.

In the autumn of 1925 the Persian customs authorities sent a launch to Abu Musa which inspected the red oxide and removed one bag. On a protest being made, they replied that Abu Musa belonged to Persia Energetic action was taken at Teheran by His Majesty's Minister, who reminded the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of the 1923 correspondence, and subsequently warned him privately that persistence in the Persian claim would make it necessary 'to request the Government of India to despatch a ship of war to Abu Musa to uphold the rights of the Sheikh of bhargah. Ihe Persian Government withdrew, and the customs 'Teh Desp 25s authorities were instructed 'not to take any steps in Abu Musa or Tamb to J™.,May31 pending reply from Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding status of these 1926 ' P ' islands. X.—Reassertion of Persian Claim to Tamb, 1928. 33. In July 1928 a Persian customs launch, which had been operating ±rom iamb for about two months, seized off the south of the island a Debai dhow carrying passengers to Ehassab, on the Arab coast, with a small cargo of sugar and dates, and brought it to Lingah, where the cargo was confiscated as smuggled and the passengers imprisoned. The incident created a very serious situation on the Trucial Coast, the Trucial Chiefs being restrained only with difficulty from immediate reprisals; and its possible reactions proved a matter of grave concern to the Government of India. 31. Strong diplomatic representations by His Majesty's Government at i eneran secured the release of the dhow and its passengers and crew. The cargo remains under seizure, and a claim for compensation has been met by •a reiteration of the Persian claim to ownership of Tamb, based, according to the Acting Minister for_ Foreign Affairs, on a British Note dated 27th July f Qr'if I Hl c J !

The Charge d Affaires has indicated that the argument is unsubstantial, while the fact cannot clearly m itself affect the validity of the Arab claim • but it is clear that in the forthcoming negotiations with Persia, not only the immediate lamb incident, on which the Government of India have expressed themselves very strongly, but the position of Abu Musa, to which also a claim lias now been preferred by Persia, (and of Sirri) will come nn for T&lt;*-tei-269.Aug.23 disposal. ^ 1928, P. 4601. XI.—Summary. 35. The effective occupation of Sirri by Persia since 1887, and the tacit dSfTn^ tUt ocon^tion of His Majesty's Government, make it difficult, if not impossible, at this stage to dispute the Persian claim, though thair nil rt Prv Govenim&lt; ;f not estopped by any formal admission on purposes U81n8Sllargal1 claim islail d for bargaining , 36 - Tlle Position is different as regards Tamb and Abu Musa. At no stage has the Persian claim been formally admitted, and at no stage has it been allowed to pass unquestioned. The argument in support of the latest Persian claim as set out in para. 34 above could be strengthened so far as it has any value, by reference to the fact that the islands ?re also shown in on the Survey of Indk MapX°^ tS^rof in question ■and after the dates mentioned, of the Persian claim.8 37. As regards the merits of that claim, the historical summary above- shows that the history of the islands prior to 1/50 is obscure; that sine that date such authority and such effective occupation as there has ben has had its source in the Jowasimi Arabs, who between 1750 and 1820 exercised in the Gulf a maritime control uncontested by Persia. There is nothing to show that those Arabs, having obtained a footing on the Persian coast, thence derived authority over outlying islands. Probability suggests, rather that thev carried with them to their new settlement a position in the islands which they already possessed. The fact that a section of these Arab- intruders later acquired the status of Persian subjects, and held their authority on the Persian coast in subordination to the Persian Government Poi. Res. to Minister, as local Chiefs or Governors, cannot affect any original rights the Jowasimi Teheran, Dec. is tribes on the Arab and the Jowasimi tribes on the Persian littoral may have 1898 - had in common; an intimate connection appears to have been maintained between the two sections of the tribe, and the islands remained their common property and did not become Persian territory ; nor, the islands being held by a Sheikh only on behalf of the tribes, had an individual power to alienate + Viceroy to s. of s. any sovereign territorial rights which he might enjoy qua ruler of these- fori., Feb. 161908, tribes.! Finally, de facto possession resting with the Jowasimi Arabs of the' p - 864/08 Trucial Coast, it would appear to be for Persia, in the absence of evidence at any stage of effective Persian occupation or of acknowledgment by the Trucial Arabs of Persian overlordship in the islands, to prove the case for alteration of the status quo. 38. As between His Majesty's Government and the Trucial Chiefs- concerned, the latter, under their treaty engagements, are entitled to the protection of His Majesty's Government and are not themselves allowed to communicate or negotiate direct with any foreign Power. Apart from the- fact that their claim to the islands has consistently been upheld by His Majesty's Government, it was on the initiative of His Majesty's Government that the Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah and Ras-al-Khaima hoisted his flag on Tamb and Abu Musa in 1903 (see paras. 17 and 18 above). 39. The satisfactory disposal of the matter is important in view of its- immediate reactions on the Trucial Coast, and the wider reactions on Mohammedan feeling in India of disturbance in that region. But its importance from its possible reactions on the relations of the Trucial Chiefs- with Ibn Saud is hardly less great. J. G. L.

Desp. 353 to The recent reassertion by the Persian Government of their claim to the islands of Tamb anu Aim Mnsa, coupled with their refusal to recognise as independent the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaima on the Trncial Coast, or the claim of His Majesty's Government under their treaty engagements to protect the Trncial Sheikhs, 0 and Mr. Parr's report** as to the extreme sensitiveness of Persia at the present time about her authority in the islands, suggest the desirability of a clear understanding in connection with the f.o., july 27 1928. deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee as to the status of the more important islands in the Gulf other than Tamb, Little Tamb, Abu Mnsa and Sirri, which are dealt with in the Memorandum on page |||- The present Note, accordingly, deals with the following groups of islands:— (a) Warba, Bubiyan, Maskan, Failakah, Auhah, Kubbar, Qaru, Umm-el- Maradin, which lie off the coast of Koweit and the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab. (h) Kishm, Henjam, Ormuz, Laruk, Sheikh Shuaib, Haiderabi, Kais, Farur (and Little or Nabiyu Farur), which lie off the south Persian coast, and the position of which came under discussion before and during the war. (c) The Bahrein Archipelago. (d) Halul, Dalrnah, Sir Beni Yas, Sir Abu Nair, Qran, Jinnah, Kharag, Khargu, A.—Bubiyan, Failakah, Auhah, Kubbar, Qaru, Umm-el-Maradin. These islands were before the war in Turkish possession. They were attributed to the administrative control of the Sheikh of Koweit in the (unratified) Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913, and were occupied by the Sheikh on the outbreak of war with Turkey in November 1914. They were formally recognised by His Majesty's Government as forming part of His Excellency's dominions in April 1923 (see Koweit Memorandum, para. 35, on page jfl). No Persian claim to these islands can reasonably be preferred. B. —Sheikh Shuaib, Kishm, Henjam, Ormuz, Laruk, Hinderabi, Kais, Farur, Nabiyu or Little Farur. The status of Henjam is examined in greater detail in paras. 5 and 6 of the Memorandum on Henjam on p. With the exception of Nabiyu or Little Farur, these islands appear to be indisputably Persian; and in 1914 His Majesty's Government made a formal offer to the Persian Government to lease or purchase all except Hinderabi, Kais, and Farur.t In 1918, when t Teh. Desp. to f.o., the renewal of this offer was under consideration, the addition of the three p.^oes/H 14 ' last-named islands to the lists to be communicated to Persia was approved.J + f.o. tel. 137 to Teheran. Mar. 8 rsabiyu larur. 1918, p. 1024/18. The status of Nabiyu or Little Farur is not formally determined. The island, which is uninhabited, and lies about 10 miles south-west of the southern extremity of Farur Island, is circular in shape and about half a mile in diameter. The Persian Government were stated in 190G§ ' as yet' to have paid no attention to it; the Government of India and the India Office in 1908 expressed the view|| that, on the analogy of Little Tamb, it should be regarded as depending from Farur, ' which admittedly belonged to Persia,' and the Foreign Office did not dissent from this view. I he question was again raised in 1924 in connection with a proposal to erect a light on the island. The Political Eesident then suggested that the precedent of Little Tamb was not necessarily binding on His Majesty's Government, adding; ' We have precise facts that Nabiyu Farur is a barren rock, useless, and not claimed by anyone, and that in 1875 the Farur Sudanis 3063 75 10.28 § Lor. ii, 584. H Viceroy to S. of S. for I., Nov. 11 1908 ; l .o. to f.o., Dec. 2 1908, P. 2111.2 were recognised as belonging to the Jowa'sim Tribe of Trucial Oman.' No reference to the incident of 1875 could be traced by the India Office ; but i .o. to f.o., Mar. 26 the Secretary of State for India agreed with the Government of India that it 19-4, p. 839/24. would be undesirable to start the erection of a lighthouse on the island without prior intimation to Persia, and the matter was not pursued. It would appear therefore that there is little question that the island must be regarded as Persian, though a slight element of doubt as to a Jowasimi claim exists. C.—The Bahrein Archipelago. The archipelago consists of the islands of Bahrein, Muharraq, Umm Na'assan, Sitrah, and Nabi Salih, and a number of lesser islets and rocks forming part of the same compact geographical group. The archipelago is under the rule of the Sheikh of Bahrein, and the status of Bahrein governs the status of all the other islands composing it. D.—Farsi, Arabi, Harqus; Halul, Dalmah, Shura-awah, Sir Beni Yas, Sir Abu Nair, Qran, Jinnah, Kharag, Khargu. The status of these islands is important, not merely because of the claims which may be urged to them by the Trucial Chiefs, to whom His Majesty's Government are under treaty obligations, but because their control is in many cases of importance in connection with the policing of the pearl banks, for which responsibility has been assumed by His Majesty's Government, and because of the possible value of certain of them in connection with an air route along the north Arabian coast. Farsi, Arabi and Harqus. Farsi is an uninhabited island about a quarter mile across, in the middle of the Gulf, about halfway between Musallamiyah Bay in Hasa and the Tangistan district in south Persia. Arabi is 15 miles south of Farsi; and Harqus, ' a mere sandbank,' 30 miles west of it. Oil seepages were alleged in 1914 (Engler's ' Petroleum ') to exist in the sea near all three islands, and Arabi carries a deposit of guano. Lor. ii. 115,553,642. The ownership of all three islands was stated in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer to be undetermined, Mr. Lorimer adding in the cases of Arabi and Harqus that the question had never arisen. The India Office in 1914 mf'p Mis 00 ' 0 e;r P ressecl the view * which the Foreign Office did not contest, that His Majesty's Government should eventually claim the right to deal with all three islands (as with Halul); and beacons were at the same tiine erected to LtoTcero;' S ' on with th ? concurrence of Admiralty and Foreign Office.!

An island 1 mile in diameter, some 61 miles E.N.E. of Dohak in the Trucial Principality of El Katr, surrounded by pearl banks, and having in its neighbourhood, under the sea, an intermittent spring of bitumen.j In 1906 there were rumours, which proved unfounded, of German designs to acquire the island from the Porle for use as a coaling station, for which purpose the Government of India stated that it was unsuitable. Lorimer s Political Gazetteer (1906) described the status of the island as mdetei mmate, the pearl divers and fishermen both of El Katr and of Trucial Oman are in the habit of resorting to it; and, so far as can he learnt, no exclusive or preferential rights are claimed bv any of the classes who use it, or by any territorial Chief.'§ In 1908 the India Office, after consultation with the Viceroy suggested to the Foreign Office that it was preferable to take no action which might lead to discussion of the status of the island, as any assertion of rights beyond the present customary usage in ' i„;, 'V - 8 • 011 \ . a f/ ri ' Crucial Coast and £1 Katr, might lead rjlZZfT mg ra i sed , b T y Katr Sheikhs to which the Turkish II 1.0. to F.O., Dec. 2 Government [suzerain of Katr till 1916, since when the Sheikh has been 1908, v. 2111. recognised as an independent Irucial Chief] might lend their support.'!! t Lor. ii, 61' § Lor. ii, 61S.In 1913 Sir Percy Cox, then Political Resident, reported the discovery oi correspondence of 1869 from which it appeared that, one of the Shatt-al- Arab buoys haviog gone adrift and been thrown up on Halul Island, reference was made apparently as a matter of course to the Trucial Sheikh Abu Dhabi as overlord of the island,^' and in 1914 His Majesty's ^ Pol.

(Cp. para. 10 Mar - 41914 ' p - 8,34 • of Memorandum on Lighting and Buoying on p. JJJ.) As in the case of Farsi, Arabi and Harqus, the India Office in 1914 recommended that His Majesty's Government should eventually claim the right to deal with Halul, J but no steps were in fact taken for the regularisation j i .o. to f . o., of its status. This accordingly remains indeterminate, the available evidence ^ 39 2 4 0 1914 '' appearing to point to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi as the owner, or failing him ' 3946 ' one of the other Arab rulers of the Trucial Coast, including the Sheikh of El Katr. There is no history of a Persian claim. The bitumen spring makes the question one of some potential importance. Dalmah.

His Highness Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal bin Turki, K.C.I.E. (1926), C.S.I. (1917), Sultan of Muscat and Oman, born in 1885, succeeded his father. Sultan Saiyid Faisal-bin-Turki, G.O.LE., who had ruled the Sultanate since 1888, in 1913. He has three sons, of whom the eldest, Saiyid Said, is being educated at an Arab school in Baghdad. His Highness, who is entitled to a salute of 21 guns, represented his father at the Delhi Durbar, 1902-3, and visited England in the summer of 1928, when he was received in audience by the King, and entertained as a State guest for a period of a month. 2. The Sultan is an independent potentate who has commercial treaties with the Governments of France (1844) and the United States (1833), as well as with His Majesty's Government. There is in addition a commercial declaration of 1877 with the Dutch Government. Under the Anglo-French declaration of 1862, His Majesty's Government and the French Government engage reciprocally to respect the independence of Ihe Sultan of Muscat (as of the Saltan of Zanzibar). Under his treaty relations with His Majesty's Government, a precis of which is contained in the memorandum printed as an Appendix on page ||, the Saltan is pledged never to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, his dominions, save to His Majesty's Government, to whom, in addition, the right to search and seize Muscat ships suspected of carrying slaves was ceded in 1873, as was the right (simultaneously ceded to Persia) to search Muscat vessels tor arms in Muscat waters in 1898. The right to search Muscat vessels for arms on the high seas was ceded to Mis Majesty s Government and the Italian Government in 1903. His Highness has further undertaken not to grant oil concessions without the approval of His Majesty's Government. While, however, the Sultan is in theory a wholly independent ruler, since the end of the eighteenth century British influence has been predominant in Muscat, and in practice the relations which obtain between its ruler and His Majesty's Government and the Government of India very closely approximate to those which obtain between the Government of India and an Indian State under the suzerainty of His Majesty. 3. The internal administration of Muscat is carried out by an Advisory Council of Ministers (President, Minister of Finance, Minister of Religious Affairs, Minister of Justice),-- purely Arab with the exception noted below, *p 9 3 7/24 presided over by His Highness's brother, Saiyid Nadir. t The Council, t Letter 163 s. from which the Sultan was required to institute in 1920 as a condition of the PoL Rey - to of l -&gt; assistance of His Majesty's Government in the reconstruction of his adminis- tration and in negotiations with the rebel Omani tribes (see para. 35), is entitled to a salute of 17 guns, individual members receiving five and the P - H - 321 /22. President nine, or 13 if a member of the ruling House. In theory it exercises all ordinary powers of administration, not only during the absence, but during the presence of the Sultan at Muscat, subject to the retention by His Highness of power to decide all matters of extraordinary importance affecting the interests of his State or his dynasty.J It does not, however, X &amp;. of i. Desp. to appear in the past to have exercised in practice a very effective control. At ^r oi s - for L ' the request of the Sultan, an Englishman, Mr. B. S. Thomas, O.B.E., P.Toeg/li. 21, formerly assistant British rBpresentative in Trans-Jordan,§ was appointed in § Letter 4i8 s. from 1925 as Financial Adviser. In 1926 Mr. Thomas was appointed Wazir and Po1 - Res - to G. of 1.. a member of the Muscat Council, functioning as Finance Minister, but July 20 1924 - having also a full share in the government of the State. The result has been a marked improvement in the general level of efficiency of administration. 4. His Majesty's Government and the Government of India are represented in Muscat by the Political Agent, who is an officer of the Indian Political Department, on the cadre of which the appointment is borne. The 3064 75 10.28 a2 post, which is at present held by Major G. P. Murphy, Indian Army, has * Lor. i, 472. been maintained without interruption since its revival ' after the separation of Muscat from Zanzibar in 186 .1. In 1869 it was placed in strict t Lor. i, 488-9. subordination to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf-j Since 1867 the Political Agent has also held His Majesty's Commission as Consul for Muscat. Under the Muscat Order in Council of 1915 (see paras. 63-4 &gt; below), which replaced the Muscat Order in Council of 1867, the Political Agent is the District Magistrate and Sessions Judge, and exercises his powers subject to the jurisdiction of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The limits of the Order are co-extensive with the territories and territorial waters of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. 5. Ko specific reference was made to Muscat in the Report of the Masterton-Smith Committee, and while, under the general principle embodied in that Committee, matters of political significance on the north Arabian littoral which may affect relations with Ibn Saud fall to be dealt with by or in consultation with the Colonial Office, such matters rarely, if at all, arise in Muscat, and political control may in consequence be regarded as resting, as in the pre-war period, with the Government of India, subject to the general control of His Majesty's Government. Under the principles embodied in the Masterton-Smith Report, the internal affairs of the State are in any event the direct concern of the Government of India. 6. With the inconsiderable exception referred to below, expenditure in Muscat is wholly borne by Indian revenues. That expenditure consists of subsidies to the Sultan, of Durbar presents, and of the cost of maintaining the Political Agency. The subsidies consist of an annual sum of Rs. 86,400, representing the $40,000 payable by Zanzibar to Muscat under the Canning award of 1861 (liability for this payment was assumed by His Majesty's Government in 1871, and has since 1st September 1883 been wholly an + Lor. i, 499; soo, Indian charge),J and of the annual subsidy of Rs. 1 lakh paid since 1912 (see paras. 12 and 22 below) in compensation for the losses to the Sultan arising out of the suppression of the arms traffic, which will cease with the tenure of power by the present Sultan. These charges are fixed, and their amount does not vary. In the latest year for which authoritative figures are available (1919-20), the cost of the Politic3al Agency was Rs. 78,427, and in § sir d. Bray to the same year Durbar presents amounted to Rs. 5,000.§ The solitary item me^EA^ Jaiy J 2i expenditure shared with His Majesty's Government is a yearly payment 1921' p' :5588/21. in respect of anti-slavery measures, the amount of which in 1926 was Rs. 73. II.—1908 to 4th October 1913 : Sultan Faisal. 6. The dominating feature of the period between 1908 and 1913 is the successful suppression, in agreement with the Sultan of Muscat, of the arras traffic from his State, and no other question of sufficiently general interest to call for reference in this Memorandum arose in the closing years of the reign of Sultan Faisal. The rebellion of the Omani tribes, which broke out some months before his death on 4th October 1913, belongs principally to the reign of his successor. It is dealt with in a separate section in paras. 43 to 52 below. The Suppression of the Arms Traffic from Muscat. 7. At the beginning of the period a general prohibition of the arms traffic was in force on the Persian Gulf littoral save in Muscat. The Sultan of Muscat had prohibited in 1891 the import or export of arms and ammunition to or from Gwadur, his dependency on the Persian littoral of the Gulf. In 1898 His Highness had agreed to prohibit the export of arms from Muscat to India and Persia (where the import of arms was illegal), and had empowered Persia and Great 13ritain to act on his behalf by sea in enforcing this prohibition within Muscat territorial waters. In 1903 he had further agreed to the search by British and Italian ships of Muscat vessels on the high seas suspected of carrying arms. But the import of arms into Muscat, and their export, except to India and Persia, were still unprohibited in 1908.3 8. The result was to make Muscat the recognised centre of the trade in arms for the whole Mid die East. At the beginning of the period now in ^ ^g mo - B - 175 ' question, the main channel of distribution was from Muscat across the Gulf to the coast of Persian Makran, whence arms were taken up country by ^ caravans, ultimately reaching the tribesmen of Afghanistan and the North- West Frontier of India. From 1910-11, the stringency of the prohibitive measures imposed by His Majesty's Government led to the adoption, in preference, of smuggling to El Katr. on the Arabian coast, then still under Turkish control, and thence across the Gulf to the Persian coast of Laristan, 9. The constant flow of modern arms of precision from Muscat to the North-West Frontier of India created a very serious situation for the Government of India and His Majesty's Government. The situation was one which could be dealt with adequately only by the suppression of the free trade in arms at Muscat. The fact that the Sultan had commercial treaties not only with His Majesty's Government, but with the United States of America and France, which expressly provided for the unrestricted import and export of all kinds of merchandise (with certain specified exceptions); that he had further a commercial declaration which provided for reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment between Muscat and Holland ; that a large part of the trade in arms was in the hands of certain French firms with considerable political influence in the Chamber ; and that the French Government, unlike the Governments of the United States of America and Holland, was not prepared to sacrifice its treaty rights provided other Treaty Powers did the same, made it extremely difficult to take effective steps to this end. 10. The efforts made by His Majesty's Government to provide a quid 'pro quo acceptable to the French Government having failed, steps vvere taken, in the light of a reiteration at the Brussels Arms Conference of 190S-9 of the refusal of France to modify her attitude, to suppress the traffic so far as was practicable without the violation of existing treaty rights* Towards the end of 1909 a naval blockade was instituted, which was still in being on the outbreak of the War in 1914, but which, though it met with very considerable success, proved extremely costly. Between 1910 and 1912 further lengthy negotiations took place in consequence with the French Government and with the Sultan. The Sultan, who saw in the suppression of the traffic not merely a possible occasion of immediate compensation from His Majesty's Government, but the closing of the most convenient source from which the rebellious tribes in the interior of Oman could arm themselves against him, was generally amenable, though in 1911-12 his financial difficulties, which delivered him into the hands of the arms dealers, ii: ' led him # pv- tel. from for a time to change from an attitude of neutrality towards the trade, to active, forL^n. i^mi if surreptitious, participation in it. The French Government, however, p. 171, p. 200. remained unyielding, and in view of the complete failure of the negotiations with them, it was decided to disregard France, and to endeavour to concert with the Sultan of Muscat some local arrangements for a satisfactory control of the trade.t ' 11. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the various incidents which took place in connection with the suppression of the traffic between 1910 and 1912, or to enter into details of the discussions which took place during that period with the Sultan and with France. Suffice it to say that, after lengthy negotiation, an arrangement was finally reached with His Highness in May 1912. Under this the Sultan agreed to establish at Muscat a bonded warehouse under sufficient control, in which all arms and ammunition would be deposited on importation, the warehouse to be in charge of a trustworthy person from among his subjects. All issues from the warehouse would be regulated by special licences prepared by the Superintendent and counter signed by the Sultan personally, and such licences would be issued only to individual purchasers or their authorised agents subject to satisfactory proof that the issue involved was free from justifiable objection.' Licences would not be issuable to traders. 12. The terms on which the Sultan agreed to this settlement were as follows. He was to receive as compensation an immediate lump sum4 payment of 1 lakh of rupees, together with 1 lakh of rupees per annum inlthe future, paid monthly in advance. In addition he was to receive compensation for certain specific losses in 1.309 and 19^ • ^ultan was further guaranteed that His Majesty's Government would gije nim all the necessarv support to dispose of objections that might ensue nom France or other Powers ; that no right was given by the arrangement to His Majesty's | Government or their officials to take action in his temtoiies an\ more than in the past; and that a friendly understanding should be reached with him by His Majesty's Government as to suitable arrangements for the supply of the bond fide needs of his administration and his subjects. 13. The arrangement, which was to come into force, after three months' notice, on the 1st September 1912, was published on the 4th June 1912, came into operation on the appointed date, and was subsequently maintained with complete success. 14. Very serious difficulty immediately arose with the French Government, which expressed its readiness to approve the regulations only subject to the compensation of the French merchants, who had hitherto played a consider able part in the arms trade. Compensation to French interests would have meant compensation to the other interests—Muscat* British, German, Belgian—affected, and the objections to it from the standpoint of His Majesty's Government were overwhelming. The fact that Fngland, while a joint guarantor with France of Muscat independence under the Agreement with France of 1862, was not a party to the French Treaty of 1844 with Muscat, under which the arms trade was permissible, further complicated the issue. 15. His Majesty's Government, however, made it clear to the French Government on the 14th September 1912, that they were firmly determined to support the Sultan in maintaining the regulations, which, they stated, in their view^ did not infringe French treaty rights, but merely regulated a dangerous trade, a right enjoyed by every Government. They added that, while compensation without arbitration could not be admitted, as His Majesty's Government did not recognise that French rights were infringed, they were prepared to submit the question to arbitration. ] 6. After lengthy and difficult negotiations, which lasted until the early part of 1914, the French Government agreed* to recognise the regulations in force at Muscat, and the right of the Sultan to amend those regulations with the concurrence of His Majesty's Government, if His Majesty's Government, in direct negotiation with the French trade interests affected, could arrive at an agreement as to the terms on which those interests should be bought out. An agreement having been reached,| under which £64,495 was paid by His Majesty's Government to the interested firms, an exchange of notes took place on 4th February 1914, by the settlement embodied in which the French Government undertook { 'no longer to claim for their nationals the privileges and immunities secured under the Treaty between France and Muscat of 1844, in so far as those privileges and immunities conflict with the regulations for the prevention of the illicit trade in arms and ammunition in the Sultanate. In other respects the Treaty of 1844 remains in force.' The expenditure involved w^as divided equally between Indian and Imperial revenues.^ It was decided that no compensation should be paid to British firms affected. 17. While a continual vigilance is called for, the steps taken to put Re ort of Arms a stop to t]le arms traffic ^ rom Muscat, as described above, have been Traffic committee, completely successful. In 1921,§ and again in 1925,|] the Political Resident 1921, p. 4036/21. was able to report that, save for the Batineh coast, on which a truculent s P £or'L , e 264 ?May 1 Omani tribe (the Yal Saad) are not under the Sultan's effective control 1925. p.'1345/28. (c/. para. 52), Muscat had entirely fallen out of the arms traffic ; and the fact that under the post-war Arms Traffic Convention, to which the Sultan has adhered at the request of His Majesty's Government,^ Arabia had been made P. 8997. ' ' d prohibited area for the import or export of arms, has for practical purposes disposed of the probability of the recurrence in present circumstances of international difficulties.

Sultan Faisal died on 4tli October 1913.* His son, Saiyid Taimur, * p - ^ne/is. liad in practice, if not formally, for some years previously been recognised as heir apparent,! and while His Majesty's Government had in the past in t Tel. from viceroy- Muscat postponed recognition of a successor until they were satisfied that a to s. of s. for i., j particular claimant was assured of the general support of the more important elements and could be regarded as the de facto ruler, the demise of the late Sultan at a time when the interior was in a state of revolt, the urgent necessity of establishing a fresh administrative centre, and the fact that Saiyid Taimur was familiar with the policy of his predecessor, and could probably be relied upon to follow that policy in the vital matter of the ■arms traffic, decided them in favour of his immediate recognition.^ This jf . o . toi.o., the Political Agent was authorised to convey to the Saiyid in November 1913. 0ct ' 311913 '' The French Government, who had suggested that the two Governments F ' 4!51S ' reconnaissent en meme temps the new ruler,§ were informed that while § m . Cambonto His Majesty's Government, as they had already indicated, adhered to the Sir E * Grey ' Noy - 13 Declaration of 1862, it was their usual practice to recognise the de facto 1913 ' p - 4739/13 - ruler, and that they had accordingly already authorised the Government of India to take this step in the case of Sultan Taimur, especially as they understood that the French Consul at Muscat only awaited the receipt of instructions by his British colleague himself to accord official recognition on f.o . to lo .. Nov. 20 •behalf of France. 1913, p. 4739. 19. But the recognition had not been unconditional. The new Sultan had been required as a prior condition to state that he accepted all the obligations which his father bore towards His Majesty's Government, and that in regard to the arms traffic as well as other matters he intended to pursue his father's policy, and undertook ' to be guided by our advice in all important matters, jj And, immediate recognition having been granted II Tel. from viceroy, by His Majesty's Government on compliance by the Saiyid with these 1913 ' preliminary demands, further requirements were presented to him as a condition of the continuance of the subsidies granted to his predecessor. 20. Of these subsidies the Zanzibar subsidy was one the precise conditions antecedent to the grant of which are a matter of some dispute.^ ^ Cf Lor j p 500 It would, however, appear that those conditions are that a Sultan should be footnote.'' ' .acknowledged by His Majesty's Government and should promise friendship and the maintenance of his treaty obligations, and that subject to this he might prefer an absolute claim. The arms traffic subsidy of Rs. 1 lakh per annum had, however, been personal to Sultan Feisal, and, while it was essential that the new ruler should afford the co-operation.in the suppression of the trade to secure which it had been granted, he could prefer no claim to it as •of right. 21. After lengthy discussion between the Government of India, the India ■Office and the Foreign Office, it was finally decided that the Sultan should be required as a condition of the regrant of the subsidies to agree to postpone for live years, or such shorter period as His Majesty's Government might desire, the revision of the Commercial Treaty of 1891^ iiJ ; a decision being deferred pending further examination on two connected questions—the assent of His Dec'31 m^'tei t Highness to the establishment of a Muscat L-evy Corps, and his agreement 'Viceroy, Jan. 17 to conclude no further treaties with foreign Powers without the consent of 130/if' 5152y ' 13 ' His Majesty's Government. The second of these questions was one which had arisen towards the close of the reign of Sultan Faisalft, the disposal of tt 1.0. to f.o., which presented political difficulties owing to the position of France vis-d-vis ™lo the State, and which was still under examination when the outbreak of the p -5152. Furopean War in August 1914 made its immediate pursuit unnecessary. f.o . to 1 .0., It has not been revived. For various reasons the proposal to raise a Muscat S 60 ' 311914 ' ' Levy Corps (to which the Foreign Office saw no political objection in 1914SS so long as the force was nominally a Muscat force and commanded by officers Jan - 2 3 ioh , ' nominally in the service of the Sultan) produced no result until 1921 (see P - S(ll / U - para. 31). 22. 1 he arms traffic subsidy was renewed without a very clear definition of the terms of its renewal, though the intention both of His Majesty's6 Government and tlie Government of Indifi had been lliat, as iu the case of * Pol. Agent to Pol. s u l tan Feisal, it should be personal to the ruler.* The complete success of p 6 4180/^2] 2 ^ 1921 ' the restrictions imposed on the arms traffic, the extension to Arabia of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919, and the financial stringency of the post war period, led at a later stage to re-examination of the position m regard to^ this subsidy, and as a result the Sultan was warned in 1922 that, while iti would be continued to him during his tenure of power, it would not be admissible to his successor. In this decision His Highness reluctantly acquiesced. 23. The dominating position in Muscat throughout the why was the rebellion of the Omani tribes, which Sultan Taimur inherited as a legacy from his predecessor, which he found himself unable to quell on his accession, and the history of which is separately dealt with in paras. 43 to 52 of this MemorandumT The pre-occupation of the State with this problem absorbed its energies during the War period, while its relative remoteness from the politics of Central Arabia resulted in its isolation from the disputes of Ibn Saud and Ibn Rashid, and from the development of events alike at the head of the Gulf and on the coast of the Red Sea. 24. It is unnecessary to enter in any detail into the internal affairs of Muscat (as distinct from the Omani rebellion) in the early years of the war. The control of the arms traffic, itself no inconsiderable element in that rebellion, was on the whole satisfactorily maintained. But the Sultan retained his throne thanks only to the active military assistance and support of His Majesty's Government, a support not extended to the administration ] of his State until 1918 ; his administration, never distinguished, became hopelessly corrupt; while His Highness's financial position, as the result of the inefficiency of his servants, the demands of the campaign against the Omanis, and the loss of revenue involved in the Omani rebellion, gradually t p. 370/18. deteriorated until in 1918 it could be described as desperate.! 25. The Government of India and His Majesty's Government, committed; by their undertakings of 1895 and 1913 to secure the safety of the coast towns of Muscat and Muttrah (cp. para. 45), in the early part of the war confined their action to implementing these undertakings with some generosity of interpretation, and abstained from interference in the internal policy of the State. But the inefficiency of the internal administration, the action taken at the behests of His Majesty's Government by the Sultan and his predecessor, and the Omani rebellion were closely interwoven; the strategic position of Muscat, athwart the main route to the headwaters of the Gulf and to Mesopotamia, was of vital interest ; the nominal independence | of the Sultan rendered his situation of more than local importance, and in 1917 the then Political Agent, Major Haworth, submitted for consideration a programme the acceptance of which w r ould involve active interference in the internal affairs of Muscat by the Government of India and His Majesty's i Government. 26. The proposals of the Political Agent were that a levy corps should be established under British officers ; that a loan should be granted the Sultan sufficient to rid him of his liabilities; and that as a condition of the loan His Highness should agree to the transfer to British control of the Muscat customs, to the appointment of a British adviser and to the | establishment of an educational system the ultimate result of which would be- the provision of a nucleus of Muscat subjects educationally qualified for employment in the local administration, which had hitherto been wholly | dependent on alien talent. 27. Major Haworth's proposals necessitated careful consideration in the light of the Declaration of 1862, under which His Majesty's Government had become a joint guarantor with France of the independence of Muscat. A i further difficulty was the uncertainty as to the authority with which respon sibility for Muscat affairs would rest after the war, and the reluctance of the Government of India to initiate a policy the development of which was unlikely to rest with them. But circumstances forced the pace : negotiations' with the Omani rebels in the spring of 1918 were unproductive, the financialsituation became, if possible, more critical; the reactions of maladministration at home, alike on the financial situation and on relations with the tribes of the interior, became increasingly apparent; and in August 1918 the Government of India, after further discussion with Sir Percy Cox and Major Haworth, expressed to the Secretary of State for India the view tbat action could not Tel. from viceroy Qbe postponed indefinitely, and submitted proposals to meet the situation. Aug. 16 I '' 28. The Government of India suggested the offer to the Sultan of a loan R 3661/18 ' of Rs. 5J- lakhs at 6 per cent, interest to be paid off in 10 years and to be secured on the Muscat customs ; the loan to be conditional on agreement by His Highness to undertake a definite programme of reform which would result in financial reorganisation and the improvement of the administration * F&gt; o. to i.o., of justice. The Foreign Office did not consider* that the proposed loan Nov - 5 i 918 ) could afford any ground for legitimate protest to the French Government, to whom no reference was accordingly made by His Majesty's Government, and Dec. '4 igis^Sis. it was finally sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India on 4th December j Treasury to f.o., 1918.1 It was borne wholly by Indian revenues, the Treasury refusing to g^ri^viceroy contribute.J Feb. 141919, p. 371/19. 29. The programme of reform accepted by the Sultan as a condition of .the loan covered the following points :— (1) Appointment by His Highness of an Indian, to be selected by His Majesty's Government, as Customs Director, who would in the first instance reorganise existing customs posts, and subsequently extend a customs system to all ports in Oman. (2) Fixation of amount of Privy Parse, remainder of State income being appropriated to charges of administration and payment of instalments and interest of loan. (3) Appointment of a Wazir or Dewan to conduct Courts of Justice and control proceedings of local governors of districts. (4) Improvement of roads, establishment of schools, &amp;c. (5) Reorganisation of Sultan's guard with a view to its eventual use as nucleus for a levy corps. 30. Considerable discussion took place regarding these conditions in the •early part of 1919, Sir Arnold Wilson, then Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, feeling serious doubt as to whether they did not at once constitute too heavy a commitment on the part of His Majesty's Government, and traverse the principles of self-determination embodied in the post-war policy of the Allies. They were, however, ultimately substantially accepted by the authorities ^concerned, and were put into operation during 1919. It may be recorded for convenience at this point that the Commercial Treaty of 1891, which had been renewed for five years in 1914, was extended for one year in 1919, and has been extended yearly since that date. p. 901/14. 31. An additional loan of Rs. 1 lakh, borne, like the original loan, by Indian revenues, was sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India in February 1920, raising the total of the advance to Rs. 6|- lakhs, repayment of which was to be made in 19 equal half-yearly instalments of Rs. 46,740. 5.$ § Tel. to viceroy, 0 Feb. 9 1920, 32. The very considerable degree of indirect control represented by the p ' 863/20 - measures described in para. 29 was justitied from the point of view of Tel. 1635 s. from Muscat by their results. By the beginning of 1920 the Sultan's debts had been Sri^Dec.^ igfg, discharged with the assistance of the additional loan ; steps had been taken to ^ 80 33/i9; g . of 'i. introduce financial order; the result of the appointment on 1st October 1919 forT, Mar. si 0 ! 921, •of three trained Egyptian customs officials to reorganise the customs, which p - ^/si. provided the major part of the revenue of the State, was seen in a balance in the Treasury on 1st October 1920 of Rs. 3^ lakhs, 1| and a regular Court H Pol. Agent to Pol. of Law, though with less immediately satisfactory results, had also been m ' io established. In addition, a European Wazir (Capt. McCollum, formerly 1921, p. 2023/21.' Political Agent, Koweit) was employed from January to August 1920, when the reorganisation of the administration referred to in paras. 35-6 below rendered it possible to dispense with his services. Early in 1921, a Muscat levy corps under a British officer, which has since been maintained at a strength varying between 200 and 250, and which is now recruited from the p. 5218/21,2230/26- -Makran coast, made possible the withdrawal of the Indian troops maintained8 by His Majesty's Government for the defence of tbe Sultan in Muscat and Muttrah. 33. Simultaneously with the reorganisation of the internal administration^ the steps referred to in para. 49 below were being taken to bring about a settlement with the Omani tribes. With the attainment of a settlement iixfij September 1920, the State found itself solvent and in sight of a condition of political stability such as it had not previously enjoyed. 34. While, however, the active intervention of His Majesty's Government had secured the results described above in the affairs of the State, the Snltan, an agreeable but effete and indolent ruler, who had at no stage displayed the qualities of character necessary in the ruler of Oman, saw in the new dispensation an opportunity to divest himself of his nominal responsibilities, and in March 1920, in a private interview with the Viceroy, expressed his. desire to abdicate and to reside permanently in India. 35. Other considerations apart, the facts that the tribal situation was still critical, that there was no obvious successor, and that the succession I was a matter of more than local interest in view of the Sultan's international treaties, rendered the proposal inopportune. Lord Chelmsford declined to countenance it, and His Highness was required to return to Muscat on the- p. i969/2i. conclusion of his visit. But tbe Sultan was in name at least independent; his reluctant co-operation might do more harm than good, and a compromise, which by reducing His Highness ? s interference with the administration might simplify the task of reorganisation, was not altogether without advantage. As a result, the Omani tribes having in the autumn of 1920 asked that negotiations might be reopened, the Political Agent, after personal consulta tion with the Government of India, was authorised to inform the Sultan that His Majesty's Government were willing to assist him in the continued reconstruction of his finances and in his negotiations with the rebels on the following conditions:— (a) That if he persisted in his wish to live away from his State as- much as possible, he should spend not less than five months every year continuously at Muscat. (h) That he should authorise the constitution of a regular Advisory Council, purely Arab in composition, to exercise all the ordinary powers of administration, not only during his absence, but during' the periods of his presence at Muscat. (c) That he should retain the power to decide ail matters of extraordinary importance affecting the interests of his State or his dynasty. (d) That should he at any time change his mind and decide to live permanently at Muscat, these arrangements should be-cancelled, and he should resume all powers of administration, subject to the conditions of the loan made to him by His Majesty's Government (see para. 28 above). ?)C). After lengthy discussions these conditions were accepted by His Highness subject to the reduction of the period of his obligatory annual residence at Muscat and to the fixation of his privy purse at Rs. 10 ,000 pe^ mensem. The Government of India agreed to modify their requirements; the period of residence was fixed at four months and subsequently reduced to three ; and approval was given to a privy purse of Rs. 10,000 per mensem subject to His Highness's continued good behaviour and to the continued ability of the State finances to bear the strain. An arrangement on these lines has since been in operation. Pol. Agent to Pol. 3/. 1 he financial position gave ground for increasing uneasiness in 19-^ p. e 3895 e /^3; Poi. ' ail( l 1924. Iracle depression had reacted on the customs revenue; ^ Res. to Cx. of i., Egyptian customs officials had not proved an unqualified success— one had p .I g ?^ 1 ^ July 20 been dismissed while another had resigned ; efforts at retrenchment, and the 1924, p. 4288/24. imposition of certain minor taxes, produced no substantial result. A large increase in revenue could be secured onlv by an increase in the customs duty from 5 per cent, to 10 per cent., and 'the existence of treaties between Muscat and France and the U.S.A., fixing that duty at 5 per cent., action on these lines difficult.9 (? 38. The Government of India endeavoured to meet the situation, to the seriousness of which the Sultan was fully alive, by lending for four months a highly qualified European customs official, Mr. Bower, to reorganise the Muscat customs. At the same time, they agreed, at the request of the Sultan, to find a competent Englishman to serve as Financial Adviser, look after the finances of the State, and aid His Highness and the Council with advice. The Arab Advisory Council established in 1920 (see para. 35) had proved of no real assistance—the Sultan in 1924 had complained that they were, ' though very worthy persons . . . absolutely useless as administrators, apart from which they would never come to a decision about any matter, even unimportant questions ' ; and the Political Resident agreed * tel. 22 t. from that 'the difficulty was to get them to give a decided opinion on any Mar.^im 0 ' of ^ Subject.''* P. 2028/24. 39. The post of Financial Adviser was offered to Mr. B. S. Thomas, O.B.E., formerly Assistant British representative in Trans-Jordania, who assumed duty in April 1925, and in 1926 was appointed Wazir and a member of the Muscat Advisory Council, functioning primarily as Finance Minister, but exercising also a full share in the general government of the ■ State.t Mr. Thomas, who is the servant of the State and not of His t Letter igs s. from Majesty's Government, was engaged on a contract for five years, with Aprif 24192?' of L ' six months' leave after three years, plus one month's leave a year, and pay of P- 2077/26. lis. 1,500—100—2,000. The terms of his service were approved bv the v G-overnment of India. ^ 4289 / 24 - 40. The result of the steps referred to above has been a very marked improvement. By April 1925 the financial situation could be reported f £ 0m ' more satisfactory than it has been for some years 'J; by June the State April ' ofL ' was reported solvent, and despite§ fluctuations in trade which have been R 1516 / 2 5. reflected in decrease of revenue, the improvement has been maintained. I^Res kfa'ofT An extensive Public Works programme has been initiated, a patrol steamer Aug. s 1925, ' has been secured, |i repayment of the State indebtedness has progressed p - 3055 / 25 - satisfactorily ; in 1927 the Government of India felt justified in agreeing to igettTo^oT Res the extension by 2|- years of the period of repayment of the outstanding Dec. s 1925, balance of the loan granted in 1919 (paras. 28 and 31) above, to enable the P ' 321 / 26 - State to open a primary school and make other minor improvements, and in the same year the Political Resident was able to claim that His Majesty's Government 44 have put the finances of the State on a sound basis. 'U The T Pol. Res. to Gr. of situation is the more satisfactory as the 200 miles of quite thickly p ^f^ 1927 ' inhabited coastline, and the powerful and often hostile hinterland, necessitate the maintenance by Muscat of establishments 'on a scale which would ** Report by Pol. appear absurd in a place like Bahrein or Koweit.'' ::: ' :i: ' p g t nt ' ? ct ' 12 1921 ' Jr. Oaoo J a 1. 41. The improvement referred to above has been secured for rather than by the Sultan, although His Highness has on occasion shown a definite interest in the action taken.ft Sir L. Haworth in March 1928 reported that ft Letter from Pol. 'the Sultan is practically worthless as a Ruler, though he takes a certain Res '' interest in seeing that others rule for him.' The Resident continued, P.lkoi^e. ' 'It was not thought advisable in 1920 to allow him to abdicate, nor do I think it desirable now. An absentee Sultan who does not interfere with the Government has its advantages. It has enabled us to make the arrangement by which with a Council and a British Wazir the finances of the State have 'been put in order, and there is every hope that in a very few years . . . it will commence a new career in flourishing circumstances. Until the Sultan's son is old enough to take over the reins, the Saltan should if possible continue.'jj Mar.^^s ' P 1592/28 42. The cloud on the horizon at the moment is the attitude of the tribes at Sur, the second port of Oman. A critical stage has not been reached, although the local Amir of Jaalan has set up an independent customs administration, but the Political Resident apprehends that should the Amir endeavour to throw off his allegiance to the Sultan and establish an independent dominipn similar to that of the Omanis of the interior, the very considerable reduction of the Sultan's dominions and revenues which would rkl tt msf be involved might necessitate active economic pressure by His Majesty's Pol.

The Oman Rebellion, 1913-21. 43. Up to 1783 the capital of Muscat and Oman was at Rastaq in the interior. Up to 1793 the temporal ruler, who was also the spiritual ruler of the country, had, in accordance with the tenets of the Jbadhi sect ol Islam, been elected by the people. The transfer of the capital to the coast of Muscat relieved the fanatical tribes of the interior of the direct control^ to which they had hitherto been subject, while the fact that from the usurpation of Saiyid Sultan in 1793 the formality of election had been dispensed with, enabled them to regard their nominal ruler as a usurper. The relations with heretical foreign Powers which followed the transfer of the capital a,nd the progressive degeneration in the capacity of the ruling house by which that transfer was accompanied, further weakened the position of the Sultan vis-a-vis the Omani tribes; and a series of rebellions between 1829 and 1867 culminated in the temporary seizure of power (1868-71) by a representative of a younger branch of the ruling family supported by the tribes. 44. The usurper was overthrown in 1871 by the legitimate branch; but between that date and 1913 numerous attempts were made by the Omani tribes to dethrone the Sultans, whose survival as rulers may fairly be said to have been due solely to the support of His Majesty's Government. In the years immediately before the war, tribal feeling was inflamed by the stoppage of the importation of ariiis,' :: ' following on the suppression of the slave trade, both of them measures permitted by Islam, at the instigation of Christian Powers; a carefully organised conspiracy followed, and in May 1913, in an outburst of religious fanaticism, the Omani tribes arose in rebellion.'!' 45. Reinforcements were despatched by His Majesty s Government in fulfilment of a guarantee given to the Sultan in 1895, and then communicated to the Sheikhs of Oman, that they would not allow attacks to be made on Muscat or Muttrah whatever differences the Sultan miglit have with his tribes—a guarantee, the principle of which was extended in practice to the ports of the Batinah coast and to Kuryet, which contained resident British subjects. The warning in question was renewed, with the approval of His Majesty's Government,if but produced no impression on the Omanis, and while in January 1915 the crushing defeat of an attack in force on the British outposts stationed at Bait-el-Falaj for the protection of Muscat and Mattrah taught the tribes their lesson, by 1916 the rebels had obtained complete control of all Oman proper, and had organised a Government in it; and they remained thereafter in undisputed possession of the interior, and a constant menace to the coast towns. These they would probably have taken had it not been for the British garrison at Bait-el-Falaj and the knowledge that the arrival of one of His Majesty's ships would quickly have forced them to relinquish any hold which they might temporarily have established. 46. Thanks to the efforts of the Political Agent, a conference to consider terms of peace between the Sultan and the Imam of the Omani tribes took place at Sib on the 15th September 1915. It was completely abortive,§ the demands of the Sultan that the Wadi Samail and its forts (captured in August 1913, and essential to the commercial prosperity of Muscat) |1 should be returned to him, and his temporal supremacy in Oman recognised, being categorically refused by the Omanis, who demanded on their part that the Sultan should reform his Government according to their ideas, that their financial claims should be settled in full, and that the free purchase of arms and ammunition should be allowed. No reconciliation proved possible, and the negotiations were broken off. 47. From the breaking off of the negotiations in September 1915,^ no further steps were taken towards a settlement until March 1918. The Imam consolidated his power in the interior, while the Sultan's Government, according to the Political Agent, ' became involved in hopeless debt and reached anunparalleled degree of ineptitude.' 48. Further abortive negotiations took place in March 1918, but there was no substantial advance until the following year. At the beginning ot15&amp; ll 9L9 ( see paras. 29-30) the necessity of taking drastic measures to preserve the Sultan's Government on the coast from complete collapse was recognised by the Government of India and His Majesty's Government; a loan from Indian revenues was made to His Highness to enable him to put his house in r order internally, and pressure was put on the Omani tribes through the ** Political Agent with a view to securing a settlement between them and the Sultan. After much correspondence, the Imam was persuaded to resume J^ 3 g 7 from vicero negotiations, and a meeting took place between him and the Political Agent to L of sTor i ^ OJ at Sib on the J5th September 1919 * 49. Very great difficulty was experienced in arriving at agreement. It was only after negotiations had been broken off, and definite action taken to show not only that the support of the Sultan by His Majesty's Government was a reality, but that the Sultan was in a position to retaliate effectively foJ^'tJ^ceroy 8 on the Omanis by the taxing of their produce when it came down to the Jan. 1 61920, coast for export, that any advance was secured. A British Adviser was p - 8544 / 19 ' 5039 / 20 - appointed to the State,! a British warship, which actually inflicted punish- ipriiTi^mo^ 01 ' 0 '' ment at Masnaah,! was despatched to support the Sultan's authority on the P- 3140 /20. coast, and prohibitive duties were imposed on Omani produce, with the § viceroy to s. of s. result that in July 1920 the Imam was murdered by his tribes,§ and that on 1920,''^ 610^20. 10 25th September 1920, after considerable further negotiation, agreement was „ ' ^ 0 tit -1 n- j • 11 0 ' o Viceroy to S. of S. reached between the contlicting parties. [| for 1., nso s., Oct. 9 ' , . 1920, P. 7486, 8294. 50. Under the terms of settlement, the Sultan undertook^ not to interfere of ! Desp 37 in the ' internal affairs' of Oman (no formal admission of Omani indepen- Mar. 311921, dence being given); not to impose taxation in excess of 5 per cent, on p - 1969 / 21 - commodities brought into the coast towns from Oman ; to allow members of the tribes to enter and leave Muscat and the coast towns in safely and freedom ; and to return fugitive criminals on demand. 51. The tribes, on the other hand, contracted to remain in peace and amity with the Sultan's Government, with which they were not to interfere; not to attack the coast towns ; to impose no restrictions on trade : to under take that travellers to Oman on their lawful business should be free and safe; to turn out fugitive criminals and evil-doers; and to dispose of the claims of merchants and others against them according to the Sharah law. 52. The agreement, which, as will be seen, involves recognition by the Sultan of the practical independence of the Omani tribes, has, on the whole, worked well since 1920. Action had to be taken in 1922 by His Majesty's ships in support of the Muscat Government against one of the Omani tribes (the Yal Saad, on the Batineh coast),but, broadly speaking, the situation ** p. 3140/20, has stabilised itself, and the Omani tribes, while they would no doubt 4109 /22, 398/23 constitute an immediate menace were the support of His Majesty's Govern ment withdrawn, have ceased, at any rate temporarily, to interfere with and harass the Sultan's Government. V.—Foreign Relations of Muscat, 1908-1928. 53. During the first part of the period now under consideration, the existence of treaty relations between France and Muscat was, as will be seen from paras. 7-16 above, of the first importance from the standpoint of His Majesty's Government in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic. It is unnecessary to enter into the details of the relations between the two countries, since the substantial consideration which led to French interest in Muscat disappeared with the amicable settlement reached between His Majesty's Government and the French Government on the suppression of the arms traffic in February 1914. But the settlement in question did not involve the abrogation of the French Treaty with Muscat of 1844, or of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, and the continued existence of these instruments is of sufficient importance in present circumstances to call for brief notice in this Memorandum. 54. As will be seen from the precis of the Muscat Treaties referred to in para. 2 above, the Sultan of Muscat has a Commercial Treaty with France dating from 1844. There is further the joint Anglo-French Declaration of 3064 C12 * Sir K. Grey to JTrencIi C. d A., Sept. 22 1913, P. 4222. t P. 522/11. X P. 929/11. ^ Pol, Res. to G. of L, July 21 1920, P f 7125/20. || Tel. IJ-Odi S. from Viceroy to S. of S. for I., Dec. 9 1920, P. 8790/20 ; P.O. to I.O., Sept. 20 1921, P. 4262/21. Letter 109 S. to G. of I., Mar 2 1928, P. 1592/28. 1862, the signatories to which agree reciprocally to respect the indepenrlence of the Sultan. While the agreement concluded by the Sultan with Her Majesty's Government in 1891, under which he pledged himself and his successors never to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation save to Her Majesty's Government, the dominions of Muscat and Oman or any of their dependencies, represents a substantial departure from the spirit I of the Declaration of 1862, that Declaration remained and remains bindiiio- and an assurance that His Majesty's Government recognised it as such Avas formally given to 1 ranee in September 1913.' :i&gt; Its existence, taken with the existence of the Treaty of 1844, was responsible for the difficulty which arose with France in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic between 1910 and 1914, and it is not only clear that it precludes the establishment by His Majesty's Government of a formal protectorate over Muscat, but in view of the action taken under its terms vis-d-vis France at Bander Gisseh in 1899, it seems probable that it constitutes a definite impediment even to the acquisition by His Majesty's Government of the lease, e.g. for use as a naval base, of any portion of Muscat territory. This latter difficulty is of importance at the present time in view of the revival by the Political Resident of the proposal for the establishment of a British naval base at Khassab in the Musandim Peninsula (see paras. 65 to 71 below). 55. It is unnecessary to enter into the history of the efforts made between 1910 and 1914, in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic, to secure French concurrence in the abrogation of the Declaration of 1862 and possibly of the Treaty of 1844. Suffice it to say that it proved impracticable to arrive at an agreement which could be confined to Muscat, or even to Muscat and the French possessions in Indiat; that France was not prepared to cede her rights in return for territorial acquisitions in India alone J; that the Government of India were reluctant to agree to any cession of Indian territory, save in return for a corresponding acquisition of French territory in India (Chandernagore and the Loges); and that proposals of compensation in other parts of the world by the cession of Gambia, the rectification of the Desert Boundary between the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and French Equatorial Africa, or by the grant to the French Government of certain concessions in North Africa, came to nothino- 56. The position, therefore, is that French rights persist in their entirety. On the other hand, for the last 14 years no matter of dispute between the French Government and His Majesty's Government has arisen in Muscat; the Muscat dhows flying the French flag had fallen by 1920 to seven, of which two only belonged to French subjects§ ; and French interests in the affairs of the Sultanate has shown a progressive decrease, although a Consulate is still maintained by France. In 1920—1 the French Government relinquished the coal depot at Mokalla,|| which had been granted them at the time of the Bandei Gisseh incident of 1899 dealt with in Mr. Parker s memorandum, and in 1928 the Political Hesident^J stated that he gathered from the French Consul (at Bushiie?) that France novv takes very little interest in Muscat and is now considering closing down permanently the Consulate, which has not been held by any incumbent for some years.' si. While, however, France may no longer actively concern herself with Muscat affairs, so long as the engagements referred to in para. 54 remain in being His Majesty's Government cannot be regarded as free agents in respect of Muscat, even though practical control may rest with them and all external expenditure on the State be financed by them. On a broad view, the interests of His Majesty's Government would'probably best be served by the abrogation of both instruments, and it is possible that, at some later stage, it French interest m Muscat diminishes to vanishing point the Freuch Government might be willing to consider the extinction of their rights as part of an arrangement which would also dispose of the long-standing question of the French Loges in India itself, without demanding an unreasonable quid pro quo. But it cannot be overlooked that the 1862 Declaration, inconvenient as it may be in certain ways to His Majesty's Government, is of value as constituting a certain check on designs on Mnsiat by other Powers, h rom a difterent standpoint, its existence, taken with that13 of the Treaty of 184-^, is an assurance to the Sultan, the value of which was certainly fully appreciated by his predecessor, that he will not suffer the late of Zanzibar. 58 The United States of America, despite their Treaty of 1833 with ®Muscat, appear in practice to have bo relations of any importance with +w StotP tVipir interests in which are now entrusted to His Majesty s that State, their interests ^ - , . . - , nnvpmTripnt •••• No question affecting these relations arose during the period - Tel. from viceroy now under consideration. Here, however, as in the case of France, the ^ c f; 2 0 9 ; 92 o' r guarantees embodied in the Treaty of 1833 would make it impossible tor the p. 7936/20. Sultan to increase his customs duty (the most important method of raising revenue at his disposal) without the prior concurrence of the United fetates Government (cp para. 3/ above). 59. No question affecting the relations between the Sultan and the Dutch Government arose during the period in question, and those relations appear, as in the case of the United States Government, to be entirely unimportant. Under the Commercial Declaration of 1877 Holland is, however, entitled to mostfavoured-nation treatment, and so would be affected by any modification of the customs duties. 60. The possibility of the development of a German interest in Muscat was of interest to His Majesty's Government in the years before the war. The present Sultan was informed in 1913 that His Majesty s Government could not agree to direct correspondence between him and the German tj^ront v.ceroy Consul a practice contrary to the practice of Sultan Faisal, who had referred ^ 31 ms to His Majesty's Government matters affecting Powers unrepresented at Muscait . p - 139, The danger of the acquisition by Germany of a foothold im Muscat through the grant to Muscatis.of German certificates of nationality, was prominently before His Majesty's Government and the Government of India in 1914. To prevent the establishment of a precedent which could be quoted by Germany, arrangements were made that the British flag should not be granted to Muscat subjects in British East Africa unless a 'no objection' certificate had first been secured from the Sultan through the tpol Res toG of Political Agent, J and the question of securing the Sultan s approval to an f^ gept 201912) edict which would have made his personal consent a condition of the transfer of allegiance by an Omani to a foreign State was under consideration at the p 2340/14. outbreak of the war.§ The difficulty which would be presented by a § p ol Eeg to G of German request to the'signatories of the Joint Declaration of 1862 for their l, july 261914, concurrence in the conclusion o£ a direct German^ Commercial Treaty with Muscat (on the basis of which a political connection could^ be developed), were brought to the attention of Government by the Political Resident in July 1914. Relations between Muscat and Persia. 61. No question of importance as between Persia and Muscat has arisen during the period now in question, it may be recorded that in the autumn of 1914, on the request of the Persian Government, the Political Agent was instructed to exercise his good offices on behalf of Persian subjects in Muscat ^ F 0 toI 0 should an appeal be made to him, and in all serious cases of hardship and Nov . 4 1911, ' rr r p. 4594, P. 2924/14. oppression ^ | The report recently received from Sir Lionel Ha worth that instructions Tel. from Pol. Res. had been issued by the' Persian Government to the Governor of Bushire that Ij? f b ^\^n/2s. Persia can recognise no rulers on the Arab coast of the Gulf, and that persons belonging to and arriving from Muscat (as from the other principalities on the Arab littoral) are to be considered Persian subjects, and Persian passports issued to them, necessitates, however, a brief reference to the possible basis of a Persian claim to suzerainty over Muscat. So far Lor. 1. 399. as can be traced, the only two incidents in the past on which any such claim Lot - l 40t5 - T - could be based are the fact that for a few months in 1623 Persia occupied Sohar and Khor Fakkan and that from 1737 until her expulsion in 1744 she was in occupation of Muscat. It is impossible as yet to estimate the importance which should be attached to the report referred to above, of which no confirmation is available from other sources. Any Persian claim of the14 nature indicated would, however, clearly be fantastic, and could not in any circumstances be admitted by His Majesty's Government. The fact that Muscat is in treaty relations of long standing, not only with His Majesty's Government but with other first-class Powers, and that those treaty relations are based on the recognition by the Powers in question of the complete independence of the State, would further strengthen the Sultan's position against any claim at this stage to suzerainty hy Persia. Relations between Muscat and Ibn Saud. 62. Ibn Saud is a growing influence on the Trucial Coast, but he has not so far come very directly in contact &gt;ith Muscat, to the independence of which he constitutes at the moment a less immediate menace than is the case on the Trucial Coast. VI.—Miscellaneous Questions. (a) The Muscat Order in Council. (h) Establishment of a British Naval Base on the Musandim Peninsula. (c) Cession of Gwadur. (d) Oil in Muscat. (a) The Muscat Order in Council—1867 and 1915. 63. From 1867 the jurisdiction exercised over British subjects in Muscat *c letter '05 by the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul was exercised from Poi. res. to g . ^der the Muscat Order in Council of 1867.^ The revision of this Order, p ^sms 191913 ' u hlC ^ llad be . come out of date ' was raised b y Political Resident in the -Persian Gulf m 1913.

Various regulations, &amp;c., have since 1916 been issued under the new «p 98i/22i Older certain amendments in which were approved by His Majesty in S P . 931 /22. Council in 1922,§ but no question of importance has arisen in connection with its working. (b) Proposal for the establishment of a British Naval Base in the Musandim Peninsula. ^ q ? eai ^ ie r history of this proposal, which appears first to have been fzpo • • • eW1 ? 1 ? lly ^ tlien PoIitica l Resident in the Persian Gulf, in 1863, is given in the loreign Office Memorandum of 1908, and in Lorimer's lersian Gulf Gazetteer, Vol. 1, pp. 251 to 258. was again raised in 1913. In a Note communicated to the Committee of Imperial Defence on 17th January 1913, the Admiralty expressed the view that it was ' essentia] that any naval station that may be15 required ' (i.e. at the mouth of the Gulf) ' should not be either at Bunder Abbas or on the adjacent islands, but on the Ras Musandim promontory or the Arabian shore. There w-ould otherwise be risk of our being driven by military force from our necessary naval base. Moreover, the only anchorages which can be trusted are on the Arabian shore.' 67. Almost simultaneously the Political Resident had suggested that it might be desirable to choose Ras Musandim as a site for a lighthouse in preference to Little Quoin,* and the Government of India, in the light of the # Tel. from Pol. expression of the views of the Admiralty quoted above, were prepared to jan agree to the substitution 'apart from the considerations arising from the / t I i f „ V* Anglo-French Declaration of ]862.'t to s. o/s^or ij 07 G8. In April 1913 the Government of India reported that the Director, IVIar - 121913 ' p - 951 - Royal Indian Marine, saw technical objections to the selection of Musandim as the site for a lighthouse on the grounds that 'thick weather over Musandim is the rule rather than the exception . . . further . . . worst tides experienced anywhere in the Gulf and its approaches are found round j Tel. from viceroy Musandim Island. to s. of s. for i., a 1 • 1 April 26 1913, 69. In May the Admiralty expressed the view that ' while a naval base R 1663 - on the Musandim Peninsula would theoretically be in a somewhat better strategical position for the control of a railway passing along the northern shore of the entrance to the Gulf, if threatened by a hostile advance from the north-west, practical considerations point rather for the present to the use of Henjam . . . with Basidu as a subsidiary base. It does not appear necessary to contemplate the actual fortification of a naval base in this region so long as we retain the command of the sea in Eastern waters.'§ This disposed l.ofMayt 1913 of the question of a station on Musandim; and it was agreed that the P- 1733/28. lighthouse in contemplation should be erected on Little Quoin as being preferable from the strictly navigational standpoint. 70. There appear to have been no developments until in February 1927 the Political Resident 11 indicated that Khassab was of value, not merely in n Desp. 4 from Pol connection with the air route, on which it would constitute a jumping off Feb 19 lim I ' ground for Gwadur on the Makran coast, but for strategical reasons, since p e i575. 1927 ' u the country possessing it can practically command egress from and ingress to the Persian Gulf.' Sir L. llaworth therefore favoured the purchase of Khassab from Muscat, possibly for about £12,000, and the establishment of ' a Gibraltar at the head of the Gulf.' He regarded this as practicable vis-d-vis France, in view of the right of pre-emption enjoyed by His Majesty's Government under the Exclusive Agreement of 1891. 71. No views have been expressed on the subject by the Government of India. With the Persian challenge to the position of His Majesty's Govern ment in Basidu and Henjam the possibility of establishing, if not a fortified base, at any rate a station, in the Musandim Peninsula or on one of the adjoining islands, on two of which (Telegraph Island and Sheep Island) the British flag has for a short period been hoisted in the past, becomes of more , immediate importance. But, financial and strategical considerations apart, the extent to which His Majesty's Government are free agents vis-d-vis France, who, though aware of, is not a party to, and has never formally recognised, the Exclusive Agreement of 1891, will call for careful examina tion before a decision can be taken. &lt;(c) The Cession of Gwadur. 72. It was decided in 1863 after exhaustive examination that no attention need or could be paid to the claims to Gwadur, a dependency of Muscat in Makran, on the Persian littoral of the Gulf, of the Khan of Kalat or of i' Letter from g . the Gitchkis. This decision was reaffirmed by the Government of India o£T - toA -GU^ ir&gt; 1 OOQ ft Baluchistan, July IS 1928, p. 4140/28. 73. The question of its retransfer to Kalat at a price was raised by the Political Agent, Muscat, in J 921, when the financial situation of Muscat was .. Te] lm(rom critical, but the Government of India were instructed®® that no overtures s. of s. for I. to' 1 should be made to the Sultan of Muscat without prior reference to His S^v'S'toS Majesty's Government, and the matter dropped. of Oct. 9 1920, P. 6271, 7513.16 74. The geographical position of Gwaclur would lend it considerable importance in the event of an air route being established along the Desp. to G. of i., north Arabian coast, and the Political Resident m rebruary 19l / proposed rp e i575. 1927 ' that it should be purchased outright for, say, ! ' it ^ a ! ,3 T purchase of the present customs reyenne (Rs. 116,000 m 1^-^' sa y Hakh I after deduction of expenses of collection) as a Lntish possession, the Khan of Kalat being compensated for his claim out of the amount in question No opinion on the matter has been expressed by the Government of India. But, as in the case of Khassab and the Musandim Promontory (para. 71 above), the extent to which His Majesty s Goveinment are tree agents vis a-vis France would need very careful examination before a decision could be taken even were the proposal held to be free from objection on other grounds. (d) Oil in Muscat. 75 The Sultan undertook in February 1923 not to exploit any oil which Fei'?3 eS i92 0 3f' 0fL ' might be found in his territories, or to grant permission for its exploitation, p. 1151/23. without prior consultation with the Political Agent, and the appio\al of the Government of India. An oil concession was secured from His Highness, with the approval of His Majesty's Government, by the Anglo-1 eisian Oil c.o. to i.o., Company in 1925. (The general question of oil in tne Gulf is dealt Vvith in May 22 1925, &amp;c., ^ Memorandum by the Board of Trade on p. HI.) xr, 1589 / 25. VII.—Summary. 76. The last 20 years have seen the practical elimination of French influence in Muscat and the consolidation of the influence of His Majesty's Government. Despite the fact that the Sultanate is independent, a very close degree of indirect control has been established ; the succession has been regulated ; the customs administration has been brought under the management of officials recommended by the Government of India; a European adviser, a servant indeed of the Sultan, but recommended and selected by the Government of India, and working in close and friendly co-operation with the Political Agent, is the mainspring of the adminis tration; the arms traffic has disappeared, and, thanks to the active intervention, both political and otherwise, of His Majesty's Government, a working arrangement has been reached with the rebellious tribes of the interior of Oman. The main difficulties which at the moment confront the State are the instability of the Sultan's character, and the possibility that before a suitable successor is available he may renew his desire to abdicate; the financial situation, which is complicated by the need for expenditure on essential improvements, the fact that the main source of additional revenue—increase of customs duties—cannot without great difficulty be tapped, and the necessity of repayment to the Government of India of the balance of the loan made to the State in 1919 : and the problem, the importance of which cannot at this stage be appraised, but which may not prove to be serious, of the attitude of the tribes of Sur. 77. The direct intervention in the affairs of Muscat of His Majesty's Government has been very definitely in the interests of the State, and, so iar as those interests are concerned, it is desirable that it should be maintained. At the same time, so long as the treaties at present in force between the Sultan and the Governments of France, Holland and the United States continue to subsist, there can be no question of the establishment of a formal protectorate, even should wider objections of principle not be held to militate against the acceptance of such a policy. From the narrower point of view of the interests of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India, there is no less advantage in a maintenance of the status quo, under which control in everything but name rests with His Majesty's Government. With the gradual elimination of British authority from the south Persian coast and with the adoption, for however long it may be maintained, of an active policy in the Gulf by Persia, the strangle hold on the Gulf which the effective control of Muscat constitutes has assumed an importance, more especially in view of British commitments in Iraq, which it did not in the past present. Moreover, not only is effective, if veiled,]7 -control of Muscat tlie point (Tappui of the consolidation of F^ritish influence on the north Arabian littoral, but the danger, in its absence, of active foreign interest in the State cannot be overlooked, while should it ultimately prove that the difficulties in the way of an Imperial air route through Persian territory are insuperable, Muscat, with its dependency Gwadur, may prove to Q be of great importance for air reasons. From the naval point of view, should a decision favourable to the establishment of a naval base in the Musandim Peninsula at any stage be taken, and should it prove possible to reconcile the acquisition of a site for such a base with the terms of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, the principality would acquire an additional importance. 78. To sum up. The predominant influence in Muscat of His Majesty's Government is in the interest of the State itself. The commitments involved in its maintenance are not, in existing circumstances, heavy, though the presence of a British Adviser and the exclusion of foreign interference imposes on His Majesty's Government a measure of responsibility for the progress, or lack of progress, of the State. The predominant influence of His Majesty's Government is equally, and more especially in present circumstances, an Imperial interest, whether from the commercial or the strategical standpoint. It can be maintained without undue Westernisation,' and, while it can never be popular with the fanatical tribes of the interior, its withdrawal is unlikely to be desired so long as the country internally remains divided as it has been for many years, and so long as no ruler arises with a personality so outstanding as to show himself capable of disposing effectively, single- handed, of the problems presented by the government of his State. VIII.—Points referred to in connection with Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. 79. The points in connection with Muscat which have been specifically mentioned in connection with the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub- ( Committee are as follow :— (1) Is the maintenance of the independence of Muscat (which is also threatened, though less immediately, by Ibn Saud) necessary for British purposes, and, if so, how is it to be secured ? (P.G. 3 (viii).) (2) Steps necessary on the north Arabian coast in connection with slavery and the arms traffic. (P.G. 6, 2 (c) 3.) (3) Extent to which British influence is to be maintained in Muscat: question of relations between the Sultan and the Amirs of Jaalan (Sur): position vis-d-vis the French. (P.G. 6, 2 (c) 5.) IX.—Views expressed by Government of India. SO. The Government of India have expressed the view that ''the maintenance of independence of Muscat, Koweit, Bahrein and the Trucial Chief is necessary. Our veiled protectorate over them suffices against Tel. from viceroy European encroachments. So long as we do not alienate Arab opinion by £3 1 ' attempting undue Westernisation, it suffices also against encroachments by p. ssso, p.g.'9, the Wababi State. At need it can be more explicitly asserted.' India Office, 25th August 1928. J. G. L.dONFIDENTIAI.. B. 401. INDIA OFFICE ^ Lighting and Buoying of the Persian Gulf, 1908-1928. I.—First Reconstruction.: 1909-14. 1. For many years before 1900 the lighting and buoying of the Persian Gulf had beenleft almost entirely to private enterprise. The British India Steam Navigation Company were principally concerned with such arrano-ements as existed, and in 1909 were maintaining 15 buoys and one beacon 'at Bahrein) in the Gulf. The Government of India had erected one beacon at Ras al Araz, Koweit, and the Belgian Customs Administration one at Ras al Marg, Bushire ; some sporadic buoying bad also been carried out. Turkish lights and buoys were maintained at the head of the Gulf. The question of regulating the service was, however, brought into prominence p. 2680/07. by the increase of German and lurkish activities in the Gulf eaily m the century. In 1907, for instance, the Ham burg-Amerika Company proposed to contribute to the upkeep of the British India Steam Navigation Company's buoys, and as this seemed to be the beginning of a political move it was suggested that the British Government should take over the whole service. 2. The Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence in their Report of the 26th January 1909, having learned from evidence given that the lighting, &amp;c.. in the Gulf was unsatisfactory, supported a recommendation already made-by the Government of India that a Commission should be sent to the' Gulf to collect information with a view to improving conditions at Letter from Trinity small cost.. A Committee of Enquiry was appointed and reported on the Ho^toi.o., 29th April 1909 ; they recommended a large reorganisation, detailed m a p.3503/09, 3620/09 supplementary report. 3. It was decided that Government should undertake responsibility for Letter from I.O. to the service, and long correspondence ensued between the Home Departments concerned and with the Government of India. By 1912 the following p. 642/12 ; Memo. programme of reconstruciion had been worked out and sanctioned b. isTfrom 3 lighthouses at Musandim (Little Quoin), Tamb, and Sheikh Shuaib. b. i^afrom i.o., 1 lightvessel outside the Shatt-el-Arab. 6 lighted buoys (Bushire 2, Bahrein 2, Bander Abbas and Shatt-el- Arab). 3 unlit buoys (together with, certain buoys taken over from the British India Steam Navigation Company). 1 lighthouse tender. 1 lighthouse depot. 4. Meamvhile the obstructive activities of the Turkish authorities continued and counterbuoying was carried on by them, especially in the Shatt-el-Arab. It is unnecessary, however, to consider these activities in detail, since by the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913, which was awaiting ratification on the outbreak of war, the Ottoman Government undertook, while reserving Turkish territorial rights, not to oppose measures which His Majesty's Government might carry out in respect of surveys, lighting, buoying or pilotage. 5. The main features of the programme of reconstruction were carried p. 2252 /12, 2908 /12, out in 1912-14. Lighted buoys for Bushire, Bahrein and Bander Abbas were sent out from this country in June and September 1912. A lighted buoy had already in 1911 been placed at the outer bar of the Shatt. Unlit buoys were manufactured in India. The Tamb light was exhibited in July 1913, the Little Quoin light in January 1914. The Shatt-el-Arab light- p ; 3456/13. vessel was despatched to the Gulf and established in April 1914 ; a protest was made by the Turkish Government against its establishment, but it was p. 1472/14. pointed out that the ship was 10 miles outside the bar, and not in Turkish territorial waters. The lighthouse, .tender, named NearcHus, was 'built and conLntLpie.: sailed for India in December 1914. (The despatch vessel R.l.M.S. Lawrence Sept. 51914, . P. 4248/14. 3074 75 10.28 AV P. 460/15.

A convenient source of oil supply was at hand in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 6. The only parts of the programme not completed were (a) the Sheikh Shuaib light, (6) the lighthouse depot. These are dealt with below. Notifications of the various aids to navigation were given from time to time to mariners and in some cases to foreign Consular representatives. In June 1914 the Political Resident was instructed to issue a complete notification of all changes and improvements to the Local Government at Bushire and the Customs authorities, and to keep both them and the Consular representatives informed of future developments.

Certain extensions of the original programme were also carried out. Masthead lights on the Henjam and Chahbar telegraph stations, like those already in existence at Jask, were exhibited in 1914. 8. In 1913-4 the Political Resident proposed a general overhaul of beacons, The following beacons were to be maintained:—Koweit (Ras-al- Arz), Bushire (Ras-al-Marg), Jask, Henjam and Basidu. New beacons were to be built at Kubbar (near Koweit), Khor Kaliya (near Bahrein) and Hahil. That at Halul was to be erected not so much to aid navigation as to establish a foothold against Turkish and German designs; the ownership of the island being, as will be seen from the memorandum on page ||, undecided, though there are some grounds for considering it under Abu Dhabi. All the proposals were sanctioned by the early part of .1914. Tel. to Viceroy, Dec. 15 1914, P. 4600/14. P. 5056/17. D.O. letter from 9. Later in the same year the question arose of the ownership of certain islands off the coast between Koweit and Bahrein, and, mainly for political reasons, beacons which might help, if necessary, to establish a claim to ownership were sanctioned, and set up in 1915, on the islands of Farsi, Arabi and Harkus. 10. The beacon at Henjam (Ras-al-Mashia) was restored in 1917, and a light placed on it. That at Halul was removed from charts, &amp;C., on a A.dity. Sept. 281928. report from R.I.M.S. Nearchus in 1923.

The Sheikh Shuaib project p.o. to lo ., April 29 again failed to mature (see IV (d)), but a temporary lightship was established, 1924, p. 1498/24. as a substitute, off Kais Island in 1918, and was replaced by a semi permanent vessel in 1923.

S hatt-el- A rab .—In 1916-7 a general reorganisation of the buoying of the river entrance was carried out for war purposes. The channel was marked by three gas buoys and eight unlit buoys. Shortly after the war, however, the lighting and buoying of the Shatt-el-Arab was taken over by the Basra Port Directorate and ceased to be the concern of the Government ot' India. 13. L ighthouse D epot .^—The original scheme of reconstruction provided for a depot at Koweit, but Abadan island was found to be more suitable. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company were willing in 1912 to lease an area, but no progress was made before the war. During the war the Company's trade expanded, and the offer of the area selected for a depot was withdrawn; the lighting service was, however, allowed to remain at Abadan temporarily. In 1921 the Government of India proposed to unite with the Basra Port authorities in a joint depot at Fao. This was sanctioned in 1922. 14. In 1923 the lighthouse tender Nearchus was declared unfit for service, and her sale was authorised in 1924. She was replaced by the new R.I.M.S, Lawrence, which combined the duties of despatch vessel and tender.15. The last five years have been too much taken up with administrative and financial readjustments to permit of any extensive developments in the service. The most pressing needs at the moment, however, are said to be ^ the replacement of the light vessel oil Kais Island and the establishment ©of a lighthouse at Ras-al-Hadd. The desirability of the latter has been represented on several occasions by individual merchant ships and by the Merchant Service Guild. III.—Administration and Finance. 16. The question of raising light dues from vessels using the Gulf, to pay for the maintenance of the service, was considered before the war. But it was decided that such a course would be impossible 'without the Letter from f o. consent of the Powers whose flags are flown by the vessels navigating the Gulf, and such consent would not be forthcoming except on conditions implying that very international control which it is the aim of His Majesty 's Government to exclude.' The whole cost of the service (about £30,000 to £40,000 a year) was therefore borne in equal shares by Imperial and Indian revenues, all fresh expenditure exceeding £100 requiring the prior sanction of His Majesty's Government. Subject to this control, the Government of India were responsible for administration; during the period (1912-4) of reconstruction the Political Resident was ex-officio 'Inspector of Lights,' p. 3599/12,3456/13. with the Commander of R.LM.S. Lawrence as Assistant Inspector. In 1915 Pol. Res. to g . of 1., the inspectorship was transferred to the Director of the Royal Indian Marine, iVo^oi Res who, under the Government of India, was thenceforth responsible for the June 101913.' es '' maintenance of the Service. The commander of the tender remained d.r.lm . to g . of i., ■ Assistant Inspector of Lights, and was expected to consult the Political Mar - Resident on all political matters in connection with the lights. P ' 1482/15 * 17. After the war, with the elimination of Turkish and German interests in the Gulf, His Majesty's Government were anxious to divest themselves f.o . Memo., ■ of financial commitments, and in 1923 an inter-departmental conference p^^ 5 ' recommended that light dues should be levied at Basra and Abadan. It Tel fro ^ G of j was ascertained that in 1922 96 per cent, of the shipping which crossed Mar. 21 1923, the Shatt-el-Arab bar was British. The British shipping interests were R 1056/23 - consulted, and it was agreed that an Advisory Committee should be formed •of commercial and shipping representatives to work in partnership with the Government of India in the administration of the new Lighting and Buoying Fund ; the Iraq Government agreed to levy the dues, which were put into force (at the rate of 3 annas a ton, since reduced to IJ annas a ton) Bagdad Desp on the 1st November 1925. His Majesty's Government agreed to contribute Dec. 11926, £5,000 a year for five years, subject to review at the end of that period. p - 4480 / 26 - Admiralty tankers were to be exempted from dues. No law has been Bagdad Desp., passed by the Iraq Government to provide for the levy, but it appears that the dues are satisfactorily collected at Basra and Abadan, without real legal 921/ ' &gt; '- authority, by the Port Directorate. 18. Since 1st January 1927, the Port Directorate have been employed by the Government of India as 'contractors' for the Gulf lights. Instead of Tel. from viceroy, R.LM.S. Lawrence being used as tender, Nearchus, which was apparently p^'s^V. 27 ' sold to the Port authorities, has returned to her old employment. The vessel flies a British flag outside Iraq territorial waters. 19. This has enabled considerable economies to be made, and the Fund is now in a comparatively prosperous state. In October 1927, full power Letter from f.o., was given to the Government of India to manage the fund entirely without p 0 ^^/ 1 , 927, reference to His Majesty's Government, under the arrangements made with • 4938 the shipping interests. IV.—Relations with Persia. 20. It may be useful for present purposes to mention briefly the main occasions during the^ British management of the Lighting and Buoying Service when His Majesty's Government have come into collision with the Persian Government. (a) Tamb —(See Memorandum on Tamb, &amp;c., paras. 25 to 28 on page g.) {h) General Policy .—Early in 1913 the question arose of securing, as a condition of a certain loan to the Persian Government, a declaration4 Teh. tel..

Desp. from S. of S. to G. of 1., July 16 1925, P. 948/25. acknowledging British responsibility for lighting and bnoying. , All„ however, that the Minister could obtain was a inemoranduin from the Persian Government expressing their disposition to cause iiguthoases to be erected and buoys to be placed in or in the_ neighbourhood of Persian islands to be determined in consultation with His Majesty s Government, * British personnel being' employed, and a loan being raised, if necessary, from His Majesty Government, repayable by tolls on shipping. The Government of India considered that this would be a ' surrender of our present position,' and that it was 41 essential that lighting arrangements on both sides of the Gulf should be controlled by the same management.' It was decided that the matter should be dropped, but that a declaration should he made that His Majesty's Government 'regard themselves as- possessing a prescriptive right to control lighting and buoying arrrange- ments in the Gulf, which., should occasion aiise^ they would not hesitate' to enforce.' (c) Larak .—In August 1913, the Political Resident reported the alleged intention of the Persian Government to erect a light on Larak, (neai Bander Abbas). ' It would be an inconvenient intrusion on our scheme and opposed to our prescriptive right to control the lighting of the Gulf. Ihe Persian Government, however/on enquiry, disclaimed any intention of the sort and said that they would certainly consult His Majesty's Government before taking such a step. (d) Sheikh Shuaib .—This island was one of those originally chosen for a lighthouse. It was recognised that since the island was undoubtedly Persian, permission would have to be obtained from the Persian Government to lease a site. His Majesty's Minister at Tehran was instructed to approach them in 1911, but reported that the Persian Government would only authorise the erection of a lighthouse under their own auspices. As this, would undermine the British supremacy in matters of lighting and might involve financial difficulties if dues were subsequently levied, it was decided to drop the project altogether. In 1917, the matter was raised again by the Government of India, who proposed to erect a light without consulting the Persian Government; but various delays supervened and it was not till 1923 that the Government of India stated that they were anxious to proceed with the construction. They thought, however, that prior reference to the Persian Government would in present circumstances be necessary. His Majesty's Minister at Tehran reported in November 1923 that on raising the question he had been informed of the intention of the Persian Ministry of War to arrange for the erection themselves. Thus His Majesty's Government and the Government of India found themselves in exactly the same position as in 1912. Any such scheme for Persian control was strongly deprecated by the Secretary of State, though the Government of India were inclined to favour it. The Political Resident suggested an alternative light on Nabiyu Farur, but it was decided that, other objections apart, the status of the island was such that a prior reference to the Persian Government would be necessary before a light could be established. The question of the Sheikh Shuaib lighthouse was accordingly dropped once more. V.—Conclusions. 21. It appears that the lighting and buoying of the Gulf has been efficiently carried out since the assumption of responsibility b3 r the Govern ment of India, and it has been almost entirely to British activity that the larger vessels using the Gulf (of which the overwhelming majority British) are indebted for the existing aids to navigation. 22. The Persian Government has never been in a position to maintain an effective service and has never played any constructive part. The proposals for Persian construction at Sheikh Shuaib and in the Gulf generally (see IV (h) and {d)) have been based on the employment of British personnel and British money. 23. In the Memorandum of the 1st March 1922 to the United States Letter from i.o. to Government the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said :—' The Persian p .' O 2460 /22. 3 1922 ' Gulf has for more than a century been the scene of active British influence-5 and a predominant British trade. Piracy has been suppressed, the slave trade has been abolished, the waters have been lighted and buoyed and order has been preserved by the exertions of Great Britain.' 24. So far as lighting and buoying is concerned, it has always been the (f aim of His Majesty's Government to maintain their supremacy against foreign encroachment, and it is on the efficiency of the service and the lack of alternative organisation, together with the desirability of unified control, that the strongest arguments for the continuance of the present arrangements can be based. 25. The main avenues for possible encroachment by the Persian Government appear to be (a) the Shatt-el-Arab and Abadan, (6) the places such as Bushire, Henjam, Sheikh Shuaib, &amp;c., on the Persian side of the Gnlf, (c) the islands and ports on the Arabian side to which Persia lays claim, or the status of which is indeterminate (see Memorandum on Status of certain Groups of Islands, on page 2J). 26. The Political Resident in the Gulf has reported that the subject is one in which the Persian authorities have recently shown interest, and that they have spoken to him on the subject of the buoys at Bushire. He adds— ' The latter [the Bushire buoys] might be within the power of control of the Italian officer who is to be in charge of their new Preventive Service Launch, but the main question of lighting and buoying is beyond their capacity, and they could probably not pay for, nor would they efficiently keep up, a lightship such as that at Kais island. It is quite certain that we could not willingly leave our shipping to be dependent upon the vagaries of a Persian system Letter 2758 from of lighthouses. The danger would be too great, and the Persian has of Lt got to show greater capacity for organisation and maintenance before p U 4482. we could agree to such a proposal.' 27. The Government of India have indicated that in their view Tel. from viceroy, retention by His Majesty's Government of responsibility for the lighting p^f 1928 ' and buoying of the Gulf is indispensable.

The El Katr (or Qatar) Peninsula, which is governed by the Sheikhs « -of the Thani family, lies south of Ojair, in the district of Qatif, the most | t southernly point to |which, with the exception of Koweit, His Majesty's Government prior to the War of 1914 recognised continuous Turkish iufluence. It lies, on the other hand, north of El Odeid, to which the it • Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi was allowed to assert his rights of possession in 1878, and which prior to 1916 formed the western boundary of the $||| territories of the Trucial Sheikhs. The status of the Peninsula formed the subject of lengthy discussion in the period prior to 1908, details of which will be found in the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908. .the J; The vexed question of the status of El Katr was finally disposed of in nsbuj the Anglo-Turkish negotiations of 1912-14. Under the unratified Anglo- Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913, the Ottoman Government renounced all rights to the Peninsula, which was, as in the past, to continue to be governed by the Sheikhs of the Thani family, while His Majesty's Government j engaged not to permit the Sheikh of Bahrein to interfere in the internal s™' affairs of El Katr, to threaten its autonomy or to annex it. A supplementary article reserved the rights of the inhabitants of Bahrein to visit the island of Zakhnuniyah for fishing purposes, as in the past. 3. A new situation arose with the conquest of Hasa by Ibn Saud in the course of 1913. El Katr, like the Oman coast, formed, in his view, part of bar isl ancestral domains, to which he could therefore prefer a claim as of right.* * P - A - Bahrein to [ Babi But the Amir was warned at the end of the year that non-interference with fig- E1 Katr was a condition of the maintenance of friendly relations with His Majesty's Government,! and no difficulty in consequence arose. The tLr. from Pol. Res. #ii -conclusion of a formal treaty between El Katr and His Majesty's Government, 11 in sew which, other considerations apart, was in the immediately pre-war period of ' much importance in connection with the arms traffic, was postpone'dj until tp. 3749/13,2698 /14. the final ratification of the Anglo-Turkish Convention, and so had not been disposed of on the outbreak of the European War. 4. In common with the rulers of the other States in the Gulf, the Sheikh § Lr.fromPoi. Res. mentii of El Katr was notified by the Political Resident of the outbreak of war with septfigi'/p.^^o sons. Tuikey in November 1914,§ and throughout the period of the war maintained ^302. a friendly attitude towards His Majesty's Government. 5. Under the treaty concluded between His Majesty's Government and Ibn Sand on the 26th December 1915, the Uuler of Nejd undertook to refrain from aggression on, or interference with, 'the territories of . . . the Sheikhs of Katr and the Oman coast, who are under the protection of the British Government, and who have treaty relations with the said Government, and the limits of their territories shall be hereafter determined.' 6. The outbreak of the European War, which led to a falling off in the II Viceroy to s. of s. arms traffic in the Gulf, rendered the conclusion of a definitive treaty with p ' itoo ^ i T . 61915 El Katr less urgent, and it was not until May 1915|| that the question was g. of 1. to Pol. Res., revived. Lengthy negotiation proved necessary' before a satisfactory p ^ ss V u 5 ' agreement could be reached, and it was not until 3rd November 19161T that it p. 2430/16 a treaty was finally concluded between the Sheikh and His Majesty's 4583 / 16 ) 268 /17. Government. Ihe treaty, the terms of which are summarised in the precis •of treaties appended to the present Memorandum, secured to the Sheikh the advantages conferred under the Trucial treaties on the Sheikhs of Trucial Oman, while imposing on him the obligations in regard to piracy, the slave traffic, the arms traffic, the grant of concessions, the cession, sale, gift lease 3091 b 50 10.282 or transfer of territory to other Powers, and the maintenance of relations witlj foreign Powers already accepted by those Chiefs. In order to secure the signature of the Sheikh, it was agreed that the^ articles of the treaty (7, 8 and 9) which related to the admission of British subjects to Katr for trading purposes and their protection while so engaged, the admission of^ an Agent on behalf of His Majesty's Government, and the establishment oi® post and telegraph offices in Katr, should remain inoperative for the present, while a minor concession was made in respect of the retention by the Sheikli and his dependents of negro slaves actualiy in their possession, on the understanding that they would receive 'fair and just treatment.' 7. The one respect of importance in which the treaty went beyond^the normal type of Trucial treaty was that it contained an undertaking that the good offices of His Majesty's Government should be granted to the Sheikh in the event of unprovoked aggression against him hy land within the territories of Katr (Article XI). The assurance in question did not, however, in practice impose any very serious liability on His Majesty's Government, as was shown when a tentative appeal was made to it by the Sheikh in 1922 (see para. 9 of Memorandum on the Trucial Sheikhs, 1908-28, on page ^). / 8.

It is not proposed in this memorandum to enter in any detail into the internal history of the Trueial States, but rather to deal in a general way with the developments which have taken place in the last 20 years, and tne problems presented by the States as matters stand to-day. 2. The Trncial Chiefs—so-called on account of the treaties of maritime truce concluded by them between 1820 and 1853 with His Majesty's Government, under which a check was imposed on their internecine strife and their piratical and slaving activities in the Gulf—are the Sheikhs of Ras-al-Khaima, Umm-al-Qaiwain, Ajman, Shargah, Dabai, Abu Dhabi and El Katr. The last-named Principality, the history of which between 1908 and 1916 is separately dealt with in the Note on p. was added to the number of the Trucial States consequent on the conclusion* on ord November * P. 268 /17. 1916 of a treaty between the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government, under which His Majesty's Government recognised the independence of El Katr and, in return for certain undertakings, extended to it the benefit of the guarantees contained in the Trucial Treaties. The territory ruled over by the Trucial Sheikhs at the present day lies on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf, between the west side of the Promontory of El Katr (or Qatar) and approximately the north point of the Musandim Promontory in Oman (compare Map II appended to this Memorandum). 3. The Trucial States remain independently administered tribal princi palities, governed by independent Arab Sheikhs. The Trucial Treaties (the substance of which is given in the precis of treaty engagements printed as an Appendix to this Memorandum) accord to the contracting parties the right to accredit a representative on the one side at the headquarters of the several Chiefs, and on the other at the British Residency at Bushire ; but in practice the Chiefs have .no representatives, and His Majesty's Government are represented only by a native agent of the Residency at Bushire, who is stationed at Shargah, on the Trucial Coast, and moves from place to place as required. 4. Responsibility for the political control of the States rested up to the end of the war with the Government of India. The Masterton-Smith Committee made no specific reference to them, but, on the general principle underlying the recommendations of that Committee, the affairs of the States would appear to continue to be primarily the concern of the Government of India, subject to the ultimate control of His Majesty's Government, save when they involve or touch on major questions of policy involving relations with Ibn Saud, or affecting the Arabian policy of His Majesty's Government. In that case they fall to be dealt with directly by His Majesty's Government through the Colonial Office. 5. Save in respect of the Residency Agent at Shargah, there appears to be no political expenditure in connection with the Sheikhs. No subsidies are or have been paid to any of their number, although the grant of a subsidy to the Sheikh of El Katr was considered and ultimately rejected in connection with the negotiation of the treatv concluded with him on the t Tel. from s. of -s. 3rd November 1916.f Sept. 9 1915, P.3296/15. II.—Internal History, 1908-28. 6. The internal history of the Trucial States in the last 20 years is of no general interest or importance, and it is unnecessary to recapitulate it here. The incident of most importance in the pre-war period was an undertaking by the Sheikhs not to give pearling or sponge fishing concessions, J save with + P- 2062 /11, the prior approval of His Majesty's Government. During the war the 1 • 12()3 / 12 - Sheikhs adopted a friendly attitude ; and, broadly speaking, they, have satisfactorily implemented their engagements to His Majesty's Government in matters such as the arms traffic and the slave trade. His Majesty's Government have consistently avoided entanglement in their internal affairs, 3091A 75 10.28 A9 and have confined themselves to recognising successions (too frequently, secured by assassination), subject to formal acceptance by the Sheikh affected of the treaty obligations undertaken by his predecessor.

In view of the importance of the oil question it should be placed on t* record that the Trucial Sheikhs of Shargah, Ras-al-Khaima, Dabai, Abu Dhabi, Ajman and Umm-al-Qaiwain agreed in 1922 not to grant a concession in the event of oil being fonnd in their territories, save with the permission of His Majesty's Government. No question of a concession has so far arisen. Considerable discussion has, however, taken place between the Sheikh of El Katr (who is precluded by Article 5 of his Treaty of 3rd December 1916 from granting any concession without the approval of His Majesty's Government), and various oil interests affected in regard to the grant of a concession in his territory; and an option for 18 months in which to negotiate for an oil concession was granted by him to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in March 1926.

III.—External Developments affecting- the Trucial Sheikhs, 1908-28. 8. The developments in relation to the Sheikhs of most importance during the period now in question have been external. They are— (a) The rise of Ibn Saud. (h) The recent reassertion of Persian authority in the Persian Gulf. Ibn Saud and the Trucial Sheikhs. 9. As will be seen from the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908, the Wahabi connection with the Trucial Coast is of long standing, although for many years prior to 1913 it had ceased to be of any political importance. But the conquest of Hasa by Ibn Saud in 1913 again brought the Wahabi movement directly in touch with the Trucial Sheikhs/*, To their territory, as to El Katr, Ibn Saud maintained a hereditary claim. He was, however, warned by the Political Resident of the special treaty relations between His Majesty's Government and the Trucial Sheikhs,t and he maintained an entirely correct attitude towards them during the following years. By the Treaty of 26th December 1915, Ibn Saud undertook to abstain from aggression on or interference with the Trucial Sheikhdoms, or with El Katr, j and that instrument formally governed his relations with the States until the conclusion of the Treaty of Jeddah in the spring of 1927. 10. No incident of importance appears to have arisen as between Ibn Saud and the Trucial States until after the European War. In 1921§ the Sheikh of El Katr represented that he was alarmed at the prospect of some of his townspeople becoming Akhwan and joining Ibn Saud, and asked whether Government would help him should he be attacked from the interior. He was informed in reply that Government were not prepared to promise more than diplomatic assistance should he be attacked by Ibn Saud. At the end of 1922 the Sheikh again rep resented || that, while he did not fear an open attack by Ibn Saud so long as the latter remained on good terms with His Majesty's Government, he w T as seriously alarmed by the more subtle methods employed, he alleged, by the Nejd authorities to make his position impossible. The Political Resident commented that he did not see any practicable means to prevent peaceful penetration of the country by the Akhwan and Ibn Sand's adherents. He suggested that a hint inight be given to Ibn Saud to keep his people in order. No action was taken on this proposal. Sir Percy Cox, then High Commissioner in Iraq, reporting^ that, on finding that Ibn Saud was apparently including the Katr Peninsula within the tract of country for which he was prepared to negotiate an oil concession, he had already very recently ' taken him to task, reminding him that he had nothing to do with Katr, except to respect it, under the termb of his treaty with us, and insisting on the limitation of his discussions to the country west of the longitude of Sal wall BajV His Highness accepted this injunction without argument.' The Sheikh has maintained his independence,@ 3 though, it transpired in the air reconnaissance of the Gulf in 1927 that he attaches creat importance to avoiding action which might be unpalatable to ise's, May 9 1927, the Wahabi King. e. and o. 7483. 11. The activity of the Wahabis again came prominently to notice in 1926. The Political Resident then reported** that of the Trncial Chiefs, aa ' the Sheikhs of Aba Dhabi and Dabai, together with a number of the tribes p U 2433/26.' under their suzerainty or adjoining their territory, were whole-heartedly opposed to Ibn Sand ; that the Sheikhs of Shargah and Ras-al-Kliaima were definitely supporters of the Wahabi King ; and that the Sheikhs of Ajman and Umin al Qaiwain were inclined to be neutral. In a number of instances the Wahabi Governor of Hasa, Ibn Jiluwi, appeared to have acted in an extremely high-handed manner in the Trucial Sheikhdoms, and the Political Resident was inclined to tbe view that he aimed at the absorption in Nejd of all Trucial Oman and ' Independent ' Oman (Jau), and at the establish ment of contact w T ith a large district of the Oman Sultanate which was opposed to the Imam and almost independent of the Sultan. 12. An element of doubt existed as to the extent to which, Ibn Saud was personally responsible for, or even cognisant of, the activities of the Governor of Hasa ; it was decided, after considerable discussion, that no action should be taten in the matter pending th.e conclusion of the new tt s. of s. for 1. to treaty then in negotiation with him ;tt and the assurances secured in that ^-f^ 8 ; treaty from the King were ultimately held to dispose of the matter. p. 2749. 13. The Government of India were strongly in favour of the inclusion in the treaty in question of an undertaking as regards the Trucial Chiefs substantially identical with, that embodied in the Treaty of 26th December 1915 (see para. 9 above). It proved impossible to secure Ibn Sand's r - 831 /27. agreement to this His Majesty's Government regarded the point as one g r ^^1°^ which it was undesirable to press too far, and m the result the King of the Jan.26 1927, para. 11, Hejaz and Nejd, in the treaty signed at Jeddah on 20th May 1927, undertook p. 494/27. merely 'to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with . . . the p. 3269/27 Sheikhs of Katr and the Oman coast who are in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government.' 14. The result of the reconnaissance undertaken in connection with the air route in the Persian Gulf along the north Arabian shore in the spring of 1927 was to show that the influence of Ibn Saud had increased in a very marked manner along the north Arabian littoral, and considerable difficulties were placed in the way of the reconnaissance on the grovmd, either expressed or implied, that political difficulties would be caused with the Wahabis and the Wahabi King by the landing of aeroplanes, &amp;c. (ep. Note on Air Communications in the Gull on p. |1|). So impressed was the Political Resident by the rise of the ahabi power and by the insecurity to which a chain of air stations along the Arab coast might be^ exposed by internal dissensions and the danger of Wahabi interlerence in the petty Sheikhdoms of the Trucial Coast, that in the spring of 1927 he suggested* that the long-established policy of abstention by His Majesty s Government April 30 and May 9 from all but naval commitments should now be discarded and .replaced by a 192 7, p. 3996. definite assumption of responsibility in the States concerned for the orderly succession of Sheikh to Sheikh, for his maintenance in power, and for the protection of his territories by land as well as by sea. 15 The Government of India gave careful and sympathetic consideration to the Resident's proposals. But the conclusion at which they finally arrived! L^T^Sept.?* was that, even though the guarantees of non-interference given by Dm Saud 1927, p. 4575/27. in the Treatv of Jeddah of 1927 fell considerably short of those which he had been prepared to accept in 1915, they conveyed to the King o^ the Hejaz a clear intimation, solemnly accepted by him, of the special position and of the interest in the Trucial Sheikhdoms of His Majesty's Government. Past history, in the view of the Government of India, justified them in relying for security against the danger of W ahabi encroachments on the treaty engagements into which Ibn Saud had entered with His Majesty s Government, and, while it was impossible to forecast the effect on Gulf politics of the death of Ibn Saud, they were not prepared, in these^circum stances, to make an immediate reversal of their policy in the Persian Gulf4 in anticipation of a state of affairs which might never arise. Should a more definite assertion be called for by subsequent developments, that assertion could be made and enforced on the basis of our existing political position and sea power.' As to the air ronte, they regarded its establishment nlong the Arab littoral, should a decision to this end be reached, as both possible and advisable without any alteration in ' our old and well-tried Gulf policy.'* They added that the mere presence of an aerodrome wonld, to some extent, afford a visible guarantee of British protection, but indicated that some subsidy to the Sheikhs in whose territories the aerodromes would lie or over whose territories the air route would pass would probably be necessary. The reassertion of Persian Authority in the Persian Gulf. 16. It is only in the last two years that Perbia has commenced to adopt an active policy in the Gulf. The result of the adoption of that policy has been to bring her into conflict on certain points with the Trucial Chiefs and their interests. The Trucial settlements on the south Persian coast, the occupation of Hen jam for so many years by Trucial Arabs, the Trucial ownership of the islands of Tamb, Little Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirri, the title to which of the Sheikhs of Shargah and Ras-al-Khaima is contested by Persia, have all afforded grounds of friction. 17. The three most important incidents which have arisen are the expulsion by Persia of the Sheikh of Hen jam in May 1928, the arrest in Jnly 1928 of a Trucial dhow plying between Dabai and Khassab, which raised the question of the status of Tamb, and—a direct consequence of the last-named incident—the questioning by Persia of the independence of the Trucial owners of Tamb. 18. The history of the expulsion of the Sheikh of Henjam is given in paras. 28 to 34 of the Memorandum on Henjam on page |||. The incident was one the disposal of which would, in all probability, have presented relatively little difficulty, had it been possible to localise it. But the Sheikh of Henjam is the father-in-law r of the Trucial Sheikh of Dabai; and he and his people are by race Jowasimi Arabs, who claim never to have accepted Persian nationality, and who maintain very close relations with their fellow * Pol. Res. to g . of i., tribesmen on the north Arabian shore.- As a result, disturbances in r Y tis . 1928 ' Henjam react immediately on feeling on the Trucial Coast, and in the present instance the effect of the expulsion of the Sheikh was, according to the Senior Naval Officer, so greatly to excite the Trucial Arabs that they had stated that were it not for ' the British action and our gunboats, they would come in thousands, seize Kishm Island and Henjam, and kill every t Tel. from Pol. Persian on the islands.''!* Representations in the strongest terms were June^2^1928f' made to tlie Residency Agent and the Political Resident, and Sir Lionel P- 3077. ' Haworth reported that he had been informed by the brother of the Sheikh of Dabai, whom he describes as one of the most level-headed and sensible chiefs on the Trucial Coast, that ' if we did nothing to help them, they were prepared to tear up our treaties, much as they liked them, have done with our air route and kill all Persian officials they could and massacre all Persians on the Arab coast.' 19. As will be seen from the Memorandum on Henjam, it was agreed, in the early stages of this incident, that the intervention of His Majesty 's v^overnment at Tehran on behalf of the Sheikh would do more harm than ivto good4 _The strength of feeling aroused on the Arab littoral, and the danger— p. 3176. emphasised by the Political Resident—that the Trucial Arabs might have recourse to Ibn Saud should His Majestv's Government, while failing themselves to intervene effectively on behalf of the Sheikh, refuse to allow 1928, p. 5116. the Sheikh of Dabai to approach the Persian Government regarding him, c.o.toi.o Sept. 27 liave S . inc ^ ho 7 ever ' ^ tl:ie Government of India to modify^ their 0 view. 1928, p. 5274. ~ Attention has also been drawn by the Colonial Office to the difficulties which would arise were the Trucial Arabs to become supporters of Ibn Saud, and while for the moment the return of the Sheikh to Henjam at the invitation of the Persian Government gives hope that a satisfactory solution of the incident may be found, reconsideration of the decision 'of His Majesty) Government not to intervene with Persia mav be called for should this J I.O. to F.O June 23 1928unfortunately prove not to be the case (cp. para. 39 of Memorandum on Henjam on page 0). The incident, and its reactions on the Trucial Coast, on which, as the Government of India remarked, 14 anti-Persian feeling is always a matter of concern to us, and any anti-Persian ebullition might lead to serious embarrassment,'- illustrate, in anv event, the difficulty of the * Tel. from viceroy situation s which action, however justified, by Persia may give rise, where mfrim 18 tne irucial Arabs are concerned. ' ' 20. The Tamb incident is dealt with in paras. 33 and 34 of the Memorandum on the Status of Tamb, &amp;c., on p. — It will be seen that it was with great difficulty that the Sheikhs affected by the Persian arrest of the dhow in question were restrained from undertaking reprisals against Persia; that the Persian claim to the islands of Tamb and Abu Musa which have been recognised by His Majesty's Government as Trucial territories, remains to be disposed of, and that the question of compensation to the bheikhs and to the owner of the dhow and his passengers is still unsettled. Persia and the independence of the Trucial Chiefs. 21. The newspaper Hahl-ul-Matin, which is understood to derive Tel. from Pol. inspiration from the highest quarters, so long ago as November 1927 Res - to S. ofs. included in a list of Persian desiderata the 'renewal of the Protectorate of 25 1928 ' Persia over Muscat and other small Sheikhs of the coast of Oman.' The first official indication of a Persian claim of this nature arose, however, in 'connection with the Tamb incident in August 1928, when the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs formally stated in a Note that u the Persian Government teh. tel. to f.o., -cannot recognise as independent and owner of the said islands ' the Sheikh p 31 1928 ' on whose behalf representations have been made by His Majesty's Government, and added that in consequence ' my Government cannot in any way approve the attitude that^ the British Government have adopted on the pretext of having treaties^ with the above-mentioned Sheikh, and cannot accept resulting ■declaration which you make of protecting him.' 22. The Note left room for doubt as to whether the Persian challenge of the independence of the Sheikh in question was directed to his status as regards Tamb and Abu Musa, to which a claim is preferred by Persia, or to his status as a Trucial Chief on the Arab Coast. The Charge d'Affaires -at Teheran was, however, instructed in reply to communicate officially the text of the Exclusive Agreement of 1892 with all the Trucial Chiefs, and to :state that His Majesty's Government entirely failed to understand the Persian statement, and could not admit direct dealings between the Chiefs and the Persian Government. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs added, ' You will realise that vis-a-vis of Foreign Powers, there is no •distinction for a purpose like the present between the Sheikh of Ras-al- Khaima and the other Trucial Chiefs, and effect of Persian Note is to s^t.l iS. challenge our right to protect any of them from external aggression . . the status of His Majesty's Government on the Arabian coast is not open to discussion, nor can they recognise any Persian claim on that side of the Gulf.' 23. A Persian reply, holding to the views expressed in their earlier Note Teh. tel. 278, and adding that ' all agreements made with Trucial Chiefs which harm or p 6 ^ 1 1928 ' limit the rights and interests of Persia cannot be recognised as valid or legally be cited as reason for measures against Persian Government' has since been received. The Political Resident reports, moreover, that the Governor of Bushire is alleged to have received instructions from Teheran Tel. from Pol. ites. that Persia recognises no Arab rulers on the Arab coast of the Gulf, and to s. of s. for 1., ^ that all persons belonging to and arriving from Katr and the Trucial Coast (as p.' 5093 Sept ' 17 1928 ' from Muscat, Koweit and Bahrein) are to be considered Persian subjects and Persian passports issued to them. It seems clear in the circumstances that the possibility of a formal claim by Persia to suzerainty on the Trucial Coast, whether based on her temporary control of portions of that coast in the early eighteenth century! or on intrigues such as that unsuccessfully undertaken + Lor - ^ Gn ' by the Sartip on her behalf in 1887,$ and subsequently repudiated by the Persian Government, cannot^ be ignored. The seriousness of the issues to t Lor - h 737. which such a claim would give rise, if pressed, needs no emphasis.6 V TV.—Summary. 24. The extension to the coast of the authority of Ibn Saud and the- influence of the Wahabi movement, the reassertion of Persian authority in the Persian Gulf, and the question of an Imperial air route along the north Arabian coast, have combined to invest the Trucial Sheikhdoms with a new importance. If the air route is to materialise ; if His JMajesty's Government,* in the light of the report of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee, remain of the opinion that the maintenance Of British influence in the Gulf is a matter of paramount importance, alike from the Imperial and frorn the Indian standpoint; and if they are no longer.to enjoy on the south Persian coast the privileged position which they have enjoyed in the past; then the consoli dation of their influence on the north Arabian shore is a matter of very much greater and more definite importance than at any earlier period. 25. If, however, that influence is to be maintained and consolidated, the fact that the Trucial Chiefs are guaranteed (even though to an extent difficult precisely to define) the protection of His Majesty's Government, and are forbidden to communicate with outside Powers or to receive their representatives, necessitates a clear understanding as to the extent to which His Majesty's Government are in a position and are prepared to defend their interests, whether against Persia or against Ibn Saud. 26. Of the two, Persia presents the less serious problem. Even should she seriously put forward claims to suzerainty on the Arab coast, she is not r as raattois stand, in a position to enforce them, nor could His Majesty's Government acquiesce in her pursuit of an active policy of aggression on the north Arabian coast, any more than in those Trucial islands in the Gulf which they have recognised as vested in the Trucial Chiefs, without resiling from the policy which they have hitherto consistently pursued. Moreover, the Trucial Sheikhs and their tribesmen are bound to Persia by ties neither of race nor of religion, while the north Arabian shore (as distinct from the Trucial islands, certain of which appear to contain valuable mineral deposits) offers no commercial or pecuniary reward to justify an active Persian interest. 27. Ibn Saud, and the Wahabi movement of which he is the representative,, constitute a much more serious problem. In the first place, in the words- of Sheikh Hamad of Bahrein, Ibn Saud is 44 the one big Arab ruler, and it is natural for all the smaller Arab Sheikhs . , . to look up to him and try to * Letter from p.a ., please him.'* Historically, he has claims of standing to a predominant Aprii e i4'i927 OLReS '' influence on the Trucial Coast, and. geographically his extension to that p. 3334/27. coast would, but for the presence of His Majesty's Government, be a natural process. The special tenets of the Wahabi creed are familiar to the Trucial tribesmen; certain at any rate of the Trucial Sheikhdoms are traditionally strongly Wahabi in outlook; while racially the Trucial Arabs and the Wahabis of the interior descend from common stocks. 28. It is clear that in these circumstances the problem of preventing the absorption of the Trucial Sheikhdoms by Ibn Saud or their gradual penetration by Wahabi influence is one of great difficulty, the more so m view of the known Wahabi sentiments of certain of the Trucial Sheikhs. The danger of possible military aggression by the King of the Hejaz and of Nejd may be discounted so long as his general relations with His Majesty s Government remain friendly, and the Government of India have already expressed the view (see para. 15 above) that they are justified, in the light of past history, in relying for security against the danger of Wahabi encroachments on the treaty engagements into which Ibn Saud has entered with His Majesty's Government. But while this is true of an aggressive military policy, it appears almost impossible for His Majesty's Government effectively to prevent the penetration by peaceful means of the Truciai States by Ibn Saud and his adherents— a process the more difficult to combat for the reasons given in the preceding paragraph. 29. As matters stand, the most that it appears possible for His Majesty s- Government usefully to do is to arrange for the showing of the flag by His Majesty's ships along the Trucial Coast, possibly to a greater extent even than at present; to construe in a strict sense the undertakings given by7 Ibn Sand in the Treaty of Jeddah of 1927 ; and to keep a close watch for action, whether prompted by Ibn Sand himself or the independent work of over-zealous lieutenants, which can be regarded as calling for remonstrance, in view of the terms of the treaty. The value of the constant reminder of British power which is given by a naval patrol cannot h,e exaggerated ; the importance of the support of His Majesty's ships to a ruler threatened by a fanatical hinterland has been illustrated in recent years, though in different circumstances, in Muscat. The establishment of an air route, should His Majesty's Government decide upon that course, will go someway towards the assertion on the north Arabian coast of the influence of His'Majesty's •Government. The payment of subsidies to the Chiefs, should that prove ultimately unavoidable, in connection with the establishment of air stations, may further be of value in consolidating British influence; the elimination • of British influence from the south Persian shore, and the possibility that Persia may question the retention of the Residency at Bushire, may lead to a reconsideration of political arrangements in the Gulf, one effect of which would be to fix the headquarters of the Resident on or near the Arabian littoral of the Gulf; but while for the moment the objections urged by the Government of India to the adoption of the policy of active intervention in the affairs of the Trucial Coast suggested by the Political Resident (para. 13 above) appear conclusive, the possibility that at some later stage consideration of that policy may be necessitated developments which cannot at present be foreseen, is one which must be faced. 30. To sum up. His Majesty's Government by their treaty engagements ■ control the foreign relations of the Trucial Chiefs, to whom, in addition, they have promised either directly or by implication a degree of protection which it is difficult precisely to define. Their written engagements to the Chiefs have been supplemented by utterances such as that made by Lor. i, 2638-9. Lord Curzon, when Viceroy of India, on his visit to the Gulf in 1903, an appeal to the terms of which has so recently as the summer of the present year' :i: ' been made by certain of the Chiefs affected. The * Tel. from s.n.o. original reason for contracting the engagements in question was the juiysoi^s^p 9 /^!?. suppression of piracy, the slave traffic and the arms traffic, and the preservation of the maritime peace of the Gulf. In the changed circumstances of the present day, those arguments for the maintenance of a predominant British influence are supplemented by the wider political considerations referred to in para. 21 above. But the change in the general situation which has made the maintenance of British influence on the Trucial Coast of greater general importance from the Indian and the Imperial point of view is accompanied by the probable necessity of facing wider liabilities, or of interpreting in a more generous or a more binding manner the obligations of His Majesty's Government for the defence of the interests of the Sheikhs protected. V.—Points referred to in connection with Deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. 31. The following points have been specifically referred to in connection with the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee :— (а) On the Arabian coast Koweit and the so-called Trucial Chiefs are continually threatened by Ibn Saud. Is the maintenance of their independence necessary for British purposes, and, if so, how is it to be secured? (P.G. 3 VIII.) (б) Policy of His Majesty's Government vis-d-vis Ibn Saud, with particular reference to . . . Trucial Chiefs and air route. (P.G. 6, 2 (c), 1.) .(c) Policy of His Majesty's Government towards the Trucial Chiefs (compare Colonel Haworth's proposal for a greater degree of interference and support, with a view to securing that they shall not be absorbed by Ibn Saud). (P.G. 6, 2 (c) 2.) {d) Steps necessary on the north Arabian coast in connection with slavery (and arms traffic). (P.G. 6, 2 (c), 3.)8 VI.—Views of the Government of India. 32. The Government of India are definitely of opinion that the alienation of the Arab Protectorates would be highly impolitic from the point of view + Tel. from Viceroy, of His Majesty's Government,! and, in connection with the deliberations 1782 s, Sept. 4 1928! 0 f ^ Persian Gulf Sub-Committee, have expressed the viewj that the.. 5p 7 !f' maintenance of the independence of the Sheikhdoms (absorption of whicH by Ibn Sand or his ' successor might easily lead to a speedy relapse of tlie Gulf into the chaos from which it has been rescued^ with so much difficulty) j is essential. Here, as in the case of Bahrein, Jioweit and Muscat, they i consider that so long as Arab opinion is not alienated by an attempt at undue Westernisation, our present veiled protectorate suffices not only against European encroachment, but against the encroachments of the Wahabi State. That protectorate can, they remark, at need be more explicitly asserted. J.G.L India Office, 4th October 1928.© CONFIDENTIAL. INDIA OFFICE Position and Rights of His Majesty's Government in Basidu. Introductory. 1. Basidu is situated on the westernmost point of the island of Kislnn, which is separated from the south Persian coast, to which it runs parallel,' by Glaieuce Strait. It lies about 25 miles Jl . by of Xjin^ah town on that coast. It has a reasonably good anchorage for vessels of moderate draught, about a quarter of a mile from the shore. The place is one of the healthiest Lor ii 207 near the entrance to the Gulf; while the island of Kishm, on which it is situated, was described in 1902 by Rear-Admiral Bosanquet as 'in my opinion the most important strategical position in the Persian Gulf from a naval point of view . . For landing purposes there was stated in 1906 to be a jetty extending to low-water mark. Iliere is a cemetery containing Indian Navy graves, which is maintained in good order and the upkeep of which is a point which will call for consideration should the concession revert to Persia. Extent of the British Concession. The extent of the British concession in Basidu was the subject of investigation in 1901. Difficulty was experienced in defining its limits but G - of L Pr ® ci8 of the Government of India after examination of the reports of the Political ZnjZ. Kesident and the available records, expressed the view that ' whatever may T &gt; - 376 / 27 ' pp- 77 - 8 - have been the original limits of the tract granted to the British Government Lor -^ 372 - in 1820, as to wbich there appears to be no information readily available, they are debarred from asserting a claim over Old Bassidore [a village in close proximity to the old Portuguese fort which once existed upon the north-west extremity of the island of Kishm, and which, with the village of Bandar Singau, situated also in close proximity to the Portuguese fort, was formerly regarded as within the limits of the British station] by the prescription of many years. The site of the abandoned settlement at Smgow may, however, be regarded as included within the limits of the British Station.' Status of Basidu. 3. The British concession in Kishm was obtained in 1820 by a written grant from the Imam of Muscat, in whom effective control of the island was then vested. Tbe international and legal position of that concession turns on whether this grant was made by the Imam as sovereign of Kishm, and so of Basidu, or as tenant of Kishm from Persia. 4. l^rom the records in the possession of the Government of India it would appear that from the middle of the 18th century until about 1800 Kishm was farmed by Arab tribes from the Persian sovereign, to whom they paid tribute ; that at the beginning of the last century the islands and Bunder Abbas came under the control of the Imam of Muscat, who, however, continued to pay rent to Persia in respect of them ; th^t the officers of the Imam were, however, reported in 1821 to have stated that neither Kishm, Orrnuz nor Larak were specified on the receipts annually granted bv the Persian Government for the stipulated sum paid ; and that the Muscat Government claimed at the same period that the islands in question belonged exclusively to them. 5. In 1799-1801 endeavours were made by His Majesty's Government to Precis,p. 35, p. 37(18), secure a lease of the island of Kishm from Persia, whose sovereignty was P- 4 3iv(2). not apparently at the time regarded as doubtful. The active^ British association with the island, which, as stated above, dates from 1820, originated in the tiansfer to it 111 that year of ihe British military detachment previously stationed at Ras-al-Khaima. Ihe British settlement on Kishm took place with the consent of the Imam of Muscat, who, in his letter on the r^cis p 34 subject to the Government of Bombay, remarked of Kishm that 'The island in question and all other territories appertaining to me and subject to my authority appertain also to the Honourable Company, and I do not 3099 75 10.28 *p. 42. # Sir H. Willocks' Desp., May 10 1820, p, 35. Persian Note of Dec. 9 1820, p. 36 (16). p. 49 (3). p. 52. pp. 15, 59. p. 4. Pol. Res. to G. of I., Aug. 14 1926, P. 3847/26. t Aitchison, xii, Ixi, article 6. Lor. i, 2106. Precis, pp. 14, 16. p. 18. reckon those dominions as appertaining to me but as appertaining to the Honourable Company.' The Imam simultaneously instructed the Sheikh of Kishm to give every assistance in the embarkation and conveyance of the troops. Various places were occupied in the island for the purpose in question, before a decision was finally taken in favour of Basidu in 1822. 6. An immediate protest in strong terms was received from the Persiau Government against the British occupation of Kishm, and a reference to the lease granted by the Imam was met by a statement that Muscat was itself a dependency of Persia, and a fortiori Kishm and Henjam, which depended from Bunder Abbas * Sooner than risk a rupture of friendly relations with Persia, it was decided to remove the British detachment from the town of Kishm. This was done in February 1822, but the Government of Bombay, in their letter repudiating the unauthorised agreement which had been entered into by Captain Bruce with the Prince Governor of Fars, which had inter alia recognised Persian sovereignty in Kishm, made it clear to the Persian Government that their action was without prejudice to the decision on the question of the respective rights in the island of the Imam of Muscat, and of Persia, and that the island would be restored b^ His Majesty's Government to the Imam, from whom they had leased it. As, however, no equally convenient naval station could be found in the Gulf, Basidu was again occupied in 1823, from which year until 1879 it remained the head quarters of the naval squadron in the Gulf. No protest appears at the time to have been made by Persia against its re occupation, since the date of which the British flag has flown in the concession. 7. In '1853 the Persian Government expelled the Muscat representative from Bunder Abbas and its dependencies (including apparently Kishm), and the agreement finally reached between Persia and Muscat in 1856 involved not only the payment of an increased rent to Persia by the Sultan of Muscat, but the recognition as Persian territory ' of the two islands of Or muz and Kishm, which had been dependencies of Oman.' _ During the Anglo-Persian ar of 1855 Basidu was constantly used as a British depot, but neither in 1853, 1856, 1864 (when the British occupation was confirmed under Article 6 of the Telegraph Agreement with Sultan Thoweymee of Muscat,'j' then lessee of the island from Persia), on the renewal of the Persian lease to Muscat in 1868, or on the forcible termination of that lease in the same year by Persia, was any exception taken by Persia to the British occupation. 9. 1 he legal position of Basidu, which had been raised in 1863 by a claim from the 1 ersian authorities, which would appear to have been rejected, for the suirender of a slave who had taken refuge in the concession, was again raised by a similar demand in the spring of 1868, and by a murder committed in the same year in the Naval Station. 10. The question was exhaustively considered by the Government of i! ? as - a resu .^' 0I1 .

It is perfectly true that we have occupied pasmu either as a naval or coaling station for half a century. But the island has always been treated by us as a dependency of Bunder Abbas; and d under Abbas and its dependencies, including the island of Kishm, and consequently Basidu, have been leased to the Sultan of Muscat by the Shah o ersia u^der circumstances with which the Government of Bombay is perfectly familiar. .

There may be some obscurity as to the exact nature of our derivative title to the town of Basidu, and it may have been thought that our rights over the town existed by continued usage, or that we had obtained a prescriptive title; but, in looking-closely into the question, it becomes evident that our rights are subordinate to those of Muscat, which again are, admittedly, entirely subordinate to those of Persia, and have© For. Pol., Oct. 28 1875. Lor. i. 2107-8. been always so treated up to this very hour.' The Government of India, in adding that arrangements should be made to establish a local jurisdiction for petty criminal cases, remarked, 'The official holding the trial at Basidu would, in the eye of the law, be merely using the delegated authority of Persia and Muscat.' H 11. The opinion as to the status of Basidu expressed in 1868 by the e | | Government of India, and quoted in the preceding paragraph, has since held jji the field, and was maintained by them in 1875 in connection with the # India letter 208 proposed Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council.' :ii ki 12. In 1878 the Political Resident in the Gulf urged that the grant of 4 1820 by the Sultan of Muscat and its renewal by his successor in 1864, ^ taken with such prescriptive right as an undistributed possession of nearly \i -60 years may be held to confer, constitute our title to possession ...

The surrender to Persia of the British concession at Basidu, in return m for a corresponding concession at Henjam, and the transfer of the naval m station in the Gulf to the latter island, was considered in 1866-8, but was not ^ 20 _ 2 iol pursued. In 1878 the infantry detachment which bad been maintained in the Lor. i, 2108-9. •concession for the protection of the coal depot was reduced from a company t l to a havildar guard, which was itself withdrawn in 1883. No detachment I has since then been stationed at Basidu. In the same year the subordinate J non-European staff were withdrawn, and the station placed in charge of a coal agent under the ultimate control of the Bushire Residency. Some 1 concern was caused in 1899 by rumours of designs on Kishm by Russia, which, however, proved unfounded, and in 1901 the Government of India p- 7g - instructed! the Political Resident that ' no official of the Persian Government Res ■ , g3 can be permitted to reside in any part of the station at Basidu without the u 7 jj -express consent of the British Government.' p. 78. 14. The question of reasserting British claims at Basidu in connection with the extension of British influence in the Gulf was considered, and a decision in favour of action to this end taken, b}^ an inter-Departmental conference in 1902, but, probably consequent on the decision of His Majesty's Government in 1903-4 that Henjam offered greater advantages as a site p- 66 - for a telegraph station, no action appears to have resulted. A further recommendation as to the consolidation of the British position at the •entrance to the Persian Gulf, including Kishm, was made at an inter- Departmental conference in connection with the Baghdad Railway in 1907, but again apparently without result. 15. In 1905 a request by the Moin-ut-Tujjar for permission to store red p- 80 - ochre in the British concession was refused, and in the same year the coal agent was instructed by the Resident to w T ara a Persian Customs officer who had interfered in the territory of the concession that 'he has no business in British territory, and if he persists he should not be allowed to p. 83. come within British territory.' 16. No fresh consignment of coal was landed after 1911; the coaling station was unobtrusively transferred to Henjam in 1913 ; a proposal to abandon the concession, on grounds of economy, was dropped, apparently for ** p . 4431/23. political reasons, in 1923. i:&gt; ' ::: ' Since 1913 the concession has been maintained § p- 376 /27. on political grounds only, its cost from the 1st April 1927 having fallen on li Tel. from viceroy, Indian political funds.§ A nominal coal depot and the coal agent are, p 68 ^'.

Oct. 151926, p.3629. a com pl a i n t received about this time from Persia of the refusal of the- British Agent at Basidu to pay customs dues, remarked that in view of the effect on the status of Hen jam of admitting the Persian claim to Basidu, ' it would be dangerous to allow doubt to be cast on the validity of the British rights to Basidu, which rest on undisturbed occupation over a long m6 0 p 0 3847 Nov ' 6 period.'! The report of the Government of India reaffirmed the view expressed by their predecessors in 1868 (para. 11 above) as to the status of Basidu, and added that the station was maintained solely for political reasons and as a bargaining counter in negotiations for the recognition of + g . of i. to lo ., tf 16 British position in Henjam or for some other consideration.J They Jan. 61927, ' regarded it as essential that neither Basidu, after relinquishment, nor any p. 376/27. other fuelling station in the Gulf should be leased by Persia to any other Power. 19. An amicable settlement of the Persian complaint referred to in para. 18 was reached§ and it proved possible to avoid any formal discussion i927 0 p t . 0 6 I 7/ G 27. an ' 4 of the general question with Persia. 20.

The possibility of an arrangement with Persia in respect of Henjam on the basis of surrender of Basidu was touched on in unofficial discussion between Sir L. Haworth and the Belgian Director-General of Teh. Deep. 455, Customs in September 1927, and was well received ; but the matter was not Sept. 211927, pursued. P. 4969/27. ^ I ncident of A ugust— S eptember 1928. 22. There were no further developments till August 1928, when tk Senior Naval Officer in the Gulf reported that the Persian Customs official in Persian Basidu. who had previously told the British caretaker that 1 'ersm Senior Naval Officer f 1 ' 00 ? 8 would occupy British Basidu in a few weeks, claimed the right, under toTdm, n a 36/i2 C r instructions from Bundar Abbas, to collect taxes in British Basidu, in which, ilsn 1928 ' ke said, the British flag had no more significance than a consular flag. ^ 23. The Political Resident requested the Senior Naval Officer to keep a] ship off Basidu, and, should Persia attempt to occupy the concession, state that this could not be permitted without the orders of His Majesty's Government. The Government of India, who were seriously disturbed V the Persian threat, which was closely followed by an attempt by the Persian Customs Mudir, which was prevented by the Captain of H.M.S. Lupin, to arrest a man within the concession, urged that His Majesty's Government should either— (a) warn Persia that any molestation of British Basidu would be regarded as an unfriendly act ; or (h) send a small landing party to remain in Basidu until the situation cleared. 24. The foreign Office saw objection to the first alternative, which they thought likely to provoke, a definite challenge by Persia, as did the Charge d Affaires, leheran. As legards the second, they were not prepared to take any action which might lead to an incident at Basidu, and so could not agree to the landing of a party save with orders to withdraw under protest if challenged. To action on these lines the Admiralty, with whom the India Office agreed, saw strong objection. The India Office suggested in the circumstances reversion to action on the lines taken by Sir L. Haworth as described in para. 23 above.25. The situation was changed by information that the Persian Director Tel. m Pol. Res. [ of Customs at Bandar Abbas, who (he alleged on orders from Tehran) t sii^Sept 0 12'' S refused to recognise the British flag in Basidu. was intending to proceed p. 4954. thither with a gunboat on 11th September to make an arrest. The Charge J d 'Att 'aires at Tehran was immediately instructed to make representations to Sepfc- ^ ect { ,he Central Customs authorities, and, if necessary, to warn the Persian i Government that any molestation of British Basidu, ' which has been vieij British station for 100 years, would be a complete negation of Minister ; of Court's promise to Sir R. Clive.' The Senior Naval Officer was simultaneously instructed that, as the landing of armed Persians in Basidu Adm. to s.n.o., would be an infringement of the agreement entered into with the Persian P- 4941 - Oovernment, it should, as a last resort, be resisted by force, and that, while conflict with the Persians was to be avoided if possible, protection was to be afforded to British subjects at Basidu, and the British flag was not to be hauled down. The Senior Naval Officer was instructed, however, that, if the man required by the Persians was not a British subject, and the reason for his arrest in British Basidu appeared sufficient, he should himself take steps to arrest him and hand him over to the Persians. 26. It transpired that the individual whom the Persian Government desired to arrest was the British caretaker, Hussein (whose nationality, it may be remarked, is not clear). The naval precautions taken, coupled Pol. Res. to s. of s. with the representations made at Tehran, secured, however, the desired gept^e,' rs W. result. The Customs official arrived at Basidu on the 19th September, and informed the Commanding Officer of the Cyclamen that he had orders that since the agreement with Persia of 10th May 1928 (i.e. the conclusion of the first stage of the general negotiations, in the course of which, however, no reference was made to Basidu), Basidu had ceased to be British. The Commanding Officer replied that the status of British Basidu was to be considered in the autumn, and that till then no Persian armed forces would be permitted to enter the area. The Customs official appears to have accepted the situation, and agreed that there should be no attempt at Customs interference, landing of troops or making of arrests. The Charge d'Affaires at Tehran was about the same time informed by the Teh. tel. to p.o., Administrator-General of Customs that the Belgian Director had issued p 7 509i pt ' 15 1928, formal instructions to subordinate posts that they were to avoid sending armed vessels with armed landing parties to any of the islands, while the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, who expressed entire ignorance of the matter, agreed that u nothing will be done in regard to islands in Gulf to change status quo pending result of Customs conversations this autumn.' There have been no subsequent developments ; but the naval precautions taken by His Majesty's ships at Basidu are being maintained. Summary. 27. The legal position in regard to Basidu is concisely set out in para. 10 above. The station cannot be regarded as British territory, and an absolute claim to the concession, in the face of a desire on the part of Persia to resume it, cannot be maintained by His Majesty's Government. On the other hand, His Majesty's Government have occupied the concession without protest for over a century (1822-1928), and, while they cannot be held by mere occupation to have acquired sovereign rights, undisturbed and unquestioned possession for so long a period would ordinarily be regarded as giving a very strong prescriptive right to continue occupancy on the terras on which the occupation had hitherto proceeded. 28. The station at Basidu has for the last few years been retained to a small extent because of its possible value to the Admiralty for coaling purposes, but primarily for political reasons, and with the object of using it as a pawn in negotiations with Persia, whether of a general character, or immediately directed to the consolidation of the position in Henjam of His Majesty's Government. The abrupt revival of the Persian claim makes it unlikely, however, that this counter will prove as valuable to His Majesty's Government for bargaining purposes as was at one time hoped. 3099 B6 Points referred to the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. 29. Reference has been made to the following points in connection with, the deliberations of the Sub-Committee :— (а) The position of His Majesty's Government in Basidu and Kishm (P.GL 6, 2 (a) 5). (б) Whether the coaling depots in Kishm [i.e. Basidn] and Hen jam canV without disadvantage be moved to Bahrein (conclusions of first meeting of Sub-Committee). Views of the Government of India. 30. The Government of India consider that as the rights in Basidu of His Majesty's Government derive from the Imam of Muscat in his capacity as tenant under Persia, their derivation can hardly be claimed by itself to Tel. from viceroy, substantiate British ownership. But the unchallenged occupation of Basidu pTssjf 1928, ^ ias k^ted over a century, and while materially the station is now of little or no use, politically ' it is obviously a valuable counter, for possession unchallenged for a whole century is not easily shaken/' Whatever its future, however, ' we shall have to stipulate that our Indian Kavy cemetery and British graves there are properly preserved.' Tel. from viceroy, To the moving of the coal depot (which, as explained in para. 16, has had July 231928, a nominal existence only since 1912) they see no 'prima facie objection. I ndia O ffice, 1st October 1928. J. G. L.(§) CONFIDENTIAL. INDIA OFFICE HENJAM. Position and Rights of His Majesty's GoYernment in the Island of Henjam. The Sheikh of Henjam and his Affairs. Introductory. Henjam is an island ^ miles long and about 3 miles broad, situated off -the south coast of the island of Kishm, from which it is divided by a strait Lor. ii, 629-31. a mile wide and 6-12 fathoms deep in the fairway. It contains a valuable anchorage at Masheh Bay, while at the settlement of Ghail, some 3 miles from the village of Henjam, there is an almost inexhaustible supply of fresh water. The island in addition contains saltmines of some value. Its position off the Persian coast at a point where the Persian Gulf is so narrow that the Arabian coast is ordinarily visible gives it considerable strategic importance. 2. Since 1869 (with an interval between 1881 and 1904) a station of the Indo-European Telegraph Company has been maintained on Henjam with the concurrence of the Persian Government; since 1911, when the Admiralty coaling depot was transferred to it from Basidu, the island has been employed by His Majesty's ships stationed in the Gulf as their g. of 1. precis of principal base, and a canteen and playgrounds are maintained in the corres - on Henjam Telegraph Concession by the Naval authorities. The climate of Henjam is, and Basidu ' p ' 65 ' however, extremely trying in the summer, and the view was expressed in * T s eL from viceroy 1903 that it would not be a suitable site for a defended naval establishment.^ Aug. 4 igb ^Lor. ii 3. The island, the only place of importance on which is the village of Henjam, an Arab settlement dependent principally on pearl fishing, is inhabited by Arabs belonging to the Beni Yas tribe of the Arabian coast. The Beni Yas are said to have migrated to it from the Arabian coast about a century ago,']' with the permission of the Sultan of Muscat, at a time when tP. 46i/06. Henjam was definitely claimed and administered by that State. They are reported consistently to have refused to acknowledge Persian sovereignty or to accept Persian nationality, and to have made it clear that they would rather leave Henjam than become Persian subjects. They have inter married throughout with the Beni Yas of the Arabian coast; their Lr. from Pol. Res. commercial dealings and their pearling ventures are all connected with juiy^a-i'S S '' that tribe ; their Sheikh is the father-in-law of the Trucial Sheikh of Dabai, R 4626 - and the ruling family of Dabai and their subjects claim to have 3J lakhs of rupees sunk in the concerns of the Henjam branch of their tribe. 4. A Persian Customs agent has been maintained in the island since 1905, and a Customs post was established in the area of the Indo-European Telegraph Department's concession, with the knowledge and approval of His Majesty's Government, in 1927. There is also a Persian Post Office alongside the Customs House, the difficulties caused by the anti-British activities of the postmaster of which have come to notice on various occasions recently, and have formed the subject of representations at Teheran.J j Teh. tel. to f.o., 213, July 6 1928, ' International Status of Henjam. p. 3501/28. 5. The international status of Henjam has formed the subject of considerable discussion in the past, claims being preferred to it by Muscat and by the Trucial Sheikh of Dabai (subject, however, to the overriding claim of Muscat§) as well as by Persia. The Persian claim is based on § Teh. Desp. 54, the assertion that Henjam is and always has been a Persian possession, Fel0 - 27 1906 dependent from Bunder Abbas, and that such authority as was exercised in ^ 2827/06 - it in the first half of the last century by Muscat was exercised by that State under its lease from Persia of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies.

Careful examination of the available evidence suggests that the claims of Muscat are substantial.^ But despite the representations in favour of Muscat of the then Political Resident, Persian sovereignty was formally recognised in 1868 by His Majesty's Government and the Government of India; in the year 1904 His Majesty's Government further informed the Persian Government that ' there was no intention ... to support anv such claim [to sovereignty] on the part of the Sheikh of Dabai, or to repudiate the authority of the Persian Government over Henjam ' ; and their recognition of Persian suzerainty has been reiterated on various occasions since that date, and particularly in the last two years.f In the circumstances, while the Muscat claim has never been abandoned, it seems impracticable for His Majesty s Government, in view of their consistent recognition of Persian sovereignty over the last 60 years, to take any action at this stage to challenge the position of Persia. The British Telegraph Concession at Henjam. 7.^ The basis of the position in Henjam of His Majesty's Government is the Telegraph Concession secured from the Persian Government in 1868. Prior to that date the occupation of Henjam (with the approval of the Precis,pp. 34, 35,37. Imam of Muscat, under whose effective control the island then was) had been considered in 1820 in connection with the removal to the south Persian coast of the British military detachment stationed on the Arabian coast at Ras-al-Khaima; but, as in the case of Basidu (cp. Memorandum on p. para. ®), an emphatic repudiation of the power of Muscat, 'itself a dependency of Persia, to grant concessions in Henjam and Kishm, 'which are dependencies of Bandar Abbas,' was received from Persia and the matter was not pursued. 8. There appear to have been no developments of importance until 1865. In that year the transfer to the island of the telegraph station maintained on Cape Musandim on the Arabian coast was proposed by the Indian Lelegraph authorities. After considerable discussion as to the rival claims to suzerainty of Persia and Muscat, it was decided in 1868 that Persia was the only Power which could object to the establishment of the station on the island, and it was agreed that a formal request for permission for its erect ion should be made to the Persian Government by His Majesty's Minister in Teheran.

Ihe necessary sanction was granted by the Shah on 29th March 1808, Subject to a proviso that ' the number of employees and the extent, of the buildings should not at any time be allowed to exceed those explained in the Memorandnm received from the British Legation.' The exact scope of the concession, and the area within which it was to operate, having subsequently lormed the subject of considerable controversy with Persia, it may be placed on record that the Memorandum in question stipulated for a staii or 15 Europeans, to include a Telegraph Superintendent and his assistant, an apothecary, and a storekeeper; and for a telegraph office containing instrument _ room, battery rooms. Superintendent's office, verandah, &amp;c. ; a dvyellmg house for the Superintendent and his assistant; a barrack for 10 or 1l clerks, a house for apothecary and medical stores ; a large shed for telegraph stores and material; a house for the storekeeper, and a shed for inferior material and coal store for the telegraph steamer when cruising, together with sundry out-offices for cooking houses, native servants, stables, &amp;c. The cable appears to have been landed at Henjam towards the end of December 1868 and a telegraph station to have been opened shortly after. 10. The telegraph station was maintained from 1868-9 to 1881, when its abandonment was approved. Proposals for the transfer to Henjam of t re naval coal depot at Basidu and the acquisition of the island from Persia in exchange for Basidu were considered in 1865-6, 1872 and 1880.@ 3 They were abandoned in 1866 and 1872 owing to the disputed sovereignt}' Lr. from Poi, Res. of the island, and were finally dropped in 1880 in view of the decision to iguj p f 1305/11 28 close down the telegraph station. No formal notification of the abandonment Precis, p. 29. of the station in 1881 appears to have been made to Persia.' :i: * * g. of 1. Desp. 56, .... to s. of s. for 1, 11. The possibilities afforded by Henjam were next brought to notice in Ma y7 1903. 1901,t in connection with the discussions then engaging His Majesty's g ^ g f J; D r es ^ 0 2 Government and the Government of India, on the question of naval bases, ^ S for L ' Ma y 2 and of the consolidation of the British position in the Gulf. In 1903 the Government of Indiaf recommended the reoccupation of the telegraph 56 ' Ma 7 7 station, which, they pointed out, had never been formally resumed by Persia, and the linking through it of Bandar Abbas with the Persian Gulf telegraphs—a question of some strategical importance. 12. After further investigation of the rival claims of Basidu, the Government of India's proposal was approved by His Majesty's Government early in 1904. Considerable discussion took place on the question of the communication, if any, to be made on the subject to Persia. It was finally decided to inform Persia of the intention to re-establish the telegraph station, and to ask for permission to extend the cable to Bandar Abbas§ ; lor Lto^ceroy, 8 ' and, action on these lines having been taken, the site of the former Mar - s 1904 concession was reoccupied in April 1904, in advance of the conclusion, in March 1905, || of a formal agreement with Persia. It may be noted that ll Precis 'PP- 67 » 68 - 9 - the agreement, when concluded, provided for the establishment by Persia of a Persian telegraph office on the island. 13. In July 1904 an unfounded report of the removal by the British telegraph authorities of the Persian flag at Henjam led to a protest by Persia, in replying to which His Majesty's Minister explicitly stated that Teh. Desp. 123, 'His Majesty's Government has never denied the sovereignty of Persia over 2 1904, p. 3005. Henjam, as is shown by the fact that our occupation is derived by the concession granted to us by His Majesty the ]ate Shah.'^]' i904 Ote 68 ' July 2 14. The re establishment of the station roused Persian suspicions of the intentions of His Majesty's Government. Flagstaffs were erected, and in November 1904 a customs official was appointed to the island and a customs post established by him within the limits of the concession. A lengthy p - 3246/05 - controversy took^ place as to the precise boundaries of the Telegraph Concession (Persia maintaining-- that the Firman of 1868, referred to in ^ para. 9 above, granted accommodation only and not land), in the course of P- 3701/05. which His Majesty's Government intimated that the fact of former occupation from 1869-81 was regarded by them as equivalent to a formal concession of Tel. from s. of s. to the land then held. The dispute on this point, after an offer by His Majesty's Vicero y' Jan - 91906 - Government to apply if necessary for a formal concession of the land on the aoO^nel?' t0 previous understanding that the request would be favourably entertained, i^ii, p! 1305/11. was finally dropped on the question of the precise area of the land which was to be considered as having been alienated by Persia. The Persian Government explained that their difficulty in coming to a settlement arose to some extent from a fear for a demand for corresponding concessions in the north from Russia. 15. The effect on the local Arabs of the reassertion of Persian authority, and the serious difficulties which have arisen since 1904 owing to the Arab attitude towards Persian claims to sovereignty, are dealt with separately in the Note on the Sheikh of Henjam and his affairs in paras. 25 to 34 below. 16. From 1911 the Naval authorities and the Telegraph Concession used Henjam as their chief base in the Gulf, and in 1912 the naval coaling station was removed to it from Basidu (in which, however, a nominal depot was retained), depcts being built within the area of the telegraph station. With a short interval in 1915, it has been maintained since that date.ft A coaling tt Tel. from g . of 1. pier was completed in 1921.No communication appears to have been made 31 to Persia regarding the establishment of the coal depot, and it was agreed p. 406/23, that, should the matter be raised by her, the depot should be represented as Tel. from s. of s. having been established in connection with the suppression of the arms Aprii 6 0 i9i2 e p 0 11244 Teh.

Up to 1926 naval stores ' in transit ' to His Majesty's ships and for use in the concession had been landed at Henjam without payment of customs dues and without reference to the Persian customs. A claim for payment of duty was for the first time made by Persia in^May 1926 ; and in October of the same year His Majesty's Minister decided that customs, monopoly, and road tax must be admitted. The duties in question have apparently been levied since that date.

In July 1926 enquiry by the Persian Government as to the rights of property of His Majesty's Government in Basidu and Henjam led to a re-examination of the position of His Majesty's Government in those stations. 1926'p 36% 0ct ' 15 The Admiralty urged the desirability of retaining the Henjam concession and regularising the position in respect of it. Not only was the retention of the coal depot essential, since three out of the four vessels employed in the Gulf were still coal-burning, but the station offered the only recreational Lr.from G-. of I., Jan. facilities in the Gulf for men of the squadron. The Government of India, in expressing agreement with the views of the Admiralty, referred to the strategical importance of a coaling station at the mouth of the Gulf. An endeavour to conclude an arrangement with Persia on the basis of surrender of the British position in Basidu in return for consolidation of that in Henjam was in contemplation, but the Minister at Teheran having reported that in the present state of Persian opinion 'it would be impossible to obtain perpetual lease of Henjam in return for BasiduJ ' ; and it having proved possible to avoid further discussion of the general question with Persia, the matter dropped for the time being. 20. During 1927 there arose difficulty with Persia (to which suspicions of the responsibility of His Majesty's Government for the activities of the Sheikh of Henjam—see para. 28 below—contributed) as the result of the erection within the limits of the concession of a house for the Persian postmaster without prior reference to His Majesty's Government, and again in connection with the expulsion of a Persian nakhuda who had without permission built a hut within the concession. An amicable settlement of both incidents were secured, and both the Minister and the Political Resident made it clear to the Belgian customs officials that His Majesty's Government had no claim to or designs on the island, and wanted no more than the control of the concession for sanitary reasons. The customs officials reacted favourably to a suggestion that Basidu might be surrendered in return for consolidation of the position at Henjam, but the matter was not pursued. A site for a new Customs House within the limits of the British concession was agreed with the British authorities. 21.

In September 1928 the Admiralty reported that a number of Persian troops had arrived in Henjam, 15 of whom had crossed into the British F.o. tel.to Teh., 196, concession, and the Charge d'Affaires at Teheran was instructed that Sept. 19 1928, semi-official action for their removal should be taken on the ground of the inconvenience caused by them, and of the fact that while Persia's right to send troops into the concession in case of need was not disputed, no real necessity existed in the present instance. 6 1927, P. 376/27. t Tel. to p.o., 259, Dec. 28 1926, p. 67/27.

The incidents at Tamb and Basidu in the summer of 1928 necessitated consideration of the action to be taken at Hen jam in the event of Persian aggression under the Telegraph Concession there; and in September 1928 the Admiralty suggested that the Senior Naval Officer Adm. to f.o., should be authorised to take action on the lines approved in the case of Sept. is ms'. Basidu (compare page ^ , -para. 25). The Foreign Office, however, Sept. ^1928 expressed the view that, having regard to the weakness of the British R 521 o/28. position at Henjam, and to the desirability of regularising that position, in agreement with Persia, and of securing the maintenance of the use of the concession as a naval depot and recreation ground, for which Persian permission had never been obtained, the Senior Naval Officer should be instructed that conflict with the Persian authorities in the island, military •or civil, should be avoided in all circumstances save in a grave emergency when British lives and property are in danger, and that even then force should be used only in the last resort. Henjam Wireless Station. 24. The history of the wireless station established at Henjam in 1916, the present importance of that station, and the threat to its continued maintenance constituted by the Persian prohibition of the import of spare parts, is dealt with in the Memorandum on Wireless in the Gulf on page |||. Relations between the Sheikh of Henjam and Persia: 1904-28. 25. The Arab Sheikh of Henjam, now over 80 years of age, is the direct descendant of the Arab leader to whom permission to occupy Henjam was granted by the Sultan of Muscat about 1826. He is the hereditary ruler of the Arabs of the Beni Yas tribe who inhabit the island ; he claims, as do his people, never to have acquiesced in Persian claims to sovereignty . over Henjam or to have acquired Persian nationality, and so recently as 1927 he informed the Officer Commanding H.M.S. Lupin that he regarded action in Henjam by the Persian customs authorities against his property as a violation u of his rights, as he considered himself a subject of the Sultan of Muscat.The general attitude of the Sheikh and his subjects on the * Report from question of Persian nationality, and their close relations with the Trucial Sheikhdoms of the Arab coast, and particularly with Dabai, are described in para. 3 above. 26. His Majesty's Government, on the other hand, have, as already stated, consistently held that the island of Henjam belongs to Persia, and that the claims of the Sultan of Muscat, on which the Sheikh of Henjam to some extent bases his attitude, cannot be entertained. 27. The gradual assertion of Persian authority in the island since the establishment on it of a customs port in 1904 (see para. ]4 above) has led during ihe last 25 years to considerable friction betw T een the local Persian officials and the Arab inhabitants. Tension was particularly marked t f.o. tel. to Teh., between 1904 and 1907,t during which period an appeal to the Sultan of 34 ' Feb -^ MuscatJ by the Henjam Arabs led to a visit to the island by His Highness 27'' in 1905, and a formal protest by him to His Majesty's Government against 1905, p. 301/06. Persian action. A proposal to transfer the Arabs to Basidu was rejected by His Majesty s Government in 1906 on political grounds. Difficulty again 1905, p. 1923/06. arose in 1914.§ § Lr - from 1)01 • Res. A serious incident would appear to a large extent to have been avoided 1914, p. 2407/14. in the past owing to the knowledge of the Sheikh that His Majesty's ■Government recognise Persian sovereignty, and the fact that the Persian •customs post lies within the boundary of the British concession. 28. Ill-feeling of long standing came to a head, however, in April 1927, when, consequent on the seizure by the Persian customs officials of a dhow belonging to the Sheikh of Henjam en route to Khassab on the Arabian coast and carrying Rs. 3,000 in cash, the customs post, though within the British concession, was attacked and looted by the Sheikh and his followers, the Customs Mudir being killed, the local Persian Postmaster wounded, and more serious disturbances being prevented only by the landing of a6 Re8, n aval party, the valuable services rendered by wliich were gratefully p. 2958. ' acknowledged subsequently by the Governor of the Gulf Ports. 29. The Sheikh was rebuked by the Senior Naval Officer for tig encroachment on the territory of the concession, which was, he alleged, the result of misunderstanding; and was reminded that he had been warned in June 1926 that should Persia take punitive action against him he need not look for protection to His Majesty's Government. 30. The Customs Mudir was replaced towards the end of 1927, but punitive action by Persia was delayed till the spring of 1928. In May of that year an armed Persian force landed on the island and expelled the Sheikh, who fled with his subjects to the Trucial Coast, leaving behind certain of the women of the tribe. He had been warned that if he sought refuge in the British Concession he would be surrendered, and the Persian troops on arrival were permitted to enter and camp in the concession on the ground that it was Persian territory. 31. The expulsion of the Sheikh, and in particular the fact that he had ^ een re ^ use ^ belter in the British Concession, produced a serious situation 1928^ p. 3979 une on the Arab coast (see paras 18 and 19 of the Memorandum on the Trucial Tel. from Poi. Res. Chiefs on p. |||| ). The Political Resident, apprehensive of the effect on JuS i I p . sovy . Trucial feeling of the adoption of a detached attitude by His Majesty's Government, suggested that His Majesty's Government might act 'as intermediaries, with a view to ascertaining whether Persia would be prepared to accept any terms on which the Sheikh could return on acknowledging Persian sovereignty and paying blood money. His Majesty's jn™T™J?3i57 7 ' Government, in agreement with the Government of India'and the Charge i.o. to f.o., june 23, d'Affaires at Teheran, decided, however, that intervention on behalf of F.atoTeh., 152, tlie Siieikl1 would be likely _ to do more harm than good ; that a local june 26, p. 3333.' settlement was clearly the right solution, and that if any influence was exercised with Persia it should he both unobtrusive and local. 32. The question of action on behalf of the Sheikh, in view of the- situation on the Trucial Coast, where feeling, further aggravated by the Tamb incident, continued to run high, formed the subject of considerable discussion during August and September 1928. In September 1928 the Sheikh of Dabai reported, however, that a Persian Envoy from Henjam had arrived inviting the Sheikh and all his people, except the actual murderers of the Mudir, to return^ and the Senior Naval Officer, aware of the reluctance of His Majesty's Government to intervene, advised that the Sheikh of Henjam must decide for himself. On 20th September the Political Resident reported that the Sheikh, with his men, had returned to Henjam, where he was understood to be awaiting the arrival of Persian Poi. Res. to G. of L, officials to effect a settlement.^ . 386, Sept. 20, o 5125. oo. Matters rest at this point. The Government of India had previously suggested that the Tiucial situation now made it desirable to inform the Dabai Arabs that while His Majesty's Government could not admit 'non- amenability of Sheikh of Henjam, as a resident on soil recognised by us as Persian, to Persian authority in respect of his Henjam holding, we are Tel. from Viceroy to prepared to represent views o£ Sheikh of Dabai and Beni Yas tribe . . to lep^ifp'me 78 '' Persian Government and use our good offices on behalf [of the Sheikh of Henjam] provided he is prepared to make full restitution for the murder of Customs Mudii. Matter might then be dealt with in autumn negotiations on basis of full acknowledgment of Persian sovereignty over Henjani. Issue of nationality should be avoided if possible, but, if it is to be raised, capital could be made . . . of status of (? Persians) resident on the Arab coast and^ in Iraq, and of Persian nationality law with its recognition of jus sanguinis.' Tel. from s. of s. 34. The Government of India have been asked whether their views are mwir' f®f ted b y th e r 1 etum Sheikh to Henjam. The Charge d •Affaires, p. 5125 /28. leneran, who had sounded the Persian Government as to the return of the Sheikh, has meanwhile expressed the view that failing a specific undertaking lf£ptn' 0 '' by Persia that he ' be permitted to return in full liberty, he runs a certain, p.i60/28. ' risk, and we cannot accept responsibility for what may happen.'7 Summary. 35. The island of Henjam has been recognised by His Majesty's •Government on several occasions as a Persian possession in terms such as to preclude a challenge to the Persian claim based on support of the rival claims of Muscat. The position in the island of His Majesty's Government depends^ solely, in law, on the concession granted for a telegraph station in 1868. That concession in terms permitted only the erection and maintenance of certain specified buildings, and the retention of a specified staff, for telegraph purposes. The wireless station subsequently erected, the naval coal depot, the naval canteen and recreation grounds, all therefore represent an encroachment by His Majesty's Government for which legal justification cannot be pleaded. 36.^ The position of His Majesty's Government in the island is further complicated by the fact that the Arab inhabitants, who claim to be Trucial subjects, and who dispute Persian sovereignty, tend to look to us for protection against Persia. The reactions on British interests on the Trucial Coast of the attitude towards them of His Majesty's Government make it extremely desirable to take any action reasonably possible in their interests. Any such action, at the same time, is viewed with deep suspicion by Persia, and represents from the Persian standpoint an additional argument for terminating the British connection with the island. 37. The importance of maintaining that connection is, however, con siderable. The strategic value of control of an island which commands the mouth of the Gulf, which has a good water supply and a good anchorage, needs no emphasis. The maintenance of the coaling depot at present situated on it is desirable so long as the Persian Gulf Squadron contains coal burning units; while the recreational facilities at present afforded to that squadron at Henjam are not available elsewhere in the Gulf. As will be seen from the Memorandum on Wireless on pages gl to HI, the island is of substantial importance in connection with wireless arrangements in the Gulf, while it might conceivably be of importance in certain circumstances in connection with the air route. 38. The omens are not favourable to the conclusion with Persia of an arrangement on lines satisfactory to His Majesty's Government, who have little to offer in exchange. It seems likely, as matters stand, that an offer to surrender the position at present occupied by His Majesty's Government in Basidu as the price of regularisation of the position in Henjam will prove less attractive to Persia than had at one time been hoped. It may, however, prove possible as part of the general settlement to secure the retention of the Telegraph concession, contracted to the essential needs of His Majesty's Government, on a long lease from Persia, on the basis of recognition, as at present, of full Persian sovereignty, and the importance of obtaining this may be held to justify the making of concessions in return to Persia which would in other circumstances have been disproportionate. Should it unfortunately prove impossible to arrive at an understanding with Persia, the arguments for consideration of the practicability of establishing a station on the Musandim Peninsula will be very appreciably strengthened. 39. The importance of the Sheikh of Henjam and his affairs derives from his connection with the Trucial Coast rather than with Henjam. It is to be hoped that the matter may have adjusted itself before negotiations with Persia are resumed. Should it not have done so, the balance of advantage appears, on a broad view, to lie with representations on his behalf to Persia by His Majesty's Government in the capacity of the disinterested friend of both parties, on the general lines set out in para. 33 above, coupled with the exercise of such pressure as is possible on the Sheikh and his subjects to recognise the status quo in Henjam. Points referred to the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee. 4:0. The following points have been referred to in connection with the ^deliberations of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee : — (a) Position of His Majesty's Government in Basidu, Kishm and Heniam (P.G. 6 2 (a) 5).8 (h) Whether the existing coaling depots on Kishm [Basidu] and Henjam can without disadvantage be moved to Bahrein ? (Conclusions of 1st meeting of Sub-Committee.) Views expressed by the Government of India. 41.

The Political Resident, who refers to the fact that the Henjam anchorage ' is absolutely indefensible from guns placed on Kishm Island,' has suggested on this point that His Majesty's Government should Lr from Poi.

Question of British Consular Representation in El Hasa and Qatif. 1. The question is one which originally arose in 1904, when the Govern ment of India, consequent on representations made during Lord Curzon's Cr GfI Deg , of visit to the Gulf in 1903 by the F3ritish. Indian merchants of Bahrein for the March si 1904. appointment of a British representative to protect their interests at Qatif against the vexatious action of the local Turkish Customs officials, recom mended that the Political Agent at Bahrein should be appointed Vice-Consul for El Hasa, and that a native Consular Agent should be stationed at Qatif. 2. His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople expressed himself as * s ofg t . orI to opposed to the proposal on the ground of the interpretation which the g. o/l^Au U. 51904. Turkish Government might place on it,* :;: ' and, a satisfactory reply having been received to the representations addressed by His Majesty's Government to the Sublime Porte in regard to the grievances of the Indian traders, out s.of s. for i. to a. of of which the question arose, the matter dropped for the time being. i., Dec. 201904. 3. There appear to have been no further developments until the beginning of 1914, when, consequent on the occupation of Hasa by Ibn Saud, the question of posting a native agent without further delay to Qatif was raised by the Government of India, who suggested that the matter Tel from Y icero was one in which advantage might be taken of the friendly attitude of Ibn tos. of s. forT^ 7 Saud. The Viceroy added that the posting of an agent ' will not only secure Fel:) - 27 1914 ' p - 768 - us desired foothold on this coast, but will enable us to render our good offices to Turkish Government in dealing with Ibn Saud, should they require them . . . and this might ex post facto be explained to Turkish Government.' It was decided, however, in view of the general Turkish attitude, that the proposal was one which it would be useless to put before the Sublime Porte, since, however innocent might be the intentions of His Majesty's Government in appointing a British Agent to Qatif, his despatch would be intensely resented by the Turkish Government. The Government of India Tel from s of s were accordingly informed that it was regarded as impossible to send a for i, to Viceroy, British Agent to Qatif pending negotiations. pToso / m 1914 ' 4. The outbreak of the war led to the question being dropped and it remained in abeyance until 1927. Consequent on the conclusion of the Treaty of Jeddah, it was, however, revived in that year by Ibn Saud, who, in a letter dated 12th October 1927 to the Political Resident in the Gulf, Tel. from Pol. Res. took specific exception to the local practice hitherto in force under which 51928 ' matters in dispute between Hasa and Bahrein had been settled by mutual ' arrangements with the Governor of Hasa, parties in cases being called to Bahrein to settle claims from the mainland and vice versa. The King of the Hejaz expressed surprise at the action of the Political Agent in asking that a Qatifi should be sent to Bahrein, and requested that 'international rules should be adhered to.' 5. In these circumstances Sir L. Haworth suggested that Ibn Saud should be asked whether he saw objection to the appointment as British aaflprii 0 !?^^ 0 Consul for Qatif and Ojair of the Political Agent, Bahrein. It would, he thought, be necessary for the Consul to push claims against Hasa and visit the port for that purpose. Sir L. Haworth explained that his proposal was no more than that the Political Agent should be Consul for Hasa and Qatif, in the same way as His Majesty'&lt;8 Government maintained the Consul at Jeddah. In reply to a further enquiry by the Government of India whether the Political Agent in present circumstances ever visited Hasa, and whether any danger would be involved in his doing so, the 3127 50 10,282 Resident stated that, no necessity Laving arisen, no _ Agent had visited Hasa since 1919, and that no danger * would be involved, since the- Agent would visit Qatif or Ojair only with the sanction o± and under arrangements made with the Governor of Hasa in order to settle cases. &lt;3.0. to 1.0.

INDIA OFFICE, Slavery in the Persian Gulf. Introductory. 1. The status of slavery is legally recognised in the Koran—an important consideration in dealing with the question of slavery in an area ruled exclusively, and peopled predominantly, by Mohammedans. Moreover, alike on the Trucial Arab Coast and in the dominions of Ibn Saud, the oustom of house-born slaves is one which is firmly established, and the eradication of which is likely to cause serious difficulty. Treaty Eng-agements of the Arab States of the Gulf. 2. From the precis of Treaties with the Chiefs of the Gulf States •contained in the Appendix to this Memorandum it will be seen that the engagements of Bahrein, the Trucial Sheikhdoms, and Muscat, to His Majesty's Government bind them to suppress and to abstain from the slave trade in their territories, and empower His Majesty's Government to search their vessels on their behalf, not only on the high seas, but in Arab and Muscat waters. On the occasion of the conclusion of the Treaty of 3rd November 1916 with El Katr, under which the Sheikh accepted obligations similar to those of the other Trucial Chiefs, it was agreed, however, that he and his subjects should be allowed to retain negro slaves already in their possession, on condition of their treatment being satisfactory. No formal engagement exists in the case of Kowelt: but the degree of control and influence exercised in that State by His Majesty's Government and the Government of India may be regarded as sufficient to enable them to impose in practice an effective check on slave traffic within its boundaries. Under Article 7 of the Treaty of Jeddah of 20th May 1927 Ibn Saud has undertaken to co-operate by all the means at his disposal with His Majesty's Government in the suppression of the slave trade, while ;a separate exchange of Notes took place with the King of Hejaz and Nejd on the same occasion regarding the retention by His Majesty's Government ■of the right to manumit slaves through their consular officers. Treaty Eng-ag-ements of Persia. - 3. The suppression of the traffic in slaves as between His Majesty's Government and Persia is governed by the Convention between Great Britain and Persia of 2nd March 1882. Under this Convention the Persian Government agree to take steps for the suppression of the trade, and to the search, detention, and bringing for trial before the nearest Persian authorities by His Majesty's ships of merchant vessels under the Persian flag or belonging to Persian subjects which may be engaged, or which there may be reasonable grounds for suspecting to be, or to have been, engaged, during the voyage on which they are met. in carrying slaves. A special proviso deals with the position of slaves accompanying an individual to the pilgrimage places under a passport countersigned by the British authority. The Convention further provides that a representative of the British Government shall be present at the adjudication on any merchant vessel under the Persian flag captured by a British cruiser and taken into a Persian port for that purpose; that the proceeds of the sale of such a vessel, if condemned, shall go to Persia; and that the slaves found on board be handed over to Great Britain. 4. The history of the Gulf as a centre of slaving activity is notorious, and the relatively satisfactory condition of affairs described below represents the result of over a century of unceasing vigilance on the part of His Majesty's Government. The slave trade in the Gulf has now been under effective control for many years, and it is unnecessary in the circumstances to examine in detail its history since 1908. The statement which follows confines itself accordingly to setting out the position as regards slavery at the present time on the Arabian and on the Persian littoral of the Gulf 3144 a 75 10.282 respectively, and the course of the discussions- which have taken place- consequent on the recent intimation by Persia that she regards as derogatory to her dignity the Anglo-Persian Slavery Convention of 1882. Present position on the Arab Littoral of the Gulf. 5. The effect of the engagements referred to in para. 2 above, of the degree of control exercised by His Majesty's Government in Koweit, and of the energetic and unremitting activity of successive political officers and of His Majesty's ships, has been to reduce the slave traffic on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf to relatively unimportant dimensions. From a * p. 4481. Report submitted by the Political Resident in the Gulf on 10th June 1928* it appears that all the slave trade which now exists, other than such as may emanate from Nejd, is from Persian Buluchistan to the Trucial Arab coast, on which slavery is still common—the Batineh coast of Muscat (portions of which are not under the effective control of the Muscat authorities) being frequently used as a pied d terre, and the small Trucial Sheikhdom of Dabai playing a prominent part. On a broad view, however, though the Political Resident can report that u at Koweit, and, on the Arab coast, there are many t Tel. from Pol. Res. thousands of slaves who have been brought from the interior at some time,'! to g. of i., July si problem, so far as the Arab States of the Gulf are concerned, maybe regarded as one of relatively small importance ; the treaty engagements and the special relations which exist between His Majesty's Government and the rulers of those States are, so far as can be judged, adequate, if strictly interpreted, to secure that no recrudescence of the slave traffic shall take place on the Arabian shore of the Gulf; the hold exercised by Hindu merchants over the pearl fishing industry affords a guarantee of some value Lr. from Pol. Res. to that the presence of Indian slaves in the Gulf cannot long pass unnoticed, g . of L, June io a]QC i ^ the lig'ht of Sir Lionel Haworth's Report referred to above, the Government of India, who are fully alive to the importance of the question, have recently approved the Resident's proposal ' to tighten up the reading: of our Treaties with the Sheikhs to the most favourable interpretation to which it is possible to bring them in this connection,' and have instructed him to devote his special attention to Dabai, and to 'consider the advisability of making it quite clear to the Sheikh that any connivance by him in the traffic, or indeed any slackness on his part to suppress it, will bring him within their displeasure, which they will not hesitate to manifest.'' Present position on the Persian Littoral. 6. It is equally the case that the measures taken under the Anglo- Persian Convention of 1882 (and, in so far as Gwadur is concerned, under the treaty engagements of the Sultan of Muscat with His Majesty's Govern- Tei.from viceroy, ment) have resulted in the reduction to relatively unimportant dimensions April 20 1928, ' of the slave trade on the Persian littoral. The extent, however, to which, p - 297L despite the endeavours of His Majesty's Government, the slave traffic between Persia and the Arab coast continues to persist is described by the Government of India as disquieting, and the danger of its revival on a larger X p. 4904/28. scale is one which cannot be overlooked. J The absence of effective control by Persia of Persian Baluchistan has resulted in a small but regular traffic, 800s' A O rii 20 C i928 : ^ rom ^ latj area ' which§ slavery is stated to be rife. In Sir L. Haworth's p. 1971. Pri ' ' view this traffic is likely to continue until Persia is in a position to establish such control. Active steps are, however, being taken by Sir L. Haworth Lr. from g . of I. to locally to put a stop to it, while the Government of India, as the result of his i928^p S 5036^ 22 report, have taken action to improve co-ordination in preventive measures between the authorities in Sind and British Baluchistan and the British officials in the Gulf. Persian representations regarding abrogation of Slavery Convention of 1882 with Great Britain. 7. The Persian Government in April of this year indicated, in the first stage in their general negotiations with His Majesty's Government, that they Teh. tel. to f.o ., regarded the Slavery Convention of 1882 as one derogatory to Persian April1 1928, p. 1622. t ^g n ity, and, while it is not yet clear whether they intend to press for its abrogation, the question of the attitude to be adopted in face of such a•&gt; o demand, if made, has been under the active consideration of the Government of India and His Majesty's Government. P ersia and the L eague of N ations S lavery C onvention of 1926. 8. The position is complicated by the existence of the League of Nations Slavery Convention of 1926. The Convention in question imposes on the States adhering to it a binding obligation to take, within their capacity, all possible action to prevent and to suppress the slave trade, and to bring about, progressively and as soon as possible, the complete abolition of slavery in all its forms, ft provides further, however, in the first place (Article 3), that States adhering to its terms shall remain free to conclude, subject to its provisions, such special agreements as, by reason of their peculiar situation, may appear suitable to attain its objects, and, secondly, (Article 9), that States shall be at liberty to adhere to it subject to reservations in respect of the application of the Convention or part of it to some or all of the territories of the State concerned. 9. Were Persia to sign and ratify the Convention in question in respect of the Persian Gulf, and were she in a position elfectively to discharge in that area the international obligations undertaken by her under the Convention, the case for a special agreement between her and His Majesty's Government on the general lines of the Slavery Convention of 1882, would be substantially weakened, if not destroyed, although the terms of Article 3 of the Convention, to which reference is made above, would clearly leave it open to her to conclude such an agreement. In fact, however, while the Convention was signed by the Persian representative at the League, his signature was given ad referendum (and subject to a specific minor reservation), and the Convention has not been ratified by Persia. Moreover, even were she to ratify it, in its present form, she would be incapable, as matters stand, of discharging effectively the obligations which it would impose upon her, for there is no Persian Navy (other than a few Customs p. 4760/28. preventive boats), and the local Persian officials in the Gulf are stated by the Political Resident to be of such a character that, in the absence of the Convention of 1882, they would themselves participate in the slave traffic. 10. The available evidence indicates that relaxation, even, of the precautions at present taken under the Convention of 1882 to prevent slavery in the Gulf is likely to lead to a serious recrudescence of the slave traffic. The apparent impotence of Persia to substitute an effective preventive service of her own and the importance of provision for the effective discharge in the Gulf of the humanitarian and international obligations at present discharged by His Majesty's Government under the 1882 Convention, make it desirable, therefore, that if that Convention is to be revised, the new Instrument, if any, to be substituted for it in deference to Persian susceptibilities, should differ from it in form and not in substance. From a different standpoint it is desirable that whatever compromise is offered to Persia should aim at retaining control by His Majesty's Government of preventive action (the objections to the development of a Persian Naval Force, which in present circumstances would probably be officered from foreign and non-British sources, are patent), and at retaining the present immunity of British ships from search on the high seas by Persian vessels. Attitude to be adopted towards a Persian demand for abrogation. V iews of F oreign O ffice. 11. A final decision has not been reached as to the offer to be made to Persia should she press for the abrogation of the Convention of 1882. The Foreign Office in June 1928 expressed the view that His Majesty's f.o .to i .o., june Government should assent to such a demand on the understanding only 1928 ) p - 30 80. that the Convention should be replaced by a new Convention which, in prder to meet Persian susceptibilities regarding unequal treaties, should be drafted on a basis of reciprocity, and should generally follow, subject to certain modifications, the lines of an existing Slavery Treaty between His Majesty's Government and another first-class Power, such as the Anglo-Italian Slavery Treaty of 1889. (A Convention on these lines would, it may be remarked, empower Persian vessels to search British shipson the high seas suspected of engaging in the slave traffic, and to detain or divert them from their course where 'prima 'f acie evidence of complicityexisted.) Views of India Office and Admiralty. 12. Subsequent consideration has proceeded on the basis of the Foreign Office proposals. Those proposals, and the question as a whole, have now ^ been examined by the Government of India, the India Office and the Admiralty. Subject to certain supplementary observations set out in para. 14 below, the Admiralty concur in the conclusions reached on the i .o. to f.o., Sept. 8 matter by the Secretary of State for India in the light of^ the considered 1928, p. 2760. recommendations of the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and communicated to the Foreign Office on 8th September. Those conclusions are as follow :— (a) That in the forthcoming negotiations His Majesty's Government should aim at securing that vessels flying the British flag shall retain their present immunity from search on the high seas by Persian vessels (which is regarded as essential); that no substantial relaxation of preventive measures shall take place in the Gulf; and that preventive action in the Gulf shall so far as possible remain in the hands of His Majesty's Government. (&amp;) That, in the first instance, endeavours should be made to secure an agreement with Persia on the basis of a modernisation of the form 1 while retaining the essential matter of the 1882 Convention, the S key-note of the new Convention being possibly, as suggested by the Government of India, that Persia, being desirous of putting down the slave traffic, had secured the naval assistance of His Majesty's Government, instead of, as at present, that an unwilling Persia was being forced to suppress the slave traffic by His Majesty's Government, (c) That the right of searching vessels in Persian territorial waters at present exercised by His Majesty's Government under the Slavery ] Convention might be abandoned should some further concession he necessary. [AW.—Persia already enjoys the right to search British vessels in Persian territorial waters, and the effect of the concession in question j would be to leave the policing of Persian waters exclusively to her. ■ It may be remarked that in the view of the Government of India even this gap in the preventive system is bevond Persia's power to fill.] {d) That a concession by which His Majesty's Government should abandon their right to search Persian vessels on the high seas and J should restrict their search of such vessels to Arab waters (in which, 1 under their treaties w r ith the various Arab Sheikhs, the right of search J of all vessels is vested in them), would be in the highest degree I objectionable, as amounting to a virtual abandonment in toto of the I Convention of 1882, while the loss of power to search suspected I Persian vessels on the high seas must necessarily curtail the effective- 1 ness of His Majesty's ships in keeping down the slave traffic. (e) That in view of the present impotence of Persia to substitute effective I preventive slavery measures of her own, the propriety of invoking the assistance of the League of Nations, in the general interests of I civilisation, should be considered should Persia adopt an unreasonable J attitude and reject a compromise on the lines set out in (5) and (c) I above, and that the adoption of this course should equally he considered in the event of a unilateral denunciation by Persia of the Convention of 1882. 14. The Admiralty, in expressing their concurrence in the views of the SeT15 1928 Secretary of State for India as set out above, added that in their view if the p 6 5029. ' compromises proposed by the India Office were not acceptable, His Majesty's Government should give up any idea of making a Slavery Convention with Persia; and that if there were a unilateral denunciation of the 1882 Convention, Persia, as a member of the League of Nations, should be pressed | to take steps as soon as it is clear that she has failed to suppress the slave traffic.

The relevancy to the Persian attitude towards the independence of Bahrein and of the Trucial Sheikhdoms of recent Persian complaints about the prevalence of smuggling to the South Persian coast from the Arab littoral and from.the Persian Gulf islands makes it desirable briefly to set out the recent history of this question, and the result of the investigation made by His Majesty's Government and the Government of India of the extent to which assistance could be given to Persia in the suppression of the contraband traffic. 2. On various occasions during the past year His Majesty's represen- Teh. Desp. 137, tatives at Tehran and the Political Resident have emphasised that the problem p a ^ 7 2 5 2 1928 ' is one of very serious dimensions, and the Belgian Administrator-General of Teh tel ' 246 Customs informed Mr. Parr, in the summer of this year, in connection with Aug. 14' p. 4368/28. the Iamb incident, that the Sheikhs on the Trucial coast were all associated Te h-236, Aug.8 with smuggling, and that 'his people are at their wits'end how to cope 1928 ' R4219 - with it.' The serious development of the trade apparently dates from the imposition by Persia in 1925 of a monopoly tax on all consignments of tea and sugar imported from abroad. The situation is rendered difficult by the fact that the Persian Government have practically no means of coping with it on the sea, and very inadequate means for dealing with it on the coast, the corruption of the local officials being a serious factor, while the fact that the motor launches possessed by the Customs administration, although they carry an automatic gun, are not armoured, places them at a disadvantage in dealing with armed smugglers. 3. A formal request to His Majesty's Government to assist them in suppressing smuggling on the Gulf has not so far been made by the Persian Government, and there is no special reason to suppose that such a request is likely to be made in the course of the forthcoming negotiations. Active steps, in fact, are apparently being taken by Persia to deal with the problem in other ways, and there is reason to suppose that the Persian Government contemplate the purchase of half a dozen Italian vessels, and the engagement of an Italian Naval Officer for preventive service in the Gulf. As will be seen from^ what follows, the matter has, however, been brought to the notice of His Majesty's representatives on various occasions, both by the Minister of Court and by the Belgian Customs officials. 4:. The importance to Persia of the suppression of the traffic was mentioned to Sir Robert Clive by the Persian Minister of the Court at the beginning of the present year, in connection with the Persian claims to Bahrein, and Sir Robert Clive then suggested to His Majesty's Government that it might be possible to dispose directly of the Persian claims to the island if it was possible to meet Persia in regard to the prevention of smuggling from Bahrein to the Persian coast. On the 27th January Sir Robert Clive reported an interview with the Administrator-General of Jan - 15 ' Customs, in which M. Molitor had stated that during the past year the Persian Government had been hard hit by the smuggling conducted from Koweit^ Bahrein and Dabai, and that all the reports received from his ^2^:1928 3 p 879, agents insisted that to take effective measures for the cessation of this illicit traffic British co-operation was necessary. The only practical suggestion which the Administrator-General could make, however, was that the resident British authorities in the ports mentioned ' could help a great deal by having ships' manifests inspected, and the loading of the cargoes supervised.' 5. In the light of the Minister's representations, which assumed particular importance in view of the desirability of disposing of the question of Bahrein in direct negotiation with Persia rather than through the League of Nations, the question of possible action to assist the Persian Government was carefully investigated by the Admiralty and the Government of India. The results, however, were not such as to show that any effective assistance could conveniently be given to Persia, the objections to action being partly of a general political character, and partly based on grounds of practicability. 3144 b 75 10 286. On the question of action by His Majesty's ships, the Admiralty, Adm. to f.o., Jan. 25 drew attention to the fact that the Navy had no power to take action 1928, p. 409. against persons infringing Persian smuggling laws, stated that it would be contrary to the policy hitherto pursued for the Navy to take any active steps in civil operations such as the prevention of smuggling. The only action which could, in their view, be taken without a departure from, precedent would be to report cases in which smuggling appeared to b taking place which came under the notice of His Majesty's ships. Thoy presumed that this would be unlikely to be of much assistance. 7. The matter was very carefully investigated by the Political Resident and by the Government of India. The result of its examination by Sir Lionel Haworth was to indicate that assistance to Persia was not merely politically undesirable, but unlikely to produce any result of value. 8. The political objections seen by the Resident, with whose views the Government of India agreed, were that assistance could be given only by applying to the Arab rulers of the Arab littoral pressure which was not justified under the treaties between His Majesty's Government and those potentates, vis-d-vis whom His Majesty's Government had no sort of right to interfere; that an}^ attempt to apply such pressure would react very TeL from Poi^Res. a j verse |y on tlie position of His Majesty's Government on the littoral in 1928, p. 2005. question ; and that at a time when the consolidation of; the British position Tel. from viceroy to in that area was more than ever important, the arguments for action of such Sept1928,' p 7 478s. a character in the interests of a Government which had done nothing to meet us on any point were not convincing. 9. Apart from the general political objections set out above, the Political Resident stated that to force the rulers affected to adopt the preventive measures which w 7 ould be necessary if anything was to be achieved would be difficult at Bahrein, except at considerable expense; still more difficult at Koweit ; impossible at Dabai, unless the whole policy of His Majesty's Government on the Trucial coast was altered, and completely impracticable at El Katr (close to Bahrein), except by an increase in the British Naval force in the Gulf, after the manner adopted in the case of the arms traffic, and its employment for the purpose. As for concentrating action against Bahrein, Sir Lionel Haworth reported that smuggling took place not only from Bahrein, but from the entire length of the Arab coast, and that the success of measures against the Principality would only drive the trade to other ports, over which no effective control is exercised by His Majesty's Government. A final objection to action on the part of His Majesty's Government was that the greater part of the smuggling done was done from Persia in Persian ships, and not from Bahrein; that it would be stopped to a great extent if Persia could spend money for patrolling her own coast; and that the real difficulty was that all the Persian Khans were interested in smuggling, that the Persian Customs officials were bribed, and that the country of Tangistan was out of Persian control. 10. The Government of India, in expressing their agreement with the Vieeroy's tel. 1782 s. views of the Political Resident asset out above, add that Persia Sept. 11928,p.4783. ' i s no t our business to control harmless exports like sugar from our Arab Protectorates, and Persia's apparent expectation to the contrary . . . has, as far as we know, no basis in international usage.' Summary. 11. It appears quite impracticable, in view of the difficulties set out by the Indian authorities, and the objections of principle seen by the Admiralty, for His Majesty's Government to lend any effective assistance to Persia m dealing w T ith the problem of smuggling, The political objections to the application of pressure to the Arab rulers of the Gulf are very strong in present circumstances, and they are reinforced by the practical difficulties to which Sir Lionel Haworth draws attention. It is to be regretted that it is impossible to assist Persia in this matter, for an offer of help by His Majesty's Government, if indeed it was likely to produce any effective result, might form a useful lever for bargaining purposes. But the objections to action appear to be insuperable. India Office, J. G. L. 1st October 1928.CONFIDENTIAL. 'R 40Q INDIA OFFICE p APPEXDIX. Precis of the Treaties and Engagements between the British GoYernment and the Chiefs of the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf. KOWEIT. (а) Agreement dated 23rd January 1899.— The Sheikh pledged himself and his heirs and successors not to receive the Agent or Representative of p. 2585/26. any Power or Government at Koweit . . . without the previous sanction of the British Government . . . and not to cede, sell, lease or mortgage or give for occupation or for any other purpose any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power, without the previous consent of His Majesty's Government. (б) Letter from Lieut-Col. Meade, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Sheikh of Koweit, dated 23rd January 1899, accompanying (a):—The Sheikh was formally assured £&lt; of the good offices of the British Government towards you, your heirs and successors as long as you, your heirs and successors scrupulously and faithfully observe the conditions of the said bond (i.e. the agreement above).' . N ote .—In 1911, when the text of the Agreement of 1899 was com- p . 4525 /11 municated to the Turkish Government, the text of Col. Meade's accompanying letter was not similarly communicated ; but the Turkish Government was told in Sir E. Grey's covering note that 'His Majesty's Government have informed the Sheikh of Koweit that so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obligations under the Agreement, His Majesty's Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices. His Majesty's Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion.' The attitude adopted at the time by His Majesty's Government towards this undertaking is illustrated by the following extract from India Office letter dated the 30th October 1911 to the Foreign OfficeThe term 1446/11 4 good offices' ... is a conveniently vague one, and Lord Crewe is of opinion that it is neither necessary nor safe to go beyond it. The action taken by Bis Majesty's Government in 1901-2, when men and guns were landed at Koweit to defend it against unprovoked Turkish aggression, will, moreover, have made it plain to the Porte in what way we are prepared to interpret the term if necessity arises.' (c) Agreement of the Sheikh of Koweit, dated 24th May 1900, to prohibit the importation of arms into, and their exportation from, Koweit. (#) Postal Agreement, dated 28th February 1904, giving His Majesty's Government the sole right to erect a post office at Koweit. (e) Secret Agreement, dated 15th October 1907, for the lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore. —In the fifth article of the two documents constituting the agreement the Sheikh reaffirmed his pledge not to cede, sell, &amp;c., any Koweit territory to any foreign Government or foreign subject without His Majesty's Government's permission. In the ninth, the British Government promised that &lt;£ the town of Koweit and its^ boundaries belong to . . . the Sheikh of Koweit and to his heirs after him, and that all Sheikh Mubarak's arrangements in the matter of customs, &amp;c., and his arrangements at the present day shall remain in the Lands of Sheikh Mubarak-as-Subah, ruler of Koweit, and his heirs after him . . N ote .—The lease, or rather the payment of rent for the Bunder Shweikh site, was terminated in 1922. It does not appear, however, that the agreement was abrogated, and the reciprocal pledges, so far as they are not affected by other subsequent instruments, presumably remain binding. 3138 75 10.28 A2 Aitchison, Vol. XII, p. 172.

He gave a similar undertaking as regards oil in 1913. (g) Letter dated 3rd November 1914 from the Political Resident to the^ Sheikh, in which the Sheikh was given, in return for his co-operation against the Turks, certain assurances of which the third was that ' Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection.' j (Ji) The undertakings given to Sheikh Mubarak were renewed in 1917 to his son Jabir, and again, on his accession, to the latter's successor, his brother Salim, To Salim, who proved troublesome, Government in 1918 gave a warning that the assurances conveyed to him on his accession were conditional on his good behaviour. (See Memorandum on Koweit on page H, para. 20.) (i) In a Kharita delivered on 19tlL July 1921 the Viceroy renewed to the present Sheikh, Ahmad al Jabir, nephew of Salim, the assurances given to the latter. BAHREIN. (a) In 1820 the Ruler of Bahrein subscribed to the general treaty with the Arab Chiefs of the Persian Gulf, which prescribed abstention from ; plunder and piracy by land and sea, from slave traffic, and from inter-tribal w T ar, and peace with the British Government. (The adherence of Bahrein to this treaty gave the British Government a formal right to intervene, as it did in 1863, between Bahrein, Abu Dhabi and Katr, and again in 1867-9.)' ih) In 1847 the Sheikh of Bahrein subscribed to an engagement for the abolition of slave trade in his ports and for the submission of Bahreini vessels to search by British cruisers for slaves, and to seizure if guilty, and j in 1856 signed a further engagement for the better suppression of the slave trade. (c) On the 31st May 1861 Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifa signed on behalf of himself and his heirs and successors a ' perpetual treaty of peace and friendship with the British Government.' In Article 2 he agreed to abstain from maritime aggression, war, piracy and slavery by sea ' so long as I receive the support of the British Govern ment in the maintenance of the security of my own possessions against similar aggressions directed against them by the Chiefs and tribes of this Gulf.' In Article 3 he undertook to refer to the arbitration of the Political Resident cases of aggression by sea on Bahrein or Bahreinis and to refrain from retaliation without the Political Resident's assent. ' And the British Resident engages that he will forthwith take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation for every injury ... by sea upon Bahrein or,. J its dependencies.' {d) On 22nd December 1880 Sheikh Isa signed an agreement binding himself and his successors not to enter into negotiations with any State or Government other than the British without the consent of the British Government, and to prevent the establishment of diplomatic or consular agencies or coaling depots, other than British, without the consent of the British Government. 44 This engagement does not apply to or affect the customary friendly correspondence with the local authorities of neighbouring States on business of minor importance.' {e) On the 13th March 1892 Sheikh Isa signed a further agreement the first two articles of which reaffirmed his undertaking to abstain from relations with foreign Governments; in the third article he undertook on no account to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation any part of my territory save to the British Government.' (/) lu 1S98 the Sheikh of Bahrein signed an agreement to prohibit the traffic in arms in Bahrein territory.(l^) In 1911 the Sheikh agreed not to allow any foreign Power to open a Post Office in Bahrein, and not to grant a pearl fishing or sponge fishing concession to foreigners. In 1914 he agreed not to search for oil himself or give others permission to do so without consulting the Political Agent and : receiving the approval of the Government of India. EL -KATR. (a) In 1868, as a result of hostilities initiated in Katr by the Sheikh of Bahrein in co-operation with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and continued by a retaliatory attack on Bahrein by Katr, Sheikh Mahomed bin Thani executed ran agreement to abstain from hostilities and to accept the arbitration of the Resident, particularly in disputes as to the tribute payable to the Sheikh of Bahrein, to whom the Sheikhs of Katr were then in some degree subordinated. (b) Shortly after, the Turks established themselves in Katr; and though tolj; the British authorities did not hesitate to have direct dealings with the Sheikhs of Katr, no written agreement was made with them. (c) In the course of the negotiations with the Turkish Government in 1913 it was agreed that the southern and eastern limit of ' le Sandjuk Ottoman de Nedjd ' should be a ' une ligne partant du fond extreme du golfe faisant ^jJ face a File de Zahnounie (i.e. the Bay of Salwa to the west of El Katr) qui J ira directement au sud jusqu'au Ruba'-al-Khafi et separera le Nedjd de la presqu'-ile de I'El-Katr.' Further, it was agreed that ' le Gouvernement J de Sa Majeste Britannique—ne permettra pas au cheikh de Bahrein de s'immiscer dans les affaires interieures d'el-Katr, de porter atteinte a |jj|l Tautonomie de ce pays ou de I'annexer.' '' (d) The separation of El Katr from Nejd and its independence of Bahrein having been thus established (though not thereby given effect), the way was open for the conclusion of a Treaty signed on 3rd November 1916 after the Uil Turks had finally been expelled from El-Katr in the course of the war. In this treaty the Sheikh takes note of, undertakes the obligations Articles I and il resulting from, and is promised the advantages accruing from the various lekl 'engagements concluded by the Trucial Chiefs for the suppression of slave j anil trade and piracy and the preservation of the maritime peace. In Article III he undertakes to prohibit arms trade in Katr and to • j observe the arms traffic rules of the British Government. yer J In Articles IV and V he undertakes to have no relations with the Agent ■ of any other Power without the consent of the British Government, or to H -cede land by lease, sale or gift or to grant monopolies, concessions or cable landing rights. ., I In Articles VII, VIII and IX he undertakes to protect British residents and, if required, receive a British representative, and establish a British ™| post aod telegraph office. In return the British Government undertakes in Articles X and XI to protect the Sheikh, his subjects and territory from all aggression by sea, • 1 I and to grant their good offices should he or his subjects be assailed by land within the territories of Qatar ; it being understood that this obligation M -only applies in the event of such aggression by land or by sea being eon unprovoked by the Sheikh or his subjects. itisIB Note .—Erom para. 10 of the Memorandum on the Trucial Chiefs on p. || it will be seen that on the question being raised by the Sheikh in W 1922 of the assistance which he might expect from Government in the event •of an attack by Ibn Sand, he was informed that His Majesty's Government ]|f were not prepared to promise more than diplomatic assistance. TRUCIAL COAST (Ras-ul-Khaima, Abu Dhabi, Dabai, Shargah, Ajman, J Umm al Qaiwain). (a) In 1820 these chiefs signed the general treaty (see Bahrein (a)) prescribing perpetual abstention from plunder and piracy by land and sea. Ji and from irregular (i.e. unproclaimed) w T ar; registration of dhows; peace with the British Government; abstention from the carrying off or transport of slaves; free entry of their ships into British ports; ' and if any shall i attack them the British Government shall take notice of it.' ' :i: * * ' Them ' in the context appears to mean the ships of the signatory Chiefs; but it may mean the Chiefs.4 (b) In 1838, 1839 and 1847 agreements were entered into by these Chiefs, for the suppression of slave trade, and ior the search and, if necessary^ seizure by British warships of any of their vessels suspected of engaging in this trade. _ 1 1 (c) In 1843 a Maritime Truce for ten years was signed by these Chiefs*, 41 being fully impressed with a sense of the evil consequences arising from* our subjects and dependents being prevented from carrying on the pearl fishery without interruption on the banks, owing to the various feuds- existing among ourselves.' This Truce cancelled the right of the Chiefs, implied in the' general Treaty of 1820, to wage regular war on each other. Under the Truce they agreed to refer disputes and cases of aggression to the decision of the Political Resident. In 1853 the Truce was renewed in perpetuity. (d) In 1892 exclusive agreements were signed by all the Trucial Chiefs, on behalf of themselves, their heirs and successors, that they will on no account enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Power other than the British Government; that without the consent of the British Government they will not consent to the residence in their territories of the agent of any other Government; and that they will on no account cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, any part of their territories, save to the British Government. (e) In 1902 the Chiefs undertook to prohibit the importation of arms into, and their exportation from their territories. (/) In 1911 the Sheikhs undertook not to give pearling or sponge fishing concessions, save with the prior approval of His Majesty's Government. (g) In 1922 similar undertakings were given regarding oil. OMAN (MUSCAT). (i) Treaties and Agreements with Great Britain. Aitchison, Vol. xii , (a) Treaty relations date from 1798, when an agreement was made by the p- 207. Imam with the East India Company to exclude the French and Dutch from his territories 'whilst warfare shall continue between the English Company and them.' (h) In 1822 a Treaty for Suppression of the Slave Trade was signed, providing inter alia for action by the Imam's officers in Muscat territory, and for seizure, outside certain limits, by the British of any vessels carrying slaves to Christian countries. (c) In 1839 a Commercial Treaty was concluded on a reciprocal most favoured-nation basis, providing for the purchase, sale or hire of lands by British subjects in Muscat territory, appointment of Consuls, protection of Muscat subjects in British employ, extraterritoriality for British subjects, unrestricted trade, limitation of import duties to 5 per cent, and freedom from export duties. no., pp. 220,221. {d) In 1839 and 1845 further enactments reinforced the right of British vessels to detain and search and if necessary confiscate Muscat ship^ suspected of carrying slaves, outside certain limits.

The Foreign Office (Supplementary) Memorandum of 1908 deals with the earlier history of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf. At the date- of that Memorandum the States, other than Muscat, bordering on the Gulf, had declared the trade illegal, or had agreed with His Majesty's- Government for its suppression. The absence of any restrictions on the import and export of arms from Muscat, which was prevented from imposing restrictions by its treaties with foreign Powers, had, however, led to the concentration of the traffic in that State, and so to a situation which the Government of India and His Majesty's Government, vitally interested in checking the flow of modern arms of precision to Afghanistan and the- JNorth-West Frontier of India, regarded with the utmost gravity. 2. The period now under review is marked by the conclusion of arrangements which have effectively curbed the arms traffic in Muscat and by the reduction to insignificant dimensions of that traffic in the Gulf as a whole. The present Memorandum proposes briefly to set out the treaty engagements and agreements concluded on the subject between His Majesty's Government and the States bordering on the Gulf, and, after a reference to- the Arms Traffic Conventions of 1919 and 1925, to refer to the more- important developments in the Gulf between 1908 and 1928 in connection with the suppression of the trade in arms. Treaty Engagements, &amp;c., of States bordering on the Persian Gulf. 3. With the exception of the King of the Hejaz and Nejd, the rulers- whose States border on the Persian Gulf at the present date are bound by treaty or agreement to prohibit and suppress the arms traffic in their territories. The import of arms into Persia was prohibited by the Shah in 1881, and again in 1900. In 1897 Her Majesty's Government secured from the^ Persian Government a firman, under which the Shah empowered Her Majesty's ships in the Persian Gulf to examine and search all merchant vessels in the Persian Gulf and confiscate and hand over to the Persian Government all prohibited arms found on board. This firman remaius in force. On the Arab littoral of the Gulf, the Sheikh of Bahrein agreed in 1898 to. prohibit the traffic in arms in Bahrein territory ; the SheikhTof Koweit gave a similar undertaking in 1900, as did the Trucial Chiefs in 1902. The import of arms into Turkey (and so, up to 1914, into El Hasa and El Katr&gt; was prohibited in 1862 ; and the Sheikh of El Ka.tr, under his treaty with His Majesty's Government of' 3rd November 1916, undertook the same obligations, in the matter as the other Trucial Chiefs. By a Proclamation of 1898, the Sultan of Muscat, who in 1881 had prohibited the import of arms at. Gwadur, his dependency on the Makran coast, authorised British and Persian war vessels to search British, Muscat, or Persian vessels for arms in Muscat waters, as well as Muscat vessels in Indian and Persian waters, and to confiscate arms and ammunition intended for Indian or Persian ports. In 1903 he empowered British (and Italian) vessels to search Muscat vessels suspected of carrying arms on the high seas ; and in 1912 an agreement was reached with His Highness by His Majesty's Government for the establishment in his State of a warehouse regime,' the result of which has^ been to dispose of the Muscat arms traffic as a serious issue. Ibn Saud alone of the rulers whose States border on the Gulf remains unfettered by any agreement in the matter. The Arms Traffic Conventions of 1919 and 1925. 4. Save in the case of the Sheikh of El Katr, the engagements referred to in the preceding paragraph had 'been concluded before the European 3158 75 10.282 War. One effect of the War was to release a very large quantity of arms and am munition, not least in territories bordering on the Persian Onlf, and from 1917 onwards the action to be taken to deal with the situation which was regarded as likely to result was the subject of anxious consideration by His Majesty's (government. It is unnecessary in the present Memorandum, which is directed solely to the local question of the situation in the Persian Gulf, to enter into any detailed account of the discussions which took place. Suffice it to say that consequent on them the matter was taken up and pressed by His Majesty's Government on the conclusion of the War, and that, on I'Oth September 1919, an Arms Traffic Convention was approved and signed at St. Germain-en-Laye by the Allied Powers other than the United States of America, and by a number of the Powers associated with them. 5. The Convention in question declared 'Persia, Gwadur, the Arabian Peninsula, and such continental parts of Asia as were included in the 'Turkish Empire on 4th August 1914,' together with 'a maritime zone including . . . the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman ...' prohibited areas, within which the High Contracting Parties undertook to prohibit, save under most stringent restrictions, the importation (and, in the case of the maritime zone, the transportation) of specified arms and ammunition. It proved impracticable, however, to secure the general ratification of the Convention ; in 1923 the United States of America definitely declared their inability to accede to its provisions, and it was abandoned. 6. But the question was too important to be allowed to drop, and in September 1923 the Temporary Commission on Armaments was invited by the League of Nations to examine it further and to consider the preparation of an International Convention likely to meet with general acceptance The result of the deliberations of this body was the holding at Geneva in 1925 of an Arms Traffic Conference which drew up a revised Convention. The new Convention, which was based, in general, on the abortive Convention of 1919, followed that Convention in declaring the Arabian Peninsula, the Muscat dependency of Gwadur on the Persian littoral of the Gulf, and a maritime zone to include the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman, and to be bounded by a line drawn from and following the latitude of Cape Guardafui to the point of intersection with longitude 57° East of Greenwich, and proceeding thence direct to the eastern frontier of Gwadur, ' a special zone ' (or prohibited area) for the purpose of the arms traffic. It likewise followed the Convention of 1919 in providing that within the special zones no ' native vessel ' of less than 500 tons net tonnage should be allowed to ship, discharge, or tranship .specified arms, ammunition and implements of war. The definition of a native vessel was one either owned, fitted out or commanded by a native of any country bordering on the Indian Ocean west of the meridian 95° East of Greenwich and north of the parallel of 11° South longitude, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf or the Gulf of Oman, if at least half the crew are natives of such countries. The Convention as originally drafted had likewise followed the Convention of 1919 in declaring Persia a special zone. 7. The strongest exception was taken by the Persian delegates at the League to the last-mentioned proposal, and, in deference to their represen tations, it was decided that Persia should no longer be classified as a prohibited or special area. _ Persian agreement to the inclusion of the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman in the ' special ' maritime zone was secured only with the greatest difficulty, and consequent on earnest representations at Teheran by His Majesty's Government, while it proved impossible to secure Persian concurrence in the inclusion of Persian vessels in the category of native craft (it may be remarked that a specific reservation on this last point was again made by Persia in connection with Article 3 of the League of Nations Slavery Convention on the occasion ot the signature of that Convention {ad referendum) by her representative at Geneva in September 1Q26). In the event the Convention, which has not yet been ratified by any of the principal arms-producing countries, was not signed by Persia/ For practical purposes, therefore, while His Majesty's' Government endeavour, in •dealing with the arms trade, to be guided sd far as possible by the spirit of3 the Convention, the binding instruments, so far as the Persian Gulf is ■concerned, are the treaty engagements and other Agreements referred to in para, 3 above. Arms Traffic in the Gulf, 1908-1928. (a) 1908-1919. 8. The question of most importance during this period is the suppression, in 1912, of the arms traffic from Muscat. The history of this question, and of the successful efforts made by His Majesty's Government to establish control over the traffic, is given in paras. 7 to 16 of the Memorandum on Muscat _ on page H, and it is not proposed to deal with it in detail here. -Suffice it to say that, after lengthy negotiation, an arrangement was reached with the Sultan in May 1912, under which Bis Highness, In return for certain considerations, and for the payment of certain compensation, agreed to establish in his State a bonded warehouse under efficient control, to be in charge of a trustworthy person from among his subjects, in Avhich all arms and ammunition should be deposited on importation. Issues from the warehouse were to be regulated by licences prepared by the Superintendent and countersigned by the Sultan personally, and such licences were to be issued only to individual purchasers or their authorised agents, subject to satisfactory proof that the issue involved was free from justifiable objection, and were not to be issuable to traders. After long diplomatic discussions, the regulations in question were recognised by the French Government in February 1914, and from that date the arms traffic in Muscat—save possibly in certain areas of the Batineh coast, on which the Sultan's writ does not run—may be regarded as under effective control. 9. The closing of Muscat to the arms traffic disposed of the most serious problem. But the conquest of Hasa in 1913 by Ibn Saud, and the reduction of effective Turkish authority in the peninsula of El Katr, which from 1910-11, consequent on the action taken by His Majesty's Government to prevent smuggling from the Muscat coast to Persian Makran, had become an important centre for tbe arms traffic, afforded new openings to the trade which called for the attention of His Majesty's Government. 10. No undertaking as regards the arms traffic was secured from Ibn Saud either in the Treaty of December 1915 or in the Treaty of Jeddah of May 1927, but the dominions of the Ruler of Nejd do not seem to have given rise to serious difficulty in this connection between 1908 and 1928. ' The outbreak of the war similarly reduced for the time the seriousness of the problem presented by El Katr ; the Sheikh, under his Treaty of 3rd November 1916 with the Government of India, undertook the same obligations in regard to the suppression of the arms traffic as had already been undertaken in 1902 by the other Trucial Chiefs, and no incident of importance occurred in connection with the trade during the remaining years of the European War. (b) 1919-1928. 11. The Naval authorities in the Persian Gulf reported in December 1920 that the present situation of the arms traffic indicated that, failing effective action to suppress the trade, a recrudescence of what took place before the war was probable. The chief centre of the traffic w T as reported to be Koweit, c. in c., e. indies, El Katr and the Trucial Sheikhdom of Dabai being minor centres ; the chief t0 Adm'., Jan. 25 markets were southern Persia and Mesopotamia, with a continuous but 1921 ' p - 1412 - :small infiltration of arms info Persian Baluchistan ; and the line followed by the traffic was principally across the Gulf to the south Persian coast near Lingah. 12. His Majesty's Government took a serious view of the danger of any revival of the trade, and as a result a conference of the interested authorities was held in Karachi in August 1921. The conclusions reached by the h.c. iraq to c.o., conference were that, while available figures showed no immediate marked p u ff}04 1921 ' increase in the traffic, traders were watching their opportunity; that the Tel. from viceroy large collection of arms now in Arabia was a source of future potential to s - o£ s - for L ' danger; and that it was thanks solely to the activity otHis Majesty's ships, r ^ sS . 3921 ' which, were closely watching the traffic and periodically searching dhows, that there had not been any material increase in the traffic.13. To deal with the matter the Conference recoramencled the main tenance of the existing naval forces in the Gulf; the application of pressure to the local Sheikhs ; the grant of authority immediately to establish a motor boat coastal patrol should an increase of the traffic take place; the establishment of a wireless installation at Koweit; and the making of efforts to persuade the Sheikh of Koweit to establish registration of arms on the lines accepted in Muscat in 1912. Naval c in c 14. The death in March 1921 of Sheikh Salim of Koweit had removed e . indies, to Adm., the principal figure in the arms traffic, and the succession of Sheikh Ahmad- Mar211921,p. 1795. e ]_.j a |3i r afforded an opportunity to apply pressure to the Principality in the matter (cp. para. 3 of Koweit Memorandum on p. 2J). view and of the finding of the Conference that the trade in arms was relatively insignificant, the Government of India and His Majesty's Government decided that the problem was not sufficiently serious to justify special expenditure on wireless or special coastal motor boats, and that existing arrangements were probably adequate to meel it. 15. That decision has been justified by events. The new Sheikh of Koweit TeL from f^i R cs. ^ag actively co-operated with His Majesty's Government in the suppression May 11925, 0 p. 1345. of the arms traffic since his accession in 1921; by 1925 the Political Resident was able to report (in connection with the deliberations of the Arms Traffic Conference at Geneva) that the trade, whether to Makran or to the littoral between the Shatt-al-Arab and Lingah, was relatively unimportant; Pol. Res. to g . of i., in April 192G it was decided that the maintenance of the telephone and p a i909 1925 ' patrol establishment instituted on the Makran coast in 1907 in connection with the abolition of the arms traffic was no Jonger necessary; and while in the same year the efforts of the Persian Government to disarm their Poi. Res. to Gr. of i., subjects on the south Persian coast led to a temporary increase of smuggling from that coast to Trucial Oman (in connection with the suppression of which His Majesty's Government agreed that, provided they reported their captures, the Trucial Chiefs might be authorised to retain, for the use of their own military forces, such arms and ammunition as w r ere seized by them), the reports of the local authorities have otherwise shown year by year a consistent decrease in the trade, to which the exhaustion of the supply of arms on the Arab coast has doubtless contributed. March 18 1926, P. 1418. I.O. to g. of I., Sept. 23 1926, P. 3106. Summary. 16. While a continual vigilance is necessary, the problem at the present day is one of inconsiderable dimensions, and the engagements existing' between His Majesty's Government and the rulers of the Arab littoral and Persia, coupled with the presence of His Majesty's ships, are adequate, if strictly interpreted, to keep it within bounds. On the Persian littoral it is, moreover, definitely to the interest of the Persian Government that it should be reduced, to the lowest possible level, but Persia is only slowly establishing her authority in Persian Baluchistan ; she is for practical purposes impotent by sea; and so far as she is concerned the trade is kept under thanks to the efforts of His Majesty's Government. An international undertaking on the lines of the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, if ratified and put into force, would afford a valuable additional obstacle to any recrudescence of the trade. But even in the absence of such an undertaking, the fact that the Convention of 1919 was signed f if not ratified, by the principal arms exporting countries other than the United States of America, has the advantage of reducing substantially the danger of obstructive action such as that taken by France in the early years of the period now under consideration in connection with the arms traffic in Muscat. India Office, 8th October 1928. J. G. L.CONFIDENTIAL. Note on Trade in the Persian Gulf, {Communicated hy the Board of Trade.) Sections (a) and (6) revised to 26th July 1928. Section (c) to 30th June 1928. (a) General. When the Foreign Office Memorandum of 1908 was written, .British preoccupations in connection with the Persian Gulf mainly centred upon German competition and the help which this would receive from the construction of the Bagdad Railway. Russian designs, which had previously given rise to anxiety, had lost importance through the destruction of the Russian fleets in the Russo-Japanese War. In the last 20 years the situation has undergone fundamental changes, but the threats to our present well-established trade ascendancy in those regions still come from Germany and Russia, thoiigh at present they are scarcely more than perceptible. At the same time the^ establishment of economic autonomy in Persia and the abolition of the capitulations certainly tend to impair British influence in that country and will probably make it more difficult for Great Britain to resist favours which Persia seems apt to show to both Germany and Russia, to the former largely because of her fear or jealousy of Great Britain and to Russia because of the extent to which Persia is really at the mercy of that country. ^ On the other hand, the extinction of Turkish sovereignty in all the regions of the Persian Gulf, and the ascendancy of British influence in Iraq, together with oil developments iu that country and Persia, would seem to do more than counterbalance the changes in the other direction which have just been referred to. In view of the change in the general position of Persia referred to above, it would, it is thought, be misleading to treat the trade of the southern Persian ports such as Bushire and Bunder Abbas separately from the general trade of Persia, though it is true that that trade represents the main portion of British trade with Persia other than the oil trade from Abadan and Mohammerah. It may suffice to note here that owing largely, of course, to the oil trade in question, the share of the total trade of Persia which the British Empire participates in is now a good deal larger than it was before the war. The following are the chief features from this point of view :— Froportion of Persian Trade as divided between the Chief Participating Countries (Exports and Lmports). British Empire (including India) Russia _ _ _ Germany - - - United States Egypt Turkey 1913-4. 1923-4. Per cent. Per cent. 21 57 60 18 3 1 1 4 4 4 5 n Iraq It may be added that for recent years the ports on the Persian Gulf have dealt with about half the total trade of Persia, but here again oil accounts for the greater portion of this trade, and the figures for Bushire and Lingah and Bunder Abbas alone give a total of some 250,000,000 krans out of a total of 780,000,000. These figures may be regarded as supplementary to those given in the Board of Trade Memorandum of 30th June, which gives the latest figures of Persian imports and also those for imports into Iraq. In the latter case the British proportion of' the trade, including that with India, is well over 50 per cent., and in neither case has German or American trade reached at all a large proportion, though it will be noted that in the case of trade with Persia there has been a steady increase in the last three years, 1925-7, in imports into Persia. Russia, it is well known, is making strong attempts to increase her trade with Persia, which is, of course, not illegitimate having regard to her much greater pre-war trade with that country, but it seems unlikely that she will be able to oust British trade to any very serious extent. These are matters, of 3134 a 50 10.28, Avliich current reports from the men on the spot are most valuable. As regards those ports in the Persian Gulf which are under British protectorate, the Foreign Office Memorandum gives particulars in the section on Commerce only in respect of Bahrein. The most recent figures for the trade of that port which the Board of Trade has been able to obtain are those in respect of the year ending 31st March 1926, and according to these figures, whereas the total imports into Bahrein in 1906 were Rs. 2,45,55,392, in 1925-6 they were valued at £1,621,869 (£1,818,012 in previous 12 months). As regards the distribution of this trade, India accounted for £1,210,223 and the Arab coast for £209,784. Neither Russia nor Germany nor the United States of America sent anything in that year, but in the previous year the imports^ from the United States of America and Germany were £27,295 and £386 respectively; the figure for the United Kingdom was £27,723 (year before £11,079). The exports, which consisted largely of re-exports to other places in Arabia and also in the shipment of pearls and specie to India, amounted to £1,154,777 as against Rs. 2,27,62,810 in 1906. Shipping at Bahrein in 1925-6 was much on the same lines as in 1906. It was .all under the British flag (106) except for 7 German ships and 1 Greek ship. In 1906 there were 71 British ships, 4 German and 1 American. Similar overwhelming predominance of British shipping is maintained at other ports—for example, at Bunder Abbas in 1925 all shipping was British (123) except for 6 German and 1 French vessel, whereas in 1906 there were 7 German and 10 Russian vessels calling ■at the port. At Lingah in 1925 all shipping was British (85) except 5 German vessels; at Bushire in 1923-4 out of 169 vessels visiting the port 164 were British, 3 Japanese and 2 Chinese as compared with a total of 168 in 1906, out of which 153 were British, 8 German and 5 Russian. The complete development of the Persian Gulf economically must still, it seems, most probably depend upon the provision of railway communication from the West x6 the head of the Gulf either through the completion of the Bagdad Railway or, which from some points of view would appear to present considerable advantages, by the construction of a desert railway joining Bagdad to a Mediterranean port such as Haifa. Such a railway communication would develop a natural route for the trade between the Middle East and India on the one hand and Central Europe or Mediterranean countries on the other for relatively expensive goods which can afford to pay railway charges as compared with shipping freights. Finally, now T that the political dangers associated with the Central Europe Drang nach Osten may presumably be regarded as largely eliminated, and that British influence in Bagdad is well established, the policy of the open door for the legitimate trade of all other -countries in the Persian Guif can presumably be allowed full application in regard to such railway developments, and also generally, it being left to British traders and to the services which already exist, for aiding them to maintain and even improve their own position and connections in those parts of the world. (6) Koweit and Muscat. The total trade of Koweit for the year ended 31st March 1925 was over £1,000,000, divided between £496,000 imports and £547,000 exports, of which the trade with India accounted for £373,000 imports and £298,000 exports, the rest being with the Arab coast, Iraq and Persia. This level of trade was not maintained in 1926 and 1927, and for the latter year (ended 31st March 1927) had fallen off to £348,000 imports and £92,000 exports, the latter figure being so low owing to the failure of the pearl fisheries, which had accounted for £189,000 in 1924-5. The imports from India were made up chiefly of piece-goods, rice, tea and sugar. The chief exports were of rice, sugar and piece-goods to other Persian Gulf ports by -sailing craft. Of the shipping calling at Koweit during the year 1926-7 all the steamers except one were British (84), the one exception being a German steamer. There was a great deal of sailing vessel traffic at the port, including over 1,000 entrances and clearances of both Iraqi (1,300) and Persian (1,200) craft. The trade of Muscat during the years 1924-5, 1925-6 and 1926-7 reached the following totals:—£613,000, £674,0(30 and £474,000 respectively, in which the imports predominated, being generally twice the amount of exports. The trade is almost wholly with India, the figures for 1926-7 being £290,000 imports from India and £111,000 exports to India. The trade with the United Kingdom is smcilh consisting in 1926-7 of £9,405 imports. The chief imports from India are rice, cotton goods and coffee. The chief exports to that country are dates and dry sardines. (fj3 There is very little trade with foreign countries beyond the Persian Gulf. The United States of America took considerable quantities of dates (Fard) in 1924-5, value £38,748, but this trade had fallen to £12,896 in 1926-7. The trade of Muscat was entirely carried in British (including Indian) vessels in 1926-7, except for 2 Arab sailing vessels. There were 117 British steamers aggregating 400,000 net tonnage entering and clearing during that year, as well as 62 Indian sailing vessels aggregating 8,000 tons net, and the 2 Arab vessels referred to (of 270 tons net). (c) The position of British Trade in the Gulf. The first section of this Note deals in general terms with the question of trade in the Gulf: the second in some detail with the position of Koweit and Muscat. The present section deals principally with the British trade position and with the possible advantage or disadvantage to be derived from a purely political movement such as a formal reassertion of the special interest in the Gulf of His Majesty's Government. British trade with the Persian Gulf consists of trade with (1) Persia (nearly all our trade with Persia is via the south, trade over the northern frontier being predominantly trade with Russia); (2) Iraq; and (3) Arab States. The last branch of our trade is relatively insignificant, but trade with Persia and Iraq is of substantial .magnitude, as the following figures for 1927 show : — Imports into the United Kingdom. Exports from the United Kingdom. United Kingdom Produce and Manufactures. Re-exports. Persia Iraq Muscat and Trucial Oman Other native Arab States £ 9,449.000 1,708,000 9,000 6,000 £ 2,247,000 3,680,000 15,000 147,000 1 £ 170,000 142,000 1,000 1,000 Details for 1927 are wanting, but in 192() out of imports from Persia, amounting in value to £7;856,000, no less than £7,213,000 represented oil, crude and refined, other imports being gum, skins, dates, barley and carpets. Imports from Iraq in the same year amounted to £852,000, the principal headings being dates (£262,000) undressed leather (£145,000) and carpets (£103,000). The predominant exports to Iraq are cotton manufactures, which also figure largely in our exports to Persia. They are, however, less than the similar exports to Iraq, and in 1926 were exceeded in value by the exports of iron and steel manufactures whilst exports of machinery were also considerable. The following figures show the exports under each of these headings and the total exports to Persia and Iraq respectively in 1926 :— Exports of the Produce and Manufactures of the United Kingdom in 1926. Persia. Iraq. Cotton manufactures Iron and Steel manufactures Machinery .. Other goods .. £ 469,000 540,000 294,000 698,000 £ 1,584,000 144,000 199,000 903,000 2,001,000 2,830.000 In spite of our undoubted Treaty rights Russian goods admitted into Persia over the Northern frontier have for some years enjoyed the advantage of a lower tariff than that extended to British goods admitted over the Southern frontier, but Persia about a month ago introduced a Uniform tariff applicable to all frontiers and concluded a treaty with us by virtue of which British goods are secured against any form of customs discrimination. This Treaty is concluded for a period of eight years and we have •every reason to hope that its provisions will be respected. Iraq was placed under our Mandate by the Treaty of Versailles and by the terms -of that Treaty and the mandate we were also secured against discrimination. The4 mandate has itself been replaced by a specific Treaty between Great Britain and Iraq based bowever on the provisions of tbe mandate and equality of treatment for our goods is, therefore, assured in that country also. So long as this Treaty position can be maintained, it is difficult to see how any further advantage to our general trade would arise from any such purely political movement as a declaration of our predominant interest in the Peisian Gulf, such as that respecting the interests of the U.S.A. in the American Continent which is embodied in the Monroe declaration. The only thing that can be said is that it would of course be to our great disadvantage if at any time either State should be induced to depart from this attitude and to give special preferences to some other country than ourselves. This, however, implies rather the desirability of maintaining the policy of the 'open door' than either the necessity or desirability of an announcement of our special interest in the countries neighbouring on the Gulf.

PRIOR to the recent negotiations with Persia, which resulted in the signature of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty of the 10th May last, the Treaty rights of British ships in Persia were those conferred by Article 4 of the Anglo-Persian Agreement of 1920, which provided, in effect, for most-favoured-nation and national treatment in all matters relating to Navigation for the ships of either party in the territories of the other. This arrangement went further than any existing Treaty between this country and any other foreign Power, in that it applied in full to the coasting trade as well as to the foreign trade. It had, incidentally, the effect of conferring upon Persian vessels an absolute right to engage in the coasting trade in this country, and vice versa, and was the only surviving case in which such an absolute Treaty right and obligation existed. The general practice which has been followed in our other Commercial Treaties has been to exclude the coasting trade from the scope of the clauses providing for national treatment of ships, but to grant, and to require, most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of the coasting trade. Accordingly, the result of the Anglo-Persian Agreement, when taken in conjunction with all the other most-favoured-nation Treaties ai^d arrangements, is that not only Persian ships, but ships of other Powers with which we have treaties in force, have an absolute right to partake in the coasting trade of the United Kingdom, even though, as is often the case, they themselves reserve their own coasting trade to national ships. Although we may not have any intention of closing the coasting trade in this country to any foreign vessels at the present time, it is obviously desirable that the obligation to allow all foreign vessels to participate therein should be got rid of, as it is clearly unreasonable that we should remain thus bound by treaty in a world in which so large a number of the principal maritime Powers exclude British ships from this trade. On the other hand, in Persia itself our ships have enjoyed this facility, .and whatever it may be worth it seems desirable to hold on to it if possible. Taking, therefore, both of these considerations into account, an effort was made during the recent negotiations with Persia which led to the conclusion of the Tariff Autonomy Treaty to induce the Persian Government to accept a Protocol to the Treaty to the effect that existing Treaties should not be held to confer on the vessels of either party the right to participate in the coasting trade of the other, but that British ships were to continue to be allowed to engage in the Persian coasting trade so long as Persian vessels were allowed in the coasting trade of the United Kingdom. The Persians appear not to have understood this proposal, or, at any rate, to have disliked it, and time being short it was dropped in favour of the maintenance of the status quo which was effected in an exchange of Notes. The present position, therefore, pending the conclusion of a new Commercial Treaty, remains the same as it has been for many years past. Although the solution suggested by His Majesty's Government is no doubt the best from the point of view of British interests, for it gets rid of a Treaty anomaly whilst maintaining our rights in Persia until such time at least as we decide to close our own coasting trade, it is perhaps not altogether surprising that it did not appeal to the Persian mind, as it is not based on any real reciprocity, even in form, and the open coasting trade of the United Kingdom is of no practical value whatever to Persia. As will be seen from the annexed Note on the extent of our shipping interests in Persia, the coasting trade of Persia is of no very great importance to us, and although we might in the forthcoming negotiations for a new Treaty of Commerce and Navigation put forward a proposal similar to that made in connection with the Tariff Autonomy negotiations, namely, that British vessels should be permitted to engage in the Persian coasting trade so long as Persian vessels are permitted to engage in the coasting trade in this country, it would not involve any great sacrifice if this clause had to be dropped and we were left in the same position as we are in the case of most countries with which we have Commercial Treaties. We shall, therefore, no doubt, in.these negotiations do well to be satisfied with the navigation clauses which are contained in our usual Treaties, including one which will have the effect of excepting the coasting trade from the operation of the clauses providing for national treatment of ships whilst securing most-favoured-nation rights. There is in any 3134 b 50 10.287 2 case no great likelihood of Persia seeking to close her coasting trade to British ships in the near future, as certain other Powers have done, as there is reason to think that she recognises the advantages of the services in this matter performed by British shipping, and so long as our ships have equal rights with those of any other foreign nationality the existing position is likely to be maintained, Persian shipping being inadequate 'for the purpose. _ . . . It .should perhaps be observed that the coasting trade, which is spoken of in this memorandum is the coasting trade in the strict sense, that is to say (in the case of Persia) the carriage from one Persian port to another of Persian goods or Persian passengers. It does not, of course, include the voyages from one Persian port to another of ships engaged in the foreign trade for the purpose of landing at a succession of such ports persons or cargoes brought from abroad, or taking up at a succession of such ports persons or cargoes bound for a foreign destination. It is of great importance to British shipping that the right to continue trade of this description should be maintained, and provisions to this effect are always included in our Treaties. Board of Trade, S.W.1, August 20, 1928. Annex. Share of British Shipping in the Persian Coasting Trade. The bulk of the overseas trade of Persia is carried in British ships, as is shown by the following figures, taken from the Persian Official Report for the year 1925-26, the latest period for which statistics are available. These figures show the nett tonnage of ships cleared outwards from Persian ports, and the quantity of cargo exported in these ships :— (Thousands of tons.) Flag*. Nett tonnage. Cargo exported. British ... ... ... 8,981 4,549 Persian ... ... ... 132 35 German ... ... ... 133 7 Other ... ... ... 58 9 Total 9,354 4,600 It is, therefore, probable that a large proportion of the coastwise traffic between Persian ports is in practice carried in British ships. From the information available, it seems certain that the total volume of this traffic is quite small, compared with the volume of the sea-borne traffic between Persia and other countries, but exact figures are not available. The only line which can be regarded as having a regular service in the Persian coasting trade is the British India Line, which runs two weekly services from Bombay and Karachi to the Persian Gulf. One of these, the ' fast mail'' service, touches only at Bushire, Mohammerah and Basra, but the other, the ' subsidiary mail service, touches at about a dozen ports in the Persian Gulf, zigzagging from one side of the gulf to the other. The majority of these ports, Charbar, Jask, Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Bushire, Mohammerah, are in Persia. In addition, there are one or two Indian-owned steamers which make occasional voyages from Bombay and Karachi to the Persian Gulf, and a certain number of Indian country craft (native sailing vessels) engage from time to time in this trade. The British India Company are obtaining from India particulars of the amount of traffic (passenger and cargo) which they carry in their ships between Persian ports, but they think that the total volume of this traffic is small; and, though they would, of course, be sorry to lose it, it is not of great importance to them.CONFIDENTIAL. Oil Interests in the Persian Gulf. Communicated hy the Board of Trade and revised to 28 June 1928. THE countries bordering the Persian Gulf in which oil is being produced are Persia and Iraq. In Persia the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have a concession which covers the whole of the country except the northern provinces. The Standard Oil have taken an interest in the latter and there have b^en suggestions for a concession to be worked jointly with the Anglo-Persian but nothing has been done, mainly no doubt because the district is too remote to be a profitable source of supply. In Iraq the Anglo-Persian are working a concession in the ' transferred territories ' on the Iraq-Persian frontier and the Turkish Petroleum Company (in which there are British, Dutch, American and French interests) have a concession for the remainder of Iraq (except the Basra Vilayet, which is not likely to be oil bearing) on terms which, after the Turkish Petroleum Company have selected certain areas for exploitation, allow other companies to bid at auctions for other areas. There is some evidence of the existence of oil on the Arabian littoral of the Gulf,, the Arab rulers of which are precluded by their treaty engagements from granting any oil concessions save with the prior approval of His Majesty's Government, but none is being worked. At one time the Standard Oil had their eyes on Koweit but apparently dropped them. The Anglo-Persian obtained permission to make a geological survey, but have not been able to negotiate a concession with the Sheikh. The ' Eastern and General Syndicate ' have a concession for the Bahrein Islands but so far as we know have not produced any oil. (By an undertaking of May 1914 the Sheikh of Bahrein is precluded from granting oil concessions for his territory without prior approval of His Majesty's Government.) Thus in Persia and an adjacent part of Iraq a British oil company is firmly established, in the remaining oilfields of Iraq an international company has a concession which contains a clause purporting to maintain the 44 open door,' after that company has selected certain areas, and on the Arabian shores of the Persian Gulf where the rulers are in treaty relations with us making their territories more or less protectorates there is at present no great interest from the point of view of oil. We now obtain one quarter of our total imports of petroleum, crude and refined^ from Persia, the bulk of this being crude oil to be refined here, while nearly the whole of our imports from other countries are refined oil. (I) As an industry affording employment in this country, oil refining is of small importance, and, in any case, it is not essential for its maintenance that the raw material should come from Persia. (2) His Majesty's Government are financially interested, in the prosperity of the Anglo- Persian Company, but this is a slender basis for a Monroe doctrine. (3; Oil is an essential commodity, but Persia produces only 3 per cent, of the world s output, and we cannot say that in peace it is vital that this country should be able to draw upon Persian supplies. The importance of the Persian Gulf from the oil point of view is therefore entirely a war question. In considering war requirements, the assumption has been that we should have control of the Persian output, and Admiralty plans would require considerable revision if this source of supply were closed to the Navy. Its importance would depend, of course, to some extent on the particular enemy and the theatre of war, and the position might be affected by the construction of a pipe line from the Iraq oilfields through Palestine to the Mediterranean, but in present circumstances the Admiralty would regard virtual control of Persia's output as of great importance in any considerable war. The closing to us of Persian sources would have reactions affecting civil supplies. The whole question of sources of oil supply in war is under consideration by a sub-committee of the C.I.D. 3134c 50 10.28CONFIDENTIAL. B. 414. P. 5519/26. Air Communications in the Persian Gulf. {Commumcated by the Air Ministry and revised to 23rd August 1928.) The necessity for an organised air route for British aircraft, both Service and Civil, to connect Egypt and Iraq with India, has long been realised; and the negotiations and technical preparations necessary to this end have been proceedino- ever since the end of the Great War, though not without numerous difficulties and delays. It is practicable to organise an air route along either shore of the Gulf. The route along the Persian shore is the better, since the Arabian shore route includes an oversea flight of some 226 miles. The latter route also entails the nse of landing grounds on the Hasa and Trucial coasts, and on this account, under the conditions obtaining at the present time, would afford less security for passengers and aircraft than the Persian route. These conditions, however, may be expected to improve. Though the Persian route is the better for a regular civil passenger air service,, the Arabian shore route, whether ultimately used as a civil air route or not is reqmred as a strategic air route for Service aircraft which might be unable bv reason of Persian neutrality to nse the Persian route. The history of the development of these two routes is related in the following paragraphs. A map of the routes is attached. The Air Route along the Persian Shore. Flights along the route. The first flight between Iraq and India along this route took place in December 1918, and was carried out by a Service aircraft of the Royal Air Force. Ihe Persian Government had at that time little control of their coast line, and the question of obtaining permission for the flight did not then arise. The landing grounds w hich were required for this flight were prepared by Royal Air Force personnel, and are those which have been nsed np to the present time (1928X 1 ms route was foUowed in 1919 by the pioneer long-distance flights to'the East, and in 1^0 a Flight of Royal Air Force aircraft from Iraq was based at Bushire to assist the British Resident in the maintenance of order. This Flight was withdrawn m the autumn of 1921 when it became necessary to concentrate all available aircraft m Iraq. Since that date the air route along the Persian shore has been used at irreo-ular intervals by both British and foreign aircraft. Several flights have been carried out by bervice aircraft of the Royal Air Force, but most of the flights have been bv civil aircraft. The Association of the Government of India with the route. The following extracts from the memorandum by the Indian Air Board, prepared l n ent ^ e( l ' The Past History and Future Development of Civil Aviation in India, describe the association of the Indian Government with the Persian route along the Gulf :— ' The ^ question of linking India with the outer world by a line of air communications was first raised in June 1919, when a scheme was put forward by the Air Ministry for the establishment of an air service between Cairo and Karachi. The objects of this scheme were mainly military, though the carriage of mails was also contemplated. The Government of India supported the proposals, and, on the understanding that a weekly service would be instituted, agreed to provide and maintain the necessary aerodromes and buildings from Karachi to Bushire, at an estimated cost of Rs. 13j lakhs initial and Rs. 36,000 recurring. The British Government were to be responsible for providing'the necessary machines, the pay and maintenance of the unit, the cost of flying and any other liabilities. It was considered at the time that Karachi must eventually be the aerial gateway of India, and it was realised that, even should the proposed service not be a success, Government would have a permanent asset in the aerodromes and buildings there, upon which it was anticipated that some 80 per cent, of their contribution would be spent. 3133 75 10.28 A' Before, however, any action was taken in the matter, the British Government decided to abandon the proposal for the carriage of mails by the suggested service. It would, they decided, be preferable to deal with the scheme as a military proposition, pure and simple, leaving the question of the inauguration of a civil mail service for separate consideration. As it had, in the inearitirae, been decided independently, as part of the Royal Air Force organisation, too establish an aircraft depot at Karachi, the only extra expenditure involved in the ' proposal in which, on the analogy of the previous arrangements, India was interested, was that to be incurred at Bushire, Bunder Abbas, and Charbar, estimated, on the reduced scale possible owing to the less ambitious nature of the scheme, to cost about Rs. I lakh. The Government of India agreed, as with other similar charges in Persia, to bear half this expenditure. But the military service has never, in fact, been extended to India ; it has been confined to the section Cairo-Baghdad, and consequently the anticipated expenditure upon the Persian Gulf aerodromes has not been incurred. ' The proposed civil mail service over the route was the subject of discussion between the British and Indian Governments in 1920, and the latter, althougli they were, in the conditions then obtaining, somewhat sceptical of its prospects of success, declared themselves ready, if the scheme matured, to adhere to the undertaking which they had given in the previous year, which involved their bearing the whole cost of the depot at Karachi and half that of the three principal aerodromes in the Persian Gulf. They also offered to guarantee a sum of Rs. I lakh per annum for three years towards the deficit in the working of the mail service. This offer was, however, never accepted, as, owing to unsettled conditions in Arabia and Mesopotamia, the whole proposal was dropped. It was, however, realised that, even in the absence of such a service, India had a genuine interest in the upkeep of a connecting link, for use when necessary, between the Middle East and Karachi, and in 1921 Government agreed and have continued to make a small contribution to the maintenance of the aerodromes at Bushire, Bunder Abbas, and Charbar, equivalent to halt the actual expenditure upon them, limited to £850 for capital and '£100 for annual recurring charges. This, together with a similar contribution from the British Government, has sufficed for the provision of absolutely essential facilities in the shape of go-downs, &amp;c., for the repairs periodically required, and for the pay of the necessary watch and ward establishment.' The attitude of Persia towards the use of the route by a regular Civil Air Service. Persia adhered to the International Convention for Air Navigation in 1920, the Persian Minister in Paris being instructed by his Government to notify the Government of the French Republic of the adherence, at the same time stating that the Persian Government ' reserves the right to prepare as and when it becomes possible the means and the new organisations which the execution of the clauses of the said Convention necessitate.' Although ihe Mejlis has, however, never officially ratified this adherence, Persia has sent official representatives to many of the meetings of the International Oommission for Air Navigation and has paid almost up-to-date her contributions towards the expenses of the Commission. Consequently, there would appear to be no doubt that Persia is in fact a party to the International Air Convention of 1919. i Persia, however, has done little towards taking steps to give effect to her adherence to the Convention either in the direction of ground organisation or of air regulations. However, in connection with the fulfilment of her obligations she proceeded to give general notification of certain routes through her territory along which flying could take place. At our request the route along the Persian shore of the Gulf was included in the possible routes. Objection has never been taken by Persia to individual flights of civil aircraft over her territory, but she has taken exception to the operation by Imperial Airways, Limited, of a regidar service along the Persian Gulf, though at a later date she offered to allow the operation of a service along one of the other notified routes through Central Persia. During 1925 a fortnightly civil air service between Cairo and Karachi, to be operated by Imperial Airways, Limited, was projected. The use. for this service, of a route through Central Persia was considered, but owing to the difficulty and expense of supplying landing grounds with fuel and stores this route was not considered3 practicable. Negotiations were opened with the Persian Government, who agreed that representatives of the Air Ministry and of Imperial Airways, Limited, should fly .aloncr the Gulf in a service aircraft of the Royal Air Force to investigate local conditions. This reconnaissance was carried out in the autumn of 1925, and in September of that year Air Vice-Marshal Sir Sefton Brancker, the Director of Civil ^Vviation, visited Tehran with a view to assisting the British Minister, Sir Percy Lioraine, in arranging an agreement for the service with the Persian Government. A satisfactory agreement was concluded in less than a week, largely owing to the cordial relations existing between Riza Khan (then Prime Minister of Persia) and Sir Percy Loraine. The Persian representatives reaffirmed their desire to conform to the terms of the International Air Convention. They were very definite in their view that the ground organisation of the route must be Persian, but indicated that it was impossible for Persia to contribute towards the cost of it. Notes were exchanged in which it was agreed (subject to ratification by the Mejlis of the International Air Convention) to allow Imperial Airways, Limited, to operate a fortnightly service, the British Government undertaking to provide any sheds, buildings and wireless equipment necessary. These items were to become Persian property when completed, with the exception of the wireless equipment, which was to be sold to Persia on a basis of periodic payments. It was indicated during these negotiations that the E^ersians were ready within their limitations to give effect to their obligations under the Convention to afford liberty of innocent passage across their territory and to provide facilities therefor. The ratification by the Mejlis of the Convention, however, was deferred through 1926 in spite of the endeavours of the British Minister, and this fact was used as a pretext for withholding permission for the operation of the service by Imperial Airways between Basrah and Karachi. Meanwhile, work on the organisation of the route began ; measures were taken for the erection of huts and the installation of petrol tanks; and wireless equipment was delivered. _ In December 1926 the Persian Government gave orders that work on the ground organisation of the route must cease and that the service could not be permitted. In January 1927 Air Vice-Marshal Sir Sefton Brancker again visited Tehran, where Sir Robert Clive had just arrived as British Minister. Conferences were held and promises were made that the Convention would be ratified at an early date.^ Subsequently, however, it became clear that the Persian Government had in fact at that time no intention of carrying out their agreement. It would appear that their attitute was due to three reasons :— (i) The route would be of no great value to Persia herself. (ii) The Persian Government did not wish the route to be administered by foreigners and feared the responsibility and cost of administering it themselves. (iii) The Persian Government were afraid that the regular operation of a British civil air service would increase British influence in the Persian Gulf. The discussion reached a deadlock, which persisted until it became possible to bring pressure to bear on the Persians to reopen the negotiations under the terms of the new treaty with Persia concluded in the spring of the present year (1928). ^ Following on a visit to Tehran by the General Manager of Imperial Airways, Limited, in June 1928, the Persian Government has agreed to allow the Company as from January 1929 to operate a limited service along the route, using only Bushire and Jask as aerodromes and Lengeh as an emergency landing ground. The Persian Government have said, categorically, that permission will not be renewed after a period of three years has expired, which in their opinion should .allow the Company time to study the possibilities of operating a Central Persian route through Tehran, the route which they wish followed. The Persian Government also insist on retaining the ground organisation for the three years' service along the Persian Gulf in their own hands, including the provision of petrol installations and the provision and operation of the wireless service. This offer, which has several very undesirable restrictions attaching to it, is now receiving the consideration of the Air Ministry and Imperial airways. Limited, The Air Route along the Arabian Shore. It is desired for this air route to establish refuelling grounds at intervals of about 200 miles and emergencv landing grounds at intervals of 30 — oO miles. It would not1 be necessary normally for aircraft to refuel at all these landing grounds, but at certain times of year strong adverse winds are encountered in these regions and may make an intermediate landing necessary for fuel. The route is described below by sections. At the present time flights have onhr 1 been made over the Kuwait and Hasa sections between Iraq and Bahrein. Thesfa sections have not yet been reconnoitred on the ground, and the ground reconnaissance of several of the other sections has not yet been completed. Kuwait Section. —Kuwait has been visited by Royal Air Force service aircraft at intervals since 1920, and a landing ground near the town is in existence. In 1920 the Shaikh of Kuwait asked for help in the defence oE his territory against the Akhwan. Two aircraft were accordingly despatched to drop leaflets on the Akhwan warning them that offensive action would be taken against them if they made any attempt to attack the town. This had the desired effect. In 1924, when a Royal Air Force aircraft returning from a flight to Bahrein had made a forced landing some distance away on the Kuwait coastline, the Shaikh lent his own cars and staff to go- out to its relief. In the present year (1928;, the Shaikh of Kuwait again asked for our assistance against a threatened Akhwan attack, and a flight of aircraft and section of armoured cars were sent to Kuwait. No Akhwan attack, however, was made. Hasa Section. —The reconnaissance of the Hasa coast section has had to be postponed again and again owing to difficulty in obtaining sanction from Ibn Sand. One refuelling ground in the neighbourhood of Ras-as-Safaniyah and two emergency landing grounds are required. In order that our request might be presented iii the most favourable light, the opportunity was awaited of the visit of Sir Gilbert Clayton to Ibn Saud in May 1927. In reply to our request to carry out the reconnaissance, Ibn Saud asked for more complete information, and it was explained to him through His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Jeddah that we required to make a reconnaissance, on the ground only, for the purpose of selecting sites lor landing grounds, and that aircraft would not use these landing grounds until his agreement had been obtained. Delay ensued, however, in view of the wish expressed by Ibn Saud to send a representative to Hasa to ascertain the local conditions before acceding to our request. His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Jeddah was of the opinion that at this time Ibn Saud was not unfavourably disposed towards the project for an air route ; but was actuated by genuine anxiety for the safety of the reconnaissance party in Ha'sa^ Four months later, in September 1927, a reply was received from Ibn Saud t(h the effect that he could not sanction the reconnaissance owing to the attitude of the Hasa tribes, whose suspicions had been aroused by the establishment of military posts in the southern desert of Iraq. Thereafter, it was the intention that the British Resident, Bushire, should endeavour to obtain permission, and he was instructed to raise the question on the occasion of j his projected interview with Ibn Saud in regard to the Akhwan raid on Busaiyah police post in Iraq in November 192'/. This interview, however, did not take place. I Since that date the Akhwan situation has prevented any further representations being made to Ibn Saud ; and no favourable opportunity occurred for the reopening of the subject during the recent conversations in June '1928 between Sir Gilbert Clayton and Ibn Saud. Bahrein.—No flights were made to Bahrein prior to 1924. Early in that year, in view of the interest aroused locally by the purchase of some foreign aircraft by the Persian Government, the British Resident at Bahrein requested that a flight of service aircraft should visit the island for the purpose of ' showing the flag.' A Royal Aii lorce ground reconnaissance party was sent to the island and a landing ground selected, and in May 1924 a flight of Royal Air Force service aircraft flew from Iraq to Bahrein and made several flights over the island. SLeikh Mahommed of Bahrein was flown and the visit of the aircraft met with a most friendly reception. Ibn Saud objected to this flight on the ground that it caused consternation among his subjects. A reply was sent to the effect that the aircraft did not fly over his territory, but along the coastline, that being the most direct route between Kuwait and Banrem. . No further fiiglits over these sections were made until 1927, when the iourney was- twice flown^by civil aircraft of linperml Airways, Limited. On the first of these occasions a Shaikh Abdul Rahman Qasaibi, who had represented himself as being oneof the principal advisers to Ibn Saud, was carried. It transpired later, however, that this Shaikh had formed an exaggerated view of his own position, and that in giving permission for the flight he had acted without authority. On the occasion of the second flight permission was not sought and the aircraft flew a course outside territorial waters. At about this time (August 1927) enquiries were made of Imperial Airways, Limited, with a view to the operation of a fortnightly flight from Bahrein to Basrah for the transport of pearls. Although this project was abandoned, it is an indication of one of the uses which a civil air route down the Arabian shore could serve. Summary. —As regards the sections between Iraq and Bahrein the present position is therefore that one refuelling ground and two emergency landing grounds have still to be selected before this part of the route can be regarded as fully satisfactory; and arrangements have still to be concluded with Ibn Saud for the carrying out of this reconnaissance, and for the use of the route. Aircraft, however, have already flown between Koweit and Bahrein without requiring to make an intermediate landing. Sections from Bahrein to Muscat. —In March 1927 an Royal Air* Force ground reconnaissance party visited these sections. All the sites required for refuelling grounds were reconnoitred and selected. That is to say, Yas Island, Abu Dhabi, A1 Auhi and Muscat. Of the emergency grounds required, however, it was only possible, owing to the attitude of the minor Shaikhs, to select definitely those in the Batina section (towards Muscat). Attitude of the minor Shaikhs. —The Shaikhs whose authority lies mainly on the coastline and does not extend inland, e.g. the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, and those in the Batina section, which includes A1 Auhi, are under British influence and are at the mercy of any action we might take from the sea. The few inhabitants of Yas Island were also found friendly, and no difficulty, therefore, should arise in establishing the landing grounds required at Yas Island, Abu Dhabi, and in the Batina section. The attitude of the Sultan of Muscat has throughout been most friendly. The Shaikhs, however, whose territory extends further inland are naturally more at the mercy of Ibn Saud and have accepted Wahabism to a greater extent. Thus, the Shaikh of Qatar was opposed to the establishment of a landing ground in his territory, stating to the reconnaissance party that it would place him in great difficulty with the subjects of Ibn Saud, who visited his port in considerable numbers. In regard to his objection, however, it was observed by the British Resident at Bushire that these difficulties might not be found to be insuperable, but might be surmounted by a financial arrangement. The Bariami Shaikh (Oman section) definitely barred the progress of the reconnaissance party, stating that the country belonged to Ibn Saud; and in spite of every effort by the British Wazir of Muscat who accompanied the party, refused to grant permission to proceed and obliged the party to turn northward out of his country to Sharjah. Summary. —On these sections, therefore, between Bahrein and Muscat, the present position (1928) is that the refuelling grounds required have been reconnoitred but the intermediate emergency landing grounds have for the most part not yet been reconnoitred; and it is necessary to arrange for the completion of the reconnaissance and the use of the route. Baluchistan Section. —From Muscat this route leaves the Arabian shore and crosses by a sea flight of 226 miles to the Baluchistan coast at Gwadar. No difficulties are anticipated- in regard to facilities on the Baluchistan section. Tho. Government of India have already agreed to provide a landing ground near Pasni.

I.—Geographical Description of Sur. 1. Sur is a town of about 12,000 inhabitants situated in the province of Jaalan in Oman, about 17 miles west of Has el Hadd and 94 miles south-east of Muscat. 2. The shore at Sur is low and sandy, destitute both of trees and other vegetation. The principal features of the place are a creek with the town standing on both sides of the entrance and a stony ridge called Eed, which rises about 50 feet high from shingly flats and runs from north to south at a distance of 2 miles behind the town. The creek is half a mile long,, 150 .yards wide and only three-quarters of a fathom deep at low water. 3. The town on the east of the creek is called Aiqa and is occupied by the Bani Bu Ali tribe; that on the west is called Muqrimatain and is occupied by four sections of the Jenebeh tribe. The fighting strength of these sections is staled to be as follows :—Arama, 2,000 ; Makhana, 800 Ghialin, 600 ; Fuwaris, 150. 4. Adjoining the north-west end of the stony ridge are Sanaisalah^. occupied by the Bani Sinan, and Shariah, containing 100 houses of the Jenebeh (Arama). 5. On the plain at the back of the ridge, situated about 4 miles from the sea, is Balad As Sur, a stone-built^ village in which the Wali's residence is situated, but in disrepair. There is also a fort named Jinah situ a tea inside Balad As Sur and occupied by the Bani Amr, askaris of the Wali. Stated to be the key to the command of Sur. 6. There are extensive date groves and cultivation of lucerne and about 250 houses of various tribes who supply Sur with vegetables and fodder. 7. Balad As Sur contains about 95 wells and the water supply of Sur is obtained from there daily on donkeys. It was in order to keep the town in check by commanding the water supply that this site was chosen as the Wali's residence. , During hostilities water is also obtained at night with some ditlicuitjr from sweet wells to the south of the creek. 8. According to Lorimer's Gazetteer (Vol. II, p. 1849), there were at one time over 100 Indian traders at Sur, but these numbers gradually dwindled down owing to the insecurity of the place. In 1923 there were 35, at present there are only 20 British subjects in Sur. _ These British merchants are living on sufferance, having to pay blackmail to the various Sheikhs of the Jenebeh in order to avoid being looted. 1 understand that since the kidnapping of a Bania in 1926, Mahomed Bin Naser, Amir of the Bani Bu Ali, has not himself levied anything from the Banias, but that he is suspected of instigating others to do so. 9. The climate of the place is stated to be very equable, and were^it not for the insecurity trade there would be in a very flourishing condition * 10. Unlike Muscat, there are roads suitable for wheeled traffic in Muqrimatain. The track between Muqrimatain and Balad As Sur would require some labour on it near Sanaisalah befoie it could be used for wheeled traffic. v n n -n - ^ nv/r 10 a Sur is the port for the shipment of dates from bharqiyah. Most of these dates are of the Mibsali variety, which is preferred by natives of the country to all other kinds and is much appreciated in India. The trade is a large one, the Badiyah division of Sharqiyah alone containing some 158,000 palms. . , 0 i i * i 10 b . The carrier trade from Sharqiyah to Sur is m the hands ot the Hijriyin tribe, whilst the Jenebeh of' Sur, who are a seafaring tribe and own some 130 dhows, convey them thence to Bombay and other poits. * The total number of Snr dhows is estimated at 150. Most of these belong to the Jenebeh tribe. The Bani Bu Ali own 8 or 10, and a few are owned by the Bani Sinan.4 10c. A small number of Jenebeli belonging to the Majaala section live at Izz near Nezwa, and in former days the Temeemah or Chief Sheikh of the Jenebeh was chosen from this section. He was regarded with veneration, had despotic power, and took 25 per cent, on all bags of dates exported by the tribe. Presumably he acted as agent for the Jenebeh in •Sharqiyah and helped to build up this trade. By 1900 his power had waned and a Sheikh of the Aram a section, who are the largest section in Sur, was recognised as Temeemah. Unfortunately a blood feud, which started in 1913, between the Arama and Fuwaris sections on the one hand and the Makhana and Ghialin on the other, undermined the influence of the Arama Sheikh and Mansur bin Naser of the Majaala section of Masirah Island was elected Temeemah. The influence of this Sheikh over the Arama and Fuwaris sections waned, and he seems to have enlisted the sympathy of the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali tribe for the purpose of regaining his authority. In 1927 he went to Mecca with the brothers of Amir Mahomed bin Naser to visit Ibn Saud, but died of smallpox on the return journey. The Jenebeh, though they bear an evil reputation in slave dealing and piracy, are not a warlike race, and under normal circumstances could) have been kept in control easily enough ; but misrule, internal feuds and French influence have combined to let loose lawless elements amongst them. 10d . The Bani Bu Ali, as a tribe, live in the interior of Jaalan. Their principal port is Lashkharah, but they have a small settlement at Aiqa on the opposite side of Sur creek to the Jenebeh and own about eight or ten 4hows. According to Saiyid Mahomed bin Ahmed, Aiqa formerly belonged to the Hinawi. The Temeemah of the Bani Bu Ali, Mahomed bin Majid, occupied it under their patronage, but Abdullah bin Salim threw off the Hinawi connection and made the place purely a Bani Bu Ali settlement. The Bani Bu Ali are a wild and warlike tribe of ruffians. Thev put up a fight against a Division of Indian troops, and their name is to be found on the colours of a number of Indian regiments. The Sultans of Muscat have never been able to control them, but have often enlisted their assistance during former rebellions, when they have come chiefly for the sake of loot. II.—Historical Summary of the Bani Bu Ali. 11. The Bani Bu Ali tribe of Jaalan are a branch of the great Adnani tribe Bani Temeem. 12. The name Bani Bu Ali appears to be of recent origin, since in the ' History of the Imams and Seyyids of Oman,' by Salil ibn Razik, translated by the Rev. GL P. Badger, they are constantly being referred to as the Beni Temeem, and not as the Bani Bu Ali. 13. The Bani Temeem, one of the most considerable tribes in Arabia, ascribe their origin to Temim—born about A.D. 120—the son of Murr, a descendant of Madhar through Tabikhah, and therefore of the race of Adnan and Maadd. They were dispersed over the north-east of Nejd from the Syrian desert to the borders of the el lamamah. Their territory comprised the vast desert called Dahna, and extended on the south between the confines of A1 Yamamah and el Bahrain. 14. The Bani Bu Ali are accounted the most religious tribe in the Oman Sultanate. They belong to the Wahabi sect known as Azraqah and will not cat meat cooked by others. The founders of the Wahabi, Ibadhi, and lufuyyah sects all belonged to the Beni Temeem, whilst the Harth, the other branch of the Bani Temeem in Oman, have been the principal supporters of the Muttawa or extreme sect of the Ibadhis. 15. In 1807 the Wahabis sent a Joasmee fleet of 22 dhows to attack the fort at Sur, but met with such a spirited resistance on the part of the Jenebeh and Bani Bu Ali that they were driven off with heavy loss. Intrigue accomplished what force failed to do.During the Wahabi invasion of 18.12-3, Salim bin Ali, Temeemaii •Sheildi of the Bani 13ii Ali, became their bnpporter, helping them against the Bani Bu Hassan. In consequence of the part which Salim bin Ali had taken against the Bani Bu Hassan, there was a feud between the two tribes which resulted in a light wherein Salim bin Ali and some of his people were killed ; some of .the Bani Bu Hassan also fell, and as neither side would give in, the war between them continued, and has been carried on more or less constantly ever since. 16. Mahomed bin Ali, who succeeded Salim bin Ali as Temeemah, seceded from the tenets of the Ibadiyah and adopted those of the Wahabi, throwing off the authority of the Imam. 17. In 1820 Saiyid Said, haying heard that Mahomed bin Ali had induced many of the inhabitants of Jaalan to adopt his creed, and that his followers among the A1 Ashkarah had plundered many English ships wrecked there, applied to the English to aid him in an expedition against Mahomed bin Ali and his confederates. The Bani Bu Ali murdered the messenger carrying a letter to the chiefs from the British party investigating reports of piracy near Ras el Hadd. Captain Thompson, in charge of operations, decided to avenge the act, and with a small force consisting of six companies, sailed to Muscat, where plans were made for the Sultan to reinforce him at Sur. The combined force marched on Balad Bani Bu Ali, the capital of the tribe, but proved entirely inadequate, and after attempting to take the town, were sharply repulsed. Six out of eight officers and 270 men were killed. In January 1821 Major-General Sir Lionel Smith sailed with two brigades to restore British influence in the gulf. From Sur, they also marched to Balad Bani Bu Ali, which surrendered after most of the defending force had been killed or captured. The Sheikh, Mahomed bin Ali, was deported to Bombay. (Frontier and Overseas Expeditions from India, Vol. VI.)*- 18. As late as 1815 the Bani Bu Ali were strict if not fanatical in the observance of the Wahabi principles. They have since relaxed something of their rigour and have resumed the smoking of tobacco, but they continue to be exact in their observance of the forms and times of prayer. (Lorimer, Vol. II., p. GG.) 19. In 1854 Sultan Saiyid Said stated that the Bani Bu Ali had long withdrawn from allegiance to him. 20. In the early part of the reign of Saiyid Thoweynee [1856-66] the Bani Bu Ali and the Bani Bu Hassan were almost constantly engaged in petty skirmishes against each other, in which Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim, the grandson of Mahomed bin Ali, at the head of the Bani Bu Ali, generally won the day. About the same time a series of raids was committed by the Wahibah against the Bani Bu Ali, these raids culminating in a serious ■ engagement at Theeleyeh, in which Sheikh Abdulla greatly distinguished himself by totally defeating and routing the enemy.| 21. Towards Saiyid Thoweynee his attitude was that of neutrality, but Saiyid Salim during his reign [1866-8], having had reason to suspect treachery on the part of the Hinawi garrison at Muscat, sent a large present to Sheikh Abdulla and requested his help to defend him in his position. Sheikh Abdulla gladly removed to Muscat with 300 men and garrisoned it, tbut, owing to the vacillatory policy of Saiyid Salim, was dismissed after a stay of four months and returned to Jaalan. Soon after this, Saiyid Azzan- bin-Khais, on coming to power in 1868, summoned him and the other •Sheikhs of the Bani Bu Ali to Muscat to render their submission, and on their having refused to visit him, he marched against the Bani Bu Ali, seized three of the Sheikhs of the tribe and threw them into prison at Muscat. * A gfood description of these operations and the subsequent proceedings is contained in the Annual Administration Reports. 1883-4, page 26. t Abdulla bin Salim was not actually Temeemah of the Bani Bu Ali till 1867, in which year the Temeemah Mahomed bin Majid was murdered; but he certainly took a very prominent part in affairs before that date.6 22. Concerning this expedition Colonel Pel'ly, then Political Resident in the Gulf, wrote at the time (No. 202, dated 3rd November 1809) : ' If Saiyid Azan bin Khais should succeed in his present expedition in the south, he; would l&gt;e likely to strengthen his authority so considerably as to be able to keep a firmer grasp on Muscat territory than any other aspirant to power could.'-' 23. Sheikh Abdulla, however, managed to remain at liberty and thwart the Mutawwa power in every possible way. This led Saiyid Azzan to instigate the Bani Bu Hassan and the A1 Wahibah to wage war against the Bani Bu Ali. A serious engagement took place at Lazzeh, in which Abdulla defeated the two Hinawi tribes, and in revenge for this the Bani Bu Hassan rose again, only to be defeated a second time at !Seh A1 Masaddee. 24. In 1870, Saiyid Turki having requested the help of the Bani Bu Ali, they joined him at Sur, and 200 of their number marched under Sheikh Abdulla and Yusuf against Matrah, where they both took a leading part in scaling the wall and in the engagement which resulted in the death of Saiyid Azzan-bin-Khais, and subsequently restoring order and holding the place till Saiyid Turki's arrival from Sur. In recognition of their services Saiyid Turki granted the Amirs of the Bani Bu Ali exemption from the payment of customs on the goods imported by them into Sur. , 25. In 1874 the Bani Bu Ali had at length amicably adjusted an internecine feud that had been going on amongst themselves for some time. The number of slain on each side being equal, each party forgave the other, and as regards wounded (about 70 in number), the 'blood money was determined by Mahomedan Law. 26. In 1874 Bani Bu Ali of the Ja'afarah section, belonging to Lashkharah, were responsible for the wrongful confinement and subsequent release on ransom of subjects of the Rao of Cutch at Hellanujah Island. Major Miles went to Lashkharah in H.M.S. Fhilomel, and as the surrender of the actual offenders could not be obtained, a fine of $600 was imposed and readily paid at Sur by Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim of the Bani Bu Ali, acting on behalf of the Ja'afarah. 0 27. In 1881 the Bani Bu Ali attacked and defeated the Bani Bu Hassan in their own quarter of Jawabi al Ivhwarah. This engagement was described as the most sanguinary ever fought between Omani tribes, and. is said to have cost 157 killed on both sides. 28. In 1887 the Awlad Kassib kidnapped one Bania at Sur and had severely beaten another. Sheikh Abdulla' bin Salim of his own accord restored the kidnapped Bania and imprisoned five of the Awlad Kassib.t 28 a . In 1888-9 relations between the Bani Bu All and Jenebeli were strained.^ In May 1889 hostilities broke out, which resulted in a fight of some importance. Badr bin Saif, who went there to settle the dispute, reported on return that the Bani bu Ali had agreed to allow the passage of the creek at Sur to remain entirely in the hands of His Highness's officials, and to abide by the decision of the Sultan in all local matters. 29. In 1895 the Bani Bu Ali sent a detachment in support of Saiyid Faisal when he was'attacked at Muscat by Saleh bin Ali, but they made no- determined effort to expel the rebels and recover the capital for their sovereign. In recognition of their services Saiyid Faisal granted the Amirs of the Bani Bu AH an allowance of $100 per mensem. 30.^ In the spring of .1903, the ordinary annual hostilities between the Ghafiris and Hinawis of Sharqiyah being then in progress, Abdulla bin Salim found reason to suspect that the people of Sur, though Ghafiris, were supplying his enemies with the sinews ot war. He accordingly marched down the coast and declared the harbour blockaded until his demands for satisfaction were complied with. After Abdulla had returned to the interior, relations between his supporters in the Aiqa quarter and his opponents in Muqraimatain became so strained that when Major Cox (then # For full details vide ' Narrative of Muscat Affairs,' J 874-5 (sic), para. 343 t The Awlad Kassib were originally a Fakhth of the Jenebeh, but' came under the protection of the Bani Bu Ali.Political Agent, Muscat) arrived there in August he found the two factions' on the point of opening fire on each other across the intervening creek. The' Political Agent, having obtained a truce for 48 hours, returned at once to Muscat and in tor med the Sultan, who immediately proceeded to the spot. The Jenebeh would not at once submit to his mediation, and before proceedings had commenced in earnest the Sultan was called away by serious news from Eustaq; nevertheless, his visit actually averted fighting for the moment, and the dispute was adjusted, not long after, by neutral Sheikhs of the neighbour hood. (Lorimer, Vol. I, p. 580.) 31. In 1913 Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim A1 Alawi died. He was considered a very daring man, well disposed towards the Sultans of Muscat, .and always ready to help them. His eldest son Naser had predeceased him, :and as the latter's son Mahomed was still a minor, Abdulla s second son All. was made Amir jointly with Mahomed bin JNaser. An arrangement which still continues, 32. During the 1913-9 rebellion the Pani Bu Ali took the part of the Sultan, but their behaviour was not altogether satisfactory. They sent the rice given them for their progress inland, to their homes at Sur and also left behind the ammunition, with which the Sultan had provided them, at Muscat for taking to their homes at the first convenient -opportunity, and then on their arrival at Sib were demanding extra supplies of both food and ammunition. They retreated unexpectedly and unaccountably from Bidbid, where they were first established, to Watiyah. On being brought back to Muscat much alarm was felt owing to their reputation for looting and general misbehaviour. Their counsels were divided, they quarrelled bitterly amongst themselves and paid little attention to the authority of their nominal leader, Mahomed bin Naser, and it was only with great difficulty that they could be induced to obey orders of any kind. In one quarrel amongst themselves, which arose over pilfering by some of them in the bazaar 'whom the Sheikh wished to punish, stones and sticks were freely used, with the result that there were several heads broken. Even the Sheikh himself was stoned. 33. Since the time Mahomed bin Naser started to assert his authority, relations between the Amirs and the Sultan have undergone a change. In 1920 the Wazir cut the allowances paid to the Bani Bu Ali through misdirected economy, but Mr. Wingate' :i: * restored them. 34. In 1923 the Amirs sent a petition to Government claiming that the port of Sur belonged to them and that the Sultan had nothing to do with the said port; that the Sultan did not supply them with arms and ammunition according to agreement, and asking that they might enter into direct relations with the Government of India. Government replied that they were unable to intervene on their behalf. This claim to independence on the part of the Amirs of Jaalan appears to be based on the compact entered into by the Wahabi Sheikh on his invasion •of Oman, when certain Sheikhs were constituted Ameers or territorial lords in their own right without any dependence on Muscat (Bombay Government Records, XXIV, p. 43). 35. In 1924 Mahomed bin Naser informed Major Hinde'^' that he was authorised by the Muscat Government to settle all disputes in Sur and had succeeded in doing so with the exception of Khamis bin Mubarak of the Arama section. From the records of the Council of Ministers it appears that Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Sultan in March 1924 offering to neffect a settlement between the Jenebeh sections. The Sultan replied, permitting him to interfere during the Salifah period, but after this period he was not to interfere in anything. 36. Major Hinde then enquired how it was that the Sheikh did not permit the new customs house to be built at Sur. Mahomed bin Naser became •evasive and said nothing had ever been settled about it, finally denying ithat he had ever agreed to its being built and stating that he never would # Then Political Agent, Muscat.agree. He went on to say that the right of His Highness to collect customs at Sur and Aiqa had never been recognised by his forbears, himself or his tribe, 37. In 1925 Colonel Prideanx (then Political Resident in the Gulf&gt; remarked that the Amirs were not very loyal to the Sultan and that if they had done their duty and given the Wali of Sur all the support he was entitled to there would have been no question of paying a ransom for the release of a Hindu who was kidnapped by a Bedouin. 38. In December 1925, in protesting against having to obtain a 'No* Objection' certificate from the Political Agent before being allowed to import arms and ammunition from Bombay, Mahomed bin ^N&lt;isei wrote^ to the Government of India : 'I submit that this request of the Political Department of Bombay is not fair to me as a ruler of an independent State, and it would be highly detrimental to my dignity to ask for consent or certificate from the Political Agent, Muscat. I hold the Political Agent in high regard, but I think you will appreciate that 1 prefer to preserve the dignity of my State not to do an act detrimental to its independent possession.' 39. Mahomed bin Naser has as his lieutenants (1) Abdnlla bin Saleh, a Habshi, who was his agent in Bombay, speaks English and is reputed to have drafted Mahomed bin Naser's letter to the Government of India. He is stated to be very unreliable; (2) Mahomed bin Said, a Syrian whom he engaged about December 1927 to teach his children. Reputed to know a little English and to be much travelled. III.—Historical Summary of the Jenebeh. 40. Little is traceable concerning the early history of this tribe.. According to Colonel Miles, they are a branch of the Bani Jabir and, therefore, Wilad Dhnbyan of Kahtanate origin, but now classed as Ghafjri. They are considered the least religious tribe in Oman, and in this connection it would be interesting to trace whether there is any connection between them and Abu Said al Hassan, el Janaby, the Karmaty, who abolished prayer and fasting and the pilgrimage and attacked the Hajj and invaded Oman about the year A.D. 900.' ::: * 41. A violent grudge of old standing between the Jenebeh and the Harth (the tribe of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh—the strong man of the Imam's Government), culminating in an affray near Khaburah in which the Jenebeh were the victors, is mentioned as taking place in the early part of the reign of Saiyid Said (1807-56), whilst they were assisting the latter in his opera tions against the Wahabis. Later they appear to have assisted the Wahabis in conjunction with Mahomed bin Nasir al Jabir against Saiyid Said. Later still they appear once more to have assisted Saiyid Said against the Wahabis. 42. In 1865 the Jenebeh of Sur, discontented with the Sultan's rule, sought Wahabi assistance from Baraimi ; and the Wahabi agent, nothing loth, sent a contingent, who plundered Suq Sur, assisted by the Jenebeh and Bani Bu Ali. Nearly all the damage inflicted fell on Hindu traders and shopkeepers ; the extent of their losses w^as estimated at $27,700 and one of their number was killed and anotlier wounded. Before being allowed to leave for Muscat, they were stripped of almost all their clothing.f 43. Colonel Pelly considered that a prompt and severe example should be made of the Jenebeh, who were implicated with the Wahabis in the plunder and murder of our subjects at Sur. There were other reasons too which called for the punishment of this tribe. They had long been notorious among our naval officers as the most cruel and unscrupulous slavers and pirates. They were among the Arab slave dealers who had conspired in 1861 to assassinate the British Agent at Zanzibar for his anti-slavery proceedings. It was also believed that they were concerned in the murder of three seamen of H.M.S. Wasp, who had disappeared from * They were in league with the Bani Jabir for many years, following their fortunes; vis-a -vis the Wahabis. t For fuller details vide 'Muscat and its Relations with the Wahabi Power,'.ith ,h. oi r*Af bU'vir to r. trsr t owing to a conspiracy to dethrone him.

In the month of June 1875 a godown belonging to the principal Indian tiadei of Sur, a Bania named Jethnand Motamull, was broken into during his absence on business at Muscat by a party Jenebeh who, v£ of'Sut «1 ^ W T?' 1811 -I 11 char S e a , nd carl ' ied off plunder to the value of about $1,600. ihe spoil was openly sold in the town and the robbeis made no attempt at concealment of themselves, but no steps were taken bythe Sheikhs of the tribe- to cause restitution, and it does not even appear that they offered to remonstrate with or suppress their tribesmen tinp r UO M a i 1 0r 0t 4 f' autl!ont y ou behalf of the Sultan at Sur at the time, who _ could have taken action in the matter. The Bania therefore reported the matter to Colonel Miles and the case was referred to His- Highness, who promised redress. -icicucu to ms- Sliet^T^T th '®' 1LM S - happened to arrive at Sur, and the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh apprehensive that her arrival was connected with the outrage committed by their tribesmen, and fearing the results, seized the offender, and would have doubtless caused restitution, but H.M.S man, which only dropped anchor for a few hours incidentally in passing having m the meantime weighed anchor, the Sheikhs perceived how matter stood and released their tribesmen without further question. 47. During His Highness Saiyid Turki's absence in Gwadur the case was presented to Saiyid Abdul Aziz, but without beneficial resull About time the Sheikhs of the tribe went to the Bania and offered an arrangement promising to make good the loss in eight months This arrangement they afterwards repudiated. Saiyid Turki was reminded of the matter after h's return, but he was not able to put sufficient pressure for thpir ?

Colonel W. F. Prideaux, the Political Ke^nt,iJ^sngj ?? 8te d that in addition to the original amount a fine of ^&gt;2 000 should be levied on the Jenebeh, partly as compensation for the delav and partly as a penalty for the offence committed against a British subject. 3393 B10 . 49. At first, however, the the Sultan's request, daiimng that the lepressio th in return folr punishnaeut of criminals was the duty ot t e u Su'virl Turki the the responsibility which it has incurred m guaranteeing to Saiyid jkthc ^OMemed! without being made on the British Government for .armed intervention. nn r rhp Sultan's efforts to comply with this attitude of Government were the Sultan's demands. ■ 51 When the Political Agent arrived at Sur on the 24th July he wrote to the Jenebeh enclosing His Highness s order and warned them that if thev failed to comply within 24 hours, measures of a coercive natme would follow. The Jenebeh had no recognised head at the time, the • I ahpiVh lieino' a bov as vet without authority, but several of the leading men came on board in reply to the letter 4hey expressed t eir readiness to comply with His Highness s order, but explained that the absence of a recognised authority amongst them rendered it necess^ for each member of the tribe to pay his share at once, as, were some to PW ^ behalf of the rest, their chance of reimbursement would he small. On this around and on the ground that several of their principal men were inlan fighting against the Bani Bu Hassan,_they asked for an extension ol time .and were allowed until sunset on the w5th. 5' Bv noon of the 25th, Jethanand's claim amounting to $1,600 had heen satisfied partlv by a money payment and partly by a hnggalow (or native dhow) of which he had received possession. At sunset the Governor of Sur and Jothanaud came on board. The former dehvered to ^ e ^ lt h al d A gg .$2,000 and the latter stated that his claim against the Jenebeh had Deen f '^Government expressed satisfaction with the results obtained and directed that the fine of $2,000 should be paid to Saiyid Turki, alter deducting the ■expenses incurred in the measures which had been taken. 53 In 1885 Saiyids Faisal and Fahd went to Sur to endeavour to obtain' payment of certain customs duty from the Jenebeh, but were .unsuccessful. 54. In 1898 Suleiman bin Suweylim ,who was the Sultan's Wall of Bhofar Sur, and Sohar, went to Sur, where the inhabitants were being encouraged bv French agency to make light of the Saltan's authority. He summoned the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh and informed them that in Jure he would not respect Khafir and would seize the persons and property of those who belonged to tribes whom he considered unfriendly, even it in the^house of the ' Khafir' himself. (When a party or caravan wish to pass througn the country of another tribe, they take with them as escort a man belonging to the tribe through whose country they wish to r ^ e ,, par f ° •caravan is then safe from attack, and this is known as the Khalir system. It is respected to such an extent that members of a tribe travelling under this protection through the country of a tribe with which they even have a blood feud, are safe.) 55. This aroused the greatest indignation amongst the Jenebeh. Suleiman then proceeded to Muscat, leaving his son, a lad of 12 or 13 years, m charge of the place. Later he wrote to his son at Sur, ordering him to build a ion at a spot which would at once command both the water supply of the town and the caravan route to the interior. Such a fort would have ep abi ® the Sultan to overcome the Jenebeh and ensure a large increase in tne revenue derived from the customs at Sur. About this time Suleiman s sou threatened to shoot a gardener, and actually did shoot a bullock and cu11 down a date tree belonging to the gardener, because the latter refused to supply him with some green grass, which he was keeping for his own camels. 36. The four sections of the Jenebeh then combined and wrote letters to the Sultan .asking him to stop the building of the fort and remove Sukmau s son from bur. The Sultan did not reply to these letters. Five ot the ftheikhs then came to Muscat and placed their complaints before the Sultan, but His Highness turned a deaf ear and they went away disappointed. 57. At length, after representations from several quarters, His Highness, sent his writer Hamad to Sur to listen to the complaints of the Jenebeh and stop the building ot the fort. No attention was paid by Suleiman's son to this order, and on Hamad s return His Highness did not even take the trouble to Jiear his report. 58. Sheikh Abdulla bin Salim of the Bani Bu Ali now intervened and induced the Sultan to stop the building of the fort, but the Jenebeh insisted on the recab of Suleiman's son and said they were quite prepared to nglit rather than submit to Suleiman's rule. r 59. The Jenebeh then cut off the supplies of the garrison. The Sultan- at once wrote to the Jenebeh warning them that their attitude, if persisted in, would only result m speedy and condign punishment. The Sultan's messenger was informed by the Sheikhs that unless he left Sur before- nightfall, his bJood would be on his own head. 00. It was difficult to understand why the Sultan persisted in tryincr to force Suleiman bin Suweylim's unpopular and high handed rule on 'the Jenebeh against their will. He had neither money nor troops with which to^ coerce the tribe. Any man he could raise would come out not for the purpose of fighting, but merely to live at His Highness's expense ; whilst the Jenebeh, though not a martial tribe, were well armed and had sutiicient money to induce other tribes to join them. 61- ^ t0n „ ard ,V the , ^ ° f .September, a force consisting of 600 Jenebeh, ^00 Bam Bu All and loO Bam Rasib beleaguered the fort occu pied by the Sultan's representative. The rebels opened fire at long range and the garrison replied. This lasted for three hours without resulting in anv loss^ for either side, when it suddenly seemed to strike one of the Sheikhs that some members of his tribe were in the fort. The Sheikh thereupon advanced up to the walls under a flag of truce and called upon the garrison to surrender. A parley then ensued and an agreement was arrived at, the rebels guaranteeing that the Wall's son and the beleaguered garrison would be escorted in safety to the coast and placed on board a vessel bound for Muscat. The fort was accordingly evacuated and the party despatched to Muscat. 62. Before returning to their homes the rebels destroyed the new and half built fort referred to above. The Sheikhs wrote to the Sultan offerino- to hand over the fort to anyone deputed by him except Suleiman bin Suweylim or his son, and the Sultan despatched afresh garrison under Hamad bin Saif. The Sultan wrote a conciliatory letter to the Sheikhs, informing them that he pardoned them for their late act of rebellion, but the Sheikhs, not convinced of his bond fides, refused to allow Hamad to take over the fort'and he returned to Muscat. 63. At the end of the year the Jenebeh were persuaded to accept a new Wall, and Sheikh Muhammad bin Hamad (the present Wali of Matrah and President of the Council) and a fresh garrison of 60 men took possession of the fort. The fort was found to have been entirely dismantled ; all the woodwork had been removed and nothing left but the bare, walls. 64. During this period the authority of the Sultan was being further undermined as a result of French intrigue. A plan of the harbour at Sur, published by the French Government in 1901, showed that their attention had been directed to that place at some earlier date, and in 1893 M. Chapui a somewhat disreputable French subject, arrived at Sur in a steamer flying the French flag and tried to obtain a site for a coal shed there. ;The scheme for advancing French interests by a wide distribution of the Trench flag was boldly pursued. In November 1891 it was stated^that as many as 50 Sur boats flying the French flag were bound for Bushire and iThad put in to Lingah. (This question is further dealt with in the review Oi the slave trade.) By 1900 the people of Sur, especially those of the Jenebeh tribe, had almost ceased, under French encouragement, to regard the Sultan as their master. . . 65. In 1900 Hilal biu Amr arrived at Sur from East Africa, joined hands with M. Ottavi, and began to inveigh against the Sultan and the British - and the spirit of the Jenebeh was such that, when summoned by the Sultan to meet him at Muscat, they refused to go and insolently su£»ested that he should deal with them instead through the French Vice-Consul. It was this state of affairs which obliged baiyid haisahm June 1900 to make a visit to Sur, the first since h 1S ^ccessionm 1S8«- ^ reception was more favourable than he had expected, for all e W er ® town immediately paid their respects to him, the Cheif Sheikh of Bu Aii came down from the interior with a thousand men to do him honour, and the Sultan was successful, before he left, n obtaining from the Irench flag holders of the port, including the Jenebeh, a formal profession -allegiance to himself and a renunciation of French protection. 06. In 1901 the Sultan sent 80 Askaris to garrison his post at Sur, and the French flag holders, few of whom had observed their promise given m the previous year, understanding the act as a threat to themselves, asked M. Ottavi whether he would protect them m case of an attack by the Sultan s troops; his reply was unfavourable, and the incident marked another stage in the decline of French influence at Sur. 67 About 1913 a blood feud started between the Arama and Makhana sections of the Jenebeh, which has continue_d ever since In 1918 His Highness the Sultan visited Sur and fined the Jenebeh Ks. 14,000 ana imprisoned 20 Sheikhs. This action kept the peace for about two years. 68 lu 1919 the Muscat customs were reorganised and the people of Sur, seeing that in future the dues would be more strictly enforced, refused to allow 0 a customs house to be built. In 1920 Captain MacCollum, the then Wazir, went to Sur in H.M.S. Britomart, and the Jenebeh agreed to accept the new arrangements. Things went smoothly for a short while and then smuggling began again and has continued ever since. The customs house was not built, difficulties being invariably placed in the way, and the \\ all became as powerless and inept as evei. 69 Spasmodic murdering went on, and in j923 the Council of Ministers sent Sheikh Rashid, Minister for Religious Affairs, to attempt to put an end to the feuds. He returned, having been openly flouted and l^ing accomplished nothing. In July Zubair, Minister of Justice, accompanied by Captain Alban, LA. (in command of the Muscat Levies) and 150 levies and three machine guns, proceeded to Sur and occupied the fort. Zubair reported that he had settled all feuds and caused blood money to be paid over immediately in his presence and recovered $6,400 customs dues from the merchants and fined the tribe $4,000. A site was selected for a custom house and the party returned to Muscat in triumph. Unfortunately there was one case in which blood money was not accepted. The Makhana agreed to pardon the murderer, an Arama. He was imprisoned in Muscat and was released m 1924 Meeting an armed slave of the murdered Sheikh on the outskirts of Sur, he'decided the man had been detailed to kill him and fired and killed the slave This started indiscriminate firing between the sections, in which one Arama boy was killed. The Fuwaris took a hand and seized a water donkey belono-ing to the Arama, and a struggle ensued, in which an Arama girl was killed? The Wali was able to use the Ramzan feast for arranging a 45 days armistice. 70. About this time (1924) Mahomed bin Kaser, Amir of the BaniBu Ah, started to take an interest in the affairs of the Jenebeh, having formed an alliance with Mansur bin Naser, Jenebeh Sheikh of Masirah, and won over the Makhana and A1 Ghialin sections in Sur—the weaker party in the feud among the Jenebeh—to acknowledge his authority./I.

In 1873 H.M.S. London was stationed at Zanzibar for To 1 dumif that period the wholesale traffic was for the time being suppressed Ijut slaves still arrived m the Persian Gulf in small lots onrl i 1 i begun to conceal their operations by use of the French flag, which secured them against search by British vessels. In the 'eiohties thprp wn Za^zSr 1106 0f the trade 0Wing t0 tlie ^thdrawal of H.M.S. London from tS.

The demand m the —r behmd Sur is not threat, for the system of irrigation in Jaalan and Sharkijah aoes not demand slave labonr. The majority of the slaves arc re-exported .n small vessels to the Batineh, where irrigation 1S mosdy from wells, and where some of them are retained. The balance is distributed from the- Batineh to the Trucial coast by land. At this time he nmnber imported here annually was estimated at 300. The Jenebeh tribe proclaimed openly that their only object in taking the French flag was to protect their slaving operations. . 79 Sur quickly attained a disreputable prominence in the trattie, and it became increasingly clear that the only way to put an end to it was to break up the Sur depot; but the chief obstacle to such a step was the Sde of France in ilgal-d to her flag. Political difficulties arose owing to the extent to which the protection of the French flag was being abused. 80 From 1892 onwards abundant evidence was forthcoming of the abuse of the French flag by importers. In 1896 several vessels carrying slaves, were captured. In May the Political Agent captured _a vessel carrying 9 8 slaves * A few days later H.M.S. Lapwing captured a vessel carrjiDg 14 slaves, whilst the Sultan's officials rescued two recently imported slaves at Bunder Gisseh. H.M.S. Sphinx captured two vessels flying the I lench flag. The one had 30 slaves on board; the other 140. A third vessel, whose French papers appeared to be in order, was allowed to proceed. Ihe vessels, though stated in the papers to belong to Madagascar and Comoro, were in reality from Sur. . 81 Owiuff to political difficulties created by these seizures, slave cruising was virtually discontinued and from this time onwards the traffic appears to have been on the increase. The Sultan was assured by the Government ot India that his subjects could not be removed from his jurisdiction, but the precariousness of his position at Sur and his fear of the French Government deterred him from taking any action. 82. In 1900 Captain P. Z. Cox, then Political Agent, Muscat, re-examined the question of the importation of slaves. He found that about 1,000 slaves had been imported that year into Sur, of which about half had been carried in vessels under the French flag. In 1901 about 1,000 slaves were again imported, whilst in 1902 the supply was stated to be abundant. In 1902,, ] ] 4 '\rabs were captured by the Portuguese in Mozambique whilst actually eno'aged in slave trading. About a third of them died in confinement, while of 'he remainder 54 were sentenced to transportation for 25 years With a few exceptions these men belonged to the Jenebeh and Bam bu Ah tribes- of Sur. The number of the captives who might have claimed i'r.encti protection was never ascertained, but it was admitted by one o t em before the Portuguese authorities that two of the vessels captured Hew tne French flag. 83. In 1905 the award of the Hague tribunal in^ regard to the rrench flag question compelled the French authorities to exercise a closer supervision over native masters entitled to use the French colours. 84. Since the settlement of the French flag question and the stoppage of the principal sources of supply at Zanzibar and on the African coast very little attention appears to have been paid to the traffic of slaves at Sur, but I am assured from seveial sources that the trade, both in slaves and m arms, is very profitable and nearly every Arab dhow arriving at Sur has a small quantity of these commodities. The slaves are being imported from Socotra,, Mokalla and Dhofar, whilst the arms come from Jeddah and the Italian ports- in the Red Sea. V. Summary of recent EYents in Sur. 85. In 1927 the Arama and Makhaua sections of the Jenebeh each built three neAv forts in their quarters .against the orders of the Wall. 86: In August 1927 Mr. Thomas, Minister of Finance, went to- Sur. He attempted to induce the Jenebeh to pay lakhs of rupees which they owe15 Khan Bahadur Nasib and Ali Musa Khan, merchants of Mnscat and to null •down the forts which they had built It airoearml wt 'th.a li opposition to this came mainly froui the Arama s'ection, andon 8ur S whereupoTt'he 1 AramVfir^on' a TT i &amp; S ?'

They attempted to send tin's letter to the Council through the Political Agent. buTTf^s hem and they weie inlormed that if they wished to communicate with the Council they should do so direct. 90. In May Abdulla bin Saleh, Secretary to Mahomed bin Naser pioceeded to Bush ire to interview the Political Resident. He asserted the Bam Bu Ah did not recognise the Sultan's authority and attempted to get a certificate of identity at the Agency. He was directed to obtain a passport from the Sultan s Government. ouiam a ®. 1 ; 1 ? 28 His H'gbness the Sultan and the Council of Ministers furnished their views on the situation at Sur. They resented the letters and actions of the Amirs of Jaalan, realised they were not strong enough to deal with the situation and asked for the assistance of the British Hjrovernment. -i^oxx 92. In August 1928 the Amirs wrote to the Political Resident claiming tba bur was a part of their territory, that the Sultan's Wali was there and customs collected with their permission, that the town and customs were tinie 1 r protection and everything would be accomplished in its proper 93. On the 21st August a party of about 15 Arabs, chiefly of the Fuwaris .ec ion of the Jenebeh, boarded a Cutch Mandvi buggalow belonging to -a British subject, Khimji Ramdaa, which had arrived from Karachi overawed the crew with rifles and daggers, and made off with 2-5 ba^s of nee and Rs. 200 worth of personal property belonging to the Nakhoda 'Most ■of the culprits are known. The Council of Ministers arrested one of tnem m JM-nscat and are attempting to obtain the surrender of the others irom the Fuwaris Sheikhs. , 94. On the night of the 27th August some Arabs climbed over a broken wall and got into the fort where the Wali lives. They stabbed his two best16 horses. The Wall's Askaris are believed to have had a hand m it it* conjunction with the Bani Bn Ali. They have been replaced by others trom Muscat. The Wall's telephone line from his residence to the customs is also being cut constantly. 94 a About this time a party of the Meshaikh tribe (a small tribe of Bedouins and robbers, originally allied to the Bern I'm Hassan, but now stated to be under the protection cf the Bani Bu Ah) stationed themselves on the road outside Muqrimatain and looted all people coming into bur lor some days. They killed a number of donkeys. 95. On the 18th September a shop belonging to a British subject— Motimnl Siikkumnl—was broken into at noon by two men, an Arab and a slave, whilst the owner was upstairs. The robbers ran away on seeing the owner coming down, taking with them $138 in cash and ornaments worth $95 ; w r hilst running away ihey dropped $45 worth of ornaments, which were recovered. 06 Mahomed bin Naser of the Bani Bu Ali removed the flagstaff from his house at Aiqa and erected a new flagstaff-on ground level. On the 21st September Abdulla bin Saleh, mentioned above, hoisted ibn bauds flas on the newly erected flagstaff. A^ salute of three guns was lired when the flag was hoisted and one gun when it was lowered in the, evemng. This appears to be a parallel to the action of feaiyid Fad hi bin Ala w-i Moplah at Dhofar in 1875, when the latter styled himself as Governor of Dhofar under the Ottoman Porte (see Lorimer, Vol. I, p. oJl). 97. On the 21st September a caravan from Budiyah (Imam's territory), which had brought dry dates for Khimjji Ramdas and obtained advances for a further supply, was returning to Budiyah laden with rice. It was seized by a party of Fuwaris under one Said bin Abdulla, who was the leader oi the party who looted Khimji Ramdas's boat on the 21st August Naser bm Ah Khimji Ramdas's landlord, succeeded in intercepting them before they had reached Jebel El Eed and recovered the caravan without loss. Said went to the Wali and threatened him that if the Council did^ not release the man whom they had arrested at Muscat in connection with the looting of the buggalow, he would commit further mischief. 98. On the 26th September Mahomed bin Naser wrote to the Wali of Sur not to allow caravans to come to Sur from Budiyah with dales. The Wali refused to comply. He also wrote to the Political Agent stating that his truce with the Hijriyin had been broken and asking him to warn British subjects not to deal with the Hijriyin of Budiyah. He was asked not to interfere with the legitimate trades of British subjects. It would seem from the above that the gang of Fuwaris were acting m conjunctioa with Mahbmed bin Naser in stopping the Budiyah caravan. 99. It is believed that this action of the Amir is in order to induce caravans to proceed'to his new customs at Aiqa instead of Muqrimatain. He has also attempted to induce British merchants to transfer themselves to Aiqa, offering to charge 2J per cent, instead of 5 per cent, as charged by the Muscat authorities. 100. There has been trouble also with regard to a Chinaman who went to Sur via Aden and Muscat. He bought a large quantity of fish and fins and refused to pay the export duty on the grounds that he had already paid it to the Amirs. On the 16th September Abdulla bin Saleh wrote to the customs Mudir, stating that the Chinaman was under the protection of the Amirs, that his goods should be shipped to any place he desires, and that the Government had no right to recover any duty in any places under the rule of the Amirs. 101. On the 30th September the Director of Customs at Muscat received information from Sur that the Amirs had ordered their man in charge of customs at Aiqa to count the sailing vessels entering Jerama and Sur creeks as they intended to charge anchorage fee. They intended also to register boats at Aiqa in the name of the Amirs. The levy of such dues at Khor Jerama would appear to be a revival oi the dispute in 1877-80, when the people of Ras el Hadd attempted to levy-17 such dues and the Bnt.sli authorities were obliged to take cognisance of the matter. British war vessels visited the spot in 1877, 1879 and 1880? All tolls on trading vessels entering the Khor were then finally abolished (Lonmer, A ol. I, p. olo ; also Narrative of Muscat Affairs.) •A &lt;5 latest nows from Sur is that the caravan mentioned above left Sm for Budiyah on the 29th September accompanied as far as Qalab Haveh by an escort of Fuwans and Wali's askaris. Beyond Qalab Rayeh it was seized by a party of Bam Bu All. assisted by Ghialin and Makhana and taken to Aiqa. 1 be Wal. sent a letter to the Amirs protesting but they have refused to restorei the caravan, * YL—Review of the Situation at Sur. . ^ 03 - Hitherto the policy pursued with regard to the slave trade, arms, traffic and ill-treatment ol liritiah subjects at Sur may be summarised in the 7909 •— n0W ' X m lllS Re P orf ' No - dated 29th August 'It must be conceded that the present Sultan has been in a great measure powerless to do much to stop the ingress of newly captured negroes and at any rate during the time that the question of the French fla^ has been in process of negotiation between His Highness and the French Government it wodd have been ill-advised on our part to put upon him any special pressure m this connection; but 1 venture to submit that the recent purchase of a steamer for him and the fact that the question of the French flag seems to be shaping to a settlement, affords a convenient and fitting opportunity for the address to His Highness of a strong exhortation on the subject of Stir and its connection with the trade in arms and slaves and as to his own position in regard thereto.' _ 104. The purchase of a small patrol steamer in 1926 has proved no more fi m ve a ! 1 ' e ^ ards &amp;ul ! 11 dlcl m 1902, whilst the total armed force of the Muscat Infantry which could be made available for despatch to Sur is about «0 men. buch a force would be inadequate to meet a determined attack on the part of the tribesmen and could not look for reinforcement from Muscat. 105. Both the Sultan and the Council of Ministers realise that they are- not^ strong enough to deal with the situation without the support and assistance of the British Government, and that unless they obtain such assistance the little control which the Muscat authorities exercise over Sur will cease. They have definitely asked for such assistance. The prestige of the Muscat Government rests at present on the support which they are able to obtain from the British Government. Without such support the btate is impotent. If assistance were withheld the result would be far- reaching, as every part of the country would be affected. 100. A number of Arabs in Oman are of opinion that the British (.xovernment are not anxious to see a strong rule established at Muscat and that they would countenance the formation of another independent authority m Jaalan. This, I have heard, is the opinion of the Amirs of Jaalan. Considered politically and in its bearings on the welfare of the Muscat btate and the general peace of Oman, it seems most undesirable that any such claim should be countenanced. The Amirs could not maintain their independence, and the almost inevitable result of such a claim beino- allowed would tend to foster the intrigues for extraneous support which t?ie Amirs are now active in fomenting. 107. Whether Mahomed bin Naser has the approval of Ibn Sand for hoisting his flag at Aiqa seems doubtful, but the extension of Ibii Saud's influence to this part of the coast would seem to be undesirable.'*' * A 8 .? 5 . ^ is Ex,;ellen ^J the Governor of Bombay pointed out the evil effect of iho Wahab i power on the Indian Ocean with regard to piracy and slave trading and that these aggressions threatened seriously to injure Muscat, a power which for spvp ^ I generations past has been the only representative of civilisation and order in Eastern Arnl^ He proposed that aid be afforded to the Sultan to re-establish his authority in .Sur or other place on the seaboard of which his rebellious subjects or the Wahabis mar have denrivS him. (Minute dated 9th October 1865.) p ea 3393 nIS 108. The value of Sur from the point of view of prestige appears to have been realised by Colonel Pelly, who wrote in 1869 that if baiyid Azzan bin Khais were successful in his expedition in Jaalan, he would be likely to strengthen his authority so considerably as to be able to ^® e P a fi rmei giasp •on Muscat territory than any other aspirant to power could. 109. It was also realised by the French, who confined all their efforts to undermine the Sultan's authority to that place. 110.. The extension of the influence of the Amirs of Jaalan has also caused some uneasiness to Sheikh Isa bin Saleh arid the Imam s Government. The Council fear that the Imam's Government may interfere and obtain mastery over Sur, in which case most of the trade from the interior would foe deviated to Sur, and the revenues and trade of Muscat would become negligible.'^' 111. In 1895 the British Government extended to Saiyid Faisal the guarantee given to his father that they would not allow attacks to be made upon Muscat and Matrah, whatever differences the Sultan might have with his tribes. In actual practice this guarantee was extended to all the ports ot the Batineh coast, and to Kuryat, at which British subjects weie lesiding, and in 1896 an offer was made by the British Government and finally accepted by the Sultan, of naval assistance for the recovery ot' Dhofar. 112. If assistance is now to be afforded, the question arises as to what form such assistance shall take, and I venture to put forward the following remarks on the question. 113. It seems hardly likely that at the stage which has now been ■reached, Mahomed bin Naser would be deviated from his purpose by moral pressure alone. His attitude will probably be that of the Jenebeh in 1865 . ' We have been threatened before. Nothing has happened. We are quite sure nothing will happen now.' 114. It was suggested last year that economic pressure could be brought on the inhabitants of Sur by preventing their dhows from trading in British ports. This was the policy attempted by Napoleon against^ England. It failed then. I doubt whether it would succeed in the present instance. 115. Naval action has been taken at Sur before, as has been noted in the Historical Summary of the Jenebeh. The presence of a^ man-of-war would appear to have a good moral effect at the time, but its influence seems to depart as soon as it has steamed out of sight and the incident forgotten as rapidly as the promises made to former Sultans on their visits there. Beyond levying a few fines and possibly destroying a certain amount of property, the result obtained is meagre, it tends to make British merchants at Sur more unpopular than ever with their customers and forces them eventually to seek their means of livelihood elsewhere.! 116. If the administration of Sur is to be brought to that state of -efficiency which its importance as a trade emporium demands, if the slave trade and arms traffic are to be stopped, and if effective protection is to be afforded to British subjects trading in Sur instead of allowing them to be * In 1891-2 caravan roads from Sharkiyalt to Muscat were closed by Ghafiri tribes, and trade was deviated from that part of the province to Sur, thereby causing a gloomy prospect for Muscafc trade. (Administration Report, 1891-2.) t In liis letter No. 976 S., dated 28th December 1922, to the address of the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, commenting on the effect of shell fire on Oman tribes, Colonel Trevor writes :— ' It will be seen that the operations dragged on from the 18th October until the 2nd November. This was most unexpected as the Muscat Government confidently hoped that the Yal Saad would submit as soon as one of H.M. Ships appeared upon the scene. The Political Agent and I both consider there were good grounds for such a hope, as the last time when the Yal Saad were rebellious the mere threat of bombardment by the then Wazir made them submit and pay their fine at once. I have noticed, however, recently on the Trucial •Coast that bombardments are not regarded with so much dread as formerly, and that whereas formerly the threat of a bombardment, or at most the firing of one or two rounds, was sufficient to make a Sheikh submit, nowadays it has become necessary to carry out a fairly heavy bombardment to achieve the same result. I can only regard this as one of the unexpected results of the war.' ,19 Ai 1 i M 0 ! k See ^i ueeessai 7 t0 foll ow the same course as in the case ■of Muscat and Matrah. The towns have been transformed from armed camps living constantly under the threat of raids, into peaceful and law abiding places as quiet and sate as any town m India. The result has been reached ■by gradual development of circumstances. Indian troops were landed in Wlo, during the rebellion ot Sheikh Jsa bin Saleh and the Imam of Tanuf, for the protection of Muscat and Matrah in accordance with our undertaking to defend these towns. After one attack in 1915. when he sustained a severe defeat, Sheikh Isa bin Saleh left these places severely alone After the bultanhad coweto terms with the Imam, a small levy corps under a British officer was lormed and paid for by the Muscat Government, and the Induin troops were able to depart. + J l^S Gm-p 8 , though very weak numerical^, is a constant reminder to the tribes that they cannot raid the place with impunity and their presence as suhicient to restrain any lawless elements there may be in the population. lis. By stationing a battalion of Indian infantry at Sur for a year or two, the same result could presumably be achieved. The State could undertake to build a proper customs house and establish 311 .elective administration there. Increased customs revenues could be utilised lor the increase of the strength of the Muscat infantry by 100 men eventually to take the place of the Indian troops as soon as the situation becomes sumcientty stabilised. ,, T^e cost of such a force has been worked out for me in detail by 'Oaptam Walker, Commandant, Muscat Infantry, but I have not thought it necessary to include such details in this report. He estimates initial •expenditure, exclusive of quarters, at Rs. 21,170 ; annual expenditure for the first two years, Us. GO,000 per annum ; annual expenditure subsequently, its. ol,400 per annum. J 120. The customs receipts of Sur amounted to— lis. Rs. 1921 - 45,531 1925 - 42,751 1922 - 36,376 1926 - 37,813 1923 - 50,728 1927 - 38,802 1924 - 37,457 The above amounts were collected under the conditions described above. If the town were properly under control the customs receipts should •exceed one lakh. i t, 21 ' ■ Wit 11 ^e Presence of such troops, it might also be possible to induce the British India Company to send their slow mail steamers to call at Sur Although the volume of trade would justify this, the opposition of dhow owners and the general insecurity of the place prevents their doing so at present. Such visits would be a great civilising influence to the place in addition to furnishing an easy means of access and also furthering British trade. G. P. MURPHY, Major, Political Agent and H.B.M. Consul, Muscat , Muscat. 9th October 1928.APPENDIX I. Early History of Sur. The name Sur is stated by Colonel Miles to be identical with that^of Tyre or Sur in the Mediterranean and to have been its prototype. He therefore ascribes a Phoenician origin to the place. ■ _ The Mart of Maceta (mentioned by Arnan in his account ot the voyage of Nearchus), Hereen says, was probably Sur, and he adds that an emporium like this, at the entrance of the Gulf, strengthens our idea oi an ancient Indian trade with the Oman coast. At the time of Albuquerque, Sur is described as a small fishing village he passed whilst approaching Muscat. The Portuguese appear to have occupied the place twice, the first period prior to 1633, when they were driven out by Naser bin Murshid al Yarraby, again prior to 164b, when one of the conditions imposed by the Arabs on the Portug v uese was that the fort of Sur should be surrendered and razed. APPENDIX 2. Wrecks and Piracy. In 1829 the Bani Bu Ali looted a British ship Oscar, which ran ashore on the coast of Jaalan, and plundered cargo to the value of eight lakhs of rupees. The Resident went to Sur, accompanied by 11.H. the Sultan, two- frigates and a squadron, to recover the property, but succeeded in recovering 112,000 and some shawls only. &gt; . It was remarked at the time : ' Finding that this Chief and tribe, in consequence of their residing in the interior, were wholly untangible by naval means alone, the British authority conceived it useless to attempt force and therefore endeavoured to create such an impression on the minds of the inhabitants of this dangerous coast as would be likely to prove highly beneficial to any British ship that might have the misfortune to suffer a similar accident.' (Vide Bombay Government Selections, XXIV, page 199.) In 1833 a piracy attended with cruel and aggravated circumstances, committed on a Cutch No wry off the coast of Zanzibar, was traced by the Imam to some of the tribes of Sur. He seized the principal offenders and placed them at the disposal of the Resident to be dealt with as lie might direct. . In 1852 the S.S. Centaur ran ashore near Ras el Hadd. The Bam Bu Ali plundered the whole of her cargo, valued at 10 or 11 lakhs, and destroyed the vessel. In 1904 Jenebeh, of Masirah Island, were responsible for the murder of 17 of the crew of the Baron Inverclyde, which struck a rock near the Kuria Muria Islands. Eight Greeks remained on the ship and were rescued by the S.S. Prome. One ship's boat was never heard of again. The other boat contained the 17 men mentioned above, who were massacred on attempting to land at Masirah. The ringleaders were shot after trial by the Sultan's Askaris, in the- presence of Major Grey, Saiyid Taimur and a party from H.M.S. Merlin.&amp; SECRET- INDIA OFFICE. B. 419. p^'0790/29^ Future Policy on the Trucial Coast. Correspondence between the Secretary of State for India, the Government of India, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (1929). I ntroductory N ote. 1. The developments affecting the position of His Majesty's Government on the- Trucial Coast in the period 1908-28 and the question of the general policy of His Majesty's Government in that area are dealt with in the India Office Memorandum on the Trucial Chiefs, reprinted on pages 87-94 of P.G. 13. The position of the Sheikhdom of El Qatr is dealt with in the Memorandum on pages 95 and 96 of that paper. 2. Subsequent to the publication of P.G. 13, the question of the future relations of His Majesty's Government with the Trucial Chiefs and Qatr came under the consideration of the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. The Sub-Committee, after considering memoranda on the subject by the Colonial Office and the India Office (papers Nos. P.G. 22 and P.G. 26j, decided, at their meeting on the 19th November 1928, ' to adopt the conclusions set forth in paper No. P.G. 22, para. 6, namely, that 4 our present position on the Trucial Coast is sufficient to protect essential British interests; that we should endeavour to maintain the independence of the Trucial Chiefs, and should not allow our present position in regard to them to be weakened in any way ; that we should rely upon our existing treaty rights to secure this end, and that it is not desirable at present to incur the further commitments that would be involved in the conclusion of regular protectorate treaties.' ' 3. Since the date of this conclusion, the general question of policy has, however, again been raised in the correspondence reprinted below. Sir Frederick Johnston, on assuming the charge of the Persian Gulf Residency at the end of 1928, remarked in the despatch printed as No. I below, that it was for consideration whether a review of the Trucial Coast policy of His Majesty's Government with regard to actual conditions and needs was not called for. He suggested that certain tentative proposals made by him to this end might be considered, together with the position as a whole, by his successor, Colonel Barrett, ' who has a unique experience of the Arab littoral.' Colonel Barrett's report is printed as No. 111. The views on it of the Government of India will be found in the Viceroy's telegram of 22nd October 1929, reprinted as No. 1V. India Office, J. G.

Johnston, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. British Residency and Consulate-General, Sir, Bushire, 23rd April 1929. I have the honour to refer to your letter No. 58 N. ; dated 13th June 1928, i:: - to which you have just called attention in your letter No. F. 58 N./28, V ' J of the 9th April 1929. 2. The suggestions for checking the series of murders in the Shaikh family of Abu Dhabi emanated from my predecessor, who apparently found the practical imposition of any remedy to be impossible without the assumption of a very much greater amount of internal control than is consistent with His Majesty's Government's policy on the Trucial Coast, and, I am informed, delayed his reply in the hope that the deliberations of the Persian Gulf Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence would result in the policy of a greater degree of interference in the Trucial Coast internal affairs. * Not printed. 4006 50 10.29 A./ 2 3. History will, I think, show few societies which have not passed through the stage of the assumption of power by murder. That it is inhuman everyone will admit, but there are many things going on on the Arab coast that are mucli uiore inhuman, and the murder of a Shaikh is only a symptom of a primitive state of affairs from which development must be gradual and which cannot be altered by the mere suppression of that symptom. Though there may be possibly some sympathy for the first Shaikh, it is difficult to feel any for his successors in the blood-stained line. They know exactly the contract they are taking on, Asa matter of policy the results of interference in successions are very clearly set forth in para. 3 of Despatch No. 13 of 1927, from the Government of India to the Secretary of State for India. If a policy of interference with the will of the people and of bolstering up weak Shaikhs is to be adopted, the only corollary is practical annexation. Arabia is by no means exempt from the changed conditions of thought throughout the world, and the only hope of improvement seems to lie in the development along the Arab coast of better appreciation of the sanctity of human life and the advantages of social stability. So long as these violent changes do not affect the Jives and security of Biitish subjects, I fail to see the necessity of viewing them too strictly from the point of view of an alien school of thought. 4. As regards the wider question of our general policy on the Arabian side, I feel that with the short period of my tenure here and the small opportunity I have had, owing to difficulties of transport, of studying on the spot the problems existing there, any views I express can only be of value as the result of the application of a perfectly fresh outlook on conditions entirely novel to an experience of administration under conditions in many ways similar, gained on the Indo-Afghan frontier. Such experience as I have obtained of our dealings with the Trucial Chiefs leads me to think that possibly both interference and non-interference are carried in some matters to a greater degree than is consistent with our interests, and that there is a complete absence of real political touch. The political duties on the Trucial Coast are performed by the Residency Agent, himself on Arab, and as such liable to Arab intrigues^ and partisanship. He lives at Shargah, some 8 miles from Dabai, where the mail steamer calls once a fortnight. r l elegraphic communication can only be made through Henjam by special sailing arrangements in case of great urgency. I he Resident can only pay occasional visits and can only have a very partial knowledge of what is really going on. In view of the importance of this portion of the coast, with possibilities of Wahabi aggression and the prospect of opening up an air service, it seems a matter for argument whether the time has not now come to post at Dabai a full-time Political Agent and to instal there telegraphic or wireless communication. The Shaikhs are in general well disposed, and as life is mainly maritime there is always present in the Navv an efficacious and prompt weapon to deal with any recalcitrance. . .A capable officer provided with a small but seaworthy launch in which he could visit the outlying Shaikhdoms seems to be the only means by which we can maintain real political touch^ with the Irucial Coast and efficiently arrange and maintain a satisfactory air service on the Arab littoral. Ihe case is similar as regards Qatar, and it seems to be a matter for consideration whether closer and more definite arrangements should not be made with this Shaikhdom under the political advice of the Political Agent at Bahrain. Until some change is made on the lines above lean see little prospect of any satisfactory or safe arrangement for aerial flight on the Arab littoral. Pos si!^ now that he has apparently dealt satisfactorily with his recalcitrant Najd tribes, Bin baud may be able to lake a more liberal view of flights over the Hasa coast, but m any case the distance between Kuwait arid Bahrain is not great. Further down, however, there would appear to be an ever recurring risk of trouble unless the position is made more definite and consolidated. 5. Both as legards the Irucial Coast and the larger Shaikhdoms, there would appear to be a considerable element of doubt as to how far the policy which is formally and publicly enunciated is being actually carried out and whether it is not now advisable to review that policy with regard to actual conditions and needs. * P. 4575/27, not printed; but see P.G. 13, page 89, paras. 14 and 15.o o I extract, the following from an article iii an American magazine :— ' Mascat is a British protectorate. Qatar, as well as Trncial Oman on the Persian Gulf, is a British sphere of influence. Bahrain is practically a Crown Colony, and Koweit is bound treaty to take advice and receive protection from the British Government.' There is little exaggeration here, but it differs substantially in actuality from our theoretical position. 6. I cannot but think that many of the difficulties we are now encountering on the Persian side of the Gulf would have been obviated had w T e taken earlier stock of our position and regularised and consolidated it when that position enabled us to do so,, and there seems a possibility that eventually, with the growing power of Bin Sand or some other form of Arab nationalism, the time might come when failure to consolidate and regularise our claims in a more definite and less veiled manner might leave us to be shorn of privileges which we had long enjoyed, but which we had failed to make sufficiently regular to stand before a diplomatic court. I put forward these opinions with due deference, recognising that their only value is the relative one expressed at the beginning of para. 4 above. For that reason they may possibly merit further examination by an expert, and I can think of no one better suited to do so than the officer who is to take over charge from me, Colonel Barrett, who has a unique experience of the Arab littoral. 7.

British Residency and Consnlate-General, Sir, Bushire, 5th September 1929. I have the honour to refer to your letter No. F. 58 N./28, dated 21st May 1929, 0 calling for my views on Sir Frederick Johnston's letter No. 133 S.f of the 23rd April 1929, which is itself an amplification of Sir Lionel Haworth's No. 169 S. of the 20th April 1928* * Not printed. t No. I above.2. Sir Lionel Haworth was of the opinion that the new Shaikh Shakbut would rule for a considerably shorter period than the 18 months of his predecessor. Shaikh Shakbut has, however, in spite of our nou-interyentioti, .already nominally governed Abu Dhabi for a longer period than Shaikh Saggar. 1 say u nominally govcrued,' as during my recent visit to Abu Dhabi it was obvious that the real governor is the murdering uncle, Shaikh Khalifa, who was treated with the greatest deference by all, jS r o Arab Shaikh would be classed as a first-class life by an insurance company, su it is very unsafe to prophesy ; but so far as I can judge, there is no immediate prospect of another change of rulers, provided Shaikh Shakbut does nothing contrary to the wishes of his powerful uncle or the Junta, which exists in all these principalities, I doubt whether Sir Lionel Ha worth's proposal, that a in the event of a Shaikh 's being murdered, His Majesty's Government will consult with the leading merchants and others of Abu Dhabi and then recognise a Shaikh elected by them,' is a real remedy. I am of opinion that no''removal' takes place until the successor has assured himself that the Junta will not be hostile to him. If I am right in my belief, the reference to' the leading merchants and others ' would merely be an appeal from Cfesar unto Ctesar. 3. I have discussed the subject of fratricide with those whose opinion is of value, and 1 find that so long as it is confined to a Shaikhly family, it is looked upon as an ordinary occurrence about which no sensible person will bother his head. Of course, it is forbidden in the Quran, but that is a matter between the murderer and his conscience. One night there will be shouting in the town and some shots will be fired. The citizens will close their doors and go to sleep. The next morning it will be given out that the Shaikh is dead and has been succeeded by one of his relations. It is generally a family affair pure and simple. One of the new Shaikh's personal retainers—usually a slave—may have been involved ; but in most cases the coup de grace has been administered by the new Shaikh himself, as others are diffident about committing themselves to such an extent. In the case of Shaikh Saggar the actual murderers appear to have been Manasir Bedu, acting under the orders of Shaikh Saggar's brother, Khalifa ; but otherwise it is the same story. Provided Shaikh Shakbut can keep the goodwill of his relatives by giving them sufficient maintenance allowances and preserve the support of the Junta, there is no reason why he should not continue to rule Abu Dhabi. 4. The root of most of the fratricidal trouble is that although —thanks to the pearl trade—the rulers are not paupers, they are poor, and the poverty of the State renders it almost impossible for the ruler to satisfy the demands of his numerous relations. The anxiety of Shaikh Hamad (ruler of the'rich State of Bahrain) to satisfy all his A1 Khalifa relatives—even those with whom he is not personally on good terms—is a manifestation of the Arab rulers' inherent dread of his relatives and anxiety to conciliate them. I am in absolute agreement with the views laid down by Sir Frederick Johnston in para. 3 of his letter No. 133 S. of the 23rd April 1929.* Unless and until the Government of India are prepared to interfere much more than they have done in the past, and are prepared, if necessary, to bolster up a weak Shaikh, however much we may regret it, the only course is to continue to shake hands with successful murder. These fehaikhs are not Europeans nor products of modern civilisation, and we cannot apply our standards to them. The result of the policy of bolstering up weak Shaikhs is to be seen in Bahrain and Muscat, and if Government decide to adopt it they must do so with their eyes open to the consequences. 5. It is quite vyithin the bounds of probability that the bigoted prejudice of th e Trucial Chiefs may force us to some policy of active interference in Trucial Groan, if we wish to establish our air service along this coast; but the time has not yet arrived when I can recommend forcing ourselves on the Shaikhs regardless of consequences. 6. Sir I rederick Johnston further opines that-in our dealings with these Chiefs both interference and non-interference are carried in some matters to a greater degree than is consistent with our interests. * No. I, above.5 There is much to be said for this view, but I think he was misled into exaggerating: the extent of our interference by a recommendation from the Residency Agent that a sloop should be sent to enforce a Bunniah's claim against an Arab of Dubai, which was received shortly before he wrote his letter. This recommendation did not amount to a desire to collect debts by bombardment^ but was merely an acknowledgment of that moral influence of His Majesty's Navy, which is so useful to us on the coast. It was not essential for His Majesty's sloop to visit Dubai in this particular instance, but even if she had done so her preseuce would not necessarily have been unwelcome to the Ruler, as it would show his people that His Majesty's Government were behind him in his attempt to enforce a just claim against a powerful subject. 7. One of the reasons for which we maintain an agent on the coast is the protection of the interests of our British subjects, who are mainly Sindi Bunniahs and Khojas. The presence of these British Indians gives us certain responsibilities, but it also gives us corresponding advantages, and 1 do not think it would be to our benefit that they should pack up and leave. Long experience has taught the Residency Agent that the mere threat to summon a sloop is the best method of dealing with continued recalcitrance. It is a gesture and nothing more. The fact that our Agent is himself an Arab makes him a much better judge than any European of the course of the secret intrigues that are always flowing on the coast. His nationality has also the disadvantage that our Agent cannot always keep himself free from undue interference in these intrigues. Khan Bahadur Isa Abdul Latif, O.B.E., is the third generation of his family to hold the post of Residency Agent, and the connection has continued for over 65 years, in this long period certain hereditary friendships and enmities have certainly been formed. The *' Bait Sarkali,' as the family are called, have attempted to take wives from the ruling Shaikhs, sometimes with unfortunate results ; they have built up for themselves a position of power and influence whicli arouses jealousy, but on the whole they have done excellent work for His Majesty's Government, which none other than they could have performed. I recommend that we should continue to use the great influence of the family, but should attempt to supervise their work. 8. At present the Residency Agent works directly under the Resident in Bushire, who visits the coast once or, if means of transport allow, twice a year. In addition tbe coast is visited at frequent intervals by His Majesty's ships, wdiose presence has a most beneficial and tranquillising effect on the more unruly elements on land. Tk© (Commanders of these ships are practically the supervising Political Agents of the coast, but their sphere extends from Ras al Had to Basrah and their term of service is confined to two years. In this short period it is impossible to learn the language and the customs or the local politics. The commanders must, in the nature of things,, be largely in the hands of their interpreters. Many of these men have done some excellent work, but the fact remains that the Resident's appreciation of the Residency Agent's work depends largely on the reports of Baluchi interpreters. The Residency Agent is a very astute man, and his relations with the naval interpreters are excellent. 9. The pay of our Residency Agent, who is so powerful on the coast and in many ways so valuable, is Rs. 150 per mensem. Out of this sum he and his ancestors have hitherto nominally maintained themselves, their wives and their numerous family, as well as an armed guard for their protection. They have hospitably entertained officers of His Majesty's Government, have paid for clerks, and lately have kept up a motor launch and a motor car. They have also acquired a valuable portion of the Shargah Bazaar and rich date gardens at Ras al Khaimah. Is it to be wondered at that they are the objects of insinuations for which there is no proof ? The leading Bunniahs of Dubai will tell me in confidence that all the Trucial Shaikhs subsidise our Agent and that he gets Rs. 10,000 yearly from this source; they will also tell me in confidence that our Agent takes 10 per cent, for himself in every case in which his assistance is sought; they will tell me that, acting on the advice of the Residency Agent, the Shaikh of Dubai will not permit boatmen to row them out to warships visiting the harbour ; they will tell me also that our Residency Agent engineered the trouble at Dubai in April last in order to secure his own ends, and that he secretly opposes all attempts at British penetration just as his father did in 1911; but they will not commit their complaints to writing, nor will they make them in the presence of the Residency Agent. 4006 A 2During my last visit to Dubai I asked them to propound a scheme of control for my consideration and to send it to Bushire. They promised to do so, but notlumr has materialised. 10. With regard to the question of the appointment of a British Political Agent on the Trucial Coast, the position has not materially altered since Sir Percy Cox discussed the question in his letter No. 2!84 of the 25th January 1913 :— fl ' We must expect the newly-elected Shaikh to continue like his predecessor in the hands of a camorra of his ignorant and reactionary relatives, and with the means at my disposal I see no likelihood of being able to effect any change in their attitude, as long as present conditions of British representation on the Coast are maintained, under which, though useful in other local ways the Arab Agent of the Residency wields no appreciably helpful influence where the larger questions of British interests or policy are concerned. &lt;£ Our forbearance from proceeding forcibly with the inception of our mild measures of progress has borne no fruit in the past two years ; on the contrary, the Debai community has only become the more confirmed and confident in its passive obstruction, through the Shaikh, to the least advance. In fact such movement as there has been, has been retrograde, for whereas no definite objection was ever evinced to the occasional sojourn of approved Europeans for business purposes, the Shaikh has made the Hyacinth incident a pretext for refusing admission to any European or quasi-European, even as agent for the British India Steam Navigation Company's steamers; and I am convinced that until we do put our foot down to check this factious obstruction we shall make no headway.' The statements made by Sir Percy Cox are still true. The Residency Agent is of the greatest assistance in most matters; but he is still unable to force through the larger issues of British policy. On the other hand, our experience at Bahrain, where the Government of India's attempt to pursue a cautious policy failed, and finally an ultimatum, backed by force, had to be issued, shows that even British officers find it impossible sometimes to beat down the stubborn obstinacy of Arab Chiefs and their ' camorra.' 11. I have consulted the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, who is in immediate touch with the Trucial Chiefs. In the course of his reply to ray enquiry, he wrote:— '. . . From many years of association with naval officers, both in days of smiles and crimes, the Trucial Arabs have developed a sort of friendship towards them, which they do not feel towards other Europeans ; but the Shaikh of Dubai last year would not agree to naval officers landing to look around the town^ unless accompanied by armed guards supplied by Isa or himself. The Prucial Chiefs are definitely supicious of anything which to them appears as the thin edge of the European wedge poking its nose into their territories, and any innovation will certainly be resisted, though not by any means necessarily at once or by open methods. They object to motor-cars and motor-boats, though Isa, by patient persuasion, has prevailed upon them to allow him to possess both. They object to such ideas as post offices and wireless, but when the slow mail calls at Dubai she receives letters to carry and the wireless operator receives bundles of messages to send. They frankly regard Bahrain as a typical example of the grasping hand of Britain, which, being given an inch, finally obtained possession of the whole place. Whether they are truly independent or not, they have a sturdy spirit of independence as regards determination to control their own affairs; and the first Shaikh who admits a Political Agent to be quartered upon him will be regarded as having sold his birthright. Many if not most of our steps in our progress towards developing control of the coast have been made by way of punishment (e.g. permission for Isa to fly the Jack at Shargahj and this is known to the Arabs ; in f ac ^ ^ Shaikh can at times keep his people under control by reminding them that if they do anything disliked b} 7 the Government the penalty will be some greater measure of Government control. Consequently the appointment of a Political Agent would be received as a serious punishment.' I have made this long quotation from the Senior Naval Officer's opinion foi comparison with Sir 1 ercy Cox s views of 1013 as, together, they form an admirablesumming np of the present situation. Except in the improved relations between the Xavy and the Arab Shaikhs, there has been no material alteration in the past 16 years. 44 Europeans' are still vigorously excluded from the coast The prohibition has \eiy occasionally been modified to admit of short professional visits by American missionaiy doctors, but applies even to the European pearl merchant, I. Rosenthal, whose presence, last year, as a competitor to Mohamed Ali Zainal would have been of the greatest benefit to the pearl traders of Dubai. One of the icasons for the revolution in Dubai, which was attempted by the Shaikh's family last April, was the circulation of a story that the ruling Shaikh had given permission to Mi. Straw (representative of the Standard Oil Company) to stay ashore for a night in Dubai while the mail ship was anchored off the coast. We signed the Exclusive Agreements of 1892 owing to our desire to exclude the French, and they have been useful lo us. The Shaikhs welcomed the Agreements as they accorded so well with their own inclinations; and after 1911 they have zealously enforced the policy against ourselves. It is our object now to modify this unwelcome development. Although 1 do not consider it an argument for upsetting what has been done there (see my letter to the Government of India, No. 385 S., of the 28th August 1929- :i: -), I agree with the Senior Naval Officer that the example of Bahrain is before these peoples' eyes. In the future this should be a civilising force, but at present the fear of losing their independence is a very major question and it is the greatest deterrent to permitting Europeans the slightest footing in their land. After all, are the Shaikhs wrong from their point of view? I hey are anxious to preserve their valued independence and have not yet experienced the advantages of civilisation. If they permit close contact, what will be their fate? A weak barbarian State in close ►contact with a strong civilised one must sooner or later be absorbed or become a dependency, however much the stronger may desire to avoid this course. The history of the growth of British power in India is proof of this. 12. A British Political Agent, although our treaties of 1820 gave us the right to appoint him, would have to be forced on the Shaikhs, and the Political Agent would have to be protected by an armed guard. It should be noted that our Arab Agent maintains an armed guard at his own expense. The proximity of those convenient folk—the Bedouins—would always, in the Shaikh's mind, be a ready excuse for any ' unfortunate incident' that happened to the first Political Agent. Owing to the maritime life of the coast towns, the Navy can deal with recalcitrance, and their action, possibly with the assistance of the Royal Air Force, would so greatly exceed the hitherto mild discipline which they have occasionally administered that there would be no repetition of any unfortunate accident ' due to Bedouins, whom voir know we cannot control ' ; but this would be poor consolation for the first Political Agent. I do not say that the first Political Agent would necessarily be murdered either at once or in the long run, but it is a possibility whichmust be considered. I am sure that a British Political Agent would increase British influence on this coast, and smooth all difficulties in the way of the air service. These difficulties, owing to the settled Arab policy of exclusion, are considerable. If the Arabs continue their obstruction—and the air route is of vital importance and must be established quickly—I recommend that we force them to grant the necessary facilities, and at the same time force them tu accept a British Political Agent to ensure that there will be no backsliding. The amount of pressure required should not be excessive. Owing to the maritime position of the town, the Navy could soon force any policydesired. The Arabs might threaten to emigrate as they did after the Hj/acinth incident; but if a trading centre such as Dubai were selected as the site for the new agency, the Arab move should not be more than a trifling annoyance. Delmuk and his followers would go, but the Indian, Persian, and Baluch trading community, after a protest that they had been ruined, would remain and prosper. If time presses a policy of pressure must be adopted ; but I prefer that a slower and more gradual method should be tried. 13. The coast and its Shaikhs are apparently content to live in the seventh century ; but owing to the example of Bahrain there are faint signs of a stirring in the dry * P 6258/29 : European eloraent in internal administration of Balirain. . mbones. Two years ago the entry of modern invention was prohibited, but now the Shaikh of Has al Khaimali is inquiring about a Ford car, and has been for a fhV]^ i n a flying boat; the Shaikh of Dubai has purchased a motor launch for himself; the richest and most influential merchant of Abu Dhabi has also purchased a launch and inquiries are being made whether Khalil Kanoo, of Bahrain, can hrino- hi«_ water-boring apparatus to the coast. These are small matters, but the progress ivP Bahrain is having some effect on this benighted coast. 1 think it should he 'possible tp take advantage of any advance that may be made, but the first desideratum is to restore that personal touch which vanished after 1910. 14. Before the unfortunate Hyacinth incident of 1910 the personal influence of Sir Percy Cox had gone far to break down the barriers of reserve and suspicion; but the whole position gained was lost by that unfortunate episode, and it has never been recovered. Ko successor has occupied the posit ion of Sir Percy Cox, and during a recent flying boat visit to Abu Dhabi, Captain Prior was surprised to find that not 'even the name of a single successor of ' Kokus ' is known in that town. This is due to lack of touch and this lack of touch was due first to the preoccupation of the war and subsequently to the withdrawal of the Kesideut's despatch vessel. To maintain touch with his large maritime command the Resident must have , a despatch vessel, at the disposal solely of himself and his Political Agents, It is impossible for him to share this vessel with any other department, as was shown when an attempt was made to make the same ship serve the double purpose of despatch vessel and tender to the lighthouses. Having* obtained the despatch vessel, supervision over the work of the Residency Agent on the Trucial Coast should be entrusted to the Political Agent at Bahrain, who should be relieved of routine work by his Indian Assistant The Political Agents work may be supplemented, if necessary, by the Secretary to the Resident. The Political Agent must visit each Trucial Shaikh at least every quarter and be prepared, if necessary, to make a long halt off each town. At present the Resident pays one, or at most two, visits of one day's duration each year. This is insufficient to inquire thoroughly into all problems, and the Residency Agent's recommendations are perlorce accepted. Inquiries regarding the various monetary claims of British subjects and into the diving debts of so-called debtors, who are usually slaves who have absconded to Bahrain, will give the Political Agent plenty of excuse for his presence. In addition, I am hearing most disquieting reports about the prevalence of the slave trade on this coast, and I anticipate that searching inquiries may have to be made. At first, the Political Agent must return to his ship each night; but in the coiirsQ of time, as he becomes better known and confidence is established, I hope he will be invited to stay ashore for ever lengthening periods. 15. My policy is gradually to restore, and improve on, the position which existed before the Hyacinth episode, when, as Sir Percy Cox reported, 'No definite objection Avas ever evinced to the occasional sojourn of approved Europeans.' Having regained this position we can more easily, should we so desire, locate a British Political Agent ashore without fear of trouble. I his policy is to be adopted if the Trucial Shaikhs do not compel ns to take steinei measures to force through our air route. At present, the Shaikh of Rasal Ivhaimah is showing himself obstinate in his refusal of all requests for a refuelling station at his headquarters. Ihe Shaikh of Hamariyah, a dependency of Shargab, however has offered to rent a store-room for the use 1 of the Royal Air Force if h* Jagoon s houla prove useful to them as a flying boat harbour. The example of this oliaikh, Abdul Ralnman bin Saif, will prove of use in breaking down the opposition o otJiers on the coast, and the question of obtaining store-rooms will become one ot pounds, shillings and pence. The Royal Air Force will not be content with store-houses, however. They desire to have aerodromes, wireless stations, and rest-houses. \ 1 he erection of a wireless station formed part of the ultimatum to the Shaikh of Dubaim 1911, which was subsequently allowed to lapse. The Royal Air Force wish to settle on this coast, and this means closer contact with the coast Arabs. I h'' ive ^ para. .11 stated the final result of close contact between a strong civilised Power and a weak barbarian State. &amp; 16. The Goyernment of India do not desire increased commitments, but they are bound to come. His Majesty's Government must be prepared, in course of time, to9 protect their fneudly Shaikhs by armed force against attack by land or sea The position of the J racial pnucipabties, which have a hinterland of desert, should make this a comparatively easy task, but it is an unfortunate fact that the closer the contact with the British power the more defenceless do the rulers become and, consequently the more dependent on British support. ^ This however, is for the future For the present, in connection with the air 'J anticipate no great trouble in obtaining store-houses for petrol, but dlfficukies wiH increase when we demand wireless stations manned by a permanent staff. J he Residency Agent is sufficient to meet the initial demands of the lloyal Air Howe, but as these increase the need for a resident Political Agent will increase. wlJ1 t0 appointed eventually, but 1 recommend that an attempt be made 10 prepare the way for the appointment. 17. Jo sum up: (I) Ihe system of succession by murder, however inhuman, does not of itselt necessarily lend to undue insecurity, as it is purely a family concern We may deprecate it, but, except at the cost of interference in internal affairs, the tnal result of which cannot^ be forecasted, we cannot prevent it. I myself made a slight move during my last visit to the coast by addressing a letter to eacb Shaikh in which 1 stated that fratricide was abhorrent to God and man, and asked their assistance m suppressing it by themselves refusing to acknowledge the succession of a iratricide._ Ihe Shaikhs one and all agreed with me in the polite Arab fashion, but i do not anticipate any great result from this pronouncement. (2) At present there is no undue interference on the coast. We have certain duties to perform in connection with the slave trade and the protection of British subjects, and it is only in connection with the performance of these duties that we jateriere. (3) The projected air service down the coast has brought the time for the establishment of a Political Agent at Dubai considerably nearer ; but as a first step the people should be lamiliarised with the prospect by frequent visits of a British omcer m the despatch boat which is absolutely necessary to carry out this scheme. (4) Ihe Shaikhs of the Irucial Coast are well disposed, provided we confine our selves to the sea, but are extremely jealous of European penetration, which thev see must ultimately lead to the extinction of their independence. Every Shaikh, however well disposed he may be personally, must consider the junta and must walk warily, ihe coastal Shaikhs are by no means devoid of the avarice of the Semites, but thanks to the pearl trade they are not in the same state of poverty as the Shaikhs of the Aden residency area, and consequently their price is much higher. (5) I do not recommend the immediate appointment of a Political Agent to reside on the coast unless His Majesty's Government is forced to adopt this course by the urgent demands of the Arab air route. (6) i can suggest no means of excluding Wahabi propaganda except self-interest. An u infidel' Political Agent will never be able to withstand the agents of an all-conquering Bin Saud ; but a population accustomed to the luxuries of life will not wish to be subjected to Wahabi fanaticism. M t ^ e population had acquired a taste for the advantages of civilisation and the loluical Agent interferes no mere than is absolutely necessary to protect British interests, the Trucial Coast should defy Wahabi propaganda just as our fleet and Air rorce can repulse a military attack. If the inhabitants remain in their present backward state, I see no remedy against propaganda except the word of Bin Saud and the playing off of Ghafiri against lianawi. We can, if we wish, make ourselves •extremely unpleasant to the Trucial Shaikhs and their subjects; indeed, by cutting •off supplies and the seizure of pearling dhows we can kill all these small principalities, but by proceeding to extremes we certainly run a risk of antagonising world opinion, which appears to be on the look-out for any stick which offers for beating the British Empire.

Barrett, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. British Residency and Consulate-General, Sir, Bushire, 28t1i August 1929. I have the honour to refer to your letter No. F. 164-N./29 df the 28th May 1929 ::: ' asking me to examine the whole question of British interference in the Bahrain administration, with a view to deciding how far it is possible and expedient now to retrace the steps Avhich have been taken. 2. The history of the development of our concern in the internal affairs of the islands is fully set forth in Lieut.-Col. Ha worth's Despatch to the Government of India, No. 295 S., of 1st September 1927,1 so it is unnecessary to repeat it. I wish, however, to stress the following points :— (а) In 1869 we had installed Shaikh Isa as ruler of the islands, and it was entirely due to our support that he had been able to keep his position. (б) From 1877 to 1900 we attempted, with our advice, to improve internal conditions, but were most concerned about financial conditions and particularly the Customs administration. (c) From 1904, with the appointment of a British Political Agent to Bahrain after the visit of Lord Curzon, our interest in internal matters increased, and we continued to press Shaikh Isa with good advice. He, however, seemed more concerned with preserving his independence from us, than with conciliating us, by whom only his independence could be maintained. (d) In 1904, following on riots in which Persians and a German were concerned, and in which Shaikh Isa was first supine and then obstructive, the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, advocated vigorous measures against him, as he was 44 only encouraged in his obstinacy by our continued forbearance.' The most important results of our intervention were the abolition of Shukra so far as foreigners were concerned, the banishment to Bombay of the leader of the anti-Persian riots (who was Shaikh Isa's own nephew), and the assumption by the Political Agent of jurisdiction over foreigners. The Shaikh was reminded of his assurances to follow the advice of the Political Resident. In this case the impossibility of obtaining justice for Shiahs from the Sunni Qadhis was brought to notice. In connection with these events Major Cox reported :— 'I do not see how w^e can expect anything but periodical trouble from a continuation of our laudable endeavours ^ to carry on the government of the islunds through the rule of a chief who has shown himself to possess few, if any, of the qualifications necessary for the maintenance of order, the security of persons and of trade. He was accordingly in favour of stronger measures, but His Majesty's Government decided that the amelioration of the internal government should be sought by indirect and pacific means. T1 . , , , . . (e) In 1919 Shaikh Abdulla's interview with Sir Arthur Hirtzel showed how the P. 5649/29. Ruler chafed against the interference of the Political Agent in the matter of jurisdiction over foreigners and appointments to the Bench oi Magistrates. Although the Political Agent possessed these powers, he was powerless to (f) The P gross oppression from which the deposition of Shaikh Isa in 1923 rescued the people--especially the Baharanah, and the opening that this oppression gave to foreign nations—especially the Persians and the \\ aualins.

(a) Colonel Knox brought to the notice of Government that the whole management of affairs would more and more come into the hands of the Political Agent. . t Repnntedas Enclosure No. 2 to Teheran Despatch to Foreign Office, No. 484, of 7th October 1927 [P. 5668/27]. 4005 50 10.292 (h) With an uneducated Arab, independence means the power to do many things of which we do not approve. It means administering the islands for the sake of the Chief of the tribes, exploiting the people for the rulers, and treating the Shiahs as a people of an unprivileged class. (/) Government, and not the Political Agent, finally had to insist on threats instead of advice. _ ft (j) Shaikh Hamad is a pleasant man but weak, and it is idle to pretend he and his brothers would not backslide. To relax too much means to go through the same grind as we have come. 3, Throughout the history of Bahrain during the twentieth century, the fear of interference displayed by the Government of India is apparent. In 1904 they decided ' to pursue a cautious policy.' Later, the Political Agent was to 'seek the amelioration of the internal government by indirect and pacific means, and by gaining the confidence and trust of the Shaikh.' In 1922 they &lt;{ did not desire to be drawn into interference between the Shaikh and his people.' 'Government are not prepared to act until they are satisfied all local resources are exhausted.' Yet it was this Government, who were so obviously and sincerely anxious to avoid interference, which finally had to order the Political Resident to take the steps which led to the deposition of the Ruler. They never, however, forgot their original policy, and within a couple of months are again warning the Political Agent to be on hia guard against being tempted to interfere too much, or to become the administrative officer rather than the adviser. It is obvious that Government did their very best to avoid the action of 1923; but it was forced on them by the gross tyranny of the A1 Khalifa, whom Shaikh Isa made no attempt to restrain, and by the pressure of the London Foreign Office, fearful of the reaction in Persia of the oppression 6f a Shiah population, and because ' misrule would be the only serious flaw in our case if the status of Bahrain and our position in the Islands was brought before the League of Nations.' 4. The point to remember now is that Shaikh Isa, the Ruler, was not bad natured at heart. Although obstinate in rejecting all advice from the Political Agents as derogatory to his position as an independent ruler, he was easy-going and had a strong dislike for interfering with the actions of members of his family even when these took the form of gross tyranny. The family—the A1 Khalifa—-were uneducated savages with a veneer of town manners. The outlook of Shaikh Isa and his family was as is described in para. 2 (h) above. Now Shaikh Hamad is extremely amiable, with a constitutional disinclination to take strong measures on any subject. Even as a judge, his inclination is to acquit an obvious criminal and himself to pay a fine imposed. Such a man—except in tlie fact that he is younger and has seen changes taking place around him and that he is, in consequence, less conservative—is not to be differentiated from his father. Just as his father permitted oppression, but did not actively oppress, so would Hamad act. With the exception of Shaikh Khalid, all the old oppressors are still alive and willing to resume their former ways if not repressed. Shaikh Hamad would certainly not repress them if deprived of active British support ami direction. To this day his weakness in any matter connected with the A! Khalifa is pathetic. In ordinary matters also, in spite of the presence in Bahrain of a British adviser, he truckles to any show of force. In May of this year he reversed a decision he had made the previous day regarding the amount of advance to divers because a mob of 20 ) unarmed men made a clamour in his Majlis. It is certainly better that Shaikh Hamad should govern and make mistakes than that we should govern and make none, but a man of his type, who w T ill not incur the odium of governing, must have an adviser. If the European adviser were removed, Shaikh Hamad would surely fall under the influence of some intriguing Syrian or Egyptian who-would, for a consideration, play into the hands of Persia or Najd. It was the defencelessness of the Bahrain Government in the face of gang robberies which led to the institution of the Indian armed police. These police had to he foreign as the Bahrain Arab was averse from wearing uniform, had an objection to an occupation unconnected with boats, and disliked binding himself to fixed penods of duty. The armed police are still necessary, but it may be possible to make them less obstrusively foreign by substituting Sudanese for Indians, directly the contract of the latter expires at the beginning of 1931. Owing to the large number of olackb, descended from slaves domiciled in the islands, the Sudanese would melt int Si t ^ 1 la ^ dsca P e ^ a wa y the Indians fail to do. Mr. Belgrave, the present adviser to Shaikh Hamad, has experience of Sudanese, having served with them in Kgyp^ during the war. I would have recommended that the present European Commandantof Police whose four-year contract expires about the same time—should depart with the Indian policemen at the end of 1930. In view, however, of the probability that Bahrain may shortly have to submit to an influx of American and other foreign drillers and oil workers, I do not think it advisable to dispense with the services of a European Commandant of Police unless and until we are satisfied that the threatened invasion which would certainly include a number of tough characters—will not take place. On the analogy of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the (Skilf Syndicate would probably start a security service of its own, and the Bahrain 3tate' will require a European Commandant of Police to deal with it, and with the bad characters attracted by the chance of employment. 5. I turn no^ to the Customs Department. This Was an old bone of contention between Shaikh Isa and the Government of India. It was Colonel Mead who first suggested bringing it under control, under the mistaken assumption that Shaikh Isa was really as poor as he pretended when the pretence suited him. In any case, the question of the Customs Department came for a time to be looked upon as a trial of strength between Shaikh Isa and the Government of India. The old system was to farm out the Customs to a Hindu contractor and, as was only to be expected, the revenue accruing to' the State was much less than it should have been. This loss was estimated at one lakh of rupees a year, but judging from the yield of the Customs since it has been put under conscientious European control, it must have been considerably more. Customs is the main source of revenue to the State and brought in during the past year Rs. .11,24,679, out of a total of Ps. 12,15,694. The Director of Customs is not only in charge of the department from which he takes his name, but he is also Port Officer and controls the passports, registration of boats, and various minor revenue departments. Owing to the lack of natives with sufficient education and honesty to take charge of the various departments, a foreigner must be appointed to control them. At present the head is a European. Is anything to be gained by substituting an Egyptian, Syrian or Iraqian ? To the untraftied eye of an Englishman, an Egyptian might look more indigenous than an Englishman, but to a resident of the Gulf he would still be a foreigner. The Customs is not a political department, and in Persia it can be staffed by foreigners without upsetting the political balance; but in a small nation like Bahrain the personality of the man who collects 90 per cent, of the revenues must count for something. As in the case of the Adviser, why jettison a European, who can be trusted, in order to replace him by some foreign Oriental about whose integrity and whose intrigues one can never be sure ? 6. Captain Prior, the present Political Agent at Bahrain, summed up the situation very well in one of his reports to me, when he stated that Mr. de Grenier collects the revenues of the State and Mr. Belgrave conserves them. If the efficient collector and conserver are removed, what is to happen to a State which has become accustomed to a far higher rate of public expenditure than ever before in its history ? Not only have the claims of the idle and ever increasing A1 Khalifa been generously met, but for the first time Bahrain has been administered for the good of its people, and not merely for the benefit of its ruling family. With a decline in revenue, discontent is sure to return. If the European Adviser were removed, his place would be taken by an Arab from Bahrain—almost certainly one of the A1 Khalifa. With the exception of Shaikh Abdulla there is at the moment not a single member of the A1 Khalila fit either by character or education to fill the post. Bahrain in the present day is not such a principality as those of the Trucial Coast, slumbering in the conditions of the seventh century. Thanks to its geographical situation as the gateway to Najd and to the pearl trade of which it is the centre, it has always been a trading centre, and has attracted to itself a number of foreigners, who are in contact with the outside world. Thanks to the interest taken by the Government of India in 1923, its administration, once a by-word, is now the admiration of the Gulf. The more enlightened citizens of Dubai, for instance, envy Bahrain, though the ruling Shaikhs have no desire to copy it. , 7. It has repeatedly been said that Bahiain has been westernised too i, hurriedly. It is necessary to examine this statement, for although there is a substratum of truth in it, I think it conveys a wrong impression that all native institutions have been ruthlessly swept away. The reforms instituted in Or shortly before 192o related to (a ) Municipalities. (b ) Reorganisation of the Customs Department. (c) Institution of a proper police force. - ,4 (d ) Appointment of an Adviser to the Shaikh. (e ) Reformed Courts. - (f ) Reforms in connection with the pearl fishery. (g ) Survey. (h) Public Works. (i) Education. (j) Reform of the Waqfs. I will take the above seriatim. (a ) Before and during the war Bahrain was notorious for its unhealthy climate; the stench was indescribable and plague visited it every alternate year. In the course of years the people of Manama, the chief trading town, had been becoming more and more enlightened by contact with the outside world. A demand for greater cleanliness arose, and in spite of the opposition of Shaikh Isa, the demand, backed by Major Dickson (the Political Agent), prevailed and a municipality was established in 1920. This municipality still exists and in 1927 was followed by the establishment of another in Muharraq. The two Municipal Councils—the members of which are partly nominated by the Ruler and partly elected—are presided over by Shaikh Hamad's brother, the Political Agent and the Adviser attend the meetings, but take little part in the proceedings unless asked for guidance. In 1920 a considerable part of the population looked upon the Manama municipality as an objectionable foreign innovation, but it is now recognised as a valuable portion of the administration. The Muharraq municipality was established in 1927 in consequence of popular demand, without consulting the Political Agent. People recognise that if the municipalities were abolished filth and plague would return. The benefit derived from the presence at municipal meetings of the Political Agent and the Adviser, who have no vote, is to lend a certain decorum to the proceedings, which otherwise have a tendency to become pandemonium. They do not interfere unduly, and their complete withdrawal from interest in municipal affairs would be unpopular. (b), (c ) and ( d ) have already been treated in paras. 4 and 5 above. (e ) Major Daly's report on the state of affairs in 1921 shows the conditions from which Bahrain was rescued. These conditions were largely due to the lack of any Court of Law which could deal efficiently with offenders. The minor members of the Khalifa family terrorised the people just as they wished. The Qadhis were corrupt or impotent. A good Court of Law T was a crying need, but the difficulty was to find a suitable magistrate. At first the Political Agent (Major Daly) sat as adviser to the local magistrate, but with the arrival of Mr. Belgrave he resigned his position to the latter. At present there are the following Courts functioning in Bahrain :— (1) The Joint Court, on which the Ruler and the Political Agent sit to hear cases, civil and criminal, involving foreign and Bahrain subjects in which the latter are defendants. There is also a small Joint Court presided over by the Indian Assistant and a minor A1 Khalifa. (2) The Political Agent's Court, for the trial of all cases in which foreigners are concerned. (3) The Court of Shaikh Sulaiman, eldest son of Shaikh Hamad, assisted and advised by Mr. Belgrave, for the trial of Bahrain subjects. (4) The Small Cause Court, conducted by a minor member of the A1 Khalifa. In the first case all disputes are referred to one or other of these Courts. They usually deal themselves with criminal cases, though a considerable number are referred to the Qadhis for settlement by the taking of oath. Civil cases, almost without . exception, are referred to the Qadhis, the Majlis al Urfi or the Salifah Court for opinion. Judgment usually follows the opinion. The indigenous Courts are :— (a) The Court of the Qadhis—Bunni or Shiah as the case may be. (5) The Majlis al Urfi. (c) The Salifah or Diving Court. The Qadhis are the usual Islamic Courts having jurisdiction in all personal matters, divorces, inheritances, &amp;c. They often advise in criminal matters, but their peculiar laws of evidence and the sharp differences between Shiah and Sunni make it impossible to hand criminal justice completely over to them. The Majlis al Urfi is the Court dealing with this customary law of trade. It is the commercial Court and all disputed commercial cases are referred to it. There are20 members. Its meetings are weekly—10 members sitting on alternate Thursdays^ iiader an Al Khalifa president. It deals with trade disputes, on the whole expeditiously and well. Its members are all appointed by Shaikh Hamad subject, in the case of foreign members, to the Political Agent's veto. The Salifah consists of three Arab experts versed in the customary law relating to diving. Before 1923 this Court consisted of one venal old man, whose decisions were disgrace to the State. Xow, except for a bias against foreigners, it functions satisfactorily. From this description it will be seen that except in the Court of the Political Agent--established under the Order in Council—a member of the Al Khalifa is associated with all the proceedings of justice. Even the Political Agent's Court refers many matters for native opinion and advice. As already stated, the Al Khalifa are uneducated and ignorant, and it would be impossible for them to manage affairs without the support given them by the Political Agent or the Adviser. Both Shaikh Hamad-—when he can be aroused to interest him self—and his son, Sulaiman, on all occasions, are excellent in dealing with cases demanding local knowledge; but as they themselves confess, they would not pass sentences of death or take action against prominent men without the support of their advisers. In the course of time Shaikh Sulaiman may get sufficient courage to stand on his own feet. A successor will be trained to take his place when he succeeds his father in the rulership or gets tired of his magisterial work. ( f ) Before 1923 the divers were wholly in the hands of their nakhudas and the merchants, who worked through the single venal member of the Salifah. Now a proper system of accounts has been established and, thanks to the supervision of the Courts over the Salifah, the divers have very little cause for complaint. Their lot, from being the worst, has become the best in the Gulf. (g ) Bahrain, in addition to town sites, has an extensive area under gardens. It ivas found that Shaikh Isa, as Lord of the Soil, in his happy-go-lucky way, had frequently sold or gifted the same area to two or even three different persons. The result was innumerable disputes, which could only be terminated by careful enquiry followed by an accurate survey. A survey of all towns and of certain village areas followed. At first the survey of villages was resented, as people could not understand the reason for it, but now they have come to realise its benefits. Those villages which have not hitherto been surveyed, owing to paucity of staff, have begun to demand that a survey should be carried out immediately. (h ) Public works have not been numerous, and there is no regular Public Works Department; but public utility works, such as the sea wall and the road alongside it, are much appreciated. One of the results of these works is that the inhabitants of Kuwait and other ports are apt to point to the deficiencies of their home towns and get into trouble with their Shaikhs, but the leaven works. If Bahrain continues on his own initiative to supply public gardens and walks, start electric schemes and carry out works for the public benefit, such as the proposed causeway from Manama to Muharraq, it is sure, by its example, to ameliorate the conditions in its lesser advanced sisters on the Arab coast, and wean ihem from that surly isolation in which most of them live. 1 mention 'on its own initiative ' because all public utility schemes—except the Manama sea wall and road, which are the work of Major Daly—were conceived by Bahrain subjects themselves, though they have looked to their European advisers for guidance. The British name is benefited by this progress. (i) Education is still backward, but thanks to the push of Shaikh Abdulla, the Ruler's brother, it has made immense strides during the past two years. The drive in this case has come wholly from Bahrain subjects themselves Except in the matter of making hitherto fruitless efforts to persuade Shaikh Hamad to educate his •own sons, neither the Political Agent nor the Adviser has taken any steps unduly to push education, although their services in obtaining masters from Iraq have been ■put at the service of the State when asked. Syrian and Iraqi masters have been imported in most cases without the intervention of the Political Agent or Adviser, at good salaries, and there are now five indigenous Arabic boys' schools arid one girls' school on the island, in addition to two Persian nationalist schools. In addition, eight Bahrain boys, including three close relations of the Ruling Chief, have been sent to the American University at Beirut for education. I trust that these three boys will turn out well, and with Shaikh Mubarak—the most promising of the sons of Shaikh Hamad—will provide material for the higherappointments in the State, and ultimately will prove competent to take over the position now held by the European Adviser and Customs Director. (j) Waqfs are eminently a religions matter in which it behoves foreigners, especiallv non-Muslims, to walk very warily. , • ■ i i i Just before his departure, Major Daly, moved by certain bad scandals, attempted to take action to reform the Waqfs, but his successor decided it would be best not to interfere and to trust to the public opinion that was being stirred by the liberal policy of the State. The policy of non-interference appears to be justifying itself. Recently the Shiahs themselves Appointed a committee which took over their Waqfs from the Qadhi. If the Sunnis follow suit, darge sums now pocketed by the Qadhis may become available for primary education. 8. I have examined the present conduct of affairs in Bahrain and I see nothing- that can be profitably altered at the present moment. Innovations which met with opposition in 192o aie now accepted as the ordnnuy scheme of things ; and the Bahrain merchants look forward to the development of air communication under British auspices. The unpopularity of the British Government, which was worked up in the Arabic and other Press, has now disappeared and their good works are appreciated. In time the good works and the tyranny from which the British rescued Bahrain, and especially the Shiah Baharanab, will be forgotten, and only the privileged position of the British occupying the chief posts ,will be- no ticed. To avoid the odium which would fall on Britain, in course of time, from this, cause, it is necessary to educate natives of Bahrain to take the place of the British officials. 9. Captain Prior, Political Agent at Bahrain, thinks that a useful understudy for: Mr. de Grenier offers in Abdulla bin Shaikh Ibrahim al Khalifa—at present a third- year student at the American University in Beirut. He has industry, hut unfortunately no great aptitude for arithmetic. Captain Prior thinks, however, that when he has completed his course at Beirut he might be sent to India for training; in the Customs Department at Bombay or Karachi, before being appointed to the Bahrain Customs with a view eventually to taking over charge. I consider Captain Prior's proposal very sound and recommend it lor adoption.. If Abdulla bin Shaikh Ibrahim's indifferent arithmetic is a bar to the efficient performance of his duties, one of his, younger cousins—Shaikh Khalifa bin Shaikh Mahomed or Shaikh Hamad bin Shaikh Abdulla, nephews of the present Deputy Ruler —who are first-year students, might later be selected for training. 10. There remains the question of a successor to the Adviser. Although Government do not appear to desire the immediate removal of Mr. Belgrave, this- question must be considered. Shaikh Hamad, the Deputy Ruler, is an amiable nonentity. Captain Prior, in alluding to his weakness and the impossibility of allowing him to stand on his own feet, has stated truly: ' So long as he can enjoy the pleasures of the harem, get shooting and hawking, and enough money to support him with a little pomp and pride of place, he does hot mind what happens to Bahrain.' : t Such a man must have an adviser on whom he can lean. His natural adviser is his eldest son, Sulaiman, age about 35, who will probably succeed him Sulaiman is not without promise; he is intelligent and is gaining valuable experience on the magisterial bench, but he is uneducated and in some ways little removed from a Bedu. The only really capable member of the Al Khalifa family is Shaikh Hamad &amp; brother, Abdulla, who is self-educated, but is unfortunately distrusted by the people owing to his,previous evil record. i Of Shaikh Hamad's sons the one who shows most promise is Shaikh Mubarajv the fourth son. In my letter No. 366 S. of 21st August 1929 I have already recommended that a good tutor should be obtained for him. It is hoped that m clue course he may be given a chance to acquire administrative experience so as to be a help first to his father and then to his brother, Sulaiman, who has no son to follow after him, and that he may in due course be able to perform the functions now falling to the European Adviser. 11. With the spread of education it should be possible to conduct the adnuntf tration of Bahrain without any British interference in internal affairs in a 111 which will not shame us. At present, owing to the weakness of the Deputy lui e and the lack of men of suitable character, this is impossible.1 have laid particular stress on education in the rulers because the merchant classes in Bahrain, both foreign and native, are advancing rapidly in this respect • and the public are demanding more schools, technical education, increased medical help and trained midwives, and larger public works. A go-ahead population cannot permanently be ruled by uneducated tribesmen any more than Moroccan tioops could permanently hold down the Rhine provinces. Bahrain is a large trading centre with a large foreign population. It is not part of Najd and would never be happy under Wahabi rule. The real Bahraini, though an Arab, is a Slnali, not a Sunni; and the history of the islands shows that for long periods it \yas subject to Persia. This, although not leading to any desire for Persian rule, must modify the tribal outlook. 12. I am in favour of an indigenous Arab Government standing on its own feet; but you cannot -without grave risk of bloodshed—rapidly reverse all that has been done in the j^ast six years. The Baharanah, for the first time since the Khalifa ousted the Persians, have had security and justice and have come to think of their rights. After tasting these sweets they will not lightly forgo them. 13. The evils of unadulterated Arab rule and the tribal system are exemplified by the recent blood-stained record of Umin al Quwaim and Abu Dhabi or, to take bigger people from history, the Bani Rashid rulers of Hail or the Saiyids of Oman. &amp; To quote from an interesting review by Mr. B. S. Thomas appearing in the Near East and India of 18th July, page 78 :— ' The first act of young Said bin Sultan was to decoy his regent uncle and to assassinate him. This ' will to power' was applauded by the country. It was no strange means to employ. Incidentally Said's successor, Thuwaini, w T as destined to be murdered by his own son, Salim, who thereupon succeeded to the Sultanate. During the past five years fratricide, a time-honoured institution for the purpose, has on three several occasions been responsible for a change of Shaikhship in the powerful Omaai tribes of Bani Ali and Bani Yas.' J Government interfered with the free working of the Arab system first when they -placed Shaikh Isa in his father's room in 1869 and again wdien they replaced him by ; Shaikh Hamad in 1923. Under the Arab system Abdulla might have removed Shaikh Isa—he would -certainly have removed Shaikh Hamad. Government is disturbed by the blood-stained record of Oman; they could not now permit similar occurrences in Bahrain. 14. We have to make the best of Shaikh Hamad and he must have an adviser— ■either European or Arab—or in the alternative take upon himself the role of a constitutional king, confine his activities mainly to social affairs and leave business in the hands of a Council. This Council system might well be tried, but onty after the death of Shaikh Isa. The old Shaikh has retired from active interest in affairs, but he still counts for something, and his naturally conservative tendency renders him opposed to all change. In addition, on the score of expense to the State, it is not desirable that Bahrain, which is already paying a pension of Rs. 5,000 yearly to Shaikh Isa, should be saddled with an idle Hamad. I anticipate no serious opposition from Shaikh Hamad himself to the idea of a ■Council, provided he is still titular and social head. It will give him a chance of that otium cum dignitate for which he craves. The members of the Council might in the first place be Shaikhs Abdulla bin Isa and Sulaiman bin Hamad, with the Adviser as third member, under the presidency of Shaikh Abdulla, with Shaikh Mubarak marked to succeed eventually to the Adviser's place. 15. I wish to emphasise that even at present there is considerably more Arab- control of the Bahrain administration than would appear at first sight. In consequence, the present administration is popular in the islands. I agree, however, that the British are too much in the high-lights, and that the signs of British influence appear loo clearly in the Indian police force trained like an Indian infantry regiment though their uniform has been modified. I recommend that this high-light be modified by substituting Sudanese, an Arab-speaking force, which blends better with the population. I recommend further that, unless a European is required to deal with an influx of Europeans and Americans attracted by the Gulf Oil Company, the serviceof the European Commandant of Police be dispensed with at the termination of his present contract, bnt that the services of the Advisei and the Dhectoi of Customs he retained until suitable Arab substitutes have been trained to take tlieii place. 16. Shaikh Hamad has already extended the term of the Advisor's contract till March 1934. It will probably be necessary to grant him at least two further quaternary extensions. win- ^ It is difficult to say when a substitute will be ready to replace Mr. de Cxremer; but the period required for training cannot be less than seven years from now. 17. As the coming of an oil company is still problematical, 1 have not discussed this matter at length. If the company should materialise it will of itself westernise the islands in possibly an unfortunate'way, and I presume there would have to be a British element in the administration to counteract its effects. 18. It appears from para. 2 of your letter under reply that Government is purturbed at the danger that, with the example of Bahrain before their eyes, the minds of the smaller Arab rulers may be turned increasingly in-the direction of Bin Saud. It is true that the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast are extremely jealous of -any British encroachment on their independence, just as Shaikh Isa was before his forced relinquishment of (power. They oppose any concession to the European. I do not, however, ascribe this attitude wholly to the events in Bahrain. It is due far more to the natural exclusiveness of the Arab. A certain section of Arab thought would exclude the foot of the infidel throughout the holy land of Arabia, from Aden as well as from Mecca. No attempt had been made to westernise Bahrain when the Eyaeinth episode of 1911.occurred. It is from this incident and the comparative immunity from evil consequences enjoyed by the people of Dubai that I date the increasingly independent attitude of the Trucial Shaikhs. Sir Percy Cox stated at the time that the incident furnished a convenient peg on which the Shaikh of Dubai could hang his objections to the admission of Europeans to the coast, flis statement was true in 1911 and is. true to this day; but the British policy in Bahrain obviously cannot be blamed for this. If we interfere in Bahrain to put down misrule, depose its Shaikh, introduce reforms and then permit the country to sink back into the slough from which we have rescued it, then indeed will we have forfeited Arab respect and cleared the way for Bin Saud. In 1920, Major Dickson reported : ' Our position in the island is founded', on fear and not respect.' Now it is founded on respect. The Trucial Chiefs now see that our intervention has benefited Bahrain and even its Chiefs. We cannot, expect them immediately to call in British advisers on their owm account, but in time their aversion from contact with the European may be overcome through the influence of a civilised Bahrain. It will not be overcome through a reversion of Bahrain to the conditions of 1920. If it suits Bin Sand, he will intrigue in Oman as his fathers did before him. The attitude of the Shaikhs of the coast will be guided by self-interest as it has ever been. If we have consistently and with success espoused their cause against Persia and Najd they will look to us for support. If we have shown no great energy in supporting their case against third parties, they will be discouraged and more easily succumb to Najd intrigue. If Bin Saud emerges victorious from his present troubles, it is possible that he will seek to extend his influence on the coast and cause us trouble as Keza Shah has in Persia ; but I do not see how the situation in Bahrain will affect the issue. All Arabs criticised our action in Bahrain when the supporters of the old regime were crying out under chastisement. The chastisement was salutary and Shaikh Isa's supporters have accepted the present regime, which is not unduly westernised. I have shown some ways in which the outward form maj^ be modified while retaining the spirit, but I do not advise the jettisoning of useful European officials nor the taking of any steps other than those I have indicated. 19. I am much indebted to Captain Prior, now Political Agent at Bahrain, for a long report, on which, and my own experience of the islands during periods extenoing over two and a half years, I have based these observations.

India Office Exercise of Jurisdiction in Gases affecting Foreign Subjects in Bahrein by the British Political Authorities. Jurisdiction over British Subjects. 1. Article 4 of the Convention of 1861 between the Sheikh of Bahrein and the British Government provides that ' all offences which they (British subjects) may commit, or which may be committed against them, shall be reserved for the decisions of the British Resident, provided the British Ao-ent located at Bahrein shall fail to adjust them satisfactorily.' Jurisdiction in Cases affecting Foreigners. 2. By the Agreement of 22nd December 1880 and the Exclusive Agreement of 13th March 1892, the Sheikh bound himself not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any Governments other than His Majesty's Government; not to allow the Agents/of such Governments to reside within bis territory without the assent of His Majesty's Government; and not to alienate, mortgage, or give for occupation any part of his territories save to His Majesty's Government. Responsibility for the protection of foreigners in Bahrein may be regarded as having passed to His Majesty's Government as a corollary to these two Agreements. But the question of jurisdiction does not appear to have arisen in an active form until 1900. In December of that year the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, reported that a German/subject, Mr. Wonckhaus, intended to open a branch of his business in Bahrein. The Political Resident suggested that, in the event of any mercantile or other cases arising between Bahreini subjects and Mr. Wonckhaus or his agent, the Assistant Political Agent should be instructed to deal with such cases as if they were cases between British subjects and subjects of the Sheikh. 3. The Government of India informed the Political Resident in reply that ' Mr. Wonckhaus being a foreigner and not a protected person, the Assistant Political Agent cannot claim any jurisdiction in such cases. Mr. Wonckhaus and his agent, if a foreigner and not a native Indian subject of His Majesty, must be regarded as liable in such cases to the jurisdiction of the Sheikh. ' As, however, the Sheikh is bound, under treaty, not to admit the consular agencies of other nations without the consent of the British Lr. d. 4 May 1901, Government, it is expedient that the British representative should, as a l Desp^ matter of courtesy, extend his good offices to European foreigners in any of 9 May 1901 disputes between them and the Chief of Bahrein or his subjects, and, in the p - 614 / 01 - event of necessity, he should claim to protect all such foreigners as he would a British subject. I am to reqiiest that Mr. Gaskin ma}^ be instructed to this effect.' The action taken by the Government of India was subsequently approved Secret Desp. to by His Majesty's Government. Iff ^ ■ of 4. In June 1903, the question having arisen of the purchase by Mr. p ' 2061 / 01 - Wonckhaus of certain premises in Bahrein which he had hitherto held on a temporary lease, the Government of India instructed the Political Resident as follows :—' In view ... of the belief which Mr. Wonckhaus is reported to hold that, in the event of his acquiring property, he will not be amenable to local law, but will be subject to the extra-territorial jurisdiction of Courts of his own country (though there are none such with local jurisdiction in Bahrein), the Government of India approve your proposal to warn the Sheikh of Bahrein that no such acquisition can give to any Consul or other representative of a foreign nation the right to enter into direct relations with Lr. from o. of 1. to the Chief, and that, should any such official address the Chief, he should be ^ ^une^os 1 - 56 ^ referred to the British authorities. The position should also be clearly p. 845/03.' explained to Mr. W0nckhaus. ,, 4371 75 3.302 5. No dispute involving the question of jurisdiction over foreigners Lor. i, pp. 938-942. appears to have arisen in Bahrein until 1904. In 1904—5 two incidents affecting foreign subjects took place in the Islands. In the lirst of these, a German subject—an employee of Messrs. Wonckhaus—became involved in a brawl, in the course of which lie suffered personal injuries. Failing, as he thought, to secure adequate redress through the Political Agent, to whom Lr. from Poi. Kos. his first complaint was addressed, Mr. Wonckhaus made representations to of li Dec' 1904 420 ' t ^ e ^ erraan Consul at Basra, who addressed the Sheikh direct on the p. 293/05. ' subject. His Excellency, in reply, acknowledged the letter and added, 'I have how to inform you that this matter is before the British Government, and I cannot say anything on the subject.' 1 The Foreign Office at a later stage instructed the Charge d'Affaires at Berlin that, should representations be made to him in the matter by the German Government, he should state 1904 ^o^ei' 5 ]DeC ' t ^ at ^ fc ^ eea brought to the notice of His Majesty's Government, and that p. 3540/64. ' a British ship would be sent to Bahrein in order that an inquiry might be instituted. The German Government do not appear to have taken any Lr. from Poi. Res. action. The German Consul at Basra subsequently thanked the Tolitical of n Dec 'i904 421 ' l^sident 4£ for your efficient help to the German firm, which, I trust, settles para. 26 ; P.293 /0O. the Case.' G. In the second case (November 1904), an accidental quarrel having arisen between a retainer of the Sheikh's nephew and a Persian, attacks were made upon Persian subjects in Bahrein. Apprehensive that the Sheikh would endeavour to deal with the case in the local Courts, they telegraphed for support to the Shah, and conversations took place between His Majesty's Minister and the Mushir-ud-Dowleh, as the result of which the latter telegraphed to the Persian community urging them to keep calm, as ''I have had a long talk with the British Minister . . . and I am sure he will p. 293,05. take early steps to get the affairs settled and the culprit punished.' The Sheikh, however, adopted an uncompromising attitude on the question of jurisdiction, maintaining that he would not admit any interference ' in cases between Arabs and Persians, who were all Mohammedans,' and that they must go before the local Shara Courts, which, composed as they were of Sunnis, were unlikely to do justice to the Shiah Persians, Argument proving unavailing, an ultimatum was presented to His Excellency. He accepted the demands of 11 is Majesty's Government, and though no -specific reference to the point was made in the ultimatum, the jurisdiction of the Political Agent appears thenceforth to have been definitely established, as a a matter of practice, in respect of British and foreign subjects in Bahrein. 7. Correspondence took place between 1908 and 1911 in regard to the preparation of an Order in Council to confer jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners in the Islands on the Political Agent at Bahrein. It was decided that it was desirable to obtain a formal request Jrom the Sheikh that he should be relieved of jurisdiction over foreigners. After discussion with the Political Agent, His Excellency addressed the latter on Kkh July 1909, in the following terms:—' After compliments. It is not hidden from you that 1 have had considerable trouble in many cases (that arose) in my territory in which foreigners were involved. For this reason I wish that I may not be held responsible in these cases, and I would be grateful to British Government if they remove this trouble and responsibility from me. I mean that it (the British Government) should exercise authority in all cases in which the foreigners only are concerned, but not in other cases ; and in cases that occur between foreigners and my subjects, it is necessary that you and 1 should settle them jointly.' 8. The Political Resident remarked, with reference to the reservation contained in the concluding sentence of the Sheikh's letter, 'As its effect is simply that such cases will be disposed of by the joint Court, and gives G r of r nNoI'i863, to f ore W iers tlle same treatment that British subjects now receive, there seems d. 3i July 1909. ' no need for exception to be taken to it.' 9. The Sheikh subsequently represented that his letter of 10th Jnly 1909, giving jurisdiction over foreigners to the British Government, was intended only 44 to cover subjects of recognised Powers and not the dependents ol petty Arab potentates in Gulf, with some of whom he claimsmm ■T of 6 July 1912, re- peating tel. from Pol. Res.: P. 2632/12. to have special^ airangements providiiig 1 for reciprocal acceptance of each other 's direct jurisdiction. I informed him that if he could produce Viceroy 's tel. to agreements, and if the other parties, on being referred to, acknowledged s ;° f T s, / 0 ^ Q I 1 :r i &gt; dia their validity, I thought we should be prepared to recognise them . .' In the light of the protest in question, the wording of the Draft Order in Oonncil was amended to its present form, under which (Article 8 of the Order in Council of 1913) the power conferred by the Order extends ' to the persons and matters following in so far as by Treaty, grant, usage, sufferance, or other lawful means, His Majesty has jurisdiction in relation to such persons, matters, and things, that is to say :— (1) British subjects as herein defined within the limits of this Order. (2) foreigners wltli respect to whom the Sheikh of BaJwein has agreed with His Majesty for, or consented to, the exercise of jurisdiction hi) His Majesty. (3) Bahrein subjects registered in the Political Agency as being in the regular service of British subjects or foreigners ; with the proviso that all cases wherein such Bahrein subjects are concerned shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Part V of this Order. (4) The expression 'person to whom this Order applies' shall be construed in accordance with the above three sub-Articles. (5) 1 he property and all personal or proprietary rights and liabilities within the said limits of British subjects and of foreigners within sub-Article (2) and of Bahrein subjects within sub-Article (3), whether such persons are themselves within or without the limits of this Order. (6) British ships and ships belonging to foreigners within sub- Article (2) with their boats, and tlie persons and property on board thereof, or belonging thereto, being within the limits of this Order; provided that jurisdiction over foreign ships shall not be exercised otherwise than according to the practice of the High Court in England in the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign ships. (7) If any question arises whether the subjects or citizens of any country. State, or tribe have or have not been placed under the jurisdiction of His Majesty by agreement with, or the consent of, the Sheikh of Bahrein, it shall be referred by the Court to the Political Resident, and a certihcate under his hand and seal shall be conclusive on the question and judicial notice shall be taken thereof.' 10i Part V of the Order, to which reference is made in Article 8 quoted above, deals with the important class of case, whether civil or criminal, in which the parties are respectively a Bahrein subject and a person to whom the Order applies. The procedure laid down in it is as follows : — ' (a) Criminal. Article 41.—(1) When a Bahrein subject desires to institute a complaint against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to institute a complaint against a Bahrein subject, the Political Agent shall entertain the same, and may-— (а) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, himself hear and determine it in his District Court, or (б) send it to the Joint Court, or (c) if the defendant is a Malxommedan, refer it to a Kazi for decision, sending a representative of the Agency to record briefly the proceedings. Such decision, when endorsed by the Political Agent, shall for all purposes be considered as if it were that of the District Court. (2) Nothing in this Article shall prevent the Political Resident from exercising the revisory powers possessed by him under Article 4 of the Convention with Bahrein, dated the 31st May 1861.'' * See para. 1 above.4 (b) Civil. Article 45.—(1) When a Bahrein subject desires to bring a suit against a person to whom this Order applies, or a person to whom this Order applies desires to bring a suit against a Bahiein subjoct, the Political Agent shall admit the complaint, and (а) with the concurrence of the Sheikh of Bahrein, may hear and determine the suit in his District Court, or (б) may hear and determine it in a Joint Couit, or (c) may refer it'to the Majlis-el-Urf for decision, or {d) in cases between pearling-masters and divers, may refer it to the Salifah Court, or (e) with the consent ol the several parties, may refer the case to. one or more Arbitrators for settlement. (2) The judgment of the Joint Court or of the Majlis-el-Urf shall for all purposes be considered the same as if it were that of the District Court. • (3) An appeal from the decision of the Salifah Court shall lie to the Political Agent acting in concert with the Sheikh of Bahrein, and in all Salifah cases their joint decision shall be final. (4) The award of the Arbitrator under Sub-Article 1(e) shall be final, and shall not be open to appeal unless the same shall within a reasonable time have been ordered by the Political Agent to be set aside on the ground that it is not final or is defective, or that the Arbitrator- has exceeded his authority, or has been guilty of misconduct in the matter. (5) Nothing herein mentioned shall, prevent the District Coiirt, the .Joint Court, the Majlis-el-Urf, the Salifah Court, or the Arbitrator irom referring any matter in the progress of a suit which involves a point of Mahommedan law to a Kazi for decision, or from sending any party or witness, being a Mahommedan, to a Kazi for the administration of an oath.' 11. At no subsequent stage does the Sheikh appear to have shown any signs of going back on his delegation of responsibility in respect of foreigners other than the subjects of States in the Persian Gulf, to His Majesty's Government. Difficulties, however, arose in the post-war period in connection with his claim to exercise jurisdiction over Nejdis and p 5040/20 inhabitants of El Katr. In 1920 protests were received from Ibn Sand as to the exercise of jurisdiction by the Sheikh over IS^ejdi subjects. A siimlcii protest appears to have been made at about the same time by the Sheikh of Qatr, both parties requesting the Political Agent to exercise jurisdiction on p. 5668/27. Pol. their behalf. The Political Agent in consequence issued on 20th November G e of^ eS No t0 295 s 19-0 a notice that all foreign subjects, including Persians and subjects or • of'1° Sept. 1927, ' Arab Rulers and Chiefs other than those of Bahrein, were, while in Bahrein, para. 28. entitled to British protection. The decision was not well received by the Sheikh ; but it has not been contested by him, and since 1920 jurisdiction over all foreign subjects has rested w T ith the British Political authorities within the limits of the Orders in Council of 1913 and 1922, as subsequently amended.

The Principality of Bahrein consists of the archipelago formed by the islands of Bahrein, Muharraq, Umm Na'asan, Sitra, and Nabi Salih, and by a number of lesser islets and rocks. Taken altogether these form a compact group almost in the middle of the V-shaped gulf on the Arabian littoral Lor - II ' 234 ■ of the Persian Gulf which divides the independent Arab Trucial Sheikhdom of Qatar from the coast of Qatif in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 2. The term ' Bahrein ' former^ embraced the promon tory of Qatar and the oases of Qatif and Hasa on the Arabian mainland, as well as the islands of the archipelago, and, according to Lorimer, ' some authorities would attribute to it in the past an even more extended application, affirming Lor - II ' 233 ' that it once denoted the whole western side of the Persian Gulf from Ruus-al-Jibal to the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab.' II.—Bahrein prior to 1783. 3. The very conflicting evidence available goes to show Bombay that Bahrein was subject to Persian rule for a period in the Selections, early part of the Christian era, and between i.D. 615 and XXLV, 23. 723. It is stated to have been conquered by one Keshan bin ^ of ^ 18 Abdul Malik, and to have come under the sway of the 0/22.2! 1870 Oommiyyad Caliphs, in the latter year, and to have remained para. 2. under the control of the Caliphs until the close of the W]lso , 1 Abbaside dynasty in the 11th century, when it again became PersianGulf, subject to chiefs of its own race. Its mediaeval history is pp. 85-6. obscure, but a writer who visited the islands in A.D. 1051 refers to the fact that half of the pearls taken in Bahrein belong to the Chiefs of Hasa on the Arab mainland. Idrisi, Wilson, the Arab geographer, writing about a century later, states 88-90. 2953 200 7.34 Athat the island ' is governed by an independent chief. The inhabitants of the two shores are satisfied with his justice and piety, and when he dies he is replaced by a person of Wilson, 105. equal virtue and piety.' It was conquered about 1320 v the (Arab) rulers of Hormuz, a kingdom finally subdued by Wilson 116 the Portuguese in 1506, but which appears to have been Wilson, lib. trib to p ersia in at arly rate lts i at e r days Bahrein appears at the same date to have fallen under Portuguese control The Persians have adopted in a recent Note on tfie subiect a statement that it remained under Portuguese control from 1507 to 1622. It would appear, however, that there are at any rate some breaks in the continuity of Portuguese control. An agreement of 1515 between the Portuguese and the Persians, under which the King of Hormuz was to be ruler of Hormuz in the name of King Dom Manuel, his Lord Wilson 121 provided inter alia that Portuguese shipping should be Wilson, 121. i vailable t0 enable the Persians to invade Bahrein and Qatif. wi i9A In 1522 a revolt stimulated by the King of Hormuz broke Wilson, 124. a „ a i n8 t the Portuguese at Bahrein among other places, but was quelled, and in 1528 endeavours by the Portuguese to quell a subsequent rebellion in Bahrein against the King t t 8ai were beaten off. In 1559 it was temporarily occupied by Lior. i, o*i. Turks, who were, however, driven out by the Portuguese in the same year. In 1602 the Portuguese were forcibly w, ijn expelled from the islands by the Persians. The Persian wuson, iw. oc tionwas 0 f ll j 1 certain duration, and m their Note of 2nd August 1928 they refer to 1622 as the date on which Lor. 1, 836. Persia regained possession of Bahrein. They appear in any event to have had a military depot in Bahrein in 1622. (Jurzon states that ' the Portuguese . . . in 1625 concluded a treaty with Shah Abbas, by which they restored to him all his' coast possessions, retaining only the pearl banks at Bahrein. ...' 4. In or about 1718 the islands were occupied by the Arabs of Muscat, who, however, appear to have maintained, their occupation for a short time only. It is not clear whether at the date of this attack the islands were derelict or whether they were held by a Persian garrison. About 1753 the Ruler under the Persian Government of the town of Bushire made a descent upon Bahrein, the chief resident tribe in which (the Huwalali Arabs—at the present day still strongly represented in the islands) was seriously divided by internal feuds, and established his authority there. In this manner the islands again became, at least m Lor. T, 837. name) dependent on Persia. In 1782 the Arabs of Zubarah, on the Arabian mainland, efforts to reduce which had been made by the Governor of Bahrein under the Persians in the years immediately preceding that date, retaliated by a descent on the island of Bahrein. They defeated the Lor. T, 839- p ersian Q over nor, drove him to his fort, plundered and destroyed the town of Manama, and took possession of a Bushire vessel, with which they retired to Zubarah. A counter attack was repulsed, and in the following year the Uttabi Arabs of Zubarah, assisted by contingents from various tribes of Qatar, occupied the Bahrein islands, the Persian garrison of the Manama Fort capitulating on 28th July 1783, after a siege of about two months' duration, and being allowed to return to Bushire, Summary. 5. It will be seen that while the history of Bahrein prior to 1783 is very obscure, it would appear that Persia for not inconsiderable periods exercised control over the islands. The nature of that control is not, however, very clear; it seems probable that it was only very rarely of a definite character; and even in more recent periods Curzon, Persia, II, 419.lersian relations with the islands were for a substantial number of years interrupted by Portuguese occupation of or overlordship over them.

In 1800 Bahrein was occupied by the Imam of Muscat, the occupation lasting until 1801, when the Muscat forces were invested by the Uttabis and compelled to surrender and evacuate Bahrein. In 1802 the Imam of Muscat, having obtained some assistance from Bushire again landed in Bahrein and attacked the Uttabis.

In 1811 the islands were freed from Wahabi rule by the Imam of Muscat, when the Uttabis were restored to power, though according to a claim subsequently made by by the Imam, in subordination to Muscat. In 1816 the Uttabis sought the protection of the Wahabi rulers of Central Arabia, and the Imam of Muscat undertook an armed expedition against Bahrein, explaining to the British authori ties that he was compelled so to act by the repudiation by the Attabis of his suzerainty, which they had admitted in 1811, by their alliance with the Wahabis and by their piratical practices. The Muscat expedition, to which three Bushire vessels were added by the Persian Government, effected a landing in the summer of 1816, but was signally repulsed and withdrew. Unsuccessful negotiations took place later in the same year between Muscat and the Persian Bo. Sel. ; Government with a view to a fresh attempt on Bahrein. XXIV, 372.

Teli. Desp. 10. In April 1817 His Majesty's Minister in Persia No. 6 of reported the arrival at Tehran of an agent from the Imam 16.4.1817. o £ j\/i usca t ) the object of whose mission was credibly stated to be to inform the Shah that His Majesty s Government contemplated the capture of Bahrein, and to ask lor armed assistance for the Imam in order that he might thwart their design by taking possession of the island in the name oi tne Persian Government. His Majesty's^ representative stated that an agent of the Sheikh of Bahrein was also at Tehran, bearing a letter which stated that as the inhabitants oi the island were of the same sect as the natives of Persia, they had always looked up to the Persian monarch as their protector and head, and that they therefore hoped for the assistance of His Majesty to cloak them from the oppressions Teh p e s r . of the Wahabis. Approval for the grant of the military 6 5 1817 assistance desired was stated to have been given by the Shah to the Imam, but no action appears to have followed. 11. In 1818, on the appearance of the Egyptians in Has a, the Sheikh of Bahrein appears to have offered to assist them Lor. 1,846. w ith sea transport. In February 1819 the Sheikh entered into an agreement with the British Government, with the terms of which he subsequently failed to comply, for preventing the sale of captured British property in his dominions, and in the same year he expressed great indignation at the violation by the British authorities, under a misapprehension as to the nationality of certain vessels, of the neutrality of his port. Teh. Desp. 12. On the 19th April 1819 His Majesty's Representative Ko. 16 of at Tehran reported to the Government of India, that the 25.5.1819. I mam of Muscat had complained bitterly against the non- fulfilment of the engagements contracted with him by the Persian Government for the capture of Bahrein. The Minister added that letters received by him showed that the troops of Ibrahim Pasha, the Viceroy of Egypt, had occupied Bahrein (this appears to have been incorrect) and that the Imam had suggested to the Shah that he should send a messenger to the Pasha asking him to evacuate the island. The Imam is stated to have urged upon the Shah the necessity of endeavouring to recover a possession which according to him ' had for ages acknowedged the sovereignty of Persia.' He was, however, unsuccessful, and in June 1819^ His Majesty's Minister reported that the Shah had^ ' for the present ' dropped all intention of taking any steps in pursuit of his pretensions to the sovereignty of the island. It may be added here that the Government of Bombay in a despatch of 21st July 1819 to the Government of India, in which they discussed the desirability of assisting the Imam of Muscat,, in return for assistance in connection with the expedition proposed against the Gulf pirates, to establish his claims to Bahrein, referred to an 'arrangement some time since concerted ' between the Shah and the Imam, whereby the former 'had agreed to relinquish all claims to the island of Bahrein in favour of the Imam, under the condition of receiving a portion of its revenues.' B ahrein submits to M uscat, 1820, 13. The Persians, at the beginning of 1820, moved apparently by a desire to anticipate any attempt by Muscat to establish control over Bahrein with the support of His Majesty's Government, unsuccessfully requested the Imam to convey their troops to Bahrein. They addressed a similarapplication, equally unsuccessful, to the Commander of the Lor. I 847 British Expedition in the Persian Gulf. In the early part of 1820 the rulers of Bahrein made full submission to the Imam of Muscat and agreed to pay him a tribute of 30,000 dollars. An instalment (12,000 dollars) of this tribute appears subsequently to have been actually remitted. P olicy of B ritish G overnment, 1819-20. 14. The policy to be adopted by the British Government in regard to Bahrein was examined between the Government of Bombay and the Government of India in 1819-20, and was ultimately defined as one of complete neutrality. The Govt, of transfer of Bahrein to the Imam of Muscat had been contem- Bombay to plated, but this project, so far as the British Government were concerned, was now abandoned. The Government of pa ras 2 3 Bombay suggested that the Sheikh should be informed that so long as he restrained his subjects from piracy he would reap the advantage of a friendly neutrality on the part of Britain, whereas should a piratical spirit manifest itself forcible measures of coercion would be applied to him. They added that the conclusion of an engagement in general terms with the Sheikh ' would probably tend to convince the Uttabi Arabs of the integrity of our intentions.'

Simultaneously the Government of Bombay, in a despatch, to the Charge d'Affaires at Tehran, remarked that Dated we mean to avoid all interference in respect of the island 15.12.1819, of Bahrein. . . . There is, however, reason to believe that P ara - 11 • provided the Persian Government will consent to the Uttabis continuing in the undisturbed occupation of Bahrein the Sheikh would readily agree to pay them tribute, and for this purpose the mediation of the British Government would be gladly afforded provided it could be employed in such a manner as to avoid anything which might in any shape involve us in the transactions of the parties after the conclusion of the negotiation immediately referred to. . . .

On the 17th January 1820 the Sheikh agreed to surrender certain pirate craft which had taken refuge in his territories,- and undertook to the British Government not to admit any more boats of the same character until authorised to do so by the British authorities. On the 5th February 1820 a preliminary Treaty of Peace was signed between the Sheikh and His Majesty's Government, and on the 23rd February 1820 the Sheikhs were admitted to the benefits of the General Treaty of Peace which had AitcMson, been made between His Majesty's Government and the Arab Vol. XI, rulers of the Persian Gulf and under which His Majesty's No - Government undertook, in return for abstention by those Aitchison, rulers from piracy and the slave trade, that ' if any shall attack them the British Government shall take notice of it' 245-9!

The Shah had replied that' he wished that advices should be received from Shiraz before the mediation of the British Government to render Bahrein a tributary to Persia can be accepted.' Sir H. Willock remarked that 'the great repugnance of the Shah to the formation of any British settlement in the neighbourhood of Persia was strongiy manifested by His Majesty ? s not immediately accepting the British mediation to obtain a tribute from the island ot Bahrein, an object which he so urgently desired and which His Majesty was aware must at a future period be difficult of attainment from the already advanced stage of negotia tions between the Sheikhs of Bahrein and the Imam of Muscat.' and withdrawn (1820). 18. On the 3rd October 1820 the Government of Bombay instructed Sir H. Willock to take the earliest opportunity of informing the Persian Government that as our viewb are exclusively limited to the extirpation of piracy, it would be contrary to our policy, in the present state of the Gulf, to afford the mediation we formerly offered between His Majesty [the Shah] and the Uttabis of Bahrein. Summary, 1783-1820. 19. In 1799 the Sheikhdom, independent since 1783, professed allegiance to Persia and paid a year's tribute, but it was immediately afterwards conquered by the Imam of Muscat, and thereafter fell under the influence and ultimately the control of the Wahabi Amir. Liberated by Muscat m 1811, it appealed to the Wahabis in 1816 against the Imam and defeated him. In 1816 or 1817 a Persian envoy was received at Bahrein and presents exchanged. While no details are available as to what precisely took place on this occasion, the incident had no effective sequel. Persian authority was not asserted in the island between the date of the visit and 1820, and in the latter year the island became temporarily subject and tributary to Muscat. In 1820 Bahrein entered into its first formal treaty with the British Government, and that Government, on condition that the Sheikhs abstained from piracy, undertook to ' take notice ' ' if any shall attack them.'

In 1822 Captain Bruce, then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, acting on his own initiative and without any authority from or prior reference to Government, having proceeded of his own accord to Shiraz there signed an agreement with the Minister of the Prince Governor of Shiraz, on the part of Persia. This agreement alleged, inter 4 alia, in regard to Bahrein, that the islands had always been subordinate to the Governor of Fars, against whose authority the Uttabi Sheikhs had lately become rebellious; that the flag assigned to the Uttabis of Bahrein under the General Treaty of Peace with Britain in 1820 should accordingly, if already granted, be withdrawn, that no assistance should in future be rendered by Britain to the Uttabis of Bahrein, and that on the contrary the British Government should, if requested, assist the Persians against Bahrein with ' one or two' vessels of war. In other words, the title of Persia to the possession of Bahrein was explicitly admitted. The arguments which carried weight with Captain Bruce in concluding this unauthorised agreement appear to have been@ 7 that the reversion of Bahrein to Persian authority would tend ' more to the tranquillity of the Arabian side of the Oulf than almost any other act.' 21. The Resident's action was immediately disavowed and disapproved by the Government of Bombav, in letters from the Governor to the Prince Regent of Fars (which stated that it is not the intention of this Government to take any part in the claims of the several Powers and States of the Persian Galf further than may be necessary to prevent a renewal of piracy. . . . There can be nothing in the flag [granted to the Uttabis] to give offence to Persia, as there is not the smallest connection between it and the British flag, nor the smallest pretension to superiority on the part of the British Government'), the Imam of Muscat, and the Sheikh of Bahrein, and as a mark of dis approbation he was removed from his appointment. With regard to the clause of the agreement affecting Bahrein the Government of Bombay remarked : 44 It acknowledges the n King of Persia's title to Bahrein, of which there is not the Bombay to least proof, and which the British Government cannot assert Capt. Bruce, without injuring the pretensions of the Imam [of Muscat] and ^ 1491 of the Uttabis. ...' On the Persian side, the Shah not only refused to approve the arrangements which had been made, para ' but expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz Teh. Desp. should have entered into any engagement with the British No - ^ Government without his knowledge and injunctions. The 25 - 1 - 1823 - agreement was thus repudiated by both sides. 1822-29. B ahrein— M uscat D isputes. 22. By 1822, if not earlier, the Sheikhs of Bahrein had Lor. I, 851. ceased to observe the engagement undertaken by them in Govr. to 1820 to pay an annual tribute to Muscat. In August 1822, Imam, an attack by Muscat on Bahrein seeming in consequence l 9 - 8 - 1822 - imminent, the Governor of Bombay, in letters to the Sheikh shlikh 0 and to the Imani of Muscat, suggested that if this tribute 19.8.1822. was of ancient origin it should be regularly paid, but that Precis, 307. otherwise it should be dropped. In January 1823 the Lor. I, 850. Political Resident (Lieut. McLeod) visited Bahrein to Resdt. to reassure the Sheikhs in regard to the unratified treaty of concluded by Captain Bruce with the Prince Governor of Shiraz, and to inform them that that treaty was of no effect 27.2.1823. and that no change of policy was contemplated by Govern- Lor. I, 852. ment. In the spring of 1823, on rumours of a contemplated Govt, of joint attack on Bahrein by Persia, Muscat and the Arabs of Bombay to the mainland, the Minister at Tehran was asked at a suitable Teh., juncture to dissuade the Persians from disturbing the o^ot'o tranquillity of the Gulf. 26.3.1823. 23. In February 1824 the Resident composed for a period of two years the acute internal disputes between members of the ruling house which were for many years a feature of the. Lor.

In 1825 the Governor of Bombay personally remonstrated with the Imam of Muscat on an endeavour by the latter to interfere in the question of the Bahrein succession consequent on the death in that year of Sheikh Salman, who had ruled the Sheikhdom since 1796 (in Lor. I, iii, X, association in his later years with his brother Abdulla). Table 9. Reassertion of Persian Claim, 1825. 24. In 1825 an intimation was made by the Political Resident to the Prince Governor of Fars, who had been meditating an expedition to subdue Bahrein, and whose Minister had requested the Resident to give directions to the Sheikh to strike the flag which the British Government had authorised the Uttabis of Bahrein to fly. 'He was informed that no control was assumed over the people of8 Bombay Political letter dated 2.7.1825. Abstract. Lor. I, 854. Lor.I,855-( Bahrein and that the letter disapproving of Captain Bruce s treaty had manifested the line of conduct Government would pursue in regard to Bahrein.' The expedition was abandoned on a pretext, ' but the Sheikh averted the danger which threatened him by presents of considerable amount. 25. In October 1828 a last attack by the Imam of Muscat was severely defeated and driven off, ''afier sevcra undignified attempts to conclude a peace with the bfieikto of Bahrein, and on 2nd December 1829 peace was finally i. made between the Sheikhs and the Imam. The mam provisions of this agreement were that tribute should not m future be paid by Bahrein to Muscat, and that neither ruler should henceforth interfere m the affairs of the other. a supplementary verbal agreement the parties bound them selves to aid one another in the event of an attack by third party. Summary, 1820-30. 26. During the first two years of this period the islands acknowledged the supremacy of and, for a time, paid tribute to Muscat. From 1822 to 1829 they were intermittently at feud with Muscat. In 1829 a treaty was concluded by which Muscat withdrew its claims to supremacy and to tribute. The Persian claim was alluded to m 18-2 and Istv but not pressed. V.—1830-40. Bahrein and the Wahabis, 1830-35, 27. In the course of 1830-31 the Sheikhs, His Majesty's Government having refused to intervene in their favou r. and fearing a combination between the Amir and Muscat, formally submitted to the Wahabi Amir of the Arab mainland. They agreed to acknowledge the Amir s supremacy ana to pay a tribute to him. He on his part undertook to protect -7. Bahrein against external aggression. In 1833, however, the Sheikh felt strong enough to repudiate Wahabi supremacy, and he conducted a not unsuccessful offensive against the Wahabis between 1833 and 1835. Bahrein and th 28. Sheikh Khalifah -bin-Salman, who had been joint ruler with his uncle Sheikh x \bdulla since the death ot Sheikh Salman in 1825, died in 1834, and was succeeded as ioint ruler by his son Sheikh Mohammed bm Khahfah. Effective control continued to rest with Sheikh Abdullah. Internal dissension in the ruling family became more marked between 1834 and 1839, and the misgovernment of the island continued to grow with unfortunate ettects on its prosperity. His Majesty's Government, although m 1834 they had to take forcible measures against the bheikh to secure reparation for an insult to their Residency Agent in Bahrein, were, however, content to abstain from any interference in the internal affairs of Bahrein so long as the Sheikhs discharged the obligations undertaken by their Treaty of 1820. Restrictive Line applied to Bahrein, 1836. 29. In 1835 the British Government renewed the maritime truce which they had imposed in 1820 on the Arab rulers of the Gulf in the interest of the suppression of piracy. The Sheikh of Bahrein was not, however, included in the renewed truce, partly apparently because he had Lor. I, 860 behaved so well that this was thought unnecessary, partly Precis, 350. because he could be easily punished m the event of this proving desirable, and partly lest in the event of his inclusion he might claim British intervention if attacked by Muscat. In March 1836 the Sheikh agreed, however, to the Lor. 1,856 Lor.

Reassertion of Persian claim. Bahrein tributary to the Wahabis, 1836. 30. In the middle of 1836 the Sheikh, alarmed by a Bombay communication from the Governor of Shiraz calling on him Selections, as a Persian subject to tender his submission to the Shah XXIV » 385 - and by the possibility of the co-operation of the Imam of Lor • 15 858 * Muscat in a Persian attack on Bahrein, took steps for a reconciliation with the Wahabi Amir. As a result, he agreed to pay a nominal tribute of $2,000 to the Amir, the Amir on his side agreeing to supply troops for the defence of Bahrein against external attacks and to refrain from calling on the Sheikh for marine transport in the event of a Wahabi attack on Muscat by sea. 31. In 1837 the Sheikh, with the prior approval of Her Lor. I, 860. Majesty's Government, was allowed to punish certain pirates. In 1839 the Resident was invoked to settle internal disputes in the ruling family, but the parties would not agree to any settlement without a guarantee by Her Majesty's Government, which Her Majesty's Government were not prepared to give. E gyptian I nvasion of H asa : S heikh professes to be a P ersian S ubject, 1839. 32. In 1838-39 the Egyptians conquered Hasa and cap- Bombay tured the Wahabi Amir. They thereupon demanded the Selections, payment of tribute and certain territorial concessions from the Sheikh of Bahrein. The Egyptian Commander about the same time intimated to the British authorities his inten tion to attack and reduce the island. The Sheikh appealed for assistance to the Government of India, but in the absence of instructions from Her Majesty's Government the Govern ment of India were at first not prepared to give him any pledge and the Sheikh was instructed to decide for himself as to waiting on the Egyptian representative. Much alarmed by the proceedings of the Egyptians, 'and perhaps even more so by a rumour, apparently well founded, that the Saiyed of Oman was intriguing with the Egyptians to obtain and hold Bahrein as a fief under the Viceroy of Egypt,' the Sheikh thereon professed, in reply to demands made on him in the name of the Egyptians, to be a subject of the Persian Government. Apparently as the result of overtures by the Sheikh designed to substantiate this, the Prince Governor of Shiraz thereupon sent an envoy—one Lor. I, 862. Haji Qasim, formerly supercargo of a trading vessel—to reside in Bahrein as Persian agent, ' and to be the medium of receiving and transmitting the annual tribute which the Persian authorities vainly flattered themselves the Bahrein Chief was disposed to pay for their countenance and protection,and to bear a Robe of Honour and a letter to the Sheikh. The envoy was accompanied by a guard of 10 Persian infantry. No details appear to be available xxiV^SSS about his mission, which was apparently a failure. 33. On 1st April .1839 Admiral Sir F. Maitland, then Precis, 375, commanding the Gulf Squadron, was instructed by the G-ovt. of Government of Bombay to give the Sheikh all support against the Egyptians, short of actually entering on ^ate'd 4.1839 hostilities. If the Sheikh asked for a new engagement with Her Majesty's Government he should offer to transmit his proposals to India. The Resident was simultaneously to send a formal protest to the Egyptians. On the 18th April 2953 C10 Lor. I, 864. Lor. I, 865. Bombay Selections, XXIV, 389. Pol. Bes. to Govt, of Bombay, 47.1839. the Government of India empowered the Admiral, if the Sheikh claimed British intervention and offered to place his territories under British protection, ' to assure him ot the temporary protection of Her Majesty's squadron in the Gulf ' to inform the Egyptians that this pledge had been given and to urge them to abstain from futher military proceedings until the views of both Governments were known, failing which Bahrein would be defended against intervention by them until the pleasure of Her Majesty s Government had been communicated to the local authorities. In the same month the Sheikh promised the Assistant Political Resident to take no steps to place himself under the authority or protection of a foreign Power without farst consulting the Political Resident. S heikh submits to E gyptians ( J uly 1839). 34. In July 1839 the Sheikh ' suddenly and un expectedly' acknowledged the supremacy of the Egyptians and agreed to pay them a tribute of 2,000 dollars a year, on the understanding that his local authority would be observed and that no representative of the Egyptians would be sent to reside in Bahrein. The Resident protested m writing to both the Sheikh and the Egyptians, and expostulated with the Sheikh on the way in which he was sacrificing his independence. The Sheikh explained that his action was the result of the refusal of Her Majesty s Government to give him advice or a specific assurance of support, tor a trifling; financial payment lie liad now secured immunity from interference. He offered, however, m return tor a written and distinct pledge of protection, to repudiate his agreement with the Pasha and to avow himself a dependent of Her Majesty's Government; but on being pressed he refused to confirm this in writing and said that in any event it would be necessary for him to justify his change of attitude to the Egyptians on the ground that it was the result ot compulsion by Her Majesty's Government. 1839-40.

As a consequence of the activities of the Egyptians discussion appears about this time to have taken place as to the desirability of declaring a regular protectorate over p - • ooo Bahrein On 1st July 1839 the Secret Committee of the Precis, dyd. liid . a Company in f orme( i the Government of India that if necessary they would ' not disapprove of your entering into an engagement with the Chief of Bahrein to protect him against encroachments from Mehemet Ali, but we concur m the doubt expressed by Captain Hennell [then Political Resident] as to whether it would be expedient for that island to be taken under the protection of the British Government.' On 24th February 1840 the foreign Otiice wrote to the India Board (with reference to an enquiry from the Bombay Government) that it was important that the tt 4 i + Egyptian troops should not be allowed to take possession of 1874, p 5. Bahrein and that if the Company's troops could occupy it, even provisionally, such a measure could not fail to be attended with advantage. On the retirement of the Egyptians from Hasa in 1840 their relations with the Sheikh came to an end. Summary, 1830-40. 36. From 1831-33 Bahrein was subject and tributary to the Wahabi Amirs. She revolted from them in the latter year, but in 1836 again entered into an understanding, which11 appears to have lasted until ] 838, under which Bahrein paid a tribute and received guarantees of assistance against external .attack. In 1838 the Wahabi Amir was himself conquered by the Egyptians. The Persians reasserted their claim in 1836, the Bahreini answer^ being a renewal of their understanding with the Wahabi Amirs. Tn 1839, when faced by a demand for tribute from Egypt, Bahrein appealed to Persia, claimed to be a Persian subject, and received a Persian envoy. But immediately after she formally acknowledged Egyptian supremacy and paid tribute to Egypt. The visit of the Persian envoy had thus no effective sequel. VI.—1840-50. 37. In 1840 the Government of India, provoked by the attitude which the Sheikh had adopted, decided not to restrain the Imam of Muscat in the event of his wishing to conquer Bahrein. On 27th March 1840 the Secret Committee remarked to the Government of India 'We consider our- No. 591, selves . . . relieved from all regard to tlie interests of the ? ) 7, ?^ 0 ' QO Sheikh of Bahrein, and we should be glad to hear that his recis ' island was in possession of a friendly chieftain.' 38. Towards the end of 1840 the Imam of Muscat India Board informed the Resident that while his views in regard to Bahrein remained unaltered, he had been restrained from 22 - 10 - 1840 - giving effect to them by his impression that Her Majesty's Government were averse to the prosecution of his claim and that without their assistance or that of the Egyptians, he would have no chance of success.

Internal dissensions in the Sheikhdom between the ruler, Sheikh Abdullah, and his grand-nephew and co- ruler, Sheikh Mohamed, became increasingly bitter, and Sheikh Mohamed was finally expelled from the island. In November 1842 he was given permission by Her Majesty's Lor. I, 866. Government to attack Sheikh Abdullah. After a civil war which lasted from January to April 1843, Abdullah was expelled by Mohamed, who thereafter held the Sheikhdom, no reply being sent to an appeal to restrain the attackers w^hich was made by Abdullah to the British authorities in February 1843. I ntrigues of ex -S heikh , 1843-49. 40. Between 1843 and 1849 the ex-Sheikh appealed at various times for the assistance of the Wahabis, the Trucial Sheikhs, the Sheikh of Koweit, and the British and Persian authorities to enable him to recover his position. In 1843 Lor. I, 873. Her Majesty's Government dissuaded Muscat from trying to conquer Bahrein—considerations which weighed with them being inter alia the risk of provoking the Wahabis and the danger of giving Persia an excuse to espouse the cause of the ex-Sheikh. In the same year the ex-Sheikh twice visited Bushire, where he failed to find any consolation from the Resident, who, on his stating that if disappointed by Her Majesty's Government he was ready to throw himself into the arms of Persia, informed him (October 1843) that the adherence of Persia to his cause would not be recognised by Britain unless it was open and declared. 41. In the course of his visits the ex-Sheikh entered into discussions with the nephew of the Persian. Sheikh of Bushire, who, while holding no official position himself,12 promised him military assistance from Persia. On repre sentations being thereupon made to the Persian Prime Minister by Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, the P 1 'm® Minister ' informed me that Sheikh Suleiman had acted with great presumption in having interfered in political affairs without having any authority from the Government, and he said that he would reprimand him for his conduct. His m , Excellency added that Bahrein belonged to Persia and that 86 Oct she would take possession of it when more pressing affairs 1843. were disposed of. As I looked on this as mere idle boasting which was never likely to be fulfiUed, I thought it unnecessary to pursue the conversation. Lor. I, 875. 42. It may be recorded that on a second visit of the ex-Sheikh to Bushire from December lb43 to Mai ch 1844, he is stated to have been received with distinction by the Persians, and to have offered, if reinstated, to pay the cost, to remit in future a large annual tribute to the Shah, and to leave one son as a hostage in Persia. His proposals were not, however, accepted by the Persian Government. 43. In 1844 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed by the Government of India to resist by force anv attempt by Persia to establish troops on the island of F.O.toTeh., Bahrein.

Consequent on indications that Persia intended to intervene in the succession at Bahrein on behalf of the ex-Sheikh Abdullah the general question of policy was considered by Her Majesty's Government m the early part of 1844, in the light of an intimation by the Government of India that they would see the strongest objections to any such interference by Persia, which could not but react adversely on British interests. As a result, Her Majesty s Minister was informed (Foreign Office Despatch to Tehran,- No. 23, dated 1st May 1844) that a the question of the right of Persia to interfere and of the Indian Government to prevent interference necessarily depends upon the validity of the pretension put forward by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. Her Majesty's Government are ignorant of the grounds of such pretension, and, assuming those grounds to be insufficient, they would claim for the British Govern ment the right to prevent, if it accorded with its policy to do so, any direct interposition of Persia in the quarrels of rival claimants to the possession of Bahrein. The British Government in India at present consider that any such disturbance as may be occasioned by military operations- on the part of Persia directed against the island of Bahrein would be injurious to British interests, and, therefore,, unless Persia can show that she has a clear and indis putable right to the sovereignty of Bahrein; that she has exercised it without interruption under the dynasty of the Kajar family ; that consequently her piesent policy is directed to the maintenance of her lawful claims and not to the assertion of a pretension not founded on law, she must be13 prepared to encounter in any scheme of this kind the active opposition of the British Government in India.' In these circumstances the Minister was instructed to inform the Persian Government that ' Her Majesty's Government had heard with regret that that Government contemplated taking part in the disputes respecting the Government of Bahrein ; that such a proceeding would be viewed with much jealousy by the British Government in India; and that unless the right of Persia to interfere in the matter is beyond dispute, any interference on her part might lead to unpleasant discussions with England. For, although Pier Majesty's Government do not dispute the right of Persia as an independent power to adopt any line of policy not inconsistent with its engagements to foreign states which she might think advantageous to herself, they claim for themselves a corresponding right to judge and act in such matters as they may think fit.' Discussions with Persia, 1844-45. 45. On a communication in these terms being made to Teh. to F.O., the Persian Prime Minister, the Prime Minister said he No. 69 of would undertake to prove the right of Persia to possession 22 - 6 -l 8 44. of that island, and that in the meantime he would not make any movement against it without giving previous notification of such an intention to the British Government.' 46. In February 1845 the Minister at Tehran sent home ^ to a letter received from the Prime Minister, from which it JSTo. 19 of appeared that the Persian claim was essentially based on the 25.2.1845. Convention of 1822 between Captain Bruce and the Minister of the Prince Governor of Fars. (See paragraphs 20-21 above.) 47. In a subsequent despatch the Minister said that he Teh. to JF.O., had informed the Prime Minister that the Bruce Agreement was unauthorised and had been repudiated at the time, and ' ' that the Prime Minister had thereupon sent him a fuller statement of the grounds of the Persian claim. The result of enquiries which His Majesty's Minister had made con sequent on the receipt of this statement ' confirmed me in the opinion that this island has not formed part of the dominions of Persia since the accession of the Kajar dynasty [1795]. It is true that the Chiefs of Bahrein have in all probability from time to time given peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute to this country [Persia] as a mark of superiority, as Kandahar and Herat continue to do, without an acknow ledgment of subjection,'^' and it is also not unlikely that the rulers of that island may have declared themselves to be subjects of the Shah when threatened with subjugation from Bagdad, but I cannot ascertain that Persia has exercised any real control over it within the last 50 or 60 years.' The Minister added that in further support of their claim the Persian Government had sent him a gold coin struck at Bahrein in 1817 in the name of Fateh Ali Shah Kajar, which he believed to be genuine. 48. The fuller statement of claim put forward by the Secret fiom - Persian Government was investigated by the Secret Com- ^Controf^' mittee of the East India Company, who, after detailed 31.7.1845/ examinatioQ of it, reached the conclusion ' that Persia has no legitimate claim to the sovereignty of Bahrein.' It may be remarked that the Persian claim was largely based on a general claim that the Persian Gulf from the Shatt-el- Arab to Muscat and all the islands in it belonged to * On this point the Secret Committee of the East India Company remarked : ' Presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, and they have not been confined to Persia.' (Secret Committee to India Board, 31st July 1845.) 2953 D14 Persia; that tke employment in English, of the term ' Persian Gulf' was itself evidence of this; that from about 1300 A.D. the island of Bahrein had always been in the possession of the Governors of Fars and had paid revenue to them until its conquest in 1783 by the Uttabi Arabs, from which tribe 'itself, likewise, presents have generally been sent to the Governors of Fars' ; that Her Majesty's Government had recognised the position when they warned Mehemet Ali of Egypt in 1840 not to attack Bahrein, which did not form part of Arabia, but rather of the Persian Gulf ; ' and that accordingly the British Govern ment would not allow him to extend the hand of possession over that island ' ; that the British authorities had formally and repeatedly asked Persia to rent the island to them and that British representatives at Tehran had frequently declared that Her Majesty's Government had no right what ever to the Gulf or its islands [there is no foundation for either statement] ; and that the fact that Captain Bruce's treaty was on record supported the Persian claim. The following extract, which (except as regards the initial date) appears correctly to represent the true facts, may, however, be placed on record from the Prime Minister's memorandum : M In the commencement of the reign of His Majesty the late Shah, the Arabs of Beni Attabi came from the desert and conquered the island by sea. The object and desire of the Persian Government has since always been and is the recovery of that island from its spoilers.' 49. Her Majesty's Government, in view of the unlikeli hood that Persia had, or could give effect to, any serious designs in Bahrein and the undesirability of engaging in those circumstances in a correspondence which might merely cause irritation without serving any useful purpose, instructed the Minister at Tehran not to revert to the subject unless it was forced upon him by the Persian Prime Minister. In that case he was to employ certain arguments supplied to him (apparently the critical comments of the Secret Committee of the East India Company on the Prime Minister's memorandum) to show generally the grounds on F.O. to Teh. -wlxich Her Majesty's Government were ' unable to recognise as valid the claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein, and you may add that they would . . . very much disapprove of any attempts on the part of Persia to interfere in the affairs of that island and thus disturb the peace of the Gulf and to afford an opening to piracy.' The question appears to have dropped for the time being. Treaty of Peace with Wahabis, to whom Bahrein pays Tribute (1847). 50. Meanwhile, the ex-Sheikh (who in 1845 had unsuccess- Lor. 1,877. fully attempted to capture Bahrein with the aid of the Wahabis) had been invited in June 1846 by the Governor- Lor. I, 877. General of Fars to return to Bushire, where he should be liberally entertained ' until . . . the season for action had Lor. I, 880. arrived,' but he declined the invitation. In October 1846 the Wahabi Amir asked the permission of the Resident to call in the Trucial Sheikhs of the Arab littoral against Bahrein. This was refused. A request by the ruling Sheikh of Bahrein to be allowed to call in the assistance of the Sheikh of Debai against the Wahabis w T as equally refused in November 1846. In August 1847 a Treaty of Peace was concluded between the Wahabi Amir and the ruling Sheikh, under which the ruling Sheikh agreed to pay a tribute of 4,000 dollars a year, while the Wahabi Amir agreed not to encourage the ex-Sheikh. Slavery Treaty with Great Britain, 1847. 51. On the 8th March 1847 Her Majesty's Government entered into a Slavery Treaty with the ruling Sheikh. No. 38 of 7.8 1845.15 Turkish Designs on Bahrein, 1847. 52. In the same year the first Turkish claim to suzerainty Lor. I 881. over Bahrein was put forward, the Turkish Mutasallim of Basra writing to the Sheikh inviting him to declare his allegiance to ^ the Sultan and to submit lists of his shipping F.O. to for registration. These overtures were evaded by the -'- llc ^ a -^ ( ^* Sheikh, while the Porte assured Her Majesty's Government 28 * 9 - 1847 ' that they did not intend to use compulsion against him; but that if the Governor of Bussorah had attempted by negotiation to induce any of the Maritime Chiefs of the Persian Gulf to return to their allegiance to the Porte, they could not disapprove his doing so.' Persian Intrigues, 1848. 53. In the following year correspondence took place BusMre to between the Persian^ Consul-General at Bagdad, the ex- Tehran, Sheikh (whom he advised to press ahead, since Persia would No - 177 of surely assist him) and the ruling Sheikh, whom he addressed 5 ' 6 - 1848 * in friendly terms.

The overtures made by the Turks in 1847 gave rise between 1847 and 1849 to consideration by the Government of Bombay, the Government of India, and Her Majesty's Government of the policy to be adopted in regard to Bahrein. The Sheikh hinted in 1847 that unless certain grievances j ggj were met he might become a Turkish subject. His B ° r ' to ' grievances were accordingly remedied by the Government ties. 384 of of Bombay. That Government represented, however, that it 31.7.1847. was desirable to exclude interference in Gulf affairs by foreign Powers, since unless Her Majesty's Government retained the supreme control they could not secure the permanence of the objects (the suppression of piracy, &amp;c.) on which so much money had been spent. The Court of Directors concurred in the Government of Bombay's recommendation 44 that any attempts upon Bahrein ought to be resisted by the British Naval Force' and that the Resident should be so informed. 55. On 11th October 1847 the Foreign Office, in a letter to the India Board, in which they referred to recent Turkish assurances that the Turkish Government had no intention of using compulsion with regard to Bahrein, added that ' if the Indian Government has any further apprehensions on the subject, and if the Bahrein Chief is really an independent ruler, the best course would be to make with him a treaty of alliance which would secure his independence and his friendly connection with England.' The Resident, w T ho deemed it inexpedient that Her Majesty's Government should involve itself in the embarrassments likely to arise from a closer alliance with Bahrein (letter of 25th January 1848), was, however, opposed to making the existing connection closer, as were the Secret Committee of the East India Company, who expressed the view that the Resident ' had exercised a wise discretion in not taking any step for the negotiation of a new treaty with Bahrein.' The Resident w T as, at the same time, authorised, while avoiding discussion with the Turks, to ascertain whether the Sheikh was inclined to enter into a closer connection with Her Majesty's Government. S heikh's R equest to be taken under B ritish P rotection refused (1849). 56. In January 1849, however, the Sheikh spontaneously Lor - asked to be taken under British protection. The Resident, who, as stated above, had originally opposed, ultimately xxiv, 429. supported this request, but after a lengthy discussion the India Bd.

Persian Protest 1848. 57 During the course of these discussions, the Persian Government protested against British interference in the affairs of Bahrein, whereupon they were informed by the Minister at Tehran in February 1848 that the British Government were unable to recognise as valid the claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. Designs of Mu 1849. 58. In June 1849 the Imam of Muscat, haying intimated his desire to send an expedition to take possession of Bahrein, and having asked the opinion of Her Majesty's Government, was strongly dissuaded from doing so by Her Majesty s Government. Summary, 1840-50. 59. The ruling Sheikh was expelled in 1843 and con tinued to intrigue to regain the throne till his death in 18^9, appealing for assistance during this period to the Wahabis, Persia Muscat and Great Britain, in all cases unsuccessfully. In'1847 Turkey asserted a claim to Bahrein. In the same year the islands submitted themselves to the Wahabi Amir and agreed to pay tribute to him. Claims by Persia were advanced, but rejected, in 1844- 45 and 1848. _ . . Muscat was dissuaded from attacking Bahrein in 1849. Her Majesty's Government, on consideration of the policy to be adopted in regard to Bahrein, decided against establishing a protectorate and refused a request put for ward in 1849 by the Sheikh to be taken under British protection. They assured him at the same time of their general goodwill, and their deliberations made it clear that they regarded the island as independent, hut were reluctant to assume further responsibility in relation to it so long as its independence and the performance of the engagements undertaken by the Sheikh could be secured without their doing so. VII.—1850-61. D isputes with W ahabis, 1850-51. 60. In 1850 the Resident found it necessary to take disciplinary action against the ruling Sheikh—an individual of a irresponsible character.' Consequent on strained relations between the Sheikh and the Wahabi Amir, the Amir, with whom the sons of the ex-Sheikh Abdulla were associated, in 1850-51 threatened Bahrein, whereupon the Sheikh ' against his own better judgment . . . tendered a small annual tribute to the Amir,' a circumstance from which it may perhaps be inferred that he had failed to observe the agreement of 1847 referred to in paragraph 50 above. The Amir rejected the offer and made exorbitant demands instead. The Sheikh was about to succumb to a combination of the sons of the ex-Sheikh and the Wahabi Amir ' when a British squadron arriving off Bahrein took the islands under their protection.' Peace was subsequently made with the Wahabis in July 185L H er JVE ajesty's G overnment and the C laims of T urkey (1851). 61. In the same year Her Majesty's Government decided that the Turkish Government should be informed at Con stantinople that Her Majesty's Government, having heard that the Sheikh was desirous of placing himself under Turkish protection, could not acknowledge or acquiesce in any such arrangement, seeing that the Government of British India had had relations with Bahrein as an independent17 State and had concluded with it certain treaties, namely, one India Bd. m 1820 for the suppression of piracy and one in 1847 for to mo tile prohibition of the exportation of slaves, and that Her 7 r' 21 fh. Majesty s Government must object to any arrangement which to Sir' would transfer Bahrein to the dominion or protectorship of S. Canning, any other Power. ^ Constanti- 62. In the correspondence leading up to this decision Lord Palmerston remarked : &lt;c I come to the conclusion that it is the opinion of the East India Company that the object first to be aimed at is to prevent Bahrein from falling under the control of any foreign Power, and to keep that island in its present condition of political independence. But I infer from what has been stated in the despatches which you have communicated to me, that if that independence could no longer be maintained, and if the ruler and the people of Bahrein were determined to place themselves under some foreign protection, the East India Company would think that less evil would arise from affording to Bahrein British protection than from allowing French, Persian or Turkish authority to be established in that island.' Attitude of the Wahabis and of Muscat, 1852-53. 63. In 1852 the Sheikn proposed to withhold his tribute Lor I 885 from the Wahabi Amir, but on the advice of the Resident decided to pay it. In the same year the Consul at Zanzibar was instructed to inform the Imam of Muscat that Her Majesty's Government saw no reason to alter the views regarding the possession of Bahrein communicated to His Highness in 1849 (paragraph 58 above). In May 1853 the Government of India authorised the Government of Bombay to offer every obstacle to an attack on Bahrein by the Wahabi Lor. 1,887. Amir (who was now nominally subject to the Turkish Government) on the ground that Her Majesty's Government would not permit the occupation of Bahrein by the Turkish Government or by anyone acting for them or in their interest. P rinciple of N on-interferekce in I nternal A ffairs laid down by B ombay G overnment (1854). 64. On 20th November 1854 the Government of Bombay in a letter to the Pesident laid down the principle of non interference in the internal affairs of Bahrein, and authorised the Resident simultaneously to inform the Sheikh of Qatif on the Arab mainland that the British Government would not tolerate his further interference with the affairs of Bahrein. S lavery A greement with H er M ajesty's G overnment (1856), 65. On the 10th May 1856 an agreement supplementary Aitchison, to the Treaty of 1847 (paragraph 51 above) regarding the Vol. XI, slave trade was made with the Sheikh. Its contents were identical with that of corresponding engagements entered into at the same time by the Arab rulers of the Trucial Coast. 66. The Sheikh's internal government continued to go from bad to worse. In September 1858 reparation was secured from him for the ill-treatment of British subjects in Bahrein. In 1859 a Wahabi attack was averted by British intervention. Ihe local Wahabi Governor sued for pardon Lor. 1,887. to the Senior Naval Officer ; the Wahabi ruler, however, made a formal protest, asserted his authority over Bahrein, and declared that he was himself a vassal of the Sultan of Turkey. The Resident, in reply, informed him of the determination of Her Majesty's Government to preserve the independence of Bahrein, and pointed out the inconsistency of his piratical attacks on Turkish shipping with his professions of dependence on the Ottoman Government. S heikh's A ppeal to P ersia and T urkey, 1859-61. 67. At the end of 1859 or early in 1860, as the result, Lor. I, 888. apparently, partly of apprehensions of the Wahabis and partly of irritation at the restraint exercised by the Resident 2953 E18 over his piratical activities directed against tire Wahabis, the Sheikh made a simultaneous appeal for assistance to the Persian Governor of Fars and the Turkish Wali of Baghdad. The Turkish answer was delayed. A Persian agent (Mirza Mehdi Khan), bearing a Persian Firman to the Sheikh, arrived in April 1860. The Persian flag was hoisted, Persian sovereignty proclaimed, and the Sheikh's agreement to pay tribute secured. These ceremonies were, however, scarcely over when a Turkish emissary arrived. The Persian flag continued to fly during the Sheikh's negotiations with the Turks, but on the latter withdrawing, and subsequently communicating assurances of a character satisfactory to the Sheikh from the Turkish Government, the Turkish flag was hoisted on the forts in place of the Persian flag in May 1860 and the Sheikh agreed to pay tribute to Turkey. The Persian emissary, however, refused to leave Bahrein ' or surrender his imaginary authority in the Sheikhdom.' The Resident reported in July 1860 that ' the Ottoman flag has now become the national one.' The Sheikh appears to have endeavoured to play off each party against the other. Views of the Minister- at Tehran and the Government of Bo7nbay. 68. The Minister at Tehran regarded the matter as one of relatively small importance. Be pointed out to the Persian Government ' that under no circumstances can the British Government be expected to concur in the proposed transfer of the sovereignty of Bahrein to the Persian Crown, since we have contracted engagements with the Arab Sheikhs of the island as independent Chiefs, and since the mainten ance of their independence is indispensable to the successful working of those plans of maritime police in the Persian Gulf which we have been at so much pains and expense to establish'; and obtained an assurance from Persia that no Teh. to Bu. military occupation of Bahrein should be attempted until No. 16 of t h e title to the island had been settled through the diplomatic 4.5.1860. channel. He advised the Resident that, while hostilities against Bahrein were to be repelled by force, a voluntary tender of allegiance by the Sheikh to any other Power might, so long as it was unaccompanied by any military occupation, be ignored as of no particular importance. In the light of the Minister's views the Government of Bombay instructed the Resident that he should not interfere with the occupation of Bahrein, whether by Persia or Turkey, save by protest and by an intimation that the matter had been referred to Her Majesty's Government; but at the same time that the agents of both Powers (Turkey and Persia) should be warned that aggression by or in the name of Bahrein on neighbour ing tribes would not be allowed and would, if necessary, be Dec. 1860. prevented by force. In representing the matter to the Secretary of State for India they urged that in the interests of the peace of the Gulf it would be better that Bahrein should be regarded as independent and as subject neither to Turkey nor to Persia, that its independence should be recognised, and the engagements into which in the interests of humanity we had entered with its rulers for the preservation of the peace and good order of the Gulf should be maintained. H er M ajesty's G overnment decide that B ahrein shall be regarded as independent (1861). I.O. to F.O., 69. In February 1861 Her Majesty's Government, after II.2.61. ' discussion between the India Ofhce and the Foreign Office, F.O. to I.O., approved the recommendation of the Government of S^ofs'to G Bombay. The Resident and the Minister at Tehran were so of L, No. 2, informed. During part of the time at any rate that the 18.2.'61. question was under consideration in London the Turkish and Persian agents or their representatives appear (though it is not clear how consistently) to have remained in Bahrein, and the flags of both Powers to have been flown Kesdt. fco Bombay, No. 118, 14.4.1860 ; No. 2 a, 7.5.1860; No. 219, 26.7.1860.

What did he care for Turk or Persian? He valued the friendship of the British Government highly.'' British Convention of 31st May 1861 with the Sheikh. 70. In May 1861 the Sheikh, refusing to discontinue a blockade which he had imposed on the Wahabi coast, was informed by the Resident of the decision of Her p 0 i. R es . Majesty's Government that he was regarded as an indepen- to'Sheikh, dent Chief and that in these circumstances he must be held ^5.5.1861. responsible by them for any piratical activities in which he might indulge. The Sheikh proved obdurate; he was threatened with forcible measures by the Resident and two of his ships were seized. He accordingly submitted, and on 31st May 1861 he signed a Friendly Convention with the Resident, acting on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, by which he entered into a ' perpetual treaty of peace and friendship ' with Great Britain, and in which, as &lt;s indepen dent ruler of Bahrein,' he acknowledged as valid and in force the earlier conventions entered into between Bahrein and Her Majesty's Government, and undertook in return for a guarantee of protection against aggressions 'by the Chiefs and - Tribes of the Gulf' to abstain from maritime aggression, piracy, the slave trade, &amp;c., and to agree to Aitchison, certain conditions in regard to residence and trade in Vol. XI, Bahrein by British subjects and to jurisdiction over them. ^o. x, 234. One of the ships seized from him was thereupon returned; the second, the Hamrah, was retained. 71. The Turkish and Persian agents would seem to have p 0 i. Res. to disappeared from Bahrein before the Resident's arrival. The Teh., ^No. 20, Persian authorities at Bushire in June 1861 asked the 8.6.1861. Resident for an explanation of his proceedings. The Resident, however, contented himself with forwarding their enquiry to Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran. The Convention was approved by the Government of India in 1861, and the Turkish and Persian Governments were informed of what had happened. Summary, 1850-61. 72. The Turkish Government were informed in 1851 that Her Majesty's Government could not recognise any claim on their part to Bahrein, The Sheikhs appear to have continued to pay tribute to the Wahabi Amir in the early part of and possibly through out this period. In 1859 the Sheikh appealed simultaneously to Turkey and to Persia, as the result of apprehensions of a Wahabi attack, and received a Persian envoy, who hoisted the Persian flag. On the arrival immediately afterwards of the Turkish envoy the Persian flag was hauled down. Sub sequently the Sheikh for a time flew both flags side by side. The envoys seem to have left Bahrein in the early part of 1861. No action was taken by the British authorities pending a decision by Her Majesty's Government as to whether they regarded Bahrein as independent. The Persian Government undertook not to endeavour to occupy the islands until the title to them was settled. Her Majesty's Government decided in February 1861 to regard the Sheikh as an independent ruler and so hold him responsible for piracies, &amp;c. Punitive action against him by Her Majesty's Government having proved necessary in May 1861, he entered in that month into a convention with them in which he was described as ' independent ruler of Bahrein,' and secured certain guarantees of protection.Vm. 1861-67. From the Convention of 1861 to the Punitive Expedition of August 1868. Persian Protest (1862). Lord Cowley 73. lu January 1862 the Persian Minister in Paris to F.O., protested to Her Majesty's Ambassador in Paris against the No, 15, seizure of the Ilamrah. He was informed in reply that Her 7.7 1862 Majesty's Government could not recognise any claim on the Cowley P art of Persia to question their proceedings in regard to No. 209, Bahrein, and must therefore decline to offer him any 22.2.1862. explanation on the subject of his complaint. Persian Protest (1866). Lor I 891. 74. Between 1863 and 1865 the Sheikh continued to misbehave, and in the latter year his ship, the Dinar, was seized under the instructions of the Resident. The Persian Government in 1866 made a complaint in regard to the Dinar proceedings on the ground that Bahrein under the unratified agreement of 1822 was a dependency of Persia. The Government of India, after ascertaining from the Government of Bombay the nature of the agreement of 1822, Lor. 1,691. communicated the result of their enquiries to the Minister at Tehran, and added their own opinion that ' whatever might have been the pretensions of Persia or the grounds of the same to the sovereignty of Bahrein in former days, the Shah could not now be regarded as possessing in point of LO. to fact any rights in the principality.'

In 1866-67 the Resident, on the instructions of the Government of India, investigated the relations of the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Wahabi Amir. He reported as a result that the Sheikh claimed to be independent so far as his islands were concerned, and that the annual tribute of 4,000 dollars ' which he indubitably paid ' (cp. paragraph 50 above) to the Amir was on account of the possessions held by him in Qatar on the Arabian mainland, the object of the Lor I, 892. payment being to secure those possessions against attacks by Arab tribes under Wahabi influence. The Government of India, in the light of the Resident's investigation, expressed the view in March 1867 that the Sheikh was independent of all other Powers in respect of his insular possessions and owed fealty to the Wahabis only in regard to Qatar. Summary, 1861-67. 76. This period is marked by assertions of the Persian claim in 1862 and 1866. Her Majesty's Government on both occasions made it clear that they could not regard that claim as well founded. Investigation showed that the tribute still paid (1867) by the Sheikh to the Wahabi Amir was in respect of Bahreini possessions on the mainland of Arabia, and not in respect of Bahrein, which the Sheikh held independently of all other Powers. IX.—Discussions and Incidents, 1868-70. 77. Questions of considerable importance as bearing on the status of Bahrein arose in 1868-70 consequent on— (a) the disciplinary action taken by the Government of India against the ruling Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, in view of his breaches of the Maritime Truce of 1820, which resulted in his flight from Bahrein in September 1868 and the succession as sole Sheikh of his brother, Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa; (h) the punitive action taken at Bahrein by the Govern ment of India in November—December 1869, consequent on the invasion of Bahrein by the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, the murder of Sheikh21 Ali^and the attempt of Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa and Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah to establish themselves in control of the islands. 78. In view of the weight attached by the Persians to the^ declarations made in the course of those discussions as indicating the view held by Her Majesty's Government on the status of Bahrein, of the Persian allegations that over tures to Persia had been made by the ruling Sheikh, AH bin Khalifa, and by the ex-Sheikh, Md. bin Khalifa, and of the misleading but categorical accusations made against the Resident by the Persian Government, it seems desirable to examine in some detail the correspondence which passed and the sequence of events. Punitive Expedition of August—September 1868. 79. In 1868,^ consequent on an attack on Qatar by the Sheikh of Bahrein, the Government of India resolved to take disciplinary action against Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifa. The Sheikh sent an agent to Bush ire to satisfy the Resident, but the agent having no powers from his master, his mission proved fruitless, and he returned to Bahrein in August 1868. An armed expedition was thereupon sent against the Sheikh in August-September of that year. Before it reached Bushire Bahrein the Sheikh fled to the Arab mainland, and he was Desp. 3 of thereafter regarded by the people of Bahrein and by Her 25 - 9 '' 1868 - Majesty's Government as having abdicated the Sheikhdom. The expedition found it unnecessary to use any force, a full submission being made on its arrival by Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa, brother of Sheikh Mohamed, who had previously been associated with Sheikh Mohamed to some extent in the Sheikhship. An agreement was reached by the Political Resident with Sheikh Ali, which disposed of the matters in dispute, on 6th September 1868. The agreement was signed by ' Ali bin Khalifah and the inhabitants and subjects of Bahrein.' It declared inter alia that ' Md. bin Khalifah having repeatedly committed acts of piracy and other irregularities at sea, and having now, after his recent Aitch. XI, piratical acts, fled from Bahrein, has forfeited ali claim to No - xi ' his title as principal Sheikh and Chief of Bahrein.' 236-7. 80. Subsequently to the conclusion of this agreement the Resident, by way of punishment, destroyed the fort of Muharraq by gunfire and burnt certain vessels of war belonging to Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifah. His despatch, Pol. Res. to which contains a detailed report on the course of events, Govt * of makes no reference to any flying of the Persian flag by ® om 3 aj ' Mohamed bin Khalifah, and the bombardment of Muharraq 25 0 9.1868 and the punitive destruction of the warships took place after the submission of Bahrein, and so after Mohamed bin Khalifah had fled from the islands. Persian Protest, November 1868. 81. The facts appear to be as stated in the preceding paragraph. It was some time before a full account of these proceedings reached either India or London. Meanwhile, as will be seen from the correspondence, extracts of which Teh. Desp. are quoted below, the action of the Government of India oQ?o°ofio' drew a vigorous protest from the Persian Government. The ' U ' ibbb - protest, after appealing to the treaties concluded between Teh. Desp. England and Persia in 1809, in 1814, in 1822 (unratified) and in 1857, urged that the Resident, instead of respecting 17 • 11 • :,868 • the rights of Persia in the Gulf to the extent provided for in those treaties, had, without any prior intimation to the Persian authorities, attacked Bahrein, which island had been and still was the property of Persia ; had bombarded and destroyed the Governor's fort and house and caused considerable damage ; had appointed the Sheikh's brother 2953 F22 as Governor over the island on the flight, through fear, of the Sheikh ; had imposed a fine ; and had required the new Sheikh to find his brother and deliver him up to the British authorities. These proceedings had taken place at a time when ' Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah, the Governor of Bahrein, was openly avowing his submission to and dependence upon Persia and declaring that he considered Bahrein to be indisputably Persian, in proof of which the Persian flag was flying over his fort.' FO to 1.0. 82. Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran was instructed 1218^9 to communicate a suitable explanatory statement to the Persian Government. The Foreign Office suggested, how ever, that it might be advisable, in the event of similar proceedings again becoming necessary, that communication should be had with that Government. While this question was still under consideration a formal protest against the Resident's action was received (]lth February 1869) from the Persian Charge d'Affaires in London, who complained, inter alia, that the Resident had sunk three ships belonging From Gen. to the Governor of Bahrein and fired on his palace on which iviolisin Persian flag flew, and requested that the British Govern- Khan, men1 . wou i t | gi ve orders for the repair of the damage caused. To Gen He was informed in reply that 'the Sheikh of Bahrein was Mohsin an independent chief with whom the British Government Khan, }| a (] treaty engagements and whom they^must hold strictly 5.3.1869. t0 t]le p el .f orman c e of those engagements.' Gen. Mohsin 83. This contention the Persian representative disputed, Khan to and in support of his view he forwarded letteis addressed Dake of „ from t0 1 g0g by Sheikh of Bahrein to His Imperial 13.41869. Majesty the Shah and the Prince Governor of Shiraz.' The translations of these letters are dated 9th Apiil and 12th April 1869 respectively. From internal evidence it seems probable that they were, however, written in 1860 on the occasion of the visit to Bahrein of the Persian envoy, Mirza Mehdi Khan (paragraph 67 above). They acknowledge the receipt of a Firman from the Mirza (apparently recognising Sheikh Md. as Sheikh and accompanying a Firman and a Sword of Honour for Sheikh Ali). They state emphatically that Bahrein forms part of Persia, and has always done so. They refer to an agreement reached for the future payment of tribute; remark that 'the slight neglect which was latelv shown on our part towards Your Imperial Majesty s Government was because they had not for a while superin tended and protected us, but as now the Government of Your Imperial Majesty has intended by sending over Mirza Mehdy to enquire into and manage the affairs here, I, with mj' brother and all the inhabitants, feel quite ready to declare at once that we are most willing to render any services required from us towards Your Majesty's Government, being already aware that Bahrein (Persian Gulf) is part of Persia,' and add ' . . . I will hasten to hoist the flag on my residence bearing the Lion and the Sun which are the signs of the Persian Standard.' British Note of 29th April 1869. 84. The question of the reply to be given to this further protest was carefully considered between the India Office and the Foreign Office. The Duke of Argyll, then Secretary 1.0. to F.O., 0 £ g tate f or India, remarked that although he was of opinion 21.4.1869. t ^ at line of policy which had hitherto been pursued of regarding the Sheikh of Bahrein as an independent sovereign, and of refusing to recognise the right of sovereignty advanced by Persia, as had been done in 1845, 1848 and 1860, could not now be abandoned without very serious risk of endangering the peace of the Gulf, yet that ' he was not blind to the expediency of avoiding all causes of unnecessary irritation at the Court of Tehran and that23 he was willing, therefore, should Lord Clarendon desire it, as a matter of courtesy to the Persian Government, to issue instructions to the Government of India to direct the Resident in the Persian Gulf (whenever he might on any future occasion, under orders from India, be about to call the Chief of Bahrein to account for any breach of his engage ments with the British Government) to notify the fact to the British Minister at Tehran for the information of the Shah's Government. ' Circumstances might, however, arise in which the Resident might, in the general interests of peace and order, be called upon to act promptly on his own responsibility, and in such cases the Secretary of State was not willing to waive what he considered as not only a right To Gen pertaining to, but a duty incumbent upon, the British Mohsin Government.' The Foreign Office concurred in these views Khan, and the Persian representative was informed accordingly. 29.4.1869. 85. The Persian representative on receipt of the Foreign F.O. to I.O., Office letter asked that in order to make it more palatable 11.5.1869. to the Shah, certain modifications should be .made in it. After private discussion between Lord Clarendon and the 5 g f 8 09 ' Duke of Argyll, of which no record exists, and an interview between the Envoy and Lord Clarendon, it was finally agreed to accept the modification embodied in the opening para graph of the letter which follows, but also to make the addition contained in the last paragraph of that letter ; and a letter so amended was despatched to him. The text (omitting an introductory paragraph) of the amended letter, which is of importance as one of the principal pieces of evidence subsequently adduced by the Persian Government in support of their claim that Her Majesty's Government have recognised Persian sovereignty over Bahrein, is as follows. The sentences in italics are those which were added in deference to the further representations from General Mohsin Khan referred to above :— ' The British Government readily admit that the Government of the Shah has protested against the Persian right of sovereignty over Bahrein being ignored by the British Authorities, and they have given due consideration to that protest. But it is the fact, as yourself and the Government of the Shah are un doubtedly aware, that the Sheikhs of Bahrein have at different periods entered directly into engagements with the British Government; and I beg to assure you that the British Government hold the Sheikh to these engagements solely for the purposes of preventing Piracy and Slave Trade, and of maintaining the police of the Gulf. If the Persian Government are prepared to keep a sufficient force in the Gulf for these purposes, this country would be relieved of a troublesome and costly duty; but, if the Shah is not prepared to undertake these duties. Her Majesty's Government cannot suppose His Majesty would wish that in those waters disorder and crimes should be encouraged by impunity. ' I need scarcely assure you of the friendly feelings entertained by Her Majesty's Government towards Persia, and their desire on all occasions to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Shah ; and, in regard to this question, I have the honour to state to you that, whenever it is practicable to do so. Her Majesty's Government will cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand of any measures of coercion against himself which the conduct of the Sheikh of Bahrein may have rendered necessary. 'But the British Government cannot consent to debar its officers, to uhom the superintendence of the police of24 the Persian Gulf is entrusted, from the exercise of the right of punishing hy prompt measures any violation of Treaty engagements by the Sheihh of Bahrein, when^ a reference to the Court of Tehran would he attended with embarrassing delays which might endanger the general peace of the Gulf '; hut whenever such a necessity shall arise a full communication respecting it shall he made to the Persian Government' Overthrow and Death of Sheikh Ali {August September 1869). Pol Res. to 86. In August—September 1869 Bahrein was invaded Govt, of by the ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifah, who was joined Bombay, one Mohammed bin Abdullah, son of the Sheikh who had uVl869 been deposed in 1843 (paragraph 39 above). The ruling 181 of ' Sheikh Ali was defeated and killed, while Sheikh Mohammed 25.9.1869, bin Abdullah assumed the leadership of the usurping party. 184 of ^ 37^ Her Majesty's Minister reported on Mth November 5.10.1869. a conversation on this incident with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs in the course of which the latter admitted that Persia had not acquired sufficient power or authority in that part of the Grulf to enable her to repress acts of piracy and to maintain order, but Teh. Desp. a( jded that he hoped that before long the Shah's authority 14111869. would 136 Ml y established at Bahrein, when full redress would be given for losses suffered through the recent events, and that in the meanwhile it would not be considered necessary that the British authorities should undertake coercive measures. Her Majesty's Minister further reported that Ali bin Khalifa having forwarded letters to this Court admitting his allegiance to the Shah and offering his services to the Persian Government,' an agent (Mirza Mehdi Khan, wh.0 had been Persian Envoy to Bahrein in 1859 (para graph 67 above)) had been despatched with a Royal Firman, recognising Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah as Chief of Bahrein, but that on receipt of the news of the murder of the Sheikh by the ex-Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifah, the Firman had been recalled and the name of the ex-Sheikh substituted (from paragraphs 94-5 below it will be seen that these statements subsequently proved to be incorrect in material particulars). British Punitive Expedition (November—December 1869). 88. Punitive operations consequent on the murder of Sheikh Ali were undertaken by the British Government in November of the same year. Previous notification was given to the Persian Government of the grounds of this expedition, the object of which was stated to be ' to call the chief now Pol. Res. to in possession of Bahrein to account for his breach of the Teh., tel. of maritime peace and for the« attack on Sheikh Ali bin 14.11.1869. Khalifah, who had been placed in power by the British Government.' 15.11.1869. 89. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on receipt of the notification in .question stated that the ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifah, who had, he said, been the cause of the recent disturbances, had been killed (this was in fact incorrect); that the Resident's action would therefore be useless, and that the Persian Government hoped that he would be telegraphically instructed not to proceed to Bahrein. He added that the Persian Government would themselves keep the affairs of Bahrein by land in order and that should anything happen to affect its affairs by sea they would Teh. Desp. request the British Government to send a naval force to put 83 of affairs in order, ' but up till now the state of affairs in 16.11.1869. Bahrein had not fallen into disorder.' 90. The Persian agent referred to in paragraph 87 above arriving in the Gulf at this stage addressed letters to Sheikh25 Mohammed bin Abdullah (see paragraph 86 above) intimating his recognition as Sheikh, and despatched them by a special messenger, who proceeded to the island in a native boat belonging to a Persian. The messenger was, however, on his arrival prevented by the Resident from landing or communicating with the Sheikh, and his letters were Bushire detained and ultimately handed by the Resident to Sheikh Desp. 216 of Mohammed bin Abdullah after the submission of that Sheikh, who returned them to Colonel Pelly after perusal. The messenger stated that he had himself no authority from the Shah's Government and was deputed by the Chief of Dayer, who was acting in obedience to Mirza Mehdi Khan. S ubmission of U surping S heikhs. Sheikh Isa bin All becomes Sheikh. 91. The punitive operations against Bahrein resulted in the complete submission of Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah and Pol. Res. to the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah in September 1869. It may Govt, of be remarked that prior to the opening of operations Sheikh Abdullah made overtures to the Resident, which were, how- n ever, rejected, with a view to securing recognition by His 181 of Majesty's Government. He also appealed to the Wahabi 25.9.1869, Amir for recognition and protection. Sheikh Isa bin Ali, son of the murdered Sheikh Ali, voluntarily assumed the 5 - :L01869 - vacant Chiefship and was recognised by the Resident on behalf of the Government of India ('in no way did Colonel Pelly influence the succession') and the ex-Sheikh and Mohammed bin Abdullah were deported to India. Shortly Teh. Desp. after his installation the new Sheikh received a letter from one Hydar Khan, Zabit of the Dashti district on the Persian coast, advising him to place himself under the Shah's ^ 7 ^ p * protection, but the incident appears to have been unim- 12.1.1870. portant. P ersian P rotest, 1869-70. Views of Government of India, 92. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs appears at first to have received news of the removal of the ex-Sheikh with equanimity and is said to have remarked that Persia and Great Britain had an equal interest in the maintenance of peace by sea and that Persia had therefore no reason to object to the punishment of the delinquent. But he protested in strong terms against the Resident's action in preventing the Persian agent from landing and holding communication with the Sheikh, and a still stronger protest ^ was made by the Persian Minister in London. The Govern ment of India, in the exhaustive reports they submitted on the Resident's action, urged, after a review of the history of the islands, that the Shah had no legitimate control over the Sheikh of Bahrein ; that his Government had nevertheless encouraged the piratical faction in the Persian Gulf by sending letters of recognition to the piratical leader; that in styling Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah Chief of Bahrein the Persian Government ignored the facts that he had never held sway in Bahrein, belonged to the younger branch of the ruling family, and so had neither by right nor possession claim to this title; and that, so -far from the Shah having any just cause of complaint against the Resident, the Persian Government should be called upon to give some explanation of the conduct of its officers in encouraging a piratical expedition which was prejudicial to British interests in the Persian Gulf and for the successive appointment by them of Ali bin Khalifa and Md. bin Khalifa to the sovereignty of a district over which they had no legitimate control. The Government of India added that they had no confirmation of the alleged overtures of Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa to Persia (paragraph 87 above), as to which further enquiry was being made of Her Majesty's Minister 2953 G-26 (see paragraphs 94—95 below), but in any event could not admit ' that such overtures, made without its knowledge and consent, can in anyway affect its treaty relations with Bahrein.' British Reply to Persia, March 1870. 93. Her Majesty's Minister was therefore instructed by the Foreign Office that it appeared possible that Her Majesty's Government, instead of furnishing explanations to Persia, To Teh., might have cause to complain '* of the proceedings of the No. 22,' Persian authorities in endeavouring to communicate with a 30.3.1870. piratical chief who had been guilty of a breach of the Mari time Truce, and who had attacked the Chief placed in power at Bahrein by the British Government,' and was informed that no notice would be taken of the complaints against the Resident until the Persian Government gave a full explana tion of the intercepted letters. Supplementary Reports hy Her Majesty's Minister, Tehran, April 1870. 94. On 6th April 1870 the Minister at Tehran reported as follows to the Government of India : — ' In my Despatch No. 81 ... I reported that the Firman of appointment was originally in the name of Ali bin Khalifa, but that, on hearing of his death, it was altered in favour of his brother, Md. bin Khalifa. This information had reached me from a relation of . . . one of the principal Persian officials in Shiraz, and not . . . from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. When further intelligence reached Shiraz from the Gulf and it was supposed that Md. bin Abdullah would retain possession of Bahrein, the Pirman was probably again altered in his favour, as it was to him that it was eventually forwarded. In conversation with the Persian Minister this afternoon His Excellency admitted that this was probably the case. He said that Mirza Mehdi Khan on leaving Tehran had received general instructions for his guidance respecting the Bahrein question, but that the details were settled at Shiraz and the Firman was issued in the name of the Persian Governor of Fars and not in that of the Shah. The name inserted in this document had certainly, he said, been altered once to his knowledge, and it was not unlikely that it had been changed a second time before being forwarded to its destination. ' With regard to the overtures said to have been made by Ali bin Khalifa to the Persian Government, as reported in my Despatch No. 81, I have the honour to state that that information also reached me from a private source and not from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. His Excellency has, however, asserted very positively to me to-day that Ali bin Khalifa had repeatedly written to the Persian Government professing allegiance to the Shah and that a number of letters containing assurances of this kind are now in his (the Minister's) possession. ' It appears to me that on the receipt of a correspon dence which passed last April between Her Majesty's Government and the Shah's representative in London, the Persian Ministers, believing that the Bahrein Chief was himself well disposed to further their designs, resolved to take measures with a view to establishing, if possible, the Shah's authority in that quarter and make good his claim to exercise sovereign rights over Bahrein. Mirza Mehdi Khan was accordingly dispatched to Shiraz and Bushire and a certain latitude was given to him as to the mode in which he should proceed to carry out the wishes of his Government. The Persian authorities in Shiraz finally determined that a Firman should be addressed to Md. bin Abdullah, conferring27 ^P 0 '* 11111 i tbe government of Bahrein and with this ni 6 - ^ i 11 a ^ e t 0 come to terms with the Obiet then in possession of the place. But in this matter the sole object of all concerned would seem to have been to carry out the policy of the Persian Govern ment at Bahrein without reference to the interests or wishes of Her Majesty's Government in that quarter.' 95 On 8th April 1870 the Minister at Tehran addressed the following despatch to the Government of India : - ^ u With reference to my despatch of the 6th instant, m which I stated that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed me that Ali bin Khalifa had lepeatedly made overtures to Persia admitting his allegiance to the Shah, I have the honour to report to Your Excellency that Mirza Sayed Khan has just sent to inform me that he was mistaken in making this assertion, and that he finds on enquiry that the letters to which he referred were not from that Chief, but from Md. bin Khalifa.' Views of Government of India, May 1870. 96. The Government of India, commenting on these facts, remarked that Mehdi Khan appeared to have left Tehran with a general discretion as to which of the various Sheikhs should be recognised as ruler. ' At the capital no more definite plan appears to have been resolved on than that measures should be adopted to establish the Sheikh's assumed right of sovereignty over the island.' 97. The Government of India proceeded that they had already pointed out that any disposition to admit the claims of Persia would probably lead to the revival of similar claims on the part of Turkey, a result which had in fact now been brought about (cp. paragraph 99 below). ' This (i.e. the T urkish) claim rests on no better foundation than that of Persia. It was summarily rejected by Lord Palmerston in 1851 and in our opinion should not again be reopened. With equal reason: the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan of Muscat could claim the sovereignty of the island, if the nominal and temporary tender of allegiance, in times of difficulty, and as a security against foreign intervention, be considered sufficient ground on which to base such preten sions. On the same ground indeed we might claim Bahrein as a part of the British dominions. But, as we have repeatedly observed, the real status of the island, and the only one which we have recognised and admitted, or are prepared to recognise and admit, in all our dealings in the Persian Gulf and our negotiations with the Chiefs, is that of an independent State, subject neither to Persia nor to ^ of I- Turkey, neither to the Wahabis nor to Muscat, nor yet to O f^o 5^1870 the British Government.' Review of Discussions of 1868-70. 98. The matter ultimately lapsed. But from the facts and the correspondence summarised above it will be seen, in the first place, that there appears to be no foundation for the alleged overtures to Persia by the ruling Sheikh, Ali bin Khalifa, or for the statement that the Persian flag was flying at the time of the punitive expedition of 1868 ; and that if any overtures were made to Persia in 1868-69 (and there is no confirmatory evidence of any such overtures) they would appear to have been made by the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, presumably in his anxiety to secure Persian support for his restoration. Secondly, while the statements contained in the Note sent by the Foreign Office on behalf of Her Majesty's Government to the Persian Charge d'Affaires on 29th April 1869 were widely phrased, and afford some justification for the interpretation placed on them by Persia, and while the Persians may have been confirmed in their view by the absence of any protest by Her Majesty's Minister against the mission of Mirza Mehdi Khan, the terms of that Note do28 not, in fact, constitute more than a recognition^ that Persia had in the past repeatedly pressed her claim to Bahrein, and that Her Majesty's Government did not claim sovereignty over that island and interested themselves in its affairs only to the extent necessary to^ discharge their treaty obligations to its rulers (which included a guarantee of defence against external aggression) and to ensure the peace of the Gulf, Finally, that while Her Majesty's Government agreed to notify Persia, when circumstances permitted, before taking punitive action against Bahrein, on the only occasion on which (immediately after) they appear to have given effect to this undertaking, the terms of their communication made it clear that they regarded themselves as at liberty to punish the usurping Sheikhs Md. bin Abdullah and Md. bin Khalifa (m accordance with the obligations assumed by them under the Treaties of 1820 and 1861 with Bahrein) for their piratical attack on Bahrein and murder of the Chief placed in power there by the British Government. X. 1870-80. From the Turkish Occupation of Hasa to the First Exclusive Agreement. I'urkish Protest, 1870. 99. In January 1870 a protest was received from the Turkish Government against the recent ^ actions of the F.O. to I.O., Resident at Bahrein. In reply the Turkish Government 11.1.1870, were informed that Her Majesty's Government could not T 31 T 7 qoi recognise the Turkish claim to sovereignty over Bahrein; Lor. i, yu . ^ were courteously reminded of the intimation made to them in 1851 on Lord Palmerston's instructions (para graph 61 above). Turkish Occupation of Easa. British Assurances to Bahrein ^ 1871. 100. In 1871 the Turks occupied Hasa. Protests at Constantinople in April and May 1871 against rumoured Turkish designs on Bahrein resulted in a repudiation by Turkey of any such designs. The assurances received from the Turkish Government were communicated to the Sheikh of Bahrein, who had asked Her Majesty's Government for their advice and their protection against the Turks m Lor. 1, 902. May 1871, and he was informed that so long as he observed the provisions of the Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70 above) the reciprocal obligations towards bim of Great Britain would be fulfilled. 101. Protests about the same time at Constantinople led to a Turkish repudiation of the designs which the Turkish Lor. I, 919. Government were alleged to have entertained at Bahrein, and the Turkish authorities in Hasa were given instructions by their Government which debarred them from approaching Bahrein. In May 1871 the Shah enquired from Her Majesty's Representative at Tehran as to the probable effect on Bahrein of the Turkish occupation of Hasa and was informed in reply of the assurances which had been given to Her Majesty's Government by the Turks. Reply io Persian Legation at Constantinople as to meaning of British Note of April 1869. 102. In November 1871 the Secretary of the Persian Legation at Constantinople made enquiries of Her Majesty's Ambassador in connection with a rumour that a Turkish expedition was to be sent for the reduction of Bahrein, ' which island the Persian Secretary stated had been acknowledged by the British Government as a portion of Hertslet, 28. the Persian dominions and ... in proof of this assertion he had handed to Sir H. Elliott a copy of the note which t ?' 1 Lord Clarendon addressed to General Haji Mohsin Khan on 15 0 3.1872. 28th April 1869. Sir H. Elliott, however, observed that he29 saw in that note nothing more than an acknowledgment that the claim had previously been made, but that he was unwilling to discuss the point, as he believed there was no danger of any attempt being made to interfere with the position of Bahrein as it then stood.' Turkish Claims, 1871-79. 103. Consequent on the murder of a Turkish messenger in Bahrein in August or September 1871, the Turkish Government demanded reparation direct from the Sheikh and received a conciliatory reply. On their demand being pressed the Sheikh, on the advice of the Resident, suggested that the matter be arranged between the British and the Turkish Governments, by whose joint decision he would abide, but the Turkish Government preferred that it should be settled direct by the parties by agents. Her Majesty's Government saw no objection to such a procedure so long as no compulsion or show of force by Turkey was involved. The Turks, however, let the matter drop. The incident is of some interest as illustrating the view taken by Her Majesty's Government of the Sheikh as an independent ruler who might deal direct with foreign Powers. 104. In August 1872, a further complaint having been received from Turkey of British proceedings in regard to Bahrein and the commission of 'acts of sovereignty' on F.O. to the part of the English, the Ambassador was informed in Turkish reply that enquiries would be made into the point raised by ^^g^ ador him and that his Government might rest assured that it was Hertslet 30 not the intention of Her Majesty's Government to interfere in the affairs of the Persian Gulf beyond what was imposed upon them by treaty for the preservation of peace in the waters The Ambassador was finally informed in April 1873, after investigation, that there were no grounds what ever for the statement that the British Government had attempted to exercise acts of sovereignty over Bahrein. 105. In 1874, consequent on a Turkish claim to conscript Bahreinis resident in Basra, the Turkish Ambassador in London was referred to the British Notes of 1851 and 1870 (paragraphs 61 and 99 above), which stated that Her Majesty's Government did not admit the claims of Turkey to consider Bahrein as part of the Ottoman dominions. In the same year, on a piratical attack being made on the island by certain Bahreini exiles who had signed a petition claiming Turkish protection, the Ambassador at Constan tinople handed a memorandum to the Porte in which it was stated that Her Majesty's Government could not recognise any rights or pretensions of the Porte over Bahrein. In 1875 a rumour that Her Majesty's Government were forti fying Bahrein led to representations from Turkey. The Lor - ^ rumour was unfounded and the Turks were so informed. On its becoming known about the same time that the Turks Lor - I ' 915 - themselves contemplated building a lighthouse on the island, the British Government entered a protest at Constantinople (October 1875), with the result that the project was abandoned. 106. In 1876, consequent on steps taken by the Turkish authorities to enforce the claims of Qatar merchants against Bahreinis, a Note was addressed to the Porte reminding them of the determination of Her Majesty's Government to protect Bahrein against any attack on its independence. 107. In 1879-80 the Turkish Government took up the cause of the rebels of 1869. Her Majesty's Government, after again disclaiming the exercise of sovereignty over Lor. 1,915. Bahrein, which they regarded, they said, as independent, promised to make enquiries as to certain acts of which com plaint was made by petitioners to the Turkish Government. 2953 H30 First Exclusive Agreement between Her Majesty 's Government and the Sheikh of Bahrein (1880). 108. In 1880 the Political Resident, finding that the Sheikh was disposed to conclude a special arrangement witik the British Government, entered on the 22nd December into what is known as the First Exclusive Agreement with him. Aitchison, By this Agreement the Sheikh undertook on behalf of Vol. XI, himself and his ' successors in the Government of Bahrein No. xxii, to the Brit i s h Government to abstain from entering into negotiations or making treaties of any sort with any State or Government other thau the British without the consent of the said British Government, and to refuse permission to any other Government than the British to ^ establish diplomatic or consular agencies or coaling depots in our territory, unless with the consent of the British Government. This engagement does not apply to or affect the customary friendly correspondence with the local authorities ^ of neighbouring States on business of minor importance.' The agreement was approved by Her Majesty's Government and a-atified in 1881. Summary, 1870-80. 109. The claims of the Wahabi Amir disappear with the subjugation of Hasa by the Turks in 1871. The Turkish claim'was repeatedly pressed during this period and was consistently rejected by Her Majesty s Government. The Persian claim appears to have been dormant. Her Majesty's Government repudiate suggestions that they have committed ' acts of sovereignty ' and continue to express their view that the Sheikh is an independent ruler. In 1880 the Sheikh entered into his first exclusive agreement with Her Majesty's Government. XI. 1880-92. From the conclusion of the First to the conclusion of the Second Exclusive Agreement with Her Majesty 's Government. Persian Demarche, 1886. 110. In September 1886 the Shah sent a verbal message to Her Majesty's Government through the Minister at Tehran Lor. I, 919. t hat he considered the communication made to him in April Teh. tel. 188, 1869 as tantamount to an admission of his rights in Bahrein 27.9.1886. and that he was anxious to establish his authority effectually over the islands either by sending a Governor to Bahrein or TT.O. to I.O., possibly by recognising the Sheikh as representative of 30.7.1886. p ers i au authority, but that he wished the maritime police to fO.-Te.., remain i n the hands of the British authorities. An answer 8.10.1886. ' was prepared by Her Majesty's Government to the effect that they did not concur in His Majesty's interpretation of the communication of April 1869. They had treaty^ engage ments with the Sheikh, whom they considered to be indepen dent, and must hold the Sheikh to his engagements while fulfilling those they had contracted towards him. As, however, the Shah did not return to the subject, the message was not delivered. Lor. I, 911. in. In the same year presents sent from the Persian Governor of Lar to the Sheikh were returned to the sender. 112. In 1887-88 Persian intrigues took place with a view to the establishment of Persian influence on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf, These were of little importance in the case of Bahrein, but it may be recorded that it appears that in the case of that principality the Persian Government had sanctioned a scheme for the seizure of Bahrein by Sheikh Lor.

Two British ships were in February 1888 stationed off Bahrein, with instructions to prevent by force any hostile attempt to land by the Turks, Arabs or Persians, and the Minister at31 Tehran was asked by the Government of India so to inform the Persian Government. As, however, the Amin-us-Sultan, on being questioned disavowed all designs on Bahrein Her Majesty's Minister thought it better to avoid the reference to forcible action. Warning to Turkey, 1888, 113. In March 1888 the Turkish Government were informed that any attempt to effect a landing in Bahrein would be opposed by force, and that no claim by the Porte to jurisdiction over Bahrein could be admitted, since Her Majesty's Government regarded the Sheikh as an independent ruler with whom they were in treaty relations. Second Exclusive Agreement between Her Majesty's Government and Bahrein (1892). 114. On the 13th March 1892 the Political Resident signed a second Exclusive Agreement with the Sheikh of Bahrein on behalf of Her Majesty's Government. The provisions of the Agreement (which was ratified on 12th May 1892, and. which was expressed to be binding on the Sheikh, his heirs, and successors) were as follows:— (1) That I will on no account enter into any agreement Aitchigon or correspondence with any Power other than the C 1933 )' British Government. ^ ol - ??'oqo (2) ' That without the assent of the British Government I will not consent to the residence within my territory of the agent of any other Government. (3) ' That 1 will on no account cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part of my territory, save to the British Government.' Further Warning to Turkey, November 1892. 115. In November 1892 the Ottoman Government were Const. Desp. warned (apropos of the position of Bahreinis at Basra) that ^o- 34 8 of Bahrein was under British protection, and that no interference 15 - 1:l - 1892 - with its natives by the Ottoman authorities could be admitted. In the same year the Porte was informed, with reference to a rumoured intention to land Turkish troops, that such action would be opposed by Her Majesty's ships. Summary, 1880-92. 116. The Turkish claim was again pressed vigorously during this period and was consistently rejected by Her Majesty's Government. The Shah raised the question of the Persian claim in 1886, but did not press the matter. In .1892 the Sheikh entered into his Second Exclusive Agreement with Her Majesty's Government. XII.—1892-1913. From the Second Exclusive Agreement to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. British repudiations of Turkish Claims, 1892-98. 117. In 1895 steps were taken at Constantinople by Her Majesty's Government to check an attempted invasion of Bahrein from Qatar, which seemed not improbably to have Lor. I, 935. been inspired by the Turks, and later in the same year Her Majesty's Government twice reiterated to the Porte that Bahrein was under British protection and that no inter ference with it would be tolerated. The views of Her Majesty's Government on the status of the island were again officially repeated at Constantinople on two occasions in 1896. In 1897 the Constantinople Board of Health proposed to establish a sanitary post in Bahrein. The proposal was abandoned on the objections of the British delegate, who represented that Bahrein was an independent principality under British protection. 118. In 1898 a Turkish request that a British Vice- Consul alleged to have been appointed at Bahrein should32 apply to the Turkish Government for his exequatur was .or I 935 refused ou the ground that Her Majesty's Government could not admit the right of the Turkish Government to insist that a British Consular Officer in Bahrein should be provided with a Turkish exequatur. In 1899 the Minister at Tehran informed the French representative at that capital that since 1880 the Sheikh was precluded by treaty from holding direct relations with any Power other than Her Majesty's Government and that his subjects abroad were now under British protection. 119. A native British Agent had for a long period of years been maintained in Bahrein. In 1900 a British Political Agent was appointed at Bahrein. The post has been maintained since that date, and has been filled by an officer of the Indian Political Department since 1904. The Incident of 1901. 120. On 31st August 1901 a Belgian customs official m Lor I 935- the service of the Persian Government visited Bahrein, 6. * ' where he called on the Sheikh and informed him that he had been deputed by the Shah to obtain his consent to place Persian custom officials in Bahrein. An official protest was at once made by His Majesty s Minister^ to the Persian Government, in the course of which Sir A. Hardmge remarked that no intimation had been given to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf ' of this Persian mission to an Arab State under British protection and bound by special treaties, of which the Persian Government cannot be No. 140 of ignorant, to the Government of India . . . It is my duty 18.9.1901. to place on record in the clearest manner that His Majesty the Emperor of India cannot acquiesce in any foieign interference in the affairs of Bahrein . . . and that any attempt to disturb the relations established by treaties of long standing between those Chiefs and the^ Government of India will be regarded as an unfriendly act.' The Attabeg- i-Azam, in a note received on the 17th September 1901, replied: 'As I have told you verbally, M. Simais has had no instructions from the Persian Government on this matter, and if there have been any steps on his part it must have been by mistake and he will be reprimanded for it.' The Disorders of 1904-05. 121. In 1904-05, consequent on a series of attacks on Lor. 1, 938- Persians and on German subjects in Bahrein, the Persians 42.' ' appealed to the Shah. The Persian Government replied that His Majesty's Government would take action on their behalf. The text of their telegram was as follows : 14 To the Merchants and Traders of the High Government living in Bahrein. Your telegram on the subject of the assaults which have been made upon you by the Arab roughs of Bahrein has been received. Certainly let your minds be at rest. Con sultations with the English Legation have taken place on this subject, and it will shortly be settled in such a way that the oppression will be removed and that the offenders will receive their proper punishment.' 122. The Germans complained to the German Vice- Consul at Bushire, who made a direct request to the Sheikh for reparation, in reply to which he was referred by His Excellency to His Majesty's Government. The Sheikh was ultimately compelled by His Majesty's Government to give redress. Turkish Protest, 1904-05. 123. On the Turks pressing in 1904-05 for an explanation Lor. I, 944. of the action taken by His Majesty's Government in connection33 with the ill-treatment of the German subject, the Turkish Ambassador was informed by Lord Lansdowne that it was a F.O. to Con- matter ot common knowledge and well known to the Turkish stantinople, Government, that His Majesty's Government had direct ?9% 5 iQnf relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein ; that the island and 22 - 2 - 1905 - its natives were under British protection; and that His Majesty s Government were within their rights in taking measures to obtain redress for the outrage committed there. On the Ambassador reverting to the subject later in 1905 he was informed (20th May 1905) that His Majesty's Government must decline to entertain any further represen tations from the Turkish Government on the subject. Reassertions of Persian Claim, 1905-13. 124. In 1905 the Persians again reasserted their claim. On the 19th .February 1906, in reply to a further reiteration which appears to have been based on the treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857, the Minister at Tehran informed the Persian 19 21906 Government that ' The Treaties of 1809, of 1814 and of 185/ on this subject have always been scrupulously observed by His Majesty s Government, but have no bearing on the present question. His^ Majesty's Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein. Such a claim is in their view entirely inadmissible. His Majesty's Government consider the island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be under British protection, and must decline to entertain any further representations on the subject. I am further to mention that this reply has invariably been made to the Ottoman Government, who have on several occasions advanced a claim to Bahrein.' The Note concluded by a reference to the Persian appeal for our assistance in 1904—05 and quoted in extenso the telegram of reassurance (paragraph 121 above) to the Persian inhabitants of Bahrein then sent on behalf of the Persian Government. 125. On 13th September 1906 the Persian Grand Vizier revived the Persian claim in a letter referring to Captain Bruce's unauthorised agreement of 1822. He was reminded 3x1907. in reply that that agreement had been expressly disavowed by His Majesty's Government and that Captain Bruce had Teh. Desp. been recalled. In a supplementary note the Grand Vizier's No.^ 61 of attention was drawn to the fact that the then Shah himself 27 - 3 - 1907 - had ' refused to recognise ' the stipulations of the Treaty of 1822, which had never been ratified, and had ' expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government without his knowledge or instructions.' Tell i) es ^ 126. On the Ala-es-Sultaneh reviving the Persian claim, No. 179 of on the ground of the Agreement of 1822, in August 1907, 15 - 8190 ' 7 - his attention was drawn in a Note dated 13th August 1907 to the Notes referred to in the preceding paragraph; and to the fact that the Agreement had been disavowed alike by His Majesty's Government and by the Shah. The Note added that since 1822 the Turkish Government have raised claims on Bahrein, and, like the Persian Govern ment, have been informed that Bahrein is under British protection.' 127. In 1908 the Persian Government, in a correspondence regarding the punishment of a Bahrein subject at Lingah, Teb.tel 95 intimated that instructions had been sent to Lingah that of 11 ' 4190 • reparation should be made, but added that His Majesty's Minister would admit that ' the proprietary right of the Persian Government over the island is not a matter to be disputed.' The Note was returned as inadmissible to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A modified version was sub sequently accepted by His Majesty's Government, which was acknowledged by a Note from His Majesty's Minister, 22.1.1909. . 2953 I34 reaffirming that His Majesty's Government maintained as regards the status of Bahreinis in Persia the position that the island of Bahrein and its inhabitants were under British protection, and that they would be guided entirely by their own views of the position should any action of the 1 ersian Government make representations necessary. 128. Early in 1910 the Persian Government assimilated the formalities to be fulfilled in the case of persons visiting Bahrein to those prescribed in the case of^ travellers to Persian ports, a measure which, as pointed out by the Foreign Office at the time, constituted a fresh attempt to assert Persian sovereignty over the island, but it was agreed that in view of the undesirability of raising the general question, no protest should be made to them. In J uly of the same year it was reported that internal Persian coastal passes issued to persons proceeding to Bahrein from Persian ports were vise by a Persian merchant residing in Bahrein. In 1912 the individual in question was forbidden to take any action in regard to the endorsement of passes held by P.O. 13: 67, Persian subjects for travelling in Bahrein. The endorse- § 24 ments in question were, however, henceforth granted by the Political Ptesident-—a practice, as pointed out by the Political Resident nine years later, ' of itself open to objection, as it might be construed into a tacit admission that the Persian passport authorities are justified in giving passes for another Persian port to persons going to Bahrein.'' Withdrawal of Turkish Claim to Bahrein in Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913. 129. On 29th July 1913 His Majesty's Government signed a convention (which still awaited ratification on the outbreak of the War of 1914-18) with the Ottoman Govern ment. under which that Government renounced all their claims to the islands of Bahrein, the independence of which they recognised. His Majesty's Government on their part declared that they had no intention of annexing the islands and undertook not to allow the Sheikh of Bahrein to disturb the autonomy of the peninsula of El Katr or to annex it, and to ensure that the Sheikh should not discriminate against Ottoman subjects in the matter of dues levied upon pearl fisheries. The Turkish Government on their side accepted a reservation of the right of the population of Bahrein to visit Zakhnuniyah Island for fishing, and recognised the rights of subjects of the Sheikh to British consular protection in Turkey. This arrangement, followed, as it was, by the disappearance of Turkey from the Gulf after the War of 1914-18, disposed of the Turkish claim to Bahrein, which had been reasserted on numerous occasions and with great insistence since 1847. Summary, 1892-1913. 130. The Turkish claim was repeatedly raised during the early part of this period, but consistently opposed by His Majesty's Government. It was finally abandoned in the (unratified) Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913. While that Convention was never ratified, the abandonment of the Turkish claim was confirmed by Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausaune of 1923. The Persian claim was also frequently pressed and was consistently repudiated in strong terms by His Majesty's Government. Xin.—1913-34.

An Order in Council conferring such jurisdiction on the Political Agent was made in 1913. It was supplemented by a further Order in 1922. Since 1920 jurisdiction over all foreign subjects has rested with the British authorities within the limits of the Orders in Council. 132. The Sheikh, on 14th May 1914, undertook not to Aitcll XI entertain any overtures for an oil concession save after No. xvi, ' consultation with the Political Agent and with the approval 2 39.

Bahrein. . . Persian Claim reasserted, 1922-23. 134. In 1922 His Majesty's Consul at Bunder Abbas reported that the Persian passport officials at Lingah had ruled that Bahreinis were Persian subjects and should be given Persian passports. They seized two British certificates of identitj^ granted to Bahrein subjects, but on representa tions being made by the Minister at Tehran instructions were given by the Central Government that there was to be no repetition of this incident. In 1922, also, the Persian p ^ ^ delegate at a Postal Conference held at Bushire stated that ^ ^ 26 while not for the moment pressing for the transfer to Persia of the Bahrein post office, his action was without prejudice to the Persian claim to Bahrein. 135. In 1923, consequent on a Press campaign and a discussion in the Majliss on the desirability of giving Bahrein the right to return a member to the Persian Parlia ment, which was referred to a Commission for report, His Majesty's Government decided that it was desirable to address a formal Note to the Persian Government in terms similar to those employed in 1906 (paragraph 124 above). Owing to the difficult internal situation in Persia this proposal was dropped, but in September 1923 the Persian ^_g ^ ^ Government was informed that the island was now a British 9 ' protectorate, and that His Majesty's Government did not contemplate any alteration of its status. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that the Government of which he was a member had no intention of laying claim to Bahrein on behalf of Persia. But despite this statement the Minister for Foreign Affairs again reverted to the question in the following month. His Majesty's Government remove Sheikh Isa for Misgovernment (1923). 136. Consequent on the gross misgovernment of Sheikh Isa, who had been ruler of Bahrein since 1869, the Sheikh was deprived by His Majesty's Government of his contiol of affairs in Bahrein on 26th May 1923, and was granted an p Q. ^ allowance, his son, Sheikh Hamad (whose right of succession 6 3_ 4? had been recognised by His Majesty's Government in 1901) §§ 11-14 being appointed to act for him ' as his fathei s lul y empowered agent.' Oil concession granted by Sheikh, 1925. 137. In 1925 an oil concession was granted by the Sheikh of Bahrein to the Eastern and General Syndicate, a British corporation, with the approval of His Majesty s Government.36 Uudevtakings secuved fTom Ihn Saud in Treaty of Jedda, 1927. Persian Protest. 138. The Treaty of Jedda, concladed on 20th May 1927, between His Majesty s Government and Ihn Saud, the mler of Saudi Arabia, in substitution for the Treaty of 1915 (paragraph ]33 above), provided inter oZia that His Majesty the King of the Hedjaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies' should 'maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of . . . Bahrein and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty's Government.' Consequent thereon, a strong protest was received on 26th November 1927 from the Persian Government, copies of which were despatched to the League of Nations. The Persian protest was based essentially on the recognition stated to have been accorded to Persian sovereignty over Bahrein in Lord Clarendon's Note of 29th April 18(39 (paragraph 85 above). A reasoned reply to the Persian Note was despatched by His Majesty's Government on 18th January 1928, and circulated to the League. ^ While avoiding any definite statement as to their own position in Bahrein or its basis. His Majesty's Government in their Note repudiated the Persian claim in the strongest terms, and intimated that no argument such as was suggested could be based on the communication of 29th April 1869. Attitude of Sheikhs to Persian claim (1928). 139. The Sheikhs of Bahrein, on being apprised of the revival of Persia's claim, gave a letter to the Political Resident, requesting His Majesty's Government in accordance P. 1409/28. with their treaties ' to defend Bahrein from outside inter ference ' and to act as their agents in rebutting the Persian claims, and intimating that the Sheikhs proposed to send Sheikh Mohamed, brother of Sheikh Hamad, the deputy ruler, and son of the deposed ruler, Isa, as their representative in answering the claim should the case be taken to Geneva. Further Persian Protest, 2nd August 1928. 140. On the 2nd August 1928 the Persian G over anient P. 4184/28. communicated a lengthy and reasoned reply to the British Note of 18th January 1928. The Note based its reiteration of the Persian claim on the principle that territory belonging to a sovereign State could definitely be detached from that State only with the consent of the State in question, which had not been given in the case of Bahrein ; and alleged that the terms of the Foreign Office Note of 29th April 1869 were con clusive evidence of the view then held of the rights of Persia by His Majesty's Government; that Bahrein had consistently recognised Persian sovereignty, as could be proved by documentary evidence, up to the date when the Sheikhs were instigated to rebellion by a foreign government; that no valid argument could be founded on the direct relations into which the Sheikhs had entered with His Majesty's Govern ment, since their action had been without the approval of their suzerain ; that the relations of Bahrein with Persia were more highly developed than with any other independent civilised country; that the Persian claim had been con sistently and uninterruptedly pressed ; and finally that even if the Treaty of 1822 was disavowed by His Majesty's Government, it was material evidence of the view held by a British officer of great experience at the time of its con clusion, and that its disavowal by the then Shah of Persia was not because of any doubt on his part as to the true status of Bahrein. P. 1640/29 141. A reasoned reply, which examined in detail the arguments put forward by the Persian Government and reached the conclusion that they were without substance, was despatched and circulated to the League at the request of His Majesty's Government on 18th February 1929. Aitch., XI, No. vii, 227-9. 26.11.1927. P. 5559/27. P. 322/2837 Assignment of Bahrein Oil Concession to American Interests, 1930. Fresh Persian Protest. 142. On 23rd July 1930, the oil concession granted to P. 5723/30 the Eastern and General Syndicate in 1925 having been by that Corporation, with the approval of the feheikh and His Majesty's Government, to an American subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California, a formal piotest against such assignment was received trom the Persian Government, based on the ground that, Bahrein being Persian territory, neither the Sheikh nor His Majesty's Government had any right to grant a concession. The protest reserved the right of Persia to claim damages. Treaty negotiations were at the time proceeding with Persia, and it was thought unnecessary to send any reply to this Note, which was, however, circulated, at the request of the Persian Government, to the League of Nations. D iscussions between H is M ajesty's G overnment and P ersia 1928-34. .143. Between 1928 and 1934 treaty negotiations, with a view to the conclusion of a general treaty which should dispose of outstanding points of difference, were in progress with Persia, the question of Bahrein figuring prominently in those negotiations. The general attitude taken by the Persians was that Bahrein was a point of great importance to them, but that in return for a sufficient quid pro quo they would be prepared to abandon their claims. His Majesty's Government on their side consistently maintained that the Persian claim was worthless, and that while they would gladly see it finally disposed of as part of a general settlement, they would not be prepared to make any specific concession in return for its abandonment. Various formulas were worked out in discussion between His Majesty's Representatives in Tehran and the representatives of the Persian Government with a view to an agreed solution. The negotiations have, however, failed to reach any conclusion and are at the moment suspended without any prospect of early resumption. 144. In 1932 the Persian Government protested to His P-Z. 4902/33 Majesty's Government against the issue of British Indian postage stamps surcharged u Bahrein,' and repeated their protest to the League. Their protest was rejected by His Majesty's Government, and the stamps issued in August 1933. On 22nd May 1934 a further protest against the operation of the Bahrein oil concession was addressed by P.Z. 4343/34 the Persian Government to the United States Minister at Tehran, the United States Government and His Majesty's Government, and copies were circulated at the request of Persia to the League of Nations. His Majesty's Governmpnt propose to reply to this communication in a Note drawing attention to their Notes of January 1928 and February 1929 and to request the League of Nations to circulate this reply to the States Members of the League. XIV.—Conclusion. 145. It may be convenient in concluding this memoran dum on the recent history of Bahrein to summarise very briefly the claims to sovereignty over the island which have been advanced by various countries since 1783 ; the particular basis of those claims in the case, of Persia (whose claim is alone at the present time of any importance); and the basis and development of the attitude of His Majesty s Government. A —Claims to or Assertions of Sovereignty over Bahrein, 1873 to 1934. 146.— (a) Muscat. —Bahrein subject to Muscat 1800-01, 1811? to 1816, 1820-22. Tribute paid to- Muscat .1820. 2953 • K38 Bahreini independence recognised by Treaty 1829. Muscat thereafter deterred by His Majesty's Government from pursuing its claims. •. (h) Egypt. —Representative of Mehemet Ah, Viceroy ot Egypt, informed by Her Majesty's Government in 1839 that no claim upon Bahrein could be admitted. But in 1839-40 the Sheikh acknowledged Egyptian supremacy and he paid tribute during this period. (c) Wahabi Amirs of the Arab MainUud—Bahrein under protection of or subject to Wahabi Amirs 1803-11 ; 1816 ; 1830-33 (tributary); 1836-1838-39 (tributary); 1847 (tributary); 1852 (tribute). In 1867 (see paragraph 75) it was held by Government of India that tribute was paid to the Wahabis only in respect of mainland possessions and not of Bahrein. The claims of the Amirs disappeared with the conquest of Hasa by Turkey in 1871. ((?.) Turkey. —The islands have never in the period subse quent to 1783 been occupied by Turkey or (if the incidents of 1860-61 (paragraphs 67-9 above) are ignored) subject to Turkish sovereignty. But Turkish claims to them were advanced, directly or indirectly, in 1847, 1851, 1870, 1874, 1875, 1876, 1879, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1895, 1896 and 1905, and on each occasion, save in 1847, when certain assurances were given by Turkey (paragraph 52), were rejected by the British Government. The Turkish claim was finally withdrawn in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. That Convention was never ratified, but the withdrawal of the claim was confirmed by Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, (e) Persia.— The Persian claim has been consistently urged on a variety of occasions through the period in question. The Sheikhs momentarily submitted themselves to Persia in 1799 and paid tribute. In 1816-17 they received a Persian envoy and apparently appealed for help to Tehran. They again momentarily submitted to Persia and received an envoy in 1839. Persian aid was invoked and a Persian emissary received at Bahrein in 1860-61, while in 1869 the deposed ex-Sheikh Mohammed ^ bin Khalifa may have made overtures to Persia (though there is no confirmation of this) to enable him to re-establish his control over the island. The Persian claim appears, apart from this, to have been asserted in 1822, 1825, 1844, 1848, 1861, 1862, 1866, 1868, 1869,1886, 1901, 1905, 1905, 1907, 1910, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1932-33 and 1934, and to have been rejected by His Majesty's Government in 1822 (as part of their refusal to accept Captain Bruce's Treaty), 1825, 1844,1818, 1861,1862, 1866-67,1869, 1901, 1906, 1907, 1908-09, 1923, 1928, 1929, 1933 and 1934. B.—Basis of the Persian Claim. 147. Igno ring contentions such as that the use of the term &lt;£ Persian Gulf ' is a recognition of Persian sovereignty over the various islands of the Gulf, Persia has at one time or other based her claim on the nine grounds examined below (1) History of the Islands prior to 1783. The history of the islands prior to the expulsion of the Persians in 1783 is dealt with in paragraphs 3 to 5 above. It will be seen that at various periods since the beginning of the Christian era, Persia has exercised a degree of control over the islands, and in particular that during the 30 years prior to 1783 her control was of a more definite character. On the other hand, the facts recorded above do not support any claim by Persia to an uninterrupted occupation or control of the islands.39 Persia has on various occasions in the past appealed to the early history of Bahrein in support, of her claim that, it is historically Persian territory. Since 1930, too,, certain Persian newspapers, presumably inspired, have dealt at considerable length with the history of Bahrein in the more or less remote past, and have supported their statements by quotations from, or references to, Arab or Persian geographers or historians. Owing to the absence of records and the shortness of time available, it has been impossible to check these statements in detail, or to conduct elaborate researches into the writings of Arab geographers and others from which further information might be secured. But it is arguable that the position of the islands prior to 1783 is at most only of very indirect importance in the present connection. The essential weakness in the Persian claim is, it is suggested, that there has been no effective exercise of authority in the islands by Persia since her expulsion in 1783, and that the Sheikhs, who originally established themselves by conquest, have now acquired a prescriptive title, based on an uninterrupted occupation of 150 years by the present ruling family. (2) The Absence of Persian Consent to the Detachment of Bahrein from Persia. The Persian Government, in paragraph 2 of their Note of 2nd August 1928 (Appendix B), invited attention to 'the following international juridical principle. . . . A territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot be lawfully detached so long as the right of ownership has not been transferred by this State to another State in virtue of an official act, in this case a treaty, or so long as its annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory.' They added (correctly) that Persia has never renounced her sovereignty or ceded it to another State or ever recognised any of the Sheikhs of Bahrein as independent rulers. The argument put forward by the Persian Government under this head is examined in detail in paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Note despatched by the Foreign Office on 18th February 1929 in reply to the Persian Note of 2nd August 1928 '(Appendix B). His Majesty's Govern ment expressed their inability to agree that any such principle, if alleged to be of universal application, formed part of international law. The deciding factor in the question of international title in cases in which territory has effectively established its independence of the former sovereign is the effective establishment by that territory of its independence, 'and in the case of Bahrein His Majesty's Government regard as wholly untenable the pro position that effective possession and administration by the present ruling family for 145 years, during which these rulers have been independent of Persia and during which no Persian authority has been exercised in their dominions, can be affected by the mere consideration that the Persian Government have not set their signature to a document formally recognising the fact of their independence.' In paragraph 7 of the same Note His Majesty's Government, cite historical precedents to show that the theory of the necessity for the formal consent of the dispossessed State is not one which has ever obtained international acceptance. (3) The Unratified Treaty of 1^22. The circumstances in which the Treaty oi 1822 was concluded by Captain Bruce with the representative of the Prince Governor of Shiraz are set out in paragraphs 20-21 above. As will be seen, Captain Bruce concluded it without40 the authority of or reference to Government. The treaty into which he had entered was immediately officially dis avowed, and the Persian Government so informed, and Captain Bruce, as a sign of disapproval of his action, was removed from his appointment. The Persian Government on their side equally disapproved the action of the Prince Governor of Fars in entering into any treaty discussions without the prior approval of the Shah. [The Persian Government were reminded of this in 1825, 1845, 1866, 1907, 1928 and 1929.] It appears impossible in these circum stances to base any legitimate claim to Persian sovereignty over Bahrein on the provisions of the Treaty of 1822. (4) The Gold Coin alleged to have been struck at Bahrein in 1817. Please see paragraph 47 above. A Persian Mission appears to have visited Bahrein in 1816 or 1817 (paragraph 9 above) and it is conceivable that a coin might have been struck on that occasion. On the other hand, it would probably be extremely difficult to prove that the coin had not in, fact been struck elsewhere, though with an indication that it had been minted at Bahrein. The incident is in itself of relatively small importance, and it would, it is suggested, be impossible for Persia to use such an incident, even if it could be proved, save in support of arguments of much more sub stantial character. (5) Payment of Feeshkesh, Offerings or Tribute at various Stages by Bahrein to Persia. From paragraph 6 above it will be seen that tribute appears to have been paid by Bahrein to Persia in 1799. The rulers of Bahrein may also have offered to pay tribute in 1839 (paragraph 32) and appear to have offered to do so in 1860 (paragraph 67). In assessing the importance of the payment of tribute in 1799, or, if it then took place, in 1839 or 1860, it is relevant that such payment or promise of payment was immediately followed by the submission of the rulers of Bahrein, in 1800 to Muscat, in 1839 to the Egyptians, and in 1860 to the Turks. In estimating the importance of such payments as evidence of a recognition of Persian suzerainty, the arguments advanced by Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran in bis Despatch No. 28 of March 1845, in which Colonel Sheil remarks that the Chiefs of Bahrein 'had in all probability from time to time given peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute to Persia as a mark of superiority, as Kandahar and Herat still continue to do, without an acknowledgment of subjection '; and the comment thereon of the Secret Com mittee of the East India Company that 'presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, and they have not been confined to Persia' are also relevant. (6) Ftying of the Persian Flag by the Sheikh of Bahrein.. . (a) The Persian flag was hoisted by the Sheikh of Bahrein in 1860. But as will be seen from paragraph 67 above, hardly had it been hoisted when, on the arrival of a Turkish emissary, it was lowered and the Turkish flag hoisted in its place. At a later stage in 1860-61 the Persian and Turkish Hags were apparently flown side by side by the Sheikh. It appears difficult in these circumstances to base any substantial argument on the incident. (b) The Notes addressed by the Persian envoy in London to the Foreign Office in February 1869 alleged that the Persian flag had been hoisted by Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah and that the Resident had in September 1868 bombarded the41 Sheikh s palace on which the flag was flying. There appears to be no foundation for the suggestion that the Persian fla^ was flymg when the Resident reached Bahrein or that it wat fired on (see paragraph 80). If previously hoisted it had, br the time of the Resident s arrival, been hauled down. (c) In the undated letters from Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah communicated to the Foreign Office by the Persian envoy in April 1869, the Sheikh stated that he was hoisting the flag of the Lion and bun over Bahrein. [f, as seems probable from internal evidence, these letters date from the period of the abortive Persian Mission to Bahrein of 1860-61, it is relevant in assessing their importance that immediately after the reception of the Persian envoy, a Turkish envoy was received, the Persian flag hauled down and the Turkish flag substituted, and that in the early part of 1861 the flags of Persia and Turkey appear to have been flying side by side on the forts at Bahrein. There is nothing to show that either flag flew in Bahrein between the conclusion of the Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70) and 1868. (d) In September 1869 the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah attacked the islands, and with the assistance of Sheikh Md. bin Abdulla killed the ruling Sheikh Ali. The Persian flag may have been hoisted on this occasion. But there is no reference to this in the detailed reports of the capture of the islands by Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah and Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah, or of the operations as the result of which those Sheikhs were reduced at the end of 1869. (Enclosure to Government of India's Despatch No, 7 of 25th January 1870 ; Resident's Despatches of 11th September, 25th September, and 5th October 1869.) (7) Letters from past Rulers of Bahrein admitting Persian Suzerainty. It is by no means improbable that in 1799, 1816-17, and 1839 the rulers of Bahrein addressed letters to the Persian Government acknowledging Persian suzerainty over the island, and they appear certainly^to have done so in 1860. But the only letters the text of which has ever been communicated to Her Majesty's Government are the two letters communicated by the Persian envoy in London in 1869. Those letters indeed categorically acknowledge Persian suzerainty over Bahrein, and state that it has been uninter ruptedly exercised in the past. But they appear to date from 1860, and the submission of Bahrein to Turkey and the hauling down of the Persian flag in the same year are, it is suggested, material in assessing the weight to be attached to them., (8) Declarations made hy Her Majesty 9 s Government to the Persian Minister in London, April 1869. {a) These declarations are examined in paragraph 98 above. The text of the Note addressed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Persian envoy on 29tli April 1869, on which the subsequent Persian claims have to a considerable extent been based, is given in paragraph 85 above. The wording of that Note, and the general attitude adopted by Her Majesty's Government, as evidenced by their acquiescence in the despatch of a mission to Bahrein by Persia, undoubtedly afforded Persia justification for the inferences she appears to have drawn. But, as pointed out in paragraph 10 of the Note addressed to the Persian Minister on 18th February 1929 and reproduced in Appendix B, the Note in question, while very loosely expressed, was 2953 Jj42 never intended to bear the interpretation now placed upon it by the Persian Government (cp. in this connection para graphs 102 and 110 above), and in stating that due consideration had been given in the past by Her Majesty s Government to the Persian claim it did not in any way admit that that claim was valid. The Note, indeed, con firmed the intention of the British Government to continue to hold the Sheikhs to the treaty engagements which had been entered into with them as independent rulers. (b) The undertaking given by Her Majesty's Government in the same correspondence to communicate in future with Persia before undertaking punitive action against the rulers of Bahrein is 'prima facie consistent with a recognition by Her Majesty's Government of Persian claims to that island. But it appears, however, in fact to have been no more than a courteous indication by His Majesty's Government of their desire to pay the fullest possible attention to any Persian claims. It will be observed that the first (and apparently the only) communication made to the Persian Government in discharge of this understanding, intimated to that Government the intention of Her Majesty's Government to proceed at once against the ' Chief now in possession of Bahrein ' consequent on his breach of the maritime peace and his attack on the Sheikh who had been placed in power at Bahrein by the British Government. (9) Closeness of Relations at the present Day between Persia and Bahrein. The Sheikhs of Bahrein are strongly opposed to any recognition of Persian suzerainty (cp. paragraph 139). The Persian suggestion that relations are at the present time closer between Persia and Bahrein than between Bahrein and any other independent civilised State is without founda tion. Relations are at least equally close with Saudi Arabia, and the closest relations are maintained in addition with Great Britain and with British India. The Terms of the Treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 between the British Government and Persia. 148. In addition to the nine arguments examined above, Persia has on more than one occasion appealed to the provisions of her treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 with the British Government in connection with her claim to Bahrein. Her appeal is based substantially on the fact that those treaties provide in certain circumstances for the evacuation of Persian territory occupied by British troops. The relevant passages of the treaties are as follows:— Aitch. XIII, (i) By the preliminary Treaty of 1809 between His No. vj 53. ' Majesty's Government and Persia, the Persian Government undertook not to ' permit any European force whatever to pass through Persia either towards India or towards the ports of that country'; while His Majesty's Government undertook ' in case any European forces have invaded or shall invade the territories of His Majesty the King of Persia ' to ' afford to His Majesty the King of Persia a force, or in lieu of it a subsidy, with warlike ammunition . . . and officers. ...' Article 5 of the same treaty provided ; ' If a detachment of British troops has arrived from India in the Gulf of Persia and, by the consent of His Persian Majesty, landed on the island of Karak or any of the Persian ports, they shall not in any manner possess themselves of such places, and from the date of these preliminary articles the said detachment shall43 be at the disposal of His Majesty the King of Persia, the amount of which shall be settled in the definitive treaty.' Article 6 provided that ' If the said troops remain by the desire of His Majesty the King of Persia either at Karak or at any other port in the Gulf of Persia ' they shall be treated in a friendly manner by the Governor and arrange ments made for the supply to them of provisions, &amp;c. at fair pflCGS. His Aitch. XIII No. vii, 60. (ii) Treaty of 1814.—Article (2) provides that ' Britannic Majesty further engages not to interfere in any dispute which may hereafter arise between the Princes, noble men and great chiefs of Persia, and if one of the contending parties should even offer a Province of Persia with a view to obtaining assistance, the English Government shall not agree to such proposal, nor by adopting it possess themselves of such part of Persia.' Article 11 provided that ' Should His Persian Majesty Aitcli. Xlll, require assistance from the English Grovernment in the No. xviii, 81. Persian Gulf, they shall, if convenient and practicable, assist him with ships of war and troops. The expenses of such expedition shall be accounted for and defrayed by the Persian Government, and the above ships shall anchor in such ports as shall be pointed out by the Persian Government and not at other harbours without permission, except from absolute necessity.' (iii) ^ ii© treaty of Peace of 4th March 1857, drawn up on the conclusion of the war between Persia and Great Britain, provided that ' Peace being happily concluded between Their said Majesties, it is hereby agreed that the forces of H.M. the Queen shall evacuate Persian territory, subject to the conditions and stipulations hereafter specified ' (z\rt. 2), and that 44 immediately on the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty the British troops will desist from all acts of hostility against Persia, and the British Government engages further that as soon as the stipulations in regard to evacua tion by the Persian troops of the Herat and Afghan territories as well as in regard to the reception of the British Mission at Tehran shall have been carried into full effect, the British troops shall without delay be withdrawn from all ports, places and islands belonging to Persia. . . .' If Bahrein were Persian territory and if it had been occupied by British forces at the times envisaged by the treaty provisions to which appeal is made by Persia, there might be some force in the Persian argument, though even then His Majesty's Government might claim that the fact that their actual relations with Bahrein had in no way been affected by the provisions of those treaties, and that Persia had made no protest at the time against any failure to implement those provisions clearly showed that Persia had accepted in the past the fact that Bahrein fell outside her territorial limits. In fact, neither in 1809, 1814 nor in 1857 was there any British occupation of Bahrein; while His Majesty's Government, never having admitted Persian sovereignty over Bahrein or regarded Bahrein as an integral part of Persia, have in the past adopted the attitude that the terms of the treaties referred to above are irrelevant for the present purpose. As stated by His Majesty s Government in 190f&gt; in reply to^a Persian Note which based the Persian claim upon the provisions of those treaties, the treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 on this subject have always been scrupulously observed by His Majesty s Government, but have no bearing on the present question. His Majesty s44 Government liave never admitted the ownership or sove reignty of Persia over Bahrein. Such a claim is in their view entirely inadmissible. Review of the Persian Claim. 149. It is relevant in the first place that from 1847 to 1913 the Turkish claim to Bahrein was pressed with at least equal vigour to the Persian claim, and that through much of that period the Turkish claim had a stronger practical justification than can be claimed by Persia since a period long prior to 1783, in that Turkey was the suzerain of the adjoining continental littoral of Arabia and held or preferred claims to both sides of the Gulf ^ by which Bahrein is enfolded. Moreover, Muscat, which in the early part of the 19th century on more than one occasion established a temporary control over Bahrein and drew tribute from it, was deterred from urging its claims by force from 1829 onwards only by the attitude of His Majesty's Government, while the Wahahi Amirs brought effective pressure to bear on Bahrein and drew tribute from it, though latterly probably in respect only of Bahreini possessions on the mainland, at frequent intervals through the early ^ part ^ of the 19th century, and desisted only with their subjugation by Turkey in 1870. Persia, in other words, was up to 1913 one only of the claimants to Bahrein, and through much of the period 1847 to 1913 if anything a less insistent and to some extent a less plausible claimant than Turkey. 150. These considerations, however, apart, the general effect of a review of the history of Bahrein over the last 150 years and of an examination of the specific arguments put forward by Persia and referred to in paragraphs 147—8 above is to suggest that there is no solid basis for a Persian claim to suzerainty or sovereignty over the islands. The geographical remoteness of the islands from Persia, and theact that their population is Arab are admittedly not decisive arguments. The real weakness in the Persian claim appears to be that there has been no effective exercise of Persian authority in the islands since the expulsion of Perbia by the ancestors of the present ruling house in 1783. Such incidents as the momentary hoisting of the Persian flag in 1860, its flying side by side with the Turkish flag m 1860-01, or the temporary tender of allegiance to Persia in 1/99, 1816-17 and 1839 must be considered in relation to the history of the islands as a whole, in the period now under consideration, and in particular to the consistent claim of Turkey between 1847 and 1913 and to the absence of any sequel to such momentary acknowledgment of or appeals to Persian power; and they cannot carry the weight of a long dealing extending over a course of years. The remarks of the Government of India in 1870, quoted in paragraph 97 above, are relevant in this connection, as are the observa tions in paragraph 8 of the British Note to Persia of 18th February 1929. It may be added, too, that during the period from 1783 Bahrein has at various dates been in a position to enter into treaty engagements or discussions with neighbouring States such as Muscat (paragraph 26), Turkey (paragraph 103), the Egyptian Viceroy, Mehemet Ali (paragraph 34) and His Majesty's Government on a basis inconsistent with her being at the time subject toJPersian jurisdiction. A further point of some importance is the absence, so far as available records show, of any reference to Persia by the Sheikhs of Bahrein, at any date since the conquest of Bahrein by the ancestors of the present rulers in 1783, on the occasion ofmamam 45 their accession, or of any formal acknowledgment by Bahrein on such occasions of sovereignty or suzerainty such as might be expected from a Sheikh who regarded himself as a vassal of 1 ersia Nor does any protest at the absence of any such formal acknowledgment appear at any time to have been made by rersia. 151. The correspondence 00869-70, to which particular attention has been paid by Persia in the past, and which mav be thought the strongest contention that Persia is in a position to put forward, may indeed be quoted as evidence of the view taken by Her Majesty's Government at that period of the ielation of Persia to Bahrein. But it cannot be valid as against the Sheikhs, and while it is sufficiently looselv expressed to afford some justification for the construction which has been placed on it by Persia, it is relevant that the construction placed on it by Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, and supported by the Government of India, passed without challenge in 1871 (paragraph 102); ■that^ a similar interpretation was placed on it, with a minimum of preliminary discussion, in 1886 (paragraph 110); that at frequent intervals between 1870 and 1880 His Majesty's Government maintained the independence of Bahrein against Turkey (paragraphs 99-107 above); that so early as January 1870 they drew the attention of the Turkish Government to the British Note of 1851 (para graph 61 above); and that His Majesty's Government have uninterruptedly maintained the independence of Bahrein against Persia and Turkey alike since the date of the correspondence in question. 152. The Sheikhs themselves appear, particularly in the early part of the past century, before their relations with Her Majesty's Government were placed on a more definite footing by the Agreements of 1880 and 1892, to have been guided by a consideration of their own immediate interests in deciding on the line of policy to be adopted towards the stronger rulers by whom they were surrounded. But not only is it now almost three-quarters oE a century since any appeal, however flimsy, appears to have been made to Persia by Bahrein, but the present Sheikh (like his predecessor) is keenly apprehensive of any recognition of the Persian claim, to which he is most strongly opposed. C.—Attitude of British Government, 1820-1934. 153. From 1820 onwards His Majesty's Government consistently dealt with the Sheikhs as independent rulers. They concluded treaties with them on that basis in 1820, 1847, 1861, 1868, 1880 and 1892, and they have been prepared to maintain their independence by diplomatic, or on occasion by forcible methods against challenge from outside, whether from Persia, Turkey, Egypt or the Wahabis. They originally entered into relations ^ with the Sheikhs and promised them a measure of protection ^para graph 16) in the interests of securing the peace of the Persian Gulf. In the early stages of those relations ihey appear to have been solely concerned to achieve this object (m 1820 they even offered their mediation, which was, however, not accepted by Persia, to secure the payment of tribute to Persia by the Sheikhs), and they fnter- ference with the internal affairs of the Sheikhdom to the minimum required to secure the interests of British subjects. They were consistent!}' reluctant to establis a pio e o c over Bahrein in view of the probabk local . e ™bamssments in regulating the succession, &amp;c., m which this^mi 0 ht 295346 involve them, and in 1849 they formally declined a request 'by the Sheikh that he and the islands should be taken under British x^rotection. In 1861 (paragraph 70) they gave the Sheikhs more categorical guarantees of protection in return for more binding undertakings. Their corre spondence with the Persian Minister in London in 1869--/0 shows the Home Government, however, still ready at tnat date to adopt the attitude that if any other Power would discharge the objects which had led Great Britain to undertake certain responsibilities in relation to Bahrein, she would gladly see them do so. Closer relations with the Sheikh and closer control over his freedom of action were established for the first time by the Exclusive Agree ment of 1880. Relations became closer still with _ the conclusion of the Exclusive Agreement of 1892. Since that date the position of Bahrein, though His Majesty's Government make no claim to sovereignty, though the Sheikhdom continues to be regarded as independent from the international standpoint, and though the Sheikhs enjoy a very large measure of internal autonomy, has tended increasingly to approximate to that of a State under British protection.
