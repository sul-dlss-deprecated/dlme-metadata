Mr. Genl.’s Department; Simla, 20th May 1894. i i E. E. H. McS. G. H. M.-M.THE DEVELOPMENT OP THE MILITARY STRENGTH OP TURKEY. Extract from the “ Internationale Revue” for November 1893. The writer begins by saying that French, English, and German periodicals are in the habit of decrying the armed strength of Turkey, representing it as being in an absolute state of stagnation, and that they are too apt to imagine that all so-called reforms are but paper schemes, still safely reposing in the sick man’s pigeon holes. This may be attributed to political action, but nevertheless it is calculated to create very erroneous impressions : he maintains that the true state of affairs is in reality very different, and, in the interests of the Triple Alliance, should be carefully examined. He has lived for ten years in Turkey, and is prepared to refute all the recent severe and unjust criticisms; he maintains that the armed strength of Turkey has been remodelled on modern lines in spite of financial difficulties and strain ed political relations. He represents Goltz Pasha, who has renewed his con tract with the Sultan for a further term of three years, as pledged to the carrying through of this reform, and deals with several projects which have either lately undergone further changes, or which so far have not been brought to notice. The Artillery Reorganisation Programme of 1886-87 (giving each of the first 6 Ordus six regiments and three horse batteries, as well as providing artillery for the Redif Corps), and the creation of the llamidie Cavalry, have actually been carried out. Details of the Artillery reorganisation have been previously submitted to our readers; but, before touching upon the cavalry question, we must first des cribe the subdivision of the empire into territorial zones, an accomplished fact which many journals refuse to believe in. This territorial system actually exists in the 4th, 5th, and 6th Corps (Erzerum, Damascus, Bagdad), and will now be introduced in the Ordu Dis tricts 1, 2, and 3 (i.e., Constantinople, Adrianople, and Monastir). The 7th Corps Yemen and the independent divisions of Hejaz, Tripoli, and Crete contain, as is well known, only “ Muwazzaf,” or active troops :— Yemen and the recently occupied important 35 Battalions. territory of Sad-a. 2 Squadrons. 3 Field Batteries. 10 Mountain Batteries. Hejaz 12 Battalions. 1 Squadron. 2 Batteries. Tripoli 17 Battalions. 10 Squadrons. 4 Field Batteries. 2 Mountain Batteries. Crete ... ... ... ... 13 Battalions. 2 Squadrons. 3 Field Batteries. 3 Mountain Batteries,2 While on the subject of Yemen, we wish to draw attention to the able and decisive manner in which the recent disturbances vvere quelled, and a hitherto unknown state of peace and safety established in contradistinction to the highly colored and caricatured accounts which were so freely circulated by the Press critics. Instead of reco-nisin* the difficulties which a country like this has had to contend with in introducing a total reform of its military system and giving it credit for a certain amount of vital force, the Press has always pieferred to depict it as quivering in its death agony, and regarded its dissolution as an event of the near future We ask the critics to note the fact that the Army Estimates have been increased by GO per cent, since the vai of P / / -/b, and that they now absorb 47 per cent, of the total revenue. Ihenew TVar Minister and the Grand Master of the Artillery indeed have been able to effect a saying of 50 per cent, in their respective Departments : yet the War budget still s ands at 6 million, the Artillery at 1 million, and the Gendarmerie at 1 1 million pounds. It was necessary to proceed step by step with the new reforms : before the division of the Ersatz Districts could be proceeded with on any uniform plan, the statistics of the population had to he compiled. There were difficulties to bo contended with in the matter of the selection ot the head-quarters of the Redif Battalions and the Store Depots, and the inequality of the population in several districts which heretofore had been called upon to furnish equal contingents (such as Sivas with 32,000 inhabitants and Van with only &lt;-,000). This distribution has now been more equally arranged even m Urdu JNo. b (Bagdad), where the difficulties were very great. Now there are in each or t ie first 6 Ordus— 8 Brigade 16 Regimental y districts for the Redif. I 64 Battalion J Each Battalion district furnishes one battalion of Redif and each Brigade district the reserve (Ersatz) for one active Infantry Regiment. The number of the Redif Battalions has not been increased, but only the augmentation staffs and departments, thereby greatly facilitating the reinforcement and mobilisation of the army. Each Redif Battalion district lias its Commandant, Adjutant, and neces sary staff of writers; its personnel for the arms and clothing magazines for the Redif which it is intended to call up, and in part also for the Mustahfiz (Lands- turm), and, in addition, weak cadres of officers for the four company districts, and also non-commissioned officers who will in addition undertake the instruction of the ” Mninsiz ” (who are not available in peace time) on Sundays. That all this is actually carried out is due to the great personal interest taken by^ the Sultan, to the energy and circumspection of Riza Pasha the A\ ar Minister, who deserves the greatest credit for the way in which he has pushed on all these reforms, the care he has bestowed on the amelioration of the condition of the officers and the question of armament, as well as to the energy of Zeki Pasha, the Grand Master of Artillery, who has concerned himself with the military schools and the whole system of issues to the forces in addition to the questions affecting his own branch of the service. The number of battalions to he raised can easily he determined from the number of Battalion districts: each Ordu furnishes 64 Redif Battalions, or 12 Redif Corps, and we have no doubt as to the possibility of raising them, for there are plenty of men in the 8 Ptedif classes available. The Mustahfiz Corps will however take longer to organise as the neces sary quota of qualified officers is not yet forthcoming. Now that the territorial system has been inaugurated, the mobilisation arrangements, wbicb have long since been worked out, can be brought into operation: the statistics relating to the capabilities of each district to furnish the Ihtiat (the active Reserve) and the Redif (1st Reserve Troops or Landwehr)3 Lave been received in Constantinople some time back ; but although several slight alterations in the actual definition of the boundaries of the districts may even tually be necessary, this will in no way interfere with the main principles being vigorously carried out. Several papers have asserted that no Turkish manoeuvres ever take place. We have been present at the manoeuvres of two forces operating against each other in the II Ordu, and at garrison manoeuvres against a marked enemy in the I Ordu, and have in addition heard the searching criticisms of competent judges on similar operations in the III Ordu. There is nothing particular to remark upon in the tours of the general staff under Goltz Pasha or of those under the different corps commanders. Another important question which has recently been decided is the arma ment of the forces. The Mauser rifle has been selected. Of 500,000 of the 9'5 millemetre ordered in 18S7, up to 1889, 220,000 rifles and 6,000 carbines had been re- 1 millemetre = ’0395 inches. . ■ , ceived. Of the 230,000 7‘G mm. rifles ordered in 1889, some 60,000 are still to come. The 44,000 carbines ordered were still undelivered when the new contract with Mauser for 156,000 rifles was concluded, and it was then decided to have 44,000 rifles substituted for the carbines. So that on completion of the contract there will be-— 280,000 156,000 44,000 480,000 Mauser rifles, 7‘6 mm. and 220,000 „ „ 9'5 mm. There is no doubt whatever that the number of small bore rifles must be greatly increased so as to provide a reserve stock for the field army. Regard ing the conversion of the 9 5 mm. (•374') to the 7'G mm. (-299), it is intended that this shall he done as far as possible at Constantinople itself, and that the cartridge factory shall also he located there. As far as the cavalry are concerned, we have heard from the War Depart ment that there is no foundation for the recent rumour to the effect that they wifl be armed with the Kragh-Jorgensen carbine. Our readers are aware that 72 field howitzers were ordered from Krupp on Grumkoff Pasha’s recommendation, and accordingly each of the six Muwazzaf Corps of the first six Ordus will be armed with them in the proportion of two batteries of six guns each. Rather less than two years ago the question of raising the Ilamidie Cavalry was regarded with derision. It has since made rapid strides towards becoming an accomplished fact, for Ilamidie Regiments have been raised from among the Arab tribes in spite of the assurances of experts on Oriental questions, who insisted that they would no more submit to universal service than the tribes of the Red Sea littoral (and these latter alone have already furnished volun teers sufficient to form 4 Zouave Battalions). On the 1st January 1893, there were 40 regiments of this Militia Cavalry, to-day there are 55 regiments, with 229 squadrons of an average strength of 150 horses; total horses 34,500. It is intended to gradually increase the number of these regiments up to 100. This will then make it possible to increase the 198 regular squadrons up to three times their strength.4 These irregular horsemen may fairly he compared with the Cossacks for capability to endure fatigue, and as to their methods of service and tactical formations ; they are all born riders,—these r Iurks, Kurds, Arabs, Kara-Papaks, as well as those Tscherkess tribes which come into the computation ; they are splendid fighting material, and will cost the State next to nothing : their value, however, will increase with their notions ol discipline. By considering the peculiarities of eacli tribe, by handing oyer to them the formation of the regimental establishments, by naming the regiments after ^ ^ ^ their own chiefs—emphasising, however, the duty which each tribe owes in the ra e &gt; r • shape of military service—the Sultan has defined the main outlines of this ' creation, and a study of them will convince the severest critic that he has gone the right way about it. \ Mixed regiments are forbidden : regiments will be formed from a single class, or, if a whole regiment cannot be raised, one or two squadrons will be furnished. The strength of the regiments will vary from 4 to 6 squadrons of from 128 to 192, horses, and from 512 to 1,152 men. The llamidie Cavalry will be organised in brigades under a “ Liwa ” of the Liwa-Brigadier- regular army, whilst the command of the whole will be exercised by a“ Perik.” General - Duration of military service, 17th —40th year of age. Becruit class ... 17th—20th year. Regular Nizam class ... 20th—32nd „ Reserve class ... 32nd—40th „ They take the oath of allegiance to their chief on entering each class. The recruits will be drilled for at least three months every year in their own stations, the main object being to accustom them to discipline and military life. The Nizam are drilled yearly, and every three years have extensive man oeuvres. The reservists, on the other hand, are only called out in peace under exceptional circumstances. Whilst the Recruit and Nizam class can only leave the territory of their tribe with permission, the Reservists are free to go where they will, with the proviso, however, that they notify each change of abode. Every three years the llamidie Regiments will be concentrated outside their own stations for a series of manoeuvres extending over two months, the dura tion of which will be intimated in orders. The Regimental commander fixes the day for assembly ; the men present themselves equipped and mounted; they receive arms, ammunition, and standards from the “ Redif ’* depots. These large scale manoeuvres w r ill include evolutions by large bodies working over open country, and dismounted duties: the General Commanding the whole llamidie Cavalry will make his inspections at this time. The men equip and clothe themselves : those of the 1st and 2nd class must regularly maintain a suitable horse: the 3rd (Reservists) are only obliged to bring a horse fit for service when called out for concentration or war. The style of dress will be in conformity with the custom of the tribe: three different patterns are permissible, but the regimental number w ill bo worn. From the time that the men leave their tribal stations for concentration or manoeuvres, they will receive full pay and rations : in their own stations they get only a proportion of the pay and a gratuity. The Brigade and Regimental Commanders (and at first the greater propor tion of the regimental ofiieers) will be appointed from the regular cavalry: eventually, however, Lieutenant-Colonels, Majors, Captains, and Subalterns will, as far as possible, be chosen from amongst the leading men of the tribe. If they prove themselves especially fitted for it, officers from the tribes will be permitted to command regiments later on, provided they fulfil the following conditions:— They must he present at all drills and exercises, and serve for three years in a regular regiment and prove themselves thoroughly qualified for the command. They will then receive the pay of regular officers and be given the preference for the appointment.5 Art. 174. \ ■ Brigadier- Ncltive subalterns are promoted from the ranks or posted to regiments from the military schools. Prom each regiment two suitable men of good character will be sent to the model or training regiment for six months; they will then be attached to a regiment in the capital of the Empire for a further period of two years (or posted to a miltary school), and at the expiration of this time may be posted as Lieutenants under the orders of the Regimental Chiefs. Besides these such a number of suitable young men shall be selected from each tribe that there may be one to each regiment; these will be sent to the Cavalry school at Constantinople, and on passing the examination for Lieutenants shall receive their commissions. Thus in this way it is intended to fill most of the officers’ vacancies, but should the numbers so obtained fall short of the requirements, ^on-Com- missioned Officers will be promoted. Those officers who have passed through the schools will receive pay like the rest of the army. Promotion shall go in the tribe on vacancies occurring, but the Imperial Government reserves the right of filling them with regular officers, if qualified and suitable men are not forthcoming. Native officers take the oath of allegiance to the Sultan on each promotion. We consider the raising of the Uamidie Cavalry to have been a most for tunate step, and think that the measures adopted will soon attain the desired end, more especially since they so fully recognise the tribal peculiarities of the people. When the necessary discipline has been infused, enormous masses of serviceable cavalry will have been added to the Osmanli ranks at a compara tively small cost. Endeavours are, moreover, being made to utilise the horse-keeping races for the benefit of the rest of the army, and the State is providing a good class of stallion gratis. The Sultan has been particularly active in dictating special measures for the prevention of cholera, and under the eye of the new War Ministry the pay of the troops is now regularly disbursed, and the condition of the Subaltern officers considerably improved. Thus it cannot be said that the development of the armed strength of Turkey slumbers; for it is well known to all that the Government intends to push it forward as fast as financial considerations will permit of its being done. This is, moreover, further proved by the attention which is being given to roads and communications. In addition to those Railways which we have had occasion to notice in former issues, the following are in course of construction, viz :— Salonika-Monastir, Beyrouth- Damascus, Eski Slier-Konia, and there are also a number of good roads being made. What has been accomplished deserves recognition, not unjust criticism. O. d. O. In contradistinction to the foregoing, I append the following extracts from the Beichswehr on the subject of the incompleteness of existing Turkish military preparations. 0. B.*S.6 Extract from “Die Reichswehr,” dated 11th February 1894. From an article on Captain A. Liposcak’s lecture at Vienna the other day- dealing with the armed strengths of the Balkan States, we take the following extract relating to Turkey :— Exclusive of the Asiatic Provinces, Turkey has five corps of the 1st line always at disposal, viz., those at Constantinople, Adrianople, Monastir, Erzin- ghian, and Damascus,— representing a strength of— 170 Battalions ^ 220,000 men. 150 Squadrons 20,000 horsemen. 130 Batteries J 600 guns. Of these, 125 battalions, 98 squadrons, and 118 batteries are already distributed (dislocated) in European territories, and in a comparatively short time could be reinforced by 56 supplementary lledif Battalions of the 2nd line. The armament is at present very unsatisfactory owing to vacillation and indecision in choosing a rifle of the repeating class The regulars are still armed with the Henry-Martini, whilst the whole of the repeating rifles (new small bore) lie uselessly in the depots at Constantinople. The lecturer says that no real theoretical and practical training for officers exists, and that the question of the leading of the army is a serious one. He also deals with the system of fortification and defences of the Empire, particularly with reference to the recently suggested possibility of a direct Russian attack on Constantinople. Die Reichswehr, dated 21st March 1894. This paper’s regular Turkish correspondent, “ Hassan Ahmad,’* writes as follows from Constantinople on the 11th February 1894:— Although exact and reliable details of the “dislocation” of the Turkish army are next to impossible to procure, still we are now able to give a revised table of the distribution of the troops, showing some slight changes to that published in our number dated the 10th April 1893 :—• In the Ordu (Corps, Division) departments of— Lino Infantry Battalions. Lino Cavalry Squadrons. Horse Batteries. Mountain Batteries. Field Batteries.

Total 282 197 18 48 159Of the Mauser rifles (7'G5 m.m.) up to date, about 280,000 have beer received; and 200,000 yet to come : (delivery of these suspended). Of the 9-5 m.m., as is well-known, there are 220,000 rifles to hand. However, since neither the troops nor the schools have yet had a single rifle served out to them, these long years spent in the acquirement of a magazine rifle at a great sacrifice have benefitted Turkey but little. There are about 93J million cartridges for the 9-5 m. m. rifle available, and about 25 million for the 7*65 m. m. rifle, with another 25 million to come. The arming of the 15 new forts which comprise the entrenched Camp of Erzerum is fixed at— 1G3 guns of 24, 18, 15, 12, and 9 c.m. calibre. 116 mortars of large calibre. 69 mitrailleuses (machine guns ?) This armament has not yet been ordered, but authentic information from Erzerum makes out that 13 forts are 110w armed ! presumably* with old ord- e. f. h. Mcs. nance and Krupp Guns of small calibre, for Krupp has delivered no consignment of late which would coincide with the above mentioned scheme. The zeal with which endeavours were made some years ago to improve horse-breeding has distinctly abated during the past year. Muzaffer Pasha, Principal Director of the Government Stud at Erussa, was to have gone to Asia Minor last spring with the object of establishing further studs and breeding establishments ; his departure, however, has always been put off, and he is still waiting for his travelling orders. In the meantime the 'dearth of cavalry and artillery horses is daily increasing. Einancial difficulties preclude all idea of a large order for horses being sent to Hungary. The “ Schwimmer ” Company at Temesvar have only 36 rejected cavalry horses now to deliver (but will add 90 more in order to make up the railway trucks) at an average cost of 24f pounds. The Turks seem to be relegating v. der Goltz Pasha to such continual inactivity in spite of the conditions of his last contract that it is highly probable that he will finally press for the acceptance of his resignation. ******* OFFLEY SHORE, Captain, The 19th May 1894. 18th Bengal Lancers.
