Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that my attention has recently heen drawn to two cases in which ships of the Imperial Iranian Navy have interfered with Arab vessels within Arab territorial waters. 2. The first incident took place on the 25th January (5th Bahman). On that date H.I.M.S. 'Babr' stopped and searched two dhows belonging to Debai. The first dhow was searched two miles North East of Q,uoin Island, and the second one mile from Quoin Island. Both dhows were therefore stopped within the territorial waters of the Sultan of Muscat. The first dhow is the property of Muhammad Khan of Debai, and its Nakhuda is named Ahmed Ali Harmuzi. The second belongs to a relative of Muhammad Khan and its Nakhuda is Hasan Tahlak. The two dhows carried passengers and cargoes of salt, dates and clothing for the Batineh coast. The cargoes of both dhows were searched, being prodded with a steel prong, and the baggage and clothing of the passengers and crews were also searched. After completion of the search, the dhows were allowed to proceed. 3. The second incident took place on the 16th February (27th Bahman). On that date an unnamed jolly-boat, belonging to Debai, sailed from Khassab to Debai with a cargo of dried fish. The jollyboat is the property of Humail bin Khalfan al Basti of Debai, and the Nakhuda is named Ali bin Hasan ash-Shahi of Khassab. At about noon on the 16th February (27th Bahman) an Iranian warship was sighted coming from the direction of Henjam. The name of His Excellency, Monsieur Enayatollah Samiy, Minister for Foreign Affairs TEHRAN. this/this warship is not known, but it is believed that she was H.I.M.S. 'Chahrokh”. When the jolly-boat was off Ghamda (between Bekha and Sha’am) she was overtaken by the warship, which stopped a few yards distant from her. Both vessels were then about one mile from the shore. The Nakhuda was ordered to go aboard the warship, where he was questioned about the nationality of his boat, himself and his crew. He was then allowed to proceed. 4. Your Excellency will observe that in both these cases, Arab vessels from Debai were stopped by Iranian warships actually within Arab territorial waters. In these circumstances I must make to Your Excellency a strong protest at these further cases of interference with Arab vessels outside Iranian territorial waters. In my note No.112 of the 11th March (20th Esfand 1315) I had the honour to remind Your Excellency that incidents of this nature could not but make a most unfortunate impression. I have no doubt that His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India will view these further incidents with much concern, and I would therefore again earnestly request Your Excellency, in the interests of the friendly relations so happily existing between those Governments and the Imperial Government, to cause strict instructions to be issued to the Commanding Officers of His Imperial Majesty's ships to abstain from interference with Arab vessels outside Iranian territorial waters. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration. (Signed) H. J. Seymour.. .1. (K 2009/1^69/91J Kc ^89/2/'37 . GO, Y.

The action which we proposed to take is stated in 675/17/36, a telegram to Bushire dr ted December 18th 1936. *e deferred action pending confirmation from Bushire that the crew of the dhow were Muscati subjects* No reply nrs ever been received from Bushire *nd we have side nothing to the Iranian Government. This case started badly with jor Lincoln’s absurd delay over reporting, and it has remained slightly ridiculous. It seems rather doubtful if we can do anything now. 3. The seizure of the Koweiti dhow which was to smuggle silk into India. The dhow was seized off ^Ihassab on the 25th January and released on the 28th February, 16 pieces of silk being missing. We protested in our note No.260/26/37 handed to Samiy by His Majesty’s Minister on the 16th March. 4. The case of the three Debei dhows which were sailing to the Bat inch coast *nd 2 of which were searched near the quoins also on January 25th. They were not detained.

I beg to enclose a letter (with translation) in original dated the 13th Dhul Hijjah l3bo (24th February 1937) from the Shaikh of Dubai to me* 2. The j ollyboat interfered with by the Persian man-of- war belongs to numaid bin Khalfan al Basti oi D^bai while the nakhuda ’Ali bin Hasan ash-Shahi is from Knasab, Muscat. I enquired from the naknuda ^8out the incident and attach a statement giving the details required in such cases. 3. The naknuda states that on Tuesday the 16th Febnary 1937 he left Khasab about the sunrise and at about 12.00 hours he saw a Persian gunboat coming from Henjam direction. That when he reached Ghamdna (between Bakha and Sha’am) tne snip reached him and stopped at a distance of about one mile from the snore. i ne ship stopped few yards away from the jollyboat and asked the naknuda to go alongside the snip and show them a sample of the cargo they had on board. The naicnuda took few fishes with him and went to the ship in his skiff. He was asked (in Arabic) try tne ship’s interpreter, while an Officer was taking notes in his book, about tne nationality of tne boat, naknuda and crew. Tne naknuda replied correctly to all their questions except that he included tne six passengers he had with him from Knasab for Dubai as part of the crew. After examining the naknuda, the Captain asked nim if ne would let him have one of tne dry fishes which the naknuda offered willingly. Tne snip then went towards Has al Khaimah and after an hour was seen going towards the iuorth West.Translation of letter dated I3tn Dnul Hijjan 1355 (i. e« 24th February 1937) from Shaikh Sa 1 id bin Maktum, Ruler of Dubai, to the Residency Agent, Snar j ah, mmmrnm After compliments, I am sending herewith the naknuda and his companion who were interfered with by the Persian ship.

Easier, R.E. Both had a personal interview with the Nakuda in charge of the dhows. Lieut. Hasler has been told to ask the Sheikh to detain the Nakuda if he returns in order that a sloop may proceed at once to investigate further. 2. The answers to question in the Hon. The Political Resident’s Memo. No. 0/143 of 29th March* 1934 are as follows: (l) Date of search is reported to be about 29th January. (2) The two accounts vary as to the locality of the search The Sheikh informed me it took place in the vicinity of the Quoins, while the Tindal stated that it was only one mile from Jezirat al Giianam, or just outside Khor Kuwai. Although the latter is possible, I am inclined to discredit it as neither the caretaker at Khor Kuwai or the Wall of Khassab made any mention of the matter when I saw them since the reported date of search. (3) The names of the three dhows are not known, but they were reported to belong to a sub-contractor of Mespers Limited at Debai. The searching vessel was stated to be the BABR. (4) A11 the dhows came from Debai and were outward bound trading on the Batineh Coast* (5) It is not known if they were flying their flags. (6) No information is available as to what papers were carried. (7) The Nakuda in charge of the three dhows is one Ali Mahomed Saleh from Debai. The crew are reported to be mostly Iranians. One of the passengers is reported to be the son of the Sheikh of Kalat, by name Ahmed bin Abdulla. (8) The cargo consisted of salt, dates and clothing. No other details are available. (9)Date of sailing from Debai is not knownSECRET Page 2. Senior Officer, Persian Gulf's No. S.0.2 of 6th February, 1937. 3. The search took the form of 'prodding” the f cargo with a steel 'prong', while the crews’ and passengers baggage and clothing were searched. This latter procedure is explained by the fact that the searching officer was anxious to know when and why any Iranians present had left Iran. As no man had a 'jawaz' (passport), and all had left several years previously, they were allowed to proceed. 4. On the approach of the BABR it is stated that 600 rounds of anrnunition were jettisoned, these having been purchased in Debai by Ahmed bin Abdulla as a present to his future father-in-law, the Sheikh of Kalba. The latter stated the know nothing about this, the information coming from my other informant. 5. I have asked Lieut. Hasler to inform me at once if the Nakuda returns, and to ask the Sheikh to detain him until a sloop can proceed to investigate. 6. Owing to the differences between the stories of ray two informants, I feel it is difficult to vouch for the accuracy of the above until the Nakuda can be personalj;y interviewed and his account taken in writing.

M Babr ,r stopped and searched two dhows belonging to Debai. The first dhow was searched two miles North last of Cuoin Island,and the second one mile from uoin island* Both dhows were therefore stopped within the territorial waters of the sultan of ; usoat. The first ahow is the property of &amp;UhanM&amp; i han of Debai 9 and its akhuda is named ivhmed All KarmuKi. The second beloiigs to a relative of i^uhammad rhan and its ilakhuda is Hasan Tahlak. The two dhows carried passengers and cargoes cf salt, d^tei and clothing for the Batinch coast* The cargoes of both dhows were searched, being prodded with a steel prong,and the baggage were also searched. After completion of the search,the dhows were allowed to proceed. 2* The second incident too . place on /the His Dtcellency, t onsieur Unayatollah Samiy t 1 inister for Foreign Affairs, TEKRAM.- is - the 16th Fehrutury (£7th Bitiai&amp;n). on that date an mmafned to Debal f Bailed from Eh&amp;ssab to D«bai with a cargo of dried n©h# The ^ollyboat is the property of Jiuiaail bin rhalfan al Basti of Bebal # and the h&amp;khuda is named All bin Hasan ash-Shahi of jrhassab. At about noon on the 16th February (27th Bahman) an Iranian warship was elated * coming from the direction of Henjam. The name of this warship is not known,but it ia believed that she was K.I.M.S. wchahrokh'. When the jolly-boat was off (Jhaada (between Bakha and Sha»am) she wss overt aiven by the war ship, which stopped a few yards distant from her. Both vessels were then about one mile from the shore. The jakhuda was ordered tc go aboard the warship,where he was questioned about the nationality of his boat,himself end his crew. He was then allowed to pr ceed. 4. Your ixcelle icy will observe that in both these cases,Arab vessels from Debai were stopped by Iranian warships actually within Arab territorial waters. In these circumstances I must make to Your Excellency a strong protest at these further cases of interference with Arab vessele outside Iranian territorial waters, in ray not** jIq • 112 of the 11th jgarch (2oth Bsfand 1^15) I had the honour to re ilnd Your ijatoelleney that incidents of this /natur'nature could not Imt make a moat unfort unate impression.

Baggallay Esquire, The Foreign Office, London, S.W.l. i —In view of the number of these cases at present unsettled, a brief summary of them may be useful. Outstanding Dhow Cases 1. The case of the Koweiti dhow 'Suhail”, which was fired on off Lingah on the 12th May 1936, three members Within 3 mile limit. of the crew being wounded. No repl;y has ever been received to our note of protest dated 31/7/36 - paper 582/2/36. Our last reminder is 260/26/37 (the note protesting about the seizure of the silk-smuggling dhow). 2. The case of the Omani dhow which was seized off Within territorial waters as claimed by Iran. Bandar Abbas on 22nd October and released on November 1st, two rifles being retained. The action which we proposed to take is stated in 675/17/36, a telegram to Bushire dated December 18th 1936. We deferred action pending confirmation from Bushire that the crew of the dhow v/ere Muscati subjects. No reply has ever been received from Bushire and we have said nothing to the Iranian Government. This case started badly with Major Lincoln's absurd delay over reporting, and it has remained slightly ridiculous. It seems rather doubtful if we can do anything now. 3. The seizure of the Koweiti dhow which was to smuggle silk into India. The dhow was seized off Khassab on the 25th January and released on the 28th February, 16 pieces of silk being missing. We protested in our note No.260/26/37 handed to Samiy 1 Mile off Arab shore. by His Majesty's Minister on the 16th March. 4. The case of the three Debai dhows which were sailing to the Batineh coast and 2 of which were searched near theMuscat territorial waters. 1 mile from Arab shore; doubtful whether Muscat or Rassalkhaimah waters. Doubtful fS 2 . quoins also on January 25th. They were not detained. Our information is now complete, and we are ready to protest. 257/9/37. 5.

The seizure of the Koweiti dhow which was to smuggle silk into India. The dhow was seized off Khassab on the 25th January and released on the 28th February, 16 pieces of silk being missing. We protested in our note No.260/26/37 handed to Samiy 1 Mile off Arab shore. by His Majesty’s Minister on the 16th March. 4. The case of the three Debai dhows which were sailing to the Batineh coast and 2 of which were searched near the^&lt;3 Muscat territorial waters. quoins also on January 25th. They were not detained. Our information is now complete, and we are ready to protest. 257/9/57. 5. The case of the Behai jolly-boat which was searched 1 mile from Arab shore; doubtful whether Muscat or Rassalkhaimah waters. Doubtful (? by the Ghahrokh) on voyage from Khassab to Debai on the 16th February. Report only just received - protest suggested, linked with 4. 381/1/37. 6.

I think The best plan would be for me to take up the / matter semi-offici&amp;lly, pointing out that che men were obviously not regarded as smugglers and that so far as I know the carriage of. arms in Transit through Iranian waters, as through territorial waters of other couhtries, is in no way a precedent. I would ask for confirmation of latter supposition and if Iranian oovernment oo confirm it, for return of arms to Consulate at Bunder .ibbas for transmission I would conclude with some statement that I do to owners. not wish to raise in this connexion the question of extent of territorial waters. Do you agree? 2. If representations are only semi-official it would seem unnecessary to obtain prior consent of the Sultan of Muscat. But I should be glad of your views and also of definite confirmation that the men are subjects of the Sultan.

In view of release of crew and time which has elapsed you may feel that matter can safely be dropped, particularly if Political Resident considers case has not attracted too much attention on Arab coast. I therefore leave it co your discretion to act as you think fit in light of local circumstances bearing in mind following considerations:- (a) While His Majesty’s Government are entitled to use good offices on behalf of Muscat subjects (which I presume Omanis in question are, and not subjects of a Initial btate) and in practice endeavour to treat Muscat as protected state of same kind as other minor Arab states, they have no treaty giving exclusive rights to conduct Muscat foreign relations. If formal protest were made to the Persian Government it might be desirable to obtain prior authorisation from Sultan in case right to protest were questioned by Persians. (b) I should prefer if possible not to provoke renewed controversy over breadth of territorial waters, but if you make any representations you should reserve general attitude of His Majesty's Government regarding their limits. You may think it desirable in any case to clarify position regarding carriage of small quantities of arms for self-nefence by dhows of this nature, in view of possibility of similar incidents in future. ^ , , n , . .. 10 Addressed to Tehran Wo. 115.

I presume there is clear case for pretest if dhow was outside 12 mile limit but do you wish me to protest if as is probable she was within limits claimed by Iranian Government but outside those recognised by His Majesty’s Government? 7/e cannot hope for satisfaction in latter event but action is perhaps necessary in order to maintain our position over extent of territorial waters. 2. An alternative issue is that of charge brought against crew. There seems to have been no attempt to smuggle and I know of no law declaring illegal the carriage of arms in a foreign ship innocently passing through Iranian waters. There would hardly seem ground for protest while matter is sub judice but I could ask to be informed of exact nature of charge in hope that informal discussion of the case will convince authorities that there are no grounds for prosecution. 3.

But Bushire telegram No. T/71 (of September 20th) shows that extensive search of vessel is alleged to have taken place after her papers (presumably indicating her nationality) had been examined. You should therefore, unless you see objection, add this case to others which Acting Minister for Foreign affairs has undertaken to investigate as result of Basidu incident.

These papers have been discussed with Colonel Fowle. On the whole, since the Omani jolly- boat appears, despite the fact that she produced her papers, which must have made her nationality clear, to have been thoroughly searched, there is, 1 think, as the Admiralty suggest in their letter of 25th September to the Foreign Office, on p.z.6127, sufficiert ground for a protest. Any such protest can quite well be fitted in with the recent representations in regard to the search of Arab dhows, to which so much attention has been drawn in connection with the Basidu incident. If the effect of representations is to show that the Persians are aware of their rights under the Muscat Proclamation of 1898 we shall then at any rate know where we stand on that point and can arrange to have the Proclamation mouified. 2. Colonel Fowle is inclined to think that as regards the Admiralty letter to the India Office of 25th September below, it would be better if we instructed the Hesident to endeavour to arrange that dhows shall fly flags at all times and not merely when they see a warship approaching. The sudden hoisting of a British or Omani flag on the approach of a Persian warship may well arouse the suspicions of the latter. 3.

Since the dho* could readily be recognised as Omani even before she was boarded and since also the Persians not only boarded her but searched her after they had verified her nationality, My Lords are of opinion that adequate grounds for a protest to the Persian Government exist, in view of the statement made to Mr. Mallet on the 26th August in connection with the Basidu incident that ‘'categorical instructions had been sent to the Persian Navy that in future when confronted with an unusual situation of an international kind they were to report lor orders”.

Lear Seal, Many thanks for your letter of yesterday about the Arms Traffic Convention* The proposals which have now been circulated by the Foreign Office for discussion this afternoon seem prima facie attractive (subject to a definition of 'non-Persian vessels' which will cover Bahrein, Koweit, and the other Arab Sheikhdoms to which claims of varying importance are or have been put forward by Persia) and if we can reach agreement on this basis the question of Persian rights of inspection of Arab vessels under the Arms Traffic Convention will no longer be of active importance. But by way of clearing the ground I might place on record our present point of view on certain of the points that have arisen* Position of the Arab Sheikhdoms in relation to treaties and International Conventions* 2* Bahrein and Koweit are independent Arab principalities, under British protection, but not British protectorates* The Trucial Sheikhdoms (including Optar) are, as stated in P.G*13, 'independently administered tribal principalities governed by independent Arab Sheikhs'; entitled to prot-ection from us in varying degrees. By agreement, the foreign relations of all the above are in the hands of His Majesty^ Government, and the Rulers may E.A * Seal Esq., have AIMIRALTY^ have no correspondence or relations with any foreign power or its representative* Muscat is an independent State in special Treaty relations with us, and entitled in certain circumstances to a measure of protection from us, hut with foreign treaties and foreign relation^6f its own. For general political reasons we are anxious to keep the foreign relations of a!3 the above States (including even Muscat so far as practicable) entirely in our own hands; and, save in the case of Muscat, which under pressure from us acceded to the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919, we have therefore never contemplated or wished to encourage, their independent accession to International agreements or conventions. On the other hand, so as to avoid any ground for complaint from interested foreign powers, we aim at securing that in practice these States shall so far as possible (i.e. making allowance for special local circumstances) conform to the provisions of such Conventions as His Majesty’s Government adhere to. But the States are not in fact legally bound in any way by such conventions in the absence of specific adhor^nce either by the Rulers themselves or by His Majesty’s Government on their behalf and with their authority. It is correct in these circumstances to say that the adherence of His Majesty’s Government to an instrument such as the Arms Traffic Convention would not by itself impose any obligation on the Arab principalities of the Persian Gulf. Persian rights of inspection under the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925. 4. The Political Resident advises us that in practice the dhows of all our Arab proteges in the Gulf almost invariablyI I So invarialDly fly some sort of flag, either the Trucial flag, a ,T white-red-halved flag” (cf.H.M.S, Hastings’s letter Uo.965/25 of 6th November 1931), or the flag of Bahrein, Qatar, K owe it or Muscat. On the assumption stated above that the adherence of His Majesty’s Government to an Arms Traffic Convention would not by itself bind the Arab Rulers, the ships of those Rulers flying either the Trucial flag or the flag of Bahrein, Koweit, Muscat or Q.atar, would fall outside Categories (a) and (b) in paragraph 1 of Annexe II, Section 2 Subsection 5 (page 54 of Cmd*3448 of 1929) of the Convention of 1925, and Persia would have no legal right of inspection of such vessels* We have not I fear in our recent discussions sufficiently appreciated that this was the case, and are grateful to the Admiralty for emphasizing it. 5* We feel at the same time in the first place that the 1925 Convention as it stands is so loosely drawn that we might find it difficult in practice to mahe an effective protest against the search by a Persian vessel of an Arab dhow flying the flag of an Arab principality which was not a party to theConvention* Secondly, and this is the argument which has carried most weight with us, and which the Political Resident would probably, we think, endorse, there is the extreme difficulty as we see it ofmaking sure that Persia will not abuse any rights of inspection she may be given (particularly if they are not too precisely defined). They would probably not bo too scrupulous in suggesting that a dhow improperly searched by them was in fact flying no flag, and we might find it difficult to prove conclusively that this was not the case. Existing« « Exist inf; ri^ts of inspection by Persia* 6* Persia under the Muscat authority of 1898 referred T ■— ‘ to in paragraph 3 of the Arms Traffic Memorandum on p*l51 of P•G-.13 has rights of search of Muscat vessels ? is* J* on the high seas* If she showed any sign of realising that she had this right, we should probably thinh it necessary to advise the Sultan of Muscat to &lt;ancel the p?oclamation of 1898, and substitute for it an authority confined to His Majesty’s Ship^* (^t will be necessary to consider carefully the question whether Muscat snculd or should not be advised to accede to any jJruis--.raffic Convention which might give Persia rights against her ships - conditions have changed materially since 1919). Secondly, it seems possible in view of your letter, that she may retain some rights of inspection under the Brussels Act of 1890. Prima facie we are inclined to feel some doubt as to this, and it is perhaps not irrelevant first that she does not appear at any stage in the recent discussions to have claimed or referred to the possible existence of such rights, and second that tne governing instrument as regards slavery is at present the Anglo-Persian Convention of 1882, which is wholly one sided and confers rights of search of Persian vessels on His Majesty’s ships without conferring rights of search of any kind on Persia. 7. The position then is we accept your view that so long as the Arab principalities of the Gulf do not themselves accede or authorise us to accede on their behalf, to an instrusacnt such as the Arms Traffic Convention of 1925, and ao long as their vessels fly a flag which is not the flag of anH.C.P., Persia appears to have no legal right of inspection as Such vessels under the Convention: that* * A tha-c Persia in our view only very doubtfully possess any rights ofinspection at the moment (and quite possibly none save in respect of Muscat^vegf^ whToh could be withdrawn without delay if necessary): that we have been and are most reluctant to see her acquire any such rights: that subject to this point being adequately safeguarded we have however no objection to toe principle of special zonti,, and that prima facie we are inclined departmentally to think that subject to the point mentioned in paragraph 1 above, the latest Foreign Office proposals may afford a solution which while making it possible to maintain the principle of the special zones will equally safeguard the interests of our Arab prote&amp;£s. 7.
