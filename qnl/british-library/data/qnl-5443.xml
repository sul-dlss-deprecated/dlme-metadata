From the above it appears that the .eriod of 44 years winch has elepsed since the last change is a longer ^eriod than usually elapses between changes of course. Assuming that the factors making for a change in course have remained constant, it is not unlikely that a new change within the Northern delta may now be imminent, a a the methoas at present employed to control the river are in no **ay superior to there which have been used for the la at 1000 years.

It seems clear, therefore! that the process of raising of the mouth of the river by silting, the most important factor making for* a change of course, is to day far advanced. (2) in the past it has been necessary to construct a Aeir across tna iielmand at KuhaK to turn the water A nto the ;ud-i-Seistan (Nurab) channel for irrigation. In the Vvords of the He^enue 'Report ' Such weira are necessary, not only to divert a sufficient amount of water into the distributary channel, but because the bed of such a channel at its head is always higher than the bed of the • larent river. This results* from the deposits of silt at that point owing to the slackening off the velocity of the water as it leaves the mein stream'. For the lest 3 years it has not been found nece ssary to construct the weir across the Helmand at Kuhuk, more than sufficient water turning to the md-i-heistan (Hurab) of its own accord. Further, the oed of the Rud-i-leistan where it joins the 'main stream' is now definitely lower than that of the latter, und the water turning into the Rud-i-^eistan has a noticeably faster current than that which flows straight on. One would therefore expect a bar of s?ilt to oe formed ecrosss the itbca bed of the 'mam stream* here. That, this is, in fact, the case is borne out by the resence last winter of an easv ford (less than 3 1 deep) across the 'main stream' wriere the Rud-i-Seisten takes off, while the latter never became fordable.*'It should be borne in mind a that the bed of a diatributnry river in its delta rises steadily by the silt deposited; the change of channel is therefore originally due to the rise of 1 vel of the old channel making it possible for the water to ureak away down on a new and lower channel; a new distributary c&amp;nnot oe formed by Scour until the old diatriouiary has obtained command over the oeu of the newly to be formed distributary'.(5^ From m own observation I can vouch for the fact tnat of the Rud-i-Seiatan and the Rud-i-ianun the former is definitely the deeper and im a xatat the faster current at Kuhak, where the two streams separate. (3) Past changes in the rx^tltAxac river’s course seem always to have taken place in years of high flood;Co)and 1939 wee a year of greater floods than had been seen in a generation, in the spring of that year big floods found their my down the fcur&amp;b channel and the stone bridge over it near iaoul was washed away. The Hueuainki canal system also flooded severely and -^duI was nearly flooded from the iast in consequence/ Chapter XXXI11 page 134/1 he irrigation Report ^ol I ctr~ pci^e 15 Ceistan pp.163,173 &amp; 1?7 Revenue Report 7ol I chap.L page 319 uuo Tat rorPi v 'not trac eaoTe on the ) nor it is readily /traccaole eleewhere7 ® b 1940 was a year of much less rainfall, but even 30 there was enough water m the Nurab to breech the emoankfiiQnt near ^abul and v ery nearly to aestroy the new wood bridge; but in 1940 there were no corresponding Hoods in the Hussainki canals. I taK© it that the' explanation of this is that the bed of the Hud-i-^eiatari (Nurab) was deepened by scouring opposite where the huaeainki canals take off. This is in accordance with the procedure of the river in taking q new channel outlined in the irrigation Report 7olume I Chapter II page 15. To summarize, it appears that the mouth of the ■?ud-i-Parian channel has been considerably raised, that a bar is forming across it where the Nurato takes off, and that the bed of the latter stream was deepened by scouring during the floods of 1959. All these factors indicate the likelihood of a change in the course of the Helmand in the near future. (1) As the JMurab stream xi as it exists at present is act ntot shown on the survey of India maps it is necessary to recount it in some detail. It takes ofi at dand-i-Huhak where its width is about equal to that of the idslmand and is at least 3 times greater than it was in 1872(lS It then follows the Hud-i-Seistan as martced in the map pest Kimmak, Kala-i-Nau, Dehsokhta, laft Dashtak, ruhammedabad and hahramabad to discharge by a delta stretching from Afzalabad to l\iasarabad. (The village of Nasarabad Sayadan which lies in this delta, was washed away in 1939). The Nurau is bridged about 4 miles south of Zabul a mile or so above the head of the delta. Wear Aimmak a small branch takes off which only fills in flood time. It idows north of Jazinak and the sand hill area to the west of that village and joins the mam stream J mile north of Bahramabad. The Nurab has been in existence since the last war when the iast Persian Cordon constructed a pontoon bridge over it . (2) Of the streams flowing North from Kuhak the Ciksnr has silted up until it is little more than a ditch. Most of the irrigation water for the. north of the Mi£an- Fangi is carried by the hsla-i-Lakshak which runs into the Shela-i-Maliki. This is only is nothing at all on the ground to correspond to the area marked blue in the map. This area is not now normally flooded even at the height of the spring floods. (3) it has been ascertained by local enquiry that the amount of water flowing north (i.e. in the Siksar, Shela-i - laliki, and Pariun) was much greater in 1938 than m 194C and that the water in the Nurab was con siderably less in 1938 than in 1940. (In 1939, the year of the floods, all channels filled and over-flowed their bnnks). This would seem to indicate that the Hal- mand is in process of abandoning its northward flowing channels for the Nurab. It may~oe mentioned that the' fall from the Bandi- 1 -/vuhak to Af zalabad (i .b. along the Nurab) is more than 2 foot per mile, whereas that from the Band to Tappa-i-Aaakha (i.e. along the l^foot per mi le .

(4) Cn the other hand tho ijurao in its u pr.r reaches is very tortuous ;*nd ii confined between clearly marked banks. ’Hiis laust show down the ^•slocity of the s'ream, while the fact that it takes off at a sharp angle from the lie Inland while the Hud-i-iarium carries straight on must jfia&amp;e it easier for flooa water to take the latter course. Further the Nurub haa been in use for some years now and its our; vielta and the land coiomended by it must have been appreciably raised, rinally loc^l opinion, which although on-aidea by science is founded on gonorationa of experience, holas that the river, when it does take a new channel, will break away, into Afghan territory. (b) I conclude, on the balance ofi the e/i dance, that it is probable that the delman will change its course in tne near future if it is not already in irocess of doing so, and that it is -recable that the new course will, for a time at any rate, be the nurab. It remains to consider the liKely effects of such a change. (1) It v/ill be sirapleot to assume that there are three possible changes of course for the holmand:- a) into the hurab, b) towards the east below Bandi-i-Kuhak, c) towards the east abo ve Band! n-Kuhak. The ef’sets of chaage (a) on Kabul town can be estimated from the contoured map appended to this note. It will be seen that the present bridge is most unfor tunately sited as the river has no clearly defined canks at that point, r iid tne ground on ooth sides of the bridge, but particularly on the South is liable to flooding. It the Helmand follows tne Hurab coiiiiiuni- cation with the outside world cy the present route will .robably be more or lesa permanently interrupted. It ia locally considered prooaole that the Kurab if flooded v^ould follow the dotted blue line on the sketch and inunda te Zabul tov;n. t r fac ie this doe? not * ppe* r likely but it should be rarriembered thet the sketch is made from the maps of the Maciiahon Commission which are 36 years old, and that the bed of the Kurab, its delta and surrounding country may have been raised in the interval. Tne Sfdatania seem to have a very well developed instinct for estimating the direction which flooua nil take. uhaii^e vi* # mn u 5c) vould not ai fact uanul town Apart from the rest of the Iranian ueiatan. (3) The effect of the possible changes on the Kac^ahon ’.feter Award ia more difficult to estimate as it is not known to what extent either aide now abides by its provisions, which were rougblv ,s lollov.o. Iran is to have one third and Afghanistan two thirds of the water which reaches Bandar-i-Kamal uhan. Both rides may maintain existing work* ana construct new ones which do not prejudice the supply of water to the other side.1 across the Hud-1-Far ion at the point where the Uiksejr branches take off from it to divert waier IiGjto the ; latter channels. The Iranian^, hfry^yfri t fin thff m doiin^ this (in defiance apparently of the ^ac^*ahon Award; and they consequently constructed a canel which taxes off the 'main stream at aila-i-Fath and irrigates oiost of Afghan Seiatan. There is no doubt that Iran takes the lion’s share of the water at and below Kuhak, but, without knowing the capacity of the canals taking off on the Afghan side above that point, it is impossible to say whether she is taking more than her one third share of the river atxaftzzGOax Bandar -i-Kamal khan, though this seems probeble. Change (a) (the turning of the whole river into the Nurab)'would not materially alter the existing situation except for the damage to such Afghan lands as may still be watered by canals taking off below tJand-i-Auhak. Change (b) ( the turning of the river to the ^aat below band-i-kuhak) would prooably not be disastrous provioed the band could be reconstructed so as to fill the fturab channel. Change (c) ( the turning of the river to the hast above the Band-i-Kuhak) would mean that almost all Iranian 3®istan would become a desert. There would be a danger of famine on a large scale unless very prompt measures were taken to cam the new stream so that the water v/ere brought to the I^urab. This dam would be essential to the existence of Iranian beiatan but would have to lie ontiroly within Afghan territory. A prompt and amicable settlement of so ikK.s thorny a roblem ia difficult to imagine.r indexed Confidential. w* / Ho. 383/17/40. My dear Hay, * Many thanks for your letter of the 25th March (D.O.

I will first answer the questions raised on pages 5 and 6 of this file. (a) Advice cannot be given regarding flood precautions without visiting the spot. (b) If the Iranian Government have engineers with the necessary experience and technical training to interpret and apply this information, volumes I and II of the Irrigat ion Report of the Perao-Afghan Arbitration Commission 1902- 1906 would be invaluable to them, provided they are at the same time supplied with the maps and sections enumerated in Appendix 16 of Vol. I, and the 'Hevenue Report and Notes’* to which there is frequent references in Vol, I, e.g., pages 31, 43 etc. I would go further and say that without carefully studying these records they could not proceed on the right lines. Even if the Iranian Government had the guidance of such experts as were employed in connection with the Perso-Afghan Arbitration Commission, a great deal of the vital information contained in these volumes could not be reassembled, and what could be collected would require months of labour. The fact that the above information was collected 35 years ago enhances its value, as in problems of river control we must study the past history of a river, and the further back we can go the greater the certainty with which we can make recommendations. I must stress the value of the maps and sections referred to above. The information they are reported to contain is unique, and harein lies a possible danger of divulging the Information In the present state of world affai affairs/.affairs* The most recent maps of the Survey of India covering Seistan do not contain this information* The topographical 1' to 4 miles maps are merely hatched and has not contoured, as the field data gangaiyxkafcKhafltxami/not been collected. Apart from the topographical maps there only exist the geographical maps of scale 16 H to 1 mile, on which contours are at great intervals and of no value for details, and the old maps of Seistan made by Colonel McMahon in 1903 to a scale of 1' to 1 mile, which are not contoured and only embrace a small area of the delta entering the Hamun-i-Zabari (c) On purely technical gu grounds there is no object ion to a copy of the report being given to the Iranian Government, but I would draw attention to Chapter XI wherein the existence of coal and petroleum in Baluchistan is mentioned. This is not even referred to in the ubiquitously circulated Statistical Year Book of the World Bower Conferen ce 1938* The importance of the maps and sections I have already dealt with. Other points which should be considered are the accounts of the equipment needed in the shape of water carrying utensils, the fuel question, and the descriptions of the conditions of communications at various seasons of the year. These latter conditions, it is true, are indicated in the topographical maps of the Survey of India to which I have already made reference. I feel that much useful advice ggratl could be given regarding foild control on the Helmand River by an engineer visiting Seistan. Sd/- A.R.B.

This is borne out by amy enquiries which show that the land round ^IgSr at the present mouth of the nelmand is so high tha the Helmand has to be dammed there to obtain sufficient head of water to reach the fields. 2. in the past the river has usually given previous indication of the coming change by floods along the new bed which scour it out. in the next year of high flood the new bed . is then deep enough to take the main discharge. Last year's flood of the Nurab appears to have been of this nature, and l have fysr for some weeks suspected that a change in the course of the helmand was threatened. 1 was, however, waiting until it was possi^ to visit mnd-i-Seistan before submitting a report: this the flood of the 5rd February anticipated. 3. 1 have inspected the Nurab at several points along its course up to J^alaihuhna and 1 have also seen the previous main channel of the He Inland (Jld-i-Pariun) at Malaki. Of the two the ’’Nurab'* was wider and deeper and, if anything, faster. There are, however, two other channels running north. 1 forded the western most one and found it only some 3 foot deep and sluggish, while the other, Vthe biksar on the Afghan boundary was said to be even smaller. 1 am therefore of the opinion that the discharge of the iMurab a month ago was about equal to that of the old bed of the nelraoand. This is merely an amateur opinion and not founded on any measurements or calculations what-soever. 4. In previous years there has been at Kohak ^the point of divergent e of the Nurab from the delmaiKU a dam to turn the water from the Helmand into the Nurab for irrigation . This /used...24 uoed to be built in August of tamarisk fascines, and the spriag floods used to carry it away, without it the wurab would have carried not water, at least during the winter. Last autumn this bend lor^any rate the Irani half of it) was not built. The heavy winter discharge of the Nurab has therefore found its om s way into that river un-assisted by any dam* 6* iact which points to the change of bed beir^ at present far from complete is that during the floods of 3rd Febnmry the 52-i-Pariun also flooded very severely; but this does nod&gt; prove tnat no change in the river bed is in progress, in the past such changes have taken several years, during which the old bed may carry water, i think 1 am right in saying, however, that it is unusu^al for a river to divide into two branches and for both of them to carry an equal amount of water tor any length of time* That being so 1 consider that the “Numb' is in process of becoming the ,, HeImand M 7. ihe obvious result of this will be considerable suffering to the population of beistan both from inundations and from the drying up of the present delta* in addition when the change is complete Zabul will probably become ininliabitable in its present site, finally canals taking off into Afghanistan from th^astem bank of the helmand and the diksar channel are likely to run dry. This will upset dir Henry -ac^-ahon's division of the helm^and waters between Afghanistan and Iran, and the parties may have difficulty in reaching a settlement by negotiation. 1 have not yet had time to study this last aspect of the matter* vice -Consul t 2abul -Telegram R LJo . 29 dated 6th (reed. 7th) March 1940.

A note on the floo ds In Sei atan of Uarcb-Juno 1939. I I During th&lt;j spring of 1939 Seistan nas been flooded to an extent, according to local opinion, unparalleled for the last 30 to 40 years* Considerable damage has been done to crops, villages, and roads; and at on - time Tears were entertained for the safety of the city of Zabul itself. This note is an attest to summarise the causes, history, and consequences of this flood* The Consulate staff have not, however, been able to visit the outlying parts of the district to estimate the damage, and the authorities have given us no official information, nor have they issued any bulletins* It will therefore be realised that this note is based only on what has been observed in and around Zabul, or has been heard in the bazars, and it must not be regarded as official or infallible. Causes* The Haianpff of Seistan are fed by the Helmand, Farah Rud, Herat Hud, and occasionally the Khash Hud rivers of which by far the most water is brought by the Helmand* In Seistan it normally rains during February and March and the Hamune normally expand in consequence, but the spring of 1939 was exceptionally rainy as will b* observed from the following tables- Total rain-fall during 1935 * . • 1.62' M H * 1936 . . . l.gd' ' ' ' 1937 . . . 1.02' ' ' ' 1938 * * * ,, Total rainfall of 4 years. 5*62' i Rainfall during the first 3 months of 1939 . . 5.06' /The rainfall.-a- !r ®’l ; The rainfhll over S-W Afghanistan v»as presumably also above normal* but no information is available as to which of the 4 rivers mentioned above flooded* find when* However* an exceptional rise in the water level in the Haiauns was caused* 3* narrative ox | If During March the Hamun began to rise above normal levels. On the 4th/5th April the Sabul-Bunjar road was flooded owing to a breach in a canal about 4 miles east of £abul, but the authorities managed to close tha breach. On April 8th the 2 ^abul**Zaiiidan road was flooded by water from the Naurab. The floods continued to increase and on the night 17th/18th April one pillar of the Naurab bridge was washed away* fho authorities breached the c-nal further up in an attempt to save the bridge* and the Ann road on the far side^as further inundated* On the same night a c nal passing close by Zabul on the N-S breached in several places. Only frantic work on 18th April by the Zabul garrison saved the town from being flooded. The same day the Naurab was breached to the west of Zabul in the direction of Koh-i-Khwaja and water crossed the Afsalabad road and the landing ground. On the night 20th/21st April further arches of the Naurab bridge were carried away. A further Hood on the night of 21at/22nd April caused the authorities to call back all labourer! from, the rural areas to work on the defences of the town. Henceforth the rural population of Seistan was left to fight the floods unaided. On 28th April the Shela channel joining the o Hamun to the Gand-i-Zeireh began to fill and by 2nd /NayMay the wat«*r there had reached a depth of 10 feet* This led to a lessening of the danger to the west of £abul« By 9th May the water in the Sheila was said to he 30 feet deep t hut inspite of this the Zahldan road near Tauski was flooded. About the same time the village of K&amp;eho 4 miles to the north of Z&amp;bul was washed away by floods aided by a strong wind* About 17th May telegraphic communication was cut off on the Zahidan line(2 wires) between Naurab and Gird! and on the Meshed line ( 1 wire) where it crosses the H&amp;mun west of Afsalabad* On the 23rd the line to Meshed was restored* Water continued to decrease 9 and on the 16th June the Vice-Consul # Zabul, made the journey from Zahidan as follows* Zahidan to Sheila was travelled by lorry* The Sheila was over 100 yards wide and the depth was stated to be some 30 feet 9 while it had obviously risen to some 12* higher* The current was flowing at some 3 miles per hour. The Shela was crossed by tutia of which some half dozen were plying* A * ^ lorry was used from the Shelia to Naurab 9 following the road as far as Glrdi and then striking a^cross country to the east of the road and joining it again to the south of MeMaeuftadsbad 9 thence the 2abul-Zahidan road was followed to the Naur&amp;b* The cross country section was almost entirely unmade and only practicable for light lorries of an athletic build. Some 40 coolies were observed to be improving the track at various places* The flooded portion of the road on the far side of the Naurab was crossed by tutia . and the Naurab itself was crossed by an improvised structure of t telegraph wires and railway sleepers of Heath Robinson ian design based on the remains of the Naurab bridge* This was only fit to take foot passengers but ponies were being swam across the Naurab* Finally the normal / road*; | I road ms followed from the Saur&amp;b to 3«bul* Although the water Is now ( June 18th) considerably lower tJaan it has been and is reported to be d^oppiivT* it if; considered locally tiiat the floods hithei’to have buen the result of rain and not ©now water* and The Helmand &gt; /to a certain extent, the Farah Hud drain the Central Hazarajat containing aiany peaks and ranges from H000 to 15,000 feetj^over in height. Th^i -helaand catciiiAent area reaches to within a few miles south west of Kabul and thence rune west along the Koh-l-Baba Range end it is known that there were heavy enow falls in this area in Uarch last. 1 anticipate, therefore, thet the delmand will continue to discharge an abnormal volume of mter for some weeks to come, as a result of tha melting a£ tliis snow. Normally snow water is expected to reach Seistan duidug Juna and this year it my well continue into July and even August* It is locally consider 3d likely that the 3 he la channel will not run dry thie winter, but will continue flowing antil the next spring flood, and I am Inclined to agree with this opinion. On the other hand the Baa~i-Sad-o-bigt ruz should begin within a week or two this tends to blow the water Louthwai'ds towards the She la, helping the drainage of Scistan. , On tho whole I am inclined to think that the trann )ort arrangements between Sabul and %ahidan detailed in pai*a 5 above will continue in force for several montnc and possibly until after the floods of next spring have subsided.

From Tozgi to the Shela itself the road appears to be under water, except for a small island at Girdi, and to be passable only by camel. From the South bank of the Shela to Zahidan lorries can run as usual. 4 . A further 15 villages have been reported as having lost the whole of their crops during the third week of May but the level of the water in the Naurab has since fallen by some three feet and tne situation of Zabul town appears to be less critical.

OF a report dated the 19th April 1939 from the Clerk* in-Charge, British Vice Consulate, Zabul. In continuation of my report dated the 11th April 1939, I beg to submit below the report on flood conditions in Seistan for the week ending the 18th April 1939. Naurab bridge were dompleted on April 16th and 3 lorries from Zahidan arrived at Babul for the first time since the breach took place. flood in the Naurab, washed away one pillar of the bridge and damaged another, after which a crack appeared in the upper portion of the bridge. On the morning of 18th April only the Ustandar for Mekran, on return journey to Zahidan, was able to cross the bridge in his car, after which strict orders were given to not^allow any traffic over the bridge. To save the bridge from further damage the authorities cut open the Naurab bank about 4 miles up the bridge, as a result of which the astray water again reached the Zahidan road on the morning of 18th April and damaged the portion of the road recently repaired. Tater began to increase so rapidly that till midday of April 18th all was water from the bridge up to the tempbrary lorry stand on the other side of the water. Traffic has totally been stopped. place in the canal passing by the military barracks under construction. The military authorities were alarmed atonce and started filling the breach • Cta the 18th April several bweaches took place and were 1. The repairs on the Zahidan road near the 2. On the night of 17th April, an unprecendented to 3. On the night of April 17th a breach took filled/filled in by the military authorities. But danger / to the town increased at the close of the day (18th April) when the military authorities informed the residents that although they would die before they allow the water to enter the town,still as a precautionary measure they should be ready to save their lives at the sound of the blowing of the bugle three times sucfessively, which would mean that they have failed to control it. All the families and children living in the military lines were shifted CK to a house situated on the higher level than the military barracks. British subjects residing in Zabul and the Consulate employees possessing families were informed by this office to shift to houses situated on a higher level than their houses in case they feel any danger of flood. Alternatively they were informed that this Consulate wbuld be open for them throughout the night if they prefer shifting here. As water was increasing at the rate of 3 inches per 4 hours, it was expected that until the morning of April 19th water level would be higher by 9 inches. Under the circumstances the military authorities raised the earthen fence to l^yard. Most of the residents did not sleep throughout the night of April 18th waiting for the bugle to blow, and to run for their lives. This Consulate Chaukidar Ismail, who was given strict orders to awaken the Consulate employees at the sound of the bugle, knocked at my door at 1 a.ra. with the news that the bugle had blown. I got up atonce but inquiry found out th&amp;t the bugle sounded once only which was a sign of alrrm for the military only and not for the residen ts, in which case the bugle would sound thrice. 0|i awakening next morning the residents found all well, the credit of which goes to Sarhang (Colonel) Ali Akbar/Akbar Shahri, the Brigadier whose ubiquitous activities saved the town from being washed away. The soldiers as well as officers showed much perseverance and patience throughout the night in controlling water. The civil authorities were on the other hand busy in saving the bridge. But this enjoyment of the residents was marred by hearing the news that a breach had taken place in the Naurfab near the old Zahidan road and that water had faced the town. But the farmers joined by the soldiers controlled this water and diverted its course towards the lake. 4. The electric plant and the flour mill worked from 11th to 16th April and stopped .again on account of lack of firewood. Water supply is still withheld except a little quantity for drinking purposes. Mar Bread is still dear and sugar is not available in bazar. 5. In addition to the above facts, cultivation around the villages of Bnjnar, Ishrat Abad, Deh l^ati- ullah, Deh Taghazi and Deh Sadiq has been damaged by floods.' A /'K,y 'V ' IV t I Mo. 27.

Sir f 1 have the honour to refer to my diary for U&amp;rch in which I have driven a brief account of conditions in oietan and to supplement it by a special report on the situation as it may affect the grounds and buildings of the aabul Consulate. 2. According to the latest Information which I have received although the Mqrab river has burst its banks and cut off road ceswtunicwtions with the outside world there is no immediate danger to the town of 3abul iUself. Jabul however lies very low and though it has no large canel in the Immediate vicinity it seems highly probable that the floods will eventually inundate the wf^ole country and reach the town itself.

Including tha Consulate. Ths f^ict that the Consulate sdjolns ths govsmorwts and lies between the town proper end the barracks gives further ground for confidence, at the seme time the possibility cannot be overlooked that the defensive measures will prove inadequats end ths town bs flooded. 4. Old inhabitants say that once before^many years arc,before the existence of the British Oonaulate t the town was only saved from inundation by the diversion of ths flood water through the lowlying lands on which the Consulate now st«nds f and it is csrtainly true that large portions of the Conaulatt gardsn are definitely lower than the street level outside. Only the Consulate itself and the hospital buildings have plinths mors than a few Inches high. The remainder of the buildings are all on a low level. 5. It was obviously inadvisable that I should myself remain in &amp;»bul y cut offf perhaps for several weeks, from my headquarters to await a contingency Which might never arise, and which in case 1 could do nothing to avert. I therefore contented myself with civinf? instructione for tie losnevHete strengthening of the heses of eoise parts of the p.rlmeter wall which the firet «**• floo.lajt water would be likely to reach and for this work to be extended later If the situation should render it necessary.

In that despatch I hare given full details of tho Zahul property and of our rights in it. She total area actually in our possession, though our legal rights!h over part of it are doubtful, is somewhat larger thi tnat which we wish to acquire in Zahidan; it ia situated in the centre of the town whereas the AanlOan /ice Consulate is a mile away; and it contains one of the best nouses in zabul, which looe officers have repeatedly asked to be allowed to rent and unioh, I oelieve* them to be still anxious to acquire. on the other hand, Zabul is moribund and land values there are likely to deoreas rather than inorease while the reverse is the case 14 Zahidan. It would therefore, in my opinion, be a reasonable proposition from the point of view of both His ifejesty‘s and that of the Iranian Qovemmen- that the two properties should be exchanged without any compensatory payment on either side. For us, though the zabul property is probably at the moment 1 of considerably more value than the land at Zahidan, the further advantage of disencumbering ourselves of what has for long been an embarrassment to us ia considerable# 1 would iiberefore recoaaend the proposal for your consideration.

Department Please see the Minute at P.Z. 5018/37 (flagged) in which the history of the case is set out. The sanction of His Majesty’s Government had been accorded to the Government of India’s proposal for the sale of the land and buildings to the Afghan Government on the understanding that the Government of India were satisfied that the Afghan Government would acquire a good title to the property. His Majesty’s Consul General subsequently concluded negotiations with Mohammed Ali ensuring that we had a good title to the property vis-k-vis Mohammed Ali himself, but certain developments have recently taken place from which it appears that we should not be able to guarantee such a title to the Afghan Government (P.Z. 2553/38)$ (1) from a recent survey it seems that the present area of the property is considerably more than that originally granted by the Shah, and that half Mohammed Ali’s house lies outside the undoubted Consular area. (2) the widow of a late partner in the firm of Mohammed Ali has claimed an interest in the property. This claim, though extremely flimsy, may prove a source of further embarrassment to us if she presses it. Further, the present Afghan Consul is not now particularly eager to acquire the property, and has recommended to his Government that the price settled last year (viz. Rs. 5,000 for the land and Rs. 3,000 for the buildings) should be considerably reduced. In these circumstances it seems undesirable to proceed with the sale to the Afghan Government. The Consul-General thinks the best plan for disposing of the property/ 6474b Wt 22530/P 114 10,000 9.37 '10Pproperty would be to hand it over to the Iranian Government in return for the land on which the Zahidan Vice-Consulate buildings stand, to which we have at present no title. It is therefore submitted that the Government of India’s proposal not to proceed with the sale should be sanctioned. They have asked the Minister at Tehran to inform the Afghan Ambassador that it is no longer desired to proceed with the transaction if His Majesty’s Government agree to the proposal, and request that the Minister at Kabul should be informed direct of His Majesty’s Governments concurrence. A draft letter to the Foreign Office asking them to communicate with the Minister at Tehran in the event of their concurrence is submitted accordingly.Draft Paper. 'Vl, 7 $Sz&gt;ls t \ Department.

In the circumstances explained by His Majesty’s Consul General for Khorasan, it seems clearly undesirable to proceed with the sale of the Consular property at Zabul to the Afghan Government. If His Majesty’s Government agree, it is requested that they will kindly inform His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, as aoon as possible of their concurrence in the communication which the Government of India have asked him to make to the Afghan Ambassador at Tehran, vide the concluding portion of paragraph 1 of their letter to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, a copy of which is enclosed. 3. A copy of this letter is being sent to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant. j RECo. P0l7i&amp;?r. 1 APB 1938 l INDIA OFFICEConfidential. Copy of a letter Ko.42-(20^5), dated thej-2th February 1938, from His IJajesty's Consul General for Iihorasan,Zabul, to the Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, New Delhi• I have the honour to refer to my Despatch No.247 of October 6th 1937 (No.82-(20/5) to Tehran on the subject of the Consular property in Zabul, and to say that three recent developments in this most troublesome case seem to indicate that a reconsideration of the whole position is necessary. Consuls here and the present Consul who is not so ea^er to acquire the property as his predecessor, has gone back on the agreement reached last year between his predecessor and myself and informs me that he has recommended to his Government that the price settled should be considerably reduced (by how much I have not been able to discover). 3. Secondly I have now completed a personal survey of the ground and enclose a scale plan embodying the results v/hich shows the past and present situations with regard to this property. It will be seen that the present area of the property is considerably more than that originally granted, - totalling in fact according to my calculations, 22,903 square yards, against 12,744 square yards (9,145 square Zar at 42i- n per Zar), originally granted, - and that half the main house lies outside the there had been extensions on the south side of the original consular property, but it had been considered - and indeed definitely reported in 1933, (paragraph 2 of 2. In the first case there lias been a change of Afghan undoubted consular area. It had all along been realised that letter No.ll8-20/6A of 9-3-33, Despatch No.20 to Tehran) that /that these did not a ffect the main building itself and were therefore unimportant. 4. Thirdly, the widow of the late Sulaimanji, a former partner in the firm of Mohd. Ali Bros, has recently visited Zabul and presented petitions to the local Iranian Court in which she claims to have an interest in the property in question, as a result of which she is seeking to secure for herself a share of any payment made to Mohd. Ali from its disposal. It is truethat her claim is, as far as can be ascertained, flimsy in the extreme, but the very fact that she may endeavour to press it is likely to be a source of some embarrasment to us. 5. The facts now brought to light show that though we have succeeded in securing a good title vis-a-vis Mohd. Ali himself, this is insufficient to guarantee the same title to the Afghan Government. It is true that the conclusions at which I have now arrived are the result of a prolonged examination of our most meagre records and that as far as I am able to ascertain the local authorities consider that the whole area excluding the buildings belong of right to us, and would be quite unable to produce any legal proof to the contrary; but at the same time Sulaimanji r s widow, who is an Iranian by birth, must know that the whole area did not originally form part of the Consular property. I am therefore compelled to reconnend that the present project should be altogether abandoned. It is indeed probable that it would in any case have failed to materialise but I regret that my failure to discover the exact situation earlier should have given rise to so mach unnecessary correspondence. This failure has been due to the fact that I have not been able to find anyone locally capable /capable of even the most elementary surveying work, that my own knowledge of the subject is rudimentary, and that the area in question is of irregular shape, its western half covered with numerous buildings, and consequently exceedingly difficult to measure accurately. 6. There remains the disposal of this unwanted property, and on this subject I propose to address the Government of India more fully as soon as it is agreed that the present project must be dropped. Briefly I would propose to endeavour to return it to the Iranian Government in exchange for land on which the Zahidan Vice-Consulate buildings stand and to which we have at present no title whatever. The local authorities would welcome the house whichj^still one of the best in Zabul in spite of its now dilapidated condition and would I think be prepared to pay something to Mohd. Ali in order to acquire it. 7. I am sending a copy of this letter to His Majesty f s Minister, Tehran, under P # L„ No.14.■■IJ NoJM69-lt/37. From The Deputy Secretary to the Goyemaent of India in the iiixtemal Affairs Department, To Hie ife-jetity^ Ehvcy ^rtraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Iran, Tehran* Dated New Delhi, the April 1938* Consular property in Zabul.

It is not known whether you hare yet received any reply to your letter to the Afghan Charge d f Affaires, a copy of which was received here as an enclosure to your letter to Hia Majesty's Consul General for Khorasan, No.65, dated the 18th September 1937, repeated to the Government of India as No.168, but if you see no objection and provided Hia Majesty's Government agree, it is requested that the Afghan Ambassador may now be informed that it is no longer desired to proceed with the transaction. 2. A copy of this letter is being sent to the India Office, His Majesty's Consul General for Khorasan, and Minister, Kabul. I have the honour to be Your most obedient servant, Sd/-. W.R. Hay, Deputy Secretary to the Goremment of India.from G-.F.Squire Esquire, 1.0*3., His Majesty^ Consul G-eneral for Khorasan, Meshed, to The Secretary to the Gr-overnment of India in the External Affairs Department, New Delhi* Department’s letter No.F.169-N/37 dated 22.10.37 and to say that in paragraph 3 of my letter No.17-20/6a dated the 1st February 1937 I mentioned that the offer of Rs.3000 for Mohamed Ali’s buildings was subject to confirmation by the Afghan Ambassador in Tehran. I did not therefore consider it wise to commit G-overnment to paying to the firm the full sum of Rs.3000 in case this amount should not eventually be forthcoming* 2. It was, and is still, quite probable that by the time that the negotiations are,completed the house will not indeed be worth as much as the sum of Rs.3000 agreed upon by the Afghan Consul and myself. I enclose as requested a copy of my letter No.114 dated the 10th June 1937 to the firm which will I trust make the position clear. I have the honour to refer to internal Affairs Sale of (Government land at ZabulNo.114 British Consulate G-eneral, Meshed. 10th June 1937. Dear Sirs, I have to inform you that a sum of Tomans 500/- has been realised from the sale of your two steam boiler plants in Zabul and that I am holding the money in part payment of your debt of Tomans 900/- to Grhulam Mohamed. You will see therefore that there still remains due to him a sum of Tomans 400/-. 2. I have furthermore received from the Afghan G-overn* ment a provisional offer for the whole Consulate property formerly in your possession including the various buildings and the residential house with the land immediately adjacent to it. 3. While it is admitted that the house itself was erected by your firm (at your own risk and upon the plain underslanding that the land would be entirely vacated should the Government of India require it) your later &amp; claim that the house is situated almost entirely on your own and not on Consulate land is not admitted. lor of course can you have any claim to the sale proceeds of the smaller buildings which are admittedly on Consulate land. The Government of India, however, in negotiating this pro posed sale of their land, have no desire to profit, at your expense, from the sale of the buildings erected by you and in the event of the transaction being effected, are therefore prepared to pay you, in return for a formal relinquishment of all claim to the land, the actual amount received for the buildings, less: (a) such expenses as may reasonably be incurred in their sale as distinct from the sale' of the land; and (b) the balance (Tomans 400/-) of your debt to Ghulam Mohamed. In the latter connection I would refer you to your letter dated/-dated 28th November 1931 to K.S. Mohamed 3-ul in which you suggested that the doors and windows of the building might be sold to meet Grhulam Mohamed’s claim; you will perhaps agree that rather than reduce the value of the house in that manner it would be preferable to deduct the amount remaining due to your creditor from the sum eventually paid for the building. 4. The price which has been tentatively offered for all the buildings is Rs.3000 provided that the transaction is completed without further delay. The dwelling house is however daily deteriorating, and indeed part of the verandah has already fallen down; it cannot therefore be guaranteed that Rs.3000 will be the sale price, and it is possible that eventually I may not be able to obtain a higher price than Rs.1500. I would indeed emphasise that if no attention is paid to the structure it will become worthless within thd^iext two years, an eventuality which is, of course, of no concern to me and which would entail no loss to the G-overnment of India. 5. I would therefore suggest that you should now authorise me to conclude the transaction on the lines pro posed in para: 3 on the clear understanding that (i) for the reason given in para: 4 I am unable to guarantee a sum exceeding Rs.1500 as the sale price of the buildings, and (ii) before whatever sum obtained for the buildings is paid to you, you will execute a legal document formally surrendering without reservation all claim to the property and land concerned in the transaction A draft authorisation on these lines is enclosed for your consideration; if approved it may kindly be signed and return without further delay. 6. From the above you will see that if you agree to the suggestions I have made you will receive, in the event of/-of the transaction being concluded, a sum isrhich should not be less than Rupees 750/- and may be as much as Rupees 2250 whereas if you do not agree it is most improbable that you will in the end receive anything at all.

On the basis of paragraph 3 of your letter N0.17-26/A, dated the 1st February 1937, the Government of India suggested in their express letter NO.F.169-N/37, dated the 21st May 1937, that the firm should be offered the sum of Hs.3,000 which the Afghan Consul had agreed to pay for the buildings. It is not fully understood therefore why the sum of only Hs.1,500 is mentioned in the firm's letter, and I am to request that the matter may kindly be explained.

It is satisfactory that this white elephant is at last to disappear. It is, of course, most undesirables you pointed out to the Consul-General, Khoras^an in your letter of the 21st May last, No.F.169-N/37, that the property should be sold to the Afghans unless they could be given a clear title. It occurred to us that there were two points involved which might give rise to trouble in this connection; (1) the sum of Rs.3,000 is to be handed over to Muhamtfd Ali Bros, less, we presume, the sum due to the Consulate employee. Will the firm make trouble if they do not receive the full amount of Rs.3,000 in cash in view of the terns of their declaration? (2) Is there any legal bar to payment being made to the firm in India in respect of the sale of their property in Persia when we are aware that the Persian branch of the firm went bankrupt and the rest of their property was attached for debt? But you are nodoubt satisfied that if any difficulty arises on these points the Afghans will not be disturbed in their possession of the property. 3. There remains the question of the disposal of the proceeds of the sale of the land and the machinery. In this connection I enclose a copy of a letter from the Foreign Office in which it is assumed that Rs.5,000 (the Treasury seem not to have laid any claim to the proceeds of the machinery which is being sold separately for Rs.826. 7. -) will be shared between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India. It is, of course, the practice of the Government of India to bear the whole of any capital expenditure at Zabul and there may be some cat^se for the retention of the whole of th^capital receipt. However, we gather from our records that the rent was handed over to Government in 1907 by the Persian Government ^in satisfaction of a demand made in connection with an attack on the British Consulate) in return for a nominal payment. Our papers do not show what price was paid or the payment was met wholly by one or other of the two Governments or was shared. His Majesty’s Government may, therefore, have some interest in the Dated 8th September, 1937. to.

The Government of India have asked for telegraphic sanction to the sale of certain Government land at zabul, negotiations for which have been proceeding at intervals since 1932, A short history of the case may be appropriate, 2* An area of land immediately outside the compound of H.M.Consulate at zabul (sistan) v/as presented to Government (possibly for a nominal payment) by the Shah in 1907 as compensation for damage done to the Consulate buildings in March 1906. In 1912 part of the land was ru'x 'lent' to an Indian firm, Mohamedally Bros., on which they desired to erect buildings for which they agreed to pay a rent of Rs.15 per mensem. The firm signed an agreement to vacate the land when required, on reasonable noticeibeing given. In 1931 the Persian part of the firm went bankrupt, in disreputable circumstances f and the rent ceased, ks the Persian law prevented the property being relet^c^ % registration tax on it was threatened^and sr the buildings were too costly to occupy^the Consul-General proposed that the property should be sold. possession could have been obtained in accordance with the original agreement^ but it seemed unlikely that a purchaser could be obtained and the (U\ land was accordingly offered to Mohameda^^ 1 Bros, in India for the sum of Rs.3,600 (20 years’ purchase of the rent). In reply the firm alleged that only part of their buildings stood on Consular land and they offered to sell the other part to Government at the same rate. This v/as a bogus claim since all their property in Persia had been attached &gt; but it was feared that the firm were sufficiently unscrupulous to assign their alleged claim to creditors who might proceed to law ? and as the plans in possession of the Consulate were not exact, lengthy legal proceedings/ 5353 5000 3/37proceedings might have ensued. The negotiations dragged on until 1934 end were then dropped after notice to quit had been given. An alternative proposal that ; in order to escape tax ( Government interest in that part of the land ftli to which Mohamed^p^j Bros, might conceivably have had a claim should be relinquished, and that the part which was clearly Government property should be sold f was sanctioned, .No buyer could, however, be found for the one part and as no tax was demanded Government’s interest in the other part was not relinquished. 3. In April 1936 the Afghan Government intimated that they were interested in the land and buildings, and it was arranged that the Consul-General, Meshed, and the Afghan Consul, Zabul , should negotiate a price. The rfcrm€f|tbought that the previous price asked was too low and raised it to Rs.5,000 for the land and Rs.6,000 for the buildings (without the machinery in them), and in February last the Afghans accepted this price for the lane and offered Rs.3,000 for the buildings. A separate offer of Rs.826-7-0 was obtained for the machinery. Al i 4. The difficulty about Mohamed^^y’s possible claim remained ? and the Government of India properly pointed out that it was most undesirable that we should sell any property to the Afghan Government in which our title was uncertain or that we should run the risk of a heavy claim subsequently. They suggested, therefore, that the Consul f\W General should get from Mohamed#### Bros, a declaration in writing authorising him to sell the ^l^jr^^in return for Rs.3,000 in full payment for any interest they might possess. This declaration has now been given and it may be presumed that the Consul-General and the Afghan Consul are satisfied that a good title can be given. The Consul General has made a good bargain and it is submitted that the ©ale should be sanctioned; but it would perhaps beMinute Paper. Department. \ j well to emphasize that the Afghan Consul should be satisfied with his title before the sale is completed. 6.A subsidiary point is that when the Persian branch of the firm went bankrupt they failed to repay the sum of Rials 9000 deposited with them by a Consulate employee. They admitted the claim for this amount in 1932 and said that it could be met fran the value of their property on the Consulate land. The Government of India have asked the Consul-General to warn the firm that this debt would be deducted from the Rs.3,000. We do not know what action has been taken on this, but the Consul-General will no doubt be on his guard against giving the firm any chance to make trouble if the full sum is not paid to them. Presumably the Government of India are satisfied that they AU can legally make a payment to Mohamed|0^^ Bros, in India in respect of property in Persia, although the firm went bankrupt in Persia, and the rest of their property there i was attached. 6. A further point which will have to be cleared up after the sale has been effected is to whom the proceeds should go. We have no record to show by whom the original payment for the land y if any, was made. It is Hoc-ir possible that H.M.G. has an interest in it s.nd|concurrence \v\ has been sought the various proposals for its sale. The running cost of the Zabul Consulate is shared between Imperial and Indian Revenues t but capital expenditure is borne by the Government of India. The Foreign Office may raise the point. It is proposed to put this and the two points referred to above to the Government of India demi-officially after the reply to : their telegram has issued.

It will be seen therefore that Messrs Monammad Ali Brothers’ house is at present still in the charge of this Consulate-General. I regret that I did not make the foregoing; clear before. Tne necessity for deferring action in regard to the relinquishment of the land in question, seems to me to be of little importance, since it might still occur tnat we could sell tne wnole property. My desire was to be in a position to offer. 1 . either the whole property or 2 . the garden only, if no offer for the whole is forthcoming and also to be able to surrender our claim to 'A' should we be pressed to 'register” it and pay fees. This being so, we have not announced that we disclaim interest in the portion 'A'. The...The Iranian Official who occupied the house without permission either from the Consulate or Mohammad Ali Brothers (who in fact no longer claim the building), was most insulting to a member of our staff sent to acquaint him of the position. He haocw even had the temerity to have the Consulate representative called to the police station to demand production of a 'Power of Attorney'. Eventually he left the property after repeated application by our Vice Consul to the Governor. A few days later one of these Criminal Investigation Department Agents (of whom there were three at Zabul) sent an indirect message to our Vice Consul offering to 'sell information'.

It seems most undesirable that we should sell any property to the Afghan Consul in which our title is uncertain, or that we should run the risk of being faced by a heavy claim once the sale has been effected It is therefore suggested that you should enter into direct negotiations with Messrs.

The Foreign Office have not replied to that letter but in view ofthe time that has elapsed since it was written, we may, I think, thoughtthat, assuming the Foreign Office concurred in the breaking off of negotiations with Mohd.

This would save us from paying registration tax on this plot and would leave us free to offer the unencumbered plot ’B* for sale. Lieut.-Col. Daly proposes in para.5 of his letter that the terms on which this piece of land may be disposed of should be left to the Government of India to approve. The Government of India support his proposals and ask for telegraphic sanction. P.Z.2903/32 below it will be seen that we are very much in the dark regarding the history of this piece of land.

But if the urgency is imperative and the land must be vacated the following points may kindly be considered. 1. llie entire land on which our machinery is installed does not belong to the Consulate but the portion other than the Consulate land beongs to us. 2. The machinery was ordered expressly with a view a to help the British Government and it took more than years to construct the Building and to instal the machinery, it is, therefore, not possible to vacate the land within 3 mon ths. 3.

Passport of our representative Tayeb A1 i Sulemanji is not being granted and that is the greatest hinderence in our way to vacate the Consulate land, there being none belonging to our firm there to do so. If the Government is graciously pleased to grant our representative a temporary passport for a year only we shall be in a position to vacate the Government land and settle all the oustending matters, life are prepared to give any guarantee required for our representative for the period he will be there. 5. If Government is pleased to accept an equal portion of land in liu of Consulate land the question of vacating the same will not arise, because out of our land His Britannic Majestjls Consul can take charge of our land out of our Garden and thus amicably settle the matter. In acckdjct conclusion we respectfully beg to sutmit that this question can be amicably and quickly settled by:- Government granting our representative Tayeb Ali a passport or by taking over charge of land equal to the Consulate land out of our land in which garden is made, or by accepting market price for the Consulate land from us. Hoping this receives the kind consideration of the Government of India and His Britannic Majesty* s Consul General in Meshed. ♦ karachi, 2 2nd August 1933. l&amp;iclos. 2 .

Please see P.Z.2903/32. H.M.Consul, Seistan, has received no reply from Mohamed Ali Bros, to his enquiry as to the sum which they be prepared to offer for the land although a number of reminders have been sent. The prospect of receiving an offer of purchase from the firm, who have declared themselves bankrupt in Zabul, or from the Persian authorities, or from any other purchasers is extremely remote. In these circumstances Major Daly puts forward the following suggestions in his memorandum of 9th March to the G. of I. (P.Z.2196/33) for disposing of the property:- (a) that the Tehran Legation should itself try to interest the Persian authorities in the matter by suggesting that a reasonable offer to purchase the land and buildings would be accepted, (b) that a similar proposal should be made to the Afghan Govt. (c) that some scheme should be suggested to the Persian Government for combining the disposal of the Seistan property with the sale or exchange of the present premises of the Meshed Consulate General and transfer of the Consulate General to a more convenient site outside the town. The G.of I. request that the necessary enquiries may be made by H.M.Minister at Tehran from the Persian Government and the Afghan Embassy in regard to alternatives (a) and (b). They are not enthusiastic about (c) but are prepared to agree to a scheme on these lines, if Mr. Hoare sees any advantage in it, and/2. and on the terms laid down in their telegram of 11th October 1928 (P.5516/28), viz. on the understanding that no expenditure to Govemmenb will be involved and that no money will change hands. It will be remembered that the question of transferring the &lt; » » * Consulate General at Meshed to a new site outside the town was considered in 1929, but that very conflicting opinions were expressed on the subject by successive holders of the post of Consulate General and that the scheme was finally abandoned at that time (see Minute on P.5402/29). It may be the case, as Major Daly says, that the Consulate General is too large and expensive for present-day requirements, but it seems most undesirable that a proposal for getting rid of the present premises should be accepted without a thorough examination of the arguments at the present time for and against such a course. A hasty decision to dispose of the present buildings mi^it well be Ac a/vt, tXa-d. rrgnr^d at a later date when larger accommodation might again be required at Meshed. In any case there is no particular virtue in combining the present proposals with 4-he proposals in regard to the Meshed Consulate General and as the G. of I. say this would probably only complicate matters and further delay the disposal of the Consulate land at Zabul. Meanwhile the G.of I. desire to send Mohamed Ali Bros, three months’ notice to vacate their property (the firm has paid no rent since March 1931) A draft letter to the F.O. asking for their • • concurrence in this and deprecatingproposals to dispose of the Meshed Consulate General without further consideration is submitted. . * ie c. f&lt;r\ Cc^ &lt;f\.P.Z.2779/33 Draft Paper.

The firm has declared itself hankrupt in Zatml, and in order to clear a debt owing to the Persian I ili tary Department handed over their remaining assets in Sistan to the Tilitary Department in lieu of payment. It may he noted that in so doing, no claim whatever was made to any portion of the land, in which their building stands. This claim was only invented when they considered the possibility of purchasing the Consulate land, which they no longer appear desirous of doing, as they will make no offer and reply to no communication on the subject. In viewr of the circumstances, I thinx it extremely unlikely that the firm would institute a suit in Persia, but they are thoroughly unscrupulous and the possibility cannot be lost sight of. likelihood of a purchaser coming forward, and as previously explained to the Government of India, owing to the fact that there is no other freehold iana in Sistan, it is virtually impossible to estimate its value. Three alternatives occur to me;- (a) The local authorities wished to obtain sanction to make an offer for its purchase as an official residence for the Governor* but did not succeed. Is it possible that^ if a proposal were put forth by the Legation, that a reasonable offer would be accepted, that the Central authorities would be There does not at present, seem the slightest intere sted/interested in the matter? (h) Is there any likelihood of* a similar proposal to the Afghan Government heing productive of results ? The Afghan Gonsulate is a rentea oailding, and the site to he sold is the only freehold property in Sistan, and eminently suited for a Gonsulate. (c) Our Gonsulate General at Feshad is in the heart of the town. It is too large (and expensive in ’upkeep*) for present day requirements and I am convinced that the scheme, originally suggested hy the late Colonel Biscoe, hut abandoned hy his successor, to transfer the Gonsulate outside the town and to have modern and convenient buildings merits serious consideration. The difficulty is that the present site is too valuable for any individual to purchase, as a whole, except at a ’bargain* price, and in acquiring a new site, a fantastic price is always demanded for anything sold to the ’British Government*. 7ould it 09 possible to suggest to the Persian Government some scheme whereby vl) The oistan building and land be exchanged for an acceptable site on the outskirts of he shad, plus, if necessary, a cash payment, or ( 2 ) The Gistan building and lana, and the Feshad Gonsulate General, be given in exchange for an acceptable site at ’ eshad plus a cash payment which would cover the cost of erection of the necessary huildings. The Veshad site might be purchased by the I unicip&amp;lity and resold in plots at a pro!it. If, on the other hand, we ultimately decided to sell the Fes had Gonsulate General and acquire another site to expect ouildings, we should'be compelled, unless we were to dispose or it at a price well 'below market value, to sell it in plots, over an indefinite period, 'because no individual 'buyer is likely to 'be forthcoming and a •Syndicate* would not purchase at anything like its true value, and a •'bargain* such as that suggested above, would relieve us of the difficulties (l) of obtaining a site at reason able cost (2) of disposing of the present site and buildings without a series of transactions possibly extending over two or three years. I am fully aware that proposals (l) and ( 2 ) are not devoid of difficulty ana might not be acceptable to the Persians, (although I believe they would be attracted^ such proposals) but I regret I can see no other solution, in the event of a and 3 being unsuccessful, and we must face the prospect of the Sis tan land and buildings being on our hands for an indefinite period, fe unfortunately missed our opportunity of disposing of this land during the war, ..hen business in bis tan was flourishing and attractive offers were, I am informed, forthcoming. 5 • A c °py of this memorandum is being forwarded (f o. 20) to TT is Britannic Fajesty*s finis ter, Tehran.Memorandum . &gt;+5' 3 a 1 o o From ]Io.D.3218-N/82.

Memorandum . * Please refer to your D.3218-H/32 of 11th August 1932. Enquiry from the firm as to what sum they would be prepared to offer has elicited no reply. I am sending a reminder, but anticipate that no satisfactory reply will be received as the firm are bankrupt in Persia and if they bought the land and re-sold the premises the proceeds would no doubt be attached. I gather a representative on their behalf has however been making enquiries at Zabul to discover if a purchaser be forthcoming to whom they could sell at a profit, i would point out that the rent was purely nominal and the value put on the land, on this basis, is in my opinion too low. It is possible that the Persian Government may make an offer, as they are in search of a dwelling for the Official Residence of the Governor Zabul. 1 will not fail to report if any such offer be forthcoming. i wxhk Rax. ts. if any xnnfe b££blx be A copy of the Memorandum is being forwarded to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran.

Since there appears to be little chance either of the firm agreeing to purchase the land or of its being sold to the local Persian authorities, the best alternative appears to be to attempt to dispose of the property in the open market. Before proceeding vdth this suggestion, the Government of India would be glad to be informedt- (1) What amount of notice to vacate the property w-uld be regarded as reasonable in Sistan? (v ide Clause 2 of the Agreement dated 1st January 1912). (2) What action in regard to the buildings is likely to be taken by the firm on receiving notice to vacate, and is there any probability of a suit being instituted by the firm in respect of their value? (3) What likelihood is there of a purchaser coming forward, and can any estimate be given of the price likely to be realised from the sale of the^property? It is requested that information on these points may be supplied as soon as possible. A copy of this memorandum is being sent to His Majesty’s Minister Teheran. Sd.

Kennion, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain, No.8, for the week ending the 23rd February 1907. Having received instructions regarding the final settlement made with the Persian Government on the question of the apology and the land, I arranged a meeting with the Mumtahin, who came round this afternoon. I said that the apology, not being a personal matter, should be tendered by the local representative of the Persian Government to the local representative of His Britannic Majesty’s Government. A personal apology by Mir Masum Khan, who was no longer an official of the Persian Government, would obviously have no significance whatever. The Mumtahin said that his instructions were that Mir Masum Khan should come, and if I could not accept his apology, he would telegraph for further orders from the Persian Government. I requested him to do so. As regards the land, he said he would now inform the Persian Government that the amount demanded was 10,000 zars, and would ask instructions as to whether the price was to be settled here or at Tehran. When I told him the point had already been decided, he said that he had not been informed of it. I shall wait a few days to allow the Mumtahin time to receive a reply to his telegram before again troubling His Majesty’s Minister. 81 .

Since you h a ve, in fact, already Vacated it, this ie^uiiement will he considered to have ta^en immediate eflect from the date of this letter. foui statement that this Consulate had taken over charge of the building erected by you was incorrect. ihe terms oi your agreement did not admit ol your 1 sub letting the premises you had erected, at your own risk, on Consulate land, and trie Persian law regulating possession of land by ioreigners also does not permit of such sub-letting. Uhdei these circumstances the sub-letting by your local iepiesentative, without the approval of this Consulate was not permitted. This Consulate is in no way responsible for the buildings elected by ^you on the land, which however, by your vacation of the land, become the property*of His Majesty's Government. The removal of doors,, windows and other fixtures which would leave derelict buildings on the land of this Consulate cannot be permitted. If it be intended within a months, to entirely remoV' i“buildings and renasr the land vacant as it v^as received by you, this Consulate Vvill require the fixtures to he lodged in the Consulate, until such time as the * ho1e of the derelict buildings he removed from the Consulate land.

As you have repeatedly stated that your firm is bankrupt c*nd among other debts cannot refund a sum lodged by an employee of this Consulate oith you for Sale custody, your suggestion that the Consulate land might be sold to you is not being further considered.

In the circumstances stated by you, the Government of India have no objection to your ascertaining the market value of the land, which is not required for the Consulate, and offering it to the firm. Before, however, concluding the bargain, the highest offer may please be reported to them for concurrence. It would seem best if the firm purchase the land at its market price. It is not known if the alternative suggested by you, in case this is not agreed to by the firm, will be feasible as they may not accept the net amount that will be paid to them by way of compensation. The best course then would appear to be tc enforce clause (2) of the agreement entered into with the firm on the 1st January 1912, a copy of which was forwarded to the Government of India with your letter No.2363, dated the 20th/28th November I9i8, i.e., ask them to vacate the land for the use of Government. 3.

Building erected on Government land a at Sistan by Motyned All Bros. Sir, In forwarding herewith an application, dated the 19th March 1931, from Mohamed All Bros., I have the honour to state that the firm mentioned above erected a building on a portion of land belonging to Government in past years, for business, and agreed to pay the rent of land which is, every year, paid into Sistan Consulate @ ^ 18&lt; per annum. This land is situated outside i compound of the Sistan Consulate and w-s obta* from the Persian Government under the Shah ’r' | ,N iA foreign ' • v jiv. m ?^22J(JN.1931Firman as compensatio' for damages done to Government 'buildings by the Sistanis, several years ago. 2) The firm was prosperous for some time, but in a coining case almost all the partners were convicted, and only a few members of the family remained to conduct the business which his now been wound up in Sistan. Hitherto the rent has been regularly paid, but there will be difficulty in recovering it in future. I, therefore, beg to suggest that I may be authorised to ascertain the market value of the land, which is not required for the Consulate, and it may be offered to the firm. If they decide to purchase it at the rate, they will then be in a position to dispose of the whole property. If they decline the offer, Government should sell, the whole property, land and building, to the best advantage, and retain the market value of the land giving the balance to the ovners of the building as compensation. 3} I rnay point out, in this connection, that the building is not, required by the Consu late. In view of existing laws in Persia, we cannot continue to let it, and we do not wish to occupy the building as it is too costly to main tain. We have been able to make economical arrangements for housing of the Medical Officer and do not require it, as was once anticipated. In fact, the continued retention of this plotCQ,m« Sistan, Persia, March 19th,1931. To His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain.
