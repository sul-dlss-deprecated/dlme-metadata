Commander-in-Chief Middle East has recommended that petroleum Development Qatar should plug all wells drilled at Qatar and suspend drilling operations. After discussion with company it has been decided that, hkx owing to isolated position of Qatar and difficulty of maini- taining on spot adequate staff to ensure permanent destruc tion of wells at short notice, wells should be permanently plugg ed fo rthwith. Necessary rs orders will be issued to ( company representatives by C.-in-C. Middle East through you. 2. There is no concessionary obligation to drill but company expect that Sheikh will show displeasure at their suspension of drilling operations as Article S of Concession requires them to explore area minutely for the purpose of discovering oil. 3. Qatar has been fully explored geologically and no {maritim0additional work of that t^ture can be offered as ubstitute^njcoinj of object of concession which is discover; and exploitation of oil , and which can be accomplished only by drilling. Cf**' 4. Article 15 of Concession recognizes delay in oper ations occasioned by force majeure occurring in connection with company’s operations in Qatar. This would appear to cover suspension of osperations on orders from n. G. 5. In these circumstances it is suggested that in order to safeguard company’s interests Sheikh should be informed that for reasons connected with the War Effort d H.M.G. have ordered company temporarily to suspend operation’ These will be resumed so soon as would conditions are more propitious. In order to avoid possible future trouble between company and SheilA-it might also be desirable to IG ®„Mvfc03( '3 obtain from him his written recognition of the state • it */ . x - of interruption of company’s operations.

When you have digested its contents and thought out its implications, will you please ring me up, and I will come round to your office to discuss action to be taken. 1 suggest that no action be taken pending such discussion.

Packer Esquire, Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd., Bahrain.Keference the followiiig telegrams:- - No.1U901 dated 19th June 1912 from India Office, x, &gt; — No. 1193 dated 22nd June 1942 from Political Resident. j No.11137 dated 22nd June 1942 from India Office. — Un 25th June I met Mr. Packer (Manager of Petroleum y f r' ri Development (Qatar) Limited) Mr. Dickson (Engineer in Charge) and Mr. Lermitte (Assistant Manager) to discuss the situation arising out of the decision that the Company should suspend drilling oper ations in Qatar and should close down its activities after dealing wit with the two oil wells the drilling of which has been completed. 1. Plugging of '^ells. The Political Agent explained that the prinainnart* plugging of the Company*s two wells by the methods explained by Major Boaden should be undertaken immediately. Mr. Dickson explained that it would take a minimum of two months and a maximum of three months to deal with the wells in the manner desired. This period was rather long because (a) their present equipment was at well No.3 fa salt water well which need not be dealt with) and would have to be moved to well No.2; and (b) the present equipment was not capable of doing the work quickly. ±n order to expedite the work it was decided that the additional equipment required should be supplied from Iraq. If it was not available from Iraq - and Mr.Griffiths, who is shortly visiting Bahrain, will know what the position is in this respect - efforts will be made to borrow what is required from the Bahrain Petroleum Company or the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. In any case work would begin at once with such equip ment as was available. Ii. Personnel. (a) American. American personnel employed by the Company # comorises four drillers and one geologist, They are under contract to serve Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. or associated companies. If their services are not required by the associated companies efforts would be made to obtain offers of employment from India, / from- 2 - from the California Arabian Standard Oil Company or the Bahrain Petroleum Company. if these offers are not accepted by the per sonnel concerned there will be no alternative but permitting them to return to the U.3.A. (b) British. British personnel are 10 in number. ± informed Mr. Packer that there was little or no possibility of any of these men being able to return to England. Those who are not absorbed by associated companies will be found employment with other oil companies. (c) Goanese and Indians, nists of those who cannot be absorber! by associated companies will be s ent to other oil companies in case they wish to offer them employment. Those who do not secure other employment will be given the following terms. (1) Passage to India will be paid. (2) One month^s pay (including War Allowance) will be given, to count from the date of arrival in India. (3) All leave due will be given. The terms offered to Indians or Goanese joining another company will be (1) One month’s pay (including War Allowance) (2) Amount of leave due. No passage to India will be given and this would have to be guaranteed by the new employer. (d) Local employees. These will be discharged with one month’s pay as a gratuity. III. Closing Down. It was agreed that the Company’s first duty must be to deal with the two completed wells. Subsequently they could dispose of personnel and equipment. It was pointed out that all drilling equipment must be removed from Qatar and that nothing should be left which could be of any conceivable use to the enemy. Mr. Packer asked that, in my correspondence with the Shaikh, I should lay particular emphasis on his respon sibility to guard any equipment etc. which might be left. / 4.-3- © IV. Correspondence. it was agreed that the Political Agent and the Company should work in close collaboration in respect of any letters exchanged with the Shaikh. un the 27th June 1 discussed with Ih?.Packer a few additional points, i. Guards. allowance. The pay of the guard commander is ks 200/-. Mr. tion of any equipment that is ( left, y guards should be employed for the protection of the camp and stores. He is prepared, a maximum of 15 guards. if the Shaikh will not guarantee the protection of the camp and stores they will be removed. IX. Payments to Shaikh. employees. The Company will not be able to retain their services. This will be something of a blow to the Shaikh, to his son Shaikh Hamad, and to Saleh A1 Mana who all make something out of the provision of local labour. ihe Company also pays Ksl25u/- a month to two local representatives appointed by the Shaikh. i understand that Shaikh Hamad gets ks 1,000/- of this and Saleh A1 Mana Ks 250/-. The Company are 1 . 'aUUra.b * At present the Company employs 3^ guards and one guard commander. Pay of the guards is ks 30/- plus Ps 15/- ratioi Packer proposes that, if the Shaikh will guarantee the protee- if bargaining with the Shaikh is necessary, to retain up to At present the Company employs about 3o0 local / preparedprepared to continue these payments if necessary. ihe Company are also prepared to pay the Customs Officer at Zakrit his usual salary and also the head guard on ks 200/- per mensem. These payments will, however, only be made if the Shaikh’s attitude is satisfactory. Similarly the Company will continue to pay the rent of the house which they lease at Dohah. The Company will also allow the Shaikh to keep the ice plant which he has borrowed from them. The Company are not prepared to give any advance on account of possible future royalties. The Company will continue to pay the Shaikh the sum of ks 3,00,000/- annually and also the 2,000 tins of petrol and 3,000 tins of kerosene to which he is entitled under the Supplementary Agreement of May 1935. he met Mr. Packer that the treatment of the wells which is being undertaken must be regarded essentially as a measure of conser The Political Agent emphasised on both occasions when vation rather than of destruction^ 28th June 1942.Copy Ko object:- Oil Denial - QATiiH.. \ v v&gt;^ * B.

Method of making payments# Under the concession the Company has the right to make all concession payments into the hastem Bank, Bahrain, and the Bank s leceipt is in full discharge of the concession obligation This method would suit us excellently for the future.

Request immediate issue of those orders which Company are ready to execute on receiving word from me. Political.Secret. D.6.!fo,C/971 . The Agency, Bahrain, the 5th July 1942. I enclose for your information a copy of a letter dated 3rd July 1942 whileh I sent to the Shaikh of Qatar before I left Dohah on the 3rd July. I will let you have a copy of his reply as soon as I receive it* 2. 1 explained to the Shaikh that owing to conditions caused by the War His Majesty’s Government have found it necessary to direc your Compary to suspend temporarily their operations st«r. I also explained that, in order to ensure that the enemy could neither destroy nor make use of the oil in Qatar, it would be necessary for your Company to seal the two existing wells. The Shaikh, when the reasons for the action taken had been explained to him, made no pro test and appeared to accept the position with resignation. I inform ed the Shaikh that the Company would continue to make the annual Concession payment of Rupees three lakhs, that it would continue to pay the salaries of the Shaikh's two representatives and that, in lieu of petrol and kerosene, the usual annual payment of fcl3,250/ would be made. 3. 1 informed the Shaikh that the Company would be unable to employ any labour as they were closing down, and he accepted this without comment. When the question of guards came up the Shaikh expressed himself most vehemently and said that, unless the number of guards was retained at the present figure (which he said was 3b including tv/o on the house at Dohah) he would be unable to acceot any responsibility for looking after the Company* s property. Dis cussion on this point was somewhat heated. The Cor par.;,' 1 s obliga tions as defined by Article 11 of the Concession were discussed / from E.V. Packer Esquire, . # _ ■ t T +&gt;i Manager, Petroleum Development (Qatar; l/ta., Bahrain.f - 2 - from different angles| but the Shaikh remained adamant. The Shaikh also brought up the following questions (1) pay of the guide (Mansour) (2) pay of the Director of Customs,ZekrIt (3) pay of the guard commander (4) rent of the house at Dohah (5) launch service to Bahrain. In regard to pay of the Direct or of Customs the Shaikh insisted that the post should be retained He said it was unreasonable that the Company should abolish the post since they were only suspending operations temporarily; and he threatened that, if the Company did not continue to pay the Director of Customs at Zakrit he would insist, when the Company resumed operations, that they should import their supplies through Dohah. The Shaikh also expressed anxiety about the launch ser vice, saying that if this service we^e denied to him Qatar would be wholly severed from communication with Bahrain and from postal facilities. 4. As the Shaikh was so uncompromising in regard to con cessions and services given by the Company which are not covered by regular agreements I did not inform him of the extent to which the Company was willing to meet him. In the end I suggest ed to the Shaikh that we should put in writing what had been r ^ agreed to and that, in regard to the rest, he should write to me and tell me what he desired the Company to do. The Shaikh agreed to this and T thereupon sent to him the letter of which a copy is enclosed. I did not press for a reply before I left Dohah as I was sure that the Shaikh wanted to have time before formula ting his demands. Yours sincerely, HVSECRET . No.C/969.

I expected him to become reconciled to the position if the maximum shock were administered first, and alleviation given later. I accordingly sent him a letter, No.C/924 dated 28th June 1942, of which I enclose a copy. 4. Before leaving for Qatar I ascertained exactly what payments the Oil Company were prepared to continue to make to the ^ „ &amp; tj' Shaikh; and I enclose a copy of the 'brief which Mr .Packer / gave- 2 - gave me in this connexion* 5. An account of my negotiations with the Shaikh is contains- Vs in my Secret demi-official letter to Mr. Packer No.C/971 dated 5th July 1942, a copy of which, together with its enclosure, is forward ed for information. the two oil wells (Nos. 1 and 2) must be closed, laying stress on the danger that if they were not closed an enemy could destroy the whole oil field. He saw the point of this argument, and did not contest its validity. In regard to the Company suspending opera tions, the Shaikh agreed that it would be stupid to plug completed wells and at the same time continue drilling new ones. I also told him that equipment was not available for continued operations. The Shaikh, as I had hoped, appeared to accept this position with resignation. But I did not try to secure an immediate written recognition of the position as he would at once have become sus picious that he was Getting himself in' for something, and that I was duping him. 7 , It was when other Issues were discussed that the Shaikh became really heated. He was not prepared to accept a reduction in the number of guards employed by the Company, and was equally unaccommodating over other side-issues. I do not think, however, that these smaller questions matter very much, and they can probabl be settled by negotiation. Much depends on the reply which the Shaikh gives to my letter of 3rd July. I explained to Saleh al Mana, the Shaikh’s Secretary, the form which I expected the reply to take, and he promised his assistance. I do not, however, place any reliance on his promises, and I am as yet unable to say whether my visit to Qatar was successful or not in its major object. I explained to the Shaikh in great detail the reasons why^ETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT CODES : BENTLEY’S SECOND PHRASE (QATAR) LIMITED DIRECTORS: WaP-CAUWER. -&lt;CllAIRMR»t) . G. LEOH-JONES, J. B. A.

The Ruler*a letter appears to oonsist of two parts:* (a) The observation that Instrue* tions to the Company to suspend opera* tions is not prorided for under Article 15 of the Company v s Concession, but there is some Justification for it. it) A request for an assurance by tae P.A. that the Company, in addition to certain fixed obligations laid down in the Con* cession or in the Addendum thereto, will continue certain other payments and facilities entered into after the coEomenoement of operations. In exchange for such an assurance the Ruler is prepared to admit that there is such justification for H.B.II. , s action in suspending operations. 2. Para 1(a) does not seem to call for any comment by the Company. Para 1(b) is dealt with in detail in para (3).£ - (i) Salary of tba Director of CuBtcxaa, Ze&amp;hrlt - Ha.ISO/* per aensem - paid direct to the Shaikh. (ii) Salary of the head guide (Mansur) - Rs.100/- per mensea, paid direct to the Shaikh, plus Rs.60/- per eumsem ration allowance paid to Mansur. (iii) Payment of rent of house at Dohah - Ra.1000/- per annum plus the salary of one guard Re.45/- per mensem. (The Ruler is asking for salaries of j other guards and servants which the Company considers unreasonable during the suspension period). (!▼) Salaries of one head f/uerd (Hs.gQO/- per mensem) 'and a certain number or guards for Dukhan and ^eknrlt at Rs.45/- per inenaea per lead, ns.do/- plus «s.15/- ration allowance) . All guards* salaries and ration allowances are paid direct to the Shaikh. (The Ruler appears from his letter to be claiming salaries of all the guards at present employed (some 54). The Company maintains that a reduced number only, e.g., 12 , is reasonable in the suspension period and any excess over this is unreasonable)• unications between the Manager . er: This is a reasonable request provided the Ruler does not expect the Company to provide him with stores, oar parts, etc., from Bahrain. One visit every quarter should be sufficient for all purposes.- 1 » (▼i) Trangport between Dohah and Dukhan Tho Company would pay for reasonable camel hire or purchase to supply with- guards and other camp staff with water and rations* It is unreasonable to expect the Company to run motor conroys as maintenance would be a serious problem* The Company would be prepared to meet requests on the above lines* Unreasonable ler^ndB for parents and U) L alntenaflo* of g iard* at 'operaUooa' See b(iv) above* (The Company also takes the view that it is the Shaikh^ flag which protects the e^mp and the number of guards is quite immaterial. Unfortunately, the Shaikh profits to the extent of some Rs,20/- per heed per mensem froa the guards* salaries and this gives him a keen interest in pressing for as many as possible* His original idea was a force of a thousand or more with hie eon Hamid as CKO.C* drawing an appropriate salary* It must be remembered that this guards* qufcstio^ is a very sore point with the Ruler and can easily lead to a deadlock* (ii) Provision of a Bahraln/Qatar mail service &amp;&gt;r Do hah It is obviously unreasonable to expect the Company to maintain a- 4 - regular avail and parcel service inrolviag the use of oars and launches for the benefit of the Ruler of Qatar* The occasional contacts neces sary between Qatar Government and Bahrain could be maintained by launch from Dohah to Bahrain as in the days before the Company commenced the operations. (iii) Unnecessar y staff in Dohah Company house : Although this is a minor point it is obviously unreasonable. ^ sre is no necessity to keep a servant and a sweeper and more than one j guard in a house which will not be used for a long period. .. My) Wofei ^ ^ * 3&gt;vJcL ^ (^/ UL 4. Qmisaiona by t ha Rule^: (a) The Ruler se€ma to take it for granted that the Company will send him the monies in cash (silver) due to him in respect of Concession payments and special salaries and will not taxe edventag. of Artlcl. £0 of th. Concaeion which parmlta the Company to discharge its Con cession obligations through the medium of th. Ksstern Bsnk, Bahrsln. * ( b ) A minor omission Is th. question of | the les mschine in Dohah. The Company would be prepared to hand thla over to the Sheikh but would not eupply »n engine attendant, ; fuel or other maintenance.In general, it la believed that agree ment can be reached with the Ruler on the majority of the points covered in this note with the possible excep tion of the number of guards. Where the Shaikh has obviously no rights and little justification for his demands it may be necessary for the Company to refuse certain demands quite definitely. In such circum stances the Shaikh has a right presumably to ask for arbitration. Experience inclines the Company to believe that he is unlikely to take this course specially whan he knows he has a weak case and can antioip- j ate losing his case. In controver sial xaatters he may be expected, as a last resort only, to accept the advice of the Political kgent, if it is against his own inclinations. If the Company is to be permitted to settle or attempt to settle its affeirs with the Ruler it would be an advantage if the Company could be informed of the P.A.*! attitude to these various demands raised by the Shaikh and if, in ths event of a deadlock, he is prepared to offer t, e Sheikh his opinions and advice. A final point which should be r ruy in mind and which is not without importance is that any concession made or facility provided by the Company- 6 - for the 3haiUl , * oonvenienoo or comfort i« iniaediately regarded by the Ruler e» « permanent right. The carriage of aaile from Bahrain to Dohah and rice rerea la a typical case in point. This facility ori«* glaated in an arrangement that Dohah letters and parcels could be sent by the launch and car service provided by the company for its own business. There has never been an agreement that the Company would provide special transport for Dohah malls. The Ruler, however, now takes the attitude that the Company Is under s - i fixed obligation to provide special transport if necessary for his mail. There is no Justification for this attitude. It may bs of interest to note hers that the Shaikh’s demands can all be settled without reference to | the Company's Horsham principals except (a) continuance of guards at full strength sad (b) provision by the Company of a Dohah/Zekhr it/Bahrain mail service for the benefit of thg Qatar Government. In the event of reference to Horsham becoming necessary it would facilitate the decision if the views and recommendations of the Political Agent could bs quoted.1.40. 131 ' CODES : BENTLEY'S SECOND PHRASE (P PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (QATAR) LIMITED DIRECTORS: .

T-IS 20TH JULY. 1942 - The next stage in the matter of the suspension of Q,atar operations is the Company's formal reply to the P.A.'s No.c/1033 forwarding the ShaiKh of Qatar's letter dated the 11 th July, 1942. After discussion on the 20th July, it was agreed that the Shaikh's interpretation of the position at the time he wrote his ahovementioned memo, was, according to the translation by the Agency translator, as follows «f The suspension o^operations was not provided for under Article 15 of the Company's Concession but there was some justification for it. In exchange for an assurance by the P.A. that the Company, in addition to certain fixed obligations laid down in the Concession or in the Addendum thereto, will continue certain other payments and facilities entered into after the commencement of operations, the Ruler is prepared to admit that there is such justification for H.B.M.'s action in suspending the operations. Presumably he will put this admission in writing to the P.A. in dus course. It was agreed that it might be possible to induce the Shaikh to sign the admission or acknowledgement required by the P.A. by conceding some part of the Shaikh's demands. To enable the P.A. to proceed with this plan the various demands were discussed and the Company's views on each recorded. 1. Concession Obligations : It was agreed that the Company was prepared to continue (a) Annual Concession payment (Rs. 3 lacs per annum). (b) Cash in lieu of petrol and oil allowance (Rs.13250/- p.a.). (c) Combined salaries of the Ruler's two representatives (Rs.1250/- per mensem). It was agreed that the P.A. in his next approach to the Shaikh would work on the assumption that these payments would be continued. In fact, the Shaikh in his letter to ta© P.A. assumes that the P.A. has already informed him verbally that these obligations will be met. 2. Shaikh's demands for the continuance of payments or facilities which have arisen subsequent to the opening of o perations Tad which are not obligatory as the Company Is not bound by any agreement or contract ; (a) Salary of the Director of Customs, Zekhrit, (Rs.150/- per mensem) - the Company agree to pay. (b) Salary of the head guide, Mansur, (Rs.100/- p.m.) - the Company agree to pay. # (c) Payment of rent of house at Dohah, (Rs.1000/- per annum) plus the salaries of guards and 'those stationed there' -** 2 '* V the Company agree to pay rent plus salary of one ^uard only and no servants. This house Is used by occasional Company visitors only, and the salary of servants la paid for the comfort of Company guests only. If ti e Company does not want tha servants and cannot use them it is obviously unreasonable for the Shaikh to expect salaries to be paid. He might Just as weii argue that servants and labourers in the camp who cannot now be employed must be paid for the duration of the war. It is observed that in the Arabic there is no definite mention of servants - presumably 'those stationed there'. (It is strange that the ¥.k.* translation uses 'servants' - doubtless servants were mentioned at Riyan and remained in the translator s subconscious memory). Copy of P.C.L. translation attached. It would seem fairly obvious taat the word 'servants' has been deliberately omitted in the letter as it is ridiculous that the Shaikh should try to control the Company’s servants. The Company can surely please itself as to whether any or no servants are kept for the use of the employees. (d) Salaries of one head guard (Tin.ZOO/- p * r certain number of guards for / nd ' Infi^Rs 15 /. Ra.45/- per mensem per head, (Rs.30/- pay plus Rs.15/ ration allowance) - the Company agree to pay the head guard and 15 guards. The Company considers this number is sufficient for the suspension period, and It is reasonable to reduce the number of guards when the camp is closed. The Shaikh always insists that guards are necessary whenever expansion occurs. hen operations become less, the The Shaikh seems to work on the line that heads he wins and 'tails' the Company loses. It was agreed. however, between the P.A. and the Company that the Shaikh is particularly excitable ^nd obstinate on^the subject of his guards and this question should not be allied to cr.«t. a d.adlock .hould th. Shaikh pro*, am.nahla in all other matters. (e) Communications &gt; ( The Shaikh’s demands amount to (i) Weekly launch from Bahrain to Zekhrit and vice versa carrying mails. (ii) Cars (vehicles) to connect with these launches between Zekhrit and Dohah. fiiil These vehicles will also be available both for ,Ui) Sn!, transport of guards and guards’ provisions. Th. Company would he prepared to ® between Bahrain and Zekhrit onceamonth. TOeywould not « to suddIv cars between Zekhrit and Dorian e ither IO * Mils or guards’ Jobs. The Company would, however, consider the provision of either ( 1 ) monthly cash allowance for camel hire. Amount to be assessed by the Company on camel hire rates to cover two Journeys between nnh.h and Dukhan every month or(11) cash allowance for lorry hire for two journeys a month. Amount to be assessed at recognised rates by a qualified Company transport officer. These allowances are for guards' jobs only and the Company accepts no responsibility between Zekhrit and Dohah for the carriage of mails. The Company wish to make it quite clear that neither in the past, present, nor future haYe they accepted, nor will they accept responsibility for the carriage of Qatar Government mails. The fact that they have carried them in the past when vehicles could be spared or when vehicles were going to Dohah on other Company business does not bind the Company in any way. (iv) The Manager, Bahrain,will visit the Ruler periodically when necessary or some useful purpose can be served. Reference the above demands it was agreed between the P.A. and Mr.Packer that at this stage at least it could be conveyed to the Ruler that the Company would under no circumstances (a) supply and maintain cars or other motor vehicles for a service between Dohah and Dukhan as this will entail considerable maintenance and garage staff. (b) accept any responsibility for Qatar mails except carrying them once monthly on the launch, between Bahrain and Zejchrit. Such mails would be delivered to the Shaikh's representative at Zekhrit and mails for Bahrain accepted from him. It was agreed that in the Company's letter to the P.A. dealing with the Shaikh's demands the Company should invoke Article 20 of the Agreement and point out to the Shaikh that the Company is within its rights in paying all sums due to the Shaikh into the Shaikh's account with the Eastern Bank, Ltd., Bahrain, and the receipt taken from the Bank is a full acquittance of the Company's liability. At present the facility which the Company is providing of bringing silver from Bombay end transport it to Qatar involves the Company in additional charges fluctuating in these days from Rs.20,000/- to Rs.30,000/- on 3 lacs, i.a., it costs the Company Re.3,30,000/- to pay the Shaikh the 3 lacs in silver.• •.

I thank Your Excellency for all the trouble taken and the interest shown for the common weal# If then I should reply to Your Excellency regarding the matter referred to, my reply would depend upon one side of the question only# As for the other things which the Company has so far been undertaking, such as General Payments, these would continue as heretofore# I told this to Your Excellency during my discussions with you in this regard, and some of it was affirmed by Your Excellency yourself, particularly as regards the Annual Concession Payments, the Payments made in lieu of kerosene k petrol, and the Monthly Sal curies of the two (official) Representatives. Although I feel so grateful for Your Excellency 1 s good will and the attention paid to the essential points in this matter pointed out by me, I have verbally explained to Your Excellency the necessity for the continuance of the other payments, end also the continuance of the communication and transport systems that have been so far in force. I confirm these hereby to Your Excellency Thus, in addition to the Annual Payments affirmed by Your Excellency, the Payments in lieu of kerosene k petrol and the Monthly Salaries of the two (official) Representatives, the following also should continue: 1# The salary of the Director (of Customs) at Zekrit 2. The salary of the Guide to continue as heretofore. 3. The Guards, whom I pointed out to Your Excellency, to remain at their post, the payment of their salaries and the continuance of all arrangements conceded so far in their favour.4# &lt; 3h* payment of the rent of the Company House at Dohah and the salaries of the guards and others # stationed there, aa heretofore. 5. The oontlnuanoe of the ooxamunl oat Ions existing between us and H.:.M. f s Government, and between us and the Manager of the Company at Bahrain, as here tofore, as well as the Mall Service by the Company. 6. Arrangements for the organization and regular main tenance of these (communications and mall service) to be undertaken and continued by the Company. 7. One transport or two to be left for running between Dohah and the Camp; and the carrying of mails, guards and their provisions to oontlnus as heretofore. This is the least to be expected if, as Your Excellency yourself affirm the situation is difficult and by no means to be welcomed by us. This is quite true, and we have explained to Your Sxcellenoy in our discussion everything, and have made all points clear. Should then Your Excellency confirm that all that I have stated to you (above) will be undertaken, and that there exists no doubt as to their validity, then only can what you have verbally stated find Justification. In conclusion, 1 look forward to a reply (from you) confirming that *hat I have stated above will be undertaken.

In subsequent discussions, however, attention was drawn to the fact that this labour is of a somewhat casual nature and the amount of service varies considerably. In these circumstances it was decided that the gratuity should be assessed on the basis of one week’s pay for each year’s service up to a maximum of four weeks’ pay. We propose to work on this basis.

We have the honour to refer to your letter C/l0o5 dated the 14th July 1942 forwarding a copy of a letter m /Arabic (with an English translation) dated the 11th July 1942 from the Shaikh of Qatar,\ and our subsequent discussion on the 20th July 1942. \ ^ r £ It is noted that the Ruler takes the view that the suspension of operations as directed by H.B.M.*s Goyernmen is not provided for under Article 15 of the company s Concession but there is some justification for it. In flxohanffe however, for an assurance by the Political xigent that the Company in addition to certain fixed obligations S: (laid down in the^Concession or in the ''letter attached /Wa ito signed by Chas. C. Mylles dated the 17th May 19o5, will ' ' oontime certain other payments and facilities entered in o after the commencement of operations, we gather tha Ruler is prepared to admit that there is such jus for H.B.M.’s action in suspending the operations. It is presumed that the Ruler will then be prepared t^ put thll iZ^lon in writing to the Political Agent in due course. 4 We confirm herewith the Company’s views on the points raised in°the Shaikh’s letter and the extent to which the fompanv is prepared, at this stage m your negotiations with ?£”er? to Ifel tte requests laid down in his letter dated the 11th July 1942. , r*C/3135 (contd.) 5. Concession Obligations The Company is prepared to continue the fixed obligations referred to in para E as under (a) Annual Concession payment (Rupees Three lacs per annum) (b) Cash in lieu of petrol and oil allowance (RS.13E50/- per annum). (c) Combined salaries of the Ruler’s two represen tatives (RS.1E50/- per mensem). 6 . Shaikh’s demands for the continuance of payments or facilitiVs which have arisen subsequent to the open ing of operations and which are not obligatory as the Company is not bound by any agreement or c ontract (i) Salary of Director of Customs, Zekrit - The Company agree to continue this. (ii) Salary of the head guide, Mansur - The Company agree to pay. (iii) Guards - It is gathered that in the Shaikh|s^ ^ third”demand he is insisting on all the existing guards being retained. The supplies he mentions, which is translated by the P.C.L. translator as ’’arrangements”, refer probably to water, kerosene and possibly transport arrangements for the guards and their rations between Dohah and Dukhan, although this is duplicated in his No.7. Article 11 of the Concession says the guards ’’should be sufficient in number”. The Company takes the view that the head guard and 15 guards are sufficient for the suspension period and 30 odd are excessive. The Shaikh has always taken the view that expansion of operations necessitates expansion of guards. It is reasonable to argue that a reduction in operations should mean a reduction in guards. The Company’s su SS®^ t ^ n +h is that the Ruler should be asked to agree to the retention of the head guard and 15 guards for theC/3133 (contd.) suspension period, the number to he increased to the present strength when operations are resumed. It was agreed between the Company and the Political Agent that the Shaikh is particularly excitable and obstinate on the suboect of his guards and this question should not be allowed to create a serious deadlock should the Shaik prove amenable in all other matters. (iv) Pent of the Company house at Dohah and certain wag;es of those wh o are in it. The Company agree to pay the rent and wages of one guard. The Arabic letter quotes all those wf£ are in it-. The Company are not prepared to pay servants* w ^es or the wages an engine attendant on the ice-plant if the Shaikh is thinking of such personnel. We have no comment on the communications mwtcS SK sXia. that such communications existed before Company arrived in Qatar. The Manager, Bahrain, vd 11 visit the Ruler periodically * en ^f 3a ^ e °c 0 ™ cl indertahe purposes A j^nxcept carrying ?hem e once ionthS on a\aunch between Bahrain and Zekrit. Such mails will be delivered to Shaikh’s representative^at Zekrit an m Bahrain accepted from him. (Vi) ^d putfthe responsibility 9 for t all^communications ^e^enrtfwhich^the Company°is prepared to assist as regards mails and visits is given m para (v) above. • • •C/3133 (contd.) (vii) Communications - Doha/Dukhan The Shaikh asks for one or two motor vehicles to he detailed. The purposes of these vehicles as far as we can gather or assume are as follows (a) Communications - miscellaneous - between Dohah and Dukhan to cover visits by the Shaikhs or their representatives and local letters. (b) Transport of Bahrain or foreign mails. (c) Transport of guard reliefs and guard provi sions from Dohah to Dukhan. The Company takes the view that, as far as the Company is concerned, any communications necessary and for which the Company accept any responsibility at all can be arranged by camel tremsport to connect with the monthly launch service as regards Bahrain or other foreign mails. The Company will pay for this monthly camel service on reasonable and recognized rates - cost to be assessed by the Company. The Company will also pay for one visit per month by the Shaikh’s representative also at a cost to be estimated by the Company based on camel or car hire. These cash allowances are for security purposes only. Under no circumstances' will the Company be prepared to (a) supply and maintain cars or other motor vehicles for a service between Dohah and Dukhan, (b) accept responsibility for Qatar mails except carrying them once monthly on the launch between Bahrain and Zekrit. 7. During the discussion between the Political Agent and the Manager (P.D.Q.) on tte 20th July 1942 it was brought to notice that the Shaikh has omitted to mention the method of payment of the periodical concession payments by the Company. It was agreed that the Company’s right under Article 20 of the Concession to pay all sums due to the5 C/3133 (conoid.) Shaikh into the Shaikh’s account with the Eastern Bank Ltd., Bahrain, might he raised with advantage with the Ruler if he proved particularly unreasonable in other matters, and it could be emphasised that payment in silver in Q,atar involves the Company in additional charges fluctuating in these days from Rs.20000/- to Rs.30000/- on Rs. 3 lacs in insurance and freight. 8 . Should a situation arise in which it becomes necessary for the Company to meet the Shaikh on the questions of guards and the motor service it will be necessary for the Company to refer to its principals in England by telegram. 9. In conclusion, we suggest that it may be made clear to the Shaikh that any of the above commitments outside the Concession fixed obligations (vide para 5), whether continu ance of existing facilities or new ones created by the present situation, apply to the suspension period only and the Company reserves the right to cancel any or all of them on the resumption of operations as circumstances direct. Furthermore, he should realize that the possibility of the continuance of such facilities even during the suspension period is largely dependent upon war conditions remaining unchanged, and any serious deterioration might make it impossible for the Company to carry on with its services to the Shaikh. In such a contingency the Company would regard itself as automatically released from responsibility for such services and no form of compensation could be considered.

The Company will also pay for the cost of one visit a month to the Camp by your representative for purposes of inspection. The cost of this monthly visit will be fixed by the Company on the basis of car or camel hire. In the circumstances now existing I think that this is the most that the Company can be expected to do, and I am sure that, when you have thought the matter over, you will agree that the Company's proposal is fair and reasonable. 8 . The Company have also raised the question of the method by which the annual sum of Rs. 3 . 00.000 should be paid to you. Under Article 20 pf the Agreement this sum is to be paid into your account vfith the Eastern Bank Limited Bahrain. This year the money was paid to you in silver, after I had granted a special export licence and after the Company had spent more than Rs.20,000 in obtaining the sliver required, whether the Company should continue to make payment to you in rupees (at such great expense to themselves and going beyond the terms of the Agreement) is a matter on which I shall not be prepared to offer them advice until all other questions have been satisfactorily settled. o111 fl U V GOVERNMENT OF INDIA Department. fyf , ay 0 'EXPRESS LETTER (AIR MAIL).

Your Honour doubtlessly remember the conversation v/hich took place between us concerning this matter on the 2nd and referred ^ ftlW : ^ 3rd July 1942. When you xs:Dss£to Article 15 of the agreement I explained to you that if we were to observe the said Article we would not find anything in it now bearing on the suspension of the Company’s operations. As you have noticed the said Article refers to the ’’force majeure” that might take place in Qatar but says nothing about what may happen in other places. You will see that no ’’force majeure' has taken place in Qatar necessitating the suspension of the Company's operations. It can be known from the agreement itself what is to be done should the Company stop their operations and thus act in contravention with the provisions of Article 15 of the agreement. When you yourself, during - {i-j i our conversation, perused the provisions of the said a j Article and asked me hot to demand a rigid application owing to the present circumstances I could not stick to the acquiesced L terms of the Article but in your request and fell in with your wishes in the matter of according facilities leaving aside the provisions of the above article. But I explained to you that I will lose many things on account of this and stipulated that the things which I mentioned in my conversation should be granted and then I confirmed in my p v ■ _ letter of JQCth Jamad Thani 1361 ( X^ You promised to take up the matter with the Company and do your best in getting them. I thank you for discussing the matter with the Company and have no doubt that I will easily get all the things I mentioned in view of the great facilities v/hich I have afforded to the Company and my cooperation with them which has facilitated their work. During our conversation I informed you that among the assistance and facilitiesT1 H which I afrorded to the Company was that I allowed them tempo rarily to lana their materials at Zil^rit, while according to the agreement should have landed them at Doha. In doing so I wanted to make matters easier for the Company as I was sure that the Company will appreciate it. Secondly I used to rely on their own statement regarding the articles which they have imported at Zikrit such as provisions, drinks, clothings and every dutiable thing and I did not set up a department to recorded check these things and reorad number and kind for the purpose Ox imposing duty on them as is done in all other places. This is besides the cooperation and other numerous facilities which I had afforded them. Inspite of all this if the Company did ^ trifle thing, which they are bound to do by reasons of mututal cooperation, they consider it a favour as they say about such a small matter as the mail. I do not deny the Company's cooperation with me, and appreciate the facilities rendered by them v/hich is incumbent upon the parties who are working for their mutual benefit, but I am sorry to notice that the Company is considering the mutual assistance as a favour by them,adisregarding the assistance given by me to them. I hope that the wise Manager of the Company will realize tills as he is a man of excellent character. Although I have already expressed to you my gratitude and appreciation for the serious interest you are taking in this matter I have already explained to you that the suspension of the Company’s operations will be a hard blow on a large number of my subjects most of whom are poor and are dependent on the Company's work for their livelihood. There is no doubt that their deprivation of their work will have a bad effect on them and as I have stated will cause a great deal of unemployment. Inspite of this I have to comply with your request to smoothen | matters for the Company as usual, but at the same time it is the duty of the Company to be lenient with us, as we have been to them, and realizes according to justice that Neither my demands are nerw nor-.are they wanted from them as a favour, but most of them are being carried out according to agreements »-3- agreements have nothing to do with the concession agreement, but were made later as a result of discussions between me and the Manager and I considered them as right, v/hich cannot be waived. In my conversation with you I explained to you that it is necessary that they should remain as before. I have to thank you on this occasion for explaining what I had said to you to the Company. You stated in your letter that the Company have agreed to some of the demands and we are now nearing an understanding. I hope that the Company, through your mediation, will agree to the other matters as they are of no importance. (1) The Company has agreed to continue payment of the pay of the Director of Zikrit, the guide and the Guard Commander, but thought of reducing the number of the guards to 15. It is not possible for me to agree to this as it is one of the most important and necessary matters. Article 11 states that there should be 'sufficient guards' and I see that the present number of guards is not sufficient as the camp is far away from the town and it is very important that it should be well protected. It is evident that more care should be given for the protection of the place than^the time when it is occupied by its staff and employees. You will naturally realize this point and I therefore find that no adequate and proper protection can be ensured with less than the present number of guards. It is my concern to fix the number of guards as I know what number is sufficient, so there is no reason to reduce it. This is one of the demands which I am not going to give up; the number of guards should remain as it was. (2) The Company has agreed to continue to pay the rent of the house, and the salary of one guard for it, but refused to &amp;eep servants in it. I concur with the Company in their viev/s and admit that the question of the servants is their concern, but it would be better if they keep one servant for their own purpose, otherwise the question of the servants concerns them only. (3) The question oi communications is one of the most important and vital matters. It is necessary that communications shouldmaintained between me and the Company’s officials and that the mail should continue as before. This has to be arranged and it is not difficult for the Company to arrange it. I admit that this matter is one of the facilities which the Company is making for me in such circumstances and v/hich I appreciate and shall not forget. It is not necessary that the mail should be carried by the Company’s launches as many other means of transport are available such as small launches, etc. I, on my side, find that the continuance of the mail is necessary even _once a week and I agree to take delivery ] of it at Zekrit whence it will be sent to Doha by camel or other reach means of conveyance. The object is that the mail should/Zikrit every week. I do not agree that the mail should be carried once a month as you have mentioned and I do not consider that the Company will be giving me a facility in this matter; as they are already bound to send me the monthly payments and naturally have to send the mail - with it every month. In this the Company will not be co-operating with or assisting me, but if they make arrangements for sending the mail weekly, I deem it as an act of facility by them and value their assistance. I, therefore, hope that arrangements for the carriage of mail weekly, as stated by me, will be made and handed over to my representative at Zikrit who will arrange for its transmission to me. (4) As regards the communications between Dukhan and Doha, as it has been my habit to smoothen matters for the Company I agree v/ith the Company's proposal. (5) The question of payments concerning the Concession remains. You are aware that the payments of the Concession by the Company are my rights and this Company will not be released from their liability except by payment of the rights to the person entitled to it. There is no provision in the agreement making it necessary to act otherwise. I am jusitified if I ask the Company to pay the rights to which I am entitled as I am not exceeding the limits of the Agreement. The payment should therefore be made according to my wish otherwise the Company will not be released from their liability. I think that you will realise that it is my right which I have not exceeded a and bit an the Company must pay my dues in silver rupees. It is for i them to arrange and obtain these coins.. (6) As regards the m Company's statement to you in their letter in which they alleged5. that they have now agreed to give facility. You will understand from our conversation and from what I stated in my previous and present letters that must of my demands are clear rights of mine and there is nothing in them which can be considered as facility or assistance. However I have to submit to your wishes and hope that all will be carried out properly during the period of the suspension of the Company’s operations and should not be stopped except by 'force majeure' which makes it impossible to carry them out. When the state of affairs returned to the normal condition the previous operations have to re-start and proceed according to the necessities of work and exigencies of circumstances. (7) I hope that you have realized that I understand the present situation very well and did my best to afford facilities, and that the Company have not given me great concessions as you have imagined in matters which I have been carrying out. You know that I am not making such requests taking opportunity of the present situation, but gave up many things in response to your wish. I do not want anything from new eh the Company, but most of these had already been agreed upon between us and it is not possible to give them up without a reasonable cause. I gave up other more important matters than these because I found that your requests are reasonable. I afforded facilities and acted in good faith and hope that good faith will be the object of all of us in our work and movements which is better for the security and promotion of mutual interests.Confidential , D,Q,No,C/1392, The Agency, Bahrain, the 14th September 1942, I enclose for your information a copy of a letter in Arabic dated 8th Shaban 1361 (21st August 1942) which I have, received from the Shaikh of Oatar.

No.C/1392 dated the 14th September 1942 forwarding a letter from the Ruler of Qatar dated the 8th Shaban 1361 (21st August 1942). 2. It would seem from the Ruler’s letter that there are two main points on which agreement has still to be reached to which the Ruler attaches primary importance. (a) Number of guards to be retained. (The Ruler is very insistent that there should be no reduction in the present number). (b) Provision of a Company Launch at Company expense to carry mails to Zekrit once a week. 3. Certain progress has been made in that the Ruler has now agreed in principle to the use of camel transport or the cash equiv alent in lieu for the communica tions between Dohah and Dukhan, which are held to be the respon sibility of the Company. Provid ed agreement is reached on the , extent of this service and it is clearly understood that the0 - 2 - Company^ estimate of reason able cost will be accepted as stated in para 6(vii.c) of our letter No.C/3133 dated the 27th July 1942, no deadlock as regards transport need be anticipated. We regret to introduce such details as cost estimates, but our experience in the past with the Shaikh has shewn this to be very necessary. 4. Reference para 2(a), it seems that the Shaikh intends to be adamant on the subject of his guards, and the stage has been reached at which we should ask our Horsham principals for authority to concede this point. If you agree that it will serve no useful purpose to continue to haggle, we suggest a telegram be despatched asking for a ruling. r We believe our principals will be very much interested in your views in considering their decision. It would, therefore, facilitate an early reply if we could quote them in our telegram. 5. Reference 2(b), it is clear from the Rulers letter that he does not wish to dissociate Government and other mail from the Government and commercial» • • 3 7 contacts with Bahrain through the medium of the Company mail, and this is why he asks for weekly services. It is quite obvious that one mail a month is sufficient for any business to be transacted between the Company and the Ruler during the suspension period. In tf'ese circumstances, and in view of the relations between Bahrain and Qatar, a possible solution to the present impasse might be for the British Government to issue a ruling that the Company is permitted to carry Company mail only, which should normally be ^ once monthly. If the Ruler wishes for a weekly postal service, it must be arranged with H.B.M.’s Political Agent, who will arrange for the transport and control of the letters and parcels, and the Company would not be involved. If, as the Shaikh maintains, the question of communications is so vital, the inauguration of this weekly service is the main issue and the question of who pays a ^ minor consideration, and it is reasonable to suppose that the Shaikh would have no objection to the Political Agent organizing a postal service for Qatar on his behalf and debiting him with the cos t.• • » NOTE ON CURRENCY TO BE USED WHEN MAKING CONCESSION PAYMENTS AND OTHER ROUTINE PAYMENTS TO THE SHAIKH OF QATAR 1. ARTICLES IN CONCESSION HAVING A BEARING ON THIS MATTER ( a ) Article 20 The Company’s obligation is limited to paying sums due to the Shaikh into the Eastern Bank Limited, Bahrain. There is no mention of any type of currency to be used. C~ ! (b) Article 4 This Article in enumerating the various concession payments uses 'Rupees, but does not specify silver or notes. (c) Article 15 V / It can be argued that if the Company cannot import silver from India into Qatar or if the export of silver from India to Qatar or from Bahrain to Qatar is forbidden, this situation constitutes ’’force majeure”. It can be argued also that this type of ’’force majeure” comes under the Shaikh’s interpretation in that it is the Shaikh’s respon sibility to arrange for general permission from His Majesty’s Government for the import of silver into Qatar. (d) Article 18 This Article declares both the Company and the Shaikh base their action on the basis of good faith and pure belief and upon the interpretation of this agreement in a manner consistent with reason. It may be argued that notes are not acceptable to a large proportion of the Qatar populace, also that the changing of notes at present involves a large per centage of loss. The Shaikh can maintain with a certain amount of reason on his side that he was entitled to believe from Article 18 that the purchasing power of his payments from the Company would not be reduced by the Company’s use w of paper money. 2. MISCSLLAIT30US ARGUMENTS WHICH T.IA.Y POSSIBLY BS RAISED BY THE SHAIKH (a) If the use of notes has been made necessary by war, the Shaikh of Qatar should not be expected to suffer financial loss as a result of the war. (b) The sheikhdom of Q,atar is in a primitive condition and its people cannot be expected to suddenly take paper money into general use and accord paper money the same purchasing power as silver. The people will have to be educated up to the use of paper currency. Should it be pointed out that paper money is in use in Bahrain, the Shaikh may be expected to argue that Bahrain has been in close contact with British and Indian communities for many years and there is a bank to change the notes at par. (c) Rupees are essential in Qatar pearling transactions at sea. 3. COMPANY’S VIEWS (a) Managing Director’s Views These are given in a telegram dated the 21st October*2 &amp; 1942 which reads as follows: 'Agree to bear extra cost of payment in silver but whether 'or not we should continue to pay in silver is matter for 'Political Agent to decide and you should abide by his 'decision' Prom this it will appear that the Managing Director does not wish to insist on strict adherence to the Company’s rights under Article 20 of the Concession. b) In the absence of any ruling as to the legality of the tender of notes in patar combined with the fact that silver can only be obtained by the Company and exported with the assistance or approval of the Political Department, the Company is not in a position to settle the matter with the Shaikh. (c) It would thus seem that the Political Department, as the Managing Director indicates, must give the ruling. m here appears two courses open to the Political Department: (i) To inform the Shaikh that it is quite clear from the Company’s Concession - Article 20 - that the Company is within its rights not only in paying in all sums into the Pastern Bank Limited, Bahrain, but also in the use of notes, and in this case, it is advisable for the Shaikh to declare paper currency legal tender in patar. Any loss suffered by the Shaikh in changing notes to silver is due to war conditions, and the Company is under no obligation to reimburse the Shaikh in respect of such losses. In fact, losses due to the war must be borne by the Shaikh. (ii) Alternatively, the Political Agent can accept the Shaikh’s contention that it is in the spirit of the Concession - Article 18 - that the Shaikh should not suffer from conditions created by wars outside qatar. If this is conceded, then the Shaikh has a good case for his claim to be paid in silver or in notes on a silver basis if silver itself cannot be made available. If the Political Department favours this alternative, then the Company would expect the following safeguards:- Firstly, assistance from the Political in getting silver from India and exporting it either direct to Qatar or via Bahrain and the Eastern Bank Limited, Bahrain. Secondly, that the Shaikh should be given clearly to understand that the continuance of the arrangements is binding on them only for the period during which operations are suspended and that even during that period they cannot be held responsible if because of deterioration in the war situation or other unforeseen circumstances they are unable to continue the abovementioned facilities. The Company, however, would agree to abide by the decision of the Political Agent as to whether or not the facilities should be continued. Note: It is a matter for consideration as to whether or not, if silver is unavailable, the Company should pay in notes according to face value plus the additional cost, also in notes, of changing the sum due into an equal amount of silver. In practice, this would be very difficult as the Shaikh could'be expected to haggle endlessly on the exchange rate. 27th wctober 1942.CURRENCY N0T3 - TRUCI.^L COAST 1. Any rulings for Qatar should apply to the Trucial Coast Shaikhs also. 2. At present, Sharjah and Dubai payments are made into the Eastern Bank Limited, Bahrain. Remainder draw cash - silver. 3. Difficulties are anticipated in getting the Trucial Coast Shaikhs to accept notes and, if the general ruling by the Political Agent is that notes are to be used, a formal ii rriti ^ by the Political Agent to the ShaikhsTwill be necessary.© &gt;§ 2 - 31 jvi u&gt; BAH RAIN , PE RS I AN GULF. 28th October, 1942.

From the Ruler f s letter it was seen that there were two main points on which agreement had still to be reached to which the Ruler attached primary importance. (a) Number of guards to be retained. (Tbe Ruler was very insistent that there should be no reduction in the present number). 3. As a result of a discussion between Mr. Wakefield and Mr. Packer (the local Manager, Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited) on the 27th October 1942, it was agreed that, in their opinion, little useful purpose could be served by prolonging the argument with the Ruler, and the stage had been reached at which the Managing Director in London should be asked for authority to concede these two points. It was felt that although perhaps the Ruler’s above two demands were hardly logical, they were not really excessive in all the circumstances. The undermentioned telegrams were there fore exchanged, from which it will be seen that the Company agrees to the retention of all the guards and, in principle, BAHREIN PERSIAN GULF Q/Sec/3278 SECRET 18th November, 1942 (b) Provision of water transport at Company expense to carry mails between Bahrain and Zekrit once a week (p .

This is hardly likely to arise as small hired launches or even sailing dhows could bemused if necessary. It was therefore agreed between Mr. Wakefield and the local Manager that the Managing Director’s reservation could best be covered in a general paragraph to the Shaikh on the lines of para 9 of the• • • - 3 - • • • Q/Sec/3278 Company’s letter No.C/3133 dated the 27th July 1942 addressed to H.B.M.'s Political Agent, Bahrain, - extracted below for ready reference: '9. In conclusion, we suggest that it may be made clear to the Shaikh that any of the above commitments outside the Concession fixed obligations (vide para 5) whether continuance of existing facilities or new ones created by the present situation, apply to the suspension period only and the Company reserves the right to cancel any or all of them on the resumption of operations as circumstances direct. Furthermore he should realize that the possibility of the con tinuance of such facilities even during the suspension period is largely dependent upon war conditions remaining unchanged, and any serious deterioration might make it impossible for the Company to carry on 'with its services to the Shaikh. In such a contingency the Company would regard itself as automatically released from responsibility for such services and no form of compensation could be considered.” There seems now no obstacle to obtaining the Shaikh’s formal recognition of the necessity for the suspension of the Company’s operations in Qatar. It is submitted that the Shaikh’s attempt to bring in the question of payment of his dues in silver into the discussion at this late stage should be discouraged. The supply of silver is ! subject to so many factors outside the control of the Company that it would be impossible for the Company to guarantee to produce it. It is suggested that the Shaikh be informed that the Company will do everything in its power within reason to get the requisite silver and will bear the extra cost involved, but whether or not it can be done must depend upon the circumstances at the time payment is due. As the control of silver will doubtless be exercised by the British Government, the Company is prepared to leave it to H.B.M.’s Political Agent to decide whether it is poss ible to pay in silver, as and when large payments become due, and it is suggested that the Ruler also might be prepared to accept his decision. 5. Assuming that the question of silver can be omitted, agreement between the Shaikh and the Company seems to have been reached and the final situation as regards the Ruler’s demands is as follows:• # • • • • 4 Q/Sec/3278 m During the suspension period the Company agree to make payments and provide facilities as under: (a) Annual Concession payment (Rs.300000/- per annum. (b) Pay cash in lieu of petrol and oil allowance (Rs.13250/- per annum). (o) Combined salaries of tbe Ruler's two represents- tives (Rs.1250/- per month). (d) Salary of the Director of Customs, Zekrit. (e) Salary of the head guide, Mansur. (f) Salary of the head guard and 34 guards. (This includes one guard for the Company house at Dohah.) (g) Rent of the Company house at Dohah. (h) The Company will provide water transport between Bahrain and Zekrit for a weekly mail service. (It is noted that the Ruler agrees to take delivery of the mails at Zekrit.) (i) As regards communications between Dohah and the camp at Dukhan, the Company will pay for a camel service twice a month, the cost of the service to be at reasonable rates which will be fixed by the Company and approved by the Political Agent. This bi-monthly service is primarily intended as transport for rations for the guards and any Q,atar personnel on the Company pay roll left in the camp. (j) The Company will also pay the cost of camel or car hire for a visit once a month to the camp by the ohaikh*s representative for the purpose of inspection. The cost of this monthly visit will 5 e , the Company and approved by the Political Agent on the basis of car or camel hire. 6 .

I am sorry for the delay, which was caused by the long time which it now takes to get a reply to telegrams. Company have agreed to retain, during the period while operations are suspended, the same number of guards as are at present employed by them.

Usual Ending. Political Agent, Bahrain.PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LTD. BAH RAIN PERSIAN GULP. D0/Sec/3294 CONFIDENTIAL 29th November, 1942. With reference to your note dated the 29th November enclosing a draft of a letter which you propose to send to the Ruler of Qatar. It is noted that this draft covers all the outstanding points if the question of payment in silver is omitted. Reference para 3, my experience with the Ruler leads me to believe that he will waste more time by arguing that a situation is unlikely to arise in which the Company is unable to maintain the weekly mail service. He will suspect that the Company will take undue advantage of your words 'as long as they are able to do so'. It might prevent more delay if you added to your para 3 - 'The Company agree to accept my decision whether it is possible or not to continue the service'. I have received a letter from the Shaikh dated the 25th November in which he asks that our Sub-Assistant Surgeon, P.S.Dhami, should be allowed to remain in Qatar, presumably based on Dohah, in the capacity of a doctor to the Ruler. The Shaikh proposes to pay his salary, but does not mention medical equipment, drugs, etc. From the Company^ point of view, there are many objections to such a scheme. It is noted that the Shaikh in his letter to me does not suggest that he is thinking of including this idea in his list of conditions to the recognition of the suspension ? I will give you the Company’s views on this new proposal in a day or two. Many thanks for all the trouble you are taking.

Moreover, the more the Ruler’s attention is distracted to detail, the better chance there is of our achieving our main desideratum.

Your Excellency, Usual compliments: We have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 16th of Zilqada 61 on the subject of Dr.Dhami. We understand that you wish the Company to release Dr. Dhami to take up an appointment in your service. The % Company have no objection to this proposal provided Dr. Dhami is prepared to accept the conditions you offer him. We understand that you are prepared to pay his salary and allowances as follows Pay at Rs.400/- per month. Special War Allowance at Rs.25/- per month. Food Allowance at Rs.3/~ per day. In addition, we believe that Your Excellency is prepared to give Dr. Dhami a furnished house to live in with the necessary servants. As Dr. Dhami is a British Indian subject, it was necessary for us to refer this matter to H.B.M. f s Political Agent in Bahrain. V\ T e understand that the Political Agent sees no objection in principle. The question of medical equipment and drugs also arises. It is not easy in these days to obtain supplies, and it may be necessary for Your Excellency to approach the Political Agent for assistance. , We do not know if Your Excellency proposes to set up a free dispensary in Dohah at which the general public can attend for treatment. If you plan to do this, the question of obtain ing sufficient medical supplies may be a serious difficulty. We shall be interested to hear if Your Excellency contemplates opening such a dispensary. As you know, Dukhan camp will be closing down shortly and there will be no facilities left there for Dr. Dhami.

The Company is not in a position to bring pressure upon Dr. Dhami to accept Your Excellency f s offer. We have brought this change of his plans to the notice of H.B.M.'s Political Agent, Bahrain.

A. C. (D T.tf. 1 yb''^ i I have to thank you very much for your letter Ko.0/1809 of 1942, dated 3Cth hovember 1942 in which you have informed me of the continuation of what we demanded from the Company in our fehaba: letter dated 8th fehaban and that you believed that the questions have been settled satisfacorily and that you will compile a clear statement of what has been agreed upon, so that there will be no misundertanding. I value the attention you have taken in this matter. You should know that v/e gave in in this matter in accordance with your wishes otherwise there is no cause for the cessation of the Company's operations and the deprivation of J&amp;z countrymen from the benefit of their work about which I have already said that it would cause a large gap and would have a bad Effect on a large number of people who have been maintain^ themselves on their work. We thank God that the position has very much improved hetter^ than th«t ht—wa-&amp;—duriftg our discussion of these patters and there is nothing left to necessitate the .ofi of operations. We expect that the Company will resume J?' '4 2 &gt;trter oi its operations in the near future. But the letter of the Company’s Manager, which we received on 17th December, is ngt satisfactory and we cannot agree to it, because it i^jiontaining pfescjire. and ambiguous paragraphs.

( , I have received your letter Ko.3306^ dated 17th Jecember 1942 and been surprised to read the first and last portions of your above letter, because their version is contrary to that of the letter of the Political Agent at Bahrain to me on SC^th November 1942, which are obscure and ambiguous. In the beginning of your letter you said that (some of these arrangements are temporary etc) while in the last paragraph of the same letter you said that you believe that some points mentioned in this letter are still under consideration between us (the Manager^and the Political Agent and that the arrangements made are only temporary). I understand from the meaning of this paragraph that your arrangements are temporary and may be cancelled whenever you want. I am not satisfied and cannot agree to such explanations. On the light of the facts, I discussed with the Political Agent, on a true, sincere base and good will, and I explained to him that there is no justifiable cause to stop the operations of the Company and we, on our pact, see nothing to necessitate it. But he asked us to be lenient during the present circumstances and we submitted to his wishes after w^ have explained to him about our facilities in our letter of SthfShaban 1361, in which I made it a condition that the facilities on our side in accordance with his wishes, will depend on the fulfillment of our demands during cessation of the operations. I have received letters from him confirming that, and Jo. / the last of them dated* 30th November 1942, in which he confirmed the continuation of what we demanded. In his letter of 30th * November 1942 the Political Agent said (our demands will continue during the cessation of the operations and that the questions have been settled satis!actorily). No doubt I am content with what has been said by him (PA) and find nothing, which you believe, is still under consideration with him (PA). I very much regret that due to the ostensible meaning of your explanations and their obscure contents I am compelled not to recognise them in any case and do not ageee to them until; it has been confirmed by another letter to me that all arrangements will be continuous and permanent duringthe cessation of the Company’s operations and until the Company resume their operations, when the water resumes its course and everything returned to its old state. If I received a letter from you in accordance with what has agreed upon in these questions I will,tat that time, be in a position to exchange views and remarks with you whenever I think of any.

Points Nos. (iv) to (x) inclusive come under the category of arrangements agreed to subsequent to commencement of operations. In some cases their con tinuance or revision is dependent upon circumstances or the exigencies of the work and not upon the suspension period. They can, however, be stabilised for the dura tion of the suspension period. 5. I think you will agree that your paragraph needs some amendment as the Shaikh is hardly likely to agree that promises in respect of fixed concession obligations are binding for the suspension period only^ ' 6. It appears to us that your letter and the last para graph on page 2 of its enclosure implies that the Company took an active part in the decision to suspend operations whereas in your letter No. C/924 dated the 28th of June 1942 the Shaikh was told by you that H.M. T s Grovernment found it necessary to direct the oil Company to suspend operations. Unless there is any special reason for this change it is felt that it would be better if the Shaikh is allowed to continue to think that the British Govern ment took the initiative in closing down the field. A slight change in the wording of your last paragraph would suffice. If I may suggest it could read as follows 'In consideration of these undertakings by the Company the Shaikh of Qatar accepts the point of view that the suspension of the Company’s opera tions in Qatar was justified having regard to conditions caused by the war.'

BAHRAIN PERSIAN GULF. DO/SA.2/3425 CONFIDENTIAL 10th April, 1943. My dear Vjcbk^&lt;M / PAYMENT OF CONCESSION PAYMENTS IN SILVER RUPEES You will remember that the majority of the Trucial Coast Shaikhs demand payment of our concession obligations in silver. With the knowledge and approval of H.B.M’s Political Agent, Bahrain, who has in the past authorised export from Bahrain, their demands have been complied with to date. Our Managing Director gave the following ruling in this connection n The Company agrees to bear the extra cost of payment 'in silver but whether or not we should continue to 'pay in silver is a matter for the Political Agent to 'decide and you should abide by his decision.' 2. The annual concession payment to the Shaikh of Q,atar of Rs.3,20,000 odd is due on May 17th and we had arranged with the Eastern Bank, Bahrain, tcTTring this in silver from Bombay to Bahrain this month. The Manager, the Eastern Bank, Bahrain, informs us today that the Reserve Bank Currency Department, India, refuse to allow the shipment of the silver rupees for the purpose required (i.e. oil concession payments). It is assumed that this refusal will not apply to this consignment alone, but all future concession payments will come under a similar ban. 3. You will understand that it is not practicable even if it were desirable for us to obtain the required silver by local purchase here in Bahrain. 4. We feel that it is reasonable for the Shaikh of Qatar to ask for silver under the existing conditions on the Trucial Coast. It is understood that in Dubai and Sharjah from 4 to 10$ is charged on notes. British Overseas Airways and Messrs. Cray Mackenzie in these locations demand payment in silver. Under these circumstances, it is impossible for us to convince the Shaikhs that their claims to silver are unreasonable and they should be prepared to accept losses on2 notes as unavoidable and a result of the war. 5. We feel that the situation is such that we have no alternative but to seek the assistance of H.M's Government. It would seem that the Shaikhs should be induced to accept a position in which they and all classes of the communities in their Sheikhdoms accept notes in all circumstances. 6. If this is not feasible, perhaps the Shaikhs could be informed formally by H.B.M’s Political Agent that the Company is within its rights in making payments in notes which are legal tender. 7. The above possible solutions to the Company’s problem assume that the Reserve Bank of India cannot*be prevailed upon to re-consider its decision. 8. Whatever the solution eventually adopted, it is most desirable that the Company should avoid paying 'extra” in notes as a form of compensation to cover the exchange of the notes into silver by the Shaikhs themselves. This is a solution which will doubtless occur to the Shaikhs. It would give rise to interminable arguments with the Shaikhs on the rate to be used, and result in the Rulers now being paid by remittances into Banks, also clamouring for the additional percentages. 9. Meanwhile, it is submitted, it would seem very desirable as an interim measure that H.B.M’s Political Agent should notify the Rulers that the Company has tried to get silver from India to make concession payments to them but so far at least the G-overnment has refused to sanction the export. ~ \ {fyfeRA) 10. If it is in order, also, for the Rulers to be advised to accept notes, this might have the desired effect and settle the problem. 11. We should appreciate an early reply in view of the fact that the Qatar annual payment is due shortly, and shall be very grateful for any advice or assistance.

I thank you for the interest you have been taking in the matter and appreciate your good attention in it. I hope, as you are hoping, that Inshallah no misunderstanding would arise and that matters will go on with good and clear intention and in an atmosphere filled with satisfaction and sincerity. But it is imperative -Mr the one^o realize what would result from some of the phrases i]jj they are framed in such a way that unexpected or unforeseen possibilities may arise* For this purpose you have kindl iiiformeij me to see the statemen &gt;ee Jth kJkjtAW kuv ched to your letter, whether it is correct or i^there^any error in it. This attention deserves thanks and appreciation. I say that the statement contains some points which I am not in a position to consider correct, so I therefore -put up t-o you my remarks -eft; them. In this statement the annual payment has been included and connected with some meanings. As you know these are -fficumbent payments which, whatever happened^ must be paid by the Company their due time/ for the preservation of the concession conditions, and should not be connected with other secondary things', and also the monthly payments to the Representatives will be under the same procedure, remaini the other questions which I discussed with you in the past and/referred to in your previous letters and in your above statement. There is ambiguity in some of the sentences of the statement,which I would like febem &amp;-ls,ar.. In the statement it is said ^The Company undertake to carry out what mentioned (therein) unless they are prevented So K &gt;&gt; from doing by force majeure'J. I cannot say that this is ft ) l correct because I do not know exactly the meaning of force majeure. J ^ , iwi-eJO It might happen that/the^tiijLfie«4, cause the Company will force majeure. This sentence must be corrected with a meaning more simple and clear,-on which there will be no disci 1 P.T.O.And also the last sentence fur the justification of the of view of the Company,for the suspension of their oper !

I ^aiiaai-~fiAy--4t , because the grounds to ju the suspension of the Company’s operations, as stated agreement, have^so far(no^ taken place, but you have on for that^and you have done it as per the letters previo A^&gt; exchanged between ma anri yen, in this matter.

Dear ANNUAL CONCESSION PAYMENT - QATAR I enclose herewith, for your consideration, a draft of a letter to the Ruler of ^atar on the lines discussed by us on Thursday, May 6th. If you think the letter is suitable, we will then credit the Ruler’s account in the Eastern Bank with Rs.3,13,250. Yours sincerely, Enel E.B.Wakefield, Esq., I.C.S., H.B.M.’s Political Agent, Bahrain. J• • • Q/SA.2/3438 9th May, 1943. To H.ii.Shaikh Abdulla bin ^asim al Thani, Ruler of ^atar. Your Excellency, We have the honour to refer to the situation regarding the payment by the Company of the annual concession payment of 3 lakhs of rupees plus Rs.13250/- which we pay to Your Excellency in lieu of the annual supply of petrol and kerosene. The position to date was explained to Shaikh Hamed by Mr. Packer at Dohah on the 29th of April. The main point of the information given to Shaikh Hamed for transmission to Your Excellency was that the Reserve Bank of India had refused to grant an export permit for the above amounts in silver. The Political Agent is the only person who is in a position to approach the Government of India in such a matter. It is necessary also for the Political Agent to issue an export permit for any silver sent out of Bahrain. This applies also to any silver the Company might be able to collect in Bahrain itself, and incidentally to notes as well. It will thus be realised that neither the Company nor any one else can obtain silver from India or Bahrain for export to Q,atar without the assistance of the Political Agent.• • • • • ft q/sa.2/3438 Meanwhile, as Tour Excellency reminds us in your letter dated the 11th of May 1943, payment is due in a few days* time and, there fore, in order to comply with Article 20 of the Concession and to discharge the Company’s obligation to make the annual payment by May the 17th yearly, we have credited Your Excellency’s account in the Eastern Bank with Rs.3,13,250 and we enclose the Bank’s receipt, which, as stated in Article 20, is a full acquittance of th e Company’s liability for the sum mentioned. We would add that, should silver, as a result of the Political Agent's efforts, be obtainable later on and the necessary export permits are also granted, we should of course be pleased to assist Your Excellency in transporting the silver from Bahrain to Zekrit. This assistance would also apply to notes if silver is not procurable. In either case, we should require a cheque on the Eastern Bank for the amount desired signed by Your Excellency and sent to us as an authority for us to draw the money from the Bank. We trust that Your Excellency fully realises that the Company has done everything within its power to meet your wishes regarding form of currency and the method and place of payment.3 Q/3A.2/3438 In conclusion, however, we rould again stress that the company, by crediting Your Excellency 1 s account m the ’astern BanK, has fully discharged Lts obligation under the condi- V.e have the honour to be Your Excellency’s most obedient servants, For &amp; on behalf of PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT ('5AT.«0 LTD.

B.Yake field , Esq.., I.C.S., H.B.M.’s Political Agent, Bahrain.TRANSLATION lEtii Jamad Awal '62* From: Abdulla bin Q,aalm al Thani. To: Tha Manager, P*D,Q., Bahrain. While we were expecting jour replj in respect of the method of sending the annual concession payments, accord ing to your conversation with Shaikh Hamad and your previous letter, I received today your letter dated the 9th May 1943. I was very much surprised at the arrangements made in respect of the above payments which have been credited to our account with the Eastern Bank. This action seems a violation and I never thought that this will happen from you. You know that no arrangement can be made without my agree ment and there is no Article in the conditions of the Concession which allows you to do anything without my agree ment. Hamed has explained to you in conversation between you for what purpose the silver coins are required and told you that we are in great need of them and the time of their use has come. Then you discussed the matter of transporting them (the coins) either from Bahrain to Doha or via Zekrit. Hamed preferred the last (mentioned). After that you asked us in your previous letter to make the arrangements for receiving them (the coins) and we informed you in our letter that all the arrangements have been made and that our repres entative will take the responsibility of delivering them (the coins) direct to Riyan. On this we expected information from you. Finally you inform us of the arrangements which have already been made. Is not this a strange thing ? We never expected this will happen from you* This action is displeasing to us and not in accordance with what we agreed on. We now neither accept this nor agree to it. We inform you that we are in need of the Concession payments in coins to dispose of them in the ways told you by Hamed. We are returning herewith your documents sent from the Bank which are completely unacceptable, and we do not agree on such a matter. We clearly declare that we are displeased with this matter that has happened. (Sealed) Abdulla bin Qasim al ThaniDRAFT To H.E. Shaikh Abdulla bin ^asim al Thani, Ruler of Qatar. Your Excellency, A'V We have the honour to refer to your letter No. - dated the 12th Jamad Awal ’SB*'(17th May 1943)^0 1. In our letter No .Q./SA.2/3438 dated the 9th May 1943, we explained the situation very fully and pointed out that the Company had done everything in its power to procure silver. The Company can do no more except to assist Your Excellency in transporting the silver from Bahrain to Zekrit should silver at some later date become available. This was also explained in our abovementioned letter. 2. Our action in crediting Yoar Excellency’s account in the Eastern Bank with the annual concession payment is in accordance with Article 20 of the Concession and it is necessary for the Company to fulfil its obligation under this Article annually by the 17th of May. This Article was agreed to at the time of the signing of the Concession by Your Excellency and there is nothing in our present action, therefore, which requires Your Excellency’s agreement again. We would stress that the receipt given us from the Bank sent to you, vide Article 20, discharges our liability for this concession payment and the return by you of the Bank’s documents does not alter the fact that the Company has now fulfilled its obligation in respect of the sums due on the 17th of May 1943. 3 . We suggest that you ask the Political Agent to assist you in obtaining silver. The Company, although under no obligation to do so, is still prepared to pay the charges for freight and insurance which are very large. 4. We also suggest you may like to take the Political Agent’s opinion on Article 20 if you are still not satisfied that the Company is within its rights in making the annual concession payrrent by crediting your account in the Eastern 3anK with the sums due.

My dear SILVER CURRENCY FOR QATAR I enclose in original in Arabic a letter from the Ruler of ~atar on the subject of the method of payment of the annual concession payment to latar. I shall be very grateful if you will permit your translator to translate it into English. As you know, our translator is now working for Mr. Bertram Thomas and our second translator finds the Ruler r s letter somewhat confus ing. It may be of importance to have an Agency translation as the Ruler’s letter throughout is very insistent that he does not agree that the Company, by paying the amount into the Eastern Bank, has discharged its obligation under the Concession. Be makes no reference to Article E0 of the Concession and seems to claim some sort of n divine right of Shaikhs' which enables him to change or interpret Articles of the Concession as he pleases. Yours sincerely,!&amp;&gt; Translation of letter dated 22nd Jamad al Awwal 1362(27.5.43) from Shaikh Abdullah bin Qssiir al Thani, C.I.E., Ruler of Qatar, to the Manager, Petroleum Concession Limited, Bahrain. After Compliments, Reference your letter dated 23rd May 1943. I repeat here what I wrote in my letter dated 12th To Jamad al Awwal 1362(17-5-43]that .1 do not agree with the steps you are taking which I con raider -to--bo agalnot my desire and wish the concession payments are my right from the Company. It is I/feo^enjoyl this rlgh ^ and no one els ^ o^Ji neither you nor any othcjr &gt; fr»dy 4s entitled—to take over or misuse this right of mine in &gt;M?manner they like without my consent and approval # As regards what you mentioned in your letter under reference, this is quite inconceivable and cannot be admitted in justice and equity. If you consider that the concession payments are my rights, they should be paid the place where I want or agree to. If you deal with them only as you WuAol ft L*Ayu~itA\„ S 'zS wantj and in the icAV -hfioiy you wish he manner that suits you ; and wh.i-ch'iVTr , T r111j n deem this a contravention and do not agree to it in any case and such action by you is against my wish and without my approval. You are, no doubt, fdc&lt;f aware that payments I want to spend/on i6y requirements and/'are important for the discharge of my affairs. If you stop them by such acts, you will be stopping a part of my needs and thus depriving me of a right which I have been expecting to get. Therefore, I still insist in saying that I do not approve of your action at all and consider that my rights are being unduly delayed. In this coni^sction, I Invite your attention to your letter dated 8th May 1943 in which you have stated that the concession payments are to be paid at Zekrit and that I 4*ave .to arrange for the necessary lorries to carry i the/-wmKM - o t¥\ the cash o-afth from Zekrit to Rayyan and that the Company regrets it is unable to find a means of transport between Zekrit and Rayyan* T^is makes it necessar ^j£^ tiie casil a ^ Doha by means of launch.

You might have understood, as Hamad told you on my behalf, that I am in great need of this money which I crw U~ t , have been ^waiting to spend Irt-thfi.-ways_jneaded. You later took steps wi’Aeh cause harm to me, affect my interests and stand in the face of ray right. I, therefore, do not agree to them and do not admit thein/whatsoever. It is your duty to take steps by which my right due from the Company reaches me,' otherwise I shall consider my right is being misused and that you are intentionally depriving me of it and standing in the way of my making use of it.

It is to be hoped that an Arabic version will not^ reach Qatar. It would be unfortunate also if any Arabic broadcaster uses this news item. Actually, of course, there is no parallel between Qatar and Iraq, but the wording of the cutting gives the impression that condi tions are similar. The Iraq Concessions, I believe, include drilling and production obligations to be fulfilled by fixed dates. As you know, there are no such obligations in the vatar Concession. Even so it is to be hoped that the shaikh of Qatar will recognise the necessity for suspension before any of Saleh’s Kuwait or Basrah correspondents pass on the good news. Yours sincerely, Enel. E.

Your Excellency, We have the honour to refer to your letter dated the 22nd Jamad Awal 1362 (27th May 1943). ^ ^ 1 . we can only refer you once agai^ro the explanation given in our letter No.0/SA.2/3453 dat?fd the 23rd May 1943 and repeat that our action in paying the annual concession payment into the Eastern Bank is in accordance with Article 20 of the Concession. 2. By signing the Concession (which includes Article 20) Your Excellency has already agreed to the method of payment and also the place of payment (see Article 20). Ye wish to make it perfectly clear that it is not the Company’s duty to provide silver nor to deliver money to Your Excellency in Qatar. The fact that we have in the past tried to help by obtaining silver and delivering it in Qatar has been an act of courtesy by the Company. The Company is always prepared to assist Your Excellency in this and other ways whenever possible. As already explained several tines l ^ hTT~~y ea^ The^Company fe^iled^o obtain silver as the Reserve Bank of India refused the export permit. We do not understand why Your Excellency refers to transport arrangements discussed with Shaikh Earned for delivery of silver to ^ekrit. mhese arrangements were, of course, dependent upon the Reserve Bank of India granting us the export permit. 3. However, /it is still our object and yours to obtain, silver coin*/. As previously explained, this object can only be achieved by obtaining an export permit from the Government of India for the silver to be exported from India and a second permit for its export from Bahrain after its arrival by steamer here. The Company tried to get the necessary permit from India on the grounds that silver is required by the Company m the Persian Gulf for concession payments, but it was refused by the Government. It is useless for the Company to argue again that % it must have silver to comply with its concession obligations as there is no mention of silver in the Qatar Concession. It is2 now necessary for Your Excellency to help us to get the ^mits by writlng + '° the Political Agent and asking for his assistance. Immediately the Government issue the permit, the Company will do its part and arrange to pay for the transport and insurance of the silver from Bombay to Bahrain and deliver it, as promised, to your Representative at Zekrit. 4. ''ith all due respect we would point out that letters to the Company containing arguments on the interpretation of Articles of the Concession will not get the result required, that is, an export permit from India. We repeat, if you do your part and get us the permits, we will do the rest and deliver the silver at the earliest possible moment. 5. If, however, you wish us to send you notes this can be arranged immediately. T ’ r e have the honour to be4^ You may have heard that last year the R.A.F. took over equipment and stores from Qatar to the value of Rs•3: lacs on the understanding at the time that the basis of price agreement was already agreed to and settle ment would be made locally. 7/e have recently, however, been informed that the debits have been referred to the Air Ministry, London, for price agreement and method of settlement. In -these circumstances we are anxious to get lists with explanations of the basis on which prices have been assessed to our principals in Horsham by the fastest means. If you can help us we shall be grateful and I enclose the documents concerned in case you wish to see the size of the packet involved before giving your decision.

'Y Your letter No.C/675 of 1943, dated 18th May 1943 has been received and I have noted what you say about the statement which the Company wish to be followed after they have stopped their operations. O'Political Agent, at the beginning of the discussions about this matter I agreed to what you wanted in order to comply with your wishes and not because the Company justified in stopping their operations. I explained this to you in my letter ibar dated 8th oha ban i 361 (21-8-42) where I said 'when you yourself Article 15 of the agreement, during our co^ersation,Jperused the provisions of the said Article and asked me not to demand a rigid application owing to the present circumstances I could not stick to the terms of the Article but acquiesced to your request and fell in with your wishes in the matter of according facilities leaving aside the provisions of the above , jt&gt; ? 7 article.' In my letter of 8th IShaban 1361 (21-8-42) and A&gt; 1% my letter dated ^oth Jamad ul Thani 1361 (11-7-42) I said nothing to you except in good faith and to meet your wishes although I saw no real cause which justified the cessation of the Company’s operations under the terms of the Article in the Concession Agreement dealing with this point. O’Political Agent, I assure you that when I discuss with you any of these points I have nothing in ray mind except sincerity and good faith, though in such matters one must be cautious so that later on no misunderfetanding may take place about any article which is phrased in ambiguous terms. It is this reason which has caused me to make a reference to you regarding the statement w 7 hich you sent me about the Company. I thank you very much for agreeing with me that the three obligatory concession payments are fundamental and obligatory, and that they should not be included amongother secondary matters. I appreciate your attention in ,this matter. As regards what you say about 'force majeure', if I raised objection to this phrase it is because I want to avoid misunderstanding. It is not wise that the matter should be left unclarified for it is possible that the Company might take unfair advantage of this. I therefore raised objection to the wording of this phrase, because 'force majeure' appeared in the Concession Agreement in accordance v/ith the method of agreements. It is better that the wording / should be the same now as it was in the agreement, ' The Company should carry out their undertakings,*1 unless occurences of 'force majeure' take place and stop the operations. Occurrences of 'force Majeure' which prevent the Company from carrying out their Undertakings^ those which oc^ ur !in the Company’s operatiom/at Qatar and nothing else must -it mm nnrV not- be used by the I have pointed this out it is only as a otherwise I and the Company will, Insha allah, base our relations on truth, sincerity and good faith for the strengthening and growth of our mutual interests. As regards what you say about the last sentence of the statement, I did not write anything which signified that I was convinced that there was real cause to justify the Company stopping their operations. As regards your be taken into considera.tion 3 aLion 3 Company as an argument. ^4 ft rcL reference to what I said in my letter '01 26th Jamad ul Than! 1361 (11-7-42), it does not, in any way, convey the meaning you suggest. I assure you that what I wrote in my letters of 26th Jamact ul Thani and 8 th Shdoan 1361 is exactlj^what I mean, and I wrote those letters with sincerity and good faith. If you refer to my letters in question, from which you quoted extracts that suited you, uf you will find that ray meaning not as you have now explained, but you have misinterpreted what I wrote./'N In my letter of 26th Jamad ul Thani 1361, at the beginning of the paragraph from which you quoted, I said 'You observed during our conversation in this connection, when you read Article 15 of the Agreement, that there was no provision in that Agreement relating to this matter. But you directed my attention to the point of view of His Majesty’s Government in this matter.' If you read the following phrase, it will be clear to you what I really meant, a meaning which cannot escape you. 'And I found some justification in what you said', and later, from condition s I said 'There is no ambiguity in it . I that I agree to your wishes and those of your Government O'Political Agent, how do you want me now to change the meaning of what I have said and agree to the view point of the Company about the stoppage of their operationsT If what I said in my letters to you satisfies you and the % Company, well and good. Please refer to the second paragraph of the same letter where you will find that I said 'If I reply to your Honour’s request on the point mentioned above my reply will be restricted to one matter only.' This paragraph is clear and everyone can understand jits meaning and to what it refers. I wonder O'Political Agent how this paragraph which is contained in the same letter escapes you, and you quote certain words the meaning of which is clear are connected with the preceding ones. I am sure that a person of your qualities fully understands what I really mean. The last sentence of my letter dated 26th Jamad ul Thani 1361^11-7-42) is, however, I connected with the preceding one in which I said, 'I explained everything to you during our conversation and made the matter fully clear to you. If you can assure me that all that I have said - and it is an/ambiguous.right - will be carried out, it can then be said that there is justification for what you told me verbally.' I stillaffirm what I said previously. V/hat I said to you is explained, namely, you only expressed your wish and that of the Government, whereas I said that as far as the Company were concerned there was no real justification for them to stop their operations. If, however, what I said to you is carried out, then it can be said that there is justification taking into consideration your point of view and wish. You are not the same as the Company. How do you wish me to agree to the paragrpph which has been framed in the statement in this connection? I am sure that if you will think over the matter you will realize that I was justified in what I have said. clear and what you said to me verbally is what I haveI__ Confidential No. C/914 The Political Agent, Bahrain, presents his compliments to &gt;4^ Political Agency, (5 4 I Bahrain, the 7th July 1943.

BAHRAIN PERSIAN GULF. DO/SA.2/3482 CONFIDENTIAL 4th July, 1943. o ( My dear SILVER CURRENCY FOR QATAlT I have had another letter from the Shaikh of Qatar which contains nothing new except that he implies that the Company is not making a genuine effort to obtain the silver. He again omits all reference to the main point of all my letters that he should apply to you for assistance in getting an export permit for the silver. It is now quite obvious that he is deliberately ignoring our repeated suggestions that he should seek your help and has no intention of taking up the matter with you. If any progress is to be made it seems to us that the time has arrived to try a different and more direct line of approach. Cur suggestion is that you may consider writing a letter to the Shaikh including, if you approve, the following points (a) That the Company has explained to you the Shaikh’s dissatisfaction with the method of payment of the annual concession payment for 1943 and the deadlock which has now been reached on the question of produc tion of silver. (b) That the Company is clearly within its rights under Article 20 of the Concession in making payment into the Eastern Bank, Bahrain. (c) That the Company is not in a position to obtain export permits for silver and such export permits need reference to the Political Agent. (d) That the Political Agent is prepared to use his influence to arrange permits provided certain other matters outstanding between the G-overnment and the Shaikh can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. (b) seems to us of primary importance as the Shaikh bases his uncompromising attitude on the assumption that the Company has not fulfilled its obligation as regards the 1943 annual payment. p.t.o. \K /63Z.2 - In our opinion it is undesirable from the Company’s point of view that the present deadlock should be allowed to continue indefinitely. In spite of the notifications from the Eastern Bank direct to the Shaikh, he persists in repudiating the transaction whereby his account was credited with the annual payment and it is obvious from his letters to us that relations which have been very * amicable for the last seven years have been impaired by the present controversy. In all the circumstances I feel that it is desirable to send a brief interim report to Mr. Skliros. It will be of great advantage if such a report can include the latest developments from your angle and any further steps you may be contemplating to bring about the desired results. Yours sincerely, E.B.Wakefield Esq., I.C.S., H.B.M’s Political Agent, Bahrain.'W?/£}. v SUMMARY OF L3TTER FROM THE SHAIKH OF iiATAR TO THE (2 So) POLITICAL AGENT DATED 4TH JAMAD II 1363 (8/6/43) v —p - V &gt;? ^ The Shaikh appears to imply that he agreed to the suspension of operations because H.M.Gr* wished this, not because the Company were justified in stopping the work under Article 15 of the Concession. He also conveys that he found some justification for the point of view of H.M.G. as explained to him by the Political Agent. He is, however, not prepared to agree that he accepts the point of view that the suspension of the Company’s operations in Qatar was justified having regard' to condi tions caused by the war. The other points in his letter which are mainly reitera tions from previous letters are: (a) Porce majsure {Article 15) cannot be invoked by the Company. (b) The Shaikh implies that although he is insisting that the Company had no justification under Article 15 for stoppage he is satisfied with the present position and he and the Company will base their relations on tru^sincerity and good faith. (1) It would seem vide ^.C.L.letter No.DO/SA.2/3482 of 4th July 1943 that the statement required from the Shaikh will not be forthcoming in the form presented to the Shaikh in the Political Agent’s pare 3 of the attachment to No.C/675 unless considerably stronger pressure is brought to bear on the Shaikh. C. -vU* \ (2) If such pressure is undesirable it is a matter for consideration as. to whether or not the admissions in the Shaikh’s last letter are sufficient for the purposes of H.M.G. As the order to suspend operations in Qatar originated from H.M.G. any attempt by the Shaikh to use Article 15 against the Company would presumably be referred to the Government and handled by the Government without undue difficulty ? The suggested revised statement to cover these admissions could read as follows The Shaikh of Qatar agrees that he found seme justification for the suspension taking into consideration H.M.G’s point of view and wishes, as sxplainod to him by the Political Agent, Bahrain. Therefore, in consideration of the above undertakings by the Company and to conform to the wishes of II.M.G. the Shaikh of Qatar agrees to the suspension of the Company’s operations in Qatar. Notes:(3) Meanwhile, if the payment in silver is no longer likely to affect the issue, it is desirable from the Company’s angle that silver should be delivered to the Shaikh as soon as possible. In this connection, reference para (b) of cur letter DO/S A •2/3432 of 4th July 1943 and in view of the Shaikh’s persistent \ 0^ repudiation of the transaction whereby the annual payment v/as made in the Sastern Bank it is felt most desirable that the Political Agent should write to the Shaikh giving his opinion either formally or unofficially that the Company is clearly within its rights under Article 20 of the Concession in making payment into the Eastern Bank; also that the payment for 1943 into the Bank was male with the knowledge of the Political Agent.The Shaikh of Qatar agrees that he found some justification for the suspension t-aking into consideration H.M.G’s point of view and wishes as explained to him by the Political Agent, Bahrain. Therefore, in consideration of the above undertakings by the Company and to conform to the wishes of H.M.G. the Shaikh of Qatar agrees to the suspension of the Company’s operations in Qatar.Confidential EXPRESS LETTER From Political Agent, Bahrain. Political Resident, Camp Bahrain. To No. C/970 Dated the 18th July 1943. Suspe ns ion of Oil Company 1 a Operations in Qatar § Please refer to the correspondence enclosed with ray Printed Letter No. C/914, dated the 7th July 1943. 2. There are only two questions still in dispute with the Shaikh of Qatar in regard t o the conditions on which he will agree to the suspension of the Oil Company^ operations. The first question relates to the definition of ••force majeure M and can be settled without difficulty. The second question is more important and should, perhaps, be referred to the India Office. 3. In the penultimate paragraph of their telegr No. 10901 dated the 19th June 1942 the India Office observed 'In order to avoid possible future trouble between the Company and the Shaikh it might also be desirable to obtain from him his written recognition of the state of interruption of the Company’s operations' 1 . I have endeavoured to obtain from the Shaikh a written statement in which he admits that the suspension of the Company’s operations in Qatar was justified having regard to conditions caused by the war. The Shaikh is averse to making such an admission, and the most that he will say is that in compliance with the request of the Political Agent and in deference to the wishes of His Majesty’s Government he agrees to the suspension of the Company's operations subject to fulfilment by the Company of certain undertakings. (These undertakings, I may say, have already been agreed to provisionally by the Company)# I ahall be glad to be inforflied whether a written statement to this effect by the Shaikh meets the requirements of the situa tion or whether anything more specific is indispensable. Political Agent, Bahrain.Translation of letter dated 25th Rajab 1362 (28th July 1943) from the Ruler of Qatar to the Poltical Agent, Bahrain. A.C. I thank you very much for your letter No C/969, dated 18th July 1943 and appreciate your good attention and the interest which you have kindly expressed therein. As regards your &gt; reference to what our friend Mr.Packer has told you about the concession payments, no doubt you know that the concession one of payments are/my own rights and not that of the Bank or anyone else, nor can anyone deal with it except me and without my wish. As regards the provisions of the agreement to which you refer, there is none among the provisions of the agreement which empowers anyone to debar me from taking advantage of my clear right which is due from the Company, and put it at the disposal of the Bank or any other source to utilize it. On the sane subject I have written to our friend Mr.Packer and explained to him everything. I regret that I find him makying the matter of the Bank obligatory, to put an obstruction between me and these payments on v/hich my matters are dependent. It is the duty of the Company to observe the delivery of the right to its owners, otherwise, from the point of view of justice and redress, the Company still remain responsible for this right despite the inconcieaable pretexts taken by the Company and the x&amp;fcHXKK&amp;if sticking of onr friend Mr.Packer to a provision v/hich does ncut give meaning that deprives the owners from their rights. I add that these payments which the Company pay annually to us are the only sources on which we depend for payment to our necessary requirements, and on them we are hanging our hopes for settlement of our matters. If they are delayed, how could we carry out our economic duties and settle our requirements and other indispensible matters, the settlement of which is depend on these payments. It is not hidden from you that all these years the Company used to bring these payments to us in silver, but this year they delayed it, by which they closed in our face the means of our utilizing it, besides I am in great need for these payments to spend /f [f 71 fothe necessary matters. I have now explained to yoi thine that requires explanation. I repeat to you i and gratitude iaax^ikackxyHHxKaacHxklHQtScjcxiiHiaixBLfxkHi help you have done in this matter.

You will doubtless have noticed froxa my monthly reports that from the time of the suspension of atar opera tions up to date the Political Agent has been trying to obtain from the haikh. of .atar formal recognition }f the necessity for the suspension of operations by the Company in ,atar. ^ wa ® understood by all the parties concerned that this recognition was to be given in exchange for the con tinuance by the Company of certain existing facilities (plus a few new ones) during the suspension period. All the facilities agreed on came into operation when the at^-r camp closed down in Deceiuber 194c. In spite of constant pressure by the Political Agent the Shaikh has so far failed to sign an agreement, at first on the minor grounds that certain of the facilities are not clearly explained. Latte.rly when his objections under this category were removed he maintained that he had agreed to the suspension of operations because His Majesty’s Government wished this, not because the Company were justified in stopping the wotk under i.rticle 15 of the concession. He also conveyed that he found some justification for the point of view of H. .G. as explained to him by the Political Agent. He refused to accept the Poll ical Agent’s interpretation of the osition framed as follows T ’In consideration of these undertakings by the Company ’^the Shaikh of latar accepts the point of view that ''the suspension of the Company’s operations in atar 'was justified having regard to conditions caused bv 'the v;ar' «v\\• • • 2 S'-** o u ii ‘Uf s “‘“ “ «• i “* '•«« '■ 1 Jr'.*aS!LY‘“ tl ' a - 151 1 ” ok '' 1 (D ha^nn 1 ,h insl8tin e that the Company uad no justification under Article 15 for stoppage he is satisfied with the present oosi- tion and he an! the Company will base their relations on 'truth, sincerity and good faith'. y. 15 ^ o It was necessary to consult the Political Apent who nhts' i ° V/ ^ 118t p 116 5llai ‘ £ll,s deaiands for silver were reason able in view of the currency situation in latar time land on the Trueial Coast) and he was urepared to put up the matter to tne Indian Government with a view to the reversal of the Reserve Ban* of India’s decision eLort^a^it 1 ? suc « eeded ia obtaining the necessary’ ,1 ? - u o * covering concQssion payments for 194.5 •* rt had occurred to him, hov/ever, that if the r&lt;u?er * atar Politico? 16 V '* E dependent upon the active support of the silver-'he rif-ht h« ? rodu ® e the «*P&lt;&gt;rt permit for the 'tll+fo , » b 11 a fraBle »ind to meet the -olitieal neriod on th ® formal recognition of the suspension 1 therefore, bTcreliLd^tL'L^ount'orLf^^K^in^re^ * rr* “ *' port difficulties th. {£i??? e8 ? a T y f ° r tae ‘ 3haiKh t0 ^plain hie xiiicuioies to the political Agent and invoke hiq Aid + rt get the permit.

Both his ideas, however, are unworkable. The first because such quantities of silver are unobtainable and In addi- tion the Political Agent-s permit is still necessary for ex sort from Bahrain. ny form of extra payment also v’ould be unwise. The ShaiKh would never agree to a reasonable rate and once the precedent was set all the other racial Coast Shaikhs and probably the Sultan of luscat would clamour for similar compensation. i'he situation has now been complicated by the arrival in Bahrain of silver earmarked for the Company to cover atar and certain other miscellaneous concession payments for 1943. Honey changers in the bazaars have observed the arrival of tne silver and made their own deductions from which it is to be expected that the Shaikh of c auar will eventually hear that silver in substantial amounts has reached Bahrain. The Political Agent, however, is still the deciding factor. It was felt that with the tfank s small vault crammed with some hundred odd boxes of Company’s silver, it would be necessary for tne Political Agent to take the initiative if any progress is to be made and the action taken is described in the next paragraph. 9 5. The position at the end of July was as follows (a) Concession Payment - 1943 ^ S ^ The Political Agent ha^/ritten to the shaikh making the following points (i) That the Company had fulfilled its obliga tion under the concession by paying the° amount into the Tastern Bank Ltd., Bahrain. (ii) That he understood the Shaikh required silver and the Company were willing to pay the cost of bringing silver rupees from India on this occasion but an export permit was necessary. (iii) If the Shaikh wished the Political Agent to take steps to obtain the permit the Shaikh should inform him accordingly. ' u);-* ^ t ip ^ r 'h •4 &lt;vl n (b) Kecofenition of the necessity for suspension of operations The Political Agent now proposes a revised version based on the Shaikh’s last reply. The exact wording has not been so far communicated to the Company. It may be expected, however, to read roughly as follows 'In consideration of the above undertakings 'by the Company and in deference to the 'wishes of H.! f .G. the Shaikh of Q,atar 'agrees to the suspension of the Company’s 'operations in ^atar' 6. As regards the annual concession payments both for 1943 and the future, the Company’s position is quite sound. Firstly in that the Political Agent has stated in an official letter to the Shaikh that the payment into the Bank fulfils the Company’s obligation. Secondly, the Company is not committed to similar payments in silver in the future and thirdly that the Company’s ability to produce silver is dependent upon the export permit which in turn is dependent upon the good offices of the Political \gent. induce the Shaikh to recognise the suspension in the he would prefer the Shaikh’s attitude is fairly satis factory and it is difficult to conceive of the Shaikh pressing the Company direct on the question of the sus pension with a view to some extortion. The Company’s obvious reply to any such question would be that the sus pension was at the order of His Majesty’s Government. It is not anticipated that His Majesty’s Government would find much difficulty in disposing of any claims by the Shaikh, particularly if his formal agreement to the sus pension had been secured. 7. Although the Political Agent has not been able Yours sincerely «T. Skliros Esq., i:ana,-ing Director, Petroleum Concessions Ltd., Horsham.V 1. On Thursday, the 5th August, the Political Agent discussed the situation with Mr. Packer. The Political Agent confirmed that Mr. Packer’s letter to Mr. Skliros Mo.DO/PA.2/3507 dated the 27th July 1943 was a fair and accurate resume of the situation as far as the Company was concerned. He added that the question of the form in which the Shaikh’s recognition of the necessity for the suspension of operations should he framed had been referred by him to the India Office who would, doubtless be contacting Mr. Skliros. ' ^ 2. As regards silver for qatar the Political Agrent^ explained that following a letter from him to the Shaiich the Shaikh had now asked for assistance in obtaining the export permit for silver and had been informed that the Government of India had released the required amount for the 1943 payment which would be sent by the Company as soon as possible. It should be possible to get the silver to Qatar by mid-August and this should close the silver controversy until next year when the Government of India will presumably again have to decide whether silver is to be released for concession payments to Abu Dhabi, Qatar and other smaller Trucial Coast sheikhdoms. 3. It may be of interest to note the policy of the Government at present regarding silver currency in the Gulf as indicated in the copies of letters attached.

The report which you received about the notice issued by the Shaikh of Dubai in regard to rupee notes and silver rupees is correct. • r ncrt ^ ce h as been issued by the Shaikh of Sharjah. The Shaikhs of Dubai and Sharjah issued these notices at my suggestion since trade was beginning to suffer as a result of the heavy premium on silver rupees at Dubai and Sharjah. 3. I have given no advice on this subject to other Rulers on the Trucial Coast and I imagine that in Abu Dhabi, Ras al Khaimah etc. the silver rupee is at a substantial premium over the rupee note. Bedouin are unlikely ever to attach the same value to paper currencv as ^. to l i:L T er coin ; and as long as Bedouin buy and sell in the markets of the Trucial Coast there will always be a tendency for silver coin to be regarded as more valuable than paper currency.

He went on to say that it is not practicable for the Company to obtain a written undertaking to that effect from the Shaikh, and that if the Shaikh will not give a written statement to the Political Agent either, the Company must be satisfied with his verbal statement, y\ - j 3, On the same day I received an ”important” telegram from the India office, which indicated that the position in regard to the giving of a verbal statement had been misunderstood in London, I made it clear, in reply, that there was no question of a verbal statement and that it was intended that a written statement on the lines indicated in paragraph 5(b) of your letter to Mr. Skliros should take the place/in the Agreement with the Shaikh of Qatar, ofthe earlier statement (given at the end of paragraph 2 of your letter) which the Shaikh was unwilling to sign, 4, The position, therefore, as far as you and I are concerned at this end, has not been affected by this exchange of telegrams. I have, however, been asked to pass Mr.Skliros' message on to you and to request you to ensure that, pending a final reply from London, nothing is said to the Shaikh to give him the impression that his statement is acceptable.

My dear Reference your D.0.No.C/1356 dated the 14th October 1. On thinking over the^6ints raised in our discussion to which you refer, it &gt;o^curred to me that the Shaikh, at one stage in a letter to the Political Agent, state:, that he felt it was necessary to clarify the meaning of 'force majeure' as the Company might take advantage of ^ any ambiguity. He implied that it was^the Company he did not trust and not H.'’ r .G , s representative. 2 . In these circumstances it struck me that para 2 of your draft agreement might be improved. As you will remember we accepted the definition of 'force majeuie as contained in Article 15 of the Concession be applied to conditions (IV) to (X) not because it was a practical or reasonable definition but because we felt that nothing else would satisfy trie Shaikh. On second thoughts, how ever, it occurred to me that the Shaikh might find^it^ very’difficult to turn down a suggestion that the Hon’ble the Political Resident should be the judge as to whethei any of the conditions (IV) to (X) could or could not be fulfilled in certain circumstances or at certain times. It is suggested that your para 2 could perhaps be re drafted with advantage something on the following lines:- 'The Company undertake that they will make the payments and provide the facilities mentioned at items ( IV) to (X) above exactly as they have promised unless they are^prevented from doing so by circumstances outside their control. Should such circumstances arise the Company will explain their difficulties to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. If the 1943.Hon’ble the Political Resident agrees that the Company cannot fulfil the particular promise or promises concerned he^will notify the Ruler to this effect. In such cases the Ruler would not hold'the Company responsible for the fulfilment of the particular promise or promises. It would be clearly understood, however, that the Company would make every effort to overcome the difficulties and fulfil its obligations at the earliest possible time.” 3. You will notice that the term 'force majcure” which seems to excite suspicion, probably on account of its general implication, has been omitted. In our draft too the Shaikh’s usual fear that the Company might invoke 'force majeure' and leave him to take the initiative, if he wanted redress, is avoided. 4. _The only other comment I would like to make is that the Shaikh in the past has been very careful to keep perm«Kient concession obligations separate from suspense period obligations and it might save a query if the following was inserted after condition (III) 'The above three payments are in accordance with the terms of the Catar concession agree ment and 'force majeure' in connection with these is already defined in Article 15 of the Concession.' llajor T.

Reference our telephone conversation on your proposed journey to Doha or Riyan: Since our Dukhan camp on the south-west coast of Oatar has closed down, visits to Doha via Zekrit need some preparation. 2. Sitra to Zekrit : Company launch w Ghazal rt can take you to Zekri t ^ and wait for your return. You can use this launch as^ living quarters. She has cabins, kitchen, bath and refrigera tion for food. There is also a radio-telephone on which you can speak to Bahrain. By arrangement with _ Cable &amp; Wireless you could receive messages from Bahrain. Dukhan camp has no facilities for sleeping or messing. 3. Zekrit to Riyan or Doha : \t Zekrit we have a Bord coupe with pick-up back with 9 x 13 tyres and in good condition. There are also two trucks in running order but these are not fit for a long journey to Doha. It is suggested that you ask the Shaikh to send two of his cars to meet you at Zekrit. taking our coupe in case of trouble with trie Shaikh T s cars. The distance is over 60 miles each way and it takes approximately three hours (each way) going at a comfortable pace. 4. Doha: The Company have a house in Doha tov/n but very poorly equipped without proper sanitation like an Indian Dak bungalow. There is no coox and only a Doha boy. In these circumstances I it is better to start out to Zekrit very eajly it is rather there suggest and get P.T.O. • • •2 ■■ . ; V back to the launch again at night. , hov.'ever, you find it necessary to stay in Doha for a night you could take the cook from the launcn .itu the necessary provisions and water. 5 . Messing : The Company can arrange a cook and provisions to go with you from Bahrain. 6 . Hail Arrangements The Company sends letters to the ../haiKxi by a weekly dhow service. These dhows usually leave on Wednesday but they are dependent to a large extent ^ on the wind. From Zekrit there is only camel service so that it is advisable to allow four or five days for a letter to reach the Shaikh from Bahrain. ^ fact if you sent your letter to the Shaikh by our day service it could not be taken for grantee that the Shaikh would receive it in time ho send you the two cars for Sunday. A better method to ensure that the Shaikh’s cars reach Zekrit to time would be to hav^ cu letter dropped at Doha town by one of the many planes moving between Bahrain and Sharjah almost daily. Company did this on one occasion with success. IRECTORS : ■j u h» GUw ■htntm, C.fi Cayrol, D.S Fraser, C.E S. Gulbenki |. A. Kessle .loiw-a. u« *, Meny ((*&lt; G. Seidel (l W. Sellers Sklirot 7.

After a moving bat otherwise uneventful journey v*e anchored off the petroleum Development (Qatar) Company wharf at-ZeKrit at ten niinuteo five. I went ashore and visited the Company’s Settlement at Dukhan a ten minutes drive over a reasonably goon 2. On the 26th November I landed at 6.50 a.m. and w s met Thani Shaikhs who had arrived the night before with one of Shaikh Abdullah bin Jassim al Tnani’s Buick cars, he left at 7 a.m. and drove over a rough desert track through some of the most dismal country in the world to b'ajhbah where the Shaikh of Qatar is at present living. The fort, it is notning mor* , is about ten minutes drive from the old man’s favourite resi dence of Riyan and to the south of that place. 3 # i was met on arrival by Shaikh Ramad bin Abdullah the second son, a man of portly figure and flabby countenence with a darx beard well streaked with grey and a protruding lower lip. He is the real ruler of the State in collaboration with the unworthy Saleh bin Mana and has completely eclipsed his elder brother Ail. All is by the same mother but is dark in colour and bedouin in appearance and endowed with but one tentn of hi^ father’s and brother’s low cunning. We entered a large hall and after a short interval the old Shaikh appeared walking with difficulty and the aid &gt;f a stick. He is a pleasanter and less repulsive edition uf nis second son. He apologised for not meeting me at the door, has been ill with some sort of eczema of the feet and hands and is now being treated by an Indian doctor from the Bahrain Mission. 4. i produced the Oil Company Suspension Agreement at once and had the Arabic read over to them and the English compared. No objection being raised the Arabic version was signed and I arranged to send over two more copies written in English and aikhS Arabic for signature. / 5. The2 m -t £ sugar quota and complained of the mixture of wheat, barley, and dari they ere being given this month. I told their, they were lucky to get anything to eat and as for their sugar quota there could be no question of increasing it as long as they connived at and actually took part in the smuggling of sugar and rice from Qatar to Hasa, Kuwait,and Persia. I quoted facts and figures which surprised them considerably. They swore by God and took many oaths that I aad been misinformed and wilfully misled by Bahrain so I quoted a Kuwait case for which they could scarcely blame Bahrain. 6 . I then referred to slavery and read a statement made by a boy who died in Bahrain ir. June, and the proceedings in a Criminal Case tried in the Agency court in which the accused had confessed and been sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment for slavery. The man was a Qatar subject. More and greater oat: s were forthcoming and the Shaikh pointed out that one marts statement could not be considered as proof. I replied that if the first case have had been clearly proved he v;ould undoubtedly/heard of it long before now, referred to there being no smoke without a fire, and drew tneir attention to the clouds of smoke that rose from Qatar and caused talk all over the Gulf of their arms,and slave trading, and smugg ling. T ; e had lunch and our* photographs taken b v the Indian doctor. 7 . just before the Friday midday prayer I said farewell to the Shaikhs- and accompanied by Saleb bin Mana drove to Doha, went round the shops in the afternoon and saw rice and sugar on sale in the shops. Saleh bin Mana stuck close to my side and I was hemmed in by tS^h bin Manats brother, bin Uthman the -Director of Customs at Zekrit, and Abdur Rahman bin rarwiSh so T cou^d not expect true answers from the shop keepers. They overlooked my personal servant who made discreet enquiries behind the main body as we moved through the Suq. Some of the shops had not opened after the midday siesta possibly intentionally so that I shoulc not see their contents. I did see enough to convince me that there Is ample rl.ee and sugar in the shops and I ascertained that rice is sold at- 5 - 'I ! ilLegal, export. Sugar is *.65/- internal Ly and *.450/- a two cwt bag for export. My guides tried to tell me that some bags of rice I saw were damaged by sea water and that some bags of sugar in another shop were coffee bags. They have but little respect for the Intellect of a Political Officer. The bazaar was very poorly stocKed with piece-goods and what there were were very expensive, 8. we returned to the house of Saleh bin Mana and as soon as the driver could be found we left on our return journey to Zekrit. As we moved through the town we met Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah driving to meet us. We stopped and for the benefit of the public he enquired loudly about tyres. I replied,and then he drew me further up the street where we conversed in whispers his black* guards holding up the traffic so that none could overhear us. 1 ^. personal servant got nervous and came forward to where he could get an uninterrupted view of my companion. H* is a fair shot. Shaikh Hamad said he wished to know if they could fir- on smugglers. I said it depended on the circumstance. He said supposing his people were fired upon while endeavouring to search a suspected boat at Doha what should he do. I suggested that he might return the compliment but rmst be careful to see that his men did not start the shooting. Some one will probably get shot shortly and it will certainly be an eneny of Shaikh Hamad-s and probably a Bahraini. Still it will discourage smuggling for a short time. Shaikh Hamad then told me in the strictest secrecy the name of a smuggling agent in Bahrain and the name of a dhow captain who loaded 150 bags of sugar at Has Ruken and is presumed to have left for Kuwait. Shaikh Hamad was frightened and was prepared to lose his share of the profit on 130 bags of sugar and betray his friends rather than have more evidence found against him. He is the principal smuggler and is ably abetted by Salen bin Mana and Abdullah bin Darwish, in fact I think they have a virtual monopoly. / 9. We left9. We left Doha at about 2 p.m* and arrived on the launch at Zekrit at 5 p.m. being delayed on the way by a burst tyre. My visit to Doha was interesting and I believe discouraging to certain elements.- COMr ULITTIAL No.C//^ 7 From Political Agency, Bahrain, 29th November 1943, To Ma^or T.
