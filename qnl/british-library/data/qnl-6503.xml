It is difficult to realize the value of British arbitration as to Seistan without entering into the history of that province; our past line of policy in regard to it; its geographical and political value, and the probable effect of Sir Frederic Goldsmid’s decision, now under review. I propose to do this in four separate sections for the sake of clearness and to ^ save trouble of reading to those already acquainted with any particular section. I.

Kv Section I.—Abstract of Persian and Affghanistan History in regard to Seistan, &amp;c. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Seistan, Herat,' and Candahar were more or less subject to the Suffaveean dynasty of Persia. Shortly afterwards Candahar and Herat threw off the Persian yoke, and the Afghans under Meer Mahmoud of Candahar overran and conquered Persia. Persia became totally dismembered; she was unable to resist the encroach ments of Russia, Turkey, and Affghanistan; and, distracted by internal strife, she was compelled to resign to them some of her best provinces. It was not long, however, before a celebrated robber chief, Nadir Shah, sprang up on the ruins of his country. Seizing the crown of Persia, he quickly re acquired the majority of the districts which had been detached from the Persian Empire. He brought into subjection not only Candahar, Herat, Seistan, and Cabul, but even Balkh, Bokhara, and, in a lesser degree, the Punjaub. The Mogul Emperor of Delhi, terrified by his victorious entry into his capital and the slaughter of 1,000,000 of its inhabitants * gave his daughter in marriage to one of the conqueror’s sons, assigning as her dowry all the provinces west of the Indus. The Ameer of Bokhara at the same time paid * The gate at Delhi where Nadir Shah sat to witness the slaughter is still pre served and shown. The 12,000 Persian families transported by Nadir Shah to Cabul at this period have played, and may yet play, an im portant part in Affghan politics. They are called Kuzzilbashes, or “ Red Caps.” homage to the new Persian ruler. L4751. 1 A. D. 1700. 1713—23. 1723. AIt is important to bear in mind the limits of the Persian Empire under Nadir Shah from 1732 to 1747; for Persia’s claims to Seistan, so far as ancient rights are concerned, are based very much upon that period, whilst Affghanistan argues that on this basis she can no more claim Seistan than Cabul, Bokhara, or the Punjaub. 1747. On the assassination of Nadir Shah at Meshed in 1747, a short period of anarchy ensued, followed by the establishment of the Affghan Empire by Ahmed Shah, an Affghan adventurer in Nadir Shah’s army. 1752. Ahmed Shah was crowned at Candahar as the “ chosen of God.” His first act was to wrest Cabul from the Persians, to conquer Seistan and Herat, to make Khorassan feudatory, and acquire the Punjaub. The limits of his empire from 1747 to 1773 were as follows:— N. The Oxus. S. Sea of Oman. E. Sutlej and Indus rivers. W. Khorassan and Kerman. 1773—98. After Ahmed Shah’s death in 1773, the Affghan Empire began rapidly to decay. Balkh asserted her independence; Scinde and Beloochistan withdrew from their allegiance; the Sikhs, under the influence of Runjeet Sing, threw off their yoke ; and Persia began to assert her claims to Herat and its neighbouring provinces. As regards Seistan itself a long blank ensued in her history, for she had not played any prominent part in the dissensions of the period and became practically independent from being ignored by both Persia and Affghanistan. 1826. Although Dost Mahomed on his accession to the Affghan throne in 1826 was most anxious to bring Seistan more directly under his rule, he was too fully employed elsewhere in re-conquering Balkh and Badakshan and extending the boundaries of his kingdom once more to the Oxus, to be able to move against the province. 1834. The comparative rest which Persia was at this period enjoying after a recent and disastrous war with Russia, encouraged the Shah to fill his imagination with the old dreams of extending the Persian Empire to its ancient limits. Much stress was laid on the brief empire of Nadir Shah, and Herat was made for the moment the chief object of intrigue. The British Government resisted the Shah’s claims to Herat as strenuously as he made them. Our Minister at Teheran, whose policy was fully supported by the Home Government, wrote in 1834,— It is unsatisfactory to know that the Shah has very extended schemes of “ conquest in the direction of Affghanistan, and, in common with all his subjects, “ considers that his right of conquest over Herat and Candahar is as complete “ now as in the days of the Suffaveean dynasty. Wishing rather to ascertain the “ exact pretensions of the Persian Ministers than to discuss the question of right, “ I inquired how far they considered the dominion of Persia to extend. Their “ reply was, to Ghiznee. On former occasions, the Hajee had mentioned the “ occupation of Herat as a proximate enterprise, and that of Candahar as one not “ far distant.” Again he wrote,— “ I feel quite assured that the British Government cannot permit the extension “ of the Persian Monarchy in the direction of Affghanistan with a due regard to “ the tranquillity of India; that extension will at once bring Russian influence to “ the threshold of our Empire.” 1838. Four years afterwards, Sir John McNeill, who had succeeded Mr. Ellis as our Minister at Teheran, wrote,— Sir John McNeill to Viscount Palmer- « At Kandahar our position is still very ston, llth pn « precarious, and I enclose a draft treaty “ between the Shah and the Chief of Candahar, Kohendil Khan, which has for its “ object to unite Herat and Candahar under a Chief who shall be nominally “ subject to Persia, but actually under the protection of Russia.” The treaty here alluded to and the open aid of Russia in the Persian Expe dition against Herat at this time were made subjects of public complaint by Lord Palmerston against the Russian Government, and were acknowledged although weakly excused by Count Nesselrode. 1851—57. After repeated failures before Herat, Persia began to turn her attention more to Seistan, and loud were her claims to that province. Intrigue was made v . / i i3 the prelude to possession, and in 1857 Ali Khan, the Chief Ruler in Seistan, was not only induced to go to Teheran, but to marry a Persian Princess and acknow ledge allegiance to the Shah. Unfortunately for himself, this allegiance was unpopular with his brother Chiefs and his own people, and on his return the following year to his capital, he was cruelly murdered, k t _ Seeing the aggressive spirit by which Persia Mimster for Foreign Affairs to Teheran wag ac t ua ted Lord Malmsbury wrote in the Mission. 27tli October 1852. n n • -i • -i i i J following decided language,—- “ Her Majesty’s Government most distinctly declare that they will not allow sc any systematic attempt on the part of Persia to effect a change in the state of “ possession in the countries lying between the Persian frontier and the British “ territories in India.” in his with the bassador * c ‘A rticle 5. “ His Majesty the Shah of Persia engages further to take immediate “ measures for withdrawing from the territory and city of Herat, and “ from every other part of Affghanistan, the Persian troops and autho- “ rities now stationed therein ; such withdrawal to be effected within “ three months from the date of the exchange of the ratifications of this “ Treaty. “Article 6. “ His Majesty the Shah of Persia agrees to relinquish all claims to “ sovereignty over the territory and city of Herat and the countries of “ Affghanistan, and never to demand from the Chiefs of Herat, or of the “ countries of Affghanistan, any marks of obedience, such as the coinage, “ or 4 khootbeh,’ or tribute. “ His Majesty further engages to abstain hereafter from all inter- “ ference with the internal affairs of Affghanistan. His Majesty “ promises to recognize the independence of Herat and of the whole of “ Affghanistan, and never to attempt to interfere with the independence “ of those States. “ In case of differences arising between the Government of Persia and “ the countries of Herat and Affghanistan, the Persian Government “ engages to refer them for adjustment to the friendly offices of the “ British Government, and not to take up arms unless these friendly “ offices fail of effect. “ The British Government, on their part, engage at all times to exert “ their influence with the States of Affghanistan, to prevent any cause “ of umbrage being given by them, or by any of them, to the Persian “ Government; and the British Government, when appealed to by the “ Persian Government, in the event of difficulties arising, will use their “ best endeavours to compose such differences in a manner just and “ honourable to Persia. “Article 7. “ In case of any violation of the Persian frontier by any of the States “ referred to above, the Persian Government shall have the right, if due “ satisfaction is not given, to undertake military operations for the “ repression and punishment of the aggressors ; but it is distinctly “ understood and agreed to that any military force of the Shah which “ may cross the frontier for the above-mentioned purpose shall retire “ within its own territory as soon as its object is accomplished, and that “ the exercise of the above-mentioned right is not to be made a pretext “ for the permanent occupation by Persia, or for the annexation to the “ Persian dominions, of any town or portion of the said States.” ^ j n ^}jg f 0 ] lowing language, which caused the abandonment of their design,— “ The occupation of Seistan, which is a part of Affghanistan, by Persian troops, would be a direct violation of the Treaty of Paris.” Although the Persian Ministers gave up sending troops to Seistan in deference to our remonstrances they did not relinquish in writing their claim to the province, for they said,— “ The Persian Ministers have always considered, and do now con sider, that Seistan antiqud has formed an integral part of the Persian territory; and it is at the present time in the “ possession of the Persian Government, on whose part, f Mr. Murray (to Sudr Azim, 15th May 1858) replied that,— ** 18 no ^ “ The British Cabinet cannot admit the correctness of this view, (t troops “ which is indeed contradicted not only by the political history of “ should “ Seistan, but also by its geographical position, which is represented in “ every existing map possessing any claim to authority as forming part “ of Affganistan.” Matters at last came to an open rupture between Great Britain and Persia, followed by the war of 1856, the siege of Herat by the Persians, and the Treaty of 1857. Lord Cowley, conversations Persian Am- during the negotiations, held the same decided language as before, viz., that Her Majesty’s Government were “ determined that “ Persia should not “ disturb the existing “ state of the tribes on “ her eastern frontiers.” The general sense of this language was em bodied in Articles V„ VI., and VII. of the Treaty of 4th March 1857,* and was prac tically tested shortly afterwards by an at tempt of the Per sians to send a small body of troops into Seistan, and the protest of the British Minister in Mr. Murray May 1858. to the Sadr Azim, 5th u The Sadr Azim May 1858. to Mr. Murray, 13th f ( therefore, it necessary that and soldiers be sent, or new occupa- of the place “ effected.”! “ or a “ tion 1852. 1857-58.; 4 V 1863. Lord Russell to Minister at Teheran, 5th November 1863. Mr. Alison 20th August Memorandum. to Lord Russell, dated 1865, enclosing Shah’s 1862. No further question as to Seistan arose until 1862, when Lord Russell informed the Persian Charge d’Affaires that, “ As Her Majesty’s Government did not recognize the sovereignty of Persia “ over Seistan, they cannot admit that the Lord Russell to Mr. Alison, 30th Octo- &lt; t (j ernan( j gaid have been made by Dost ber 1862. « Mahomed for the submission of Seistan con-^ tt gtituted a case in which, under the seventh Article of the Treaty, they can be “ called upon to acquiesce in any military operations against Affghanistan.” A rp, Our Minister at Teheran was however Mr. Easfrwick to Minister at leheran, j 4 . i j 4 -Ur» 4 - 18* December 1862. shortly afterwards told that,— “ There was reason to regret, with reference to the asserted claims of Persia to “ sovereignty over Seistan, that so much had already been advanced in opposition « to those claims, and Lord Stanley was of opinion therefore that if the discus- “ Sion of the subiect should be forced upon the mission pending further instruc- tions from England, it would be equally just and politic to adopt a less decided “ tone than that used by Mr. Murray in his recent controversy with the Persian “ Government.” Then followed a Despatch from Lord Russell which ran thus,— I have the honour to inform your Excellency that Her Majesty’s Government “ being informed that the title to the sovereignty of Seistan is disputed between “ Persia and Affghanistan, must decline to interfere in the matter, and must leave “ it to both parties to make good their possession by force of arms.” 1865. The Persian Government were not long in taking advantage of the permission apparently implied in this Despatch. The Shah not only renewed his claims to Seistan under his own seal but took the opportunity of occupying the province with Persian troops during the most distracted period of anarchy in Affghanistan, when the Ruler of that country was utterly powerless to resist encroachment. 1868-69. One of the first acts of the present Ameer of Affghanistan after the reconstruc tion of his kingdom in 1868-69 was to protest against the Persian occupation of Seistan. Although after his visit to Umballa he brought Affghan Turkistan, Candahar, and Herat under a consolidated rule, he refrained from moving on Seistan partly in the hope that the British Government would arbitrate in the matter, and partly on account of the advice he received from the Viceroy of India not to enter into any warlike operations. The views of the Ameer Shere Ali, then unreservedly expressed at the Umballa meeting in 1869, are fully quoted in an admirable abstract on the case by Mr. H. Le Poer Wynne, of the Foreign Department Calcutta, dated 29th June 1870. The Persian Government becoming alarmed at the turn matters were taking began loudly to re-assert their counter claims to Seistan. They now argued on entirely new grounds that— “After Lord Russell’s Despatch of 1863, Persia had retaken possession of “ Seistan, that she had not ceased from that Mohsin Khan to Lord Clarendon, momen t to consider it as forming part of the 19th March 18 / 0 . ec interior ofKhorassan, and that the Shah was “ determined to oppose Affghan attempts on that province by force of arms.” And again, “Les armes ont decide en notre faveur, et depuis cinq ans le “ Seistan a fait partie de Notre Province de Mohsin Khan to Lord Clarendon, &lt;{ Khorassan • par consequent il ne saurait 5th April 1870 . re i ever de 1’article six de notre Trait6 “ de Paris.” 1870-71. Such being the position of affairs in 1870-71, Persia and Affghanistan, after it must be said some delay and prevarication on the part of the former State, con sented to British arbitration, the course of which is described in another section. The above designedly brief resume of historical events may give some faint general idea of the political history of Seistan in sufficient detail for the considera tion of the present question. a14751. B Section II. —Geographical and Political Value of Seistan, &amp;c. - Ancient Seistan was of much greater extent than the modern province. It was ^ the country of Jumsheed and Rustoom the heroes of the Persian Nama, as also of Jacob bin Seth the conqueror of the Caliph of Bagdad ; and although now reduced to an almost deplorable condition it once rivalled the most flourishing provinces of Persia. The River Helmund, the ancient Etymander, rising in the mountains of Affghanistan, flows through the centre of Seistan into the so-called lake,—the ancient Aria Palus. The province is described as flat and traversible throughout by wheeled car riage. From it can be reached Herat by a practicable road through Furrah, whilst Candahar is accessible by two easy routes. Meshed and other places in Persia can be reached by equally good tracts, whilst from Sikoha is a road over the mountains into Kerman, as traversed by Meer Mahomed in his invasion of Persia. There are also said to be practicable routes to the Mekran Coast, to Nooshky in Khelat, and to the Bolan Pass. Sir John Malcolm tells us that Nadir Shah in his invasion of Aflghanistan moved an army of 80,000 men through Seistan with the greatest ease. It will be thus seen, without attempting to go into further details, that the road communications are good, and that the province can be made with the assistance of the River Helmund a valuable base of operations for offensive purposes. A careful study of the map, combined with modern gazetteers and the detailed information contained in General Goldsmid’s and Colonel Pollock’s Reports, will be sufficient to show the extreme political importance of any decision affecting Seistan not only to Persia and Affghanistan but to ourselves. A few recent opinions on this subject may not be uninteresting or out of place. Colonel Taylor to Lord Canning, In 1858 our Commissioner at Herat, Colonel 2nd February 1858. Taylor, wrote,— “ Should Persia be permitted to continue the exercise of her influence in “ Seistan, she may have it in her power to propagate falsehoods to the pre judice of India, and being so near the frontiers of India they will be freely “ circulated.” Mr. Murray to Lord Malmsbury, April Our Minister at Teheran wrote in the same 1858. year,— “ Seistan, hitherto considered mapped and described as an integral part of “ Affghanistan, occasionally independent at other times a dependency of Can- “ dahar, is nearer to Candahar than Herat by *200 miles, and is also very consider- “ ably nearer the British frontier of Scinde. In fact, if Persia be allowed a per- “ manent footing there, our respective frontiers will be separated from each other “ by only a distance of 400 miles. Colonel Phayre to Bombay Govern ment, 14th January 1869, written on receiving a letter from Ibraham Khan, saying, that the Persians had driven him from left to right bank of the Helmund, had even taken Jehanabad and Nad Ali on the right bank, and were gradually pressing on to Rudbar, &amp;c. The Political Superintendent of the Scinde Frontier, Colonel Phayre, wrote in 1869 that the position acquired by the Persians in Seistan was,— “ Well selected, both for defence against the “ Seistan Beloochees on the opposite bank, and “ for commanding the several lines of route that radiate from Seistan eastward, viz., that by Shorawuk and the valley of the Lora to the Pisheen Valley and Quetta, and the kafila route to Nooshky. The former of these routes is well watered and supplied; the latter is desert although traversed by caravans, and a route whereby a force can reach Kutchee and turn the Bolan Pass.” “ In a strategical sense,” adds Colonel Phayre, “ and with reference to the well- known ambition of Persia towards Affghanistan, her occupation of Hosseinabad (Nasirabad) is a flank movement of incalculable importance. By it she com pletely turns Herat, Furrah, and Lash Jowain, neutralizes them in fact without endangering her rear communications. Politically speaking she lays the axe at the root of Afghan independance and neutrality; because in Seistan she holds a6 “ more dominating position than the possession of Herat or Furrah would have “ afforded her. “ The present information dispels at once the idea so Jong prevalent that “ impassable deserts interpose an inseparable barrier between Persia and Khelat. “ On the contrary, the facts under report show that from a base in Persian “ Khorassan which is a highly productive country a large army can advance by “ water for nearly 200 miles to Kheirabad whence to Candahar is only 150 miles, “ or to the Bolan Pass 230 miles, both routes being well supplied and watered.” The Affghan Vakeel who brought the letter containing the above information with an appeal for help from the Belooch Chief, Ibraham Khan, exclaimed, “ Sahib the Persians are seizing the gates of Candahar.” The present Ameer of Affghanistan has spoken constantly in the same sense :— ^ , “ Certainly, if Seistan remains in full posses- sundto&amp;trS March 187 °’ and “ r* f Persia &gt; it will -e day tend to great “ disturbances m Affghanistan. Troops from “ Seistan by the Helmund can come to Candahar without any hill or other “ impediment.” Another high Indian authority, acquainted with Seistan, wrote in 1872,— “ The capabilities of the Seistan district are of very great importance in a “ political military sense, and the possession of the district by Persia is not only &lt;c a direct menace to the very existence of the Affghan kingdom but to the “ security of the Western Provinces of India. The country on this side of the “ boundary range between Persia and Seistan is a vast level plain extremely “ fertile and capable of enormous development. It is abundantly watered by “ the rivers flowing to the Helmund, and possesses every facility for the main- “ tenance and supply of a large army.” Other well known opinions in the same sense might be quoted, but probably enough has been said to enable us to enter upon the account of General Gold- smid’s arbitration with an adequate idea of the geographical value of the district and the importance to us politically of any decision affecting it.

The arbitration of the British Government in regard to Seistan having been accepted by Persia and Affghanistan, Major-General Sir F. Goldsmid was appointed Arbitrator and left England on the 10th November 1871 accompanied by Colonel Pollock, Major Evan Smith, and other Officers. His instructions were to ascertain the status quo of Seistan; to meet the Persian and Affghan Commissioners at some Despatch of Secretary of State and pre-arranged point; to acquire all the local Mr. Alison’s Telegram to Viceroy, 9th [ f f ^ • r n: nnwpr . qru i a f tpr h Pnri ' n p.

The mission arrived at Bombay on the 3rd December 1871, when it was decided that General Goldsmid should proceed to Seistan by Bunder Abbass, whilst Colonel Pollock was to go by Candahar in company with the Affghan Commissioner. General Goldsmid reached Bam on the 7th January 1872, at which place he was met by the Persian Commissioner Mirza General Goldsmid to Secretary of State, Maasum K han. Sekoha was reached on the loth January and 31st October 1872. -t . i i tvt • i t mi • 1st rebruary, and Nasirabad on the 5th. This latter place, which appears to be a fortified post, is described as the Perso-Seistan capital. General Goldsmid soon found himself in a position of great difficulty. The Affghan Commissioner had not yet joined him General Goldsmid to Secretary of State, whilst the Persian Commissioner stifled all other S MarCh and 3ISt ^ ’ local in q uir y a nd assumed a tone which is described as defiant and unfriendly. The whole effort of the Persian Commissioner was to throw discredit on the Mission; for, whilst endeavouring to persuade General Goldsmid that under the terms of Lord Russell’s letter no inquiry was necessary, he forbad the Mission flying the British flag, prevented its officers from entering towns or villages, gave them inferior quarters, cut off their supplies when wishing to march to Rudbar or other places, used insulting expressions in his correspondence,—in fact, did everything in his power to make all inquiry a failure. General Goldsmid displayed great judgment throughout this disagreeable part of his journey; he dwells strongly in all his letters on the bad conduct of the Mirza; and he had the poor satisfaction afterwards of seeing him punished by a year’s suspension from office in consequence of his (General Goldsmid’s) strong representations to the Persian Government. Colonel Pollock joined General Goldsmid with the Affghan Commissioner on the 8th of March 1872, near Nasirabad. But nfh'?^ 40860 ^ 018 ' 46 ’ all attempts to bring the rival Commissioners together in friendly intercourse were failures, and from this and the other circumstances above narrated both General Goldsmid and Colonel Pollock were forced to agree that “ all hopes of a fair inquiry were vainthat “ the palpable and shameless attempts to stifle plain speech, to reject “ honest evidence, and to get rid of obnoxious witnesses, had culminated into “ unmistakeably offensive expressions in letters,” and made it evident therefore that “ the sooner they moved away from Seistan the better.” The Mission accordingly left Nasirabad on the 11th of March for Meshed where they arrived on the 25th of April, and ^nS e A eral i^R 79 S Tn were gi ven a most honourable reception by 30th Apnl 1872, and 9«h May 1872. ^ Governor) Sultan Mur J jy^ who is described as a man of considerable ability and power. In one of General Goldsmid’s conversations with the Persian Governor he understood the Prince to say, in reference to the relations between the British and Persian Governments, that he “ upheld the theory advocated by the Persian “ Minister in London, that if England would support his nation by money as of “ old, she would find in her a true and faithful ally in carrying out the protective “ policy on behalf of India.” He admitted however that we should do well to8 make the Affghan Ruler our friend, “provided the said Ruler had power to “ govern his own people and consolidate his own dominions.” From Meshed, which General Goldsmid left on the 3rd of May, the Mission proceeded to Teheran where they arrived on Q^ G M er 1 a G w dsm ;' J «^ S T ecret , 8 S 9 ofState ’ the 4th of June &gt; after accomplishing a total journey from Bunder Abbass of 1,860 miles. A delay of more than a month was here caused by the non-receipt of the statement of the Persian claims. General Goldsmid naively describes the little attentions he received during this interval, and the continued efforts of the Persian Ministers to get him to commit himself to an acknowledgment of their claims before delivering his arbitral opinion. Fortunately General Goldsmid was the right man to deal with intrigue, and wisely avoided committing himself or uttering an unguarded word. ^ ^ ., * c , - ^ . The Persian statement was at length sub- 31® OcJlr 0 872 y ’ mitted &gt; on the 10th of Ju] y 18 72, fouf months after that of the Affghan Commissioner. Both statements may be summarized as follows :— Persian Statement. That according to the principles of every civilized State, ancient and newly acquired rights such as Persia holds in Seistan, dispense with the necessity of adducing proof. That Article 6, 7, and 8 of the Treaty of 1857 prove that Seistan belongs to Persia. That no Affghan has at any time been named Governor of Seistan. That there is no similarity between the Affghans and Seistanees. That Lord Russell’s letter of 1863 obviates any discussion as to the present possessions of Persia in Seistan, and excuses the Persian Government from entering into such discussion. That Seistan has, ab antiqud, belonged to Persia; that she now has firm possession of it, and that in addition to Persia’s natural rights, Seistan belongs to her by conquest in accordance with the decision of the British Government, from Tagut, in Jo wain to Khash Pud above Khash, thence to Kaleh-i-Bist and the desert called Jay a to Jalk, in Beloochistan. Affghan Statement. That it is as clear as daylight that Seistan belongs to Affghanistan. 1 hat it belonged to the empire of Ahmed Shah and his successors and remained ever since under Herat and Candahar. 1 hat Seistanees have often assisted the Affghan Government as can be seen from their graves in Affghan Turkistan. That there are numerous instances of Affghan Rulers in Seistan especially under Yar Mahomed of Herat and others. That the newly acquired sovereignty of Persia in Seistan is only attributable to the internal dissensions of Affghanistan, and in no way founded on right or might. That, as regards Seistanees not speaking the Affghan language, the argument no more holds good than in the case of the Badakshanees, Uzbegs, Hazarah Tribes, and others subject to Affghanistan. General Goldsmid to Political Secretary, India Office, 21st August 1872. Ditto to Secretary of State, 31st Octo ber 1872. Ditto to Foreign Secretry, Calcutta, No. 46, 21st August 1872. General Goldsmid brought the Commissioners together with varied success on three different occasions, on the last of which, 19th August 1872, he delivered his arbitral opinion which will be described in the next section. The Mission left Teheran a few days after- ^ , wards and arrived in England on the 12th September 1872. It is impossible in a summary of this kind to do justice to the interesting descriptions contained in General Goldsmid s despatches in regard to his journey. 1 hey will form a valuable addition to future histories and gazetteers. His final Despatch No. 21 of the 31st October 1872, contains a concise narrative of his journey and will repay perusal. ’ i9 Section IV.— Arbitral Opinion. General Goldsmid to Secretary of State, 31st October 1872, Enclosure I. As a prelude to his arbitral opinion, Sir F. Goldsmid gives his views on ancient rights and present possession. As to “ ancient rights,” he says :— “ The Persian claims to Seistan on the “ scroe of ancient rights are not such as to warrant revival after the lapse of “ 100 years during which they have virtually been in abeyance; and I do not “ think that the English ministerial letter quoted (Lord Russell’s letter) alters “ the position in this respect. It left the litigants to settle their quarrel together, “ hut gave no right to Persia which she did not possess irrespectively. Therefore “ an unjust conquest in an arbitration is a right that cannot be considered just by “ virtue of this letter. If Seistan were in no way subject to Affghanistan when “ under the aegis of Persia, and subsequently garrisoned by Persian troops, then “ has her independence been assailed, and I cannot say that the acts of Ali Khan “ or his successor have satisfied me that their allegiance to Persia was the general “ desire of the inhabitants.” As to “ present possession,” General Goldsmid says :— “ It is not easy to define what in the present day is meant by Seistan. I see “ no better way than to illustrate the case by supposing two territories, one “ compact and concentrated which I will call ‘ Seistan Proper,’ the other detached “ and irregular which may be designated outer Seistan.” Seistan Proper is com posed of the country on the left bank of the Helmund, and extends to a distance of about 120 English miles in length, or from the vicinity of the Charboli and “ Khaspar Rivers north to Rudbar south, and its breadth variable. Seistan “ Proper is now, under certain reservations to be noted hereafter, in possession of “ Persia, whose Governor is Meer Alum Khan of Kayn. “ Outer Seistan, on the other hand, irrespective of the desert Shila and “ uninhabited tracts, is in possession of Belooch Chiefs who profess to acknow- “ ledge Persian sovereignty or do not admit allegiance to any power but “ Affghanistan.” General Goldsmid adds,— “ Briefly, being unable to justify the recent action of Persia in Seistan on the “ score of ancient rights to that province, as regards her present possession of “ * Seistan Proper ’ the fact is established, although the action of the authorities “ before described has unquestionably caused me to entertain misgivings on the “ attitude or sentiments of the population in certain instances.” The arbitral opinion is then summed up Secretary of unc | er seven heads,— General Goldsmid to Secretary of State, 31st October 1872, Enclosure No. II. I. That Seistan was undoubtedly part of Persia in ancient times, but that under Ahmed Shah it formed part of the Affghan Empire and had not been recovered to Persia. II. That ancient associations language and habits render its transfer to Persia by no means unnatural or strange, although a century of disconnexion cannot fail to be a bar to validity. III. That facts of possession are all in favour of Affghanistan, and that circum stances show that Persia has exercised no interference in the internal adminis tration of Seistan from the days of Nadir Shah till a very recent date. IY. That geographically, Seistan clearly forms part of Affghanistan. Y. That, whilst Affghanistan has the advantage in claim, it cannot be denied that from year to year she has been relaxing her hold of Seistan ; and although the maimer of the occupation of the province by Persia cannot be admitted to cor respond with the appeal to arms contemplated by Lord Russell’s letter, yet, that 14751. Ci 10 Afghanistan failed to take any measure to counteract Persian influence in treating with the Seis an Chiefs. VI. That the rich tract of country which the Hamun river, on three of its sides, and the Helmund on the fourth, causes to resemble an island, is “ Seistan Proper ” and in absolute possession of Persia ; whilst the district of “ Chakhunser ” and lands of the Helmund above the Kohat Bund and Seistan Desert are known as “ Outer Seistan,” inhabited chiefly by Belooch Chiefs practically acknowledging Affghan sovereignty. VII. That the land designated “ Seistan Proper ” should be hereafter included by a special boundary line within the limits of Persia, to be restored to independence under Persian protection or governed by duly appointed Governors; and that Persia should not possess lands on the right bank of the Helmund. General Goldsmid adds that “ having given the most coveted, populous, and “ richer part of the Seistan province to Persia, it is manifestly fair that some “ compensating benefit should accrue to the losing side. It 'is indispensable, “ therefore, that Nad Ali be evacuated by Persian garrisons, and both banks of “ the Helmund above the Kohat Bund be given to Affghanistan.” The new line of boundary as adjudicated by General Goldsmid to Secretary of gj r p &lt; Goldsmid stretches from Koh Siah on and map. tlie north-west in a line south of Laush Jowam y to the Helmund, the main bed of which river before Kohat is to be the eastern boundary of Persian Seistan. The line then runs in a circular direction to Maleh Siah on the chain of hills between Seistan and Kerman. The Persians are not to cross the Hamun river into Laush Jowain, nor are any works on either side to be carried out calculated to interfere with the requisite supply of water for irrigation on the banks of the Helmund. In delivering his arbitral opinion in the pre sence of the Persian and Affghan Commis sioners, General Goldsmid states that he ex plained his decision in Persian besides giving each Commissioner a map. The Persian Commissioner protested formally against it. He said that Persia must have the whole province or none at all. “ Let it be decided,” he said, “ to “ whom Seistan actually belongs, and of what it consists, and then let a decision “ be given affecting the whole province.” The Affghan Commissioner said lie quite agreed in this view. “ It is quite impossible,” he said, “ that a Persian and an Affghan can live in the same house together.” He then said in a less decided manner that he could not accept the decision. The two Commissioners then made claims and counterclaims for compensation for raids. Some conversation ensued in which the Affghan Commissioner said that one village in Seistan Proper was worth the whole portion given to Affghanistan. The Persian Commissioner, before leaving, repeated his formal protest, adding that Persia “reserved her rights over the whole of Seistan.” General Goldsmid understood that the word “ protest ” meant an appeal to the English Foreign Office. At a subsequent interview with the Persian Prime Minister on the 23rd August, General Goldsmid found him “ vraiment tormente ” at the decision given. He remarked, that it was in accordance with the ancient lamentable policy of England which would not trust Persia, but preferred making a friend of Affghanistan, and he much regretted this new proof of this policy. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs who joined them at that moment, remarked that he knew perfectly well the political reasons that had led to the Helmund being adopted as the eastern line of Persia’s boundary. General Goldsmid then entered into friendly explanations and arguments with the two Ministers, which appeared to have weight with them. They said that their greatest difficulty would be to evacuate Nad Alt and Kaleh-i-fath, and to General Goldsmid to Foreign Secre tary, Calcutta, No. 46, 31st August 1872.

The drift of their remarks were such, General Goldsmid thought, as to justify a belief that they were really inclined to accept the arbitration.

The preceding summary will show that General Goldsmid has carried out a difficult task with great judgment and discretion; and 1 trust that a few general observations on the subject may not be considered out of place. The settlement by British arbitration of boundaries dividing powerful but uncivilized people beyond our border is a new feature in Indian policy, fore shadowing good or evil according to the manner in which it is followed up. If in the light of Western arbitration we merely give a general approval to a boundary decision and leave the result in the hands of Asiatic Powers we dis regard our interests and weaken our policy. If on the other hand in an Eastern point of view we treat the question as intimately affecting our prestige and position in Asia, we must be prepared to make our decision respected with firm language and firm measures. The day has happily arrived when we are more alive than formerly to the necessity of keeping up our prestige in Central and Western Asia. Whilst frankly disavowing aggression, we are learning to appreciate the policy, so warmly advocated by the late Earl of Mayo, of surrounding ourselves with friendly powerful and independent States, within a line of boundaries fixed in some cases by arbitration, all fearing our power, subject to our influence, and ready to act as our friends against foreign intrigue or aggression. A policy with this basis, definitely fixed upon and boldly carried out, is a sure guarantee for the outward protection of India, a castle from which we may afford to laugh at alarm or attack. Count Nesselrode wrote to Lord Palmerston in November 1838, however in sincerely, that the policy of England and Russia was to maintain a complete reciprocity of pacific views and measures and to respect the tranquillity and independence of the countries then lying between them in Asia, in order to “ pre- “ vent the possibility of a conflict between two Great Powers which, that they “ may remain friends, require not to touch each other and not to come hito collision “ in the centre of Asia” If we regard this policy as applicable to ourselves, we at once see the import ance which may some day be attached to the settlement of boundaries in Central or Western Asia, especially if those boundaries in a measure guard the approach to India or help to keep foreign aggression at a proper distance. Although Russia has as usual not kept to the policy announced by Count Nesselrode, yet we have now but little power to resist her aggressions except in one countermove as purely affecting India, viz.:— Strong and independent States outside us, fixed boundaries, our influence and our money actively dispensed within those boundaries, encouragement to British travel and enterprise even at the cost of an occasional life within those boun daries ; in fact a general policy of strength and activity which, without being sensational or springing from fear, will not only have a very wholesome influence on foreign invasion but immeasurably raise our prestige in and out of India.12 I In this sense Persia requires decided handling on our part. If we think that we gain her friendship by encouraging her encroachments towards India and leaving her very much to herself, we are mistaken. Had our policy our influence and our Mission in Persia been what it might have been, we should never have been involved in Seistan difficulties, nor would the Shah have remarked to the late Mr. Alison in 1869 that “he had repeatedly attempted to “ ascertain clearly the “ views and policy of Her Majesty’s Government, and to see how far he could meet their wishes, but had hitherto met with, he confessed, some reserve on their side “ and begged such a frank declaration of their views as would enable him satis- “ factorily to understand his position and the best course to pursue.” Without attempting for a moment to wander into the Central Asian question, it is not inappropriate to draw attention to Seistan on the west and Yarkund on the north as two weak points in our Indian defence. Enough has been said of Seistan to show the ease with which a hostile force could operate from that province as a base, and threaten if not enter India by one of the most accessible of our western passes—the Bolan Pass. As to Yarkund, we are told on good authority that it is as fertile as Cashmere, and possesses means not only for the manufacture of warlike material, but for the support of an army. The capital of Yarkund contains 100,000 prosperous inha bitants, and from it, by a series of not difficult marches with obstacles readily sur mounted by troops accustomed to Turkestan warfare, a hostile army could cross into Cashmere at a time of year when we might find it difficult to prevent it, or it could as easily cross over a small pass into the Chitral Valley, reaching the head waters of the Oxus within a few days’ march of Peshawur. It is not too much to say then that Seistan and Yarkund demand careful attention. In respect to Seistan therefore we should use unmistakeable language to Persia • reject at once her plea of “reserving her rights over the whole province”; and force her to evacuate the forts and positions east of General Goldsmid’s'line. We should at the same time give the Government of India full license to take such steps as may seem most desirable to assist Affghanistan in occupying and holding her share of the province, whilst keeping her from any aggression or war like operations beyond the boundary; we should directly or indirectly subsidize the Beloochee-Seistan Chiefs who now get allowances from Persia to the extent of some *200/. a year; and above all we should station a reliable agent at Candahar to watch events and see our decision respected; we should finally leave no stone unturned by artifice or diplomacy to induce Persia to recall the restless and ambitious Meer of Kayn who has been the cause of all the trouble in Seistan. So important is Seistan to us that failing other means we should even occupy Quetta, could we do so with the full consent of Khelat and Affghanistan, in order to show our determination to guard our Western Frontier and enforce our arbitral decision. Much more could of course be said in regard to our general Eastern policy but it is not in the scope of this Memorandum. It may not be out of place how ever to briefly point to the extreme value of secret service money in the hands * This ought to be at least 100,000/. a year. of tlle Viceroy,^ the greater encouragement At present, if we give a few pounds to we ought to give to adventure and travel Affghanistan or Ivhelat it has to go into the outside India, the opening up of trade routes ^ U dt:adtt i y E a ^Mr thelength w ‘ th C^tral and Western Asia, the „ece S - sfly tor constant and friendly intercourse with the people on and outside our border, and the more decided tone which we might impart with advantage into our foreign diplomacy and action. Such a policy may bring many temporary disappointments but cannot avoid being eventually crowned with success as practically assuring, in combination with the proper settlement of boundaries, our security and peace in India.
